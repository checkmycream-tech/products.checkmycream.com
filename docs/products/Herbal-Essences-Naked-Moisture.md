      <li>The Pantene one is the best of the all three.</li>
      <li>Very happy.</li>
      <li>For the price it is wonderful.  </li>
      <li>Best of luck! :&#x27;D&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>/&gt;Maybe this is your perfect product?</li>

      <li>Best of luck! :&#x27;D&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>/&gt;Maybe this is your perfect product?</li>
      <li>It is GREAT!.</li>
      <li>think this product is great for cleansing on days when there isn&#x27;t a lot of product in the hair...but skip it and use shampoo &amp; conditioner if you&#x27;ve used any hairspray, mousse or gel!</li>
      <li>I think I&#x27;ll stick with Renpure from now on since I can reliably expect not to have residue from it, even though I&#x27;ve never matched the best result I&#x27;ve ever achieved with this product.</li>
      <li>Clairol is on to something here, a marvelous product that mimics WEN for a fraction of the price, but the need to fix the &amp;#34;after smell&amp;#34; issue.  </li>
      <li>In my opinion, it is perfect for them.</li>
      <li>really is awesome- buy it.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> i&#x27;m a fan. i&#x27;ve used two bottles already.</li>
    <li> I was expecting to love this, but it&#x27;s just okay. I must have very dry/damaged hair, because I know this works very well for some people!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay, but it&#x27;s definitely not a replacement for shampoo as it says on the bottle.</li>
    <li> Love the smell! Makes my hair more manageable as opposed to other cleansing conditioners.</li>
    <li> Better than the expensive version! Makes my thick hair soft and smooth.</li>
    <li> Works well. Still need to alter once in awhile to get rid of residue.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t say enough about this.  For the price it is wonderful.  We have tried Wen but couldn&#x27;t afford to keep up with the subscription.  I have very oily hair so I use a tiny bit of regular shampoo on my scalp at the front, then use this over the rest of my hair.  My ends are very dry and split, so I will use a little leave in when done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My daughter is biracial and this works wonderful for her, curls are more defined in her hair and less frizz.  She swims everyday at school and the chlorine isn&#x27;t even an issue for her.  She caries one to school and uses after swim.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been a Wen user for years..definitely not the same, but a good replacement if watching the $$ ! Love the scent, and not too overpowering.</li>
    <li> Great product. Leaves my hair feeling clean and healthy. I&#x27;ve totally replaced my shampoo/conditioner routine with this cleansing conditioner. My hair is less frizzy and very shiny. I&#x27;ve never used Wen but my daughter said it was very similar but smells much better.</li>
    <li> I have tried  many different cleansing conditioners and this is my favorite. Hands down. It gives major slip, smells wonderful and makes my hair feel clean and super soft. It detangles my 3B/3C curly hair really well. My hair loves it and I will continue to purchase this as long as Herbal Essences makes it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product since October 2014 and my hair has never been softer, more manageable, or healthier than it is right now. This stuff is miracle in a bottle and smells great to boot.</li>
    <li> I would not compare this to Wen, but i you can&#x27;t afford Wen it is a close second. It has a good pump and a pleasant smell that is not overpowering. After after 3 or 4 washes with this I feel the need to wash with a good shampoo and use this as a conditioner, because I don&#x27;t feel this cleanses as well as Wen does.</li>
    <li> I only use cleansing conditioners.  I have a lot of hair, that is very wavy/curly and can be dry. This is very good for people with dry hair.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  It makes my hair &amp; scalp feel amazing. The scent is soothing as well. I use this 3-4 times a week. I am AA with 3C/4A natural hair. I recommend this to other people that are looking to moisturize their natural hair.</li>
    <li> I really wanted to like this. I haven&#x27;t used Herbal Essences since high school. I have wavy/curly (3a), highly porous, fine strands. I&#x27;ve also been dyeing my hair for many years, though I&#x27;ve switched to demi-permanents to reduce damage. I wash once a week and use a cleansing co-wash (usually As I Am) once a week. I tend not to use too much heat on my hair and usually let it dry naturally. That washing pattern been working for me for 3 years now. I&#x27;ve used lots of different products before. I&#x27;m looking for an alternative to my co-wash because it pulls the color out of my hair pretty quickly. While I really like it for cleansing, moisturizing, and enhancing my curl pattern, I&#x27;d like to find something that would be easier on my color, since I spend so much on that.    This product cleans for sure, but the silicone (dimethicone) and the salt (sodium chloride) in the product really dries and damages my hair. I&#x27;ve used it 2 times now, and washed with shampoo in between. I don&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s moisturizing at all. In fact, my hair felt better after using my usual shampoo/conditioner than it does right now. I just used this a few hours ago. My hair is air drying and sort of crunchy. The scent is a little obnoxious as well. If it were a little more mild it would be very pleasant, and after a day it isn&#x27;t so bad, but it really smacks you in the face the first day and lingers. Even though I combed through in the shower, I still had a difficult time combing my hair just out of the shower. Another effect of the drying.    I don&#x27;t hate it because it cleans and it seemed lighter on my hair color than my normal co-wash, but I would really hate to need to deep condition after using a cleansing CONDITIONER!! Also the smell would interfere with any of the wonderful deep conditioning treatments I have. So, as of now, I&#x27;m torn with whether I will use this again. I&#x27;ve used the L&#x27;oreal Everpure and really didn&#x27;t like it, though the smell was better than this. So far I haven&#x27;t found a decent drugstore cleansing conditioner. Maybe they&#x27;ll change the formula in the future to have more natural oils or products in the future and it will be more hydrating.    If anyone is curious: I used 3 pumps to \\&quot;wash\\&quot; my scalp. I thoroughly rinsed and then used another 5 pumps in my mids/ends. I combed through and then put another 2 or 3 pumps in my ends again. I let it sit in a clip for the remainder of my shower and it was the last thing I rinsed out (cold water only), so maybe 10 minutes? I had time to shave my legs, exfoliate and wash my face and body, so it was a good amount of time. My hair is about bra length. I have fine strands but a dense amount of color-treated, curly hair.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a much thicker formula, which allows it to work into your hair more easily, and lasts longer. I love it!</li>
    <li> Great great product! Very comparable to Wen but for $5! I have fine, flat long hair..use 8-10 pumps, work it in really well and rinse really well. Then I use their Naked Volumizing Mousse. My hair is so soft and full of body and Volume, which is hard to find a product that fits all of those qualities for fine and flat hair! LOVE! Hope they keep selling it!</li>
    <li> Not as good as the pantene cleasing conditioner. Smells great tho.</li>
    <li> Seriously.  This is all you need.  Smells nice and will keep your hair clean and give it lots of body.  Way better than that harsh old shampoo.</li>
    <li> I was using wen for a couple of weeks and my hair always felt oily and heavy afterwards. no matter how much I tried to evenly distribute it, my hair never felt clean. I use this and the very first time my hair is hardly even frizzy at all (my hair has a tendency to become a big puff ball), shiny, and CLEAN. Plus I don&#x27;t have to use as much of the product! Great product!</li>
    <li> This works wonderfully for my daughter&#x27;s extremely thick, curly hair and for my fine, semi-curly hair. I don&#x27;t have to use nearly as much as some other reviewers. I start with two pumps and apply strategically to get down to the scalp first. After I feel that the scalp is well covered, I comb it through the hair and let it sit for a couple of minutes. Our hair always looks healthy and clean, and the smell is lovely (lavender and other herbs). I&#x27;ll never go back to shampoo for my regular routine.</li>
    <li> With the exception of the scent, I do like this cleansing conditioner. My hair is clean, shiny &amp; soft, but I can&#x27;t get past the smell. It&#x27;s so strong, smells like I&#x27;m washing my hair with kitchen floor cleaner. For those who don&#x27;t mind strong fragrances, give it a try.</li>
    <li> Great for those days you want to skip shampooing and conditioner. It really does clean hair pretty well and leaves a minty tingling on my scalp that I love, the scent is awesome as well. I can still smell minty fresh after a long day of using it, including a trip to gym.  The only thing is that the label says to use 3-4 pumps. I use more like 6-8 and I have thin right-below-the-shoulder length hair  I don&#x27;t use it everyday but maybe 1-2 per week. Way more economic than wen products and very similar results</li>
    <li> I love everything about this product!  I even like it better than using a shampoo followed by conditioner!  My hair ends up soft and shiny every time I use this.  I have never tried any other cleansing conditioners so I don&#x27;t know how it compares but I don&#x27;t plan to, the price is good and I like the results.  I think it smells good too-nice fresh, minty scent.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this conditioning cleanser!  It smells really good. The conditioner is thick and instantly softened my hair. The slip is great! Cleansed my hair and scalp. Has bit of a tingling affect. I&#x27;m so glad I bought more than one.  I plan to use this product indefinitely!!!!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! I found it at Publix and thought I&#x27;d give it a try. I&#x27;ve done other cleansing conditioners and they&#x27;ve been either too heavy, or really just didn&#x27;t do the job. My hair is colored, flat ironed, weird wavy and a pain to deal with. Often I need several products to make it somewhat manageable, so just the fact I can clean and condition at the same time is awesome. I read another review that said they use a regular shampoo once once in a while and the cleansing conditioner as the conditioner. I like that idea because it can be too heavy over time and you just need a regular shampoo. I recommend this to anyone with thick, coarse, processed hair. It&#x27;s fantastic. But I think someone with finer or oily hair wouldn&#x27;t see the benefits. Rinse, rinse, rinse and rinse some more. It&#x27;ll do a great job with making your hair feel soft and nice and I think it smells good too :-)</li>
    <li> Great conditioning shampoo, and it smells really good.</li>
    <li> I was pleasantly surprised at the volume!  I don&#x27;t like the scent at all. I normally love any lavender.  I will try another one.</li>
    <li> I can not go without cleaning my hair every other day... But washing it with shampoo all th time is brutal on my hair.  This allows me to cleanse, but not totally strip my hair of natural oils it needs.  It smells great and I have great results with this product.  If they ever stop making the this particular co-wash I will be sad.</li>
    <li> Better than WEN! And much more affordable!</li>
    <li> Great product for this price and wonderful herbal scent.</li>
    <li> I read an article about naturally curly hair &amp; how bad shampoo is for it.  So I switched about 3 weeks ago, I was nervous that my hair would look oily but it doesnt.  My hair is brighter &amp; shiny it feels fabulous.  It&#x27;s a keeper.  I just purchased the colored hair fomula to try next.</li>
    <li> Works but im not a fan of mint scent in my hair, burns my eyes when cleansing my hair.  I have sensative eyes.  If it was scented differently, i would like it more.</li>
    <li> First off, my hair type: Coarse, wavy-curly-kinky, super thick, prone to dryness, GRAYING(!), medium length.&lt;br /&gt;Now: I have spent the past eighteen months experimenting with the &amp;#34;no poo&amp;#34; movement (seriously, I know; it just sounds Freudian and perverse. It needs better PR). In an attempt to control the madness that is my hair, I have applied baking soda, distilled water, Belgian yeast, apple cider vinegar, raw honey, avocado, nettle leaves, peanut butter, coconut oil, the essence of unborn kitties, and about a thousand other things onto my head. Faithfully, I tried so many methods from so many books, blogs, and sites; however, my hair did not improve. In fact, at one point, it became one giant dreadlock that brought about a hysterical crying fit. My hair moved as a stiff solid mass of tinder and straw.&lt;br /&gt;So, flashforward to modern times: I have been using L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s Ever Curl Sulfate Free Cleansing Conditioner and, honestly, feeling like this entire pursuit to improve my hair via no poo is just a fruitless pursuit (the L&#x27;Oreal left my hair feeling gummy, heavy, and mos def not clean). As luck would have it, Target was out of the L&#x27;Oreal so my husband and I searched all of the shelves for an alternative. I was hesitant about using the Herbal Essence because I always (I&#x27;m not sure why) associate it with teenagers. But, it was waaaay less expensive than any of the alternatives so I decided why not.&lt;br /&gt; I AM SO GLAD I DID: I have been using HENCC and am delighted (yes, delighted!) with the results. My hair is light and big and soft and, with a bit of Argan oil applied, my curls and waves are far more defined and my hair does not appear dry. I use about 8 pumps of the conditioner in total and massage it vigorously and make sure to saturate the ends of my hair. I work out regularly and sweat like a BEAST, and even after that, this product leaves my hair feeling very clean and smelling fresh. I can understand some having a problem with the  fragrance, but itdoesn&#x27;t really bother me.&lt;br /&gt;I do feel a little guilty because it is not as organic as I would prefer (I&#x27;m the crunchy sort), but you know what? My hair looks great and I barely have to waste any time to make my hair &amp;#34;presentable&amp;#34;. I&#x27;ve never written a review before, but I felt I had to for all of my kinky-curly-frizzy headed sisters out there. (OH! and it&#x27;s sooooo affordable!!)</li>
    <li> This is actually pretty good for a cheap cleansing conditioner and works nicely.</li>
    <li> Best value in cleansing conditioner that I&#x27;ve found.  It never leaves buildup in my hair and makes it so soft.</li>
    <li> Love this product. And the pump is great. Wonderful for natural hair. I use it to pre-poo and co-wash. Smells divine.</li>
    <li> Better than Wen at a fraction of the price.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s seemed ok at first but after a few washes my hair felt like it had a little build up in it and my scalp was itchy.  After researching this, I found out that the company recommends only using this a couple of times in a row, then use a normal shampoo.  I don&#x27;t want a cleanser that requires me to have another cleanser to use in addition to that because the first cleaner leaves a build up in your hair.  What&#x27;s the point in that?</li>
    <li> Excellent product. From a former Wen user [too expensive] this is the next best thing....or maybe better because it is alot less expensive and performs just as well. The scent is a little over powering. I would like to see it toned down a bit.</li>
    <li> The smell of this product burns my eyes and takes my breath away.  The smell stays on my hair for days, even after washing with other products.  It&#x27;s a shame, because the price is right and I like how my hair feels after using it.  I just can&#x27;t get over the smell.  (And &amp;#34;naked&amp;#34; would imply odorless...)</li>
    <li> If  you are using Wen but want something more affordable, you NEED to try this!  I&#x27;ve been using WEN for about 6 months and love it.  I saw this pop up on Pinterest and figured I&#x27;d try it for $5.  The results are just as good as WEN and the only difference/downfall is the scent.  It smells like a mixture of perfume and detergent - I like the smell, actually, but it&#x27;s much stronger than WEN and I can see it bothering someone who is sensitive.</li>
    <li> My mission, at least the first 3 months of this year, is to stretch my relaxer touch up. 12 weeks will be the first week in March, therefore my new growth needs a lot of moisture in order for me to manage my three textures (new growth, texlax, and relax) without causing breakage. I&#x27;ve tried another cowash, Eden Bodyworks, and it really didn&#x27;t work for my hair; it left it feeling like straw and not moisturized at all plus I still had build up on my scalp. However, after ditching that I found this out on Amazon, read the reviews, and decided to give it a try. Thankfully, I did. I have no build up and my hair is truly moisturized. I love the smell and it provided my hair slip. It was easy to comb in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I paid $6.99 on Amazon add on program, but now the price is outrageous at $17 and change from another seller. I&#x27;m not sure why Amazon isn&#x27;t selling it anymore, so went to my local Walgreens and bought three more at $6.99 to stock up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Give it a try and hopefully you feel the same way I do and don&#x27;t forget to review it, because reviews really help me when deciding to purchase any product on Amazon. I go out of my way to reviews products because I think it really helps a potential buyer like myself.</li>
    <li> Like everyone else, I was looking for a cheaper version of the Wen hair cleansing system.&lt;br /&gt;First Sally Beauty came out with a knock off, that was less than impressive. Ok, but not great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Herbal Essences product doesn&#x27;t have the feel of a knock off. It is good enough to stand on it&#x27;s own as a unique product with a similar delivery system to Wen&#x27;s. Same 6-8 pumps massaged in wet hair. My fine hair felt about the same afterwards as it would with Wen.&lt;br /&gt;I actually like the smell better than Wen regular and Wen Fig.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I REALLY love the concept of fewer suds and lather.</li>
    <li> I wash my hair more then I should because of my exercise routine.  I tried this on the hopes that it would be gentle.  I find it hard to rinse out completely.  Maybe I use too much.  Will cut back and see if that helps.</li>
    <li> A friend commented on facebook that it was better and more affordable than Wen.  I&#x27;d seen commercials for Wen and thought I&#x27;d try this product instead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent was absolutely staggering, and not in a good way.  But I&#x27;ve tolerated a lot of products that had only one negative feature, so I bullied on.  After I got out of the shower, my scalp started to burn.  Seriously burn.  The pain reminded me of a hair color mistake I made way back during my misspent youth.  It stopped burning after about 45 minutes, after 2 extra-strength Tylenol and 2 allergy tablets, which I hoped would break the scent reaction in my eyes, nose and throat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The allergic reaction interfered with my sleep and I couldn&#x27;t talk all day today because my throat burned so badly.  I washed my hair again with the shampoo and conditioner I&#x27;d used before, so I&#x27;m not breathing HE any more.  I&#x27;m still uncomfortable, but am taking the allergy tablets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not saying that the product damaged or injured me in any way; I&#x27;m sure 99% of the population can use it without ill effects.  I just happen to be one who is sensitive to some of its ingredients.  I thought I&#x27;d share it in case someone else experiences something similar.  I&#x27;ll give the unused portion to my FB friend.</li>
    <li> So I started using this product about a month ago, in conjunction with Hair, Skin and Nails gummies. I have thin/fine hair, and one of my biggest issues is that I used to wash my hair daily. I decided to try and change my hair habits so I now only wash with shampoo once a week, usually on like Saturday or Sunday to keep it consistent, and the rest of the week I use this ONLY IF I&#x27;m washing my hair. I only co-wash maybe about once or twice in the week as well. It might be a combination of this and the vitamins but I LOVE LOVE LOVE this cleansing conditioner. It smells great, it&#x27;s sulfate free so it&#x27;s gentler to use on an almost daily to daily basis for those of you who frequently wash, it doesn&#x27;t lather, but it coats each strand and helps with de tangling, and my hair dries with shine in it and definitely feels moisturized. I naturally have fine/thin very dry hair and this definitely reversed that!!! I definitely recommend for most people to get out of the habit of shampoo-ing everyday and doing this.</li>
    <li> i read many reviews of cleansing conditioners before deciding that a &amp;#34;drugstore&amp;#34; priced product trial was best. i use another clairol other naked product (volume shampoo) and love it.&lt;br /&gt;i have fine hair and an oily scalp. i air dry my hair.&lt;br /&gt;i follow the instructions (apply, let sit, add water to &amp;#34;lather,&amp;#34; massage, and then rinse off) closely. after use, my hair looks great, for a few hours. if, however, i shower/wash my hair at night, it&#x27;s oily again in the morning, enough that my coworkers have &amp;#34;joked&amp;#34; that i look dirty.&lt;br /&gt;i&#x27;ve been &amp;#34;trial and erroring&amp;#34; for about two weeks. i&#x27;m glad i didn&#x27;t spend the money on wen.</li>
    <li> why pay more when this does the job smells great and rinses clean . I love this product and threw away all my other shampoos and conditioners this is all I need. It removes oil and product still leaving my hair soft and frizz free!</li>
    <li> On my search for a cheaper alternative to Wen, I bought every cleansing conditioner I could find at my local Target. FYI, Renpure has great reviews but that stuff is garbage! It&#x27;s thin, has no scent &amp; made my hair flat, frizzy &amp; gross looking. Herbal Essences was the last thing I thought would actually work but I&#x27;d say it is just as good as my Wen! My hair is shiny, bouncy &amp; full and looks amazing. I would never think a 4.99 drug store brand could live up but this stuff is amazing!</li>
    <li> I like this cleansing conditioner, it cleanses my hair without drying it out and seems to leave less oil behind than other ones I&#x27;ve tried. My hair is very oily and fine so often times I have to follow up with shampoo in my roots after a cleansing conditioner but not with this one. The bottle is bulky and has a gigantic pump which is great because you only have to use 1-2 pumps of product instead of 5 or 6. It saves like 10 seconds in the morning, but that is 10 more seconds I can spend standing in the shower doing nothing so I&#x27;ll take it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff does have a strong fragrance. It says it is supposed to be mint but to me it smells like a really heady flower, sort of like lilac and juniper mixed. It&#x27;s not my favorite but it doesn&#x27;t linger all day so it&#x27;s not so bad. The first couple washes gave me a headache so if you&#x27;re sensitive to fragrance I would avoid this one.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing! This is the absolute best cleansing conditioner I&#x27;ve used besides Wen for my hair. It works just as well as Wen for less than half the price! This stuff made my naturally curly ethnic hair so soft and silky. I used about 7 pumps of this stuff and left it in my hair for about 5 minutes. After rinsing it out my hair was so soft and clean. This product also smells nice. I do wish it smelled more minty but it&#x27;s still nice. It smells a bit tropical to me with a hint of mint. I would definitely recommend this product if you have dry curly hair like mine or just dry hair in generally. This product definitely will add moisture to your hair. It&#x27;s been 3 days since I&#x27;ve used this cleansing conditioner and my hair is still really soft and smooth. I will definitely be re buying this product.</li>
    <li> Works just as well as WEN for a great price. The smell is ok it wasn&#x27;t as strong as other cleansing conditioners I&#x27;ve used.</li>
    <li> WOW Herbal Essences.  This stuff smells delicious, really does clean the hair gently and conditions it beautifully. I&#x27;m a cleansing conditioner junkie so I&#x27;ve tried them all and so far, this is the best one!</li>
    <li> I had tried WEN briefly but could not stomach the price each month! Love that I&#x27;ve found a product that seems to be agreeing with my hair and not drying it out. One note, always be sure to wash it completely out of your hair otherwise you will get annoying dandruff. Glad it is available online as I have such a difficult time finding it in stores.</li>
    <li> Wow, it really is like Wen only much cheaper! I use Wen and wanted to start my son on a cleansing conditioner, but I didn&#x27;t want to spend big bucks on his short little boy hair.  I ordered this for him and just couldn&#x27;t resist trying it myself.  I love the scent!!!  It is herbal and woodsy, but I wouldn&#x27;t say it is minty at all. If you have never used Wen before and want to try this, I would make a few suggestions on how to use this because Wen really teaches you in detail how to use these cleansing conditioners.  Massage a few pumps into your scalp. Really use your fingertips to scrub your roots. Apply a pump or two to the body of your hair. Leave it in for a few minutes. Add water, rub in. Add more water, rub in. Continue until it&#x27;s fully rinsed out. Really be sure to rinse it all out very well to avoid residue build-up!!! It has left my hair so soft, silky, calm, and smooth. Another reviewer was very passionate about hating the smell, but I find it very refreshing.  Also, the scent lingers unlike Wen.  I really really recommend it. After using these cleansing conditioners, using regular shampoos and conditioners just don&#x27;t give the same healthy result. I&#x27;m hooked!</li>
    <li> Maybe it works, maybe it doesn&#x27;t. I won&#x27;t be finding out because the perfume smell is SO OBNOXIOUS that I cannot even wait to wash my hair again and get rid of it!</li>
    <li> this was just an &amp;#34;okay&amp;#34; product; it felt a little heavy in my hair and also my hair didnt feel as clean.  I probably wont buy again.</li>
    <li> At first, it felt strange using a shampoo that doesn&#x27;t lather..  Doing something good for myself like using a product that doesn&#x27;t contain possible carcinogens, makes me feel good about me.  It cleans and conditions my hair like the WEN product at a fraction of the price.</li>
    <li> This cleansing conditioner is great. We&#x27;ve bought similar products in stores for twice the price and have been half as happy with them. This is not something you&#x27;d expect from such a mainstream and inexpensive brand like Herbal Essences, but it is great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tend to rotate this in about every 3 days and my hair is incredibly smooth and it stays hydrated much better. My wife tends to change her color up often, so we have also tried the color saving version of this in a pink/red bottle and it is just as great and she LOVES the smell.</li>
    <li> Well I tried this today, it does work a lot like Wen . The smell of floral is too strong for my noise , I hope it fades soon .</li>
    <li> Surprisingly good! Smells great (better than the rose option in my opinion) and really leaves my hair super clean and moisturized. Would give it a 5-star if it was available in tea tree since this does leave my scalp itchy if I use it too many days in a row.  Update: The smell has become too overpowering for me after using it for a couple of weeks now I prefer the rose....this scent is just too strong and really stays in your hair all day.</li>
    <li> I have been using Wen for four years now and recently it&#x27;s just become cost prohibitive to spend that much on shampoo.  I saw this on Amazon randomly, while purchasing some vitamins and thought, for the price, I will give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;As I said, I&#x27;ve been using Wen, another sulphate free, non foaming cleansing conditioner for four years, so I know the routine.  Herbal Essences isn&#x27;t as good as Wen, but it&#x27;s still worth a try.  I find that it doesn&#x27;t clean as well, and is harder to rinse out.  Also, the fragrance isn&#x27;t as sophisticated as Wen, it&#x27;s a bit fruity and juvenile for my taste, but that is a minor point, in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;If you don&#x27;t want to spend the big bucks on Wen or you&#x27;re just curious, give this a try.  It&#x27;s a good starting point for people who want a sulphate free shampoo who have dry or normal hair.  If you have really oily hair, I&#x27;m not sure you&#x27;ll get the results you&#x27;re looking for.&lt;br /&gt;PLEASE LET ME KNOW IF YOU FOUND THIS REVIEW HELPFUL.</li>
    <li> I was hoping for a less expensive alternative to Wen. This cleansing conditioner has an overwhelming scent. I could hardly stand it and my husband commented several times on how strong it was. Neither of us liked the smell at all.&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t comment on long term use because I can&#x27;t bring myself to try it again. However, I did notice that alcohol is the second ingredient so I assume it will be damaging in the long run.</li>
    <li> After seeing countless infomercials about Wen, I really wanted to try cleansing conditioner without the $30 pricetag. I&#x27;ve read how terrible sulfates/parabens are on your hair and health so I really wanted to get away from shampoos with those ingredients. I tried L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s EverCreme cleansing conditioner but didn&#x27;t like the smell or the fact that the tiny bottle only lasted about 7 washes with my long hair. I found myself having to use A LOT (about 15 pumps) to wash my chest-length hair with L&#x27;Oreal. Herbal Essences comes in a larger bottle (16.9 oz) and the consistency allows me to use much less (about 6 pumps). The smell is fantastic and my hair looks so healthy after using this. My hair isn&#x27;t frizzy and falls nicely after using this, even without straightening it like I normally do. I do use Trader Joe&#x27;s Nourish shampoo every couple days if my hair feels really greasy or if I&#x27;ve used product on it that day. Also, I&#x27;m able to find this at Target for $4.99 so try going there before buying on Amazon.</li>
    <li> It had a very strong smell.  I am a wen user and I was hoping to find a substitute; however, for me, this is not it.</li>
    <li> I love this product! It does not &amp;#34;strip&amp;#34; the color from my hair as using shampoo does. I would recommend it to anyone that has a semi-permanent color. I have very long hair and only need 1 1/2 pumps of product so this will last you a while. Make sure to rinse it well.</li>
    <li> I used to pay for Wen, but it just got to be too expensive so when I found this I was really excited. I dye my hair and using this cleansing conditioner my hair does not fade as fast as using shampoo. The only issue I had (and the reason for only 3 stars) is because it dried out my scalp really bad and gave me dandruff. I have never had dandruff before using this stuff. I may try a combination of this and shampoo/conditioner and switch off.  :-(</li>
    <li> I really like this stuff!  The scent seems strong at first but you get used to it.  To me it smells like dryer sheets, I have used it only once so far but I really like it, my hair is very soft and light and less fly aways in all the humidity here in Charlotte, NC.</li>
    <li> Before I start talking about this product, let me give you a little history about myself and Wen.  I&#x27;m super picky about my hair products, especially shampoo and conditioner.  I&#x27;ve tried everything from the super expensive stuff to the cheap stuff and everything between.  I started using Wen exclusively back in August, and loved it SO much.  My hair was super soft, looked fantastic, and my hair color lasted better than it ever had before.  I went through a RED phase for a few months and it NEVER faded with Wen.  Crazy.  But spending $30 a month on Wen was getting ridiculous, so I started researching other Cleansing conditioners.  I am a review junkie, so based on what I saw, I tried RenPure (from Walgreens) and was horribly disappointed.  It was thin and just overall gross.  Not even on the same playing field as Wen.  Then a few weeks ago, I saw an ad in a magazine for the Herbal Essences dry shampoo, looked it up on Amazon, and saw that there was also a Cleansing Conditioner.  With all great ratings, I decided to try it out.  I was still skeptical, but as you can see from my 5 stars, I love it!  It smells fantastic, has the same great thick consistency as Wen, and literally worked exactly the same, only better.  My hair is less frizzy than it is with Wen (I have to blow dry it, it&#x27;s too cold to let it air dry) and is still super soft!  Love this so much!!</li>
    <li> I have tried most of the cleansing conditioners available at stores.  I have oily roots and dry ends, and this product really cleans my hair.  I don&#x27;t have oily, weighed down hair after using this product.  It&#x27;s inexpensive and after you get use to it, smells great!  I know all products don&#x27;t work on everyone, but this is certainly worth trying!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Wen and prefer Herbal Essences Naked hands down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have fine hair that I need to wash everyday.  I find with this cleansing conditioner i can stretch my washes out.&lt;br /&gt;It really is awesome- buy it.</li>
    <li> I have some experience under my belt now with sulfate free shampoos, co-washing, WEN, etc. My hair is definitely improved from 6 years ago when I still washed my shoulder length dry coarse wavy hair daily with sulfate shampoos that claimed to be mild. Ha Ha. The search has been on ever since for realistically priced, no-hype products.&lt;br /&gt;I tried this recently and while I think it is OK, I wonder why I should use this instead of even much cheaper conditioners like VO5, not marketed as co-wash products. Is there an advantage?&lt;br /&gt;I have gravitated toward less and less actual washing my hair, even with sulfate free products. This has only helped my hair, which has never looked greasy a day in my life. And I used L&#x27;Oreal conditioning cleanser yesterday. But today, after using this in the morning, I find that my scalp is still wet at 6 pm and my hair/scalp feels a bit gummy. Mind you, my hair looks fine. But I am coming to the conclusion that these conditioning cleansers may not live up to the hype, even though they are much cheaper than Wen.&lt;br /&gt;In my parents generation, many women went to the hairdresser once a week to have their hair &amp;#34;done&amp;#34;. It sounds so old fashioned. By contrast,  my generation was brought up to think you have to do something to your hair every day. But maybe you don&#x27;t!!&lt;br /&gt;Perhaps less is more.</li>
    <li> I should have read more reviews. It leaves such a thick, gross film in the hair, that it looks awful and is impossible to style.  Perhaps this works for some, but I will not be buying it again.</li>
    <li> One day it leaves my hair touchably soft without any film. 5 stars! Next time, it leaves uneven greasy and sticky patches of film on my hair that I can&#x27;t even rinse out. Ick! 1 star. Each time I use it the odds of obtaining at least an acceptable outcome are about the same as flipping a coin, but I can&#x27;t think of anything I&#x27;m doing different in particular each time I use it or what I do between washings that would influence the results. I don&#x27;t color, I don&#x27;t use styling products (sprays, gels, etc.), and rarely ever do I use heat appliances. Could it be the silicone? Based on the average of outcomes alone it I would have rated it 3 stars, but when I consider the unpredictability factor I have to knock it down to 2. So tired of this game of chance. I think I&#x27;ll stick with Renpure from now on since I can reliably expect not to have residue from it, even though I&#x27;ve never matched the best result I&#x27;ve ever achieved with this product.</li>
    <li> Saw this on Pinterest as something to try that is better and cheaper than more expensive versions. At the time hadn&#x27;t seen in the stores so tried on amazon. It is GREAT!. Smells awesome and makes my hair shine and feel great. I have since found in the stores. So unless ordering other things on amazon it&#x27;s cheaper in the stores.</li>
    <li> Cleans really well and leas my hair feeling super soft. If you are like me and have curly hair and tend to leave the conditioner in when getting out the shower, do not do this with this. I forgot to wash it out one time due to habit and my hair felt so dry throughout the day like straw. Great for cleansing but not a regular conditioner lol</li>
    <li> Really does help make hair clean however you still need to really wash your hair with shampoo once a week.</li>
    <li> Very good shampoo, specially if you have colored hair. It protects it and gives it good shine. The good size and price makes it a good value.</li>
    <li> Too greasy feel. Hair looked dirty and heavy. Conditioner without cleansing. No lather.</li>
    <li> Brought for my daughter and she is in love with this stuff. Loves the way it leaves her hair and the scent is awesome.</li>
    <li> I actually liked the way this product made my hair look and feel, but the scent is revolting and overwhelming to such an extent that it cannot be used.</li>
    <li> This is really the closet thing to WEN I have found. I have medium length hair, just past shoulders, and I use only 1 full pump. I will buy this again.</li>
    <li> I have very thick, dry hair brunette hair that&#x27;s past my shoulders, and I have hard time with excessive dryness near the tips of my hair, and frizziness.  This cleansing conditioner really helps, and it&#x27;s one of the most pleasant smelling cleansing conditioners out there.  I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s in any way a strong floral scent, but mild and clean.  I still need to use a heat protectant spray and some hair oil prior to using my blowdryer and flat-iron, but the condition of my hair is so much better!  And the price can&#x27;t be beat, either!  Will be purchasing often from now on.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always wanted to try the Wen products,  however the price kept me from doing so.  For awhile, I used the Sally product &amp;#34;Hair One&amp;#34;. I liked it, however it was still pretty pricey at almost $12 per bottle, plus it was kind of a pain to go out of my way to pick it up.  My daughter in law told me about this product so a few weeks ago I bought it.  I have dual processed hair (color and highlights) and all this processing can make it dry and frizzy.  This product is amazing. It drastically brought down the frizz, made my hair soft and extremely manageable.  The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is the scent is kind of strong.  The product also seems to have a cumulative effect when you use it and my hair gets more manageable with each wash.  The other plus of this product is the thickness of it, definitely thicker than HairOne.  I would imagine the release of this product is going to have a significant impact on the sale of Wen since it&#x27;s almost 1/5 the price.</li>
    <li> I frequently use cleansing conditioner and am always looking for ones that give you a good amount of product at a good price. This one is great. It&#x27;s a good sized bottle that should last a while. I&#x27;ve used DevaCurl No-poo and this product is very similar and just as good. I&#x27;m not a fan of the scent of this one, but it&#x27;s not too strong. It cleans my hair very well and doesn&#x27;t weigh it down or make it look greasy.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had to switch out conditioners almost on a monthly basis because I have been so unsatisfied with everything - granted, I have a tight budget and have to go on the cheap end.  One of my biggest problems was that I was allergic to everything!  Even products that claimed to be hypoallergenic!  I was quite surprised when I never had a reaction with this product!  Not only that, but I never noticed it weighing my hair down or leaving it too dry.  This was the first product that I loved through the ENTIRE bottle!  I think some people who are complaining about greasy hair or build up should try massaging the conditioner into their scalp a little more after they let it sit in their hair a couple of minutes.  Since this *is* a gentle cleanser, it won&#x27;t strip your hair like shampoo would, so you will have to do a little more work, but once you do, it does a good job.  I load up my hair with tons of gel every single day, and surprisingly have found this conditioner to not only do a good job cleaning, but it has made my hair LESS greasy!  I admit that there was a transition period for a week or 2 (but greasy hair was not a part of that transition), but after that, my hair was amazing!  - By the way, I am writing this as the *wife* of the account holder, and I have medium length hair.</li>
    <li> I have looked high and low for an alternative to Wen. I used L&#x27;oreal cleansing conditioner but couldn&#x27;t stand the vanilla scent. I used products from Sally&#x27;s and they dried my hair. Finally I tried this and I absolutely love it. I don&#x27;t understand why people complain about the scent, maybe they did get a bad, rancid bottle. I love the way it smells and it leaves my hair so soft and doesn&#x27;t leave it sticky like others I have used. And at $5 I&#x27;m stocking up</li>
    <li> The ingredients are so sub par to Wen.  I usually use the lavender of Wen and this stuff was way heavier.  I&#x27;m now using it for days I&#x27;m just throwing my hair up.</li>
    <li> Smells great works great my hair is silky and I don&#x27;t need to wash it everyday when I transitioned to this product. Just make sure to really work it into your scalp well</li>
    <li> Love it.  Not as much as the Color Me Happy, but still a great product.</li>
    <li> So I just bought the cleansing conditioner earlier today so this is my first time using it.  If my views on this product change after a few more uses I will update my review.  Here it goes....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So the bottle says to use 3-4 pumps on wet hair, work it through your hair, wait a few mins, then rinse.  Simple right?  Well i&#x27;m 5&#x27;3&amp;#34; and my hair is long (almost to my rear end)  and VERY thick.  I ended up using 5 pumps which did cover pretty much all of my hair.  It feels really nice going in.  Remember, this stuff doesn&#x27;t lather so don&#x27;t expect a head full of bubbles ;)  I let it sit in while washing my face then rinsed it out.  It didn&#x27;t sit in for more than 2-3 minutes.  Bear in mind also that the minty smell of this cleansing conditioner is pretty strong.  If you don&#x27;t like the mint smell then you might wanna pass on this one.  I think it smells like I just left the salon (which is def a good thing for me).  After towel drying my hair, I waited about 20 mins and then blasted it with my blowdryer.  It does leave my hair nice and soft, with a fresh minty scent.  All in all, I really like it!</li>
    <li> I read many positive reviews for this product &amp; got excited that it would somehow magically transform my hair. Not so. It seems to work the same as any other regular shampoo I have tried. It didn&#x27;t do anything spectacular for my hair-it isn&#x27;t soft or smooth or full of body &amp; volume. Truthfully, my hair actually seems to feel a tiny bit drier then normal. (Thank you Herbal Essences) The first ingredient is water, followed by alcohol &amp; then more alcohol. And I will comment on the smell-at first it smells as if you&#x27;re shampooing with toothpaste while you&#x27;re in the shower. When your hair dries it then reminds me vaguely of the smell of a perm at the hair salon. (Not pleasant) The only thing that I did like was the pump on the bottle-convenient. So-don&#x27;t get your hopes up...maybe borrow it from someone who&#x27;s purchased it &amp; see if you like it. If you don&#x27;t, you won&#x27;t be stuck with a bottle of crap that&#x27;s going to sit in your shower unused.</li>
    <li> I have tried every Wen knock off trying to find something more inexpensive.  Everything disappointed until Herbal Essences Cleansing conditioner came along.  I have very fine, colored hair and this stuff is incredible.  Actually, I like it better than Wen.  My hair is never flat and styles much easier, and you don&#x27;t have to use a million pumps of this stuff like you do with Wen.  Don&#x27;t get me wrong, Wen is good, but Herbal Essences is GREAT!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I used a variety of cleansing conditioners, and this works as well as any other. However, I found a natural shampoo and conditioner which really tames my hair. For this reason, I am switching.</li>
    <li> So I&#x27;ve tried Wen and Herbal Essences, and I think I am definitely going to make the switch because I cannot justify paying $45 a 16 oz bottle for this product, especially for how much you have to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Similarities: You have to use them in the same way for either to be effective. I have medium length hair, and I have to use 4 pumps for the sides and above the crown of my head and then 4 pumps for the back of my head. You scrub it in for about a minute and brush a comb through, put your hair up or out of the way, go on with your shower and then rinse out. I used both the Wen and Herbal Essences everyday, and I found that my hair got less oily. My hair is softer than it has ever been before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Differences: HERBAL ESSENCES IS SO MUCH CHEAPER. I&#x27;m using the same amount, but at $3-$5 a bottle, I don&#x27;t feel very bad. Also, I have to use just a little bit of hair oil (I use the organix coconut one), and the oil just adds to the softness with the herbal essences. With Wen, it was necessary because it would dry out my hair a little. In addition, with Herbal, you don&#x27;t need to work it into your hair for 5 minutes like Wen, just a couple, and you&#x27;re good to go.</li>
    <li> I considered trying Wen, but the price was a turn off.  Heard about Naked online and decided to give it a try.  I am very impressed.  My hair is soft and easy to detangle after use.  Will definitely stock up on this product.</li>
    <li> I purchased Herbal Essences Cleansing Conditioner to have something to use as an alternative co-wash. Granted, I&#x27;ve been co-washing for quite some time since I went natural, but I&#x27;ve also heard lovely tales of actual, functioning cleansing co-washes from other natural girls. BiancaAlexa on youtube uses As I Am Coconut Cleansing Co-Wash but I stay far, far, FAR away from anything with coconut besides my beloved Holy Grail Shea Moisture Reconstructive Conditioner. I really wanted to use an actual cleansing co-wash, especially since I only shampoo about once a month or so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Normally, I simply co-wash with Trader Joes Tea Tree Tingle and then just take off and go. The only thing with the Tea-Tree Tingle is that it can be very slightly drying since it is Tea Tree, and that&#x27;s its nature. I just like the smell, the wonderful slip it provides and the way that it leaves my hair feeling very clean after a co-wash. It doesn&#x27;t do much at all in the way of detangling, but my hair is a challenge for ANY product outside of Mixed Chicks Deep Conditioner when I do have to detangle. I pity the poor stylist who is confronted with the...............clusterfu** that is my hair when it is soaking wet with no conditioner on it. No wonder my mom gave up when I was nine and got me a relaxer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyways, I purchased the Herbal Essences Naked Cleansing Conditioner at Target for about $5. I LOVE the smell. I love anything with rosemary, mint or lavender, and this has all three. It smells so good and makes my scalp feel nice and tingly. It&#x27;s also super thick, which normally my fine hair doesn&#x27;t tolerate, but this seems to work since it just is rinsed out anyways. The first time I used this I just did as the bottle said and applied three pumps to two sections of my hair. I quickly found that even with fine hair, you do need slightly more product than the bottle advertises.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I worked it through my hair and it did seem to cleanse my curls pretty well. My hair also seemed to have an added addition of moisture from this cleanser that I really liked, since the Tea Tree Tingle is not moisturizing at all. I didn&#x27;t even attempt to detangle with this in my hair, I had an idea of what would happen, and I was not keen on it. I rinsed out the Herbal Essences Naked Cleansing Conditioner and followed my usual routine of applying a conditioner, detangling, finger combing, crying, cursing, using up the hot water, picking out innumerable knots (before I found my beloved, HG detangling comb), drying, and applying leave in and styler.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did notice that my curls looked especially well, and had so much bounce and body and volume to them that I wondered what I was doing or had done right that wash day. Since nothing had changed in my routine besides the addition of the HENCC I figured that this must have done some good to my hair. Since adding small amounts of cones&#x27; to my routine has noticeably changed my hair for the better (I am now able to retain moisture and seem to have significantly less shedding) I suppose I&#x27;ll have to bite the bullet and admit that I now follow a &#x27;modified curly girl routine&#x27;. The one bad cone in this product (Dimethicone) can be removed with a low-poo shampoo, which I already use once a month or so. Since I&#x27;ll only be using this every other week or so, I figure buildup will not be a huge issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very pleased with this product and will use it until it ceases to work, or until I have a horrific negative experience with it (may such a day NEVER come to pass.)</li>
    <li> I have super thick, mid-back length hair that, while smooth and easy to style most times, is a nightmare in high humidity. This stuff works for me. I cleanse my scalp with 3 pumps, warm water and a good finger-tip massage in the shower and rinse with cool water. Then I use a wide toothed shower comb to detangle and will add a pump or two of the conditioner into the ends or any dry spots and rinse carefully. Press a towel to dry hair, comb again carefully with wide toothed comb and let air dry. Was miraculous! Soft, frizz-free hair full of body for less than $6! I will pick up a clarifying shampoo for a once-a-week scrub. Otherwise, I will use this as my main, every other day, with a boar&#x27;s hair brushing on off days to stimulate my scalp and distribute natural oils well.</li>
    <li> Love this product. Highly recommend to others</li>
    <li> My preferred hair washing product. Gets hair clean, but the conditioning power is there as well. Love the slightly herbal scent, just light and clean. Nice to reduce products in the shower, too!</li>
    <li> Let me start with the good: It makes my hair very soft and clean-looking, without feeling stripped. I like that it comes in a pump bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bad: I have fairly long hair (about 2 feet), and it took me 6-7 pumps to coat my hair. After using this only two days, I had already used about 10% of the bottle (so, if you do the math, it will only last me 20 days...).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, even though I read the ingredients and didn&#x27;t think I would have a problem with rosemary, peppermint, or mint, this stuff has a STRONG smell. It seems to get even stronger as the day goes on (is that possible?). I&#x27;ve only used it twice, and I&#x27;ve ended up with a migraine both times I&#x27;ve used it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, if you aren&#x27;t sensitive to scents at all, go for it! It&#x27;s really nice. BUT, if you are even the slightest bit sensitive to perfumes or strong smells, stay clear of this stuff. I&#x27;ll be tossing the rest of mine...I don&#x27;t want to go through another terrible headache.</li>
    <li> I have long hair (mid back) that is straight &amp; very easy to manage.  The first day I used this product my hair was in a ponytail beforehand with no hairspray or mousse. The result after using Naked was good - my hair was clean, soft, easy to brush &amp; blow dry.  Blow dry time actually seemed shorter and my hair looked very shiny after!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Day 2...I waved my hair with hairspray/mousse &amp; used Naked the following morning to wash.  The result?  My hair felt like there was a film on it.  Impossible to blow-dry because my roots were so oily.  Honestly my hair just looked filthy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think this product is great for cleansing on days when there isn&#x27;t a lot of product in the hair...but skip it and use shampoo &amp; conditioner if you&#x27;ve used any hairspray, mousse or gel!</li>
    <li> This stuff works good and smells amazing and fresh.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Wen for over a year and, until now, have not found anything that came close.  I have tried any and all other cleansing conditioners that I could find, but they either left my hair dry, greasy or some strange combination of both.  I decided to purchase (16 oz for $6.99) as I read some good reviews about it online and was pleasantly surprised.  I&#x27;ve been using this for almost two weeks now with great success, and my hair is just as clean and conditioned as using Wen for a quarter of the price.  I&#x27;ll definitely buy this again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only comment I might make is on the usage.  The instructions on the bottle say to use between 3-4 pumps total.  Wen recommends about 8-15 pumps for each wash.  I have long hair (mid back) and with Wen, I typically used 3 pumps for my scalp and 4 for the rest of my hair and would then repeat this, which I believe gave the best results.  Perhaps I&#x27;m used to using Wen, but I did not feel as though 3-4 pumps were enough, and used about 7-8.  I did experiment by both washing only once and washing twice and my hair felt the same after both trials, so now I only wash once.</li>
    <li> I bought this product based on its great smell.  (I was surprised by those who didn&#x27;t like the scent  or thought it was too strong.  My hair can never smell good enough).  I don&#x27;t really understand the point of the product, however.  I tend to think it&#x27;s a lazy girl&#x27;s alternative to a shampoo; you don&#x27;t rub-a dub-scrub, you just put it on and rinse, as you do any conditioner; so there is no, &amp;#34;work,&amp;#34; involved.  At first I thought that &amp;#34;Cleansing Conditioner,&amp;#34; was just another name for a shampoo with conditioner added, but after reading up, realized this is really not the case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I first washed with a shampoo, and made this the second step.  I used much too much however, stupidly, and hair was limp.  I will try again with just several pumps.  I am, as you may guess, judging the product prematurely.  I will edit my review after the next try.  But God, I love the way my hair smells.  Those of you who are older may remember the great smelling shampoos of yester-year:  &amp;#34;Enhance&amp;#34;  &amp;#34;Gee Your Hair Smells Terrific,&amp;#34; &amp;#34;Agree&amp;#34;, and &amp;#34;Lemon-up.&amp;#34;  I cannot for the life of me understand why these great products were taken off the market.  But from the reviews here, it seems that many people are turned off by fragrance.  I am afraid this product might go the same way as those.  I can&#x27;t say that I love the fragrance of this Herbal Essence product as well as any of those just mentioned.  It has more of a perfume smell than those, I would say, but I do love the scent just the same.  (Fragrance would be closest to the &amp;#34;Enhance&amp;#34;).  But bottom line is this is not a shampoo substitute in my opinion.</li>
    <li> This stuff works great. I was using Loreal cleansing conditioner, but I tried this and like it even more than the Loreal.  I use about 4 pumps and work it in, add a little water and scrub it around.  I leave it in my hair until I am done with my shower and then rinse it out well.  You have to use enough product and RINSE it out well, if you don&#x27;t you will not like it.  Once every few weeks I use regular shampoo to give it a good scrubbing and then use this as a conditioner.  Works great and smells nice.  I even use it to shave...razor glides over your skin and it acts a little like a light moisturizer.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing!! I&#x27;ve never done a review, but for this I thought I would. I made sure to use it for a full week or so before I judged it. I was skeptical at first, but reading the positive comments, I really wanted to try it. I have long thick hair, and it made it extremely soft and shiny. I don&#x27;t have a byproduct build up, or dry scalp anymore!! Even though it doesn&#x27;t lather, it hasn&#x27;t made my hair greasy yet. I would recommend this to anyone at $5 a bottle!!</li>
    <li> This stuff is great. I have thick curly hair shoulder legnth that I recently bleached and then dyed so it was pretty damaged. I was looking for a gentle cleanser/conditioner to help maintain my curls and reduce the breakage I was seeing in my hair. The first time I used the product I used the recomended 3-4 pumps and was horrified by the results, although the product smells amazing my hair was waxy and it was like the product never washed out. I don&#x27;t know if it is because we have hard water or what but the next time I used it, I used 2 pumps and my hair came out amazing! My curls came out soft and bouncy and for the first time in a long time I was able to brush through my hair with out any snarls or breakage.&lt;br /&gt;I use this product mainly but about every three washes I use a regular shampoo and conditioner. So far it has been all good and I have been getting compliments on how soft and managable my hair looks. Definately would recomend to all!</li>
    <li> I tried this out on my kiddos (2 &amp; 5) because their baby shampoos seemed to dry out their fine hair. My 5 y/o has long wavy hair, that is fine and prone to tangling. Leave-in conditioner was too heavy for her hair, and regular conditioner didn&#x27;t do much for preventing tangles. I am very pleased with the results of using this on my kiddos hair. Sufficiently cleans out stuff that gets in her hair (think ice cream, lollipop, etc... she&#x27;s 5). However, it leaves her hair very soft, shiny, and helps keep it from tangling. I&#x27;ve had no problems with the product getting in the kid&#x27;s eyes and stinging, which I was worried about with the mint. I used it about 3-4x per week in my kids&#x27; hair with no other shampoo or condition use. In my opinion, it is perfect for them. Their hair doesn&#x27;t get oily, so I am curious how it would cleans oil in hair, but I haven&#x27;t tried it on myself yet.</li>
    <li> The hunt for cleansing conditioner is a challenging one.  The hunt for a GREAT cleansing conditioner is even more challenging!  I had been using Deva.  However, when I had a baby my priorities changed and I just couldn&#x27;t continue to justify the price for the liter bottle.  I tried co-washing, but my hair never felt clean.  Then, I found the L&#x27;oreal EverCurl which I like, but the bottles are small and that little pump doesn&#x27;t move the product out of the bottle fast enough.  I tried this and I think I&#x27;ve found my new fav cleanser.  Now I just hope they keep making it and don&#x27;t discontinue it.  To that end, I have bought up extra bottles since they&#x27;re fairly cheap.  I found mine at Target for $4.99 a bottle.  I am a naturally curly with 3b/c shoulder length hair when curly and 3/4 of the way down my back with straight.</li>
    <li> I was lured in my the awesome rosemary mint scent, and figured for $4 it was worth a shot. No beans. I tried it 3 times, each time it left my hair super tangly and dry feeling, with no shine and flyways all over the place. Luckily, I still love the scent so I&#x27;m using up the rest of my bottle as a shaving cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll stick with my Pantene Nature Fusion line! Lesson learned (again) - don&#x27;t fix what ain&#x27;t broke!</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product and great for the price. It did not dry out my scalp like shampoo does but it also did not leave my hair greasy. I switched to using a natural goat milk soap for my hair, but I definitely plan on putting some of this in a little bottle and using it when I travel. It&#x27;s really convenient, gentle, and just a very nice product.</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo! Best I&#x27;ve ever used. I can&#x27;t find it in the stores anymore and I am so glad I can still find it here on Amazon.</li>
    <li> I love this cleansing conditioner. I am thinking it&#x27;s like the Wen stuff only way cheaper. I threw out all my other shampoos and conditioners because you only need this one item to do both!! It has no parabens, no dyes and no perfumes! Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I confess to being a &amp;#34;wen girl&amp;#34;, but the expense was just getting out of hand. I searched for a while for a replacement and found this. I wish it was a regular and not an add-on item.</li>
    <li> This works just like Wen.  Thank you for making something comparable that is more affordable.</li>
    <li> I just got this a couple days ago. Hint, hint, you can get this much cheaper! Plus use a coupon and then get it super cheap! I got this while out shopping. I wanted to try WEN, but, thought, hmmm...maybe it&#x27;s not for me. I have mid length fine straight blonde to dark hair. Think bleached. It gets very oily after the third to fourth day of washing it. I&#x27;ve used salon graffix I hated it! It stunk so bad! I saw this, I thought maybe it&#x27;s like WEN and I like how it&#x27;s sulfate and paraben free too. I can&#x27;t stand that stuff in my hair products.</li>
    <li> This cleansing conditioner is awesome. Makes your hair clean, soft, and adds all-day volume! Has no sulfates, which is also a big plus!</li>
    <li> This &amp;#34;co-wash&amp;#34; contains the silicone Dimethicone.  This silicone is not water soluble and will need to be washed out with a regular shampoo that if you using the CG will not make your hair happy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s not as &amp;#34;naked&amp;#34; as it claims.</li>
    <li> I bought this, fooled by the name, thinking it would be good for curly hair, kind of like Wen. I didn&#x27;t like this at all. It was difficult to rinse out nothing like Wen.  I guess it might be ok as a conditioner for someone with very dry hair but I thought it was for cleansing the hair.  It contains silicones.  I gave it away.  It wasn&#x27;t worth trying to send it back.  From now on, before I buy anything I am looking at all the one reviews first.  I have wasted so much money on products that don&#x27;t do what they claim to.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m going to compare this product to Renpure Solutions Sweet Pomegranate Cleansing Conditioner, which is my normal product (that I really like - but I wondered if it was time for a change). Short answer: the Renpure Solutions is much better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Herbal Essences is much thicker than the Renpure, but when being rinsed it leaves an oily film in my hair that Renpure does not.The ingredients in the Renpure are nearly all plant based and indicate their origin (such as cetyl alcohol from palm oil), whereas the Herbal Essences does not indicate it origins and does not contain as many natural ingredients. Specifically, the Herbal Essences contains peppermint oil, rosemary oil, and field mint oil. In contrast, the Renpure contains argan oil, red seaweed extract, red algae extract, brown seaweed extract, sunflower seed oil, coconut oil, pomegranate fruit extract, pea protein, guava fruit extract, and shea oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll stick with Renpure.</li>
    <li> Will never use wen again.This bottle itself is amazing the conditioner comes out fast and don&#x27;t feel like i am getting a workout,like I do with wen.The love the smell and how my hair feels after.I hope they make more scents so I can have choices.</li>
    <li> I really wanted to like this stuff---but I just can&#x27;t get past the smell.  I just don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s the stearyl alcohol I&#x27;m smelling--but it&#x27;s a strong chemical smell.. Have to pass on this one.</li>
    <li> Love this conditioner for my super long hair. It gets the knots out and no build up.</li>
    <li> Best thing for my fine hair and have been using this brand for 9 months now, can&#x27;t go back to regular shampoo too rough on my hair</li>
    <li> This smells really nice. It&#x27;s light, herbal, and clean.&lt;br /&gt;I have normal hair/skin (not too oily, not too dry).&lt;br /&gt;By the end of the afternoon at work (I have an office job), my hair is visibly greasy (after using this product in the morning). I thought maybe my hair/scalp just needed to get used to not having a shampoo everyday, but I&#x27;ve gone through 3/4 of the bottle and I still have greasy hair in the afternoon.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve decided to use the rest of the bottle as a regular conditioner after using the Herbal Essences Naked shampoo.</li>
    <li> I am really loving this product and will not go back to using shampoo again. My scalp no longer flakes and my hair has never felt cleaner and healthier! Highly recommend it...</li>
    <li> As you can tell by my rating, I really loved this Cleansing Conditioner.  First and foremost, I love that this cleanser doesn&#x27;t strip my hair.  More than a few cleansers that I have tried have done that, though, supposedly, they are designed to do the opposite.  Second, this product is so affordable and it works great.  Third, it&#x27;s fragrance is subtle, yet still manages to smell very pleasant.  This product contains menthol but it isn&#x27;t overwhelming and this makes Naked Cleansing Conditioner gentle on my scalp and not cause me irritation.  It&#x27;s thick and the pump they provide is more than adequate.  Product goes on smooth, creates a smooshy type froth when you add a bit of water and my hair felt clean and conditioned.  When I rinsed it out, I added a bit more to my ends as a leave-in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve even cleansed my face with it.  It removes light make-up that I wear and makes my face feel clean without feeling tight. Disclaimer: ( I don&#x27;t have acne or suffer other skin conditions. And doing this works for my face). I will buy a separate bottle just for my face and will continue to purchase for my hair.  I am thrilled and this is a great addition to the Herbal Essences line.</li>
    <li> Let me start out by saying that I absolutely love this product. It leaves my hair feeling clean and smelling fresh without damaging it. I am a germaphobe and think that many people smell badly without even realizing it. I shower twice daily (which some may think is excessive) and I realize that washing my hair with drugstore shampoos every day can be extremely damaging. This product truly changed my life. I am now able to wash my hair daily (I feel so much cleaner when I wash my hair and not just my body) without it becoming damaged. For the people reading reviews in an attempt to find a cheaper alternative to Wen, PLEASE try this product. I used Wen for two years and absolutely loved the results - however, I wasn&#x27;t a huge fan of how much money I was spending on my hair each month. My college roommate learned about Herbal Essences Cleansing Conditioner and recommended that I try it. I have now been using this for two years and love it even more than Wen. Some other reviews say that the scent is very strong, and I do agree with this. However, I actually really like the scent and don&#x27;t find it to be a problem - and this is coming from someone who usually hates both strong smells and mint. This cleansing conditioner has a fresh minty scent that stays on your hair all day without interfering with perfumes or body sprays. My boyfriend loves the smell and the fact that my hair is softer than ever while using this cleansing conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All of that being said, I do have a few tips for use that will allow you to get the most out of your cleansing conditioner:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Follow the directions. Herbal Essences says &amp;#34;Massage 3-4 pumps into wet hair.  Let it go to work for a few minutes, then rinse it out.  That&#x27;s it.  Give your regular shampoo and conditioner a break.&amp;#34; However, I would take this a step further. I found that when repeating the wash process and then using half a pump of cleansing conditioner as a leave-in works wonders (as Wen says to do).&lt;br/&gt;-Don&#x27;t use this every day. Because you are essentially washing your hair with conditioner, using this product every day will weigh down your hair and make it look very flat and oily.&lt;br /&gt;-Rinse out very well. Because (as I said above) this product is a conditioner, it is very important to rinse it out very well in order to maintain volume in your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Those are all the tips I have for this awesome product. If you are on the fence about purchasing this product, I absolutely recommend it and would honestly pay a lot more for it. Thank you Herbal Essences for creating a more affordable (but just as amazing) option than Wen!</li>
    <li> Bought based off reviews. Thank you reviewers for saving me a LOT of $$.&lt;br /&gt;Was about to buy the Wen product due to having tried a sample of a leave in conditioning treatment, I picked up at Good Will.&lt;br /&gt;It really had sold me on the Wen products, and was ready to try the cleansing conditioner. Saw the reviews on here and thought...what do I have to lose...$4 and a weeks worth of time if this turns out to not be as good as Wen...why not?&lt;br /&gt;SO glad I bought this instead. Its HEAVENLY.&lt;br /&gt;I have very long, very thick, colored and highlighted hair. Very particular of the performance of a conditioner, as it has to do the job of a miracle worker on my hair. And I only wash my hair about 1-2 times per week due my color. So it really has to work well and quite frankly  if I can&#x27;t pull my fingers through my hair when I put it on my hair in the shower, then I toss it immediately (lessons learned).&lt;br /&gt;On to the actual product review...I promise.&lt;br /&gt;I used 29 pumps of this (lots of thick hair) and pulled through. Immediately easy to pull through and it smelled divine.&lt;br /&gt;Let it sit for 5 minutes and when I was using my fingers to separate during rinse, it was like magic. Silky, untangled, soft.&lt;br /&gt;The real test...the drying phase where I look like I have stuck my finger in a socket. Smooth, dried faster than normal.&lt;br /&gt;Second test...the staying power. Going on 4 days and my hair is STILL soft, silky and not tangled. Nor is it greasy in any way.&lt;br /&gt;I am floored by this product and glad I bought two at once. Really afraid they will run out and I will be screwed...so dont tell too many people this product rocks...ok? Our secret?</li>
    <li> I love this stuff!!! Such a good deal and so good for my hair! Much love! Much product!</li>
    <li> This made my scalp itch.  Nothing beats Hair One or Lisa Rachel.</li>
    <li> Smells okay. Left my hair greasy, oily, and limp. Will not purchase again.</li>
    <li> I purchased a more expensive cleansing conditioner for myself, and purchased this inexpensive product for my daughter who has very healthy hair.  It turned out that this was the better product!  The more costly product was very thin and did nothing for detangling.  This product is, in my opinion, comparable to Wen, yet far less costly.  I still want to use Wen, but I can&#x27;t afford to use it exclusively.  This product is a worthy alternative.</li>
    <li> As for non-shampoo hair wash.  I was not impressed.  It left my hair with a film and just kind of blah.  I am still searching for a good no-shampoo wash, and this was not it.  Save your money.</li>
    <li> Works very well!  Not as good as wen but for the price it is great.</li>
    <li> I love this cleansing conditioner better than Wen. I tried to go back to regular shampoo and conditioner and it just doesn&#x27;t work for me anymore.</li>
    <li> Not quite as good as Wen, but it&#x27;s a lot cheaper than Wen. It dried out my hair a bit, so I have to use it every other wash, or use a deep conditioner with it.</li>
    <li> this is my first week using this product.  As a background, let me say I was using Wen but I thought $30+ per bottle is a little too much, unless you have the money to support this spending.  So my hubby actually told me about bc he saw it at a retail store.  I love that the product scent stays in the whole day (wen goes away after a while), it really doesn&#x27;t smell much like mint but like rosemary, and I love this scent.  My hair dries faster too, with Wen was the same, something about cleansing conditioners, I haven&#x27;t figure that one out yet.  Just to keep my scalp from not greasing up, bc this kind of products do this to me, I still have to wash with regular shampoo at least once a week, but I also bought and am using the new herbal essences Naked Moisture Shampoo, which also has a great smell.  I&#x27;ll keep using this, bc it doesn&#x27;t hurt my wallet and I like how it works.</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome! Having used Herbal Essences in the past, I knew it would smell good, but I was really impressed by the quality of the actual cleansing/conditioning it offers. After years of wanting to try WEN, I finally bit the bullet and bought a trial pack last summer. I loved everything about it except the price, especially because I&#x27;m on a new baby budget. After searching for alternatives online, I happened upon this and got excited to try it. My friend and I both have mid-back length, thick, wavy/curly hair, and we both tried this after having used WEN for awhile...and we both love it just as much! I use a little more than the directions call for (I use about 7 pumps instead of 3-4), and I follow up up with a half-pump &amp;#34;leave in conditioner&amp;#34; after rinsing (just like WEN), but other than that I use as directed, and my hair feels clean, soft, and smooth for 2 days between uses :) I highly recommend this to anyone who has been using WEN or wanting to use it, but just can&#x27;t afford the price tag.</li>
    <li> I purchased this yesterday at Wally World. I&#x27;ve used WEN before, but as I have fine, thin hair, it left my hair looking lifeless. Shampooing my hair leaves it dry, so I started just putting conditioner in, then rinsing. This worked okay, but not as well as I wanted. I saw this in the store, and it was only $4.97, so I decided to give it a try. I didn&#x27;t use as many pumps as it said because I didn&#x27;t need to. I think you should adjust this amount as needed for your own hair type. It is wonderful! My hair has body, shine, and isn&#x27;t dried out! Thank you Herbal Essences for saving my hair :)</li>
    <li> My sister in-law gave me Wen as a gift and it worked wonders for my thick, often unmanageable hair.  Wen&#x27;s price however, did not work wonders for my pocket book, so I went on an expedition for an alternative.  I tried EverPure by Loreal and it turned my hair into a festival of frizz.  I read about mixing one part normal shampoo to 3 parts conditioner and tried that with sub-par results at best.  I just happened to notice Herbal Essences Naked Cleansing Conditioner on the shelf at my local store and gave it a try.  It works awesome!  I get the same soft, smooth, manageable hair that Wen gave me, only it&#x27;s a fraction of the price.  Thanks Herbal Essences for making a great product that&#x27;s affordable and really works!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in my mid-40&#x27;s and have noticed my scalp has become drier with age.  My scalp was itching and flaking all the time.  I tried many types of dandruff shampoos without success.  I finally talked to my dermatologist and she explained that as we age our scalp and skin in general becomes drier.  She made recommendations and I made changes.  This product does not have sulfate so it does not lather like shampoos I have used in the past.  However, after the first wash I noticed my scalp didn&#x27;t itch as much.  I wash my hair every other day and it took about a week before my scalp stopped flaking (I think it just took time for the old skin to come off).  I&#x27;m not sure if it was the &amp;#34;sulfate free&amp;#34;, the &amp;#34;conditioner&amp;#34; like shampoo, or a combination of both that worked for me.</li>
    <li> I finally found this I had been using salon grafix cleansing condittioner which can make your hair slightly heavy but it is still better than shampoo I also found ren pure to be not good at all so today I tried this and my hair looks and feels great I must coment on the air drying time is much less than salon grafix which to a few hours anyone who needs a cleansing conditioner at a good price should try this</li>
    <li> leaves hair greasy and doesn&#x27;t rinse well.</li>
    <li> Best product.  LOVE IT, so easy to take care of my hair.</li>
    <li> Let me start by saying I am not a Wen girl. I always wanted to try it, but was unwilling to pay 30 a month for cleansing conditioner. I did some research and purchased this based on all the Wen converts who reviewed it. I am a review junky so I had no hesitation in ordering it. However, I am also a bit of a risk taker given the reviews that said that it wasn&#x27;t for fine hair. I have incredibly fine straight hair that falls to the bottom of my shoulder blades. Some of the other reviews on this said it wouldn&#x27;t be good for my hair type. However, Wen claimed to be for all hair types so if this was a competitor, then it should be as well. This is my first experience with any type of cleansing conditioner so I didn&#x27;t really know what to expect. It comes out feeling like conditioner ( no duh right ) and doesn&#x27;t lather at all. The instructions say to use 3 to 4 pumps and wait a few minutes to rinse. If you pump it out slow, that&#x27;s true, but if not you end up using 8.I left it in the whole course of my shower ( 10 mins) . It was incredibly hard to rinse out of my hair. It took a few minutes to completely wash it out and I was still afraid my hair was going to dry oily. To my surprise, my hair felt so soft and even had more body. I think is is going to be my pick for life. And as an afterthought, it doesn&#x27;t have a strong smell. It reminds me a great deal of the stuff they use in my salon.</li>
    <li> I love this product. I have very fine colored treated shoulder length hair. It cleanses and conditions without weighing my hair down or leaving it feeling greasy. Highly recommend for anyone straying away from shampooing. I recently was using the Loreal cleansing cream, I prefer the Herbal Essence over the Loreal version, it&#x27;s more product for you dollar and the scent is amazing. Love it, buying more today.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t care for this product.  I have dry, curly, &amp; frizzy hair and I ordered this because of an article I read.  It didn&#x27;t seem to help any of my issues and just made my already thick hair seem thicker and more unruly.</li>
    <li> Posted as Kathy Peterson</li>
    <li> I really love this stuff - I use it every few days instead of shampoo. Helps keep my hair soft and is totally affordable. Smells fresh.</li>
    <li> This is such a good deal for a cleansing conditioner. My husband and 3 boys love the scent and ease of use. Their hair is clean and soft with minimal effort!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! I am a black woman with type 4a/b natural hair that is medium thickness. I was skeptical about trying this product because it isn&#x27;t necessarily marketed to black people and I have tried other cleansing conditioners without success. However, this product is great! I used more than the 3-4 pumps because my hair is pretty long. I left it on for 3-4 minutes in the shower and when I rinsed my hair was super soft and detangling was a breeze! It left my scalp feeling clean but not too dry. I purchased mine at a store called And That for $3.99. I wouldn&#x27;t suggest buying it on Amazon unless you can&#x27;t find it in your area. This product is always cheaper in stores. I love it and will continue to purchase it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried several other cleansing conditioners and I found that this one doesn&#x27;t weigh hair down. I have shoulder length thin hair, which has to be washed every day, so I use this conditioner in between shampoos to keep it from drying out. The hair is left quite voluminous and clean the next day, but it has to be washed the day after. The only con with this conditioner is that is smells incredibly strong, even after you wash it out. My hair is left smelling strongly of the conditioner even after I dry it, although the smell is not bad, it is rather overpowering. I would like to see them use less perfumes in this, otherwise good product.</li>
    <li> Great product and arrived ahead of expected date.</li>
    <li> This is my 2nd bottle ordered. I like using it. I found that for my fine hair I don&#x27;t need to use much and it leaves my hair looking healthy.</li>
    <li> leaves my hair with a film and does not leave it very clean or soft.</li>
    <li> I have long mid-back length hair, thick, and mostly straight with a wavy tendency during the summer. My scalp likes to be cleaned daily, but my hair doesn&#x27;t. I like to shower everyday and sometimes twice in the summer or when I&#x27;m working out a lot, but I don&#x27;t like to wash my hair every time I shower. I keep this product in the mix of 3-4 shampoo/conditioner options I use all the time. (Others right now are Head &amp; Shoulders 2-in-1 and Organix Keratin Shampoo and Conditioner.) I love how clean it makes my hair feel without having to use the two-step process, but I also love that it gives all the moisture to my dry ends that I expect from a deep conditioner. It&#x27;s really the opposite of a 2-in-1 shampoo-and-conditioner-- more on the conditioner side than shampoo. I would probably not use this exclusively, as it would cause buildup, but I would really not use any product exclusively. This is a perfect answer for when I need to take a quick shower but still need to come out with clean, moisturized hair. Rave.</li>
    <li> This product is a good cleansing conditioner and the recommended 3 to 4 pumps is quite enough and will make this product last you a while unlike Wen. This also has a bit more product than Wen. Left my hair soft and manageable.&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is that it is an add-on item when it could be sold by itself.</li>
    <li> This is wonderful, cannot find it in my local stores, so I will be ordering again!</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t spend so much on this here, not worth it. You can get the same bottle for $5 at a Target or a Wal-Mart. It&#x27;s an OK product; it could be better. I&#x27;ve also tried Wen and Pantene cleansing conditioners. The Pantene one is the best of the all three. All can be found at a fraction of the price at Target. Not sure why the price is too high here at Amazon.</li>
    <li> Cleansing conditioners are the perfect solution for my hair dilemma. I have fine Asian hair that requires daily washing or it will gets limp and greasy close to the roots causing pimples and sores on my scalp. But daily washing with shampoo and conditioner not only striped my hair of natural oils it also irritated my scalp.  So I tried several different methods to circumvent having to wash my hair daily, including dry shampoo, no poo, and found cleansing conditioners to work the best.  It feels the cleanest and leaves my hair soft and my scalp healthy. Now I use this product daily and only shampoo once a week or every 10 days to really clean my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried 2 different cleansing conditioners and found this one to be the better one so far. I like the thicker texture of it, which makes it easier for me to rub it into my scalp to get a good cleaning. It also smells amazing (a tad strong at first).  The herbal essence cleansing conditioner also doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down like the other product I tried.  It is also one of the better priced cleansing conditioner out there.</li>
    <li> As someone with wavy/curly hair, my hair is perpetually dry, even when I keep conditioner on all day (as a leave-in product, inspired by the DevaCurl methods). This bottle changed EVERYTHING. My hair is suddenly super soft! I can wash my hair every day after my workouts and my hair just keeps getting softer, not drier. This definitely changed my life. Thank you for existing!! Free of sulfate!</li>
    <li> Love the soft minty smell and the fact that it is gentle on my hair. Great buy!!</li>
    <li> FAN-TASTIC!!  Have curly cork-screw curls and did not know if this would work for me since it has the ignoble \\&quot;cones\\&quot; in it, whereas I usually stick to an all-natural hair care regimen as closely as possible when not straightening my hair.  The slip was phenomenal in this conditioning cleanser.  And after I went to style it with my Kiss my face upper management gel with a little grape seed oil my curls were out-of-this world springy, shiny and popping!!!    One caveat:  Because this product has the dreaded \\&quot;cones\\&quot; I made sure to do an apple-cider vinegar rinse before washing out completely. (I do this anyway even with the more organic/natural product hair care lines).  I&#x27;ve tried WEN and it&#x27;s good but for the price, HENCC takes 5 stars and WEN will get knocked down to 3.  It also gets knocked down because it&#x27;s difficult to come by whereas this product you can easily purchase at your local drugstore or Target.    I am surprisingly thrilled and delighted with this product!  I hope HE comes out with other fragrances for this line - e.g., hibiscus,  green tea, etc.    This cleansing conditioner is a keeper, CLAIROL!  Stick with it and you will have a loyal following for years to come.</li>
    <li> This stuff is just ok. I&#x27;ve used much better cleansing conditioners. I had used a salon grafix one in the past and decided to try this based on the high reviews but I found I prefer the salon grafix. It is better than most normal shampoos and conditioners. The scent kind of bugged me, I thought I&#x27;d like it but wasn&#x27;t that fond of it. This stuff isn&#x27;t bad but it&#x27;s not great either. Didn&#x27;t really do a lot for my hair. It didn&#x27;t make it terrible but also didn&#x27;t make it shinier, softer etc. like some other cleansing conditioners have. I won&#x27;t be repurchasing this one.</li>
    <li> I have been using win for year on my way after menopause hair which is dry and brittle but this is better than women and a whole lot cheaper I love it I ordered two more bottles</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Loreal conditioning cleanser for about a year and it made my hair incredibly soft and manageable. I&#x27;m bi-racial and have thick curly hair that I flat iron. I bought this because there is more product, and I have so much hair I was going through the Loreal cleanser too quickly. This is really not comparable. I don&#x27;t think it actually cleanses. I do olive oil masks on my hair and the Loreal cleanser washed out all traces of it, but this barely does anything. After so many, &amp;#34;washes,&amp;#34; with it I feel like it gets built up in my hair, and it makes my hair waxy, not soft. It&#x27;s really more of a conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will say that I continue buying it because I&#x27;ve discovered that it is the best shaving cream I&#x27;ve ever used, it lasts forever, and I no longer buy shaving cream for my legs.</li>
    <li> I read through the ingredients and thought &amp;#34;Wow, that&#x27;s going to smell great, and be so good for my hair; paraben-free and everything ...!&amp;#34; but somehow I missed the &amp;#34;fragrance&amp;#34; part.  This should smell good.  No, it should smell great - rosemary and peppermint essential oils?!  It should be good for your hair AND be like a spa treatment in your shower!  Instead, it smells like .... stale old-lady perfume.  Never mind that it also takes about a handful to effectively cleanse shoulder-length hair.  Will not be buying this again, and would love a refund, if I can ever find a way to contact the owner.</li>
    <li> It is not as moisturizing as I expected.  Other reviewers have complained about the scent, which bothers me, too.  It reminds me of cedar or sage and gives me a headache.</li>
    <li> Yes, yes finally! MY 5 yr old has Extremely Thick, Very long( hangs past mid-back when wet, past her waist when straightened dry) CURLY HAIR!  When a babe just olive oil &amp; aloe gel, wrap the hair around my finger, done.....&lt;br /&gt;Now the hair is just so much: follicle is cylinder &amp; shiny, coarse, curl pattern is cork screw to s-shape in the top... Nothing really penetrates the full on mass of hair... I tried natural &amp; blah, blah that... IT&#x27;S miserable for her b/c she DESPISES HAVING ANYTHING DONE to that Victorian looking head of hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;:-) Now this, I can wet her hair and add essence &amp; IT PENETRATES THE HAIR :-)&lt;br /&gt;Shingle most of the hair with my finger. WOW! Her hair &amp; scalp are clean in less time &amp; the hair is DETANGLED..... Now looking for a not-so chemical laden conditioner to maker course shiney hair feel Soft( also water here is more hard)</li>
    <li> Smells great and I use it every other day with my daily shampoo</li>
    <li> I use this instead of shampoo and conditioner about 5 days per week. I shampoo and condition the other two days. Keeps my hair healthier than shampooing every day and works better than &#x27;washing&#x27; with conditioner, which is what I was doing.</li>
    <li> This is not At all the quality you get from wen. Was looking for an affordable substitute for wen and have always trusted the herbal essence line, but this leaves a lot to be desired. I have to wash my hair twice as much and use much more of this to get less positive a result. It&#x27;s not horrible, but I&#x27;m disappointed, esp since i bought 5 bottles. lesson learned.</li>
    <li> This seemed to work well the first few days. Then I noticed my hair getting greasier at the roots daily until, after about day 6, it was greasy after blowing it dry. Maybe you&#x27;re not supposed to use it daily? Maybe use it a couple of days then use normal shampoo? I don&#x27;t know. I&#x27;ve used other brands and there are a couple I could use daily without this issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was so hopeful because of the price!</li>
    <li> I know, it&#x27;s a shampoo, you&#x27;re not supposed to put it in your eyes. I didn&#x27;t! Every time I used this cleanser, my eyes were extremely dry the rest of the day, to the point that it interfered with my work. This has never happened before and the only thing that changed was using this cleanser, so I&#x27;m convinced that small amounts in my eyes from the morning shower were responsible.&lt;br /&gt;That said, my wife loves this stuff and hasn&#x27;t had any of the problems I did with it, so it gets two stars.</li>
    <li> This is pretty decent cleansing conditioner if you are shopping on a budget.  I think it is a little drying, and eventually (after using it for a week or two) it seems to make your hair start to produce more oil to compensate, but overall a pretty decent co-wash.</li>
    <li> Who knew! There I was walking along, minding my own business and I noticed this new herbal essence conditioner. First of all I love herbal essence but I am a recovering product junkie, so I really did try to resist (not really).  I decided to give this a try as a new co-wash conditioner for my kinky 4a/b hair. I LOVE IT!  It works great as a clarifying conditioner, but it also conditions VERY well - no follow-up conditioning needed after clarifying!  It smells great and makes my hair super soft and really makes my curls pop!  It is excellent for a wash and go or simply as a co-washing conditioner.</li>
    <li> I love, love, love this. It is absolutely wonderful on my natural hair. It is keeps my hair soft and it was not expensive. It cleans my hair well and when I come out the shower my hair is  shiny. I recommend this as a cowash.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. Works just as good as my expensive devachan stuff.</li>
    <li> Works decent and a much better value than wen. I hope they do other ones like tea tree etc</li>
    <li> I have grey wiry hair and this makes it smooth and soft!</li>
    <li> Used this cleansing conditioner a few times.  It was just okay.  After a few times, I gave up on it.  My hair seemed to be getting dryer, not softer, so I&#x27;m thinking it just doesn&#x27;t work for color-treated hair that is also fine.</li>
    <li> I find this to be a great economical choice for cleansing conditioner. And it smells great! I have thick curly hair that is also quite damaged from coloring, etc. so it&#x27;s nice to have something that is conditioning but doesn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling greasy. I have found this to be the best blend of not stripping my hair of too many natural oils, but also not leaving so much that I don&#x27;t feel clean. This does a great job at leaving me feeling clean but feeling smooth and easy to detangle outside of the shower.</li>
    <li> This smells really nice.</li>
    <li> This cleansing conditioner works really well. My hair feels so much softer but I have to agree with the other reviews about the smell. It&#x27;s pretty strong, I think it would be so much better if the smell was just a little bit lighter in fragrance.  This issue isn&#x27;t a breaking point for me though because I think this product will be great to have once winter starts.</li>
    <li> I really wanted to like this because I&#x27;ve been looking for something to use between shampoos when I need to actually wash/rinse my hair but don&#x27;t want to use shampoo. Unfortunately this stuff didn&#x27;t work for me. I have thick, dry hair and figured this would be perfect, but while the ends of my hair were fine, it made the roots of my hair extremely flat. Like stuck to my head flat. And even using hairspray and teasing it didn&#x27;t do much to fix it. The second time I used it I even used less than before, thinking that maybe I used too much, and kept it off my roots,  but my hair was still flat. It&#x27;s pretty cheap though and smells good, so I recommend trying it if you&#x27;re looking for a cleansing conditioner. Also you get a lot in one bottle.</li>
    <li> Before trying this product, I had been using Wen for about 2 years and swore I would never change.  However, as expenses started to rise in other areas of my life, I knew that shampoo (err.. cleansing conditioner) was one area that I could cut back on so I went on the search for a less expensive alternative and found herbal essences cleansing conditioner!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, what I like/love:  The price!!!! As anyone who has ever purchased Wen or even looked in to it knows, this product goes for a great price and is what initially drew me in!  Once out of the shower, my hair is very soft and clean.  I wash my hair every single day (always have, probably always will no matter the product) and this product does not dry it out at all and leaves my long, curly hair looking wonderful (which anyone with curly hair knows isn&#x27;t always as easy as it seems).  I also use the naked mousse which keeps my curls from frizzing but isn&#x27;t crunchy.  As, for the smell which seems to be a hot topic in other reviews, I don&#x27;t mind it all and actually like it!  I am someone who is very sensitive to scents and I find this one very pleasant.  People say it sticks around all day and I agree it does, but so did the Wen scents so I think that is common in cleansing conditioners.  I have had friends and strangers compliment me on the smell of my hair so even though this is a personal preference thing, it works for me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I don&#x27;t like as much:  While I&#x27;m in the shower, the product doesn&#x27;t work through my hair as easily as I would like.  It definitely doesn&#x27;t come across as a conditioner in the shower and I feel this causes me to use more product than I may actually need.  I don&#x27;t know if this is something that could be fixed over time but regardless, it wouldn&#x27;t cause me to stop using this product.  Also, even though I really do like the scent, I wish there were a couple to choose from to mix it up sometimes.  Hopefully as this product gains popularity, Herbal Essence will expand the line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, the pros definitely outweigh the cons and I recommend this product!ine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, the pros definitely outweigh the cons and I recommend this product!</li>
    <li> This stuff is great! It smells good and it really cleans my hair. I do have to use it everyday or I get greasy. It leaves my curly hair feeling soft and it doesn&#x27;t weigh it down. I have never used Wen products but I have used other cleansing conditioners and this one is the best.</li>
    <li> This is the first cleansing conditioner I tried. I love it for the most part other than the smell is a bit strong. Also, I will say that I use a separate conditioner (Joico Moisture Recovery) on my ends to keep it from getting too tangly and dry.  I have very fine greasy hair so I was worried it would weigh my hair down and leave it looking greasy but it didn&#x27;t at all. I don&#x27;t feel like it volumizes necessarily but it doesn&#x27;t make my hair weighed down either.  I usually can go 2-3 days between washes with the use of dry shampoo which is amazing for me because usually my hair looks super greasy just by the end of the day. The only reason I&#x27;m giving it 4 stars instead of 5 is because I can&#x27;t find it anywhere anymore and I haven&#x27;t found one good enough to replace it yet.</li>
    <li> Bought this along with the shampoo and its great definitey will re purchase!</li>
    <li> Also use as shaving cream!</li>
    <li> Like the way it works, but the scent/smell is overwhelming and gross. I thought since it was Herbal Essences it would have a wonderful smell, but instead it smells like a mix of flowers and old people.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always been fascinated by the concept of the Wen cleansing conditioner, but WOW at the price!  I had tried other products from the &amp;#34;Naked&amp;#34; line of products from Herbal Essences so when I saw this cleansing conditioner, I knew I had to try it (and at this price, what&#x27;s the risk?!?!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First impression - love it!  I had to get past my fear of the unknown tho.  Seriously, you can WASH your hair with conditioner?  Guess what?  Yes you can.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I like:  It makes shower time SIMPLE and FAST!  Everything you need to do to your hair is done with this one product.  That&#x27;s a big win in my book.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Personally, I really like the smell... it has a fresh scent and yes, it lasts a long time. I wouldn&#x27;t say I have an over-sensitive sense of smell, but it&#x27;s pretty active - this scent doesn&#x27;t bother me at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I don&#x27;t like:  While I have a lot of hair strands that give the impression of thick hair, each individual hair strand is very fine and thin.  Too much ANYTHING and my hair goes flat-ola.  I really can&#x27;t use this cleansing conditioner every day or else my hair will just be... &amp;#34;limp&amp;#34; and just blah.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, when I rotate between this and my other normal shampoo or use this as the second step of a &amp;#34;Lather, Rinse, Repeat&amp;#34; normal shampoo (use it like a conditioner), it&#x27;s awesome!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom Line:  If you&#x27;ve ever wondered about the whole &amp;#34;Wen&amp;#34; thing, you simply have to try this cleansing conditioner first.  The price is too good to NOT try it.</li>
    <li> I had been wanting to try Wen for a while but could never justify the cost. I saw this at my local Target and for such a great price, thought why not?&lt;br /&gt;Well it smells really nice, the mint isn&#x27;t overpowering to me. It makes your hair smell nice and clean all day. I tend to get oily hair, so was concerned with that, but if I put enough in and rub it into my scalp(especially along my hair line) I haven&#x27;t had an issue. My hair is bery fine and I have a ton of it, so tangles are something I am forever battling. This took care of the tangles really nicely, and leaves my hair soft and manageable. I also use it on my daughters hair. She has very wavy and dry hair. And this makes it nice and soft.</li>
    <li> This is my new go to. Granted I was skeptical because it was Herbal Essences and not Salon brand but holy crap. I call dibs on a new cult favorite!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now if you guys can make this in that yummy violet &#x27;Tousle me Softly&#x27; smell then I say winner winner chicken dinner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Usually it is not that I have a problem with Herbal Essences, it&#x27;s my hair that has expensive tastes. I just can&#x27;t take her anywhere. She always wants top shelf! blah blah blah. Anyone with picky walk like Egyptian type hair will know my woes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With this product I can wash and wear and not have a massive hair meltdown. I&#x27;m happy!</li>
    <li> I love the scent and the consistency of this product. The smell reminds me of laundry detergent, which may sound weird as a hair product, but it&#x27;s great. Herbal Essences never gets it wrong with scents in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;ve never used a cleansing conditioner before, you may be put out when this product doesn&#x27;t start foaming up to spread it around your scalp. It does require a bit more work to spread it around, but I&#x27;ve found that if I just stick my head under the water for a split second after distributing the product through my wet hair, it makes it much easier to work it around. I rinse and follow up with L&#x27;Oreal Advanced Total Repair 5 conditioner just in the length of my hair where I usually put conditioner after shampooing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is down past the middle of my back, thick, naturally wavy, and not color treated. It tends to feel heavy and looks like I belong in an 80s hair metal band if I let it air dry. This conditioner makes it so light and soft, and helps to tame my waves and make them look smooth and frizz free. My scalp is not at all irritated (it tends to get dry and super itchy in the harsh Cleveland winter weather). Today is Friday and I last shampooed my hair on Tuesday. It doesn&#x27;t feel at all weighed down or greasy. I plan on shampooing my hair once a week, then using this every other day. I do not recommend using this as your sole method of cleaning your hair at all times. You will need a day each week or so (depending on how many styling products you use) to shampoo and remove any built up styling product residue that this product simply cannot clean out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to note that I have cleaned my hair with conditioner before, and just used a cheap normal conditioner (not a \\&quot;cleansing\\&quot; conditioner). It&#x27;s the same thing. Just marketing hoopla to make you think that you have to buy a specific new product if you want to clean your hair with something other than shampoo. If you already have a ton of conditioners and aren&#x27;tcompletely ready to buy another one but really want to try a Wen type of cleanser, just try using your regular conditioner. If you are a product junkie like I am, get it. You&#x27;ll love it!</li>
    <li> I have never tried  Cleansing Conditioner before this one, so I don&#x27;t have anything to compare it to.  However, I can say that I REALLY like this product.  I have long wavy hair with medium texture.  I have to use 10-12 pumps of this product to really feel like it is cleaning my hair.  I don&#x27;t know whether this is due to the length or texture of my hair, or if I just feel I need this much for my hair to feel clean.  In the shower, I section my hair into small sections and work the conditioner through each section.  Once I have cleaned each individual section, I work the conditioner through all my hair with a bit of water.  I leave on throughout my shower (10 minutes). It does take longer than traditional shampoo and conditioner.  However, my hair is super soft, much more manageable and much less frizzy when I use the Cleansing Conditioner. I was really concerned about my hair not feeling clean using only a conditioner, but I have not found this to be the case at all.  It feels super clean and not greasy at all.  Just really soft and conditioned.  I have also noticed that my hair color is not fading as fast using this as with normal shampoo and conditioner.  I will note that I do not use this product exclusively, due to the increased time required for my hair to feel clean.  I replace my normal shampoo and conditioner with this product 2 to 3 times per week.  I will definitely continue to use it!</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing!!!! I just tried it for the first time and my hair feels absolutely soft, bouncy and clean! I know that there is dimethicone in it. But honestly....I can live with it since my hair was doing just fine with normal conditioning shampoos and conditioners before I started co-washing and losing my hair. Maybe I was using the wrong brand for me, but up until an hour ago...I love my hair!</li>
    <li> smells nice and work great</li>
    <li> I love everything about this product!  I love that it isn&#x27;t stripping my hair of natural oils.  I love the feel of it.  I love the smell of it.  And, especially love the cost of it compared to similar products like WEN.  This works just as well (maybe better).  I will continue to buy - and recommend - Herbal Essences Naked Cleansing Conditioner.</li>
    <li> Smells great but not overpowering..definitely as good as WEN as far as im concerned..hair is soft and not weighted down</li>
    <li> Worked as good as Pantene version for me.  Beats the Wen price any day.  Very happy.</li>
    <li> I admit, I&#x27;ve only used this about 4 times.  But that is with me washing my hair twice a week - once a week with this and the other wash is with a natural shampoo bar  (http://smile.amazon.com/J-R-Liggetts-Jojoba-Peppermint-Shampoo/dp/B001W2K51O/ref&#x3D;sr_1_2?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1396345483&amp;sr&#x3D;8-2&amp;keywords&#x3D;shampoo+bar) mid-week.  My hair is AWESOME.  I have naturally good hair as far as oiliness or dryness goes.  But to get a smooth and super soft finish I always needed to use conditioner.  I have smooth, soft hair AND some added body now without conditioner.  Even after skipping washes so often.  I&#x27;ve never tried WEN, and I&#x27;ve wanted to but it&#x27;s pretty cost prohibitive.  I don&#x27;t think I even need to now!  Plus it smells great.</li>
    <li> Loveeeeee the fresh smell that lingers for several hours.  Love the feel.  It is awesome and I will be buying more !</li>
    <li> Much better than Wen!!!  Much cheaper than Wen!  I&#x27;m sold!</li>
    <li> I have only used this a few times. I was excited to try it as other reviewers compared it to Wen, and I&#x27;ve heard good things about Wen. I can&#x27;t tell you about how it works with long-term use, but it worked fine the few times I did use.it. My issue with it is the scent. It is a VERY strong scent, and smells like it&#x27;s for men. One time I almost took another shower to wash my hair with my regular shampoo/conditioner because I couldn&#x27;t stand the smell of my hair after being out of the shower for awhile. I would try it again if they came out with a citrus or sweeter scent. Or unscented. But for now I will find someone to give it to who doesn&#x27;t mind the scent.</li>
    <li> It took a few times to get use to no suds or lather.  But this makes my hair super soft.  I use it a few times a week.  I love the smell.  Minty with a touch of tropical.</li>
    <li> i like this and it&#x27;s much cheaper than WEN products.</li>
    <li> I loved this stuff the first few times I used it. It contains dimethicone which is a silicone regular conditioners use. As a co washing conditioner this would be ok if you still shampoo once or twice a week and use this to prolong shampooing.  But I co wash without using shampoo so I need to use a silicone free conditioner to cleanse or else I will need to remove the residue occasionally with a shampoo which defeats the purpose for me. It was nice because it contains a small amount of peppermint but it wasn&#x27;t fitting for my needs. I would however recommend this to someone simply stretching washes and is looking for something to keep them clean in between without stripping their hair. Remember this is used in place of shampoo so you must massage this into your scalp as you would shampoo.  If you simply smooth it onto your hair and roots you will end up greasy! Takes some getting used to but look into the ingredients in those sulfate filled shampoos and you&#x27;ll see why people stop using it.</li>
    <li> I have dry, curly hair and an oily scalpt. It&#x27;s hard to deal with dry hair and an oil scalp. so I have been experimenting with several conditional cleansers this past year. Among the products I&#x27;ve tried are two salon (higher-end) lines: Deva Curls and Jessicurl. I wasn&#x27;t fully statisfied with the shampoo in either line. My hair still felt dry after shampooing and required a separate conditioner. My hair tended to develop snarls. And, by the end of Day 1, my scalp and roots were oily. I like to shampoo every other day, but couldn&#x27;t make it past Day 1 with Jessicurl and Deva Curls. After reading some reviews here on Amazon and in various beauty blogs, I decided to try Herbal Essences Naked Cleansing Conditioner. For this low price, how could I lose? I fell in love with the product on the first use. It leaves my hair soft and clean, without that greasy feeling. And I don&#x27;t need a separate conditioner! My roots aren&#x27;t oily after 24 hours, either. The only caveat I have about is product is that it does contain dimethicone--a silicone that builds up on your hair. When dimethicone builds up, your hair will feel a bit slimy even after you wash it, and the buildup can weigh down your hair. So it&#x27;s a good idea to use a clarifying shampoo once every week or two to remove any buildup. Other than that, I&#x27;m a happy customer and will keep using this product.</li>
    <li> It does not work to well for me,my hair is flat no body at all,I was looking for a way to cut cost of wen but this was not the way to go for me ,but every one different so it&#x27;s cheap enough to try it</li>
    <li> I also think that this is better than Wen. I think it moisturizes better, making my very long hair easy to comb after washing. I couldn&#x27;t comb my hair after using Wen, and often had to reach for conditioner afterwards. The Herbal Essences is thick and actually &amp;#34;lathers&amp;#34; up in my hair (not sure if that&#x27;s the best word for it) better than Wen. A few pumps of the Herbal Essences goes a long way. The Wen takes a good 20 pumps before my hair feels evenly coated. My hair actually feels cleaner with this cleanser and it smells great...the great smelling hair is something that I missed while using Wen. The only thing about this one is that my hair doesn&#x27;t feel clean for more than a couple of days. Which is still better than Wen because my hair never felt quite clean with that at all. This one also doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down like Wen does. And the price? It&#x27;s the cherry on top for Herbal Essences as you get a really decent sized bottle for around $5. You get much less with Wen and it&#x27;s somewhere around $30. I use regular shampoo a couple of times a week in between using this cleansing conditioner and it has been great. Also it makes for morning showers/shampoos so much quicker!</li>
    <li> After using WEN for several weeks, I decided I didn&#x27;t really care for the scent of the product. It worked pretty well for my hair type, though, so I wanted to find a different cleansing conditioner. (I typically have dry, naturally wavy hair that needs several products to tame it.) I checked in a few local stores but wasn&#x27;t able to find any cleansing conditioners, so when I found product I thought I&#x27;d give it a try. I have to say I LOVE the scent and it works just as well as the WEN products. My hair loves it! If you&#x27;re looking for a good cleansing conditioner, give this one a try!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a side note - I will use the cleansing conditioner for 3-4 days in a row, and then use a normal shampoo and conditioner to change it up. It seemed to help my hair not feel gunky or greasy.(Which it only did if I used the cleansing conditioner exclusively non-stop.)</li>
    <li> Almost as great as Wen...for a fraction of the cost!!!</li>
    <li> I mainly use the Loreal Evercreme cleansing conditioner in the gold bottle, but wanted to try this when it came out. No stores around me had it so I bought it here on Amazon. The consistency of this Herbal Essences conditioner is way nicer than the Loreal; it feels thick in the hair and squishy... no other way to describe it. It feels like you&#x27;re really getting your hair clean. It also leaves a nice slip through the hair. Loreal pretty much disappears as soon as you rub it into your hair, thereby making you use more product. It also gets the hair clean, and leaves the quality of my hair in amazing condition, even if my scalp doesn&#x27;t smell minty. This Herbal Essences leaves everything feeling clean and smelling minty, but the quality of my hair was not good. It did nothing for my hair. I prefer the Loreal. For the record my hair is fine, 3B/3C curly, armpit length, and color treated.</li>
    <li> I like the idea behind cleansing conditioners, because I feel like they free up time in the shower. I was weirded out at first, before I tried any product, but I do like experimenting with my hair, so I tried Hair One from Sally Beauty Supply. The Color Treated Hair formula worked well, but the &amp;#34;Normal&amp;#34; hair formula didn&#x27;t, so I jumped off the Cleansing Conditioner train.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Until I saw that HE made it when I was at Walgreens yesterday. I liked the price, and the smell, so I opted to give it a whirl. If It didn&#x27;t work out, I&#x27;d only spent about $4. I fell in love with the smell, it was light and fresh, and I was able to easily work it through my super thick hair with just a little added water (I did you about 10 pumps total for my hair, but it&#x27;s REALLY thick!). When I rinsed it out, my hair didn&#x27;t feel particularly conditioned, but I was able to comb out the bad knots relatively easily, which was an added benefit. When my hair dried, I noticed it was a lot shinier, which was fabulous. I didn&#x27;t add product to my hair, because I wanted to see what it would do to my hair, au natural. Definitely wavy, but I have hair that needs product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;ll keep using this product. I like that it&#x27;s a reasonably priced alternative to a great product.</li>
    <li> I was washing my hair every other day, but wanted to go a little bit longer without shampoo touching it. This gets me exactly one more day, which is why the four stars, I had higher hopes. My hair feels nice, looks smooth, and the scent which some others are complaining about is neither offensive to me nor more overwhelming than other shampoos and conditioners tend to be. I do appreciate that one extra day even if it isn&#x27;t the two (at least) I was hoping for. If I use this two days in a row my hair looks greasy at the roots, although the rest looks nice, so it&#x27;s one day and then shampoo. Note: I do not tend to use any product whatsoever on my hair, on the days that I do I will shampoo the next day, I agree with others that based on my results this is unlikely to yield clean looking hair if I try and use it the day after a smoothing serum or some other heavy product.</li>
    <li> Ok, so I&#x27;m a guy trying to grow out my hair to shoulder length, and I&#x27;m in the middle stage where for it to look even halfway decent, I have to slick it back with hair gel every day. But every morning I have to use shampoo to get the hair gel out, and shampoo always makes it feel very dry and brittle, and makes it way more frizzy than it always is anyway, even after using conditioner. Well, this product is perfect, it gets out the hair gel, and doesn&#x27;t strip it and dry it out. And best of all, it doesn&#x27;t smell all girly and flowery, like most hair products do these days. It still smells good, just in a very gender neutral way.</li>
    <li> I have to be honest, I am a WEN user, have been for quite a while and I love everything about it but the price.  So when I saw this and read the glowing reviews I decided to give it a try.  I picked it up at Target for 5.00 and used it like my WEN.  One ounce of product, worked into really wet hair, then massaged into the scalp which is the source of oils and such, finally working into the ends, and finishing with a two minute rinse.  I did not notice a mint scent at all.  But what scent was there was strong and medicinal and hung around like a cloud.  It even disturbed my sleep.  I used the product again thinking it may have been my imagination.  Nope.  Branching out I asked a friend to &amp;#34;test drive&amp;#34; a WEN like product because she was thinking about trying WEN but was concerned about the price.  I said nothing about any after smell.  The next day I asked her about her hair and she said her hair was great but there was an awful odor hanging over her head.  So it is the product.  Great on the hair, lousy in the air.  I used it twice.  Once as a quick cleans, and the second time I left it on for 15 minutes as a hair masque, just like I do with my WEN products.  Clairol is on to something here, a marvelous product that mimics WEN for a fraction of the price, but the need to fix the &amp;#34;after smell&amp;#34; issue.  As an additional note, it is a great shave cream, and this is how I will use up the remainder of my product.  UPDATE: 21 Apr 2016.  Trying to solve the after odor problem.  Well I did.  I used this exactly like I started to use to WEN--by pre diluting it 50:50 with water.  I mix up a whole bottle of pre mix so it is handy in the shower.  Just remember to use twice the number of pumps because it is half water.  This pre dilution really helps with the emulsifying of the product in the hair, which is necessary for the cleansing action.  I find I may still have to add  splash or two of water while I scrub my scalp and ends, but not like before.  Remember, water is the key.  Well. pre mixing with water was a great help in removing the strong after odor of this Herbal Essence product.  I really can&#x27;t recommend it enough for anyone who wants to try WEN but can&#x27;t afford it.  This product also comes in a Rose Mint scent, both are sold at Walmart.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about 2 weeks and I love it so far. I have very long/thick/curly/dry hair, so I&#x27;m always looking for a gentle cleanser and thought this might work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do find that it takes more than the 4-5 recommended pumps for me to feel like I&#x27;m using enough, but I&#x27;ve noticed that if I apply 6-7 pumps then (quickly) wet my hair under the shower again and massage, it &amp;#34;lathers&amp;#34; much better and does a great job of getting to my roots and scalp. I leave it in for 2-3 minutes, then rinse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use a lot of hairspray to set the curls and prevent frizz, and thus far I don&#x27;t see that this product is having any difficulty removing the bulk of that. My hair is much less frizzy already and I&#x27;ve noticed I&#x27;m using less and less hairspray every day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will probably use a regular gentle shampoo once a month or so, to remove any missed buildup, but I haven&#x27;t felt like I&#x27;ve needed to yet and I LOVE not having to buy 2 expensive separate products every 2 weeks. No issues with the smell for me, although I don&#x27;t know that I&#x27;d describe it as herbal mint.</li>
    <li> I have been using Wen for a couple of years and love the product but not the price.  As my two girls grow out their hair, it is just too expensive to use exclusively. I read all the reviews of similar products and finally decided to order the Herbal Essence Naked Cleansing Conditioner along with a few others to try.  This one arrived today (faster yhan expected delivery!) and I used it on myself as well as my girls.  Wow, I&#x27;m pleasantly surprised. It works very well, has a nice gentle smell, and rinsed clean leaving the hair soft but without and heavy weights or oils.  Both kids (4 &amp; 8) could brush out their very long hair with limited tangles!  I did notice it cannot be used as a leave in conditioner like Wen but there was no need to have a leave in after using this product.  I may buy Wen still for limited use but this will replace it for daily use!&lt;br /&gt;Pros: works well, rinses clean, gentle scent, great price!&lt;br /&gt;Cons: must rinse out (not a leave in)&lt;br /&gt;5 stars from my girls and I!</li>
    <li> I tried Wen and liked what it did for my hair, but didn&#x27;t like the price.  I found the Herbal Essences Naked cleaning conditioner on Amazon, love my hair, love the price.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff!  I have very long hair and this product makes it feel weightless and soft.  I also have oily hair and it still cleans it very well.  LEAVE IT ON AS LONG AS YOU CAN for the best results!</li>
    <li> Hair was almost more on the sticky side, so I don&#x27;t feel like it rinsed out completely. But that may also be the no sulfate thing, I&#x27;m really trying to switch to more organic products. Eventually going NO POO all together. It&#x27;s a process. Look it up...no poo...seriously Google it!</li>
    <li> I love WEN but not the price. My hair is full and stays clean even for 2-3 days and I really didn&#x27;t need frequent shampooing with WEN. This cleansing conditioner did neither of those things. My hair was limp and looked like it wasn&#x27;t even washed. So much for a cheaper alternative!</li>
    <li> This hair product is very affordable. It also cleans your hair super and lasts for several days. I will buy this product again.</li>
    <li> Smaller than I had imagined, but still a great value. The scent is really nice and the product leaves my hair really soft and smooth. Don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be going back to my traditional shampoo/conditioner any time soon.</li>
    <li> I have been cowashing my naturally curly hair for years and this is my new favorite, it is very thick and creamy and smells good. Leaves my hair soft.  I still  rotate the conditioners i use in an attempt to avoid buildup so I am not sure how it would do for daily use.</li>
    <li> I have tried several cleansing conditioners, I personally like this one the best. It leaves my hair soft and silky feeling and not fly away, without using another conditioner like a leave in or a spray to stop frizzies  It is thick enough that you don&#x27;t need but a couple pumps for whole head. My hair is very thick and shoulder length and by the way I color treat my hair also. I use this most days. generally on the 4th day or so I go back to my old regiment of shampoo and conditioner because my hair tends to get really oily depending on level of activity. Some days I even use twice in a day, so this is so much easier on my hair than traditional shampoos.</li>
    <li> I like it better than WEN. I think it works better with my hair and smells amazing.</li>
    <li> I really wanted to like the product.  I have normal wavy hair.  I need to wash it every 3 days or so or it becomes oily.  The cleanser left me hair REALLY greasy, flat, dull.  I used cleanser multiple times; first time with the amount recommended and then less and less.  I also tried more and more rinsing.  No amount of cleanser or rinsing left my hair non-greasy.  Towel dried or hair dryer made no difference.  This may be a good product for those with extremely dry hair, but for normal-oily I would stay away.  Quite disappointed since I have used Herbal Essences products in the past.</li>
    <li> I am mildly allergic to most Herbal Essences products (they cause me scalp to break out in sores), but when I saw that they had a &amp;#34;Naked&amp;#34; Cleansing Conditioner, and when I read that it is a competitor to my expensive infomercial cleansing conditioner, I bought it.  I thought the &amp;#34;naked&amp;#34; label might mean there are fewer chemicals in it, and thus I would have fewer issues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thankfully, I don&#x27;t seem to be allergic to this cleansing conditioner.  That&#x27;s a good thing.  HOWEVER, a bad thing about this cleansing conditioner is that I don&#x27;t think I can use it very often because the floral scent is SO overpowering that I feel sick when I first pump it into my hand.  It gives me a terrible headache!  Washing it out doesn&#x27;t help all that much because the scent lingers.  Ew.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried it cleansing conditioner a few times, and never got accustomed to the floral scent.  It is very, very strong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a product, I think this cleansing conditioner is about as effective as a 2-in-1 shampoo.  While this product doesn&#x27;t contain sulfates, so it isn&#x27;t as harsh as a 2-in-1 shampoo, it isn&#x27;t effective as a conditioner at all.  My hair wasn&#x27;t left feeling soft in the least.  Therefore, I&#x27;d say this is NOT a competitor for the expensive infomercial cleansing conditioner.</li>
    <li> Several years ago, I went through a WEN phase, until I could no longer afford it.  That stuff is RIDICULOUSLY overpriced!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tried a couple of the Hair One varieties, and like them very much (Jojoba version does best on my hair).  But, they are still almost double the price of this.  Two bottles of this is about $13 (some places, you can even find it for $4.99 a bottle), where a liter of Hair One is $25 and change if you have the discount card).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also tried the L&#x27;Oreal Cleansing Cream, and that stuff is GROSS!  The scent was HEAVILY perfumed, and it made my hair all matted and tangly when dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I jumped in and tried the Herbal Essences Naked Cleansing Conditioner....it is FABULOUS!  my hair is thin, fine, almost waist length, and stick straight, so I have to be careful how heavy shampoos and conditioners are. Yet, I also need moisture because my ends are dry. My hair detangled easily when wet, and now that it is dry, my scalp is clean and fresh, and my ends are nicely moisturized.  My hair feels silky yet light as air.  I hope this is never discontinued!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the scent, it was a bit strong when I was washing, but now that it has dried, I notice just a light fresh scent in my hair.  I love this!!</li>
    <li> This decent conditioner is completely ruined because Herbal Essences decided to throw an entire bottle of flowery smelling perfume into it. It doesn&#x27;t smell remotely like rosemary or mint. The conditioner itself actually works quite well, but it&#x27;s not worth choking to death in the shower, nor smelling it linger around me all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To be honest, this is the first hair care product I&#x27;ve purchased that is going in the trash. I cannot stand to use it. I DO love the Herbal Essences Naked Volume Shampoo. I have no clue why they didn&#x27;t use the same smell for this.</li>
    <li> This does what Wen does at a fraction of the cost. It smells great and gives my hair a break from shampoo.</li>
    <li> Great smell, leaves my hair soft and fresh.  Rinse in COLD WATER...helps close the cuticle and make your hair shiny.</li>
    <li> It made my dandruff much worse- probably because it has some anti-dandruff ingredients (which sometimes can make dandruff worse).</li>
    <li> I like this product better than wen.  I also love the smell and the price. I used to have hair falling out all the time and now, not so much.  I normally buy salon products but made an exception to try this out.  It really worked out for me, and now I dont have to pay 40 dollars for shampoo.  I would advise using more than what the bottle says though, especially if you have long or thick hair like mine.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t understand how this can clean anyone&#x27;s hair. I followed the directions to a T--and even experimented with different methods people had posted on here--and nothing. My hair never felt clean and it wasn&#x27;t even that soft. I literally feel as though plain water would clean better than this. Also? The smell is crazy strong and isn&#x27;t &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; smelling at all.</li>
    <li> This product will not rinse out, even with hot water because it contains dimethicone. The label says that is is low lather, but it is not; it has no lather at all. Additionally, the scent is so strong that it caused me to have an allergic reaction: itchy eyes, runny nose, sore throat. It took me a few days to figure out that it was the over-the-top scent of this product that was causing my symptoms. I typically do not have allergic reactions to anything. I cannot recommend this product at all.</li>
    <li> This has dimethicone (a silicone that is not water soluable) in it, and the greasy feeling really builds up on your hair, requiring a wash once a week is not more.  The smell is really strongly chemical, which is unexpected for a &amp;#34;Naked&amp;#34; product and there is a lot of alcohols in it.  While most of the ingredients were natural, many were not and it does not rinse out well.  After a few days, it clogged the pores in my head, causing pimples and the ph of my hair seemed really off, requiring me to rinse with an apple cider vinegar rinse twice just to get all the buildup and the ph back to normal.  I really don&#x27;t think this is worth it, and I don&#x27;t like Wen either. It&#x27;s just another bottle of shampoo that will sit on the bottom of my cabinet until I run out of absolutely everything else or it spoils and I throw it out.  My money is on it getting chucked.</li>
    <li> This is the first cleansing conditioner that I&#x27;ve ever used.  I purchased it at my local store while waiting for my bottle of Wen to come in the mail.  I like the light minty scent.  However, I gave the product four stars because the mint smells really good when your hair is wet but smells more earthy (like mint leaves) when it dries.  I didn&#x27;t quit know what to expect using this product.  The first time I used it I got out of the shower and my hair felt greesy.  That was my fault because I didn&#x27;t rinse it properly.  You need to make sure your hair is really wet to start and make sure you thuroughly massage your scalp while rinsing.  The second time I used it I thought my hair felt dry after I got out of the shower.  However, as I combed and blow dryed it, I found that it was dry at all.  Instead, my hair was shiney, and soft without being weighed down.  I was very pleased.  I have to wash my hair everyday because I work with animals (nobody wants their hair to smell like a zoo).  I think this product is great for frequent hair washings.  It makes your hair feel like nothing else I&#x27;ve ever tried.  I donn&#x27;t know that I will ever use regular shampoo and conditioner again.  I will also rate the Wen later on.</li>
    <li> Good product for a &amp;#34;healthier&amp;#34; conditioner. Less additives, no parabens, etc. The smell is strong. My hair is lefts feeling fine, not as soft as other lines of products but for the cost, I&#x27;m pleased.</li>
    <li> I started using this when WEN cancelled my account when I asked a question.  I love this stuff and it is WAY better than WEN or any other shampoo and conditioner combo I&#x27;ve used!  It smells great, lasts forever and I&#x27;m down to washing my hair twice a week and could almost stretch it to once if I wanted.  LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> I was a Wen user but wanted a product that was less expensive.  Read reviews for this product and found it at my local drug store. All I can say is...I am 100% sold! Leaves my hair soft, shiny and smells fantastic! 5 stars all the way :)</li>
    <li> great fragrance, doesn&#x27;t seem minty!  a great cheap alternative to wen!</li>
    <li> I was suffering postpartum dry and brittle hair.  A lot of my hair had fallen out and what was left looked like a dry paint brush.  Used it for about 4 weeks and it really hydrated my hair but it didn&#x27;t give it any volume.  I don&#x27;t recommend using it for long periods of time.</li>
    <li> This works wonderfully (once you get the knack for it). I wasn&#x27;t using this correctly the first time I used it. You really have to saturate your hair and scrub your scalp before you apply this product as well as when you apply it and rinse it out. It take a little longer than what I&#x27;m used to but it leaves my hair super silky soft and I&#x27;ve actually been stopped and asked what I&#x27;m wearing that smells so good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Bear in mind this is the smaller size than the picture - the picture is for the liter.  This has a pretty strong mint/herbal smell that doesn&#x27;t really fade.  It works amazingly well the first time I tried it but after repeated use my hair was absolutely disgusting.  I did my best to rinse it completely, even rinsing my head under the tub faucet.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s odd as you expect lather but it does make my hair soft. You use quite a lot but it is a big bottle,</li>
    <li> Fabulous and a much better value than WEN.</li>
    <li> Unlike the WEN cleansing condioner, this one left my hair looking oily after wash. My hair is not normally oily, but dry. This left my hair limp and with odd sectioning of the hair appearing oily.</li>
    <li> love the smell. also try the pantene cleansing conditioner guys</li>
    <li> My hair is very fine and straight, and I don’t have very thick hair. I have been using an “extra body” shampoo for ages to get my hair to at least give it the appearance of having some body, some bounce. When I first read about cleansing conditioners I was skeptical. My hair is already oily and needs to be washed daily, and I have avoided conditioners since all they seem to do is weigh my hair down and make it look greasy straight out of the shower.&lt;br /&gt;I don’t blow dry my hair or use a curling iron. I do dye it, which I know damages it.&lt;br /&gt;Having said all of that, when I came across this product and read all of the wonderful reviews, I figured, hey, for the money, I can afford to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;The people who write about the scent are dead-on. It smells AMAZING and it feels wonderful as you work it into your hair. When it was time to rinse it out I rinsed for a long time because my hair felt so soft and silky that I wasn’t sure it was all out. Then I towel-dried it and combed it out – NO TANGLES! At all!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When my hair was dry I brushed it out. I was enjoying the feeling of having silky-smooth hair, and it didn’t have any less body than it does when I use my “extra body” shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;The big test for me was yet to come. I wash my hair in the evening because mornings are a zoo at my house. I put a clean pillowcase on because my hair and face get oily when I sleep. I wondered how it would look the next morning.&lt;br /&gt;I do have to say that the smell, while wonderful at first, doesn’t go away and it got sort of annoying to me, to be constantly smelling my hair every time I moved. Even the next morning, the smell was still pretty strong, and I worry if this will be an issue at my “no scents allowed” job. It’s not a bad smell. I just want it to eventually go away.&lt;br /&gt;Having said that, my hair looked great the next morning. It was shinier, bouncier, and less scraggly-looking than with my shampoo. It looked like well-nourished,healthy hair. I was impressed. Not oily-looking at all. I loved the way it looked!!&lt;br /&gt;This is definitely worth the money (no more expensive than a “good” shampoo). Like I said, my only issue is that that wonderful smell that I enjoyed so much at first became sort of annoying when it followed me everywhere for the entire day after using the product. I would love it if this were offered in a non-scented option.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy it! Try it! You will be happily surprised with the results.</li>
    <li> I live in Las Vegas, Nevada. So you can imagine that I need some moisture in my hair to maintain my hair as much as I can. I have bleached my hair (I have dark brown medium hair and I have ombre) so it is even more critical to have moisture. I have tried Wen and this product seemed like a nice alternative than Wen since Wen is much more expensive than this product. However, I do think that Wen does make better cleansing conditioner. My hair is few inches below my shoulder and I do not like to wash my hair for three or four days. When I used when, I did not have any problem washing my hair for several days but this product made my hair greasy after the second day. Although you guys might think that because it&#x27;s a cleansing conditioner and it won&#x27;t ruin my hair, in Las Vegas, we have hard water so the water also damages my hair and we are trying to conserve as much water as possible so for me to have to wash my hair every two days does not do the trick for me. If you do wash your hair everyday, then this might work for you but it just did not fit my needs.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately I&#x27;m going to have to stick with wen(and only seasonal wen at that, every one of his regular formulas makes my hair greasy within a week. Don&#x27;t know what he does differently with the seasonal scents).  I am so picky with shampoo, I should have known this would be a no-go for me. This has a strong alcohol smell to it, makes my head itchy, and I can&#x27;t skip a day washing like with wen. I get greasy hair after a day. At least it was under $5 when I purchased it in the bullseye store.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a few months now. What impresses me most is the price. I wish it allowed me to go longer than a couple of days between washes but thats just because I  have ridiculously long hair and would like to get lazy about washes. I use around 8 pumps and really work it in through the scalp and down the hair, then let it sit for 5-10 mins. The bottle lasts about a month. Leaves my hair unbelievably soft and smelling beautifully.</li>
    <li> WEN did nothing for my hair.  It didn&#x27;t make it any softer, and my hair was just as frizzy as when I used regular shampoo.  After reading Elizabeth Sutton&#x27;s review above, and thought I&#x27;d give this product a try.  I am so glad.  It is more economical, it made my hair much less frizzy, and is softer.  Thank you so much, Elizabeth, for your review.  I am so relieved to dump my WEN and now I am going to keep using Herbal Essences.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a lot smaller than I thought it would be but I like the smell and it works well.</li>
    <li> The smell is good (and very strong) but its no where near as moisturizing as it says, at least not for me. Hopefully it worked for others.</li>
    <li> I was surprised at how much I like this product because I didn&#x27;t like Wen. The scent is not bad, but a little strong. It works great on my colored straight hair. I especially like using it when I&#x27;m in a hurry; one product! It really cleans my hair well and removes any dry ends. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> This worked okay, but I couldn&#x27;t handle the smell.  Very strong, and for me, not pleasant at all.</li>
    <li> Great smell and leaves my hair soft and shiny. Much cheaper alternative to wen!</li>
    <li> Well... It works great, cleans hair and leaves it slippery and soft, almost better than the Wen I&#x27;ve been using (it&#x27;s not waxy like Wen, or making my scalp/neck itch). But, the fragrance... it&#x27;s TOO MUCH. Granted, I&#x27;m a natural products gal, but, it&#x27;s not minty or herbal at all. Has an overpowering smell of a cheap perfumy old-school avon-type product my grandma might like. I&#x27;m gonna use it up if I can stand it, maybe try their Color Me Happy version (in their original rose scent) and see if that&#x27;s less off-putting.</li>
    <li> Wife is very happy with this.</li>
    <li> better then wen.  I won&#x27;t use anything else.  Sooo glad I found this tip on pinterest.</li>
    <li> The scent is ok. I prefer the grapefruit and mint scent, personally, which is what I thought I was purchasing (minor oversight). This is not your typical conditioner.  It&#x27;s a cleansing conditioner meant to be used in between wash days so that you don&#x27;t over work your hair and strip it of natural moisturizers. I have curly hair so I wash every other day, and this conditioner was a good addition to my routine. It helped clean my hair while leaving it feeling soft without stripping it of the natural oils. I would buy this product again, but in the other scent.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this cleansing conditioner!!! Leaves hair so soft!!!!!</li>
    <li> This is a decent cleansing conditioner product though not one of my favorites.  I feel it is best used as an occasional &amp;#34;in between washings&amp;#34; product and not a replacement for your normal routine.  I do have trouble with heavy conditioners weighing down my thick, coarse locks and this is not a problem with Herbal Essences Naked.  I&#x27;d recommend it.</li>
    <li> Idk why this got such good reviews, I think that it leaves my hair feeling like it has a coating on it. I have fine hair and by the end of the day it looks limp and greasy. The loreal cleansing conditioner is my favorite, I forget what its called but its in a tan pump bottle. Its better than wen and much cheaper! I will prob finish this bottle but I wont buy it again</li>
    <li> Smells great and cleans my thick frizzy hair well.</li>
    <li> This product blows WEN out of the water. It&#x27;s a cleansing conditioner and it leaves my hair soft and clean. I have fine hair, but lots of it. It does not weigh my hair down or leave it feeling greasy. As for the WEN comment, let me elaborate, this product works better, smells better, and can be had for a fraction of the cost of WEN. I cannot speak for users with a different hair type, but for my fine shoulder length hair, it works!</li>
    <li> I liked this product very much. It was gentle and my hair had less frizz (naturally curly) after only 1 use. The price is very affordable and I love the smell. 4/5 stars.</li>
    <li> great product. rinses out well. hair feels very nice. great scent. wonderful price value.</li>
    <li> The Herbal Essences Naked Cleansing Conditioner works great for co washing your hair.  This product contains no sulfates or parabens.  The directions state to just pump out three to four pumps massage it in and rinse out.  Really simple.  I did really like this product except for the smell.  It was a really strong smell that I just could not get passed.  It does smell a little like dryer sheets but very strong.  This product did make my hair really shiny and soft.  It is a great product for those who do not mind strong scents.  One last thing, make sure you rinse really well to get this out of your hair.  Rinse your hair until it squeaks.  You must make sure you get it all rinsed out or your hair may look greasy and weighed down.</li>
    <li> I loved the way my hair and scalp felt, asked myself &amp;#34;Wouldn&#x27;t it make the rest of my body feel good, too?&amp;#34;  So this is the only product I use in the shower: I use 1/2 pump for underarms, 1/2 pump for pubic area, then finish with 1 pump for male hair and scalp.  LOVE IT!  Others have complained about the odor--I don&#x27;t smell anything.  WOW</li>
    <li> Used it three times; threw the rest away. I have naturally curly hair that doesn&#x27;t/shouldn&#x27;t need to be washed very often -- I have gone more than a week without washing my hair without it looking dirty. This stuff MADE my hair dirty. I wanted to wash it out almost immediately after my hair dried and felt icky. Your mileage may vary but ... yuck.</li>
    <li> Works much like Wen at a fraction of the cost.  It would get five stars, but the fragrance is a little too intense.</li>
    <li> I tried this product as an alternative to the pricier cleansing conditioners, and I love it even more.  I love the minty smell, and my husband does too and always wAnts to smell my hair after I use it.  It makes my showers so much faster, and leaves my hair very soft.  I do use regular shampoo one every week or two just so I don&#x27;t get any build-up.</li>
    <li> great for fine dry hair and wont weigh it down</li>
    <li> Appallingly, horrifically fragrant.  And not in a nice, lightly herbal way as implied.  More of a perfumey, chemical version of floral way.  Had to wash it out of my hair after 2 hours of being offended by my own head.</li>
    <li> I have use this product, Wen, and the Loreal Everclear Cleansing Conditioner.  I prefer the Loreal version.  This product didn&#x27;t seem to get my hair as clean no matter how much product I used.  I did like the bigger bottle and pump though.</li>
    <li> Great cleanser that doesn&#x27;t dry hair</li>
    <li> Wow so happy they made this. Great stuff for my dry and curly hair. Awesome price too! Love it!</li>
    <li> I have been using Wen for about a year now and never thought I would stray however the price is extreme and I hated that also wen sometimes left my hair greasy at the top and on the sides. I saw this at Walgreens and for the price decided to try it. Yall this product is amazing it&#x27;s so easy to use pumps out well rinses well and after styling my hair have to say it&#x27;s as good if not better than Wen (sorry Chaz dean) this product is the way to go I&#x27;m now referring this to my friends instead of wen if that says anything and I think the smell is heavenly. If your hair is greasy after using you may not be using enough product my hair is long and not too thick and I use about five to six pumps. I&#x27;m hooked. Loving the product and the price I&#x27;m  hooked !!  Please don&#x27;t stop making this stuff!!!!</li>
    <li> AMAZING! I will buy this cleansing conditioner again many many times!</li>
    <li> Love this stuff.  Works much better than Wen.  Makes my dry hair soft.  Lathers better than most cleansing conditioners and detangles really well.</li>
    <li> I have bought this more than once. I really love it. It is inexpensive, and makes my hair feel, and smell great.</li>
    <li> This was my first cleansing conditioner so I don&#x27;t have anything to compare it to. That being said...WOW. I am in love with this product. The size is great because I get a lot of usage out of it (AND I have long hair) so it&#x27;s quite the value. But most importantly, it does what it&#x27;s supposed to do. IT CLEANS WELL. I was a little hesitant to try a cleansing conditioner because my hair can be quite oily but this didn&#x27;t have any impact on the oiliness of my hair. The smell lasts all day and my hair just feels so clean. If you are thinking of trying a cleansing conditioner give this one a shot. Can&#x27;t beat the price or the results. Plenty of good hair days!</li>
    <li> I like the regular Herbal Essence better. I got the product in a timely manner, packaged fine, but for my hair, it just made it really dry. I have normal wavy hair. It might just depend on your hair type but for me, it was simply okay.</li>
    <li> As many others, I am a fan of Wen (but not the price) so I have been experimenting with other cleansing conditioners.  I love this product.  I am not sure if I would say it is better than Wen, but it is definitely in competition with them.  I have also tried the Loreal Evercreme Cleansing Conditioner and I think this one is much better.  This one has a much better smell and rinses more completely.&lt;br /&gt;One tip - the price here is three times what I buy it for at the local store so shop around on this one.</li>
    <li> need to use a regular shampoo every so often (for me it&#x27;s two weeks) because there&#x27;s a greasy build up.  It&#x27;s nice, but it&#x27;s nothing compared to Wen.....</li>
    <li> About a year ago I started using cleansing conditioners instead of shampoo + conditioner. I was very skeptical about trying them, because I have really oily skin and hair, but I couldn&#x27;t be happier with this type of hair care product and I will *never* go back to shampooing again! Ever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In terms of my needs (for your reference) - I have oily skin/scalp with fine hair that would look really grungy, even the next day. I never understood how people could just not wash their hair *every single day* because if I didn&#x27;t mine was horribly limp, clumpy and greasy as early as the next morning upon waking. In addition, probably because of over-shampooing, my hair strands themselves would be dry and brittle, especially at the ends. Basically my hair and scalp were a mess. I tried everything from expensive to cheap to natural to chemical-laden degreaser type formulas. Nothing worked and the balance of degreasing scalp to moisturizing ends to not weighing down the fine hair was a ridiculous dance that I never mastered. Until cleansing conditioners came into my life!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I saw an article about cleansing conditioners and what they could do, and I decided, \\&quot;Why not? What have I got to lose?\\&quot;. At first, even reading the directions, I didn&#x27;t \\&quot;do it right\\&quot;. After tinkering with my methods the results were amazing right off the bat, but over time my hair&#x27;s condition further improved. I now don&#x27;t have as greasy a scalp, and with powder I can extend a shampoo a couple days. Also, my hair strands and ends are no longer dry or brittle. One product now does for me what I couldn&#x27;t get two or more to do in all my life!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is probably something that people need to adjust to suit their needs, but I do this to make these products work:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. At the very beginning of your shower time - Really wet the hair with warm water.&lt;br /&gt;2. Apply plenty of product. (Better too much than too little!)&lt;br /&gt;3. If needed, continue to dampen hair further - by briefly placing head under the shower head and massaging scalp/strands - while applying product to be sure the hair is *completely* saturated by water and product.&lt;br /&gt;4. Use finger pads to deeply massage the product into scalp and double check strands are coated, too. This is key, because you suds up your shampoo to clean out the dirt and oil. If you slap this on like a conditioner it won&#x27;t get a chance to clean.&lt;br /&gt;5. Let the product penetrate while you do your other shower things. This is like the conditioning time, and leaves the hair soft.&lt;br /&gt;6. Lightly dampen hair, massage again for a moment and then rinse thoroughly. This may take a bit longer than shampoo or some light conditioners, but thorough removal is key to not having limp hair.&lt;br /&gt;-I typically rinse with warm water, to get all the excess product out, and then finish off with a cool burst to close the cuticles for shine.&lt;br /&gt;7. That&#x27;s it! Enjoy your wonderfully clean hair and scalp!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried a few brands so far, in attempting to find \\&quot;perfection\\&quot; or, in the case of this product, out of necessity. I normally go for more natural types of products, but I was out of my former product and it was out of stock. Herbal Essences Naked Cleansing Conditioner at least is no parabens, etc. So I tried it out and was quite happy with it. Here are my thoughts:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;-Very, very inexpensive! This doesn&#x27;t even count that you won&#x27;t be needing conditioner or as much conditioner, or any of the other products you may be able to reduce or omit from your beauty regimen. (Note: It may cost less at the store than on Amazon, where beauty products seem to get a \\&quot;convenience\\&quot; markup. At my local bargain department store [Meijers] this cost ~$5-6.00 and wasn&#x27;t on sale.)&lt;br /&gt;-Reasonably pleasant faux-floralish [aka typical Herbal Essence] fragrance. (This is subjective, of course, as all fragrance is. You may hate it! Who knows?)&lt;br /&gt;-Pleasing creamy and thick texture. It feels more substantial than *any*of the other cleansing conditioners I have used.&lt;br /&gt;-The pump is well-designed for this type of product! Wow! What a concept! It is large with a wide opening which allows a perfect amount of product to be dispensed so you don&#x27;t have to pump-pump-pump! 8-10 times for even your fine/short hair. (I use one pump for my front scalp. One for middle back. One for lower back. And sometimes another one or two if needed.)&lt;br /&gt;-No parabens, sulfates or colorants.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS: (Very subjective!)&lt;br /&gt;-Not as natural as I would like it to be, but that may not matter to you. Without going too overboard, I *try* to buy from companies that have an eye towards being less impactful to the planet&#x27;s bottom line, i.e. organic, or natural as can be, not tested on animals, socially and environmentally responsible product, company and/or parent company. In fact, I usually avoid Proctor and Gamble, but had mistakenly bought this product in haste while shopping with an impatient male family member. I may not buy it again purely for that reason alone, but impartially considering the results from the standalone product - I found that Herbal Essences Naked Cleansing Conditioner made my hair/scalp feel great and I would choose it over shampoo+conditioner any day of the week. In fact, if not for the Proctor and Gamble part, I would definitely make this my favorite cleanser for its smart design, great value and effectiveness. I may choose to purchase again anyway for those reasons, but haven&#x27;t decided. :-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe this is your perfect product? Best of luck! :&#x27;D&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: Looks like you can get this for $2.50 as an add-on product now, which is a great deal! I picked one up, even though I had been on the fence about repurchasing. I mean at that price, it is cheaper than Suave or the cheapest grocer&#x27;s generics. Even though I am not thrilled about the Proctor &amp; Gamble part, I am on a budget, and sometimes we all have to choose our battles.of the other cleansing conditioners I have used.&lt;br /&gt;-The pump is well-designed for this type of product!

    <li> Leaves hair soft and manageable. Better than using shampoo or other conditioners on the market.  Great product for the price.  Try it and you won&#x27;t use shampoo again.</li>
    <li> Herbal Essences products usually smell great, however, this one smells like fake perfume. I felt like I couldn&#x27;t get away from the smell especially when I was trying to sleep. It did make my hair feel clean though.</li>
    <li> I love the idea of this product, but it&#x27;s just not good enough to maintain my hair yet. Keep up the research Clairol!</li>
    <li> Let me start off by saying that my hair is so damaged from bleaching that I can not use regular shampoo, not even sulfate free. It dries up the ends and makes them crispy. I was using Loreal cleansing conditioner before, but it was hard to find in my area. I tried this product after reading reviews and finding out they sold is at my local store and I am extremely satisfied. It gets my hair cleaner than the Loreal product and doesn&#x27;t leave my hair greasy, even on the two inches of healthy growth up top. My hair is naturally very greasy, so even some shampoos did not do this for me. It leaves my hair super soft and I love the minty smell.&lt;br /&gt;Even though this product is supposed to function as a conditioner, I use a separate conditioner because my hair is just so damaged. I use Organix Biotin and Collagen to restore protein to my hair with every wash. I do not leave the cleansing conditioner in for several minutes as the bottle says because I am using the product as a shampoo. I also focus on my roots because that is where the oil and sweat from working out are. I did once leave it on for several minutes once and my hair felt kind of greasy afterwards, so I recommend using it the way I do.</li>
