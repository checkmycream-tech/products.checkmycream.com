### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>I am happy with this product, I just wish someone else would notice the difference!!</li>
      <li>This would be the perfect dream...if it worked.  </li>
      <li>best way to apply is just below the crease line and with the curved edges up.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>My eyes look so beautiful.</li>
      <li>Great product.</li>
      <li>THis is a great product for droopy eyelids.  </li>
      <li>but this one is great.  </li>
      <li>say just be happy with self or get surgery.</li>
      <li>but no one ever commented.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I happy with the product and the results for me.</li>
      <li>and i love the results!!</li>
      <li>but after the first application I was so happy to see a difference!  </li>
      <li>Buyer beware, if it sounds too good to be true, it probably is.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t even feel like I&#x27;m wearing anything on my eyes and like one reviewer said, feel like I&#x27;m more awake.  </li>
      <li>Although I wouldn&#x27;t say they&#x27;re invisible, no one has yet been able to tell I&#x27;m wearing them.  </li>
      <li>so I&#x27;ll see if anyone says something:)  </li>
      <li>, I will be ordering more of these.</li>
      <li>but once you figure it out you will love this product.</li>
      <li>I did show the adhesive on top of my eyelid.  </li>
      <li>I do not recommend even if they were handing them out for free!</li>
      <li>The HUGE problem with me is make up does not stick to the adhesive so instead of make up concealing the adhesive, it outlines the adhesive, make it even more visible.  </li>
      <li>Hasn&#x27;t caused any irritaion and is easy to take off and put on.  </li>
      <li>Thanks!! :)</li>
      <li>I have used this product since it first showed up on TV, have always found it easy to use and easy to hide but this latest package will not stick to my eyelid.  </li>
      <li>I liked them so much, that I have them sent to me monthly</li>
      <li>I have just found it to be more hassle than it is worth.</li>
      <li>it says you can cut to fit</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m so excited</li>
      <li>The sticky side sticks on the eyelid just fine, but they need to make the other side somehow able to grab the make up and allow make up to stick to it...if they do that, then I may be able to hide the adhesive much better.  </li>
      <li>I am sure they will sell millions of boxes on the retail market, but shame on them for not telling the whole truth about this product.</li>
      <li>Who wants to walk around with a &amp;#34;piece of tape&amp;#34; under their brown bone!!</li>
      <li>After I used it, it did make my eyes feel fresh and awake.  </li>
      <li>The strips were very easy to apply, but maybe I got lucky with proper placement.  </li>
      <li>it&#x27;s worth the effort and practice when they&#x27;re on right.  </li>
      <li>My right eye sags to the point</li>
      <li>It is true that you really cannot use eye shadow....</li>
      <li>The first application I noticed a difference right away.</li>
      <li>but when I put these on I instantly feel more awake.  </li>
      <li>I really like this product!</li>
      <li>Ive been through all the reviews and some people are saying that this product is very visible?</li>
      <li>The more wrinkles you have the harder</li>
      <li>I did not feel comfortable putting scissors that close to my eyes and it did not give me a double lid.</li>
      <li>My eyelid is not bad but there are days that I get droopy eyelid if I don&#x27;t get enough sleep.  </li>
      <li>I have been ordering this product for about a year now, and its quality has steadily gone down-hill.  </li>
      <li>highly recommend trying these lifts.</li>
      <li>I had high hopes.</li>
      <li>In pictures I&#x27;m very self conscious.  </li>
      <li>It was a little challenging at first learning how to position the tapes properly but now it is a breeze.  </li>
      <li>the product gave new life to my face as it lifted my drooping eyelids.</li>
      <li>My first couple of shipments provided a product that would stay on my eyelid for the entire day.  </li>
      <li>Let&#x27;s be real, nothing is going to work as well as an actual eye lift, but for all intent and purposes these do the job temporarily.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m considering eyelid surgery, but until/unless I decide to go that far</li>
      <li>I can really see the difference, but no one else has commented \\&quot;you look younger,</li>
      <li>I GUESS MY EYELIDS ARE TOO FAR GONE AND SAGGY</li>
      <li>if I wear eye liner right above my lash line, a few minutes later it tattoos a line above my eye crease (from my top eye skin drooping over my lashes).  </li>
      <li>Once again I got an old box where the adhesive was so dry, it was unusable and yet another instruction video shot so it was very unclear, to me anyway.</li>
      <li>so I didn&#x27;t have to bother with a new set the next day.  </li>
      <li>I used several strips to try every possible position to place the strip, following the directions exactly.</li>
      <li>The reason it did that is because the adhesive is smooth and slippery which makes it hard for make up to stick on it</li>
      <li>THe results are much more dramatic that in the picture as she&#x27;s not that droopy.  </li>
      <li>I wasted more than half the strips and when I finally thought it would work, the strip popped out!  </li>
      <li>Not only are the strips completely visible, they actually accentuate the crease and sag of the eyelid.</li>
      <li>Although it does take a bit of practice to put these on correctly - and I&#x27;ve wasted more than a few trying -</li>
      <li>I was very skeptical when I first purchased this product as so many items like this do not work</li>
      <li>This is a great vanity item for young models, but totally worthless to senior adults.</li>
      <li>some days I feel as though I can barely keep my eyes open, and I feel sleepy all day as a result -</li>

<li> Spent about an hour playing around with it and then dropped it in the trash.</li>
<li> Wish I could give it 0 stars, they are just total garbage dont waste your money or time ordering this.</li>
<li> that&#x27;s to say by mid-day the strips lose adhesiveness and begin slipping.  </li>

<li> My eyelids were almost non-existent due to aging.  </li>
<li> You also have to be very careful peeling the strip off of the paper, or it will stick together</li>
<li> Thier advertisments fail to disclose the limitations of the product, its absolutely ignored.  </li>
<li> I thought it would save me till surgery, but the skin just lays over top of tape and looks bad!</li>
<li> I can use a little close under the brow to give a lifted illusion, though.  </li>
<li> waste of money, these don&#x27;t do a thing</li>
<li> I was always self conscious wearing fake lashes too...</li>
<li> I clearly wasted my money on this product.  </li>

<li> you waste a ton before you can get a hang of it!</li>
<li> It is the most stupid thing ever!!!</li>
<li> I have very heavy eyelids -</li>
<li> Does not work no matter how hard I try.  </li>
<li> It is hard to position the strip to make your eyes even.  </li>
<li> Just read the negative reviews and that sums up my experience.  </li>
<li> That little extra profit that thier greed has brought in was worthless compared to the loss of integrity that thier marketing tactics have caused.  </li>
<li> not really good</li>
<li> I tried other products from Asia, AB Mezical Fiber Double Eyelid Eye Lift Fibers, and it was awful.</li>
<li> This is not to say that I have never successfully used it, because I have once or twice.  </li>
<li> so it is difficult to remove.</li>
<li> You will look like a crazy person with plastic on your eyelid-</li>
<li> Disappointed...</li>
<li> I was disappointed in the Dream</li>

    <li> waste of money, these don&#x27;t do a thing</li>
    <li> Save your money.  Once again I got an old box where the adhesive was so dry, it was unusable and yet another instruction video shot so it was very unclear, to me anyway.</li>
    <li> This would be the perfect dream...if it worked.  Truth be known, the if you have heavy eyelids above the crease in your eye, this product is not going to work very well.  Thier advertisments fail to disclose the limitations of the product, its absolutely ignored.  I am sure they will sell millions of boxes on the retail market, but shame on them for not telling the whole truth about this product. This is a great vanity item for young models, but totally worthless to senior adults. That little extra profit that thier greed has brought in was worthless compared to the loss of integrity that thier marketing tactics have caused.  Buyer beware, if it sounds too good to be true, it probably is.</li>
    <li> not really good it you have big eyes or shape of eyes is different. it says you can cut to fit but how, they are sticky.&lt;br /&gt;I say just be happy with self or get surgery.</li>
    <li> The first application I noticed a difference right away. My right eye sags to the point if I wear eye liner right above my lash line, a few minutes later it tattoos a line above my eye crease (from my top eye skin drooping over my lashes).  In pictures I&#x27;m very self conscious.  I was hesitant...but after the first application I was so happy to see a difference!  I&#x27;m so excited, I&#x27;ve been looking for a product like this...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They are visible...so I&#x27;ll see if anyone says something:)  I was always self conscious wearing fake lashes too...but no one ever commented.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I happy with the product and the results for me.</li>
    <li> I was disappointed in the Dream Look Instant Eye Lift. It is hard to position the strip to make your eyes even.  Also, the strip sometimes shows.  The more wrinkles you have the harder it is to work with.  You also have to be very careful peeling the strip off of the paper, or it will stick together and you can&#x27;t use it.  This is not to say that I have never successfully used it, because I have once or twice.  I have just found it to be more hassle than it is worth.</li>
    <li> The strips do not adhere well. The strips are placed on the paper crooked so it is difficult to remove.</li>
    <li> I was very skeptical when I first purchased this product as so many items like this do not work but this one is great.  It was a little challenging at first learning how to position the tapes properly but now it is a breeze.  My friends have asked if I have had an eye lift.  The product makes me look so much younger.  I can wear the one pair for weeks without replacing them as long as I don&#x27;t wash over the tape.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend trying these lifts.</li>
    <li> I thought it would save me till surgery, but the skin just lays over top of tape and looks bad!</li>
    <li> Let&#x27;s be real, nothing is going to work as well as an actual eye lift, but for all intent and purposes these do the job temporarily.The trick is learning how to place them properly so that both eyelids look even.Once in place they do show a difference.Two things to mention though,1.They are not completely invisible and can be seen if you close your eyes 2. Tried wearing eye shadow but you could see the outline of the tape so I didn&#x27;t wear it.I am caucasion so maybe a different skin tone might make a difference but if you know their limitations you can make it work.&lt;br /&gt;use it.</li>
    <li> My order was received by the date it was promised.&lt;br /&gt;My instant eye lift works wonders for my eyes and&lt;br /&gt;makes me look younger.</li>
    <li> Although it does take a bit of practice to put these on correctly - and I&#x27;ve wasted more than a few trying - it&#x27;s worth the effort and practice when they&#x27;re on right.  I have very heavy eyelids - some days I feel as though I can barely keep my eyes open, and I feel sleepy all day as a result - but when I put these on I instantly feel more awake.  I&#x27;ve even slept in them so I didn&#x27;t have to bother with a new set the next day.  Using tweezers to remove them from the sheet they come on and position them properly helps a lot.  Although I wouldn&#x27;t say they&#x27;re invisible, no one has yet been able to tell I&#x27;m wearing them.  I&#x27;m considering eyelid surgery, but until/unless I decide to go that far, I will be ordering more of these.</li>
    <li> I was born with hooded eyes and this product has helped to give me a double lid. It takes practice to get them on but once you figure it out you will love this product. They work so well for me I considered getting the eye surgery. My eyes look so beautiful. I tried other products from Asia, AB Mezical Fiber Double Eyelid Eye Lift Fibers, and it was awful. I did not feel comfortable putting scissors that close to my eyes and it did not give me a double lid.</li>
    <li> This product did not work at all as promised. Not only are the strips completely visible, they actually accentuate the crease and sag of the eyelid. I used several strips to try every possible position to place the strip, following the directions exactly. These simply DO NOT WORK.  Disappointed...</li>
    <li> I have been using the Dream Look Instant Eye Lifts for about a month.  I liked them so much, that I have them sent to me monthly automoatically.  I can really see the difference, but no one else has commented \\&quot;you look younger, what&#x27;s up?\\&quot;.  It is true that you really cannot use eye shadow....I have tried under and over the tape,neither working well.  I can use a little close under the brow to give a lifted illusion, though.  I am happy with this product, I just wish someone else would notice the difference!!</li>
    <li> THis is a great product for droopy eyelids.  Hasn&#x27;t caused any irritaion and is easy to take off and put on.  My insurance won&#x27;t pay for surgery yet and now that I found these I don&#x27;t need it.  THe results are much more dramatic that in the picture as she&#x27;s not that droopy.  Great product.</li>
    <li> I know this is a review but I thought I would just use it to get some answers!! Ive been through all the reviews and some people are saying that this product is very visible? I really don&#x27;t have that bad of dropping eyes. I just wanted to buy them to shape my eyes. So if any one could tell me about this product before I buy it please reply. Thanks!! :)</li>
    <li> Despite the mixed reviews i decided to try as I have hooded upper eyelid and no money for surgery.&lt;br /&gt;I apply the strips sfter I put make up on my eyes and I do not use the cream at all.&lt;br /&gt;The best way to apply is just below the crease line and with the curved edges up.&lt;br /&gt;I use it now every day and i love the results!!</li>
    <li> My eyelid is not bad but there are days that I get droopy eyelid if I don&#x27;t get enough sleep.  So I bought this product at my local pharmacy and agreed that at 19.99 is a bit steep for just adhesive papers.  After I used it, it did make my eyes feel fresh and awake.  I did show the adhesive on top of my eyelid.  So I applied some makeup on it.  The HUGE problem with me is make up does not stick to the adhesive so instead of make up concealing the adhesive, it outlines the adhesive, make it even more visible.  The reason it did that is because the adhesive is smooth and slippery which makes it hard for make up to stick on it...make up just slide off.  That is my biggest problem with this product.  The sticky side sticks on the eyelid just fine, but they need to make the other side somehow able to grab the make up and allow make up to stick to it...if they do that, then I may be able to hide the adhesive much better.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> Just read the negative reviews and that sums up my experience.  Spent about an hour playing around with it and then dropped it in the trash.</li>
    <li> PERHAPS THIS WOULD WORK FOR SOME PEOPLE, BUT IT DID NOT WORK FOR ME AT ALL. I GUESS MY EYELIDS ARE TOO FAR GONE AND SAGGY FOR IT TO WORK.</li>
    <li> I bought it as a gift for my life time friend - she loves it! She named it &amp;#34;Magic eye opener!&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> I have been ordering this product for about a year now, and its quality has steadily gone down-hill.  My first couple of shipments provided a product that would stay on my eyelid for the entire day.  Current shipments provide what appears to be the same product but, with much less staying power.....that&#x27;s to say by mid-day the strips lose adhesiveness and begin slipping.  Additionally, the last two orders have been missing adhesive pieces, so I am not receiving what I paid for.</li>
    <li> Found these in my local drugstore, they only had one left and I was curious.  My eyelids were almost non-existent due to aging.  The strips were very easy to apply, but maybe I got lucky with proper placement.  They do not show on me, again, maybe due to proper placement?  I don&#x27;t even feel like I&#x27;m wearing anything on my eyes and like one reviewer said, feel like I&#x27;m more awake.  I really like this product!</li>
    <li> Does not work no matter how hard I try.  I clearly wasted my money on this product.  Would like to get my money back.</li>
    <li> These are a total scam, 1st you waste a ton before you can get a hang of it! 2nd, they can be seen a mile away 3rd don&#x27;t even think you can put make up over these to hide them!!! You will look like a crazy person with plastic on your eyelid- a total rip off.  Wish I could give it 0 stars, they are just total garbage dont waste your money or time ordering this.</li>
    <li> the product gave new life to my face as it lifted my drooping eyelids. I was amazed that it actually worked as described and that the tapes are not visible.</li>
    <li> I tried all the different suggestions and this simply does not work for me.  I wasted more than half the strips and when I finally thought it would work, the strip popped out!  I do not recommend this product. I had high hopes.</li>
    <li> Hate it, do not order this!  It is the most stupid thing ever!!! they are strips that are suppose to give you a temporary lift! If only and you can see them on your skin!  Who wants to walk around with a &amp;#34;piece of tape&amp;#34; under their brown bone!! I do not recommend even if they were handing them out for free!</li>
    <li> I have used this product since it first showed up on TV, have always found it easy to use and easy to hide but this latest package will not stick to my eyelid.  I am doing nothing different so I am wondering if these are old or maybe the extreme heat in traveling to me has ruined the stickiness, the little pot of adhesive doesn&#x27;t help this problem.</li>
