      <li>Works Great!</li>
      <li>This is great stuff!  </li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s the best for what we do in the shop.</li>
      <li>The best hand soap I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s almost as good as the grit-based hand soap that was sold by ANCO years ago!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s also really great for cleaning the sink and getting stains out of clothing.  </li>
      <li>I am a happy</li>
      <li>Great price at this seller.</li>
      <li>Works great.</li>
      <li>I find the scented soaps too odorous most of the time, so this is a great alternative.</li>
      <li>This is a rugged, effective soap and you&#x27;ll love it.</li>
      <li>Best hand soap ever made even better than gojo, removes grease, dirt and stains from clothing, leaves hands soft without drying out</li>
      <li>Boraxo is probably what I use most.</li>
      <li>Wimps will complain that it scratch&#x27;s their hands, but it still works better than all the gel types in my opinion.</li>
      <li>(Make sure to label it so no one uses it on their corn flakes.)</li>
      <li>This powdered hand soap is better than anything now on the market.</li>
      <li>It comes in a box, so I took a plastic peanut butter container and poked holes in the top to use as a shaker/dispenser.</li>
      <li>then turn it back on to rinse, a very good conservation practice.    </li>
      <li>Much cheaper then the department store exfoliants and just as good.</li>
      <li>Good old fashion quality!</li>
      <li>Leaves your skin feeling clean and smooth.  </li>
      <li>Worth the purchase!</li>
      <li>it gets your hands clean regardless of the dirt/grease</li>
      <li>Even helps clean paint brushes, but needs a lot of rinsing when done.</li>
      <li>This leaves my hands feeling clean.</li>
      <li>You will need a special powder dispenser though too.</li>
      <li>It is abrasive, but not painful.</li>
      <li>After a full day of work, this stuff will get my hands cleaner than they were when I clocked in - and without drying them out either.</li>
      <li>This amazing hand cleaner scrubs clean, rinses off completely and leave your hands very smooth but not dried out.</li>
      <li>Always works good, doesn&#x27;t leave your hands feeling dry and takes out the dirt.  </li>
      <li>And best of all, a tiny bit goes a very long way.</li>
      <li>My family was frightened by it, as it is old school, so I did some research and learned that it&#x27;s as safe as can be.</li>
      <li>This stuff is a staple in our household of contractors, it&#x27;s the closest thing I&#x27;ve found to the old Anco hand cleaner which was even better but no longer made.  </li>
      <li>but this soap cleans them right up without drying them out.</li>
      <li>and they all get pretty grimy.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s refreshing to take a shower with this gritty hand soap.</li>
      <li>The only thing I have found that really cleans my hands of most kinds of dirt and grease.</li>
      <li>Thanks</li>
      <li>You don&#x27;t need much to get the job done.</li>
      <li>Best soap ever for cleaning excessively dirty hands.</li>
      <li>and it is very cost-effective</li>
      <li>But it really has an odor when pouring it into the dispenser.</li>
      <li>I forget the name of the shampoo back in the 50&#x27;s  that said it gets your hair squeaky clean, but this does it for your hands.    </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried the orange gooey stuff among other hand cleaners and while they do cut grease for good old fashioned dirt they don&#x27;t seem aggressive enough and leave your hands feeling funky and smelling like a perfume.  </li>
      <li>the \\&quot;Fast Orange\\&quot; so-called heavy-duty cleaner which is marked and sold everywhere does not come close to the cleaning power this powder delivers.</li>
      <li>which is normally what you get when you spend a couple of hours inside your engine compartment or under your car.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Cheap by comparison to other industrial soaps.</li>
      <li>This stuff cuts through it pretty quickly and isn&#x27;t too harsh on their skin.</li>
      <li>This stuff used to be in all the old auto shops because it works!</li>
      <li>Wow!</li>
      <li>Wet your hands first, then sprinkle some on.   </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s time for new generations to discover this terrific and thrifty hand cleaner.</li>
      <li>I have a liquid soap dispenser for general hand washing.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> This stuff is awesome, the \\&quot;Fast Orange\\&quot; so-called heavy-duty cleaner which is marked and sold everywhere does not come close to the cleaning power this powder delivers. This is the only cleaner that works if you get your hands all dirty in engine grease, oil, buildups, etc. which is normally what you get when you spend a couple of hours inside your engine compartment or under your car.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line, if you work on your car yourself - buy this cleaner. It will deliver. You will need a special powder dispenser though too.</li>
    <li> Works great. No residue</li>
    <li> The best hand soap I&#x27;ve ever used. Sometimes hard to find locally in powdered form for dispenser. Even helps clean paint brushes, but needs a lot of rinsing when done. Great price at this seller.</li>
    <li> I truly like Borax it gets your hands clean regardless of the dirt/grease and it is very cost-effective</li>
    <li> Even dandelion stains come out of my hands with this soap.  It&#x27;s also really great for cleaning the sink and getting stains out of clothing.  That box will last forever too because you need very little.  I put it into a plastic salt shaker with a lid to keep it from getting wet in the bathroom.</li>
    <li> What can I say, it&#x27;s Boraxo soap!  Always works good, doesn&#x27;t leave your hands feeling dry and takes out the dirt.  Not too gritty either.  Worth the purchase!</li>
    <li> I use three different soaps in my shop. I have a liquid soap dispenser for general hand washing. I use the Boraxo when my hands are moderately dirty. If my hands are really dirty with grease and oil I use the orange hand cleaner in a pump dispenser.&lt;br /&gt;The Boraxo is probably what I use most. It works well and doesn&#x27;t seem to make my hands as rough as the orange stuff. But it really has an odor when pouring it into the dispenser. Wow! Try not to breath it.</li>
    <li> This stuff is a staple in our household of contractors, it&#x27;s the closest thing I&#x27;ve found to the old Anco hand cleaner which was even better but no longer made.  The grit in this is what makes it work on ground in dirt.  I&#x27;ve tried the orange gooey stuff among other hand cleaners and while they do cut grease for good old fashioned dirt they don&#x27;t seem aggressive enough and leave your hands feeling funky and smelling like a perfume.  This leaves my hands feeling clean.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s refreshing to take a shower with this gritty hand soap. Leaves your skin feeling clean and smooth.  Much cheaper then the department store exfoliants and just as good.</li>
    <li> This powdered hand soap is better than anything now on the market. It&#x27;s almost as good as the grit-based hand soap that was sold by ANCO years ago!</li>
    <li> This amazing hand cleaner scrubs clean, rinses off completely and leave your hands very smooth but not dried out. I&#x27;ve used it for 50 years. My mother always had this for her five active kids.  It&#x27;s is the gardener&#x27;s dream.  I can&#x27;t believe how hard it is to find in retail stores. It&#x27;s time for new generations to discover this terrific and thrifty hand cleaner.</li>
    <li> The only thing I have found that really cleans my hands of most kinds of dirt and grease. Arrived in a timely manner and was undamaged. Thanks</li>
    <li> My husband uses it for his hands at work .&lt;br /&gt;Being a printer gets his hands so filthy but this soap cleans them right up without drying them out.</li>
    <li> This stuff used to be in all the old auto shops because it works! Wimps will complain that it scratch&#x27;s their hands, but it still works better than all the gel types in my opinion. Is hard to find in the stores now. 5 pounds will last a long time.</li>
    <li> Works Great! Digs out all the grease and grime without all the harsh chems that dry out your hands and make them crack and bleed.</li>
    <li> I had been looking all over for Boraxo. Any time I found a little container at the store I bought it. I paid about three times what those little containers cost and got a 5 pound refill. I am a happy do it yourselfer now!</li>
    <li> This is great stuff!  The grittiness of the Borax digs deep into the ridges of your hands.  I forget the name of the shampoo back in the 50&#x27;s  that said it gets your hair squeaky clean, but this does it for your hands.    A little goes a long way, I would guess I use about 1/4 teaspoon or less.  Wet your hands first, then sprinkle some on.   I use a grated Parmesan cheese container as a shaker.  I always shut the water off while I&#x27;m scrubbing my hands  then turn it back on to rinse, a very good conservation practice.    Robbin Rohner</li>
    <li> I decided to buy this as an alternative to Goop or other industrial-style hand cleaners. Used it as a kid and forgot about it until recently. My family was frightened by it, as it is old school, so I did some research and learned that it&#x27;s as safe as can be. Boy does it work! Grease, oil, you name it, a shake of this stuff gets it gone. It is abrasive, but not painful. I like that feel instead of the slimy, gel type hand cleaners. It comes in a box, so I took a plastic peanut butter container and poked holes in the top to use as a shaker/dispenser. (Make sure to label it so no one uses it on their corn flakes.) Stuff doesn&#x27;t smell either. I find the scented soaps too odorous most of the time, so this is a great alternative. This is a rugged, effective soap and you&#x27;ll love it. Cheap by comparison to other industrial soaps. You don&#x27;t need much to get the job done.</li>
    <li> Sometimes, working on my bikes or vehicles, my hands can get pretty dirty. This Boraxo powder is the same old-school stuff from years and years ago, and it works like a champ! And best of all, a tiny bit goes a very long way.</li>
    <li> Best hand soap ever made even better than gojo, removes grease, dirt and stains from clothing, leaves hands soft without drying out</li>
    <li> I have a shop with 12 guys in it and they all get pretty grimy. This stuff cuts through it pretty quickly and isn&#x27;t too harsh on their skin. For the price, you can&#x27;t beat it!</li>
    <li> This stuff is simply the best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have probably used every other brand out there, and none compare.  After a full day of work, this stuff will get my hands cleaner than they were when I clocked in - and without drying them out either.</li>
    <li> It does what I needed it to do. I have been using it for years, but it has become increasingly hard to find in the stores.</li>
    <li> Good old fashion quality! We have used this soap forever and it&#x27;s the best for what we do in the shop.</li>
    <li> Best soap ever for cleaning excessively dirty hands. If you do mechanicing, gardening, or other dirty work this will clean you right up!</li>
    <li> My husband swears by this for getting the oil and grease off his hands.  He uses it in our garage exculsively.</li>
    <li> Not only does it get rid of the dirt it wont clog your drains</li>
