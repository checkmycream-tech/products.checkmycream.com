      <li>So easy to part any kind of hair/ sections</li>
      <li>addition, they do not cause static and they are very light.</li>

      <li>I love this set of combs.</li>
      <li>I thought that red Krest ones are the best until I tried this set.</li>
      <li>and I am glad I did.  </li>
      <li>Love love love them.</li>
      <li>and I love the feel of them.  </li>
      <li>:) I would recommend buying them</li>
      <li>Got these for home haircuts, soooo much better than cheap combs...</li>
      <li>This 4 peice set was a great way to direct and set my hair do.</li>
      <li>The product feels a bit cheap, but for the price so far so good.</li>
      <li>but I&#x27;m unsure if they comb my hair any better than a $1 comb from the dollar store ;)</li>
      <li>Excellent if you want no static on your hair.</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t get a full 5 stars because on some combs, the molding that combines both sides into one shape is not flush and therefore has a raised ridge of material along the interior spine.  </li>
      <li>Will order more very soon.</li>
      <li>nice comb set ,  but comparable to most other sets.</li>
      <li>I have been doing hair for 17 years and these are by far my favorite.</li>
      <li>Have fun.</li>
      <li>I bought these combs because I tend to have a lot of static in my hair recently.  </li>
      <li>They are very high quality and give me a easy quick side part even though I am a total rookie.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Smooth teeth and grooves, no rough plastic edges to snag hair.</li>
      <li>:) I actually bought them based on other reviews - I haven&#x27;t noticed significant decrease of static or anything, but I do like having all of the different tooth sizes on hand.</li>
      <li>Very high quality combs.  </li>
      <li>Very resistent material</li>
      <li>And with four combs, you&#x27;re really getting a bargain</li>
      <li>Otherwise, these combs are very sturdy.</li>
      <li>they are very durable combs</li>
      <li>I really like these combs.</li>
      <li>They seem very well made.</li>
      <li>Compared to the other combs that I have in the house, mostly from the Dollar Store, these are very well made.</li>
      <li>My first professional stylist comb.</li>
      <li>The one comb that I have left out of the four is still great, the only reason I don&#x27;t have the other 3 is because I lost them.  </li>
      <li>I wouldn&#x27;t settle for less and see no reason to pay more.</li>
      <li>looks perfect with no effort even on the most horrible mannequins.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend.</li>
      <li>I would highly recommend them.</li>
      <li>Not only do these eliminate that problem, I recently used one of them while applying color to my hair, and I was able to part and comb my dye saturated hair, whereas my old plastic comb would just cause tangles.</li>
      <li>They are much higher quality than the standard plastic combs you find almost anywhere else.  </li>
      <li>New for me to require a comb to prepare my hair daily.</li>
      <li>I recently bought a new hairdryer that suggested using a carbon comb to finish styling.</li>
      <li>They don&#x27;t melt when used with heat, they&#x27;re heavy duty awesome for detangling, cutting, sectioning,</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m generally a brush user</li>
      <li>I have fine, thin hair and it is colored.</li>

    <li> I didn&#x27;t realize switching to carbon would make such a difference</li>
    <li> These combs are awesome! They are light weight, and are great as you do cuts</li>
    <li> New for me to require a comb to prepare my hair daily. This 4 peice set was a great way to direct and set my hair do. Works great with the Imperial Hair product. The product feels a bit cheap, but for the price so far so good.</li>
    <li> too bulky but it does its jobs</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t have loved these combs more! My stylist friend left the rat tail comb at my house for a few months and wanted it back. I mourned its loss but ordered this set. These combs keep my wavy hair from looking like a bird&#x27;s nest. I am static free and happy.</li>

    <li> I am a guy who recently decided to start styling my hair.  I needed supplies so I bought some other combs but they were too small.  After doing some research and browsing Amazon for a while I settled on these and I am glad I did.  They are very high quality and give me a easy quick side part even though I am a total rookie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do wish amazon stocked and sold the individual combs, I have no use for the strange one with the small head/skinny handle (technical term) so I gave it to my GF but I like the other 3 so I kept those for myself.</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re combs! :) I actually bought them based on other reviews - I haven&#x27;t noticed significant decrease of static or anything, but I do like having all of the different tooth sizes on hand. I&#x27;m generally a brush user but I now use these daily. They seem very good quality but I&#x27;m unsure if they comb my hair any better than a $1 comb from the dollar store ;)</li>
    <li> These combs are top salon quality!</li>

    <li> Got these for home haircuts, soooo much better than cheap combs... nice on the scalp. She likes them too because they are more sturdy and are great for Toddler&#x27;s hair too without causing a fuss.</li>
    <li> I am a cosmetology student and I tried before lots of combs. I thought that red Krest ones are the best until I tried this set. So easy to part any kind of hair/ sections looks perfect with no effort even on the most horrible mannequins. On real people is just a pleasure to use them: no pulling hair and perfect sections. LOVE THEM! Thank you Cricket!</li>
    <li> I have been doing hair for 17 years and these are by far my favorite. I would highly recommend them.</li>
    <li> Very resistent material</li>
    <li> Been using these combs for a few months now and they are great, durable and of excellent quality. Would purchase again.</li>
    <li> These are quality combs.  I would recommend these to anyone looking for heat resistant, static resistant combs.  They are flexible, yet very strong.  I think they are going to last a very long time and if they do not, I will do an update.  UPDATE: 03/16/15  The one comb that I have left out of the four is still great, the only reason I don&#x27;t have the other 3 is because I lost them.  These are great combs, as I have ordered another set!!  BUY Them!</li>
    <li> I ordered these on the recommendation of my hair stylist. I have fine, thin hair and it is colored. I seem to get breakage even though I use good products.&lt;br /&gt;I always use a comb on my hair when it is wet, but didn&#x27;t realize that my combs were tearing my hair. These just glide through tangles and knots.&lt;br /&gt;In addition, they do not cause static and they are very light. I just ordered another package for travel and my purse. No more drugstore combs for me.&lt;br /&gt;Buy them!</li>
    <li> Feels solid. Smooth teeth and grooves, no rough plastic edges to snag hair. No static. Tames cowlicks. Holds hair well, even as I reposition it or switch hands to cut. This set is a stylist must-have. I wouldn&#x27;t settle for less and see no reason to pay more.</li>
    <li> Good selection of combs and value priced.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t get a full 5 stars because on some combs, the molding that combines both sides into one shape is not flush and therefore has a raised ridge of material along the interior spine.  This can cause abrasion does not lead to smoothest combing experience.  Otherwise, these combs are very sturdy.</li>
    <li> Great price, deliver on time.</li>
    <li> Very strong and durable combs for any stylist to use. A perfect gift and a great price!</li>
    <li> Love love love them. The Best combs I&#x27;ve ever used. Will order more very soon.</li>
    <li> Works well with my flat iron. It handles the heat with no problems.</li>
    <li> I love these combs, not only for me, but when I cut my moms hair, the static from the cold made it difficult to cut my moms hair with just regular combs. These combs saved her from having a bald head! I use these to cut my hair to, mines easier then my moms, mines a blunt cut on long hair, her&#x27;s is very very short.</li>
    <li> My first professional stylist comb. Works really well, great for making super-neat parts. I use it for making neat parts for braided hairstyles..</li>
