      <li>Great natural deodorant .</li>
      <li>This oil is really good as the skin absorbs it very well.  </li>
      <li>It sprays on well and is easy to rub in.  </li>
      <li>I was told that once I started application I would sleep better, this was beyond true.  </li>
      <li>can.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For one thing, I have read that getting adequate magnesium gets you better sleep.</li>
      <li>I enjoy the benefits this oil brings.</li>
      <li>I do yoga often at night and spray this on afterward before bed and feel GREAT the next morning.</li>

      <li>Easy to put on makes the skin feel smooth and absorbs fast.  </li>
      <li>And then this article about how well your body absorbs magnesium by spreading it on your skin where your body can take it up quickly without having to go through your digestive system.</li>
      <li>I feel I have been sleeping better, and just feeling better overall.</li>
      <li>Okay - I was reading a health letter recently about how healthy magnesium is for your body, but it isn&#x27;t absorbed real well when you take it in supplement form.</li>
      <li>After 5 days a week of full body lifts my muscles are very fatigued and sore.</li>
      <li>I feel like I finally have my life back on track and am much more productive now that I am getting amazing sleep.  </li>
      <li>spray goes on easy and is completely odorless, unlike some others.  </li>
      <li>I like going to the beach very much</li>
      <li>I mainly use it about an hour before my shower in the evening so as to allow for full absorption before washing it off.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve always enjoyed taking Magnesium Salt Baths, but that can be time consuming and a big hassle.</li>
      <li>I spray it on my body just before I go to bed, so much easier!  </li>
      <li>However it can cause irritation if you use it too often as I found out when I first started using it every day.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product!!</li>
      <li>I would recommend this product to anyone who wants to experience the benefits of a pure magnesium source!</li>
      <li>I recently made a life choice to become as healthy and fit as possible.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s odorless &amp; pure and has real results.</li>
      <li>I use it before I go to sleep and have seen a huge improvement in staying asleep throughout the entire night.</li>
      <li>I tend to sleep much</li>
      <li>Have not noticed much benefit yet.</li>
      <li>Helps a lot for sore muscles, I really like it.</li>
      <li>HOWEVER, with this product,  I use it straight from the bottle and spray on my joints and muscles.</li>
      <li>I used to use a different magnesium oil which I mixed with distilled water and sprayed on calves, joints, etc when achy or having any kind of drawing or cramping in my muscles.  </li>
      <li>Also works great on the back of my neck when my usual weekly migraine starts to set in.</li>
      <li>So, I looked around Amazon and found this particular brand that is reasonably priced and it has a lot of product for your money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I have more energy since I&#x27;ve started to use it a month and a half ago and also am able to sleep easier but depending on where It, I find it may burn a little bit.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Great product, I highly recommend Magnum Solace.</li>
      <li>Highly recommended.</li>
      <li>/&gt;There are a lot of other benefits, but these are important to me.</li>
      <li>I feel like this spray provided all the benefits of a magnesium salt bath pretty much instantly.</li>
      <li>I was excited to use this; however I did not enjoy this spray as it made my whole body burn and tingle...</li>
      <li>I have an old knee injury that has been keeping me up through the night, but not anymore!</li>
      <li>I found that if I use it more than once in the same spot without washing it off, it leaves a slight residue on the skin.  </li>
      <li>There are actually about eighteen essential nutrients that contribute to bone health; Magnesium is definitely one of the most essential, because it stimulates a particular hormone called calcitonin.</li>
      <li>So far so good.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I wake up feeling refreshed and ready to tackle the next workout.</li>
      <li>Applying this product directly before bed each night has been a life saver.</li>
      <li>So far so good.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I immediately noticed a reduction in joint aches &amp; pains and the next day no cracking and popping of the joints I normally experience!  </li>
      <li>Just a few sprays on my knee, a good rub in, and alas a peaceful night.  </li>
      <li>ingredient list says nothing about any oil in the bottle, but when you spray it on your skin and then rub it in with your hands, it does have a slightly oily feel, not unpleasant.</li>
      <li>ingredient list says nothing about any oil in the bottle, but when you spray it on your skin and then rub it in with your hands, it does have a slightly oily feel, not unpleasant.</li>
      <li>I found myself having difficulty sleeping since moving across the country, starting a new job, and increasing my workout regimen.  </li>
      <li>I was deficient in magnesium and wanted a product that had the most natural ingredients.  </li>
      <li>Large quantity and will last a long time.</li>
      <li>I just do not like getting it on my bare hands .</li>
      <li>I got this due to the fact I do not have a large enough intake of magnesium.</li>
      <li>It says on the bottle that it may happen with the first few applications</li>
      <li>Your health is a lot better if you are slightly alkaline or at least neutral.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> made skin very very dry</li>
    <li> Great product!  Only used a couple days and already seeing results!  I work in an office environment sitting all day and with a long commute my body stays stiff and achy constantly.  I immediately noticed a reduction in joint aches &amp; pains and the next day no cracking and popping of the joints I normally experience!  I am sold!  I have more energy and seem more alert upon waking.  Love it and will continue purchasing.</li>
    <li> This stuff works great. I use it before I go to sleep and have seen a huge improvement in staying asleep throughout the entire night.</li>
    <li> I used Dead Sea oil the other night for the first time. I woke up before my alarm clock feeling bright eyed and bushy tailed! I haven&#x27;t slept that well in forever.</li>
    <li> Works well! Helps me sleep without having to take an epsom salt bath every night.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. I&#x27;ve always enjoyed taking Magnesium Salt Baths, but that can be time consuming and a big hassle. I feel like this spray provided all the benefits of a magnesium salt bath pretty much instantly. Would definitely recommend this to any athlete or weekend warrior.</li>
    <li> Great product! Love the easy spray disposal and I have truly noticed a difference in getting better and deeper sleep. I typically use it before bed and sleep wonderfully/wake up feeling rested.</li>
    <li> I guess it does what it&#x27;s supposed to do, but it actually dried out my skin, so I won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
    <li> I decided to try this on just my feet after it made my skin on my chest break out. It seems to be working well with muscle spasms..just a little lingering tingling and pin pricking sensation.</li>
    <li> I got this due to the fact I do not have a large enough intake of magnesium. I have more energy since I&#x27;ve started to use it a month and a half ago and also am able to sleep easier but depending on where It, I find it may burn a little bit. After putting it on it feels like I just rubbed lotion on my skin.</li>
    <li> Works great, I sleep better and have fewer muscle cramps. Does sting a little bit. Large quantity and will last a long time.</li>
    <li> I really love this - I got it for 2 purposes - my joints and to help me sleep - it has seems to help both.  My knees are better - my skin is soft and I have been getting a better nights rest since I started using this product.</li>
    <li> This oil is really good as the skin absorbs it very well.  It&#x27;s good to rub on calves  if you tend to have restless legs and also if you&#x27;re one who gets awakened in middle of nite with a &#x27;charlie horse&#x27;.  I also rub a bit on the soles of my feet and put socks on at bedtime.  I tend to sleep much better.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s oily, but not to the point of like thick like baby oil.  It&#x27;s more watery...you only need a small amount.  This is good for diabetics with neuropathy.&lt;br /&gt;This is a good, safer alternative rather than using pharma. drugs.</li>
    <li> Helps this insomniac to sleep!</li>
    <li> I like this product. It worked for me as advertized. I used it to eliminate moderate pain in the wrist and hip joints.  Two applications eliminated wrist pain and 5-6 - in the hip. I apply oil on the skin around the joint and leave it overnight.</li>
    <li> This is a sticky, do-nothing product.  The sprayer mechanism even broke after one week.  Don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
    <li> This is great stuff. I rub it on my wrists and aches fade away.</li>
    <li> Clean / Superior product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This spray goes on easy and is completely odorless, unlike some others.  I do yoga often at night and spray this on afterward before bed and feel GREAT the next morning. It sinks me into a deeper level of sleep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product, I highly recommend Magnum Solace.</li>
    <li> This is sticky stuff and I didn&#x27;t notice any relief in muscle pain that I was hoping for.</li>
    <li> Awesome product! I used to use a different magnesium oil which I mixed with distilled water and sprayed on calves, joints, etc when achy or having any kind of drawing or cramping in my muscles.  HOWEVER, with this product,  I use it straight from the bottle and spray on my joints and muscles. It is almost instantaneous relief....it also helps my achy hands.</li>
    <li> This is an outstanding mag oil.  It sprays on well and is easy to rub in.  I used to take two magnesium capsules a day, especially for sleep, and now only take one, because the oil seems to have a quicker systemic effect.  I mainly use it about an hour before my shower in the evening so as to allow for full absorption before washing it off.  I found that if I use it more than once in the same spot without washing it off, it leaves a slight residue on the skin.  Some reviewers have said that their mag oil  (unknown type) caused skin irritation, but this Dead Sea oil never did with me.  All in all, I fully recommend Magnum Solace mag oil.</li>
    <li> Easy to put on makes the skin feel smooth and absorbs fast.  No oily residue left.</li>
    <li> I found myself having difficulty sleeping since moving across the country, starting a new job, and increasing my workout regimen.  I traveled down a few avenues to try to help the problem, but nothing worked as well as Magnum Solace.  I feel like I finally have my life back on track and am much more productive now that I am getting amazing sleep.  Also, I found the spray has improved the health of my skin (it was previously dry), without having that \\&quot;oily feel.\\&quot;  Great product!</li>
    <li> Okay - I was reading a health letter recently about how healthy magnesium is for your body, but it isn&#x27;t absorbed real well when you take it in supplement form. Magnesium has several benefits I have read about that make me want to get it into my body as best I can.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For one thing, I have read that getting adequate magnesium gets you better sleep. I have always been a poor sleeper, staying up until 2-3 am in the morning and then getting up every couple hours to go to the bathroom. Then I can&#x27;t get back to sleep. Every noise in the house at night wakes me up. So, I am tired during the day, but after 68 years of living with this, I am used to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have also read that magnesium aids bone integrity and strength - Magnesium helps to fix calcium properly. It may blow some people&#x27;s mind that the calcium supplements they&#x27;re taking are not only useless, but are actually contributing to osteoporosis! There are actually about eighteen essential nutrients that contribute to bone health; Magnesium is definitely one of the most essential, because it stimulates a particular hormone called calcitonin. And, it also suppresses a hormone called parathyroid that breaks down bone. Taking calcium supplements without magnesium is setting you up for poor absorption and excess calcium in your body in the wrong places - like kidney stones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Magnesium is an alkalizer. Your health is a lot better if you are slightly alkaline or at least neutral. An acid body brings disease and sickness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are a lot of other benefits, but these are important to me. I have taken magnesium in various forms, but never seems to get the benefits I have read about. And then this article about how well your body absorbs magnesium by spreading it on your skin where your body can take it up quickly without having to go through your digestive system. So, I looked around Amazon and found this particular brand that is reasonably priced and it has a lot of product for your money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The wife and I both use it. We do 6-7 sprays on some part of the body every morning - sometimes a leg, sometimes and arm, sometimes a chest - it gets spread around.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, the reason I gave this 5-stars is that almost immediately - like the second day, the wife and I slept all night. What a deal. I can&#x27;t believe something simple like this made me sleep all night without getting up once. My wife has an overactive bladder and gets up frequently, but even her trips to the bathroom have been cut in half. So, I can attest to the fact that this stuff helps you to sleep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t taken it long enough to tell if it makes any difference in bone strength. I am hoping the de-alkalizing ability of this can help keep me healthy over the Winter. So far so good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ingredient list says nothing about any oil in the bottle, but when you spray it on your skin and then rub it in with your hands, it does have a slightly oily feel, not unpleasant. It has no odor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I will buy this again when the bottle runs out. The wife and I both use it and the sleep benefit is a pleasant surprise. The rest is gravy if it does anything else besides this..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The wife and I both use it. We do 6-7 sprays on some part of the body every morning - sometimes a leg, sometimes and arm, sometimes a chest - it gets spread around.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, the reason I gave this 5-stars is that almost immediately - like the second day, the wife and I slept all night.

So, I can attest to the fact that this stuff helps you to sleep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t taken it long enough to tell if it makes any difference in bone strength. I am hoping the de-alkalizing ability of this can help keep me healthy over the Winter. So far so good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ingredient list says nothing about any oil in the bottle, but when you spray it on your skin and then rub it in with your hands, it does have a slightly oily feel, not unpleasant. It has no odor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I will buy this again when the bottle runs out. The wife and I both use it and the sleep benefit is a pleasant surprise. The rest is gravy if it does anything else besides this.</li>
    <li> This is a very good product. I enjoy the benefits this oil brings.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like the way it feels on my skin. Have not noticed much benefit yet.</li>
    <li> I was excited to use this; however I did not enjoy this spray as it made my whole body burn and tingle... I had to get in the shower and scrub it off. It says on the bottle that it may happen with the first few applications but I&#x27;m scared to try it again..</li>
    <li> For the price, it hasn&#x27;t helped with muscle pain as expected.</li>
    <li> Nice silky feeling. I like like it. I like going to the beach very much and I was not sure why. Now I know because my body like magnesium in the ocean water. Now I spray a little on my body and it feels gooooood.</li>
    <li> In love with this product. The best and and easiest way to get in some magnesium. Love rubbing it on my ankles before bed.</li>
    <li> Great product...I have a stressful career and need magnesium to help combat the effects.  This is one of the best magnesium supplements I have found, and it doesn&#x27;t burn like some of the others I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> It did not &amp;#34;burn&amp;#34; as I heard it would. I do not know yet if it is helping my sleep and Fibromyalgia or not yet.</li>
    <li> Just started using this product, but am hopeful that it will help with my problems; very pleased with prompt delivery. Thank you.</li>
    <li> Helps a lot for sore muscles, I really like it.</li>
    <li> Great natural deodorant . Put it on your arm pits before you go to bed at night . You will not feel as nasty in the morning . Seems to help with my sleep a little . I just do not like getting it on my bare hands . I wear gloves when I rub it on . Good product for the price .</li>
    <li> I use this in the morning and at night. I feel I have been sleeping better, and just feeling better overall. The product has no smell and feel good everywhere EXCEPT my hands, but I do have issues with putting any oils on my hands, lol. Anyway, It does seem to ease muscle cramps and help me sleep.</li>
    <li> Love this product. I was deficient in magnesium and wanted a product that had the most natural ingredients.  I was told that once I started application I would sleep better, this was beyond true.  I felt like I spent a week vacationing in Belize frequenting the day spas.  This is a great product, no burn when applied, and odorless.  I would recommend this product to anyone who wants to experience the benefits of a pure magnesium source!</li>
    <li> I cannot believe how well this works! I&#x27;ve been using it for several weeks now. I have an old knee injury that has been keeping me up through the night, but not anymore! Just a few sprays on my knee, a good rub in, and alas a peaceful night.  I&#x27;ve noticed I don&#x27;t get up to use the restroom anymore either, and I seem to have a deeper sleep.  Also works great on the back of my neck when my usual weekly migraine starts to set in. Helps stop it in its tracks.  Will continue to buy!</li>
    <li> This product is amazing.</li>
    <li> I love this product!  It&#x27;s easier for me to use than taking vitamin supplements.  I ordered the magnesium oil because I have heard that magnesium is absorbed more effectively through the skin, and I do not like to take pills.  This is a great way for me to get magnesium!  I don&#x27;t have to remember to take it with a meal.  I spray it on my body just before I go to bed, so much easier!  An added benefit is that it helps me enter into a deeper sleep at night.  It also relieves my sore muscles after a hard workout.</li>
    <li> I apply this product in my arm pits. I am very active, workout daily and play sports and only have to apply it every few days. It neutralizes the arm pit odor without the use of perfumes such as chemical store bought deodorants. However it can cause irritation if you use it too often as I found out when I first started using it every day. I also noticed it did improve my sleep as well. My wife tried applying it to her psoriasis with bad results, it burned too much so I would not recommend it for that. I will also apply to my neck occasionally to relieve stiffness. The bottle goes a long way as I bought it a few months ago and have a little less than half the bottle left. I will reorder when it gets low.</li>
    <li> I recently made a life choice to become as healthy and fit as possible. Things are going well and I&#x27;m approaching the strongest I&#x27;ve ever been in my life at age 26. After 5 days a week of full body lifts my muscles are very fatigued and sore. Applying this product directly before bed each night has been a life saver. I wake up feeling refreshed and ready to tackle the next workout. It&#x27;s odorless &amp; pure and has real results. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> it is great. it works. It makes me have a good night&#x27;s sleep.</li>
    <li> I work out hard about 5 days a week so I have sore muscles and pains often. After using the Dead Sea Oil the pain is noticeable less and I sleep more soundly at night. I highly recommend this product!!</li>
