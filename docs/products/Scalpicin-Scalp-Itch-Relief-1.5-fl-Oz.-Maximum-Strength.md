      <li>My scalp was so dry,the first time i used this,was instant relief.</li>

      <li>The snag is it is the only thing that works and if all your doctor offers you</li>

<li> While it did provide instant relief from itching, it didn&#x27;t last long</li>
<li> I started to use Just Natural&#x27;s hair care products for the hair loss, scalp itch (actually made it worse), grow new hair, etc.</li>
<li> I just wanted to feel relief for as long as I could.</li>
<li> Since I&#x27;ve gotten into my senior years my skin has gotten dry.</li>
<li> Every winter, my scalp gets dry and itchy, and nothing has seemed to help.</li>
<li> This is the only thing that works to control my dandruff in the winter, but it&#x27;s not easy to find in local stores anymore.  </li>

<li> The itch relief lasts less than 24 hours.  </li>

<li> This is not available in the UK</li>
<li> I bought it a few weeks ago and used it immediately.</li>
<li> I purchased a small set of travel containers that includes a little sprayer bottle.  </li>
<li> No complaints, I use this whenever a bad case of scalp itch breaks out and it never fails.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve suffered from eczema my whole life and recently started getting very bad psoriasis on my lower legs.</li>

<li> My scalp itch has decreased to almost none existence.</li>
<li> I HAD A VERY PAINFUL ITCHY SCALP AND SAW THE COMMERCIAL OF THIS PRODUCT AND ORDER IT.</li>
<li> I have 2 itchy scabs on my head and this product makes the itching even worse!</li>
<li> I just wish it wasn&#x27;t so expensive!</li>
<li> My scalp was burning and itching so bad, i used it up in under 36 hours.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> It is great stuff!  The only product that really works on itchy scalps.</li>
    <li> Using the product as directed, my scalp itching cleared up, and the red bumps went away.  Good product for me.</li>
    <li> Since I&#x27;ve gotten into my senior years my skin has gotten dry. My scalp gets real flaky &amp; red splotches. Scalpicin really helps control the condition. I use it as needed &amp; it works great.I used to get this at Wal Mart but have been unable to recently &amp; started buying at Amazon, cheaeper.</li>
    <li> Scalpicin is the only immediate relief product that seems to work at all. I&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;manage to deal with the problem for good after a few months of experimenting with various shampoos and other treatments. But in the mean time Scalpicin stopped me from scratching my skin off!</li>
    <li> keeps my psoriasis calm on the scalp</li>
    <li> A great product to control itchy scalp!</li>
    <li> No complaints, I use this whenever a bad case of scalp itch breaks out and it never fails. I will be ordering this again.</li>
    <li> after reading review after review I thought this was finally my solution. have been using it for over a week and my head still itches!</li>
    <li> I did not believe the hype until I tore open the package, read the directions, and applied the liquid.  The relief was instantaneous!</li>
    <li> this product works very good. I have had a small itchy spot on my scalp for the last  17 years and  this helps it.&lt;br /&gt;I  apply it twice a week .</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Scalpicin off and on for many years, and they have been using the same &amp;#34;delivery&amp;#34; system (same container) for the entire time.  It comes in a little bottle, and you squeeze it out, and too much always comes out (the idea of it maybe?).  But it&#x27;s too good a product to not purchase because of that, so I&#x27;ve found my own solution.  I purchased a small set of travel containers that includes a little sprayer bottle.  I empty the contents of the Scalpicin bottle into the spray bottle, and VOILA! I have a wonderful delivery system that delivers just the right amount of Scalpicin to any area on my head that needs it.  No extra Scalpicin seeps out and oversaturates or drips down my face.  It&#x27;s a truly wonderful product and with this little modification, it&#x27;s perfect.  The itch goes away almost immediately and I&#x27;m free of it for the entire day.  I very highly recommend Scalpicin to anyone with a scalp itch problem that isn&#x27;t caused by untreated dandruff or psoriasis.  Sometimes your head just itches and Scalpicin is the answer</li>
    <li> Every winter, my scalp gets dry and itchy, and nothing has seemed to help. I had read that brown sugar scrubs (brown sugar mixed into some conditioner with a few drops of tea tree oil) would help, so I&#x27;ve been using those once a week, but I wasn&#x27;t getting any long-term relief.  Someone on a hair-care forum recommended this, and, after just one use, it cleared up all my winter itchies!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The liquid comes out pretty thin, and it&#x27;s fairly easy to distribute through your scalp by pouring a bit out and using your fingers to rub it around.  Although the label says that you can apply this in the morning or night, I applied it at night and went to sleep with it in my hair.  It made my roots a bit greasy-looking, but mostly that was because I had the spout open a bit too much and used more than I probably should have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can use it up to six days in a row, before you need to take a break from it. As I mentioned above, I found relief after just one use, and the hydrocortisone in it calmed my itch right down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s also Curly-Girl-friendly, for those following a no-silicone, no-sulfate routine.  (The &#x27;cone it has is water-soluble.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this works really well, and I wish I heard of this product years ago.</li>
    <li> I RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT.. I HAD A VERY PAINFUL ITCHY SCALP AND SAW THE COMMERCIAL OF THIS PRODUCT AND ORDER IT. I HAVE NOT BEEN BOTHERED WITH THIS CONDITION SINCE USING THIS PRODUCT. I STILL HAVE A HALF OF  BOTTLE LEFT.</li>
    <li> This product works great. I&#x27;ve suffered from eczema my whole life and recently started getting very bad psoriasis on my lower legs. This has been the second day using it and already my skin is starting to clear. I&#x27;m sure it will take a few more days, but I&#x27;m amazed. It is the first product that has given me hope</li>
    <li> This stuff is like magic in a bottle.  It is wonderful for a itchy scalp and works fast.  I just wish it wasn&#x27;t so expensive!</li>
    <li> It works. Really noticed a difference from the knock offs at places like CVS.</li>
    <li> a product i use regularly for itchy scalp- does the job</li>
    <li> This is the only thing that works to control my dandruff in the winter, but it&#x27;s not easy to find in local stores anymore.  Thank you, thank you, thank you!</li>
    <li> i dont think it works for me. after i wash my hair it work for the first day or 2 when using often but it does not last or work for me</li>
    <li> I really like this.My scalp was so dry,the first time i used this,was instant relief.Cleared up my scalp.Thank you so much!</li>
    <li> This works in seconds. The snag is it is the only thing that works and if all your doctor offers you you is coal tar products that are cheap what then? This is not available in the UK so we have to put up with the cheap stuff that does not work or go on Amazon.</li>
    <li> I bought this product to help with an itchy scalp due to having a weave and it helps a lot. You put it on your scalp and the itch stops immediately.</li>
    <li> Thanks for sharing the reviews on this product. I bought it a few weeks ago and used it immediately. My scalp itch has decreased to almost none existence. I love it.</li>
    <li> But I do not know if it gets rid of the main issue (whatever it is that you may have.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used almost half of the bottle (it is small and even think a bit expensive.) The itching has subsided, that I have noticed.</li>
    <li> 11 months ago, I underwent an unavoidable surgery. Immediately after the surgery a huge hormone shift took place and I had an intensely burning and itching scalp. 3 months later, my hair began to fall out and hasn&#x27;t stopped. I started to use Just Natural&#x27;s hair care products for the hair loss, scalp itch (actually made it worse), grow new hair, etc. Nothing stopped my severe burning, itching scalp. I would get temporary relief with applications of allergy eye drops on my scalp and allergy pills.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Last week, from a local pharmacy, I bought this product. I picked out of all the others because it does not treat dandruff and it was a treatment, not a shampoo or conditioner. My scalp was burning and itching so bad, i used it up in under 36 hours. Then I woke up the next day and nothing. My scalp was fine? How could that be? I didn&#x27;t trust it. 11 months of agony and i wasn&#x27;t done needing to pour this stuff on my head the night before, but I ran out. The severe burning and itching miraculously stopped. Since I wash my hair every other day, I refused to wash this stuff out. I just wanted to feel relief for as long as I could. Well I skipped more days then that. My scalp felt wonderful. Then it was time to wash my hair. I dreaded it. I did the normal Just Natural treatment, which never relieved it and I feared it fueled it, but I survived. It&#x27;s one week now and I only used that 1st Scalpicin bottle and after 11 months of agony...severe burning, itching scalp, I finally have relief. Even if I don&#x27;t trust it is permanent (thus looking to buy more of this stuff), I am savoring every peaceful, burning-and-itch-free moment I am having since practically the start of 2012.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you Reckitt Benckiser!</li>
    <li> The itch relief lasts less than 24 hours.  Since the product does nothing to eliminate the underlying cause of the itching, reapplication is inevitable.  Have to wonder why it isn&#x27;t offered in bulk.  Next step: investigate pet products for more economical solution.</li>
    <li> I have 2 itchy scabs on my head and this product makes the itching even worse! It&#x27;s already a nonstop itch, but this stuff makes it even more itchy! I&#x27;m never using this again and would never recommend it to anyone!</li>
    <li> Ineffective for my problem</li>
    <li> Relieve itchy scalp.  Also found it to work on the top of my ears which also itch frequently.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for an OTC solution to my scalp psoriasis and I&#x27;m not sure this is it. While it did provide instant relief from itching, it didn&#x27;t last long and I feel like it ended up making my scalp even more dry. Neutrogena TGel and TSal are far better OTC remedies.</li>
    <li> This product is a life saver for anyone plagued with an itchy scaly scalp!  I have used it for years and can&#x27;t live (comfortably) without it.  I wish it was cheaper, too, but it&#x27;s worth its price because its the only product that helps my condition.</li>
