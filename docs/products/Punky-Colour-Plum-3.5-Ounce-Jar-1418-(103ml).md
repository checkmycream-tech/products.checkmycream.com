      <li>No, the smell doesn&#x27;t stay in your hair after shampooing but it makes for a pleasant dye experience.</li>
      <li>to work with, pleasant smell, no burning.</li>
      <li>the bright colour I wanted</li>
      <li>It was sealed and arrived in good shape.</li>
      <li>I suspect the over-concetration of pigment is to blame, even if it makes a good color on your hair.</li>
      <li>I recommend rinsing your face after dyeing but wait till after washing to use the pads, because a surprising amount of dye comes out of your skin in the shower too.</li>
      <li>Punky Colours was cheaper, and I had heard good things about it, so I decided to try it out.&lt;br /&gt;Plum</li>
      <li>I bought Poison Plum and it&#x27;s gorgeous</li>

      <li>LOVE the color!</li>
      <li>and it is a color that will probably always be my favorite to have!</li>
      <li>I absolutely love this product, and don&#x27;t think I will be using another semi-temp dye any time soon!</li>
      <li>What&#x27;s not to love?!</li>
      <li>I used the Violet and it really is a beautiful and rich color.</li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re using it on non-bleached or darker hair, don&#x27;t expect a bright color: you&#x27;ll probably end up with more of a tint than anything.</li>
      <li>With MUCH research online, looking at pictures, and youtube videos, I decided that this colour would be the best one to go with.</li>
      <li>I wanted my hair purple for awhile, so I decided to give this dye a try &amp; experimented with my own ideas.</li>
      <li>and I get lots of nice comments and compliments on my purple hair.</li>
      <li>I liked the outcome</li>
      <li>It didn&#x27;t cause any noticeable damage to my hair, which was nice as well.</li>
      <li>in all this was a nice experience.</li>
      <li>It is a vibrant and brilliant color, I am really impressed and worth buying.</li>
      <li>It has a great smell and doesn&#x27;t bleed as much as special effects, but the color isn&#x27;t quite as amazing.</li>
      <li>) leave in conditioner when I am in the shower to keep my color looking vibrant and it works great!  </li>
      <li>It also bleached very easily out of my hair.</li>
      <li>Altogether, awesome product, I love it, highly recommended.</li>
      <li>It fades fast but is brilliant for a couple washes</li>
      <li>It smells good too, and the consistency is really easy to work with; just make sure you apply it well to get every strand.</li>
      <li>I love the color its so pretty and bright!</li>
      <li>The color is rich and true, the grape scent (for plum color) makes it deliciously tolerable to use, and it rinses out easily.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t bleach my hair but the color was very light on my hair.</li>
      <li>, so the good stuff: First thing you notice is the amazing smell.</li>
      <li>After rinsing and conditioning her hair was left with a beautiful purple color that she totally loved.  </li>
      <li>but with every wash the color is showing more.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> best purple dye around! will be buying again!</li>
    <li> When I first reviewed Punky brand hair colors a few years ago, I actually gave it a 5 star rating and was happy with the lasting power of the color. However, when I recently tried it again, I was very disappointed. I used the Violet and it really is a beautiful and rich color. However, it washed out in under a week!  I don&#x27;t know if their formula changed or my expectations have, but it did not hold up at all.  I have been coloring my hair purple for years now and have tried a bunch of different brands in that time, but I would have to say that Punky is the worst I&#x27;ve tried when it comes to durability. I tend to only wash my hair a couple times a week, but the color was completely gone from my bangs before the second washing. I do lighten my dark brown hair before coloring, so it is very obvious when the purple is gone. And it wasn&#x27;t just faded, it was gone!  As for all of the other points that people ask about such as staining, etc. it is no worse or better than other products. If you are going to color your hair using any of the &amp;#34;unnatural&amp;#34; shades, you can pretty much count on bleach and magic erasers becoming your best friends for cleaning up after your done.  Make sure you have latex gloves and cover all surfaces because anything the dye comes in contact with will be stained. Then the color will continue to come off on your pillowcase, your clothes, your hands and your towels for at least a week. Again, this is par for the process no matter which brand you use and something you will have to decide whether you are willing to put up with in exchange for lovely, eye catching hair.  Anyway, I definitely will not be purchasing Punky brand again, which is disappointing because it is so readily available in stores without having to order online.</li>
    <li> as with most purple dyes, they don&#x27;t stick very well in my hair (i have been bleaching/ dying my hair for about 5 years, so it&#x27;s not user error). this dye is probably my second choice after special effects. the color is way better than any of the special effects (they all start reeaally dark, but fade fast enough that it&#x27;s not a huge issue- although i&#x27;ve had some of the special effects purples fade to greenish) and it smells great. the consistency is also great for application, especially if you&#x27;re foiling to do highlights/ streaks, it stays in place, so you have a chance to wrap it up. overall, a good product, but i&#x27;ll have to stick with atomic pink by special effects because that stays in my hair for MONTHS (like up to 6) and fades to really nice pink shades.</li>
    <li> Far better color than anything else you can find anywhere. Not to mention it actually lasts more than a week! Both of those as well as the price makes this stuff a no-brainer!! Have fun, enjoy the colors! And the purple stuff smells like crazy grape kool-aid!! lol</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s alright, but not great. It did not leave my hair smooth, considering I had to spend a good 35-45 minutes in the shower doing various rinse outs with shampoo. I then used a conditioner which I left in for a while, merely because my hair felt like hay. I did not bleach it, as I wanted to only get a tint in the sun.</li>
    <li> shipping was fast.. but im disappointed in the results. I did not bleach my hair before hand.. which i should have done.. so my roots and some of my hair is a beautiful shade of purple.. then the rest is a very dark black.. and it REALLY DOES STAIN skin.. toook me two hours to scrub the purple off my face.. but I would deffently use the product again.. I would just follow the directions exactly this time.. and I LOVED THE WAY IT SMELLES... over all im happy with the purchase and will deffently recomend it to friends...cant wait to try a blue color...</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had my hair a multitude of different colors over the years, and my favorite was always this color.  I was so sad when my local beauty supply chain stopped carrying this line (back when it was still in a squeeze tube).  I&#x27;m so excited that it&#x27;s available relatively inexpensively online, as I&#x27;ve just recently gone back to purple (it was always my color :-P)</li>
    <li> What a beautiful color! Definitely lasts longer than manic panic and fades beautifully! Will definitely be ordering this brand again.</li>
    <li> Smells good! It&#x27;s a little more of a &amp;#34;truer&amp;#34; purple than their Purple. I like to use this along with Violet.&lt;br /&gt;Be careful they do stain. I&#x27;ve used bleach and/or acetone (sepearately!)  to clean up any stains in the bathroom.&lt;br /&gt;If you follow the baics: have freshly cleaned dry hair (best to use a clarifying shampoo), leave the color on as long as you can, wash with cool water (with as little, a gentle shampoo, you can find). It does last me almost a week before I really need to refresh it. If you use some mixed with conditioner when you shower, then you may be fine for a bit more.  My hair is not bleached, but I am going grey. This is a fun way to hide that, and to allow me to stop using the stronger pemanent hair colors, for now.&lt;br /&gt;Just wish these &amp;#34;fun&amp;#34; colors lasted as long as the box stuff.</li>
    <li> This dye REALLY attached to my hair. I dyed one part of a lightened portion of my hair, and when I washed it out it bled into other lightened parts and stained them. It actually looked nice so I was ok with it. But I didn&#x27;t think it would be so fade-resistant. I was prepared for it to fade a lot more easily, because I wanted it to fade to a grey, but its really stuck in my hair. Soooooooo yeah, THINK A LOT BEFORE YOU DYE WITH THIS. It&#x27;s practically a permanent dye if you use a gentle shampoo and purple conditioner. I gave it 4 stars, though, because I think it would be good for people who actually don&#x27;t want it to fade. But it wasn&#x27;t a &amp;#34;plum&amp;#34; color. I was expecting more blue in the color, but it was more of a dark magenta, which was annoying. But it&#x27;s still purple. I will definitely be using this again (albeit CAREFULLY). Mostly just for toning, though.</li>
    <li> Long lasting, vibrant color. I get endless compliments when I use this brand.&lt;br /&gt;Easy to work with, pleasant smell, no burning.</li>
    <li> This is the best hair color in the \\&quot;non-natural color\\&quot; line that I have found.  It is long lasting, even more so if combined with L&#x27;anza brand Trauma Treatment leave-in conditioner.  The color is vibrant and \\&quot;Plum\\&quot; is more of a true purple, whereas \\&quot;Purple\\&quot; is more on the pink end, with \\&quot;Violet\\&quot; more on the blue end.      Be warned, it will stain EVERYTHING!  For the first week after application, be careful what you wear as it will stain the back of the neck of any shirt you wear and put a towel over your pillowcase or it will stain too.  The good thing is, if it&#x27;s white, bleach will take it right out.  Also, use Easyoff Kaboom bathroom cleaner on your sink and shower, and you will never know that it was once purple/blue/red/green...  To me it&#x27;s worth it to have such an incredible color, I receive compliments everyday from complete strangers!</li>
    <li> I LOVE this dye! First off, I had bought the SPLAT purple bleach and dye kit and gotten less than stellar results. I actually came out more pink than purple and rather spotty...so, I emergency ordered a bottle of this beauty to fix it up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Okay, so the good stuff: First thing you notice is the amazing smell. It smells like grape soda! Second, it is the perfect consistency. You can work it thru your hair no problem, and it doesn&#x27;t drip at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To get my color to come out, I started by using a basic soap to get all the product out, let it dye, and then applied the dye. I left it in for about 6 hours. After rinsing, I had hands down the best purple color I&#x27;ve ever gotten. On bleached hair, you get a deep, deep beautiful purple (kinda looks like grape soda actually...hmm) and it doesn&#x27;t look overly shiny like some dyes do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this product, I will never bye another brand...I&#x27;m totally sold!</li>
    <li> I love this color. Turned out a true purple, almost exactly the color on the label. I have light brown hair and the color turned out the same on my natural color as on the hair I bleached first. after applying I used a straightening iron on it (a Paul Mitchell tip I picked up)to heat set it and I didn&#x27;t rinse/wash it until the next day. Perfect results. And of course it stains everything it touches, that&#x27;s what a dye is supposed to do! I had no trouble at all cleaning it off the sink, counter and floor using just a little cleanser. I didn&#x27;t have the bathtub staining problems some people reported, it all washed down the drain just fine but I would assume the cleanser work on the tub just as well. This is nice and thick, making it easy to apply exactly where you want it without it running down your face and neck. I will never buy another brand of color.</li>
    <li> This dye resulted in a really lovely purple color, but I&#x27;m giving it only 4 stars for a couple reasons. First, as others have noted, it bleeds for quite some time after you first use it. I&#x27;ve been using old towels to dry my hair after showers and to wrap around my pillow at night so I don&#x27;t stain my pillowcase. Also I&#x27;ve been wearing dark clothes to make sure they don&#x27;t get stained either. Not much of an issue, but slightly annoying. I also have hair that goes just past my shoulders, but it&#x27;s thick and curly, and the amount of dye in this was just barely enough to cover everything--it almost wasn&#x27;t enough, but I was able to comb it through to the ends. Lastly, It&#x27;s only be about 5 days--that&#x27;s 3 showers--and the color has noticeably faded already, but not a whole lot, and the color it&#x27;s fading to is still a nice color, so I&#x27;m not concerned. All in all, worth your money.</li>
    <li> I absolutly love this stuff. The plum made my hair a beautiful shade of purple that i was constatnly complimented on. The dye also smells delicious, like grapes or something.    Only negative thing i have to say about it is that it stained my bathtub..pillows..and boyfriends arm. But it took forever to fade in my hair. I wont use anything else ever again</li>
    <li> Great color! Very vibrant</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had purple hair for 5 years, and have been using this brand of colour for nearly 3 of them.&lt;br /&gt;This is the deepest, most vibrant and most conditioning product of all that I have tried. It really permeates the hair shaft and leaves a glossy sheen. It fades depending on how porous your hair is, what you wash it with and how often. The only downside (which doesn&#x27;t bother me at all) is that it can bleed. White or light tees may absorb some of the colour, as do pillowcases. But after all the colour lost to fabric still leaves loads of funky, punky colour for your hair! Also very gentle and non-damaging, it smells akin to grape soda or grape drink mix powder.&lt;br /&gt;Manic Panic, Special Effex and other brands can&#x27;t compete or compare to this amazing product. And I have tried many a brand looking for the best all-over purple colour.&lt;br /&gt;Please, give this a try!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughter.  She wanted streaks in her hair and I didn&#x27;t see the point in buying something that would wash right out.  I did some research and this product got pretty good reviews so this is what I decided to use.  I washed her hair right before and did not condition.  I dried her hair and then added this product.  My daughter has non treated dirty blonde hair.  I left this product on for an hour.  Using heat from the dryer to help it stain the hair.  After rinsing and conditioning her hair was left with a beautiful purple color that she totally loved.  It lasted 1 shower.  Now you can barely see it!!  It went from this vibrant purple to barely there!!  Totally disappointed!</li>
    <li> I love this color soo much, that I have bought it twice! This color is very nice on my virgin, dark brown hair, and it smells good too. I have shoulder lenth hair, and it took me less than half the bottle to dye my whole head. And the end product was beautiful! It does come out a lot a lot when showering, so be prepared to bleach out your tub! And it does bleed onto pillow cases (and my face haha) while sleeping, so be prepared for that too. Two weeks I washed my hair, almost every day too, and this color didn&#x27;t even budge! I absolutely love this product, and don&#x27;t think I will be using another semi-temp dye any time soon!</li>
    <li> This is the only temp hair color that seems to stay in longer than a week. Gives deep, rich color saturation too. The best brand out there!</li>
    <li> If you are into hair colors this Plum (Blue Purple) is for you. The Cream is really rich and thick. The staining effect of this Semi Permanent Cream is wonderful. I have washed my hair over 4 times now and the color is still brilliant. Other brands of purple would have already faded and turn bright reddish purple. With this brand and color of Plum it keeps the purple in the bluish range.  It is a vibrant and brilliant color, I am really impressed and worth buying.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite purple dye. Plum turns like.....crayon purple. I know this company also makes &amp;#34;purple&amp;#34; but it&#x27;s too red, and &amp;#34;violet&amp;#34; which turns blue. I&#x27;ve been using plum for 13 years or so and it&#x27;s always the perfect shade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pic of my hair is Ion Lavender fading to this Punky Professional Plum, fading to Ion Aqua.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t damage hair like other hair dyes, and its a beautiful color! Smells delicious!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been dying my hair different colors for 6 years or so and this is by far my favorite color. Punky Colours stays in the longest out of any other brand of semi permanent hair dye I&#x27;ve used. It stays in for about a month but even then, it fades to a nice light purple. As long as you bleach your hair to almost white you shouldn&#x27;t see any blue.    And yes, like the other person said, purple turns a pink/purple, and violet turns a blue/purple, plum is just purple.   So if you&#x27;re going for purple this is the best choice.</li>
    <li> I have very dark hair and I left the product (plum color) in for 7 hours and it only lasted for about two weeks. Now my hair, after about four weeks, has a slight plum tint.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t bleach my hair but the color was very light on my hair. Rinsed and it does stain tub and clothes.  Dried my hair with dryer and ended up with plum hands.  Does not clump hair like other brands.  It may work better on light hair just beware of stains!</li>
    <li> My sister had tried a few different purple dyes and they all failed miserably. but this dye actually worked and lasts about a monthon her</li>
    <li> What&#x27;s not to love?! It may be semi-permanent, but it&#x27;s long lasting! Sure it &amp;#34;fades,&amp;#34; but does it really? To me, faded is when the color LOOKS like it&#x27;s going away, and starts to look like it was supposed to be another color. But punky colour plum, started out a super vibrant dark purple, and while it&#x27;s a lighter magenta color now, it still looks very vibrant like that&#x27;s the color it was just dyed. Plus, it smells like grapes!! I originally tried a manic panic purple, and while it was great when first rinsed.... one wash and it was grey!! Jerome Russell on the other hand, &#x27;ve been through several washes, for several weeks and it still looks great (even though it&#x27;s lighter) and I will continue to use this product for time to come! :)</li>
    <li> Smells great, super creamy, great lasting power. Application is a breeze. Definitely suggest this to everyone who is looking to dye their hair a crazy color.</li>
    <li> i dont have much experience with other hair dyes but this is the best that ive hear of and smells wonderful. But like anyother &#x27;&#x27;bright&#x27;&#x27; hair color u must bleach or lighten your hair if its too dark.</li>
    <li> I have been dying my daughter&#x27;s hair various colors for the past few years. We have tried many different brands and, I can easily say, I like this one best. The color is rich and true, the grape scent (for plum color) makes it deliciously tolerable to use, and it rinses out easily. The only thing is I wish they would have somehow included a brush for application. We didn&#x27;t have anything to apply it with so I used an old Sonicare toothbrush head, which worked fine but was a bit tedious.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My daughter&#x27;s hair is a dark blonde/light dusty brown color and we did not bleach it first. The color took surprisingly well and it is very obvious! Other brands have not covered as fully as this or looked quite as rich. I will continue to try other colors in this brand and, I hope, they will turn out equally well so I can be done with brand hopping for now.</li>
    <li> I have maroon purple hair and I mix this with my natural (non chemically based) leave in conditioner when I am in the shower to keep my color looking vibrant and it works great!  Perfect for keeping a plum sheen when you have already dyed hair!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using these Jerome Russell Punky Colour products for almost three years now and I only have good things to say about them! I&#x27;ve used the red, pink, and now the plum colors and they are all very vibrant and long-lasting. I tried the pink manic panic when I ran out of this and was very disappointed; it looked good but didn&#x27;t last half as long! They are pretty messy but as long as you clean your tub right after you dye your hair and use shampoo or some nail polish remover to get the dye off your skin its not too much of a problem. I would recommend these to anyone daring enough to try the crazy colors!</li>
    <li> This is an absolutely horrible product. Although it did not show up very well in my daughter&#x27;s hair, it certainly made up for it all over the house. Even after six washings, it was still staining my towels. In addition it ran all over my shower curtain and worse yet, my shower walls and tub.</li>
    <li> I dye my hair a lot! I&#x27;ve had pretty much every color and brand. I love punky colour! Not only does it stay the longest but it doesn&#x27;t stain a lot like manic panic. It&#x27;s my new go to dye.</li>
    <li> It fades fast but is brilliant for a couple washes</li>
    <li> Like it.....but not the same shade as my older tube</li>
    <li> It was a little thick to spread on. But it smells really good and the color last forever.  It does not bleed like most colors. Definitely worth the money.</li>
    <li> This dye is so strong it will never fully come out of your hair. Downside: it will literally never fully come out of your hair</li>
    <li> I love this brand so much. I discovered it at ULTA and to my disappointment soon after they decided to no longer carry it at my local place.&lt;br /&gt;The one thing to note about this that doesn&#x27;t bother me much is that THIS STAINS EVERYTHING! your hands, the bath, EVERYTHING. I just use gloves and spray my tub down with bleach afterwards and everything&#x27;s back to how it was.&lt;br /&gt;I do not bleach my hair, so the color Plum, that I decided to try out does not show up vibrantly, it&#x27;s more of a reddish subtle purple that I really like. Red Wine was the one I previously used and will probably stick to after is. The red is so vibrant it completely transforms my dark brown hair to bright red.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s worth a try if you want a bright color that lasts for a few months and don&#x27;t mind cleaning up afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;(It&#x27;s also wonderful because it smells great and is a vegetable dye, therefore doesn&#x27;t use harsh chemicals and doesn&#x27;t harm your hair!)</li>
    <li> The color is fantastic and it stays strong in my hair for a very long time. I&#x27;ve never had it fade into an ugly tone.</li>
    <li> i tryed on my dark brown hair but there is no change ,may be hair need to be bleached before dying.</li>
    <li> doesn&#x27;t last long but has a very beautiful color. Be careful not to get it anywhere and use Vaseline around your skin on your ears and forehead and back of your neck or you will look like an oompa-loompa for a few days.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used exotic color dyes since the early 90&#x27;s, back when Punky was one of only a few brand choices out there.  Many more have popped up in the years since, and I&#x27;ve tried several, but this is still the best.  Here&#x27;s why:&lt;br /&gt;1. Vivid color.  So many of the others turn out dull and/or paler than what they advertise, even BEFORE a couple shampoos.  Punky is BAM bright and deep (downright jewel-like) and much longer lasting.  Of course like all dyes, you have to first bleach your hair to at least a lighter color than the dye, to get the best effect.  So why go through all the expense, effort, burning scalp, bleach spots on clothes, and especially hair texture damage, only to get a pale, sad color that disappears right away?  Don&#x27;t bother--just get Punky and be happy.&lt;br /&gt;2. Speaking of texture, this stuff drastically repairs and conditions.  At least on my hair, it virtually erases the damage of the pre-lightening bleach, and the effect lasts right along with the color.  I don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s in it that makes it such an amazing conditioner or how it stays even after many shampoos, butI know what&#x27;s NOT in it: ammonia.  A couple of the exotic color brands I&#x27;ve tried actually fried my hair worse than bleach!  I wish Punky offered a colorless product of whatever non-pigment ingredients make so such magic, because I would just go ahead and apply it a couple times a month no matter what my color is. I&#x27;m not exaggerating; it&#x27;s better than any hot oils or other supposed intensive conditioners I&#x27;ve ever tried.&lt;br /&gt;3. Small point, but--it smells heavenly.  Fruity.  Some say like grape cool-aid and I guess that&#x27;s about right.  No, the smell doesn&#x27;t stay in your hair after shampooing but it makes for a pleasant dye experience. (Definitely better than ammonia, lol!)&lt;br /&gt;4. From my experiments I found I could mix colors and they came out exactly as I hoped.  I tried this with another brand and the two colors had distinctly different cream consistencies so they wouldn&#x27;t even really mix in the bowl.  I tried to apply the &amp;#34;mixture&amp;#34; anyway and one color totally blocked the other.&lt;br /&gt;Alright so the only complaint I have (are you reading, Jerome Russell?) is this: I don&#x27;t know why they went back to the screw-top jar.  For a while there, they switched to a squeezable tube (plastic, not metal) and I was so glad.  Now it&#x27;s back to the jar--why???  The less handling of a potentially disastrous mess, when you&#x27;re wearing gloves all coated in the slippery stuff, the better.  I wish they&#x27;d go back to the tube, and this time with a flip-top cap (best design for ALL hair/soap/lotion/wet-hands-eyes-squeezed-shut-water-everywhere products--am I right?).</li>
    <li> The Hair Dye Ran Out Of My Hair Withing Two Weeks</li>
    <li> Works like a charm! Super easy to use!</li>
    <li> I did some research before deciding on punky colour. I only colored the ends of my hair, but I bleached it before coloring it. The result was awesome, such a pretty color! It smells good too, and the consistency is really easy to work with; just make sure you apply it well to get every strand. It did stain my sink a bit but it came off with alcohol! It didn&#x27;t stain my clothes as far as I&#x27;ve noticed. I already purchased my second tub of this because I want to retouch my hair. The purple color lasts for about a week and a half, but I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;ll last longer if you wash your hair less. I also rinse it with really really cold water. The color has faded into a magenta-ish tone which I actually really like. I definitely would recommend jerome russell&#x27;s punky color!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a hairstylist &amp; love trying out different brands. I have tried a lot of diff brands &amp; I have to say that punky floors have always lasted a very long time &amp; they don&#x27;t damage your hair. I&#x27;ve tried flamingo pink, blue lagoon, firehouse red &amp; I absolutely love the plum,  violet &amp; purple. A tip so your Colorado lasts long &amp; doesn&#x27;t transfer to your clothes as much is to wash your hair after bleaching without using conditioner,  blow dry it then apply the Color &amp; cover hair with a shower cap. Then run hairdryer over showercap for a few minutes to ope up the pores on your hair so it will absorb the Colorado better,  then wait 45mins to an hour . Proceed to rinse it out with cool water then towel dry &amp; apply a deep conditioning mask &amp; repeat the shower cap and blowdryg process,  leave treatment in for up to 30 mine then ri se withcool water &amp; your Colorado should last a long while &amp; feel healthy. Hope the tip helps</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been a loyal user of this dye for a really long time now, I think I&#x27;ve ordered at least 6 of these in the past 6 months xD But this time around the shipping was incredibly slow (I STILL don&#x27;t have it) and I really needed it today so I could redye my hair before a concert I&#x27;m going to tonight. Sigh. I&#x27;m mostly disappointed because in the past I&#x27;ve received my orders within 4 days of placing them, and it&#x27;s been a week. Oh well. I&#x27;d recommend this product to anyone wanting perfectly purple hair, but if you need it fast, use another seller :/</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Jerome Russell Punky Semi-Permanent Colour Cream Plum for a couple years now. I absolutely love this color and I get lots of nice comments and compliments on my purple hair. This seems to be the darkest shade of purple offered by Punky. When it goes on, it looks too red, but it comes out a nice purple. I also appreciate the light grape smell instead of an icky chemical smell. Although Punky dyes seem to bleed a bit longer than some of the other brands, I think it&#x27;s because they also last longer than the other brands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As with all Semi-Permanent colors, it never lasts as long as I wish it would, but it lasts longer than most other brands I&#x27;ve tried. I use [[ASIN:B005PUZOJW Color Protect Daily Shampoo by Paul Mitchell for Unisex - 33.8 oz Shampoo]] and [[ASIN:B000N5S0KE Batiste Dry Shampoo Original, 5.05 oz]] to help keep the color going longer and it really helps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plus, you can&#x27;t beat the price. &#x3D;]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To help your color last as long as possible:&lt;br /&gt;- wash/rinse your hair in cool/cold water [just like protecting your colors in your laundry]&lt;br /&gt;- use quality color-protect shampoo/conditioner&lt;br /&gt;- don&#x27;t wet wash your hair too often and use a dry/spray shampoo in between wet washes&lt;br /&gt;- stay away from any products with Tea Tree Oil as they will strip your color</li>
    <li> I bought the hair dye just to try it out for once and it came out so pretty. I started buying this every month. I recamend this item to those who want long lasting color.</li>
    <li> I have naturally very light blonde hair, and this color never washed out all the way. After it washed out about 75% of the way, it stopped coming out, and my hair remained a gross light-brownish-purple in ugly patches on my head for several months. I can&#x27;t say this was the company&#x27;s fault because I had been warned many times that this could happen to people with light blonde hair, but other brands I&#x27;ve used have washed out fully within a few weeks (e.g. manic panic). However, the color did look vibrant and pretty when I first dyed it, and if you don&#x27;t have light hair, you probably have nothing to worry about.</li>
    <li> This is not even &amp;#34; SEMI PERMANENT&amp;#34; it&#x27;s only TEMPORARY! I dyed my boyfriends hair with this product and it only lasted a freaking WEEK!  i  get what i pay for CHEAP CHEAP CHEAP!</li>
    <li> I was looking to colour my hair a dark plum/purple colour. I have used box colour and also professional hair colour tubes, and never achieved the look I was going for. So I decided to take a chance and try this. With MUCH research online, looking at pictures, and youtube videos, I decided that this colour would be the best one to go with. I received my package in the time frame that was stated. It was wrapped pretty well. There was bubble wrap around it, and if I remember correctly it came in an envelope. It was sealed and arrived in good shape. I didn&#x27;t want to bleach my hair first, because my hair is pretty damaged to begin with, from colouring my hair, and also using a hair dryer and straightener. When I opened it up, I loved the colour immediately. It definitely has an artificial grape smell, but I kinda liked it. My hair colour was a faded redish-burgundy-plum colour to begin with. I put it on my whole head, and left it on for a few hours. (about 2-2 1/2 hrs.) I really wanted it to soak in. I also used a little bit of heat from my hair dryer to help set it in. Be careful about touching anything, it will turn it purple. (just use some bleach or a magic eraser to get it off surfaces, and if it is on your skin, I like makeup remover towelettes, or those acne pads) I washed it out and was so HAPPY with the colour! It came out better than expected! When I am inside, its dark, but you can tell that it&#x27;s plum. Outside, it is a beautiful shade of plum purple, and when in the sun,bright! I love it, and will continue to use this product. I coloured my hair about a week and a half ago, and it is still as beautiful as the first day. I&#x27;ve washed it maybe 3 times, and always use a shampoo and conditioner that is meant for coloured hair, and the main thing is to wash it in cold water! Thank you for your fast and efficient service. I would recommend this to anyone that is looking for a dark plum/purple colour.  Also works great on non-bleached hair. Hope this helps answer anyone&#x27;s questions!ne&#x27;s questions!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this colour. Only wish it would be available in permanent. ...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Goes in easy, stays vibrant and gorgeous,  also changes to am hombre look about 3 weeks in&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend this product line</li>
    <li> Jerome Russel Punky Colour Plum!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shipping was fast!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the first unnatural color I dyed my hair and it is a color that will probably always be my favorite to have! &amp;#60;3 The pictures are back from March to April 2014 when I first dyed it. I was constantly get compliments on my hair. I only had to bleach my hair once (my hair was blonde, yellow, and orange in certain places) to achieve this beautiful purple hair. I left it on overnight too. Now this stuff does stain, but I have found Comet gets it off the counters and bath tub easily. And for the first few nights when I would go to bed and my hair was wet-ish, I would layer up a towel or two on top on my pillow so I wouldn&#x27;t stain my pillow case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plum is my favorite out of the purple colors they have. I&#x27;ve missed this wonderful color so much, that I&#x27;m actually in the process of dying it purple again! :] Jerome Russel Punky Colour is my favorite unnatural hair color product. &amp;#60;3</li>
    <li> I bought this for my sister since she likes to dye her hair funky colors, but the problem she kept having was the dye lasting longer than a couple weeks. So we decided to try this product and it was a little messy, but you are working with a dye, and her hair has never looked so good. The color was very vibrant and looked great, I was really impressed. She recommends your product to everyone who asks used about her hair. She now works at Walmart and can not dye her hair anymore, which is a bummer cause she is always saying she misses her colored hair.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! I&#x27;ve been dying my hair since the 4th grade. I always used splat. I loved the way it faded into all the different shades. And i stayed to splat. When ever people said manic panic was better i would foght them. But as money got tighter I didn&#x27;t get to dye my hair as often. I looked up the cheapest hair dye and bought it. It was punky colors, midnight blue. The color stayed so bright for so long. I think it stayed bright blue for two months, then I jumped in a chlorinated pool and it was fated. But it lasted for soooo long.</li>
    <li> FIrst off, it smelled somewhat like grape, which was a nice surprise. It didn&#x27;t cause any noticeable damage to my hair, which was nice as well. The color lasts for a few months before getting down to a duller color. This particular color faded to a lighter purple, which is a pretty decent fadeout. I would certainly use this on my hair again.</li>
    <li> This is one of the best bright colored dyes I&#x27;ve ever used, right behind Special Effects. It has a great smell and doesn&#x27;t bleed as much as special effects, but the color isn&#x27;t quite as amazing.</li>
    <li> his stuff is wonderful. The only thing I don&#x27;t like about it is the smell. It smells like grape soda, which a lot of people really like. It&#x27;s just not my thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still, this stuff is thick and highly pigmented. I slather my bleached hair with this color, throw on a shower cap, and let it sit overnight. Bam! Fantastic, super long-lasting color. I can usually go a month or more before needing to re-dye.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I prefer this stuff over Manic Panic and Beyond the Zone Color Jamz. I&#x27;ve had good experiences with all the Jerome Russell dye I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> Great product and great color.  Easy to use and wears well in my hair once I have put color in.</li>
    <li> (This is for Plum and Poppy Red). I&#x27;ve used Manic Panic over the last year. Punky Colours was cheaper, and I had heard good things about it, so I decided to try it out.&lt;br /&gt;Plum: I had light, light pink left over from when I had Hot Hot Pink (Manic Panic). I decided to put the Plum over my hair, and it covered evenly and beautifully. Plum is a rich and vibrant color that I fell in love with, plus it stayed in my hair for the two weeks I had it without hardly fading! It also bleached very easily out of my hair. My only problem was bleeding, although it was okay most of the time. Watch out when using shampoo- my shower curtains are now purple. In a comparison to Manic Panic, it does not condition your hair (I&#x27;ve found this to be true with all Punky Colours I&#x27;ve tried).&lt;br /&gt;Poppy red: Unsatisfied with the color choices Manic Panic had for red, I decided to purchase Poppy Red. I love it. It&#x27;s a cherry red that fades (slowly) to pink. The coverage was even, and went over my blotchy hair really well. I&#x27;ve had it for two weeks, and it looks only a tad more pink then it was when I first dyed it. However, the bleeding on this dye was the worst I&#x27;ve ever had with any dye. Tip: use black towels. I also have two tone hair (red and white), and it bled into the white badly (I never had this issue with Manic Panic, even when having blue to white ombres). I can&#x27;t say anything about the bleach because I still have it in, but I would suggest it if you want long lasting color and you have single-toned hair.&lt;br /&gt;Good luck!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been wanting to try the PLUM punky color because lately I&#x27;ve been wanting a purple tint in my hair. Not bright purple, but just a subtle dark purple to blend in with my (dyed) dark brown hair. I&#x27;ve used Dark Tulip before on medium brown hair and it made my hair dark red and every time I washed it it would get more intense. Well when I used the plum on my dark hair, the purple did NOT come out. Instead it made my dark brown hair darker brown and really shiny. After three washes (on three separate days) the purple is starting to show. I didn&#x27;t think it would but with every wash the color is showing more. My hair is turning the exact color I wanted it; dark with a purple tint. It shows more in the sun. So I would recommend it to brunettes who want that purple color blended in. Also the plum is less messy than the dark tulip. The dark tulip was an intense red for about two weeks and the other two it washed out and turned more subtle shades of red. I&#x27;m guessing the purple will probably have the same result.&lt;br /&gt; As for the staining, it doesn&#x27;t permanently stain anything.(maybe some light colored fabrics with direct contact) Some Comet or Ajax will take it off porcelain or it will gradually fade away. Scrubbing with soap gets it off skin and it wears off brush and comb bristles eventually. I also got some on a wash towel and a bath towel but it came out completely after a couple of washes. It does leave a colored residue on pillow cases and shirts (if you have longer hair) but it washes off.</li>
    <li> I love this dye. I wanted my hair purple for awhile, so I decided to give this dye a try &amp; experimented with my own ideas. I wanted my hair to be like a barney color, &amp; I ended up creating it myself. If you&#x27;re going to dye your hair blue or purple with these dyes, I reccomend getting the darkest dye possible, &amp; mixing a ton of WHITE conditioner with a little bit of the color, till it gets to the color you desire. It saves you SOOO much dye. I bought 3 jars, the first time I dyed my hair &amp; extensions with this dye I only used a half of one jar. When you have the mixture in your hair, leave it anywhere from 3 or more hours &amp; rinse. When you do shower, never use shampoo. I use garnier frutics color sheild  conditioner &amp; nothing else on my hair. Also make sure you use cold water. I haven&#x27;t had to redye &amp; my hair has been purple for about 4 months.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been buying this brand for years. I found this years ago when I was attempting to dye my hair purple and nothing else was working. This one works GREAT!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, it does wash out a little with every wash, that&#x27;s why it&#x27;s call SEMI-permanent. And it will stain your tub, sink, etc because it is dye. If it didn&#x27;t stain anything, your hair wouldn&#x27;t be colored. Wear a shirt you won&#x27;t miss to dye your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, I do have streaks in my hair so some of the purple is brighter. The darker hair has a wonderful purple hint that pops in the sunlight. I slather it through my hair and leave it on for hours until it&#x27;s dry! Then rinse it out really well and let my hair dry. When my hair is wet, you can&#x27;t really see the color. But when it dries... WOW! That is PURPLE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t wash my hair daily or with shampoo so my lasts longer than my friends hair. I wash my hair with 1 TBSP  baking soda in a cup or two of water. Wet my hair, run the water through and rinse. That&#x27;s it. No my hair doesn&#x27;t stink and it&#x27;s super soft! It takes about 4-6 weeks of doing this to get your hair to calm down, so if you are trying that to make the color last longer, you might want to start that BEFORE you add color. It will get weird and greasy and crazy during that 4-6 weeks. Once I got past that point, my hair is awesome. I wash it once or twice a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have dark hair, you may want to lighten it or streak it before you dye your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To get the stains out of your sink, bathtub: Take 3/4 cup baking soda and 1/4 cup castile soap, like Dr Bonner&#x27;s soap, and mix it together to make a paste. Add a little bit of water at a time until it is smooth, like softscrub. Rub it over your tub or sink and then gently scrub in small circles. It will slowly get the dye out. Make sure you rinse your tub well though! You don&#x27;t want to go soap skiing the next time you take a bath!</li>
    <li> I love the color its so pretty and bright! It came faster than I expected! It tends to fade after a couple of washes but its perfect! And it smells great, it has a grape smell which smells pretty, I recommend this product!</li>
    <li> doesnt bring enough dye for medium length hair&lt;br /&gt;so it left my hair very streaky&lt;br /&gt;maybe three more jars would do it justice</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using these colors for a while now and they seem to last great - on everyone but me.  It faded out in literally the first cool water rinse to a berry red.  I liked the outcome but it was supposed to be a cool plum so I was not happy with the staying power.  My hair doesn&#x27;t hold permanent color well so I shouldn&#x27;t be surprised but I&#x27;ve since tried Joico&#x27;s Color Intensives and am VERY pleased with the holding power - even in warm water washing.</li>
    <li> LOVE the color! people weren&#x27;t kidding when they said you stain everything you set your head on for the next week though! buy dark towel and pillow case</li>
    <li> I normally use Special Effects in Deep Purple, but they have been sold out for a while so I decided to try this in Plum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smells great&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t stain my shower, myself, my pillow&lt;br /&gt;Great color - pretty much the same as the SE I was using&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t cover gray hair at all&lt;br /&gt;Fades a lot with every wash&lt;br /&gt;Is mostly gone after just one week - just a light pink after that and then stays light pink</li>
    <li> I find this color to work best after a bleach or lightening kit. It provides a pretty, dark purple color that lasts longer than I anticipated for a semi-permanent dye. This was easy to apply with a color brush, and blended into the roots for an all over even shade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This plum shine survived normal washing for several weeks before it needed updating. I was able to add more dye and extend the length of the color bye 3 weeks or so. I was out of dye at that point and went to a new color, but for someone with shorter hair, you might get more applications out of this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all this was a nice experience. I liked the shine and the shade, especially in the sun. It was worth the time and effort to do and I received many compliments on my hair while using this.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this product! I&#x27;ve used Midnight Blue, Flamingo Pink and Poppy Red. I bought Poison Plum and it&#x27;s gorgeous :) it will start out super dark then lightens into a pinky-purple (Like Sugar Pill&#x27;s Poison Plum), if you are looking for more of a blue-purple then try Violet. It lasted a month before I had to slightly touch up the color. I absolutely recommend this.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Punky for about five years, I believe, and it&#x27;s the only brand of dye I trust to last without serious short-term fading. While I do buy and use Splatt for accents and the bleach, Punky lasts for months and works as a leave-in conditioner(at least for my hair), and smells more like candy than the harsh chemical smell most dyes have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It WILL stain and even after the first wash, white sheets/pillowcases/shirts are not safe. By the second or third wash, though, they should be fine. Bleach spray removes the stain from counters, cabinets, and doors very easily, while I find that face wash pads are an easy way to get it off my face. I recommend rinsing your face after dyeing but wait till after washing to use the pads, because a surprising amount of dye comes out of your skin in the shower too.</li>
    <li> The most perfect purple hair color ever. Way better than Manic Panic, and cheaper too. And it is so pigmented it will last me at least 3 colorings. I mix a little bit with conditioner and it works really well! Lasted me about 2 1/2 weeks before I needed to re-do it. But I only did that because the color was faded, it wasn&#x27;t gone by any means. I did bleach my hair first, not sure how it would show up on virgin brown hair. Will definitely be buying more punky color for all my crazy hair coloring needs!</li>
    <li> All this did was dye my scalp. Beyond a waste of money! Not only did it not color my hair, it&#x27;s only one use,despite being a large container!</li>
    <li> such vibrant color! love Jerome Russell. customer for life!</li>
    <li> This product is awesome. I first highlighted my hair and then applied the plum over the highlights. The first application for shoulder length hair takes almost the full bottle, so I bought a few extra for root touch up and monthly coloring. The plum color is a rich purple, but a little lighter than the dye in the bottle picture. I get compliments from all types of people who you wouldn&#x27;t typically expect to like funky colored hair :)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used almost every brand of alternative hair dye. This one really let me down. I only wash my hair in cold water, always using color &amp;#34;safe&amp;#34; shampoo and conditioner. I was really disappointed when this color began washing out after only 2 washes. It became muddy over my completely bleached out hair. I&#x27;ll stick to Special Effects from now on.</li>
    <li> I wanted to dye my hair, but I didn&#x27;t want to do it with permanent dye, because it&#x27;s really bad for your hair, and if I don&#x27;t like it or something like that then there&#x27;s nothing I can do about it. So this was the perfect solution. It doesn&#x27;t ruin the hair, it lasts about three weeks depending how often you wash your hair. I did NOT bleach my hair first, I have medium-lightish brown hair, and I did it twice to get it the bright colour I wanted but then it was just PERFECT I love it, it&#x27;s really bright, and all my friends are now buying Punky hair dye, and I&#x27;m buying a second tub. Highly recommended. I left the dye in my hair overnight. The only thing was I accidentely got a bit of dye on my shirt, and it was one of my favourite shirts, and it doesn&#x27;t come off. So when you&#x27;re dying your hair, wear something you don&#x27;t care will be permanently ruined. But it comes off skin after a few time of washing it with soap and water. Altogether, awesome product, I love it, highly recommended.</li>
    <li> My girlfriend loves this as it&#x27;s easy to use and she gets a lot of compliments on the color.</li>
    <li> Was just the right shade a deep plum I was looking for.  It actually stayed longer in my hair w/o bleaching than the second time when I did bleach first....  I have light brown hair.</li>
    <li> My daughter was Leela for Halloween and this made her light brown hair the perfect shade of purple for her costume. It stuck around a long time.</li>
    <li> For background: I&#x27;ve been dying my hair for close to 8 years now, and I&#x27;ve used many different brands before, including Punky Color in the past. The color I purchased this time was Plum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I&#x27;ve been looking for a dark purple dye for a while now. I&#x27;ve had hair in just about every color, including mid to lighter purple, but really wanted something dark. My hair was previously silver (faded down from blue on bleached hair) with some light brown roots. The color actually turned out great, a solid eggplant purple with neither too much blue nor too much red. I might have liked it a little darker, but that&#x27;s entirely my doing for putting this on previously bleached hair. If you have platinum blonde or white hair, expect this color to be pretty bright. If you&#x27;re using it on non-bleached or darker hair, don&#x27;t expect a bright color: you&#x27;ll probably end up with more of a tint than anything. Overall, the color was great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My complaints lie in the actual coloring process. Like I&#x27;ve said, I&#x27;ve been dying my hair for years, and I&#x27;ve used many brands to dye my hair dozens of times. When compared to common store-bought brands or higher end brands, regardless of the actual color, Punky is a bit of a pain. I&#x27;d be extra cautious about using it if you&#x27;ve never dyed your hair or if you&#x27;ve only used store brands before. Put simply: It&#x27;s REALLY messy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course you can do the standard things to be careful: wear gloves, coat your hairline and ears with petroleum jelly, put down plastic wrap/towels on your work space, etc. Still, the color is going to be a pain, and will stain any surface. For example, be EXTRA careful with your bathtub for the initial wash and subsequent few washes. It will stain!! Really, this is the only brand I&#x27;ve ever seen do this much damage to a bathroom. I suspect the over-concetration of pigment is to blame, even if it makes a good color on your hair. It will also stain every part of your skin. For example, as of my writing, the color is still very apparent on my hands, under my nails, and on my scalp. Plan ahead to be able to wash your hair at least twice before going out with this color. It will even stain your skin by just washing over it. During the initial washout, my hands and face were completely tinted purple, and I had to scrub hard with soap/cosmetic remover to get it to go away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few smaller points for the product:&lt;br /&gt;-It&#x27;s one of the only dyes I&#x27;ve encountered that&#x27;s scented. The plum color has a STRONG grape flavor scent. It&#x27;s a bit refreshing when compared to the harsh smells of some dyes, and it does leave your hair smelling nice, but I imagine this does more harm than good. Be wary if you&#x27;re sensitive to scented products, or if you have animals/children in the house as you can smell the sweet scent even before it&#x27;s opened.&lt;br /&gt;-The packaging is kind of disappointing when compared to other dyes or store-bought dyes. It came to me in a padded mailer and just a jar. It has a clear plastic shrink wrap on it (like you might find on a bottle), but no seal underneath the cap, meaning the underside of the cap is already covered in dye. The instructions are also printed on the reverse of the label (like a pill bottle) which makes it kind of difficult. I would have much preferred that the dye come packaged in a box like store-bought dyes with written instruction and a pair of gloves. I was lucky enough to already have disposable gloves. I understand they skip packaging to save money, but I would be fine paying a dollar or two more to see packaging that rivals store-bought dyes.&lt;br /&gt;-One positive note is that the dye comes premixed, meaning it can be stored safely for later use if you have extra for touch-ups and such. I didn&#x27;t up having much extra though, even though I only have chin-length hair, so take note if you have long hair that you might need more than one package.&lt;br /&gt;-As I stated above, I&#x27;ve actually used this dye before, though it was years ago. It really hasn&#x27;t changed since, which is a little disappointing. I still remember the strong sweet smell, the stained skin, and the stained bathtub. I put it down to just being inexperienced before or hoped it had improved, but the same is still true now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it&#x27;s not a terrible product. It&#x27;s definitely affordable in comparison to high-end dyes and getting it done in a shop, and the colors are strong and diverse. However, Punky dyes just have so many little problems that could easily be sorted, and the big problem of being so messy. I would stay away from this product unless you&#x27;re more experienced with dying hair and can afford to get your bathroom a little colorful.</li>
    <li> This is the best brand out there for unusual colors, as far as the hues themselves. I gave it a four out of five simply because they do not offer a line of permanent products. The semi permanent conditions your hair for sure! Leave it on until it is hard, despite what the directions say. It is a vegan product NO DAMAGE. I did not bleach before. I had dyed brown hair to begin with. Color lasts 2-3 weeks if you preserve it well. (wash every few days in cold water, avoid hot styling tools etc.)The color bleeds for first few days. Don&#x27;t put your hair on anything when it&#x27;s wet. Dry is fine, it doesn&#x27;t transfer to fabrics only to your hands omg! So don&#x27;t get a manicure or anything, or wear gloves when doing all this.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t run into an ineffective punky colour yet. As with all the others, take care not to stain your white bathroom tiles...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bleached my hair first, and colored the next week. I left the color in for 45 minutes for a very vibrant color. It fades pretty quickly, (you NEED color safe shampoo) but if you are like me and only decide to dye very short hair, this one small tub will last for multiple uses. Kept tightly sealed and in an air-tight baggie, I have successfully held this product in storage for 4 months without a decreased performance.</li>
    <li> The Plum is a great, deep royal purple color. It fades to a bit pinkish, but fades really well compared to other colors of other brands that I&#x27;ve tried. Even though it is a great rich purple, if you start with uneven color it&#x27;ll show a lot, so make sure that you start with as much of an even color as you can. That&#x27;s the only issue though, it&#x27;s great and I have no problems with the color keeping for 6 weeks, which is usually when my roots start showing so much that I redye even if the color of the rest is fine.</li>
    <li> So, I&#x27;ve only a couple colors from the line, but I&#x27;m extremely satisfied with them. Never going back to another brand, and I&#x27;m planning on trying the other colors whenI get the chance. After two months, with either plum or violet, my hair is still extremely purple. For atlantic, it&#x27;s a much lighter blue than the label shown leads you to believe, but is amazingly durable for a blue dye. It lasted for maybe a month, and never went green! Vermillion performed similarly, with no orange-ing and considerably longer lasting than any other red dye I&#x27;ve tried. Considering most dyes last -maybe- two weeks, this is pretty amazing! The dye smells great, too, so you don&#x27;t have to deal with smelling nasty chemicals while you&#x27;re putting it in. Your hair smells like soda or candy for almost a week after! I don&#x27;t really know how well it shows up on non-bleached hair, but the effect on clean, bleached hair is so vibrant. Also, this dye has a similar effect to leave-in conditioner, so your hair will feel as amazing as it looks and smells.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are some down sides, it&#x27;s REALLY hard to remove from skin, but I&#x27;ve found that [[ASIN:B000PT951G Clearasil Pore Cleansing Pads Unisex, 90 Count]] are like magic erasers for dyes. The first three or four washes, it can be prone to leaving an imprint on cloth if it&#x27;s damp at all, such as sweating a bit in your sleep and waking up with purple flecks on your neck. It also will turn your hands colors for the first three or so washes or so if you play with it a lot, but that usually washes off with just hand soap. Basically, this dye is perfect as long as you remember to use an old and/or dark pillowcase at first, or put a towel under your head when you go to sleep.</li>
    <li> At first, the color is so viibrant and amazing. Over a couple of weeks, it starts to fade to a really pretty light purple. This is my favorite dye and I can see myself using this more in the future</li>
