      <li>I bought this as a gift for a friend, and she loved it!</li>
      <li>If you want a lemon smell, it smells great.</li>
      <li>It had not leaked, thankfully, but surprising nonetheless.</li>
      <li>It was a gift - and recipient loved it</li>
      <li>Very pleased.</li>
      <li>I love it!</li>
      <li>Love it!</li>
      <li>This is a really nice fragrance for a child.</li>
      <li>I love scents and have a really good sense of smell</li>
      <li>This was given as a gift and the recipient really liked it</li>
      <li>This smells nice and refreshing, but smells citrusy, not like the lemon blossom flower.</li>
      <li>This is a pleasant perfume, it has a fresh lemony scent.  </li>
      <li>SUCH A WONDERFUL SCENT</li>
      <li>I love lemons.  </li>
      <li>I love this for the summer.  </li>
      <li>The vetiver gives it a woodsy fullness and the saltiness mixed with the lemons perfectly.    </li>
      <li>Love the fragrance...</li>
      <li>Did I say I love them both?  </li>
      <li>But it&#x27;s also because I love the scent of both the vanilla and the lemon.  </li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>I am head over heels in love with this scent.</li>
      <li>I love this scent.</li>
      <li>The scent is lovely for the warmer months and reminds me of a tropical island.</li>
      <li>I love this perfume.</li>
      <li>can&#x27;t wait to buy more scents.</li>
      <li>but it is more &amp;#34;lemon&amp;#34; than &amp;#34;lemon blossom&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s ok not quite what it was thinking.</li>
      <li>light, fresh, clean ....in a beautiful way.</li>
      <li>I love light floral.  </li>
      <li>this way.&lt;br /&gt;The scent itself smells more like a disinfecting wipe than a clean lemon.</li>
      <li>This is a great lemon fragrence..not too brisk, nice mixture of true lemon scent and light , light floral note barely noticeable under the lemon.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s sweet and fresh, love it!</li>
      <li>The smell was nice at first then got stronger</li>
      <li>Wanted a good new summer scent to wear.</li>
      <li>Smells chemically, cheap and nothing, nothing, like lemon.</li>
      <li>Lemony and clean smelling.</li>
      <li>Still, light and fresh - a &amp;#34;happy&amp;#34; scent.</li>
      <li>That said, I am on the fence as to whether I really like it or if it is okay.</li>
      <li>I do not love many perfumes - most that I&#x27;ve tried just get on my nerves after an hour or so, and I kind of want to take a shower to get rid of it.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m always looking for a fragrance that has that clean, fresh scent of lemons and not something sugary like a lemon candy.</li>
      <li>Muguet des bois is a super deal for the price (if you like lily of the valley).</li>
      <li>smells exactly like fresh, cut lemons evoking a memory of warm breezes, clear, turquoise water and clean freshness.</li>
      <li>A bit pricey, but its lemon/flower scent is very pleasant, though it doesn&#x27;t last as long as it could.</li>
      <li>Absolutely gorgeous smell though and a great alternative to artificial products.</li>
      <li>This is quite nice and the only lemon scent I&#x27;ve found that I like</li>
      <li>The blossoms have a distinct fragrance - this is not quite it.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very light and doesn&#x27;t necessarily last all day, but it is worth the money and it cheers me up!</li>
      <li>I love the citrus smell and it last a good long time.</li>
      <li>, I just don&#x27;t know if it is the right scent for me.</li>
      <li>Its crisp, fresh and refreshing especially after a shower.  </li>
      <li>I have several Pacifica perfumes, and this one is my favorite.</li>
      <li>The vanilla is exactly what I&#x27;ve always wanted a vanilla perfume to smell like, but nothing ever does.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s okay mixed with another perfume.</li>
      <li>A very fresh, young lemon scent.</li>
      <li>This is a great &amp;#34;start the day&amp;#34; fragrance year round, but I think it will really shine once it starts to warm up a little.</li>
      <li>Good for a younger female.</li>
      <li>People have told me they like the scent as it is very fresh, and it certainly does last all day</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t really have a lemon scent to it at all.</li>
      <li>So I can only say that for the price, if you think you like the sound of these, it can&#x27;t hurt to try them.</li>
      <li>Smells not exactly of the lemon blossoms of my youth, growing up surrounded by orchards, but quite a lovely scent.</li>
      <li>I love this perfume and have purchased this several times for gifts, but the problem is the scent does not last...</li>
      <li>Having never smelled this particular perfume before, I purchased it based on the reviews on it.</li>
      <li>Malibu Lemon Blossom is fresh, soft,uplifting, uncomplicated -- perfect for casual summer days or for the dark of winter to remind you of warmer times.</li>
      <li>This has a nice, bright, only very slightly fake sweet lemon fragrance with a little woodiness underneath.</li>
      <li>They aren&#x27;t very expensive, but they certainly don&#x27;t smell very good even for the inexpensive price.</li>
      <li>The perfume offers a blossom smell which in my experience seems to fade fast as the lemon smell takes over.</li>
      <li>I bought this to take with me on a caribbean cruise last year, Now, every time I smell it  reminds me of what fun I had in the islands.&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
      <li>I was very surprised that my perfume came lidless in an unwrapped box.  </li>
      <li>Pretty tiny for the amount of money I paid for it, and came with no lid...</li>
      <li>For instance, Muguet des bois by Coty is about half the price of these Pacificas, and it smells ten times better.</li>
      <li>Very wearable during the hot days of summer, this perfume is like the smell of sugared lemons - fresh and gentle, making it simultaneously creamy and floral (not sour or acidy in the least!).  </li>
      <li>Hubby: &amp;#34;Ew, smells like old lady.&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>Not the case with the Pacifica perfume, which I guess could be because it doesn&#x27;t last very long, or at least, it isn&#x27;t overwhelming for very long.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> This smells nice and refreshing, but smells citrusy, not like the lemon blossom flower.</li>
    <li> Like the fragrance but it is more &amp;#34;lemon&amp;#34; than &amp;#34;lemon blossom&amp;#34; which is what I was looking for. The blossoms have a distinct fragrance - this is not quite it. Still, light and fresh - a &amp;#34;happy&amp;#34; scent.</li>
    <li> Very wearable during the hot days of summer, this perfume is like the smell of sugared lemons - fresh and gentle, making it simultaneously creamy and floral (not sour or acidy in the least!).  The vetiver gives it a woodsy fullness and the saltiness mixed with the lemons perfectly.    This fragrance reminds me of the soapy floral notes in Vera Wang&#x27;s scents.  Malibu Lemon Blossom is fresh, soft,uplifting, uncomplicated -- perfect for casual summer days or for the dark of winter to remind you of warmer times.</li>
    <li> can&#x27;t wait to buy more scents. This is quite nice and the only lemon scent I&#x27;ve found that I like</li>
    <li> This is a great lemon fragrence..not too brisk, nice mixture of true lemon scent and light , light floral note barely noticeable under the lemon. I wish it lasted longer . I spray it on every morning and it immediatley raises my spirits.</li>
    <li> This was given as a gift and the recipient really liked it</li>
    <li> Love the fragrance...light, fresh, clean ....in a beautiful way. I plan to try other fragrances by the brand. Very pleased.</li>
    <li> It does lack lasting power and I think the lotions last longer. Absolutely gorgeous smell though and a great alternative to artificial products.</li>
    <li> Nasty scent, would not recommend this perfume.</li>
    <li> I bought this to take with me on a caribbean cruise last year, Now, every time I smell it  reminds me of what fun I had in the islands.&lt;br /&gt;It smells exactly like fresh, cut lemons evoking a memory of warm breezes, clear, turquoise water and clean freshness.</li>
    <li> If you buy this as a gift, be warned, it does not come with a cover and thus looks like it was previously used, eww. Maybe it was the manufacturer&#x27;s attempt to minimize packaging but it looks shoddy this way.&lt;br /&gt;The scent itself smells more like a disinfecting wipe than a clean lemon. To give a context, Jean Nate After Bath splash has a clearer scent to it than this.</li>
    <li> It definitely is NOT lemon smelling.  I love scents and have a really good sense of smell but this is a complex smell that has nothing to do with citrus.  I&#x27;m disappointed in it.</li>
    <li> This is a really nice fragrance for a child. Let&#x27;s face it: children&#x27;s perfumes are generally pretty awful. This has a nice, bright, only very slightly fake sweet lemon fragrance with a little woodiness underneath. This is a great &amp;#34;start the day&amp;#34; fragrance year round, but I think it will really shine once it starts to warm up a little.</li>
    <li> I am head over heels in love with this scent. I have several Pacifica perfumes, and this one is my favorite.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t really have a lemon scent to it at all.</li>
    <li> and a little too fruity. I do like the scent but it doesn&#x27;t last. I feel as if it dissipates within an hour after putting it on. Good for a younger female.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok not quite what it was thinking. Very small bottle not long lasting.</li>
    <li> I love lemons.  I love light floral.  This is the perfume I&#x27;ve worn for 2 years and will wear for a long time to come.  It&#x27;s very light and doesn&#x27;t necessarily last all day, but it is worth the money and it cheers me up!</li>
    <li> A bit pricey, but its lemon/flower scent is very pleasant, though it doesn&#x27;t last as long as it could. This is the second bottle I&#x27;ve bought.</li>
    <li> Smells not exactly of the lemon blossoms of my youth, growing up surrounded by orchards, but quite a lovely scent. The lemon is a bit fainter than I would prefer, but has a gentle floral and green bottom note that carries on.  It doesn&#x27;t smell like a cleaning product.</li>
    <li> The scent is lovely for the warmer months and reminds me of a tropical island. It&#x27;s sweet and fresh, love it!</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift for a friend, and she loved it!</li>
    <li> Smells chemically, cheap and nothing, nothing, like lemon. Hubby: &amp;#34;Ew, smells like old lady.&amp;#34; . . . . . .</li>
    <li> I love this perfume. I wear the Malibu Lemon Blossom in spring and summer and the Spanish Amber in fall and winter. You do have to reapply throughout the day, as there are no preservatives. I can&#x27;t use commercial perfumes anymore because they smell strong and fake. (Hint: if you spray it on your clothing and/or hair, the fragrance lasts longer)</li>
    <li> I love this perfume and have purchased this several times for gifts, but the problem is the scent does not last...maybe 30/45 minutes.  The other problem is the perfume bottle does not come with a cover over the spray nozzle.  I would think there would be a protective cap, so you don&#x27;t accidentally spray it.  Still like the perfume, though.  A very fresh, young lemon scent.</li>
    <li> The smell of lemon blossoms is truly one that should be captured and bottled. Having never smelled this particular perfume before, I purchased it based on the reviews on it. That said, I am on the fence as to whether I really like it or if it is okay. The perfume offers a blossom smell which in my experience seems to fade fast as the lemon smell takes over. People have told me they like the scent as it is very fresh, and it certainly does last all day, I just don&#x27;t know if it is the right scent for me.</li>
    <li> Wanted a good new summer scent to wear. I love the citrus smell and it last a good long time.</li>
    <li> SUCH A WONDERFUL SCENT</li>
    <li> Arrived on time.  It was a gift - and recipient loved it</li>
    <li> Love it. Lemony and clean smelling.</li>
    <li> It smells like lemons, not really smelling the blossom part. I regret buying this because now I feel like I just smell like household cleaning products. It&#x27;s okay mixed with another perfume.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know what these Pacifica perfumes have in them, but they smell tinny to me. I have the lilac and the lemon, and they both have an after-smell that I don&#x27;t care for. They aren&#x27;t very expensive, but they certainly don&#x27;t smell very good even for the inexpensive price. For instance, Muguet des bois by Coty is about half the price of these Pacificas, and it smells ten times better. Muguet des bois is a super deal for the price (if you like lily of the valley).</li>
    <li> I do not love many perfumes - most that I&#x27;ve tried just get on my nerves after an hour or so, and I kind of want to take a shower to get rid of it.  Not the case with the Pacifica perfume, which I guess could be because it doesn&#x27;t last very long, or at least, it isn&#x27;t overwhelming for very long.  But it&#x27;s also because I love the scent of both the vanilla and the lemon.  The vanilla is exactly what I&#x27;ve always wanted a vanilla perfume to smell like, but nothing ever does.  The lemon is like a lemon cake, instead of like furniture polish, or the actual citrus fruit.  Did I say I love them both?  I do.  That being said, however, every scent smells different on everyone, and everyone&#x27;s taste is different.  So I can only say that for the price, if you think you like the sound of these, it can&#x27;t hurt to try them.</li>
    <li> This is a pleasant perfume, it has a fresh lemony scent.  Hard to buy perfume on the internet without trying it first.</li>
    <li> I was very surprised that my perfume came lidless in an unwrapped box.  It had not leaked, thankfully, but surprising nonetheless.</li>
    <li> I love this for the summer.  Its not flowery. Its crisp, fresh and refreshing especially after a shower.  I start with scented lotion and finish with the spray cologne.  Love it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m always looking for a fragrance that has that clean, fresh scent of lemons and not something sugary like a lemon candy. Pacifica has found that scent in the Malibu Lemon Blossom Perfume. I love it!</li>
    <li> Disappointed in the scent. Label says lemon blossom but it smelled like a lemon. If you have ever smelled a lemon blossom, you know it doesn&#x27;t smell like a lemon. If you want a lemon smell, it smells great. Nothing wrong with the product except for the name.</li>
    <li> I love this scent. I also have the body wipes in this scent.</li>
    <li> Pretty tiny for the amount of money I paid for it, and came with no lid...so I don&#x27;t know what that&#x27;s about? The smell was nice at first then got stronger the longer it was on and I was coughing at times with only two squirts on my wrists.</li>
