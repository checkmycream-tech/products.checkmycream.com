      <li>We were very pleased with our purchase.</li>
      <li>it was not disclosed on advertisment and now i own this stuff</li>

      <li>They&#x27;ve added a nice fragrance to the product that makes it better than before.</li>
      <li>It is good to clean the shaver.</li>

      <li>Product seems to be okay</li>
      <li>It goes with my husband&#x27;s razor and I was glad to find it on line.</li>
      <li>Well it works well with the shaver&#x27;s cleaner so how could it possibly be better than that.</li>
      <li>One would think that department stores which sell the shaver would sell the acessories, but many don&#x27;t.  </li>
      <li>The razor came out very clean.  </li>
      <li>it elaborates from the machine very quickly.</li>
      <li>It was easy to insert in the cleaner and easy to discard as well.  </li>
      <li>i had just bought the razor and it works fine.  </li>
      <li>Cleans my husband&#x27;s Norelco just fine.</li>
      <li>just fine though.</li>
      <li>I refill my charger&#x27;s reservoir at the beginning of every month with it, and doing so does seem to make the shaving experience much more pleasant than the last time I used an electric over 20 years ago.</li>
      <li>Oh, and the price on Amazon is cheap too.</li>
      <li>suppose this liquid is a scam and there is some cheaper solution available somewhere.</li>
      <li>I find that I have to rinse the shaver out after every cleaning in order to enable the shaver to glide smoothly over my face.</li>
      <li>I will add that i filled and emtyed it to send and i don&#x60;t like the opening of it or the filling hole of the cleaning system;too</li>
      <li>It also cleans the whiskers out better than hot water alone.</li>
      <li>I buy the HQ200 Jet Clean Solution for my Norelco Electric Razor because of the warning against using anything else, found in the owner&#x27;s guide.</li>
      <li>Whenever I use it to clean the shaver reduces irritation of my skin</li>
      <li>I purchased Norelco Clean Jet Solution to clean and maintain my Norelco Razor.</li>
      <li>B0009MFUPY Norelco HQ200 Jet Clean Solution]].</li>
      <li>The shaver comes out factory clean, and the batteries are fully charged.</li>
      <li>You clean the 9161 by just popping the heads up and rinsing it under running water.</li>
      <li>You need this to clean and lubricate your razor when using Norelco&#x27;s Jet Cleaning system.</li>
      <li>This solution goes in the special cleaner charger unit that is sold with the model 9171 razor.</li>
      <li>but they don&#x27;t let you know you should have a special cleaning appliance to use this product correctly.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t clean mine near as often as suggested, I honestly probably use this once every couple of weeks, sometimes once a month.  </li>
      <li>This solution is a whole lot better than using water or alcohol to clean my razor.</li>
      <li>Product is packaged different than item description, however, the new formula is great.  </li>
      <li>Great product but not cheap considering</li>
      <li>right</li>
      <li>There&#x27;s pretty much no reason to just toss the liquid out unless you really enjoy buying this stuff.  </li>
      <li>While this product does clean the shaver very well, the shaver system requires you to change the solution every two weeks even if you haven&#x27;t run the cleaning system very much.  </li>
      <li>Though this product does clean and lubricate the blades, it&#x27;s best to manually clean the separate heads and blades by taking the shaver apart once in a while, as the solution can not break down or remove every bit of \\&quot;gunk\\&quot; in the head, which is common sense.    </li>
      <li>make sure you have the proper razor for this product     </li>
      <li>First of all, I received a Norelco shaver with a cleaning unit and a bottle of this solution, so I was not afflicted, but</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t send it back because it would have cost me more than just throwing it away.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Regarding on-line purchases of this solution - strange, but it has always been my experience that it is cheaper to buy it ala carte, rather than as a pre-priced 6-pack, whose per unit price worked out to be a dollar MORE per bottle.</li>
      <li>I got some of this stuff with my new Norelco system, and I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s probably worth using it --</li>
      <li>Why am I required to have a certain number of words in my revied?</li>
      <li>It takes a long time to clean the razor, but the razor does come out feeling clean and new. &lt;</li>
      <li>I found the price here to be competative, and delivery was fast.</li>
      <li>Thanks Norelco for the improvements you have made   for us</li>
      <li>This cleaning solution for my Philips Norelco razor works very well.</li>
      <li>it isn&#x27;t really compared to nothin</li>
      <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
      <li>Cleans my 3D Norelco better than any other cleaning solution.</li>
      <li>B0009MFUN6 Norelco 9170XLCC SmartTouch-XL Jet Clean Men&#x27;s Shaving System]] is the only combination that doesn&#x27;t leave me with in-grown hairs, rashes, and the likes.</li>
      <li>Keeps Norelco razors like new!</li>
      <li>it cleans and leaves the razor in like new condition.  </li>
      <li>I hope it cleans!My new sytem</li>
      <li>At first I thought that this was just Barbicide (that blue stuff your barber keeps the combs in)</li>
      <li>I use RC 1776 with my old Norelco (about 15 years old that is).  </li>
      <li>cause it is the only one for this particular thing</li>
      <li>i.e. I often run out half way filled and have to open another to get another cleaning toward the end of a bottle.</li>
      <li>At some point I&#x27;ll probably need more of it, but a little bit of solution could last very long.</li>
      <li>yes, this is a useless product if you don&#x27;t own the unit, unless you feel like dipping your shaver in the fluid and turning it on repeatedly (if it even is made fro that).    </li>

<li> Not sure rating this high or low matters.</li>
<li> I just put the heads in a plastic bowl added the cleaning solution, swished it around for awhile then just set it aside to dry.  </li>
<li> Swirl for about 30 seconds, rinse, pat the heads dry and reassemble the cutters.  </li>
<li> If you have sensitive skin, especially if it is caused by an abnormally thick beard, and you are looking for a product to solve your problems, then your search has come to an end.</li>
<li> &lt;br /&gt;Around where I live, it can be hard to find the solution.  </li>
<li> When I bought it there was nothing about having a system ( which costs well over $100)before it could be used, or at least it wasn&#x27;t obvious enough to stop me from buying it.</li>
<li> My only complaint is that even though I fill it to the minimum fill line, there doesn&#x27;t seem to be an even amount of fluid to do even fills.</li>
<li> Expensive but worth the cost.</li>
<li> Having to replace the Jet Clean  solution every two weeks makes the shaver very expensive over time.  </li>
<li> /&gt;Sometimes I use it with the actually cleaning base that my razor game with, other times I just rinse the razor with this straight from the bottle, but either way I can definitely tell a major improvement with my razor when using this!</li>
<li> So, I recommend always having a few extras on hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> Since this charger is not sold separately, I wasted my money buying it to accompany my model 9161 razor.</li>
<li> Of course, Norelco is going to warn against using any other type of solution for my model, and of course I&#x27;m going to be a sucker and continue to use just the HQ200 solution, like a lamb to a slaughter.</li>
<li> This is the cleaning and lubricating solution that goes with Norelco shavers that are sold with the jet clean base.  </li>
<li> Not sure what the diff is between the solution in a square bottle that was shipped and the solution in the round bottle I had.</li>
<li> Now if I could just find a generic version of this stuff, but then again it&#x27;s not that expensive.</li>
<li> I usually buy the 2 pack and it lasts almost 2 years.</li>
<li> small</li>
<li> I&#x27;m just putting my dirty fluid through a coffee filter for re-use.  </li>
<li> but im also not thrilled, its just a cleaning solution.</li>
<li> so i mean i can&#x27;t gauge it it cleanse the rasor</li>
<li> You just pop the heads out put them in a shallow dish and cover with the solution.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Cleans my 3D Norelco better than any other cleaning solution.</li>
    <li> It is good to clean the shaver. Whenever I use it to clean the shaver reduces irritation of my skin</li>
    <li> Great product but not cheap considering it elaborates from the machine very quickly.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t say anything against this product, by any means. I refill my charger&#x27;s reservoir at the beginning of every month with it, and doing so does seem to make the shaving experience much more pleasant than the last time I used an electric over 20 years ago. However, I have no basis of comparison. I buy the HQ200 Jet Clean Solution for my Norelco Electric Razor because of the warning against using anything else, found in the owner&#x27;s guide. Of course, Norelco is going to warn against using any other type of solution for my model, and of course I&#x27;m going to be a sucker and continue to use just the HQ200 solution, like a lamb to a slaughter. But for this, I don&#x27;t consider this as a bad thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regarding on-line purchases of this solution - strange, but it has always been my experience that it is cheaper to buy it ala carte, rather than as a pre-priced 6-pack, whose per unit price worked out to be a dollar MORE per bottle. So I just order a quantity of six.</li>
    <li> Great item, very happy</li>
    <li> This is the cleaning and lubricating solution that goes with Norelco shavers that are sold with the jet clean base.  Between the base and the solution, the system works great.  The shaver comes out factory clean, and the batteries are fully charged. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Around where I live, it can be hard to find the solution.  One would think that department stores which sell the shaver would sell the acessories, but many don&#x27;t.  I found the price here to be competative, and delivery was fast.</li>
    <li> This is a good product that does the job it is supposed to do</li>
    <li> Great product.  Brand name at great price.  Easier to shop internet than to seek locally.</li>
    <li> This solution goes in the special cleaner charger unit that is sold with the model 9171 razor. Since this charger is not sold separately, I wasted my money buying it to accompany my model 9161 razor. It is not supposed to be used as a stand alone cleaning solution. You clean the 9161 by just popping the heads up and rinsing it under running water.</li>
    <li> This product, in combination with the [[ASIN:B0009MFUN6 Norelco 9170XLCC SmartTouch-XL Jet Clean Men&#x27;s Shaving System]] is the only combination that doesn&#x27;t leave me with in-grown hairs, rashes, and the likes. I have tried everything, from cheaper electric razors, to the [[ASIN:B000BUW8WM Gillette Fusion Power Battery Powered Shaving System, 1system]]... While the Gillete Fusion works well, it still leaves me with irritated skin... If you have sensitive skin, especially if it is caused by an abnormally thick beard, and you are looking for a product to solve your problems, then your search has come to an end.</li>
    <li> This cleaning solution for my Philips Norelco razor works very well. My only complaint is that even though I fill it to the minimum fill line, there doesn&#x27;t seem to be an even amount of fluid to do even fills. i.e. I often run out half way filled and have to open another to get another cleaning toward the end of a bottle. So, I recommend always having a few extras on hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Afterward, the shaves are noticeably smoother for a while. It also cleans the whiskers out better than hot water alone.</li>
    <li> The Philips Norelco HQ200 Jet Cleaning solution did the trick.  It was easy to insert in the cleaner and easy to discard as well.  The razor came out very clean.  A very good price as well.  I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t use the solution because I didn&#x27;t have the SYSTEM to use it with. When I bought it there was nothing about having a system ( which costs well over $100)before it could be used, or at least it wasn&#x27;t obvious enough to stop me from buying it. So, I think you got me on this one. I didn&#x27;t send it back because it would have cost me more than just throwing it away. Unhappy with the deal. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;John Ashley</li>
    <li> and running longer on a charge!  Thanks Norelco for the improvements you have made   for us your customers  George</li>
    <li> I did a bit of research after I ran out of Norelco RC 1776 Razor Cleaner.  Norelco&#x27;s own site says that HQ200 is the replacement.  I use RC 1776 with my old Norelco (about 15 years old that is).  You just pop the heads out put them in a shallow dish and cover with the solution.  Swirl for about 30 seconds, rinse, pat the heads dry and reassemble the cutters.  Works great.  At first I thought that this was just Barbicide (that blue stuff your barber keeps the combs in) but I looked up the MSDS (Material Data Safety Sheet) of both and they are not the same.  Now if I could just find a generic version of this stuff, but then again it&#x27;s not that expensive.</li>
    <li> Product seems to be okay but they don&#x27;t let you know you should have a special cleaning appliance to use this product correctly.  I just put the heads in a plastic bowl added the cleaning solution, swished it around for awhile then just set it aside to dry.  It cleaned the heads quite well.</li>
    <li> Well it works well with the shaver&#x27;s cleaner so how could it possibly be better than that.</li>
    <li> I hope it cleans!My new sytem didn&#x60;t work so i had to send back everything.I will add that i filled and emtyed it to send and i don&#x60;t like the opening of it or the filling hole of the cleaning system;too small and i spilled sole of it.Needless to say i spilled more trying to put it back to ship with the comeplete system.</li>
    <li> Came on time and does a great job cleaning the electric razor blades.</li>
    <li> the solution is very cheap and after you wash your shaver in it and shave, your face feels like a baby&#x27;s face</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t used it yet.  I ordered for my husband, but didn&#x27;t realize you have to purchase something to use this in.  Will have to buy that.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t know where the \\&quot;Jet\\&quot; comes in!  It takes a long time to clean the razor, but the razor does come out feeling clean and new. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I suppose this liquid is a scam and there is some cheaper solution available somewhere.</li>
    <li> i had just bought the razor and it works fine.  this is the icing on the cake.  it cleans and leaves the razor in like new condition.  when amazon offered me a discount on the cleaner i&#x27;ll always have perfect shaves</li>
    <li> First of all, I received a Norelco shaver with a cleaning unit and a bottle of this solution, so I was not afflicted, but yes, this is a useless product if you don&#x27;t own the unit, unless you feel like dipping your shaver in the fluid and turning it on repeatedly (if it even is made fro that).    Though this product does clean and lubricate the blades, it&#x27;s best to manually clean the separate heads and blades by taking the shaver apart once in a while, as the solution can not break down or remove every bit of \\&quot;gunk\\&quot; in the head, which is common sense.    Oh, and the price on Amazon is cheap too.</li>
    <li> make sure you have the proper razor for this product     you need one with a reservoir    it was not disclosed on advertisment and now i own this stuff</li>
    <li> We were very pleased with our purchase. we wanted[[ASIN:B0009MFUPY Norelco HQ200 Jet Clean Solution]]. It works great with my razor.</li>
    <li> Cleans my husband&#x27;s Norelco just fine.</li>
    <li> Not sure rating this high or low matters. 3 star because i cant hate it, but im also not thrilled, its just a cleaning solution. HAh.</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t find this in town.  It goes with my husband&#x27;s razor and I was glad to find it on line.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s cost kept me from giving a five star rating. You need this to clean and lubricate your razor when using Norelco&#x27;s Jet Cleaning system. I usually buy the 2 pack and it lasts almost 2 years. It does a great job on maintaining the razor. I&#x27;ve had the same blades for over 4 years.</li>
    <li> I got this for my uncle for his birthday.  He&#x27;s one of those practical people so he requested some of this.  He said it&#x27;s working out great!  Keeps Norelco razors like new!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried several different cleaners. This is the best cleaner. Expensive but worth the cost. Why am I required to have a certain number of words in my revied?</li>
    <li> I got some of this stuff with my new Norelco system, and I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s probably worth using it -- the shave quality feels good after a cleaning, although I wouldn&#x27;t bother with the &amp;#34;monthly&amp;#34; replacement directions.  I&#x27;m just putting my dirty fluid through a coffee filter for re-use.  There&#x27;s pretty much no reason to just toss the liquid out unless you really enjoy buying this stuff.  At some point I&#x27;ll probably need more of it, but a little bit of solution could last very long.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s a good product it isn&#x27;t really compared to nothin cause it is the only one for this particular thing right so i mean i can&#x27;t gauge it it cleanse the rasor just fine though.</li>
    <li> I can definitely say that I notice a difference when cleaning my electric razor with this stuff.  I don&#x27;t clean mine near as often as suggested, I honestly probably use this once every couple of weeks, sometimes once a month.  Even then I think it keeps my razor running smoother and therefore being smoother on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes I use it with the actually cleaning base that my razor game with, other times I just rinse the razor with this straight from the bottle, but either way I can definitely tell a major improvement with my razor when using this!</li>
    <li> This is a great product, but I do not use it as often as I should.  I had thought this would be to soak the head, but it was for a different razor.  Still a good product.</li>
    <li> While this product does clean the shaver very well, the shaver system requires you to change the solution every two weeks even if you haven&#x27;t run the cleaning system very much.  Having to replace the Jet Clean  solution every two weeks makes the shaver very expensive over time.  Also, this cleaning solution takes away any lubricating qualities of preshave liquids.  I find that I have to rinse the shaver out after every cleaning in order to enable the shaver to glide smoothly over my face.</li>
    <li> I purchased Norelco Clean Jet Solution to clean and maintain my Norelco Razor. This solution is a whole lot better than using water or alcohol to clean my razor.</li>
    <li> Not sure what the diff is between the solution in a square bottle that was shipped and the solution in the round bottle I had. Same brand.</li>
    <li> Product is packaged different than item description, however, the new formula is great.  They&#x27;ve added a nice fragrance to the product that makes it better than before.</li>
