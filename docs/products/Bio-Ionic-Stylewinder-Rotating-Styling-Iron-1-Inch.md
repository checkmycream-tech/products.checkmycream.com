      <li>I absolutely love this curling iron!</li>
      <li>and I love it!</li>
      <li>I love this curling iron!  </li>
      <li>iron heats up in seconds so it makes it easy when you are in a hurry and want a great hair style too.</li>
      <li>It is AMAZING.  </li>
      <li>temp gauge is nice to have too.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Finally received this product and it work just ok, not as good as the Target iron.</li>
      <li>It did make a nice curl.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve read about the looseness of the clamp, but if it was tighter the hair wouldn&#x27;t slide through nicely.  </li>
      <li>My daughter liked it and said the hair slides out too.</li>
      <li>I was thrilled to pieces and immediately found it on Amazon for $75.</li>
      <li>so I use a ionic blow styler and then Bio ionic Stylewinder and get&#x27;s the job done nicely.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s worth every penny and you will want to show everybody!!!</li>
      <li>This is very easy to use once you get the hang of it.  </li>
      <li>it is very easy to use.</li>
      <li>It came in a very timely fashion and it was very good condition.</li>
      <li>It takes me maybe 15 minutes to get curls like I&#x27;ve never been able to achieve on my own before (salons, yes - at home, no).</li>
      <li>Still - it&#x27;s the best if you want natural looking spirals and even curls from root to hair ends.</li>
      <li>Easy to use on clients and myself!</li>
      <li>I love love love this hair tool!</li>
      <li>and  I am very good with hair tools but the description of this tool should specify that it works best for medium to thick hair.  </li>
      <li>When I first received the appliance it worked great.</li>
      <li>Such a great curling iron and at an AMAZING price!</li>
      <li>However, this curling iron worked SO quickly and gorgeously</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s so nice and easy to use.</li>
      <li>I have fine hair, so I was looking forward to using this and putting some body and even just waves would have been nice, but there were clumps of my hair all over my bathroom counter and a lot wrapped around the bottom of the barrel.</li>
      <li>My hair is medium length and layered, so it worked for some sections better then others.  </li>
      <li>I love this product.</li>
      <li>I really love this curling iron.</li>
      <li>I have received so many compliments -</li>
      <li>Love this curling iron with the rotating arm</li>
      <li>so I&#x27;m stuck without a lovely curling iron</li>
      <li>I am a hair stylist and love this curler.</li>
      <li>I love the iron, but if you do purchase it, ask your stylist how to use it instead of watching the dvd.</li>
      <li>Also there no need to be more than 1 hour doing your hair, because of the easiness of the iron and</li>
      <li>awesome curler, wish i would have gotten the bigger one though because i have a lot of hair!</li>
      <li>LOVE this curling iron.</li>
      <li>The clip is more of a placeholder to get the curl started.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This is a great product, excellent quality and good price. I just wish I wasn&#x27;t such a spaz when it comes to hair curling. I get the bio hair straightening treatment done every year and I don&#x27;t like the way my ends just hand flat. This enables me to create a nice, soft wave.</li>
    <li> DO NOT TAKE THIS PRODUCT TO EUROPE!  It does not work with the European voltage.  It blew up in my hotel room and tripped the fuses.  Another friend had the same product and she tried it at another place and it also blew up!</li>
    <li> Easy to use and so far works well. The construction is a little shoddy for $60. Screws and parts that should be tight are loose.</li>
    <li> This is the better curling iron that i ever had. Is super easy to use, and the curls last longer compare with other irons i have tried. My hair is super fine and is not very abundant, usually my curls last less than 10 minutes. With this curling iron my curls last a lot longer. Also there no need to be more than 1 hour doing your hair, because of the easiness of the iron and the quickly it gets hot, doing your hair get less time.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this curling iron to anyone. :)</li>
    <li> Only seldom use &amp;  lasted 6 months. Will go back to drybar.</li>
    <li> Super easy to use, a nice update for an old product. The spinning head makes it really easy to use for anyone. And man does it get hot!</li>
    <li> I love the curling iron easy to use and the curls stay most of the day and I don&#x27;t use the hair spray with it ...</li>
    <li> I just tried out this curling iron it has amazed me! I love that it&#x27;s digital (you can set heat to whatever you want) and heats up crazy fast. You do use this iron a different way than your ordinary clamp curling iron so be sure you watch YouTube video or instructions. As other reviewers have mentioned, you did not really need to use hairspray and my curls are holding so well. I&#x27;m really happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> I a using my husband&#x27;s account. I bought this curling iron and I love it! I watched a youtube video on exactly how to use it and it makes curling my hair a lot quicker. My daughter used mine and now she wants one. I would recommend this to anyone who likes curling their hair. My hair is cut in a short bob and I just love it.</li>
    <li> I am not a stylist but have FINE and THICK hair that never holds a curl.  This heats up faster than any iron I&#x27;ve ever owned - including Hot Tools - and the curl stays until I wash my hair.  It is unbelievable to me that it actually works!  I paid $5 more just yesterday (it was $99) but still worth every single penny.  I am so excited.  I cannot believe how fast it heats up and how well the 1\\&quot; makes curls on my long, super straight hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought the 2\\&quot; Hot Tools tourmaline at the same time and it just doesn&#x27;t function as well though it says it heats up to the same degrees...I had to hold that in my hair while the BioIonic came out just a fraction of a second after getting the rod curled up!  It is sooooo fast.  It did take me about 30 minutes to figure out which way to spin my thumb to get the right spiral for curling but that&#x27;s because I&#x27;m inept with hair curling devices.  Once I got that down, now I know how to work it.  There is a DVD included in the pkg and I have not watched that yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope you love it as much as I do!</li>
    <li> Had to return it. Hair got stuck in wand- hard to get out so I feel like I fried my hair.. It did make a nice curl. Maybe it is user error? But even so, I&#x27;m not risking burning my hair till I get used to it.</li>
    <li> The iron is a Christmas gift for my daughter, I am sure she will enjoy it. I show this to my hair designer and she said it was a good choice. Shipping was good also, I recommend this to everyone.</li>
    <li> This is very easy to use once you get the hang of it.  The shipping was very fast and the price was great!</li>
    <li> I ordered it because my stylist uses it on my hair and the result is wonderful.  Unfortunately, I may not be as handy as she is and I got a worse result than with my classic curling iron.</li>
    <li> Got this for Christmas, not sure about it, need to put in a lot of hair or it just slips out, so I am not sure about all the rave reviews, maybe I am just doing something wrong, will keep working with it.</li>
    <li> Best iron ever!  I have layered hair; past my shoulders in the back and this does create some soft voluminous waves - not like the models on YouTube but right for my style hair.  Holds all day and I couldn&#x27;t believe it myself but like it says, it does make your hair feel softer and it is shinier!  It took time to get used to twirling and I had to watch the dvd that came with it but once I got the hang of it, I threw away my other irons.</li>
    <li> Terrible Curling Iron! I bought it in January 2015 &amp; it already does not work. It never really clamped on well either. Every time I used it to curl my hair the clamp would not hold my hair in the clamp well. I hated using it. Do not Buy this product -- it is BAD!</li>
    <li> Great product, my wife loves it, says it curls her hair in seconds instead of minutes. temp gauge is nice to have too. included dvd was very helpful to learn technique, as with the rotating barrel it works a little differently than a normal curling iron. With this and her Hana flat iron she could start her own salon, lol</li>
    <li> I love this curling iron. Is the first time my hair has ever been able to hold curl. it is very easy to use.</li>
    <li> This was my second style winder. The first one I loved but this one will not clamp down enough to hold my hair in at all  :( I would hate to buy another one because they are so expensive</li>
    <li> I was looking for the BioIonics iCurl when I came across the Style Winder.  The Style Winder didn&#x27;t take long to get used to, and it does get really hot very quickly, but I feel it&#x27;s harder to control the outcome of my hair style with this iron then with the iCurl.  If your hair tends to be long, and you want bouncy curls or waves, this may work out for you.  My hair is medium length and layered, so it worked for some sections better then others.  Because the clamp is not tight,(It appears to be designed that way.), I ended up gettng some  little wing tips on the ends of my hair as another reviewer mentioned. I think the short width of the clamp may have something to do with that.  It takes me longer to use the Style Winder then the iCurl as I have to be careful as to how much hair I put under the clamp so it will hold.  It&#x27;s all right, but I prefer the iCurl, and don&#x27;t think I would repurchase the Style Winder.  Unfortunately, it looks like BioIonics no longer manufacters the iCurl.  Note, because of the rotating barrel, the Style Winder does not come with a \\&quot;kick stand\\&quot; attached.  But the company does provide a nice heavy stand that you can rest the curling iron on.</li>
    <li> Hair can tangle and pull but gives great curls.  Definitely recommend</li>
    <li> The reviews on this page almost stopped me from ordering this curling iron but I went ahead for two reasons: first, I know this is the exact same model that the Drybar is selling via Sephora for $125 (they painted it yellow and re-branded it) and I have had this exact one used on me at Drybar before they re-branded it with their logo.  It is AMAZING.  So easy to use, you just place the iron mid-way in your hair and rotate, so simple and you end up with beautiful waves.  The curling iron heats up so fast it shocked me the first time.  I&#x27;ve purchased a Sedu and a T3 Twirl in the past and neither were as easy to use or gave me as beautiful of waves.  Definitely a good buy.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a professional hair artist and have never been more amazed and impressed with a hot tool. Before raving, I will go ahead and say that you should not doubt this curling iron!!! You will love it!!!&lt;br /&gt;The Bio Ionic Sylewinder is the easiest curling you will ever use on your hair.&lt;br /&gt;It has 3 areas of heat, for thin, normal, and thick/course hair. It heats up to over 400 degrees (this is area is for thick/course hair) in around 15 seconds. This iron has dual heaters in it&#x27;s barrel. The barrel is also mineral infused, so it doesn&#x27;t dry your hair out. It creates very shiny, long lasting curls.&lt;br /&gt;The greatest feature is the twisting clamp on the barrel. And if anybody has ever used a Marcel curling iron, you will be thankful for this iron. Because it kicks the Marcel&#x27;s butt! You aren&#x27;t killing your wrist by trying to move it in ways that it can&#x27;t. You simply wrap the hair around the barrel and twist the clamp, by only moving your fingers, the hair wraps around the barrel itself. Plus it has a cool tip at the top so you can hold the iron and not burn your fingers. It&#x27;s absolutely fantastic. And a lot faster.&lt;br /&gt;Trust me in saying, you will not regret your decision in buying this iron. It&#x27;s worth every penny and you will want to show everybody!!!</li>
    <li> I love this product. I am not good at doing my own hair much less using a curling iron but this sidewinder curling iron makes thing so easy!&lt;br /&gt;I have even used the curling wand where you wrap hair around the wand and burnt myself so many times and my hair comes out a mess. But this iron makes things so easy and the results look like i know exactly what i am doing.&lt;br /&gt;It works great for me and yes it is expensive but a great investment.&lt;br /&gt;The only thing that i wish i had was the larger barrel, the 1 inch makes my curls a little tighter than i expected. I do want to purchase the larger barrel when i can afford it.&lt;br /&gt;The iron heats up in seconds so it makes it easy when you are in a hurry and want a great hair style too.</li>
    <li> This product was unusable. The clamp doesn&#x27;t hold any amount of hair. Waited too long to try and return so its headed for the trash.</li>
    <li> If I could do MINUS STARS I would!  I bought my first style winder under an ad that stated the product was made in the United States.  Around 1 year of use the spring broke inside the button (toggle) that you press to raise the &amp;#34;clamp&amp;#34; that keeps your hair around the curling cylinder.  As a consequence the curling iron is now useless because you can&#x27;t keep your hair around the cylinder to curl it.  Since the 1 year warranty had expired/was about to expire I didn&#x27;t bother sending it back-I called &amp; got another one shipped express thinking the breakage was a fluke.  Not so.  The second one just broke again at around a year of use.  My husband took the rubber top off the button to see if he could fix it and found the small spring broken in half.  I just got off the phone with the corporate offices of Bio Ionic and was told to ship both back to them, fill in some paperwork, and give them my credit card and for $18.95 each they would replace the curling irons.  All I wanted was a few of the springs, but no-they don&#x27;t repair them-they just throw them in the trash!  I told her I was under the impression that they were made in the USA &amp; I was now finding that hard to believe.  She said &amp;#34;oh no&amp;#34; they were made in Asia.  I paid around $60 for each one plus shipping.  I&#x27;m not going to encourage such corporate behavior (obviously NO quality control) so there will be no postage wasted nor $18.95 x 2.  AND i won&#x27;t buy ANYTHING again from Bio Ionic-just a bunch of junk!</li>
    <li> I have fine, borderline limp hair and historically I would use traditional curling irons but it would return to straight waves within hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can use this style winder without any product and my curls last for two days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best beauty purchase this year!</li>
    <li> Gets very hot! Works very well. Be careful because you can burn yourself! I&#x27;ve done it several times. Maybe I&#x27;m just clumbsy!</li>
    <li> WONDERFUL! with a small caveat: don&#x27;t get it if you have long hair. Long strands won&#x27;t fit and your ends will look funky.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this curling iron! It was recommended to me by my hair stylist. It takes some practice, so don&#x27;t give up if you initially have a hard time with it. It creates a salon worthy look!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s really great it&#x27;s my second one im a editorial stylist so these really come in handy .</li>
    <li> my daughter loves it. She says she gets professional results with easy use. She could not wait to use it.</li>
    <li> Allows you to curl your hair in a lot less time than my other curling iron (drugstore brand).  It is easy to use and does not damage my hair as much because I don&#x27;t leave it in as long.</li>
    <li> As a stylist this is the best price I have ever found for this iron. I bought two. It comes with a stand to hold the iron off of any surface. The one I bought from my professional distributor did not even have that. I love this iron and only wish I could find it in 3/4in for this price.</li>
    <li> I first heard of this rotating styling wand at my hairdresser&#x27;s. Once she used it on my hair I was hooked!! I tried on several occasions to purchase one from her but she said they sold out each time a new shipment arrived and were placed on in the shelf. I decided to order one from Amazon and was not disappointed. The seller has a great product and it was shipped to me in 2 days. Wow...thank you. This is a great product. The base of the wand can be turned by your thumb so?..No gloves to wear so you won&#x27;t burn your hand when styling, it heats very fast and doesn&#x27;t take long at all to create long curls that last even through the next day. I&#x27;m already one clicking to purchase another one.</li>
    <li> This is the BEST curling iron I gave ever used!!!  It makes big curls that last forever.  They are still there the next morning.</li>
    <li> I love love love this hair tool! Totally worth the money! Takes a little bit to get used to but once u got it this is super easy to use!</li>
    <li> Easy to use: holds better than most&lt;br /&gt;curling irons and heats up immediately, which is a big time saver.&lt;br /&gt;Great for travel, though my electric rollers still do the best job.</li>
    <li> Returned it, winder was not tight enough, hair slipped out. Paid for mailing myself &amp; didn&#x27;t receive refund. Had one before &amp; loved it.</li>
    <li> I like this product but it takes some practice to use and you have to be careful that you do not touch the wrong area and get burned. I am 58 years old so someone younger and more agile can probably manage better than me!</li>
    <li> When I first received the appliance it worked great. After using only 3 times, it did not perform like it did. The hair would fall out of the wand, which I assume means the spring was disfunctional. I work in the beauty industry, and was introduced to this appliance by my stylist and loved the curls after she styled my hair with her Bio Ionic Style Winder. I assume this appliance had a problem from the beginning and took a couple of times of use before it stopped performing. It worked in the beginning so  I threw away the box etc. I won&#x27;t order from this seller again. The price was reduced, now I know why!</li>
    <li> I am in tears. Sure the barrel rotates, but it doesn&#x27;t rotate the hair with it. I&#x27;ve watched video after video but this stupid thing can&#x27;t even produce a curl. It&#x27;s obvious to me that this curler is not the Bio Ionic brand. The clip doesn&#x27;t grasp the hair tight enough to curl, no matter how much hair it&#x27;s given. I should have left this stupid thing to the hair stylist.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work for my texture or length of hair.  My hair wouldn&#x27;t stay in it long enough to curl, it kept falling out.  Not sure it&#x27;s my length or hair texture. My hair is about 4-5 inches below my shoulder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought it because a co worker uses one on her hair and it makes beautiful curls. But her hair is very fine and hangs down past the middle of her back.</li>
    <li> I love this curling iron for its ease and great results. If you want the beach look then gt this! I love how it turns by itself which makes it easier on your wrist. I suggest you watch some videos on Youtube to show you how to use this iron. I&#x27;m very pleased with my purchase.</li>
    <li> worst curling iron I have purchased</li>
    <li> When my old one of these died, I replaced it with a &#x27;regular&#x27; curling iron like I used before.  It&#x27;s already stashed in a drawer.  This one is great, you clip the hair near the root and then &amp;#34;wind&amp;#34; the rest in which gives you a much more natural curl without the crimp or fried ends.  My only complaint with this one (and it&#x27;s expensive so ... well) is that the clip is looser than my other one (it can&#x27;t be too tight or it wouldn&#x27;t work) so sometimes I misfire and have to repeat.  Still - it&#x27;s the best if you want natural looking spirals and even curls from root to hair ends.</li>
    <li> It was ok- took some practice getting used to working with it, curl didn&#x27;t always last a full work day.  However I was happy until less than a month after getting it, it no longer powers up.</li>
    <li> Love this curling iron with the rotating arm it&#x27;s so easy to use ,it only takes a few seconds to get to your correct temp.</li>
    <li> My roommate purchased this curling iron for over double the price at the area salon - and it&#x27;s the exact same curling iron. Can&#x27;t beat the deal! It&#x27;s a little hard to work with at first, but once you get the hang of it, it&#x27;s amazing! Definitely a great buy.</li>
    <li> I purchased my 1&amp;#34; Bio Ionic Style Winder and it has made styling my hair with curls SO much easier. The rotating barrel makes it so simple to curl, being that it basically twirls your hair for you in the right way (something I always had a hard time accomplishing). The only reason that I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because the rotating clamp does not always clamp down tight enough so my hair occasionally slips out of the iron, but nothing too bad just redo that curl. Great curling iron for those who have a hard time using curling tools like myself!</li>
    <li> It heats us and works well however, if you are use to a more traditional style that clasps the hair, you may have a difficult time using this. It takes me forever to curl my hair with this because my hair slips out. I usually get frustrated and plug in my cheap wand because it is easier for me using this wand.</li>
    <li> This product was not for me but maybe for others. It was well made, heat up fast, easy to roll and twist hair and very light. The only thing that made it difficult for me was I have no real experience with a curling iron and this might be why it really didn&#x27;t work for me. I always use a flat iron. Totally different..... The product is great, the only thing I did not light was that it did not clamp the hair hard enough. I am not used to this. Being that it didn&#x27;t, does allow the hair to easily come off when you want it to rather than you pulling your hair accidentally. So it works for others, it is a great product, it just didn&#x27;t work for me since I am a flat iron user. The clamp may or may not be an issue for people. It just was for me.</li>
    <li> Love this curler best one I have ever owned</li>
    <li> I would not have given this item any stars! This is a horrible curling iron. I tried it twice and it gave me no curl, but ripped pieces of my hair out and it&#x27;s still stuck on the curling iron. I have fine hair, so I was looking forward to using this and putting some body and even just waves would have been nice, but there were clumps of my hair all over my bathroom counter and a lot wrapped around the bottom of the barrel. Please don&#x27;t buy this unless you enjoy having you hair ripped out.</li>
    <li> I received my order, used the curling iron three time (over the course of two days) and now everytime I turn it on the screen reads &amp;#34;Err&amp;#34; and the curling iron won&#x27;t heat up. I&#x27;ve tried using it in different rooms of my apartment and have turned it on and off repeatedly, but nothing seems to work. To say I&#x27;m dissapointed is an understatement. I basically wasted $60. No wonder the product is discounted. I definitely don&#x27;t recommend ordering from this seller.</li>
    <li> So amazing! Love this product! Such a great curling iron and at an AMAZING price! Shipped fast my item arrived in the early days of my expected arrival! Very pleased.</li>
    <li> Heats up super fast and the cord doesn&#x27;t get stuck but the part that claps your hair is a bit flimsy. It works really well though, pretty curls!</li>
    <li> I was contemplating between this one and a CHI 1&amp;#34; curling iron.  I was very hesitant, but found the lower price to be enticing (especially when comparing to the original suggested price).  I have been very pleased with this thus far.  It does take some getting used to, but as other reviewers have commented, if you see the quick youtube video, you get the hang of how it&#x27;s supposed to be used.</li>
    <li> Heats up super quick, a little difficult to get used to, but a good purchase all the way around.</li>
    <li> Love this, have ordered two more for vacation home and a spare.</li>
    <li> I love this curling iron I use it all the time on my clients it was worht the price and holds up really well.</li>
    <li> The best curling iron out there!!!</li>
    <li> I have very thin hair and this gives it a curl that stays.  It relaxes, but stays.  It does take a bit to get used to, but It works so well.</li>
    <li> I am a hair stylist and love this curler. I first tried it during prom season and it curls very fast.  It takes a little getting used to but once you get the hang of it you&#x27;ll think it&#x27;s a breeze. There are three different settings depending on if your hair is fine, medium or coarse.  I can do tighter curls for prom hair or loose curls for a daily styled look. For girls that have a hard time keeping a curl, this iron will definitely do the trick.</li>
    <li> Recieved item it does not work.  Can not return because too many days have passed.  Never got to try it.  I&#x27;m very upset I&#x27;ve wasted this much money.</li>
    <li> This is one of the best curling irons I&#x27;ve ever used. I have fine/normal hair and it works great. I usully curl my hair in about 30 mins because it never curls the way I like and I have to keep going over it. With this it took me less then 10mins and I never have to go over it more then once. Depending on the way you use it you can style it different each time like beach waves, loose curls or tight curls. It does take a few mins to get use to it at first. I highly recommend this product</li>
    <li> My friend was on her 2nd one, she had the 1 1/2 inch (which was perfect for her super thick hair, and then she bought the 1 inch. I can&#x27;t believe I finally found a iron that makes curls that hold all day. Be sure to read the instructions, it takes a little practice to get used to using it. BEST IRON EVER!&lt;br /&gt;I think some of the negative reviews come from not understanding how to use it. You wind your hair starting halfway up, not at the ends of your hair, otherwise, the hair slides right out of the clamp....</li>
    <li> For its price I expected it to work much better.  Not overly impressed with the tool but the person I bought it from was great!</li>
    <li> It &amp;#34;ok&amp;#34;, not my favorite...</li>
    <li> I love how this curls and now I can&#x27;t live without it. However, in less than 6 months I have had 2 of them break. The barrell completely pulls out where it rotates. It is 18.95 to replace even in the first few weeks. Keep your upc and proof of purchase - I didn&#x27;t on the first one so it was $34.95 to replace it. I love the ease of use and how fast it works though so I will keep buying it.</li>
    <li> I watched a video before purchasing this and  I am very good with hair tools but the description of this tool should specify that it works best for medium to thick hair.  My hair was a bit too fine for it to work well. Instead of paying a re-stocking fee, return postage for me to send it back PLUS the 8.99 postage the company was going to charge me that they waived when I bought it, I decided to sell it myself locally and only took a $13 loss.  Not a good purchase for me.</li>
    <li> LOVE this curling iron. I use it at work. So I needed one for myself. I bought it in April, and now it&#x27;s november, it&#x27;s crapped out. I maybe used it 2 times a week. Not nearly as much as the ones at work. Which get switched out all the time. What a bummer... Looks like I&#x27;m back to flat iron curls. :-/</li>
    <li> Got this for a great price of $66.74. I have medium long, thick hair, and a toddler - so suffice to say, curling my hair is not on my daily to - do list. However, this curling iron worked SO quickly and gorgeously, that I think I&#x27;ll be looking a lot more presentable in the future. Curl holds great too and I haven&#x27;t even put any product in. GREAT tool.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t think I would recommend this for a beginner at curling your hair. However, if you know what you&#x27;re doing, it&#x27;s amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have hair that hangs down to my to the bottom of my rib cage, and with this tool it takes me about 10 minutes max to curl my entire head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some advice: it takes some practice to make sure your hair doesn&#x27;t get caught in the winding mechanism. I find it easiest to position the iron so that as you wind your hair in, the end of your hair is wrapping towards the tip of the iron, not towards the base where it can more easily get caught in the winding mechanism. Also, I find that I have to curl smaller sections of hair than I&#x27;m used to, and smaller sections mean tighter curls. If you like to curl larger sections of hair to get looser curls, I&#x27;d recommend going up a 1/2&amp;#34; in barrel size with this iron.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But this definitely is a time saver. And it gets hot hot hot, fast fast fast, which is great. Strongly recommend, and may invest in a larger size soon.</li>
    <li> I use this in the salon often. It glides effortlessly through the hair and has reduced my styling time significantly. It is a very attractive tool as well. Shipping was fast.</li>
    <li> I received this on December 26th. I used it twice, and then literally TWO DAYS later it has stopped working, it won&#x27;t turn on no matter how many different plugs I try to use. What a waste of money, buyer beware. I would love to exchange it but guess what? It costs $20 to replace with the warranty. Rip off!</li>
    <li> Heats up super fast. Easy to use. My long, thick hair holds curl all day long from using this iron.  Like that I can select specific temperature.</li>
    <li> I love this curling iron!  My hair stylist always uses it on me, and I love the curls it gives, so I wanted to get one for myself.  I had to watch youtube a couple of times to get the technique down, but after that, it was very easy.  This is a great curling iron.  The only thing I didn&#x27;t enjoy is that it would not grasp my daughter&#x27;s hair (her hair is a little &amp;#34;fine&amp;#34; but a regular curling iron or straightening iron works fine), and it wouldn&#x27;t curl her hair at all.  I have thicker, longer hair, and it works great!</li>
    <li> I am a hair stylist and I&#x27;ve never been so in love with a curling iron! I have all 3 of the different sizes. Easy to use on clients and myself! Definitely recommend this iron!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a professional hairstylist and this is the only iron I use. It&#x27;s simple and quick and very durable.  The shipper also gets the product sent out very quickly so you get it when you need it and not weeks later. I recommend everyone buy this iron!</li>
    <li> awesome curler, wish i would have gotten the bigger one though because i have a lot of hair!</li>
    <li> A few friends and I went to Drybar in NYC to get our hair done and I noticed that they use the same exact tool on your hair there only theirs is bright yellow. This is awesome. Everyone I know who has used it has loved it. It heats up really fast, it curls your hair to those &amp;#34;perfect beach waves.&amp;#34;  I find it a bit confusing to operate so I just wrap my hair around the barrel but it essentially does the same exact thing as if you clamp it.</li>
    <li> Bought this flat iron for my sister for Christmas and she Loves it! My hair stylist also uses this exact same kind of Straightner. Don&#x27;t really have anything negative I can say about this product at this time.</li>
    <li> Love this curling iron. It gets so hot so it works really fast.  Love that you can start at the top and roll from there.  Saves the ends from getting fried.  Makes beautiful curls or waves.</li>
    <li> Its okay hard to use. Really wanted to send it back. I should of bought a chi or a hot tool iron. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend buying one.</li>
    <li> LOVE this styling iron!! Curls last a long time, it gets HOT so you have to be careful! Don&#x27;t need to leave hair in it for long! It makes the prettiest curls in a short amount of time!!</li>
    <li> This curling iron does not work well with shorter hair. It does not hold the hair good enough to get a tighter curl.</li>
    <li> So far this iron does what the video has shown. I&#x27;ve read about the looseness of the clamp, but if it was tighter the hair wouldn&#x27;t slide through nicely.  Havent used it much, but seems to do what I want it to do.</li>
    <li> Great curling iron! Easy to use and very durable</li>
    <li> I first learned about this curling iron from the DryBar salon. I use it regularly and love it. It&#x27;s simple to use and my hair holds the curl. It is just as easy to have curly hair now as it was to have straight hair with my straightening iron. I definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I love this iron. But it didn&#x27;t come with the DVD or the iron sleeve like description says.</li>
    <li> Keep in it short and sweet....love it</li>
    <li> My friend turned me on to this curling iron.  She paid a lot more for hers.  I LOVE IT!  Great iron for the price</li>
    <li> would recommend good quality. It leaves your hair looking great. Used it several times and I have full confidence on the product.</li>
    <li> Fantastic! Best purchase ever! Works better than a CHI for curling hair. Gets extremely hot extremely fast!</li>
    <li> Just got this item and it does not work. power button won&#x27;t even turn on.  I was excited to try and opened it right away to find that its broken.  The material looks really cheap and plastic-like. I&#x27;ve never own a bio ionic product but this feels extremely cheap.  I don&#x27;t think its a real...... looks and feels fake, as the other reviewer had said.  I&#x27;m returning this tomorrow and better get my money back.</li>
    <li> I have curly, dry and pretty coarse hair. This works really good. I like to do my hair fast so I use a ionic blow styler and then Bio ionic Stylewinder and get&#x27;s the job done nicely.</li>
    <li> Works great, have to get used too curling left handed when doing my right side</li>
    <li> Updated on 11/2015: My wife uses a 1 1/2 inch primarily so this one got used maybe 4 to 5 times a month. Two years after purchase it will not heat up anymore. The screen is blank. It turns on but no heat. Very poor quality for the price. Her Conair from wallmart for $15(the one this one was to replace) is still working fine going on 7 years now. Disappointed with this &amp;quot;fancy&amp;quot; one. I would not buy this again as it is a very expensive paperweight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Original review 10/2013: According to her it is the nicest curling iron she has ever used. She usually buys the cheaper one from dept. stores but I talked her into buying this one as a upgrade. She told me she loves the fact she can set the temp. to any temp. she wans and it heats up in about 10 seconds. This is important for fine hair so she says. She loves the rotating barrel and simplicity of use. I can attest to the fact she has shaved about 15 min. off her &amp;quot;do my hair&amp;quot; time when we go out.</li>
    <li> This iron is Very user friendly, ordered the 1 inch and it is perfect for tight or tousled hair whatever the length</li>
    <li> Easy to use, temperature adjusts very quickly, overall great styling product!</li>
    <li> I received this curling iron 5 days ago. I have never loved a styling tool so much. It heats up almost instantly and delivers voluminous curls in half the time as other curling irons. The curls last over a couple of days, too. I have received so many compliments - people keep asking if I just got my hair done at a salon!</li>
    <li> I really love this curling iron. I&#x27;ve always had great difficulty curling my hair, but this iron has made the process so much easier. It heats up super fast and has heat settings high enough for the curl to hold most of the day in my fine, straight hair. It took a couple of tries to master this iron, the only set backs is that if you&#x27;re not careful you could pull some hairs out in the spinning process. So I take my time and this isn&#x27;t a problem for me.</li>
    <li> I read the other reviews before I purchased this curling iron, so I was ready to deal with some finessing/getting used to handling it and how it works. I have to say, once you figure out the fact that it doesn&#x27;t grip tightly like a &amp;#34;regular&amp;#34; curling iron, the results are amazing. It takes me maybe 15 minutes to get curls like I&#x27;ve never been able to achieve on my own before (salons, yes - at home, no). It gets really hot like a flat iron, so it only has to be held in place a few seconds. You can get bigger curls using larger sections, smaller with smaller sections...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ends of your hair will &amp;#34;collect&amp;#34; in the bottom opening of the clamp piece, but that&#x27;s how it sort of loops around to wind the end onto itself, so that&#x27;s expected. Again, it takes a few tries to figure out how to place your hair, how quickly to wind it, and how much will fit on the iron, but it works beautifully once you get that nailed.</li>
    <li> I bought this item and one one of my first few uses, with light handling, it snapped in half. I sent it back with the warranty it came with and haven&#x27;t heard anything since....</li>
    <li> Makes great curls.  I have Asian straight hair, and no curling iron really holds curls for me, even if I use a ton of hair spray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No joke, I don&#x27;t need hair spray with this.  I&#x27;ll make the curls the night before, and it&#x27;s still there the next day.  I have the temperature at  280-300.  It&#x27;s so nice and easy to use. I won&#x27;t go back to anything else (heck, I threw out all my other curling irons and hair setters).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be sure to use heat protection balm/oil before applying heat.  That&#x27;s a &amp;#34;duh&amp;#34; thing of course ;)</li>
    <li> Got to get used to it, but fantastic once you do!</li>
    <li> This is the one my stylist told me to order. Easy to use. Once I got the hang of it.</li>
    <li> I returned this item because it will not grasp my hair tight enough to curl it on the barrel.  The spring should be made with more tension.</li>
    <li> I saw this sitting on the shelf of the over priced salon I visit and was instantly put off by the $107 price tag. It&#x27;s just a curling iron, I told the girl. She told my stylist to finish me with this tool. After my highlights were done and I was dry, it took no time to whip this iron through my long, thick and full bodied naturally wavy hair. My finished lasted an entire week, even through bed head!This is not just a curling iron. I was thrilled to pieces and immediately found it on Amazon for $75. WORTH EVERY PENNY.</li>
    <li> Fast shipment.  Great product.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great curling iron and I really like being able to rotate it myself, big help when doing soft curls. My only gripe is that the product didn&#x27;t look mint when I pulled it out of the box. I don&#x27;t think it was used or anything it was just ever so slightly dingy. But of course I&#x27;m super happy with it!</li>
    <li> Check out youtube for some instructional videos. It&#x27;s got a learning curve but once you master it it works very nicely. Gets HOT and is pretty fast...curls seem to last.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, my opinion...the price is a bit high. Good curling iron though.</li>
    <li> Holy fry your hair! This device not only overheated but also literally burnt off a 2 inch section of my hair and charred all the remains. I returned this torture device.</li>
    <li> The clamp that holds the hair is not tight enough. The hair slides out. A bummer because when you style a client you do not want the hair to slide out. I like that it pivots around. That helps the wrist and does save time. Perhaps the one I got was defective. My daughter liked it and said the hair slides out too.</li>
    <li> Horrible experience!!! Would not recommend! Singed a large piece of my daughters hair off after only being clamped a few seconds. When we looked closer realized there was no way to control temperature, you can set on one of the lower settings using the minus button but it does not stay there just keeps shooting up to highest temperatures! Contacted  bio ionic directly and they were very unhelpfu, said they would not warranty anything sold by amazon... they did offer to have me send to them and if it was actually there product that was a factory defect they would replace....no apologies for the defective product! not only a very disappointing purchase but it ruined my daughters hair..</li>
    <li> My hair never holds curl! I mean EVER. Using the style winder in combo with Redken curling spray my hair still had curl 30+ hours later! Thirty hours! Plus it is so much quicker than a regular curling iron</li>
    <li> I really like this curling iron, however it took some time to get used to.  No, the clamp will not clamp tight on your hair like the regular version does.  The clip is more of a placeholder to get the curl started.  I should have known my hair would get wound up on the inside since it rotates, but I hoped there was something that would stop it based on the cost.  All in all it makes great curls and they hold well.  Better than any other curling iron I&#x27;ve used.  I have thick, coarse hair and used the hottest setting and hold each curl for 10 seconds.</li>
    <li> My friend who is a hairdresser at a very nice salon in Boston used this on me there, and it was one of the only curlers that I&#x27;ve had used on my hair that held curls all day and night. My hair is long, blonde, and fine, but I also used it on 2 friends who have the longest and thickest hair out of anyone I&#x27;ve met and even their curls held all night!! Something about this curler or twisty technology gets the curls to stay. They loosen a little giving nice big curls so go for the 1 inch for sure!!!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t care for this curling iron, had a hard time using it but it&lt;br /&gt;could just be me, burned my fingers a few times.</li>
    <li> I like this but it is kind of hard to figure out how to use. It doesn&#x27;t have a rest attached but instead came with a separate piece that you set it on when hot which is ok but a little inconvenient.</li>
    <li> I really enjoy this styling iron so much. It is easy to use and all I have to do is rotate instead of twirling with my wrist. I am so happy with my purchase! It also seems to make my heavy hair soft.</li>
    <li> I had gotten a recommendation for this product.  It didn&#x27;t get to me in time so I went to Target and bought a $20 curing iron that actually worked great.&lt;br /&gt;Finally received this product and it work just ok, not as good as the Target iron.</li>
    <li> Very hard to use even after instructions from hairdresser and watching video. Finally gave it away after burning my hands and my hair.</li>
    <li> When I received this the cd it came with on how to use it did not work and it was missing the piece the hot iron sits on while it&#x27;s turned on. It burned part of my furniture and the curls in my hair did not stay in.  They fell out after about 10 minutes.</li>
    <li> So I got my stylewinder and it seems to work fine except the screen that tells the temperature seems to have a defect. The screen is constantly changing from red to green to gray to green to red and the temperature is constantly jumping around. But the iron itself seems to work fine. I&#x27;m afraid it&#x27;s going to poop out on me in a few weeks. We shall see.</li>
    <li> I watched the included DVD to see how to use the curling iron, but my curls never came out looking like they did in the video. I asked my stylist, and once she showed me how to use it (not really what the dvd said to do), I get much better results. I love the iron, but if you do purchase it, ask your stylist how to use it instead of watching the dvd.</li>
    <li> I loved this Curly . He really makes the difference in time to produce alone, without the help of a hairdresser.&lt;br /&gt;Easy to use, safe and hair clips and helps you make various forms of hairstyle and make beautiful hair . I recommend .&lt;br /&gt;They say he is exactly equal to the DRYBAR and it really seems like it is. I highly recommend it !!!</li>
    <li> I am a professional and i LOVE this product. For non professionals, there will DEFINITELY be a learning curve.  It doesn&#x27;t work like a classic curling iron or even a Marcel.  Please be advised that WHOLESALE on this is $100 for professionals... meaning a non professional cost is $200. I would be leery of any of these posted under $100.</li>
    <li> Stopped working second time I used it. When I contacted the seller he said I have to send it to manufacture. I feel he should of replaced it.</li>
    <li> Love this so much!  Even heating across the barrel, quick heap at up, easy to roll once you get the hang of it!</li>
    <li> It came in a very timely fashion and it was very good condition. I would not order it again, I have medium short hair and it did not curl it.</li>
    <li> This iron us amazing!! However, I&#x27;ve had it for only a few short months and it broke in half! The return policy is up so I&#x27;m stuck without a lovely curling iron</li>
