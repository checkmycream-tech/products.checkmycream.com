      <li>and it was a great success.</li>
      <li>Very good, cheap and got here quick</li>
      <li>It could probably use a bit more breaking to make it even more flexible, but I&#x27;m pleased with the tan</li>
      <li>and i love it....</li>
      <li>I then soaked the pelt in the bathtub with some dawn dish soap to help soak out even more of the fat.</li>
      <li>If your not an armature like me, it may be ok</li>
      <li>The result was a nice and smooth skin side to the pelt.</li>
      <li>Simply the best product out there...</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll also be doing it at a buddy&#x27;s place instead of here at the condo, because the neighbors are pissed and my buddy&#x27;s shop has a lot more room.</li>
      <li>If you follow the directions, wash the hide once more, and then re-tan</li>
      <li>Works pretty good.</li>
      <li>As of now, the hide is in very good shape and didn&#x27;t present any issues during the tanning process.</li>
      <li>In exchange for skinning and butchering it, I was allowed to take home the hide and several pounds of meat (which tastes comparable to elk and is very good).</li>
      <li>The most important part of any tanning, is fleshing.</li>
      <li>It arrived quickly and was very easy to use.</li>
      <li>Easy instructions, easy to use.</li>
      <li>Easy to use.  </li>
      <li>You still have to work the hide to soften it, but this stuff makes it easy to do that.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve never tanned anything in my life and this made it really easy.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t believe how easy this stuff was to use</li>
      <li>In order to get good soft hides make sure you work them a lot otherwise</li>
      <li>Easy to use, smells fine.  </li>
      <li>It makes them look good but you will have to do a good job of breaking them in and either sand them down and use mink oil to soften.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I used this product to successfully tackle a pretty large project: Tanning the hide from a 290-pound llama.</li>
      <li>But the instructions are available online.</li>
      <li>THEN cover the oiled side of the skin with wax paper or Aluminum foil and lightly press it between a couple boards for a day.  </li>
      <li>Deer hide came out really nice and soft for the most part.</li>
      <li>Make sure you&#x27;ve defleshed pretty well too.</li>
      <li>Now I have a tanned, hair on, pelt that looks really cool and feels soft and amazing.</li>
      <li>Hides turned out nice and soft.</li>
      <li>Worked pretty well and is easy to use.  </li>
      <li>He followed the instructions, which are simple enough, and it turned out perfectly, so I have to say that I&#x27;m a fan.  </li>
      <li>I should also note this was my very first time doing this sort of thing</li>
      <li>Would recommend this to anyone who is interested in preserving their deer hides!  </li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone else in similar living conditions; this is certainly a line of work which requires more space, but more space costs money</li>
      <li>It not only worked faster, but also came out with a nice leathery texture.</li>
      <li>The hides come out whitish but please note that if you think this will come out soft and supple like from a professional tanner or taxidermist, this is not that good.</li>
      <li>I Tanned a small animal fur over two years ago and it is as beautiful as it was the day I finished it.</li>
      <li>, it will save you money and give you a useful skill)&lt;br /&gt;1</li>
      <li>This was my first attempt at tanning</li>
      <li>It seemed to work OK, but the next time I&#x27;m going to try preserving the skin by soaking it in gylcerol and alcohol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I bought this to use for a squirrel fur, but wound up loaning it to a friend first after he shot a weasel.  </li>
      <li>Thanks!</li>
      <li>, it works pretty well.</li>
      <li>but I believe it was me since it was my first hide</li>
      <li>We bought this to tan some rattlesnake skins--and it was doing a wonderful job, until my other half forgot about the skins</li>
      <li>As we are going to be raising rabbits for meat and hides this coming year, a good stock of this is definitely going to be necessary.</li>
      <li>Hopefully it&#x27;ll turn out just as good if not better than the pelt I tanned with Trapper&#x27;s Hide Tanning Formula.</li>
      <li>My snake skins and my rabbit skin turned out soft, supple, and nearly odor free.</li>
      <li>thanks</li>
      <li>you get your hide ready, slap this formula on the hide</li>
      <li>nothing much on how to treat snake</li>
      <li>Really  thought  </li>
      <li>and I don&#x27;t have much of that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t really break it in much though its going on a wall.</li>
      <li>As the heading says, it was a much appreciated gift</li>
      <li>Worked really well</li>
      <li>I used several different carbon steel knives and a hunk of leftover foam from a taxidermy deer form as a kind of makeshift fleshing beam.</li>
      <li>If you are planning to use it on snakeskin, be sure to coat the skin frequently, and keep in a fairly cool, dark place--there are you tube videos that can give you tips on snakeskin.</li>
      <li>The rabbit pelt turned out beautiful, and the slight odor the tanning solution created in the finished pelt was completely gone after I hung the pelt on the clothesline outside for a day or two.</li>
      <li>Not only did this remove a lot of extra fat from the llama, it also made the thicker areas of the hide more pliable.</li>
      <li>The use of a wire wheel is highly recommended.</li>
      <li>I was especially pleased with the rabbit skin--in the past I had encountered problems tanning white furred rabbit skins with other problems--mostly fur discoloration.</li>
      <li>As we are going to be raising rabbits for meat and hides this coming year, a good stock of this is definitely going to be necessary.k, it&#x27;s available in a larger size, as these small bottles don&#x27;t really cut it if you are planning on multiple projects.</li>
      <li>That being the case, I shouldn&#x27;t have trusted the tanning to my very busy and absent-minded</li>
      <li>The instructions on the back of the item I received had a huge stick over them that I was not able to cleanly removed.</li>
      <li>It works as well or better than other products I have tried, and has a very low odor compared to some.</li>
      <li>nothing too drastic,  Now trim off (using scissors) enough of the belly-scales to get the edges of the skin to lay completely flat and provide a smooth / continuous line.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;However, next time I tan a hide, I&#x27;ll certainly be trying out TruBond paint-on tan for backskins and wallhangers.</li>
      <li>I had these skins professionally framed, under glass,  6 weeks after tanning...</li>
      <li>AS far as I know this was just what was needed to begin a hobby in tanning leather.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started with the whole llama, which was donated by a local farm.</li>
      <li>I am very novice at this, and I managed to actually tan a hide.</li>
      <li>But disregard the direction that states not to let it sit in direct heat.</li>
      <li>After it has been dehydrated, soak it in salt water until it is soft.</li>
      <li>my hide did not come out soft</li>
      <li>With any luck, it&#x27;s available in a larger size, as these small bottles don&#x27;t really cut it if you are planning on multiple projects.</li>
      <li>my other half will probably end up getting me more rattle snakes over the course of the summer.</li>
      <li>(much to the chagrin of our neighbors in the condo next door) as I live in a small unit and didn&#x27;t have much room indoors.</li>
      <li>The hair will get stiff if the formula is left on, soapy water will wash it out Key part is the salting, do it multiple times making sure to get all moisture out.</li>
      <li>Skin on or off, comes out really supple with no slippage (as long as you properly flesh it out).</li>
      <li>I have found that no matter what type of professional tanning solution you use on snakeskin, if you keep it in the sun, it WILL curl up on the sides.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am definitely planning on buying this tanning solution again, as I am almost out of it and</li>
      <li>it dried, I broke the hide over the edge of the chest freezer, which worked pretty well, but took three days.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Works great. I used a mix of borax and salt for the steps that call for salt, and scraped the pelt with rocked up salt. Worked really well</li>
    <li> The product works perfectly. However, I feel that I should clarify the directions on the bottle. Yes you must remove all meat and fat or else this will not work. Dry the pelt in a layer of salt to preserve it. It may take a week to completely dry out. After it has been dehydrated, soak it in salt water until it is soft. Let it dry until it is not sopping wet but the skin side is moist to the touch. That&#x27;s when you apply this product. But disregard the direction that states not to let it sit in direct heat. I put this product on my goat skin and let it sit in the sun. It not only worked faster, but also came out with a nice leathery texture. I repeated this process of application and allowing it to sit in the sun for 2 days. I spread neatsfoot oil on it afterwards, then rubbed out the excess oil with baby powder. The result was a nice and smooth skin side to the pelt. I recommend buying neatsfoot oil and baby powder with this product if you dont have those things already. I should also note this was my very first time doing this sort of thing and it was a great success.</li>
    <li> Very good, cheap and got here quick</li>
    <li> I used it on a rattlesnake skin, rubbing the tanning oil on the flesh side.  It seemed to work OK, but the next time I&#x27;m going to try preserving the skin by soaking it in gylcerol and alcohol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update...I just did a second rattlesnake skin with this tanning oil.  The instructions provided with this product address the tanning fur-skins...nothing much on how to treat snake skins.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For snake skins, my recommendation is to lay the skin, scale-side down, on paper towels.  Rub the tanning oil generously on the flesh-side (only).  Its best to do this on a freshly prepared snake skin (all residual fat/ flesh scrapped off)...THEN cover the oiled side of the skin with wax paper or Aluminum foil and lightly press it between a couple boards for a day.  Pressing will assure that the skin stays flat,  the wax paper or foil keeps the oil from evaporating and the paper towels underneath soaks-up any oil the might migrate to the scale-side.  After 16-24 hrs, check the scale-side of the skin...with a damp cloth, wipe with the grain of the scales to remove any tanning oil that might have migrated fron the oiled flesh-side.  Re-oil the flesh side as before and press for another day or two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Getting oil on the scale-side may cause a slight brownish discoloration and some varnish-like sheen...nothing too drastic,  Now trim off (using scissors) enough of the belly-scales to get the edges of the skin to lay completely flat and provide a smooth / continuous line.  I had these skins professionally framed, under glass,  6 weeks after tanning...so they are stable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product does preserve snake skins!  I like it...now I know how to use it!</li>
    <li> Worked great to tan a couple rabbit furs. The instructions on the back of the item I received had a huge stick over them that I was not able to cleanly removed. But the instructions are available online. Product works as described.</li>
    <li> Simply the best product out there...great value with fabulous results!  Would recommend this to anyone who is interested in preserving their deer hides!  Thanks!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had to re-tan both the raccoon and coyote that I did with this as the hide failed to tan sufficiently on the first pass. If you follow the directions, wash the hide once more, and then re-tan the hide again, it works pretty well. Make sure you&#x27;ve defleshed pretty well too. The use of a wire wheel is highly recommended.</li>
    <li> great tanning product my hide did not come out soft but I believe it was me since it was my first hide</li>
    <li> Son traps and loves this stuff. He says it&#x27;s &amp;#34; awesome&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> We bought this to tan some rattlesnake skins--and it was doing a wonderful job, until my other half forgot about the skins LOL. When tanning rattlesnake, as in any tanning operation, reapplication of the product at regular intervals is CRUCIAL--especially in southern Arizona. That being the case, I shouldn&#x27;t have trusted the tanning to my very busy and absent-minded spouse!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I chose this tanning product based in reviews on various websites and you tube videos, and following the first failure, I have since tanned two rattlesnake skins and a rabbit skin with it. It works as well or better than other products I have tried, and has a very low odor compared to some. My snake skins and my rabbit skin turned out soft, supple, and nearly odor free. I was especially pleased with the rabbit skin--in the past I had encountered problems tanning white furred rabbit skins with other problems--mostly fur discoloration. That didn&#x27;t happen with this tanning solution. My only complaint at this point is that I was stupid and didn&#x27;t look for this tanning solution in a larger package size. The rabbit pelt turned out beautiful, and the slight odor the tanning solution created in the finished pelt was completely gone after I hung the pelt on the clothesline outside for a day or two. This is something you don&#x27;t want to use in enclosed, unventilated areas for too long--though it is low odor compared to some tanning products, it does still smell. If you are planning to use it on snakeskin, be sure to coat the skin frequently, and keep in a fairly cool, dark place--there are you tube videos that can give you tips on snakeskin. I have found that no matter what type of professional tanning solution you use on snakeskin, if you keep it in the sun, it WILL curl up on the sides.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am definitely planning on buying this tanning solution again, as I am almost out of it and my other half will probably end up getting me more rattle snakes over the course of the summer. With any luck, it&#x27;s available in a larger size, as these small bottles don&#x27;t really cut it if you are planning on multiple projects.

    <li> Worked pretty well and is easy to use.  This was my first attempt at tanning and I think my rabbit furs turned out nice.</li>

    <li> not  what  i  wanted.bottle  leaked.Really  thought  it  was  the  product  that  would  sofen  up  a  hide,and  make  the  hide  a  tan  color</li>
    <li> Easy to use, smells fine.  You still have to work the hide to soften it, but this stuff makes it easy to do that.</li>
    <li> don&#x27;t really no how to rate it, becuse it could have be operator error... I followed the directions but the hair keep coming off, when I tried to strech it. I ll try agian on somthing smaller.lol</li>
    <li> this is some of the best stuff i have used i like it and i will use it agian. thanks</li>
    <li> I am very novice at this, and I managed to actually tan a hide. Easy instructions, easy to use. Hard on the hair, so if your tanning hair on, careful to keep this off the the hair, or wash it off quickly if you get it on it</li>
    <li> I have done deer, coon and squirrel with this stuff, great for beginners. Skin on or off, comes out really supple with no slippage (as long as you properly flesh it out).</li>
    <li> These are great&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am using for Sea Otter Tanning of hides..</li>
    <li> Loved this product. It arrived quickly and was very easy to use.</li>
    <li> So the hide doesn&#x27;t stink anymore, but the back is really yellow &amp; greasy. Not sure if I did everything correctly though. If your not an armature like me, it may be ok</li>
    <li> Ive bought this item from deer processing plants and what not and i love it.... you get your hide ready, slap this formula on the hide... stretch the hide next few days and one cured the hide is soft, not hard at all except maybe the edges. i swear by this stuff, the results come out just as if you had brain tanned it.</li>
    <li> Followed instructions on bottle. No hair slippage. Did what it was suppose to do.</li>
    <li> Expensive and works just as well as alum and salt.  Probably wont use it again, I&#x27;ll just mix up the old fashioned tanning solution, but if I were to be lazy, this is how to do it.</li>
    <li> The most important part of any tanning, is fleshing. If you get a good fleshed hide, removed membrain and all this product will do it&#x27;s job. Simple instructions on the back of the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I stretched my bottle to its fullest. Tanned one small goat hide And a large one too. Then I kept about 1/3 of the bottle for a future project. Hides turned out nice and soft. I just had to work them a bit more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product</li>
    <li> Just what you need for the job at hand</li>
    <li> Easy to use.  Good directions.  Seems to work well enough.</li>
    <li> Does a good job tanning my skins.</li>
    <li> cheaper than a tannery</li>
    <li> I am a home tanner, 1st year, and I have used this product on deer hides, coon, fox, and coyotes. It works. Now this is a home tan for a commerical  formula. The hides come out whitish but please note that if you think this will come out soft and supple like from a professional tanner or taxidermist, this is not that good. It makes them look good but you will have to do a good job of breaking them in and either sand them down and use mink oil to soften.&lt;br /&gt;Examples:(if you have the time after hunting and trapping season, do this, it will save you money and give you a useful skill)&lt;br /&gt;1 bottle for a deer hide&lt;br /&gt;1 bottle for 4 fox hides&lt;br /&gt;1 bottle for 3 coon if 3xl or larger&lt;br /&gt;1 bottle for 10 muskrats&lt;br /&gt;1 bottle for 3 coyotes</li>
    <li> I bought this to use for a squirrel fur, but wound up loaning it to a friend first after he shot a weasel.  He followed the instructions, which are simple enough, and it turned out perfectly, so I have to say that I&#x27;m a fan.  Can&#x27;t wait to try it out myself.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never tanned anything in my life and this made it really easy. Now I have a tanned, hair on, pelt that looks really cool and feels soft and amazing. I can&#x27;t believe how easy this stuff was to use and I will use it again in the future. Read the directions and I am not sure how you can mess it up.</li>
    <li> This stuff works. I Tanned a small animal fur over two years ago and it is as beautiful as it was the day I finished it.</li>
    <li> This product is great. I wish it came in a larger bottle.</li>
    <li> Works as indicated.  Will use again for tanning deer hides.</li>
    <li> I used this product to successfully tackle a pretty large project: Tanning the hide from a 290-pound llama. It was quite an adventure, as I&#x27;d only used primitive brain tanning methods before, and on much smaller hides to boot. Even on animals as small as coyotes, brain tanning is a lot of work. This turned out to be just *slightly* less work than brain tanning, but has similar results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started with the whole llama, which was donated by a local farm. In exchange for skinning and butchering it, I was allowed to take home the hide and several pounds of meat (which tastes comparable to elk and is very good). I admit that it took a while to skin the animal because it was quite fat, and with me being a 120-pound woman, hanging the dead weight of such a large animal from the barn rafters to make goings easier was rather out of the question. When the hide was finally off the carcass, I took it home and stretched it out on the deck overnight, so I could flesh it in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With the amount of fat on the hide, fleshing was a tedious process. I used several different carbon steel knives and a hunk of leftover foam from a taxidermy deer form as a kind of makeshift fleshing beam. Once this was finally done, I proceeded to salt the hide on our deck (much to the chagrin of our neighbors in the condo next door) as I live in a small unit and didn&#x27;t have much room indoors. My tiny condo was hardly the proper place for such a large project, but I managed to make it work. Don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone else in similar living conditions; this is certainly a line of work which requires more space, but more space costs money and I don&#x27;t have much of that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Trapper&#x27;s Hide Tanning Formula instructions say to go straight to the salt bath after the fleshing and salting, but I took the dried hide and fleshed it even further with a sandpaper bit on a dremel tool. Not only did this remove a lot of extra fat from the llama, it also made the thicker areas of the hide more pliable. I then soaked the pelt in the bathtub with some dawn dish soap to help soak out even more of the fat. Seeing dirt in the bathwater, I shampooed and conditioned the fur at this point, too. Then let out the water and re-filled it for the salt bath.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After it was somewhat dry, I took it back out on the deck and rubbed the whole thing down with nearly two bottles of Trapper&#x27;s Hide Tanning Formula. I folded it up, brought it back inside, and let it sit in the corner for about 20 hours before bringing it out onto the deck again to unfold it and expose the leather side of the pelt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As it dried, I broke the hide over the edge of the chest freezer, which worked pretty well, but took three days. As of now, the hide is in very good shape and didn&#x27;t present any issues during the tanning process. It could probably use a bit more breaking to make it even more flexible, but I&#x27;m pleased with the tan so far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, next time I tan a hide, I&#x27;ll certainly be trying out TruBond paint-on tan for backskins and wallhangers. The makers of this product claim that the breaking process is not needed with their formula and I&#x27;d like to give that a test, because I have a second llama in the freezer that I need to tan yet! I&#x27;ll also be doing it at a buddy&#x27;s place instead of here at the condo, because the neighbors are pissed and my buddy&#x27;s shop has a lot more room. Hopefully it&#x27;ll turn out just as good if not better than the pelt I tanned with Trapper&#x27;s Hide Tanning Formula.</li>
    <li> Works pretty good. In order to get good soft hides make sure you work them a lot otherwise they will feel like a tarp with fur. Keeps the rot away though- have done a couple hides last year and they are still in tact well.</li>
