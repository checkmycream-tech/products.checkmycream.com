      <li>LOVE THIS and fast shipping!!!!</li>
      <li>I was expecting this to be a sweet balsam smell, but it smells more like pungent eucalyptus (I like eucalyptus, but this what not what I was expecting!).</li>
      <li>It seemed to work better than the original scent of the bags, though I also add peppermint oil to the mix.</li>
      <li>It has a strong lime scent that i cant explain.</li>
      <li>strong as soon as i added it to my evergreen candles, however the fragrance was gone in a day.</li>
      <li>Balsam fir oil is a great clean cool piney scent, and the pure essential oil is great for many things.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m very glad about the whole experience and that&#x27;s why I gave my review a 5 star rating  . . .  </li>
      <li>I am going to try to order cedar-wood or cypress oil to see if I have better luck finding a sweet conifer smell.</li>
      <li>If you are buying for another reason, they are fine.</li>
      <li>this is a strong balsam smell which I really enjoy using in my house.  </li>
      <li>Great essential oil to keep rodents out of your vehicle.</li>
      <li>This stuff is sold primarily for aromatherapy purposes, for use in an oil warmer or the like.  </li>
      <li>Great to use during the winter especially.</li>
      <li>but after I began &#x27;refreshing&#x27; the scent of the Fresh Cab packets with this Balsam Fir oil</li>

      <li>Good quality essential oil – thank you!</li>
      <li>For a true Balsam scent try out Goose Creek&#x27;s pine candle.  </li>
      <li>I really wish it had smelled like balsam since balsam is one of my favorite scents.  </li>
      <li>http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000GP9BE0/ref&#x3D;oh_o00_s00_i00_details  (MUCH more realistic fragrance.)</li>
      <li>Now Foods oils are high quality and this big bottle is a great value.</li>
      <li>The smell of eucalyptus (while pleasant) overpowers any other scent in this product.</li>
      <li>I started the fall with a number of Fresh Cab packets.  </li>
      <li>Old old time remedy for many many uses (Google Pine tree oil).</li>
      <li>I put a couple of drops in it and it smells like fresh cut pine trees in the kitchen.</li>
      <li>, my wife questioned whether it was even worth using it to disguise the smell of our outdoors garbage can.</li>
      <li>put drops in our wood stove steamer for constant nice smell</li>
      <li>oil, on the other hand, is the real deal, and smells GREAT.  </li>
      <li>The price was right and everything I needed  to know  was right  . . .  </li>
      <li>If it were called &amp;#34;pile of construction plywood smell&amp;#34; it would be right on target.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> 100% natural oil. Good value for $.</li>
    <li> Now is my favorite EO brand!!</li>
    <li> Smells like pine! I use this in a couple of ways. My wife has a wax warmer with a pine sent. I put a couple of drops in it and it smells like fresh cut pine trees in the kitchen. I also reused the &amp;#34;cab fresh&amp;#34; rodent repellant in my camper. I put a few drops on each to re-freshen the smell. Finally, I plan on putting a few drops on popsicle sticks and putting them in the artificial Christmas tree to make it smell like a real tree.  The wax warmer still smells like pine a week later. I am hoping the &amp;#34;cab fresh&amp;#34; will still smell good in the spring.</li>
    <li> I have searched exhaustively for that scent of Christmas trees from my childhood. This, alas, is not it. The smell of eucalyptus (while pleasant) overpowers any other scent in this product. It smells a bit like the Vapo-Rub of my childhood winter memories, so I will use this in my bedroom when I have a cold. The search for the perfect Christmas tree scent continues!</li>
    <li> Great aroma, earthy and rich, love it</li>
    <li> Great product and delivered faGreat product and delivered fastst</li>
    <li> This stuff is sold primarily for aromatherapy purposes, for use in an oil warmer or the like.  It has a nice, woodsy scent like a Christmas tree.    This is the pure essential oil, so if you want to use it on your body (massage oil, for instance), you will need to dilute it in a neutral-scented carrier oil like grapeseed or jojoba.  Applying the oil directly to the skin may cause irritation.    I use it to repel mice.  You fill a cloth bag with fine wood shavings or sawdust, then put a few drops of the essential oil on the bag and place it in an enclosed space like a closet.  I also add a few drops of peppermint oil.  Mice hate the smell, but it will leave the area smelling like Christmas exploded.  When the scent wears out, just add a few more drops.    I only wish it were available in bottles larger than 1 ounce.</li>
    <li> Love buying essential oils from Amazon.....good prices....good products.</li>
    <li> As soon as I opened the box, I knew the bottle was broken. Called the seller, after being \\&quot;ordered\\&quot; to \\&quot;give me the order number\\&quot;, they said \\&quot;sending new one\\&quot;, and hung up. VERY strange foreign accent customer service rep. I do not want a new bottle. I did not have a chance to ask for a refund.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will update when I get the new bottle. Also, regarding the scent. Smells similiar to vicks vapor rub. Not sure how other reviewers say it smells like balsam. NOTHING like it at all. Not sure what this is. Does not smell good.</li>
    <li> That&#x27;s what this smells like. I had hoped for &#x27;Christmas Tree in a Bottle&#x27;. Just a Q-tip dipped in it smells so off-putting when placed in our fake Xmas tree, my wife questioned whether it was even worth using it to disguise the smell of our outdoors garbage can. (Trade one overly pungent smell for another?) It ended up getting tossed into the trash. Not worth the return postage. I guess Christmas Tree is in the nose of the beholder?  Am still looking for something that actually smells like &#x27;Oh Tannenbaum&#x27;. (Edit 12/27/11: I found it. It&#x27;s called &#x27;Smell of the Tree&#x27;:   http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000GP9BE0/ref&#x3D;oh_o00_s00_i00_details  (MUCH more realistic fragrance.) I&#x27;ve lived in both East and West, have bought all kinds of them, and never had any real conifer that smelled like the stuff in this bottle of &#x27;Balsam Fir Oil&#x27;. Maybe it&#x27;s good for sore muscles, or if somebody faints?</li>
    <li> I knew what I was ordering before I placed my order.  The price was right and everything I needed  to know  was right  . . .  I knew what was doing from the start so it was  no-brainer.  I received the oil when the seller said I would  . . .  I tried out the oil at that time  . . .  I was exactly what I wanted.  I&#x27;m very glad about the whole experience and that&#x27;s why I gave my review a 5 star rating  . . .  and I would do the whole thing again in a heartbeat  . . .  thank you very much  ! ! ! ! !</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re expecting it to smell like a fresh balsam fir tree, you&#x27;ll be very disappointed.  It does have a strong wood odor like cheap whitewood lumber, but definitely not fragrant balsam needles!  Nothing &#x27;green&#x27; about the smell like the picture on the bottle.  If it were called &amp;#34;pile of construction plywood smell&amp;#34; it would be right on target.  Maybe they squeezed the tree after all the needles fell off?</li>
    <li> It smells just like Acadia National Forest in Maine!  I fell in love with this place this last fall and this reminds me of it.  I love the calming smell.  I use it in a mister!</li>
    <li> This Balsam Fir Oil did not smell like I had expected it to.  I am from Maine and was looking for the oil to refresh some Maine Balsam Fir pillows.  Unfortunately this smelled like Pine not Balsam Fir.</li>
    <li> Now Foods oils are high quality and this big bottle is a great value. This scent is amazing and I love to difuse this smell during the winter holidays. Just lovely smell.  Pure smell for sure.</li>
    <li> Great essential oil to keep rodents out of your vehicle.</li>
    <li> Good price on the oil. i  use it as a final rinse and go over o  floors and counter tops!!</li>
    <li> It smells just like a real Christmas tree.  I can&#x27;t have a real tree because of allergies, but this oil makes our tree smell so real.  Fast shipping from the company too.</li>
    <li> and glad I found it.  Use a little in my boar bristle hair brush after reading that was good for both, also rubbed a little into the bottom of one wooden drawer and it smells good.  Put some out at Christmas when our tree proved to be less aromatic than I hoped.  I like this and will get more when I run low.</li>
    <li> As with all NOW EO&#x27;s this is an excellent quality oil. It is very fragrant and earthy while having a hint of sweetness. This oil would work fantastically in a winter blues buster blend for anyone who thinks that balsam fir is reminiscent of camping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: The FDA does NOT grade EO&#x27;s. This means that there is NO SUCH THING as &amp;#34;Therapeutic Grade&amp;#34; as some would try to sell you. Do your research and you will find that purchasing a &amp;#34;Therapeutic Grade&amp;#34; EO is the same as purchasing Snake Oil from a traveling Circus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This oil is better than that for a fraction of those pseudo TG&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> It does not smell like I expected, but I will still use it anyway.</li>
    <li> I tried this to keep mice out of our RV.  I always set a number of traps in the trailer and catch mice all year.  I started the fall with a number of Fresh Cab packets.  I continued to catch mice but after I began &#x27;refreshing&#x27; the scent of the Fresh Cab packets with this Balsam Fir oil I stopped catching mice in the traps.  So far this spring I see no droppings.  We have had a terrible mouse problem for years and this seems to be working.  I have used Peppermint oil in the past with little success, but the RV smelled nice while I was cleaning up all the mouse poop.</li>
    <li> Apparently, in Japan, there are people who actual research the salutary effects of being in the woods. When the researcher himself was asked what he does when he can&#x27;t actually go to the woods, he said he inhales the scent of fir trees using an essential oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used this aromatherapy oil many times and find it incredibly relaxing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You don&#x27;t need any special equipment.&lt;br /&gt;Either put one drop in your palm, rub it with the other, and inhale; or, put a few drops on a tissue and inhale.</li>
    <li> I have ordered other essential oils by NOW and have been extremely happy...until now...&lt;br /&gt;This does not smell like balsam fir at all. Both my husband and I think it has a moldy bread smell. Not happy with this at all and I made the mistake of ordering 3 bottles to save on the shipping. Bad idea!!!  Would not order it again!</li>
    <li> this is a strong balsam smell which I really enjoy using in my house.  Good value</li>
    <li> I use it for an oil defuser that I have. My other oils that I put there last and last for months on end. This one will dry out in a day. Very cheap in that sense. I do like the smell though, so that&#x27;s why it&#x27;s 2 stars.</li>
    <li> This oil is pure Christmas tree! We haven&#x27;t gotten our tree yet, but if you came for a visit today, you would be looking for one! The next best thing to the real thing. Now, I can get a little Christmas fix year round! Love it and will purchase again.</li>
    <li> A bit pricey, but otherwise it fits my requirements.</li>
    <li> NOW Foods essential oils are very good, pure, therapeutic grade oils. This balsam fir EO is no exception. I use these oils in natural soaps I make as well as cleaning supplies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is spot on, woodsy and and piney. Just like Christmas. Very nice. Superb value.</li>
    <li> I like balsamic scents (Peru balsam is also nice), so of course I like this. Mixes well with other wood oils (cedar, sandalwood) as well as sharper green scents (rosemary, lavender).</li>
    <li> mixed with two other oils for a broken hand.  Amazing how quickly the bone healed and how much it eased the pain.&lt;br /&gt;.</li>
    <li> as an essential oil is can be strong so use sparingly, but it helped our home smell as if we had a fresh tree for the holidays</li>
    <li> I ordered a different brand of balsam oil on Amazon and was really disappointed... when it came, the label was not labeled 100% oil and I suspect it was not.  It smelled very artificial.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This oil, on the other hand, is the real deal, and smells GREAT.  I burn it in a diffuser and am very happy with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this helps.</li>
    <li> Excellent to use during massage or reflexology treatments.  It smells awesome as well !!</li>
    <li> Item arrived on time.  Item as described.  Works well for the defined purpose.</li>
    <li> I had hoped that a piece of gauze soaked in the oil under my little fake Christmas tree would make for a great scent, but across the room, I can&#x27;t smell a thing.  It does smell VERY good in the bottle, so will find other uses.</li>
    <li> Love this product! Arrived on time, priced well, and packaged well.</li>
    <li> i have been ordering very expensive little pouches of a product that i can&#x27;t remember the name of - dah.....to keep around my house, that are suppose to prevent mice from even wanting to come inside.  i bought this oil and every now and then i add more to each pouch.  it smells nice and hopefully it&#x27;s working.</li>
    <li> This is a great smelling oil!</li>
    <li> But definetly not aromatic. Don&#x27;t buy this if you are looking for that smell that you experienced in the north woods. It may be genuine and pure but it does really just smell like a twig. I am not a scent blender or experienced in working with oils.&lt;br /&gt;Just adding a drop of this to a candle or scent warmer won&#x27;t do the trick. If anyone wants to tell me how to use the two bottles I purchased, I&#x27;ll be happy to learn.</li>
    <li> Its not a strong scent not over powering like some pine scents I would recommend to those who dont want to get overpowered by the smell.</li>
    <li> Being brand new to essential oils and holistic aromatherapy, I started by buying oils that I felt would benefit me by scent (old familiar scents)to bring back memories or to use as holistic therapy.  Essential oils have their place secured in a natural beauty routine; they are natural, chemical-free alternatives. ‘NOW Foods’ seem to come with the best reviews and so far all the oils are oils of substance and as I test them, they seem to be actual natural oils with limited or no fillers.</li>
    <li> Our place in the mountains is a part-time residence, and may go a couple of weeks at a time without anyone being there.  We leave a few drops of this stuff in strategically placed locations when we&#x27;re away, and it keeps the place smelling clean and fresh until we return.  Has a &#x27;mountainy&#x27; scent to it.</li>
    <li> As soon as I opened the box I knew that this wasn&#x27;t what I had wanted. First of all, the seal was broken on the bottle and the lid was partially opened, causing this nauseating smell to infiltrate all of the other items in my order. I was expecting this to be a sweet balsam smell, but it smells more like pungent eucalyptus (I like eucalyptus, but this what not what I was expecting!). Not at all what I wanted. I had previously bought high quality balsam oil from a health food store and it was divine. I am going to try to order cedar-wood or cypress oil to see if I have better luck finding a sweet conifer smell.</li>
    <li> Good quality essential oil – thank you!</li>
    <li> Very strong don&#x27;t need more than a pin prick.</li>
    <li> Love balsam fir needle oil. Smells like a forest! NOW brand doesn&#x27;t disappoint.</li>
    <li> THE AROMA DOESN&#x27;T FILL THE ROOM</li>
    <li> smells just like a christmas tree! I put this stuff everywhere during the holidays!</li>
    <li> Old old time remedy for many many uses (Google Pine tree oil). Tried when all else failed and I think it is doing the job. Actually I would like to find the Pine Tree Sap which does even more.</li>
    <li> I read reviews about smell not right but I thought maybe people didn&#x27;t quite know what balsam fir smelled like and we work closely with evergreens of many types so I ordered it anyway and it really does not smell like ant&#x3D;y tree I&#x27;ve ever smelled.-sorry</li>
    <li> Balsam fir is my favorite tree and my favorite scent.  This oil is authentic.  I love it.  The price is very reasonable, too.</li>
    <li> i guess i expected the frangrance to last longer.  strong as soon as i added it to my evergreen candles, however the fragrance was gone in a day.</li>
    <li> Great product, love it&lt;br /&gt;I put drops in our wood stove steamer for constant nice smell</li>
    <li> The oil is very fragrant itself but its fragrance does not seem to permeate a room all that much. Applying many drops inside a terra-cotta small diffuser and also some on the outside of it helps increase the effect.</li>
    <li> Great to use during the winter especially. It has a natural hint of vanilla.</li>
    <li> I use this oil mixed with peppermint essential oil and carry them with rubbing alcohol to soak cedar shavings (pet bedding) and pack little muslin[[ASIN:B00A92YJKQ 2.75x4 Inch Double Drawstring Cotton Muslin Bags 50 Count Pack]] sachets and toss all around nooks and crannies of my home to repel rodents.  I made this to be very similar to the product FRESH CAB [[ASIN:B00D8GXRM6 4 Pack Frshcab Rodnt Repell]] (at 1/4 the price) so that it is natural and non toxic to you, your family, pets and and wont kill the rodents either.  Plus, your house smells nice!</li>
    <li> Smells like a Christmas tree.  I&#x27;ve mainly added it to a previously bought mouse repellent bag when I had problems with mice in my previous car.  It seemed to work better than the original scent of the bags, though I also add peppermint oil to the mix.</li>
    <li> Balsam fir oil is a great clean cool piney scent, and the pure essential oil is great for many things.  We use this often during cold and flu season in the diffuser and in a homemade &amp;#34;Vicks&amp;#34; mixture.  Great price too</li>
    <li> This has a great fragrance and very strong I might add! Perfect for the holiday season. I make my own cleaning products and this smells lovely!</li>
    <li> The Christmas tree this year did not smell the house the way I wanted. Bam a few drops and the house was a winter wonderland.</li>
    <li> I bought this to rescent the bags which I purchased to repel mice.  It seemed to be working until the weather was cold and we were away for a few weeks along with our cats who are very good mouse hunters. When we returned the house had to be professionally cleaned inside and out and the mouse repellent bags had mouse droppings on them so the scent is obviously no longer repelling the mice.  Do not recommend for that purpose.  If you are buying for another reason, they are fine.</li>
    <li> I bought this to mix with coconut oil and massage into the bone spur in my foot. It&#x27;s not as good as another brand I buy, but it does the job just a little slower. Smells wonderful in the diffuser.</li>
    <li> Excellent Service;  Accurate Product Description</li>
    <li> Great product. Highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Beautiful.  Fast delivery.  Thanks.</li>
    <li> Great Product! Very Fast &amp; Secure Shipping! Thanks!</li>
    <li> With a great woodland smell. I love using it in my wax melter for aromatherapy. Just a couple of drops fills a whole room with a natural scent.</li>
    <li> Fast ship and great oil!!!</li>
    <li> I found the scent of this to be weak and did not fill the room with the aroma.  I wanted to use it for a woodstove steamer.</li>
    <li> This balsam fir and also Siberian fir (I have both) are the two most closest to Christmas tree or outdoor woodsy smell. Both are very nice and spot on.</li>
    <li> This smells like pine, not balsam.  I grew up in Maine so I can tell the difference!  Very strong, sharp, scent.  Smells like a pine cleaner. Overwhelming.  I really wish it had smelled like balsam since balsam is one of my favorite scents.  For a true Balsam scent try out Goose Creek&#x27;s pine candle.  It smells exactly like balsam needles.</li>
    <li> LOVE THIS and fast shipping!!!!</li>
    <li> NOW Foods makes a fantastic eucalyptus oil which I love! But balsam fir needle oil smells funny.&lt;br /&gt;There is a moldy odor to it. I am using it together with another pine fragranced oil plus diluting it with a good base.</li>
    <li> I gave it three stars because it is pure oil. I love woodsy and tree smells but this one is by far way to strong and gives me a headache. It smells like a potent cleaning chemical. Thats my opinion. It doesnt smell like balsm to me. I guess im use to yankee candle. Very dissapointed in this purchase. It has a strong lime scent that i cant explain.</li>
    <li> Sorry, but was very disappointed in the scent.  I had bought  balsam fir from another company and put it in diffuser on the Christmas tree &amp; it smell just like a real balsam fir.  I can&#x27;t describe this smell but I didn&#x27;t like it.</li>
