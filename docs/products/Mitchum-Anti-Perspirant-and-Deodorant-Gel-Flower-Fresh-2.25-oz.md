      <li>I love this deodorant!</li>
      <li>This is my favorite deodorant!  </li>
      <li>This product has a really nice fragrance</li>
      <li>The Mitchum smelled nice, however.</li>
      <li>While when it it is very hot I still end up sweeting with this product I find it to be a very pleasant smelly and comfortable product to use.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried almost every kind, type, brand, scent, newest, best whatever promises to finally do the job for me.</li>
      <li>I love Lady Mitchum.</li>
      <li>Can not get any better.  </li>
      <li>love this Mitchum</li>
      <li>I need to read better the description.</li>
      <li>Keeps me dry &amp; smelling wonderful.  </li>
      <li>I recommend this to anyone who needs to stay dry and smell great during the day!</li>
      <li>a long time Mitchums user, this is a very pleasant scent.</li>
      <li>Light a lovely fragrance.</li>
      <li>As it turned out this was the very thing I wanted and does a great job keeping me fresh and decidedly non-offensive even in the funkiest of situations like 98% humidity during the dog days of summer.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Equally strong to a clinical brand at a fraction of the cost.</li>
      <li>It does not stain my clothes, and it does not have a strong scent.</li>
      <li>Works fine.</li>
      <li>Now it is called Oxygen Advanced Control.</li>
      <li>It really controls odor and smells nice without clashing with body chemistry or perfume.</li>
      <li>I am frequently sweating from isolation gowns but this deodorant keeps me smelling good.  </li>
      <li>He thought it was him at first, but was glad it wasn&#x27;t...and that my pit odor lingered in the kithen.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t work as well as the original.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s actually so strong that I shower before bed and don&#x27;t have to apply any deodorant and still smell fresh in the morning.</li>
      <li>This wasn&#x27;t the gel its a solid and it doesn&#x27;t seem to work as good as the gel.</li>
      <li>oily moist skin is an environment condusive to bacteria &amp; why I&#x27;ve never found adequate odor control.</li>
      <li>Wasn&#x27;t I right... plus the scent is kind of strong and mixed with sweat becomes offensive.</li>
      <li>This actually works &amp; not because it has a strong smell that is more powerful than body odor.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m reviewing Lady Mitchum advanced Oxygen Pure Fresh.</li>
      <li>This stuff goes on nice and smooth and doesn&#x27;t feel wet, sticky or slimy.</li>
      <li>It keeps me dry and smelling great even in my high stress job.  </li>
      <li>I prefer Mitchum for Women because it controls odor and perspiration better than most I have tried in the past.</li>
      <li>It works well during an exercise, hot AZ summers, and just the every day.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t work for me unfortunately, however it does smell awesome!</li>
      <li>the idea of being totally safe on the deodorant end of things is a big plus.  </li>
      <li>This invisible solid Mitchum, has become my favorite because it does the job.  </li>
      <li>Everybody wants to sell the powder scent (yuck!)</li>
      <li>Exactly what I wanted.</li>
      <li>That doesn&#x27;t make much sense!</li>
      <li>I have no sour sweet smell that develops as it always has before with everything else I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
      <li>this is by far the best deodorant I have ever used and this scent in solid is hard to find that&#x27;s why I ordered it online.</li>
      <li>and I was very embarassed with the sweat on my clothes in my armpits.</li>
      <li>like to use clinical strength deodorant (Degree) to ensure that I smell fresh ALL day, but I feel self conscious about carrying one in my bag.</li>
      <li>but I feel like it doesn&#x27;t cover odor very well.  </li>
      <li>So much for 48 hr protection.</li>
      <li>Works better than any other deodorant, in my opinion.</li>
      <li>Now surely, that sounds like enough funk to bat an eye out, but nevertheless, the old Mitchem took care of the problem and this new one doesn&#x27;t.</li>
      <li>Hot &amp; humid here in the Midwest &amp; every day for nearly a week that I&#x27;ve been using this</li>
      <li>the men&#x27;s version is still my &amp;#34;go to&amp;#34; on weekends- it last me all day, the whole night dancing, and most of the next morning when I choose to roll out of bed at 8 and then start cleaning up at 10ish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>And with the Subscribe and Save, I get it for a decent price.</li>
      <li>This passed the wear all day and still smell decent in the morning test.......  but take your shower within two hours of when you wake (I get up at 5 for work).  </li>
      <li>Never fails to keep me fresh and dry.</li>
      <li>I sweat A LOT and have tried all the products with the high amount of aluminum</li>
      <li>Fresh scent is not overbearing and this brand/type is the only one that keeps me from sweating</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad Amazon offers the solid stick because you can generally only find the gels in stores.</li>
      <li>I bought this because the Oxygen thing seemed like it might be worth a try even though I currently have 15 containers of unsatisfactory antiperspirant/deodorant on hand.</li>
      <li>My favorite is the clear solid as it doesn&#x27;t leave white stuff on your clothes.</li>
      <li>that is until they switched to a new and &amp;#34;(un)improved&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>It will last a full day, even well into the next day with no issues.  </li>
      <li>Felt reluctant to buy this Mitchum full size due to that factor.</li>
      <li>Didn&#x27;t last last as long as I expected but still good.</li>
      <li>Thought I was buying the clear.</li>
      <li>Mitchum has a soft, feminine scent that isn&#x27;t overpowering.  </li>
      <li>Also, I think that leaving deodorants in the bathroom cuts their life short because of being exposed to too much humidity.</li>
      <li>My old deodorants stopped working and began clogging my pores (Secret/Dove/Degree/Suave).</li>
      <li>My skin is still oily even at 60+ years old &amp; my guess is</li>
      <li>It was not bad, but I do not like not even a tiny wet spot under my arms.</li>
      <li>Change it back to the old stuff!</li>
      <li>it worked like no other.</li>
      <li>Now, I&#x27;m used to using it in central Texas where is hot, and even during the summer it keeps me 100% dry.</li>
      <li>(that you generally have to apply at night and sometimes stung).  </li>
      <li>Nothing on the market seems to come close to this mitchum solid clear bar.</li>
      <li>This product works as well as expected, but I don&#x27;t like the scent much.</li>
      <li>Better hold then dove and secret.</li>
      <li>The only down side I noticed is that when i went to Mexico to a place that is hot and humid, it did not keep me dry all the time.</li>
      <li>I am an active female and usually buy the Mitchum mens advanced control.  </li>

<li> The amount of Aluminum Zirconium Tetrachlorohydrex Gly (the active ingredient) in this is 20%, which is the equivalent to clinical strength deodorants/ antiperspirants.</li>

<li> I wouldn&#x27;t call it &amp;#34;Pure Fresh&amp;#34; bt slightly fruity.</li>
<li> I wish they hadn&#x27;t discontinued the previous one they had....</li>
<li> I have very active lifestyle and sweat a lot and shower twice a day.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Does not work great. use to use all the time but i feel theyve done something to formula</li>
    <li> This product has a really nice fragrance but I feel like it doesn&#x27;t cover odor very well.  Definitely keeps you dry though.</li>
    <li> I am an active female and usually buy the Mitchum mens advanced control.  This passed the wear all day and still smell decent in the morning test.......  but take your shower within two hours of when you wake (I get up at 5 for work).  For me.... the men&#x27;s version is still my &amp;#34;go to&amp;#34; on weekends- it last me all day, the whole night dancing, and most of the next morning when I choose to roll out of bed at 8 and then start cleaning up at 10ish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this Mitchum brand- It works well during an exercise, hot AZ summers, and just the every day.</li>
    <li> Can not get any better.  the idea of being totally safe on the deodorant end of things is a big plus.  I used it years ago and somehow got weaned away from this terrific product.  Back again and will not leave.</li>
    <li> I have problems with residue staining my clothing. I like the Mitchum gel antiperspirants, except for the smell.</li>
    <li> When I moved to FL my deodorant stopped working, I switched to Lady Mitchum and it did the trick!</li>
    <li> Great price for antiperspirant.  I prefer to purchase cruelty-free products, and Mitchum is the only antiperspirant I&#x27;ve found that doesn&#x27;t test on animals.  Brands like Tom&#x27;s of Maine (which is owned by a larger conglomerate) are deodorants, not antiperspirants, so you don&#x27;t get the same effectiveness.  Mitchum has a soft, feminine scent that isn&#x27;t overpowering.  I prefer the solid stick to the gel.  I&#x27;m glad Amazon offers the solid stick because you can generally only find the gels in stores.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m reviewing Lady Mitchum advanced Oxygen Pure Fresh. I&#x27;ve tried almost every kind, type, brand, scent, newest, best whatever promises to finally do the job for me. Wetness isn&#x27;t my big issue. Odor is. My skin is still oily even at 60+ years old &amp; my guess is oily moist skin is an environment condusive to bacteria &amp; why I&#x27;ve never found adequate odor control. I bought this because the Oxygen thing seemed like it might be worth a try even though I currently have 15 containers of unsatisfactory antiperspirant/deodorant on hand. Well my perseverance has finally paid off. This actually works &amp; not because it has a strong smell that is more powerful than body odor. I don&#x27;t know why it works. Maybe it works with my body chemistry. Hot &amp; humid here in the Midwest &amp; every day for nearly a week that I&#x27;ve been using this I have no sour sweet smell that develops as it always has before with everything else I&#x27;ve tried. I&#x27;m going to pitch out all other deodorant antiperspirants &amp; start to stockpile this stuff!</li>
    <li> Never fails to keep me fresh and dry.</li>
    <li> Thought I was buying the clear. Waste of money. Doesn&#x27;t work like the gel Mitchum. Sticky. Shows on clothes. Disappointed. I need to read better the description.</li>
    <li> This product works as well as expected, but I don&#x27;t like the scent much. I wouldn&#x27;t call it &amp;#34;Pure Fresh&amp;#34; bt slightly fruity.</li>
    <li> I love this deodorant! Everybody wants to sell the powder scent (yuck!) which gives me a headache. Fresh scent is not overbearing and this brand/type is the only one that keeps me from sweating</li>
    <li> This is the only deodorant that works for me. It does not stain my clothes, and it does not have a strong scent. Now, I&#x27;m used to using it in central Texas where is hot, and even during the summer it keeps me 100% dry. The only down side I noticed is that when i went to Mexico to a place that is hot and humid, it did not keep me dry all the time. It was not bad, but I do not like not even a tiny wet spot under my arms.</li>
    <li> Works great! Better hold then dove and secret. But cheaper at walmart! It&#x27;s about 2 something!</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t work for me unfortunately, however it does smell awesome!</li>
    <li> The product arrived quickly and works great!</li>
    <li> How can you  call this &amp;#34;Alcohol Free&amp;#34; when Stearyl Alcohol is the 2nd ingredient on the list??? That doesn&#x27;t make much sense!</li>
    <li> I use the gel and I prefer it over the solid stick. I love Lady Mitchum. I use the gel all the time.</li>
    <li> I spend a lot of time outdoors doing strenuous work that makes me sweat bad. I need a good anti-persperant/ deodorant to keep me from well, stinking. This is one of the best I&#x27;ve tried. I will and do recommend for women to try this one.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t last last as long as I expected but still good.</li>
    <li> I wish they hadn&#x27;t discontinued the previous one they had....This is a close second though. Since it seems I can no longer buy the other one, This one will be my product of choice. Nothing on the market seems to come close to this mitchum solid clear bar.</li>
    <li> It wasn&#x27;t creamy enough and dragged upon application. And after about a week, it gave me an underarm, itchy rash. Haven&#x27;t had one of those since I was a teenager in the last century! I went back to my well-used Suave.  The Mitchum smelled nice, however.</li>
    <li> Light a lovely fragrance. Works fine. Recommend !!!</li>
    <li> Bought this Mitchum deo/antiperspirant at my local CVS. Paid around $7 for it. I have very active lifestyle and sweat a lot and shower twice a day. I have to switch deodorants often because my body gets used to the pH and deos stop working. This Mitchum only worked well for about a week before I had to switch again. So much for 48 hr protection. I usually buy the travel size deodorants for a buck or so because I have to waste them anyway before a month comes around. Felt reluctant to buy this Mitchum full size due to that factor. Wasn&#x27;t I right... plus the scent is kind of strong and mixed with sweat becomes offensive. Also, I think that leaving deodorants in the bathroom cuts their life short because of being exposed to too much humidity. But even not keeping this Mitchum in the bathroom didn&#x27;t save it from going to the trash.</li>
    <li> I sweat A LOT and have tried all the products with the high amount of aluminum (that you generally have to apply at night and sometimes stung).  While when it it is very hot I still end up sweeting with this product I find it to be a very pleasant smelly and comfortable product to use.</li>
    <li> Ever since I was a kid, I would sweat a lot and I was very embarassed with the sweat on my clothes in my armpits. I found Mitchum a long time ago and I have used it since. My favorite is the clear solid as it doesn&#x27;t leave white stuff on your clothes.</li>
    <li> I love this deodorant! My daughter and I are very hard to hold. We both sweat a lot and are athletic. This stuff goes on nice and smooth and doesn&#x27;t feel wet, sticky or slimy. It really controls odor and smells nice without clashing with body chemistry or perfume. It&#x27;s actually so strong that I shower before bed and don&#x27;t have to apply any deodorant and still smell fresh in the morning. (And I sweat at night)</li>
    <li> I normally use the Powder Fresh Gel formulation, but I grabbed the wrong thing. As it turned out this was the very thing I wanted and does a great job keeping me fresh and decidedly non-offensive even in the funkiest of situations like 98% humidity during the dog days of summer.&lt;br /&gt;As a long time Mitchums user, this is a very pleasant scent. It goes on a little wet, dries quickly, leaves none of those white streaks on clothing, and keeps me both dry and fresh smelling.&lt;br /&gt;Lovely anti-perspirant that works from shower to shower on a daily basis, you&#x27;ll never be insecure again.</li>
    <li> this is by far the best deodorant I have ever used and this scent in solid is hard to find that&#x27;s why I ordered it online.</li>
    <li> The amount of Aluminum Zirconium Tetrachlorohydrex Gly (the active ingredient) in this is 20%, which is the equivalent to clinical strength deodorants/ antiperspirants. All of the other ones I&#x27;ve seen contain 15-18%.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like to use clinical strength deodorant (Degree) to ensure that I smell fresh ALL day, but I feel self conscious about carrying one in my bag. (As a female, I wouldn&#x27;t want people to get the impression that I am abnormally sweaty or smelly!)&lt;br /&gt;This one doesn&#x27;t say &amp;#34;clinical strength&amp;#34; on the front, so I can bring this with me wherever I go and not worry about people seeing it!</li>
    <li> Keeps me dry &amp; smelling wonderful.  Had to switch after Secret mysteriously stopped working.</li>
    <li> This wasn&#x27;t the gel its a solid and it doesn&#x27;t seem to work as good as the gel.</li>
    <li> I struggled finding a deodorant that &amp;#34;works&amp;#34; for me - even clinical versions come up short.  This is perfect! It will last a full day, even well into the next day with no issues.  Smells good, no problems with it staining clothing.</li>
    <li> Now it is called Oxygen Advanced Control. It doesn&#x27;t work as well as the original. To sad that they have change it. Now to find another one. Buhuhuhuhu</li>
    <li> I used the &amp;#34;old&amp;#34; Mithchem Power Gel with the Pink Odor Eliminator sticker and it worked like no other. I&#x27;m 36 and my body has been going through a few changes. I get hot and sweaty at the drop of a dime and have trouble cooling myself down once I get overheated. My old deodorants stopped working and began clogging my pores (Secret/Dove/Degree/Suave). Mitchem worked like a charm for years...that is until they switched to a new and &amp;#34;(un)improved&amp;#34; Oxygenated formula! It sucks, it smells like rubbing alcohol, it&#x27;s wet and runny, and worse off it does not work. I took a shower today, applied it, went outside to talk on the phone for 10 minutes (87 degrees). I came back in the house and my son said I smelled like outside. He thought it was him at first, but was glad it wasn&#x27;t...and that my pit odor lingered in the kithen. Now surely, that sounds like enough funk to bat an eye out, but nevertheless, the old Mitchem took care of the problem and this new one doesn&#x27;t. I had to run out and by some Ban. Change it back to the old stuff!</li>
    <li> This invisible solid Mitchum, has become my favorite because it does the job.  Have finally found a product that lives up to it&#x27;s claims.  If you&#x27;re tired of buying expensive deoderants and having them work only until you step out the door, this may be your answer!</li>
    <li> I prefer Mitchum for Women because it controls odor and perspiration better than most I have tried in the past. Moreover, even though this is a compressed powder, I don&#x27;t get the powdery residue that I&#x27;ve gotten with others of this type. And with the Subscribe and Save, I get it for a decent price.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I wanted.</li>
    <li> Works better than any other deodorant, in my opinion. Equally strong to a clinical brand at a fraction of the cost.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the best deodorant I have ever used. It protects me all day long</li>
    <li> This is my favorite deodorant!  It keeps me dry and smelling great even in my high stress job.  I am nurse and always on the go for my 12 hour shift.  I am frequently sweating from isolation gowns but this deodorant keeps me smelling good.  I have tried several and this one makes the cut in my book!  I purchase this monthly from subscribe and save.  I recommend this to anyone who needs to stay dry and smell great during the day!</li>
