### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>No breakouts and feels great!</li>
      <li>This was a very good product and i consider it was on a very good price.&lt;br /&gt;Great brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Good luck!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a very good sunblock and has a good smeel too.</li>
      <li>I bought it for my giirlfriend and she is happy with it.</li>
      <li>, it&#x27;s great.</li>
      <li>However, I recommend giving a try to see if your skin will be happy with it.</li>
      <li>But over all I feel it is a good investment.</li>
      <li>good grief...you talk about sun exposure.  </li>
      <li>We also have relatively fair skin.</li>
      <li>The price is good.</li>
      <li>I really love this product!</li>
      <li>it smells great, doesn&#x27;t feel gross on my skin, and it works wonderfully.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m giving it two stars instead of one because it is effective and it doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin.  </li>
      <li>My skin breaks out very easy</li>
      <li>But it is not a product most people will want to apply to their face.  </li>
      <li>There are so many better choices that I wouldn&#x27;t recommend anyone bother with this one.  </li>
      <li>I cannot express how much I love Aveeno&#x27;s sunscreen for the face -</li>
      <li>So interesting how the reviews of this product vary.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s also best applied when the skin is dry.</li>
      <li>Non greasy..makeup goes on right over perfectly and feel totally protected from the sun.</li>
      <li>I found it to be true when more cream is applied to one spot</li>
      <li>but with this product it is fine,</li>
      <li>I am a huge Aveeno fan.</li>
      <li>Some people with sensitive skin need to think about it before buying this kind of product on the web, but for a &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; skin person it workd.</li>
      <li>I go the sun screen, thinking if it is for the face, it must be more gentle than for the body.  </li>
      <li>Look from a redhead who&#x27;s worn high SPF&#x27;s most of her life...</li>
      <li>the best suggestion I can give is to use the spray on kinds the higher the SPF because the lotions are just going to be heavily viscous and never rub in very well.</li>
      <li>The cream prevent any oily condensation from forming on my face while keeping it fresh through out the day.</li>
      <li>especially when it comes to any kind of moisturizer.</li>
      <li>My husband has a problem blending it in when he applies it right after or while he&#x27;s sweating--but not any more so than with most other sunscreens.</li>
      <li>and she was right</li>
      <li>I also have somewhat dry skin, that is pretty sensitive, and this product worked great for me.</li>
      <li>This is a much higher SPF than most, so it will obviously be different than a lower SPF product, but I haven&#x27;t had any problems with it.</li>
      <li>No sunscreen has ever seemed to be strong enough for me, especially on my face, primarily my cheeks and the bridge of my nose.</li>
      <li>Even though this is an oil free product, it initially feels just a tad greasy on, and provides the moisture that my son needs.</li>
      <li>Although I use a lighter SPF lotion on a daily basis, I primarily use/trust this Aveeno product on days that we go to water parks, beaches, etc.</li>
      <li>Thanks</li>
      <li>It sits on top of the skin in white splotches that become white streaks when I move or perspire.  </li>
      <li>I have very sensitive sking</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s worth every single penny you will spend.</li>
      <li>Clearly other folks have not been so lucky.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a young Caucasian female who has struggled with sunburn her whole life.</li>
      <li>If you have sensitive skin, don&#x27;t use this product.  </li>
      <li>I love this sunscreen and put it on everyday with it doing double duty of moisturizer and sunblock.</li>
      <li>the product came with half full and also has a mark on the bottle which looks like someone took off the price tag.</li>
      <li>I had switched to another product because the Aveeno in this high of an SPF doesn&#x27;t rub in well, especially if you&#x27;re a man and have any stubble.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>(I&#x27;m thrifty, or cheap, and usually use up products regardless--not with this one.)  </li>
      <li>But if this isn&#x27;t your only option, steer clear.</li>
      <li>I tried it on my arm, and developed red bumps.  </li>

<li> She said, it helped clear all the dark spots she got from her country.</li>
<li> I hadn&#x27;t used anything else in the same areas, other than the same soap I&#x27;ve used for years.  </li>
<li> And, as some other reviews have stated, it does leave somewhat noticeable white flakes on your skin.&lt;br</li>
<li> It spreads and blends in way easier on my son&#x27;s face than some of the other baby sunscreen brands such as neutrogena.</li>
<li> Read some of the reviews regarding white streaks on the face due to applying this cream.</li>

<li> I&#x27;ve used this product for a little over a year on my entire family, including my toddler son.</li>
<li> I tossed it out before the tube was empty.  </li>
<li> but I can&#x27;t recommend it due to the after-effects of application.</li>
<li> past weekend, I used some prior to swimming in a hotel pool.  </li>
<li> Either way, I&#x27;m not willing to risk</li>
<li> It&#x27;s a smeary, greasy, chalky-looking mess that can not be made to blend into skin without rubbing off the product.  </li>
<li> I was a little worried about the fragrance, but it didn&#x27;t irritate my skin.</li>
<li> And a little bit greasy.  </li>
<li> but when it is applied little by little in layers the face does not have any marks.</li>
<li> My husband uses it everyday.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m 3o years old and this product gave me acne worse than when I was a teenager!</li>
<li> Have used this for  3 years year round under my makeup but over my moisturizer.</li>
<li> I have combination skin, and this dried out my face like nothing I&#x27;ve ever used before has.</li>
<li> no more breakouts.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;ve used it on my face a couple times, without any negative effect.  </li>
<li> Lately, I have also been using the spray on my boy&#x27;s body because he thinks it&#x27;s cool--making it easier to apply.</li>
<li> /&gt;Basically, my review is this: If you&#x27;re desperate and can&#x27;t find anything that works, definitely try it.</li>
<li> NOT a good product.</li>
<li> It makes you look awful and feel slimy, especially if you&#x27;re doing anything active ....</li>
<li> It&#x27;s made me reluctant to try other Aveeno skin products, it&#x27;s that unpleasant.</li>
<li> Unfortunately, the spray does irritate my face a bit (I have no idea why), so I try not to use the spray version on any faces.</li>
<li> For me, though, it did cause several nasty side effects.</li>
<li> My kids refuse to use this product because it leaves disgusting greasy white flakes and balls of lotion, no matter</li>
<li> As a body sunblock, it&#x27;s expensive.  </li>
<li> so if you&#x27;re desperate, give it a try.</li>
<li> And it smells bad.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> My dermatologist recommended I try Aveeno Sunblock lotion and she was right, it&#x27;s great. No sunburn, it&#x27;s not greasy and even the spray is unobtrusive.</li>
    <li> I have used this cream for quite some time. The cream prevent any oily condensation from forming on my face while keeping it fresh through out the day. Read some of the reviews regarding white streaks on the face due to applying this cream. I found it to be true when more cream is applied to one spot but when it is applied little by little in layers the face does not have any marks. The cream does occasionally sting at places. But over all I feel it is a good investment.</li>
    <li> Look from a redhead who&#x27;s worn high SPF&#x27;s most of her life...the best suggestion I can give is to use the spray on kinds the higher the SPF because the lotions are just going to be heavily viscous and never rub in very well.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for a little over a year on my entire family, including my toddler son. It spreads and blends in way easier on my son&#x27;s face than some of the other baby sunscreen brands such as neutrogena. My son had a big problem with eczema, and this product was the only thing that didn&#x27;t exacerbate it. Even though this is an oil free product, it initially feels just a tad greasy on, and provides the moisture that my son needs. I also have somewhat dry skin, that is pretty sensitive, and this product worked great for me. I was a little worried about the fragrance, but it didn&#x27;t irritate my skin. This is a much higher SPF than most, so it will obviously be different than a lower SPF product, but I haven&#x27;t had any problems with it. We also have relatively fair skin. It&#x27;s also best applied when the skin is dry. My husband has a problem blending it in when he applies it right after or while he&#x27;s sweating--but not any more so than with most other sunscreens. Ditto for when he re-applies it immediately after coming out of the water. Although I use a lighter SPF lotion on a daily basis, I primarily use/trust this Aveeno product on days that we go to water parks, beaches, etc. Lately, I have also been using the spray on my boy&#x27;s body because he thinks it&#x27;s cool--making it easier to apply. Unfortunately, the spray does irritate my face a bit (I have no idea why), so I try not to use the spray version on any faces.</li>
    <li> the product came with half full and also has a mark on the bottle which looks like someone took off the price tag. I checked inside the bottle look like the bottle been used because there is spill around the cap a bit</li>
    <li> Aqui em casa todos gostamos muito de usar Aveeno. Além de ficarmos protegidos dos raios solares, ele também hidrata e nutri a nossa pele. Nosso agradecimento a Johson &amp; Johnson. Thanks</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t see the different.  I sill get tan even used this sun block.  And a little bit greasy.  I</li>
    <li> My skin breaks out very easy but with this product it is fine, no more breakouts.  I will be buying again.</li>
    <li> My kids refuse to use this product because it leaves disgusting greasy white flakes and balls of lotion, no matter how well you rub it in. It&#x27;s like you&#x27;re sweating sunscreen. It makes you look awful and feel slimy, especially if you&#x27;re doing anything active .... It protects against sunburn but I can&#x27;t recommend it due to the after-effects of application. NOT a good product.</li>
    <li> I bought it for my giirlfriend and she is happy with it. Some people with sensitive skin need to think about it before buying this kind of product on the web, but for a &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; skin person it workd. The price is good.</li>
    <li> I cannot express how much I love Aveeno&#x27;s sunscreen for the face - it smells great, doesn&#x27;t feel gross on my skin, and it works wonderfully.  I&#x27;m in the sun alot, and skin protection is very high on my list (wear sunscreen everyday!).  We have a trip to Aruba coming up, and good grief...you talk about sun exposure.  At the equator.  At the Spring Equinox.  I have been searching...searching...searching..every CVS, rite aid, target, walgreens ...everywhere - the body sunscreen is all over, but Aveeno&#x27;s sunscreen for the face has disappeared.  Leave it to trusty ol&#x27; Amazon to have ONE bottle in stock!  I was ecstatic.  If you come across this, and you&#x27;re in the sun alot, buy it.  It&#x27;s worth every single penny you will spend.</li>
    <li> I really love this product! I lather it on my face when I go walking during the day.  I am a bus driver and the sun hits my face constantly so I need the protection.  My girlfriend uses it daily on her face.  She likes how it is not greasy under her makeup. I definitely would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a young Caucasian female who has struggled with sunburn her whole life. No sunscreen has ever seemed to be strong enough for me, especially on my face, primarily my cheeks and the bridge of my nose. I tried this sunscreen when on vacation in Southern California. It did stop me from getting sunburned at all--so if you&#x27;re desperate, give it a try. For me, though, it did cause several nasty side effects. I have combination skin, and this dried out my face like nothing I&#x27;ve ever used before has. I had scaly patches on my cheeks after using it for ten days straight, which did go away after a few days not using the product. It burned putting it on and washing it off, which I presume is also a side effect of the dryness it caused. And, as some other reviews have stated, it does leave somewhat noticeable white flakes on your skin.&lt;br /&gt;Basically, my review is this: If you&#x27;re desperate and can&#x27;t find anything that works, definitely try it. It might not affect your skin like it did mine. But if this isn&#x27;t your only option, steer clear.</li>
    <li> So interesting how the reviews of this product vary. I think it just shows how people&#x27;s skins have different sensitivities. I have very sensitive sking especially when it comes to any kind of moisturizer. I have never in my life found one that doesn&#x27;t make me breakout. The ONLY thing that gives me moisture for my face and doesn&#x27;t give me acne is this sunscreen. I am here on Amazon replacing a tube because I have run through it. I love this sunscreen and put it on everyday with it doing double duty of moisturizer and sunblock. I am 60 years old so not sure if this would work for an acne prone teenager but I have found it has works wonders for me. Clearly other folks have not been so lucky. However, I recommend giving a try to see if your skin will be happy with it. I am a huge Aveeno fan. Good luck!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had a tube of this stuff for a while.  I&#x27;ve used it on my face a couple times, without any negative effect.  I had switched to another product because the Aveeno in this high of an SPF doesn&#x27;t rub in well, especially if you&#x27;re a man and have any stubble.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This past weekend, I used some prior to swimming in a hotel pool.  I applied it to my face, neck, shoulders and ears. The next morning, I had bumps all over my neck, ears, shoulders and edges of my face.  I&#x27;ve never had a reaction like this to any sunscreen.  I hadn&#x27;t used anything else in the same areas, other than the same soap I&#x27;ve used for years.  The rash must have been caused by the Aveeno.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t recall if I&#x27;ve ever used this sunscreen while in a pool.  I&#x27;m wondering if it was a simple allergic reaction to the Aveeno or if being in chlorinated (or whatever chemical the hotel uses in it&#x27;s pool) water reacted with the sunscreen.  Either way, I&#x27;m not willing to risk it happening again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll stick with Bullfrog or Neutrogena.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 3o years old and this product gave me acne worse than when I was a teenager! Now I have acne and wrinkles.</li>
    <li> I go the sun screen, thinking if it is for the face, it must be more gentle than for the body.  I tried it on my arm, and developed red bumps.  If you have sensitive skin, don&#x27;t use this product.  Get a mineral based sun screen.</li>
    <li> My husband uses it everyday.</li>
    <li> This product was recommended by a friend. She said, it helped clear all the dark spots she got from her country. She said, she uses it all yr through.  Now i am using it and i don&#x27;t regret my purchase and decision to give it a try. Wished if i could have get it from the local pharmacies when i can&#x27;t get it online through Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product!</li>
    <li> Have used this for  3 years year round under my makeup but over my moisturizer. No breakouts and feels great! Non greasy..makeup goes on right over perfectly and feel totally protected from the sun.</li>
    <li> This was a very good product and i consider it was on a very good price.&lt;br /&gt;Great brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My aunt loves it and uses it all the time.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m giving it two stars instead of one because it is effective and it doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin.  But it is not a product most people will want to apply to their face.  It&#x27;s a smeary, greasy, chalky-looking mess that can not be made to blend into skin without rubbing off the product.  It sits on top of the skin in white splotches that become white streaks when I move or perspire.  And it smells bad.  I used it only on my neck and arms, and even then cleaned the goop off my skin when returning from outdoor activity.  I tossed it out before the tube was empty.  (I&#x27;m thrifty, or cheap, and usually use up products regardless--not with this one.)  As a body sunblock, it&#x27;s expensive.  There are so many better choices that I wouldn&#x27;t recommend anyone bother with this one.  It&#x27;s made me reluctant to try other Aveeno skin products, it&#x27;s that unpleasant.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a very good sunblock and has a good smeel too. I recomend for everybody who wants a sunblock for everyday.</li>
