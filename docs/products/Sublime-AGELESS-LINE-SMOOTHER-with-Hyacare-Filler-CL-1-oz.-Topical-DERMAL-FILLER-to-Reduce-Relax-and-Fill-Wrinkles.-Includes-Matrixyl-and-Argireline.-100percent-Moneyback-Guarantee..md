<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This is an amazing skin care product that does exactly what it&#x27;s made to do. I did noticed that around my eyes looked smoother and where I was starting to get fine lines/crows feet were gone. Also this lotion is very gentle and light on skin and didn&#x27;t bother my sensitive skin what&#x27;s so ever.</li>
    <li> I really like the way this makes my skin feel. I have been using a few weeks and I see a difference already.</li>
    <li> Really like the way it makes my skin feel.  Very soft and smooth.  I would buy it again.</li>
    <li> This product is great, it sinks in completely, and leaves my skin looking and feeling smooth and moisturized. It has a slight citrusy smell which I like. I would recommend this to anyone who needs help with fine lines and wrinkles, or even younger women and men who would like to start a ageless regime earlier in life.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a few weeks now. I have been applying this in the morning before my makeup and at night. I like the lightweight feeling of this. I did not notice a difference in my fine lines though does not seem smoother. I have medium brown skin tone. My skin in pretty dry also.</li>
    <li> This does firm the skin you feel it working but not long enough time to know if lines are being reduced</li>
    <li> Amazing product. In just 3 days I could absolutely see the improvement in my skin texture &amp; fine lines, especially on my forehead. I am addicted!!! I can&#x27;t wait to see what happens on day 30!</li>
    <li> I have nothing but praises for this product. I usually apply it daily after my evening bath and it feels sooo good on my skin. I&#x27;ve also been getting complements that I&#x27;ve been glowing, so maybe it does work! But I really haven&#x27;t had a skin care routine before this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m extremely satisfied with this product and would repurchase in a heartbeat.</li>
    <li> First off I love the way the product arrives. It came in the cute organza bag. Ok now onto the product review! I&#x27;ve got a few smile lines and a couple horizontal lines on my forehead. So after using the line smoother for a few days I am already noting that day by day it seems to me that they are dissapearing. I am very happy that I took a chance and tried this smoother!!</li>
    <li> I am super fussy about the skin products I use.  I always like to look nice and take good care of my skin.  So, in lieu of getting fillers, which are nice, this is the next best thing.  Fillers are expensive to maintain.  This is temporary but that&#x27;s fine with me.  One reviewer wrote that it doesn&#x27;t work well with liquid makeup.  I do not have that issue at all.  I use oil free makeup and no problem whatsoever.  I absolutely love this product.</li>
    <li> WOW!  I was skeptical about how effective this product would be, but I am now a believer! I had two weeks before my wedding to work on some stubborn lines around my eyes and on my forehead.  This product worked so well, people actually asked me what I had &amp;#34;done&amp;#34; to my face. You cannot go wrong with this line smoother.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money. I used it faithfully and didn&#x27;t see any dramatic or even minor results ! For some reason I always believe that if it&#x27;s expensive it must be wonderful...,NOT !!  A piece of advice. Recently I read about using liquid collagen for your skin, joint aches etc.. My Husband and I have already seen tremendous results after only 10 days. My skin, not just my face, feels so moisturizer . And I have really dry skin. My Husband says his joint pain has gotten better. Don&#x27;t just take my word, research its benefits ! Also, don&#x27;t spend a fortune for it. I bought it from Puritan for $13.97 and I&#x27;m sure this bottle will last a month or more for both of us. You just take 2 Tbspoons mixed with water once a day. The taste is horrifying but I just hold my nose, gulp it down, and drink something else right away. I&#x27;m amazed at the results !!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in my late 40&#x27;s and really noticing signs of aging lately.  I&#x27;ve tried lots of products that promise so much and deliver so little, but I do think that I am seeing a difference in my skin with this product! I don&#x27;t always use it twice a day - more likely just once, but right away felt like it was actually making a difference in softening my smile lines.  It feels nice on the skin and has a light scent.  I hate when facial products have a heavy fragrance, so this is a plus for me.  It doesn&#x27;t leave you greasy or sticky and you can layer it with your other products and makeup without any problem.  I would recommend this to women who are seeing the signs of aging and want to do something to slow it down or possibly reverse it. I also love the fact that I got follow up emails from the seller informing me of how to use the product and inviting me to contact them if I had any questions.  Great customer service on top of a good product.  Well done.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a few weeks and I love the results. Fine lines are filling in and it is light with no caking effect. I will buy this product again.</li>
    <li> I have had some recent health issues and as a result my skin has suffered. I have been using Ageless Line Smoother with HyaCareÂ® Filler along with their Face WhispererÂ® Advanced Eye Gel , and i can not say enough about this product. The minute you open the box, you find this black see through mesh bag, with the bottle inside, from moment one, you feel special, pampered. I am so happy i was offered this line of products during a promotion to give my honest opinion. The product works magic on your skin, faster than any product i have ever seen. All in one week, I cant wait to see what happens in a month, or even a year from now.</li>
    <li> very nice product. effects seen after a few days.</li>
    <li> I have been living in Hawaii for  about 30 years and the sun damage is starting to show itself. I have noticed wrinkles on my upper chest and it has started to bother me. I&#x27;m feeling older than I am. So when I was offered this New Ageless Line Smoother with Hyacare Filler CL for a great deal to try and share my honest opinion about it, I ordered immediately. As soon as  it arrived, I began using it on my chest. In a little over a week, I&#x27;ve noticed that my chest wrinkles are not as defined! Sublime Beauty has a great product here and I definitely recommend this Ageless Line Smoother for anyone who wants to look and feel younger!</li>
    <li> Wow just wow...love it. I use this night and day and my face looks so much better.  More radiate.  Less darkness on my age spots. I will let you know if they disappear.  Love the scent and it feels so good going on. Absorbs fast too.</li>
    <li> I have waited til into the second bottle to review, I do believe I am seeing some results to the fine lines at the corners of my mouth, and I also have been applying on one cheek that has a couple tiny wrinkles, I am going to give it one more bottle and decide if worth continuing for the price, I do love the non greasy feeling of this product.</li>
    <li> For the price I haven&#x27;t really seen a difference.  It&#x27;s been about a month using it and it&#x27;s almost gone.  I would have thought using the amount I do it would have lasted a bit longer.  Will not reorder.</li>
    <li> Great product. Amazing customer service.</li>
    <li> This is wonderful! This ageless line smoother goes on very smoothly. A nice light scent that is not over powering in any way. I have noticed that my fine lines and wrinkles around my eyes and forehead look so much nicer. I am very impressed with this product! I was able to put this on and then apply my regular make up over top of it. I had a chance to purchase this at a discounted rate for my honest review and I can honestly say I am very impressed. I am so impressed that I purchased a second one for my mother-in-law. I highly recommend this to others that are looking for someone looking to get rid of those pesky fine lines and wrinkles like I was.</li>
    <li> Silky application and made my regular moisturizer go one easier.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great i love it.</li>
    <li> After using Ageless Line Smoother with Hyacare Filler for the past month, I can say how much I love this product. When I put it in my hand and looked at this clear liquid, I had no idea that within minutes of it drying into my skin, what wonderful and quick results were seen. My small lines are quickly diminishing and I will definitely buy this product again.  Thank you Sublime Beauty for such a wonderful product.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used this long enough to comment on, but at this point, I wouldn&#x27;t say that I would buy it again.  For one thing, it is expensive, and I was disappointed because I expected more right from the start.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love these particular products so when I came across this one, I just had to try it!! This one is an ageless line smoother with HyaCare filler. The HyaCare uses a unique blend of cross-linked polysaccharides, hyaluronic acid and an absorbing emulsion. Basically, the way they make this filler, it &#x27;fills in&#x27; the facial areas where your wrinkles begin smoothing them out and, over roughly 2 weeks time (at least that is how long I have been using it), it diminishes your appearance of lines and wrinkles while moisturizing your skin. It also increases the elasticity and plumpness of your skin without the oily residue I have come to notice with some other products. (I am fairly certain that is where the Hyaluronic Acid comes into effect...the moisturizing without making your skin oily that is.) The other two main ingredients it listed were Matrixyl (a peptide that helps boost your collagen levels) and Argireline (a formulation that relaxes the wrinkles like that of Botox...without the pain). My wrinkles and lines around my eyes and mouth have not disappeared (as they never do) but they have greatly diminished in the short time I have been using this. I definitely could not be happier and do highly recommend you trying this one!! (I was provided a sample of this product through a promotion in exchange for an honest, unbiased review.  The information provided is solely my opinion and based on my personal experience.)</li>
    <li> I am skeptical about buying products like this but I used it once and have already noticed a difference in the fine lines in my forehead. I&#x27;m going to continue to use it twice a day as it says and then will make another review later because I just got it in the mail.</li>
    <li> Saw immediate results.Very nice.</li>
    <li> I have always taken care of my skin but grew up in Florida back in the days where we didn&#x27;t even have sunscreen!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m turning 60 next month but my skin is unaware of the age it is :)  I have tried many different products on my skin from high end to natural products and all in between.&lt;br /&gt;I have never experiences such a difference in using a product.  I thought my skin looked pretty good but these products have taken it to a whole new level of great! My skin feels smoother, tighter and even glowing! My adult children even commented on my skin when they were home for the holiday. My daughter that is 32 and I were out shopping and we were asked if we were sisters lol I loved it! Her, not so much :) she will surely be buying some of these great products. Never too soon to start with great skincare and these products are above and beyond ......the owner is very easy to work with and even sent me some samples to try and was very accommodating  when I had a question on when to use a product with another. Great customer service. You can&#x27;t go wrong with these products! New Year- New you:) j</li>
    <li> These products are amazing!</li>
    <li> I was looking for a product like this. It is a Very good product! Would highly recommend this to anyone looking for something that does what it says and more. And a great price.</li>
    <li> It was a good product.  Still love my normal product. But still good!</li>
    <li> this product is so smooth and feels like silk. I love that it makes my face feel wonderful.</li>
    <li> This really works.  I am in my late 40&#x27;s and started to have fine lines on my forehead.  Within a couple of weeks, they started to disappear - now after three weeks - they are all but gone!  I used this product along with their day and night creams.</li>
    <li> i have only been using ageless serum for a few weeks and i like how easy it is to apply.  i use it with the day and night creams which i also like because of how smooth they sink in and leave my skin looking and feeling good. i am 63 so have deeper lines but i do feel these creams are helping me and i will continue to use them. I have tried lots of creams and really do like all of the sublime beauty products i have tried.</li>
    <li> This looking to be an excellent product.  I haven&#x27;t been using it long enough to see full benefits, so far I love it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this for a few weeks (in combination with their &#x27;Ageless Serum&#x27;) and there is no question that my face and neck already look like they are aging in reverse.  My skin is getting more firm and the fine lines are filling in.  I am very pleased with the results so far and will continue to use these products.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about a month and see a huge difference. My skin feels hydrated and looks firmer, smoother and more youthful. I love the way the cream feels; it is not heavy or greasy.</li>
    <li> I am constantly searching for anti-aging product for my grandmother, I know she will be super happy to receive this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It even came in this pretty black gift bag ready to be send as a gift!!!</li>
    <li> I love Sublime Beauty&#x27;s Ageless serums.  I have definitely seen good results.  Lines are softer with Ageless Line Smoother.  I will definitely continue buying their products.</li>
    <li> Leaves skin feeling soft and smooth. Some small improvement noticed. But have not used long enough to really give it a good test.</li>
    <li> Talk about your skin feeling silky! I&#x27;ve just started to use Ageless Line Smoother and will give a progress report but the lines already look less intense!</li>
    <li> I liked it, it is worth what you pay. I have oily skin, the feeling is on my skin is very nice. Recommended.</li>
    <li> This new product from Sublime Beauty is the best!  I use it every morning before moisturizing and putting on my makeup.  It is a thin white liquid with a fresh, slightly lemon smell.  It makes my skin feel soft and doesn&#x27;t irritate.  I use it on my face and neck.  It contains hyaluronic acid which helps skin maintain moisture.  It also has  wrinkle relaxing and collogen boosting ingredients.  I am in my late 30&#x27;s and have definitely seen a difference in how my skin looks since using this product.  I use it in conjunction with other Sublime Beauty serums.  I am thankful I was able to receive this product in exchange for an honest review.</li>
    <li> so glad i bought this line smoother!</li>
    <li> I just started using this as a supplement to the routine I have. I use it under my eyes , the sides of my  mouth and forehead. The skin feels better, more supple and the lines are a tad fainter. Happy with this product</li>
    <li> I did not notice any fantastic improvement, but this is a nice product, and I would probably purchase again.</li>
    <li> Did not do exactly what I thought it would, but it is better than a lot of products I&#x27;ve tried.  For the price, I think it did about as could be expected.</li>
    <li> 2nd time to order this!  I really do like the entire line of products from Sublime Beauty :) I&#x27;ve tried quite a few of them, and this one that I wanted more of!  Like anything worth having, you must have patience, grasshopper.  Doesn&#x27;t work overnight BUT stay with it and you will be pleased with the long term effects!</li>
    <li> It feels nice and absorbs well, but I don&#x27;t really notice any difference as far as the fine lines around my eyes.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used it once so far but I&#x27;m in love...my skin is so soft &amp; it smells wonderful... I love the packaging &amp; the little black bag is perfect for my nighly face products... I&#x27;m gonna order this line of products for 1 of my Momma&#x27;s Christmas gifts I know she will love it too...Seller was wonderful and I had no issues with the transaction... Excited to try more products... Try it you will love it...thanks Sublime Beauty...!!!</li>
    <li> does absolutely nothing</li>
    <li> This stuff really works, I love it! I have tried several different kinds and I love the light feel you get from this. And it smells amazing!!</li>
    <li> I have been using this for almost two weeks now.  I have actually seen the lines by my eye disappear.  I use this with the ageless serum and can&#x27;t decide which is best.  I will have to choose as I can&#x27;t afford to keep buying both.  Wonderful products.</li>
    <li> Did not notice any difference after 1 month of use.  Was disappointed but figured as much. Was referred by a friend who heard about it from Plastic Surgeons office. Maybe I didn&#x27;t stick with it long enough but my olay Regenerist at least feels moisturizing.</li>
    <li> I love Sublime products.  So when I was given the opportunity to try this product and give my honest and unbiased opinion I jumped at the chance.  This is the 3rd product of theirs I have tried and I have to be honest and say that I am already hooked!  I have seen more results with their products than with anything else I&#x27;ve ever used.  I am in my mid 40&#x27;s (ok, so I&#x27;m 44) and I&#x27;m addicted to skin care products.  I don&#x27;t ACT my age so I figure why should I look my age, right?  I have been using this in combination with their new Glycolic and Salicylic serum and their Face Whisperer Neck &amp; Decollete Cream.  (Hopefully if I keep using their products I will end up looking like one of their models.  The Sublime models are gorgeous lol!)  ANYWAY...this product is wonderful.  I have already seen a difference in the smile/laugh lines around my mouth and in the line between my eyes.  My face seems to look more relaxed (ever heard of R.B.F.?--lol!) and my skin seems smoother than it has in a long time.  I will continue to use this product as well as the others and continue to HIGHLY recommend Sublime to everyone!</li>
    <li> I received the product for free as a promotional thing and I had to be quick !lol I wasnt really expecting anything great . To the contrary of what I expected it is a great product ! It smells kind of like oranges. I like it, its very faint but smells good . I&#x27;m young so I don&#x27;t have wrinkles but I do have expression lines and after a few uses I actually see a difference ! Its making them fade away I was surprised and happy! Although I received the product free I will be buying this again I really love it :)</li>
    <li> I have been using the ageless line smoother filler for about 3 weeks. I like the texture and the light, refreshing smell. The filler literally glides on my skin when applied. The filler has an immediate effects smoothing the fine lines, when left to dry on your skin, and after the second week of usage I,ve noticed more permanent result when it comes to fine lines reduction. My skin overall appearance have greatly improved. My skin looks great, smoother and more radiant, and I,m very happy with the result. Great product. I will recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> I bought this to match the moisturizer by this company. The two work extremely well together and my skin felt instantly firm and very glowing.</li>
    <li> Did nothing to improve my skin or make it more soft and fuller.  I was very disappointed and felt it was a great waste of money.</li>
    <li> My skin is feeling great after using the Line Smoother and I can see less in the lines and wrinkles on my face.</li>
    <li> When one approaches the end of one&#x27;s eighth decade, it is difficult to evaluate the change in one&#x27;s skin appearance and condition.  However, I believe I can honestly evaluate Ageless Line Smoother with HyaCare Filler as being a superior skin care product.  First, the serum applies easily and smoothly.  Secondly, the serum leaves neither a greasy nor sticky film; rather, the skin absorbs it thoroughly.  Next, after application, the skin feels nicely toned, smooth and soft, and has a delightfully refined light fragrance.  Finally, as to whether or not the lines at the eyes, at the upper lip and elsewhere are less noticeable, it&#x27;s hard for me to judge by looking in the mirror.  Those who live with me - and I asked them to be observant - tell me they see a difference.  The bottom line:  now that I have used Ageless Line Smoother with Hyacare for several weeks I will continue with the regimen for three reasons: the application feels good; my facial skin is softer; and others offer compliments of the skin texture.  I have been pampering and protecting my facial skin with quality products since I entered my teens; why stop now?</li>
    <li> Really do like this product and the way it goes on.  Great packaging</li>
    <li> Of all the Sublime Beauty products that I use the Ageless Line Smoother is my favorite. After using the product for 3 weeks all of the deep lines in my forehead are gone. It&#x27;s also very good for around the eyes. Love It!</li>
    <li> This package of item is so luxurious. It&#x27;s a very good choice to be a gift . After 2 weeks use on my face, my face became brighter . The cream is moisture makes my face can keep soft after use. It works well to me, I will keep use!</li>
    <li> Just start using and feel good about it. I used together with all Ageless products. They seem work together well.</li>
    <li> This did nothing for my lines!!!</li>
    <li> I have the full line of Ageless Beauty by Sublime.  I will be a long time customer because I am sold.  One afternoon I made an appointment to see my hair stylist.  With my hair in the wash bowel and my face straight up looking at the ceiling, my hair stylist told me that I looked more beautiful then ever.  I say, we&#x27;ll thanks! I knew why she said it and I also felt it myself.  I do feel beautiful.  My skin is glowing and looking radiant!  I can hardly believe my eyes.  I just want you to try this product. Buy all three ageless together.  You will not regret this at all.   I am not one to fuss over myself at all.  Just quick out the door kind of gal.  My skin is my make up really.  This serum leaves my skin looking fresh.  My wrinkles around my mouth have soften and so noticeably smoother, I suspect with more time I will even see a bigger difference.  I am so happy to have found this entire product line.  Thank you Sublime. Sherri</li>
    <li> Every once in a while you open a package, and you want to stop right there and just stare.  Just the wrapping alone of a product can take your breath away.  That is how I felt when I opened the shipping box of this line smoother.  I felt....spoiled.  The way this product was wrapped in a soft see-through pouch alone made me want to try it out.  Any company that puts that much thought in the wrapping is likely going to put a lot of thought into the product as well.  And as expected I was not disappointed.  This product has done an amazing job on reducing some of the lines around my eyes.  I have to admit I can never stop at just putting it around my eyes, as the filler feels amazing all over my face.  I am so glad I was able to purchase this at a discount for me to review.  It has become one of my very favorite products.  :&amp;#62;))&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*product received free or at a discount in exchange for my review</li>
    <li> I can not get enough of these great products!!!  These are my words written honestly, review of product.  This feels so nice as you are applying it, then when it dries your face feels so darn smooth.  I feel like this product is really diminishing my fine lines.  Great Company, Sublime Beauty is made in USA.  Highly Recommend and will purchase again in future for self and gifts!  Thanks Sublime Beauty</li>
    <li> I followed the instructions perfectly. This product didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
    <li> Love it!!! Couldn&#x27;t be happier!</li>
