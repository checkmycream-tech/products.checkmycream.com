### Positive Reviews

      <li>Maybe this works best for crowns but</li>
      <li>This product is the best!</li>
      <li>wonderful product.</li>
      <li>It is the best way to shop from home.</li>
      <li>I am not affiliated with this company, but I was so impressed I decided to write a review.  </li>
      <li>Happy Camper endorses this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>A great value.  </li>
      <li>Keep up the good work.</li>
      <li>It does what it says it does..very pleased with it!</li>
      <li>Fast shipping, good price!</li>
      <li>So I tried Miracle Hair and really love it.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad there&#x27;s no surgical procedure I had to go through for the thinness of my hair area.</li>
      <li>I love Amazon Prime.  </li>
      <li>This is the only product of its kind that matched and blended perfectly with my own natural hair and it is virtually undetectable even on close inspection.  </li>
      <li>It did what it said it would do and filled in those gaps that were so embarrassing.  </li>
      <li>so I wouldn&#x27;t have to mix brown and light brown.</li>
      <li>And the 2 day Free shipping has been great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This really works!!!.  </li>
      <li>Great product, it is the same good product my mom was looking for since long ago.</li>
      <li>qiuck refund and quick delivery product does what it&#x27;s suppose to do</li>
      <li>As a woman I have had a hair loss problem for most of my adult life.  </li>
      <li>and already I know it is right for me.  </li>
      <li>Now I feel a bit younger when I go out in public and more confident that my thining hair is unnoticeable.</li>
      <li>had people ask me if Ive been working out, If I&#x27;ve bleached my teeth, they cant pin it down, but the difference is amazing.  </li>
      <li>Looking for products to help fill in the bald spots was disappointing at best.  </li>
      <li>I repeat the hairs do not stay in place and come off super easily and make a mess.</li>
      <li>He is a new man!</li>
      <li>I found it accidentally because I was using Caboki, which IS certainly a great product, but $40 a bottle is pretty expensive after awhile!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve also tried another brand, and theyre pretty much the same thing.  </li>
      <li>If you are looking for an alternative, I would highly recommend this.  </li>
      <li>I WOULD highly recommend getting the blower thing</li>
      <li>Love it, hair at crown and sides are graying, I just use a little bit to cover, don&#x27;t have to dye hair as often saving me time and money.</li>
      <li>However, it says to apply daily which means you go through a container pretty fast.  </li>
      <li>(you&#x27;ll have to buy a small bottle of Toppik) for the frontal hair line to make it look more</li>
      <li>The only drawback has been that it can clump after several hours or being handled too much (but you can just apply a little more), and it comes out on your pillow at night if you don&#x27;t wash it out before going to bed.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a habit of running my hands through my hair frequently, and I could sort of feel the difference.  </li>
      <li>I should mention that I still have some hair even where it&#x27;s thinnest, which in my view probably helps make it look so natural and stay in place.  </li>
      <li>My husband is 48 years old and has slowly been balding, mostly in the crown, for the last 20 years.  </li>
      <li>This product worked very well and was completely undetectable on my hair other than covering up places where my scalp showed through!  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know what they do differently than the other products, but it goes on easier and less messy and looks good.</li>
      <li>Not sure it&#x27;s worth the daily fee!  </li>

    <li> I had used Caboki for awhile and liked it, but wanted to find a less expensive option.  So I tried Miracle Hair and really love it.  It is almost the exact same product as Caboki, but it is a little finer, and I think, because of that, lasts a little longer (and it is half the price). If you are looking for an alternative, I would highly recommend this.  I will be buying this from now on.</li>
    <li> This really works!!!.  I just wish there was a medium brown so I wouldn&#x27;t have to mix brown and light brown.</li>
    <li> Great product, it is the same good product my mom was looking for since long ago.</li>
    <li> This product is a scan,  plz save your money. The hair particles fall off with a simple head shake. They don&#x27;t stay in place at all, plz save yourself embarrassing moments. I repeat the hairs do not stay in place and come off super easily and make a mess. I bought the product and i used it and as soon as i stepped outside the wind knock all of what i had put on off.</li>
    <li> Miracle Hair is definitely for the self-concious man on a budget. A friend of mine had me order this for him. It is basically a dust that you shake onto your hair to blend in the bald spots. You have to be careful and hair spray it on just so you can walk around with it. Don&#x27;t think about going swimming or sweating either!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just rock the baldness.</li>
    <li> If you pass your hand through your hair after using miracle hair it leaves your hand all black. I recommend that you buy toppik that is a little bit more expensive and eventhough it also can leave your hand black it is less visible than this product.</li>
    <li> for one use and u have to take a shower otherwise all your stuff will be covered with this fiber</li>
    <li> It does what it says it does..very pleased with it! I&#x27;m glad there&#x27;s no surgical procedure I had to go through for the thinness of my hair area.</li>
    <li> I bought this product and two others just like it that are sold on Amazon that were more expensive.  I tried all three.  My medium brown hair is noticibly thin just on the crown of my head and the back part of the part in my hair, but nowhere else.  This is the only product of its kind that matched and blended perfectly with my own natural hair and it is virtually undetectable even on close inspection.  I should mention that I still have some hair even where it&#x27;s thinnest, which in my view probably helps make it look so natural and stay in place.  I use it everyday; and the product usually lasts for a month or longer.  A great value.  Now I feel a bit younger when I go out in public and more confident that my thining hair is unnoticeable. The only drawback has been that it can clump after several hours or being handled too much (but you can just apply a little more), and it comes out on your pillow at night if you don&#x27;t wash it out before going to bed.  I am not affiliated with this company, but I was so impressed I decided to write a review.  So long as the price remains so reasonable and my hair doesn&#x27;t get so thin that this doesn&#x27;t even help, I&#x27;ll look no further and continue to use this product.  I keep a three month supply on hand at home and also leave one in my car just in case I feel it&#x27;s needed (which is not often) several hours after leaving home.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t stay all day. Doesn&#x27;t work evenly.</li>
    <li> As a woman I have had a hair loss problem for most of my adult life.  Looking for products to help fill in the bald spots was disappointing at best.  Wigs in South Florida are not a great solution but I kept looking.  Last week I saw this product and ordered it thinking, \\&quot;Oh well lets see how this works out\\&quot;.  I just received it recently and already I know it is right for me.  It did what it said it would do and filled in those gaps that were so embarrassing.  And it doesn&#x27;t show all over your shoulders of your clothes like other products do when you apply it.  I was out in the weather and it did not come off in the wind nor did it come off on my hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Happy Camper endorses this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also I love Amazon Prime.  It is the best way to shop from home. No fuss, no muss. And the 2 day Free shipping has been great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sincerely,&lt;br /&gt;Rosie B</li>
    <li> Let me start off by saying, I DONT work for this company!  I found it accidentally because I was using Caboki, which IS certainly a great product, but $40 a bottle is pretty expensive after awhile!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve also tried another brand, and theyre pretty much the same thing.  I cant tell the difference between cotton fibers (Miracle Hair &amp; Caboki) or \\&quot;keratin\\&quot; which is lambswool (aka chopped up yarn).&lt;br /&gt;Ive had people ask me if Ive been working out, If I&#x27;ve bleached my teeth, they cant pin it down, but the difference is amazing.  I WOULD highly recommend getting the blower thing (you&#x27;ll have to buy a small bottle of Toppik) for the frontal hair line to make it look more natural.&lt;br /&gt;This stuff is the real deal, its no better or worse than the other stuff, and trust me, ive tried all of them.  Dont judge this box by its cover just because it says as seen on TV (because I initially did!)</li>
    <li> qiuck refund and quick delivery product does what it&#x27;s suppose to do</li>
    <li> This is the worst product ever.  Doesn&#x27;t work at all. Doesn&#x27;t stick to your hair just leave dark  spats on your scalp. Don&#x27;t buy it. Don&#x27;t waist your money. Stay away.</li>
    <li> Love it, hair at crown and sides are graying, I just use a little bit to cover, don&#x27;t have to dye hair as often saving me time and money.</li>
    <li> wonderful product. it can be messy, but i have learned how to lessen the messes. highly recommended for those unsightly thin spots</li>
    <li> This product worked very well and was completely undetectable on my hair other than covering up places where my scalp showed through!  However, it says to apply daily which means you go through a container pretty fast.  Not sure it&#x27;s worth the daily fee!  I found I was not using it because I didn&#x27;t want to get used to it and then have to keep buying it!&lt;br /&gt;Also, it seemed like I should probably wash my hair every day to wash out the remains and I don&#x27;t usually do that.  Not sure what a build up on my scalp would do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a habit of running my hands through my hair frequently, and I could sort of feel the difference.  Got a little under my nails when I scratched my scalp.  So I guess your satisfaction would depend on your personal habits and your budget.</li>
    <li> This product is the best! I have dark brown hair that is very thin at the top of my head.. This takes care of it, and even in the sun it&#x27;s not noticeable!  Fast shipping, good price!</li>
    <li> We do not work for the company.  My husband is 48 years old and has slowly been balding, mostly in the crown, for the last 20 years.  Maybe this works best for crowns but OMG!  You would never know he has no hair.  He is a new man!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know what they do differently than the other products, but it goes on easier and less messy and looks good. Keep up the good work.</li>
