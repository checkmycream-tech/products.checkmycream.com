    <li> My mom and I both have the mouth ulcer problem, its so annoying! too much pain, it goes all over my tongue and thoat, i was hoping this bottle will help us, but it didn&#x27;t! its so miserable, we can&#x27;t even eat or drink! &#x3D;(</li>
    <li> Excellent antiseptic rinse to sooth and resolve various mucosal mouth conditions. Pleasant, fresh rinse.</li>
    <li> I have tried many products for canker sores over the years.  This is the only one I have found that truly gives relief from the discomfort.  The burning stops and it does not hurt to apply.</li>
    <li> Ulcer Ease Anesthetic Mouth Rinse is Great! As a person who suffered from canker sores, this mouth rinse has been very helpful. Along with the Squigle toothpaste I hardly have any canker sores anymore!</li>

    <li> This is the best stuff ever for ulcers, period. Ever since this was recommended to me I always make sure to keep a bottle on hand just in case.</li>
    <li> got it because I had throat surgery. Takes the pain away with the first use. Something as severe as throat surgery you will need to use it about every two hrs. Though I stretched it out by only using it when I needed to drink or eat or take medication. But this stuff is amazing with a long shelf life</li>
    <li> Ulcer-ease is the only non-prescription product that eases discomfort when I have sores in my mouth, its great and releaves pain quickly.</li>

    <li> have used for years when mouth is very irratated.  Is best on market!  Works immediately!&lt;br /&gt; So happy amzon carries product</li>
    <li> I was given a small (1 oz.) bottle of this after dental surgery, with instructions from the doctor. I do not use it as a mouthwash or mouth-rinse, but just dab a little with a Q-Tip on &amp;#34;hot spots&amp;#34; created by my dentures. The 1 oz. bottle lasted almost a year, and the dentist&#x27;s assistant advised me how to find the product on Amazon. Search mission accomplished!</li>
    <li> Ulcer Ease is the best product on the market for minor skin irritations.  It is also highly recommended for people on Chemo to reduce mouth irritations. Also, the price is half of the open market.</li>
    <li> I have been using the product for years for canker sores.  It works pretty well, Best that it doesn&#x27;t leave a film or bad taste.</li>
    <li> You can&#x27;t find this stuff on the shelf anywhere near my location. It works great on the occasional mouth ulcer, so we keep a bottle on hand.</li>
    <li> On time and product is what I wanted and ordered</li>
    <li> I am  always biting my jaw or my tongue.... used this, it is great.  Good for sore throat.</li>
    <li> This is the ONLY product I have found that has worked for me.  That being said, the &amp;#34;ulcers&amp;#34; still have to run their course, but, the pain is much less severe.</li>
    <li> Was so good to be able to find this again----helps so much when mouth gets sore from dentures.  Service was good</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d used this product years ago, but hadn&#x27;t needed it since... UNTIL I recently had some major oral surgery (approx. 4 inches of incisions in the gums &amp; roof of my mouth). Swishing no more than two teaspoons of this rinse stopped all pain...... WITHOUT making food taste horrid, as some oral anesthetics do!  Great product!  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!</li>
    <li> Excellent product works within 5 minutes two swabs with a Q tip and the sore is gone. I have used many other products that do not compare to this one.</li>
    <li> Good oral rinse for sore gums or ulcers in your mouth.</li>
    <li> I ourchased this for my father - it is the best stuff for mouth ulcers and works really well in getting rid of them.  Would recommend this Seller to others!  :)</li>
    <li> This was recommended by my dermatologist. I have no end of skin issues all over my body. He recommended this to kill any surface bacteria or yeast. It has helped more than words can say. Apply, wait a minute or so and then dry with a hair dryer set on cool or allow to dry in open air.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have no idea how it works as a mouth rinse. I have never used it for that.</li>
    <li> Works well for pain from mouth ulcers or sore throat.  Have used for years!</li>
    <li> The active ingredient in this product is Phenol, which is a very mild anesthetic.  It will have some positive effect on oral ulcerations, but the effect will not last very long and you will have to keep applying it over and over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jim \\&quot;Konedog\\&quot; Koenig</li>
    <li> Helps relieve any cut or irritation of the mouth.  I have food allergies and if I accidentally eat something with yeast, my mouth gets inflammation.  This product has helped reduce the pain.</li>
    <li> This mouth rinse was absolutely what I needed! I had sores in my mouth, and I tried several products and none helped until I tried this mouth rinse, which immediately soothed the pain, and I would recommend it for anyone who has my kind of problems.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t taste good in your mouth but I add some water to it instead of full strenght. I feel it helps for any irritation in the mouth or to the back of your throat.</li>
    <li> Only thing I&#x27;ll use for a mouth sore.</li>
    <li> If you get canker sores, this is the stuff for you. No longer carried in our local drug stores, I was delighted to find this on Amazon. Recommend.</li>
    <li> I have used this product many times in the past. It worked well when I went through radiation treatment for my cancer, where other products did not. I recently had a very raw mouth due to having to take a lot of antibiotics and thought again of ulcer ease to give me some relief. I ordered it &amp; immediately started getting relief from the sore, achy, rawness in my mouth. I have tried biotene &amp; many others in the past but they did not work as good as ulcer ease &amp; they tasted nasty where ulcer ease was pleasant to take. I very highly recommend ulcer ease for any soreness, any ulcers, any rawness, etc., in the mouth. It&#x27;s a great product &amp; I won&#x27;t hesitate to order it again when needed. It&#x27;s convenient &amp; easy to use and lasts a long time, with just a little bit going a long way. Take my word for it.....it works great!</li>
    <li> I got this product 10 years ago when I was undergoing chemo treatments. It healed my mouth ulcers faster than any product I&#x27;ve ever used. I still get it for mouth sores of any kind and the pain is gone the next day.</li>
    <li> I have purchased this product before and it always works as advertised.  The product arrived on schedule with no problems.</li>
