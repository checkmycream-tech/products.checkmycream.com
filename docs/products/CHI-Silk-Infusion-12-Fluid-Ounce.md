      <li>Amazon has the best price on Chi, better than Walmart where I get 6 oz for the same price as this 12 oz</li>
      <li>The price on Amazon at the time was almost phenomenal when compared to the price at beauty supply stores, so I ordered it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Does any product smell better than Chi?</li>
      <li>For me, next to the smell of the aroma oil Eucalyptus &amp; Spearmint, the smell of chi is the best.</li>
      <li>I love this stuff.</li>
      <li>I love it.  </li>
      <li>I apply this mixture to my scalp and it is helps to keep my scalp and hair healthy.</li>

      <li>I love this product.</li>
      <li>Fantastic Stuff!  </li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>After using it, my hair feels softer!  :-)</li>
      <li>I was glad I looked on Amazon for it.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using CHI silk infusion for years, and I love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I have used this product for MANY years....</li>
      <li>I love this.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not thick and sticky like most products and it smells great.</li>
      <li>use this product to detangle damp hair, and it not only smells really good, but it coats my hair and gives it great slip for easy detangling.</li>
      <li>More importantly, the product did not work well at all.</li>
      <li>It really makes my hair feel good, helps keep split ends to a minimum.</li>
      <li>My hair was turning white and now it is a beautiful silver/gray.  </li>
      <li>Good hair and accessories have made me feel comfortable about the makeup decision and having fly away hair was starting to really get to me.</li>
      <li>Great product and I have bought several times on amazon!</li>
      <li>This is a great product, especially if you have chemically treated hair.  </li>
      <li>great price compared to buying a smaller bottle in the stores</li>
      <li>It gives some shine to my short, curly hairstyle, and smells great.  </li>
      <li>I wrote a review before saying that it&#x27;s good for fine-textured hair that gets colored lighter than it&#x27;s natural color</li>
      <li>Good Price, recommended by professional hair dressers after hair straightening treatments.</li>
      <li>do good and feel so soft.</li>
      <li>Not too many products are up to the task, but this one works very well.</li>
      <li>I have used this product for 5 years and it is a smooth liquid and golden color.  </li>
      <li>My first hint was the strong smell.</li>
      <li>this is a great product i have tried using other brands</li>
      <li>This product works great for smoothing my hair without making it feel greasy or heavy.</li>
      <li>It feels somewhat oily when you put it on your hands (you don&#x27;t need much) but it works into your hair as an incredibly light styling aid.</li>
      <li>I need this product to give my hair a better sense of style for my job with still providing a natural look.</li>
      <li>It is typically a golden colour, and while it&#x27;s a silky, gel-like product, I would never say it is &amp;#34;goopy&amp;#34;.</li>
      <li>the shampoos are worth every cent as well.</li>
      <li>So worth the money for the size of the bottle.</li>
      <li>Also, liked the fact that you can get the larger size, Target doesn&#x27;t always carry that size.</li>
      <li>my favorite hair product its all you need to have beautiful hair just add and blow dry or leave wet</li>
      <li>In fact, my hair feels very natural and smooth with lots of body and movement.</li>
      <li>I know this product very, very well.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve noticed that the fakes are still golden colored like the real ones.</li>
      <li>Does a great job of taming my thick curly hair.</li>
      <li>Buyer beware, I am a licensed cosmetologist and worked in a salon where we used CHI, this most definitely is not CHI!</li>
      <li>and she uses this to keep her hair tangle-free, soft and smooth.</li>
      <li>Thanks for reading!</li>
      <li>Firstly, I have relaxed hair.</li>
      <li>Makes my hair smooth and soft.  </li>
      <li>The smell is divine though and the fact that it contains silk proteins (which my hair likes for some reason *shrugs*) is why I&#x27;ll keep using it.</li>
      <li>You need more of the product to get the same results.  </li>
      <li>The real one actually smells pretty good, and the smell is very feint if barely</li>
      <li>My hair has gotten so much stronger and actually has gotten more color (I am gray).  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used this product for a long time and really love it.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend this product, I use to purchase it through a Beauty Supply Store - more costly for same product.</li>
      <li>True CHI Silk Infusion is a golden color with a specific scent and a silky texture.</li>
      <li>I bought two of the large bottles as it is way cheaper than buying them at a drugstore.</li>
      <li>but instead, it looks just as soft, shiny and silky as the very first time it was colored; and I&#x27;ve been having it colored for about 16 months now.</li>
      <li>I would reocmmend this product to anyone who wants to prevent detangling damage and promote hair strength.</li>
      <li>This Chi Infusion works very well on my hair.&lt;br</li>
      <li>THIS IS NOT THE REAL CHI ..</li>
      <li>I would have expected better with the \\&quot;CHI\\&quot; Brand name and rep</li>
      <li>so when my hair started going &amp;#34;adrift&amp;#34; with age, it really bummed me out.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t wear makeup because I do not believe it important to enough I want to spend my money there</li>
      <li>Go the drugstore or a salon for the real product.</li>
      <li>The product I received, while in the right bottle, was clear in colour and goopy, like a hair gel.</li>
      <li>Even when you can get it here for a fraction of the cost of what you can buy it in the stores for, it still seems high when you have so many other places you need to be putting your money.</li>
      <li>You will have better luck purchasing an authentic imitation product by a different brand that does the same thing.  </li>
      <li>My hairdresser has been using it for some time, but the price she quoted me to purchase it for me was too high.  </li>
      <li>so I expected it to be genuine.</li>
      <li>In fact it makes my hair very silky and natural looking without the limpness.</li>
      <li>Is saving ten dollars really worth taking that risk?</li>
      <li>The oil did not have the typical yellow tint, and it also did not have the nice perfume scent.</li>
      <li>I opened the new bottle today, and it was not the correct color or consistency.  </li>
      <li>This arrived quickly, was a little less expensive than purchasing at Target, and was great to be able to shop from home.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Great product and I have bought several times on amazon! Helps your hair if you straighten your hair a lot and need a shine and put oils back in your hair!  Only need a nickle size amount and last quite awhile!</li>
    <li> I have curly hair and I use this when I straighten my hair. It makes my hair feel soft and silky. I also started putting a bit in my hair after my leave in conditioner when I leave my hair curly. It makes my curls silky and soft.</li>
    <li> Good Price, recommended by professional hair dressers after hair straightening treatments.I use a trI from CHI which includes Shampoo &amp; Treatment.</li>
    <li> I use this when I straighten my hair and it does a good job not to mention that it doesn&#x27;t smell bad.  I have long, thick, thick, hair and it truly works wonders.</li>
    <li> This product is wonderful if you can get your hands on an authentic version. I&#x27;ve spent a lot of money trying the ones sold on amazon and the ones sold at twice the price in stores.  All the ones sold here are fakes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product has not really changed their formula, in any noticeable way, over the past few years.  So if you see yours smells strongly of cologne, it means you have purchased a fake product.  If it feels more watery than it should, it is a fake product.  I&#x27;ve noticed that the fakes are still golden colored like the real ones. The chi silks sold on amazon also feel less dense and poorly concentrated compared to silks sold in regular stores.  You need more of the product to get the same results.  The real one actually smells pretty good, and the smell is very feint if barely there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want great results, then buy this product at retail from a store.  If you want to save money, don&#x27;t buy the ones online because they are all fakes.  You will have better luck purchasing an authentic imitation product by a different brand that does the same thing.  The real chi silk lasts a really long time (MONTHS in my case, sometimes the entire year).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure why amazon continues to sell these fake products to unassuming customers, as this has been going on for years.  I don&#x27;t know what these replacement fake products really are, and for all anyone knows, they could have something dangerous to your health in them.  Is saving ten dollars really worth taking that risk?</li>
    <li> This is just a high-grade hair oil that calms down blow-dried hair prior to spraying.  It&#x27;s pricey, but it performs as advertised.</li>
    <li> This product gives just enough hold without any stiffness at all. In fact it makes my hair very silky and natural looking without the limpness. I am male with shoulder length hair in the back. I need this product to give my hair a better sense of style for my job with still providing a natural look. Try it!</li>
    <li> Does a great job of taming my thick curly hair. Not too many products are up to the task, but this one works very well.</li>
    <li> The seal was broken on the bottle and the product inside was a FAKE! True CHI Silk Infusion is a golden color with a specific scent and a silky texture. The product inside the bottle is clear and does not even remotely work the way that true CHI Silk Infusion does. I was so very disappointed. I have ordered this same product and size before with no problems from a different seller at about the same price. This order was fulfilled by Amazon so I expected it to be genuine.</li>
    <li> Does any product smell better than Chi? For me, next to the smell of the aroma oil Eucalyptus &amp; Spearmint, the smell of chi is the best. I mix this with fractionated coconut oil and Jamaican Black Castor oil. Chi disguises the smell of the castor oil which is great for healing and maintaining healthy hairline but have an off-putting smell. I apply this mixture to my scalp and it is helps to keep my scalp and hair healthy.</li>
    <li> This Chi Infusion works very well on my hair.&lt;br /&gt;It is not oily and does not build up on your hair.&lt;br /&gt;Also it gives your hair the proper shine.</li>
    <li> Love this product.  Makes my hair smooth and soft.  Smells good too.  Exactly what I expected and for a much cheaper price than I could have gotten in my local Ulta or Sephora.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for a long time and really love it. It really makes my hair feel good, helps keep split ends to a minimum.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using CHI silk infusion for years, and I love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HOWEVER,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;when I received my last shipment, the product had absolutely been tampered with. My first hint was the strong smell. I at first thought the package must have been damaged and leaked everywhere, but no, the bottle itself was dry. When I unscrewed the cap to remove the seal, I found the seal was partially opened and there was a CREASE where it was folded over. Finally, the contents of the bottle smell like CHI and more or less feel like CHI, but it&#x27;s perfectly clear- not the honey color I know. It seems fairly obvious someone switched out the contents somewhere after it was manufactured but before it reached me. I&#x27;m feeling pretty cheated over here and very unhappy.</li>
    <li> This is the best hair product I&#x27;ve ever used. It&#x27;s not thick and sticky like most products and it smells great. It&#x27;s the only product that makes my dull dry mop look shiny.</li>
    <li> I watched a hair tutorial video of a young woman who used this product, and then read the online reviews to make a purchase decision. The price on Amazon at the time was almost phenomenal when compared to the price at beauty supply stores, so I ordered it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this product to detangle damp hair, and it not only smells really good, but it coats my hair and gives it great slip for easy detangling. I prefer to air dry my hair rather than blow dry, and CHI Silk Infusion doesn&#x27;t leave it feeling sticky, greasy, or heavy at all. In fact, my hair feels very natural and smooth with lots of body and movement. I would reocmmend this product to anyone who wants to prevent detangling damage and promote hair strength.</li>
    <li> I wish I had found this product years ago.  My hairdresser has been using it for some time, but the price she quoted me to purchase it for me was too high.  I was glad I looked on Amazon for it.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for MANY years.... The REAL product is a golden color, NOT clear!!!!!  Be VERY careful buying this product!</li>
    <li> I  smell it &amp; different smell ( i use it for 2 years) I return it for refund .. THIS IS NOT THE REAL CHI .. i should read the review before ,,,:(</li>
    <li> I have hesitated to purchase this stuff because of the cost. Even when you can get it here for a fraction of the cost of what you can buy it in the stores for, it still seems high when you have so many other places you need to be putting your money. I don&#x27;t wear makeup because I do not believe it important to enough I want to spend my money there so when my hair started going &amp;#34;adrift&amp;#34; with age, it really bummed me out. Good hair and accessories have made me feel comfortable about the makeup decision and having fly away hair was starting to really get to me. I admit, I haven&#x27;t but tried this once but honestly, my hair hasn&#x27;t looked this nice in years! Age has really dried my hair so breakage and flyaway&#x27;s have been a normal occurrence. Suddenly, I am looking at my hair from my youth (although a few strands I refer to as moonbeams have also graced my head now!) As it is, I wish I would have bought this a few years back. Thank you makers of CHI!</li>
    <li> It does what it claims.  Works well for me and a little goes a long way.  I tried other hair care products and none performed like CHI Silk Infusion.</li>
    <li> It is exactly what I need it, leaves your hair with no frizz and it dures several days, yo wake up like if you had already done your hair</li>
    <li> This is just what I ordered. So worth the money for the size of the bottle. Chi is always been the best for me.</li>
    <li> I wrote a review before saying that it&#x27;s good for fine-textured hair that gets colored lighter than it&#x27;s natural color but I think I forgot to mention that I think it would be a bit too heavy for fine-textured layered hair. I have a blunt-cut bob that hangs about 3 inches below my chin and it gets dyed red every 5 weeks (my natural color is very dark brown). If it weren&#x27;t for this silk oil, my hair would&#x27;ve broken off and dried up ages ago but instead, it looks just as soft, shiny and silky as the very first time it was colored; and I&#x27;ve been having it colored for about 16 months now. It is a wonderful product and the shampoos are worth every cent as well.</li>
    <li> Always makes my hair feel like silk!!</li>
    <li> Sold by Amazon. Fake. Transparent, and should be yellow. The smell is different. Disappointed.</li>
    <li> I have thick curly hair, this works very well with it. Amazon has the best price on Chi, better than Walmart where I get 6 oz for the same price as this 12 oz</li>
    <li> my favorite hair product its all you need to have beautiful hair just add and blow dry or leave wet</li>
    <li> Chi Silk Infusion is a great conditioner, after shampooing or anytime.  It gives some shine to my short, curly hairstyle, and smells great.  It feels somewhat oily when you put it on your hands (you don&#x27;t need much) but it works into your hair as an incredibly light styling aid.</li>
    <li> I use this after I get out of the shower (just a tiny bit, that&#x27;s all that&#x27;s needed) and my hair feels amazing and looks great!</li>
    <li> This is a great product, especially if you have chemically treated hair.  I have used this product for years and there&#x27;s nothing else like it!</li>
    <li> This product works great for smoothing my hair without making it feel greasy or heavy. This is a product I have used in the past and will continue to use.</li>
    <li> Love this!  My hair has gotten so much stronger and actually has gotten more color (I am gray).  My hair was turning white and now it is a beautiful silver/gray.  My husband liked what it did to my hair and he started using it.</li>
    <li> My hairdresser started using this product on my hair.  I have been using this for years....After using it, my hair feels softer!  :-)</li>
    <li> Great product, just like described, very good seller . Thank you</li>
    <li> This is the best thing I have ever used on my hair.  When I blow out my hair, it comes out like silk</li>
    <li> Firstly, I have relaxed hair. It works alright. But if you&#x27;re hair is protein sensitive, you might want to be weary. My hair like animal proteins (i.e. hydrolyzed collagen, etc). This product contains wheat proteins which don&#x27;t agree with me. I can use it sparingly and it works. The smell is divine though and the fact that it contains silk proteins (which my hair likes for some reason *shrugs*) is why I&#x27;ll keep using it. Plus 12 fluid ounces is A LOT! Thanks for reading!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. I don&#x27;t know how I ever did my hair without it. It protects my hair from the heat of straightening every day, and it smells amazing! (Kind of like cologne, in my opinion). Definitely recommend!!</li>
    <li> I love this product. It makes my hair smell  do good and feel so soft. Its not overly oily and it doesn&#x27;t weigh your hair down.</li>
    <li> this product is amazing to use and makes my hair look healthy- great price compared to buying a smaller bottle in the stores</li>
    <li> Daughter has long brown hair down to her lower back and she uses this to keep her hair tangle-free, soft and smooth. She uses very little and this bottle lasts 8 or 9 months. She asked for it for Christmas this year and was ecstatic to receive it. All Chi products we have tried are excellent and this is no exception.</li>
    <li> This was exactly what I expected.  I love it.  I would purchase it again and would recommend it to others</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for 5 plus years. It works great when applying on damp, shampooed hair - I combine with Purerology  Hair Repair and the combination is perfect - not greasy, helps reduce fritz, refines curls and smooths straight hair. If I have been out in humid weather a small dab helps smooth my hair back into shape! Highly recommend this product, I use to purchase it through a Beauty Supply Store - more costly for same product.</li>
    <li> I have been using CHI Silk Infusion for 3+ years. I know this product very, very well. I love it. It is typically a golden colour, and while it&#x27;s a silky, gel-like product, I would never say it is &amp;#34;goopy&amp;#34;. The product I received, while in the right bottle, was clear in colour and goopy, like a hair gel. Not at all what I should have received. This totally makes me suspect of any further purchases - so please be ware. I&#x27;ve purchased this product through Amazon before, but never through &amp;#34;Atlas Supply Chain Consulting Services&amp;#34;. Do NOT trust them.</li>
    <li> I bought two of the large bottles as it is way cheaper than buying them at a drugstore. The oil did not have the typical yellow tint, and it also did not have the nice perfume scent. More importantly, the product did not work well at all. My hair looked dry, as I had not applied anything to it. I will just have to pay the extra money at a drugstore to ensure I am getting the real product.</li>
    <li> As always, my husband love&#x27;s this product.  He has curly thick hair and that&#x27;s what he likes . Excellent price too.</li>
    <li> I always order this product BEFORE I run out. So when I received this order, I had no reason to open it.  I opened the new bottle today, and it was not the correct color or consistency.  It was clear and lumpy.  I have used this product for 5 years and it is a smooth liquid and golden color.  I will NEVER order this product online again.</li>
    <li> Not the same product as purchased in other retail outlets, but in the same packaging.</li>
    <li> I love this.  My hair tends to tangle a lot.  With this, I can comb through my hair without pulling them off.  A little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> This arrived quickly, was a little less expensive than purchasing at Target, and was great to be able to shop from home. Also, liked the fact that you can get the larger size, Target doesn&#x27;t always carry that size.</li>
    <li> Buyer beware, I am a licensed cosmetologist and worked in a salon where we used CHI, this most definitely is not CHI! CHI is not clear and the first clue was that the safety cover was stuck up in lid. Go the drugstore or a salon for the real product.</li>
    <li> I would have expected better with the \\&quot;CHI\\&quot; Brand name and rep but it&#x27;s no big deal and does NOT hold the style.  My hair is very easy to straighten as it is naturally straight and baby fine but does have a slight annoying wave to it that I like to straighten out. I have used other similar products in the past and I felt as if I had spent way too much for something that only lasted for about three hours. REDKEN Extreme Heat Iron Repair is WAY better-holds the style all day and that is what I am using now.</li>
    <li> Fantastic Stuff!  I get so many compliments on how wonderful my hair smells!</li>
    <li> I love this product, it is so good for my hair.&lt;br /&gt;I would not set my hair without it.&lt;br /&gt;Great stuff</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t live without this product, even with a keratin treatment, this keeps hair soft and shiny</li>
    <li> this is a great product i have tried using other brands but Chi brand is still the best, I never finish the other products and I go back to purchase the Chi brand</li>
