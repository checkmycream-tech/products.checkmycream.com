<li> She hasn&#x27;t given any negative feed back yet.</li>
<li> It also came with a few samples for other products.</li>
<li> but I get half of the bottle and out of the box that had been launched.</li>
<li> someone used it and put it back into the broken box the perfume bottle was half empty W.T.F?</li>
<li> I received the Item late, opened and half empty.</li>
<li> Even if the perfume had been horrible, which it is not, the boxing would have made up for it. :-)</li>
<li> The lotion is horrible its way to strong and doesn&#x27;t fade at all.</li>
<li> this perfume smells terrible when you first spray it.</li>

    <li> Received package in a timely manner.  Impressed with scent which lasts majority of the day. I am going to search for the red bottle version of this fragrance.  Hopefully the price will be just as reasonable.</li>
    <li> Smells amazing and came exactly as the picture is shown. Love the trio combo, the smell is fantastic ! Best perfume smell ever</li>
    <li> This perfume was brand new, which was exactly as described.  I just wish I would have shopped around for a better package that came with the ea de parfum roller, but I still love the smell!</li>
    <li> I received the Item late, opened and half empty. someone used it and put it back into the broken box the perfume bottle was half empty W.T.F? could not beleive it</li>
    <li> My 30 y/o diva niece loved it. Christmas gift . Fancy box and design. Diva name on the box. Nice assortment of products in the box . She hasn&#x27;t given any negative feed back yet. The material must be good also.</li>
    <li> This perfume has an intoxicating blend of florals and musk that leaves a spicy but not overpowering seductive fragrance.  It doesn&#x27;t knock you in the face but begs the question of coming close to smell the fragrance.  It lasts through the evening.</li>
    <li> Love this smell and how it lingers</li>
    <li> arrived super fast, on time. Very good product and is the largest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;   My wife is happy.&lt;br /&gt;Soon be buying another as a gift.</li>

    <li> this perfume smells terrible when you first spray it. after about ten minutes it fades to a nice rose smell but at first it smells like tortillas and roses mixed together. The lotion is horrible its way to strong and doesn&#x27;t fade at all. i would like this perfume alot more if it smelled good when i first sprayed it. but im giving it two stars because it smells good after awhile but although i will finish using this product i wont be buying it again.</li>

    <li> This is my first time trying this fragrance.  I loved the scent when I smelled it on a friend who love it! so, I decided to try it and since it was a great price, I purchased 2; however, I wish I had bought more.  I think it will now be added to my favorite list of fragrances as I have many (Initial by Boucheron; Angel; Euphoria; Samsara; Michael Kors; Marc Jacobs; Jivago - just to name a few).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you and have a blessed year.</li>
