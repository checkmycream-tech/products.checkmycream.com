<li> i&#x27;m probably just used to the flat brushes</li>
<li> maybe i just got old ones but definitely was not pleased with what i got.</li>
<li> Nothing wrong with the brush unless you don&#x27;t like your nail brush short (only about 7inches long), and the logo/made in China,  blocking the pretty yet tini-wini pressed flower in the handle.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;m going to buy another one in the other size.  </li>
<li> THE BRUSH SLOWED ME DOWN WHEN APPLYING ACRYLIC</li>
<li> a little shorter handle than im used to but overall....came in a timely manner....</li>
<li> it&#x27;s a little to fluffy ..</li>
<li> Dont waste your money.</li>
<li> This brush is not good at all... very dry at the tips.</li>
<li> I just started to use it and the next day the fur is turning gross and it looks really bad</li>
<li> HARD</li>
<li> HAD TO THIN BRUSH OUT</li>
<li> Poor quality..</li>
<li> This is crazy.</li>
<li> It leaves no bristles behind or anything bad for that matter!  </li>
<li> This is the worst brush I have ever bought!</li>

    <li> I am in love with this brush. I ordered the #12. It is of high quality and behaved well when I trained it ( a 2 over night process) to be a flat brush - the shape has been holding up for two days now. I will definitely be ordering more of these from Beauticom - it processed and shipped super fast. Product is just as it is described! Happy customer here!</li>
    <li> This brush is a nice enough brush, I would have liked it to have been a little bigger for my needs, but the brush itself was of quality material.</li>
    <li> brushes didn&#x27;t even last a day.... they were all falling out of the metal handle and bristles were stuck to clear plastic &amp;#34;protecting&amp;#34; the brush. maybe i just got old ones but definitely was not pleased with what i got.</li>
    <li> Love this brush! I&#x27;m going to buy another one in the other size.  It leaves no bristles behind or anything bad for that matter!  Applies the acrylic so smooth that you will cut filing / sanding time in half.  The shipping was super fast, it arrived way before the estimated delivery date.  I say this seller is trustworthy and I would buy from them again.</li>
    <li> HAD TO THIN BRUSH OUT MIDDLE TOO THICH KEPT GETTING CLUMPED UP HARD TO TRAIN THE BRUSH SLOWED ME DOWN WHEN APPLYING ACRYLIC</li>
    <li> I started to do acrylic nails this year and I am very pleased with this brush. It works just like when the nail stylist did my nails at the nail salon. As long as you use the brush cleaning liquid and a little bit of cuticle oil, it will continue to work great:) I had to get a second one bcuz I love it!</li>
    <li> Im a nail tech and had been looking for an awesome brush....I sooo found it! Love how it works! Thanks!</li>
    <li> Way too big for my liking, but that&#x27;s my fault. Looks pretty though and seems to be of good quality.</li>

    <li> I am a nail tech for 7 years. I bought 4 of these. This brush is not good at all... very dry at the tips. Poor quality.. I will not buy this brush again. Dont waste your money.</li>
    <li> This is the worst brush I have ever bought! When I put the brush in the monomer it waved up!! This is crazy. Money lost!!</li>
    <li> The brush a a pretty good quality brush but its kind of big for me! I like the flower it has inside its a nice touch !!</li>
    <li> I dont use this all the time, so what I do use it for it works great. I&lt;br /&gt;thought It was a nice brush for the price.</li>
