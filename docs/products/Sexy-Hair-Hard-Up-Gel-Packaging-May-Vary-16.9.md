<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Not exactly what I wanted but was good</li>
    <li> Great value!  I was able to save a ton when comparing to a much smaller version I had to keep buying at the store.</li>
    <li> What can you say about this product other than you definitely get what you pay for. I call this contact cement in a bottle made for hair. This product has a firm hold that last throughout the day and is pretty good at weathering a night of sleep. This bottle size last a long time and is easy to apply. Shipping was prompt and secure.</li>
    <li> well worth the price. I have stiff bristly hair and this tames it well. does not flake like cheap gel</li>
    <li> Best hair products out there without paying high price.</li>
    <li> the product seems Okay for styling, but I began to lose patches of hair after using this product. It may not be the cause, but I do not know that.  For now I will stop using it.</li>
    <li> First a little about my hair-It&#x27;s thick and typically worn on the short side (but can get thick and long quickly).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This gel has worked on my hair no matter length or thickness! It holds all day and leaves your hair with a wet look all day! I&#x27;ve tried other gels but none have come close to the hold OR look of this product! And the price is right, here on Amazon. It costs quite a bit more in salons!</li>
    <li> My husband uses this to &amp;#34;crinkle&amp;#34; his hair on top.  It&#x27;s AWESOME.  It literally holds until you wash it out.</li>
    <li> Wifes favorite gel been buying it for years and giving it the same review also for years.</li>
    <li> After reading all the great reviews about this product, I decided to get it.  When I received it and pumped some out of the bottle, I wasn&#x27;t expecting what I got.  Its very gluey and sticky, did not feel like a normal gel that moves around freely in your hand.  This literally felt like a hard glue in my hands.  I went ahead anyway and put it in my hair, I have longer hair than just spikes on top, probably 2-3 inches around, and this gel was just too sticky to do what I wanted with my longer hair.  I also have a lot of hair, as soon as the gel got into my hair it was just impossible to move it around.  I quickly washed out my hair and am using L.A. Looks, a more traditional gel.  In conclusion this \\&quot;gel\\&quot; didn&#x27;t work for me.  I gave it 2 stars because some people are looking for a very hard glue type gel and if you have very short hair to spike it probably does work, but if you like more of a water based gel and have longer hair, this is not for you.</li>
    <li> Great product and I like the pump bottle.</li>
    <li> Hey brah, if you like going to the club and fist pumping to the DJ&#x27;s mega mix, then this hair product is for you guy.  I love to fist pump. I do it all day everyday brah. I use this stuff all over my body sometimes just to make the ladies know how awesome I am. When I&#x27;m posted up in the corner, checking out all the fine ladies, I know the bass won&#x27;t move my awesomely blown out hair. I think sometimes that I am super hero and that I could impale like, some bad guy with my hair its so stiff. Like hit them right in the gut or maybe run past them and get them in the neck or something like that. I should probably like right some scripts and send them to holly wood or something. I mean, alot of people like me brah. ALOT! I&#x27;m so popular with the ladies an stuff, don&#x27;t be jealous brah!  Sometimes I don&#x27;t shower for a week because this stuff works so good. My mom is like \\&quot;brah you need to take a shower\\&quot; and i&#x27;m like \\&quot;Hey mah my head is perfection and the ladies love it!\\&quot; My mom hates when I bring home all the ladies from the club and they are all up on my head and touching my stiff hair and are like \\&quot;I wish I could put some hair gel in my hair\\&quot; an I&#x27;m like \\&quot;I have plenty of hair gel brah, I buy this stuff in bulk guy!\\&quot;   My mah makes me leave the door open when the ladies come over because she know i&#x27;m like the brah of macking and stuff. Mah is always like, \\&quot;Brah you&#x27;ll get a disease\\&quot; and i&#x27;m like \\&quot;Mah, My hair won&#x27;t let me, i&#x27;m immune brah.\\&quot; All day long I hear her.  When it rains, like the water like bounces off my hair guy, and i&#x27;m like a duck or something, i&#x27;m pretty sure if I knew how to swim that when I jumped in the water I would like float upside down on my head because no water would mess up my blow out brah.</li>
    <li> Very satisfied with this gel. Easy to wash off and great when you want to style your hair. Last all day even if under drizzle/rain. If you are contemplating it, give it a shot you won&#x27;t be dissatisfied.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like the smell, but worse, I can&#x27;t believe how difficult it was to wash it out of my hair.  Thank goodness I only used it to hold my bangs slicked back.  I can&#x27;t imagine how horrible the experience would have been had I used it throughout my hair.  I had to shampoo twice, and use inordinate amounts of shampoo just to get it all out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I want to grow my bangs out. With this glue in my hair, I can&#x27;t run my fingers through it. If you want to convert your hair into a helmet, this is the goop</li>
    <li> smells good and def holds your hair....even when I&#x27;m sweating and working out after work the gel still holds....super impressive stuff....if your skeptical you can even purchase this gel at Target for about the same amount of money (but an easily return it @ target if you dont like it)</li>
    <li> This is the best hair gel there is.Great for short hair if you like the messed up look or spiked style.</li>
    <li> Best thing out there for short hairdos especially good for spiking tried lots of products this is the best!</li>
    <li> I have kinky frizzy hair. I have tried everything from relaxers to straightening irons to manage it. For me having a good hair day is few and far between. I don&#x27;t know how a bottle of \\&quot;short sexy hair\\&quot; got into my medicine cabinet, but I tried it and have been having great hair days ever since. It&#x27;s the only product that can manage my hair and not feel itchy. I even go to bed with it in my hair and wake up with near perfect hair. I just add a dab in the morning for touch-up. This stuff works so great it saved me from shaving my head from frustration. I&#x27;m also getting a lot of complements on how good my hair looks. I never got that before.</li>
    <li> This gel is great! My son&#x27;s hair stays strong for 3 days if we don&#x27;t wash it out. This stuff was still working even after a full day at the beach. If you&#x27;re looking for a softer hold, this isn&#x27;t it! This product holds very stiff. One pump is usually enough to cover his head. This will be our gel for a long time.</li>
    <li> Finally, I was able to find a gel that wouldn&#x27;t flake and one that would withstand hurricane like weather.  Great product...</li>
    <li> This is a great product.  One pump or even a little less works all day.  You can even sleep overnight, and the gel is still holding. I don&#x27;t think a tornado could move the hold you get. The gel is not sticky and easy to use.  Good price for the quantity.  This is a great deal.  I would definitely purchase again.</li>
    <li> The product is too sticky and is hard to work with in the hair.  It also dries out my hair.</li>
    <li> This is easily hands-down the best gel I&#x27;ve ever used.  Strong reliable lasting hold, little to no flakes, and no streaks.  It&#x27;s pricey in stores -- which makes this deal all the sweeter!  Highly recommend it to anyone!</li>
    <li> Very good product except that they sent me the 5.1oz tube instead of the 16.9oz pump bottle. Not sure why this happened but my receipt said for the 16.9oz bottle. Not very happy about the situation.</li>
    <li> Okay, kind of weird to review hair gel, but it is the best stuff I&#x27;ve used.  A hairdresser put it in my hair probably 6 or 7 years ago and I&#x27;ve been buying it ever since.  Expensive as hell, but at least twice I&#x27;ve tried switching to regular store-bought gel to save money, and I always came back.  The off-the-shelf brands made my hair greasy without giving much stiffness.  This stuff gives you the stiffness you need without too much of the greasy look (make sure your hair is not too wet or it will) and without making your hair clump together.  I like it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this gel for about 10 years and it is great stuff. Put a little amount in my hair, shape it and in about an hour it is rock hard. Lasts all day and even when I sleep on it it is still hard, might look a little funk but it is still in hard. Highly recommend this gel!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using various gels and my type of hair doesn&#x27;t allow me not to.&lt;br /&gt;This gel is absolutely the toughest ever! in 20min your hair will become a plastic mold. yet the look is super natural. I couldnt even believe I can wash this thing off.&lt;br /&gt;Doesnt flake, doesnt wear out, humid resistant BUT some might find it too stiff.&lt;br /&gt;American Crew would be my second choice if you&#x27;re on the milder side.</li>
    <li> Received item pretty fast. I mainly bought because of the high reviews. This gel works marvelously and holds up well after a 10 hour work shirt. It has a strong hold with no flakes. Would recommend and purchase again in the future.</li>
    <li> Works great ! One of the best Gels on the market</li>
    <li> Super good hold your hair as you want is</li>
    <li> Here are the basics:  -It makes your hair like a shield.  -There&#x27;s a lot of it.     So if you like those two, you should get this.     *note: hurricane force winds &lt; this gel.</li>
    <li> On time and as described.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product ever since I changed my hair to a spiky style several years ago.  No other gels would work despite their claim.  I highly recommend this product if your hair is difficult to style like mine.</li>
    <li> If you want a gel that will hold your hair then this is the product you want.  I&#x27;ve gotten hard hold gels at the store and have been disapointed.  This product works as it is supposed to and then some.  Just a dab will do you, so the jar lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> I have used dozens of hair products - gels, mousses, sprays, pomades, you name it - and Short Sexy Hair/Hard Up Gel is by far the best.  It&#x27;s a little pricey, but believe me, you get what you pay for.  The 16.9 oz bottle lasts me the better part of year because I can use it more sparingly than other gels.  And the hold is ridiculous.  It will keep your style perfectly in tact for the entire day (and night).  You can even wet your hair and re-style it without another application.  Do yourself a favor and give it a try.</li>
    <li> I am not a guy but I thought I would give this hair gel a try since I like the separated curl look.  I have long thick curly cork screw hair.  I found this to very drying after three days of using it daily and kind of expensive.  I am happier with the Dep Marathon gel (orange).  It is moisturizing and cheaper.  Every time I go back to this gel (when I run out of Dep), I get the same drying results.  Probably just because of my hair type.  It does hold pretty well though.[[ASIN:B0034KWMZO Dep #11 Gel Sport Texture 12 oz. (Orange) Marathon Hold]]</li>
    <li> It keeps up with you all day and washes out good. No other gel comes close. Been using it for years.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this stuff for years. I have short fine, STRAIGHT hair and require a firm holding gel to keep the style in place. This is the only product that works for me. It doesn&#x27;t leave my hair hard and crusty, I would guess you&#x27;re using too much if that&#x27;s the case. I use a pea size amount and it holds. I&#x27;ve tried other products and bought several store brands, I should have saved my money and just bought this stuff.</li>
    <li> If you have short hair and don&#x27;t want 1 strand to move this is the stuff.  Excellent product that is easy to wash out and works like concrete.  Best product I&#x27;ve ever used for spiking.</li>
    <li> This stuff is expensive versus the $2 kmart crap, but it&#x27;s worth every penny. I can go 3 days with the same gel with just some touchups in the morning or before going out. i always get 2 solid days out of it and started washing my hair every other day to keep the same look. i&#x27;m a guy with short hair- i get a number 2 buzz on the sides and finger tip cut on the top so it&#x27;s not like i&#x27;m a hippie with dirty dreads- and get months out of one of these tubs and it&#x27;s in my hair every day.    i recently left half a tub @ a friend&#x27;s house a few hours away and now he refuses to give it back cause he likes it so much! am buying my 3rd tub so far and my first purchase was in february and lasted until early july.</li>
    <li> Love this product. Have been using it over 10 years. Holds up agains all kinds of weather conditions! Whether it rains..snows or windstorm... Even survived torrential rainstorm once. Hair stays in place! A little goes a long way. I always have try to have a back up bottle since it is hard to get where I live.  Would definately recommend</li>
    <li> Been using this gel for 4-5 years.  Have tried all types but never have found a gel that has great hold like this and just doesnt flake even when it dries out.  not cheap, but none of it really is - and i havent found another that doesnt flake even when the container says so!</li>
    <li> I used to own \\&quot;L.A. Looks Gel #10 Mega X-treme Hold\\&quot;, and this flakes after 3-5 hours once you put it on.  Well it was ok because it only costs a dollar a Walmart and grocery stores.  So after this problem with flaking, I decided to find a new gel, one that doesn&#x27;t flake.  I searched for gel on amazon and found this one.  Once I tried it, it doesn&#x27;t flake at all.  It stays hard the whole day.  I find it weird that one person says he sleeps with it on and keeps it for the next day (that must mean he doesn&#x27;t take a shower); this may be weird but it is true that it can last over a day and remain hard.  The dispenser is kind of like a soap, and I don&#x27;t like it because the gel is very viscous and hard to push out of the dispenser, but it&#x27;s ok since you don&#x27;t need to add much to your hard for it stay hard.  The price, I think, is very expensive; but if you don&#x27;t want your hair to flake (which I thought was just dust landing on my hair until a friend told me the gel was flaking), then get this Shorty Sexy Hair Gel.  I must admit, the brand name of this product made it seem like this was a fake product; luckily the reviews convinced me otherwise.</li>
    <li> I read the reviews and decided to try it even tho my cabinets are full of &#x27;tried&#x27; products for my hair.  I have fine hair and wear it very short.  This stuff works great.  I would not want to be without it.  It does not flake and with a little encouragement, works well the second day.</li>
    <li> Probably the best gel I have ever had. The gel is easy to use, apply and add some water and you get a nice look. Like the label says, for short hair, I don&#x27;t know how well it works for long hair, but seriously if you have long hair, use mousse or a different product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been searching for the right product since I was a young kid and finally I found this stuff! I&#x27;ve been a happy user for several years now and I must say that this is the best product I have ever used. It will never flake on you. It also holds its figure without being overwhelmingly stiff like most gels. This gel is similar to the axe products that are out right now but better because it gives better structure. It does have a light fragrance as well and not of the generic &#x27;gel smell&#x27; that most products have. The pump is extremely convenient and the best deal possible. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I am a guy, I use this gel everyday and works fantastically! Nice thick gel that doesn&#x27;t flake and washed out easily. I&#x27;ve already almost used up the whole bottle and I purchased it on July 10, 2014. So it lasted me a while and now I need to purchase another bottle!</li>
    <li> my hair looks so damn sexy i cant take it.</li>
    <li> This gel provides just the right amount of hold without making your hair hard and brittle. Keeps hair manageble and provides a flexible yet strong hold. It will not flake off onto your clothes and is easy to manipulate through wet or dry hair. My husband uses this gel right after he gets out of the shower when his hair is still wet. I work a small amount near my roots (when hair is damp) to add volume. I then finish off schrunching the product through my hair for definition and texture. It has a nice clean fragrance and is a fairly thick but very smooth gel. Happy with the versatility of this product.</li>
    <li> I was turned on to this stuff at the barber shop.  Have been using it ever since.  Amazing stuff.  Holds hair in place an looks totally natural.  A little goes a very long way.  Give it a try, you won&#x27;t be sorry.</li>
    <li> This stuff is too thick and goey to evenly distribute through your hair.  The product is closer to a glue than a gel.  It will clump your hair together making it look very unnatural.  The smell is also pretty strong and can be annoying after awhile if you don&#x27;t like it.  On the positive side, the hold is very strong and it doesn&#x27;t flake.  I can imagine that it would work exceptionally well for VERY SHORT hair (short spiking)where there isn&#x27;t a lot of hair to apply the stuff or longer styles but w/ intentionally stiff/slick back (imagine cheesy Steven Segal) style.  But for medium short hair (&gt; 3-4 inches), I think American Crew is better.  AC has a firm (although not as much as SSH), but more flexible hold that looks more natural, professional, and sophisticated.  Also, when AC gets scrunched out, your hair becomes soft, natural, w/o crunchiness, w/o flakes, but still maintains a flexible shape/hold with a more matte finish.  If you want a stronger hold for AC, then after styling, apply a freezing hairspray to lock in the hold.  Overall, SSH is just too thick and nonversatile but may be an excellent gel for the right style.  For me, it just didn&#x27;t work and I still prefer AC (although its not perfect either).</li>
    <li> This doesn&#x27;t Flake nor give you that itchy feeling. Holds up really well after hours.&lt;br /&gt;I have thick, curly hair, and usually 9/10 gel products never last or eventually flake (making it look like I have dandruff).&lt;br /&gt;I love this brand &amp; it smells great!&lt;br /&gt;Expensive to some extent, but definitely you get your money&#x27;s worth.</li>
    <li> My boyfriend loves this hair gel, but the salon he bought it from cost around $15 for the smaller version of this.  So I look it up on Amazon and found it with better price and bigger product.  The down side is that when the gel reaches the bottom, the pump is too short to dispense the it...what my bf did was just leave it upside down.  All in all, this is a great gel, it smells good, and it holds his hair no problem for 8+ hrs.  Will repurchase for sure :)</li>
    <li> holds great and all day and my hair still looks natural, first i was worried it wouldnt work well since it wasnt a spray but somehow i just do a few drops in various spots and it works out perfect, this bottle is probably going to last me an entire year...  excellent investment</li>
    <li> Great purchase. Will totally recommend.</li>
    <li> The gel is great. It&#x27;s very firm hold, and it&#x27;s a little too thick to apply on dry hair. But you can style damp dry hair with this gel very easily. If the hair is dry, I&#x27;d take a small portion (less than one full push of the pump) and dilute with a few drops of water in your palm before applying to the hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE: I added an image to this product description, depicting the broken bottle and how I re-bottled the gel. Squeeze bottle does not look too polished, but it actually allows me better control of how much gel to dispense, and if it gets clogged, I can always open the hole with a paper clip.</li>
    <li> This is great stuff - no flaking, great hold, and it even smells good.  Definitely a step up from what you can find at a supermarket or drug store.</li>
    <li> This is some of my favorite gel. I use a lot of different gels and this holds firm the entire time and the price isn&#x27;t too much.</li>
    <li> I just have to say that the reviews on this product were right. This is the best gel that I have found so far. I love gel and it has been a must in my hair for the past 15 years. The gel has the perfect thickness. Not too sticky, but not to wet. It has never flacked on me yet. The gel stays in your hair and lets you place your hair exactly how you want it, but it doesn&#x27;t get extremely hard. Weird you say, awesome i say!</li>
    <li> Just a dime of this gel on your already wet hair, and you&#x27;ve just become a movie star. I don&#x27;t think that I&#x27;ll ever use another brand of gel after this one. No more white flakes!</li>
    <li> I used all types of gel the cheap ones the really expensive ones. None are as god as the Short sexy Hair Gel. It smells great and is easy to use. It retains the firmness and no flakes. Depending on how much you sue it can tend to be heavy. Best of all the gel is easy to remove at the end of the day with both cold or warm water. It is slightly expensive as compared to other gels but it is definitely worth it because it has superior quality no matter how you use it.</li>
    <li> Seeing how there are almost 100 reviews with a 4.5/5 rating, I thought I&#x27;d give this product a try despite the price. Unfortunately, it didn&#x27;t work too well for me. My hair is a little under than an inch long and while it did hold my hair style in place, it failed to clump all the hair strands into bigger pieces of spikes. I guess you really must have hair shorter than 0.5\\&quot; to use this product. I&#x27;ve used this product with and without watered hair. It doesn&#x27;t make your hair shine either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If any of you guys are looking to seriously spike your hair (regardless of hair length), stick with Got2B Ultra Glued. Has more shine and actually holds your hair in place.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my son when he got his hair cut short and the beautician recommended this because of it&#x27;s strong hold and my son uses it everyday and loves it. It&#x27;s very pricey though but lasts quite a long time and it doesn&#x27;t make his hair feel all sticky like other products do. Would recommend to everyone who doesn&#x27;t want all that gunk in there hair.</li>
    <li> HELLO&lt;br /&gt;  AMAZON, i&#x27;m using this product from last 3 year&#x27;s but the product i got last time its not original ,it does&#x27;t smell like original one and really bad for hairs i also checked with couple salon shops they said the same thing. Im not happy at all amazon im losing my hairs because of this fake gell, i bought it because it was good deal 3 of them last time .i bought few things from you never had a issue before .</li>
    <li> The gel does its job. Great hold and shine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a 3 or 4 clip size on top. The smell of the gel is a little weird but the smell wont last that long once you have the gel on the hair. The gel is different from what its shown on the image, the one I got is 9 shine and 10 hold and it was sold directly from Amazon.</li>
    <li> This is the best gel out there.  I have short spikey hair and my hair stays in place all day and all night.</li>
    <li> I have used this for sometime.  To have found it in a large size, available w/ pre-ordered shipping-it is WONDERFUL!!! It lasts for all day and you don&#x27;t need to use much at all!!</li>
    <li> I stumbled upon this gel years back (my nephews gel)Later,my wife,being the see it buy it person she is ,found the tubes at her high priced salon and got me a couple .Just before running out I found these pump bottles on Amazon at an awesome price!! For those who don&#x27;t know this product is great for short hair and takes VERY little and has an unbelievable hold .The tubes or pump bottle last longer than you think making the price well worth it.Oh and also ,if somehow your hair does manage to mess up you dont get that residue or ashy hair like other gels leave plenty of.Again, I know to some this may seem a bit costly ,but I have had the 16.9oz for 7 months now and ,though I use it on a daily basis ,still have more than half left.</li>
    <li> i really like this product</li>
    <li> This gel works like no other. It gives the best hold, shine and value for your money. If you think the price is high as opposed to relative hair styling products out there, just remember a small squirt of this stuff goes along way. On average I use a 16.9oz bottle in a period of almost six months. You wont find this product for any cheaper any where else, so dont think about it to much and just become a subscriber. Great stuff!!!</li>
    <li> a little goes a long way. i made the mistake of using 2 pumps on my slicked back hair and i COULD NOT break my hair out of its slicked back state. Take your hands and rake it sideways to no avail. Rain/wind has no effect. I didnt know stuff like this existed and I am so excited to find it!</li>
    <li> Amazing hold! The best hair gel I have ever used. One minor drawback,  it takes a little longer to wash out but I don&#x27;t mind, it is worth a little extra effort. Another plus, it doesn&#x27;t leave residue so it doesn&#x27;t make your scalp flake or itch.</li>
    <li> You could go to a salon and get a tiny tube of this stuff for $18. OR you could buy it through Amazon and get a nice big tub of it that will last you for months at about the same price. I have very thick unmanageable hair, so I need a really strong gel. This stuff works. Sure, my hair is a bit stiff, but it&#x27;s better than frizzy &#x27;fro head.</li>
    <li> I like to have a wet look gel that does not lose it stiffness after a few hours. This stuff will stay rock solid all day! The only drawback is that it is a little difficult to wash out. It is nice to have a deep cleansing shampoo for this.</li>
    <li> Does what it says, and just a little bit goes a long way.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for over 10 years. Perfect for when you have a long day and your hair needs to stay up. Its one of the only hair gels that doesn&#x27;t give off an odor when applied to your hair, that I&#x27;ve found. Short Sexy Hair&#x27;s Hard Up Gel is the only hair gel I will ever use again.</li>
    <li> I ordered the 10 - 10 with the red lettering and got the 9 - 9, still a great hold and good product, disappointed that the company sent a different product than what was pictured.</li>
    <li> I recently bought two bottles of hard up only because i know you can&#x27;t find it in stores very often and when you do its usually double the price from what you see here. I highly recommend buying this product because it works with all types of hair, dry or wet and you don&#x27;t have to use half the bottle just to achieve the right look your looking for.</li>
    <li> Awesome product,price,seller!!!!A++++++</li>
    <li> I wear my hair short and spikey and have been using Short Sexy Hair Hard Up Gel for several years now.  I tried numerous other products, all of which I did not like for one reason or another but mainly because the majority of them made my hair feel dirty and/or greasy.  Then I found Short Sexy Hair Hard Up Gel and have used it ever since!  You can use it on wet or dry hair and it works great for short spikey hair!  Just a little goes a long way.  It puts a bit of shine to your hair, keeps it in place and is not hard and stiff like some other products.  The best part is that it rinses right out and leaves no residue!  I LOVE THIS STUFF!</li>
    <li> Good product for the price.</li>
    <li> This stuff works!  Will purchase again.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff I use it all the time</li>
    <li> My hair is short and extremely thick and fixing my hair has always been very difficult. Most products don&#x27;t come close to holding it in place. There was only one product that worked, but when it went off the market I had to find a new one. I stumbled upon this one and found it to be far superior to the previous gel.     When your hair is positioned the way you want it with this gel, it&#x27;s not going anywhere. You could stand outside in a hurricane and your hair would remain stationary, erect and defiant.</li>
    <li> This bottle of gel lasts a long time. If you use about 1 pump of the product daily, it will last you 4-6 month. The product is great because it does not leave any flakes in your hair and remains soft and moldable long enough for you to style your hair. It leaves a nice shiny, hard finish and is a great value.</li>
    <li> Twice as much for almost half the price. I am asked all the time how I get my son&#x27;s spiked hair to stay up all day and this is the answer. He is four and plays hard, but this gel keeps his hair spiked  all day long. His spikes are about 3.5 inches high.</li>
    <li> I picked this stuff up by chance a couple years ago and have used it ever since. Ive tried the cheap Fructis products and the more expensive JCrew pomades, Redken etc. I never could find something that worked. In addition to other gels, I found myself using hairspray with them. The HardUp gel by ShortSexyHair eliminates the need for multiple applications or hairspray and still leaves your hair looking the way you left it in the morning. I will never use another product. Oftentimes its hit or miss finding it at Walmart or CVS, so I checked Amazon and ill be purchasing through them for the nice price.</li>
    <li> I tried this to replace my usual hair gel ( which went up in price 300% )&lt;br /&gt;This holds very well and doesn&#x27;t wash out with rain, you need shampoo to get this out. A little goes a long way and I am very happy with this. Also doesn&#x27;t attract the bugs like my old plant based hair gel.</li>
    <li> I have been using this hair gel for a couple years now, and wouldn&#x27;t use anything else. Great holding power for my short hair. Can leave it looking wet, or blow it dry. This particular pump is even more awesome than the squeeze bottles, which will clog up with goo.</li>
    <li> Works great as far as hold. Comes in easy pump which makes for easy application. It smells delicious!  Great value for the price.</li>
    <li> I ordered this item for my teenage son (age 14).    After he received a haircut, the stylist put on this gel and by the end of the day his hair was still perfect and not flaky at all.    The price to buy in the salon was outrageous and for a much smaller tube size.  Luckily, I found a much bigger size on Amazon.    I really like the convenience of the pump.  Great product!</li>
    <li> Buy this home has been in a less him 4 to 3 months you&#x27;ll need need a little bit and it would last you all day long!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve purchased this product before and I&#x27;ll definitely purchase it again! I don&#x27;t believe it&#x27;s possible to beat this online price and the product works great too. For some crazy reason, I love the smell. I also love that it doesn&#x27;t make my hair flakey like some hair gel does.</li>
    <li> I have used this product in the past, after purchasing it at a salons and the pump feature always works great. This Gel product I have now purchased seemed to have a defect of some kind. The pump does not allow me to pump very high for the Gel to come out. And its a pain to keep using my fingers to try and lift the pump higher for the Gel to come out.Other than that the Gel is the same.</li>
    <li> Great hold without the shine. Doesn&#x27;t flake like other gels. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve gone through a lot of different gels over the last 30 years and this is my go to for the last 10 or so. I towel dry my hair, get a pump or two (depending if I need a haircut) add a tiny bit of water and mix it in my hands. It turns a bluish white at this point, but doesn&#x27;t stay that way. I leave it in my hair without drying it or anything. I like letting my hair do its own thing. If you pass your hand through your hair it doesn&#x27;t come out all sticky. If you want to release your hair just mess it up and it&#x27;s nice and soft. Love it!  They recently moved this stuff into a different line, but the model is still hard up. Their website has the details.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing.  Best hair gel in the market for sure.  Great product that works awesome, goes on easy, and washes out easy too.  HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!!</li>
    <li> I have very thick that can get unruly without a little help from some hair product. This is the only gel I&#x27;ve ever found to hold my hair with ease throughout the day and night. I highly reccomend this product.</li>
    <li> This gel is by far the best I ever tried (and believe me I tried tons of them, ranging from cheap Department store to saloon only brands. I do 14 hour shifts and when I&#x27;m done, I still have the same style I left my home with. Then, with regular shower the gel is washed away with no problems. It does not flake or irritate my scalp. I&#x27;ve been using it for the past few years and getting another batch.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for over 5 years now and absolutely love it.  I use it after I straighten my hair and works great all day!  I would highly recommend!</li>
    <li> This is a great product.  As for all of this stuff it is expensive and this seems to be the best way to get a good deal on it.</li>
    <li> Only takes a nickel size portion to spike my full head of hair. It even stays when I sweat or if I wear a hat. Does not dry your scalp out like other products.</li>
    <li> Good grief, I can&#x27;t believe how much I paid for this! It&#x27;s totally useless for me. Don&#x27;t use it on hair longer than 1/2 inch. My hair is about 4 inches long, which I consider short, and when I put it on my hair, it was a nightmare. It hardened like concrete and I couldn&#x27;t get a comb or brush through it without extreme pain. I brought the nightmare to an end by washing it out of my hair. Never again!</li>
    <li> Received by date promised and free shipping was a very cool bonus!  No problem at all. Will definitely order again.</li>
    <li> I have been using this gel for years now. I wouldn&#x27;t trade it for any other. It has superior hold without leaving dandruff and usage amount is minimal.</li>
    <li> same quality minus salon pricing.</li>
    <li> This is one long lasting gel that will turn your hair into a weapon. You think water or God can help you go back to your hair&#x27;s original state? Nope. This stuff is strong and it&#x27;s here to permanently hold your hair to look like the entire cast of society&#x27;s poop stain: Jersey Shore. If you don&#x27;t like to shower and want your hair to always look fresh, this is the product! Also great for styling your hair and pulling a prank on your friend that you&#x27;ve gone back to 2008!</li>
    <li> Wow i love this gel....best gel ever invented......i can put it on early in the morning around 7 am and when i wake up the next day my hair is still the same lol</li>
    <li> great product at a great price</li>
    <li> This is THE best hair gel out there.  Great hold, not oily or greasy.  Washes off your hands with no problems.  I have tried every gel out there and I keep coming back to this one.  I buy it here because it&#x27;s hard to find in stores.</li>
    <li> I have similar experiences to other reviewers. I have asian hair and require a gel with the strongest hold. I tried hundreds of products and found American Crew which was the best but still left flakes in my hair as it dried out. Then I found this product and it&#x27;s 10x better. It has the strongest hold even through rain, wind or after a really sweaty workout. When it dries, it doesn&#x27;t flake. It doesn&#x27;t leave my hand ultra sticky upon application and it smells really good.</li>
    <li> All of my local stores (in Las Vegas) have stopped selling this kind of gel for some reason. I think it&#x27;s wonderful (and I&#x27;m glad to have it fairly priced online.)    The gel keeps your hair in place thru the day, but doesn&#x27;t keep it real hard. (Which I like.)    It&#x27;s also easy to wash off your hands after applying it to your hair.</li>
    <li> As I was looking for a replacement gel for my American Crew Firm Hold (my gold standard so far), I came across something mildly curious -- a funny sounding gel with absurdly good reviews. People were raving about this product like it&#x27;s the best thing since sliced bread.  I ordered two 16.9oz bottles to see what the excitement was about, expecting a major disappointment.  I had very, -very- high expectations for this gel (given the price) and, needless to say, it has shattered all of them.  This is by far the best gel I have ever used.  PROS:  1) Holy JESUS. The bottle states \\&quot;hard up\\&quot; and they&#x27;re not exaggerating! My hair is thick and wavy and this stuff works great.  I am a critical care RN and even with getting in and out of isolation gowns (for infectious disease) my hair still stands straight up.    2) Amazon has it for subscribe n save in large amounts! Make sure you order the 16.9oz pump bottle using subscribe n save (then cancel if you don&#x27;t need a large bottle every 6 mo &#x3D;]   3) If used right after shower, hairy remains shiny for MANY hours after shower has ended! It makes you resemble \\&quot;just out of shower\\&quot; look.  CONS:  1) Expensive, but see neutral portion for details.  2) Sticky on hands! Must wash immediately!  3) Blue color?  4) POSSIBLE clogging of the pump bottle (see neutral)  5) Breakage of the bottle;  ****LONG TERM EDIT****  The other Amazon reviewer is true.  Beware of Pump Clogs and Breakage -   Great products and works for me as advertised but pump is highly vulnerable to clogging and if force is used to pump; crack, break, shatter, cut you!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!   Indeed, I did cut myself just doing this.  It seems to happen a lot more on cold bay area weather. Be very careful.  NEUTRAL:  1) Expensive? Certainly, Amazon&#x27;s price fluctuates between $20 and $25. The price is high, but a little goes a LONG way. My rule of thumb is one full press on the nozzle gives me enough for my medium length hair.  2) Clogging - mine hasn&#x27;t clogged yet, but I can see it happening.  What gel doesn&#x27;t clog though?  My American Crew Gel certainly did :)</li>
    <li> I purchased only because of the savings per ounce. Yes, the product still works wonderfully. But, the pump on this is terrible. I have to pump 25-30 times to get enough gel the size of dime! I will never order it again because of this. So, I opened once of the tubes and use the product out of there now.</li>
    <li> I started using this about two plus years ago due to high customer reviews it got on Amazon.  I have not been dissatisfied with the gel itself.  Very little to no smell, no flaking, and it has a great hold.  It is also a great value since I probably go through a 16.9 ounce bottle every six months instead of two-three weeks for regular sized gels at the grocery store.  I would normally give this product a perfect 5 star rating but only gave it 4 stars because of the container itself.  Previous containers had a twist off top where the whole top of the container opens up not just the pump section.  Great especially if you want to get the last drops of gel before you discard the bottle.  But with the last bottle I got one where the bottle only opens through the pump portion.  Definitely harder to access the last few drops.  So I can&#x27;t really stretch it out for that last month.  I would definitely mark this as a mild concern but the fact the pump broke and I can&#x27;t use the previous old pumps I keep for this purpose (I break things, it is my nature) kinds of annoys me.  I would still recommend this product.  Hopefully next order it returns to the original container.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[Update August 1, 2013] I still love this gel. Bumping up review to 5 stars since I realize my container complaint is a minor issue.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for the last 2 years and get so many compliments on my hair style.  So many people have asked what product I use and several have asked for the name of my stylist.  If your pump clogs just run warm water in your sink and let it soak for several hours.  Clears it right up.  I have ordered from Amazon the last two orders and only wish I had known to order from the start. Fast ship and the BEST price.</li>
    <li> I love this product! I always buy Short Sexy Hair online. Best buy for yor money. It holds well and doesn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling sticky. Product arrived in the time frame allotted.</li>
    <li> I have been trying different brands of gels for years, and I stumbled across this Gel at a CosmoProf and I never will go back to other brands, I love how it keeps your hair in place and it never comes loose, I recommend this to everyone, but one thing I noticed is some of the bottles I get are not completely filled to the top, just kinda wondering if I got some bad batches of the gel that were not filled all the way up.</li>
    <li> Worth the price many times over. I buy this because it doesn&#x27;t flake, its stays all day, and holds any type or length of hair.</li>
    <li> I should have paid attention to the ingredients.  But this gel contsins parabens.  For the price,  one would think they would have used something other than this cancer causing crap.</li>
    <li> super strong...feels gluelike lol not a bad thing.. really strong stuff and good shine to it. definitely a buy if you need a strong gel</li>
    <li> You get a solid amount of product for the price and its comes in pump form! It holds well and there&#x27;s no flaking. Great product!</li>
    <li> As a police officer my hair takes a bit of a beating with heat, weather, sweat, et cetera. This stuff is simply the best out there.     I&#x27;ve stood in rainstorms directing traffic and got back into my vehicle with no problems. It doesn&#x27;t break down over the course of a day and doesn&#x27;t start flaking like a lot of others which results making me look like I have some terrible dandruff.     If it gets wet again, touching my hair doesn&#x27;t leave my hands feeling sticky. I have a habit of running my hands over, or resting my hands on, my head and this stuff holds up to that as well.    I also like that I can control it fairly well. If I don&#x27;t want a bunch of spikes I simply dry my hair a little more before putting it on.    Now, if only I could find it somewhere other than Ulta so I don&#x27;t catch so much flak from the guys at work... or my girlfriend for that matter.</li>
    <li> I have been using hair gels for the past 20 years and I have gone thru countless stores to try to find the perfect gel. My hair is straight and thick, after my hair is washed and dried it looks like a Chia pet head, thick and soft. The gels that I would buy would sometimes not last long enough thru the day or be that strong holding, and sometimes I have to use so much as to make my hair look like I dipped it in a barrel of oil. With this gel I only need to use a nickle sized amount and my hair stays and looks good for about 15 hrs. This product also does not flake, like some other ones..trust me you will not regret using this.</li>
    <li> I have been using this gel for the past 3 years and it is awesome!  It holds extremely strong and it does not flake at all even when you wake up the next morning.  Plus if you don&#x27;t toss and turn you can wake up and your hair still has not moved which saves you money which you can use towards gas!  Wow!!!!!</li>
    <li> i purchase this gel for my husband.  Its the only gel that he can use that wont flake or dry out his scalp.  As well its long lasting which is 1 of his favorite things.  He has been using this product for over 10 yrs.  We highly recommend anyone to use it.  Yes the price is a bit on the high end but definitely worth every penny.  I only purchase gel every 1-1 1/2 yrs, so it definitely last long as well.</li>
    <li> I have used many hair gel products out there in the past.&lt;br /&gt;After using this product, there&#x27;s no more need to find anything else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Price is very reasonable too.</li>
    <li> Ive tried expensive products, but this is the best. Depending on how long I want my hair to stay in style, I apply the right amount. It&#x27;s super good, I can go on all day long without having to worry about my hair style.</li>
    <li> This is the best hair gel ever! It just takes me 30 seconds and I am done.  Spike it up and it looks great!</li>
    <li> Recommend highly, leaves no flakes and it holds very well in any situation. And you don&#x27;t need to use half of the bottle per use just one pump and go.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for over ten years;  I try new gels all the time, and have yet to find anything that can compare to this no fragrance, easily washed out preparation.  Great hold, no mess!</li>
    <li> I live in Las Vegas and I need a hair gel that can stand up to the intense heat we have here. This is the only brand I&#x27;ve found that can do that.</li>
    <li> This is a really good hair product for those with short hair. It holds up your hair just the way you want it to be. My hair doesn&#x27;t do good with those regular gels but this one surely does! If you want your hair style last long, try this. But one thing you should know it really gets \\&quot;Hard Up\\&quot; like its name when it&#x27;s dry.</li>
    <li> yuk!  I have a blonde pixie cut....this stuff is gooey and doesn&#x27;t do a thing for my hair.  just weighs it down.  won&#x27;t be using it.  will probably give it away if anyone wants it.</li>
    <li> Does Not Flake Or Turn White.  Only Need A Little Bit To Get The Job Done.  Nice To Be Able To Just Re Order When I get Low Instead Of Finding It In The Store And For A Lot More.</li>
    <li> This product works great but the pump problems mentioned in previous posts is real. Moreover, the hype is driving the maker to jack up the price to almost double to what I used to pay. If price does not come down I will look for alternative and cancel my Subscribe &amp; Save. Good product but too pricey!!!</li>
    <li> Great product. It does the job. I just started using it and it holds up my soft short grey hair.</li>
    <li> This stuff keeps my out-of-control hair in check!</li>
    <li> My hair is just past shoulder length, layered and worn curly 100% of the time.  This is the perfect product to keep it looking great.  With just the right amount of product, the hold is strong without too much &amp;#34;crunchiness&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Awesome product great price fast shipping could not be happier! This is by far the best hair product I have found for my hair! Thanks</li>
    <li> This is the best stuff and at a good price on Amazon.  Love it!</li>
    <li> Three times cheaper than buying the product in a salon.  Product works great, lasts all day.</li>
    <li> With  thin, wispy, short hair, I have wasted a lot of money on hair products.   Hard Up gel works better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried. It&#x27;s not sticky and doesn&#x27;t make your head feel itchy. Your hair doesn&#x27;t blow around, but it&#x27;s not stiff like a helmet, either. Rub a little on your hands, rub it through your hair, and you get body and style that lasts. Problem solved!  I&#x27;m also ordering a small tube for travel.</li>
    <li> Hold hair like non other, you can wake up the next morning looking like you did before bed</li>
    <li> Tried this after KMS changed to their new stinky formula. Thank you KMS for forcing me to see what else is out there. I&#x27;ve used KMS hair gel for approximately 10 years and have never found another gel to come close to it until now. This is stronger, smells better and because its so strong I use a lot less of it. Great product!</li>
    <li> Gel holds hair well looks sexy and feels like it nourishes my hair. Love it on my hair! Sexy feeling</li>
    <li> I have been using this gel for over 5 years. Love it and this is only one I can use. It has hard hold and doesnt flake at all (which is very important for me). Amazon sells it for the best price I came across so far.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;VE USED THE GEL FOR YEARS!!! I&#x27;VE TRIED OTHERS-GAVE EM AWAY! I ALWAYS COME BACK TO HARD UP GEL!!! IT&#x27;S WORTH EVERY PENNY AND IT KEEPS YOUR HAIR IN PLACE. YOU CAN REVIVE YOUR HAIR BY JUST DAMPENING A  LITTLE AND RESTYLING!!! IT WORKS!!!</li>
    <li> This is a really stiff hair gel.  It will hold as long as you want it to and it smells pretty good.  It may leave your hair a little crunchy though.  I have found you can get around the crunchy feel if you just comb/brush your hair while it dries.  The pump is also a nice feature as it helps make the product last longer.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing! Extremely long lasting, workable gel. Does not immediately freeze, so you have time to play with the style. Once it sets, you are set until you wash it out. Very long lasting power and resists rain and wind! Received brand new LARGE pump bottle in excellent condition. This one&#x27;s a keeper! I put it on auto ship for my husband so we&#x27;ll always have this in stock. Do the same!!</li>
    <li> I have used this Gel for years.  I highly recommend it.  I had switched from American Crew to this, and this one holds up much better, especially for the long haul.  Use it with wet hair to get and keep the wet look, or use it on dry hair to avoid the wet look.  The pump size is the best deal for the money, and the pump works pretty well till the very end.</li>
    <li> Extremely strong hold. Coming from no product, maybe TOO strong! :) Easy to use packaging.&lt;br /&gt;In case you&#x27;re wondering, no, the blue does not show up in your hair.</li>
    <li> Works as advertised. Just what I wanted for my short and thinning hair. And the price is reasonable compared to other products I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> Awesome product!! I have been buying this from the salon but not anymore. This is a huge container but the pump get clogged up very easily. Overall a great price for the amount.</li>
    <li> I have used this gel since Dec 204. It does work; however, be careful because it will make your hair (particularly if it is white or grey) look blue. The way around this problem is to dilute very small amounts of it in water before application. I gave it a two star because there is no reason why the manufacturer should add blue dye. to it.</li>
    <li> My husband loves this product.  It does not cause white flakes or leave a visible residue.  I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Good stuff; does not turn flaky as day goes on.  I have poker straight hair and this stuff keeps it in place all day.</li>
    <li> I have very thick hair so to get any hairstyle to hold in place I need something with strength. I like this fell because:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t flake&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down&lt;br /&gt;Hold incredibly well!&lt;br /&gt;Easy to wash out of your hair in the shower&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t leave excess gunk or damage your hair</li>
    <li> if you are looking for a strong hold for an entire day, this is a great product.  try not to douche it up too much.</li>
    <li> American Crew seemed to be getting the best ratings here on Amazon, so I bought a small bottle of it only to find out it doesn&#x27;t spike up short coarse thick hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using American Crew three times, I bought Style Sexy Hair and liked it much better. It leaves a nice natural texture and holds great all day. The only draw back compared to American Crew is, American Crew smells amazing. This stuff smells a little fruity, but it&#x27;s not too bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy this.</li>
    <li> Sext Hair Hard Up Gel, where have you been my whole life?! MY GOD is this stuff incredible. I have really weird semi-curly frizzy hair that looks crappy unless it is scrunched within an inch of its like... so it looks great for 20 minutes or so after I do it but as soon as the humidity hits it, everything goes to crap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not any more. Not with Sexy Hair Hard Up Gel. I used it for the first time last night - a hot, humid night full of Forth of July festivities. My hair looked exactly the same as it did at 2am after drinking for 8 hours in the humidity as it did when I left my house sober. It was the ultimate expression of pure &#x27;Murican freedom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I woke up this morning and, quite honestly, if it weren&#x27;t for the streaks of make up smeared all over my hung over face, I&#x27;d be totally fine with going out in public without taking a shower... my hair still looks great! It isn&#x27;t flakey or dry or frizzy. It really is a miracle!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The gel itself was a bit sticky going on and I had to scrunch pretty fast because it dried quicker than I had anticipated. I probably could use a lot less than I did but I didn&#x27;t know the awesome power I held in my hands during my first application. I would HIGHLY recommend this to anyone with curly hair who likes the scrunched look. In all seriousness, it is the best hair product I have EVER used and I go through a lot. I&#x27;ve probably tried hundreds of different kinds, trying to find something that works... I don&#x27;t have to look anymore with this stuff.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing. An an excellent price for the huge pump. Guaranteed to last for many months. Great price and fast shipping.</li>
    <li> Great product and good price.</li>
    <li> This is the best gel at the best price. Almost the same price as buying a small tube from CVS or Walgreens. It lasts pretty much all day and doesn&#x27;t flake. I have nothing bad to say about it.</li>
    <li> My son uses this stuff everyday!</li>
    <li> If you want gel that will keep your hair in 1 place all day (and the next) then get this gel.  Its more expensive, but it&#x27;s sooo worth it. My aunt, whos a stylist, gave me a bottle of this and ive been using it for the last 2 years and just now ran out. Be warned, it is hard up and if you want a soft flowey hair style then this certainly is not for you.</li>
    <li> My boyfriend uses this stuff everyday and won&#x27;t go without it.  He has very curly dry hair and he loves this product.  He thinks it helps to keep his hair manageable.  I think its a little pricey but he says its worth the price.</li>
    <li> Love, love, love this product.  Especially love the packaging as the tube allows the gel to escape and is too messy.  I also like this the fact that I can twist the top to close off the pump...great for traveling.</li>
    <li> This does the job of holding my hair in place all day long. All I need is just one pump from it and that&#x27;s it.</li>
    <li> The gel is very strong, holds most of the day, and rarely flakes.  The only issue I have with this particular product is that the straw part of the pump does not go all the way to the bottom which means that it will not get all of the gel out of the container.  Otherwise, I have been using this for some time and love it since it works much better, in my opinion, than some of the very expensive gels that I have used in the past.</li>
    <li> my son loves this &amp; I get double for the money &amp; it is twice the size of the grocery store.  now my other son wants a bottle....... I need to order again as they use it a lot!!!!</li>
    <li> I am a long time user of &amp;#34;Short Sex Hair&amp;#34;. I ordered it twice and both times got this product,. It is not the same. I have short spiky hair and this product does not do the trick.</li>
    <li> Holds your hair all day and hair looks great! Simply one of the best gel products available!!!  A must buy!</li>
    <li> I use very little of this, it has a strong hold and will last me forever</li>
    <li> I have used this for a long time. Much cheaper online than at the salon! I will and have bought more.</li>
    <li> My husband will not buy any other brand. He has tried so many others and they just don&#x27;t compare! The hold is amazing!!!</li>
    <li> I have used this product previously in the tube and loved it.&lt;br /&gt;After asking a question regarding the pump version I got many very positive responses so I ordered it.&lt;br /&gt;Have only used a few times but works great and you have more control over how much product you want to use.&lt;br /&gt;Would suggest to friends!!</li>
    <li> As always works as it should, will buy again.</li>
    <li> Hair gell works as good as what is pictured, but was shipped a slightly different &amp;#34;model.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What was shipped was titled &amp;#34;Style Sexy Hair&amp;#34;, same brand &amp;#34;Hard Up&amp;#34;, but the level was slightly different, it was 9 - shine, 10 - hold. Whereas Short Sexy Hair is 9, 9, like pictured.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, the gel seemed to act the same, same color, same quality, but beware you may get a different model.</li>
    <li> unfortunately, this stuff did nothing for my hair. It made it flaky and itchy so I will not be using this stuff again.</li>
    <li> This is the only gel I&#x27;ve been able to find that holds really, really well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If applied lightly and rubbed between your hands to make it more of a pomade texture than a gel it goes on pretty light without being wet looking on your hair all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can even get in a nap and not have to re-do the hair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does OK getting wet when it rains; as long as it&#x27;s not soaked it will dry again and hold the style.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t have too much of a smell, unlike most, and the smell goes away once it dries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Washes out really easily and cleanly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, best gel on the market. Wish I could find an organic/natural gel that works this well; this is about the last thing in my medicine cabinet full of gnarly chemicals. But when it comes to hair, sometimes you have to sacrifice I suppose...</li>
    <li> I bought this gel for my sons and they love it. My daughter will also use it when she needs to keep her hair back for dancing and it holds all day long.</li>
    <li> I have been using this gel off and on for years. I was previously purchasing it from my barbershop, but it is cheaper on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is think and curly, but I usually keep it on the shorter side. Without gel my hair is dense and puffy. I like to throw gel in it to keep it down and look somewhat human. This gel can definitely handle that task and handle it well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Compared to other gels that you can purchase at local chain stores, this gel is not &amp;#34;glue&amp;#34; like and heavy. It does not clump your hair together and make it look like you just starred in Something About Mary. You don&#x27;t need a ton of this to wrangle your hair, just a small amount goes a long way. It evenly distributes through your hair and doesn&#x27;t move once dry. It rinses very easily with just water and leaves your hair feeling normal (unlike other &amp;#34;glue&amp;#34; like gels).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now that I know I can get it through Prime for less than my barber, I will be using it 100% of the time. Awesome stuff!!</li>
    <li> This product is gooey but once it dries, holds your hair like no other product out there. You don&#x27;t have to use much of it. I have thick, course hair so it&#x27;s perfect for me. I can style and it holds in place. Unlike other products, it doesn&#x27;t dry and gets flaky.</li>
    <li> Great gel - holds great - good value amount too</li>
    <li> BEST hair gel on the market today!    FREE shipping on this purchase a BIG plus, especially to Hawaii.  However, method of shipping (e.g., USPS, FedEx, UPS) should be provided.  I&#x27;ve suggested and requested for the method of shipping but have yet to get a response.</li>
    <li> My husband has thick coarse hair, this is the strongest hair gel he&#x27;s used.  Just make sure to keep wipe off any excess because it dries into a solid that&#x27;s tough it remove.  Strong stuff.</li>
    <li> The  best hair gel on the market!</li>
    <li> Great product! Speedy delivery!</li>
    <li> amazing deal for a great holding gel. stays hard all day even under the craziest conditions.</li>
    <li> Good amount for the price</li>
    <li> Pros: Easy to apply, isn&#x27;t too sticky, keeps short hair spikey without looking like you put glue on your head. The smell is pleasant and not overbearing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: None&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other notes: The last shipment I received had a different name on the outside. I had to look it up on the manufacturer&#x27;s website. It looks like they may be changing the marketing for this product and calling it by a different name. It works, feels, and smells the same as before though.</li>
    <li> absolutely love this product</li>
    <li> Ive been purchasing this hair gel for years.  People always ask me what kind of gel i use to get my hair to stand up and be as spikey as it is.  Ive tried dozens of other gels and most arent even close to the quality of this kind</li>
    <li> I was so excited to get this product. I did get the &amp;#34;Short sexy hair&amp;#34; version not the &amp;#34;Style sexy hair&amp;#34; version that others have mentioned (though as I&#x27;m doing this review I notice that the picture next to it says &amp;#34;stylesexyhair&amp;#34;). Confusing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, to review this product. I read the directions and decided to put it on my dry hair to style it. Mistake, the goo turned almost rubbery and even though it held my spiked hair the way it wanted it to look ... I didn&#x27;t like the way my hair felt and the rubber cement feeling by my scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried it again after my shower and watered it down in my hand with a little water and then dried my hair. Much better, the rubbery feeling was gone, but the spiky look was also gone. So I used the SSH Play Dirty and got the spike back. I was trying to get something to replace the Play Dirty because it didn&#x27;t hold all day long. The combination of both of them seems to work well, but I would prefer to use less product, hence the jury is still out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a little disappointed with this product since short sexy hair has been my go to hair solution for years and this just didn&#x27;t seem to live up to the quality I&#x27;ve come to expect from this manufacturer.</li>
    <li> This gel works really well. I have been using this brand for a few years now and will never stop as long as I have hair!</li>
    <li> It is a great price for this product, definitely worth it. Will be buying this product again in the future.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for 6 yrs and buying it from my hair salon, however, the price continued to increase.  I decided to \\&quot;google Short Sexy Hair\\&quot; to see what happened.  Low and behold I was led to Amazon and I could buy the product at a cheaper rate with free shipping if I setup to have the product sent automatically whenever I so desired.  This I did on the first purchase and am very satisfied.</li>
    <li> I love this gel, and I always reorder it, well this time it said free shipping, and that is not true at all.  The package came to my house when I wasn&#x27;t home and usps left a message saying that I owed for postage.  This is a lie, don&#x27;t tell people they will get free shipping, when you are just going to charge them for postage in a different way.</li>
    <li> Best gel out there. Lasts all day</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried other products for spiking up my hair and this still is the best for the money. I&#x27;ve used this product for over 10 years.</li>
    <li> So fresh &amp; so clean!!!</li>
    <li> 16 yr. old grandson swears by this stuff.</li>
    <li> The best hair gel a man or woman buy hands down.</li>
    <li> dries quickly but if you can just wet your hair a bit and you can work on it again.</li>
    <li> Works great with my hair type.  I wish the pump can empty the tub.  It always leaves a good amount in the bottom.</li>
    <li> gets the job done every time I use it and never complains. What more can you ask for? Def Couldn&#x27;t say the same about my ex girlfriend</li>
    <li> SEXY!!!!!!  It really made my hair show through.</li>
    <li> I once read reviews commenting on how great this product is. I read that you could take a nap with it and wake up with your hair looking exactly the same as it looked before you took the nap. Not that I take naps, but sounded like it could be a decent product. So, I decided to buy it, however, with the typical skepticism most have when buying an unknown product. I have to admit that the comments I read were right. This is a great product and your hair will look great the entire day, regardless of how active you are. It deserves five stars!</li>
    <li> Husband has short, semi spikey hair and he really likes this product. Has been using it for several years now and has no desire to try anything else. Really does hold ALL DAY. :)</li>
    <li> Works great on my short hair and very fine hair.</li>
    <li> First time I will say that the hold is too firm</li>
    <li> First thing straight of the bat it smells great. Two pumps of it and thats all i need wet or dry nice hold on the hair as well.</li>
    <li> I love this product when I first get my hair cut, which by the way I wear short. It has great hold and I can get that spiky look if I want. It holds all day. This is a large size container and it last a long time. This is a very good value.</li>
    <li> hands down, this is the best stuff if you spike your hair.. I use it everyday, no flake..hold all day long. go to sleep, wet your hands and rub your hair...presto re-activated. now of course I have thick full head of hair...not sure how it would work on bald guys. the only thing that stinks is the dispenser nozzle is too short, so getting it out of bottle is cumbersome</li>
    <li> It has the Best hold and does not dry white (like the glue type hair gel). You would not be disapointed.</li>
    <li> Great hair gel.  I need more now.</li>
    <li> Best gel I&#x27;ve used. Love it</li>
    <li> I have thick and coarse hair, which I wear as short as possible. One pump of this gel was all I needed to get my hair up and spiky. The surprising bonus is I don&#x27;t feel like I have a ton of crap weighing my hair down. Outstanding product!</li>
    <li> Hard Up lives up to its name. It gives a grip to the finest limp hair. I have used an extensive line of gels and powders and this is by far the Best!</li>
    <li> Not what I thought it was.  Smell is not good. Does not hold all day either. Will probably last longer than I live.</li>
    <li> This gel has kind of a girly smell to it but that&#x27;s not a bad thing completely, the gel is like concrete though, they weren&#x27;t kidding when they said hold was 10/10, it&#x27;s amazing for me!</li>
    <li> Dries fast and makes my hair look great. Smells great too.</li>
    <li> Great product fast shipping</li>
    <li> Very good gel if you need a iron strong hold. No joke this stuff can withstand anything, wind, storms, sleep, literally the next day put a little water in and it reactivates. If you don&#x27;t have a hair style that requires such a strong hold there are better options as this is a little too strong at times. All in all a great product if it is what you need. I changed hairstyles so no longer require such a strong hold. Oh ya, you only have to use very little as well so really this stuff lasts forever!</li>
    <li> This hair gel always comes through.  It has a super strong hold and doesn&#x27;t break down or get greasy like cheaper gels do.  Been using it for years.  It&#x27;s worth the cost.</li>
    <li> I got it on time and a good condition. And it was really cheap. I definitely recommend this product. I&#x27;m deafening buy more next time.</li>
    <li> Holds better than anything else I have ever found.  No flaking, smells good....perfect</li>
    <li> This stuff is quite simply the best.</li>
    <li> this hair gel rocks. for short hair, for business cut hair is all good. lasts for as long as you want it to last. i have been to many hair salons but none of those gels they use compares to this one. this gel means business not messing around.</li>
    <li> This is the best hair gel for short hair.  This bottle will last me for several years and the pump is better than taking the top off of the small bottle that I am almost finished with.</li>
    <li> After trying about every product on the market, this is the only one that has a very strong hold and does not flake.  The true test is wearing black -- even a day or two later, not a flake in sight.&lt;br /&gt;Amazon has the absolute best pricing on this great product, and I only purchase from here!</li>
    <li> definitely the best hair &amp;#34;gel&amp;#34; out there. i only use this when my hair is really short to spike it. otherwise i use a fiber putty. no flaking at all and gives the hair a great shine compared to other products. lasts easily ALL DAY.</li>
    <li> Best holding gel I have in my possession.&lt;br /&gt;my hair getting wet doesn&#x27;t mess things up as bad as when I use other hair products.&lt;br /&gt;I can get different hair textures depending on whether I put the product in when my hair is wet or dry.&lt;br /&gt;Just experiment with it.&lt;br /&gt;put more. put less. put on wet hair. put on dry hair.&lt;br /&gt;spike hair. spread throughout hair, etc.&lt;br /&gt;Def has great hold.&lt;br /&gt;says &amp;#34;shine&amp;#34; on it, but my hair isn&#x27;t dagnabit shining like the heavenlies... I don&#x27;t notice a shininess in the way I apply it.</li>
    <li> the best quick and cheapest i&#x27;ve found</li>
    <li> I mainly and have been buying this product for my now, 20yr old son.  He&#x27;s been using this since high school and according to him, IS the best, \\&quot;nicely firm\\&quot;, type gel around.  Sooo I&#x27;m gonna take his word for it. :)  Again, this short review is based on what my son tells me.  He definitely loves it.</li>
    <li> Been using over a decade now and no reason to look elsewhere for better when there isn&#x27;t any. Gives a strong hold without the flaky, strong perfume odor of others.</li>
    <li> Beware - I ordered this gel and instead of receiving the product described, I got a knock-off called &amp;#34;Style Sexy Hair&amp;#34;  The color of the gel, the fonts on the bottle, the description, the ingredients all look identical to the one pictured.  However, the name has been changed to Style Sexy Hair, with Style and Hair in a Red Font.  Buyer Beware!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The actual Short Sexy Hair product itself is awesome...but this retailer is shady.</li>
    <li> My favorite hair product!  It produces consistent results.  If the product starts to be too thick - can be watered down just a bit.</li>
    <li> The product itself is great.  The packaging is not worth the value.  The pump is ineffective as it clogs easily and hardens to a point where you are no longer able to use it.  I ended up having to cut the packaging open and use another container.  While the gel is great, the packaging does not make it worth buying.  Too frustrating to use.</li>
    <li> i only use sexy hair for my short hair and i love it. You must buy this for this great price.</li>
    <li> I got the products on time and at good price.</li>
    <li> Only a small amount is necessary for all-day hold.  Dries without flaking.  Pump is very convenient.  Best gel I&#x27;ve found for shorter hairstyles.</li>
    <li> Do NOT like this product...Someone recommended Sexy Gel claiming how great it is. But I don&#x27;t like the consistancy of it...If you use it be careful not to over use...it will leave your hair feeling clumped &amp; very hard &amp; damaging to comg it out.</li>
    <li> The best hair gel I&#x27;ve ever used.. It keeps my hair in place all day..</li>
    <li> This stuff makes my hair rock hard. The wife thinks its weird and the kids think its funny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only gets 4 stars because it&#x27;s hard to get all of it out of the bottom when it gets close to empty.</li>
    <li> Only stuff that hold my damn hair in place all day.  Washes out easy too</li>
    <li> makes your scalp nasty, but does keep a good hold. Dries up in tube dispenser quickly.</li>
    <li> This is by far the best hair gel i have ever used.  I style my hair pretty much everyday for work.  you do not need a lot of this stuff to make your hair the way you want it and worrying about it moving throughout the day.  Comes out easily at the end of the day just using water.</li>
    <li> The best for thick and abundant hair</li>
    <li> The best hair gel I ever used. Been using it for years. Works great. Will hold all day long with a good shine to it.</li>
    <li> Amazing hold for Asian coarse hair.  I rarely have to reapply gel.  I love this product and hope it&#x27;s always available.  I would purchase this by the case.</li>
    <li> best gel ever! I have ordered it numerous times!</li>
    <li> Works great!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t matter what your doing,  Gel does not run off down to your face.  It holds all day.</li>
    <li> Love this Gel Love the Packaging Love the Pump. I will Always buy this.</li>
    <li> Best gel ever. Fast delivery and best priced.</li>
    <li> arrived promptly and as promised</li>
    <li> You want hard gel? go for it!</li>
    <li> Everything it said it was. The same stuff that you pay twice as&lt;br /&gt;Much for in the store. I bought two so I could get the free shipping. All in all I will buy again when I run low cause I use this daily</li>
    <li> Came quick, works amazing and for the size of this bottle which is bigger than anything in the stores it&#x27;s a outstanding price!</li>
    <li> fast delivery, good product. I would buy from seller again. Cheaper to buy bulk, than in hair salons. Been using this product for years, in fact it&#x27;s the only thing I use.</li>
    <li> I ordered Short Sexy Hair just as shown in the picture. But received &amp;#34;Style Sexy Hair&amp;#34; it is nowhere close to Short Sexy.&lt;br /&gt;FRAUD...! Cheat! 1 Star is too much for this product. Amazon - Either ask to change the picture or kick out the Beauty Depot from your market place.</li>
    <li> Great Gel.Does not leave white residue, even after sleeping with it. A little gel goes a long way. I definitely recommend this gel.</li>
    <li> Great...Value for money</li>
    <li> Great for short hair style&#x27;s.I&#x27;m a hairdresser and it&#x27;s what I recommend to all my guy&#x27;s that want that wet look and smell&#x27;s great too.</li>
    <li> If you are looking for a VERY strong hold that will allow you to spike even the thickest, coarsest hair, this is your stuff.  Applied to wet hair and allowed to dry naturally gets you a very wet look.    Drawbacks:  very stiff, dries VERY fast so you&#x27;d better work quickly, lots of crunch that does not \\&quot;scrunch\\&quot; out.    Pluses:  No humidity (even rain) or sweat will touch this stuff.  It stays put until you wash it out.  But it does wash out easily.</li>
    <li> You guys should update the pic...what you see in the pic its not the same one so i m kind of upset...becoz they changed the package a year ago but you guys still using the old version pic of it...if i knew this will happen to me i never order it in a first place</li>
    <li> I have been using this gel since I was in High School.  It is the best gel for keeping your hair in place all day long.  It hardens, but  doesn&#x27;t look bad.  Excellent product.</li>
    <li> This is wonderful stuff. The only thing I found to hold my thick hair!!</li>
    <li> The gel holds strong and doesnt feel too bad. Use a little for help or a lot to stick. This is a really great product for short hair, a must.</li>
    <li> You can control your hair whichever way you want. This dries hard. Its like elmers glue. No flaking. My favorite gel.</li>
    <li> This is the best hair gel ever! This goes in dry hair. This goes in wet hair. I have normal length office friendly hair length and this gives it a ton of style. It hold all day long even in hot and sweaty heat, and you only need 1, maybe 1 1/2 squirts each time. I will be buying only this gel from now on!</li>
    <li> The same product that is sold at the local hair salon for at least double the price! This is a great deal!!!</li>
    <li> you are not going to get a better deal than this and this stuff works great, no flaking, holds tight! love it</li>
    <li> I discovered this when I was getting my hair cut and the hair stylist used it on my hair after she was done cutting it and I loved i since then! It definitely keeps your hair in place all day, even at night if you leave it in. It also makes my hair look great, great quality for the hair, makes it shine also!</li>
    <li> No issues fast service</li>
    <li> All the things the positive reviews say are true:  a little goes a long way, it has a strong hold that lasts well into the second day depending on various factors, and it works equally well for wet or dry looking styles.  The thing most people neglect to mention about it is that it also gives the hair a great shine which is especially nice for the dry looking styles. I wash my hair, towel dry it, apply about an almond-sized dollop to the palms of my hands, rub them together until the gel turns white, then apply  the gel evenly to my damp hair.  I comb it into place, dry the excess moisture with a hair dryer, then use a Fuller brush judiciously to refine the shape and make the style look softer and dryer. Even after all that, my hair has a great shine and a great, long-lasting hold.  Sound like an advertisement?  Well, this is not an ad, but I do like this stuff a lot.  The use of this styling gel is habit-forming.  I highly recommend it in the economy (pump) size.  Sometimes the name on the bottle varies a bit, (Style Sexy Hair Hard Up Gel shine 9 hold 10 vs. Short Sexy Hair Hard Up Gel shine 9 hold 9), but it seems to be the same stuff.</li>
    <li> Smells nice and stays hard all day long</li>
    <li> I would really recommend this product its of great quality.If you want a great textured hair style this is the gel to use.</li>
    <li> I have used this for years and highly recommend it. Love this stuff as it keeps my short spiked hairdo in place.</li>
    <li> The best for all day hold even in wind</li>
    <li> I have used this hair gel for several years. I put it on wet hair and blow dry. Depending on the amount used I can get a very hard set. I have no problems with white flakes, as many cheap gels do. I also do not get sticky fingers after touching my hair when it&#x27;s dry. The pump is awesome, as I can dispense with one hand and avoid getting the outside of the container sticky while I still have gel on my hands. This is also a very good price for the amount. I was paying almost double for the same amount of gel at a salon.</li>
    <li> I think this would be great for very short hair.  I have short hair, but not short enough.  I would like to see how this works on short spiky hair.  When you hair is a little longer it gets too sticky and hard to manage, you have to apply as quickly as possible and not brush, but pick quickly to style.  Again, would be great for Very Short Hair.</li>
    <li> I like this product a lot because I can shape my hair to spikes and it stays put, it doesn&#x27;t leave any white or dirty looking flakes on your hair like most hair gels do. the only thing is I don&#x27;t like feeling my hair once I have put it on, it feels like a porcupine died up there. And the gel itself is very gooey on your hands, so no, you can&#x27;t just wipe it off on your clothes when you&#x27;re done with your hair.</li>
    <li> My husband loves this product because it holds the hair in place and also it doesn&#x27;t make any flakes great price for the bargain .</li>
    <li> This is as far the best hair gelI have tried...I have tried many of them &amp; they always leave your hair with white flakes.  This gel will not do that &amp; it is strong.</li>
    <li> Best hair gel I have used!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried many of the products in the hair aisle.  They would do the job, but most times fell flat (hehe).  I would have to use the competitors gel plus hair spray to keep my hair stationary the entire day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With this gel, I use about a quarter size of product and work into my hair and it stays all day with nothing else.  I also like the smell as it is not over powering, but just a clean smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only complaint that I have is the end of the spout gets clumped up.  Just clean that off every now and again and it will not happen.</li>
    <li> Awesome!! My son has thick hair and this is the only stuff that work. He can now sport is Fo-hawk all day long...</li>
    <li> I have been using this for a long time now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A little goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;Holds well, without making hair stiff/crispy. Somewhat flexible.&lt;br /&gt;Not sticky in hair.&lt;br /&gt;Easily washes off hands &amp; out of hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good price in this size, here on Amazon, especially compared to salons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I PREFER THE SQUEEZE TUBES, but they do not come in this size. I&#x27;d give 5 stars if it did.&lt;br /&gt;The pump does not get all of the gel out when it&#x27;s low and worst of all the gel dries in the pump tip and then squirts out really hard and far in some random direction when you pump it, unless you dig out the tip.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if this is exactly the same formula as the one that you get from the salon but I can&#x27;t tell the difference (as the price difference is big). I&#x27;ve been buying this brand for over 6 years and haven&#x27;t found anything else that will tame my coarse Asian hair. I have thick black hair that I do a fohawk fade. Applying the gel is easy as it dries fast and only takes a small amount compared to other brands I used prior to this. This gel holds it for the whole day (as long as it doesn&#x27;t get wet) and it&#x27;s hard like a rock. I could probably poke someone&#x27;s eye out like a rhino (with my hair) if I wanted to. If you want a gel with a firm hold, this is the right gel for you. The only down side that isn&#x27;t one for me as I&#x27;m used to it is that the gel in the dispenser tip does build up so once in a while you may have a back up. Other than that the product itself is awesome!</li>
    <li> Only hair gel anywhere that keeps hair looking and smelling great, it does not flake.</li>
    <li> This does the job of holding my hair in place all day long.  All I need is just one pump from it and that&#x27;s it.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t usually write reviews about how good a product is unless I REALLY love it.. I must say that his is perhaps the best gel I have used in my life, it is so strong and the quality is top notch. You will love it.</li>
    <li> Love this gel! It&#x27;s VERY good, just the way I like to keep my hair - in place and hard.</li>
    <li> FANTASTIC hold!!! LOVE it! It is a wonderful product used on wet or dry hair. I don&#x27;t use anything else.</li>
    <li> Its a little too hard for long hair being slicked back.  This product is best suited for people with short hair that want to spike it or have extreme hairstyles.  I have long hair and pull my hair back for work, the hold was so strong that it was breaking my hair every time I put my hat on.  The hold is ridiculous (which is great for a spiky look, but bad for wearing a hat on top). Its a great product, just not made for my needs.</li>
    <li> It holds your hair in place all day.  It is well worth the money and the product is excellent for flat-tops or other styles.</li>
    <li> Awesome hair gel. Keeps my boys hair styled all day and then some. Try it, you won&#x27;t be sorry :)</li>
    <li> Its a knock off of short sexy hair gel but it works</li>
    <li> Globs up in your hair and is very difficult to comb out, even if you try to change it by mixing it with something creamier.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a long time Sebastian Hair Gel user and when Sebastian no longer made hair gel, I did a lot of research and I found Sexy Hair on Amazon.  If Sebastian has a score 10 of 10, then this is like an 8.  Here&#x27;s my review: I love it, I love it , I love it.  This is my 2nd bottle from Amazon.  One bottle lasts me a long time.  It doesn&#x27;t show flake on your hair.  It holds your hair for at least 12hours and it will wash right off.  I work 12hour shift as a nurse and this gel holds up very well.  The pump bottle is a bad design for this type of thick gel.  Overtime the gel will dry up inside the pump tip and get clogged.  I personally don&#x27;t use the pump, I pour the gel into a jar with wide opening for easy access.  Its so much easier to use than the pump bottle.</li>
    <li> Still the best product I have used to spike my hair up!</li>
    <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-last a LONG time (applied in the morning, will maintain some shape into the next morning if you don&#x27;t take a shower)&lt;br /&gt;-convenient bottle has a low profile so you don&#x27;t knock it over&lt;br /&gt;-pump dispenser is very convenient as well&lt;br /&gt;-neutral smell&lt;br /&gt;-looks nice and bright on the shelf&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-none so far&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conclusion:&lt;br /&gt;-Good go-to hair gel for most purposes, lasts a long time, convenient in daily use</li>
    <li> I have used this gel for the past 5 years and it is great for short styles. my hair is generally 1/2 to 2 inches long and is quite thick, and this is the exact product I&#x27;ve wanted. I have tried many other products over the years, even recently trying to save money or to try something different: from Got2B glued, to LA Looks to American Crew and more. Every other gel has flaked out or stopped holding only a few hours into my day or at best 3/4 of the day. I wanted a gel that went on smooth and I could work through the hair - that wasn&#x27;t too glue like - and allowed me to rewet and restyle if needed, but held on all day whether I was in the office or participating in sports.&lt;br /&gt;It is definitely not for long hair styles, someone looking for mousse or a light hairspray to hold back bangs or looking for a chunky look.&lt;br /&gt;Though I might sound like a mouthpiece for the company, I&#x27;m definitely not. It&#x27;s a great gel, I usually stock up since I&#x27;m afraid that I won&#x27;t be able to find it in the future.</li>
    <li> I can not complain about it. It does what it says. The gel was very strong, lasts for days and the most important thing: It has an affordable price. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I have very short hair and after I found this product several years ago, I&#x27;ve been hooked.  All I have to do is wash, towel dry, tousle this product through my damp hair and go.  Easy Peezy!</li>
    <li> I have very coarse hair that lays straight forward and it is hard for me to use most gels. I am on my second bottle of this stuff and I love it. It dries quickly and stays hard all day. Washes out easy. If I use too much or leave it in too long I get a headache, but I think that is normal (at least for a gel that gets this hard).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tip: Get your hands a little wet/damp before you put this into your hair and you won&#x27;t have as much left on your hands afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Click YES if helpful, please :)</li>
    <li> Product is exactly is described and super fast shipping!</li>
    <li> everything was perfect! no problems.......i got what i wanted when i wanted it. 2nd time using this vendor.</li>
    <li> Very good every day product...</li>
    <li> My hair is very straight, in order for me to get it to &amp;#34;spike&amp;#34; this is the only product I&#x27;ve found that works with my hair.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t use too much, it&#x27;s hard to clean out.</li>
    <li> I love this gel. It doesn&#x27;t take very much product to style my hair. A little goes a long way. It provides good hold without being too stiff.</li>
    <li> Great product in a very convenient package.  I have never seen this is a store so I&#x27;m pleased to see it here.</li>
    <li> This is the only gel my husband will use so we buy it in bulk here. Good deal/works really well and is too expensive when bought at the salon.</li>
    <li> My hair is fine, but I have a lot of it so it appears thick. I use this on wet hair, then blow dry. Holds great!</li>
    <li> Its so convenient usually there when i need to do something in a hurry with it. So its very accessible and entertaining at most times of the day seems like i find endless uses for it... keeps my hair perfect</li>
    <li> If you sleep with it in your hair, It doesn&#x27;t flake.  I holds the stubborn areas too!  Best Gel I&#x27;ve used, ever.</li>
    <li> Does what it says it will...nuff said! Been using this product for several years. Given to me by the shop I get my hair cut from!</li>
    <li> The quit producing this product until mid august since they are chaning the packaging, this is exactly what we always buy at the beauty supply store.. So glad I could still get it here since the supply company cant get it until mid august.</li>
    <li> And I still have over half the bottle left. All I need is a light pump, smear the gel across my hand, and it does the rest..pretty great gel. I&#x27;m a fan.</li>
    <li> Great gel.  My first time using it.  Decided to purchase it since my barber raved about it.  Definitely am happy with the gel. My hair stays styled for the entire day and it doesn&#x27;t leave flakes at all.  Also, it smells good.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> This is one of the best gels for people who want a gel that will keep their hair up and not move.</li>
    <li> if ya love it hard you picked the right one, i had someone mistake it for soap once lol its like glue. I&#x27;ve been using it for years i love it and it smells good</li>
    <li> Great products and works for me as advertised but pump is highly vulnerable to clogging and if force is used to pump; crack, break, shatter, cut you!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> love love this product esp. since i found it in xxlg size in pump action too!! holds up the finest hair all day and does not leave a white flaky residue like some jells do!!! my absolute favorite jell and i have used alot!</li>
    <li> I have been using short sexy gel for years. And, it is the first time, I bought it from here. After using it for last 4-5 days, I have come to conclude that this is not the same quality gel as I have been using in the past. This one does not hold up well. Earlier even after sleeping, my hair would stay same. Now, with this gel, my hair loses spikes&#x27; strength after just after few hours. It makes me wonder if it is real short sexy. I would not recommend buying this.</li>
    <li> Purchased this after many years of using cheaper hair products that often really didn&#x27;t hold without using hair spray as well..  This stuff works great . you can feel it starting to firm up as you apply it and usually I have to spray a little more water on my hair to rework it . Works great without any hairspray.</li>
    <li> Great amount for the price!! Will buy again in the future! Hope to see this item again, really like the pump</li>
    <li> My son had a 5&amp;#34; Mohawk and this instate only gel that works!! Fast shipping.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve use many gels on my hair, and this is my least favorite. I&#x27;d rather use Bedhead than this, and that flaked like crazy.  This felt gooey, stiffened the hair to the point that you could not manage it w/out alot of breakage.  I need a gel that will keep the hair in place, but I can still run my fingers thru.  There is one at wally world that is cheap and does the trick.  I just bought some Rene Furterer hair gel and will comment on that soon.</li>
    <li> Great stuff. Great price</li>
    <li> Awesome product but hard to find in stores. Especially the large size. I can wear my motorcycle helmet n it stays fixed!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product on my short hair for years; a little goes a long way. very easy to style wet hair. This size jar is the best value. Only once did I have a problem with shipping..it came in a padded envelope rather than a box and the jar was damaged; they replace it no questions asked</li>
    <li> This product is the best gel of its kind on the market.  It is excellent for men too.  Being a part of this Amazon program makes it a great value too and I love the fact that it just automatically comes to the house.</li>
    <li> Best hair gel, hands down!  Love this stuff as my hair is very straight and difficult to keep down when short...</li>
    <li> I am a religious user of this particular Gel and the price was a great bargain !</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing.  It really holds hair without getting too crunchy.  I love the pump.  Usually I buy the squeeze tube at Target for my son, but he makes a mess of the bottle and the counter.  This helps… it still manages to goo up the sides of the bottle, but its better.  He is eight and doesn&#x27;t seem to be bothered that it&#x27;s called &#x27;sexy&#x27; hair.  :)</li>
    <li> I really like this stuff.  My hair sucks, but at least I still have hair at my age.  Regular hair gel like you&#x27;d find at Target just didn&#x27;t do the job.  This stuff is great and so is the bottle.  I dampen my hair first and then use just a tiny bit of this stuff.  It provides an excellent hold and it doesn&#x27;t feel stiff or crunchy either!  I&#x27;ve been using it for almost six months now and am only about 1/4 of the way through the bottle.  It lasts a real long time since you don&#x27;t need a lot.</li>
    <li> This gel is awesome. It is very strong and no breeze or wind is going to mess up your hair. It is also plentiful; mines lasted me 6 months. I even enrolled in the automatic buying program and it took $5 off. Then I canceled it. Great deal!</li>
    <li> I bought this gel based on the large amount of positive reviews!  Huge mistake.  At 25+ dollars, that&#x27;s about 20 bucks more than I&#x27;d be willing to spend on it again!  Going back to my Axe hair gel until I find something else worth trying!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been buying this stuff for years, never knowing there was a bigger and far more economical size. This is exactly what I needed; saves time and money.</li>
    <li> Really thick and sticky with lots of shine.. use sparingly, with water.  Lasts all day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its really sticky and takes a minute to wash off your hands.</li>
    <li> This is the best hair gel for my short &amp; spikey hair.  It holds all day without being too stiff.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful product to hold a style! Thank you!</li>
    <li> Great price for what you get. With Amazon Prime this is a bargain. It&#x27;s the product hubby uses and he was thrilled I found it in a larger size.</li>
    <li> So I never review products but this stuff works so good I am actually taking a few minutes to do one. Im a 21 year old and always wear my hair in a fohawk. This stuff is perfect for holding it up and you also get that fresh out of the shower look..not too shiny though. I&#x27;ve been through my fair share of American Crew products and I would definitely choose the Short Sexy Hair for the product and the money. This stuff smells good too. I always look for someone who is young reviewing a product so if you&#x27;re just like me...trust me &amp; buy this stuff. have a good one!</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful product for you hair. I have short hair that I spike the front up on and unfortunately I have hair that likes to lay down, so I need a powerful product. This product does the trick with just a small amount! I would recommend this product to anybody, male or female.</li>
    <li> Guys, all of you that use gel in your hair, this is the stuff to get. I have used a million different hair gels in my nearly 40 years and this stuff is thee best. Bar none. I was first introduced to it at a hair salon. I thought it was pricey for hair gel, but over time I loved how it set my hair. I was happy to see Amazon had a large pump bottle size that sits nicely on my sink. Love this stuff.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years, it works great.</li>
    <li> I have tried many different gel&#x27;s and this one is the best.  Went hunting around for better prices on it and wow, what a great price for the nearly 17oz of gel.  The shipping, packaging and delivery were acceptably adequate.  Very happy with the product.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my husband. He has tried this brand in the past and liked it. He likes this as well, and it is a great amount of product that will last him a very long time. My only complaint on this product is that if it drips onto the sink/counter, it can harden into a rubbery substance that is hard to clean up.</li>
    <li> I have used this &amp;#34;Hard up Jel&amp;#34; for many years I love it.  It doesn&#x27;t flake or get sticky.  It holds grey, course hair very well.  Would not use anything else.  One suggestion, put a small amount on your hand and rub hands together before applying.  Otherwise you will get big globs on your hair.  Wonderful product</li>
    <li> I love the pump, but it does seem to clog. Doesn&#x27;t take long to fix. This is really great hair gel for my short hair.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s Gel. Strong Gel.  Best price out there!</li>
    <li> Been using this stuff for years. A small amount is all it takes.  This product works really great! Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> now I am not in to sexy hair but my wife uses this stuff all the time she saw your price.well that did it for her she just had to have it</li>
    <li> I still have this, and yes my hair is fab... my absolute go to gel.</li>
    <li> This hair gel certainly gets the job done.  If you want a hard hold gel that will pretty much last all day and this is the one for you.</li>
    <li> My kids and I use this just about every day. Works great. Also you only need a tiny squirt each day. Will definitely buy more!</li>
    <li> my son wont use any other kind. I&#x27;ve purchased this twice so both my sons can have their own. Doesn&#x27;t cause flaking. olds up all day.&lt;br /&gt;This is the best value, size vs. cost.</li>
    <li> I have been using this &amp;#34;short sexy hair Hard Up&amp;#34; gel for years now.  The best feature about this product is its flexibility.  You can use a smaller amount and go for a more reserved look when you need to, and at the same time, you can use a bit more and go for faux hawks, spikes, and other looks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I always get this 16.9 ounce pump bottle.  It lasts about 1 year.  The smaller containers at your local stores will cost almost as much as this pump!  Amazon wins again!</li>
    <li> Great price and product but the pump does not work well. It clogs constantly and sticks in the down position.</li>
    <li> This stuff is a great deal. A much better deal than anything I can find at the local drug store. These guys have found a long term customer! Great lasting hold - good smell.</li>
    <li> If you don&#x27;t want your hair to move for a month, you&#x27;ll love this. It lasted me forever. Way cheaper on amazon than in the store or salon. It&#x27;s NOT a typical gel. It&#x27;s like glue. But I got so tired of cheaper stuff flaking out throughout the day.</li>
    <li> Bought this in February -- I&#x27;m maybe halfway thru the bottle.  I didn&#x27;t really like it for the first few days to be honest -- I thought the consistency was a bit thick.  I think I was used to other gels and trying to use too much.  My hairstyle is a faux hawk style and this stuff is perfect!  It holds all day, styles easy and locks into place without being heavy.  And it apparently will last for a year</li>
    <li> I love my short sexy hair gel.  It came in the mail fast.</li>
    <li> Great stuff with free prime shipping u can&#x27;t go wrong</li>
    <li> very compacy  container, use this gel sparingly, a little goes a long way. pump gives just the correct amount of gel.</li>
    <li> Even if you have a bit longer hair 1-3&amp;#34; up top bordering with John Larroquette type thickness try it.  Best stuff I have found in thirty years.  Application technique will take practice but experiment.  I use damp and try and spread out what collects inbetween my fingers after first rubbing my hands together.  I use one squirt after a haircut to about 1.5 squirts a month or so later.  I have never been able to keep my thick hair in front swept up or swept back on my wrong direction side until this stuff.  You can really wake up with no bed head sometimes if you are lucky.  Amazing stuff.  I use one light pass of their big whatever they call it hairspray (update: now I don&#x27;t even use hairspray just hand pressure and heat) and then a quick press down with my hand as I apply heat to my sides a bit.  The hair above my ears stays down all day!</li>
    <li> My hair cut lady uses this it works great. Great price for the amount of product. It is twice as much at the local store</li>
    <li> Great Product as Advertised!  Met and exceeded my expectations. Will do business with this company again!</li>
    <li> It is a really good gel. It really works well for me, and I haven&#x27;t have any bad experience with it. I&#x27;m not so sure about the price, but luckily can be found for cheaper.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a couple of years now.  It&#x27;s the only kind I buy any more.  Good stuff.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always used this product but this is a great deal for this size container.</li>
    <li> Just as described. Came in secure package and bottle was full to the top.</li>
    <li> I use this gel all the time. I the salon I pay $15 to 20 dollars for a 8oz bottle. This is a great deal.</li>
    <li> works good for wet or dry hair if hair is short</li>
    <li> I was so happy to find a larger size of this product. It saved quite a but of $$ buying it in a larger size. My husband and 2 boys use this everyday on their hair. They have tried lots of other gels but nothing works as well as this.</li>
    <li> Over the years I&#x27;ve tried many hair gel brands. I didn&#x27;t like any of them until I found this. I&#x27;ve tried others since but always seem to go back to this. I like a very hard hold that can last all day. I&#x27;ve been using this gel for about 10 years now. As long as you rub in enough of it, it dries hard and crunchy, giving you spiky hair. It doesn&#x27;t flake if used like this. I have noticed, though, if I use it sparingly, it still dries hard but the spikiness gets soft and flaky after a few hours.</li>
    <li> Great price and great product. I use it every day and I do not have to worry about running out it soon.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay. Just overpriced.</li>
    <li> If you have hair that won&#x27;t manage or stay in one place this stuff is for you!! It&#x27;s the ultimate hair gel!!</li>
    <li> Competitive pricing, great product. This stuff dries like glue, smells great, doesn&#x27;t run (for active guys), and washes out easily. I&#x27;ve tried just about all of the &amp;#34;super-hold&amp;#34; gels, and this one beats them all by a long shot.</li>
    <li> The Hard Up gel is amazing.  It&#x27;s the only gel I will use.  I&#x27;ve been wearing my hair kind of spiky and with this gel, I could be in a hurricane and my hair wouldn&#x27;t move.  Another big plus is it smells good enough to eat!  :)  I have had people think I&#x27;m am wearing perfume.  You can&#x27;t go wrong with the Hard Up gel.</li>
    <li> I received the gel in no time, the package was good and it works just fine as advertised. I recommend buying it. If it wasn&#x27;t for the price I would give 5 stars.</li>
    <li> This works great on short, thin hair. Have used this for about 3 years. I would recommend to anyone that wants a spikey look on short hair. I have used other water based gels and this beats them hands down.</li>
    <li> This is my go to gel.  Definitely, if you like super hard gel, this is the one.  If you don&#x27;t want it too hard, just wet your hand and put a little of gel, and you will be good to go.</li>
    <li> Excellent.  Hair stays in place all day. Highly recommend this product. I have used this product for last three years.</li>
    <li> My favorite gel for keeping my hair put!</li>
    <li> The name says it all, Short Sexy Hair (Hard Up). Sexy Hair products are the best you can buy. They&#x27;re pretty pricey but so worth it. I&#x27;ve used so many different gels over the years &amp; nothing would work. My hair is so thick &amp; heavy nothing but those POS glue gels would hold it up. &amp; they flake &amp; hurt to take out cuz you have to brush it out in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thought theres no hope for me.Then one day I go to get a hair cut &amp; the lady ask me \\&quot;do I want her to do my hair\\&quot;, usually I say no &amp; go home &amp; do it but that day I said yes. She brings over this incredible gel that I&#x27;ve never seen before &amp; puts it in my hair &amp; magic happened. I fell in love that minute (with the gel). So she asked \\&quot;would you like to buy some?\\&quot; &amp; I was like for sure. Then that&#x27;s when I got shocked cuz a lil 15 oz bottle was $18. I still bought it but was disappointed it was so much. Then I found this pump on here for a few dollars more but twice as much as that lil bottle.  Was soo stoked. Then after a few purchases it was out of stock &amp; I was bummed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So then I went to my local hair supply shop &amp; they had the lil bottles &amp; a huge 56+ oz bottle, that big bottle was $55 dollars &amp; I bought the last 2 they had. It lasted forever. Then when I finally ran out, like a year, lil over a year later (cuz I do mine &amp; my 2 sons hair) I went back &amp; they didn&#x27;t have anymore left, I was bummed once again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I came back to old faithful Amazon &amp; lord be hold it was here again. Soo happy. This gel is hands down the best. You get what you pay for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now that I solved my hair gel problem I had to find a good hair spray. I&#x27;ve always used Aussie Instant Freeze &amp; it holds good but I wanted something more. I&#x27;ve been using my girls Big Sexy Hair (Spray &amp; Play Harder) hair spray as of late &amp; it works ok but wanted something stronger. Let me add this gel is so good you don&#x27;t really need hair spray but my hair is so heavy I need that extra stiffness to get me thru the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well anyway, one day I walk into my hair supply store to get some blue/black hair dye &amp; I see this hair spray that just was standing out, yes it was a Big Sexy Hair product too but one I&#x27;ve never seen or heard of called Spray &amp; Stay, &amp; it has a lil badge on it that says \\&quot;All Nighter Hair Spray\\&quot; so I had to try &amp; you know what?! The 2 best hair products alive. This gel &amp; that hair spray are ridiculous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair game is soo sick now, ppl always ask me \\&quot;what I use to get my hair so dope &amp; keep it that way\\&quot; &amp; I say \\&quot;I start off with Short Sexy Hair (Hard Up Gel) &amp; finish with Big Sexy Hair (Spray &amp; Stay Hair Spray)\\&quot; works magic &amp; holds like a champ.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I could go to sleep wake up &amp; my hair still looks like it did the day before &amp; if I&#x27;m lazy I&#x27;ll take a shower, skip washing my hair &amp; be ready for the day &amp; wash it out later. I could go 3 days if I wanted to but thats nasty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But all that said, you can&#x27;t go wrong with this cuz it&#x27;s the best &amp; if you want to finish it off with the best hair spray get you some Big Sexy Hair (Spray &amp; Stay) hair spray, it&#x27;s kinda hard to find. Like no store has it I think only hair supply stores do, if you&#x27;re lucky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sorry for the long story but had to share my experience that got me to find this wonderful product!ell anyway, one day I walk into my hair supply store to get some blue/black hair dye &amp; I see this hair spray that just was standing out, yes it was a Big Sexy Hair product too but one I&#x27;ve never seen or heard of called Spray &amp; Stay, &amp; it has a lil badge on it that says \\&quot;All Nighter Hair Spray\\&quot; so I had to try &amp; you know what?!

    <li> Works great, hold good, no flakes</li>
    <li> I do not have short hair.  I have shoulder length curly hair.  I use mousse, then this gel, then a very small amount of another gel.  This gel is much better than the cheaper gels in the store.</li>
    <li> Great product in a convenient pump bottle.  This will last much longer than the tubes that I used to buy.</li>
    <li> Keeps my hair in place and doesn&#x27;t flake.</li>
    <li> Best hair gel I&#x27;ve ever used. This size bottle is a huge deal and savings versus the small ones you find in stores.</li>
    <li> Hmmm.  So I finally found the one.  &amp;#34;sixty hair hard up gel&amp;#34;.  No more hunt or money waste for gel. Hunt is over thank God.</li>
    <li> I use this product for a long time now. I had a smaller bottle, but this is perfect. No flakes. Fast shipping!</li>
    <li> I have a nice spiked look going in part thanks to Short Sexy hair.  Good value and great product.  Thank you!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m always looking for a decent way to keep my hair styled and this stuff is better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried. I can put it on in the morning, and it stays the same way, &amp;#34;hard up&amp;#34;, all day long. I could even jump into the shower or a pool, and emerge with my hair still standing the same way it was before I went it. I love it. It can be a little tough to get out of your hair, but once you use shampoo, it sort of deactivates it, and it comes right out. Great product!</li>
    <li> I always use this gel and I saw this deal so I took it. Its blue but doesnt turn your hair blue or anything. Its just great for short hair. I dont need it to look sexy but it helps :)</li>
    <li> The product is great. It does what it is supposed to do. Saved money here on line. Only draw back is when shipped in box, one of the canisters broke, i had to transfer the gel product into another empty canister to save what I could. So we lost some of the product we ordered. But otherwise all good!</li>
    <li> Probably one of the best hair gels for hold and zero flakes.  All the men in my family prefer this over all others we&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> Company shipped this super fast at a very affordable price.  My husband uses this product everyday and loves it.  He likes that spike look and achieves this all day with very little product.</li>
    <li> I have very thick, curly jewish hair type 3 that frizzes up.  This is the perfect product for my hair.  I get nothing but compliments from other women.  I&#x27;ve used this when I grow my hair out and when it&#x27;s short.  A+++</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great product that I had been looking for for awhile.  I am very happy with it, for fine hair it&#x27;s great.</li>
    <li> It does what it is supposed to and doesn&#x27;t seem to dry my hair.  It&#x27;s hard, though, and now that my hair is growing out and I use it to flatten my hair for short ponytail, it&#x27;s still hard the next day and almost impossible to brush through!  My husband likes to borrow it, too.</li>
    <li> I like the pump more than dipping into a tub.  It&#x27;s also much easier to apply and holds up really well through outhe day.  No flaking either, which is a huge plus.</li>
    <li> I have short hair that is heavy and thick.  I wear it spikey all over.  The back is the most difficult to spike because it goes against gravity but this gel is awesome.  In our humid, rainy weather, I walk in my house the same way I walked out.</li>
    <li> My favorite gel...best Jersey Shore look!</li>
    <li> I have been using this for years. I have soft flat hair and a little of this on my palms gives me wave and body that lasts for days. Do not use too much at a time or you will have stiff, stuck together hair.</li>
    <li> Value buy for sure! I will definitely buy again!</li>
    <li> THE BEST. USING FOR YEARS</li>
    <li> Great to keep the hair in place</li>
    <li> Bought this for my 7 year old. I had a hard time finding a gel that would keep his hairstyle in tacked and not go white. This works wonderfully and even if he falls asleep with his blanket over his head he will wake up with not a hair on his head out of place. He is a very active child so this worked wonderfully for him.</li>
    <li> The only product that is on auto order.</li>
    <li> This is a great product if you have short hair and really want to spike it up! Humid climates and rain do not matter as my hair stays looking great. It is best to use a clarifying shampoo as that will remove all residue. Overall a great product. I get a lot of rave reviews.</li>
    <li> Been using Crew for years but found it wears out by the end of the day.  It just takes a little bit to hold my hair in place nearly the entire day.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been purchasing this gel for quite some time to use on both my husband and sons hair. It works great and holds their very rebellious hair. My 11 year old whose constantly changing his hair from spikey to mohawk loves it because it hold his hair in place all day long. When  I mean all day I&#x27;m talking till he jumps in the shower and washes it off. This huge bottle is hard to find at retail stores and if you do they are often very expensive. I&#x27;m so happy to be able to find it here on Amazon for so much less. This bottle is going to easily last them a good couple of months. A pea size is enough to give you  the hold you want. Love it and highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years and it is fantastic.  The reason why it only received 2 stars is because of the pump dispenser that the product is in.  The pump does not work well AT ALL.  The pump get stucks constantly and only dispenses a small amount.  I constantly need to &amp;#34;mess with it&amp;#34; for it to actually dispense the gel.  The gel &#x3D; phenomenal, the pump &#x3D; HORRIBLE!</li>
    <li> paid way too much at the Barber shop. this is 2x that amount in a PUMP WIN WIN!</li>
    <li> My sons and husband love this product! Will buy again!</li>
    <li> I like this product because it holds my short hair very well but as mentioned above it does tend to cause build-up in my scalp that eventually led to having dandruff. I only use it on occasion now.</li>
    <li> I love the pump, it works good in my hair.  It is not &amp;#34;re-stylable&amp;#34; so when you put it in, you better like the way it looks because you really can&#x27;t change it unless you re-wet it.</li>
    <li> This was my first time buying this hair product and it amazed me how strong of a hold it was. It&#x27;s like the equivalent to a long-lasting hairspray. Except in this case it&#x27;s in the form of a gel. It keeps your hair up all day and the shine stays with it all day as well. If considering buying this product, no need to think twice.</li>
    <li> Good value, and works fantastic.  I love this product and would buy it again.  It works great, and lasts all day.</li>
