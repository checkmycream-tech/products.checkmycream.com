      <li>I didn&#x27;t really like the hook or the handle, but for the price they did the job.</li>

      <li>I&#x27;ve only used one of these so far, and it&#x27;s been almost a month...</li>
      <li>I had bought one of the other brand and it was to big to pull lose hairs in the dread, I had huge clumps of hair trying to pull it in my small dread</li>

<li> Kind of thin and not easy to handle.</li>
<li> At the rate I&#x27;m going, I know that this pack of 4 hooks will last me for a long time.  </li>
<li> It&#x27;s a lot smaller than I expected.</li>
<li> Also, they are much smaller than other competing products out there.</li>
<li> I would warn you to avoid using  excess force when weaving in the loose hairs.</li>
<li> Not what I expected.</li>
<li> they are small enough to make single knots around the hairline or nape.</li>
<li> The hooks are VERY small and the handle seems a little fragile but is getting the job done for my project.</li>
<li> Not at all what I expected wayyyyyy too small</li>
<li> These things are tiny - as in the latch hook is actually 2mm wide, flimsy and actually physically impossible to use for hair.</li>
<li> I would not recommend this product for any heavy duty projects.</li>
<li> waste of shipping cost.</li>
<li> The handles are so weak I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;ll even be able to use them for the intended purpose :(</li>
<li> Product is extremely frail, made for use on delicate projects by  delicate users.</li>
<li> They are a little weak looking to me .</li>
<li> Not good for people who want to crotchet hair.</li>
<li> The hooks had perforated the envelope and one of the hooks was bent and almost broken.</li>
<li> The picture shows the latch hook well its 10 times smaller than the picture very disappointed.</li>
<li> I feel silly for buying them.</li>
<li> This was one of the worst products that I have ever purchased.</li>

    <li> We use these hooks for threading fiber onto braiding machines. The operators love these because it makes the threading so much easier and the plastic handles make them harder to lose as well as ergonomic.</li>
    <li> These will pull in the smallest of hair. Highly recommend for edges and fine hair. It&#x27;s nice also that you get more then 1.</li>
    <li> The latch hooks are great when ventilating a lace wig. it makes the process infinitely easier than using the traditional needles. they are small enough to make single knots around the hairline or nape. i recommend these needles.</li>
    <li> This is great to use on dreads as it is small and can get in and out of the dread without pulling the other hairs. I had bought one of the other brand and it was to big to pull lose hairs in the dread, I had huge clumps of hair trying to pull it in my small dread so this worked perfect , I gave it one less star because I would have liked a wooden handle.</li>
    <li> You get what you pay for! These hooks a VERY VERY flimsy and literally 10x smaller than they appear! The handles are so weak I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;ll even be able to use them for the intended purpose :(</li>
    <li> Not at all what I expected wayyyyyy too small smh now I can&#x27;t do my hair like I wanted to thanks to these cheap flimsy crochet needles I want a REFUND!</li>
    <li> The latch hook are very tiny. Easy to break and I would not buy this again. The picture shows the latch hook well its 10 times smaller than the picture very disappointed.</li>
    <li> I used it to repair my locs and it worked perfectly well.&lt;br /&gt;The packaging was not too good though. The hooks had perforated the envelope and one of the hooks was bent and almost broken.</li>
    <li> Perfect for wig ventilating! The hooks are VERY small and the handle seems a little fragile but is getting the job done for my project. I would not recommend this product for any heavy duty projects.</li>
    <li> FYI, these are tiny, but they still work.</li>
    <li> I just got them today, i used them for my dreadlocks &amp; when i did it broke. I had to pay $9 for these piece of s*** plastic crochet needles. never again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used one of these so far, and it&#x27;s been almost a month...it&#x27;s a little flimsy and curves after using it a while, but you just bend it back gently to it&#x27;s original shape and it works great.  At the rate I&#x27;m going, I know that this pack of 4 hooks will last me for a long time.  No complaints...great for the price!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t really like the hook or the handle, but for the price they did the job. I wish I wouldn&#x27;t have lost them! It was good that they came in a pack of four or it wouldn&#x27;t have taken this long to lose all of them.</li>
    <li> it was not what I thought it was, they were cheap and did not work the way I had expected</li>
    <li> Arrived in perfect timing. Not to thrilled at how thin the handles are. Didn&#x27;t get a chance to use it yet. Looks like a good product. Thanks</li>
    <li> This product was definitely not what I thought it was going to be. This was one of the worst products that I have ever purchased.</li>
    <li> This was perfect for maintaining my locks and it is the best size for delicate work. I am very satisfied with these hooks.</li>
    <li> Not what I expected. Would not recommend. Flimsy product nothing else needs to be said other than it wasn&#x27;t worth the money.</li>
    <li> Use them for my dreads, great help!!</li>
    <li> I like the ones with the wooden handle these ones bend around to much. However I did like the length of the hook so I gave it a extra star</li>
    <li> These needles are VERY FLIMSY. The latch part sometimes breaks off in my dreads.  You get what you pay for. Also, they are much smaller than other competing products out there. It&#x27;s all personal preference, so it depends what you&#x27;re looking for, but be warned.</li>
    <li> Just received it in the mail. They are a little weak looking to me . have had a chance to try them out.</li>
    <li> You get what you pay for... Product is extremely frail, made for use on delicate projects by  delicate users. Tried using once, now they&#x27;re back in the same envelope they shipped in sitting in a corner of a box... waste of shipping cost.</li>
    <li> I love these hooks, I am able to make my own lace closure, with these which is great save me from having to buy them, has save</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a lot smaller than I expected. The space could probably only for a thread. Not good for people who want to crotchet hair.</li>
    <li> Kind of thin and not easy to handle. I am going to order a different type....these I will give away.</li>
    <li> These things are tiny - as in the latch hook is actually 2mm wide, flimsy and actually physically impossible to use for hair. I feel silly for buying them.</li>
    <li> Works great when my cats pull the strands on my rug</li>
    <li> I use this to dread my hair. I find it to be very useful. I would warn you to avoid using  excess force when weaving in the loose hairs.These aren&#x27;t super durable but they do work well.</li>
