      <li>and I&#x27;ve already ordered 2 more.</li>

      <li>Thank you, Amazon and Spring Valley Herbs, for offering this product in this safe, accessible venue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Linda</li>
      <li>Thank you, Amazon and Spring Valley Herbs, for offering this product in this safe, accessible venue.    </li>
      <li>Product relieves muscle pain and is an easy way to get maximum magnesium in the body.</li>
      <li>Easy to apply, but spray sometimes clogs</li>
      <li>Experienced many physical benefits.</li>
      <li>Gladly Dr Shealy saw my desperation and came to my rescue,plus it&#x27;s also quite reassuring that he is a true expert in this field.</li>
      <li>I bought this mostly to help with insomnia, and it didn&#x27;t disappoint - from the very first night after I started using it</li>
      <li>Let&#x27;s say it is, yay, because this is easy enough to apply, doesn&#x27;t sting too much, doesn&#x27;t smell at all, and best of all, no GI distress.  </li>
      <li>just ad will a little oil it is great!!</li>
      <li>They make a fantastic team.  </li>
      <li>I enjoy the feel of the lotion and the scent</li>
      <li>They make a fantastic team.  </li>
      <li>generous size, unscented and applies smoothly.</li>
      <li>This lotion goes on smooth not sticky.</li>
      <li>Two offerings of this brine are currently available on Amazon:  </li>
      <li>After just using this for one month I have more energy and my thinking is more clear.  </li>
      <li>which varies from person to person and from time to time, and which I&#x27;m speculating is set in our current time for all of us, by necessity, in a default lower than optimum.  </li>
      <li>Lotion is good, low mag is a problem, but this isn&#x27;t the answer.</li>
      <li>SO I had to start using it in the morning and really rubbing it in all the way.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll prolly get more when I run out.</li>
      <li>shipped quickly.</li>
      <li>I get fairly quick relief.&lt;br /&gt;Hope</li>
      <li>I feel so lucky to have found him.</li>
      <li>lotion feels wonderful on my skin and seems, overall, to be contributing to the decrease of symptoms related to Mg deficiency.  </li>
      <li>but I have experienced slight headaches-but nothing like it used to be...</li>
      <li>I was also impressed to read, through a Google search, that Dr. Shealy is confident enough to be open about believing he has spent more than one lifetime dedicated to relieving pain.  </li>

      <li>allows).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Returning to detailing this intriguing product, I&#x27;ll summarize some of my experience with this lotion by comparing it to magnesium \\&quot;oil\\&quot; (which seems to be the Index*</li>
      <li>Yet, I&#x27;ve experienced considerable pluses from Dr. Shealy&#x27;s lotion, and am hoping that continued usage will develop equal trust in the lotion and oil.  </li>
      <li>He is on the radio on Thursdays-and you can speak to him directly- and for free!</li>
      <li>Magneisum is so vital for so many reasons.</li>
      <li>I had been getting this directly from my doctor but he charged more than Amazon.   </li>
      <li>but most importantly it does what it&#x27;s supposed to do in a very likeable manner,and that is to efficiently restore and maintain one&#x27;s magnesium levels thus improving ones general health and well being.</li>
      <li>am pleased with the results so far and will continue to use it for awhile to see if it consistently helps rid the legs of muscle cramping.</li>
      <li>According to my hypothesis, this dynamic default continues evolving toward a better, more natural balance.</li>
      <li>This product is also great for preventing pain from strenuous or repetitive physical activity or, if I forget to apply it before, great for relieving pain resulting from physical activity.</li>
      <li>First of all, I have very sensitive skin (I&#x27;ve used Clinique and other specialty products for years), so for this lotion not to cause me a reaction is already pretty darn great.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This product works exactly as advertised. It is a lot less irritating to the skin then other brands that I have tried. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> What are Biogenics and why focus only the single mineral, magnesium, in this silky lotion designed to heal the body through the skin?  To obtain in-depth details on these subjects, in addition to reading reviews on this product, I recommend doing Google searches on Norman Shealy and on Zechstein magnesium chloride.  Briefly, BIOGENICS is a concept developed by Dr. Shealy to help patients clear out chronic pain and its causal chains.  MAGNESIUM is what many people currently believe to be the King Pin Mineral* necessary for performing all bodily functions; it&#x27;s the foundation through which other nutrients and chemicals perform optimally (or minimally at a base survival level).* So why do most current offerings of food and medicine debilitate or delete magnesium in the body?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have wondered if it would be healthy to know the answer to that.  I&#x27;ve been working to crack that deadly nut partially through my paradigm of DYNAMIC CHEMICAL BALANCE DEFAULT (DCBD) (my term and concept © 2009 by Linda Shelnutt)* which varies from person to person and from time to time, and which I&#x27;m speculating is set in our current time for all of us, by necessity, in a default lower than optimum.  According to my hypothesis, this dynamic default continues evolving toward a better, more natural balance.* That is, unless a person has fallen into a decline toward death, in which case that default continues to alter periodically, in phases moving toward that release from multiple types of suffering.* I&#x27;m hoping (though not promising) to continue posting reviews on products geared toward defeating magnesium deficiency and its accompanying ills. I&#x27;d like to post comments under some of those reviews (using an asterisk when I want to write more on a topic as time allows).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Returning to detailing this intriguing product, I&#x27;ll summarize some of my experience with this lotion by comparing it to magnesium \\&quot;oil\\&quot; (which seems to be the Index* for transdermal mag chloride brine offerings).  Two offerings of this brine are currently available on Amazon:  [[ASIN:B0026RCMAG Swanson Ultra Magnesium Oil 8 fl oz (237 ml) Spray]], and [[ASIN:B001AD0HL8 Ancient Minerals Ultra Pure Magnesium Oil 8 oz.]].  If you have interest, read my reviews and comments on the Swanson oil and on [[ASIN:B002E62HXQ Magnesium Chloride Flakes 2.2 lb (35.27 oz) Flakes]] for details about magnesium deficiency and some of its symptoms, causes, and cures.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I posted this review, my strongest trust was in basic magnesium chloride brine water (it&#x27;s called an oil but it&#x27;s a brine) in capacity for reversing magnesium deficiency.  Yet, I&#x27;ve experienced considerable pluses from Dr. Shealy&#x27;s lotion, and am hoping that continued usage will develop equal trust in the lotion and oil.  [Update 2/15/10: Using both equally; they complement each other very well!]  The most impressive information on the lotion&#x27;s label is that 150 mg of elemental magnesium are held in a teaspoon quantity.*&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PRO for BIOGENICS MAGNESIUM LOTION (as per the product label, this lotion has several ingredients added to Magnesium Chloride to enhance its effect and increase the comfort and convenience of application; these ingredients include glycerin, gar gum, lotion base, cyclomethicone, Squalane, and Germaben II):&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve Googled these ingredients&#x27; pros and cons and have concluded for myself at this time that they are likely beneficial in overall effect, contributing to a soothing, moisturizing feel in the lotion&#x27;s texture which allows an easy, silky glide onto the skin with less potential for a burning effect sometimes experienced with the pure Mg chloride oils.  The lotion dries quickly to no notice of the application (no tacky, thick, or oily residue) other than a subtle sensation of a pleasantly naturopathic healing, cleansing effect.*&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lotion feels wonderful on my skin and seems, overall, to be contributing to the decrease of symptoms related to Mg deficiency.  In fact, in one area in which the Mg oil was slowly reducing symptoms, the Biogenics lotion seems to be getting a higher result than the brine water.  I hadn&#x27;t mentioned in earlier product reviews that magnesium applications seem to be reducing flares up of shingles, in addition to reducing other as yet unmentioned pathogenic issues, since I&#x27;m not at a point of being sure of causal connections. * The lotion seems to be diminishing Shingles flares up through applications of the lotion on affected areas of hands and forearms, leaving it on for about 20 minutes, then rinsing it off, along with the dead skin and particles which the lotion sometimes seems to lift from inside skin layers.* With magnesium bioavailability gradually increasing, it appears (crossing fingers) that the shingles [and a symbiotic spinal tumor] are slowly* receding.  [See comments added below this review for more info.]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PRO for BASIC MAGNESIUM OIL (a solution of the purest available Magnesium Chloride and water, obtained from the Zechstein* seabed in the Netherlands):&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I want a product as pure as possible, with no active or \\&quot;inactive\\&quot; sideline ingredients to the healing force (magnesium) I believe will reverse interconnected debilitating health issues.  I especially want this simple purity because I&#x27;m 62 years old* and at a survival level necessity of reversing chronic health issues which were pulling me rapidly toward a painful death.*  I&#x27;ve used Swanson&#x27;s Mg Chloride brine water (that&#x27;s all it is; nothing added or deleted) for a few weeks and am awed by the gradually increasing relief of several symptoms I relate to Mg deficiency.* To read some excellent information on what types of ailments likely relate to this deficiency and how, get this book, available in paperback and on Kindle, [[ASIN:B001ODEPY4 The Magnesium Miracle]].&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t yet know whether bioavailability* of magnesium is as strong (or possibly stronger) in this lotion as it is in pure Mg chloride brine from the Zechstein seabed.  Twice or more daily I&#x27;ve been focusing applications of Swanson Mg brine directly on my spine* [which I believe, along with coring other benefits, is contributing to the shingles removal, due to viral pathogens&#x27; root residence being in the spine] and underarms (the oil serves as a deodorant when I add jasmine oil), and on other skin areas when impulses, cramping, or symptoms draw attention.  I had been using the biogenic lotion mostly on my hands, arms, and feet, but not on my spine since that vital cord acts as a life force processor, and could be vulnerable to substances not as pure as solitary magnesium in strength generation.* [Update 2/15/10:  I&#x27;m now confident using the oil and the lotion interchangeably.  They make a fantastic team.  However I&#x27;ll observe cautiously to avoid getting too much of some of the added ingredients, with extensive use over time.]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In conclusion I want to say that several observations have impressed me about the physician who designed this Biogenics Magnesium Lotion, including that it appears he has added some of the ingredients to meet requests made in reviews of it.  I was also impressed to read, through a Google search, that Dr. Shealy is confident enough to be open about believing he has spent more than one lifetime dedicated to relieving pain.  As a parapsychologist, I tend to believe this man&#x27;s reports of alternate life personal histories.  Does this have anything to do with the efficacy of Biogenics Magnesium Lotion?  I say, very likely.  I&#x27;ve concluded that this physician is an inventive, brilliant, caring man, who may have carried knowledge through lifetimes of dedication.  Dr. Shealy, thank you for your contributions toward freeing the human race from debilitation and pain.  Thank you, Amazon and Spring Valley Herbs, for offering this product in this safe, accessible venue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Linda G. Shelnutteducing symptoms, the Biogenics lotion seems to be getting a higher result than the brine water.  I hadn&#x27;t mentioned in earlier product reviews that magnesium applications seem to be reducing flares up of shingles, in addition to reducing other as yet unmentioned pathogenic issues, since I&#x27;m not at a point of being sure of causal connections. * The lotion seems to be diminishing Shingles flares up through applications of the lotion on affected areas of hands and forearms, leaving it on for about 20 minutes, then rinsing it off, along with the dead skin and particles which the lotion sometimes seems to lift from inside skin layers.* With magnesium bioavailability gradually increasing, it appears (crossing fingers) that the shingles [and a symbiotic spinal tumor] are slowly* receding.   [See comments added below this review for more info.]    PRO for BASIC MAGNESIUM OIL (a solution of the purest available Magnesium Chloride and water, obtained from the Zechstein* seabed in the Netherlands):    I want a product as pure as possible, with no active or \\&quot;inactive\\&quot; sideline ingredients to the healing force (magnesium) I believe will reverse interconnected debilitating health issues.  I especially want this simple purity because I&#x27;m 62 years old* and at a survival level necessity of reversing chronic health issues which were pulling me rapidly toward a painful death.*  I&#x27;ve used Swanson&#x27;s Mg Chloride brine water (that&#x27;s all it is; nothing added or deleted) for a few weeks and am awed by the gradually increasing relief of several symptoms I relate to Mg deficiency.* To read some excellent information on what types of ailments likely relate to this deficiency and how, get this book, available in paperback and on Kindle, [[ASIN:B001ODEPY4 The Magnesium Miracle]].    I don&#x27;t yet know whether bioavailability* of magnesium is as strong (or possibly stronger) in this lotion as it is in pure Mg chloride brine from the Zechstein seabed.   Twice or more daily I&#x27;ve been focusing applications of Swanson Mg brine directly on my spine* [which I believe, along with coring other benefits, is contributing to the shingles removal, due to viral pathogens&#x27; root residence being in the spine] and underarms (the oil serves as a deodorant when I add jasmine oil), and on other skin areas when impulses, cramping, or symptoms draw attention.  I had been using the biogenic lotion mostly on my hands, arms, and feet, but not on my spine since that vital cord acts as a life force processor, and could be vulnerable to substances not as pure as solitary magnesium in strength generation.* [Update 2/15/10:  I&#x27;m now confident using the oil and the lotion interchangeably.  They make a fantastic team.  However I&#x27;ll observe cautiously to avoid getting too much of some of the added ingredients, with extensive use over time.]    In conclusion I want to say that several observations have impressed me about the physician who designed this Biogenics Magnesium Lotion, including that it appears he has added some of the ingredients to meet requests made in reviews of it.  I was also impressed to read, through a Google search, that Dr. Shealy is confident enough to be open about believing he has spent more than one lifetime dedicated to relieving pain.  As a parapsychologist, I tend to believe this man&#x27;s reports of alternate life personal histories.   Does this have anything to do with the efficacy of Biogenics Magnesium Lotion?  I say, very likely.  I&#x27;ve concluded that this physician is an inventive, brilliant, caring man, who may have carried knowledge through lifetimes of dedication.  Dr. Shealy, thank you for your contributions toward freeing the human race from debilitation and pain.  Thank you, Amazon and Spring Valley Herbs, for offering this product in this safe, accessible venue.    Linda G. Shelnutt</li>
    <li> I had returned this product simpley for the fact that it contained squalane which is a hydrologized form of squalene.</li>
    <li> After just using this for one month I have more energy and my thinking is more clear.  I highly recommend this product for women who experience menopausal symptoms like tiredness, insomnia, irritability and fuzzy thinking.</li>
    <li> After years of looking for remedies for leg cramps and trying various solutions (quinine, heating pads cold, stretching, etc) by 3d application cramps 98% eliminated!.</li>
    <li> Just what I was hoping for. I apply it 4 or 5 times a day. My situation includes: hypertension, depression,anxiety disorder w/ panic and nerve issues. Blood sugar issues as well. Because of IBS, I don&#x27;t do well with oral magnesium supplements, but this product is great and I&#x27;ve already ordered 2 more. I apply it to the front and sides of my torso, then later to my forearms. after 30 minutes I wash it off ( absorption is complete in 20-30 mins), to ready for the forthcoming re-application. 70% of americans are deficient in magnesium. Try it.</li>
    <li> This product arrived very quickly and is really wonderful.  After doing research on the benefits of magnesium, I started taking the pills and thought I would try the lotion as well.  It works quite well for me...I am especially grateful for solid sleep after a few years of disrupted sleep patterns.  This lotion truly helped me.  I will say it&#x27;s not the consistency of regular lotion, more like a gel texture, but not oily or sticky. Great product that&#x27;s working well for me. I will definitely purchase it again.</li>
    <li> I had been getting this directly from my doctor but he charged more than Amazon.   This is a wonderful way to get magnesium that gets working into the body more quickly.  I use it on my legs every night.    It really helps with leg cramps.</li>
    <li> generous size, unscented and applies smoothly.</li>
    <li> This was what I expected but more messy. Dr. Shealy said it has the consistency of corn huskers and it does. His recommendation is two tsps.(2 tbls. in his video) rubbed anywhere except the eyes. At 5&#x27;8\\&quot;, I don&#x27;t have enough skin area to put THAT much on so I used one tsp. There must be a better way for what this costs.</li>
    <li> Not sure what to think...I will continue to use it but I am having a difficult time figuring out the rave reviews.</li>
    <li> Messy product.  I will have to try again.</li>
    <li> First of all, I have very sensitive skin (I&#x27;ve used Clinique and other specialty products for years), so for this lotion not to cause me a reaction is already pretty darn great.  However, I want to let any other new users of the lotion to know that the lotion did irritate my skin - but just the first couple of times - since then, no problems!    Next, it does seem to work.  I&#x27;ve been applying it twice a day for about two weeks now - my mind is clearer (an unexpected effect), less muscle cramps, less depression, and more energy.  I know it takes longer than two weeks to fully build up magnesium (a medical test showed my magnesium as very low), so I&#x27;ve ordered a second round of the lotion.  I&#x27;m hoping that this product will help build bone (I was diagnosed with osteopenia - pre-osteoporosis) and guard against heart problems (a family heritage thing), as well as contribute to general health.    I&#x27;ve had trouble taking any magnesium product orally, so that this lotion works for me is a great thing!</li>
    <li> Did not get much relief from the product. Also concerned about claims of possible cancer causing agents.</li>
    <li> when the legs start cramping - just rub this on.  My husband has been taking quinine and magnesium pills, but this is instant relief.</li>
    <li> I was happy to have found this product given that for a few weeks I was stuck with my own concoction of plain magnesium oil and body lotion in a very crude attempt to both replenish mag.levels while combatting dryness.Gladly Dr Shealy saw my desperation and came to my rescue,plus it&#x27;s also quite reassuring that he is a true expert in this field.This product is very convenient to apply,no scent,no residue etc. and pretty thick also.Being an athletic person my magnesium levels deplete faster than the average person so generally this product is right on the money.One area I would like to see improved is it&#x27;s ability to moisturize dry skin more thoroughly.As it is now,I still use a secondary lotion to completely moisturize certain areas.That&#x27;s more cosmetic but most importantly it does what it&#x27;s supposed to do in a very likeable manner,and that is to efficiently restore and maintain one&#x27;s magnesium levels thus improving ones general health and well being.Definitely a good investment.</li>
    <li> Husband and I have been using the lotion now for about a month.  The first improvement I noticed was the fact that my leg muscles were not sore after running.  I could always feel the tightness and soreness of my legs while walking during cool down after a run and when I get home from the gym.      I apply the lotion twice daily most days (morning and evening), and husband usually in the evenings.  He has noticed improved sleep quality. We also take magnesium oral supplements - but my research has shown that the oral supplements actual absorption is only about 60%.  We were falling short on our magnesium to calcium ratio recommended.      The lotion is a good addition to help us increase our magnesium levels.  The oral magnesium in large amounts tends to soften stools/cause bloating etc in some people.  The lotion does not appear to have any side effects for us.  It does sting temporarily if I apply it immediately after shaving my legs in the shower.  So I have adjusted my times when I apply the lotion to avoid this.    I gave the lotion 4 out of 5 stars because I feel the overall cost ($$) should be lower.</li>
    <li> My cousin the alternative medic recommended this for nighttime foot cramps. It works for me. Lotion is not greasy but takes a few minutes to dry.</li>
    <li> Lotion is good, low mag is a problem, but this isn&#x27;t the answer. There are much better options out there</li>
    <li> I bought this mostly to help with insomnia, and it didn&#x27;t disappoint - from the very first night after I started using it my sleep began to improve and has never gone back to what it was (4-7 hours of broken up sleep, sometimes so shallow I&#x27;d hesitate to call it sleep - more like dozing). I can now sleep 71/2 to 9 hours a night and even take naps occasionally without disrupting my night sleep. I&#x27;m pregnant, have 2 toddlers, and we recently moved to a new city and my husband got a new job, so LOTS of stress and changes - but again, since I&#x27;ve been using this I sleep deeply most nights (even at 7 months pregnant!). The only thing I don&#x27;t like about it ( I&#x27;m not sure it can be helped though), is that it leaves a film on my legs where I apply it that can become itchy and peels off when rubbed or scratched. Personally I find that to be a minor annoyance compared to the misery of insomnia - I still highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I could sell this product!</li>
    <li> I believe in Dr. Shealy. I eagerly ordered two bottles. I found the lotion sticky and tacky. I definitely want to wash it off 20 minutes after I put it on. Then last week my right shin had that tension it occasionally gets which icing helps calm. I put on this lotion and the tension/pain went away. I haven&#x27;t yet tried it on other pains and I don&#x27;t look forward eagerly to putting it on, yet I do have proof that it works and will keep both bottles and recognize I have a pain killing technique that might not be soothing, but it probably isn&#x27;t toxic either!</li>
    <li> Dr. Shealy&#x27;s Biogenics Magnesium Lotion is a great product for me because I have digestive issues that make it difficult to absorb magnesium from food or supplements, and for my mom, who found relief from arthritis pain.  This product is also great for preventing pain from strenuous or repetitive physical activity or, if I forget to apply it before, great for relieving pain resulting from physical activity.</li>
    <li> It felt awful on my skin,irritated and made my skin very dry.i couldn&#x27;t wait for 20 min to take a shower.i dont understand how people can leave this product on their skin wo wash it off.i am done w buying staff from amazon.its safer to bye in store even u pay more.some staff i bought fells completely difff after i bought them in the store.sorry but i can&#x27;t trust selling comp any more.</li>
    <li> I really like this lotion!  No oily residue, goes on nicely &amp; does the Job!</li>
    <li> Product relieves muscle pain and is an easy way to get maximum magnesium in the body. Will certainly order this product again.</li>
    <li> This is great for muscle aches.  Works really fast.  A+</li>
    <li> just ad will a little oil it is great!!</li>
    <li> A few things of importance: Most aches did disappear. It burns - do not put on sensitive skin or thinning skin or heavily used/washed skin (such as hands).  Also, my skin started to itch and was very dry for about a month after application. Made of parabens, which I had read about from other reviews, which was slightly disappointing news.  I expect more from a holistic doctor. This is not a &amp;#34;lotion&amp;#34; per se.  It&#x27;s more of a gel. Once product is gone, I will not repurchase because of the parabens and I hated the texture.</li>
    <li> Rub on your feet before you go to sleep, it really works! I have used it for several years and it works better for me than anything Ive ever tried!</li>
    <li> Good magnesium lotion but it does leave your hands and skin feeling &amp;#34;salty&amp;#34; similar to when you get out of the sea and it dries. Would recommend but prefer magnesium supplement, but use this as an alternative for specific aches and pains in knees, ankles, back, etc.</li>
    <li> great product and great price, we use it all the time and will continue to buy it and use it</li>
    <li> It seems to keep aches and pains down, easily applied, no stickyness, absorbed quickly. I&#x27;m hoping to convert others by giving for Christmas.</li>
    <li> Seems to help my issues some, but after using it on my chest for about 1.5 weeks it started to give me acne on my chest.  I never get acne and definitely not on my chest.  I stopped using it and after a few days the acne started to disappear.  After I use up this bottle I&#x27;ll likely just stick with my Epsom salt baths which is magnesium as well.  I buy it in bulk at my local Walgreen&#x27;s when they have sales and I stock up, so it ends up being cheaper and more relaxing without the side effect of acne.    Update: 5/29/11  I tried what one of the commenter&#x27;s said, and started moving the lotion around each day to different parts of my body.  That seems to be helping with the acne.  Since it helps me sleep, if I use at at night, and since I don&#x27;t have time to to take an Epsom salt bath every night I think I will order more since I&#x27;m getting low now.  I updated it to 4 stars from the 3 I gave it before.</li>
    <li> Have had a problem with night leg cramps for years.&lt;br /&gt;So far this product has helped so much. I get fairly quick relief.&lt;br /&gt;Hope it continues for this agonizing problem with few remedies.</li>
    <li> I have to just trust the magnesium is actually being delivered.  Let&#x27;s say it is, yay, because this is easy enough to apply, doesn&#x27;t sting too much, doesn&#x27;t smell at all, and best of all, no GI distress.  I&#x27;m also going to assume it&#x27;s working because as an odd \\&quot;side effect\\&quot; (was trying to treat migraine) i haven&#x27;t had any heart palpitations in two months.</li>
    <li> Hi, Everyone:  I ordered this because I have clinical depression and Dr. Norm Shealy&#x27;s site recommends increasing magnesium intake top help deal with it.  He claims the best way to absorb magnesium is through the skin. That may be true, but I have no proof in the form of a decrease in symptoms, as other commenters claim they have. It&#x27;s a very good lotion, in any case. It&#x27;s not oily or greasy at all, like magnesium oil is. In addition it does *not* sting like magnesium oil. The oil stings awfully when it gets into a cut (from shaving), or a bug bite, anyplace the skin has an opening caused by trauma. I use it as I would a good body lotion. As long as I&#x27;m absorbing more calcium, why not.</li>
    <li> I love the product and am very happy and satisfied. . . Will buy from seller again. . .I would give a 5 star rating. . . . Thank you</li>
    <li> Great for moisturizing and increase mag intake</li>
    <li> Think it is good idea to have liquid magnesium as a lotion, but do not like the &amp;#34;after feel&amp;#34; when it dries on  my skin. I will not buy it again.</li>
    <li> It may be too soon to assess , but i think it&#x27;s working ...some of the aches i experience in my legs seem to have lessened ! perhaps i will try the oil form next time !</li>
    <li> I have been using this lotion for over a year now to deal with back and hip pain.  I find it an excellent way to manage the pain esternally - without drugs.</li>
    <li> Great product. Helps to relieve muscle cramping and arthritis pain</li>
    <li> Good stuff. Could notice a decrease in my pain levels immediately after using.</li>
    <li> Always a good product.  Takes care of leg cramps during the night.</li>
    <li> this helped me sleep walk less then usual. but it&#x27;s pretty sticky and was getting all over my sheets if I put it on before bed. SO I had to start using it in the morning and really rubbing it in all the way.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll prolly get more when I run out.</li>
    <li> Good stuff. Really works on cramping issues. Just bought a bigger bottle to us all over.  If you have night cramps, I recommend this highly.</li>
    <li> This lotion goes on smooth not sticky.I can use 2 layers daily without it itching my skin,when I used 3 layers I had to shower.Over all it met my expectations.Great for sore muscles and cramps.</li>
    <li> A friend gave me a bottle of Dr.Sealy&#x27;s Mag lotion to try and I&#x27;ve just started using it. I have only used one teaspoon daily, either after my shower in the morning or at night before bed. It&#x27;s interesting- I&#x27;ve had no leg cramps when using it at night. (Used it four times). I have used a mag supplement with calcium and sometimes it helped and sometimes not. Also I have used CALM, a magnesium powder which is a very good supplement. But I am not consistent with taking CALM and the lotion is easier to apply and I can put it on the areas that cramp.&lt;br /&gt;I am pleased with the results so far and will continue to use it for awhile to see if it consistently helps rid the legs of muscle cramping. I was told it was kind of sticky but I do not have any stickiness after it drys. I believe it could be dependent on your skin condition. Mine is dry so it completely absorbs.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have restless leg when I use this.&lt;br /&gt;Restless leg is just crazy.</li>
    <li> When I put this on my legs for muscle cramps, it was sticky, itched and flaked off. I have been able to use it on my feet at night and then put socks on to keep it from getting all over the sheets. It does dry out my skin though. But note, I have sensitive skin so I&#x27;m not sure everyone would have that problem.</li>
    <li> works great!  Just had double knee replacement recently and it works very well to help limber them up</li>
    <li> I learned of Dr Shealy about 3 years ago through Caroline Myss. As stated above, I think he is  genius- waaay ahead of his time. I feel so lucky to have found him. This lotion is not for moisturizing- but instead to replenish the deficiency of magnesium in our bodies. Our farms are overused and therefore the soil is mag deficient. Magneisum is so vital for so many reasons. It helps menopausal symptoms, it helps our bones, it helps support our muscular activity. I would not go a day without it.  Dr Shealy has been recommending Vit D3 for over a decade by the way- long before any mainstream docs did- and now everyone agrees! Listen to him- he has so much to share. He is on the radio on Thursdays-and you can speak to him directly- and for free! Google him! :) Happy Life everyone!</li>
    <li> I was diagnosed with Fibromyalgia in August 2004, have tried soooo many things to help this.  Started to take Magnesium Citrate a few months back and that has helped a bit, but started this just a week ago and have noticed a difference. I am no longer in pain when I awake in the morning.  Can&#x27;t wait to see what a month feels like of using it.</li>
    <li> I really like this stuff,I cant take magnesium orally so this is a great solution</li>
    <li> I put Dr. Shealy&#x27;s lotion on when I get out of the shower.  So now I am certain I am getting enough magnesium.  Thanks</li>
    <li> I usually like this product, but when it arrived it was leaking.  I enjoy the feel of the lotion and the scent</li>
    <li> Good for muscle aches and restor magnesium balance. Like the consistency.</li>
    <li> I love this product&lt;br /&gt;it does not sting like the sprays.&lt;br /&gt;I bought a few bottle to give as gifts</li>
    <li> best way to get magnesium in your body</li>
    <li> This caused a stinging sensation for me as well as a rash.  I have tough skin and have never reacted to any topical lotions.</li>
    <li> I use this lotion on my legs at bedtime and find that it eliminates muscle twitches that sometimes occur.  I probably get enough magnesium in my diet for general purposes, but this has been a lifesaver and sleep saver.  Not sure of the rest of the hype about using it.  Can be very slightly irritating but if I can tolerate it, most people can.</li>
    <li> Experienced many physical benefits. Easy to apply, but spray sometimes clogs</li>
    <li> Stung when I rubbed it on my skin.</li>
    <li> I bought this second bottle of Dr. Shealy&#x27;s Biogenics Magnesium Lotion to have on hand when the first bottle which I bought 6 months ago runs out. Long lasting in volume and smooth to the touch without being greasy this lotion boosts my magnesium level. Each morning I apply it to my lower legs and feet - giving each foot a mini massage before my meditation. The application of this lotion is grounding and joyful.</li>
    <li> Dr. Shealy&#x27;s products and books are really great and do work.</li>
    <li> I found this in our bathroom and after reading the bottle I still have NO idea what this is used for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How could anyone forget to put that on their bottle???</li>
    <li> My husband suffers from fibromyalgia and Reynauds disease.  This is an awesome topical pain reliever.  Neck or back problems this will help a lot.</li>
    <li> I started using this lotion because I do have some hormonal imbalances. The first month I used it I was sleeping better and didn&#x27;t have the hormonal headaches I usually get. This month, I&#x27;m still sleeping much better but I have experienced slight headaches-but nothing like it used to be...I would say give it a try, it definitely can&#x27;t hurt!</li>
    <li> Love this product.  Massage it into sore tissue and it works like a miracle.&lt;br /&gt;Seller shipped quickly.</li>
    <li> it has stopped my leg cramps</li>
    <li> It does the job, but leaves a grainy residue behind</li>
    <li> I knew it would be a consistency of corn huskers oil.  So it is exactly like I thought it would be.  Works well.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for the reduction of cramps in my legs; it works.  This is a large bottle of lotion that should last a fairly long time and is well worth the investment.</li>
</ol>
