      <li>Great price for a good product</li>
      <li>Very good easy to use.</li>
      <li>Glad I decided to buy online!</li>
      <li>They&#x27;re also great when used as the first shave before using a multi-blade razor.  </li>
      <li>excellent price for a good sharp razor blade - &amp;#34;wally&#x27;s big-box&amp;#34</li>
      <li>Very smooth for course beards.</li>
      <li>I love using safety razors and one online post reccomended</li>
      <li>I love these razors.  </li>
      <li>BIC has more than met my expectations.</li>
      <li>I just hope they continue to make them!:)</li>
      <li>This razor is great for shaving large areas because the razor rinses easily and resists clogging.  </li>
      <li>some stores, this razor is becoming an endangered species, so I encourage buying these and keeping these great razors alive and well.  </li>
      <li>Tried and true, they get the job done!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s especially great for bald-headed folks who want to do the job easily and quickly, not having to worry about getting too close to irritate the skin.  </li>
      <li>They&#x27;re light and easy to travel with.  </li>
      <li>Use regularly, Gentle yet effective.</li>
      <li>These are essential; nothing makes your head pound like when it is the bottom of the ninth and your son is either the pitcher or the batter that will determine the win or lose.  </li>
      <li>We use for large areas to shave clients, mostly shoulders and backs for laser hair removal.</li>
      <li>great for the cheap price, but get you toilet paper ready for the nicks!</li>
      <li>Besides, multi-blades tend to clog quickly.  </li>
      <li>Good price and these single-blade wonders do the job as well or better for me than the much more expensive multi-blade razors and cartridge systems.  </li>
      <li>The only solution that would save me more money would be to just grow a beard.</li>
      <li>This was a good option in a disposable single blade, and so far has lived up to the reviews.</li>
      <li>put together local information (free from the chambers of commerce) and 1 or 2 of the things I am most likely to forget when traveling; Tylenol, Kleenex packets, razors, Wisp toothbrushes, bandaids, lens cleaning wipes, hand sanitizing wipes, rubber bands, safety pins,</li>
      <li>Back to comfortably shaving.</li>
      <li>I agree with other reviews, that those work better,  than the multi-blade razors.</li>
      <li>Each year I put together small welcome packets for visiting families for our minor league sports team.  </li>
      <li>I almost never cut myself with these (and do frequently with the newer razors which 5 + blades)  </li>
      <li>Very low cost and seem to be much appreciated.</li>
      <li>At one time, these were easy to find but no more.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not really sure what it is about them, but for me, they are the only razors that don&#x27;t cut me at all, and they shave very smoothly.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend these razors and use one daily.</li>
      <li>I can generally get two (maybe three)</li>
      <li>Not recommended if you have sensitive or dry skin.</li>

<li> The only &amp;#34;con&amp;#34; is that the design makes it difficult to access under and around the nose and hard-to-reach places, but they&#x27;re worth their weight in gold in the &amp;#34;home stretches&amp;#34;.  </li>
<li> These razors remove the tough stuff first</li>
<li> Again, they are single blade, but they get the job done.</li>
<li> I thought a single blade razor would reduce ingrown hairs, but these gave me razor burn and cuts like never before.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m a safety razor guy and realized that after shaving with a single blade, multi-blade disposable cartridges are rough on the face.</li>
<li> Unfortunately, I travel a lot and can&#x27;t carry my razor in my carry on (I rarely check luggage).</li>
<li> as expected whats to say about Bic shaving blades</li>
<li> This razor is the one of the few, if any, single-edge/blade razors to be found on the market.  </li>
<li> I usually get a couple of uses out of each blade, depending on the thickness of the hair or whiskers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> Getting hard to find in stores.</li>
<li> so your multi-blade razor is preserved by not having to do the hard labor of taking the initial cutting and dulling of the blade.  </li>
<li> I use another razor for delicate trimming.  </li>
<li> These are horrible.</li>

Thank you Amazon!&lt;br /&gt;I put together local information (free from the chambers of commerce) and 1 or 2 of the things I am most likely to forget when traveling; Tylenol, Kleenex packets, razors, Wisp toothbrushes, bandaids, lens cleaning wipes, hand sanitizing wipes, rubber bands, safety pins, Shout spot wipes, a pen and a notepad.  Very low cost and seem to be much appreciated.</li>
    <li> still havent opened them yet it will be a while before i have to think about buying any shavers again.</li>

    <li> I love these razors.  I can generally get two (maybe three) shaves out of one before throwing it in the trash.  I almost never cut myself with these (and do frequently with the newer razors which 5 + blades)  This has a simple design &amp; it gets the job done....I just hope they continue to make them!:)</li>
    <li> I use a single-blade razor and this brand does not disappoint.</li>
    <li> Very good easy to use. Excellent shave.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a safety razor guy and realized that after shaving with a single blade, multi-blade disposable cartridges are rough on the face. Unfortunately, I travel a lot and can&#x27;t carry my razor in my carry on (I rarely check luggage). This was a good option in a disposable single blade, and so far has lived up to the reviews.</li>
    <li> can&#x27;t beat the price or the shave</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not really sure what it is about them, but for me, they are the only razors that don&#x27;t cut me at all, and they shave very smoothly. I only buy these ones.</li>
    <li> After I ordered it, I found,  that you can buy those for 1/2 price at any store. Should have done my research. I agree with other reviews, that those work better,  than the multi-blade razors.</li>
    <li> For some reason I can&#x27;t find these anywhere in Los Angeles, and the knock-offs just will not do. Glad I decided to buy online! Back to comfortably shaving.</li>
    <li> great for the cheap price, but get you toilet paper ready for the nicks!</li>
    <li> Great price for a good product</li>
    <li> Bic Razors Do A GREAT Job ! ! ! . . . For A . . . Smooth-Knick-Free-Shave . . .</li>
    <li> BIC has more than met my expectations.</li>
    <li> Great for road trips with TSA issues.  I love using safety razors and one online post reccomended these are an alternative when doing the carry on bag.  perfect</li>
    <li> These are great! They came in 3 sets of 12 (that&#x27;s 36 total) and I just threw them in my luggage for college. They&#x27;ll last the quarter. Again, they are single blade, but they get the job done. They also come with protective plastic sleeves for the blades which is a plus (although you&#x27;ll find them with any disposable razors nowadays). Great value for what you&#x27;re getting.</li>
    <li> Greatest razor ever for me. Have tried others and keep coming back to this.</li>
    <li> Everything as promised....thank you....</li>
    <li> These are horrible. I thought a single blade razor would reduce ingrown hairs, but these gave me razor burn and cuts like never before. Not recommended if you have sensitive or dry skin.</li>
    <li> Great price. Use regularly, Gentle yet effective. We use for large areas to shave clients, mostly shoulders and backs for laser hair removal.</li>
    <li> excellent price for a good sharp razor blade - &amp;#34;wally&#x27;s big-box&amp;#34; stores are not carrying these anymore</li>
    <li> Great blades! Getting hard to find in stores. Very smooth for course beards.</li>
    <li> Tried and true, they get the job done!</li>
