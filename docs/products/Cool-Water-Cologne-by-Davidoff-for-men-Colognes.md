      <li>Love this men&#x27;s fragrance.  </li>
      <li>I just love it.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Both times I have gotten the genuine article at a price that is better than at the store.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
      <li>With shipping included the price was still $10 less than the best retail price.</li>
      <li>But i dont get it, the perfum is fine.</li>
      <li>Product was packaged securely and wrapped with bubble wrap to prevent breakage.&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend this over a store, just for the savings.</li>
      <li>Around the same time, I kept smelling a great cologne passing people on the sidewalk etc.</li>
      <li>After much research for the perfect gift for my teenage granddaughter&#x27;s boyfriend, I arrived at this.</li>
      <li>Not like the original.</li>
      <li>The Cool Water arrived on time.</li>
      <li>I will purchase all of my Cool Water online from now on.</li>
      <li>I  ordered the 2.5 size bottle to sample the smell of Cool Water.  </li>
      <li>On the heavier side as opposed to something light like citrus, but still not too much.</li>
      <li>fresh as the water, first time i buy it</li>
      <li>Maybe something&#x27;s up with my nozzle but each spray is pretty dense.  </li>
      <li>shipping was faster than expected, which is always nice.</li>
      <li>was looking for a fragrance with highest number of +ve reviews on Amazon and sure enough found cool-water, bought it...</li>
      <li>Ever notice how many reviews claim receiving a \\&quot;fake\\&quot; product and only have that one review by that reviewer?  </li>
      <li>When I first saw this cologne on display years ago, I didn&#x27;t like it and moved on.</li>
      <li>The cologne smells really great, but it doesn&#x27;t last very long.</li>
      <li>It has a masculine and very fresh smell.</li>
      <li>It smells really good, but the smell doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
      <li>Very masculine.&lt;br</li>
      <li>With cool water, I only need one.  </li>
      <li>No matter, this is a good (not great) scent.  </li>
      <li>Not really worth the price because you&#x27;re going to go through a bottle pretty quickly.</li>
      <li>Product arrived new in box (as advertised) within 5 days of placing order.</li>
      <li>I use about 3-4 sprays and it seems like the scent is completely gone after an hour or so.</li>
      <li>and they say it resembles Green Irish Tweed from Creed which is $100 plus more..</li>
      <li>/&gt;Recently, by accident, I sprayed it on a card at a store, but didn&#x27;t put it down right away when I realized my mistake.</li>
      <li>I am curious if the 4.5 ounce bottle which is way cheaper than stores and an amazing value but seems to be getting negative reviews on here, is authentic or a fake as a lot of reviews state.</li>

<li> but it doesn&#x27;t stay on for long - may be 3-4 hours.</li>
<li> I usually spray some on before work at 3 and get out around 10 and then newly purchased bottle from Amazon lasted just as long as the store bought.</li>

<li> I have bought at least 8 fragrances off Amazon (direct) and all of them were legit.</li>
<li> Usually I do 3 sprays to the upper chest.  </li>
<li> and i like it just like any other cologne that i have</li>
<li> Not sure I&#x27;d put this one in the 5 but definitely in 10.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BTW</li>
<li> I have a 2.5 ounce bottle previously purchased at a department store to compare it with.</li>
<li> After a few moments, I caught another whiff of it.</li>
<li> A few sprays</li>
<li> I expected it to stay for at least 8-10 hours.</li>
<li> My feeling is, a man should have at least 5 colognes for whatever mood you are in.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;m not good at describing scents, but I can say it is one of my favorites.</li>
<li> Smells awful!</li>

    <li> REAL COOL WATER REAL GOOD PRICE!</li>
    <li> Usually I do 3 sprays to the upper chest.  With cool water, I only need one.  Maybe something&#x27;s up with my nozzle but each spray is pretty dense.  No matter, this is a good (not great) scent.  It doesn&#x27;t have the refined subtlety of others.  Still a good one to have in the mix.  My feeling is, a man should have at least 5 colognes for whatever mood you are in.  Not sure I&#x27;d put this one in the 5 but definitely in 10.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BTW, I&#x27;ve noticed there is definitely a feedback war against Amazon fragrance sales.  Ever notice how many reviews claim receiving a \\&quot;fake\\&quot; product and only have that one review by that reviewer?  I have bought at least 8 fragrances off Amazon (direct) and all of them were legit.</li>
    <li> I just love it.&lt;br /&gt;I was looking for a fragrance with highest number of +ve reviews on Amazon and sure enough found cool-water, bought it... never to search again.. :-)</li>
    <li> I saw many bad reviews about this perfum. But i dont get it, the perfum is fine. It&#x27;s Original and makes me smell good... Chicks love it</li>
    <li> It is my springtime go-to cologne for work and play!!</li>
    <li> Amazing price on this.</li>
    <li> This is one of those fragrances that are here to stay, it smells really good, ideal for summer, it&#x27;s clean and fresh...women like it and they say it resembles Green Irish Tweed from Creed which is $100 plus more.. a must have for a summer scent in your collection</li>
    <li> The cologne smells really great, but it doesn&#x27;t last very long. I use about 3-4 sprays and it seems like the scent is completely gone after an hour or so. Not really worth the price because you&#x27;re going to go through a bottle pretty quickly.</li>
    <li> This is the second time I have purchased this from Amazon. Both times I have gotten the genuine article at a price that is better than at the store.&lt;br /&gt;The shipping was faster than expected, which is always nice. Product was packaged securely and wrapped with bubble wrap to prevent breakage.&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend this over a store, just for the savings.</li>
    <li> Found this cologne in the store and loved the scent but wanted to see if I could find a better price online. With shipping included the price was still $10 less than the best retail price. Product arrived new in box (as advertised) within 5 days of placing order. I will purchase all of my Cool Water online from now on.</li>
    <li> As a life long Cool Water wearer who normally purchases the cologne from department stores, I was skeptical about buying it on-line after reading all the reviews that said it was watered down or not authentic. I purchased the 2.5 ounce bottle regardless and notice no difference. I have a 2.5 ounce bottle previously purchased at a department store to compare it with. There&#x27;s also  no noticeable difference in it&#x27;s duration of how long it lasts. I usually spray some on before work at 3 and get out around 10 and then newly purchased bottle from Amazon lasted just as long as the store bought. I would buy this item again since it&#x27;s almost $10 - $15 dollars cheaper than from a store. I am curious if the 4.5 ounce bottle which is way cheaper than stores and an amazing value but seems to be getting negative reviews on here, is authentic or a fake as a lot of reviews state.</li>
    <li> I  ordered the 2.5 size bottle to sample the smell of Cool Water.  I found the best price on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  The Item was received on time and in good order. I receive complements on the smell of this product at the gym and out shopping .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  I would recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> Great smell at a great price</li>
    <li> Not like the original. Smells awful!</li>
    <li> Love this men&#x27;s fragrance.  One of my favorites.  It has a masculine and very fresh smell.</li>
    <li> its good and smells really awesome but it doesn&#x27;t stay on for long - may be 3-4 hours. I expected it to stay for at least 8-10 hours.</li>
    <li> The Cool Water arrived on time. It smells really good, but the smell doesn&#x27;t last long. I can&#x27;t smell it on my husband an hour after he puts it on. I know that I could 30 years ago.&lt;br /&gt;Bonnie</li>
    <li> After much research for the perfect gift for my teenage granddaughter&#x27;s boyfriend, I arrived at this. Score big for grandma! Besides it smells really good.</li>
    <li> When I first saw this cologne on display years ago, I didn&#x27;t like it and moved on. Around the same time, I kept smelling a great cologne passing people on the sidewalk etc. For some reason I thought it was Calvin Klein, but when I checked at a store, I found I was wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recently, by accident, I sprayed it on a card at a store, but didn&#x27;t put it down right away when I realized my mistake. After a few moments, I caught another whiff of it. It was great and was the scent I had been trying to find all this time. What good luck. Not only that, but it is available at a good price all over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got a bottle and use it often. A few sprays and I&#x27;m good to go. It lasts and lasts, but it is not overpowering. Great scent. I&#x27;m not good at describing scents, but I can say it is one of my favorites. On the heavier side as opposed to something light like citrus, but still not too much. Very masculine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> fresh as the water, first time i buy it and i like it just like any other cologne that i have</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my husband for Christmas and he loves it!!  Great smelling scent, came nicely packaged.&lt;br /&gt;Great Deal...</li>
