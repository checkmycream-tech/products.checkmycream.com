    <li> Love this stuff! Tames my naturally curly hair.</li>
    <li> Love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this foam is really keeps my hair straight and manageable and it also eliminates the Frizz.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  It makes my very curly hair shiny and smooth.  While you can use it to straighten out the kinks and curls by blowing or ironing, it also works very well at keeping well defined, bouncy, unfrizzy curls.  Just put it on and let your hair air dry.  Hair stays in place, even on windy days, yet is still soft and touchable.  My hair doesn&#x27;t even frizz up during intense workouts.</li>
    <li> I need product for my hair, but so much of it contains alcohol and further dries my already dry hair. ISO Tamer Foam Smoother does not contain alcohol and still does a super hair of styling my hair and holding the style all day. I&#x27;m totally delighted with it.</li>
    <li> I found this three years ago and I don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;d do without it!  I used to have the most awful looking hair.  I&#x27;d straighten it, but as soon as I stepped out of the door, my hair was fuzzy, curly, and frizzy again.  I had accepted this would be part of my life and then I moved to a new town and found a new hairstylist a few months later.  She let me try this, and now my hair looks like the models on tv.  My hair stays straight, even on rainy days.  It makes it smooth and shiny.  I love this product.  It seems that the curling iron or straightening iron REALLY bring out this products ability.  My hair looks great when I just use a blow dryer, but it looks fabulous when I use the straightening iron too.  And then all that hard work isn&#x27;t down the drain when I get out of my car to go to work!  I can&#x27;t find any stores in my area that carry it and I don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;ll do if they ever stop carrying it.  It is a miracle product.</li>
    <li> I have course wavy hair, and this product is great.  You do have to use a lot of product, but along with a gel, this does wonders for my hair.</li>
    <li> My wife ordered this as a replacement for a product she had used for about a year.  She says it is wonderful because it gives shape and body as well as softness to her hair without leaving a residue.  A little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> I used this product at my friends house and loved it. I have been buying it for 4 years. A little goes a long way, so it last for a long time. Buy this if your hair get those little frizzy things or you live in a humid climate, it works.</li>
    <li> I have very thick 4b hair texture and no longer use chemical straighteners. I only blow dry and flat iron my hair once a month or so and I&#x27;m so happy I found this because it has made my blowouts look amazing! My hair looks and feels silky smooth like it did when I used to get relaxers. It also helps it fight frizz a little longer but (not by very much honestly)&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s expensive but I think it&#x27;s worth it.&lt;br /&gt;The foam comes out of the bottle very quickly and you really don&#x27;t need much product on your hair so it will likely last a while. It has a nice smell, nothing too overpowering but slightly sweet.

I will definitely keep this product on hand for all my blow drying and flat ironing needs especially on natural hair.</li>
    <li> If you have curly or frizzy hair, this is the best product I have ever found. I have tried my entire life to find a great product like this. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> Fast and as promised.</li>
    <li> I am growing out a perm and picked this up to help straighten my hair.  I was weary that it would be a waste of money but it absolutely works!  My hair is fairly thick so I am used to needing a lot of product but a little goes a long way with this stuff.  The foam expands and spreads easily through hair.  I use a large round brush to straighten hair but it does not take a lot of effort to get my hair straight when i use the foam.  I can even go without the round brush to get the kinks out.  Definitely worth the money!</li>
    <li> This was recommended by my hairdresser to help straighten my unruly curly hair. I have been using it for years and love it.</li>
    <li> I have very wavy hair and thid product works great. In fact I purchased two cans at the same time so I would not run out</li>
    <li> I love this foam.  It isn&#x27;t sticky and stiff.  It gives me control over my curls., For once I&#x27;m in charge, not my hair.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t impressed with this product. It leaves white residue on the hair. I tried it on wet hair and on dry hair - both cases I ended up with white \\&quot;dust\\&quot; on my hair which couldn&#x27;t be remove without re-washing my hair. Big disappointment.</li>
    <li> Great for naturally curly hair.  I just hope it continues to work as It is hard to determine what ingredients it consists of.</li>
    <li> I have wavy/curly hair and it can get frizzy if I don&#x27;t have some type of gel or mousse in it. I was introduced to Iso Tamer Foam about 2 years ago and I haven&#x27;t used any other hair product since! All I need is a small sized squirt and it does the job. I get compliments on my hair all the time! It is very inexpensive and you just cannot find a better frizz tamer/curl enhancer anywhere!</li>
    <li> This product does exactly what it&#x27;s description says.  I have thick, frizzy, unruly, and dyed hair and regular mousse didn&#x27;t do it.  I blow dry my hair and this product calms the hair into luscious texture.  My style looks polished and stays that way especially on humid days.  I love it![[ASIN:B0002Z8MRG ISO Tamer Foam Smoother 6.7oz]]</li>
