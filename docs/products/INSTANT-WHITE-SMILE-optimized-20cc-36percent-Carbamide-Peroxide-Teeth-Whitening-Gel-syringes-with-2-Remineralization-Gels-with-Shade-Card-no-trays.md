### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>These are the best I&#x27;ve tried I noticed a difference immediately..</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase.</li>
      <li>:-D</li>
      <li>Awesome product.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used one of the two tubes and my teeth look great.</li>
      <li>Works great.  </li>
      <li>Great product for the money.</li>
      <li>The remineralizer works great too.  </li>
      <li>and I see amazing results.</li>
      <li>I had to buy my own</li>
      <li>That would probably take two more sessions.</li>
      <li>For the price it was okay.</li>
      <li>but I can&#x27;t be sure.</li>
      <li>When I use the gel, I make sure that there isn&#x27;t an excess on the gums.  </li>
      <li>36% is strong so be sure to wipe your gums after application.</li>
      <li>This product is easy to use and works as described.  </li>
      <li>You&#x27;ll want custom-molded trays to use peroxide this strong.</li>
      <li>Great product reasonably priced for the quantity and fast shipping!</li>
      <li>There were two syringes filled with (hopefully whitening product) and a piece of folded paper with instructions and \\&quot;no</li>
      <li>I already had custom trays, so this was a very economical way to get whiter teeth.  </li>
      <li>The gel neutralizes itself over time, so most of the bleaching effect occurs in the first hour or two.</li>
      <li>The brightest tone won&#x27;t be bright enough for some.  </li>
      <li>cool beans.</li>
      <li>It arrived quickly.  </li>
      <li>I received it quickly in the mail, but there is one problem.  </li>
      <li>No matter what you look like, white teeth will make you look better!  </li>
      <li>I was excited to use this after having read all the positive reviews.</li>
      <li>This is a powerful, but not overpowering gel.</li>
      <li>They&#x27;re absolutely worth the expense</li>
      <li>Works fast!  </li>
      <li>Wearing overnight is not advisable; I wouldn&#x27;t go higher than 15% solution for that.  </li>
      <li>I received exactly what was promised.  </li>
      <li>The product came quickly with clear instructions.</li>
      <li>&quot; It really looks fishy....</li>
      <li>Thanks</li>
      <li>My teeth weren&#x27;t very yellowed to begin with</li>
      <li>When I tell them what I used and how much it cost they are amazed.</li>
      <li>It was my fault (having accidentally putting too much in)</li>
      <li>If you do avoid those beverages, particularly in the first few days after bleaching, your teeth may maintain the new shade for a year or more.  </li>
      <li>36% is strong and can burn your gums, so use carefully and sparingly.</li>
      <li>Not as strong as I expected.</li>
      <li>My teeth are sensitive, and the remineralization gel did not help much.</li>
      <li>The shade chart in this product won&#x27;t be useful if your teeth are already fairly white.</li>
      <li>Ok so round 2.</li>
      <li>My results were very good from this single session starting from an average shade for a non-smoker, though not Hollywood white.</li>
      <li>Not sure what to do - will probably return to be on the safe side....</li>
      <li>The gradients on the brighter side of the scale are too far apart, so even a visible shift may not register a new tone.</li>
      <li>With my custom trays, I had no trouble with two back-to-back bleaching sessions, each for 90 minutes.</li>
      <li>Possibly old stock?</li>
      <li>So far I&#x27;ve used this product 3 days in a row and there is a noticeable difference in my teeth.</li>
      <li>I did 2 sessions so far.</li>
      <li>* Peroxide gels like this and the in-office dental equivalent are, far and way, the preferred method of teeth whitening.</li>
      <li>Cheap heat-and-wear mouthpieces won&#x27;t fit properly nor provide gum shielding, and are therefore not good enough.</li>
      <li>The only difference is that this one has tiny bubbles in it instead of being clear, but that doesn&#x27;t affect the results at all.</li>
      <li>The remineralization gel in this kit was not necessary, but I have used it in the past and it&#x27;s worth having if you&#x27;ve never bleached before and haven&#x27;t discovered your tolerance.  </li>

<li> It didn&#x27;t stay long enough for me to see any results.</li>
<li> Works wonderfully!Results are beuatiful and long lasting...</li>
<li> Even though the hydrogen peroxide is supposed to be stronger with shorter wear time,  it doesn&#x27;t last as long as the carbamide, so I&#x27;ve read.</li>
<li> Luckily no major harm was done-</li>
<li> There&#x27;s enough gel in this kit to last at least ten whitening sessions.</li>
<li> If you take nospecial care to avoid dark beverages (soda, wine, coffee), the results will last about six months.</li>
<li> A few thoughts on this product and teeth-whitening in general:  </li>
<li> Really cuts down on the sensitivity issue common after bleaching.  </li>
<li> It didn&#x27;t whiten as well as i hoped and my teeth are not very stained as it is.</li>
<li> I tried again a few days later carefully using a small amount, yet it still got out of the retainer from my saliva and the taste was back.</li>
<li> It came in a hand written- small package with regular postage stamps.  </li>
<li> The only irritation was where a small amount of gel had touched my gums.</li>
<li> Just be very careful not to get the bleach on your gums.  </li>
<li> I noticed mild cold sensitivity that lasted an hour or two after bleaching.</li>
<li> I think it may have made my teeth slightly whiter</li>
<li> In my experience, whitening toothpaste is for maintenance only, whitening strips are worthless, and no drugstore kit gives results worth mentioning.</li>
<li> The gel did burn my gums a little.</li>
<li> My teeth are not ordinarily prone to cold or heat sensitivity.</li>
<li> and I usually trust Amazon products-</li>
<li> I have purchased whiteners in the past.  </li>
<li> Changes become less dramatic with additional sessions.</li>
<li> I figured it would make my teeth slightly lighter, but I was wrong.</li>
<li> and I wouldn&#x27;t buy this product, or any serious gel, without them.  </li>
<li> but the fact that it had such a horrible bitter taste and tingly sensation was not enjoyable.</li>
<li> First time I used it the gel got all over my mouth after putting in the retainer and it was awful!</li>
<li> However I was not happy using it.</li>
<li> Im not impressed.</li>
<li> Kinda disappointed!!!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> So far I&#x27;ve used this product 3 days in a row and there is a noticeable difference in my teeth. The product came quickly with clear instructions.</li>
    <li> I smoke and my teeth were really yellow, can see results using this product after just a couple of uses, and after several days my teeth are really white, used it twice a day.</li>
    <li> Great product reasonably priced for the quantity and fast shipping! Works wonderfully!Results are beuatiful and long lasting... I will definitely order again!</li>
    <li> I received it quickly in the mail, but there is one problem.  It came in a hand written- small package with regular postage stamps.  There were two syringes filled with (hopefully whitening product) and a piece of folded paper with instructions and \\&quot;no shade card.\\&quot; It really looks fishy.... I am a big internet shopper and I usually trust Amazon products- but I am sceptical about this product...  The return address is a PO Box from Elizabeth, NJ. Not sure what to do - will probably return to be on the safe side.... Kinda disappointed!!!</li>
    <li> A few thoughts on this product and teeth-whitening in general:  * Peroxide gels like this and the in-office dental equivalent are, far and way, the preferred method of teeth whitening. In my experience, whitening toothpaste is for maintenance only, whitening strips are worthless, and no drugstore kit gives results worth mentioning. The latter two simply don&#x27;t merit your time.  * You&#x27;ll want custom-molded trays to use peroxide this strong. They&#x27;ll cost $300 to have done on-site with a dentist or around $50 as a send-away kit with molding material. Cheap heat-and-wear mouthpieces won&#x27;t fit properly nor provide gum shielding, and are therefore not good enough. Custom trays will last for years. They&#x27;re absolutely worth the expense and I wouldn&#x27;t buy this product, or any serious gel, without them.  * There&#x27;s enough gel in this kit to last at least ten whitening sessions. If kept in a refrigerator, the gel will expire in about two years. Bleaching sessions can be for any duration from 30 minutes to multiple hours. The gel neutralizes itself over time, so most of the bleaching effect occurs in the first hour or two. Wearing overnight is not advisable; I wouldn&#x27;t go higher than 15% solution for that.  * This is a powerful, but not overpowering gel. With my custom trays, I had no trouble with two back-to-back bleaching sessions, each for 90 minutes. The only irritation was where a small amount of gel had touched my gums. My teeth are not ordinarily prone to cold or heat sensitivity. I noticed mild cold sensitivity that lasted an hour or two after bleaching. The remineralization gel in this kit was not necessary, but I have used it in the past and it&#x27;s worth having if you&#x27;ve never bleached before and haven&#x27;t discovered your tolerance.  * My results were very good from this single session starting from an average shade for a non-smoker, though not Hollywood white. That would probably take two more sessions. Changes become less dramatic with additional sessions. If you take nospecial care to avoid dark beverages (soda, wine, coffee), the results will last about six months. If you do avoid those beverages, particularly in the first few days after bleaching, your teeth may maintain the new shade for a year or more.  * The shade chart in this product won&#x27;t be useful if your teeth are already fairly white. The gradients on the brighter side of the scale are too far apart, so even a visible shift may not register a new tone. The brightest tone won&#x27;t be bright enough for some.  All considered, a product I would buy again.</li>
    <li> I was using before the whitening gel from my dentist and paid a fortune. It was a time consumming process, wearing the tray over night was nothing pleasent. In this case is only 20-30 minutes at a time. I used it four times and I see amazing results. Great product for the money.</li>
    <li> Works great.  I have a custom-made tray.  When I use the gel, I make sure that there isn&#x27;t an excess on the gums.  The purpose is to whiten teeth, not irritate gums.  Have not had a problem with this technique.</li>
    <li> This product is easy to use and works as described.  My teeth are sensitive, and the remineralization gel did not help much.</li>
    <li> These are the best I&#x27;ve tried I noticed a difference immediately..</li>
    <li> it works. idk about the mineral part as i don&#x27;t notice any sensitivity but my teeth are whiter. cool beans.</li>
    <li> It arrived quickly.  I received exactly what was promised.  I&#x27;ve used one of the two tubes and my teeth look great. No sensitivity; no gum irritation.  I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> 36% is strong so be sure to wipe your gums after application. I leave it on for about 30-40 minutes at a time and only have to whiten twice to get a shade or two lighter.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work for me.  Didn&#x27;t bubble, so I bet it was expired.  I&#x27;m trying the carbamide 35%,  Just ordered it today.  Even though the hydrogen peroxide is supposed to be stronger with shorter wear time,  it doesn&#x27;t last as long as the carbamide, so I&#x27;ve read. So I will give the CP 35% a try (even though I also read its made with urea!) I want white teeth!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried several brands,  so this review will be found elsewhere.</li>
    <li> I was excited to use this after having read all the positive reviews. However I was not happy using it. I have a teeth molded retainer so I used that to put this whitening gel in. First time I used it the gel got all over my mouth after putting in the retainer and it was awful! It was my fault (having accidentally putting too much in) but the fact that it had such a horrible bitter taste and tingly sensation was not enjoyable. It didn&#x27;t stay long enough for me to see any results. Ok so round 2. I tried again a few days later carefully using a small amount, yet it still got out of the retainer from my saliva and the taste was back. That time it was in for almost 30 minutes. I think it may have made my teeth slightly whiter but I can&#x27;t be sure. My teeth weren&#x27;t very yellowed to begin with so I don&#x27;t know. Overall I really did not enjoy using this product. I actually prefer whitening strips and toothpastes.</li>
    <li> I recommend this to everybody. I figured it would make my teeth slightly lighter, but I was wrong. It made my teeth substantially whiter. I have had people ask me what dentist I used to whiten my teeth. When I tell them what I used and how much it cost they are amazed. Awesome product.</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t whiten as well as i hoped and my teeth are not very stained as it is. I did 2 sessions so far. Im not impressed. The gel did burn my gums a little. Luckily no major harm was done- I dont recommend this. It didnt even ome with trays- I had to buy my own</li>
    <li> This made my teeth very white in just 3 uses of about 30 - 40 minutes per session.  The remineralizer works great too.  Really cuts down on the sensitivity issue common after bleaching.  I already had custom trays, so this was a very economical way to get whiter teeth.  Just be very careful not to get the bleach on your gums.  36% is strong and can burn your gums, so use carefully and sparingly. No matter what you look like, white teeth will make you look better!  :-D</li>
    <li> Not as strong as I expected. Possibly old stock? For the price it was okay. No fear of bleach burning gums.</li>
    <li> I have purchased whiteners in the past.  Those were applied at bed time and left in overnight.  I found that to tune up the teeth it only required one or two applications.  I have already done this product five times and still have not achieved the desired result.  I will purchase another brand in the future.  Thanks</li>
    <li> Works fast!  I will definitely be a return customer!!</li>
    <li> No complaints from me. Way cheaper than the dentists provided ones. The only difference is that this one has tiny bubbles in it instead of being clear, but that doesn&#x27;t affect the results at all.</li>
