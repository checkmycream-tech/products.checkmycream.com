      <li>But I feel more like it&#x27;s a glue</li>
      <li>We both love the way it looks when it&#x27;s on, but it peels off with in about 30 min of wear.  </li>
      <li>my girls love it</li>
      <li>But other than that, it looks great and stays on well, and looks great.</li>

      <li>Shipped VERY QUICKLY.  </li>

      <li>This glitter liner in Crystal Silver is so fun!  </li>

      <li>Well overall its a very good product the only problem that I do have with it</li>
      <li>Just the right amount needed on the brush.</li>
      <li>It looks great, but it ALWAYS flakes off right away, and I mean as soon as it dries, in a matter</li>
      <li>I really like the glitter liner!</li>
      <li>Receive many compliments when i wear this liner on the corner of my eye and inner bottom lid!</li>
      <li>This eyeliner applies easily and last all day.</li>
      <li>I am very dissappointed  by that.  </li>
      <li>I like the way the crystal liner looks, but for some reason when I first apply it, it gives a burning sensation, but it goes away after it dries... as someone who rarely has issues with skin products, i find that a little off-putting.</li>
      <li>I bought this as an eyeliner, however when it arrived it states on the product that it is not for use near the eyes.....</li>
      <li>the reason I&#x27;m only giving it four is because it stings when applied fast across the eyelid .</li>
      <li>it is to literally make lines NEAR your eye , NOT &#x27;eyeliner&#x27; that you can put anywhere ...</li>
      <li>It looks pretty by itself, but I like to wear it over black liquid liner to really make it stand out.  </li>
      <li>It does take a few coats to get a lot of sparkle, but it adds some fun to your eyes.  </li>

<li> and it do not stay on as long as the silver one</li>
<li> i let them dry fully before applying each additional coat.</li>
<li> the loose flakes end up in my eyes and makes my &amp;#34;hot&amp;#34;</li>
<li> &amp;#34;do not apply to your eyes&amp;#34; obviously becuase it contains glitter , which is not safe to get into your eyes there for it is not to be used as an EYELINER in the sense of the inner lash line and tear ducts it will burn !&lt;</li>
<li> many people give this product a bad review for that reason but</li>
<li> what a drag-</li>
<li> any smart human would know you do not put glitter n chemicals where it can enter your actual eye, keep it away from leaking into it ..like duhhh!</li>
<li> Half of my eye flaked off in 6 minutes.</li>
<li> I like Nyx products normally, but this one is a fail.</li>
<li> Product is a little small but just what I expected!</li>
<li> Does the job, but it wears  of after few hours</li>
<li> It stings less when applied slowly.  </li>
<li> Hardly even stayed on for pictures after it took 15 minutes to spread out.</li>
<li> Hard to put on and spread.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s an eyeliner, but on the cap is a confusing warning stating &#x27;Not intended to be used around the eye area&#x27;.</li>
<li> wear contact lenses and seeing a warning like this on what&#x27;s supposed to be an eyeliner is a bit startling.</li>
<li> i dont usually do sparkly stuff bc its annoying when it gets all over ur face</li>

    <li> I like Nyx products normally, but this one is a fail. It&#x27;s an eyeliner, but on the cap is a confusing warning stating &#x27;Not intended to be used around the eye area&#x27;. Uhm..what?...it says it&#x27;s an eyeliner, but it warns not to use around the eyes. Kind of defeats the whole purpose of the product.&lt;br /&gt;I wear contact lenses and seeing a warning like this on what&#x27;s supposed to be an eyeliner is a bit startling. In the trash this went.</li>
    <li> Does not stay on for even 10 minutes. Hard to put on and spread. Flakes off in chunks. Half of my eye flaked off in 6 minutes. Hardly even stayed on for pictures after it took 15 minutes to spread out.</li>
    <li> Product is a little small but just what I expected! Love the way it looks in my eyes and it doesn&#x27;t come off right away.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a fine product. But I feel more like it&#x27;s a glue</li>
    <li> I really like the glitter liner! It&#x27;s inexpensive but good quality! It adds some extra glam to my make up!</li>
    <li> Shipped VERY QUICKLY.  It was here in just two days!  It looks cute, and is fun to wear.  It does take a few coats to get a lot of sparkle, but it adds some fun to your eyes.  Worth it!</li>
    <li> Great product, great price, quick shipping. I wear this every time I go out with friends! I put it over my black eyeliner and it looks awesome :) Thank you!!!</li>
    <li> this is so cute! i put on multiple coats. i let them dry fully before applying each additional coat. i dont usually do sparkly stuff bc its annoying when it gets all over ur face but it dries quick and looks great ... one time i wore it when i went out dancing, it never moved and i was sweatin. i even fell asleep in it that night (dont judge) and still woke up cute.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;its easy to make wings with the brush too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;also i thought in trying to wipe it off id get sparkles on my face forever, but they all come off easily with makeup remover pads.</li>
    <li> 1. This a good product.&lt;br /&gt;2. Yes it says &amp;#34; eye-liner&amp;#34; AND &amp;#34;do not apply to your eyes&amp;#34; obviously becuase it contains glitter , which is not safe to get into your eyes there for it is not to be used as an EYELINER in the sense of the inner lash line and tear ducts it will burn !&lt;br /&gt;It says eye liner becuase it is to literally make lines NEAR your eye , NOT &#x27;eyeliner&#x27; that you can put anywhere ...&lt;br /&gt;Too many people give this product a bad review for that reason but any smart human would know you do not put glitter n chemicals where it can enter your actual eye, keep it away from leaking into it ..like duhhh!</li>
    <li> Love this product!  Just the right amount needed on the brush.</li>

    <li> Does the job, but it wears  of after few hours</li>
    <li> I am so dissapointed in this product! It looks great, but it ALWAYS flakes off right away, and I mean as soon as it dries, in a matter os seconds- the loose flakes end up in my eyes and makes my &amp;#34;hot&amp;#34; look goofy with watering eyes turning bright res and a bit swollen- what a drag- it sounded great, but doesn&#x27;t stay on. Oh well- you get what you pay for, and this was cheap</li>
    <li> I was excited to get this liner, but after a while it starts peeling off.. It&#x27;s ok and looks beautiful for a little bit. The only downside is the peeling.</li>
    <li> I bought this as an eyeliner, however when it arrived it states on the product that it is not for use near the eyes.....&lt;br /&gt;That would have been helpful to know when I was considering the purchase this item.</li>
    <li> I bought this eyeliner for my daughter thinking it would be nice for a teenager.  We both love the way it looks when it&#x27;s on, but it peels off with in about 30 min of wear.  I am very dissappointed  by that.  What&#x27;s the point of putting it on if it&#x27;s not going to last the hour?</li>
    <li> This eyeliner applies easily and last all day. I would give it five stars but the reason I&#x27;m only giving it four is because it stings when applied fast across the eyelid . It stings less when applied slowly.  Other than that I&#x27;m happy with what I paid for.</li>
    <li> I love it! Receive many compliments when i wear this liner on the corner of my eye and inner bottom lid! Stays all day!</li>
    <li> Used my NYX glitter line for the 4th of July. Everyone loved my makeup</li>
    <li> Well overall its a very good product the only problem that I do have with it is it peels very easy and it do not stay on as long as the silver one but I love it my girls love it so I will most defently be buying more ;)</li>
    <li> This glitter liner in Crystal Silver is so fun!  It looks pretty by itself, but I like to wear it over black liquid liner to really make it stand out.  It stays on well and is easy to remove.  I love NYX!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s eyeliner... and it has a warning on the cap that says not to use around the eye area... So I haven&#x27;t even used it. It was packaged nicely though.</li>
    <li> This stuff Burman your eyelids after putting it on. But other than that, it looks great and stays on well, and looks great.</li>
