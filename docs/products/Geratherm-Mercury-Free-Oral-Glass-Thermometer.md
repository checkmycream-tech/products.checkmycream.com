### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>I just havent found the digitals to be reliable and this is the best option I found</li>
      <li>I took this thermometer with me to Africa since it reads celsius and fahrenheit and doesn&#x27;t require batteries - should have been ideal.</li>
      <li>I am actually fairly happy with it</li>
      <li>I used this thermometer for 2 years, and I was happy with it.  </li>
      <li>This thermometer works great and you don&#x27;t have to worry about the batteries dying.  </li>
      <li>many reviewers on Amazon, I bought this thermometer with the best of intentions.</li>
      <li>(Kids get their hands on things--that&#x27;s why we don&#x27;t own a gun!)    </li>
      <li>Because of its size, I don&#x27;t think it would be particularly good for a child under about age 7-8.     </li>
      <li>That&#x27;s rare and wonderful these days.</li>
      <li>Right now, I am happy we did!  </li>
      <li>I need to order a couple more!</li>
      <li>When I first used it, I was impressed.  </li>
      <li>this one is better and quieter!</li>
      <li>It was packaged nicely upon receipt and I have not damaged it.  </li>
      <li>it kind of spreads out and sticks.  </li>
      <li>What kind of thermometer won&#x27;t &#x27;reset&#x27;</li>
      <li>Most of these reviews are people&#x27;s reviews of their own intelligence.&lt;br /</li>
      <li>Mercury is poisonous, and I&#x27;m cheap, so the mercury-free non-digital model seemed like a good option.</li>
      <li>On the package it has environmentally friendly, mercury-free, no where does it mention the accuracy, good reason, it&#x27;s junk.</li>
      <li>/&gt;This is a good, cheap, safe analog thermometer.</li>
      <li>If one does have arthritis, neither this nor a mercury thermometer are easy to use, and you&#x27;re probably best off with a high rated electronic probe.</li>
      <li>Very accurate readings.</li>
      <li>very light and very accurate.</li>
      <li>&gt; This thermometer works perfectly if used properly.</li>
      <li>I WILL ORDER MORE OF THIS ITEM.  </li>
      <li>okay.  </li>
      <li>Sure, that could be off, but those devices have been standardized over decades.</li>
      <li>Most of us have or have had \\&quot;silver fillings\\&quot; which are infused with mercury.</li>
      <li>If it reads 98.6 or whatever your healthy temperature may be (some people</li>
      <li>I shake it some more.</li>
      <li>Its plastic case fits nicely and holds it securely.</li>
      <li>The thermometer is scaled in Fahrenheit on top and Celsius on bottom.   </li>
      <li>Okay, makes sense.</li>
      <li>This is a great alternative to older mercury thermometers.</li>
      <li>I then used the ear probe (both ears) and surprisingly it, too, was actually very close to the Hg (0.2 degrees difference between the 2 ears;</li>
      <li>This was inexpensive and is easy to use.</li>
      <li>It is a skill that relies on a strong \\&quot;flick\\&quot; of the wrist.  </li>
      <li>So, for a one time use, it was fine, but not for long-time use.  </li>
      <li>You can stick this in your mouth for minutes on end and it will not be accurate.  </li>
      <li>is that because the thermometer is filled with a mercury substitute?&lt;br /&gt;3.  </li>
      <li>For the price, it is fantastic.</li>
      <li>Would you trust your child&#x27;s health to a cheap, inaccurate thermometer?  </li>
      <li>Yes, this thing is cheap -</li>
      <li>Thermometer fits securely in the included carrying case.</li>
      <li>If the effort of complaining that the thermometer can&#x27;t be used had been applied to learning how to use it, we&#x27;d have more useful comments here.&lt;br /&gt;Hint</li>
      <li>I purchased this thermometer because it was advertised as mercury free &amp;</li>
      <li>Plus it&#x27;s made in Germany, and you know how crafty those Germans are.</li>
      <li>It is cheap and a step backwards from the mercury thermometer.</li>
      <li>So far, so good.</li>
      <li>The result is quick response time and easy reading.</li>
      <li>All the accuracy, but without the significant health risks if it breaks.</li>
      <li>I love this thermometer, durable and very accurate just like the old mercury but without the danger.  </li>
      <li>Easy to use and great for those who like the \\&quot;old fashioned\\&quot; thermometers that tend to be more accurate than the digital ones.</li>
      <li>and I was a bit nervous about how I would clean it up.  </li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re not sick, take your temperature.  </li>
      <li>cheap and useful to keep at home.</li>
      <li>The problem is you can&#x27;t really get a hold of mercury thermometers any more, so I found this alternative.  </li>
      <li>but really if you eat fish - chances are you will be much more exposed to it then by using a thermometer</li>
      <li>You can use this thing the right way and it will not give you an accurate reading.  </li>
      <li>No batteries required, internally consistent, and easy to use.  </li>
      <li>I am happy to say they were exactly right, it cleaned up well with a liquid cleanser (a spray) ... with a dry towel or just water</li>
      <li>You&#x27;ll be lucky if it reaches your frenulum.&lt;br /&gt;2.  </li>
      <li>HOWEVER, on both occasions the Geratherm now measured a full two (2) degrees HIGHER than the Hg!</li>
      <li>I was hesitant based on the 3/5 star average, but am happy I went with this.  </li>
      <li>No one dies of this type of stuff and we need to be more responsible and  willing to accept some miniscule risk in order to keep proven products in the market place</li>
      <li>I get a much better and faster reading on a digital thermometer I got for free from my PCP.</li>
      <li>Not even worth this inexpensive price the liquid was \\&quot;frozen\\&quot; in place no matter what I did to it</li>
      <li>I thought this would be a better option for safety reasons, since we have 3 young children.  </li>
      <li>it came right</li>
      <li>Is the temperature right on the money?  </li>
      <li>the price was right.  </li>
      <li>Most thermometers like this only need 5 minutes for a true Auxiliary read but this one needs 10 minutes.</li>
      <li>This time, I am going to buy the Geratherm brand which gets better reviews, but costs a few cents more.</li>
      <li>It is very accurate and unlike a digital if I use it and get a temp..</li>
      <li>#3: Holding it in your mouth is not difficult if you put it in your mouth.</li>
      <li>In several ways this represents a noticeable improvement over Hg thermometers (for its intended use), but it remains a precision tool that does what it&#x27;s supposed to, competently, reliably, without gimmicks.</li>
      <li>Who knows--At this very moment, I&#x27;m not worried that my children have mercury poisoning!    </li>
      <li>If you are old school like me, or just don&#x27;t trust newer digital thermometers, this is a great alternative to the old mercury thermometers.</li>
      <li>&quot; The device&#x27;s consistency suggests that the liquid expanded properly &amp; consistently in response to my temp.</li>
      <li>The first I bought from Wal-mart and immediately tried to use it when I got home.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know about you, but I want to be exact</li>
      <li>First, I put them both under my tongue simultaneously.</li>
      <li>If it reads a couple of degrees higher, then make the adjustment when you use it--like you would if you took your childs temp under the arm.  </li>
      <li>And the good correlation with other devices (particularly the electronic probe, which I&#x27;ve calibrated against known standards - freezing &amp; boiling water, &amp; it&#x27;s accurate) suggests that my old thermometer is the correct one.     </li>
      <li>SAME EXACT PROBLEM!!!  </li>
      <li>This method has worked for me everytime, and now I love this cheap little thing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Also important to note is that this \\&quot;new\\&quot; type of glass thermometer is MUCH wider and heavier than the old mercury ones.  </li>
      <li>It was good enough for all of us who used them before the advent of digital thermometers.</li>
      <li>Returned the first one and bought a second one and guess what, the second was off by more!)</li>
      <li>the size of the Hg thermometer, which made it a little more cumbersome to hold under the tongue, but not impossible.</li>
      <li>/&gt;The whiskey-flavored ice cream cost me four bucks for a large scoop.</li>
      <li>Maybe I&#x27;m just set in my ways, but I really dislike the newer digital thermometers, even though they are very quick at giving readings.</li>
      <li>(considering how hard it is to find good oral manual thermometers now).  </li>
      <li>The one I bought is a whole degree off.</li>
      <li>so it&#x27;s ready for use.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I REALLY needed a reliable way to track a fever.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would really reccomend this despite having to figure out the cleaning issues...</li>
      <li>stars, because the manufacturer should really give clearer directions on the packaging.</li>
      <li>I;m not real crazy about</li>
      <li>It finally broke when I put it back in its plastic case backwards, which is a very easy mistake to make.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Very accurate readings. Easy to use and great for those who like the \\&quot;old fashioned\\&quot; thermometers that tend to be more accurate than the digital ones.</li>
    <li> I took this thermometer with me to Africa since it reads celsius and fahrenheit and doesn&#x27;t require batteries - should have been ideal. Unfortunately the first time I got sick, it would not work. This was additionally bad since I was coming down with malaria and desperately needed an accurate temperature. Needless to say I threw it away as soon as I returned from the hospital. It is absolutely not dependable making it a complete waste of time and money.</li>
    <li> The instructions say it has to be stored upright. If it is stored lying down for more than a day (like, say, if you are sick and can barely reach to put it on your bedside table) the liquid will &#x27;freeze&#x27; in place and not move or become fragmented, rendering the thermometer useless. I went through two before wising up. It is also uncomfortably shaped and hard to keep in your mouth. Skip this one.</li>
    <li> Bought at Walgreens.  After using it twice, no amount of shaking will get it off of 102 degrees.  A complete waste of time and money.  Avoid.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s almost impossible to shake down so it&#x27;s ready for use.&lt;br /&gt;I tried it multiple times and finally discarded it.  Not worth the money</li>
    <li> After years of buying digital thermometers that sometimes worked and sometimes didnt I got sick of wasting my money on them.  I went looking for a non-digital and found this one.  It looks like the old fashioned mercury thermometers  altho it is a bit wider and a tiny bit awkward to keep in your mouth.  HOWEVER...  despite this I wouldnt go back.  It is very accurate and unlike a digital if I use it and get a temp..and than immediately do it again, i will get the same temp.  Unlike the digitals which had wildly different temps...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also want to say my son broke one on a ceramic bathroom floor and I was a bit nervous about how I would clean it up.  The silver doesnt *ball* up like mercury...it kind of spreads out and sticks.  Almost looking like I had silver plated the tile.  I checked the makers website and looked for an MSDS on toxicity and cleaning.  I am happy to say they were exactly right, it cleaned up well with a liquid cleanser (a spray) ... with a dry towel or just water it just spread around but with a spray cleanser it came right up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would really reccomend this despite having to figure out the cleaning issues...I just havent found the digitals to be reliable and this is the best option I found</li>
    <li> I purchased this thermometer because it was advertised as mercury free &amp; the price was right.  I like the accuracy &amp; consistency of the glass &amp; mercury (hg) ones, and I thought this would be a better option for safety reasons, since we have 3 young children.  Right now, I am happy we did!  Just this evening, my daughter got ahold of it and tried to imitate me shaking it--right up against the kitchen counter! (Kids get their hands on things--that&#x27;s why we don&#x27;t own a gun!)    Glass and (whatever the faux mercury is) went everywhere on our hardwood floors!  When the silver stuff lands, it tends to stay in little splashy puddles.  **Tip:  Do yourself a favor, and pinch it up rather than wipe it--it will smear if you do this, and although it will come up after being smeared, it&#x27;s a bit harder to clean up once it dries.  It&#x27;s sort of like gold leaf that you use with crafts when smeared.  Is the temperature right on the money?  Who knows--At this very moment, I&#x27;m not worried that my children have mercury poisoning!    If you&#x27;re not sick, take your temperature.  If it reads 98.6 or whatever your healthy temperature may be (some people vary)then it works.  If it reads a couple of degrees higher, then make the adjustment when you use it--like you would if you took your childs temp under the arm.  Mine was extremely accurate--while it lasted!</li>
    <li> After becoming disappointed with many digital thermometers, I set out to find a good old fashioned mercury thermometer.  The problem is you can&#x27;t really get a hold of mercury thermometers any more, so I found this alternative.  I was hesitant based on the 3/5 star average, but am happy I went with this.  I bought 2, just to check them and compare.    Pros:  - Reliable  - Non-electric (No having to track down batteries when you need it)  - Simple (shake down, take temp, done)  - Low cost    Cons:  - Slightly difficult to read (have to twist to get right angle)  - Large compared to old oral mercury thermometers, would be tougher on kids    I am actually fairly happy with it (considering how hard it is to find good oral manual thermometers now).  Despite the couple of negatives listed above, I would still recommend it.  But as other posters have mentioned, make sure to compare it to another thermometer before relying solely on it to ensure that there weren&#x27;t any manufacturing problems, and that it reads correctly.    And just a hint, if you&#x27;re having a tough time reading it, tilt the angle a little bit.  The long blue line will have a shorter silvery line on it where the temperature reads.  The blue line extends the whole length of the thermometer, and is not the temp indicator.</li>
    <li> It deserves no stars. It simply does not work. You shake it down. Place it in your mouth and it goes up to the same temperature, 98 degrees, no matter who uses it. I bought it to manage my low thyroid. It is worthless. It was packaged nicely upon receipt and I have not damaged it.  I would NOT recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> You can use this thing the right way and it will not give you an accurate reading.  You can stick this in your mouth for minutes on end and it will not be accurate.  It is cheap and a step backwards from the mercury thermometer. I have checked this thermometer (I checked two. Returned the first one and bought a second one and guess what, the second was off by more!) against an expensive reference and it has come up short of my real temperature by as much as 1.5 degrees. I don&#x27;t know about you, but I want to be exact and know I have a fever. Would you trust your child&#x27;s health to a cheap, inaccurate thermometer?  I know I wouldn&#x27;t. Save your money and get a more expensive thermometer that is accurate.</li>
    <li> Most thermometers like this only need 5 minutes for a true Auxiliary read but this one needs 10 minutes. I;m not real crazy about but since it is only for me I keep using it.</li>
    <li> I love this thermometer, durable and very accurate just like the old mercury but without the danger.  You don&#x27;t need an expensive digital theremometer for accurate temps...this one is better and quieter!</li>
    <li> Walmart sells this for a buck and a half and even at that price it&#x27;s a rip off.  As noted by other reviewers the marker is stuck at the top of the range and has resisted all efforts to bring it down to room temperature.  I&#x27;ve even placed it in the refrigerator where it hasn&#x27;t budged.  Even if it worked it&#x27;s uncomfortable to keep in the mouth as it always feels like it&#x27;s slipping out, hence you tend to grab it with your teeth which is probably not a good thing.    It&#x27;s now almost impossible to find a standard glass mercury thermometer as an alternative to the junk currently in the marketplace.  I know mercury is poisonous, but I also know that generations of families used oral mercury thermometers and I don&#x27;t remember an epidemic of broken ones poisoning the population or polluting the environment.  I would contend more environmental damage is caused by the production of digital thermometers than all the standard models ever produced. Most of us have or have had \\&quot;silver fillings\\&quot; which are infused with mercury. No one dies of this type of stuff and we need to be more responsible and  willing to accept some miniscule risk in order to keep proven products in the market place, otherwise we&#x27;re going to be continually inundated with useless pieces of junk being pawned off on the public at inflated prices.</li>
    <li> Based upon my experience, I cannot recommend this thermometer because it is too difficult to shake the silver column down. The shipping carton in which I received the thermometer was quite hot when it came in the mail and the liquid silver had risen to the top of the tube, past 108F. This is when I discovered how tough it was to shake the silver down. Over a period of days of snapping the thermometer with my wrists, I finally lowered the column to 97.2F, but couldn&#x27;t budge it after that. However, I&#x27;m still trying!</li>
    <li> I first bought a battery operated thermometer, which worked fine, BUT the battery went dead and I didn&#x27;t have a screw driver tip small enough to remove it.  Wouldn&#x27;t you think they&#x27;d include one?  Nope.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I bought this to replace it because I couldn&#x27;t wait.  Looks similar to the old mercury ones, but without the mercury.  After taking a reading, the reading remains!!  No amount of shaking (snapping your wrist like one did with the old mercury thermometers) will budge the reading.  So I went back 2 days later and exchanged it for another one.  It has the same problem!  I shook it for 100 times and it barely moved down more than a couple of marks.  (Each mark is 2/10 of a degree.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is WORTHLESS!  DON&#x27;T BUY IT!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(I&#x27;ve always wondered why there isn&#x27;t a zero star rating -- or even a minus rating, which this thing deserves.)</li>
    <li> Not even worth this inexpensive price the liquid was \\&quot;frozen\\&quot; in place no matter what I did to it I could not get it to move just a complete waste of money and resources.</li>
    <li> I used this thermometer for 2 years, and I was happy with it.  I believe it was accurate, and very consistent, although it was a little hard to read (harder than most mercury-types).  It finally broke when I put it back in its plastic case backwards, which is a very easy mistake to make.  It is designed to fit in the case only one way, and the glass breaks very easily if you insert it the wrong way.  This time, I am going to buy the Geratherm brand which gets better reviews, but costs a few cents more.</li>
    <li> I WILL ORDER MORE OF THIS ITEM.  INSTRUCTOR REQUESTED ORAL THERMOMETERS TO TEACH THE CLASS TO READ ORAL/MANUEL IN THE EVENT THOSE ELECTRONIC DEVICES ARE UNAVAILABLE.</li>
    <li> We&#x27;ve bought just about every brand of digital thermometers out there.   The last one we bought worked for 1 week, and now won&#x27;t even register ANY temp! The digital ones read something different every time, and are often out of batteries... or display \\&quot;Err\\&quot;.      I REALLY needed a reliable way to track a fever.  I went and got this, and have not been disappointed!  It reads consistently (tested by shaking down and taking temp. consecutively) and it&#x27;s battery never dies!      Word of Warning: Most people are not used to shaking down glass thermometers.  It is a skill that relies on a strong \\&quot;flick\\&quot; of the wrist.  People with wrist problems may find it difficult, if not impossible to get it to shake down appropriately.  (I don&#x27;t have those problems, and after 2 days of monitoring my temp, my wrist is a bit sore) I couldn&#x27;t imagine a child under 13 or so actually getting this to reset.  The thermometer is easiest to shake down when the green cap is left on the end (it gives you help holding onto it).  In addition, it may help protect the glass if it gets dropped.    Also important to note is that this \\&quot;new\\&quot; type of glass thermometer is MUCH wider and heavier than the old mercury ones.  It may not fit a child&#x27;s mouth right.  We don&#x27;t have this problem (yet!), but I could see it being a problem.      For adults, or children under supervision, I would heartily recommend this thermometer.</li>
    <li> This product was shipped to me not in working order.    There is a little bubble in the glass that does not allow the \\&quot;non-mercury\\&quot; liquid to rise.    Waste of my time &amp; money! Wish I could have given it ZERO stars!</li>
    <li> would recommend this product for any emergency kit. the product is stable. no contamination of other products if it gets broken.</li>
    <li> After searching high and low for an old fashioned mercury oral thermometer - I realized they just do not sell them anymore.  Too bad.  I am not a fan of mercury but really if you eat fish - chances are you will be much more exposed to it then by using a thermometer anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I picked this one up since the digital one I had really is not useful for me - I rarely get sick - and checking your temperature every 4 or 5 years - well the battery is dead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Closing in on 15 minutes and I see I am above the normal temp.  I actually have no idea what my true temp is since I do not trust this thermometer at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are sick holding this in your mouth for 15 minutes will not be fun - and you may still not know if you are running a fever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will continue my quest for an old fashioned thermometer. :(</li>
    <li> 1.  It&#x27;s supposed to be oral?  Then why is the shaft of the thermometer so short?  You&#x27;ll be lucky if it reaches your frenulum.&lt;br /&gt;2.  It&#x27;s hard to shake it down so that it goes below 98.6.  We were never able to achieve this:  is that because the thermometer is filled with a mercury substitute?&lt;br /&gt;3.  We used it for weeks before we accidentally figured out how to get the casing off.</li>
    <li> Most of these reviews are people&#x27;s reviews of their own intelligence.&lt;br /&gt; This thermometer works perfectly if used properly. If the effort of complaining that the thermometer can&#x27;t be used had been applied to learning how to use it, we&#x27;d have more useful comments here.&lt;br /&gt;Hint #1: If 3 or 4 shakes don&#x27;t zero the thermometer, you&#x27;re doing it wrong. 100 wrong shakes won&#x27;t improve your result, or teach it a lesson. Learn how to do it right.&lt;br /&gt;Hint #2: What it reads at room temperature is irrelevant. Freezer temperature is irrelevant. The only temperatures this thermometer will register are in the range for which it was designed. That it doesn&#x27;t do what you expect is not its fault, it&#x27;s yours for expecting it.&lt;br /&gt;Hint #3: Holding it in your mouth is not difficult if you put it in your mouth. The tip is narrow to transmit heat rapidly to the bulb, not constrain how you use it. The glass envelope is entire; you could put the whole thing in your mouth if you had to. (Don&#x27;t. But do put in enough to hold the oval body with your lips.)&lt;br /&gt;Hint #4: As with all such thermometers, the column has a constriction inhibiting fluid retraction. Every reading is the maximum since it was last reset, and that reading will persist indefinitely until either exceeded or reset. That&#x27;s not a failing; it&#x27;s by design.&lt;br /&gt;Hint #5: The fluid is a mostly gallium/indium/tin alloy, silver in color, that fits entirely in the bulb &amp;#60;33°. When the thermometer is properly reset and ready, no silver will be visible above the constriction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a good, cheap, safe analog thermometer. The thermometer itself is thin and plain, but it&#x27;s attached to a flat card marked with the temperature gradations, then ensconced in a glass envelope that protects it from trauma and insulates it from ambient heat. The bulb appears relatively massive. The result is quick response time and easy reading. A magnifier is molded into the thermometer, but less dramatically than with Hg thermometers sofinding the correct viewing angle is easy. Marks are 0.1° increments, far enough apart to easily distinguish; conventional normal (37°) is red. Its plastic case fits nicely and holds it securely. In several ways this represents a noticeable improvement over Hg thermometers (for its intended use), but it remains a precision tool that does what it&#x27;s supposed to, competently, reliably, without gimmicks. That&#x27;s rare and wonderful these days.</li>
    <li> This was inexpensive and is easy to use. I don&#x27;t worry about breaking it.</li>
    <li> old technology (just simple oral thermometer). cheap and useful to keep at home.</li>
    <li> Quite a mouthful, but safer than glass.</li>
    <li> Yes, this thing is cheap - but I knew that when I bought it. For the price, it is fantastic. You just need to learn how to use it properly. I have found that trying to shake down the thermometer after use can be difficult, so here&#x27;s a pro tip I got. Put it in a sock, tip down, and swing it in a circle for several seconds. The centrifugal force will help it &amp;#34;reset&amp;#34;. This method has worked for me everytime, and now I love this cheap little thing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4 stars, because the manufacturer should really give clearer directions on the packaging.</li>
    <li> This thermometer is a modern version of the old mercury-filled oral thermometers.  No batteries required, internally consistent, and easy to use.  The thermometer is scaled in Fahrenheit on top and Celsius on bottom.   My only complaint with this product is that the thermometer widens about one inch past the bulb which can make it a little bit difficult to grip with your lips and teeth.  Thermometer fits securely in the included carrying case.</li>
    <li> Hard to read the temperature, hard to shake down.  Like that it is mercury free but would explore other options.</li>
    <li> The one I bought is a whole degree off. On the package it has environmentally friendly, mercury-free, no where does it mention the accuracy, good reason, it&#x27;s junk.</li>
    <li> very light and very accurate.,much better than digitals I have used  in the past!!! I need to order a couple more!</li>
    <li> I bought this thermometer at CVS a few weeks ago.  When I first used it, I was impressed.  Temperature 99degrees.  For the 2nd use, I couldn&#x27;t get the \\&quot;mercury\\&quot; to go lower than 99degrees of the earlier reading.  Still, I tried it again.  101degree temp this time; that&#x27;s about how I was feeling, so I think it worked okay.  Still, I couldn&#x27;t get the silver stuff to go down!  I shook it for about a total of 5 minutes, but no movement.  I am used to shaking down a regular mercury thermometer (which my husband recently dropped), so I know I used enough force.  We put in ice water for a while, but no movement.  I put it in hot water, and it still moved upward, it just won&#x27;t move down.  So, for a one time use, it was fine, but not for long-time use.  Perhaps it was just this particular item, but it is going back to the store.</li>
    <li> I bought two of these.  The first I bought from Wal-mart and immediately tried to use it when I got home.  I shook the thing for at least five minutes and no movement.  I thought it was me so I had my brother try to no avail.  So I figured, ok I just got a bad one.  Next day I went to Walgreens and bought one.  As soon as I came home I tried to use it.  SAME EXACT PROBLEM!!!  Extremely frustrating!  I&#x27;m still in search of a manual thermometer so I can take basal temps to determine my thyroid function.  Either way, both of them got returned.  Big. waste. of. time. and. money.</li>
    <li> I  purchased this thermometer at the recommendation of my naturopath. It is awkward to keep in your mouth because the portion you place in your mouth is quite short.  Also, the rather wide body of the thermometer makes it difficult to get the thermometer far enough under the tongue to get a good reading.  I used the thermometer several times and couldn&#x27;t get the substance in the thermometer to budge, no matter how much I shook it.  It also takes forever.  4 minutes seems like an eternity when you have to use a hand to keep the thermometer in your mouth. I get a much better and faster reading on a digital thermometer I got for free from my PCP. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t get the non-mercury thermometer to go down to a below-normal level so that I could register a proper temperature. Shaking it down like the instructions said only made it separate and get all patchy inside, but wouldn&#x27;t register a temperature. Then it broke and got silver goo all over everything that stained my carpet and my fingers. Sucks.</li>
    <li> This is too difficult to read.  Battery powered fever thermometers inevitably suffer dead batteries before they are needed, and new batteries cannot be installed.  To what foreign country must I go to buy an old mercury fever thermometer with large, easy-to-read digits?</li>
    <li> This is a duplicate review, as this device is listed in a couple of places on Amazon.  I had high hopes for this thermometer, after reading a medical article comparing it with standard mercury (Hg) thermometers in a clinical trial. All the accuracy, but without the significant health risks if it breaks. Well, I still have an \\&quot;old fashioned\\&quot; Hg thermometer, in addition to an electronic probe and an ear device from a major manufacturer (for the home, not professional market).     When I purchased this, I compared it to the Hg thermometer, since I have one and I was curious about the new Hg substitute. First, I put them both under my tongue simultaneously. This one read about 2 degrees lower than the Hg standard. I thought that its larger size might have allowed air to get by my lips &amp; cool it. I then did two back-to-back measurements; Geratherm, Hg; Geratherm, Hg. Four minutes each, all at rest, one immediately after the other, and always placing them in the same location. Both devices were \\&quot;internally\\&quot; consistent - that is the Hg gave the same temp both times, sequentially, as did the Geratherm. So far, so good. Consistency is necessary in a measuring instrument. HOWEVER, on both occasions the Geratherm now measured a full two (2) degrees HIGHER than the Hg! NOT good! I then checked my temp using the oral electronic probe; it was 0.2 degrees off from the Hg. I then used the ear probe (both ears) and surprisingly it, too, was actually very close to the Hg (0.2 degrees difference between the 2 ears; average 0.3 degrees off from Hg, just a bit lower otic (ear) than oral).     For this reason, I&#x27;m returning it, and I&#x27;m going to try another one. I suspect that it&#x27;s a manufacturing defect explained by the construction of this thermometer - it&#x27;s a glass tube within a second glass housing, and there&#x27;s a paper scale behind the capillary tube containing the liquid. If that paper is not placed properly, the reading will be \\&quot;off.\\&quot; The device&#x27;s consistency suggests that the liquid expanded properly &amp; consistently in response to my temp. My old Hg thermometer has the typical printing on the glass. Sure, that could be off, but those devices have been standardized over decades. And the good correlation with other devices (particularly the electronic probe, which I&#x27;ve calibrated against known standards - freezing &amp; boiling water, &amp; it&#x27;s accurate) suggests that my old thermometer is the correct one.     Other comments - I didn&#x27;t find it particularly worse than the old standard to \\&quot;shake down;\\&quot; each took the same # of shakes to return to baseline. If one does have arthritis, neither this nor a mercury thermometer are easy to use, and you&#x27;re probably best off with a high rated electronic probe. Also, the outer glass housing is much larger (about 3X) the size of the Hg thermometer, which made it a little more cumbersome to hold under the tongue, but not impossible. Because of its size, I don&#x27;t think it would be particularly good for a child under about age 7-8.     Hope this helps other users. I am concerned about this, especially as a medical professional, because not everyone has a mercury thermometer to compare against. This 2 degree difference could mean a LOT if you&#x27;re using this in a \\&quot;sick\\&quot; situation (e.g. deciding if your older child can go to school or not). I plan on contacting the manufacturer about this.</li>
    <li> I work in a laboratory and take temperatures of things all. day. long.  Since they&#x27;ve gotten rid of mercury, I have yet to find an at home thermometer that works.  This thermometer is impossible to shake down.  I actually brought it into work and put it in a centrifuge (12,000 rpms) and it STILL has the blue what-ever-it-is throughout the entire tube.  What kind of thermometer won&#x27;t &#x27;reset&#x27; when spun at 12,000 rpm????</li>
    <li> This is a great alternative to older mercury thermometers. Having grown up in the 60&#x27;s, mercury thermometers were the only game in town. Maybe I&#x27;m just set in my ways, but I really dislike the newer digital thermometers, even though they are very quick at giving readings. If you are old school like me, or just don&#x27;t trust newer digital thermometers, this is a great alternative to the old mercury thermometers. It&#x27;s all I use and I trust the results. What&#x27;s the problem with waiting a couple of minutes for a temperature reading anyway? It was good enough for all of us who used them before the advent of digital thermometers.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never before made a purchase and immediately regretted it. Except maybe the time I ordered whiskey-flavored ice cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like many reviewers on Amazon, I bought this thermometer with the best of intentions. My girlfriend is sick with the flu tonight. I stopped by Walgreens to pick up some NyQuil and figured while I was there I ought to get a thermometer so I could read her temperature. Mercury is poisonous, and I&#x27;m cheap, so the mercury-free non-digital model seemed like a good option. I&#x27;m saving the earth AND saving money! Plus it&#x27;s made in Germany, and you know how crafty those Germans are. So I brought it home and read the directions. Shake until the liquid goes down. Okay, makes sense. I shake it. I shake it some more. Maybe I&#x27;m getting the angle wrong? I shake it again. And again. I shake as hard as I can, from every angle imaginable, and then I give up. The liquid is not going to go down, no matter what I do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What the hell, I try putting it in my mouth for a few minutes just to see what happens. The meter doesn&#x27;t move at all. Something is wrong. Terribly wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The whiskey-flavored ice cream cost me four bucks for a large scoop. I have just paid eight dollars for a piece of plastic that cannot fulfill even its meager purpose of telling me how warm a thing is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have some four letter words for you, R G Medical.</li>
    <li> This thermometer works great and you don&#x27;t have to worry about the batteries dying.  This will always be there for you when you need it.</li>
