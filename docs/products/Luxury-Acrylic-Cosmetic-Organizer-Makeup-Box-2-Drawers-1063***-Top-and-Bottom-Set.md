      <li>The material is good!</li>
      <li>This was a very good quality item and fits perfect on the top of my daughters vanity.</li>
      <li>This is a great make up organizer.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m happy with my purchase.</li>
      <li>My daughter loved the set for her dresser.</li>
      <li>Dimensions fit perfectly on the corner of my counter.  </li>
      <li>I love this!</li>
      <li>Love this!</li>
      <li>I love it!</li>
      <li>I really liked this product.</li>
      <li>Love it looks gre a t on my counter.</li>
      <li>Received it today and I love it.</li>
      <li>so if I pull a drawer and it sticks, the top piece just slides off.</li>
      <li>I love it, but it came cracked on one corner...</li>
      <li>Otherwise, it&#x27;s okay.</li>
      <li>like how I can remove the top piece of it.</li>
      <li>If I had more make up</li>
      <li>I think it&#x27;s okay.</li>
      <li>I could barely fit some of my make-up in it!</li>
      <li>other than that it the perfect size</li>
      <li>It has helped me keep my makeup organized and easy to reach as I do not have drawers in my bathroom.</li>
      <li>The quality is good but the price is too high for this quality</li>
      <li>However, mascara etc fits just fine in the drawers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Not as large as I thought it would be, but still a really nice sized makeup holder.</li>
      <li>Fit about 0.1 percent of what I thought it would.</li>
      <li>Yeah its small but perfect for me</li>
      <li>I should have read the item description more as this isn&#x27;t nearly as big as I need it to be to hold all of the make up I own for a make up junkie like me, but if you need something compact and simple, this is still cute and will do the job for those who only wear everyday-simple wear :-)</li>
      <li>The drawers stick and the top and bottom just sit on top of each other</li>
      <li>This is exactly what I was hoping it would be.</li>
      <li>The quality of these is great, but they were much smaller than I expected!</li>
      <li>I use this to hold my most basic everyday makeup essentials and it looks really nice sitting in my bathroom.</li>
      <li>Great service...wish it was a little bigger.</li>
      <li>Fast shipping</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t have much products</li>
      <li>Smaller than i thought nice for lipstick and short brushes.</li>
      <li>I found the cosmetic organizer to be much smaller than I expected, though it was of good quality</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s good for just everyday makeup!!</li>
      <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think it looks better without the black drawer liners</li>
      <li>I have it on my bathroom counter and it holds most of my everyday makeup.</li>
      <li>other than that much wont fit and the storing on the right is too short to actually hold brushes which is why i bought it.</li>
      <li>I gave it to my 10yr old!</li>
      <li>its small but still love it</li>
      <li>Thought it would be bigger (that&#x27;s what she said ;)</li>
      <li>Smaller than I expected but great for small stuff</li>
      <li>I wish the top sat a little more firmly on the base, but it looks great and holds enough.</li>
      <li>Its so small cant even fit my brush set</li>
      <li>Way to small and cheap looking.</li>
      <li>Looks big in the picture but very small its more of a jewelry box I think.</li>
      <li>Too small should have read the discripion more carefully</li>
      <li>Its a cute case but is very small in size!</li>
      <li>One thing that disappointed me is that the square slots on the top are kind of shallow.  </li>

<li> Well, you can technically put mascara in and it won&#x27;t fall out - but it looks messy/stupid to have it leaning against a teeny little edge.  </li>
<li> it&#x27;s a little smaller than I expected</li>
<li> Holds next to nothing and is not cheap.</li>
<li> Not a whole lot of room unless you have a few select items you always use.</li>
<li> then they expected, as long as you look at the measurements and are aware of the size I don&#x27;t think you will be disappointed.</li>
<li> They work well for standard size lipsticks, but they&#x27;re too shallow for mascara, eye liner, etc.  </li>
<li> but hers did not have the little liners.</li>
<li> and I use it everyday</li>
<li> Way too small.</li>
<li> Small and glamorous.</li>
<li> Way too small for that price</li>
<li> To pricey for it small size.</li>
<li> This item is to small</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Dimensions fit perfectly on the corner of my counter.  Considering buying another set of drawers to stack if possible.  Could use extra drawer space.</li>
    <li> I think it&#x27;s okay. The drawers stick and the top and bottom just sit on top of each other so if I pull a drawer and it sticks, the top piece just slides off. It is roomy enough to hold a lot of makeup but the drawers need to be deeper.</li>
    <li> like how I can remove the top piece of it. its small but still love it</li>
    <li> Way too small for that price</li>
    <li> Much smaller than I had hoped. Otherwise, it&#x27;s okay.</li>
    <li> Great service...wish it was a little bigger.</li>
    <li> Wayyyyyy smaller then expected.</li>
    <li> Not a whole lot of room unless you have a few select items you always use.</li>
    <li> So small, drawers are Jenny. Not happy.</li>
    <li> I love it, but it came cracked on one corner... other than that it the perfect size</li>
    <li> Its so small cant even fit my brush set</li>
    <li> Received it today and I love it. Yeah its small but perfect for me I don&#x27;t have much products but if you have a lot it&#x27;s good for just everyday makeup!!</li>
    <li> Way too small. Hardly fits anything.</li>
    <li> This item is to small you can not fit much makeup on it I would not recommend it if you have a lot of makeup</li>
    <li> This is perfect for all of my make up. I don&#x27;t have a lot but it&#x27;s enough to need some sort of organization. If I had more make up I would like one a little bigger though.</li>
    <li> Too small should have read the discripion more carefully</li>
    <li> This was a very good quality item and fits perfect on the top of my daughters vanity.</li>

    <li> I should of read the reviews before I purchased this product, it&#x27;s way to small!!</li>
    <li> This product really helped organize makeup on my small bathroom counter. (I appreciate the other reviewers who pointed out that this product is smaller than other similar-looking products on amazon. I wouldn&#x27;t have realized it otherwise.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think it looks better without the black drawer liners and so I just took those out.  One thing that disappointed me is that the square slots on the top are kind of shallow.  They work well for standard size lipsticks, but they&#x27;re too shallow for mascara, eye liner, etc.  Well, you can technically put mascara in and it won&#x27;t fall out - but it looks messy/stupid to have it leaning against a teeny little edge.  However, mascara etc fits just fine in the drawers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> To pricey for it small size.</li>
    <li> My daughter loved the set for her dresser. Added to her room and it&#x27;s style</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t wear a lot of makeup so this is a perfect size for me! It holds all of my brushes, powders, and lotions. It has helped me keep my makeup organized and easy to reach as I do not have drawers in my bathroom.</li>
    <li> Wife loves it, just what she needed</li>
    <li> Its a cute case but is very small in size! I could barely fit some of my make-up in it! The material is good! But way to small! I gave it to my 10yr old!</li>
    <li> I really liked this product. Only thing I thought it would be larger in size. I would recommend this product .</li>
    <li> Much smaller than expected!</li>
    <li> Way to small and cheap looking. Fit about 0.1 percent of what I thought it would.</li>
    <li> This is exactly what I was hoping it would be. Some of the reviews mention that it was smaller then they expected, as long as you look at the measurements and are aware of the size I don&#x27;t think you will be disappointed. I use this to hold my most basic everyday makeup essentials and it looks really nice sitting in my bathroom.</li>
    <li> A LOT smaller than I expected for the price. My mother actually came in and told me that she bought the same one at Marshalls for like $5-$8 but hers did not have the little liners. I should have read the description closer.</li>
    <li> I found the cosmetic organizer to be much smaller than I expected, though it was of good quality</li>
    <li> This is a great make up organizer. I have it on my bathroom counter and it holds most of my everyday makeup. I love it!</li>
    <li> The quality of these is great, but they were much smaller than I expected!</li>
    <li> Thought it would be bigger (that&#x27;s what she said ;) but it&#x27;s enough for the makeup I wear on a regular basis.</li>
    <li> I should have read the item description more as this isn&#x27;t nearly as big as I need it to be to hold all of the make up I own for a make up junkie like me, but if you need something compact and simple, this is still cute and will do the job for those who only wear everyday-simple wear :-)</li>
    <li> Smaller than i thought nice for lipstick and short brushes. other than that much wont fit and the storing on the right is too short to actually hold brushes which is why i bought it.</li>
    <li> The quality is good but the price is too high for this quality</li>
    <li> What a disappointment. This thing is TINY. In the picture it looks 3X&#x27;s the size it actually is. Holds next to nothing and is not cheap. NOT HAPPY with this product at all.</li>
    <li> Waist of money!!!! Do not buy!!! It&#x27;s not nearly as big as it looks. It&#x27;s about the size of my hand.</li>
    <li> Love it looks gre a t on my counter.</li>
    <li> Prefect for organizing my makeup.</li>
    <li> Love this! Fast shipping and I use it everyday it&#x27;s a little smaller than I expected but it still work for all my day to day makeup</li>
    <li> Looks big in the picture but very small its more of a jewelry box I think.</li>
