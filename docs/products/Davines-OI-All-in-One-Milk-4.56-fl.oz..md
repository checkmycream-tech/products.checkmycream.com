<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Awesome product love all Davines products and will continue to purchase them.</li>
    <li> DAVINES is the best product!!</li>
    <li> Most of the time I use all of the Oi products together (shampoo, condition, oil, milk), but on the days I don&#x27;t use any shampoo or conditioner, this all-in-one milk really makes my hair soft.  I have thick curls and refuse to use any combs or brushes.  You can imagine tangles being a nightmare, right?  Incredibly, all I have to do is give a few sprays of this on my damp hair, wait a few seconds, and comb through the tangles with my fingers.  There&#x27;s no pull on my scalp, no struggle, nothing.  This oi milk is perfect.</li>
    <li> First, the light scent is not only wonderful, but every time I walk around in the public, people come up to me to ask what I have on. Now for the hair, if you have dryness, any damage, or are color treated, this spray will transform your hair into a beautiful locks. I can&#x27;t get over the new texture of my hair. I am so happy to have this product, I always keep two on hand, because I cannot imagine running out. Run, do not walk and buy this. I also love all of the products, but this spray has really transformed my hair.</li>
    <li> Love it, there has been a world of difference in my hair</li>
    <li> Great detangler.  I found that the smell is not as strong-it&#x27;s a fresh scent almost as you would expect with eucalyptus or mint.  I happen to love the smell of freshness of it-I never use hairspray because of the scents and the amounts of alcohol that seem to overwhelm.  I first tried this product with my hairstylist and found it cheaper at Amazon.  I have tried many and I finally found one that works for my mid-long hair.  I have bought Aromatherapy thinking it will be like the samples I got once at a resort and it was a disappointment from the bottle.  It only takes me 2 pumps of this product so don&#x27;t be discourage by the size of the bottle.</li>
    <li> I recieved  a sample version of this product via my Birchbox package.  I loved it so much that I wanted to purchase it and Amazon had the best price.  It made my hair soft and it has a salon smell</li>
    <li> Leaves hair very, very soft without feeling weighed down. Comparable to Perfect Ten brand but ingredients are more natural and organic.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing.</li>
    <li> I use this and the Oi oil after getting out of the shower. I spray a few mists and then use the oil and both make my hair softer, helps to gently de-tangle my wavy hair, and makes my hair smell so lovely. I think this is one of my absolute favorite Davines products. I just wish it didn&#x27;t get used up so fast - use sparingly as it&#x27;s expensive!</li>
    <li> Makes my hair feel like silk and it smells great.</li>
    <li> Best leave in conditioner. My hair is severely damaged and dry, but this makes it look soft and healthy</li>
    <li> good product, but not in love with the ingredients. quick service.</li>
    <li> great product. I have thick wavy hair that is bleached and this product moisturizes and makes it very silky.</li>
    <li> Best hair product ever! Smells super good and makes your hair manageable and frizz free. Just don&#x27;t spray directly in your hair, spray on your hands, warm it up a little bit on your palms and massage on your hair.</li>
    <li> I first experienced this terrific product at my hairdressers. Unlike other reviewers, I love the smell and would like to slather it all over! I&#x27;m allergic to many scents and perfumes. This, on the other hand, doesn&#x27;t bother me. It smells much like the Peace &amp; Harmony calming blend by Now essential oils.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this product.  I have very long wavy hair and use this product daily to keep it free of tangles and shiny.  It smells fantastic!</li>
    <li> Love this product!  It&#x27;s takes out tangles and makes your hair soft and smooth.</li>
    <li> People are always complimenting me on how shiny my hair looks and how great it smells.  I highly recommend this product! Well worth the money.</li>
    <li> I recieved my product and it was in good condition and as expected. I had previously thought I hadn&#x27;t recieved it because I didn&#x27;t get a notice of delivery to the front office. My apologies. I&#x27;m very happy thank you!</li>
    <li> Really love this stuff.  My hair feels so wonderful afterwards.  I use it as an overnight treatment for the ends of my hair.  It really seals the split-ends.  Amazing.</li>
    <li> This product saved my hair. After getting highlights, it was impossible to brush through my wet hair without serious damage and a lot of hair clumps in the brush! Now I can glide through easily and it makes my hair soft and smells great!</li>
    <li> Love this product. Makes my hair feel fabulous</li>
    <li> Love this product, styling, smoothing, gives nice body!  Great smell and texture!</li>
    <li> leaves my hair so smooth and manageable</li>
    <li> I love it, it&#x27;s so good for my hair!</li>
    <li> The product itself is great. My hair is extremely bad, I use hot tools every other day. It really does it job and works as it claim. It soften my hair, less split ends and I no longer have to use fixing spray. It is truly is an all-in-one-product.&lt;br /&gt;Problem was, when I received the product, It was already used. There was no packaging, the bottle looked old and there was already some product in the pump.&lt;br /&gt;However the product itself is amazing!</li>
    <li> Magic! This is the product for all hair types and works magic. I have tried every high end and low end product and this is the first time I found a &#x27;smart&#x27; range!</li>
    <li> I have fine hair and found similar products to be too heavy and greasy. This works well and is light enough for great styling. I really like the scent—and even caught my guy smelling my hair, so that&#x27;s a good sign!</li>
    <li> leaves hair perfectly conditioned</li>
    <li> Nice produce - The smell is addicting!</li>
    <li> OMG! If you have dry hair or hair that needs a leave in and you haven&#x27;t tried this, you are missing out. The price is a little high but worth every penny. Great for your skin also</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product and purchased online multiple times - for $28 for the same (135 ml) size on Davines.com AND Birchbox.com (where its shipping is free). Love the Davines products in general, but this is one of the best. If you&#x27;re ordering though, do yourself a favor and check the prices elsewhere for yourself. $12 is quite a markup on a single product.</li>
    <li> Great product to help with frizz.  Also, I use in morning to help freshen up my hair.  I love Davines products.</li>
    <li> Lasts a long time, smells like roses and I use it on the dry ends of my hair love this. The price is spendy otherwise 5 stars.</li>
    <li> I found this at a blow out place in my hometown and love it. My hair is colored and can get very dry. I spray this on in the am before I brush out and the tangles come out immediately. It&#x27;s a great styler too for frizzy hair</li>
    <li> Love the smell. Love the way it makes my hair feel. And my curls love it too!</li>
    <li> Works for my long hair! Not so much of a shine as oi. But my hair is so soft, you don&#x27;t have to use too much. There is a spicy smell to it, but it doesn&#x27;t last all day. I don&#x27;t notice it at all. Very great product.</li>
    <li> I actually received a sample of this in my Birchbox monthly shipment, I liked it so I had to get more, This made my hair feel so soft. I have fine hair, and I do my best to avoid anything that will weigh it down.&lt;br /&gt;I knocked off 1 star because it does have a very STRONG perfumed scent. It&#x27;s not a bad smell, but just a kind &amp;#34;heads up&amp;#34; if you don&#x27;t like fragrances. I don&#x27;t use this daily, maybe 2x&#x27;s a week. I&#x27;m not a person that can go 3-4 days without washing my hair, maybe just a day, so I use this and alternate it with something else. It&#x27;s just a nice shampoo that makes hair feel amazing!</li>
    <li> Best smelling stuff ever and it works!</li>
    <li> I cannot shut up about this spray! I love love love it. I just spray 10-12 pumps on do hair and it instantly makes combing a breeze. I do find that it initially has a rather strong scent at first, but it fades to a pleasant perfume after a short time. I use this every single morning and my hair is soft, shiny, and fly-away free. Excellent product, worth the money!</li>
    <li> Got a sample of this in my Birchbox and loved it, so I bought a full-sized bottle. It leaves your hair soft and smells great, I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> Best leave-in conditioner ever!  And delivery was prompt too.  Perfect!</li>
    <li> This product is a must have!!  It smells amazing too!  I am completely hooked and will never go without it.</li>
    <li> I have medium length, bleached, naturally curly hair, and this made my hair softer and less frizzy before straightening and absolutely smooth and silky afterward. It detangled, allowing me to both comb and straighten more easily, and smells great while leaving hair soft, shiny and manageable. It also allows me to drastically reduce the number of products I use on my hair.</li>
    <li> I adore the Davines OI products.  I&#x27;ve tried a few different products in the line and have loved them all, and this product is no exception.  When used along with Davines This is a Relaxing Mosturizing fluid after shampooing and conditioning hair with Kevin Murphy Luxury Wash and Rinse this made my hair feel great.  It felt healthier and smoother with less frizz and also held the style well after blowing my hair out.  I used to question any some salon products could be so expensive, but after trying a few products from Davines and the OI line in particular it is clear that it is because they actually work.  For my hair type - thick, naturally wavy, and color treated blonde - this is the perfect product.  I would recommend!</li>
    <li> Yes, the smell is different (i personally dont mind it) but this makes my hair amazing. After i comb out my hair from washing, i spritz some on, and either let it air dry or blow dry &amp; style, and my hair looks and feels fantastic.</li>
    <li> I LOVE LOVE LOVE this Brand after discovering at my local salon. Don&#x27;t have time to always stop there to restock, so this site is always my backup in finding my products and free shipping and returns. Can&#x27;t beat that. I know the smell and texture of this product, so def know I have legitimate stuff. Better than drugstore crap.. I invest in hair products, especially after you pay A LOT at the salon to look FAB! Worth it and the smell gets lots on compliments.</li>
    <li> I wish it were a little cheaper, but I can&#x27;t refuse this heavenly product!!  My daughter cannot keep her hands out of my hair!  :)  Just 3-4 quick sprays and my hair practically combs itself and it feels SO soft and silky when it&#x27;s dry and although I see some complaining that it&#x27;s heavily scented, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s that bad?  And I definitely don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a bad scent.  I&#x27;ll continue to buy as long as it remains somewhat reasonably priced!  For the record, I&#x27;ve used their shampoo and conditioner as well and give that 5 stars as well!</li>
    <li> I love this product! It makes my hair soft and also smells good (not overpowering and not a perfume-type smell like some of the other Davines products). The light scent does linger throughout the day though, so if fragrance can be a problem for you, I&#x27;d recommend getting a sample from your hair salon. The sample is in a packet, but the bottle has a spray nozzle which makes it easier to distribute evenly.&lt;br /&gt;I use this every day whether I&#x27;m curling my hair, ironing it straight, or letting my hair dry naturally. It is all I&#x27;ve been using lately and I am very likely to buy it again.</li>
    <li> My husband loves this product. He rarely asks me to buy him anything for his hair, but he did request this product.</li>
    <li> Keeps hair from frizzing with out weighting it down.  great scent</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product. The only thing that works on my hair that isn&#x27;t gel. Love the seller too! FYI, I mix it 50/50 with water....</li>
    <li> I truly, truly love this product! I received a small sample in a Birchbox, and stretched it through two uses. That was enough to know I couldn&#x27;t live without it! I have long, thick, coarse, semi-curly hair. It helps to make it much more manageable and oh-so-soft! The scent--unlike anything else I have ever smelled before, and it lasts all day. I&#x27;m crazy about how it smells! I can smell it on my hair throughout the day, long after my perfume has worn off. I get compliments on how fantastic I smell, and it&#x27;s usually because of this product.</li>
    <li> My hair stylist recommended this product! WOW shiny beautiful hair !! I get complement&#x27;s all the time!  Expensive Yes, but it last a longtime, don&#x27;t need much! I have long hair and this bottle spray will last a few months !!!Great for frizz, split ends, etc. I just love it !!!</li>
    <li> Pump broke but the product is great.  3 stars for packaging</li>
    <li> Shipping was fast..awesome product..my husband love the moisture it gives his hair.his hair is curly and dry. I will be ordering it again.</li>
    <li> This product is the perfect side kick to any Davines Shampoo and Conditioner.  Gotta have it.  The value is there for me as well are the results.  Again, as a product junkie, I&#x27;ve seen many and am ready to stick with this product.  The scent is more of a pleasant herbaceous-type of scent that settles down so as not to be overpowering.  From what I can see it works for me.  Considering that I use 3-4 pumps per use, it&#x27;s lasted me just fine &#x3D; great value.  Yes, a bit &amp;#34;pricey&amp;#34; but who needs cheap?!  I need quality, value and results.  This is one of 3 Davines products I use on my hair.  I&#x27;m worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My Hair Facts pertaining to this product:  Heat treated on the 2nd and 3rd day between washes, professionally colored and trimmed.  I admit that I am gifted with great hair but I also know that anything great can go bad quickly if neglected or taken for granted.  Hahah!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cheers!&lt;br /&gt;Sparkling Tess</li>
    <li> This smells awesome!  and a great product.  Always seems to sell out quickly.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t describe it, but this is magic in a bottle.  I don&#x27;t even know what&#x27;s in the stuff, but it smells fantastic, detangles like a boss (and I have thick hair down to the middle of my back), defrizzes, and makes my hair shiny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Things I don&#x27;t love about it: Sometimes the spray nozzle gets gooped up (especially when product is getting low), so I end up just pouring it into my hands which I think makes me use more than I need to, and also, the cost.  It&#x27;s an arm and a leg, but like I said, it&#x27;s magic.</li>
    <li> I love this spray.  I use it to untangle my hair when I get out of the shower.  I love the smell, it doesn&#x27;t wear my hair down.  Leaves my hair smelling good and feeling very soft.</li>
    <li> It leaves my hair smell SOOO good and conditions it and makes it feel great and gives it a nice shine. Definitely repurchasing this product.</li>
    <li> I love this hair treatment.  It smells soo good and it takes the frizz out of your hair.</li>
    <li> Amazing product to tame frizz while conditioning and adding an amazing scent. It&#x27;s a regular staple in my hair care repetoire.</li>
    <li> will forever love this oil!</li>
    <li> Makes my hair shine and feel great.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. It is super light, so it gives my fine hair a silky sheen without making it oily. If you&#x27;re really sensitive to scents, it may not be for you. Personally,  I&#x27;d bathe in this scent if I could.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. And your hair smells so good</li>

    <li> Purchased this in France and was so happy to find it on Amazon! Makes my hair silky soft.</li>
    <li> To answer Erin&#x27;s question on defective bottles not being covered, diversion and black market products are a multi-billion dollar business. We (I&#x27;m a stylist/salon owner), have to sign contracts saying we won&#x27;t sell to third parties, but only to our clients. This is because it is very easy to manufacture fake products and add fragrance. An example is that recently, the very popular Moroccan Oil was being sold online. When the manufacturer purchased and tested it, it was baby oil and fragrance. Obviously a black market fake. (Do you remember the old Paul Mitchell commercials about real vs. fake?). Because this is a huge problem, and manufacturers can only go after the illegal outfit and not the seller, they have to protect themselves from pirated or fake products however they can. Davines puts millions into making exceptional products, and they want to make sure you are buying the real thing. Hope this sheds some light on a dirty, not so little secret.</li>
