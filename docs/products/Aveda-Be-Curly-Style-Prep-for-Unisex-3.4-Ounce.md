      <li>I would highly recommend this product to those looking for lightweight waves or curls (if you want pincurls though, I&#x27;d go for the Be Curly Curl Enhancer).</li>

      <li>I use it with the Aveda Confixor and it really enhances my natural curl.</li>

      <li>I use it right out of the shower, scrunch my hair and let it air dry.</li>

      <li>I can barely run my fingers through my hair.</li>
      <li>half straight.  </li>

<li> Keep in mind that a little goes a LONG way and its all natural.</li>
<li> I use this product to scrunch my hair up and let air dry to bring out my under curls, and to &amp;#34;curl&amp;#34; the not so curly parts of my hair.  </li>
<li> I comb it up when it&#x27;s dry.</li>
<li> so could not really skip washing if I wanted to.</li>
<li> A little goes a long way.</li>

<li> Only minor complaint is it does mean my hair feels greasy the next day,</li>
<li> When I wear my hair down and don&#x27;t straighten it, I always use this product and this product alone.  </li>
<li> These products work extremely well when I am in the Caribbean, and the heat and humidity just make my hair go limp.  </li>
<li> My hair was still frizzy and still half curly,</li>
<li> I have looked long and hard, but this is my go-to product</li>
<li> If you have hair like this you know how hard it is to find a product that doesn&#x27;t make your hair crunchy and dry.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve tried Aveda&#x27;s Be Curly Curl Enhancer a few times before and was always dissapointed--it left my hair gunky, stiff, and WAY TOO CURLY!!!  </li>
<li> This product made my hair stiff.</li>
<li> I finally decided to buy a more expensive hair product because I was tired of nasty hair.</li>
<li> product unfortunately made it frizz so badly that it was practically crispy, and the usual ringlets just expanded into dry Brillo.</li>
<li> Be Curtly Spray, and that stuff stinks too</li>
<li> Well I&#x27;m not even going to try this because it smells HORRIBLE.  </li>

    <li> Really helps my  chin-length, fine,slightly-wavy hair look curlier and more full. I use it right out of the shower, scrunch my hair and let it air dry. Also have used with blow dryer and diffuser. Only minor complaint is it does mean my hair feels greasy the next day, so could not really skip washing if I wanted to. Smells nice. A little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> I use it in my hair before putting any other Be Curly products in.  Gives the curl a more defined, but semi relaxed shape.  I don&#x27;t go to work without it on.</li>

    <li> Great product for us curly heads!  Not sticky and smells nice too!</li>
    <li> I have recently started wearing my hair curly after fighting it my whole life.  I have very curly Caucasian hair (think Irish frizz).  I prefer products designed for wearing your hair straight as they take care of frizz much better.  If I put a nice smoothing silicone-type product on my hair, it goes into ringlets and doesn&#x27;t frizz.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product unfortunately made it frizz so badly that it was practically crispy, and the usual ringlets just expanded into dry Brillo. I can barely run my fingers through my hair. Picture putting mousse in your hair and then being in 100% humidity--that is how it feels.  I like the opposite--silky hair as if there is no humidity. This must be the type of product that is good for people with only a slight wave who want to encourage it.  I think they could sell it as a volumizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I say \\&quot;unfortunately\\&quot; because I do have great respect for Aveda products. Their color conditioners are excellent. However, use your judgment on this one. If you have pretty kinky/frizzy hair, you might not like it.</li>
    <li> This product is great if your hair is easy to manage. I just wash it, put a quarter-size amount of the product in the palm of my hand and run it through my hair. Then I scrunch it up as it dries naturally and voil&amp;aacute; I have a great hair-do with no fuss. I comb it up when it&#x27;s dry.</li>
    <li> Both my daughter and my girlfriend love this. Makes both of their hair shiny and curly</li>
    <li> Love the scent, and it works great to calm frizzy hair.</li>
    <li> This stuff smells like bug spray, or pesticides, and I can&#x27;t bear to put it in my hair.  I haven&#x27;t actually tried this yet because of the strong, offensive odor.  I HAVE tried the same brand of Aveda Be Curtly Spray, and that stuff stinks too but I wanted to try it anyway.  It doesn&#x27;t work.  My hair was still frizzy and still half curly, half straight.  That&#x27;s why I decided to purchase this cream, I thought it might work better (and smell better) than the &#x27;Be Curly&#x27; spray.  Well I&#x27;m not even going to try this because it smells HORRIBLE.  I&#x27;m trying to find good hair products without parabens and sulfates for curly hair, and it&#x27;s becoming impossible!</li>
    <li> I have Senior hair, fine and thin.  Putting a pea size amount into my freshly washed and still slightly damp hair allows it to dry stiff then be combed out and fluffed.  My hair keeps a fullness all day and I am pleased that it keeps my wiley hair under control.</li>
    <li> Alright, I tend to be a penny pincher with hair products especially because you can&#x27;t try a product before you spend money on it. This has left me buying cheap 3-5 dollar hair creams and gels that way my hair down, create frizz, and it looks greasy. I finally decided to buy a more expensive hair product because I was tired of nasty hair. I was apprehensive with buying this product because of the price tag but I took a leap and bought it. I have only used it once since it just came in the mail but I already like it a lot... maybe even love :) My curls are soft and all the frizz is almost gone! I highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I love this product!!  I get my hair permed every 3 months.  My hair is straight and very fine. I like it very curly.  When the perm starts to fall, this product seems to bring the curls back, and holds my hair-do in place.  It is my favorite product in the Be Curly line.  I also use the Be Curly Shampoo, Conditioner, and Enhancer.  These products work extremely well when I am in the Caribbean, and the heat and humidity just make my hair go limp.  The Be Curly products seem to bring my curls back to life.</li>
    <li> Helps make my hair even more curly without being sticky.</li>
    <li> Great to use with the rest of the be curly line. i;ve also used it by itself and it works really well.</li>
    <li> I am in love with this.  It gives my curls a nice amount of hold, smells good and does the trick.</li>
    <li> I have natural wavy hair and when I use this it makes it curly and still feels smooth and soft</li>
    <li> I use this with the Be Curly product Aveda sells. It goes on before the Be Curly and I have seen a noticeable difference in my curls going from wavy to curly.</li>
    <li> My hair is super curly underneath, but the top layer is pretty straight.  I use this product to scrunch my hair up and let air dry to bring out my under curls, and to &amp;#34;curl&amp;#34; the not so curly parts of my hair.  Works better than any other product I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> Leaves my curls a bit too crunchy for my taste.</li>
    <li> This styling creme keeps my thick, very curly hair defined, not frizzy and soft to the touch. If you have hair like this you know how hard it is to find a product that doesn&#x27;t make your hair crunchy and dry. I have looked long and hard, but this is my go-to product and I have received numerous compliments since finding it. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I have very unruly hair--thick, coarse, and uneven in form (i.e. some parts are straight, most parts are wavy, some parts are curly).  I&#x27;ve tried Aveda&#x27;s Be Curly Curl Enhancer a few times before and was always dissapointed--it left my hair gunky, stiff, and WAY TOO CURLY!!!  I love Aveda&#x27;s smooth infusion style prep for a daily leave-in conditioner and so I (apprehensively) gave this a try.  I absolutely love it!  When I wear my hair down and don&#x27;t straighten it, I always use this product and this product alone.  It evens all the kinks out and gives my hair a beautiful uniform light curl.  Additionally, it tamed my frizz perfectly but was completely weightless and I could still run my fingers through my hair!  I&#x27;m always getting compliments!  I would highly recommend this product to those looking for lightweight waves or curls (if you want pincurls though, I&#x27;d go for the Be Curly Curl Enhancer).</li>
    <li> Excellent hair product!  Love using this, works great on your hair!</li>
    <li> I use this everyday and love the way it helps my curls appear. I will definitely be back. Thank you again</li>
    <li> Aveda Be Curly Style Prep is one of my must have hair treatments.  My hair is relatively straight but I like to wear my hair curly too.  When I do, I always use Aveda Be Curly Style-Prep along with Aveda Be Curly Curl Enhancer and use a diffuser when blow drying my hair and it takes on a wonderfully natural looking curl that is never frizzy.  I have tried many combinations of other products and none have compared to the Aveda Be Curly combination.</li>
    <li> This product made my hair stiff. The recommendation was to use it prior to the curl enhancer. For me, using the curl enhancer alone works better.</li>
    <li> I have fine, wavy hair cut short, and this works well at bringing out what little natural curl I have.  Smells good, too.</li>
    <li> I use this on my daughter&#x27;s hair and it really keeps the curl defined and the frizzies at bay.</li>
    <li> I love this product! I use it with the Aveda Confixor and it really enhances my natural curl. I&#x27;ve even had hair stylists that either don&#x27;t use it or think it&#x27;s too expensive comment on how great it works for my hair. Keep in mind that a little goes a LONG way and its all natural. It&#x27;s smells SO good.!</li>
    <li> This gives mosture and a nice softness of curls to my wavy hair.  I combine it with Aveda&#x27;s Be Curly Style Enhancer.  Blow to pouf up and I&#x27;m good to go.  That is -- most days.  My hair doesn&#x27;t always cooperate.  They make a nice spray to help on those days (at root and to finish and hold).</li>
