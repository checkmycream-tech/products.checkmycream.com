### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>stuff smells awesome</li>
      <li>and it is wonderful</li>
      <li>Wonderful scent!  </li>
      <li>Very nice fragrance, calming spray!</li>
      <li>Great for kids, I spray on a pillow</li>
      <li>A great option if you have chemical sensitivities like we do.</li>
      <li>Spray works great for bedtime routine and is &amp;#34;guaranteed&amp;#34; to keep away the boogie man (this is what our daughter believes to be our anti-monster spray.).</li>
      <li>It also works great when you get a bit edgy/stressed.</li>
      <li>Great lavendar/peppery scent.</li>
      <li>Very nice, I use at work.</li>
      <li>Oh, and it smells nice, too!</li>
      <li>Not as good as drugs probably</li>
      <li>This stuff smells so good.</li>
      <li>I love this stuff!</li>
      <li>Love the aroma!</li>
      <li>This product is absolutely amazing.</li>
      <li>Overpriced but an amazing fragrance.</li>
      <li>If you liked that taste/smell, then you&#x27;ll like this spray, but if you want a cleaner fresher scent with patchouli and orange, get the spray with just those two dominating.</li>
      <li>if you have a headache, you can spray some of this on a warm washcloth and put it over your eyes.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I spray it on myself because I love the smell</li>
      <li>I love Aura Cacia.</li>
      <li>I love this product.</li>
      <li>My kids love to use it to help unwind after coming home from school.</li>
      <li>This fragrance is lovely, soothing, and gets many lovely comments from visitors to my home.  </li>
      <li>and I think it helps me sleep more soundly.</li>
      <li>I spray this lightly on my kids&#x27; pillow cases, my linens, clothes and just in the air.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Aura Cacia is a fantastic company and this blend did not disappoint.</li>
      <li>I really enjoy the scent.</li>
      <li>After seeing a mentor teacher use it, I keep this spray in my closet and spray it in my preschool classroom (on the carpet when the kids are elsewhere) when we&#x27;re particularly excited or about to do yoga.</li>
      <li>I would highly recommend this product to anyone looking for a natural &amp; pleasant smelling way to reduce their stress &amp; anxiety. :)</li>
      <li>Nice scent, bought the oil and now make it myself in this same bottle- about 15 drops of oil and a tsp rubbing alcohol (vodka is ok too) and water.</li>
      <li>It gives a clean earthy scent.</li>
      <li>I keep this and cool hottie in my purse.</li>
      <li>I know there are other great blends out there</li>
      <li>I spray on pillow before I get into bed and drift off soooo quickly - calms and relaxes…smells wonderful…</li>
      <li>but I&#x27;ve experienced most essential oils not lasting all day anyway.</li>
      <li>This particular blend is a perfectly balanced combination of lavender and chamomile - the most widely use oils for relaxation and mixes them with a touch of sweet orange essential oil to temper the scent.</li>
      <li>love this so much that I bought the pure oil blend today</li>
      <li>I really like all the options available to me on Amazon for these scents.</li>
      <li>I am sensitive to chemical fragrances so this is a much better alternative for my skin.</li>
      <li>I have been buying Aura Cacia essential oils for many, many years because I know I can count on them to deliver top notch essential oils every time.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s worth a try.</li>
      <li>The result is a sweet, subtle, calming, beautiful scent.</li>
      <li>Smells great, not overwhelming at all.</li>
      <li>I liked it so much that I purchased a second bottle online.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This stuff is pretty heavenly.</li>
      <li>&amp; I don&#x27;t mind smelling like patchouli all day -- and most of all because it does actually help to relieve stress.</li>
      <li>I helps me feel calm and ready to go to sleep.</li>
      <li>stronger).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For a long-lasting effect, I spray it directly on my T-shirt and the great scent stays with me for a few hours.  </li>
      <li>Be sure to check whether it is safe on your clothes; I wear mostly tie-dye shirts, and it is nearly impossible to stain or ruin those.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It is much safer than burning incense and healthier than household air fresheners.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I really like this.  </li>
      <li>highly recommend this!</li>
      <li>It has a very &amp;#34;soothing&amp;#34; scent.</li>
      <li>The other thing I absolutely love about aura cacia is that on the bottle they give directions on how to remake the spritz using their oils.</li>
      <li>and I use it more as a distraction than to \\&quot;calm down\\&quot; (which usually requires something</li>
      <li>I actually purchased this essential oil from Whole Foods but wanted to express my opinion because I love amazon.</li>
      <li>The regular essential oil version of this is better.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product to anyone.</li>
      <li>I am stressed and cranky so much of the time, now that I have my chlll pill spray it does help me calm down.  </li>
      <li>I feel like I have been falling asleep much quicker since I started using this product several weeks ago.</li>
      <li>The little bit of sweet orange makes it so that the lavender and chamomile</li>
      <li>but if you are new to the essential oil thing I would recommend starting off with this particular brand and blend.</li>
      <li>I use this to help calm me down for whenever I need it.</li>

<li> am not a huge fan of pure chamomile essential oil, but this is blended so delicately that it just works!</li>
<li> don&#x27;t over power each other</li>
<li> Less lavender than expected.</li>
<li> …have many friends now addicted to it!!!</li>
<li> but I can continue working and cuss a little bit less.  </li>
<li> Not especially pleasant aroma.  </li>
<li> Doesn&#x27;t linger too long in the air or your pillow, but that&#x27;s because it&#x27;s an essential oil blend, not some dangerous chemical designed to hang in the air.</li>
<li> Maybe the air is stale, maybe you&#x27;re feeling a little claustrophobic or just some free floating anxiety.</li>

    <li> Great for kids, I spray on a pillow</li>

    <li> Aura Cacia is a fantastic company and this blend did not disappoint.

This particular blend is a perfectly balanced combination of lavender and chamomile - the most widely use oils for relaxation and mixes them with a touch of sweet orange essential oil to temper the scent. The result is a sweet, subtle, calming, beautiful scent. I spray this lightly on my kids&#x27; pillow cases, my linens, clothes and just in the air.&lt;br /&gt;I love this so much that I bought the pure oil blend today so I can use it as a calming alternative to air freshener in my car!&lt;br /&gt;I am not a huge fan of pure chamomile essential oil, but this is blended so delicately that it just works! The little bit of sweet orange makes it so that the lavender and chamomile don&#x27;t over power each other and they are not too strong.&lt;br /&gt;You can spray it in the air, linens (I have white linens and this hasn&#x27;t stained them), if you have a headache, you can spray some of this on a warm washcloth and put it over your eyes.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this!</li>
    <li> &#x27;Chill Pill&#x27; adds mint to the mix and is reminiscent of the way &#x27;Sen-Sen&#x27; tasted.  Took me a while to remember that one, but that&#x27;s what it is. If you liked that taste/smell, then you&#x27;ll like this spray, but if you want a cleaner fresher scent with patchouli and orange, get the spray with just those two dominating.</li>
    <li> I love this product. I keep this and cool hottie in my purse.</li>
    <li> This stuff smells so good. My kids love to use it to help unwind after coming home from school. It also works great when you get a bit edgy/stressed. I am keeping this in stock!</li>
    <li> Love the aroma! I use this to help calm me down for whenever I need it. Working as a nurse can have its stressful moments, not including those other moments one has in their personal lives. The sources of the stress do not go away, of course, but how you react to it sometimes makes all the difference.</li>
    <li> I spray on pillow before I get into bed and drift off soooo quickly - calms and relaxes…smells wonderful…zzzzzzzzzzz…have many friends now addicted to it!!!</li>
    <li> Maybe the air is stale, maybe you&#x27;re feeling a little claustrophobic or just some free floating anxiety. It&#x27;s worth a try.</li>
    <li> Very nice fragrance, calming spray!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! I keep it in a ziploc baggie and carry it in my purse ever since I bought it. I spray it on myself because I love the smell &amp; I don&#x27;t mind smelling like patchouli all day -- and most of all because it does actually help to relieve stress. I spray it in my office, in my car, in my house, everywhere! I would highly recommend this product to anyone looking for a natural &amp; pleasant smelling way to reduce their stress &amp; anxiety. :)</li>
    <li> This stuff is pretty heavenly. Smaller bottle than the ginger mint.  Wish the bottle was larger and the scent lasted longer.</li>
    <li> I really like this.  I am stressed and cranky so much of the time, now that I have my chlll pill spray it does help me calm down.  Not as good as drugs probably but I can continue working and cuss a little bit less.  I spray it on myself and around my environment..</li>
    <li> Smells great, not overwhelming at all. I do wish it was a little stronger, it doesn&#x27;t last very long but I&#x27;ve experienced most essential oils not lasting all day anyway.</li>
    <li> A must have. It gives a clean earthy scent. Not like the chemical sprays sold in supermarkets.</li>
    <li> I actually purchased this essential oil from Whole Foods but wanted to express my opinion because I love amazon. This product is absolutely amazing. I helps me feel calm and ready to go to sleep. I feel like I have been falling asleep much quicker since I started using this product several weeks ago. I am sensitive to chemical fragrances so this is a much better alternative for my skin. I know there are other great blends out there but if you are new to the essential oil thing I would recommend starting off with this particular brand and blend.

    <li> Great lavendar/peppery scent. Doesn&#x27;t linger too long in the air or your pillow, but that&#x27;s because it&#x27;s an essential oil blend, not some dangerous chemical designed to hang in the air. A great option if you have chemical sensitivities like we do.</li>
    <li> I learned about this product when my brother gave me a bottle for Hannukah this year.  I liked it so much that I purchased a second bottle online.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is much safer than burning incense and healthier than household air fresheners.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff smells awesome and I use it more as a distraction than to \\&quot;calm down\\&quot; (which usually requires something stronger).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For a long-lasting effect, I spray it directly on my T-shirt and the great scent stays with me for a few hours.  Be sure to check whether it is safe on your clothes; I wear mostly tie-dye shirts, and it is nearly impossible to stain or ruin those.</li>
    <li> This fragrance is lovely, soothing, and gets many lovely comments from visitors to my home.  It is lavender based but not too woodsy!  I spray it on my sheets before bedtime and I think it helps me sleep more soundly.</li>
    <li> I love Aura Cacia. I really like all the options available to me on Amazon for these scents. I usually buy them at whole foods however they only have two scents. The other thing I absolutely love about aura cacia is that on the bottle they give directions on how to remake the spritz using their oils. This scent is a citrus and lavender and it is wonderful</li>
    <li> Spray works great for bedtime routine and is &amp;#34;guaranteed&amp;#34; to keep away the boogie man (this is what our daughter believes to be our anti-monster spray.). Oh, and it smells nice, too!</li>
    <li> Loses the scent fast and makes my husband and me allergic. The regular essential oil version of this is better.</li>
    <li> Not especially pleasant aroma.  Less lavender than expected.</li>
    <li> Overpriced but an amazing fragrance.</li>
    <li> Wonderful scent!  I spay on my pillow about 5 min before going to sleep.  It has a very &amp;#34;soothing&amp;#34; scent.</li>
