### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Works perfectly.  </li>
      <li>This shaver is awesome</li>
      <li>I would say it&#x27;s one of the best &#x27;value&#x27; razors.  </li>
      <li>I wasn&#x27;t especially pleased with the shave quality i.e. skin irritation, hair pulls.  </li>
      <li>The battery life I would rate very good for this type of shaver.</li>
      <li>Great shaver for the price.  </li>
      <li>This R-950 was good, but I recommend their newer model \\&quot;The 360</li>
      <li>For the money, this is a good razor.  </li>
      <li>I reiterate, good shaver if bought for around $35.</li>
      <li>A great buy...very satisfied.  </li>
      <li>I liked the loook and the titanum blades of the remington line</li>
      <li>/&gt;The shave itself is remarkably close and clean.</li>
      <li>Best shaver I&#x27;ve owned so far.</li>
      <li>I have yet to find one that gives a really good shave quickly.  </li>
      <li>The bottom line is that it gives a good, close, quick shave.  </li>
      <li>If that doesn&#x27;t say it all, it certianly says something, since the cost of this razor is slightly more than Braun&#x27;s replacement cutter and shield.</li>
      <li>It seems to give a better shave, however, so</li>
      <li>R-950 but it works ok.  </li>
      <li>Why would you think of making a shaver without a flip top?  </li>
      <li>For comparison, I&#x27;ve used Braun razors before this for many  years.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried many rotary head shavers including the Norelco brand.</li>
      <li>which is waaaaaay better.  </li>
      <li>I VERY lightly run it across my face and neck and it gives me a very quick close shave.  </li>
      <li>If you are very picky this would make a good travel shaver if you do not want to take your clunky $100+ shaving system.</li>
      <li>I say easy does it because that is what you need to do.</li>
      <li>The shave is super smooth and the shaver is very easy to clean.  </li>
      <li>I once had a cheap shaver I got at Sears that I learned was made for Sears by Remington.</li>
      <li>I have owned Norelco and Braun for more than 15 years and on the whole found them to be a more agreeable shave.</li>
      <li>It is rechargeble and is recharged quickly and easily.</li>
      <li>I bought this shave based on price and company name, and i&#x27;m not disappointed in either area.  </li>
      <li>You will want to clean it thoroughly after (or perhaps before)</li>
      <li>the complaints about having to take it apart to clean it</li>
      <li>I liked that shaver, so when I found the R-950 at Sears on sale for $40, I decided to replace my old top-selling-brand rotary shaver.</li>
      <li>He is normally a blade-shaver and was very happy and surprised to find that he could get such a close, smooth shave with this razor.  </li>
      <li>I am overall very satisfied with the razor.</li>
      <li>I am pleased with it and it still shaves ok with minor irritation</li>
      <li>It fits comfortably in his hand and holds a charge very well.</li>
      <li>With that said, I find this shaver shaves good, but is rough on the skin.  </li>
      <li>Shaver performs fine, as I expected from the writeup and most customer reviews.</li>
      <li>It is very light weight and cuts my beard quickly and easily with very little pressure applied to the skin.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m pleased overall.  </li>
      <li>It gives a pretty close shave.  </li>
      <li>After using many different electric shavers over the years, including the Braun Activator, this is the first electric shaver that I did not have to use a blade after shaving with the electric razor.  </li>
      <li>and it actually gave me more cuts than a 10 cent disposable razor.</li>
      <li>your first shave though, as the business end is packaged covered with oil.</li>
      <li>Also, why is the higher model 960 cheaper than the 950?   </li>
      <li>The main shaving part of this product is fine, but the pop up trimmer broke within a couple months of buying it with only light use.  </li>
      <li>The design of the shaver mechanically is fine and appears to be fairly reliable - although its a touch hard to clean because the blades are super sharp underneath the foils.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried several brands of electric shavers for the past 12 years and so far Remington has seemed the best.  </li>
      <li>, I guess I might have to replace the whole thing.</li>
      <li>I was very disapointed with the performance of this razor.  </li>
      <li>However, the shave is very close - expect to use a lot of cooling lotion with this razor.  </li>
      <li>I guess that&#x27;s what really matters.  </li>
      <li>I figured that this would go away as I was transitioning from a straight electric shaver to one with rotary heads.  </li>
      <li>I bought this shaver after having used other Remington models before and have been generally satisfied with the quality of the shave.  </li>
      <li>, what gives the 960 the ability to be rinsed cleaned while the 950 has to be brushed clean?</li>
      <li>instructions that come with this Remington shaver hint that you don&#x27;t need to do a full cleaning on a daily basis.</li>
      <li>while the cutters are indeed gold-colored, the top cutting surfaces are a nice, shiny silver.</li>
      <li>This shaver is quiet enough, shaves good enough, but is not easy on the skin like many shaver are.  </li>
      <li>I would highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>If you check you will see these 2 shavers are the same except for the extra light on the 960.  </li>
      <li>It does not shave as close as my old</li>
      <li>My skin is not that sensitive.</li>
      <li>I will use it while trying to find somethine that works as well as my old R-950.</li>
      <li>Other reviewers mention that it is hard to clean the cutters; true.  </li>
      <li>a try.&lt;br /&gt;I found that I just needed to barely touch my face, no rubbing and scrubbing.</li>
      <li>This was shipped right away and received with in a few days.  </li>
      <li>This electric shaver is quiet, gives decent results, is more difficult to clean, and the cutting heads get hot, fast, potentially causing razor burn.  </li>
      <li>Shaves pretty close, but takes a few passes on the neck.  </li>
      <li>I bought this for my husband as a gift, he really likes how close it shaves, but says it definately takes a couple of weeks for your skin to get used to it as it is REALLY sharp!</li>
      <li>bigger disappointment was that removing the head for cleaning out hair wasn&#x27;t easy and resulted in breakage, no doubt due to the cheap plastic used.  </li>

<li> Worked ok but was very irritating on my neck.  </li>
<li> The other (960) gets high marks for a good shave, but this one gets poor marks for a poor shave.  </li>
<li> It did not cut as well as my old Norelco and the cutting heads seemed to heat up from friction very quickly.  </li>
<li> If you allow your facial stubble to get too long this razor will pull hair</li>
<li> The cutting heads are easily replaceable but apparently not the trimmer, so I&#x27;ll have to replace the entire unit.  </li>
<li> I was happy when i used it the first and second time but the third time i was disappointed, because it started pulling hair instaid of cutting it.</li>
<li> Shaves close, batteries hold charge a long time.  </li>
<li> I think the battery isn&#x27;t holding a charge as long as it did.  </li>
<li> After 8 months and having finally tired of the red and sore neck (especially with drier winter skin), not to mention the occasional cut lip I get with the R-950 while trying to shave around the mouth, I am going back to my old shaver.</li>
<li> This remington razor is actually too sharp if you ask me.  </li>
<li> I was on travel to Japan (live in Texas) and it was embarrasing to say the least, looking like that in meetings.</li>
<li> , my beard grows in all directions, and shaving with this Remington, perhaps because of the rotary design, takes a lot less time and effort; using my Braun is like cleaning carpet, going over the same area from every direction.</li>
<li> I finally got tired of paying 50 percent of the cost of a new razor for the head assembly and tossed it in the trash.</li>
<li> /&gt;This is similar to Norelco shavers I&#x27;ve owned, but the Norelco models let me hold the individual cutting wheels and screens in my hand, making cleaning much easier.</li>
<li> and I have had no issues with it being rough.  </li>
<li> The only negative i have on the shaver is that it is difficult to remove the shaver head to clean it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> I admit I was a bit concerned with some of the other reviewers complaining about it being rough on the face and neck.  </li>
<li> Perhaps it&#x27;s due to their movable heads that move with the curvature of your face.</li>
<li> I was looking for a replacement for my old Norelco razor (battery getting weak after 4 years) and thought that I would give Remington a try.  </li>
<li> The feature that specifically drew me to this model and other Remingtons previously is the pop-up beard and mustache trimmer.  </li>
<li> Since I obviously need this, this product went in the trash after hardly having been used.</li>
<li> The quality is average for its class of shaver.  </li>
<li> the transition to this shaver (which included some cuts and redness) has died down, and it is working well.</li>
<li> and they all left very irritating red marks on my neck.</li>
<li> I use it on my scalp and neck with little irritation.</li>
<li> Add the little bits and pieces of whiskers every shaver produces, and you get a sludge that causes the heads to get even hotter, faster.</li>
<li> I have used Braun and Norelco in the past and this shaver beats the previous shavers I have had hands down.  </li>
<li> Pulling it off you apply enough force that you&#x27;re afraid everything will go flying when it finally comes apart.</li>
<li> Worked alright for a few months.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Both this shaver two weeks ago.  Worked ok but was very irritating on my neck.  Never had that problem with my Norelcos.  The problem was it stopped working a week after buying it for no reason.  Would not turn on, recharged it no change.  Took the blades off and motor worked, cleaned heads and no difference.  Finally disasembled heads again looked closely and could see no reason for problem.  Tossed shaver since I trashed the box and reciept.  I have two words \\&quot;Buy Norelco\\&quot;.</li>
    <li> i purchased this razor for my husband a while back.  He loves it.  A great buy...very satisfied.  thank you</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried several brands of electric shavers for the past 12 years and so far Remington has seemed the best.  This R-950 was good, but I recommend their newer model \\&quot;The 360 Flex\\&quot; which is waaaaaay better.  The shave is super smooth and the shaver is very easy to clean.  Best shaver I&#x27;ve owned so far.</li>
    <li> I was happy when i used it the first and second time but the third time i was disappointed, because it started pulling hair instaid of cutting it.</li>
    <li> I tried Remington razors (including the R-950) and they all left very irritating red marks on my neck. I did not push hard, and kept trying for 3 weeks. I am used to using electric razors and never had this issue. My skin is not that sensitive. I was on travel to Japan (live in Texas) and it was embarrasing to say the least, looking like that in meetings. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I went back to the Norelco and the shave is just as close and no irritation at all. Perhaps it&#x27;s due to their movable heads that move with the curvature of your face. (they say it&#x27;s patented, not sure). Please learn from my mistake.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband as a gift, he really likes how close it shaves, but says it definately takes a couple of weeks for your skin to get used to it as it is REALLY sharp!</li>
    <li> Great shaver for the price.  Shaves close, batteries hold charge a long time.  Can take on trip without needing to take charger with.</li>
    <li> This remington razor is actually too sharp if you ask me.  I used it for a period of several weeks and it caused my face to blister and it actually gave me more cuts than a 10 cent disposable razor. Ouch. However, the shave is very close - expect to use a lot of cooling lotion with this razor.  The design of the shaver mechanically is fine and appears to be fairly reliable - although its a touch hard to clean because the blades are super sharp underneath the foils. I have owned Norelco and Braun for more than 15 years and on the whole found them to be a more agreeable shave.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a replacement for my old Norelco razor (battery getting weak after 4 years) and thought that I would give Remington a try.  I was very disapointed with the performance of this razor.  It did not cut as well as my old Norelco and the cutting heads seemed to heat up from friction very quickly.  I returned this razor and am purchasing another Norelco.</li>
    <li> This shaveer was given to me as a christmas gift. I liked the loook and the titanum blades of the remington line so I gave it a try. I am overall very satisfied with the razor. The company advises that you replace the screen and blades every 6 months but at a retail store those cost over $25-35. If you allow your facial stubble to get too long this razor will pull hair but no where near as bad as a blade. I am pleased with it and it still shaves ok with minor irritation but I have not replaced the heads and screen yet. The battery life I would rate very good for this type of shaver. If you are very picky this would make a good travel shaver if you do not want to take your clunky $100+ shaving system.</li>
    <li> I once had a cheap shaver I got at Sears that I learned was made for Sears by Remington. I liked that shaver, so when I found the R-950 at Sears on sale for $40, I decided to replace my old top-selling-brand rotary shaver. Big mistake. After 8 months and having finally tired of the red and sore neck (especially with drier winter skin), not to mention the occasional cut lip I get with the R-950 while trying to shave around the mouth, I am going back to my old shaver. How can a shaver that gets close enough to hurt still give a poor shave... but it does. &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> Worked alright for a few months.  I wasn&#x27;t especially pleased with the shave quality i.e. skin irritation, hair pulls.  I figured that this would go away as I was transitioning from a straight electric shaver to one with rotary heads.  It didn&#x27;t.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The bigger disappointment was that removing the head for cleaning out hair wasn&#x27;t easy and resulted in breakage, no doubt due to the cheap plastic used.  Never again.</li>
    <li> I bought this shaver for my fiance for Christmas.  He loves it.  He is normally a blade-shaver and was very happy and surprised to find that he could get such a close, smooth shave with this razor.  It fits comfortably in his hand and holds a charge very well.</li>
    <li> This electric shaver is quiet, gives decent results, is more difficult to clean, and the cutting heads get hot, fast, potentially causing razor burn.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The biggest plus that I found, my beard grows in all directions, and shaving with this Remington, perhaps because of the rotary design, takes a lot less time and effort; using my Braun is like cleaning carpet, going over the same area from every direction. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Remington makes a big deal of their using titanium coated blades, but you&#x27;ll notice on cleaning that while the cutters are indeed gold-colored, the top cutting surfaces are a nice, shiny silver. If there&#x27;s no titanium coating on the one part that wears, to me it&#x27;s all just (misleading) marketing hype. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The cutter assembly snaps on and off, in contrast to having some sort of button you press to release it (as with the foil cover on my Braun). Pulling it off you apply enough force that you&#x27;re afraid everything will go flying when it finally comes apart. Nor can you just brush off the cutters, but instead need to take the head apart.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;This is similar to Norelco shavers I&#x27;ve owned, but the Norelco models let me hold the individual cutting wheels and screens in my hand, making cleaning much easier. With this Remington version the screens remain attached to one support, while the round cutters are attached to another. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The instructions that come with this Remington shaver hint that you don&#x27;t need to do a full cleaning on a daily basis. You will want to clean it thoroughly after (or perhaps before) your first shave though, as the business end is packaged covered with oil. Add the little bits and pieces of whiskers every shaver produces, and you get a sludge that causes the heads to get even hotter, faster.</li>
    <li> I looked at the reviews for both this 950 and the Remingotn 960.  What is the difference in these 2 models?  The other (960) gets high marks for a good shave, but this one gets poor marks for a poor shave.  If you check you will see these 2 shavers are the same except for the extra light on the 960.  Also, why is the higher model 960 cheaper than the 950?   &lt;br /&gt;  I&#x27;ve had this 950 for only 2 shaves. I always shave with electric shavers.  I&#x27;ve tried many rotary head shavers including the Norelco brand. I have yet to find one that gives a really good shave quickly.  With that said, I find this shaver shaves good, but is rough on the skin.  It could be the \\&quot;break-in period\\&quot; is not over yet. &lt;br /&gt;Also, what gives the 960 the ability to be rinsed cleaned while the 950 has to be brushed clean? It seems they are constructed with the same materials. &lt;br /&gt;I was tempted to get the 960 and return the 950 but I am not convinced by the reviews as to the performance of either shaver. &lt;br /&gt;   This shaver is quiet enough, shaves good enough, but is not easy on the skin like many shaver are.  I do not like the way it opens, by prying off the roatary mechanism.  The quality is average for its class of shaver.  &lt;br /&gt;   I wish someone could explain the difference in the ratings of these two shavers as shown on Amazon. I&#x27;m confused. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> I bought this shave based on price and company name, and i&#x27;m not disappointed in either area.  The only negative i have on the shaver is that it is difficult to remove the shaver head to clean it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shave itself is remarkably close and clean. It is rechargeble and is recharged quickly and easily.</li>
    <li> I never did get the R-950.  Amazon sent the XL600.  I sent it back and asked them not to substitute.  They did anyway and sent the XL600 to me a second time.  I kept it because I needed a razor and did not want to fool with sending it back again.  It does not shave as close as my old R-950 but it works ok.  I will use it while trying to find somethine that works as well as my old R-950.</li>
    <li> The main shaving part of this product is fine, but the pop up trimmer broke within a couple months of buying it with only light use.  Since I obviously need this, this product went in the trash after hardly having been used.</li>
    <li> Why would you think of making a shaver without a flip top?  This shaver annoyingly required the owner to stick his fingernails into the minimal ridging underneath the heads of the shaver and physically remove the head of the shaver in order to empty it.  You get the shavings all over your hands.  How ridiculous!  This earns it a two point reduction because of annoyance. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Otherwise, after 2 weeks, the transition to this shaver (which included some cuts and redness) has died down, and it is working well.</li>
    <li> I bought this shaver after having used other Remington models before and have been generally satisfied with the quality of the shave.  The feature that specifically drew me to this model and other Remingtons previously is the pop-up beard and mustache trimmer.  However, I&#x27;ve had this one less than two years and the trimmer has completely failed.  The cutting heads are easily replaceable but apparently not the trimmer, so I&#x27;ll have to replace the entire unit.  That said, I&#x27;ll probably go with this or a similar model.</li>
    <li> Got it for Christmas about 3 years ago.  Trimmer died about 2 years ago.  Shaves pretty close, but takes a few passes on the neck.  I think the battery isn&#x27;t holding a charge as long as it did.  I&#x27;m probably shaving too long with dull blades and should try replacing them, but with the broken trimmer, I guess I might have to replace the whole thing.</li>
    <li> Shaver performs fine, as I expected from the writeup and most customer reviews. Re: the complaints about having to take it apart to clean it - I found it to be not such a big deal.</li>
    <li> The bottom line is that it gives a good, close, quick shave.  I was somewhat disappointed in that it seemed to be of less quality then my Norelco that I was replacing.  It seems to give a better shave, however, so I guess that&#x27;s what really matters.  The titanium blades hopefully will last longer then the expensive blades that I was using.</li>
    <li> I say easy does it because that is what you need to do. I have used safety razor and soap and water for 30 years and decided to give this a try.&lt;br /&gt;I found that I just needed to barely touch my face, no rubbing and scrubbing. If you tilt you head sideways and rest it on you cheek is about all the pressure you will need.</li>
    <li> Works perfectly.  I use it on my scalp and neck with little irritation.</li>
    <li> I purchased this shaver - I admit I was a bit concerned with some of the other reviewers complaining about it being rough on the face and neck.  This shaver is awesome and I have had no issues with it being rough.  It is very light weight and cuts my beard quickly and easily with very little pressure applied to the skin. I VERY lightly run it across my face and neck and it gives me a very quick close shave.  I&#x27;m done in no time at all.  I have used Braun and Norelco in the past and this shaver beats the previous shavers I have had hands down.  I would highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I used this razor for 2-3 years--I have no complaints about the shaves I got, but the unit itself is fragile and various parts broke apart over time. I finally got tired of paying 50 percent of the cost of a new razor for the head assembly and tossed it in the trash.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this razor for about two years and I&#x27;m pleased overall.  It gives a pretty close shave.  For comparison, I&#x27;ve used Braun razors before this for many  years.  For the money, this is a good razor.  Other reviewers mention that it is hard to clean the cutters; true.  But popping off the head for just a daily &#x27;emptying&#x27; is not problematic.  I would say it&#x27;s one of the best &#x27;value&#x27; razors.  Four stars for that category.    Edit:    I failed to mention: the battery lasts for 3-4 shaves; fully charges in about 2-3 hrs. The replacement heads can be pricey; from $23 - $30.    I reiterate, good shaver if bought for around $35. It is only lacking if compared to high-end shavers.</li>
    <li> After using many different electric shavers over the years, including the Braun Activator, this is the first electric shaver that I did not have to use a blade after shaving with the electric razor.  If that doesn&#x27;t say it all, it certianly says something, since the cost of this razor is slightly more than Braun&#x27;s replacement cutter and shield.</li>
    <li> This was shipped right away and received with in a few days.  Just as stated the shaver was just what my husband wanted.</li>
