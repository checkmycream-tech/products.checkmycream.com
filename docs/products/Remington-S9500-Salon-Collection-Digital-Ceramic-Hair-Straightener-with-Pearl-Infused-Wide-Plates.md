<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I love it. I&#x27;m buying another one, &#x27;cuz the dummy here took it to Chile without checking the voltage there first.</li>
    <li> I love it so much I got a second one (I was dumb enough to use it overseas and burnt it)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got a few other ones before but this is the best one I have used in the past few years! No ouch! The plates are long and heat up fast! It has a beeping sound when it is ready which is important to me because I am not standing around in the morning to check if the thing is not enough.</li>
    <li> Better than the HSI with great reviews! (And much cheaper too) The pearlized coating and the longer heating panels makes this a much better straightener. There is also a lock button which is really nice. I have never curled my hair with this straightner, so can&#x27;t speak to that.</li>
    <li> So i got this straightener for christmas 3 years ago i loved it. Its cute and works really good but the next year a week before chrismas it broke one side was not heating up. So my boyfriend got me the same one for chrismas and right after chrismas the next year the same thing happened. Time to get a new brand</li>
    <li> Maybe it was just a fluke, but I got one that went on (the light came on) when plugged in, but it didn&#x27;t heat up. Others of this brand did however, so I&#x27;m sure it was just a one time problem, and the seller promptly credited me.</li>
    <li> I bought this in April and loved it. It glided so nicely on my hair. Left it straight all day with no frizz. Less than a month later, it just stopped working. I called remington and they told me they no longer manufacture this particular model, so they sent me a replacement. They sent the s6500 and I hate it. I called again and they are now sending me another replacement. Thbe s1050. We will see how that goes. I really wish they could have sent me another s9500 because it was great.</li>
    <li> I bought this for a trip to Europe in May and did not want to carry around my two inch wide Sedu iron.  I read lots of reviews for several different irons and choose this one.  I could not be happier.  I really liked the locking feature as it made easier to travel with it for two weeks.  I have hair that is about 4\\&quot; past my shoulders and I was able to straighten all of it with this iron.  Granted it took a little longer than with my bigger one, but it still got the job done.  I have since used it on multiple domestic trips and have had no problems.  Being smaller it does cool off faster but still can take a bit of time.  I even use it on a daily basis to straighten my bangs.  Heats up super fast and I can be done in less than five minutes.</li>
    <li> It is ok it does not seem to grip my hair well I have very thin hair it does get hot on my scale 10 being the best I would rate this a 6 this would be my best review for this product  sorry</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had the flat iron for about 9 months and at first my only problem was that my hair would slip out if I were trying to curl it. But now only one side heats up! It did come with a warranty though unfortunately I lost my receipt so I cannot return it.</li>
    <li> WORKED GREAT WHEN IT WORKED BUT I GUESS I RECEIVED ONE OF THE MANY THAT HAS A 1 WEEK LIFE SPAN.  THEY MUST BE DEFECTIVE.  I WOULD SUGGEST NOT PURCHASING THIS UNLESS YOU ONLY WANT A FLAT IRON THAT WORKS FOR A WEEK.</li>
    <li> it was burned when I first turn it on.  I live in Georgia and my country is so far that I cann&#x27;t return it back becouse it cost much. I need your help.</li>
    <li> My daughter used one of these at a friends house and raved about it, so when I needed a new flat iron, I chose this one. I do like it, but don&#x27;t find that it straightens any better than cheaper flat irons I have bought. I&#x27;ve had it for about a month and at least so far I don&#x27;t notice any wearing away of the coating on the plates which has been my biggest issue with other flat irons I have owned.</li>
    <li> I had the same experience as it sounds like a number of others did.  I liked the straighter.  It straightened better than the one that I had been using for the last couple of years (which was a super cheap straighter, but it still lasted me longer than this one) and it looks nice.  My sister, who&#x27;s a cosmetologist, even said that it worked pretty well (and that was in comparison to the CHI iron that she was using).  Then one day I went to use the straightener (like I had about every day for the past 3-4 months) and noticed that it wasn&#x27;t straightening my hair.  I finally touched both plates to see if I could figure out what was going on and one of them wasn&#x27;t working at all (I got a nice burn from the other one though).  I tried it again the next day and the plate still wasn&#x27;t heating up, so I figured it was done for.  I contacted Remington and they told me to send the straighter back with the receipt (which I didn&#x27;t have, but they said they could get a code off the straightener) and they would send me a new one.  I was kind of annoyed that I had to pay to ship the thing to them (I never understand why companies don&#x27;t understand that it costs money to ship things) and I&#x27;m still waiting for my replacement.  I&#x27;m crossing my fingers that I get my replacement and it doesn&#x27;t die too.  Update:  Got my replacement in June 2012 and it&#x27;s now July 2013 and is still working great!  Plus, I learned from another product that I had to send back, you can request that they send you a shipping label.  Update:  A few months after my last update, the replacement straightener also stopped working.  I contacted the company again and they asked if I ever wrapped the cord around the device.  I said, I did, and they said that voided the warranty.  After that, no more Remington products for me.  (I&#x27;ve never had any other brands just stop working on me after a year of so--my curling wand stopped working too.)</li>
    <li> Bought this same straightener 4 years ago and I loved it so much I bought it again. The plates keep my hair smooth and prevents frizz. Also, heats up very quickly and beeps when it&#x27;s done heating up.</li>
    <li> This iron heats up quickly. The irons aren&#x27;t super huge, making it perfect for people with sort hair--like me. I have no complaints with this product. It gets the job done!</li>
    <li> Well, when this box came I handed it over to my wife. And laughed a little because she has stick straight hair. She immediatly corrected me, \\&quot;Straight hair is not necessarily frizz free, a straightener doesn&#x27;t just straighten, it smooths, shines and can even add a bit of curl to the ends.\\&quot; I filed this under \\&quot;useless information\\&quot; and went about my business. Sunday morning I crawled out bed, dressed and drug myself out the car where my wife was waiting with our three dapper diapered tikes. After I wiped the sleepies out of my eyes I noticed her hair- wow! It was sleek, smooth, straight. . . not just \\&quot;not curly\\&quot; but STRAIGHT and the ends were curled under for a very smooth look. I wanted to touch it. Instead I said, \\&quot;Oh you tried the straightener, how was it?\\&quot; \\&quot;Well, it heats up really fast. Really fast. See, we are even on time to church!\\&quot; was her smiling reply. She continued with, \\&quot;I can&#x27;t really speak to whether it is better than other models, this the first time I have straightened my hair. The instruction book was clear and concise and the product itself was pleasantly intuitive. The controls and display are easy to see and understand. I like the pink. And, I like my smooth shiny hair. Thank you.\\&quot; and then she kissed me. (maybe not exactly like that, but I did get a kiss since I noticed) Since it made her happy and worked well, I&#x27;ll definitely suggest the product.</li>
    <li> I loved this straightener. I heated up in under a minute and left my hair silky and soft! It doesn&#x27;t burn the hair or leave a nasty smell behind. However, mine has mysteriously stopped working after about two months of having it. I go to plug it in and press on and nothing happens. I can&#x27;t figure out why. I will be purchasing another one though and hope this one doesn&#x27;t break too.</li>
    <li> I bought this flat iron about 3 years ago when I saw it on clearance at Wal Mart. My old flat iron was broken, and I really wasn&#x27;t picky about which new one to buy. For the price, I figured it would do just enough to get me by until I could research better brands. I really underestimated it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It still works like brand new and has minimal discoloration on the edges of the ceramic. I typically use mine on the 420 temp. setting, as it&#x27;s just enough to fully straighten my hair without burning it. I tried it on 450, but my hair is fairly thin, and it was a little too hot. I would guess that there&#x27;s a reason many flat irons only heat up to 410. It heats up to 420 degrees in about 20 seconds or less, which is perfect when you&#x27;re getting ready in a hurry. I&#x27;ve never had it lose heat during use, and I love that it has an automatic shutoff after quite a while. I don&#x27;t remember the exact shutoff time, but it&#x27;s useful if you accidentally leave it turned on when you leave the house.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very rarely does it ever tug on my hair. I noticed that it&#x27;s more likely to happen if I&#x27;m curling my hair with it, but it&#x27;s still not a huge issue. It never leaves a burnt smell, nor does it leave it looking fried. My hair is naturally wavy, with lots of dryness and frizziness, so I can&#x27;t say that it always makes my hair pin straight. However, it&#x27;s still the best one that I&#x27;ve used (aside from the more popular, but much more expensive competitor). I gave this four stars only because I don&#x27;t get the same silkiness and shine as I did with the more expensive flat iron. For those with healthy hair, I&#x27;m sure it turns out comparable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can definitely say you get a salon-quality flat iron for a ridiculously low price. This is one of those few instances where it may seem too good to be true, but it isn&#x27;t!</li>
    <li> Heats up super quick (15 secs).  Straightened my hair thick, wavy hair in no time perfectly.  Does just as good or better as the Chi.  Would highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Great hair straightener! Gets hot really fast! Great for thick and curly hair like mine! It is worth the money.</li>
    <li> I bought this after two years of using a TIGI Bed Head straightener that seemed to fry my hair and not really decrease the frizz.  This product was recommended to me by a friend so I figured why not give it a try (I had been considering buying a CHI for a lot more $$).      I used this this morning for the first time and all I can say is WOW!  It heated up super fast and stayed hot without much time needed between hair sections - I used the 400 degree temp setting.  I have A LOT of thick, wavy hair and it normally takes about 25 minutes for me to get it all straight, but with this straightener it took only 15!  Those extra ten minutes gave me time to drink my coffee at home instead of in the car, which was a nice treat :)</li>
    <li> Helps keep my hair straight. My hair tends to curl out very quickly and I use it every week. Has been working well for more than a year now.</li>
    <li> My daughters friend had one we both tried and loved it.  My oldest daughter gave me her expensive one when she bought herself one and definitely loved this better.  I did not like her expensive one and bought myself one of these which I absolutely love.  I gave the expensive one to my youngest and she kept taking mine (this one) so I bought her her own so she won&#x27;t take mine.  The expensive one is being donated, this one works much better.  We all have wave and cowlicks and my youngest has thick hair.  It seems to work well on all hair types as my daughter has done up her friends hair for prom with this hot iron.</li>
    <li> Great-- works really well and heats up fast!</li>
    <li> We used this straightner almost daily for about 6 months and suddenly it didn&#x27;t work anymore, so longevity is a major negative issue.    On the plus side it didn&#x27;t crispy up the hair, was quicker at what it&#x27;s intended function was than our previous model.    It was my daughter&#x27;s favorite hair straightner until it died. Considered buying another until I saw the price and decided it wasn&#x27;t worth throwing my money away for 6 months of use.</li>
    <li> If you are a guy and dont know what to get your girlfreind for her birthday or somthing else speical! your search is over. Very good buy and cheap. Plus she loved it and worked very nice.</li>
    <li> I bought the remington flat iron, think at first on its size, it is really small so its really confortable for people that travels a lot, the upper side of the flat iron heats up , principally the part when the remington logo is printed. My hair is almost straight and thin, so if i grab a small group of hair, it doesn&#x27;t grab. Still with a little patience you can get a great result, and despite de size of it, in no time at all.</li>
    <li> que espectacular plancha esta super buena me deja el cabello extremadamente liso, ahora si a cambiar de look excelente me gusto mucho</li>
    <li> There are two things I love about this flat iron. First is the super fast heat up time. I don&#x27;t straighten my hair every morning, but when I do, it&#x27;s generally a last second decision because I notice while I&#x27;m brushing my teeth that it&#x27;s a bit out of sorts and needs a quick slick down. This flat iron has me deeply in love, because if I turn it on as I start brushing my teeth, it&#x27;s giving me the all ready beep by the time I&#x27;m swishing out my mouthwash. The second thing that has me loving this flat iron over my old one is the side controls. At first, I thought they were a little awkwardly positioned, but I realized that while controls on the main part of the handle were a little easier to use, the side controls mean that I don&#x27;t accidentally turn the iron off or change the heat settings while I&#x27;m using it, which happened quite often with my old flat iron.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ultimately, this won&#x27;t replace a super expensive salon flat iron, but for all practical purposes, it works great for the price.</li>
    <li> I got this flat iron yesterday and I really love it already! I had been wanting to get a new straightener for a while to replace my old Remington Wet2Straight that I&#x27;ve had for about five years now. That one still works well, but I felt like it didn&#x27;t work as well as it used to. I knew this would be good because it&#x27;s a Remington, which is an amazing brand for the price point it&#x27;s at. Anyway, this flat iron is just great. It&#x27;s sleek and easy to use with the buttons and the screen with the temperature displayed. I feel like it&#x27;s much more gentle on my hair while I&#x27;m using it and doesn&#x27;t snag nearly as much as some other flat irons I&#x27;ve tried. And my hair feels twice as smooth and sleek when I&#x27;m finished. There&#x27;s absolutely nothing frizzy about my hair now. And the edges of the plates are curved so you could also use it to curl your hair.</li>
    <li> Dont bother buying this product ..you have to squeeze the playes togetger realy hard for the ends to touch the straightner is made poorly and not worth it</li>
    <li> I have to say, I should have read the negative reviews about this straightener first before buying it. It is a beautiful straightener, but the plates do not come together very well by itself, which means I have to clamp the plates together tightly myself with my hands when straightening my hair, which somewhat tires out my hands.</li>
    <li> I have a wardrobe of hair straighteners at this point, probably because I didn&#x27;t want to spend the dough for a CHI the first time around.     The Remington S9500 is a good straightener. It is lightweight, literally, which is always a plus in a hair implement. Combing and combing is just annoying when a hair device gets as heavy as a ton of bricks after awhile.    Which brings us to my particular issue. These kind of implements get heavy for me because my hair is long and thick. It takes work and effort to drag anything through my hair, including a brush.    The S9500 took time. A lot of time. The width isn&#x27;t what I&#x27;d pick for my kind of hair, because it can take forever to get results when the straightener is so thin. The other issue is that it tends to get hot (not unusual for a low-end straightener.) So you have to be a big careful where you hold it, and if you rush it, the results aren&#x27;t worth the effort.    For someone with thinner hair, or shorter hair, it&#x27;s a fine straightener (but you&#x27;ll need some kind of hair polish afterward. Seems to make hair a bit dryer than other straighteners.)    Good to keep on your list if money is an issue.</li>
    <li> I have thick and wavy hair with a mind of its own.  It takes a good straightener to bring any semblance of order to my hair.  This straightener actually managed to do the job.  There are lots of great features in this model.  The temperature can be adjusted hotter or cooler in twenty-degree increments.  I used it on the pre-set 380 and it worked just fine.  It heats up in a matter of seconds.  Within 20 seconds I was at full heat.  No more waiting 5-10 minutes for my hair appliances to heat up!  This model si thin, and relatively easy to manipulate.  I would like it if the plates closed a bit tighter, but that might just be me.  Best of all, this managed to straighten my hair with no need of products.  I really can&#x27;t ask for more than that.  This straightener is an excellent value for the price.</li>
    <li> I have to say that for the price, this iron works just as well, if not better, than a couple of expensive flat irons/hair straighteners I already own.  My hair comes out shiny, smooth and straight.  I have only used it twice, so I may be following up with an additional review, but I am very pleased with my purchase.</li>
    <li> UPDATE: After 2 years of use Still working exactly as when it was new!  Would purchase again!  ORIGINAL REVIEW: Only 4 stars because you have to pinch it just a little too much to get the flats together good on both sides. Heat is perfect. Size is perfect.  Never accidentally turn it off while using it. Digital read out is great. Heats up really quick.</li>
    <li> Great flat iron and heats up fast..... Love the auto shutoff since I always forget to turn it off!</li>
    <li> I got this straightner a few months ago and absolutely loved it.  I could straighten my hair in a quick time, and becuase the straightner got hot on the back, i was also able to curl my hair with it.. 2 in 1 great plus.  But a few months after i got it it completely quit working.  I was using it and it just shorted out, i couldn&#x27;t turn the power on or anything.  I was very disapointed that i had to go out and by another straightner yet again.</li>
    <li> Great product for the price! Fast shipping. I wasn&#x27;t sure about buying this product because of the price but I&#x27;m glad I did. Works great!</li>
    <li> My previous hair straightener was a titanium one and I had it for like 8 or 9 years and I absolutely loved it but the stuff was coming off the metal and making my hair very staticky so it was time for a new one. I purchased this one and I almost sent it back because it doesn&#x27;t close all the way and I have to press kinda hard to close it but when I looked at my old straightener its actually the same way but I never felt like I had to press really hard to get it to straighten my hair. Aside from that, it does work really good and it makes my hair really soft, which is the reason I kept it. I&#x27;ve used ceramic in the past and it just made my hair really staticky as well. If you have hair thats longer than your shoulders, I would get the 2 inch. My previous straightener was a 2 inch and I purchased the 1 inch for this one and I think that might be the problem I&#x27;m having with it not straightening my hair as fast.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my 16 yr old because her old one that lasted 3 years at the salon we go to(it cost 85.00)is just worn out, it still works just not too good. She loves this NEW Remington. I opened the box before she got home from school and noticed it was nice quality and pretty color but she is the one who will be using it. After using the Remington straightener her hair was so smooth and perfectly straight(and she is very picky about hair, make up &amp; clothes)when she 1st tried it. She has used it everyday since then. Her hair is very thick and natural wavy and hard to straighten so that shows me this is sturdy and worth the money. Great buy so far and I would recommend this item.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a nice and usefull thing with a low price ;) It needs only seconds to get worm and works great. For normal (and not profesional) users, I think there&#x27;s no use to bye  more expensive one.</li>
    <li> It works pretty well the only thing is that I live outside the US and someone brought it over for me and it has an electrical problem that it turns off on its own sometimes so I can´t change it.</li>
    <li> It works better than some of the more expensive ones. My hair is soooo straight. I can&#x27;t believe how reasonable it was!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I have been flat ironing my hair for almost 10 years now. I have tried MANY different flat irons, from CHI, Tigi, Sedu, Vidal Sassoon, GHD, Revlon, and the list goes on. I&#x27;ve used flat irons that have pulled my hair out, mysteriously stopped working within weeks of purchase, fried my hair, etc. Out of all the different flat irons I&#x27;ve used, the Remington S9500 is my absolute favorite. This product makes my hair look better than products that cost 5x as much!! My friend has absolutely gorgeous, shiny hair, and I asked her what products and tools she uses in her daily routine. She told me about the Remington S9500 and after reading amazing reviews on it, I had to go get it for myself. After using it the first time, I was in love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It heats up SUPER quick- like within 20 seconds quick (on the turbo setting), and beeps to let you know it&#x27;s ready!! If you&#x27;re like me and are forgetful when you&#x27;re in a hurry, don&#x27;t worry- this product has automatic shut-off after 1 hour. The movement is very smooth and it glides like butter. I have very thick hair and flat iron my hair in 3 different layers, but I only have to go over each piece of hair 1 time. I haven&#x27;t had that luck with many other flat irons. This product literally cut my styling time in half!! The controls are digital, so it&#x27;s easy to see exactly what temperature it&#x27;s at. My favorite thing about this straightener is that it makes my hair shiny, silky, and leaves it without any frizz. I can&#x27;t say enough about how amazing this product is. Try it for yourself-- you&#x27;ll thank me later. ;)</li>
    <li> This flat iron has been a step up from my previous hair straightener experiences. It is convenient to use as it heats up in 60 seconds and has a nice little beeping noise to tell you when it&#x27;s fully heated.      I have very thick hair and I really like that there are several heat levels that you can set it at depending on your hair type. My previous hair straightener ended up not working due to issues with the cord, but so far this straightener has held together perfectly.    My one critique would be that it seems slightly more suited for shorter hair due to the narrowness of the rod.     Overall, it&#x27;s a solid product that I&#x27;ve been using for a couple months and have been quite pleased with it.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift for my sister.  She loves it. Says it heats up quickly and loves the temperature range.  Reccommended.</li>
    <li> Very easy to use- takes me 15 mins for med-long hair. Love it a lot!</li>
    <li> I got another Remington straightener a year and a half ago (it was the one with teflon fiber plates) which I absolutely loved! My hair is fairly straight but it dries weird and has a bit of wave to it and the teflon flat iron worked really well and left my hair soft and shiny. And it worked extremely well at curling my hair. The curl would last all day and worked better than any curling iron I&#x27;ve ever used (I have fine hair, so to get my hair to hold a curl has always been a challenge) Anyways, after a year and a half it quit working so I headed to the store and looked at other Remington flat irons. They didn&#x27;t have the same kind I got before so I decided to get the one with pearl infused plates. It works as good as the other at straightening my hair (I even think it makes my hair look more shiny and smooth) but when I tried to curl it the plates didn&#x27;t grip well and my hair would fall out :( It is a STRAIGHTENER and not a curler so I wasn&#x27;t too upset and I&#x27;m still pleased with the product but I had to order another teflon flat iron just so i&#x27;ll be able to curl my hair again. This straightener works very well though and most people will be satisfied with their purchase.</li>
    <li> I had high hopes from this iron. It does make your hair smooth and silky but it leaves your hands tired. I have tried my neighbor&#x27;s iron and it doesn&#x27;t make you feel so tired. Also, after straightening you will get the perfect look but after some time they will not remain as straight as they looked before. Now, I was facing this issue and was tired of straightening again and again, esp with this iron. But now I have learned the trick and my hair remain the same even next day.&lt;br /&gt;The trick is to iron very small sections of hair and iron nicely, start from back. Well it&#x27;s a good buy but my hands get tired holding it.</li>
    <li> Love this one so much, very good condition! Function very well</li>
    <li> I ordered this straightener about 3 months ago. At first, I absolutely LOVED it because of the temperature display and how hot it got.  It has only been 3 months and I only use it about twice a week and it has already crapped out completely.  You definitely get what you pay for. Major waste of money!</li>
    <li> Best straightener I have ever bought!</li>
    <li> Best hair straightener I have owned.  Heats up super fast, and then straightens very quickly, generally with one sweep.  Hair looks salon straightened without the frizzy split end results that come from some of the cheaper hair straighteners.  I will have to look at Remington products more closely; this seems to be a very good quality product.</li>
    <li> I bought this to replace my Chi straigtner that had broken, and so far it has worked pretty well.  The adjustable temperature is nice and also the lock on the bottom.  The best bonus is the four year warranty, which is great.</li>
    <li> good product with great price ... Thanks for cooperating</li>
    <li> Love it best straightener I&#x27;ve ever owned !💘</li>
    <li> so far so good. heats very fast and leaves my hair smooth and shiny. very lightweight and i&#x27;m not sure if that&#x27;s a good thing.</li>
    <li> This is the best hair straightener I have ever had and its inexpensice. Heats up in 15-20secs!!! I love that you can alter the settings using the (+) &amp; (-) buttons and if your hold down on either of these buttons for 5 secs you can lock in your heat setting so that you hands do not change or turn the iron off while using in! Heats up Instantly, does not burn hair (however please use heat protectant/Tresseme) and it goes as high as 450 degrees. I&#x27;m a african/american so for those who wear extensions or even your natural hair it does wonders it straightens your hair instantly while giving it a natural shine and you hair. Before I used this item on my hair I got an OLD, COARSE tangled piece of hair extension and I brushed it out as much as I could spray a small bit of oil sheen set iron to about 400 and as soon as I started pressing the hair got straight, light and fluffy as if it were brand new. This iron brings old extensions back to life LOL (Reuseable again). Item is as just decribed in the promo video and pictures. I 100% recommend this product!! Excellent Product Amazon or Remington!!</li>
    <li> After years of straightening my hair, I have never owned a ceramic. I finally decided it was time to upgrade and decided on this one. It heats up incredibly fast. No more waiting forever for my straightener to get hot. It&#x27;s super smooth and just glides over your hair. It&#x27;s wonderful and I&#x27;m enjoying it, plus the color is a great little bonus.</li>
    <li> Heats up very fast and straightens my hair super good. I have paid for countless other VERY expensive hair straighteners in the past and they littleraly have NO comparison to this one!!</li>
    <li> I bought this straightener for my daughter. She has hair almost to her waist and it&#x27;s thick. It is naturally wavy/loose curly if she leaves it alone. This straightener heats up quickly and straightens on the first pass. The cord is long enough to reach the outlet but doesn&#x27;t get tangled up. She&#x27;s been using it for four years with no problems.</li>
    <li> This straightner broke after using 5 times. It wasnt dropped. It just stopped working. P.O.S. Dont waste your time or money. Have you ever heard &amp;#34;you get what you pay for&amp;#34;?</li>
    <li> Best flat iron I&#x27;ve ever had and used. I would definitely recommend it to anyone looking to buy a new one.</li>
    <li> Generally speaking I am skeptical about all products until I use them.  I have been using a HerStyler for a few years until recently when the plates cracked.  I really didn&#x27;t want to spend another $100 on a straightener so I decided to give this one a try.  When it arrived I noticed right away that it is not very heavy which is a trait I like in my hair tools, but even so it works really well.  It heats up very quick and does a great job at styling with shine.  I am definitely happy that I decided to take a chance on this instead of shelling out the cash for a more expensive one.</li>
    <li> I purchased this iron after returning the andis from wal-mart because it did not meet my hair&#x27;s expectations. I had a bad feeling the remington would be a joke because I&#x27;ve bought hair tools by them before a long time ago and they were terrible but I must say this flat iron truly surprised me! I loved the way it looked,the digital temp.,how fast it heated up and the fact that it&#x27;s so narrow I can get very close to my head. I also loved how hot it got and that it pulled my hair the least out of all the flat irons I&#x27;ve owned! The best part is probably the price! It&#x27;s really a steal! I was ready to break down and buy a very expensive flat iron if this one didn&#x27;t do the trick and so far it looks like I&#x27;m gonna be able to save that money! I hope it lasts since this IS only my first day to own it. I have very stubborn,thick,curly hair and nothing has been able to straighten it like this one except maybe the GVP I owned a while back that broke after dropping it one too many times. I was able to straighten my hair in one pass! If you don&#x27;t want to spend a butt load on a flat iron and still get straight hair, this is the flat iron for you! I also flipped my hair out very easily : )</li>
    <li> This hair straightener seems to do what it is supposed to do.  The fact that it heats up so quickly is a big plus.  The only complaint is the unit seems to make your hand hot so if you have really thick or super frizzy hair I think that could be problematic.  All in all I think it&#x27;s a good product that is reasonably priced.  I&#x27;m sure there are better quality straighteners out there but the price would be prohibitive to most of us.  So if you&#x27;re looking for a mid-range, decent quality straightener then I would recommend this to you.</li>
    <li> I bought this straightener to replace my 8 year old Wingo that just wasn&#x27;t heating up like it used to. I did a bunch of research and was hoping to avoid the high prices of the CHI. I bought this sucker hoping (rather guardedly) that it may just do the trick.    Pros:  * Light weight    * Heats up quick! (it hit 400 in like 10 seconds!)     Cons:  * The outside gets hot! I had to hold the straightener at the very end not to overheat my hand.This left my hand tired and me feeling like I wasn&#x27;t getting a good grip on my hair.    * Took several passes to get my hair looking even close to as straight as my defunct current straightener does.     * Left my hair frizzy.     While this is a cute little straightener, I cannot recommend it to anyone. Its going back!</li>
    <li> This is my first flat iron, although I&#x27;ve borrowed a few others.  I bought it for my sister because sales people I talked to at Ulta recommended it above many of their more expensive products (below $100).  My sister and I both have fairly straight natural hair and really just use it when we have a few kinks from air drying.  So far we both absolutely love it--we can get our hair done in 2-3 minutes tops.  It heats up ridiculously fast and I really like the temperature display/settings that are super convenient.  The iron also looks pretty well made and sturdy. I&#x27;m not sure how to compare it to other flat irons in the shine department, but the woman I talked to about it said the pearls really made a difference for her over other products.  Also this product has a 5 year warranty which is pretty awesome.  The only drawback I could see from this item is that it does not firmly close all the way.  I have pretty thin hair and it doesn&#x27;t make a difference to me, but my hair is almost perfectly straight naturally.  I could see it being a pain if your hair was really really thin and not near-straight because then you might have to hold both ends of the straightener to clamp it shut.  For me though, this was a great buy+ cheaper than in stores.</li>
    <li> My old straightener died shortly after going to college.  Thankfully my roomie had a brand new chi which she was happy to share with me.  Really the chi was an upgrade from my old one, and I got used to having a high quality iron.  By the time that winter break came around my hair stylist was shocked at how fried my hair was from the high temperatures.  So I bought this version instead of using the chi, and I couldn&#x27;t be happier with it!  The plates rarely ever snag my hairs, they heat evenly, and I can adjust the temperature to suit my hair type.  Also I like that it beeps to remind you when it is ready.  The chi had a very distinct smell, but this one does not and I have found it easy to clean the plates with a damp cloth.  The locking tab is also awesome and makes storage easy.  At first the locking mechanism was very difficult to use but it became looser after a few uses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After buying this version I saw the &amp;#34;same thing&amp;#34; at walmart for about $7 less.  The walmart one lacked features and only went up to 400 degrees! So far my straightener has been working for 2.5 years and I think that it was worth every penny!  My mother in law bought one too and loves it just as much as I do.  Don&#x27;t waste your money on a chi, this one is much better!</li>
    <li> My wife reviewed this product and stopped using it after only two days and switched back to her regular hair straightener. Granted, the one she currently owns is more than twice the cost of this model. But I guess when it comes to these devices you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> The main reason i got this was for the auto shut off feature because i&#x27;ve been having a mommy brain lately.  Price is just right for the quality! This just glides on my hair and easily flattens my hair in minutes!</li>
    <li> My wife loves it says it works great n she is very picky</li>
    <li> Spectacular, works beautifully.</li>
    <li> Heats up fast and you set the temp that you want. This really works very well and makes your hair so shiny. I have long curly hair and can straighten my hair in half the time my old one took. Very very happy with it! Price was great for something that works so well!!! I haven&#x27;t had a problem with it burning my fingers like some reviews stated because your supposed to have your hands on the handle not on the other end :)</li>
    <li> When this arrived I couldn&#x27;t believe how pretty it was until I took it out of the package and half of the rhinestones were laying in the bag. However I glued them back in and it&#x27;s fine but the other stones randomly fall out. Still a pretty case.</li>
    <li> Heats up in less than 30 seconds.  It&#x27;s the perfect size.  I use this at home.  It heats fast - does the job and I&#x27;m out the door.  Ceramic makes it very protective of your hair.</li>
    <li> pro: it heats up very fast&lt;br /&gt;cons: doesn&#x27;t make my hair smooth and feels really rough on my hair when I straighten my hair</li>
    <li> Remington S9500 Salon Collection Digital Ceramic Hair Straightener with Pearl Infused Wide Plates, 1 Inch&lt;br /&gt;...Very beautiful make the hairline in a very magnificence .. The Amazon deal is very beautiful .. thank you for your products Fine...Great loved it too</li>
    <li> I think this is fair - nothing special.  Catches on my hair sometimes.</li>
    <li> I got this hair straightner because I was getting tired of my old 1, but I don&#x27;t think this product is worth the price. I have wavy hair thats probably 16 or 17 inches long and when I straightned my hair with this straightner my hair would get caught in between the metal and the hot plates and literally pull out 2 or 3 hairs, unless I absolutely made sure my hair was centered in the middle of the plate. I would not buy this product again, just because my hair is already thin enough and I don&#x27;t think any hair straightner should pull out your hair because of the way it is constructed. Thank you:]</li>
    <li> This is my second Remington straightener, and I have to say if performs well.  My hair is thick and wavy to curly depending on the day, but this unit gives me straight hair on a medium heat setting.  I love the swivel cord and the easy of setting the temperature.  I do not love that the handle gets hotter the longer the unit is on, and the fact that the safety shut-off takes an hour to kick in.  All in all a good choice for anyone in the market for a straightener as long as you remember to turn it off!</li>
    <li> Really enjoy this product, I was going on a trip and it fit perfectly tucked away in my carry on luggage, really love the quick heat, I mean FAST...its not the most amazing one out there but for the price, it does it&#x27;s job.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this flat iron for MAYBE 4 months now, and just today it stopped working out of nowhere. It was fine yesterday, its been on my counter since then and when i went to use it this morning...nothing. I turned on, but it never heated up. Also i had started noticing how it was getting less hot over time. I would always have it on the max heat, but it wouldn&#x27;t feel like it. I would have to turn the heat down, wait, and then turn the heat up to max for it to work. And it also pulls my hair alot, it freaking hurts! all in all....i don&#x27;t like it. If i were you i would get a different one. or if you do get this, be sure to keep your receipt (bought mine from a store not amazon) so i can&#x27;t use the warranty. Luckily I fixed my old chi. rewired it, has electrical tape around it, but at least it works!</li>
    <li> I received a faulty unit, took me a few days before I noticed something wasn&#x27;t right with it. It would turn itself off if you move the cord which is pretty frequent. When it did work though before it turned off, I would say it&#x27;s a good product for the price I paid. This is not as good as my GHD but heats up quick, adustable heat settings and does a fairly good job at straightening my hair. I do feel it&#x27;s not as great to handle as a GHD but for this price, you&#x27;ll get used to it.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great! Heats up fast, and works perfectly on my hair! (That is very thick). You will not regret buying this!</li>
    <li> It leaves my hair looking so silky and it actually straightens my hair! I&#x27;ve gone through multiple hair straighteners and most of them either burn my hair, or don&#x27;t straighten it well enough. My hair is pretty thick too, and I live near the beach so my hair frizzes up too quick, but after getting this straightener it actually stays really straight!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this product! Works better than most expensive hair straighteners!</li>
    <li> Im very picky with hair striaghtners. Ive gone thru so many of them in.just the past few years. But this one is amazing with how much i change my hair styles.</li>
    <li> It heats up super fast and has a wide range of temperature options. It also cools down fairly quickly. I like how it is this so it is great for not only straightening but also even styling. I use it to curve my bangs so they don&#x27;t just hang down and a friend with the same straightener uses hers to flip out her short hair. I would highly recommend this product. Great deal for the price. I had a cheaper conair straightener before. It was a wider one, and it wasn&#x27;t terrible, other than that it would occasionally rip out a few strands of hair. ...That was unpleasant. Haven&#x27;t had any problems like that with this would. You should buy it. :)</li>
    <li> I loved! It works perfectly!</li>
    <li> This straightener is not what I had hoped for.  The price is really good, but it didn&#x27;t seem to get as hot as I would like and definitely doesn&#x27;t have a tight grip on your hair.  I am just worried it won&#x27;t last longer than a year or so.  It does heat up very quickly and was delivered with-in 7-10 days of ordering it. I decided to spend the extra $30 and get a Chi.</li>
    <li> I like this straightener! it heats up quickly and does the job.  The only thing is, it seems to leave my hair with some static. It could be this time of the year though(Dec).  I would recommend this tool, it is a good one!!!</li>
    <li> Very good product! I love mine!! I use my straightener every day. I would recommend not using it on the hottest setting because it gets super hot! And fast too!</li>
    <li> Has long plates!  They are really smoth! Heats up super fast! Has a hinge lock! Plates open wider than my Jiberé De Paris iron.   The only thing I didn&#x27;t like so much was that the plates touch each other on one end, and, on the other end (the end towards the hinge) they don&#x27;t really touch; they stay about 1mm apart, then you have to squeeze harder. But other than that I&#x27;m happy. I even considered buying more expensive ones but I&#x27;m glad I got this one. And YES, you can curl your hair with it as long as you know how!!! Watch a couple of you tube videos!!</li>
    <li> Heats up really fast and straightens w/o issue.  I am able to create \\&quot;flips\\&quot; at the ends with no problem.  At first I was having issues with it taking many passes to straighten and then I noticed that that plates only really met at the very end unless you squeeze them closed.  I didn&#x27;t need to do that with my old one, but old took a lot longer to heat up and didn&#x27;t get as hot either, so as far as I&#x27;m concerned it&#x27;s a small price to pay.  No burns, hair is soft, straightener glides right over hair....  Love it!  I love most Remington products and they seem to last much longer than any other brand I have bought.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t say enough wonderful things about this item.  My hair is softer and smoother than when I use other flat irons.  The sides are curved which I think makes it easier to use and easier on my hair.  No pulling or breaking of hair.  You can even get curls.</li>
    <li> Works Great...I love it!</li>
    <li> Could be my own use of the product, but it broke within 6 months. Doesn&#x27;t turn on.</li>
    <li> I love this flat iron, it worked wonderfully on many different hair textures. The only thing is that it is so strong that if you have curly hair and use it on the highest temperature, you&#x27;re curls will be very dull once you wash your hair again.</li>
    <li> This flat iron does nothing but burn the hair. I wish I could throw this flat&lt;br /&gt;iron on the person who made it. It smokes and it turns brown. It burns the hair.&lt;br /&gt;If the makers of this flat iron could feel the heat on their face the way&lt;br /&gt;it burns the hair, you would be burned up. Don&#x27;t make anymore of this crap&lt;br /&gt;you sick desperate people.</li>
    <li> I have been using TStudio products for a while now, because they are just so good for the price compared with other high price brands out there, that don&#x27;t even last a year and most of them are fakes.  This one is perfect because it brings a 450F temperature, the new plates are better than the old models (doesn&#x27;t pull your hair): Perfect to perfomr keratine treatment at home!.</li>
    <li> I have thick and long hair but this iron works great and super fast, it&#x27;s almost like the one-pass irons</li>
    <li> This flat iron leaves my hair smooth and shiney.  Love the digital settings.  Have recommended to friends who also say they love it.</li>
    <li> Works for straightening and I love the features.  Unfortunately, I purchased this for its won&#x27;t-dry-out-your-hair technology and it took me months to grow out my fried, frizzy hair after less than two weeks of use (yes, it was used properly, no wet hair, etc). I&#x27;ll never use it again.</li>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t sure I would be happy with a 1&amp;#34; plate for my longer than average hair. Pleasantly surprised when I gave it the first trial run. Put it to the test and tried it out on my still damp hair (NOT WET!!!!) and it handled it just fine. Dried and straightened it perfectly. And love the way it can handle large to just pieces (i actually curled pieces of my hair with it)&lt;br /&gt;The price was a wow once I actually seen how it performed. I&#x27;ve had a Paul Mitchel and a Chi straightener at $100. + In price and this one performs right up their.</li>
    <li> This iron heats up in a matter of seconds (beeps when ready) and straightens hair extremely quickly.  It is lightweight, has a swivel cord, and locks closed when you put it away.  It has all the features a hair iron should have with a reasonable price tag.  I only have one problem with it: I have fine hair and the lowest temp setting is 300 degrees, which still sizzles my hair.  It&#x27;s not that bad that I can&#x27;t/don&#x27;t use it, but it defenitely doesn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling smooth.  I usually have a few flyaways and fried ends.</li>
    <li> I have coarse, thick wavy hair. I had a revlon pro heat that only made my hair frizzy! Such a piece of junk. My sister swears by Remington so I decided to give this one a try. It&#x27;s great, especially for the price! I get fast, long lasting results. It&#x27;s sleek and very comfortable to hold. I do find that I have to have it pretty high but that&#x27;s probably b/c of my hair texture. The plates \\&quot;float\\&quot; meaning that when you close the iron there is a small gap between the plates. This is a feature meant for thick hair so I wouldn&#x27;t get this iron if your hair is on the thinner side. But this feature works wonderfully for my thick hair. The iron glides right through without snagging. I love this line so much, I bought the ceramic pearl curling wand that goes with it. Recommend this highly.</li>
    <li> I gifted this straightener to my sister and the very first day she started using, it did not heat up.Very disappointed!!</li>
    <li> I purchased this flat iron because I needed one that would heat to 450 degrees, for the Brazilian blowouts that I do on myself at home. I wanted one that was reasonably priced, without being a piece of junk. So far, I love the results. The iron heats up quickly and runs through my hair smoothly and effortlessly. It leaves my hair sleek and shiny. It is better than straighteners I bought at more than 2x the price.</li>
    <li> reason being because it only gets but so hot and it dont even straighten the hair and i have wavy hair and as u pass it tru u smell like burning from the flat iron.</li>
    <li> I bought the S9500 about a month ago and I love it! I have been using a CHI for the last couple of years. However, I have very naturally curly hair and it&#x27;s kind of coarse too. My CHI was the original one so it didn&#x27;t have a heat adjustment. It was just not straightening my hair like I thought it should. I took a chance and bought the S9500 and I didn&#x27;t know that my hair could get that straight!!! It is a wonderful iron and I recommend it to people with hair like mine.</li>
    <li> I borrowed these from my next door neighbor and instantly fell in love with them. I looked hard for a flat iron that would straighten my natural hair without passing it over one piece a thousand times and these were it. great and  inexpensive</li>
    <li> I have the 2 inch one and best straightener I have ever purchased.  Planning on getting the entire pearl series. The 1 inch straightener, the 2 curling wands and blow dryer.</li>
    <li> Not for thick hair. My hair is permed a ND compared to the grocery store flat iron thus is a 1.</li>
    <li> I love this hair straightener. It heats up so quickly and works so well. With just one stroke, the hair falls right into place. It also does not snag my hair at all. I would definitely recommend it especially given the super reasonable price.</li>
    <li> I have tried so many flat irons and they all let me down. This one however is great! Great price! Great product! Not only can you flat iron your hair but you can curl the ends with this! I love it!</li>
    <li> Love it! Heats up fast &amp; works well. Good item for the price.</li>
    <li> As someone who straightens her hair most days, I would recommend this Remington.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My favorite feature is the automatic shut-off after one hour.  This is the number one reason I would suggest getting this straightener.  There are many times I&#x27;ve arrived at work worried that I would burn the house down because I forgot to shut off my Chi hair straightener but this feature eased that fear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The straightener was slim and easy to maneuver however it did slip in my hands on more than one occasion and gave me a quick burn.  A better gripping surface would improve this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, the straightener worked well.  It heats up very quickly and provided sleek, straight hair.  The slim design also makes it easy to create waves.</li>
    <li> I was previously using a CHI for years, but when mine finally needed replacing, the new CHI was just not the same quality as before. After some research I decided on the Remington S9500 and I am so glad I did. I immediately noticed improvements in my hair texture as the temperature control allows you to find the ideal setting for your hair so that it doesn&#x27;t break or get as damaged. It also heats up quickly and shuts itself off after awhile, which is nice to keep in the back of your mind should you ever leave the house without turning it off. Should this device ever get lost, I would most definitely replace it with this same model.</li>
    <li> I loved this straightener while it lasted. I had it for about 2 years, but every Remington I&#x27;ve ever owned has capped out after a couple years of owning it. It straightens well and makes awesome curls, but if you want a long lasting straightener this isn&#x27;t the one for you. Great quality for the price.</li>
    <li> This was exactly what i wanted, something easy to use and the results were great! Awesome for both straightening hair and curling!</li>
    <li> Came ontime and works great</li>
    <li> I purchased this after using my nieces and I will never have a different straightener again! It heats up quickly, changes temperature quickly and gets the job done. I have thick, wavy hair and this gets it stick straight. Great straightener at a great price!</li>
    <li> I love this hair straightener.  The pearl plate makes your hair glide through effortlessly and adds&lt;br /&gt;shine to your hair.  I bought the Remington Pro and it does not work as well as this hair straightener.</li>
    <li> I really like this hair straightener. It makes my hair really smooth. The only problem I had was like what other people said, my hair would get stuck and yank my hair out. Anyway though I still love the hair straightener. It doesn&#x27;t bother me that much. I also like how it has a hinge lock. Thats really helpful for traveling. :)</li>
    <li> The Remington straightener gets hot very quickly and does a good job with straightening. the only issue I had was that my hair smelled slightly burnt after using it but that was actually my fault because I set the heat too high. All around good product.</li>
    <li> I have had this straightener for around 6 months now and use it a lot. I bought it at Target And i have to say this is the best flat iron i have ever had! I had a Con-air for a long time and it was okay at the time but i broke it in half when it was in my travel bag, i had a clumsy moment and stepped on it somehow(stupid).&lt;br /&gt;  Anyways my search for a new one began and all i knew is that i wanted one with ceramic plates that was a decent price. I always thought i needed one with wide plates to get the job done, because i have VERY THICK hair, but this one works AWESOME even without wide plates!. No matter what its going to take time to properly fix MY hair. But with this product it helps that it heats up and is ready before you know it! Some reviews said that it left their hair too dry and crispy (so to speak)....I am sorry but i don&#x27;t know of any straighteners or curling irons that are damage free but in all seriousness this one wont damage your hair if you use it properly. If the heat is too much for your hair than turn the heat down! Its just that easy ;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here are the PROS:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Heats up super FAST!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  It swivels so you don&#x27;t mess up or tangle the chord.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  You can control the temperature. It goes up to 450 degrees (the temp reads digital too which i love)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Best of all is that it has a handy LOCK so you can keep it closed when you store it, and makes it perfect for travel! So i wont have to worry about it getting broken in half like my last one. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Ceramic plates for less damage to your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Good price for such a nice product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Long Chord.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Its pretty sleek too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  CONS:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Honestly can&#x27;t think of anything. If i wanted to improve it more it may be nice if it had one of those spiral springy chords (...maybe?...i haven&#x27;t had one like that so i wouldn&#x27;t know for sure if those chords are any handier). Really though i have no complaints about the chord as it is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really can&#x27;t imagine why anyone wouldn&#x27;t like this straightener! Take it from me its nice for the price, you get your moneys worth. Can&#x27;t go wrong with this one. I would buy it again and recommend to all my friends.&lt;br /&gt;Happy straightening!chord as it is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really can&#x27;t imagine why anyone wouldn&#x27;t like this straightener! Take it from me its nice for the price, you get your moneys worth. Can&#x27;t go wrong with this one. I would buy it again and recommend to all my friends.&lt;br /&gt;Happy straightening!</li>
    <li> I am A.A with  MBL (mid back length--I&#x27;m approaching WL!!! Yay!!!) hair in the 3C/4A texture zone. For the past 7 months, I have been taking on this hair journey (I am going natural) and I was thinking about buying a CHI flat iron as my cousin is a licensed cosmetologist and has recommended me on several occasions to get one. I then started looking at the Remington Pearl curling wand (which I also purchased when I purchased this---LOVE THEM BOTH!!) and read the reviews for this straightener and decided to give this a try. Hooonnneeeeeyyyyy, when I say that this straightener is the absolute TRUTH, BELIEVE IT!!!! I only put heat on my hair 1-2 a month and when I use this straightener, there is NO NEED to EVER get a relaxer again!!!!! It heats up in literally 20 seconds and gets the job done fast!!!! It takes me a good 30-40 minutes to completely flat iron my hair bone straight and that&#x27;s amazing since it normally takes me a good hour to do so. I let my cousin borrow it and she didn&#x27;t want to give it back!!! She thought it was the CHI iron I was looking at ($85 smh) and once she realized it was made by Remington, she was flabbergasted!!! I saved $60 and It acts just as better (if not better lol) and I am soooo glad I read the reviews on here before purchasing the other iron. Thanks everyone who has written an review...you saved me lol :)</li>
    <li> SInce I got this, I&#x27;ve been very happy with the results. It really heats fast and the temperatura set helps to achive the perfect heat.&lt;br /&gt;soft and shinny hair its what you are going to get from this</li>
    <li> I have a new PHI hair straightener that I bought because of the reviews.  But I was frustrated at how long it took to straighten my fairly long, wavy hair.  Then I bought this one and WOW!  My hair is straight in less than half the time of the PHI.  Would definitely buy again!</li>
    <li> It was the best straitner I ever had it came as it said and now I got a new one.</li>
    <li> Before I purchased this straightener I had the In-styler. When I first got it, the In-styler worked great. After a few months, it started turning off literally every two seconds &amp; it didn&#x27;t get very hot at all. Now, with my new Remington straightener, it heats up so fast &amp; straightens my hair in only fifteen minutes. It leaves it sleek &amp; shiney. I only have to go over a peice that I would like to straighten two times for it to become perfectly straight. However, with the In-styler it would take me at least an hour, having to go over peices of my hair several times. Although the barrel of the straightener gets too hot to touch so I cannot help my hair through, it still works remarkably.</li>
    <li> This was ordered as a gift for my 13 year old daughter and wow!  It is light weight, has clear and easy to use settings, and heats up very quickly.  My daughter likes that the temperature settings are digital :)  She and I have very long (waist length) hair and this straightener works like a charm! .</li>
    <li> So far I have no complaints for this product.  It heats up quickly and functions just fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I was wary of was the packaging.  It came inside of a plastic baggie within the shipment box.  The instruction manual was included, but nothing else. Just made me nervous, but product is fully functional</li>
    <li> Purchased for the wife as a Christmas gift. She was looking at a more expensive product, but now is very pleasantly surprised at how good it works. They quality is very good. No complaints as of yet and it is used on a daily bases.Very impressed with product and would recommend!</li>
    <li> i finally bought a new straightener after having my other one for 6+ years...this one is great so far! it&#x27;s so much more light weight than my old one, heats up fast, and straightens very easily. price is awesome and so far, the straightener is too!</li>
    <li> I use mine to curl my hair mostly and it works wonderfully for that. It heats up FAST and sometimes I even use it on wet hair. It&#x27;s the best straightener I&#x27;ve had so far!</li>
    <li> By far THE best flat iron I&#x27;ve ever bought! I have bought others from Walmart and Sally Beauty supply and they just don&#x27;t measure up to this one. This is my 3rd one I&#x27;ve bought. I use this daily on my 2 girls, friends and myself.</li>
    <li> Simple to use and is as described. It was a gift for my mom and she really likes it alot.</li>
    <li> Fast heating (only a few seconds). Plenty temperature settings for my preference. Silky straight like professional without feeling burnt or hair damaged. The outer shell wouldn&#x27;t feel the heat even on highest temperature, keeping hands safe. The connection between wire and straightener can be adjusted swiftly in 360 degrees. Lock button feature is good, keeping it safe from children. I would recommend it to friends.</li>
    <li> I already had one of these but I fried it when my converter malfunctioned in England. I had it for over 2 years and it still worked like new. I absolutely love this iron.  It is better then the professional one I bought from the hair salon, which only lasted a little over a year after the warranty wore off and it cost 4 times as much.  I would recommend this to anyone.  It gets just as hot as a hair salon iron.</li>
    <li> My daughter received this as a birthday present and was very pleased with the hair straightener. It works good and arrived quickly.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this for years now and its still going strong!</li>
    <li> I used this product as soon as I got it, I have had experience with many different brand name flatirons ( chi, babybliss, sedu, etc) I have very thick and long hair and this product heated up very quickly with no problem. Left my hair shiny and smooth and was so easy to use! I love this and would recommend it to anyone!</li>
    <li> Great purchase. High quality for a great price.  This is the product I came to after a good amount of research.</li>
    <li> This arrived earlier then time and it work perfectly. I like the fact that your able to lock settings and can adjust the heat temperature.</li>
    <li> I have been using this iron for about a year and have had no problems with it. I would buy it again. Heats quickly, works well.</li>
    <li> Best flat iron I&#x27;ve purchased. It heats up really quickly and I love the size-- it allows it to act as a curling iron as well if you twirl your hair around it.</li>
    <li> I purchased this remington hair straightener months ago for a very low price. I&#x27;ve been very pleased with it. It heats up super quickly. It straightens without leaving lines in my hair or frying it. It works on both damp and dry hair. Light weight, easy to use and easy to clean. Better than the expenisive ones sitting in my bathroom drawer.</li>
    <li> It was a great  purchase. I&#x27;ve had it for several months now.  Easy to Clean . I use a pressing oil on my hair as I use the iron.  Just great.  Saves me tons of salon cash.</li>
    <li> I have had this straightener before but in the 2inch one. I got it in my local drugstore when I was 15 years old and lasted me till I was 19. I had been looking for these again once that one bit the bullet. They sell this straightener in my local drugstore but for three times the price. Amazon was a better choice!!! Needless to say I am happy with the brand and the quality of their straighteners and glade I found this one. The review Is more based on my old one since I have not used my new one with the winter weather I have been having. I&#x27;ll make an update soon. But I can already tell I am going to love it!!</li>
    <li> It arrived on time. I wish it was thicker but other than that it&#x27;s great. Came with a few minor scratches on it. I have thick hair so i wasn&#x27;t sure how well it would work but so far so good.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d recommend this product! It heats quickly and has a swivel cord.&lt;br /&gt;I have not tried it in Europe yet but will probably use a converter when I do.</li>
    <li> So I just got this flat iron yesterday and I love it. I had this 4 yr old relvon flat iron that i loved so  much until one day it went on the fritz and shorted out half my house. So i decided to get this as a replacement. The design is awesome love the digital display, gets hot really fast and is easy to maneuver. Seems worth it for the price no complaints.</li>
    <li> It worked great - while it lasted. Broke after 2nd use.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used the best flat irons. I have owned many Chi irons and a few Paul Mitchell. This is better. The reason I say it&#x27;s better is because of the heat and  the way it works not the price. When you have curly hair price isn&#x27;t a factor, so when you find something like this you have to shout it. I bought this iron because my PM finally just stopped heating up. I needed something quick and cheap. I read all the reviews on many irons. This iron heats up beyond 450 degrees. I can&#x27;t recommend this iron enough. It&#x27;s fantastic. You will not be disappointed. I then purchased the pink curling iron with the glove and love it too.</li>
    <li> Wow what a waste of money.  It&#x27;s been less than 2 months and it no longer works-- at all.  I learned my lesson to stick with professional brands in the future.  I cannot believe all the good reviews for this flat iron and it makes me wonder if I received a defective or used model.  I&#x27;ve gone through plenty of straighteners ranging from $20-$120 and have never had an experience where a new one stopped working after barely any use.  Every straightener I&#x27;ve owned has lasted for at least a couple of years so this was a huge disappointment.  I would not recommend this straightener to anyone I know.</li>
    <li> This is such a great straightener. My hair is soft after straightening. It does dry my hair and make it frizzy.</li>
    <li> We were not sure we would like it because of the price but come to find out....we LOVED IT!!! It works better than any other product that we have purchased.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s only been a few days so far but everything works great! My girlfriend uses it every day and she likes the way it feels and the digital display. Would definitely recommend for the price!</li>
    <li> i got it fast and it works good :] it straightens hair perfect and i hope you guys would give it a try too!</li>
    <li> This makes great curls but I burn my fingers a lot on this.  There is no protection from the plates on the sides and when I am turning it to make the curls, my index finger tends to close down on the plates.  I only use this when making curls in the front of my hair where I can see my fingers.</li>
    <li> This is an amazing flatiron. I&#x27;m a hair salon owner and it&#x27;s better then flatirons I&#x27;ve paid over $150.00 for! Heats to 450</li>
    <li> My sister wanted a hair straightener and this is it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Had to look a LOT for it and also a LOT of research was needed since girls seem not to write a lot on forums (where usually better researches are made).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She had too many to count for, more expensive and cheaper units but the Remington is just perfect. Works as advertised for every quality of hair.</li>
    <li> it is my twice time to buy it!but!!!!it broken twice!!no reason!!!!! I feel bad and sad!!!  I have never use this bad product before!!</li>
    <li> Worth it , worth it , worth it. It gets nice and hot. Straightens perfectly and leaves hair soft and shiny. I have used this flat iron on fine and coarse hair and it has never failed me yet. I LOVE THIS PRODUCT</li>
    <li> Just love it. Almost 3years that i got it.</li>
    <li> I love my remington s9500! I Usually swear by CHI products only, but this flat iron is so much like a chi, and much cheaper. It leaves me hair feeling soft, shiny, and gets the job done so fast! It also heats up really fast which I love! Wonderful straightener!</li>
    <li> Bought it as Christmas gift for my 13 year old step-daughter. She was very happy. Haven&#x27;t used it myself but it looked very modern and well made.</li>
    <li> Bought this for Christmas for my girlfriend(she picked it out). She&#x27;s tried it a few months and feels like it does more damage than her worn out old straightener and has gone back to that one.</li>
    <li> This is awesome!!! the size is perfects and is a really good product. It goes hot really fast and my hair looks awesome with it. Really good price for this awesome Iron!</li>
    <li> Heats up really fast which is nice.  The heat settings are great and it can get really hot!  I use it on its lower setting and it gets the job done. Cools down pretty quick once you&#x27;re done with as well.</li>
    <li> Heats up super quick -- maybe this is the standard now but it&#x27;s light years faster than my old one. Does the job well.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m happy with my purchases.</li>
    <li> This is my first straightener ever so I&#x27;m not sure how good it is. I have straight  hair so I use it to smooth is. It have different degrees of heat, but I use mostly either 380 or 400. I guess it does it&#x27;s job.</li>
    <li> Very disappointed and upset, I received a used product, I am sure it is used, it has scratches every where, not only that, when I turn it it switches off in a few seconds.</li>
    <li> It is a very good iron as describe , leaves a great finish and very soft hair, heats up very fast and is very comfortable and easy to use . I&#x27;m really very happy with the purchase</li>
    <li> I had a one inch flat iron that recently died on me. I have this one in a 2 inch and decided to get it in the one inch and it works just as well as the other one iIve had for about 2 years! I love Remington hair styling products because they last long, heat up quickly, easy temp settings, and straightens my hair quicker than other products. Love it and can&#x27;t wait to use my one inch for curls!</li>
    <li> Fast shipping and great quality. This product exceeded my expectations!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m loving this flatiron so far had to buy a new one since I am now natural hair and my old iron only heated to 330degreas and would not get my hair straight enough. My hair gets straight as a bone with this iron.</li>
    <li> Love this straightener!  Works like a charm!  The one and only con I can identify is that the handle tends to heat up after using the straightener for a while.  Overall, awesome and a great price!</li>
    <li> I had a Sedu for years.  It died, and I needed a new flat iron that worked really well, but didn&#x27;t cost and arm and a leg.  I have to say, I was skeptical of this one.  It was less than $30 and I have had bad experiences with flat irons before.  But, I didn&#x27;t have $150 to buy another Sedu.  So I got this one.  I am very happy with it.  While it doesn&#x27;t slide through my hair as smoothly as the Sedu did, it&#x27;s very close.  I would highly recommend this flat iron.</li>
    <li> Good afternoon, I think a lack of seriousness that I have sent an iron in poor condition, since on but temperature remains at 380 as the temperature increase button does not work, pay for something in good condition and you cheated me, I demand I resolved, more honest and serious.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. I bought it twice.&lt;br /&gt;My sister tried my wife&#x27;s, and she asked me to buy her the same model.</li>
    <li> Leaves hair nice and smooth.</li>
    <li> I typically get a product and am often disappointed so now I buy products with low expectations.  I saw several \\&quot;features\\&quot; that I really liked.     First thing was that it had a digital display and reached a salon high heat of 450.  I knew that I wouldn&#x27;t use the 450, but because of my thick hair .. I liked that it was available.  Also loved that it had a 15 second heat up and a swivel cord.     I pulled the iron out of the box and plugged it in.  I set the temp at 400 and began sectioning off my hair.  With my old iron, I would do this and when I was finished sectioning my hair I&#x27;d often times still have to wait for the iron to reach it&#x27;s desired heat.  However, I hadn&#x27;t even sectioned off one piece and the iron was already at the temperature I had set. Now I know I can section off before I even power on the flat iron.  I sprayed my hair with a heat protector and took a deep breath. I took a pass at a small section of hair expecting the worst, but hoping for the best.  Imagine my delight when it not only took my wavy hair to straight, but it didn&#x27;t pull my hair.  I quickly worked it through my hair and discovered I had finished in less than 15 minutes (and most of that was sectioning my hair!). I highly recommend this product.  I would have given it a 5 star rating, but ... I wasn&#x27;t fond of the \\&quot;lock.\\&quot;  My former flat iron had a better lock than this one, but ... it didn&#x27;t fix my hair nearly as nice!</li>
    <li> Great straightener for the price! Heats up quickly and leaves hair shiny and soft. The reason I gave it a 4 is it doesn&#x27;t clamp completely so it has to be squeezed a little harder than normal, but other than  that it works great!</li>
    <li> After a month of use the one plate just stopped heating. Too bad for such a product that has gained so good reviews.</li>
    <li> such a nice quality straightener for only 20$! seriously very comparable to them fancy CHI and babyliss straighteners. I was going to by a babyliss cause of how smooth is makes you hair but with such good reviews i decided to try this for less then half the price, amazing! my hair isnt frizzy and it stays straightened for days!</li>
    <li> I am very happy with my order. I want another one for traveling!!!</li>
    <li> I have previously owned several of these straighteners, and am now purchasing it once again. I previously used this as my primary straightener and found that in less than a year they would stop working. Two of them were replaced by the company under warranty due to problems that they discovered were manufacturer error. I now have a new straightener that i use regularly and am purchasing this one to have as a back up as well as using it to curl my hair! This straightener is perfect for creating soft curls that hold and look great! I have moderately wavy, very thick, color treated hair and this straightener leaves my hair looking smooth and shiny when i use it with proper heat care products! I would recommend it for either straightening or curling your hair, but make sure you register it if you can in cause something happens!</li>
    <li> Needed something that works well for a good price. I&#x27;m very happy with purchase.</li>
    <li> I shop Amazon by reading the negative reviews...so this won&#x27;t help if you are like me....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read that it snagged the hair:  It&#x27;s true, but that&#x27;s down to technique.  Once you learn how to use it (comb the hair first) your hair glides through like a breeze - no snags!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read that it stinks:  It&#x27;s true, for the first few minutes after first heat up - just burning off factory/assembly oils, nothing out of the ordinary for any QUALITY heating appliance!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read that the plates are too far apart: It&#x27;s true. sort of.  The issue is at the tip of the wand, and when you get to the ends of your hair... again a little practice and you learn to use it so that isn&#x27;t a concern. If your hair isn&#x27;t getting heat then you are doing it wrong. Search youtube for flat-iron and watch some tutorials!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s always a learning curve with new irons.  This is my first flat-iron under 2\\&quot;, and I bought it to curl - man!  It&#x27;s way better than a round iron on my medium length hair. I can&#x27;t believe I didn&#x27;t have one before now!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried it with (and without) flat-iron styling spray (I bought a RUSK flat iron product)...ladies in the flat-iron youtube videos obviously use flat-iron protection products, as it was an entirely different curl experience to use a product and to not use one.  Although not using flat.iron products is okay too, if you use anti-frizz products after. Without the products is a softer curl.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It heats up crazy fast!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very happy with it. It&#x27;s a very good iron!  After reading all the negative reviews, I am pleasantly surprised with what a great deal I got on this product, and I&#x27;m happy to leave a glowing positive review!</li>
    <li> I Love the fact that it is small, heats up quickly, and also that its digital, and easy to maintain</li>
    <li> awesome straightener.. love the digital indicator. straightens my fro and doesnt snag! my curls fall back in place after a wash.. couldn&#x27;t be happier! would recommend for all hair types</li>
    <li> I got my straightener one week early which was great very fast delivery!&lt;br /&gt;I really liked the straightener so far. The straightener has a very sleek design, 15 second heat up, heat settings, swivel cord, ceramic plates, auto shut off after 60 mins.&lt;br /&gt;Overall it is a great straightener, straightens hair easily and can be used to curl hair, Does my fringe well.</li>
    <li> I bought mine from Walmart, but I bought it to use as a curler.. And even tho I straightened my hair this morning, when I went to curl it... It worked! I love it! Doesn&#x27;t pull my hair. Great product</li>
    <li> I love this straightener. My old one was chewed up by a dog that I was babysitting. I didn&#x27;t even consider a different. I immediately reordered this. It heats up nicely and gets my hair smooth and silky.</li>
    <li> The lock mechanism was broken other than that it was fine</li>
    <li> Arrived timely and as expected.</li>
    <li> I thought it&#x27;d be nipping and snagging at my hair, but the settings are controllable for heat and overall was smooth. No snags or anything!</li>
    <li> My wife has a collection of straighteners and when I saw this one I thought it would make a great replacement for her favorite one that recently started dying on her. She used it and let me know what she thought. The two-inch plates from thicker models are faster. Plus, the addition of a comb on the edges would have been a big plus. It doesn&#x27;t have an ionic button to reduce static either. The temperature display was a very nice feature. For shorter hair, this would be a good model. Someone with longer hair and in a hurry would not find this the model to use. It&#x27;s a good starter model, but you&#x27;ll probably want to invest in something bigger with a comb attachment to one of the plates.</li>
    <li> I got this straightener a few days ago and it works beautifully. It is honest to the description and the picture. I payed 3 times this amount for another straightener that didn&#x27;t care about what heat I would set it on, it would always be as hot as possible and ended up frying my hair and snagging it with every other stroke. This one though, it allows me to set in on a low setting, allows my hair to be cool to touch directly after it swipes over it, makes my hair go the way I want it to go the first time, holds my style longer, and is so simple to use. I definitely recommend this to every one :)</li>
    <li> Does a good job but my hair ends up with a not so nice smell even without using any product</li>
    <li> it takes seconds to heat. it is smooth when straightening. it makes my hair look like i came from the salon</li>
    <li> I got this straightener as a gift for Christmas. I loved it. I have medium thick slighly wavy hair. It was sleek and lightweight, heated up quickly and got the job done quickly.    I went to use it on Easter and I noticed that on of the plates was not heating up. I let it sit for about an hour thinking maybe there was a short in and maybe if I let it sit it would eventually kick back on, but it didn&#x27;t. I had a Wet to Straight straighter that I had been using since 2002 before I reiceved this one and I have to say that it&#x27;s pretty dissapointing that a cheaper straightener that worked for almost 10 years, and still does actually, worked longer than that one. Of course, Target will not switch them out because it&#x27;s been over 90 days, so now I am stuck getting a new one.  I will be contacting Remington for reimbursement because that&#x27;s ridiculous.</li>
    <li> Works well, I have one and my daughter was always borrowing mine, so I got her her own. Would recommend to anyone who wants a straightener but doesn&#x27;t want to pay the high prices for some of those other professional type straighteners, works just as well.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughter for Christmas to replace her old straightener.  She has long, naturally wavy hair, not thick.  She loves her new straightener.  Said it heats up extremely quickly and works great.</li>
    <li> The flat iron initially straightened my hair, and left it shiny, but after an hour it was all frizzy and puffy again. It also pulled strains of my hair out while flat ironing it. I didn&#x27;t care for this one at all.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned this straightener for about 3-4 weeks and these are my observations thus far:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Heats up quickly (60 seconds)&lt;br /&gt;Digital readout&lt;br /&gt;Swivel cord&lt;br /&gt;Pearl Ceramic Plates&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t fizz my hair&lt;br /&gt;Hair stays smooth all day long even when sweating&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;I like my temperature set on 360 degrees. Every time I turn it on, it reverts back to 380 degrees. Too bad it doesn&#x27;t stay at the temperature you last used.&lt;br /&gt;Plates don&#x27;t come together enough. There is a space at the inner edge that allows the hair to fall through unless you physically hold it tight.&lt;br /&gt;Digital readout is hard to read (not bright enough).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as longevity goes, I can&#x27;t vouch for this yet since I haven&#x27;t had it long enough. I hope it lasts longer than some of the other reviewers.</li>
    <li> so i got this straightner because my friend straightened my hair with it for fun, and i fell in love with it because my hair was PIN straight. I have asian hair, but not the typical kind. My hair is very voluminous and thick. I had a CHI thinking that 80$ would be a good price for an \\&quot;amazing\\&quot; fat iron. WRONGGGGG, after getting the Remington Pearl 1 inch. I also had a KQC which is rated the best flat iron on the market. It only goes upto 410 degrees and in my opinion, its only good for curling. Don&#x27;t waste 50 and above dollars for a flat iron just for the name. The Remington digital ceramic hair straighter with pearl infused plates is my best bang for a buck. It heats up in 10 to 15 seconds (450 degrees!), and thats perfect for me before school. All in all, amazing, and it makes ur hair super soft and so straight! GET IT!</li>
    <li> I love it AND I hate it! I have been using this straightener for awhile now, and I really do like it -- when it works properly. I straighten my almost-shoulder-length hair about 4-5x each week, and I&#x27;ve always followed the instructions correctly. However, in the past two years or so, I have probably gone through at least 5-6 of this same model.  It starts out great, but then after awhile it just stops working.  Most of them have just stopped turning on anymore when I plugged them in. With the latest one this morning, the temperature display was on, but it wasn&#x27;t heating up at all. I always get these at Walmart, so I took it back AGAIN and swapped it out for another one.  I had gotten it in July 2011 and the one before that was at the end of April 2011.  I know they have a 4-year warranty, but I&#x27;m not going to waste my time and money sending it back to the company when I can just go get another one locally.  Still, it&#x27;s very frustrating that this product doesn&#x27;t seem to be all that reliable if I can&#x27;t find one that lasts even ONE year. But until I find something else I might like, I&#x27;ll just keep trying with this one.</li>
    <li> I was really skeptical about buying this iron because I&#x27;m a bit of a snob when it comes to flat irons. I broke my Paul mitchell and didn&#x27;t want to spend the money on a new one so I took a chance and purchased this one. I&#x27;m pleasantly surprised, it heats up quickly and does the job. I do have to go more slowly than with a Paul Mitchell but it&#x27;s really not a big deal seeing it probably takes 15 minutes versus 10. I would definitely recommend if you want a good quality iron but don&#x27;t want to spend $100+ on it.</li>
    <li> It worked two times and then the power button wouldn&#x27;t work. I&#x27;m not sure if it was a defect or what the case was, but I ended up returning it.</li>
    <li> Cord could be longer. But heats up quickly and works well.</li>
    <li> Love it works great, heats up fast and curls :)</li>
    <li> Loved it. My hair is very thick and so uncooperative. But this product works wonder for my hair.</li>
    <li> Excellent product that works better than more costly ones I&#x27;ve tried. Super features including temperature adjustment and locking shaft. GREAT value</li>
    <li> This is the second one of these straighteners I have bought. The first one lasted about 2 years, and worked great! I use this 2-3 times a week. I like the small ceramics because they are easier to do a slight curl, or wave. It is comparable if not better than other more expensive straighteners I have used.</li>
    <li> I bought this iron specifically to curl my hair with, since I don&#x27;t like curling irons, and my other flat iron is too wide to curl with. It does a very good job as a curler, creating nice loose curls was very easy, compared to how I had to struggle with my old iron to curl my hair. I haven&#x27;t actually used it to straighten my hair that often so I can&#x27;t say how well it straightens.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product and it caught my attention that it was extremely hot even when the temperature was low... The thing is I got this for 2 days, and specifically the second day it MELTED from the inside, it almost burned my hands. So don&#x27;t buy this DONT just DONT</li>
    <li> I bought this as a spare since my favorite one S6500 (Sleek and Curl) which I bought in Europe is discontinued so this is the next best thing.  It&#x27;s almost identical, the plates don&#x27;t clamp which results in less snagging and pulling. Also plates are nice and long, its very lightweight and the price is excellent.  Better than other overpriced brands.  Only con is the item received was in a box, like a factory (not the packaging you buy at the store), and it was in a sealed bag.  Weird, wondering if this a refurbished item or what but the packaging is not the expected.  Oh well, still very good product!</li>
    <li> This is solid. The pull is smooth, no snagging, no catching of singular hairs. The variable heat settings allow you to start cooler, see what your hair can handle and needs. My hair is very light and darkens with too much heat, so I have to be careful. I use this at 340 - 360, and it works great without darkening the hair. I don&#x27;t need to use product to have it work and stay straight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As to the comments about the handle being too short, where the draw-back is that you can&#x27;t get enough leverage to clamp down hard enough. I&#x27;d say, at the higher heats, without a doubt, you cannot put your fingers over the plate area and do lose the ability to clamp down super tight with one hand as you pull. However, I&#x27;m not sure you need to do this as much as you _feel_ like you need to do this. I&#x27;d say it works fine without having to have your fingers directly over the plates to clamp tight. Also, if you feel you need to do this, at the tip of the straightening iron are flat spots to put your fingers to clamp tight with your second hand. So, you can put your hair in the iron, put your fingers safely in the spots at the tip of the iron -- it is made for this -- and clamp super tight as you pull. (Again, I don&#x27;t really think you need this, but I get the want to do it, especially on the stubborn hairs.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As to any of the short, terse reviews saying this thing is garbage or snags or whatever -- my experience with this product shows none of that is true. This is a superior product, especially for the price.</li>
    <li> Bought this not expecting too much as I have had quite few straightners all over $100 ..so because it was a lot less I didn&#x27;t know what to think..but I will tell u I am very impressed and so happy..its everything I wanted. Doesn&#x27;t pull hair and quick heat up straightens my hair perfectly..its just amazing!</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B003V249L0 Remington S9500 Salon Collection Digital Ceramic Hair Straightener with Pearl Infused Wide Plates, 1 Inch]] My daughter and i love this curler. It really works, you can set it to the temperature to your hair type. It steams,straightens and moisturizes your hair. Good quality, I have no complaint thus far.I recommend this product to those who want their hair to look like they came out of the salon.It gives your hair body and softness. Please try it.</li>
    <li> The Remington S9500 absolutely justified itself. This is by far the best hair straightener I&#x27;ve used. Recommended to every woman.</li>
    <li> Works great according to my granddaughter.</li>
    <li> Has been great so far for my thick hair</li>
    <li> great item. love the auto off.</li>
    <li> Honestly the best straightener I have EVER used on my hair... not only does it straighten AMAZINGLY but it actually leaves my hair feeling silky/soft. My friends always want to use it when they come over! If anything ever happens to it I will be right back here to buy another! I&#x27;ve had it for over a year now and it&#x27;s working like brand new.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve bought this for my girlfriend recently. On a next day after she started using it did not start to work. It shows the temperature but does not heat up and turns off. I&#x27;m very disappointed</li>
    <li> I bought this Remington flat iron recently and I absolutely love it! It works great for not only straightening, but also curling your hair (flip it 180 degrees while pulling down, and curls appear!). My hair doesn&#x27;t hold a style long because it&#x27;s very fine, but with this, it held the curl for HOURS afterward. So glad I bought it. Now I can go curly or sleek by just using one product.</li>
    <li> I received this item through the Amazon Vine program and gave it to my wife to test out.  She has curly hair and does anything she can to straighten it.  Coming directly from her:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This straightener does exactly what it says it should do, it straightens hair.  The plates heat up quickly and easily and the swivel cord make its very convenient without getting tangled.  The one hour safety function gives ppeace of mind when rushing in the morning, so there&#x27;s no concern with leaving it on all day.</li>
    <li> best straightener I have ever own.</li>
    <li> El producto es excelente, de muy buena calidad, Entregado en perfectas condiciones. Envio rapido y oportuno.  Recomenendado 100 % .</li>
    <li> I love these flat irons. I bought my first in a store and then ordered another when it wore out. It heats up almost instantly, and I like the fact that you can adjust the temperature, important when you have fine hair. The high-temp settings are too high for me. The only negative is that it didn&#x27;t last as long as I&#x27;d hoped—less than two years—but that may be standard for flat irons.</li>
    <li> This straightener/styler is the best.  I bought the GHD professional styler, CHI, and Remington.    Surprisingly, Remington performs better than all the rest.  I was very disappointed with the GHD straightener because there was no temperature control settings and i felt it burnt my hair.  After using GHD, my hair looked dull and dried out and it constantly burnt my fingers as the tool gets extremely hot.      Chi was nothing special for the price.  There is no universal voltage so that means I cannot travel with it.  It also does not have temperature settings.    Remington is the way to go.  It left my hair shiny and healthy looking.  I was able to create curls WITHOUT burning my fingers. It comes with a 4 year warranty, and it has universal voltage.  It&#x27;s also significantly cheaper ($30) compared to GHD ($150 from amazon) and CHI ($70 from Marshalls).    I&#x27;m returning GHD and Chi tomorrow!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good straightener but it takes forever for me to straighten my hair. but it&#x27;s long. I curled my hair with it and it looked really pretty. It                 straightens and curls really well. I like it im keeping it. God bless everyone :D</li>
    <li> I like the brand but didn&#x27;t like this one don&#x27;t feel comfortable when you hold it hard to hold it and feel the heat, also when I use it I use it for once can&#x27;t use it again cuz it&#x27;s burned cuz the electricity in my country does it fit it :(</li>
    <li> This straightener is utterly useless. It looks great, but the plates when attempting to straighten hair do leave a significant gap between them in the closed position. This gap is way too large to effectively straighten hair, as you need to straighten in relatively small sections to achieve desired results. Never mind straightening shorter, thinner areas like bangs - impossible. All the \\&quot;pearls and whistles\\&quot; do not change the fact that this thing cannot be used as intended. Wish we could receive our $ back - total waste!</li>
    <li> I use this constantly, I have very thick wavy hair and LONG hair too! It takes me about 15 minutes to straighten my hair perfectly, but for me, that is AWESOME! I love it and it works great and heats fast too! I highly suggest it, coming from someone who has trouble finding a straightener to work for my very thick hair! This is perfect! I&#x27;ve had it for months now too and haven&#x27;t noticed a single problem!</li>
    <li> It heats up in 15 seconds-great for that one little cow-lick you noticed on your way out. It&#x27;s light-weight and easy to use. However, it does create static electricity in my hair. Due to this reason alone, I find I could not recommended this product to anyone. Unless, this is a common issue with all new straighteners.. Is anyone aware of a beauty trick to help with this problem?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is not too hot to hold, if you don&#x27;t hold it where the plates are.. Granted, over time it does warm up, WARM up, but it does not give you 3rd degree burns!</li>
    <li> Gets up to 450 degrees in 30 seconds. Straightens my hair in half the time of my $200 straightener. Hair seems healthier with less dryness and breakage when using this product.</li>
    <li> Great straightening iron and inexpensive. Leaves hair silky smooth</li>
    <li> Great flat iron for straightening naturally textured hair.</li>
    <li> II love love love my flatirons there the best..they heat up in like 30seconds my hair gets straight the first time i go over it..turns my wet hair dry i love them the best..</li>
    <li> I live by all of Remington Pearl products!! I am biracial and have naturally curly hair. This straightner works better on my hair than a Chi.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t really straighten my hair very often anymore so I didn&#x27;t want to spend very much on a flat iron, but I am also picky and didn&#x27;t want one that would pull my hair or not heat up very quickly.  This flat iron is amazing and is worth every penny!!  For the quality of this iron you could not ask for a better deal.  I would definitely recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> I have owned the 2&amp;#34; version of this flat iron for years, and I LOVE it. I&#x27;ve had a couple other flat irons before it, but this was by far the best. So when it came time to purchase a 1&amp;#34; for my new, shorter haircut, I looked no further than Remington. Decided on the S9500 because I love how my 2&amp;#34; iron has never, ever pulled on any of my hairs, and it&#x27;s always done exactly what I wanted with my hair. Couldn&#x27;t ask for more in a flat iron!</li>
    <li> It is a really nice straightener. It&#x27;s small but it does do the job. It leaves hair sleek and un frizzy.</li>
    <li> i got this product couple days ago and absolutely love it! wow awesome... i can do whatever i wanna do for my hair and also affordable price,</li>
    <li> My Remington T-studio finally gave out on me, so I went looking for a new one. The CHI products were too expensive for me. Revlon didn&#x27;t straighten my hair well even though I increased the heat to higher than Remington products and spent twice as long. But the cheaper S5500 Remington felt like sandpaper scraping against my hair, and the Remington S8590 snagged my hair at the top of the floating plates. The Remington Silk Ceramic was ok, except the buttons were on the grip and not inset, so I couldn&#x27;t avoid hitting those buttons and increasing or decreasing the temperature by accident when I squeezed the handle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This one is just right! The only two things I would say need improvement are 1) that the display should state the temperature, instead of flashing the target temperature. That way you know if you are close to the final temp. 2) Remington hair products, unlike other brands, do not support 240V which is useful when traveling to other countries.</li>
    <li> I purchased 3 of these straighteners as mine &amp; my daughter&#x27;s current straighteners were starting to smell, and a friend wanted to purchase her first straightener. Most ceramic straighteners pull and/or tug the hair as you straighten it. The pearl on the plates helps alleviate this issue.</li>
    <li> today was the first time I use this product and must say that I was very impressed(and I&#x27;m not easily impress) so you can imagine I only needed to slide/glide my coarse hair only once and was finished in record time...after using it, cleaning was a breeze with a paper towel ...this is the first time I&#x27;ve been so excited about a ceramic straghtener...go figure</li>
    <li> This straightener heats up lightening quick and works wonderfully. I would definitely buy another. It is also pretty lightweight and durable.</li>
    <li> This flat iron works great with my thick extra curly hair. It takes me about 10 min to straighten my hair before work.</li>
    <li> I love the fast heating up and automatic shut off. Works great cause you can adjust the temperature as needed. Small enough for travel.</li>

    <li> Amazing product works wonders to my super Curly hair!</li>
    <li> i RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT TO ALL HAIR DRESSES THIS WORKS SO GREAT I CANT EVEN EXPLAIN. just BEST. no PROBLEMS.</li>
    <li> My girlfriend loved it. Great product loved the settings.</li>
    <li> This is the greatest product on earth. Super cute and super sleek and reaches high temperatures really fast and I love the blue digital display. Great buy.</li>
    <li> This is a great straightener and so easy to use to do curls.  I think it is because the plates are a little further apart and why the hair does not catch or snag.  I have had $100 plus straighteners I could not curl my hair with...this is so easy to use for curling and does not pull or catch my hair while rotating it to make the curls.  The pearl technology is awesome, too.  My curls hold very well.  Also, does not pull or snag my hair while straightening, and I can do one pass and get pin straight hair.  Well worth the money and a quality product.  Also has a lock so while using it, the temperature won&#x27;t jump around and it won&#x27;t shut off while it is being used.</li>
    <li> I have been in need of a new hair straightener and well this was a great one for the price I paid...It literally heats up in 5 seconds which is great, the irons are a great size for getting to all the hair because I have very thick hair...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will say the only thing I can say that is bad about it is that it does get so hot that you have to hold it closer to the end...</li>
    <li> Good bargain! Works well and gets nice and hot quickly. I recommend.</li>
    <li> Best straightener I&#x27;ve ever bought.  I love this product.  It heats up super fast, and if you forget to shut it off it will power down after some time.  Highly recommend, but I do have to say I have naturally straight hair.  I&#x27;ve used it on my sister who has naturally wavy, thick hair, and it made her hair super smooth and straight!</li>
    <li> I have owned a lot of straighteners but this one is by far the best.  Not only that, but I got a limited edition one with black pearl and flowers on it and it is the cutest thing in my bathroom.  Can&#x27;t express how happy I am</li>
    <li> I have purchased this straightener twice in the past 3 years and it has broken on me both times. It lasts about 1-1.5 years and then poops out on me. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
    <li> I love it!! Works great for curls!</li>
    <li> I had purchased this straightener and the Remington S9600 Silk Ceramic Flat Iron, 1 Inch to compare which would be better, and let me tell you, this S9500 Peral Ceramic knocks the S9600 out of the park! I absolutely love it! It glides through my nappy curls so smoothly! I only had to run it through each section about twice for it to be completely straight! And it leaves my hair super smooth!&lt;br /&gt;The Remington S9600 Silk Ceramic Flat Iron, 1 Inch is okay. It didn&#x27;t glide through my hair or make my hair smooth like the Peral did and it also took forever to straighten one section of my hair, which is ultimately what led me to keep the Peral and return the Remington S9600 Silk Ceramic Flat Iron, 1 Inch.</li>
    <li> I was not sure about buying this at first but now that I&#x27;ve used it I&#x27;m a very happy camper. :) Great flat iron, heats up fast and straights well. Very smooth and love how its curved so I can curl  it a little. :) Great product. Great price. Buy this item.</li>
    <li> I got this to be able to do keratin treatment at home since this goes up to the required 450 F. It does the job fine and I use it every other day to straighten my hair. My hair feels smooth after using it. Don&#x27;t waste your money on highly priced over hyped alternatives as this one is all you need for a professional style. The digital screen is cute and the temperature lock is handy as it prevents temperature change by accidental press of a button. Way to go Remington, thumbs up!</li>
    <li> Excellent price for a very good product. I dont need to go to the hair store because now i have this.</li>
    <li> Heats up quickly and is easy to use.  Does a great job straightening my bangs.  I use it every morning.  The edges can get very hot and i have to be careful not to burn my forehead.</li>
    <li> I bought this straightener and it worked wonderfully, but only for a few months.  I straighten my hair about once a week.  One day I went to plug it in and it wouldn&#x27;t turn on or heat up.  I tried other outlets and it was broken.  Do not waste your money!!!</li>
    <li> I ordered this flat iron to take with me to Europe because it was dual voltage.  I placed my order on Friday, November 15, and paid extra for one day shipping because I was going to be leaving for my trip on Tuesday, November 19, in the evening.  Unfortunately it was not delivered until two days after I left on the 21st.  Meanwhile I had to purchase another one at my first stop in San Diego.  They did refund what I paid for one day shipping but obviously it did me no good as I wasn&#x27;t able to take it with me.  I realize I did order it somewhat last minute but that was mostly because I had to research the voltage in Europe and finally found out that dual voltage would work instead of having to buy a transformer.  I was just disappointed because I have ordered from Amazon a lot over the last couple years and I don&#x27;t remember a time when my package didn&#x27;t show up as scheduled.  Bummer that this happened when I was actually needing it to be on time.  However, I did not end up sending it back.  I ended up giving it to my cousin for Christmas so I guess that&#x27;s a positive in the situation.  So there is still a chance I can change my review if it turns out to actually be a good product.  I will wait to hear back from my cousin:)</li>
    <li> I got this last year , worked awesome. Get&#x27;s really hot. Max heat is 450! I have had it for a year and like 2 monthes. As of last week it hardly works. I&#x27;m not saying not it doesn&#x27;t work i&#x27;m say that it didnt last long. I dont know, maybe cuz i always used 450.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my wife and she is in love with it, she says it&#x27;s the fastest hair straightener ever, she already bought one for each of her sisters.</li>
    <li> I use my flat iron to curl my hair about as often as I do so straighten it. This flat iron only makes large, loose curls instead of springier ones that my old Remmington flat iron produced. Getting the curl even is difficult too. I think it is because of the curved shape. It&#x27;s a good iron, heats up well, but I wish I had saved the packaging so I could return it as it really doesn&#x27;t suit my needs.</li>
    <li> This straightener did not get very hot, and it burnt out after less than a year of use. I would not recommend it. I typically have better luck with other reasonably priced brands like con-air and Tigi.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping can&#x27;t wait to have my sister in law try it out delivery was great was placed where no one could see the package since I wasn&#x27;t home</li>
    <li> Bought this after a more expensive Hot Tools one broke after a few years.  I&#x27;ve had this for over 1.5 years now and it&#x27;s fantastic - I love it.  It has rounded edges so I can curl my hair with it as easily as straightening it.  I am not used to very high end straighteners so I can&#x27;t compare, but it does a very fine job for the price point and hasn&#x27;t chipped or had any issues in almost 2 years so I&#x27;ve gotten my money&#x27;s worth already in my mind.  I also really love the auto shut-off feature, just in case I forget.  The only comment I would make is that I am left-handed and I have to hold it in just the right way so that I don&#x27;t get pinched by the end piece when closing the iron and so not to accidentally increase or decrease the heat.</li>
    <li> I bought this product because it says that it has worldwide voltage, even in the product information in the Remignton website. But the product itself only says 120V, what seems to be the problem that you advertise something when it is not true?</li>
    <li> Despite the great product reviews, I had moderate expectations for this flat iron. After literally years of faithful service, my CHI brand flat iron bit the dust so I decided to start with an inexpensive replacement but I told myself that I would return it and replace the original CHI if I didn&#x27;t love it. Well, I love my new Remington flat iron! Despite my skepticism, the Remington performs just as well as my CHI, which is no easy task - I have long (past my chest), thick hair with a lot of natural wave. I can get a smooth result in a single pass, and the high heat settings keep frizz at bay until my next shampoo (usually a day or two). The digital temperature display allows you to control the heat and keep damage to a minimum. Another bonus is that this flat iron heats up and cools down quickly. Overall, I am more than impressed with my new Remington and would definitely recommend this as a first-choice alternative to the more expensive brands.</li>
    <li> I have Asian hair if you will. I barely need straightening, and when I do, I just lightly use these flat irons. This thing is great, no doubt about it. The adjustable temperature is great even though it is a standard in most flat irons these days. For the price though, it&#x27;s a steal. However, the two plates are not too wide apart, hence sometimes you have to put your hair between them instead of the opposite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also broke down on me after 6 months. Again, it is to be noted that I am just a light user.</li>
    <li> pretty cheap, does the job, has different heat settings...&lt;br /&gt;not too shabby.&lt;br /&gt;I have had better results with more expensive straighteners, but&lt;br /&gt;for every day straightening this is just fine.</li>
    <li> What does love mean in relation to a hair straightener, anyway?  I really like this, but love seems a stretch, dear Amazon.  This hair straightener is the best I have ever owned, because it heats up fast, glides through my hair and leaves the surface of the hair smooth and neat.  What more could I ask?</li>
    <li> this version is good quality and price, also how easy it is to buy anything on amazon page, the only thing wrong is the tax have to pay when it enters the country but otherwise excellent.</li>
    <li> Chose this for size and value for money! Delivers on every account. Do not hesitate. Light weight and does a great job.</li>
    <li> Its absolutely wonderfull. It works beyond my expectation.  Price is really good. Strongly recommended to everyone who is looking for safe fast and good straightner</li>
    <li> I have very curly hair and this straightener sorted it out very quickly. I not only use it on high heat for getting very straight hair, but sometimes use it on low heat just to get softer more manageable hair. definitely recommend buying.</li>
    <li> I ordered this for my sister as a gift and I used it on her hair for the first time and I love it! If I didn&#x27;t already have a straightener, or when mine wears out I will definitely be getting this one! It heats up fast and does a great job straightening and getting rid of frizz. I haven&#x27;t heard a complaint about it since I gave it to her!</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s really good and excellent for the soft and hard hear to be used, also it is reliable and long life.</li>
    <li> Gave to someone for a Christmas present and it has stopped working already.  Less than 5 months.  It turns on and within in seconds it shuts off.  Even if she is using it will shut off.  Do not have warranty info but it supposedly it is warranted for 4 years.  Already bought a new one.</li>
    <li> This rating should be for Amazon, not actually for the product, because the lack of information in the product description, but it is more useful posted here.&lt;br /&gt;Product arrived yesterday, and although it is marketed and most of the users said it is worldwide voltage, I was very disappointed to discover is only 110V.&lt;br /&gt;Now it will probably end in the trash, as for a good step down transformer I should pay more then I paid for the product, and retuning is not an option right now.</li>
    <li> got it as a gift for someone and they really liked it! Looked up the best straightners before i bought it, this one was in good company, with many that were hundreds of dollars rated about the same as this one!</li>
    <li> I liked how the straightener looks. Its cute, slim, easy to hold and has a swivel cord.&lt;br /&gt;However, I can&#x27;t say anything about how good it is on the working part, because I cannot use it.&lt;br /&gt;Why..you ask me?&lt;br /&gt;Its because the one I received is a 120v straightener. Which means..its only good to you IF you live in US.&lt;br /&gt;So, residents of other countries can&#x27;t really use it.&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this to people outside US, unless you live in hotels which have a 120v.&lt;br /&gt;Because...US works on a 120v system rest of the world is like 220v or 240v.&lt;br /&gt;I really wanted a good affordable straightener from this brand.&lt;br /&gt;This broke my heart. Although amazon were understanding enough and resolved my issue, I still really wanted a straightener which works. :(</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s really good,  I recommend it to everyone</li>
    <li> Heats quickly. Lightweight</li>
    <li> I Ordered this on 17th Aug 2012 under Order #  103-9263819-0351402. This Item I have used for almost 7 to 8 times till now and while using it today, all of a sudden one of the plate stopped functioning (was not heating up) and I could not complete the task of straightening the Hair. Actually, one of the Plate color was started to turn into white from the 2nd use itself but was working fine. Now the same plate is not functioning and not heating up and only the other plate heats up which is of no use. It Has 4 Years of Warranty valid until 16th Aug 2016.&lt;br /&gt;I want to return this shipment for warranty claim.&lt;br /&gt;Kindly suggest me the procedure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Many Thanks.</li>
    <li> I really love this iron curling. It makes my hair look more healthy  shiny and a clearly wave all day long.  I love Remington..also shipping on time too.</li>
    <li> I never had a bad experience with the Remington products..I got a curling iron that has work good for 2 years but got this flat iron and on the second use it didn&#x27;t work anymore. It turned off after 10 seconds every time I tried to turn it on it kept turning off every 10 seconds.</li>
    <li> One of the best straighteners that I ever used.... especially for the price!</li>
    <li> I bought this a year ago. I love how fast it heats up, and it does its job soooo well!</li>
    <li> This is an excellent straightener, gets the job done. It really straightness my hair (long hair, half straight) after that, I apply a small amount of oil on it to give it shine and it&#x27;s good to go!. Although I would not recommend it for curly or super curly hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has last me trough some thought Floridian weather.</li>
    <li> Like many other consumers who purchased this, this also stopped working for me. I used it maybe twice before it simply wouldn&#x27;t stay on anymore. I had it maybe 2 weeks, purchased it from Target and just took it back to get a different model by Conair (Infinity Pro) which I&#x27;m very happy with. Interestingly, this item is on sale -- \\&quot;price cut\\&quot; -- at Target ... Now I understand why. It was great the first couple of times I used it, but if it stops working, what good is it? Purchase at your own risk. My recommendation is that if you want to take that risk, at least purchase it somewhere close in the likely event you&#x27;ll have to return it.</li>
    <li> came in different color ... but it works so eh...</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve bought so many straightening irons and this is by far the best for the price.  In fact, I&#x27;ve bought many others that weren&#x27;t nearly as good for more money.  I have thick wavy hair.  It is unbelievable how sleek this iron makes my hair.  I read all the rave reviews yet found it difficult to believe the iron could be that good.  Well, I&#x27;m a believer!!  And boy have I gotten a lot of great compliments on my hair lately.</li>
    <li> Its really good product, has the power button I read some reviews before purchased that said doesn&#x27;t has it but it is in the side, works perfectly get hot in a couples seconds and left my hair smooth and completely straight</li>
    <li> Nice, but one side stopped heating after only a year and I was expecting the full three years of the warranty, but theyre still the only brand I&#x27;ll buy</li>
    <li> This product works extremely well for the price! My hair stays straight and sleek all day and its slides over my hair very smoothly. Super happy with this product!</li>
    <li> I love this product and plus it came with a 4yr warranty..i would recommend this to anyone&lt;br /&gt;my hair is great its soft and it doesnt pull</li>
    <li> This is so easy to use!  Warms up fast, straightens quickly and smoothly. Had one years ago and boy is this an upgrade! Love it!</li>
    <li> I have used many high end brand and this one is the best. I now own all of Remington&#x27;s line</li>
    <li> I love this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It makes my hair very smooth, it doesn&#x27;t pull my hair; which I  was looking for. I am absolutely in love with it, I use it everyday and my hair is silky smooth every use. Highly recommend for those who are looking for a low price very functional flat iron!</li>
    <li> This straightener works very well, and it arrived on time!</li>
    <li> Work PerfecT!! we Like this</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with this straightener. It is ready in seconds, and the temperatures are quite high. I have very fine hair that is easily damaged. I blow dry my hair first then I rub in an anti-friz serum before using the flat iron. I set the heat at 400 and it glides through my hair quickly, not pulling a thing. At first, I did not think I would like the narrow 1 inch design, but it works just as well and as quickly at my older 2 inch one of a different make and model. The slimmer design also makes it easy to pack in my suit case when I travel.</li>
    <li> I love this! I would recommend this to everyone. I loved my CHI straightner but I have had 2 CHI&#x27;s within 1 1/2 years and they are not cheap. My best friend had the Remington straightner and it was the larger one. I loved it. It made my dry damaged hair look shiny and feel smooth. I like this almost as much as I like my CHI for the price. I did get the thing version like my CHI.</li>
    <li> ES UN PRODUCTO SUMAMENTE LIVIANO, SE ADAPTA TOTALMENTE A LAS NECESIDADES DEL CLIENTE, ADEMAS PERMITE REALIZAR EL SECADO DE UNA MANERA RAPIDA Y SENCILLA.</li>
    <li> I paid $99 for a real Chi flat iron at a local chain store 2 years ago. I didn&#x27;t realize at the time that the fine print warranty inside the box says there is no warranty unless you purchase it \\&quot;live\\&quot; at a beauty supply store (where I&#x27;m betting you have to pay even more for it). I owned it for 2 years and used it about every other day and shelved it for the summer because I spend more time in water than on land. So as far as actual use goes, it was probably used about 250 times--less than a year. Even though I always kept the on/off switch in the \\&quot;on\\&quot; position and unplugged it to shut it off, the switch began sliding around in the casing and shutting the unit off. In addition, the heating element stopped working reliably. I was hoping if I laid out some cash when I purchased it, I might be getting a high quality product (which is what the reviews said at the time). I was expecting it to far outlast other models/brands, which were a lot less expensive. No such thing. What a piece of junk. You&#x27;re just paying for a brand name on this, and apparently, not a good one. IN COMPARISON... I just purchased a Remington Pearl Flat Iron for $30. Here&#x27;s what you get for $70 less... The same quality hairstyle. Honestly, there is no difference in performance! It takes the same amount of time and effort for me to straighten my hair and my hair has a natural wave in it, so even on difficult hair, I found NO difference between the Chi and the Remington Pearl as far as that goes. The small differences are: The Remington does not have the ALCI safety plug (but I don&#x27;t style my hair in the tub anyway, so who cares), the cord isn&#x27;t quite as long, the unit doesn&#x27;t squeeze together quite as easily as the Chi, and while the Remginton Pearl is smooth over hair the Chi slides better, but 70 dollars better? No way. And if the Remington Pearl quits on me, it&#x27;s at least covered by a REAL warranty and I&#x27;m not out a ton of money if it breaks after the warranty runs out. I&#x27;m betting if you&#x27;ve neverused a Chi before and have no basis of comparison about the feel of it in hand, you will love the Remington Pearl and what it can do.</li>
    <li> Ive got Curly hair and i mean CURLY so for me a good straightner is hard to find you really got to do your research,so ive read reviews on it and everything.So when i bought it i loved the plates a pretty pink sparkle and when i tried it, it felt amazing on my hair leaving it smooth and silky.However sometime down the line it started slowing down i want to say about 4 months after i bought it.Then the plates started losing the silky smooth effect,then the plates started scratching, the \\&quot;CERAMIC\\&quot; apparently was coming off (REAL CERAMIC PLATES DO NOT GET SCRATCH AND COME OFF)&lt;br /&gt;So at 6 months it finally stopped working it didnt turn on at all it was a slow death.But i did go and buy another one and it did exactly the same thing so i would go with a different straightner.</li>
    <li> I was shocked at how well this flat iron works.  I am African American with natural hair and this flat iron made my hair silky straight.  I once paid $150 for a flat iron and it didn&#x27;t work nearly as good as this one and it broke in 6mo : (</li>
    <li> So literally just got and used this... Its absolutely beautiful and sleek. It has blue digital numbers and makes this beautiful chime as it is done heating up. The most fancy and gorgeous hair tool ive ever owned. It came within twenty four hours in perfect condition. Straightens beautifully except i bleached my hair then  dyed it brown so now the blonde is coming through in streaks every time i run it over my hair... its okay ill just dye it again!!! GET THIS</li>
    <li> it was one of the worst. i ever had</li>
    <li> I read all the reviews for this product an I was very excited to use it. I ordered the straightener and it came in with in 6 days so I was happy about that . When it first arrive I plugged it in and it took about 45 seconds to heat up, I straightened a small amount of hair and was surprised at how well it did straightening , I then curled a piece of my little sisters hair and that curled held until the next day , she was playing out side and getting sweaty and the curl still held so that was a plus . The next day I had a wedding to go to so I used it to curl my hair . I did notice some steam but I figured it was due to the heat tamer I had sprayed on to my hair,  After the wedding I took a shower and smelled a disgusting smell . It smelt as if something was burnt to ashes . When I got out of the shower I was combing my hair and noticed that the smell was my hair ! I was sooo scared . I had my sister smell it and she said it didn&#x27;t smell right and to shower again , I did and the smell was still there . I didn&#x27;t use the straightener ever again. My hair is now fried , and completely straight . I used to have wavy hair that I actually liked. It doesn&#x27;t smell weird anymore but it took a week for the smell to go away . I was so embarrassed going around with hair that smelt so horribly</li>
    <li> Got this for my 13 yr old and she Luvs it. The Pearl finish is great n doesn&#x27;t damage the hair . She has curly frizzy hair and this one does the job well!</li>
    <li> I was skeptical  of buying this because of how inexpensive it is  but it works great and fast I recommend it to ANYONE truly one of my best hair tools and it curls great!!!</li>
    <li> It is very practical , I like it!</li>
    <li> I was really impressed at how quickly I was able to use this straightener to straighten my hair. I have lots of wavy/curly hair, and one good pass on each section just about did it. I didn&#x27;t time myself but I&#x27;m pretty sure it took me less than 15 minutes, which is a lot faster than it takes me to dry my hair using the blow dryer with diffuser. Now, I did start with dry hair, but the beauty of is is that I could let my hair dry naturally and then when I had a few extra minutes, Bam! Straight and styled!</li>
    <li> muy satisfecha, una temperatura excelente. se alisa rapido el pelo, con un buen precio muy comoda de usar la recomiendo para todo tipo de cabello. venezuela</li>
    <li> Excelent tool, It is usefull..... thank you very much. the packgage sent very good, and the specifications are the same that the description.</li>
    <li> I’ve very thick frizzy hair. Even in beauty salons, they couldn´t get my hair really straight at all. At first, when I was reading the reviews I thought perhaps it was going to be very complicated to use it at home, however, this hair straightener is really easy to use it and you don´t have to wait almost half an hour to heat up and use it, heats up in seconds. For its price and the result I get to fix my hair at home, I can say that its price is worthwhile. I give it five-star and recommend to all of us women with puffy and frizzy hair, it really works.</li>
    <li> This is my first flat iron and it heats up quickly and does what it claims.</li>
    <li> My irons are broke. I dont know how to get a refund</li>
    <li> My girlfriend got sick of how slow and not warm her straightener was so i looked online and found this one. She used it immediately and said that she never wants another straightener again. It has a selection for what temperature you want it at so if you have sensitive hair then this would work great for you. Also, the shipping and packaging were perfect from the company i ordered it through, will definitely do business with them again!</li>
    <li> Perfect for short hair.</li>
    <li> I used the same old straightener for many years, and I thought it was about time I upgraded. I use this straightener every single day and I can&#x27;t go back to my old one. It does heat up very quickly and does the job. I was hesitant to buy it since it&#x27;s from the internet and I usually like to buy things in person and see the action and quality for myself, but I don&#x27;t regret buying this. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Excelent product good quality, the shipping excelent, and the description is really like the publication, i am happy with my order and everything is excelent</li>
    <li> When I purchased this flat iron on Amazon in August 2013, it was priced at $19.99. Now it&#x27;s $44! Wow. What a difference that almost a year makes! I am glad I purchased it right when I did. I enjoy the flat iron, it transforms my coarse hair into a salon quality smooth finish. The 1-inch flat iron also helps me at my roots which is a hard area to get straight with other flat irons. One con is that it does get extremely hot on the handle part where the plates are which can be a hindrance if you want to hold your flat iron a certain way to make sure it clamps down on your hair as you move it down.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem to heat evenly. I have to turn it over and run my hair through again to get the top and bottom evenly. Seems to fry my bangs.</li>
    <li> Love it..gets hot very fast and straightens to make your hair look like silk..great purchase. ..I recommend you try it..</li>
    <li> Note: I bought this from Target, not Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So for whatever reason, I&#x27;ve had the same \\&quot;meh\\&quot; low-quality Conair flat iron for three years. Maybe I&#x27;m cheap? I dunno. But I decided to try this one out, and OMG do I love it! I&#x27;ve also tried friend&#x27;s irons, like Chi&#x27;s and the like, so I have a decent point of comparison.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- It gets hot in 15 seconds&lt;br /&gt;- It gets HOT&lt;br /&gt;- It glides like silk over rainbow tears or something&lt;br /&gt;- Does NOT snag even one strand of hair; if you&#x27;re snagging, you&#x27;re doing something wrong&lt;br /&gt;- It straightens perfectly (one caveat, my hair is an easier type so doesn&#x27;t take much)&lt;br /&gt;- It does beachy waves&lt;br /&gt;- It makes really pretty, simple, and long-lasting curls&lt;br /&gt;- The design makes it really diverse as far as styling options&lt;br /&gt;- The swivel cord is cool&lt;br /&gt;- The blue display is nice, and beeps when it&#x27;s ready&lt;br /&gt;- It&#x27;s cheap in price, but certainly not quality!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Pshhhh ... NONE!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just buy it already!</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t review the product because Amazon never tells us which continent our product will be shipped from, and so I have bought a hair straightener which is electrically incompatible to australian voltage!!!!!! Oh no!!! We have been told we can never use it in australia. A CAUTIONARY tale!!!!!</li>
    <li> Worked great for about a month then it completely died and stopped working out of no where</li>
    <li> I bought this flat iron after my last one started smelling bad. I was skeptical because of some of the reviews but I found this really worked for me. I have typical African- American hair, meaning its coarse and thick. i usually buy flat irons they don&#x27;t get hot enough, that&#x27;s definitely not a problem with this one! Be careful because if you grab the wrong part you will burn yourself. There are little indents at then end that don&#x27;t get hot where you can put your fingers if you need to press down. I don&#x27;t really have any complaints! If you keep it clean it won&#x27;t smell and if you&#x27;re careful with the temperature you won&#x27;t burn your hair off!</li>
    <li> Does not get hot enough to straighten har.</li>
    <li> nice , they are perfect!!!</li>
    <li> Broke within less than 10 uses. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this. Unfortunately, it quit working 32 days after I purchased it which is 2 days shy of when Amazon will replace it. I did not keep any of the manufacturers warranty information so it went straight into the trash. Won&#x27;t be buying anything from Amazon again as they have a horrible return policy. This product is a giant piece of crap, don&#x27;t waste your money. Those that had a good experience must have got a good one, they are lucky. I went out an bought one from the local store where I know they have a good return policy if something happens, and not from this manufacturer.</li>
    <li> My daughter LOVED this product 2&amp;#34; version until it burned out after only 2 years.  So disappointing.</li>
    <li> Works amazing I love it</li>
    <li> I have naturally wavy hair (stubborn!) and this does a good job with it.</li>
    <li> This is agreat product and it is not expensive.  Remington products have been around for years.  Since,  it was so unexpensive I was not quite sure.  This product&lt;br /&gt;works great, has several features if I had to buy another;  It would this.</li>
    <li> Excellent flat iron for human and synthetic hair.  Make frizzies smooth as silk.  Heats up fast easy to use. A must have.</li>
    <li> I bought this in 2001,october.barely used and it stopped working.it was functioning well when it was working.so disappointed and need to get different one</li>
    <li> This straightener is the best one I have ever used!! I have really curly hair and it straightens it beautifully. The straightener heats up real quick too!</li>
    <li> I have heard for some time that ceramic was better for your hair.  I have only used this once but I can feel the difference.  You hair glides through it and it seems to work so much better.  I feel more confident using this flat iron.  I didnT have any problem with it getting too hot to handle as some reviews indicated.</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS FLAT IRON!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used many in the past and trust me when I say, this is the best and most cost effective style accessory I have ever owned. It glides through my hair beautifully, no burning smell like the metal irons, and it leaves an awesome effect every time! I use it for straightening and curling and I get awesome results each time. I highly recommend!</li>
    <li> This is a very good straightener for the price, I like the digital settings, the size of the plates, and the heat settings. I  waited  several months before writing a review, to see how durable and long lasting this iron is. I have had this iron for 11 months, and it still retain the heat, as well as the ceramic is still smooth and working well. I share my straightener with two daughters we use it at least twice a week. I should mention it does get quite hot, so be careful with using  above 400 . The only complaint, would be flat ironing near the roots of my hair , it is somewhat difficult to get close to the roots. It could be me, or could be the design of the iron.</li>
    <li> This is my first flat iron so don&#x27;t have any experience with any other brands.  But it does just what I needed it too.  No frizz, doesn&#x27;t get too hot but hot enough to keep the style.  It kept its hold all day long in humidity, so I say it worked great!</li>
    <li> Love it!  Better than the expensive flat irons I have purchased in the past.  I highly recommend!</li>
    <li> will last long. I bought a same product from Reminton years ago as a gift and she still use it. And likes it.So I bought another one for a gift to another person.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if I had really back luck and got a defective product or if this is just a terrible Hair Straightener... I was really excited when I order it, I was looking for a straightener that could make the work faster and easier, and I thought this one due to the high temperature it reaches and the pearl infused plates that were supposed to help to have a hair salon like finish was going to make it. Well it didn&#x27;t happen... so far this has been the WORSE hair straightener I have ever tried... ended up with freeze hair, not straight and smelling like it burnt... plus you kind it gets really hot in the exterior I think more than what it should, I ended up looking to see if my fingerprints were still there...the reason why I didn&#x27;t send it back is because I didn&#x27;t use it until a couple of days ago and my window to return it just expired on the 22nd, but definitely I have to share this bad experience. I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS HAIR STRAIGHTENER... not a good investment.</li>
    <li> I have always used this product for my hair... It is the only thing that actually gets my hair styled the way I want it. I will contiune to buy this product as long as the item is still offered.</li>
    <li> My old Remington flat iron deiced to stop working one day, so i went online and found this nice little thing. my hair type is thin fine-med, wavy-curly hair (can become kinda frizzy)&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-light weight&lt;br /&gt;-awesome digital temp adjuster&lt;br /&gt;-able to both flat iron and curl hair(nice beachy waves, loose curls)&lt;br /&gt;-the cord rotates&lt;br /&gt;cons:&lt;br /&gt;-will get extremely hot if you get to close to the plate barrel(have burnt myself a few times)&lt;br /&gt;-has a weird smell when heating up...my hair doesn&#x27;t smell but im not sure if it&#x27;s because of the nice smelling products i use in my hair&lt;br /&gt;* I would recommend this flat iron because it does get the job done.</li>
    <li> Worked really well until the day it burnt my hair out of my head!!! Never using remmington again! My hair is fried!</li>
    <li> I love it so much with this quality price hot iron.I will suggest you to try it without thinking Thanks</li>
    <li> Just as expected, great service.</li>
    <li> I guess it&#x27;s the pearl surface that makes this straightener better than all those I&#x27;ve tried before. The Remington doesn&#x27;t overheat and fry my hair. It&#x27;s a perfect travel size. My locks love it especially in frizzy humid weather. I use it every day it&#x27;s so mild. Good for a gentle wave after straightening.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my wife.&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately she just tried it, few days after the return window expired.&lt;br /&gt;Once turned on, it emitted a bad smell, and broke in a matter of few minutes!!&lt;br /&gt;Complete waste of money.&lt;br /&gt;very frustrating.</li>
    <li> arrived in excellent condition, equal to that specified by the seller. the product is of high quality and low price important. I am very happy with this product.</li>
    <li> i got this for a friend of mine because the one she had at the moment wasnt that good. i dont really know that much about straighteners i was leaning toward the chi but this one caught my eye for some reason. anyway she loves it though.it gets hot really fast and its just what she needed.</li>
    <li> One plate of the device broke down so I could not use it</li>
    <li> This product get the job DONE!!. It heats up in the time it say..... even on the lowest temperature you hair is so straight and bouncy....great choice!!!</li>
    <li> It worths the price. After you use it, it doesn&#x27;t make you hair fizzy. It doesn&#x27;t burn your hair. Good purchase!!!</li>
    <li> Works great.  does a good job at smoothing and flattening my daughter&#x27;s hair.  Great price, too.</li>
    <li> Been using it for a while now and it works just fine. I&#x27;m not having any problems with it .</li>
    <li> Great product, was purchased as a gift.</li>
    <li> I bought this to use while traveling, and it was advertised as being able to operate on either 120 or 220 volts. It worked fine for the first month I had it while I was in the US. As soon as I got to Europe, it stopped working. Of course the return period has passed, and I tossed out the warranty card. Waste of money.</li>
    <li> This flat iron is &amp;#34;okay&amp;#34;. I bought the 1 inch rather than larger one because it said that this one is good for small detailed areas. However, i notice that my flat iron doesnt close all the way. when you press it down, the 2 ends of the flat iron are touching but the center is completely open.  But, It does work and it leaves my hair soft and shiny, which is a plus!</li>
    <li> When i decided to bought this item the main point was that ther were 110-220V&lt;br /&gt;In the picture there is clearly shown. But when i received it found out that it is 110V I was vary disappointed. I would/t buy it if I new that. ((((((</li>
    <li> This is an awesome little hair straightener. It heats up very quickly and shuts off automatically (in about 2 hrs) if I forget to turn it off.&lt;br /&gt;I really like the rotating cord feature so it doesn&#x27;t tangle the cord.</li>
    <li> The cord is too short but otherwise it&#x27;s good!</li>
    <li> Hi, I recently ordered the Remington S9500 and after using it only 3 times it started smelling weird, then turned off and will not turn back on.&lt;br /&gt;I read great reviews about this product and am very disappointed that after only 3 times of using it, it&#x27;s stopped working.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am currently studying abroad and was in search for a hair straightener that would work with an international (out of U.S) voltage. I found this hair iron and was pleased to read \\&quot;This straightener also features worldwide voltage, so there&#x27;s no need to skimp on your style routine, whether you&#x27;re at home or abroad.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;However, upon delivery I saw that it is not international voltage, it&#x27;s 120/60 and does not work abroad.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you in advance for your help and customer support.</li>
    <li> My daughter loves this straightener.  We have nothing to compare it to but it seems to work great.  Her hair came out nice and straight with no other problems.</li>
    <li> This arrived just as I had expected. It is very nice, smooth finish, heats up fast. I like it a lot.</li>
    <li> It looks sheek,  it heats up fast and does the job really well. I have thick hair too.  I recommend.</li>
    <li> The product is working correctly and I was shipped on time. I gonna keep buying with you. Thanks a lot.</li>
    <li> is an excellent Irons recommend</li>
    <li> I love this flat iron!! It gets hot enough to straighten my &amp;#34; new growth&amp;#34; !! Be careful because you can burn your hair!!</li>
    <li> I love this Flat iron. I really like that the Tempature goes up to 450 degrees, because when I&#x27;m ready to go I don&#x27;t want to wait on anything.</li>
    <li> most favourite for me!</li>
    <li> this was a gift for my sister for her birthday. I have had this product before and it works great! I use flat iron oil and it protects my hair plus the digital heat setting works great</li>
    <li> It is very easy to use. It works really well. I recommend to everyone who doesn&#x27;t know much about hair styles and want to get ready fast for work. Just iron hair and go and it stays straight for 2-3 days.</li>
    <li> Literally I&#x27;ve had this for not even a year and about two days ago out of no where it&#x27;s broke like it turns of for about 10 seconds then it shuts itself back off. It&#x27;s a terrible product I don&#x27;t recommend this</li>
    <li> I am a big fan of Remington and I am so happy i relied on them for my new straighter!</li>
    <li> I was in the market for good flat irons. I order the Remington pearl curling wand a month ago so I decided to try the flat irons for my hair extensions. I am African- American I used the flat irons on my brazilin hair and it did a great job..however when I tried it on my cheaper 10 dollar hair it didn&#x27;t do it so well .. Also I haven&#x27;t tried it on my own natural hair yet but I would say if you have thick hair or course African American hair it may not work so good on it but it IS A GREAT FLAT IRON FOR BRAZILIN HAIR EXTENSIONS ..The only thing is the damn things get too hot lol so you may need to use some kind of heat protectant glove but other than that I really like this item</li>
