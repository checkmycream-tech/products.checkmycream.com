    <li> First the smell...amazing...kind of like bananas. It is creamy and thick and glides through my hair well. I prefer it over the It&#x27;s a 10 mask, but I found I ran out of both products in equal time.&lt;br /&gt;I use in addition to K Pak Color Therapy and when I do my hair is noticeably softer. I&#x27;ll buy it over and over again.</li>
    <li> Curly girl necessity.</li>
    <li> My hairdresser uses Joico so I started using it at home. The products all work well on fine hair. A little expensive but worth it!!</li>
    <li> This is the very best stuff in the world for when you ruin your hair, it brings it back to life!</li>
    <li> I use this K Pack about once a month or so. It does make my hair a little straight for a day or so...but it makes it super soft and smooth! Then, the normal waves come back soon. It is cheap and it really works!</li>
    <li> NOT the real thing. It&#x27;s been watered down or replaced with something else. It also smelled bad, like rotten bananas.</li>
    <li> I love joico products. I have used this particular product before but this time the consistency seemed old. It was more watery than usual. I sent a message that I may want to return it but no one responded. I am going to finish using it but I will not be buying it from this vendor again. It was shipped fast though.</li>
    <li> Had a watery consistency. Not thick like it ahould have been. It didn&#x27;t produce any results with my hair either.</li>
    <li> This product is pretty good - it did a good job of rehydrating my dry, damaged Afghanistan hair. However, the smell is not great. Kinda smells like bananas - which I hate! But it does a good job.</li>
    <li> K-Pak is an amazing product!  It should be in every beauty shop in the country.  It makes hair soft and manageable even after it&#x27;s been like straw.  I would recommend this product for anyone who has hair!</li>
    <li> I have been a fan of joico  products, so this is not new to me. 😊 excellent for damaged/or to stop damage from happening. Recommended! Great service, fast..</li>
    <li> I have been very pleased with the results. Works well for dry, damaged hair. Enjoy this product line for sure.</li>
    <li> Joico products are literally the best on the market. I have used K-Pak conditioner for over 20 years. It keeps my hair shinning. My hair is  healthy with no split ends. I frequently get asked what product do I use and always say Joico. I have found that a very small amount worked into hair and rinsed out in about 2 to 3 minutes is enough to do the best job. No real reason to leave in as long as 5 to 10 minutes.</li>
    <li> My hairdresser used this product on my hair and it looked so smooth and shiny and healthy and felt so good.</li>
    <li> I like this products. And love the price.</li>
    <li> The only thing that will save your damaged hair!</li>
    <li> Does exactly what it says it will.  Repair color treated, chemically treated damaged hair.  This is not a super light product.  It is of substance, so if you have fine hair, you may want to apply sparingly.  But if you are like me, and the sun, wind, sea, swim chemicals have had their way with your hair.  Do it.</li>
    <li> Have used this product twice, seen and felt a big difference,hair feeling smoother and softer. Great price for amount of product!!</li>
    <li> This reconstructor was recommended to me by my hair dresser. I had been going to a different stylist who ended up ruining my hair. When I mean ruining, I mean my hair was breaking off!!  Anyway, I&#x27;m on a strict regime and Joico Deep reconstructor is part of it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product and the Sally&#x27;s brand knock off for years and  love it!  The product that I purchased from this particular seller seemed runnier and off in both smell and color.  It conditioned my hair well, but I had to use more product.  I paid a much lower price than I usually do and now I know the reason.  All things are even in that respect, I suppose. If you want a guaranteed fresh product, buy from an authorized dealer or get the Sally&#x27;s GVP version.</li>
    <li> Joico-K-Pak deeply conditions your hair and in the process, it reconstruct and leaves your hair feeling stronger and with a shine.</li>
    <li> Great for dry damaged hair.  I use it a few times a week and it leaves my hair soft.  Definitely makes a huge difference in my hair.  My hair is starting to get wavy and a bit frizzy but this conditioner really calms down my waves and my frizz.  Hair looks much more healthy.</li>
    <li> This reconstructor conditioner is awesome!</li>
