      <li>great product, i am a returning customer of this item.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a great hair wax</li>
      <li>The smell of the beeswax is great imo.  </li>
      <li>size has lasted me a couple months of using it every day, so it&#x27;s a great value too.</li>
      <li>In the hair it works great.</li>
      <li>Just what we needed and it works great.  </li>
      <li>it&#x27;s not that great for styling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Great hold.</li>
      <li>It looks great on your hair and holds up all day.  </li>
      <li>and I&#x27;ve been impressed with how Wholly Hemp&#x27;s styling wax was able to hold my hair style.</li>
      <li>It is a very good product, I love it for my hair.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
      <li>Good for your hair also.</li>
      <li>So makes the tree-huger in us all fill good that we aren&#x27;t throwing plastic tubes in the bucket.</li>
      <li>First off, it&#x27;s a great all-natural product which seems to nourish hair wonderfully.  </li>
      <li>I love this!</li>
      <li>Leaves a nice shine.</li>
      <li>it has a nice finish in the hair</li>
      <li>Again, it&#x27;s nice if that&#x27;s what you want, but this will not do at all for holding a style.  </li>
      <li>We were looking for hair wax and some popular recommended hair wax products were rated a 10</li>
      <li>And a nice finished look.</li>
      <li>Overall, great product and I will continue to buy this until I either decide to make my own or they stop producing this wonderful product.</li>
      <li>From him: It moisturizes my hair well and adds some nice texture.</li>
      <li>I love the consistency and use this as kind of a leave in conditioner.</li>
      <li>All natural which is wonderful and smell is earthy, just like hemp smells.</li>
      <li>This is by far the best hair wax I&#x27;ve ever tried.  </li>
      <li>I had to use a lot to style my hair appropriately</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m hoping they come up with a line with a bit more hold and firmness for men.</li>
      <li>Has a nice, light nutty scent like hemp oil</li>
      <li>This stuff works fantastic!</li>
      <li>seems more like styling oil than wax.</li>
      <li>Grateful to this company for making a safe quality product.</li>
      <li>Maybe if it was mostly beeswax would it</li>
      <li>I want more wax.</li>
      <li>Best for guys with semi short hair.</li>
      <li>I appreciate greatly the simple and good ingredients this is made out of, but by itself it does not do the trick.</li>
      <li>but if you shower and don&#x27;t wash your hair with soap most of the product will remain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It seems more like a leave in conditioner than it does a hair styling product.</li>
      <li>used because I started freaking out on how many chemicals were in my house.&lt;br</li>
      <li>You are better off getting some coconut oil and some beeswax and make a portion that is 20x the amount.</li>
      <li>Seems more like a sample.</li>
      <li>I love this wax.</li>
      <li>My friend &amp; coworker wonders if I have been using rogain or something to thicken my hair.  :)</li>
      <li>more disclosure.  </li>
      <li>Love the recycling aspect of their business model.</li>
      <li>Most importantly, the ingredients can not be beat!</li>
      <li>Its basically just bees wax, take a glob, warm it up by rubbing your hands together to smooth it out, then you apply.</li>
      <li>love that I am not putting garbage in my hair.</li>
      <li>My husband and three sons use this wax to style their hair and I am pleased that no harmful chemicals are stuck in their hair all day.</li>
      <li>But i&#x27;m sure when you get use to using the correct ratio on your hair it will work well for you.</li>
      <li>My husband can also go swimming and get out with his hair still styled:)</li>
      <li>You have to work it in to make sure that it melts.</li>
      <li>Good all day hold from my first impression.</li>
      <li>I love when I can read the ingredients on the labels of something I buy so easily.</li>
      <li>It smells really good and works really well.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried many hair styling products including pomade, gel, clay, horse manure (just kidding) and Wholly Hemp is the best I&#x27;ve used hands down.</li>
      <li>I have used it when my hair is shorter (fresh buzz) and longer (parted and styled with most strands able to reach to my ears).</li>
      <li>washes out easily with shampoo.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve switched completely over and am very happy with this natural wax.</li>
      <li>Gives hair a light shine and mdeium hold.</li>
      <li>gives my hair a light sheen and keeps it from frizzing out.</li>
      <li>Loved it, all natural ingredients.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m just about through my first jar of this and have to say: I completely love it.</li>
      <li>Fantastic ingredients makes for a light but firm hold, with the coconut oil adding the right amount of a very pleasant smell.</li>
      <li>nice natural and organic,</li>
      <li>I hoped for, but it&#x27;s not bad.  </li>
      <li>made in usa and organic so it should be good for our long term being.</li>
      <li>Good for light messy styles - not spikey/quiffs.</li>
      <li>It provides a nice shine and basic control.  </li>
      <li>I think the marketplace needs an all natural hair styling product, but the ingrediance need to be tweaked for a better hold.</li>
      <li>My scalp rarely itches.</li>
      <li>It smells kind of weird (like hemp seed), but works great.</li>
      <li>if it smelt better, maybe something piney that could be naturally derived.</li>
      <li>My hair stays right where I put it.</li>
      <li>This is good solid styling wax without the garbage found in many other waxes.  </li>
      <li>so far this is the best natural hair care product I&#x27;ve found.. although my hair seems a little greasy by the end of the day with it.</li>
      <li>highly recommend the two used together!!</li>
      <li>It actually holds my hair style better thru the day and adds some thickness.  </li>
      <li>But, so basic and so safe.  </li>
      <li>With the hair wax, it seems to maintain styling better until 5 but with a bit of volume.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;net net.</li>
      <li>He&#x27;s had no ill effects from it.</li>
      <li>/&gt;I would definitely recommend trying this product if you want a healthy alternative to chemical-ridden name brand products.</li>
      <li>The safe chemicals factor was big for me</li>
      <li>I bought this off the mostly good reviews and found a few to be spot-on.  </li>
      <li>and i am pretty sure will last a while because you don&#x27;t need much.</li>
      <li>like that it is all natural and friendly.</li>
      <li>The fact that it works without the use of harmful chemicals makes it worth every dollar spent :-)</li>
      <li>Again, the key for me was using less which oddly gave me more control and a pleasant healthy look to my hair (not too oily).  </li>
      <li>I bought this product a few months ago, and I was very pleased with it.</li>
      <li>Too much and the oily look happens, but a super small amount is just right and somehow seems to give better hold than too much did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Works extremely well for short hair, long hold, and smells lightly wonderful (earthy, honey, gensing).</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Wonderfully simple, clean product but if you&#x27;re looking for men&#x27;s short hair styling, this is not it. Goes on really well, and keeps your hair&#x27;s shape pretty much, but after a while it just fades leaving a slight sheen, no real firm hold or texture. If you&#x27;re using something like argon oil for lustre and have long hair, my guess is this would work. I&#x27;m hoping they come up with a line with a bit more hold and firmness for men.</li>
    <li> This product is a rip off. You are better off getting some coconut oil and some beeswax and make a portion that is 20x the amount. It&#x27;s just basically coconut oil. It doesn&#x27;t hold like wax. So disappointed</li>
    <li> I thought I&#x27;d give this wax a try after reading the ingredients label of my American Crew Fiber that I have used for the past year and a half...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is medium length but very light and difficult to control. This stuff gives a firm hold that is never crunchy or slimy, and is much easier to rework throughout the day if your hair gets messed up than other waxes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not only are the ingredients safer and less like lab chemicals, turns out it actually works better than Fiber! I&#x27;ve switched completely over and am very happy with this natural wax. The 4 oz. size has lasted me a couple months of using it every day, so it&#x27;s a great value too. Definitely give this stuff a shot!</li>
    <li> It is a very good product, I love it for my hair.&lt;br /&gt;The only thing is that they mentionned vanilla in the ingredients, and there is no real good smell</li>
    <li> Works awesome. Can be hard to get out of your hair even with shampoo. Best for guys with semi short hair. My bangs go past my mouth</li>
    <li> I bought this off the mostly good reviews and found a few to be spot-on.  First off, it&#x27;s a great all-natural product which seems to nourish hair wonderfully.  That said... it&#x27;s not that great for styling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I put in a tiny amount and found it has virtually no hold whatsoever and just made my hair look shiny and oily.  Again, it&#x27;s nice if that&#x27;s what you want, but this will not do at all for holding a style.  Maybe if it was mostly beeswax would it hold?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***UPDATE: after using it a few more times, I&#x27;ve come around with this product.  It still doesn&#x27;t give the level of hold I hoped for, but it&#x27;s not bad.  The key for my short hair is to use a very very small amount, rub it in my palms and run it through my hair.  Too much and the oily look happens, but a super small amount is just right and somehow seems to give better hold than too much did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still wish they&#x27;d make it with a higher concentration of beeswax (assuming that would equal better hold), but it still works well enough.  Anyway, this stuff is hair therapy, complete opposite of most every other product.  I use it for more day-to-day casual styling and save my \\&quot;weirder\\&quot; product for when I need to have some serious style and control.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The amount I use is so incredibly small, this jar will last me at least 3-5 years.  If I balled it up, it would probably be the size of a grain of rice or two.  Again, the key for me was using less which oddly gave me more control and a pleasant healthy look to my hair (not too oily).  A pea size or more meant a very oily look with less hold.  I&#x27;m a guy with short hair, btw.  Find what amount works for you.</li>
    <li> I love the consistency and use this as kind of a leave in conditioner. I don&#x27;t use shampoo or conditioner anymore, just baking soda and organic apple cider vinegar and this product  is the perfect complement to my granola cosmetic needs.</li>
    <li> All natural which is wonderful and smell is earthy, just like hemp smells. The only negative is it is a touch oily, but not oily enough to stop using.</li>
    <li> Just what we needed and it works great.  The basic natural ingredients can&#x27;t be beat.  It&#x27;s rated an impressive 0 by the EWG.  We were looking for hair wax and some popular recommended hair wax products were rated a 10 - there&#x27;s no way we&#x27;re using that, no matter how well it would work.  Grateful to this company for making a safe quality product.</li>
    <li> This is by far the best hair wax I&#x27;ve ever tried.  I have wavy thick hair is most gels either can&#x27;t hold my hair or flake off.  This gel hold my hair, and no flakes.  Plus no chemicals.</li>
    <li> I was using Brylcreem Hard Wax from England until I found out from the EWG that that stuff is loaded with toxins that the manufacturer refuses to disclose!  So I dumped it and searched for an alternative.  I found this excellent product from Wholly Hemp.  It looks great on your hair and holds up all day.  And it doesn&#x27;t have any toxic crap that will hurt you down the line.  Load up on it!</li>
    <li> Makes your hair look greasy for sure.&lt;br /&gt;I used because I started freaking out on how many chemicals were in my house.&lt;br /&gt;It definitely does not hold as well as traditional gel/wax. I like the other poster&#x27;s idea to use it as a base material with a better material on top. That way you can lessen a few chemicals.&lt;br /&gt;The person who said it works great and potentially grows back hair is either a liar or owns the company.</li>
    <li> I love this wax. Holds my hairstyle all day. Good for your hair also.</li>
    <li> I was trying to find an organic wax/pomade.  Every one contains too much oil ratio.  Still haven&#x27;t found what I need, so I switched to giovanni for now.</li>
    <li> similar to a pomade or hair grease. only three natural ingredients. washes out easily with shampoo. holds hair in place through out the day</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried many hair styling products including pomade, gel, clay, horse manure (just kidding) and Wholly Hemp is the best I&#x27;ve used hands down. A little goes a long way and it holds for the whole day. I&#x27;ve decided to grow my hair a little longer than I normally do due to fall/winter and I&#x27;ve been impressed with how Wholly Hemp&#x27;s styling wax was able to hold my hair style. Plus it&#x27;s natural. Go get you some!</li>
    <li> It dries out and gets sticky thus stir in either almond oil or coconut oil.  You have to work it in to make sure that it melts.</li>
    <li> so far this is the best natural hair care product I&#x27;ve found.. although my hair seems a little greasy by the end of the day with it. But i&#x27;m sure when you get use to using the correct ratio on your hair it will work well for you.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m just about through my first jar of this and have to say: I completely love it. I have used it when my hair is shorter (fresh buzz) and longer (parted and styled with most strands able to reach to my ears). I have a thick beard, too, and use this wax to keep it from being fuzzy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love that I am not putting garbage in my hair. My fiancee has even indicated that my hair looks fuller (added bonus). Overall, great product and I will continue to buy this until I either decide to make my own or they stop producing this wonderful product.</li>
    <li> I love this! Im totally rockin&#x27; the hipster greasy strait hair look finally! I have wavy/curly jew fro hair, with this I can do the Beatles! On the flip-side, I can also pull of a Don Draper make moves on 5th Ave. Its basically just bees wax, take a glob, warm it up by rubbing your hands together to smooth it out, then you apply. Most importantly, the ingredients can not be beat!</li>
    <li> This stuff does the trick on my straight, fine, relatively thick hair.  It provides a nice shine and basic control.  It is essentially vegetable oil once you&#x27;ve rubbed it in your hands prior to application (it melts).  But, so basic and so safe.  It makes your hair look wet, so, that can be bad or good depending on your situation.  If you have gray hair, it will give it a wet and darker look.  I prefer to use it on the sides of my scalp to control that area and apply very little if any to the top.  I highly recommend the product.</li>
    <li> Is very paste like. With all the oils and such it seems like i am conditioning my hands and then once i have it melted I can put it in my hair. In the hair it works great. It seems more like a leave in conditioner than it does a hair styling product. My hair stays right where I put it. I don&#x27;t do crazy hair styles anymore. I put product in my hair simply because it is frizzy and I look like a giant fuzzball if I don&#x27;t. It does that job admirably. gives my hair a light sheen and keeps it from frizzing out. In fact even after the gym my hair is still in place. A shampoo will remove it but if you shower and don&#x27;t wash your hair with soap most of the product will remain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My complaints are one that the mouth of the jar is really small so it is hard to get my fingers in there to dig it out. I imagine once I get further along I will need something to dig it out with as my fingers will not work getting down to the bottom. Also it is really really thick. I think it could benefit from being more liquid less solid, but that is just a matter of personal preference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like that it is all natural and friendly. I guess you could eat it, but I don&#x27;t think I will try. It doesn&#x27;t have much of a scent, but I like that. I also like that even the packaging is recyclable. So makes the tree-huger in us all fill good that we aren&#x27;t throwing plastic tubes in the bucket. I will take glass over plastic any day.</li>
    <li> For reference, I am a male with dry/frizzy hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like to use wax to style my hair with a natural look, but all of the brand name products I&#x27;ve used have unnatural ingredients that damage and dry out my hair. I stumbled across this product when searching for an organic styling wax (it was pretty much the only one i found). This product is great! It actually moisturizes my hair while styling it. It has a bit of a funky smell that you have to get used to, but that is probably because there are only 4 ingredients in it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend trying this product if you want a healthy alternative to chemical-ridden name brand products. I will buy again when I finish my jar.</li>
    <li> Great hold. Awesome product!</li>
    <li> I ordered this product with a mix of optimism n reservations. After trying it I was really delighted to find out that it actually holds well for d entire day and a little goes a long way (I have medium short hair). The fact that it works without the use of harmful chemicals makes it worth every dollar spent :-)</li>
    <li> I have thick hair and I don&#x27;t recommend this for thick hair. I had to use a lot to style my hair appropriately and it is VERY HARD to get out of your hair. It does not wash out after two shampoos, it generally took me two-three days and two shampoos. Other people may like that one application last several days, but I&#x27;m not into that. Granted someone with thin hair, applying only a small amount, I imagine would get a great result. The smell is a little strange at first, but not bad and it disappears after about 15 min.</li>
    <li> I bought this product a few months ago, and I was very pleased with it. The bottle was small and it had a mild scent, but it worked well for me. I decided to do a second purchase of two bottles to save some money in shipping. Unfortunately, the 2nd batch wasn&#x27;t as good as the first. I noticed the hold was weaker and the scent was stronger. I ended up using a lot more than expected, so it turned into an expensive product. The scent is somewhat unpleasant but mild and eventually fades away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I conclude these variation in quality and scent should be expected given it&#x27;s a natural product. I&#x27;m somewhat torn with this product, I&#x27;ve put it away until the winter. I&#x27;ll reuse it then and will re-evaluate its use.</li>
    <li> Perfect for what I was looking for. I like the spiked look and it does it&#x27;s job.</li>
    <li> seems more like styling oil than wax. leaves my hair shiny/greasy. I guess the wax to oil ratios are off. I want more wax.</li>
    <li> It made my eyes sting something fierce so I passed it on to my brother. He&#x27;s had no ill effects from it.</li>
    <li> This is good solid styling wax without the garbage found in many other waxes.  I searched high and low for styling wax that didn&#x27;t contain petro-related additives and toxins like paraben.  This seems to do the trick!  The smell of the beeswax is great imo.  It seems to give a certain thickness and control to otherwise stuborn hair, especially hair that is freshly washed where it is frilly and frizzy.  Don&#x27;t let the small container deceive you as a little seems to go long ways.  Good all day hold from my first impression.</li>
    <li> This wax is great! Fantastic ingredients makes for a light but firm hold, with the coconut oil adding the right amount of a very pleasant smell. I just wish they had it in a larger container.</li>
    <li> It smells kind of weird (like hemp seed), but works great. I&#x27;d say 5 stars if it smelt better, maybe something piney that could be naturally derived.</li>
    <li> I appreciate greatly the simple and good ingredients this is made out of, but by itself it does not do the trick. I love to use this for everyday styling along with a DIY beach spray, I made mine from this recipe: http://wellnessmama.com/5054/beach-waves-hair-spray/&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend the two used together!! but not this one on it&#x27;s own, sadly.</li>
    <li> great product, i am a returning customer of this item. i like that its all natural with ingredients i can actually announce.</li>
    <li> I get complements at work on my hair styling after using this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used to use (yes past tense) products like American Crew Fiber and Redken Maneuver which have an interesting list of ingredients.  I would scratch my scalp during the day and noticed that I would shed a few strands of hair during the work day.  The shedding seemed to happen M-F because I don&#x27;t use product on the weekends.  So I wanted to try something else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff works well. It actually holds my hair style better thru the day and adds some thickness.  My hair is straight thick hair and cut in a generic corporate style with a single part on the left, about 3-4 inches long on top and &lt; 1/2 inch on the side. I tend to run my hair throughout the day.  3-4 weeks after a hair cut, my hair challenges the hair product&#x27;s ability to maintain styling.  With my old products, my 3-4 week hair would lose all styling around 3pm.  With the hair wax, it seems to maintain styling better until 5 but with a bit of volume.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;net net. highly recommended. Now I don&#x27;t shed noticeably during the day. My scalp rarely itches. My friend &amp; coworker wonders if I have been using rogain or something to thicken my hair.  :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;one more disclosure.  I have also changed from regular liquid shampoo to JR Liggett shampoo bar at the same time as using the Wholly Hemp wax. so if you are reading this, I can&#x27;t say that the hair wax will reduce your shedding by itself.  The combination of the two work for me.</li>
    <li> I was a tad surprised with the product and the smell.  Difficult to apply b/c it&lt;br /&gt;was the consistency of candle wax.  Love the recycling aspect of their business model.</li>
    <li> 5 stars for all natural ingredients, 1 star for styling wax. Using this &amp;#34;styling wax&amp;#34; for hair styling is equivalent to using coconut oil for styling your hair - it will make it greasy and thin looking as If you put oil in your hair. I think the marketplace needs an all natural hair styling product, but the ingrediance need to be tweaked for a better hold.</li>
    <li> I love when I can read the ingredients on the labels of something I buy so easily. Just four ingredients in this little jar of wax; coconut oil, beeswax, hemp seed oil, and rosemary extract. My husband and three sons use this wax to style their hair and I am pleased that no harmful chemicals are stuck in their hair all day. My husband can also go swimming and get out with his hair still styled:) I would recommend keeping the jar up high when not in use. My children have knocked the jar off the bathroom counter twice now and broke the jar. Just this morning my husband was weeding through shards of glass that was stuck in the wax from my son knocking it off a tiny hotel bathroom sink when we were in Tahoe for my cousins wedding. So just be careful to put it away when not in use. Aside from this happening, I like the jar because I prefer glass over plastic and you can reuse the jars as well.</li>
    <li> Works perfectly.  Holds my hair without it looking greasy and does it without the need for nasty chemicals.  I also occasionally use it as hand balm after rock climbing since it&#x27;s considerably cheaper than Climb-On or Giddy.</li>
    <li> My husband bought this. From him: It moisturizes my hair well and adds some nice texture. No smell. The holding power is WEAK, but I use a blow dryer on damp hair to help it lay or stand a certain way. The safe chemicals factor was big for me and I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll find a stronger hold (nor that I want one; they end up looking unnatural to me) that uses safer chemicals.</li>
    <li> It smells really good and works really well.</li>
    <li> five starts because it works on short hair. on long hair not so much. made in usa and organic so it should be good for our long term being. the only negative is that you have to wash your hands with soup after using it because it is greasy.</li>
    <li> It is what it says it is. I guess it does what it says it does. I mixed it with my homemade hair, scalp, face &amp; body conditioner to help with scent &amp; hold.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great hair wax and i am pretty sure will last a while because you don&#x27;t need much. However, it is such a small jar. Seems more like a sample.</li>
    <li> it has a nice finish in the hair but it doest hold it for long time. nice natural and organic, but if you want firm hold this is not a products for you.</li>
    <li> Works extremely well for short hair, long hold, and smells lightly wonderful (earthy, honey, gensing). Only downside is that it&#x27;s a little hard to evenly spread on your hands/fingers. Gave it to a friend because ai grew my hair out and he loves it. Gives hair a light shine and mdeium hold. Good for light messy styles - not spikey/quiffs.</li>
    <li> This stuff works fantastic! Much better than conventional hair styling products without all the chemicals plus makes your hair feel soft and well nourished. Has a nice, light nutty scent like hemp oil and you can even use it as chap stick it works great! I will definitely be purchasing this again.</li>
    <li> Loved it, all natural ingredients. No chemicals. And a nice finished look. Leaves a nice shine. Holds well. N no stickiness</li>
