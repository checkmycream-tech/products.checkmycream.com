      <li>i take a chance to buy more?  </li>
      <li>I ORDERED 2 MORE SINCE I LOVE THESE,&lt;br /&gt;HAD</li>
      <li>I get many comments on the Healing Garden Products...</li>
      <li>I love this scent and ordered it to spray as a room freshener and linen spray.</li>
      <li>I love this, but will not order again, as I cannot afford it.</li>
      <li>I love this smell.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know why they don&#x27;t make that any more, but this will do for my sheets.  </li>
      <li>I  had so many ask me,  WHAT  </li>
      <li>I LOVE IT.</li>
      <li>/&gt;i love  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very clean and neutral.</li>
      <li>It is light, refreshing, and garners many compliments.</li>
      <li>To my distress I don&#x27;t know where I will be able to find another lightly scented lavender spray again.  </li>
      <li>Sweet dreams!</li>
      <li>Refreshing and clean.  </li>
      <li>Not too strong.</li>
      <li>The way the mist is released is so fine and even, that it lasts FOREVER.</li>
      <li>Had such great reviews so</li>
      <li>if it were available.  </li>
      <li>This is a lovely, light fragrance that doesn&#x27;t overwhelm, but which remains fresh on the skin for 24 hours.  </li>
      <li>how the purple makes the bottle so pretty to !!</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t find it in any brick-and-mortar stores, so I&#x27;m willing to pay a bit more to find it online.</li>
      <li>I am so picky with smells, and this is by far my favorite!  </li>
      <li>Not too sweet.</li>
      <li>However, when it was delivered, it seemed the bottle wasn&#x27;t totally full, as if some had leaked out.</li>
      <li>this is certainly one of them: i&#x27;ve long been a proponent of what my youngest daughter calls &amp;#34;the Smell Good Stuff.&amp;#34; in most instances, i can purchase this at drugstores.</li>
      <li>I love the light soft fragrance.</li>
      <li>it arrived, today, however, i eagerly snipped open two layers of plastic — with my best scissors — only to find the interior of the bag dripping with moisture from the bottle.</li>
      <li>It has a light, clean odor and is refreshing to use especially in Summer.</li>
      <li>The leakage also did not damage the label so I was able to dry it off and include it in the gift basket--less was better than none.  </li>
      <li>he was nice Enough to return  my e mail,&lt;br /&gt;Amazon  </li>
      <li>he was nice Enough to return  my e mail,&lt;br /&gt;Amazon  </li>

      <li>if I can not send the hazardous item back to you or amazon, just how did you get to send it in the first place.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I like it very much.</li>
      <li>perhaps next time, i&#x27;ll just ask my favorite area drugstore to order the product, mm hmm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It is exactly what I wanted</li>
      <li>but it was exactly what I wanted, and I did not have time to replace it.  </li>
      <li>I have asthma and allergies and it is one fragrance I can use consistently.</li>
      <li>I have been using this product (my favorite scent) for years, laying in about an extra year&#x27;s supply, and was surprised to find that the product line no longer available in retail stores in in my area.  </li>
      <li>same as before,not repeating myself,if interested try it for yourself, what more can I say??</li>
      <li>Nice way to start the day calm, and always a little spritz on my neck right before bed.</li>
      <li>It smells great and is subtle.</li>
      <li>This is my favorite long time.</li>
      <li>My mom loves the lavender scent, and absolutely loves this gentle mist scent!</li>
      <li>This is a nice soft fragrance for a time when you need just a little fresh touch.</li>
      <li>lasted a whole 8 hours,&lt;br /&gt;its</li>
      <li>Went on line to initiate return but was informed that flammable materials can not be returned.&lt;br /&gt;Would like a refund for the cost of one bottle and its share of the handling costs since it was not handled very well.&lt;br /&gt;One</li>
      <li>ill wear it with  more perfumes  to create  my own  smell  &amp; others  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I love this, but will not order again, as I cannot afford it. It too bad, lavender is such a nice delicate scent. Relaxing and bugs hate it and I have not had a bug bite in over 20 years since I started using lavender. I will have to find a cheaper outlet or make my own.</li>
    <li> this is a lovely product that may have been discontinued?  idk...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;buy it at cvs.com for $7.99!!!!!  wish healing garden would bring this back and the lotion too......</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t use other products anymore this is reasonably priced and it works my Grand daughter uses it for the same purpose and loves it also</li>
    <li> Maybe I got a bad bottle - the reviews were overwhelmingly good, but it smelled nothing like lavender. It smelled like musty soap. I had to shower after I sprayed it on, and ended up throwing the bottle away.</li>
    <li> I am tremendously pleased with purchase of The Healing Garden Rainwater Body Mist in Tender Lavender - it arrived within days of ordering it. I am now using in each and every day.</li>
    <li> I am so picky with smells, and this is by far my favorite!  This is the only body spray I like.  It&#x27;s very clean and neutral.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay but not too subtle.  Would prefer a less potent spray but it does the job.</li>
    <li> I still prefer  Lavender Mist, which Healing Gardens (Coty)  discontinued...sad. I no longer use Healing Gardens</li>
    <li> I wish I could still find this product in stores but so far can only find it in very few places, Amazon being one of them. I love the light soft fragrance.</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this product. If you like lavender you will love it! I use it at night before I go to bed just so I get that relaxing smell and I love it! it is not strong at all.</li>
    <li> I get many comments on the Healing Garden Products...Lavender is my favorite!!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used several different lavender mists but this is by far the nicest scent I&#x27;ve found.  I actually use it as a linen mist for our sheets and pillow cases and it works really well.  Sweet dreams!</li>
    <li> I bought a bottle of this in canada on a whim, and i normally don&#x27;t like the smell of lavender. This is so light and calms me so much..i&#x27;m addicted!</li>
    <li> This is the same scent as the former LavenderTheraphy, sold by the Healing Garden line and then discontinued. It is exactly what I wanted and I&#x27;m delighted to find it again. I can&#x27;t find it in any brick-and-mortar stores, so I&#x27;m willing to pay a bit more to find it online. This will last me a few years - one spritz per day. (I just finished my bottle of LavenderTherapy, which I purchased several years ago.) The scent of that bottle didn&#x27;t break down at all over the years, and I&#x27;m confident this one won&#x27;t either. It is light, refreshing, and garners many compliments. Not an overpowering scent at all.</li>
    <li> THIS IS THE BEST SLEEING PRODUCT ON THE MARKET. I LOVE IT.</li>
    <li> Great to spritz your sheets with. Both relaxing and romantic.</li>
    <li> Always liked The Healing Garden Lavender Body Mist.</li>
    <li> The product is one of my favorite fragrances. However, when it was delivered, it seemed the bottle wasn&#x27;t totally full, as if some had leaked out.</li>
    <li> I bought this as part of a Secret Santa gift.  The scent is fabulous but it was hand wrapped in a very tight plastic bag which squeezed the bottle and the cap was not screwed on tightly, so product leaked from the bottle into the bag.  I would have sent it back but it was exactly what I wanted, and I did not have time to replace it.  The leakage also did not damage the label so I was able to dry it off and include it in the gift basket--less was better than none.  I give 5 stars for the product and 1 star for the seller.</li>
    <li> Healing Garden is by far the best product out there for a lavender spray I buy it 1 million times because I run out of there all the time great smell and very relaxing</li>
    <li> Got exactly what I expected.</li>
    <li> It smells great and is subtle. It also helps with where I live b/c there are a lot of animals. It&#x27;s a great flea repellent.</li>
    <li> I love this body spray! I&#x27;ve used it for a long time and glad to find it available on amazon. Simple lavender smell that isn&#x27;t too complicated or over the top, just a simple lavender smell. Love it.</li>
    <li> I received this product as a gift with the matching 4-ounce body lotion a few years ago, and tried to find it in the local stores, but couldn&#x27;t.  I simply love its fresh scent and long lasting fragrance which stays with me all through the day.  I&#x27;ve tried using other lavender scented products, but it&#x27;s not the same as the one that The Healing Garden manufacturers. I recommend the RainWater Body Mist and Whipped Body Lotion by The Healing Garden to anyone who favors the lavender scent.  For me it is the absolute best!!!</li>
    <li> I love this scent and ordered it to spray as a room freshener and linen spray. Spray on your pillow before you go to bed and the lavender will help you sleep. I even take this with me when I travel.</li>
    <li> The lavender smell is light and good.</li>
    <li> I love this smell.  Growing up, we used Healing Garden Lavender Linen spray.  I don&#x27;t know why they don&#x27;t make that any more, but this will do for my sheets.  I might even use it on my body as well!</li>
    <li> I  had so many ask me,  WHAT  KIND  OF PERFUME  IS  THAT?&lt;br /&gt; I bought 2 before,&lt;br /&gt;I just bought 2 now,&lt;br /&gt;sometimes  ill wear it with  more perfumes  to create  my own  smell  &amp; others  likes it !!&lt;br /&gt;most of time  ill spray  it on me over my clothes,&lt;br /&gt;it really lasts a long time,&lt;br /&gt;mine lasted a whole 8 hours,&lt;br /&gt;its a calming scent  and smells so good,&lt;br /&gt;you can spray it on after a bath  or over your clothes,  i do !!&lt;br /&gt;i love  how the purple makes the bottle so pretty to !!&lt;br /&gt;be creative,&lt;br /&gt; spray  it on for your lover, yourself,&lt;br /&gt;out to a party,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;after a bath !!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT  I ORDERED 2 MORE SINCE I LOVE THESE,&lt;br /&gt;HAD A HARD TIME HUNTING DOWN TO E MAIL  THEM,&lt;br /&gt;----------------------------------------------------------------------MY HUSBAND SENT THEM THIS TO THEM VERY ANGRY  ABOUT THIS  I NOW HAVE  TO CHANGE 5 STARS TO ONLY ONE !!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Items were loosely packaged with only one protective bubble tube. The cap of one bottle was dislodged and over half&lt;br /&gt;of the material was spilled.

    <li> The spray, I bought by accident, is amazing. I use it to refresh bathroom, kitchen and wherever as well as a subtle body spray. The way the mist is released is so fine and even, that it lasts FOREVER. I use it, use it and use it thinking...&amp;#34;I don&#x27;t need a new bottle yet???&amp;#34; It doesn&#x27;t leave a heavy residue when sprayed into air for room deodorizer...it is just perfect. I never thought I&#x27;d like a frilly girl product like this but it is truly good stuff.</li>
    <li> i mist instead of perfume. it varies a little by the actual lavendar plant used for the fragrance. been using for years</li>
    <li> Love the soft scent of lavender. Everything I expected,.I have received complements and requests for the name of the product.</li>
    <li> Very nice lavender sniff!!</li>
    <li> Had such great reviews so I ordered a bottle.  It smells nothing like lavender, but does smell like roach spray.</li>
    <li> Product and service both great.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a lavender scent that was long lasting, and The Healing Garden brand has always come through for me.</li>
    <li> Would order this again.  Love it.</li>
    <li> i&#x27;m posting as louise, of ThelmaAndLouise — and no, i&#x27;m not the nice or shy one of the pair :^) i do love me some lavender-scented products, as anyone can see by my buying history. this is certainly one of them: i&#x27;ve long been a proponent of what my youngest daughter calls &amp;#34;the Smell Good Stuff.&amp;#34; in most instances, i can purchase this at drugstores. of late, however, there&#x27;s been a dearth of this particular scent, so i&#x27;ve been paying extra, to buy from amazon. in one instance, i was cornered into purchasing a trio of lotion and bodywash, just to obtain my favorite body mist. okay, so, this time, i was thrilled to find the mist on its own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;when it arrived, today, however, i eagerly snipped open two layers of plastic — with my best scissors — only to find the interior of the bag dripping with moisture from the bottle. seriously? the expense of two bags, but not a couple of cents spared for a piece of tape? ay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;this, um, dampens — yes, i did need that pun — my interest in paying almost double what i would at a drugstore. perhaps next time, i&#x27;ll just ask my favorite area drugstore to order the product, mm hmm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;caveat emptor.</li>
    <li> Keep it handy...in the car, etc. Wish it came in a small container for the purse!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this body mist for years....BUt I use it as a room spray and bed linen spray each day before I make the bed!</li>
    <li> Product arrived on time, and just as described.  My mom loves the lavender scent, and absolutely loves this gentle mist scent!</li>
    <li> The order arrived on time and everything was great.</li>
    <li> I like it.&lt;br /&gt;Lavender indeed. Not too strong. Not too sweet. For some reason makes me think of yoga.</li>
    <li> This product was not good - it had an odd aroma like it was spoiled.  I was not able to use it.  I was sad because this is an item that has been removed from store shelves and I loved it.</li>
    <li> It has a gentle, subtle lavender aroma. I have been wearing it for years. Never goes out of style or season</li>
    <li> Bought for my sweetheart. She loves it!</li>
    <li> I received my product and it came in a timely manner!!  Would order again!!!</li>
    <li> This is a nice soft fragrance for a time when you need just a little fresh touch.</li>
    <li> same as before,not repeating myself,if interested try it for yourself, what more can I say?? Lets start to move on</li>
    <li> My wife has been using this product for years</li>
    <li> received my order rapidly. Been using this product for years and now to find it was discontinued - I was not &amp;#34;happy&amp;#34;. But...now I am .. &amp;#34;happy&amp;#34;!</li>
    <li> I love using the Healing Garden Rainwater Body Mist.  It has a light, clean odor and is refreshing to use especially in Summer.</li>
    <li> Absolutely the best fragrance.</li>
    <li> smells great; not too much of a lavender fragrance if that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re going for, but still a nicel fragrance that stays with you.</li>
    <li> I  use this product all the time and that is why I ordered it.  The shipper sent it well wrapped and the containers arrived in good condition.  Yes, when anyone asks me about the fragrance I am wearing I tell them and that I am ordering it from Amazon.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for over 15 years, at least 3 three times a day!  Nice way to start the day calm, and always a little spritz on my neck right before bed. It&#x27;s the nicest version of Lavender I have ever experienced.</li>
    <li> Love this spray, please don&#x27;t change it. It&#x27;s my all time favorite scent. Will be ordering more.</li>
    <li> This is a lovely, light fragrance that doesn&#x27;t overwhelm, but which remains fresh on the skin for 24 hours.  When I take my shower the next day, the first thing I smell is lavender as my skin is warmed by the water.  I don&#x27;t wear any other perfumes, and I am deeply distressed that my local Rite Aid store has apparently stopped carrying it.  Glad I can get it thru Amazon!</li>
    <li> I love this product, so happy to find it on amazon. I have asthma and allergies and it is one fragrance I can use consistently.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product (my favorite scent) for years, laying in about an extra year&#x27;s supply, and was surprised to find that the product line no longer available in retail stores in in my area.  As always I am totally satisfied with the product, would happily recommend it to friends, etc. if it were available.  To my distress I don&#x27;t know where I will be able to find another lightly scented lavender spray again.  This is a great disappointment to me.  Would appreciate suggestions if someone has one.</li>
    <li> Too strong,  not really lavender,was looking for a pure lavender scent. Very hard to find!!</li>
    <li> I have worn this brand of lavender cologne for many years and never get tired of it.  I rated it four stars only because the scent does not stay on the skin for very long.  Perhaps layering with lotion would help.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite long time. Store was out of order and stop buy re-order I become very disappointing and keep looking for long time until I found it at Amazon. I ordered and bought for bottle. Lavender is my number one and smell so good and mild. Rate is five.</li>
    <li> Use it every day, and glad I ordered it.  Refreshing and clean.  Would order it again.  I like it very much.</li>
    <li> Smells amazing!- I use it as room spray also.</li>
    <li> Received shipment in timely manner.  It is a bit strong in scent, but a nice change.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a Christmas gift for someone who said this was their all time favorite body spray.  I got to smell it when she opened it, and i did smell really good.</li>
    <li> I really love this scent and am sorry that it is being discontinued.  Instead of receiving the item packaged as the image shows, I actually received (4) 2 oz. bottles.  I actually received more of the product than I ordered (not complaining) and since the product was packaged smaller (again not complaining) I can carry a bottle in my purse or carry-on when traveling.</li>
