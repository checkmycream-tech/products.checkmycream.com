      <li>I LOVE the Hydrathermal Naturals products.</li>
      <li>Thank-you for such an excellent product</li>
      <li>The moisturizer was ok.</li>
      <li>I think it would work better for hair that is thicker than mine.</li>
      <li>If any one can tell me otherwise that this product is safe</li>
      <li>but I&#x27;m more focused on the 2 I just mentioned.</li>
      <li>This is ok</li>
      <li>well so far and smells great.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know what to do with more than 3/4 full of the rest of it.</li>
      <li>just right glad i purchase this item</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m excited about this product.</li>
      <li>I just used the oil first and came to love it.</li>
      <li>It is great however to use after I dry my hair</li>
      <li>The conditioner would give me the slip but after I was done shampooing, it wasn&#x27;t anything special.</li>
      <li>when you buy products make sure you read the label and UNDERSTAND what every ingredient really is.</li>
      <li>makes my hair feel really soft smells really nice too.</li>
      <li>It smells really sweet, but for those that worry about fragrance, it will disappear quickly.  </li>
      <li>I love that everything is all natural!</li>
      <li>Still buy this product, though, just be careful with the amount you use because it is still a good product</li>
      <li>nice daily moisturizer.</li>
      <li>This moisturizer is really good, but I cannot use it on my wet hair as a leave-in because my hair just soaks too much of its moisture and turns greasy.  </li>
      <li>My African American hair is super dry and this moisturizer is perfect for my hair.</li>
      <li>Love hydratherma naturals daily moisturizer growth lotion.  </li>
      <li>but I will most likely buy again and use sparingly</li>
      <li>It instantly softens my hair and gives it a healthy shine.  </li>
      <li>I personally just like the oil better.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t like and not use it because my hair feels funny after applying this product.</li>
      <li>will be getting more in the future</li>
      <li>I truly love this stuff makes my natural hair soft not to greasy</li>
      <li>but I was still able to use almost everyday to keep my hair super hydrated.</li>
      <li>but my hair didn&#x27;t really like it..</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s much easier to manage my hair using these products.</li>
      <li>However, if too much is used, hair will have a gooey</li>
      <li>The first time I used this item my hair was a greasy mess, but that was my fault for thinking I needed more product because my hair is longer.  </li>
      <li>My hair has gotten stronger and is looking very healthy lately</li>
      <li>My natural hair is soft, manageable and overall healthy using this product line.</li>
      <li>Great product and will last for at least 3-6months depending on use.&lt;br /&gt;Brune A.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s highly priced and doesn&#x27;t live up to expectations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>and this is one of the new products I&#x27;ve been using.</li>
      <li>This lotion makes my natural hair look silky, shiny and soft!</li>
      <li>Maybe it is just my head, but I do not have a naturally oily head.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t have the Hydratherma Natural Growth Oil as yet</li>
      <li>It is still too early to detect growth and it is improving my texture</li>
      <li>It made my hair soft and moisturized.  </li>
      <li>It did keep my hair moisturized and soft</li>
      <li>This is slowly changing after I started using more Hydraterma Naturals products.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using the whole line of products since my big chop in 2009,  and they&#x27;ve helped my hair to grow all the way back to the length it was before my big chop, which was 13&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>Hydratherma Naturals Daily Moisturizing Growth Lotion has been a different treatment for me, but results so far are good.&lt;br</li>
      <li>At first when I applied the mosturizer my hair felt funny,but I continued using a little at a time to give it a chance and to my avail my hair loves it</li>
      <li>and it gets dry all the time this product melted into my strands and left my hair soft and shiny.  </li>

    <li> Very good moisturizer for natural 4c hair.  However, if too much is used, hair will have a gooey feel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use after shampooing,  while hair is still wet. I think this product works best if you adopt the hydratherma hair care regimen, which is great for retain lenght.</li>
    <li> Great product and will last for at least 3-6months depending on use.&lt;br /&gt;Brune A.</li>
    <li> The first time I used this item my hair was a greasy mess, but that was my fault for thinking I needed more product because my hair is longer.  After using follicle mist since summer of 2011 I&#x27;ve been slowly adding this line of products to use on my hair.  My hair is long (mid-back length) not too wavy or curly (I&#x27;d say 2b/2c), chemically treated, and I&#x27;ve been trying to let it grow for years.  The problem is that I usually end up cutting it because it is very fragile, breaks easily, and I like to wear it straight so I blow dry it once a week.  This is slowly changing after I started using more Hydraterma Naturals products.  This moisturizer is really good, but I cannot use it on my wet hair as a leave-in because my hair just soaks too much of its moisture and turns greasy.  It is great however to use after I dry my hair and I use a pea size amount (yes, just that!) and focus on my ends.  It instantly softens my hair and gives it a healthy shine.  I am currently using it almost daily on my dry hair after I brush it in the morning and before going to bed at night. It smells really sweet, but for those that worry about fragrance, it will disappear quickly.  My hair has gotten stronger and is looking very healthy lately and this is one of the new products I&#x27;ve been using.</li>
    <li> I have been natural for over a year and this is the best product that I have ever purchased for my 3C hair.  It made my hair soft and moisturized.  I stocked up.  The smell is great as well.</li>
    <li> I really liked the smell of this product. It did keep my hair moisturized and soft but I thought it was a little sticky for my hair texture. I think it would work better for hair that is thicker than mine. Overall, I did like the product.</li>
    <li> A bit on the oily side but I was still able to use almost everyday to keep my hair super hydrated.</li>
    <li> This product is the truth!  I have been searching for a daily moisturized for a while now, and watch a you tube channel about Hydrathema naturals.  The process made a lot of sense so I decided to try the moisturizer!  WOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOW ! is all I can say I have 4/c 4/b hair and it gets dry all the time this product melted into my strands and left my hair soft and shiny.  I will be purchasing the kit to give a review on the shampoo and conditioners also; but this is going to be a staple in my product collection !</li>
    <li> I love this moisturizer. I don&#x27;t have to use a lot of it for results. My African American hair is super dry and this moisturizer is perfect for my hair. The dryness is non-existant and I don&#x27;t have to use the moisturizer everyday. I don&#x27;t even have to wet (more like drench) my hair everyday like I use to. I&#x27;m really shocked at the results. I believe the PH balance of the product is the key to my results. I became a product junky trying to find a product that would get rid of the dryness and I think I found it....bye bye other products</li>
    <li> This product worked okay nothing for me to rave about. I think it&#x27;s overpriced to have a small bottle like this anyway. If they want to charge that much at least give me a bigger bottle that will last longer. (FOREAL!)</li>
    <li> nice daily moisturizer. makes my hair feel really soft smells really nice too. Is a bit on the expensive side but I will most likely buy again and use sparingly</li>
    <li> I liked the hair lotion. But the shampoo matted my hair really bad in the shower. The leave in conditioner didn&#x27;t help. I couldn&#x27;t put a comb through my hair. Lost hair in process. Will not order this again. I will in fact throw away most of what I purchased.</li>
    <li> Hydratherma Naturals Daily Moisturizing Growth Lotion has been a different treatment for me, but results so far are good.&lt;br /&gt;Typically, I leave the treatment of my hair to my pro stylist, but I wanted to try this product in consideration of a recommendation&lt;br /&gt;from Dr. Oz concerning moisturizing treatment for chemically colored hair.  I applied this lotion for several days, and I noticed a&lt;br /&gt;difference in my hair.  My hair felt softer, and I will continue to use it to see if there are further improvements.  I recommend this&lt;br /&gt;product with the condition that I believe continual use over a period of months will be the best way to evaluate the effectiveness&lt;br /&gt;of this product.</li>
    <li> I truly love this stuff makes my natural hair soft not to greasy just right glad i purchase this item will be getting more in the future</li>
    <li> This combination of oil and lotion is perfect.  You will have well moisturized hair and good growth and it will also stop the shedding</li>
    <li> Love hydratherma naturals daily moisturizer growth lotion.  It moisturizes, softens and nourishes my hair so well.  I&#x27;ve been using the whole line of products since my big chop in 2009,  and they&#x27;ve helped my hair to grow all the way back to the length it was before my big chop, which was 13&amp;#34; long.  Anyone natural will not be disappointed!!!!  Thanks Saleemah for an amazing product!!!</li>
    <li> I have 4c hair. I got the moisturizing shampoo, conditioner, and a moisture lotion or something. I didn&#x27;t care for any of them. Not enough moisture. Hair would feel weird with the shampoo and mat together. No slip. The conditioner would give me the slip but after I was done shampooing, it wasn&#x27;t anything special. Hair was dry and tangled and nappy. Lol. The moisturizer was ok. My hair would have moisture, then dry out after about an hour, and then in the humid nights it would get moist again but only slightly. So I definitely don&#x27;t recommend it for dry climates. When the air was dry, so was my hair. I don&#x27;t recommend this product. It&#x27;s highly priced and doesn&#x27;t live up to expectations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t feel like rewriting so I&#x27;m doing copy and paste for the 3 products.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like and not use it because my hair feels funny after applying this product. I don&#x27;t know what to do with more than 3/4 full of the rest of it. I thought the other reviewers were telling the truth.</li>
    <li> Smells like cake but my hair didn&#x27;t really like it.. Dang it..</li>
    <li> This lotion makes my natural hair look silky, shiny and soft! It&#x27;s much easier to manage my hair using these products.</li>
    <li> Great moisturizer and smell. My hair is currently in braids and grows slow. I bought this to moisture my hair after I ran out on my other moisturizer and wanted to try something different. I will update on if it helped with my hair growth after I take my braids down in a month.</li>
    <li> At first when I applied the mosturizer my hair felt funny,but I continued using a little at a time to give it a chance and to my avail my hair loves it</li>
    <li> I personally just like the oil better. This is ok it moisturizes well so far and smells great. I just used the oil first and came to love it.</li>
    <li> This moisturizing growth lotion works wonders for my hair.  I started using this product about two months ago and I have already obtained length that I did not think possible.  I don&#x27;t have the Hydratherma Natural Growth Oil as yet so I am using the Jamacian Castor Oil.  I am in the process of ordering the Oil and can not wait to see the result using the entire system.  I&#x27;m excited about this product.</li>
    <li> I ordered it but I didn&#x27;t try it. I only wanted the shampoo and the conditioner. I&#x27;m sure this is a great product but I&#x27;m more focused on the 2 I just mentioned.</li>
    <li> I didnt mean to give this product a one (1) but they didnt have a zero. Ladies BEWARE when you buy products make sure you read the label and UNDERSTAND what every ingredient really is. Don&#x27;t be like me and look up ingredients once you get the stuff home. I am a big supporter of black owned business, but I&#x27;m going to have to stop investing my money in black businesses. I bought this about  two weeks ago and found out it contains GERMAL PLUS a presvitive know to be TOXIC. I&#x27;m scared to use this stuff thinking I may become sick using it. I just had twin girls five months ago and I need to be around a long time for them. Not trying to scare anyone, but I know i&#x27;m not the only one who has done research on ingredients in this product or any other product.If any one can tell me otherwise that this product is safe i&#x27;ve lost my money.</li>
    <li> I LOVE the Hydrathermal Naturals products. My natural hair is soft, manageable and overall healthy using this product line. Thank-you for such an excellent product</li>
    <li> I love this hair product! Their entire line is unbelievable! Hydratherma Naturals Daily Moisturizing Growth Lotion has done wonders for my hair. The price is so reasonable and I haven&#x27;t found anything this good, ever! I love that everything is all natural!</li>
    <li> It says on the bottle to use in conjunction with the Hair Growth Oil.  Maybe it is just my head, but I do not have a naturally oily head.  I found, though, when I used both products together (sparingly) after my hair dried it was still oily.  It is still too early to detect growth and it is improving my texture I just wish since it says daily, I could actually use it daily without my hair being oily.  I am going to try to use even less than what I was using previously.  Still buy this product, though, just be careful with the amount you use because it is still a good product and it does work.</li>
