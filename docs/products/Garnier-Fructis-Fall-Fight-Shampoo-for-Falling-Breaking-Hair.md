      <li>lol</li>
      <li>/&gt;It smells great</li>
      <li>I used a bottle of it and didn&#x27;t realize how good it worked until the bottle was gone, and I couldn&#x27;t find it in stores, and had to switch to something else.</li>
      <li>it does not leave my hair feeling good</li>

      <li>(I had tried it at a friend&#x27;s house and liked it) but the store I went to didn&#x27;t have it</li>
      <li>We love this product.  </li>
      <li>Love this stuff.</li>
      <li>My hair doesn&#x27;t look or feel any stronger or more \\&quot;fortified\\&quot; than before.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s redeeming quality, in my opinion, is the Biotin.</li>
      <li>but sure did stop breakage.</li>
      <li>I love this shampoo.</li>
      <li>this helps :)</li>
      <li>This is one of Garnier&#x27;s newest products and it has an interesting concept.</li>
      <li>I am scared to brush my hair because of how much more hair goes onto the brush.</li>
      <li>Will buy again for sure.</li>
      <li>We are still waiting for the miracle product that will help us retain more of our hair.</li>
      <li>The bottle was opened and most of the shampoo was in the bag it was shipped in.</li>
      <li>Before using the Fall Fight Line I bragged about how I use Garnier and was confident in their products that my friends and sisters also bought this line.</li>
      <li>honestly more of my hair is falling out and it looks A LOT thinner</li>
      <li>So I was pleased with those results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I gave it two stars because they smell pretty good and did not leave frizziness in my hair.</li>
      <li>After about a week of using it, I started noticing a good difference in how much hair I was losing.  </li>
      <li>Otherwise, it smells ok and keeps everything clean.</li>
      <li>the first use, I really liked this</li>
      <li>My hair is really fine</li>
      <li>and it is fine.  </li>
      <li>Great shampoo, left my hair light and shiny.  </li>
      <li>but I don&#x27;t notice a huge change in my hair.</li>
      <li>It also smells nice, which isn&#x27;t really a factor when I&#x27;m buying shampoo, but it is an added bonus.</li>
      <li>thrilled with this product and highly recommend it!</li>
      <li>I won&#x27;t say that this kept my hair from falling out as I still had issues even after using it, but the shampoo always made my hair soft and it smells good, so I can&#x27;t say I dislike it at all.</li>
      <li>Excited to see I can get this shampoo through Amazon.</li>
      <li>It cleans our hair with natural ingredients, rinses out easily, smells great and leaves hair very soft.  </li>
      <li>The only reason I gave it 2 stars is because it smells really good.  </li>
      <li>It was delivered in quick time and just as it was described.</li>
      <li>Instead I noticed when I used this product that I was losing way more than I normally was losing before using this product.  </li>
      <li>first few months i loved it!</li>
      <li>For the price, I think it is definitely worth it.</li>
      <li>Although my hair is fine, I have a lot of it so in reality, I didn&#x27;t buy this shampoo for the &#x27;fall fight&#x27; factor, I was just trying to find a fairly normal shampoo.  </li>
      <li>The first week I used this along with it&#x27;s partner, Fall Fight conditioner.</li>
      <li>It did leave my hair soft though, and it smells absolutely fantastic.</li>
      <li>my nails started growing much faster and thicker!</li>
      <li>I am an avid lotion user</li>
      <li>Priced much better than my local grocery store.  </li>
      <li>I think certain products work better with different hair types.</li>
      <li>, hair is  flat and lifeless as it has gradually pulled most of my curl out.</li>
      <li>Plus - I stopped using it about a week ago, and my skin has stopped peeling and is already looking much</li>
      <li>I was losing so much hair</li>
      <li>My hair is usually very shiny.</li>
      <li>I have had a lot of shedding issues post pregnancy and was looking for a shampoo that would really strengthen my hair.</li>
      <li>For years, I had been looking for a shampoo/conditioner that would keep my hair from shedding so much.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not saying this is a miracle cure for dandruff, but it has seemed to really help my hair.  </li>
      <li>I shed SO much i though \\&quot;this would be great\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I think its to it not falling out so much....</li>
      <li>The vitamins really really make a difference with my nails</li>
      <li>I normally have pretty flat/fine hair.</li>
      <li>thanks again...</li>
      <li>I actually found more hairs wrapped around my fingers after a shower than with my old shampoo.</li>
      <li>I take Hair, Skin and Nails vitamins with biotin because my fingernails chip and break easily and are hard to grow and my hair breaks easily.</li>
      <li>I love Garnier, all my other products have been from Garnier, hair spray, mousse, hair milk, wave spray...</li>
      <li>I have long medium fine hair.</li>
      <li>When this product first came out i ran right out and bought basically the next day.</li>
      <li>Pretty much all I use is Garnier, so when my hair was shedding more than usual</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve always liked Garnier products in the past</li>
      <li>My hair has more life to it and I am shedding a ton less.</li>
      <li>I talked to my hair dresser who said that&#x60;s what happens when you get older and it was happening to her as well.</li>
      <li>I have been using this line for the last 2 1/2 months and have only seen more shedding than before.</li>
      <li>I noticed a HUGE difference after the first few washes.</li>
      <li>Great product, I was skeptical but it seems to be working to fight the hair loss my medication causes.</li>
      <li>Also, it made my hair feel so super dry.  </li>
      <li>We also noticed that our hair dried extremely quickly (I thought I would mention this as it really doesn&#x27;t pertain to the dryness - but it was very</li>
      <li>I tried this for the first time last night.</li>
      <li>(: The conditioner makes my hair so soft and easy to brush, which makes for less damage to my hair.</li>
      <li>This was my first and last experience with Garnier products, although its very cheap it&#x27;s still not worth the money!!!</li>
      <li>It kept it&#x27;s promise as far as loosing strands, I lost maybe 2 to 5 during this period.</li>
      <li>My hair naturally falls out a lot because I have a lot of hair.</li>
      <li>I&#x60;m going to be 63 next month and about 6 months ago I noticed I was losing more hair then usual.</li>
      <li>I had wanted to buy the garnier daily care for normal hair</li>
      <li>The only new product I had begun using was this one, so I have to assume that it was this.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s pretty average...</li>

<li> It also didn&#x27;t look like dry skin.  </li>
<li> so I know it wasn&#x27;t just from dry skin.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> When this product first came out i ran right out and bought basically the next day. I shed SO much i though \\&quot;this would be great\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;I love Fructis! I have several bottles of shampoo/ conditioner and styling products!&lt;br /&gt;The first few months i loved it! I noticed LESS hair falling out. But, within the last 2-3 months ive noticed its worse then it was so ive stopped using it!&lt;br /&gt;It smells great but im not longer using this shampoo or conditioner.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s pretty average...lather is not all that great and can&#x27;t say I&#x27;ve noticed any difference.</li>
    <li> I was losing so much hair I actually sought a doctor&#x27;s opinion. There was nothing medically wrong with me. I found this shampoo and it has helped quite a bit. I have far less hair loss than before.</li>
    <li> I bought this shampoo and conditioner 2 weeks ago and I LOVE it! I have had a lot of shedding issues post pregnancy and was looking for a shampoo that would really strengthen my hair. I thought I would give this a try (especially since it was under $3 where I bought it). I noticed a HUGE difference after the first few washes. My hair has more life to it and I am shedding a ton less. I normally have pretty flat/fine hair. The shampoo also smells amazing. I am also taking a Biotin supplement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think other reviewers need to realize that just because a certain product doesn&#x27;t work for you, it doesn&#x27;t mean the product sucks. I think certain products work better with different hair types.</li>
    <li> Smells great kids like it. Adults like it. Seems to work well  should have bought the conditioner with it lol</li>
    <li> I had bariatric surgery and my hair was falling out, so I decided to give this a shot.  I won&#x27;t say that this kept my hair from falling out as I still had issues even after using it, but the shampoo always made my hair soft and it smells good, so I can&#x27;t say I dislike it at all.</li>
    <li> Excited to see I can get this shampoo through Amazon. I used a bottle of it and didn&#x27;t realize how good it worked until the bottle was gone, and I couldn&#x27;t find it in stores, and had to switch to something else. It doesn&#x27;t stop fall out from the root but sure did stop breakage. My hair seemed smoother using it, without product buildup.</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo. My hair naturally falls out a lot because I have a lot of hair. But, only after a few uses, I saw a major difference. I alternate my hair products as to avoid buildup, so this one is definitely on rotation.</li>
    <li> We love this product.  It cleans our hair with natural ingredients, rinses out easily, smells great and leaves hair very soft.  The price is excellent for what you get and how well it works</li>
    <li> The bottle was opened and most of the shampoo was in the bag it was shipped in.</li>
    <li> This smells great.  It works for me.  Little or no breakage.  I sometimes use it with nioxin shampoo and condition.  My hair is longer and healthier.</li>
    <li> This ended up drying out my scalp, so it might not be for everyone.  I also didn&#x27;t notice that my hair broke or fell any less.  Otherwise, it smells ok and keeps everything clean.</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t do anything for me. I usually wish my hair about every 5 days. I didn&#x27;t notice a difference. Plus, this product had leaked during shipping.</li>
    <li> Great shampoo, left my hair light and shiny.  Priced much better than my local grocery store.  Will buy again for sure.</li>
    <li> I tried the shampoo with the matching conditioner, but they didn&#x27;t work for me. I actually found more hairs wrapped around my fingers after a shower than with my old shampoo. My hair doesn&#x27;t look or feel any stronger or more \\&quot;fortified\\&quot; than before. I gave it two stars because they smell pretty good and did not leave frizziness in my hair. I also bought a set for my teenage daughter and she says her hair still falls about the same amount as with any other shampoo. We are still waiting for the miracle product that will help us retain more of our hair. We won&#x27;t be buying this product again.</li>
    <li> too artificial feeling ,like chemical city</li>
    <li> i bought this shampoo a few days ago and lets just say i am not happy the smell is horrible&lt;br /&gt;and it does not leave my hair feeling good it&#x27;s not worth buying</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a couple weeks now, and like others have said, I&#x27;m not really sure it stops the shedding. Generally I think it works about as well as any other shampoo of the same price range.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s redeeming quality, in my opinion, is the Biotin. I take Hair, Skin and Nails vitamins with biotin because my fingernails chip and break easily and are hard to grow and my hair breaks easily. Which is another reason I decided to try this shampoo. The vitamins really really make a difference with my nails but I don&#x27;t notice a huge change in my hair. Same with this shampoo. I actually haven&#x27;t been taking the vitamins for a couple weeks now and as soon as I started using this shampoo my nails started growing much faster and thicker! I like to imagine that it&#x27;s doing something for my hair too but probably not as noticeably.</li>
    <li> Definitely see a difference in the amount of hair on the floor.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. Bought both the shampoo &amp; conditioner and I have no complaints! Cleans well &amp; doesn&#x27;t leave my hair oily.</li>
    <li> I love Garnier, all my other products have been from Garnier, hair spray, mousse, hair milk, wave spray...Pretty much all I use is Garnier, so when my hair was shedding more than usual I did not hesitate to buy this line. I had several coupons and bought a few bottles. Before using the Fall Fight Line I bragged about how I use Garnier and was confident in their products that my friends and sisters also bought this line. BOY was I wrong! I have been using this line for the last 2 1/2 months and have only seen more shedding than before. I am scared to brush my hair because of how much more hair goes onto the brush.I follow the 60 second scalp messaging directions and use the Fall Fight Spray but all it does is gets my hair tangled, then I have to brush my hair, which in turn I see shedding its just a cycle with this product.&lt;br /&gt;I do not even like the smell of the shampoo or conditioner, so now I am stuck with a few bottles. I am extremely disappointed with this line, and now currently looking for a better product that actually works! If you are looking for a product that will help with shedding hair look somewhere else!</li>
    <li> I tried this product because my mother bought it because she has been recently loosing a lot of hair. My hair loss is marginal. We both have the same complaint - dryness. My hair is chemically treated and her&#x27;s is virgin. We both have long hair - about 3 inches below the bra strap.&lt;br /&gt;After using this product we both noticed that it feels like the hair cuticle has been left open and our hair texture is rough.&lt;br /&gt;Normal hair loss is approximately 50/100 strands a day depending on the cycle of your hair growth that you are in - also your general health/diet and medication you are taking so when I see reviews stating that their hair continues to shed it may just be the hair cycle they are in.&lt;br /&gt;Would I buy this product? No. My hair is usually very shiny. This product leaves it somewhat dull. I don&#x27;t know why because it does not feel like there is any residue left on my hair. We also noticed that our hair dried extremely quickly (I thought I would mention this as it really doesn&#x27;t pertain to the dryness - but it was very noticeable.)&lt;br /&gt;We both also feel that it is much harder to brush our hair due to the rough texture and it tangles much easier.&lt;br /&gt;Hope this helps :)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve really only been using this shampoo for about a week.  I had wanted to buy the garnier daily care for normal hair (I had tried it at a friend&#x27;s house and liked it) but the store I went to didn&#x27;t have it so I got this instead.  My hair is really fine and I have an oily scalp.  Although my hair is fine, I have a lot of it so in reality, I didn&#x27;t buy this shampoo for the &#x27;fall fight&#x27; factor, I was just trying to find a fairly normal shampoo.  Every shampoo out there it seems is for moisture (which I don&#x27;t need) or it&#x27;s for oily hair, which tends to just make things worse.&lt;br /&gt;After the first use, I really liked this, my hair looks less flat than before and it makes my hair soft without weighing it down.  I also have dandruffy hair, and when I checked my scalp for dandruff this morning, there was only a couple flakes.  I&#x27;m not saying this is a miracle cure for dandruff, but it has seemed to really help my hair.  It also smells nice, which isn&#x27;t really a factor when I&#x27;m buying shampoo, but it is an added bonus.</li>
    <li> This is one of Garnier&#x27;s newest products and it has an interesting concept. Fall Fight is about not loosing hair in the shower basically. Note: loosing hair can be due to your diet as well. The first week I used this along with it&#x27;s partner, Fall Fight conditioner. It kept it&#x27;s promise as far as loosing strands, I lost maybe 2 to 5 during this period. But it did nothing else for my hair. It did not give it shine or softness, though the bottle does not boast that it will. The conditioner did not really condition my hair, but with some leave-in products it worked out fine.&lt;br /&gt;I will use it until it runs out, than I will likely choose something else for my hair.</li>
    <li> I used the shampoo conditioner and  spray  for 6 weeks+  no change in hair fall, hair is  flat and lifeless as it has gradually pulled most of my curl out. Won&#x27;t be buying this again.</li>
    <li> I have very very thin hair, I thought this would be a lifesaver but honestly more of my hair is falling out and it looks A LOT thinner....I didn&#x27;t realize it could of been this shampoo I was using until my friend with thinning hair as well told me she used the same shampoo. Let&#x27;s just say it&#x27;s in then trash.</li>
    <li> Every since i use this shampoo it has helped my hair grow longer. I think its to it not falling out so much.... thanks again...</li>
    <li> This does not work at all.  It does the opposite of what it&#x27;s supposed to do.  The commercial says it&#x27;s supposed to reduce the number of hair strands you lose each day.  Instead I noticed when I used this product that I was losing way more than I normally was losing before using this product.  My hair was coming out all over the place.  Strands of hair would randomly fall out all day long when it wasn&#x27;t like that before.  Also, it made my hair feel so super dry.  It made my hair feel so rough and frizzy and look really flat.  The only reason I gave it 2 stars is because it smells really good.  I&#x27;ve always liked Garnier products in the past but I&#x27;m super disappointed with the whole Fructis Fall Fight line.  I didn&#x27;t even finish the shampoo, conditioner or spray that I bought.  I tried to give it a chance but I was afraid I was gonna lose all my hair with this thing; what a waste.  Do not buy!!!!</li>
    <li> I tried this for the first time last night. I&#x27;m not sure if it will have any effect on my hair - I have ethnic hair and wash it every other week. It did leave my hair soft though, and it smells absolutely fantastic. It reminded me of those blue gummy sharks with marshmallow bottoms.</li>
    <li> I started using the shampoo and serum about three months after my second daughter was born because I began losing a lot of hair.  After about a week of using it, I started noticing a good difference in how much hair I was losing.  Instead of clogging the shower drain in a day, it was taking several.  So I was pleased with those results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, as the weeks went on, I started noticing that the skin on my fingertips was peeling and my scalp was a little bit sore.  The soreness got progressively worse and the peeling spread from my fingertips to my palms.  It wasn&#x27;t painful - but a little bit itchy - and very unattractive.  I am an avid lotion user so I know it wasn&#x27;t just from dry skin.  It also didn&#x27;t look like dry skin.  It was similar to how your skin looks after a bad sun burn and it starts to peel off in large sections.  It looked like I was having a bad reaction to a chemical.  The only new product I had begun using was this one, so I have to assume that it was this.  Plus - I stopped using it about a week ago, and my skin has stopped peeling and is already looking much better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The side effects are not worth the effectiveness of the product for me so I won&#x27;t be purchasing this again.</li>
    <li> Works great! I have PCOS and that causes hair loss plus post partum hypothyroid. This combined with a biotin vitamin help cut my shedding hair in half if not more.</li>
    <li> This product works for me.  My hair feels healthier and stronger.  I have white/gray hair and it is fine.  This product put back the shine and helped to tame the wiry grays.  It does leave my hair flatter, but I just use a volume product to give my hair volume.</li>
    <li> Great product, I was skeptical but it seems to be working to fight the hair loss my medication causes. It was delivered in quick time and just as it was described.</li>
    <li> I have long medium fine hair.But lots of it. I&#x60;ve always gotten compliments on my hair and it truly was my crowing glory. I&#x60;m going to be 63 next month and about 6 months ago I noticed I was losing more hair then usual. My drain was clogged with it, it was thinning at the temples and when I washed it or combed it bunches would come out. I talked to my hair dresser who said that&#x60;s what happens when you get older and it was happening to her as well. I thought there must be something I can do! I saw the commercials for Fall Fight. I tried it and after a month or so&lt;br /&gt;I noticed I was losing much less hair and now I&#x60;m losing very very little. Only the normal amount everyone loses. I&#x60;m thrilled with this product and highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> For years, I had been looking for a shampoo/conditioner that would keep my hair from shedding so much. I literally used to pull out wads of hair! Since I&#x27;ve been using this, I shed WAY LESS. For the price, I think it is definitely worth it. (: The conditioner makes my hair so soft and easy to brush, which makes for less damage to my hair.</li>
    <li> Tried this shampoo and I must say my hair felt limp, brittle and lifeless. This was my first and last experience with Garnier products, although its very cheap it&#x27;s still not worth the money!!!</li>
