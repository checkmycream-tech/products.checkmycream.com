      <li>This stuff is amazing.</li>

      <li>The Dove product is amazing, my hair is soft and the curls are defined and beautiful .</li>
      <li>I love the Dove Quench shampoo and conditioner</li>
      <li>and I have to use more product to coat my hair.</li>
      <li>I slicked back my hair and hoped for the best.</li>
      <li>I also used the dove  love your curls shampoo and conditioner.</li>
      <li>but I’ve tried tons of hair products for my hair and this doesn’t work any better than dozens of others that I’ve tried.</li>
      <li>I love the smell of the product and how it dispenses out.</li>
      <li>With this line of products my hair didn&#x27;t seem to keep the curl any better.</li>
      <li>This product with the same shampoo and conditioner is excellent for ethnic hair.</li>
      <li>I would classify my hair as unruly most of the time.</li>
      <li>But love the way ot makes my hair feel</li>
      <li>I love those products, but not this creme.</li>
      <li>but I&#x27;d imagine for the targeted hair you could use it more liberally.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad I tried it, but I probably won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
      <li>I would recommend it to anyone looking for softer, more manageable hair.</li>
      <li>I love the shampoo and find in this line</li>
      <li>I love the smell and feel of it and how it works well on my hair</li>
      <li>I ordered this product for her to try because she&#x27;s tried many leave-in products with varied results.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Dove scent is okay but not my favorite.</li>
      <li>My mom said she love it and will def recommend it</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s ok, I have fine hair</li>
      <li>While I like to straighten out my waves, this still works good for straight styles too.</li>
      <li>This is a good hair product that did a decent job on my hair.</li>
      <li>That said, the serum does have a strong scent.</li>
      <li>I loved this product so much I decided to make it my first of many reviews on Amazon.</li>
      <li>Never greasy looking, and leaves my curls bouncy and smooth.</li>
      <li>It’s formulated to strengthen, smooth, and nourish</li>
      <li>At first I was a bit spectacle, but after just one use, my hair was so soft, it smelled absolutely wonderful, and my curls where very defined.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m really enjoying being able to have hair that is manageable without being high maintenance.</li>
      <li>and it’s very easy to spread just a drop or two through your whole hair.</li>
      <li>love this product so far :)</li>
      <li>makes my hair feel so soft &amp; feel so moisturized &amp; makes my curls more defined!</li>
      <li>I find I like the other formula better, but this is still good.</li>
      <li>Less creamy in texture and the fragrance is more perfume-y than clean, but it still has a good hydrating affect.</li>
      <li>Many serums for hair are much greasier, and the smell was not unpleasant.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t think it would work that great on extremely curly hair.</li>
      <li>My hair is seriously soft (I can easily run my fingers through my curls now!)</li>
      <li>I can finally wear my hair curly after MANY years of trying!</li>
      <li>me.&lt;br /&gt;It does have a particular scent that goes on strong but then dissipates quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I have VERY curly hair, and I&#x27;ve tried many products with out any help for my very curly hair, till now.</li>
      <li>I’m not crazy about the scent.</li>
      <li>Let me first say that EVERYONE&#x27;S HAIR IS DIFFERENT however, for me, I LOVE THIS PRODUCT!  </li>
      <li>Now, nothing is going to make my hair completely soft, but this has certainly made it more manageable.&lt;br</li>
      <li>but it may be too strong to some people who are sensitive to fragrance.</li>
      <li>This stuff is amazing if you have dry hair!</li>
      <li>Thanks for letting me try and review!</li>
      <li>I want to make it clear that I use this creme serum in conjunction with the Dove Advanced Series</li>
      <li>first thing she commented on was the bottle and its new-fangled pump - which she didn&#x27;t like.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a rare treat for me to find a product that can accomplish all of these things without creating a new problem</li>
      <li>I love the fact that I can apply this to my hair when it&#x27;s dry instead of</li>
      <li>Really greasy and heavy, and smells strongly like cheap perfume.</li>
      <li>really help my wavy curly hair,but not this serum.don&#x27;t bother with this item,use the shampoo&amp;cond with John Frieda dream curls mousse or Aussie curl mousse</li>
      <li>I bought this for my mom who love to curl her hair and this product did as expected.</li>
      <li>My hair is very curly, so it tends</li>
      <li>Really helps to moisturize my curls.</li>
      <li>Quench Absolute shampoo and conditioner.</li>
      <li>The whole Dove Quench line smells like that.</li>
      <li>but I use my Eco Olive Oil gel over it because the result with the serum alone is kinda &amp;#34;fluffy&amp;#34; and I don&#x27;t like that much volume.</li>
      <li>but really didn&#x27;t help my curl.</li>
      <li>Leaves hair very shiny and visibly hydrated</li>
      <li>This product moisturizes my curls and leaves my hair curly and very manageable.</li>
      <li>but of I don&#x27;t wash my hair for 2 days, it&#x27;s straight.</li>
      <li>I have tried many different products over the years since going natural and lost money on all of them.  </li>
      <li>Still, the product is easy to use and definitely made a difference despite high humidity.</li>
      <li>Over the years, the curls have relaxed into large ringlets but she still has problems with frizz, particularly in damp or humid weather.  </li>
      <li>I have long straight fine hair</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s greasy, should take care not to apply too much of it at one place and make sure a little amount is spread over evenly.</li>
      <li>On the plus side, she felt that it improved her hair&#x27;s manageability and combated the tendency toward frizz on several super humid summer days.  </li>
      <li>I highly recommend it for anyone who has curly/wavy hair</li>
      <li>This product works great on my dry and coarse, partial curl hair.</li>
      <li>It makes my hair soft and manageable, and leaves the partial curls smooth and bouncy.</li>
      <li>It is a thick white cream, lightly fragrant and goes on easily.</li>
      <li>It, along with the related shampoo and conditioner, left my hair super soft, shiny, and not at all frizzy with very well-defined curls.  </li>
      <li>It proved more difficult to control than a traditional pump top dispenser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

    <li> made my hair really sticky and heavy... Yuck!!</li>
    <li> Really helps to moisturize my curls.</li>
    <li> I have VERY curly hair, and I&#x27;ve tried many products with out any help for my very curly hair, till now. The Dove product is amazing, my hair is soft and the curls are defined and beautiful .</li>
    <li> Makes my hair really frizzy and limp, not good for my coarse curly hair.</li>
    <li> Really greasy and heavy, and smells strongly like cheap perfume.</li>
    <li> I loved this product so much I decided to make it my first of many reviews on Amazon. I am so amazed at how well this product worked. At first I was a bit spectacle, but after just one use, my hair was so soft, it smelled absolutely wonderful, and my curls where very defined. Ive been getting many compliments!!! I also used the dove  love your curls shampoo and conditioner. I will be using this product daily and I will purchase!!! Thanks for letting me try and review! #loveyourcurls #chatterbox #sponsored</li>
    <li> I have long, very dry, very coarse curly hair (a 3b/3c hybrid).  I thought this worked well in keeping the frizzies down along with using my other favorite products, Taliah Waajid Curly Curl Cream and Saryna leave in conditioner.  I was using beverly hills crazy curl, but this works just as well, smells better, and is way cheaper.  It, along with the related shampoo and conditioner, left my hair super soft, shiny, and not at all frizzy with very well-defined curls.  I just wish I could buy it in a local store...</li>
    <li> soft curls with moisture!  Great product</li>
    <li> Dove made a VERY similar product about a year ago, and then changed it to this. I find I like the other formula better, but this is still good. Less creamy in texture and the fragrance is more perfume-y than clean, but it still has a good hydrating affect.</li>
    <li> The hair is very smooth and the curl are nice</li>
    <li> Leaves my hair soft, shiny and manageable.  And you can&#x27;t beat the price!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s greasy, should take care not to apply too much of it at one place and make sure a little amount is spread over evenly.</li>
    <li> My sister has thick, curly hair.  Over the years, the curls have relaxed into large ringlets but she still has problems with frizz, particularly in damp or humid weather.  I ordered this product for her to try because she&#x27;s tried many leave-in products with varied results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first thing she commented on was the bottle and its new-fangled pump - which she didn&#x27;t like.  It proved more difficult to control than a traditional pump top dispenser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the serum itself, she had mixed feelings.  On the plus side, she felt that it improved her hair&#x27;s manageability and combated the tendency toward frizz on several super humid summer days.  She absolutely loved the fragrance and consistency, as well.  For three days, she used it alone and didn&#x27;t see an improvement in her curls and actually felt that it made her hair less curly, with more of a loose wave.  In combination with hair gel, she achieved the curly, piece-y texture she was after, but still felt the performance was inferior to her normal routine of hair gel mixed with a tiny bit of argan oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She concluded that she would be unlikely to buy this for herself.</li>
    <li> I can finally wear my hair curly after MANY years of trying! used w/the Quench Shampoo &amp; Conditioner. Love it!!</li>
    <li> This serum is great for curly hair.  You can activate curls while your hair is wet or dry.  My hair is naturally curly and so it works well for me.&lt;br /&gt;It does have a particular scent that goes on strong but then dissipates quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have bought a few of these already.</li>
    <li> It seemed to moisturize my hair a bit but really didn&#x27;t help my curl. I have waves that boarder curls, when wet they bounce right up but of I don&#x27;t wash my hair for 2 days, it&#x27;s straight. With this line of products my hair didn&#x27;t seem to keep the curl any better.</li>
    <li> This is the best product for curly hair ever made.</li>
    <li> I have long straight fine hair but I often find I am in need of a remedy for dry flyaway ends. This works quite well as a mid day fix. It is a thick white cream, lightly fragrant and goes on easily. It enables me to finish out the day without frizz. For my hair type I use very little but I&#x27;d imagine for the targeted hair you could use it more liberally.</li>
    <li> This product works great on my dry and coarse, partial curl hair. I want to make it clear that I use this creme serum in conjunction with the Dove Advanced Series Quench Absolute shampoo and conditioner. It makes my hair soft and manageable, and leaves the partial curls smooth and bouncy. It doesn&#x27;t weigh the hair down nor look greasy neither. I have applied it to my wet hair and dry hair, and also as a leave-in. It works equally well in any case. That said, the serum does have a strong scent. I like it but it may be too strong to some people who are sensitive to fragrance.</li>
    <li> love this product so far :)</li>
    <li> I have fine, somewhat frizzy curly hair and have been using the dove shampoo, conditioner and Serum for a few weeks.  I am loving it more and more the longer I use it.  My hair is seriously soft (I can easily run my fingers through my curls now!) with less frizz.  it is a relatively inexpensive hair care system that isn&#x27;t from an over priced Salon.  I would recommend it to anyone looking for softer, more manageable hair.</li>
    <li> Let me first say that EVERYONE&#x27;S HAIR IS DIFFERENT however, for me, I LOVE THIS PRODUCT!  I have tried many different products over the years since going natural and lost money on all of them.  This product moisturizes my curls and leaves my hair curly and very manageable. I&#x27;ve found it cheaper elsewhere but again, still a great product.</li>
    <li> Early this week, I was running late for work and didn&#x27;t have time to diffuse my curls much less blow out my hair. And given that it&#x27;s cut in an A-line bob--very short in the back and long in the front, I had very few options. My hair is very curly, so it tends o frizz if I&#x27;m not careful, and we&#x27;re in the 100&#x27;s this week. I had no choice though, I had to do something quick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I did was try this Supreem Creme Serum. I was hoping that it would just keep my hair tame so I could make it through the day. I even went to work with some bobby pins so that I could tame the masses. I slicked back my hair and hoped for the best. As this product is creamy rather than sticky, I wasn&#x27;t sure what kind of hold it would give me. And as I went through the day, I ran my fingers along my hair a couple of times and I could feel that it was no longer sleek. At the first chance to check the mirror, I was rather pleasantly surprised to see that although not sleek, my hair had dried into basic manageability. It had soft body and waves, but it wasn&#x27;t a mess. I even got a few compliments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t washed my hair for three days, and I haven&#x27;t reapplied any product. But my hair has kept its softness and its waves without going crazy on me. Though my hair is colored, the process started with a bleach job that left it really dry. After applying this product, though, my hair looks shiny and doesn&#x27;t feel dry or brittle. I&#x27;m really enjoying being able to have hair that is manageable without being high maintenance.</li>
    <li> Great product for curly hair</li>
    <li> Love this stuff! I have natural curly hair and this product goes on wet or dry hair. Never greasy looking, and leaves my curls bouncy and smooth.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok, I have fine hair I think it weighed down my hair. I will use it again for second chance</li>
    <li> A little goes a l-o-n-g way; be careful...</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing. I have naturally curly dry frizzy hair &amp; this stuff makes my hair feel so soft &amp; feel so moisturized &amp; makes my curls more defined! This stuff is amazing if you have dry hair! Careful to not use too much though because it can weigh your hair down. I have noticed a change in my hair health as soon as I started using this. This is a must have buy!! I reccomend this to anyone in search for a hair rescue, it will do its magic!!</li>
    <li> This may be a great product for curly hair, but the fragrance is so strong and overwhelming, I had to wash it out! I love the Dove Quench shampoo and conditioner and I&#x27;m very disappointed that I will not be able to use this product as well,</li>
    <li> I would classify my hair as unruly most of the time. I&#x27;ve tried a plethora of products and they&#x27;re always so hit or miss for me. With that said, I was quite impressed with this product. My hair is naturally wavy, easily dried out and always frizz prone. This product moisturizes my hair without making it look or feel greasy, it tames my frizz and makes my waves actually manageable. It&#x27;s a rare treat for me to find a product that can accomplish all of these things without creating a new problem (ie: weighing hair down) and I&#x27;ve found it in this product. I highly recommend it for anyone who has curly/wavy hair that&#x27;s prone to drying out. Excellent product!</li>
    <li> This product with the same shampoo and conditioner is excellent for ethnic hair. It made my hair extremely soft, conditioned, moisturized , and not greasy! I absolutely love it!</li>
    <li> This product is thicker than most curl creams, and it smells nice. However, this product makes my hair droopy/heavy/flat. My curls should be springy and light, but when using this product, they get weighed down. And yes, I did use this product in conjunction with the Dove Quench Shampoo and Conditioner for curls. I love those products, but not this creme. I&#x27;m glad I tried it, but I probably won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
    <li> Great product. I bought this for my mom who love to curl her hair and this product did as expected. My mom said she love it and will def recommend it</li>
    <li> I love it! I use it after my hair is almost dry to&lt;br /&gt;separate my curl.</li>
    <li> Received what I ordered but some of the bottles were missing lids? Kinda weird. Oh well.</li>
    <li> I have dry, coarse, wavy hair and the Dove Quench series is for curly, coarse hair. It’s made for frizz control and curl defintion. While I like to straighten out my waves, this still works good for straight styles too. It’s formulated to strengthen, smooth, and nourish dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It’s a small pump bottle. While it’s 3.3 fluid ounces, you only need a tiny bit. It’s a cream and it’s very easy to spread just a drop or two through your whole hair. I’m not crazy about the scent. It doesn’t smell bad but it doesn’t smell good either. I’m used to Dove having incredibly smelling products. This just smells like lotion. The whole Dove Quench line smells like that. I just like to add products that smell good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works good but I’ve tried tons of hair products for my hair and this doesn’t work any better than dozens of others that I’ve tried.</li>
    <li> My hair is not really curly but it is coarse. This Dove product helps keep it softer. Now, nothing is going to make my hair completely soft, but this has certainly made it more manageable.&lt;br /&gt;It is thick and can be used in wet or dry hair from the roots to the end and then you can style.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The sides of my long hair tend to stick out and this helps keep control of that loose fuzz that sticks out around my ears.&lt;br /&gt;The fragrance is not bad and add to that Dove&#x27;s usual reasonable cost in their hair products which makes this is decent hair product.</li>
    <li> Does absolutely nothing for my dry, frizzy, ultra curly hair. No better than any other &amp;#34;drug store&amp;#34; brand. And, it smells horrible!</li>
    <li> Leaves hair very shiny and visibly hydrated but I use my Eco Olive Oil gel over it because the result with the serum alone is kinda &amp;#34;fluffy&amp;#34; and I don&#x27;t like that much volume. But love the way ot makes my hair feel</li>
    <li> It seemed a little greasy and had a strong smell, but it did the trick.  Many serums for hair are much greasier, and the smell was not unpleasant.</li>
    <li> my daughter is beyond thrilled and has even done a hair tutorial on youtube!!!</li>
    <li> Just bought it today and applied to my dry 3b curly hair. (If it helps I am bi racial and have a mix of white and black in my hair) It made my hair very soft and I was very pleased! I will probably continue to use this product for my hair since it&#x27;s the only one so far that hasn&#x27;t made my hair dry out and has helped eliminate frizz. I love the fact that I can apply this to my hair when it&#x27;s dry instead of it having to be wet. I love the smell of the product and how it dispenses out. My only problem with it is I wish the bottle was a tad bit bigger because my hair is shoulder length and thick and I have to use more product to coat my hair. I would recommend this to anyone with hair like mine or someone with wavy hair. I don&#x27;t think it would work that great on extremely curly hair.</li>
    <li> I love the smell and feel of it and how it works well on my hair</li>
    <li> I love the shampoo and find in this line really help my wavy curly hair,but not this serum.don&#x27;t bother with this item,use the shampoo&amp;cond with John Frieda dream curls mousse or Aussie curl mousse and u get great results.</li>
    <li> Does everything they said it would.</li>
    <li> It makes my hair soft but doesn&#x27;t do anything for my scalp.</li>
    <li> This is a good hair product that did a decent job on my hair. I needed very little product to get the desired effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Dove scent is okay but not my favorite. Still, the product is easy to use and definitely made a difference despite high humidity. There was no clumping, and it made my hair easier to control.</li>
