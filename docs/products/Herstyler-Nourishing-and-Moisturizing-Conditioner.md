      <li>but i guess this is prep for when my next delivery comes! :D</li>
      <li>this conditioner is perfect for those who use flat irons.  </li>
      <li>I can see how some would say it is too strong, but I love it.</li>
      <li>My hair looks better using cheap shampoo and conditioners than these products.  </li>
      <li>My brush stays nearly empty, my hair has the healthiest shine that it&#x27;s ever had, and it smells great!  </li>
      <li>I have really fine hair</li>
      <li>so I could give it an accurate review</li>
      <li>I figured it would be a bit of a stretch buying this conditioner as it was so cheap and</li>
      <li>I originally was looking for the serum then ran into the shampoo and conditioner</li>
      <li>This stuff is amazing, makes my hair shiny and smooth, would love if I could buy it in bigger packages</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s absolutely incredible; it smells like perfume, but not an overwhelmingly strong one, it makes my wavy and frizzy hair very soft especially after I use a straightener on it, and it&#x27;s a fantastic bargain to get it on this site.</li>
      <li>I purchased the Herstyler shampoo, conditioner, and hair mask after I used my sister&#x27;s Herstyler shampoo and hair mask which she paid FULL PRICE.  </li>
      <li>It leaves hair nice and soft.</li>
      <li>and this really keeps my hair shiny and healthy looking.  </li>
      <li>The product gave me good results at first, but as the HOURS passed by, the product dried my hair out more and more by the minute.</li>
      <li>As far as a conditioner goes I liked this one and have used it a couple of times.</li>
      <li>Yes, it has a strong fragrance scent at first, but after a while, it becomes smelly, smells like some chemical things (like cement powder).   </li>
      <li>I have spent alot more money on specialty treatments that were ok</li>
      <li>It smells great, makes your hair very soft and protects it from heat damage when using a straightener, I&#x27;ve really noticed a difference in how long my hair looks clean and shiny after straightening it when I use this.</li>
      <li>I have very fine fragile hair.  </li>
      <li>it does smell a lot like perfume but kind of like a perfume - I would prefer it to have a lighter or fresher scent, but this is ok, at least it doesnt smell bad.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
      <li>My beautitian is always amazed at what good condition my hair is in even though I use a blowdryer and flat iron frequently.</li>
      <li>little known product was first introduced to me through a really talented salesman at the mall.</li>
      <li>i bought this product in hair salon first and then online.i use it constantly,the result is like using salon product, sleak, shiny,smooth hair.recommend it.</li>
      <li>I love this conditioner I just wished they made it in larger bottles because it makes you hair sooooo silky</li>
      <li>It makes the hair soft and smooth.</li>
      <li>I had completely given up and considered myself lucky when I wasn&#x27;t losing hair by the handfuls.&lt;br /&gt;This  </li>
      <li>In fact it seemed to have made it more dry.</li>
      <li>I obtain my first bottle free when I purchased a flat iron at the mall.</li>
      <li>Also, the price was very competitive.</li>
      <li>This conditioner did absolutely nothing for my hair.</li>
      <li>My hair feels very silky(did</li>
      <li>and it was much softer after.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> For the price, these products  #1  are NOT very concentrated.  You have to use a lot of it, and  #2 the results are not very satisfactory.  My hair looks better using cheap shampoo and conditioners than these products.  I do not recommend them.  Save your money.  I don&#x27;t mind spending the money for superior cosmetic products &amp; skin care &amp; hair care,  BUT i expect superior results AND I expect that the product is not diluted down.  Don&#x27;t sell me a tiny little container for top dollar and then i have to use half of it for one shampoo.</li>
    <li> I started using this a couple months after i damaged by hair by using bleach and it WORKS! it makes my hair sooo silky even after straightening it and it smells AMAZING!! :) I would also recommend using the deep conditioner with it though especially for very damaged hair because it is intensive moisture therapy and really is miraculous!</li>
    <li> I bought this from Amazon  based on the reviews.  However, I am disappointed with it. Unlike other reviews have said,it smells bad. Yes, it has a strong fragrance scent at first, but after a while, it becomes smelly, smells like some chemical things (like cement powder).   I tried to confirm this by putting some of it on my hand before I write this review, still bad smell.   Maybe it is expired? Mine has a label on the cover saying \\&quot;made in China\\&quot;, and PROD 01/25/10.</li>
    <li> I like this conditioner (and the shampoo) a lot.  I have extremley tangly hair, medium long, and this does a pretty good job of detangling, though not perfect.  I would recommend this conditioner (and the shampoo). It smells great, too!</li>
    <li> I love the condictioner as it is wonderful for my hair.  Leaves it soft and managable.  Works well for me.</li>
    <li> I have ordered this product twice.  The 1st time it came, it was great- the 2nd time, not great.  I am thinking that the second time I ordered it that it came from another vendor that is not legit.  The 2nd time the product had a terrible smell -like something was added to it, or it turned and went bad.  I ended up throwing away more than half of the product.  Be careful when buying this, as you may not be satified :(</li>
    <li> this conditioner is perfect for those who use flat irons.  it prepares the hair for it.  i noticed that when i use this product the flat iron just glides through my hair like silk.  it makes the job faster too.  it&#x27;s very moisturizing and makes my hair a lot less frizzy.  i have very thick long hair.  hope this helped.</li>
    <li> Smells incredible, a lot like perfume. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s the ultimate hydrating experience. But, would I buy it again? Definitely.  I am Trinidadian so I am mixed with and medium texture but strictly curly hair. My hair needs a lot of moisture so for me to be impressed it takes quite a bit. I definitely recommend for the spiral sisters across the rainbow.</li>
    <li> This shampoo made my hair feel brittle. I have thick hair and after using just the shampoo then drying it so I could give it an accurate review --my hair felt dried out, especially on the ends. Using the conditioner other times also didnt help. I guess the ingredients just arent meshing with my hair. Not a fan of either shamp or cond.</li>
    <li> It smells great, makes your hair very soft and protects it from heat damage when using a straightener, I&#x27;ve really noticed a difference in how long my hair looks clean and shiny after straightening it when I use this. You only have to use a dime size amount which makes it last a long time.</li>
    <li> I originally was looking for the serum then ran into the shampoo and conditioner and I really love them all!  I have really fine hair and this really keeps my hair shiny and healthy looking.  I for sure will recommend this to my friends.</li>
    <li> As far as a conditioner goes I liked this one and have used it a couple of times. I would recommend it. My hair seemed to take to it well and it was much softer after.</li>
    <li> This conditioner did absolutely nothing for my hair. In fact it seemed to have made it more dry. I figured it would be a bit of a stretch buying this conditioner as it was so cheap and the because of the brand but I figured I would try it anyway. I would definitely not recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> I love the conditioner because it makes my hair soft and not so much tangles since I have long hair. My oldest daughter who is 5 years old loves it in her hair because she has long hair and tangles she uses it and loves how it feels after her shower/bath. It makes the hair soft and smooth.</li>
    <li> Really a great product and an amazing deal.</li>
    <li> I purchased the Herstyler shampoo, conditioner, and hair mask after I used my sister&#x27;s Herstyler shampoo and hair mask which she paid FULL PRICE.  I am an African American female with THICK and long natural hair and the Herstyler products leave my hair soft, shiny, and moisturized!  I am really impressed by the products and the smell is magnificent!!!  I have gotten sooooooo many compliments on the look, smell, and healthiness of my hair.  I am now a true fan!!!</li>
    <li> I keep reordering this product since I love the way my hair feels and handles when I use it.</li>
    <li> At Amazon.com  I like Herstyler Nourishing and Moisturizing Shampoo and Conditioner.  I use every other day. (I wish that I use it every day).&lt;br /&gt;~(&lt;^..^&gt;)</li>
    <li> I have thick wavy hair and this conditioner does not work. It doesn&#x27;t even have a good smell. I would compare it to other not good conditioners like Breck.</li>
    <li> Leaves hair soft and manageable. Purchased four to share with family and friends.  Everyone loves it.  Price is good too.</li>
    <li> This conditioner is amazing. My mom &amp; myself only use this type of conditioner. I obtain my first bottle free when I purchased a flat iron at the mall. Once it finished I went back to purchase another bottle. $25 for this conditioner. Hence why I&#x27;m so happy with my amazon purchase of the same product for a dam good bargain!</li>
    <li> Really good conditioner. I used it for 2-3 years before switching to a cleansing conditioner. I think my hair got too used to this and weighted down.</li>
    <li> Love it.  Works great for detangling my usually very tangly hair.  Would definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I love this conditioner I just wished they made it in larger bottles because it makes you hair sooooo silky</li>
    <li> Okay, now I think this conditioner is very good.  It give my hair this very soft feeling after rinsing out.  This was also a recommended product to have with the flat iron.  I use the shampoo and conditioner together and my hair feels great after use.  I would recommend this and the shampoo to anyone.</li>
    <li> Love this product. It works really well when you straighten your hair everyday and it smells fabulous!</li>
    <li> I have straight, color treated long hair (almost to my butt)&lt;br /&gt;and I HAVE to use conditioner or I will not be able to get a brush or comb through it, actually I have to use the thicker conditioners.&lt;br /&gt;I decided to try this and it works great- The smell of it is ok- it does smell a lot like perfume but kind of like a perfume - I would prefer it to have a lighter or fresher scent, but this is ok, at least it doesnt smell bad.&lt;br /&gt;But the conditioner over all made it easy to brush my hair and made my hair look healthier and added a fragrance!</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing, makes my hair shiny and smooth, would love if I could buy it in bigger packages</li>
    <li> I love the Her Styler products! They work great and make your soft and they smell incredible. Would love to have a body soap in this scent as well. lol :)</li>
    <li> I have short, color treated hair.  I am a hair product junkie, always looking for something better. I have spent alot more money on specialty treatments that were ok but this stuff is really wonderful!  My hair feels very silky(did I just say that???) Manageable, and best of all, every time I walk by someone they ask what scent I am wearing.  Very Nice!  Will definitely buy again!</li>
    <li> I am very happy with the conditioner, it leaves my hair looking replenished and healthy.  Also, the price was very competitive.</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo and conditioner,  it leaves hair feeling soft and manageable.  and smells great and a great price.&lt;br /&gt;HIGHLY recommended</li>
    <li> I have fine, thin hair that dries out easily.  This product makes my hair look and feel great!  That&#x27;s a miracle!</li>
    <li> does not work as well as the ones sld at the mall, it is made in a china and you can tell....</li>
    <li> Instead of getting 2 conditioners I got two shampoos... Also, the seal on the top of both bottles had a large hole in them, which made it difficult to squeeze the bottle without shampoo flying out both ends.&lt;br /&gt;The shampoo was nice quality, but I wanted conditioner..</li>
    <li> i ordered the double pack and it came within three days. :) i used it and it made my hair very happy and healthy looking. i&#x27;m still waiting on the straightener and serum but i guess this is prep for when my next delivery comes! :D hopefully my hair will be looking fabulous before july 4th! X)</li>
    <li> I have very fine fragile hair.  I have asked doctors, nurses, hairdressers, and nutritionists for ideas and products and nothing helped.  I had completely given up and considered myself lucky when I wasn&#x27;t losing hair by the handfuls.&lt;br /&gt;This  little known product was first introduced to me through a really talented salesman at the mall. I&#x27;ve never been so happy to have been sucked into a sales pitch.  My brush stays nearly empty, my hair has the healthiest shine that it&#x27;s ever had, and it smells great!  This is the best conditioner for my hair I&#x27;ve ever found, and I have absolutely no intention of trying anything else, ever again.</li>
    <li> The product gave me good results at first, but as the HOURS passed by, the product dried my hair out more and more by the minute. By the next morning, it was like broomstraw. I would not recommend this to a friend, or an enemy either for that matter.</li>
    <li> Have bought before &amp; it is GREAT...smells wonderful &amp; the smell stays in your hair after rinsing. Soft &amp; silky results even on bi-racial, kinky hair.</li>
    <li> Horrible, Couldn&#x27;t even re-sell the one tube I did not use. Tossed it out.</li>
    <li> Great price. Smells great. I can see how some would say it is too strong, but I love it. People will comment on the smell and believe me it is always good comments</li>
    <li> I have shoulder length hair.  This conditioner makes my hair feel like silk and smells sooooo good!</li>
    <li> NOt happy about receiving only 1 bottle when it was supposed to be a Pack of 2.  I tried contacting someone about this but can&#x27;t find any place to do that so I am leaving a feed back.</li>
    <li> i bought this product in hair salon first and then online.i use it constantly,the result is like using salon product, sleak, shiny,smooth hair.recommend it.</li>
    <li> Awesome. Love it smells great don&#x27;t need a lot of conditioner for ur hair. It leaves hair nice and soft. And smelling great.</li>
    <li> Although I like the product I received (1) conditioner rather than the two I ordered.  To return it, would mean that i would need to repurchase it rather than having it replaced for what I purchased.</li>
    <li> I have never written a review on amazon, but this conditioner is special enough that I felt the need to. It&#x27;s absolutely incredible; it smells like perfume, but not an overwhelmingly strong one, it makes my wavy and frizzy hair very soft especially after I use a straightener on it, and it&#x27;s a fantastic bargain to get it on this site. I originally got some at a mall and way overpaid for it, or at least I thought so until I took it home and tried it. The serum and shampoo are equally wonderful, if you end up being a fan of the scent.</li>
    <li> I Love this stuff!!! it makes your hair smell so good....also gives lots of body so good for fine/thin hair</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this and how it makes my hair feel I love my herstyler a lot I would buy another.</li>
    <li> Love this product.  The scent is amazing!</li>
    <li> Best flatiron I ever bought I&#x27;m glad I bought this one it works great I almost bought the other one that was 399.00 I&#x27;m so glad I didn&#x27;t and tried this one this one works magic!</li>
    <li> The best conditioner I have ever used. I have thick, coarse hair and this makes it soft and sleek. My beautitian is always amazed at what good condition my hair is in even though I use a blowdryer and flat iron frequently. The price from Amazone is a rael plus as well.</li>
    <li> I Love this product it is absolutely the Best I&#x27;ve ever used.  I makes my hair look amazing! HerStyler Hair Care Products....Shampoo &amp; Conditioner....I hope this Company NEVER DISCONTINUES THIS PRODUCT!</li>
    <li> I love this product. I have went to other products over the last few years but continue going back to this one.</li>
