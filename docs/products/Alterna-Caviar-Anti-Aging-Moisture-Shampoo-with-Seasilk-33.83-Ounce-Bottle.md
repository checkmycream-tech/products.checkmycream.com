      <li>I LOVE Alterna Cavier Shampoo and Conditioner!  </li>
      <li>This shampoo is amazing, this price is a bargain and it lasts for years.</li>
      <li>I bought it after trying a sample and loving the results.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know if it has some kind of expanding technology or something, but it takes a while and some scalp-massaging to get it to bubble up.  </li>
      <li>Alterna Caviar smells wonderful and is very luxurious in texture.</li>
      <li>It will give you incredibly baby soft hair without sacrificing a clean/polished look.</li>
      <li>I love it and use it all the time.   </li>
      <li>Love this and would recommed it to anyone.</li>
      <li>I love this shampoo.</li>
      <li>Great shampoo, lathers really well.  </li>
      <li>I have been using the product for almost a month now, at first I really liked the product, however now I don&#x27;t care for it AT ALL!</li>
      <li>I have so many split ends</li>
      <li>The shipping was very out standing!!!!</li>
      <li>It lathers nicely and rinses quickly.  </li>
      <li>Most importantly, it makes your hair smell and look out of this world...</li>
      <li>So the day I shampoo it actually looks good!  </li>
      <li>The company ships very quickly</li>
      <li>This shampoo gets my hair clean, it feels and smells great, but it doesn&#x27;t completely strip it.  </li>
      <li>Smells great and leaves my hair super soft!</li>
      <li>It keeps hair smooth without being oily.</li>
      <li>Well something else was Sebastian, Pureology (including NanoWorks), Body Shop, Enjoy, Redken and etc..</li>
      <li>I use the conditioner too, and it is absolutely fantastic.  </li>
      <li>You never know if a product (no matter how many rave reviews) is right for you.      </li>
      <li>I noticed right away how healthy my hair felt.</li>
      <li>Unlike most shampoos, it is highly concentrated so the bottle is mostly product not water.</li>
      <li>Both products are so worth the money!</li>
      <li>Amazing shampoo, I didnt know a shampoo could makes one&#x27;s hair feel so soft, but gooooodness Alterna nailed it.</li>
      <li>my hair held up so much better and was much healthier.</li>
      <li>Shu Uemura is a bit pricey (around $40 for just the shampoo) but is completely worth the price.</li>
      <li>Hair feels soft and healthy.</li>
      <li>I find that this shampoo is gentle and doesn&#x27;t strip out my color, but still gets my hair clean.  </li>
      <li>and I always get exactly what I order.</li>
      <li>Oh wow!!!!</li>
      <li>I have tried so many different shampoos and conditioners, and I really thought my hair was beyond help.  </li>
      <li>I just use some dry shampoo and its good, so 4 stars for greasys the next day</li>
      <li>You can use a very small amount and it&#x27;ll create a really good lather, but you have to be willing to wait and do a lot of working in.  </li>
      <li>Really dissapointed based off of the reviews I really thought this would work.</li>
      <li>I have color treated hair and these products are the only ones that make my hair soft and healthy.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s thick and smells really good.  </li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re looking for a quality shampoo for oily hair, I highly recommend Shu Uemura Moisture Velvet Nourishing Shampoo.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend.</li>
      <li>Didn&#x27;t really think anything of it until I decided to purchase Alterna, after first use my comb glided right threw wet hair.  </li>
      <li>Same big bottle, same product and came with a nice pump.</li>
      <li>Other sulfate-free shampoos I&#x27;ve tried left me with hair that didn&#x27;t feel clean, just kind of waxy and heavy.  </li>
      <li>I used to use keratase religiously but started using pantene pro-v because there is better things I can spend my money on other than SHAMPOO.  </li>
      <li>When you think about what many women spend on skin products that don&#x27;t last very long, these liters last forever and don&#x27;t have a high fee per use.  </li>
      <li>Just after the first wash my hair felt immediately much smoother and really silky, with very little flyaways.</li>
      <li>What makes it wonderful for normal or dry hair, is disastrous for oily hair because there seems to be a hint of conditioner in the formula.  </li>
      <li>It actually looks better the next day when the oils have built up a little bit</li>
      <li>A little pricey but worth every penny.</li>

<li> You only need to use a tiny bit and it goes on a long way.</li>
<li> I deducted one star for the price, but I buy it in the liter sizes and it only takes 2 pumps to wash my long hair so the liter lasts a while.</li>
<li> If you are a flat iron user or use a lot of products on your hair I do not recommend this, I know flat irons ruin your hair</li>

<li> hair, this is one of the only products out there that does not weight down my hair.  </li>
<li> I noticed my hair was like straw after getting out of the shower and very dry, frazzle after blow drying.  </li>
<li> it is out of control -- a giant frizzy mess.  </li>
<li> it can be expensive, but its well worth it.</li>
<li> It is expensive, but you don&#x27;t have to use very much at a time.  </li>

    <li> I color my hair regularly and it was feeling dry and damaged.  I noticed right away how healthy my hair felt.</li>
    <li> A little pricey but worth every penny. If you can afford it your hair will than you for it!</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo. It&#x27;s concentrated so it lasts a long time for my thick hair. It keeps hair smooth without being oily. Great product.</li>
    <li> My wife keeps trying to find an alternative to Alterna. Every other product leaves her hair feeling coated.</li>
    <li> I believe this used to be called Anti-Aging Shampoo, but I have very thin hair and it gives me a little volume.</li>
    <li> Oh wow!!!! Yes, this shampoo is expensive but who cares?? You only need to use a tiny bit and it goes on a long way. Unlike most shampoos, it is highly concentrated so the bottle is mostly product not water. Alterna Caviar smells wonderful and is very luxurious in texture. Most importantly, it makes your hair smell and look out of this world...Best shampoo on earth!!!!</li>
    <li> I have wavy, colored, blond damaged hair.    I used this shampoo for quite a while in the past when for some reason I decided I wanted to try something else. Well something else was Sebastian, Pureology (including NanoWorks), Body Shop, Enjoy, Redken and etc.. Until two years later, a month ago, I decided to buy Alterna again. Honestly, I don&#x27;t even know why I ever stopped using it, because none of the shampoos can even compare to it! Just after the first wash my hair felt immediately much smoother and really silky, with very little flyaways. I just blow-dried it as usual and didn&#x27;t even need to use hair straightener because my hair was already straight! I don&#x27;t think I will ever try anything else!</li>
    <li> This shampoo is too moisturizing for oily hair. What makes it wonderful for normal or dry hair, is disastrous for oily hair because there seems to be a hint of conditioner in the formula.  Even without using conditioner, this shampoo leaves traces of residue in your hair so you&#x27;re left looking dirty and weighed down.        Do yourself a favor and buy the smaller size to try before investing in the big bottle.  You never know if a product (no matter how many rave reviews) is right for you.      PS. If you&#x27;re looking for a quality shampoo for oily hair, I highly recommend Shu Uemura Moisture Velvet Nourishing Shampoo. It delivers what Alterna doesn&#x27;t.  Shu Uemura is a bit pricey (around $40 for just the shampoo) but is completely worth the price. It will give you incredibly baby soft hair without sacrificing a clean/polished look.</li>
    <li> I have been using the product for almost a month now, at first I really liked the product, however now I don&#x27;t care for it AT ALL! I have so many split ends now it&#x27;s just sad! I&#x27;ve switched back to using Bumble &amp; Bumble, &amp; Pureology with the hopes of getting my hair somewhat back to what it use to be. If you are a flat iron user or use a lot of products on your hair I do not recommend this, I know flat irons ruin your hair but I&#x27;ve found with Bumble &amp; Bumble my hair held up so much better and was much healthier. Really dissapointed based off of the reviews I really thought this would work.</li>
    <li> I started using this shampoo paired with the matching conditioner about six months ago.  I bought it after trying a sample and loving the results.  I have thick, curly, oily, dyed hair that I blow dry and flat-iron often.  I find that this shampoo is gentle and doesn&#x27;t strip out my color, but still gets my hair clean.  It lathers nicely and rinses quickly.  It has a botanical scent, but it is very faint after my hair has dried.  I deducted one star for the price, but I buy it in the liter sizes and it only takes 2 pumps to wash my long hair so the liter lasts a while.</li>
    <li> This is the best shampoo and conditioner for me.  I have color treated hair and these products are the only ones that make my hair soft and healthy.  Will not be without it!!!!</li>
    <li> I am so happy to have purchased this product. I love it and use it all the time.   The shipping was very out standing!!!! It didn&#x27;t take no time for me to get it, thank you again!!!!!</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t get enough of this line! it can be expensive, but its well worth it. Smells great and leaves my hair super soft!</li>
    <li> I was using a sulphate free (expensive shampoo) as I have a Brazilian Treatment on my hair and I was thinking it needed re-doing.  Used this shampoo and it has not only rejuvinated my hair - it has rejuvinated the Brazilian Treatment too.  Great shampoo, lathers really well.  Best I&#x27;ve used.</li>
    <li> This stuff is really expensive in salons and beauty supply stores; can be found more reasonably-priced on Amazon.  It&#x27;s thick and smells really good.  It lathers well compared to Pureology Hydrate, which is my other shampoo.  You can use a very small amount and it&#x27;ll create a really good lather, but you have to be willing to wait and do a lot of working in.  I don&#x27;t know if it has some kind of expanding technology or something, but it takes a while and some scalp-massaging to get it to bubble up.  When it does, though, look out.  It&#x27;s really thick.</li>
    <li> I have dry, frizzy, wavy hair.  I have tried so many different shampoos and conditioners, and I really thought my hair was beyond help.  This shampoo is amazing, and I hope I never have to use another shampoo!  Usually the day I wash my hair it is out of control -- a giant frizzy mess.  It actually looks better the next day when the oils have built up a little bit and it&#x27;s all calmed down.  This shampoo gets my hair clean, it feels and smells great, but it doesn&#x27;t completely strip it.  So the day I shampoo it actually looks good!  Other sulfate-free shampoos I&#x27;ve tried left me with hair that didn&#x27;t feel clean, just kind of waxy and heavy.  This doesn&#x27;t do that at all.  It is expensive, but you don&#x27;t have to use very much at a time.  When you think about what many women spend on skin products that don&#x27;t last very long, these liters last forever and don&#x27;t have a high fee per use.  I use the conditioner too, and it is absolutely fantastic.  Both products are so worth the money!</li>
    <li> I LOVE Alterna Cavier Shampoo and Conditioner!  I have really long thick  hair, this is one of the only products out there that does not weight down my hair.  I get tangles at the nape of the neck with other products, not with this one.  Smells great and gives a great shine.       The shipper was awesome.  Received both shampoo and conditioner in a timely manner.</li>
    <li> Amazing shampoo, I didnt know a shampoo could makes one&#x27;s hair feel so soft, but gooooodness Alterna nailed it. This shampoo is amazing, this price is a bargain and it lasts for years.</li>
    <li> This shampoo is wonderful, and the price is about 1/2 of what I&#x27;d pay in a salon. Same big bottle, same product and came with a nice pump. Love this and would recommed it to anyone. Hair feels soft and healthy.</li>
    <li> Great product and excellent service. The company ships very quickly and I always get exactly what I order. Highly recommend.</li>

I used to use keratase religiously but started using pantene pro-v because there is better things I can spend my money on other than SHAMPOO.  I noticed my hair was like straw after getting out of the shower and very dry, frazzle after blow drying.  Didn&#x27;t really think anything of it until I decided to purchase Alterna, after first use my comb glided right threw wet hair.  My hair is shiner and lays flater.  I usually only wash my hair twice a week and noticed with this shampoo the next day after washing its greasy.  I just use some dry shampoo and its good, so 4 stars for greasys the next day</li>
