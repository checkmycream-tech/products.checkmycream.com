      <li>Thanks!</li>
      <li>Exactly as described.</li>
      <li>Very helpful and useful.</li>

      <li>The brush is what I really wanted because color comes out even, no cheetah dots.</li>
      <li>so I don&#x27;t gunk up my brush before I&#x27;m ready to use it.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> The cap is really small! More for a child sized head, than an adult</li>
    <li> I ordered this on a whim when I decided to dye my hair purple. I basically just needed a pair of gloves and this was the cheapest option, but I decided to try the brush since I had it. I usually just put the dye in my hand and rub it into my hair, but after using a brush I&#x27;m never going back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t use the cap, but I did use the &amp;#34;shampoo cape&amp;#34;. It is basically garbage bag material and has two adhesive strips to keep it around you. I found it a bit awkward, but I usually just wear an old tee and let the dye get all over the place. The cape kind of got in my way. I will say the wind catches it quite nicely and it is excellent for pretending you are Batman.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the price, it&#x27;s not a bad little kit. I would order it again.</li>
    <li> I had and still have no idea how to use the given shower cap. But everything works fine elsewise. (:</li>
    <li> shipped on time. worked great</li>
    <li> The product came as expected in good time. The packaging was excellent with no damage. The product works as expected.</li>
    <li> This is a great buy. I used the spatula to mix my relaxer and I used the color brush to apply the relaxer to my hair. I wish the color brush was longer thou.</li>
    <li> it was perfect. the purchase was on time I did not have any complaint about that. I will recommend this website</li>
    <li> great for the price, its got cool stuff for the highlights or frosting and its cheap too! It is a great deal</li>
    <li> Really good.  The cape lasts a very long time.</li>
    <li> If you color your hair at home, I recommend this very inexpensive coloring kit. Extra gloves, ear to ankle DISPOSABLE CAPE TO CATCH DRIPS, brush for root coverage, and if by any chance you highlight your hair, you are even more set. It comes with a pro quality highlight cap with the highlight pick and paddle. I have bought SO many of these (no shame here, I don&#x27;t look good in gray...) and am always GRATEFUL I had it for each hair coloring at home. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.</li>
    <li> Nice little kit for the price.  Cap was a little small for my giant head.</li>
    <li> This is a really really useful kit. I used it to apply henna on my hair and it turned out so neat :)I loved the long dark cape and cap. The brush could have been with a longer stick but still is is good.. A must buy!!!</li>
    <li> I do hight lights. the cap is a little small than expected so I got a new one. But I it does the job for emergencies.</li>
    <li> Everything worked great - just what I needed to re-dye my hair. Cap is really good quality for a disposable.</li>
    <li> Loved the tools that came with this products- however, the cap is a joke. It wouldn&#x27;t come close to fitting my head- however, it fit my 4 year olds head perfectly! (she wanted to wear it and run around the house). Everything else in this kit worked well- I used it to apply henna to my hair and was satisfied with the results- was able to wash the tools to use again in the future!</li>
    <li> Everything you need to dye your hair. Came with a shall and gloves wtich i dint know when i bought it. A good price.</li>
    <li> Handy kit for coloring hair!</li>
    <li> Cheap disposable materials for coloring or highlighting at home. Most things in this kit can&#x27;t really be used again. Not bad for 1 time use.</li>
    <li> It worked great, just like I wanted it to.  So much better than the flimsey things you get with the boxes of hair coloring.</li>
    <li> Cheap, did what I needed it to do, what else? Oh, the head cap is actually really nice. I just rinsed mine off in the shower and saved it for future use because it&#x27;s not one of those flimsy rip after one use ones. I like that it also comes with a separate mixing tool as well so I don&#x27;t gunk up my brush before I&#x27;m ready to use it.</li>
    <li> this product worked great. Highlights came out amazing. easy to use. it comes with so many things to help you.</li>
    <li> Handle of brush too short...</li>
    <li> Convenient package for do it yourself hair coloring.  Everything you need!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s only good for one use. You cannot use it again and it&#x27;s just a waste of money. Don&#x27;t bother.</li>
    <li> this is my second time buying it, useful and high quality. but it would be better if there were 2 pair of gloves.</li>
    <li> I wish I never buy this cap it just piece of s***  stuck on ur hair and  bad results</li>
    <li> And this is a frosting cap. comes with an apron and brush and gloves too. So again, this is a frosting cap, not a shower cap type.</li>
    <li> Great useful purchase.  Brushes much easier to apply haircolor on roots,  Glad I made this purchase.  Very helpful and useful.</li>
    <li> Exactly as pictured and described!</li>
    <li> Nice set. Professional grade.</li>
    <li> I used this kit before and I really love it. You can get salon results at home and this product is priced so cheap!!</li>
    <li> Nice kit for little money. Has everything you need to color your own hair. Stows nicely in its bag too with extra room for a couple of my own items!</li>
    <li> I was not impressed with the cape at all, which I wasn&#x27;t expecting to be for the price. However, it seems like they would have been better off leaving it out of the kit. The entire sticky part wanted to come off and then it wouldn&#x27;t even stay and kept falling off so I ended up tossing it. I typically wear an old shirt (I have designated shirts for when I do my hair) so I don&#x27;t worry about getting it on me anyways, so this didn&#x27;t really bother me either way. Great overall!</li>
    <li> My daughter (who changes her hair color every week) was very happy with this gift. Gave it as a Christmas gift-stocking stuffer.</li>
    <li> This product work very good for highlighting my hair tips of my hair...</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t beat the price, but the quality is a little cheap</li>
    <li> I got this for a one time use for coloring my hair and it was exactly what I expected.  The brush worked great and everything did the job it was supposed to.  Id did make one change, rather than use the cape as a cape, I wrapped it around my head while the dye set and used it with my hair dryer to add heat.  It was great for that.  :-)</li>
    <li> Came with everything I needed to dye my hair.  only thing is the gloves are a little thin. but I would definatly buy agian</li>
    <li> This kit has several ite,s included and is worth the money because it is inexpensive. Don&#x27;t expect it to be professional quality but it works.</li>
    <li> Nothing fancy but it does the job. I would recommend to a  friend and buy again if need be in the future!</li>
    <li> Nice kit to go with a first time Henna user. I was glad I got it.</li>
    <li> I found it useful for mixing and applying color. The cap is a little funny and small but for the price...it&#x27;s worth it!</li>
    <li> Kit has been helpful no complaints, makes hair dyeing easier at home without having to worry about buying the type with the cap included, saving me $ in the long run.</li>
    <li> Works for what it is but i would have preferred a good hook ..you get what you pay for i guess</li>
    <li> Everything u need all in this kit .</li>
    <li> I loved everything in this set except for the cap itself. I have very curly hair and I had to straighten my hair before using the cap. Once my time was up taking the cap off was a hassle!</li>
    <li> I purchased this item for the highlighter cap, to add some dimension to my one-tone blonde hair color. It took a really long time to get all the hair through the holes (like 2 hours), and it was very difficult to get my hair through all the holes in the back. I would recommend a buddy to help you out in case your arms get tired, and so you don&#x27;t have to juggle three mirrors to make sure you got it all. The time consuming part, however, is at no fault of the manufacturer. That is just how these things work. The little hook provided is very handy to get hair through. I did not end up using the gloves or the tinting brush since my box dye already provided gloves, but I did use the nice little cape provided. Although it is disposable, I will use it a few more times I think. The results I got using this cap were great! The spacing between the highlights makes for a very blended, subtle and natural look. I was very surprised (you may expect a freak show result after looking the in the mirror with all your hair pulled through the holes! Not glamorous!). I would definitely recommend this to someone who is scared to do their own highlights at home. Though it takes a lot of time, you save a lot of money vs going to the salon for a good result!&lt;br /&gt;(I highlighted with Garnier&#x27;s \\&quot;111 Extra-Light Ash Blonde\\&quot; color over the top of Garnier&#x27;s \\&quot;93 Light Golden Blonde Honey Butter.\\&quot;)</li>
    <li> Came fast and exactly as described. Smock is large and the so is the brush. I didn&#x27;t use the cap yet, but the gloves are nice gloves for the price.</li>
    <li> Will use as a new showercap in my RV shower!</li>
    <li> This kit is really good. It has helped me keep color off of my clothes. It came with everything I needed for my hair coloring. :). I recommend this.</li>
    <li> I got this to apply color streaks to my daughters hair.  The brush is good quality, but too wide to fit into the jar of hair color we have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cap is decent quality, but we quickly abandoned it as my daughter would never sit still long enough to actually put a decent # of hairs through.</li>
    <li> I was surprised by seeing so many things in a small packet and for this price. Its totally worth it.</li>
    <li> Used this on my long hair and worked great!  It&#x27;s quite tedius though having to pull each strand of hair through the cap, however saves me lots of money that I would have otherwise spent at a salon.</li>
    <li> I guess this would do if you were in a pinch and have short hair.  My hair is longer and this was a nightmare to try to use.  The brush in incredibly short and flimsy, the gloves are cheap cheap cheap, and there is no hook for the cap (guess I should have caught that one).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m disappointed in the product and it really was pretty much trash out of the package.</li>
    <li> Good price but I don&#x27;t need the cape and the hair net fell apart as soon as I opened it</li>
    <li> Chose this to put highlights in my hair, this kit has everything you need except the color. I loved it and it was totally worth the $2.50 I paid!!</li>
    <li> The brush is what I really wanted because color comes out even, no cheetah dots. I use the cap every time I color now too, it keeps the hair out of my face and keeps the color even too., should have got two because my roommate took the brush and hair separator</li>
    <li> Saddest little packet with really really really cheap items inside. Bought it mostly for the brush, but it is so cheap I don&#x27;t think it will even work. Well the price was really low…</li>
    <li> The product was ok I thought the brush would be better than what it was. I would probably get it again</li>
    <li> Its all nice and arrive on time but the tint brush had broken, bent, and burned (yes BURNED) bristles.</li>
    <li> i mean it does what its suppose to be for. wish the brush was a better quality though</li>
    <li> Worked great for what I needed it for. I used the &#x27;cape&#x27; to cover the sink since I was using henna dye. The handle on the comb is a little short but does the job. The cap fit snug but well.</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t highlight my hair without this kit!! Its great because it contains everything you need, cap, cape, gloves and hook</li>
    <li> This product is o-kay for the price, but the color brush has a short handle and the bristles are not very stiff.  It is hard to get the color to apply evenly at the roots with this brush because it flexes to much and the color pushes out the other side of the bristles rather than applying evenly to the root shaft.  So maybe think about spending money on a better hair color brush.</li>
    <li> LOVE this kit!! Recommend buying this.</li>
    <li> Exactly as described. Perfect</li>
    <li> Awesome price and includes almost everything you could need. Thanks!</li>
    <li> This product was pretty good, but it would be better with a larger cape and a small mixing tray.  I don&#x27;t understand what the highlighting cap is for nor how to use it.  I think there should have been directions!!</li>
    <li> As a kit, there isn&#x27;t much to it.  I  used the brush for applying the hair color which I think did a better job than when I usually just squirt the haircolor in my palms and rub it in so for that reason I liked this. As far as the hair cap, I usually just use a store plastic bag over my head, so I can&#x27;t rate the cap. I also didn&#x27;t use the cape which seemed flimsy and awkward because I wear an old tee shirt when dying hair so I can&#x27;t review the quality of the other items in the kit.</li>
