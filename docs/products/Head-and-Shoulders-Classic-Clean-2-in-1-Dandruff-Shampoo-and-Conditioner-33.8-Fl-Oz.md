      <li>I particularly like this one because it has a pump which makes it more convenient in the shower.</li>

      <li>, I don&#x27;t get body dandruff or even know if thats a real problem, but it leaves me smelling pretty nice and can help dry and clear up skin if you have acne problems (not guaranteed to be effective-</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a very large jug.</li>
      <li>I prefer the classic flavor because it just has fresh scent and a cool feeling when applied to my hair.</li>
      <li>Please, don&#x27;t mess with a good thing.</li>
      <li>this is the first time i purchased a 33 oz pump packaging.  </li>
      <li>From my experience, it&#x27;s better than the products starting with D and P.  </li>
      <li>Been a long time user of H&amp;S, but Amazon is the only place that sells this in bulk at a great price!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con:</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t really like it much at all compared to the Head and Shoulders Classic Clean.  </li>
      <li>ok So I think you might be able to save a little bit by shopping at your local walmart..</li>
      <li>i&#x27;m really debating if i should call p&amp;g to let them know.  </li>
      <li>The pump that comes with the bottle is very sturdy, I noticed.</li>
      <li>I have oily hair and this shampoo makes me feel clean but not dry.</li>
      <li>Also, I don&#x27;t feel much of the cooling sensation.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using the new formula for about 1.5 months and the misses has commented on my hair feeling more coarse now (without me having voiced to her my displeasure from the new formula).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It smells different and leaves my hair not feeling all that clean.  </li>
      <li>i almost thought it&#x27;s not the same product as 2/1 classic clean that i&#x27;m used to.  </li>
      <li>I switched back to the Classic Clean and am happier for it.</li>
      <li>I confirmed the problem by going back to some old shampoo I had in a swim bag</li>
      <li>supose to have made my scalp much moisten but dried it up more.</li>
      <li>Man, it sucked big time that I had to replace it with H&amp;S right away.</li>
      <li>, I feel like the change in formula warrants this product being listed as a totally new product and that my Subscription should not have purchased this item.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>and they sent me a coupon for a new bottle (tho</li>
      <li>The only thing I dislike about it is the price is a little high compared to regular shampoo, but I feel you can get a fair price from Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>i then went to a local supermarket and bought my regular size 2in1 classic clean.  </li>
      <li>I really want is the old formula back!</li>
      <li>The shampoo/conditioner has worked as advertised so far.</li>
      <li>I really like this stuff and no extra bottle of conditioner.</li>
      <li>but frequent washes have resulted in hair fall...</li>
      <li>Cant really speak for the conditioner part of the combo as I keep my hair very short.</li>
      <li>so i continued to use it for a few more times, yet i got the same results.  </li>
      <li>and my hair was back to normal.</li>
      <li>Maybe just keep it in the classic clean and mess around with the other new variations?</li>
      <li>I checked the ingredient list and it has been changed since the new bottle came out (bubbles on bottle design instead of just wavy blue).</li>
      <li>But this new bottle trying to minimize plastic has a fragile cap.</li>
      <li>The new creamy white formula leaves my hair greasy and unmanageable as well as it takes forever to rinse it out.</li>
      <li>I have been using this brand for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;Had not tried the drandruff one, normally use the classic regular shampoo.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I am a 22 year old man and I have suffered from dandruff since middle school.</li>
      <li>This batch barely generates any suds and leaves my hair like it&#x27;s been covered in wax.</li>
      <li>Go back to the old formula.  </li>
      <li>and there really isn&#x27;t any relief using other shampoos.</li>

<li> The smell sucks like only Head &amp; Shoulders can suck, but the 2 in 1 simplicity and and stellar results keep me coming back.</li>
<li> It is a little bit of thinner solution than the normal bottles purchased from a drugstore or supermarket.</li>
<li> I like the pump feature, but the shampoo is so thick that it dries in the pump and creates a gooey chunk with the first pump each time.  </li>
<li> As with other grocery products, shampoo is one you definitely want to place on your wish and check occasionally to see if there are any $ off coupons.</li>

<li> but that&#x27;s to be expected.</li>
<li> As expected.</li>
<li> these past 10 years the only solution for me has been Head and Shoulders, it doesn&#x27;t matter which style- they have all worked.</li>
<li> /&gt;Unlike other shampoos from brands like Pantene</li>
<li> , felt different on my hands, and worst of all, it made my hair so static afterwards.  </li>
<li> Less fuss than shampoo, then conditioner.</li>
<li> Sometimes it leaks down the side of the bottle as well, which looks messy.  </li>
<li> Then they changed the formula a few months ago...</li>
<li> I&#x27;m not a huge fan of the pump.</li>
<li> Even other dandruff shampoo&#x27;s, Selsun Blue wasn&#x27;t for me because it is too expensive</li>
<li> I usually don&#x27;t use conditioner, but with this 2 in 1, I don&#x27;t have to worry.</li>
<li> Usually, I buy it from Costco with coupon.</li>
<li> The negative reviews about the change of formula doesn&#x27;t seem to affect me.</li>
<li> No more dropping the shampoo because it is slippery!</li>
<li> Even after some thorough washing as soon as my hair dries its stuck to the crown of my head and is visibly greasy and slick with whatever residue this shampoo is leaving behind.</li>
<li> I anticipate it being annoying near the end of the bottle</li>
<li> I like head and shoulder products and for the price this bottle could not go wrong.</li>
<li> weird.  </li>
<li> I used to buy expensive designer shampoos.</li>
<li> The scent is not added artificially.</li>
<li> This stuff smells bad and burns my eyes.</li>
<li> I was prepared for a bad hair day</li>
<li> It&#x27;s the worst!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have been using Head &amp; Shoulders for more than a decade. I once wondered if there was anything comparable and purchased a CVS brand bottle. Man, it sucked big time that I had to replace it with H&amp;S right away. I have oily hair and this shampoo makes me feel clean but not dry. I prefer the classic flavor because it just has fresh scent and a cool feeling when applied to my hair.</li>
    <li> Head and Shoulders is the only dandruff shampoo that works for me. Nice clean scent, does not smell medicated. I didn&#x27;t realize that I ordered the Shampoo/Conditioner combo. Cant really speak for the conditioner part of the combo as I keep my hair very short. The pump that comes with the bottle is very sturdy, I noticed. Packaged well.</li>
    <li> My boyfriend uses this all the time, it is the only kind of hair product he uses.  He is a Head and Shoulders man all the way.  I keep this in stock at my house for him. He likes the scent and how the product works on his hair. Helps keep his scalf from getting to dry and flaking.</li>
    <li> This is a shampoo with a conditioner. The scent is not added artificially.</li>
    <li> I am a 22 year old man and I have suffered from dandruff since middle school. I would say it&#x27;s moderate to severe and there really isn&#x27;t any relief using other shampoos. Even other dandruff shampoo&#x27;s, Selsun Blue wasn&#x27;t for me because it is too expensive and I tried Target&#x27;s generic brand Head&amp;Shoulders shampoo and that had literally no effect on my dandruff.&lt;br /&gt;Over these past 10 years the only solution for me has been Head and Shoulders, it doesn&#x27;t matter which style- they have all worked. The only thing I dislike about it is the price is a little high compared to regular shampoo, but I feel you can get a fair price from Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;I also like using it on my body hair, I don&#x27;t get body dandruff or even know if thats a real problem, but it leaves me smelling pretty nice and can help dry and clear up skin if you have acne problems (not guaranteed to be effective-but I have heard people suggest using this).</li>
    <li> This jug lasted my wife and I for over a year. It&#x27;s a very large jug. So, when we moved my wife thought bringing the last little bit was impracticle. I really like this stuff and no extra bottle of conditioner.</li>
    <li> This stuff smells bad and burns my eyes. I have used Head and Shoulders for 45 years and love it. (plus have a full head of hair) This is not going to be my choice for flavor again.</li>
    <li> I like head and shoulder products and for the price this bottle could not go wrong. It is a little bit of thinner solution than the normal bottles purchased from a drugstore or supermarket. Also, I don&#x27;t feel much of the cooling sensation.</li>
    <li> This shampoo leaves my hair feeling dirtier than it was before washing! It&#x27;s the worst! Even after some thorough washing as soon as my hair dries its stuck to the crown of my head and is visibly greasy and slick with whatever residue this shampoo is leaving behind. Will never buy again</li>
    <li> This shampoo makes my hair shiny and clean with no residue. I used to buy expensive designer shampoos. One day I ran out and used my hubby&#x27;s head and shoulders. I was prepared for a bad hair day but I wad so surprised that my hair felt and looked better. I never went back.</li>
    <li> i have been using the same shampoo for almost 15 years now so i now what it smells like and how it should feel after i use it.  this is the first time i purchased a 33 oz pump packaging.  i almost thought it&#x27;s not the same product as 2/1 classic clean that i&#x27;m used to.  i almost thought it&#x27;s a knock off because it smelled different, felt different on my hands, and worst of all, it made my hair so static afterwards.  i refused to accept this fact so i continued to use it for a few more times, yet i got the same results.  my hair was weird after it is done being static.  it was so static it stood up when i comb it.  weird.  i then went to a local supermarket and bought my regular size 2in1 classic clean.  the item from the supermarket worked out fine.  it was the end to static and weirdness.  i&#x27;m really debating if i should call p&amp;g to let them know.  ugh...</li>
    <li> The shampoo/conditioner has worked as advertised so far. I pair this with a better conditioner and couldn&#x27;t be happier with the results. I don&#x27;t worry about flakes anymore...enough said.</li>
    <li> Nothing like the pump bottle! And the product always does the job.</li>
    <li> i think it cleans up well..but frequent washes have resulted in hair fall...but i think its because of the included conditioner..and its chemicals....</li>
    <li> I have been using this brand for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;Had not tried the drandruff one, normally use the classic regular shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d say it is just ok.</li>
    <li> I use this every time I shower. The negative reviews about the change of formula doesn&#x27;t seem to affect me. I must have been using this formula in the drugtsore purchases I&#x27;ve been making because I didn&#x27;t notice a difference. It&#x27;s a good size and the dispenser is really nice right now. I anticipate it being annoying near the end of the bottle but that&#x27;s to be expected.</li>
    <li> As expected. Everything is fine.</li>
    <li> excellent product and quality.  Securely packed and well priced.. . . . . . . . . . . .</li>
    <li> I thought I&#x27;d try the Head and Shoulders 2 in 1 shampoo and conditioner.  I don&#x27;t really like it much at all compared to the Head and Shoulders Classic Clean.  It smells different and leaves my hair not feeling all that clean.  I switched back to the Classic Clean and am happier for it.</li>
    <li> dries my scalp, gave to my brother he uses this. This is not for everyone. supose to have made my scalp much moisten but dried it up more.</li>
    <li> We use this for the shower, very nice as a body wash too, keeps us all clean and smelling very fresh.</li>
    <li> Less fuss than shampoo, then conditioner.</li>
    <li> From my experience, it&#x27;s better than the products starting with D and P.  But this new bottle trying to minimize plastic has a fragile cap. The cap broke when it dropped in the tub. Usually, I buy it from Costco with coupon.</li>
    <li> My husband uses this regularly. I can&#x27;t get him to switch to anything else. I particularly like this one because it has a pump which makes it more convenient in the shower.</li>
    <li> Came on time. Product is as described. Very good price, good smell and good for daily use.&lt;br /&gt;Best shampoo to control hair falling. I definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> ok So I think you might be able to save a little bit by shopping at your local walmart.. BUT I have Never seen the pump in the store! This makes life a bit easier when you have kids that use the shampoo as well lol. No more dropping the shampoo because it is slippery!</li>
    <li> Great dandruff and flake manager.  The smell sucks like only Head &amp; Shoulders can suck, but the 2 in 1 simplicity and and stellar results keep me coming back.</li>
    <li> Go back to the old formula.  The new creamy white formula leaves my hair greasy and unmanageable as well as it takes forever to rinse it out.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been a user of this stuff for years. This batch barely generates any suds and leaves my hair like it&#x27;s been covered in wax.</li>
    <li> I like the pump feature, but the shampoo is so thick that it dries in the pump and creates a gooey chunk with the first pump each time.  Sometimes it leaks down the side of the bottle as well, which looks messy.  The convenience makes up for it though.</li>
    <li> Awesome product at a good price.  keeps my hair smelling fresh.  I usually don&#x27;t use conditioner, but with this 2 in 1, I don&#x27;t have to worry.</li>
    <li> As others have stated, the formula used for this has recently changed.  I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d describe it as &amp;#34;waxy&amp;#34;, rather I&#x27;d say the ratio of shampooing agent to conditioning agent has changed.  If it was a 50/50 ratio before, I&#x27;d describe this as 95/5.  I&#x27;ve been using the new formula for about 1.5 months and the misses has commented on my hair feeling more coarse now (without me having voiced to her my displeasure from the new formula).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition, as someone who has been Subscribed to this product, I feel like the change in formula warrants this product being listed as a totally new product and that my Subscription should not have purchased this item.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, I love the pump that the new bottle comes with!</li>
    <li> As with other grocery products, shampoo is one you definitely want to place on your wish and check occasionally to see if there are any $ off coupons. I bought this bottle using the subscribe &amp; save option and the $2 off coupon, which made it super cheap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unlike other shampoos from brands like Pantene, this one seems to do a really good job of keeping my head itch-free for the whole day. I don&#x27;t find myself with the urge to scratch my head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Odor isn&#x27;t too obtrusive to the best of my knowledge as it seems to have been engineered to be barely noticeable after use.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using head and shoulders for many years and loved the classic clean 2in1 for my greasy but fine hair. Then they changed the formula a few months ago... Now my hair feels greasy (or waxy, as another reviewer said)  as soon as it dries. I checked the ingredient list and it has been changed since the new bottle came out (bubbles on bottle design instead of just wavy blue). I confirmed the problem by going back to some old shampoo I had in a swim bag and my hair was back to normal. I called their customer service and they sent me a coupon for a new bottle (tho it was only good for a month and I never got to use it).&lt;br /&gt;What I really want is the old formula back! Maybe just keep it in the classic clean and mess around with the other new variations? Please, don&#x27;t mess with a good thing.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not a huge fan of the pump. I just buy a big bottle, then load into a smaller bottle, so the pump gets a little cumbersome when refilling.</li>
    <li> Been a long time user of H&amp;S, but Amazon is the only place that sells this in bulk at a great price!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con: Seems to run out quickly, but i guess that is just me</li>
