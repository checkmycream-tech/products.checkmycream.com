      <li>I love this fun, bright color!</li>
      <li>It is so bright and cheerful.</li>
      <li>However, beauty shine packaged and shipped the bottle very securely.</li>
      <li>:)</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s unlike so many others that I have seen</li>
      <li>I love the color</li>
      <li>Oh we&#x27;ll...live and learn :)</li>
      <li>I have gotten more compliments on this color than I ever have.</li>
      <li>I get so many compliments whenever I am wearing it.</li>
      <li>Get so many compliments on the color also.</li>
      <li>After trying this color found out I was in love with it.  </li>
      <li>and it looks great on, particularly against tanned summer skin.  </li>
      <li>This nail polish is a great summery color, an orangey pink neon that is almost blindingly bright, brighter and more orange than any picture you will find of it online.</li>
      <li>perfect color, essie nail polish is top rated out of tons of other nailpolishes, I definately suggest you buy this.</li>
      <li>This nail polish wears well and it is such a good color for summer!  </li>
      <li>The color is an extremely bright color that comes off more red than fuchsia.</li>
      <li>This is definitely a color you want to wear with a great tan.</li>
      <li>It does dry matte, which I found odd, but glosses up beautifully with a good top coat.</li>
      <li>Pool Party is a great neon pink that gets you in the mood for summer.  </li>
      <li>but the first time I msged them they responded!</li>
      <li>Still, the awesomeness of the color makes it worth the hassle.</li>
      <li>Very neon and fun!  </li>
      <li>it&#x27;s such a cute summer color.</li>
      <li>and it doesn&#x27;t hurt that it makes you look tan ;)</li>
      <li>It actually looks pinkish in the bottle but it is a super cool summer color.  </li>
      <li>Unfortunately, although I love the color and the seller delivered it with perfect promptness, I struggle a little to apply this polish evenly.</li>
      <li>Once it dries, it&#x27;s very ashy looking.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t stay on very well either.  </li>
      <li>Unless you&#x27;re absolutely smitten with the color and paint nails well, choose another color.</li>
      <li>Great color kinda looks hot pink which if you are dark skin like i am</li>
      <li>I would recommend the seller as the shipping was fast</li>
      <li>Love this neon pink color!</li>
      <li>The picture doesn&#x27;t quite do it justice and almost mutes how vibrant it is.  </li>
      <li>Highly recommend this nail polish for those who want a pop of color.</li>
      <li>Like so many other neons, it applies quite streaky and matte without a topcoat, and the chipping starts earlier than many other polishes.</li>
      <li>Only complaint is you need a good clear polish to apply after.</li>
      <li>But the clear fixes it.</li>
      <li>Unlike the others, it is thick yet applies with many streaks.</li>
      <li>I feel obligated to say this color is HOT PINK all the way.  </li>
      <li>Great price definitely less expensive than locally</li>

<li> Great price definitely less expensive than locally</li>
<li> and I had to apply several coats of not only the color but the additional gloss which took for ever to dry.</li>
<li> This color looked different than what I expected, but I like the difference it stands when  I apply it to my toenails.</li>
<li> I contacted the seller and they keep sending me the same msg saying they are closed</li>
<li> This is false advertising, this is supposed to be a shiny hot pink, the same brand they use at the nail salon</li>
<li> Like the other neons from this collection, the finish is matte.</li>
<li> Neon pink!!</li>
<li> I think this is ridiculous all I asked for was my money back</li>
<li> but instead I got a low quality, crappy orange color that looks so horrible and cheap on my nails.</li>
<li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on here.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m not entirely sure if I&#x27;m having troubles because the formula is bad or if the bottle is old.</li>
<li> I just don&#x27;t remember this brand being so dull.</li>
<li> It took three coats to even out and now looks very thick.</li>
<li> and this is definitely one of the few that I am very disappointed with.</li>
<li> Little disappointed cause</li>

    <li> I own over 50 bottles of China Glaze and this is definitely one of the few that I am very disappointed with. The color is an extremely bright color that comes off more red than fuchsia. Like the other neons from this collection, the finish is matte. Unlike the others, it is thick yet applies with many streaks. It took three coats to even out and now looks very thick.

    <li> Awesome color, bright and really attractive. Strangers compliment me when I wear my pool party!. Great price definitely less expensive than locally</li>

    <li> It actually looks pinkish in the bottle but it is a super cool summer color.  I always get compliments when I wear it.</li>
    <li> I love the color BUT it takes 3+ coats to just get the color to so that you can&#x27;t see through it.  It doesn&#x27;t stay on very well either.  Little disappointed cause it&#x27;s such a cute summer color.</li>
    <li> I ordered this nail polish 3 weeks ago, I never got it, they charged me for it and the tracking said it was delivered! I contacted the seller and they keep sending me the same msg saying they are closed but the first time I msged them they responded! I think this is ridiculous all I asked for was my money back cuz it&#x27;s obvious I&#x27;m not gonna get my stuff and they won&#x27;t answer me back! I&#x27;m so unsatisfied! This has happened to me b4 but they gave me my money back!</li>
    <li> This is so bright!! Neon pink!! If you like bright you&#x27;ll love this color, it does need sometimes 3 coats, I notice sometimes I can do 2 coats then maybe one or two fingers need 3, it&#x27;s nice and shiny!! I love this color, great for spring and summer!! I love China Glaze!!!</li>

    <li> This nail polish is a great summery color, an orangey pink neon that is almost blindingly bright, brighter and more orange than any picture you will find of it online. If there&#x27;s any polish that&#x27;ll bring attention to your nails, it&#x27;s this one. Unfortunately, although I love the color and the seller delivered it with perfect promptness, I struggle a little to apply this polish evenly. Like so many other neons, it applies quite streaky and matte without a topcoat, and the chipping starts earlier than many other polishes.

    <li> This is a perfect color for spring and summer on your toes.  The color matches with everything and this polish has staying power.</li>
