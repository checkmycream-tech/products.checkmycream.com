    <li> This is one of my favorite all time perfumes. The scent is amazing and though I can&#x27;t smell it on myself, I get many compliments.</li>
    <li> I originally saw this product at my local Sephora store and loved the smell! It was on clearance so I was worried that I wouldn&#x27;t be able to buy it anymore so I wanted to stock up on it from Amazon. It has a unique clean scent that&#x27;s not overpowering, flowery or powdery. I wear this scent everyday now.</li>
    <li> My wife loved it ,it was a great Christmas gift. Was the one thing she really wanted. would recommend to all my friends</li>
    <li> I loved it! !! The smell is great! It lasts a long time and the price is fantastic! I really recommend it for a every day perfum.</li>
    <li> THIS IS A GREAT PERFUME! IF YOU LOVE THE BEACH AND EVERYTHING ABOUT IT YOU WILL LOVE THIS PERFUME. IT DEFINITELY REMINDS ME OF THE BEACH. I GET LOTS OF COMPLIMENTS AND HAVE BOUGHT SEVERAL BOTTLES FOR GIFTS AS WELL AND MY GIRLFRIENDS LOVE IT! :) BUY IT! IT&#x27;S WORTH EVERY PENNY!!! AND IT IS NOT AN EXPENSIVE PERFUME.</li>
    <li> This is a very beachy perfume and great for the summer time.  It is very light not strong.  It is very hard to find now so I was very please to get it from Amazon.  Also purchase gift set for Christmas Gift because it is so hard to fine now in stores.</li>
    <li> Very blah. No real scent. Disappointed. I won&#x27;t be buying this fragrance again. I don&#x27;t think that I will be buying fragrances online again.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my girlfriend and she LOVES it! Smells light, fresh, and clean. Perfect. I would recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> This scent is light but lingers and mixes so well with my body chemistry.  I don&#x27;t like wearing things that don&#x27;t mix well with my chemistry because I always get compliments when I wear this scent (and one other that works for me).  Never heavy but always noticed!  Even women tell me I smell wonderful when I wear this.  Now THAT is a compliment!</li>
    <li> I have found my new summer fragrance! I love the subtle scent; it is not too,&amp;#34;saccharin/sugary&amp;#34; smelling like the majority of fragrances are nowadays.</li>
    <li> This smells like band aids when you first spray it, then there was some floral scent to it, very light and not very good. It has no longevity whatsoever.</li>
    <li> Great smelling. Durable and i can travel with it. Its actually larger than i expected so more perfume in the bottle!!</li>
    <li> I had my husband give me the smell test and he loved it! He also has allergies and this did not bother him, so it is a win win for me. It is a weightless fragrance that hints at being all woman. It has all the gentle overtones of a floral bouquet along with a hint of amber. It exceeds my expectations.</li>
    <li> i am totally addicted to the fresh scent of the jennifer aniston perfume.  it&#x27;s the scent that leaves a person feeling comforted and at peace while pleasing to others as well. thank you</li>
    <li> I love this fragrance ,I discovered it by accident when I got a free sample,and it is my favorite now...</li>
    <li> This smells wonderful,but it doesn&#x27;t last. I sprayed it all over mysef and clothes-I smelled soo good. Within 3 hours it was faint as a whisper and another hour and it was gone.Too much money for too little scent.</li>
    <li> I already loved this perfume and this was a great price for the BIG bottle! No problems with shipping or anything else.</li>
    <li> I love this perfume. It smells awesome and its long lasting! The smell lasts for days on my clothes.</li>
    <li> I find I have to keep spraying throughout the day because it just disappears which is too bad because it&#x27;s super pretty and light for spring/summer</li>
    <li> The previous reviews are spot on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Spraying this has no more of an effect than spraying scented water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I LOVE how it smells, it sure does NOT last.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m prefectly aware of the fact that we just &amp;#34;get used&amp;#34; to the scent as is evident in women keep reapplying overly strong perfume.  This is not the case.  NO ONE can smell it.</li>
    <li> This perfume has a wonderful , fresh scent but didn&#x27;t last long enough for me to get out of the front door. Literally about 5 minutes! A real waste of money. Go to Target or a place where you can try before you buy!</li>
