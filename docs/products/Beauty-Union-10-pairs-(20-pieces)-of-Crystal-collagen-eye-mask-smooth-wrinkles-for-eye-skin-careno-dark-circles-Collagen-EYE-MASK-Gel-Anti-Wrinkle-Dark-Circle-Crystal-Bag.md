      <li>It is amazing program.</li>
      <li>feels really nice</li>
      <li>It is ok it is a working in progress.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s ok.</li>
      <li>I LOVE them.  </li>
      <li>I do not have sensitive skin nor have I ever , this product greatly irritated my eyes and skin within minutes.</li>
      <li>but like i said - they feel nice.. rejuvenating - but no miracle product ;)</li>
      <li>I use them when I want to have that special, youthful, smooth look under my eyes.</li>
      <li>This feel great after a long week at work on a friday night.</li>
      <li>I love those patches, they really moisturize my eye area.</li>
      <li>ive used about 5-6 of these so far - they feel nice under my eyes</li>
      <li>I love these so much is relaxing my eyes</li>
      <li>I received my first sample of these for free with another order.  </li>
      <li>First time using these</li>
      <li>Have to use everyday I think to see the good result.</li>
      <li>These are a nice little treat that I use once a week.</li>
      <li>Tons of product, very slippery.</li>
      <li>Great for days when your eye feel tired</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t see much of a change but hoping one day before my wedding approaches</li>
      <li>It really plumps up the under eyes and hydrates so well.</li>
      <li>I can really tell a difference when I use them</li>
      <li>I could have gotten them fast off of ebay.</li>
      <li>It is true that the writing on the front of the package doesn&#x27;t really make sense and the directions on the back have a misspelling, but it&#x27;s not complicated to figure out what you&#x27;re supposed to do with these.</li>
      <li>I could tell a difference in my shallow under eye wrinkles after the first use and they are very refreshing.</li>
      <li>I am african american and surprisingly this product workes within two tries</li>
      <li>I feel like I have a new lease on life each time that I put them on.  </li>
      <li>Rip the package open (make sure the masks are pointing upward or the serum will pour out and make a mess), slide the tray out, put the masks under your eyes fat side out and leave them on for 30 minutes.</li>
      <li>So far I used it twice.</li>
      <li>and I really do not find that it was worth the wait.</li>
      <li>The skin visually  became smooth and firm</li>
      <li>They work very well to lessen dark circles.</li>
      <li>I really like these little eye masks.</li>

<li> don&#x27;t buy them, waste money, easily broken, not working at all, just use one pair, the rest of them into my garbage.</li>
<li> Terrible I couldn&#x27;t get my dark under circles removed</li>
<li> i have 20 packs and figured i&#x27;d need alot because it was so bad</li>
<li> I never buy that product again :(</li>

    <li> Great for days when your eye feel tired and you want something to decrease undereye puffiness.</li>
    <li> i put it in the fridge for a bit then use it on my eyes. feels really nice but i didnt notice a difference in the puffiness of  my eyes</li>
    <li> These are a nice little treat that I use once a week. It really plumps up the under eyes and hydrates so well.</li>
    <li> They work very well to lessen dark circles.</li>
    <li> Terrible I couldn&#x27;t get my dark under circles removed I never buy that product again :(</li>
    <li> These took forever to get in the mail. When I open them the eye gels tear apart very easily so be careful. The packaging seems very aged and dried out.</li>
    <li> I really like these little eye masks. I could tell a difference in my shallow under eye wrinkles after the first use and they are very refreshing. It is true that the writing on the front of the package doesn&#x27;t really make sense and the directions on the back have a misspelling, but it&#x27;s not complicated to figure out what you&#x27;re supposed to do with these. Rip the package open (make sure the masks are pointing upward or the serum will pour out and make a mess), slide the tray out, put the masks under your eyes fat side out and leave them on for 30 minutes. No big deal. I think for the price these do a great job! I will definitely reorder these.</li>
    <li> It is amazing program. You could see the result immediately after 30 minutes of treatment. The skin visually  became smooth and firm</li>

    <li> I love these! I use them when I want to have that special, youthful, smooth look under my eyes. The effect lasts all day.</li>
    <li> I love those patches, they really moisturize my eye area. Nothing else works wonders like that for me!!!</li>
    <li> Received faster than expected. Thank you. First time using these and they feel amazing! Soothing and cool...awe...will refrigerate to intensify the effect</li>
    <li> Item arrived just as described.&lt;br /&gt;Delivery takes a long time but I knew that at the time I purchased.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t see much of a change but hoping one day before my wedding approaches</li>
    <li> Have to use everyday I think to see the good result.</li>
    <li> So far I used it twice. It is ok it is a working in progress.</li>
