### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Works great!</li>
      <li>Excellent product!</li>
      <li>It gives me great length and the lashes don&#x27;t clump together.  </li>
      <li>It a great product and yes helps in the growth of your lashes.</li>
      <li>Great mascara, doesn&#x27;t clump.</li>
      <li>Good consistency.  </li>
      <li>Love it!</li>
      <li>I bought this mascara mostly because of the brush design (full bristles that looked like they would provide excellent volume).  </li>
      <li>It does not go on real smoothly or make the lashes look fuller as the article that I read indicated.</li>
      <li>I love love love this mascara, it works beautifully , the brush is amazing.....</li>
      <li>Better than Lancôme, better than Mary Kay, better than Est&amp;eacute;e Lauder, better any drugstore brand!  </li>
      <li>sure if I will repurchase this item for now,</li>
      <li>and I love it.</li>
      <li>Thus, I purchased 2 more to share with my daughter.</li>
      <li>My top lashes would hang up with the bottom lashes and it seemed to make them brittle.</li>
      <li>I wanted to purchase more</li>
      <li>This is now my favorite mascara.</li>
      <li>I was never expecting anything more.</li>
      <li>I first tried &#x27;LashFood&#x27; conditioning Drama Mascara when it was offerred on a &amp;#34;Flash Sale&amp;#34; site and LOVED it.&lt;br /&gt;When</li>
      <li>I really liked my first purchas of Lash Food.</li>
      <li>This is, hands down, the best mascara that I have ever used!  </li>
      <li>Goes on smooth and brush defines lashes.  </li>
      <li>is a light mascara....</li>
      <li>this comes off with a cheap eye make up remover.....</li>
      <li>and i have to say although my lashes are longer i would not pay full price for this product solely to get some longer lashes.</li>
      <li>But the fact that it has good, sensitive, hair loving ingredients is a plus for me compared to other mascaras filled with chemicals that are not beneficial in any way.&lt;br /&gt;Not</li>
      <li>I should also mention that this mascara dries quickly, so there is almost no smudging.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m just grateful that Amazon has such an amazing return policy.  </li>
      <li>I love the coverage this mascara offers.</li>
      <li>This is a great product, not one who use black mascara, however, after purchasing this paricular brand!  </li>
      <li>this is a great natural mascara--does not irritate my eyes whatsoever and does not really flake at all during the day time.</li>
      <li>I especially appreciate the fact that it doesn&#x27;t crumble into my eyes causing irritation throughout the day like so many others on the market.</li>
      <li>I also love the brush--its big and fluffy.&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
      <li>I ended up getting the new CoverGirl Full Lash Bloom mascara</li>
      <li>The brush btw is really nice, fluffy and thick so coating the lashes is nice and easy.</li>
      <li>and although I loved the results, it was so hard to take off..</li>
      <li>This stuff seems to have given me a style and absolutely nothing to grow my eyelashes.</li>
      <li>they are real ..or something like that</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m giving this four stars because it&#x27;s only been two weeks, and because the ingredient list on the box offers synthetics more than it does botanicals.</li>
      <li>Not when applied or for new growth, just lengthening.</li>
      <li>only complaint is that the formula dries pretty quickly in the bottle--the first 2 weeks it applied very nicely, but now it&#x27;s slightly difficult to apply evenly because the formula is drier.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Maybe I got an old batch.</li>
      <li>Seems like it was an old tube.</li>
      <li>Just long, clearly defined lashes!!!</li>
      <li>Is it possible I received an old batch?</li>
      <li>It dried so quickly that when I tried to put on a second coat or use a spooley to separate my lashes it started coming off in clumps.  </li>
      <li>I have received compliments on how nice my lashes look---even though I did not buy this product for any dramatic effect!</li>
      <li>I know it has only been a few weeks, but my skin tends to be sensitive and highly responsive to products.</li>
      <li>Some of my lashes are definitely a lot longer, but i was hoping for more of a dramatic result like all of my lashes be long and luxurious.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this Lashfood Mascara for less than a month, and so far it has done what I expected it to do: It made my eyelashes stronger, softer, thicker, and even a little darker. I was never expecting anything more. I knew this product wouldn&#x27;t emphasize curling, volumizing, lengthening, or anything of similar commercial variety. All I was looking for was a mascara containing peptides, amino acids, and other ingredients that would gradually help my lashes grow stronger and longer over time. I believe this will do the job. I should also mention that this mascara dries quickly, so there is almost no smudging. I know it has only been a few weeks, but my skin tends to be sensitive and highly responsive to products. I&#x27;m giving this four stars because it&#x27;s only been two weeks, and because the ingredient list on the box offers synthetics more than it does botanicals. But hey, if it works, it works. At least for me!</li>
    <li> I have tried other mascara and keep coming back to Lash Food.  It gives me great length and the lashes don&#x27;t clump together.  I buy two at a time.  Love it!</li>
    <li> I tried this for a discounted price and i have to say although my lashes are longer i would not pay full price for this product solely to get some longer lashes. Some of my lashes are definitely a lot longer, but i was hoping for more of a dramatic result like all of my lashes be long and luxurious. Not so. Also it did not help in any way adding volume. Not when applied or for new growth, just lengthening. The brush btw is really nice, fluffy and thick so coating the lashes is nice and easy.</li>
    <li> This is a great product, not one who use black mascara, however, after purchasing this paricular brand!  That is a thing of the past! It a great product and yes helps in the growth of your lashes.</li>
    <li> It takes about ten coats to cover your lashes. Not something I will waste money on again. Seems like it was an old tube.</li>
    <li> this is a great natural mascara--does not irritate my eyes whatsoever and does not really flake at all during the day time. I have received compliments on how nice my lashes look---even though I did not buy this product for any dramatic effect! I also love the brush--its big and fluffy.&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is that the formula dries pretty quickly in the bottle--the first 2 weeks it applied very nicely, but now it&#x27;s slightly difficult to apply evenly because the formula is drier.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know if my lashes are any longer because of this product--I don&#x27;t wear mascara everyday anyways. But the fact that it has good, sensitive, hair loving ingredients is a plus for me compared to other mascaras filled with chemicals that are not beneficial in any way.&lt;br /&gt;Not sure if I will repurchase this item for now, but I do like it. I tend to buy different mascaras each time anyways.</li>
    <li> doesnt clump a single bit! looks natural, accentuates every single one of your lashes without causing any clumps or looking fake!</li>
    <li> I really liked my first purchas of Lash Food. In a few weeks my lashes looked longer &amp; less were on my cheeks in the morning. Thus, I purchased 2 more to share with my daughter.

    <li> Great mascara, doesn&#x27;t clump.</li>
    <li> I was not real impressed with this mascara. It did not give the lash building results I was expecting. It does not go on real smoothly or make the lashes look fuller as the article that I read indicated.</li>
    <li> This is now my favorite mascara. I get the primer and this and it makes my lashes thick and long.</li>
    <li> I first tried &#x27;LashFood&#x27; conditioning Drama Mascara when it was offerred on a &amp;#34;Flash Sale&amp;#34; site and LOVED it.&lt;br /&gt;When I wanted to purchase more I found it on Amazon and have replenished my supply.&lt;br /&gt;This is a light mascara....does NOT clump or dry my lashes. It is also smudge-proof.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;Dramatic&amp;#34; look is from 2-3 layers....I finally found a mascara that is everything I want in a mascara!</li>
    <li> Good consistency.  Goes on smooth and brush defines lashes.  Does not smear</li>
    <li> Excellent product! Works great!</li>
    <li> I should have taken the negative reviews more seriously.  I don&#x27;t know if my order was defective or what, but I had the same awful experience others mentioned that included major flaking.  I bought this mascara mostly because of the brush design (full bristles that looked like they would provide excellent volume).  However, I tried it one time and immediately started the return process with Amazon.  This mascara started flaking immediately after I applied it!!  It dried so quickly that when I tried to put on a second coat or use a spooley to separate my lashes it started coming off in clumps.  Even when I used my eye makeup remover to take it off it came off in flakes and clumps!  Disgusting!  I&#x27;m just grateful that Amazon has such an amazing return policy.  I ended up getting the new CoverGirl Full Lash Bloom mascara instead and I love it.</li>
    <li> I love the coverage this mascara offers. I especially appreciate the fact that it doesn&#x27;t crumble into my eyes causing irritation throughout the day like so many others on the market.</li>
    <li> My top lashes would hang up with the bottom lashes and it seemed to make them brittle. I was hoping to nourish my lashes but seem to get the opposite effect. Maybe I got an old batch.</li>
    <li> I love love love this mascara, it works beautifully , the brush is amazing.....and I swear my lashes are longer and healthier ....I was using a brand called  .. they are real ..or something like that and although I loved the results, it was so hard to take off..which started stressing my eyelashes ..this comes off with a cheap eye make up remover.....I am hooked!</li>
    <li> This stuff seems to have given me a style and absolutely nothing to grow my eyelashes.</li>
    <li> This is, hands down, the best mascara that I have ever used!  Better than Lancôme, better than Mary Kay, better than Est&amp;eacute;e Lauder, better any drugstore brand!  Buy it &amp; see for yourself.  No clumping, no flaking!  Just long, clearly defined lashes!!!</li>
