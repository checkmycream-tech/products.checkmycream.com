    <li> This product works well on my teenage daughter&#x27;s face. Keeps pores clean.</li>
    <li> Nothing, not even prescriptions from the dermatologist, has ever put a dent in my adult acne UNTIL NOW!  This stuff is awesome.  I&#x27;m super lazy about removing my makeup at night, and having pre-moistened wipes definitely helps out.  I haven&#x27;t had a break out since I started using Murad products.  I know they&#x27;re pricey but totally worth it!</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin and this caused redness and mild irritation. Also these wipes caused my skin to be very dry and flaky.</li>
    <li> I really like these wipes.  I use them everyday and they leave my face feeling fresh and clean. They are great to travel with when you need a fresh &amp;#34;pick-me-up&amp;#34; for your face.</li>
    <li> Amazing before and after the gym!</li>
    <li> As a skin professional, I always use Murad products. My teen grandson loves the wipes. I replenish at Amazon, as the price is great.&lt;br /&gt;Murad is the best.</li>
    <li> Very good and easy to use. Just keep in your purse and use on the way home. I keep mine in the fridge and they are so refreshing .</li>
    <li> These wipes are great. They really help my skin to stay balanced and smooth. My skin clears up while using these wipes. It works wonders for whiteheads and blackheads. I&#x27;m a 27 year old female with a mildly oily skin type, with sporadic stress pimples on forehead. I&#x27;m a frequent buyer.</li>
    <li> Great products by Murad for very stubborn acne. I have tried everything out there but this is the only product that works on my sensitive skin. Keep in my car for the hot days that I need that clean feeling</li>
    <li> Great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend keeping them in a ziplock bag after opening for the first time since the re-seal is imperfect, and these dry out easily.</li>
    <li> I am almost 30, consistently experiencing acne. Murad acne seems to &#x27;pull out&#x27; my acne ie. clogged pores but hasn&#x27;t seemed to clear up much. I see more blackheads now than more ever, possibly less breakouts tho. I do enjoy the acne &#x27;blue line&#x27; lotion. It&#x27;s never too heavy.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about a week, I use them before I put on makeup, just to even out my skin and get rid of access oils/dirt and they work wonderfully. If you just want a quick cleanse, these are perfect. (just make sure to let your skin dry after using them before you apply make up or other products)</li>
    <li> This is, by far, one of my favorite facial products(and I&#x27;ve tried a lot of products). I&#x27;ve used one every night since I bought it and it really does make your face feel super clean. Price is a little steep but it&#x27;s worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, some people complain about the smell. It&#x27;s just the smell of rubbing alcohol. It&#x27;s really not a big deal. Personally, I think the smell adds to the whole clean feeling it gives me :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lastly, delivery was crazy fast. Will be buying again!</li>
    <li> most times when i travel, my skincare routines can get really lax. not with these! you just wipe and go, it&#x27;s super convenient.</li>
    <li> I BOUGHT THE WHOLE ACNE KIT  DUE TO OLD AGE ACNE PROBLEMS  IT IS NOT WORKING AS WELL AS I HAD HOPED OR PAID FOR. IT WAS EXPENSIVE TOO.&lt;br /&gt;I AM EXPANDING MY SEArch for relief by ordering other types of acne clear products&lt;br /&gt; I THOUGHT SINCE THEY RPOMISED SO MUCH IT  WOULD  HELP ME BUT MY ACNE IS NOT BETTER .</li>
    <li> Washing my face is a pain in the butt for me. Using these wipes made it quick and easy. They worked surpassingly well and help to clear up my stubborn acne.</li>
    <li> Good product, shipped fast.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> Really good stuff! The wipes really made my skin feel nice and tingly and it kept the face demons at bay!</li>
    <li> The price is a bit much for the quantity. I only use these when I don&#x27;t feel like getting out the cleansing kit and want to get to bed. But it always best to wash your face twice a day.&lt;br /&gt;I can tell when using these wipes they are just as effective as the bottled cleanser.</li>
    <li> Love love love these! I order them once per month. They&#x27;ve really helped my breakouts subside!</li>
    <li> Great product and merchant</li>
    <li> Great product. Cleans and keeps skin clear of acne. I always have this product on hand. Perfect for travel or to use at bedtime when you don&#x27;t want to wash your face.</li>
    <li> I feel like my face actually gets a good cleaning with these. I use one in the morning then one at night before washing with the Murad Acne Cleanser.  Again, only gripe is the cost.  Update (7/30/15) - Got them for $9 a pack from RVBeauty (plus shipping)...so I got two packs for the cost of one, plus shipping!</li>
    <li> Love these wipes. They really refresh and clean my skin.</li>
    <li> I like the wipes, i would change the smell but it cleans and removes all the dirt</li>
    <li> Really make your face feel clean when you don&#x27;t have access to the normal cleaning. Kept my face from breaking out through 4 days of camping.</li>
    <li> Cleans well great product!</li>
    <li> Work well, good deal here.</li>
    <li> The wipes do not guarantee that they will remove all blemishes or prevent all of them. No product will ever do that because it&#x27;s impossible. Your skin is a environment with all kinds of bacteria and organisms that live there. It secretes oils to keep the skin moisturized during the day and as a result it can get particles of dirt and grime stuck on it which can get into a pore causing your skin to become irritated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is designed to clean off the surface of your skin removing the days oil and with it some of the grime, which it does well. If you truly want your acne to go away you would really need to be dead, or wait for your body to decrease its hormone levels naturally (providing that&#x27;s what is causing the problem). Cleaning wipes only take off what they can reach. The best option for you would most likely be to wash your face twice a day (as well as you do in the shower). This product does NOT apply a protective layer to prevent your natural oils/sweat from getting caught in your pores while sleeping either, for that you need to get the correct product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THIS IS ONLY DESIGNED TO CLEAN 1 LAYER OF GRIME OFF OF YOUR FACE. It&#x27;s not meant to be a complete solution, if you want that you need to make more of an effort than just wiping off your face with a wipe.</li>
    <li> Love these!  I use them to wipe off all of my makeup before I workout.  They are gentle but effective, and they leave a nice clean, tingly feel.  No residue.  The smell is sort of like aromatherapy oils.  I don&#x27;t mind it.  They&#x27;re large and don&#x27;t dry out in the packaging, even in my car.</li>
    <li> Great product and cheaper than buying at Massage Envy where i was buying them.</li>
    <li> my face is clean!! yah it was what i wanted. thanks for the great product i would buy again. yah</li>
    <li> I love these Murad wipes..I use them for travel; after working out, before using my Clarisonic Mia2, and for my shoulders and back..my boyfriend loves these as well..they get rid of excess oil, makeup, and keep my skin clear..</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the whole Murad acne line for about 6 months now. Was excited to find these! I find that my skin gets so oily during the day - and these are great for that.These are convenient to keep in my purse or car. They don&#x27;t smell that great.. But neither does the rest of the Murad products. Overall, no complaints. Will be buying again.</li>
    <li> This product really clears or prevents acne.  The Murad Clarifying also comes in a bottle.  Try Murad&#x27;s Pure Skin® Clarifying Dietary Supplement to maintain healthy and clear skin.  I am 52 with occasional acne and these items have really help clear up my skin.</li>
    <li> I was searching for the best price and this was it! I was surprised to see an extra package of wipes when my shipment arrived. Great service, fast shipping. I&#x27;ve tried almost every product on my face since I was 15 years old and nothing has worked like the Murad product works. These beat those big name SUPER expensive face products by far. Within 5 days the little bumps all over my chin were completely gone, my complexion is like it has never been before, NO breakouts in a month...that has never happened before and my skin is so soft. I can walk around confident with no makeup.I will be placing another order with this seller soon.</li>
    <li> I needed to switch my face products because I was in the process of using too many. That being said, I changed to Murad. While the lotion I have had a very bad smell, the facial wipes are fantastic. Working with animals all day, sometimes you just need to freshen up, and these wipes make me feel that way. My skin is not shiny or red after. It leaves my face feeling fresh and clean without over drying or irritating it. I will continue to carry these in my purse!</li>
    <li> Great skin product. Cleans your pores with an immediately noticeable effect</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t really seen a clear improvement in my skin after using these I also haven&#x27;t seen it getting worse. Granted I&#x27;ve only been using them for a week or two so I will give them more time but so far they are not drying out the skin but they&#x27;re also not clearing it up as quickly as I hope. Not terrible, not amazing either.</li>
    <li> These are great for traveling when I don&#x27;t want to lug all my face stuff with me... they smell pretty strong and my face is a little red after using it.. so I only use it them at night. My skin looks great the next day and it is a great solution for me.</li>
    <li> they are very handy when you arew too lazy to wash your face</li>
</ol>
