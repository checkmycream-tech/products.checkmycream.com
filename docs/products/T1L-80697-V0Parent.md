      <li>The line is great, but most of the products do basically the same thing.</li>
      <li>I feel like this is the most useful product in their kit.</li>
      <li>Loved the product and fast shipping :) Highly recommend!</li>
      <li>I was not disappointed.  </li>
      <li>I tried so many products I was ready to give up when I stumbled upon this.</li>
      <li>and I will be purchasing full sizes when I run out of these.</li>
      <li>I ended up buying a few creams for me and my mom, and they all worked out great.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad I purchased this instead of buying all full sizes, I&#x27;m not a big fan of these products.</li>
      <li>I have very sensitive skin and most of commercial and many organic products cause a reaction.</li>
      <li>All of the products in the 1000 Roses line are excellent - you can&#x27;t go wrong with such good technology at a reasonable price.</li>
      <li>The line is great, but most of the products do basically the same thing.he same Key Ingredients which you can see on their website.</li>

      <li>Thought this would be good for my sensitive dry face.</li>
      <li>This set is awesome to travel with - it would last at least a week of non-stop use.</li>

      <li>Very hydrating, soothes irriation.</li>
      <li>Very hydrating, soothes irriation.</li>
      <li>Their toner works very well.</li>
      <li>It lets you really explore products and how your skin reacts to them.</li>
      <li>The toner and the daytime moisturizer didn&#x27;t really get along with my skin.</li>
      <li>You can get them on sale periodically at whole foods as well.</li>
      <li>The toner didn&#x27;t seem to do much.</li>
      <li>I also really like</li>
      <li>I have very sensitive skin and this line is very gentle on my face.</li>
      <li>I have tried several other Andalou lines and like them as well...but love the roses!</li>
      <li>I like the 1000 Roses line because it does an amazing job with reducing redness, however since all of the products in the line are so similar to each other</li>
      <li>I like the 1000 Roses line because it does an amazing job with reducing redness, however since all of the products in the line are so similar to each other</li>
      <li>I love these little travel sized/sample sized kits.</li>
      <li>The products feel very cooling and hydrating and clear up any redness.</li>
      <li>My skin is very sensitive and so far it has not reacted.  </li>
      <li>My skin felt soft and moist after using.  </li>
      <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve noticed many toners tend to dry out my skin, but this one doesn&#x27;t (unless I use way too much; you only need a few drops on a cotton ball, don&#x27;t completely saturate it).</li>
      <li>/&gt;Another important factor to keep in mind with this entire kit, and the entire 1000 Roses line, is that they all have the same Key Ingredients which you can see on their website.</li>
      <li>It gets rid of any additional oil, but it doesn&#x27;t strip away so much oil that it would leave your skin dry.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m also pale with mild rosacea.</li>
      <li>May purchase another kit in the near future.</li>
      <li>If you look at their website all of the Active Ingredients are the same, and many of the other ingredients are the same.</li>
      <li>This is very gentle on sensitive skin; several other exfoliators which I&#x27;ve used make my face red afterwards because they&#x27;re too abrasive.</li>
      <li>However, it&#x27;s much more expensive than the day cream and has nearly identical ingredients.</li>
      <li>Because of how similar all of these products are, if you&#x27;re going to buy anything from the 1000 Roses line (which I highly recommend for people with redness of the skin), I recommend just buying the Cleansing Foam, a moisturizer or one of the moisturizers with SPF if you have dry skin or need it, and/or the exfoliator if you get problems with clogged pores.</li>

      <li>Try this kit and you will be hooked if you have dry skin - the fact that its also for sensitive skin can&#x27;t hurt either!</li>
      <li>It picks up some of the dirt which my face wash leaves behind (I use the Andalou Clarity face wash), which surprised me because my face feels extremely clean after using face wash.</li>
      <li>Using these products for a few days made me realize that these aren&#x27;t really gentle on sensitive, dry winter skin.</li>

    <li> Thought this would be good for my sensitive dry face. But it dried out my face.</li>
    <li> A great way to try products. Wish all companies offered the chance to try first. Andalou is so good.</li>
    <li> Loved the product and fast shipping :) Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Great products, the scent of roses is so beautiful.  I will explore their other lines for specific needs to my 40+ sensitive combination skin needs.</li>
    <li> I love this line! I was already using the foaming face wash. In this kit I got to try the toner which is great-I&#x27;ve purchased the full size of it too! I also really like the day and night lotions don&#x27;t love the pearl exfoliator but the rest of the products are fantastic!  You can get them on sale periodically at whole foods as well.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin and I&#x27;m also pale with mild rosacea. When I wake up in the morning my face is in the pale and I have no redness, but throughout the day my face gradually becomes pink and feels slightly irritated. This kit has helped a LOT with it. The products feel very cooling and hydrating and clear up any redness. This kit comes with 5 products and I&#x27;ll rate each one:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pearl Exfoliator: This is very gentle on sensitive skin; several other exfoliators which I&#x27;ve used make my face red afterwards because they&#x27;re too abrasive. This exfoliator, however, gets all of the dead skin cells off and gets dirt out of pores very well but it also soothes irritation and doesn&#x27;t hurt the skin. I feel like this is the most useful product in their kit. 5/5&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Floral Toner: Their toner works very well. I&#x27;ve noticed many toners tend to dry out my skin, but this one doesn&#x27;t (unless I use way too much; you only need a few drops on a cotton ball, don&#x27;t completely saturate it). It picks up some of the dirt which my face wash leaves behind (I use the Andalou Clarity face wash), which surprised me because my face feels extremely clean after using face wash. It gets rid of any additional oil, but it doesn&#x27;t strip away so much oil that it would leave your skin dry. 5/5&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rosewater Gel Mask: The mask is basically a moisturizing mask which you would leave on for 10-15 minutes. It doesn&#x27;t dry harshly or anything, works well. 5/5&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Day Dream: Very hydrating, soothes irriation. 5/5&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Night Cream: Very hydrating, soothes irriation. However, it&#x27;s much more expensive than the day cream and has nearly identical ingredients. If you look at their website all of the Active Ingredients are the same, and many of the other ingredients are the same. 5/5 in the kit, but for the item alone without the kit it&#x27;s price makes it a 4/5.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another important factor to keep in mind with this entire kit, and the entire 1000 Roses line, is that they all have the same Key Ingredients which you can see on their website. This isn&#x27;t the case with any of their other lines; for all of their other lines (Brightening, Age Defying, Clarifying) the specific products like Exfoliators, Moisturizers, and Cleansers might share one or two Key Ingredients which give the line&#x27;s purported benefit, but they will also have one or two active ingredients which are different. I like the 1000 Roses line because it does an amazing job with reducing redness, however since all of the products in the line are so similar to each other I have to give their kit a 4/5. The mask, day, and night moisturizers are all so similar that I feel they should have given a cleanser, moisturizer, and exfoliator in this kit. Because of how similar all of these products are, if you&#x27;re going to buy anything from the 1000 Roses line (which I highly recommend for people with redness of the skin), I recommend just buying the Cleansing Foam, a moisturizer or one of the moisturizers with SPF if you have dry skin or need it, and/or the exfoliator if you get problems with clogged pores.

    <li> This is a very nice kit. May purchase another kit in the near future. Very pleased with these products.</li>
    <li> I love these little travel sized/sample sized kits. It lets you really explore products and how your skin reacts to them. I would repurchase the 1,000 Roses Mask, the Heavenly Night Cream, and the Rose Exfoliater. The toner and the daytime moisturizer didn&#x27;t really get along with my skin. The moisturizer actually caused my redness to inflame and sting. The toner didn&#x27;t seem to do much.</li>
    <li> Works great I ordered the toner, cleanser ad the moisturizer. Very happy with the way my skin looks and feels.&lt;br /&gt;I tried the Age-defying daily defense kit but found that it irritated my skin.</li>
    <li> Samples are too small for the price.</li>
    <li> I love this line - I bought this kit as a gift to share with a friend. All of the products in the 1000 Roses line are excellent - you can&#x27;t go wrong with such good technology at a reasonable price. Try this kit and you will be hooked if you have dry skin - the fact that its also for sensitive skin can&#x27;t hurt either! Love!</li>
    <li> Great price for trial size. Despite the small sizes of the products they last a long time! Great way to try out the line and I will be purchasing full sizes when I run out of these. Very happy customer!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m glad I purchased this instead of buying all full sizes, I&#x27;m not a big fan of these products. My 51 year old face needs moisturization and calm. Using these products for a few days made me realize that these aren&#x27;t really gentle on sensitive, dry winter skin. Maybe it&#x27;s better for more oily skin.

    <li> I ordered this set to try out the line after sampling it at some organic store. I have very sensitive skin and most of commercial and many organic products cause a reaction. I tried so many products I was ready to give up when I stumbled upon this. Surprisingly, Andalou products not only feel great on the skin, but also smell just wonderfully, without a hint of chemicals. I ended up buying a few creams for me and my mom, and they all worked out great. This set is awesome to travel with - it would last at least a week of non-stop use. I&#x27;m really happy with my purchase!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great line. You can&#x27;t lose. The rose scent is not overpowering. Very subtle. I have very sensitive skin and this line is very gentle on my face.</li>
    <li> I really like these.  The mask is my favorite.  My skin felt soft and moist after using.  I love the wonderful smell of roses.  My skin is very sensitive and so far it has not reacted.  I have tried several other Andalou lines and like them as well...but love the roses!</li>
