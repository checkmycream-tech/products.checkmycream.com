    <li> Putting extensions in for the first time I was a bit nervous ordering these beads for the first time since I wasn&#x27;t sure how well they would work. I tend to like to actually see what it is I am buying especially when it comes to the product being put in other people&#x27;s hair. I was completely happy that I bought these, they worked out well and they went over and above my expectations.</li>
    <li> Good product. Does the job for what we are using it for. The colors were a little off but still like the product.</li>
    <li> just what I needed. as pictured, as expected. in all, I cant complain. i am very happy. thank you very much!</li>
    <li> These are great quality, great color to match my blonde extensions and existing hair.  Lost only one silicone layer from one bead, otherwise great condition.</li>
    <li> Great value for the price.  The ones at Sally&#x27;s are $17.00 for 100 and have NO silicone to protect the hair on the inside.  These ones do.  Very Happy.  My hairdresser wants the web addtess.</li>
    <li> not all were the same type of beads, and not all had silicone but I still could use most of them</li>
    <li> Who wahts to buy 200 and get 108??&lt;br /&gt;these beads work great but you get more cheaper from ali express!</li>
    <li> Excellent hold hair well, match hair well no brakrage of hair I love and rate all the beads 5 stars just need my last order asap!</li>
    <li> Very fast shipping and very accurate product description.</li>
    <li> The beads came promptly. The were a bit larger than I expected but when I used them with my extension they worked great.</li>
    <li> These actually blend much better with my hair color than and of the other silicon rings that I&#x27;ve gotten in the past and are very durable too. They came fast and were so worth it.</li>
    <li> these beads to small and they didn&#x27;t hold in hair. I don&#x27;t think id buy again from here. thank you</li>
    <li> These are great. They match my hair color and you can&#x27;t see them when they are in my hair. They stay in until they grow out</li>
    <li> Held extentions in well.  Like the non slip in the bead that helps hair extension stay in.  Will order this product again.</li>
    <li> Just what I needed! This is for my blonde days and can not be seen! Blends good with the extension.</li>
    <li> i will always order my beads through this company. i am very happy. beads are great and just how i pictured them when i ordered them. they are pretty strong beads. not cheaply made.</li>
    <li> Man, these little guys are well worth the small price. Made solid yet dont break your hair when tightened. I will buy these everytime.</li>
    <li> I am a hairdresser and these silicone lined beads are the only things I will put in my hair or my clients. They take a while to arrive...but totally worth it.</li>
    <li> some clear pieces came out from the inside and once crimped the paint came offbut im blondeso its not that noticeable.did their job took a while for shipping to Michigan.if I wasn&#x27;t in a rush I may buy again.</li>
    <li> Metal and silicone comes apart too easily. Ended up tossing most of them.</li>
    <li> Mine were in good shape (not separated that I could notice but I didn&#x27;t inspect them all.) I tested out a few by cutting some pink hair off a wig in unnoticable places underneath and hot glued the small sections at the top to make a small tip, (about the size of a small feather shaft.) I rolled it between my fingers to make it pointy and thin and also to help all the hair adhere--I used a cooler hot glue so as not to melt the hair or burn my fingers. I used a piece of fishing line to thread my hair into the bead and pushed the tip of the hair extension into the bead and clamped. It would definitely be easier to have someone else do it but I was able to do it myself. The only problem I had is I put them too high up on my head and they are visible so I will have to put them lower in my hairline next time, but that is user error not product error, just something to keep in mind when you put yours in. I washed my hair right after and the hair pieces stayed in. I was also able to remove one by squeezing the bead the other way and it came out easily. I bought these so I could try adding fun stuff to my hair (colors, feathers, etc) and be able to remove them easily. They are cheap and it&#x27;s easier to remove than dying my hair. I&#x27;m happy with my purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit*** I wanted to comment on the durability. I had the extensions in for about a week before some of them started falling out. Some of my pink wig hair fell out, which may be the fault of the extension itself. After two weeks 3 of the 4 beads came all the way out. I&#x27;m not sure if that is normal for these type of beads but wanted to share my experience.</li>
    <li> They took some time getting to me, but I still use them. I like.</li>
