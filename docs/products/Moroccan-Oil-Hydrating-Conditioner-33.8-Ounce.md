      <li>and they explained that the item was under review and that Amazon could not longer fulfill these orders, but that I was free to purchase it via a third party seller, which I will</li>
      <li>It leaves my hair very moisturized and with goo &amp;#34;slip&amp;#34; as they say.</li>
      <li>Otherwise delivery was fast.  </li>
      <li>The smell is so very fragrant.</li>
      <li>The top came unscrewed and a little came out of the bottle</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m 99% sure this is not genuine Moroccan Oil conditioner</li>
      <li>After one use my hair is so soft!</li>
      <li>I love this product for my thick hair.</li>
      <li>I have very thick/coarse and long hair.  </li>

    <li> Great Product !! The Best Conditioner I&#x27;ve ever used !!! I would recommend this to everyone !!! Thanks for your awesome service !!!</li>
    <li> This conditioner smells great and works great.  I have very thick/coarse and long hair.  This conditioner helps control frizzies and makes my hair smooth.</li>
    <li> The BEST conditioner and it smells amazing</li>
    <li> Awesome product paired with the shampoo.</li>
    <li> I only use Moroccanoil products for my hair.&lt;br /&gt;The best product on the market! I will never use anything else in my hair. I have long, thick, frizzy &amp; wavy hair. I use Moroccanoil shampoo, conditioner, original oil serum, glimmer shine spray and once a week hair mask. I always receive compliments on my hair and I don&#x27;t have any frizz even after 10 years of flat ironing &amp; blow drying my hair.</li>
    <li> Love this product!  Use it daily.  It&#x27;s the best detangling conditioner I&#x27;ve ever used!</li>
    <li> I ordered this product and it is not what is advertised.  the company sent me the &amp;#34;repair&#x27; version or Moroccan Oil conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;Be Careful!</li>
    <li> My hair is thick, so I think that this conditioner is perfect for hair that&#x27;s not course. Otherwise delivery was fast.  I&#x27;m sticking with the heavier formula, moisture repair conditioner by Motoccanoil!</li>
    <li> I love this product for my thick hair. The smell is so very fragrant. A little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 99% sure this is not genuine Moroccan Oil conditioner but is instead a different brand poured into the bottle.  I have been using Moroccan oil products for years and this does not have the same scent or thickness to it.  Not satisfied!</li>
    <li> I love the smell and how it makes my hair feel.. Very happy with the service and fast shipping.</li>
    <li> This product works great on curly hair . I give it five stars</li>
    <li> So the PRODUCT itself is wonderful for my coarse and relaxed hair. I love the way it smells. It leaves my hair very moisturized and with goo &amp;#34;slip&amp;#34; as they say. I would repurchase ad infinitum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HOWEVER, there was a problem with picking in the warehouse, because the first time I ordered this product I received it no problem. The second time I ordered it, I received the 33.8 oz of the Moisture Repair conditioner, which I already own. It is a DIFFERENT product. It contains protein (hence the &amp;#34;repair&amp;#34; bit) and is not something I can use every day. So I did an exchange and today I received, as an exchange the Moisture Repair SHAMPOO. Needless to say, I was less than thrilled.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I called Amazon and they explained that the item was under review and that Amazon could not longer fulfill these orders, but that I was free to purchase it via a third party seller, which I will do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Happy accidents, however as I will be keeping the shampoo to try, since it is sulfate free.</li>
    <li> Great product !!  Leaves your hair smelling beautiful.</li>
    <li> My daughter loves all of the Moroccan products.  I buy them for her all the time.</li>
    <li> This product smells great and works great on thick tangly hair.</li>
    <li> Hair feels so silky &amp; the smell is delicious. It&#x27;s not too heavy either. I&#x27;ll buy this again most definitely</li>
    <li> So excited to be able to buy moroccanoil online from amazon (not another seller on amazon but amazon.com), and it&#x27;s the real deal. The top came unscrewed and a little came out of the bottle but it was sealed in own bag so it wasn&#x27;t too bad. Love moroccanoil products, and this is such a good price in bulk! After one use my hair is so soft! Will be purchasing again :)</li>
    <li> Love the product but the pump mechanism was broken into 4 pieces when I got it</li>
    <li> This is a really good conditioner and it is really a good price. I was buying it from my hairdresser who was charging $22.00 for 8 OUNCES- do the math- this is a lot, lot cheaper!</li>
    <li> Love this and the price was great</li>
    <li> Nice conditioner that has gone a long way for my semi-short hair.  Worth every penny.  Was a BIG jug!</li>
