      <li>I really love this product.  </li>
      <li>And in fact, I find my humidifier works much better than this</li>
      <li>I love this product, and I&#x27;ve been trying a lot of lotions etc.</li>
      <li>Use it over Skinceuticals C E Ferulic for grand results.  </li>
      <li>Gel is protecting my skin even more.</li>
      <li>I would recommend using with a daily moisturizer to keep your skin feeling great!</li>
      <li>I am 37 and more than pleased with how my skin looks for my age.  </li>
      <li>This fit the bill for me!</li>
      <li>This product more than any other makes my face feel like happy skin to be in!</li>
      <li>excellent for very dry skin patches and also to help with healing and inflammation of pimples/sores.  </li>
      <li>My skin has a healthy glow and feels smooth.</li>
      <li>I picked this because all of the professional reviews I could find, and I&#x27;ve done my homework on them, that indicate that the 2 together do great things for skin.</li>
      <li>THE RESULTS WILL START RIGHT AWAY !!</li>
      <li>On the plus side, it absorbs easily and has no oily residue.</li>
      <li>I can put it on under suncreen, moisturizer, and makeup and everything goes on smoothly over it.</li>
      <li>As a woman, over 55, who needs super light and super cushion for arthritic knees.  </li>
      <li>I would not however use this alone to hydrate, it just absorbs so quickly and does not give me hydrated feeling.</li>
      <li>It starts to quickly absorb on my fingertips before I start rubbing it in on my face.  </li>
      <li>It spreads easy and you don&#x27;t need to use much.</li>
      <li>My skin has always been very sensitive so that I never was able to wear any type of moisturizer or foundation on it.</li>
      <li>Makes your skin look great and feels great-you can see the difference after 1 application; but a little pricey.</li>
      <li>I purchased the samples (cheaper) to see if I liked the product before purchasing the regular size.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a plus when you can keep the product as fresh as you can.   </li>
      <li>worth every penny...</li>
      <li>When I start to rub it in, it is absorbed pretty quickly.  </li>
      <li>I tried it out for a while and found that it works amazingly well at hydrating my dry, flaky skin.</li>
      <li>However, if I don&#x27;t use this &#x27;water&#x27; before I go to sleep, I cannot find any difference at all.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a waste of money buying these &#x27;water&#x27;, drinking more water and using humidifier works much much better.</li>
      <li>What a good deal in this sample size, and a little goes a looong way.</li>
      <li>The price of the small bottles compared to the large is a great value.  </li>
      <li>I love that Skinceuticals makes travel bottles, makes easier when carrying several Skinceutical products.  </li>
      <li>YOU CAN ACTUALLY FEEL IT WORK ITS MAGIC.</li>
      <li>Nice and light, not heavy like other moisturizers.</li>
      <li>Also it&#x27;s good to buy the travel size as you don&#x27;t have to leave all of it open like the regular size one.  </li>
      <li>I would really recommend this product to everyone.  </li>
      <li>My dermatalogist really recommends Skinceuticals.</li>
      <li>(so it takes a couple of times of applying drops and dabbing) and then quickly, gently rub it in so that everything gets covered.  </li>
      <li>The gel is certainly easily applied and goes a long way.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend.</li>
      <li>All you need is a few drops to enhance your moisterizer that goes on top.</li>
      <li>I washed my face, put on toner, put about 4-5 drops of this B5 gel all over my face and followed that with a normal moisturizer.  </li>
      <li>I am a more mature individual and I can tell a big difference in my skin tone, pores and spots.</li>
      <li>You can keep the rest of them fresh which you can&#x27;t do with the regular size one.  </li>
      <li>This is a new product for my wife and she likes it.</li>
      <li>Love the small travel size bottles.</li>
      <li>Essential first layer of hydration for any skin.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not left with a slick or oily or silky feeling - actually kind of nothing.  </li>
      <li>I was pleasantly surprised by the changes in my aging skin after using the product for a month or so...........</li>
      <li>I have read about this combo and regimen from a few different reputable sources.  </li>
      <li>I recently went to Las Vegas which is super dry</li>
      <li>Even if it is not exactly equivalent, the discount is totally worth it.</li>
      <li>I have very very dry, sensitive skin, along with rosacea.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Can&#x27;t say I see a huge difference, but I like the product and the price was great so I will continue using it and will likely buy it again.  The price of the small bottles compared to the large is a great value.  Even if it is not exactly equivalent, the discount is totally worth it. Very glad I found this option.</li>
    <li> This product was recommended by a dermatologist for hydration. I have oily skin and like this gel a lot. One little bottle will last few days!</li>
    <li> This stuff is great. Essential first layer of hydration for any skin. I love it.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for a month now and my skin has got smoother, softer, and supple.  I would really recommend this product to everyone.  I really love this product.  Also it&#x27;s good to buy the travel size as you don&#x27;t have to leave all of it open like the regular size one.  You can keep the rest of them fresh which you can&#x27;t do with the regular size one.  It&#x27;s a plus when you can keep the product as fresh as you can.   Worth it!!!!</li>
    <li> I mix 3 drops of the B5 Gel with 4 drops of the Skinceuticals AOX 20 serum for amazing results as recommended by my aesthetician!! Love the Skinceuticals line!</li>
    <li> omg it is the best skin moisturizer ive ever used-worth every penny will repurchase!!!!! took years off my face its amazing</li>
    <li> Another great product in this line.  I use about 5 products constantly from the line. This gel feels wonderful day or night. 1st thing I put on face after washing</li>
    <li> As a woman, over 55, who needs super light and super cushion for arthritic knees.  This fit the bill for me!</li>
    <li> I use this at night after cleaning my skin with my Clarisonic brush and using Canyon Ranch Spa Moisturizing lotion and noticed an immediate improvement in my skin overnight. My skin has a healthy glow and feels smooth.</li>
    <li> This is a new product for my wife and she likes it. It spreads easy and you don&#x27;t need to use much. The seller is slow to deliver, so allow a lot of time.</li>
    <li> Nice product.  Use it over Skinceuticals C E Ferulic for grand results.  Smoothes out the skin surface and gives a nice base upon which to apply your next round of age-defying product.  What a good deal in this sample size, and a little goes a looong way.</li>
    <li> The gel is certainly easily applied and goes a long way. I&#x27;m just not sure what I&#x27;m getting out of using it. On the plus side, it absorbs easily and has no oily residue. On the con side, I don&#x27;t see any change in my skin.</li>
    <li> This gel is THE BEST hydrator for my skin. I have very very dry, sensitive skin, along with rosacea. My derm recommended this and gave me some samples. I tried it out for a while and found that it works amazingly well at hydrating my dry, flaky skin. It also goes on and absorbs instantly, with absolutely no oily-ness or greasy-ness. I can put it on under suncreen, moisturizer, and makeup and everything goes on smoothly over it. I love it!</li>
    <li> Makes your skin look great and feels great-you can see the difference after 1 application; but a little pricey. There are a couple other products from skinceuticals I would recommend to spend money on before the B5 gel</li>
    <li> That is great product. I like it. I use it twice a day, then never feel dry again. I think I will continue to use.</li>
    <li> I know the title doesn&#x27;t wow, but I&#x27;m not sure what to make of this yet.  I am using this after application of the CE Ferulic.  I don&#x27;t personally find this as hydrating as I would a cream or lotion.  I picked this because all of the professional reviews I could find, and I&#x27;ve done my homework on them, that indicate that the 2 together do great things for skin. Not sure I&#x27;d stick with it on it&#x27;s own for just hydrating purposes.      It starts to quickly absorb on my fingertips before I start rubbing it in on my face.  I dab a few drops on my finger tips, dab those little drops all over my face (so it takes a couple of times of applying drops and dabbing) and then quickly, gently rub it in so that everything gets covered.  When I start to rub it in, it is absorbed pretty quickly.  I&#x27;m not left with a slick or oily or silky feeling - actually kind of nothing.  No problems at all with the product and I do plan on using this with the CE Ferulic for some time to come as I already have nice skin for 36 and would like to keep it that way.    1/1/2011 UPDATE: Still using this with the CE Ferulic. No problems at all. I use this combo in the AM under sunscreen, while using a retinol (SkinCeuticals) and an anti-ox (Revale Skin) at night. I have read about this combo and regimen from a few different reputable sources.  I am 37 and more than pleased with how my skin looks for my age.  *I would not however use this alone to hydrate, it just absorbs so quickly and does not give me hydrated feeling. My skin feels just as dry as it did before I put it on.  I look to a moisterizer for hydration.</li>
    <li> Live in the Midwest and this product kept my face flake free through the cold season.  It&#x27;s not greasy at all I would recommend using with a daily moisturizer to keep your skin feeling great!</li>
    <li> I am in the process of changing the skin care products I use. My dermatalogist really recommends Skinceuticals. I am a more mature individual and I can tell a big difference in my skin tone, pores and spots. Plus I know that under my sunscreen Hydrating B5  Gel is protecting my skin even more. Expensive but worth it. We all desire to treat our skin with care no matter what age we are.</li>
    <li> excellent for very dry skin patches and also to help with healing and inflammation of pimples/sores.  a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> I use this stuff in conjunction with the Skinceuticals Phloretin CF and love it. My skin has always been very sensitive so that I never was able to wear any type of moisturizer or foundation on it. Now I just use 1 drop of this stuff every morning and every evening and I&#x27;m done. My face looks younger and have no issues with breakouts at all. Very good stuff!</li>
    <li> THIS PRODUCT IS THE BEST PICK ME UP FOR YOUR SKIN! YOU CAN ACTUALLY FEEL IT WORK ITS MAGIC. JUST TRY IT BECAUSE THATS ALL YOU WILL HAVE TO DO!! THE RESULTS WILL START RIGHT AWAY !!</li>
    <li> I love this product, and I&#x27;ve been trying a lot of lotions etc. lately. This product more than any other makes my face feel like happy skin to be in! I&#x27;ll finally get the same item for my next order. Whew!</li>
    <li> I have used it for two weeks, and find no difference on my skin. And in fact, I find my humidifier works much better than this product.&lt;br /&gt;I tried to not using humidifier during the night, and find obvious difference on my face in the next morning. However, if I don&#x27;t use this &#x27;water&#x27; before I go to sleep, I cannot find any difference at all.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a waste of money buying these &#x27;water&#x27;, drinking more water and using humidifier works much much better.</li>
    <li> I purchased the samples (cheaper) to see if I liked the product before purchasing the regular size.  I love that Skinceuticals makes travel bottles, makes easier when carrying several Skinceutical products.  I use CF, CE, and B6.  It has taken the redness out of my face - No more foundation for me.  As a plus, you can share a bottle with a friend or two.  My friends loved them too and purchased all 3.</li>
    <li> I use this in combination with Skinceutical Phytocorrective gel and CE ferulic acid serum and follow it up with B5 and I&#x27;m good to go.</li>
    <li> I was pleasantly surprised by the changes in my aging skin after using the product for a month or so...........I like the skinceutical&#x27;s  product line but this exceeded my expectations</li>
    <li> Great moisturizing product.  Nice and light, not heavy like other moisturizers. I was a bit disappointed because the sample bottles are really small, even though the overall size (6 X5ml) equals to one large bottle. But I would definitely recommend the product!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this line for years and I love it.  I esp. like these small bottles.  They are great for travel.</li>
    <li> Great B5 gel for hydration.  I recently went to Las Vegas which is super dry (it&#x27;s the desert).  I washed my face, put on toner, put about 4-5 drops of this B5 gel all over my face and followed that with a normal moisturizer.  The results were amazing!!  My face was taunt and glowing.  Felt so supple to the touch.  These tiny travel size bottles are perfect for the weekend trip.  I will order again.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> This is a great product.  Love it. I would order this again in the future.  Love the small travel size bottles.</li>
    <li> Great part of my skin regimen and I love the travel size bottles for travel on airplanes. These 6 bottles last a long time. All you need is a few drops to enhance your moisterizer that goes on top.</li>
    <li> worth every penny...a must try,excellent hydration,great for dry skin.good after a chemical peel...goes on like silk.give it a try..very pleased</li>
