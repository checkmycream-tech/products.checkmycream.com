      <li>I bought this one time and it worked fast!</li>

      <li>I really enjoy using this face wash and recommend to anyone with super sensitive skin or other gingers alike.</li>
      <li>Works great so far, only a few weeks.</li>
      <li>I need something to scrub my face clean from a long day at work.  </li>
      <li>I used the GEL form of this wash (same exact, just gel form) and it worked like a charm!</li>
      <li>I really like the scrub action part which gets all the oil away.</li>
      <li>It really did clear my skin up within a day.</li>
      <li>Everyone is different, it&#x27;s all about finding the right product to suit your needs.</li>

      <li>I&#x27;m 20 yr old male with mild acne , this is the only product i use on my face day and night.</li>

      <li>I use it mainly at nights after a long day.</li>
      <li>I also live in a hot country and that doesn&#x27;t help, but with this my nose was less oily, my forehead seemed tighter and my PORES were smaller.</li>
      <li>Since I have extra oily skin (and sensitive</li>
      <li>Your skin may get worse before it gets better as it takes a pimples about 2 weeks to fully erupt, so those have to come through but the scrub will work to diminish the size and severity.</li>

    <li> I don&#x27;t consider myself to have acne, rather occasional pimples with an annoying redness factor.  I used the GEL form of this wash (same exact, just gel form) and it worked like a charm! Overnight my pimples look smaller, are less painful, and practically disappeared after a couple uses!  Will be purchasing this again!</li>
    <li> This is a nice scrub not over drying. I use it mainly at nights after a long day. Probably use like four night out of the week. I would not reccomend using it in mornings and eves. You should have a gentler one. But definately not harsh. It really does help with acne.</li>
    <li> Really and cool and awesome</li>
    <li> This wash is amazing!! Only used twice , I had a couple annoying pimples on my face which as I&#x27;m due to go on holiday&lt;br /&gt;Made me extremely insecure and stressed so as I dashed out to the shops for a quick remedy to rid me of these and to keep them at bay I pondered upon this beauty it feels quite harsh on the skin when scrubbing but feels incredibly good once washed off and patted dry , woke up this morning and instantly reached for this again my skin is not only clearer it feels and looks incredible too so big thumbs up !!</li>
    <li> This product is good for every day use. Keeps acne away on one daily use. Better than other products. Will buy another one soon</li>
    <li> I started using this product about 2 weeks ago and it&#x27;s made such a difference in my skin. It&#x27;s 90% cleared up now and I haven&#x27;t had a new pimple in about a week. Your skin may get worse before it gets better as it takes a pimples about 2 weeks to fully erupt, so those have to come through but the scrub will work to diminish the size and severity. I almost wish I took before and after pictures but I&#x27;m too happy with the results to turn back now. This also didn&#x27;t dry my skin nearly as bad as others have and I use it in the moring and at night before I go to bed. Everyone is different, it&#x27;s all about finding the right product to suit your needs. This just happened to be the right one for me. Thank you Clearasil, you&#x27;ve really helped in controlling my acne.</li>
    <li> Smells good. Cleans Well.   I use it in the shower and I absolutely love it.   I feel like my face has cleared up substantially after using this for about a month.</li>
    <li> This is the most helpful product that I have ever tried to combat my acne. Its so much less time consuming then other prudcts because you just wash your face; no other steps required.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; A couple tips that have helped me is washing your hands before using this on your face, scrubbing in a circular motion, and using three times a day has had the best results for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good luck!!</li>
    <li> My youngest daughter likes this face scrub. It has help to clear up her face. Though she uses it daily, the tube does last for a couple of weeks.</li>
    <li> It decreased the appearance of my blackheads and made my skin smoother, i highly recommend this product</li>
    <li> Closest to the discontinued Pernox.</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin as I am a ginger and most soaps don&#x27;t do well on my pastly white face. I usually get breakouts with a lot of other soaps as well. This cleans my face and prevents breakouts but the big plus is doesn&#x27;t dry me out. I really enjoy using this face wash and recommend to anyone with super sensitive skin or other gingers alike.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried everything pro activ, clean n clear, etc etc... Since I have extra oily skin (and sensitive I might add) nothing worked like clearasil. It&#x27;s cheaper than most products I have tried and definitely smells better. I&#x27;ve been using it on a daily basis and not only are the &amp;#34;break outs&amp;#34; vanishing my skin has a much cleaner and shinier appearance. I&#x27;m in love with this face wash, I would recommend it to anyone with oily skin!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 20 yr old male with mild acne , this is the only product i use on my face day and night. Be gentle when using it don&#x27;t rub so hard.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 32 years old and for some reason, my body decided to re-live its awkward, humiliating teenage years all over again and I&#x27;ve been breaking out along my jaw line and chin (the Chinese say that breaking out in these areas mean hormone and digestive imbalances, respectively). But its those deep down, painful red monsters that make me want to convert to Islam just to have an excuse to cover my face. I&#x27;ve tried all the fancy department store products to cater to my ego, and hopefully my skin too, but none of them can even hold a candle to this product. It really did clear my skin up within a day. So I wrote this review to spread the Gospel of Clearasil, so others can be saved from a lifetime of torment and weeping and gnashing of teeth trying to battle the ruthless acne monster. The good news is here! Convert to Clearasil, and live a lifetime of peace with your skin. Amen.</li>
    <li> I have had acne since I was little, but this product along with a Clearasil facial wash (to help reduce acne marks) and a topical lotion are my dream team! I have been using Clearasil since January 2015 and I won&#x27;t change my regimen for any other product. Would recommend others to try facial scrub along with a facial wash, (toner), and topical lotion to combat acne, and acne marks for an even tone, texture, and refreshed looking skin!</li>
    <li> I hate this product a lot.  It doesn&#x27;t foam well.  I find my skin felt dirty after application.</li>
    <li> The product worked and cleared acne but u have to use it two times a day and u can never miss a day.    So as long as u use it properly u will see results</li>
    <li> Being in the construction industry in the desert.  I need something to scrub my face clean from a long day at work.  This stuffs works.</li>
    <li> This product has been the most helpful for my acne problem than all of the others I have tried. If you are looking for a skin care helper that won&#x27;t dry your face out, this is it. It only takes a small amount to work so the tube will last quite awhile.</li>
    <li> When i got this product it started out amazing for a couple of months and then it started to stress my skin so i changed to clean &amp; clear</li>
    <li> I bought the everyday facial cleanser initially, but i wanted something stronger because my face is always unresponsive to most treatments. Im in my late 20&#x27;s and my pores have begun to be an issue, enough so that my make up melts off my nose after a few hours. I used this before i went out and applied make up, and though it didn&#x27;t stay as long i could definitely tell i was A LOT less oily than before. I also live in a hot country and that doesn&#x27;t help, but with this my nose was less oily, my forehead seemed tighter and my PORES were smaller. If your pores are visible, this is a good product to use in the long run.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! I haven&#x27;t bought it from amazon before but I love it so much I wanted to leave a review anyway! I bought this one time and it worked fast! After that I tried some other products and they didn&#x27;t work nearly as well as this. I always use this now. My face feels so soft and clean after using this and with only a few uses I can notice a difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everyone&#x27;s skin is different though. This may not work for everyone, but I would recommend trying it out :)</li>
    <li> Great stuff, especially when mixed with Sulfur Ointment.</li>
    <li> I used Clearasil for years then switched products for a short time. My acne got bad so I switched back to Clearasil. I discovered that I have very sensitive skin. When I used the product I broke out is a huge rash all over my face. I have been visiting the dermatologist, but still have the rash 8 months later. If you have sensitive skin I would be careful using this product. I suggest trying it on a little spot and testing to see how your skin reacts.</li>
    <li> My sister and I have been using Clearasil Ultra face scrub in the shower for years. It is just one piece of the pie in my skin treatment plan. I don&#x27;t know how effective it is alone, but along with everything else I&#x27;m taking, clearasil has helped keep my skin crystal clear. I can of course attribute this to finding the perfect combination of meds, ointments, and washes, but I do think Clearasil is one of the best scrubs out there. The beads leave my face feeling exfoliated and clean. Expensive, but so are most other washes</li>
    <li> I have been using only this product for about two weeks now and if anything, I&#x27;m breaking out more. I hardly ever break out and I randomly started to this month, so this is the first product I&#x27;ve tried. It doesn&#x27;t seem to work for me.</li>
    <li> This facial wash is great. I am currently in a very polluted area and my face has been breaking out because the air quality is so bad, but this facial wash fixed that. I use it 2-3 times a day and it does not dry out my skin either. A little goes a long way. I&#x27;ll be buying this when I return to the States as well.</li>
    <li> My girlfriend loves this stuff and says that it really works.</li>
    <li> the cream was expire i dint work i break out everytime i use it bad waste of money i would never buy it again i dont recomend this product</li>
    <li> Works really well.  Every since I&#x27;ve used this product, My face stays clean and no oil or pimples.  I use it once a day in the shower and have been using it for about 5 years now.  It&#x27;s absolutely fantastic and I don&#x27;t have any facial issues.  Great product.  I really like the scrub action part which gets all the oil away.</li>
    <li> this is one of the best acne scrubs I&#x27;ve ever used! but I must say the texture is very ruff! but besides that this is a great scrub! say goodbye to acne within 2-3 uses!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a month and more, and my skin isn&#x27;t clearer! It&#x27;s exactly the same! It says clearer skin in 12 hours, but that&#x27;s just a lie! You want clear skin, use oxy pads or x-out</li>
    <li> Works great so far, only a few weeks. Hopefully the results will be even better after a couple of months.</li>
    <li> Replacing Pernox which is not being made, not nearly as good as Pernox, but much cheaper.</li>
</ol>
