      <li>and I love Burt&#x27;s Bees products.</li>

      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried so many soaps and shampoos over the years</li>

      <li>It&#x27;s not an oily or greasy feel, just a healthy feel.</li>
      <li>While you may appear to have more volume along the roots of your hair, the strands themselves are lifeless and dull.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I love this shampoo.  </li>
      <li>i love it</li>
      <li>Excellent shampoo, in short.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t remember how many.  </li>
      <li>I stuck with it for a month, hoping for better results.</li>
      <li>It smelled good and left my hair looking great but bothered my scalp and made it itch.</li>
      <li>Love love love the shampoo and conditioner.</li>
      <li>I love Burt&#x27;s Bees products and I use them often.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a guy with really fine hair, and I just haven&#x27;t really ever been happy with most of my shampoos that I&#x27;ve used.</li>
      <li>My hair shines &amp; is nice &amp; full</li>
      <li>Nice mild smell that doesn&#x27;t overwhelm you or stay with you.</li>
      <li>And it&#x27;s not always easy to find.</li>
      <li>However, Dr. Bronner&#x27;s lathers up just fine</li>
      <li>I found a bath soap that is chemical-free and afordable (Out Of Africa, also available at Amazon) and</li>
      <li>This is a sulfate free shampoo</li>
      <li>I wanted a sulfate free shampoo and accidentally bought this &#x27;volumizing&#x27; shampoo.</li>
      <li>It kind of has the consistency and color of honey, but you get a gentle foam when you rub it in your hands.</li>
      <li>strong dislike is this shampoo leaves some sort of residue because my hair feels nothing like clean.</li>
      <li>I love Burt&#x27;s Bees and I really wanted to love this shampoo, but it flat-out just stopped working for me.</li>
      <li>shampoo is gentle, lathers beautifully, cleans without stripping oil, and leaves my hair feeling very soft.  </li>
      <li>It is great for my curly hair, not heavy, leaves my hair clean and fresh without any residue.</li>
      <li>It bubbles decently and smells nice.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m pretty bummed because i do love the scent.</li>
      <li>The scent is a light, sweet citrus.</li>
      <li>I was excited about the volume and scent of my hair.</li>
      <li>I am willing to spend a bit more money on a product if the quality of ingredients and effectiveness warrants</li>
      <li>does it make my fine asian hair look good.</li>
      <li>It leaves my hair feeling clean and it adds volume.  </li>
      <li>Does not leave my hair feeling clean.</li>
      <li>/&gt;But if you use this shampoo on clean hair, it&#x27;ll do wonders.</li>
      <li>Nothing particularly special apart from that.  </li>
      <li>Smells amazing, makes hair feel fuller and soft.</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t have much of a smell but keeps my hair healthy</li>
      <li>This is true with any shampoo/conditioner/product.</li>
      <li>Burt&#x27;s Bees Very Volumizing Shampoo performs better than any I&#x27;ve tried before.</li>
      <li>I really wanted to like this, because I LOVE Burt&#x27;s Bees otherwise.</li>
      <li>The bar on the bottom of the bottle states that it is 99.6% natural, that makes me feel pretty good about using it.</li>
      <li>I have fine wavy hair, and lots of it, I don&#x27;t use conditioner (apart from the very VERY tips of my hair, like the bottom inch), and I don&#x27;t use heat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Great product to use off and on with other shampoo.  </li>
      <li>Hopefully Burt&#x27;s Bees can come up with a new shampoo that is more effective and just as natural.</li>
      <li>/&gt;This is one of the first sulfate free shampoos I have tried.</li>
      <li>I love this natural shampoo.</li>
      <li>Also, I was able to retain my natural volume without having my hair turn all frizzy.</li>
      <li>is one of those &amp;#34;no-junk&amp;#34; in the shampoos so keep in mind if this is your first time using this type of shampoo, it doesn&#x27;t suds up real well like the traditional kinds, which is good.</li>
      <li>The packaging was just right.</li>
      <li>So much so, that it doesn&#x27;t even look clean after I use it.</li>
      <li>Most of them are too drying, and most &amp;#34;moisture&amp;#34; shampoos just weigh my hair down like nobody&#x27;s business.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I love Burt&#x27;s Bees products and I use them often.</li>
    <li> I love Burt&#x27;s Bees and I really wanted to love this shampoo, but it flat-out just stopped working for me. I have been using this shampoo for about 6 months, but I had to make a switch to Dr. Bronner&#x27;s castile soap because the BB shampoo would consistently leave my hair greasy every day. I would literally have to use dry shampoo every single day because my hair would look like I hadn&#x27;t washed it in a week, even if I had just showered and washed with Burt&#x27;s Bees a few hours before. I was tired of the hassle every day so I made the switch and I am happy I did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is thin, dark, and can get pretty greasy after just a day of not washing, so maybe this shampoo would work better for someone who doesn&#x27;t have hair that gets greasy quickly. Personally, I think the formula itself is too runny too. You really have to use a lot to clean your entire scalp since it doesn&#x27;t lather (SLS free). However, Dr. Bronner&#x27;s lathers up just fine and it doesn&#x27;t contain SLS, so I&#x27;m not sure why the BB shampoo is so runny and doesn&#x27;t foam at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I honestly wouldn&#x27;t recommend it to anyone. Hopefully Burt&#x27;s Bees can come up with a new shampoo that is more effective and just as natural. I will continue to buy the company&#x27;s other products, but just not this one.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a guy with really fine hair, and I just haven&#x27;t really ever been happy with most of my shampoos that I&#x27;ve used. Most of them are too drying, and most &amp;#34;moisture&amp;#34; shampoos just weigh my hair down like nobody&#x27;s business. I don&#x27;t often use conditioner just because it&#x27;s so heavy on my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started reading into the sulfate free shampoo hype, and I tried several of them. Each bitterly disappointed me. They all left my hair feeling so greasy and heavy. I couldn&#x27;t actually get any of my product to hold in my hair after several days of using the other sulfate-free brands. I stuck with it for a month, hoping for better results. My hair just stayed greasy and unpleasant to touch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then I found this stuff. It kind of has the consistency and color of honey, but you get a gentle foam when you rub it in your hands. It goes into your hair easily, and smells really great. The best part is that after you rinse, your hair FEELS VERY CLEAN, but still feels like it has it&#x27;s natural oils. It&#x27;s not an oily or greasy feel, just a healthy feel. It&#x27;s better than normal shampoos because my hair doesn&#x27;t feel stripped or dry some days. It always feels great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some people have mentioned that it stops working after a few weeks. This is true with any shampoo/conditioner/product. You need a clarifying/deep cleaning shampoo that you use once a month or so. I use Neutrogena Clarifying shampoo once a month, and it cuts through the buildup caused by hair products and keeps your Burts Bees shampoo working great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Surprisingly, this shampoo gives incredible volume. More than my Redken Volume shampoo, and it doesn&#x27;t feel nearly as dry. I let a friend of mine use it on her long hair and she couldn&#x27;t believe how much volume it gave her. Great stuff. I&#x27;m a man and I won&#x27;t be using anything else.</li>
    <li> Uh, no. I really wanted to like this, because I LOVE Burt&#x27;s Bees otherwise. The first shampoo and conditioning was great! I was excited about the volume and scent of my hair. It&#x27;s only been downhill from there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Greasy end result: I have thin hair, and usually after 2 days of not washing, my hair will become greasy. With daily use of this shampoo, the greasiness has appeared sooner and sooner. Yesterday, as soon as I was done blow-drying my hair it looked as if I&#x27;d gone 2 days without washing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Difficult to style: Forget curling your hair, using a round brush for style, or anything. While you may appear to have more volume along the roots of your hair, the strands themselves are lifeless and dull.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair did not feel healthier, and it looks gross. At the end of showering and blow drying, I just look like I have a poofy, greasy, unstyled head of hair.</li>
    <li> It smells wonderful and my hair has loved it. I bought it with the matching conditioner as well as Burt&#x27;s Bee&#x27;s Avocado Butter and it&#x27;s been great! I do have thin, naturally curly/wavy hair though so it might not work for all types!</li>
    <li> My hair shines &amp; is nice &amp; full</li>
    <li> Excellent conditioner makes my hair shine.</li>
    <li> I have thin, straight hair and unlike other posters this DID NOT leave my hair greasy and clumpy in any way. Odds are these woman did not rinse properly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am committed to only using natural beauty and hair products and this hits the mark. I love the smell of the moisture shampoo and conditioner better, but my hair needs volume and this product delivered. I washed my hair last night, let it air dry and after an hour I looked in the mirror and WOW my hair was definitely more full.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I generally shy away from Burt&#x27;s Bees because their prices are very high, but I might stick with this shampoo and might even pick up the conditioner when I run out of my current conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have very thick or very wavy hair you may need to use more of this shampoo than average to get it worked through your hair- that would be my only concern. I have shoulder length, thin straight hair and I feel like I have to use a thin quarter sized amount of shampoo to get it worked in. With other shampoos I was able to use less. Just a consideration for others.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. Smells amazing. Works on my thick hair and got rid of product build up and doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down. I was nervous about &amp;#34;volumizing&amp;#34; but I couldn&#x27;t be happier with this product.</li>
    <li> You don&#x27;t always need mousse to add volume.  This shampoo adds it using very little out of the bottle.  I use it alone when I&#x27;m looking for a natural look with body.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t have much of a smell but keeps my hair healthy</li>
    <li> Excellent shampoo, in short. And this is the only place I can find it.</li>
    <li> Smells good but leaves my hair feeling oily.</li>
    <li> Really does make a difference in texture</li>
    <li> It smelled good and left my hair looking great but bothered my scalp and made it itch.</li>
    <li> You get volume and softness--and I have very fine, thin hair that usually gets flattened by any kind of conditioning/volumizing shampoo.</li>
    <li> The product was gentle to my hair, but it was not volumizing for me.</li>
    <li> have used this shampoo for some time now and am well pleased with the results. The price is the same I have paid in-store. And it&#x27;s not always easy to find. The packaging was just right.</li>
    <li> The best volumizing shampoo I&#x27;ve ever used and I&#x27;ve tried several over the past ten years. Burt&#x27;s Bees Very Volumizing Shampoo performs better than any I&#x27;ve tried before. Leave hair thicker feeling, smells great and also gives hair a nice shine. I would recommend this to anyone needing more volume in their hair.</li>
    <li> My hair seemed to fall even more with this one. Did not care for it at all. Wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m extremely sensitive to SLS (sodium lauryl sulfate) so I was thrilled to find this shampoo. I&#x27;ve tried so many soaps and shampoos over the years I can&#x27;t remember how many.  Even castille soap was no help.  After a shower I would have itchy places on my body that were agony, and my face was so dry and flaky nothing helped, no matter how expensive the lotion or cream.  I finally found out earlier this year that the culprit is SLS, a chemical additive that soap manufacturers use to enhance the &#x27;foaminess&#x27; of their soap.  I found a bath soap that is chemical-free and afordable (Out Of Africa, also available at Amazon) and then-halelujah!-found Burt&#x27;s Bees shampooo!  Now, after years of itchy agony and flakiness, I have no fear of my shower!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This shampoo is gentle, lathers beautifully, cleans without stripping oil, and leaves my hair feeling very soft.  I have short hair</li>
    <li> This is the best shampoo and it doesn&#x27;t have any chemicals in it. It&#x27;s just pure ingredients. It smells wonderful.</li>
    <li> This is good shampoo but I like another product better (Avalon Organics Thickening with Biotin Shampoo).</li>
    <li> I am very satisfied with this product! I&#x27;m happy that my hair looks great, clean and shiny. i love it</li>
    <li> Not only is this product not volumizing,  it&#x27;s actually adds a greasy weight to your hair. I&#x27;m normally a big fan of Burts, but this product didn&#x27;t deliver. Some things I tried to see if it would work: extra long rinse sessions, waiting to wash my hair every three days, washing my hair everyday, washing with cold instead of hot, not using the conditioner. Nope.</li>
    <li> Does not provide much volume.</li>
    <li> This is a really nice volumizing shampoo with a pleasant smell.  It may not be quite as volumizing as other shampoos formulated as a volume enhancer but the almost 100% natural ingredients make up for that fact.  I would purchase this again.</li>
    <li> For all the bad reviews out there, they&#x27;re most likely - A. not used to sulfate (and other harsh chemicals)-free shampoo, or B. not using it properly (using too much, neglecting to fully rinse, etc.).  It&#x27;s shampoo and it works like... shampoo.  It cleans and gets the job done.  Nothing particularly special apart from that.  I have fine wavy hair, and lots of it, I don&#x27;t use conditioner (apart from the very VERY tips of my hair, like the bottom inch), and I don&#x27;t use heat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want to try it, try it.  Keep the receipt.  Return it if you don&#x27;t like it.  Hopefully those with hair types similar to mine are satisfied.  Will I buy again?  Maybe, maybe not.  I gave 4 starts for doing what it&#x27;s supposed to do, but not having any other outstanding qualities.</li>
    <li> I was excited for this shampoo as I have always loves BB, but It just leaves my hair feeling heavy and looking greasy. If I wash it at night it is greasy early the next day. Normally I dont have greasy hair so this was odd to me.  I&#x27;m pretty bummed because i do love the scent.</li>
    <li> It leaves my hair greasy.</li>
    <li> I love all Burt&#x27;s Bees products!</li>
    <li> Be sure to shake the bottle before each use, I wasn&#x27;t happy with it until I started giving the bottle a good shake. It is great for my curly hair, not heavy, leaves my hair clean and fresh without any residue.</li>
    <li> What I was really looking for was the Pomengranite and Soy shampoo. I guess they don&#x27;t make that one anymore so I went with this flavor. It&#x27;s similar, but it just doesn&#x27;t feel the same.&lt;br /&gt;This is one of those &amp;#34;no-junk&amp;#34; in the shampoos so keep in mind if this is your first time using this type of shampoo, it doesn&#x27;t suds up real well like the traditional kinds, which is good. And it makes your hair feel stringy, but once it&#x27;s dry, it feel silky smooth.</li>
    <li> I really wanted to like this shampoo because I have pretty fine hair, but it left my hair feeling too greasy. Immediately after washing and drying, my hair looks weighed down and dirty as if I haven&#x27;t shampooed in days.</li>
    <li> I did a lot of web surfing to decide which &amp;#34;healthy&amp;#34; shampoo and conditioner to purchase.  The good reviews for this shampoo were not exaggerations.  It bubbles decently and smells nice.  I realize that bubbles don&#x27;t necessarily equate to clean but it&#x27;s bubbles help to make it easier to spread over your scalp.</li>
    <li> Great product to use off and on with other shampoo.  Good stuff.</li>
    <li> Great product!  Natural is the best!</li>
    <li> I appreciate Burt&#x27;s Bees mission of providing natural and sustainable beauty products. Like many others I am concerned about the amount of harmful chemicals in cosmetic and bath products. I am willing to spend a bit more money on a product if the quality of ingredients and effectiveness warrants the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is one of the first sulfate free shampoos I have tried. I have been using it for nearly a month. The bar on the bottom of the bottle states that it is 99.6% natural, that makes me feel pretty good about using it. The scent is a light, sweet citrus. The shampoo is runny and after working some through my hair I find myself grabbing the bottle and squeezing out some more. This is a sulfate free shampoo so it doesn&#x27;t lather up like the kind I&#x27;m used to. I have to make sure my hair is thoroughly wet before using, otherwise it won&#x27;t lather at all. I use it along with the conditioner (which I only use on the ends of my hair). After rinsing my hair feels soft and is easy to comb.  The main problem I have with this product is that by morning my hair feels greasy and heavy. I guess the volumizing formula is not for me. I may try another in the future.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m usually a huge fan of Burt&#x27;s Bees, but this product actually made my hair quite greasy.  So much so, that it doesn&#x27;t even look clean after I use it.</li>
    <li> Sadly, it does not give any extra volume to my hair.</li>
    <li> I love this natural shampoo. It cleans my scalp which sometimes breaks out in small pimples. With this shampoo I don&#x27;t have that problem. I also love the way it leaves my hair. . . so soft and silky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to use this shampoo and I am going to try other Bert&#x27;s Bees products because of my experience with this product.</li>
    <li> I really like Burt&#x27;s Bees other products, but this shampoo (and matching conditioner) really doesn&#x27;t work at all. My hair comes out clumpy and greasy feeling, and I have to use twice as much as I would with another shampoo or conditioner because it&#x27;s pretty watered down. I like the idea of a shampoo without all the harmful stuff in it, but this is not one I&#x27;m going to buy again.</li>
    <li> I wanted a sulfate free shampoo and accidentally bought this &#x27;volumizing&#x27; shampoo. I have thick hair to begin with and was slightly disappointed that it was the only kind available in my local supermarket. However, my disappointed ended after reading the label.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once using the shampoo, I was left with a silky shine without the normal oily buildup that comes with most &#x27;smoothing&#x27; shampoos. Also, I was able to retain my natural volume without having my hair turn all frizzy. I noticed the difference immediately after using this product. It also seemed to bring back my natural curls/waviness after being slightly damaged from professionally styled bleached highlights.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend to any friend that has thick, hard-to-manage hair. This is by far the best product I have found. I no longer need to use de-tangler spray or leave-in conditioner. In fact, after using the Burts Bee&#x27;s conditioner I can comb my wet hair with absolutely no effort, and again, no oily feeling in my hair afterwards.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know why I trusted the good reviews.  I have long and thick hair and like the extra volume any product can provide.  I have to use a very large amount of this shampoo each time I wash my hair.  Even then, it leaves my hair greasy and dirty looking.  Even my hair dresser said there is excess residue left behind on my hair that she can&#x27;t wash off easily.  It smells terrible too.  I&#x27;m disappointed in Burt&#x27;s Bees.</li>
    <li> I like this shampoo it doesn&#x27;t leave my very, fine, hair limp and brings out the shine to my hair too. Good price compared to the fancy shampoos that promise you the world. Nice mild smell that doesn&#x27;t overwhelm you or stay with you. I will buy it again.</li>
    <li> I have thin hair that looks HORRIBLE when it&#x27;s not washed. After the second use, this shampoo managed to make it look worse than &amp;#34;not washed&amp;#34;...it looked like I had just crawled out of bed after having the flu for a week...you know, when your hair is so filthy that it just sticks wherever you put it! Never again!</li>
    <li> I purchased Bert&#x27;s Bees shampoo at a local store and was excited to try it as I love their other products. I&#x27;ve been using it about a week and have found it leaves my hair greesy and stringy.  I guess it would would be good for someone with really thick dry hair, but my hair looks terrible!</li>
    <li> Love love love the shampoo and conditioner. It helps add volume to my hair.  I will purchase more of this for sure!</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo.  It does not leave my hair greasy.  It leaves my hair feeling clean and it adds volume.  I wish this was a Prime subscribe and save item.</li>
    <li> Wanted to love this, but it made my hair greasy. Yuck.</li>
    <li> I have very thick hair and this not only didn&#x27;t add any volume to it, but it feels as if it stripped all of my hair&#x27;s natural oils and it left it limp, dry, and just disgusting feeling. I was pretty disappointed, because this stuff smells good and I love Burt&#x27;s Bees products.</li>
    <li> Great product smells amazing.</li>
    <li> This shampoo is confusing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does give volume and holy moly does it make my fine asian hair look good. I kid you not, my hair is so pin straight it cannot do much and it&#x27;s long so it&#x27;s &amp;#34;heavy&amp;#34; and most the time, flat. This shampoo gives it a great volume tousled look and I have zero fly aways.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My strong dislike is this shampoo leaves some sort of residue because my hair feels nothing like clean. Even when rinsing out it feels like there is wax or some sort of build up (volumizing agent?) and it does not come out unless I shampoo with my other shampoo. So I have to alternate between my shampoos because I cannot use this shampoo more than two days straight or it just leaves a heavy feeling and the build up actually ends up making my hair look dirty and greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But if you use this shampoo on clean hair, it&#x27;ll do wonders. I MUST STYLE AFTER (W/ BLOW DRYER). When I air dry, it looks bad. If I don&#x27;t thoroughly dry, it looks bad too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have typical Chinese hair, very very thin, fine, straight and long. Not chemically treated. I brush every day, always after showering. I condition maybe 2x week. I shampoo at least every day.</li>
    <li> Definitely adds volume and is sulfite-free which is important to me.</li>
    <li> Love it. Makes my soft thin hair Act thicker.</li>
    <li> good shampoo and without sulfates so better for the hair.</li>
    <li> Received as promised and am happy with purchase.</li>
    <li> Smells amazing, makes hair feel fuller and soft.</li>
    <li> Does not leave my hair feeling clean.</li>
