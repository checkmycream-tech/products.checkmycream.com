      <li>LOVE it!</li>
      <li>Love it!</li>
      <li>But the midnotes bring together Jasmine, Rose and Tuberose.</li>
      <li>It may be one of my top alltime three.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s okay</li>
      <li>I received this as a gift and after it ran out, I wanted more.</li>
      <li>I wish to buy more bottles</li>

      <li>I love Fendi for women.</li>
      <li>I love this perfum</li>
      <li>But I love the scent</li>
      <li>but I didn&#x27;t fall in love with the bottle just the scent.</li>
      <li>, it&#x27;s just okay.</li>
      <li>I love this fragrance.  </li>
      <li>I am sure that it is just going to take getting used to.</li>
      <li>Fan di Fendi could become your favorite perfume.</li>
      <li>I had not Fendi Perfume for many years.</li>
      <li>Amaaaaaaaaaaaazing , in love with it</li>
      <li>So far so good though!</li>
      <li>And then there&#x27;s the Patchouli, with it&#x27;s own dose of candy sweet scent.  </li>
      <li>a lot of people think it&#x27;s a great scent for a young woman.</li>
      <li>The golden logo which is very important was off the bottle.</li>
      <li>Great price for the big bottle.</li>
      <li>Its genuine too....</li>
      <li>Lovely scent, price is right too.</li>
      <li>The original FENDI was my signature fragrance.  </li>
      <li>package and essence is really different and remarkable.</li>
      <li>One thing it isn&#x27;t is familiar.  </li>
      <li>On the product description, someone suggests that we save Fan Di for special occasions.</li>
      <li>I really recommend :)</li>
      <li>Not bad.</li>
      <li>i liked it, so I found it on amazon and bought the big bottle.</li>
      <li>Fresh, not musky at all.</li>
      <li>I had faith that she would do the right thing and waited for months .  </li>
      <li>I have used it before and like it very much.  </li>
      <li>Exactly like what I purchased at Macy&#x27;s, only much better price.</li>
      <li>These play off the Patchouli and light it up like a pinball machine, bringing out that sexy undercurrent and toning down the chocolate candy.  </li>
      <li>Once things settle down, this is a clean and sexy smell.</li>
      <li>Very unreliable seller.  </li>
      <li>Di is a lovely discovery and one you won&#x27;t smell on every other woman.  </li>
      <li>Di is a lovely discovery and one you won&#x27;t smell on every other woman.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s becoming harder to find in stores too.</li>
      <li>The winy  top notes will tone them down and tangerine should add some spice, but on paper, this is just another Miss Dior Cherie, for the teenager who can’t carry off  Miss Dior and doesn’t mind smelling like cotton</li>
      <li>Live and learn!</li>
      <li>This perfume takes a little time to love.</li>
      <li>This perfume takes a little time to love.</li>
      <li>Fan di Fendi is a much lighter, sweeter fragrance and pleasant enough, but has no complexity nor sophistication, takes several sprays and still disappears in a couple of hours or less.  </li>
      <li>Normally washing with Dial soap or an anti-bacterial dish washing detergent will get rid of any perfume.</li>
      <li>so I&#x27;m okay with a few chips.</li>
      <li>I enjoy the fragrance, but it is definitely heavier than any I had used recently.</li>
      <li>It was heady and sophisticated, complex, and had real staying power.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;The top notes are tangerine, black current and pear.</li>
      <li>Much Cheaper than the Big Name brand stores!</li>
      <li>It simply does not last, and it&#x27;s a bit much to carry around and re-apply every 60 minutes.</li>
      <li>But this is a fragrance that&#x27;s easy to get wrong, from the first time you smell it to when and how you wear it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I was very unhappy that the original Fendi is no longer available, but this perfume is almost exactly the same</li>
      <li>No one can ever smell it, or says they can barely smell it only up close and trying hard.&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
      <li>Perhaps next time I would buy the less intense variety.</li>

    <li> Exactly like what I purchased at Macy&#x27;s, only much better price. It&#x27;s becoming harder to find in stores too. Love it!</li>
    <li> I am disapointed in the product. I found a sample in a magazine and took it to a department store to smell it. i liked it, so I found it on amazon and bought the big bottle.( 70.00) When it came in the mail, I tried it on, and loved it. BUT! the smell was gone in a few minutes. Even if I sprayed 8 times, the smell would disappear.</li>
    <li> I love Fendi for women. But the patchouli overpowers everything else in Fan di Fendi. Ugh. The scent lingers; it is very hard to get the smell off your skin. Normally washing with Dial soap or an anti-bacterial dish washing detergent will get rid of any perfume. Not this one. It won&#x27;t go away.</li>
    <li> After receiving item I used for about 3 days and bottle was coming apart.  The spray nozzle broke and could not even use.  She promised a replacement and then never sent. Waste of $70.  Very unreliable seller.  Don&#x27;t know if product was defective or just fake. I wish i file a claim but its too late!  I had faith that she would do the right thing and waited for months .  Live and learn!</li>
    <li> I bought this perfume to give as valentine gift through Amazon but was disappointed . The golden logo which is very important was off the bottle. Bottle looks cracked and the perfume also doesnt smell the same because I went o macy&#x27;s to check it out. i am returning it. cant give such a product as a gift</li>
    <li> I received this as a gift and after it ran out, I wanted more. Great price for the big bottle. Came shipped all in tact. Love the fragrance.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my aunt and she LOVED it!!!</li>
    <li> The original FENDI was my signature fragrance.  I loved it -- still have no idea why they discontinued it.  It was heady and sophisticated, complex, and had real staying power.  One spritz was enough.  This fragrance is none of those things.  Fan di Fendi is a much lighter, sweeter fragrance and pleasant enough, but has no complexity nor sophistication, takes several sprays and still disappears in a couple of hours or less.  Signed, NO Fan di Fendi!!!</li>
    <li> I love this fragrance.  I have worn it for a couple years, and I continue to get compliments on how good it smells.  Fresh, not musky at all.</li>
    <li> Amaaaaaaaaaaaazing , in love with it</li>

    <li> It arrived on time. Its awesome! I love this perfum</li>
    <li> I really recommend :) Loved&lt;br /&gt;The package and essence is really different and remarkable. I wish to buy more bottles</li>
    <li> I can hardly describe how much I like this scent. It&#x27;s a lot. It may be one of my top alltime three. BUT---and this is a big one---it does not last an hour. I know you don&#x27;t \\&quot;smell\\&quot; yourself, so I&#x27;ve tried with lots of friends, spraying it on an hour or so before I meet them, then ask them to sniff and if they like it. No one can ever smell it, or says they can barely smell it only up close and trying hard.&lt;br /&gt;And yes, I&#x27;m using the full-blown perfume, and yes, I tried \\&quot;layering\\&quot; with the lotion. It simply does not last, and it&#x27;s a bit much to carry around and re-apply every 60 minutes.</li>
    <li> Bought this for may daughter for Christmas!  She loves it!  Great Value! Much Cheaper than the Big Name brand stores!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m really happy with my purchase. The exterior of the perfume bottle is so-so but I didn&#x27;t fall in love with the bottle just the scent. When I opened the box, the exterior of the bottle was chipping away, looks very cheap! But I love the scent so I&#x27;m okay with a few chips.</li>
    <li> LOVE it! I was very unhappy that the original Fendi is no longer available, but this perfume is almost exactly the same</li>

    <li> Fan di Fendi could become your favorite perfume. On the product description, someone suggests that we save Fan Di for special occasions. That&#x27;s completely wrong. But this is a fragrance that&#x27;s easy to get wrong, from the first time you smell it to when and how you wear it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The top notes are tangerine, black current and pear. Not bad. But the midnotes bring together Jasmine, Rose and Tuberose. That&#x27;s a lot of flower. And then there&#x27;s the Patchouli, with it&#x27;s own dose of candy sweet scent.  The winy  top notes will tone them down and tangerine should add some spice, but on paper, this is just another Miss Dior Cherie, for the teenager who can’t carry off  Miss Dior and doesn’t mind smelling like cotton candy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But wait, there’s more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The description doesn’t tell you that there is just a hint of peppercorn in the mix. Subtle, but boy does it diffuse the sweetness.  You can also pick out the cedar and a touch of leather.  These play off the Patchouli and light it up like a pinball machine, bringing out that sexy undercurrent and toning down the chocolate candy.  It&#x27;s what they don&#x27;t say that makes all the diffrerence.  And to make things even trickier, you can be fooled even if you try the perfume in a shop; the ingredients don’t come together immediately. You have to wait for the perfume to dry and give all those little goodies a chance to nestle against one another, find their spot, and learn to live together.  Wait and see.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is an easy perfume to get wrong and a lot of people think it&#x27;s a great scent for a young woman. It&#x27;s not.
