      <li>It makes my skin nice and hydrated and dewy.  </li>
      <li>I had started to do my own research on Maracuja oil, and I wanted to try it out.  </li>
      <li>So, I switched my face wash and moisturizer to the CeraVe system, which worked, so I kind of dismissed her recommendation.</li>
      <li>I had used argon oil and really liked it but got a sample of maracuja oil when I bought Tarte makeup which i love also</li>

      <li>&amp; I love it.</li>
      <li>I am so glad I found out about this product.  </li>
      <li>I love Tarte make-up and had been looking for something for my skin</li>
      <li>Been using my sample size for 7 weeks now and can see the difference in my face. :)</li>

      <li>The effect this oil has on skin is magic.</li>
      <li>I use the more</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m in love.</li>
      <li>I really wanted to like this after reading so many great reviews,  but it just wasn&#x27;t for me.</li>
      <li>and I used this for a couple days and my skin felt so much better.  </li>
      <li>but this is much better.</li>
      <li>I only use it at night and as I said very good combined with vitamin c cream or serum.</li>
      <li>I have a feeling I am going to end up using it all over my face at some point, but for now I am extremely happy with the results I have seen thus far in the problem areas.</li>
      <li>I love the light texture</li>
      <li>It is a mystery to me that this is working so well because I have tried thayer&#x27;s witch hazel and other cocoa butters/caffeine creams that I thought would be the best products out there until I found this.</li>
      <li>I use a loofah mitt and kind of scrub first and then apply this.  </li>
      <li>I used Josie Maran&#x27;s Argan Oil at first and liked it</li>
      <li>; skin, no refining of pores, couldn&#x27;t tell a difference in helping with blemishes,  no softening of fine lines.</li>
      <li>It happens to be power makeup, so you don&#x27;t have to worry about it caking in your fine lines or wrinkles.</li>
      <li>This is important because my pores tend to get clogged easily, and I am picky about the products I use on my face.  </li>
      <li>My skin is softer and the fine wrinkles by my eyes have noticeably  softened.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s worth Adding to your skin regimen to help keep your skin healthy and help in the repair process.</li>
      <li>If I get a big bottle of maracuja oil from another company, it would be great to use on legs for winter dryness &amp; for summer sheen.</li>
      <li>my skin looks fantastic.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s very cost effective.  </li>
      <li>(reminds me of light sesame seed oil) &amp; I like its purity &amp; gentleness to the skin - doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin or clog my pores.</li>
      <li>I use this everyday and it is especially great after you have used Retin A</li>
      <li>So far it has made my vitamin c cream much more effective.</li>
      <li>like you get a facial once a week, and this really is the best beauty purchase I have made for years.</li>
      <li>but the maracuja oil beats argon oil to me , goes right into the skin , not heavy oily feeling at all on face , just love love love this oil</li>
      <li>I usually use this oil at night so it can do its best work while skin the begins the nightly recovery process while we sleep.</li>
      <li>The bottle is perfect, as the small opening and use of dropper tip applicator helps prevent oxidation of the oil.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t really rub it in on my face, I just pat it on &amp; gently smooth my hands over my face to make sure it covers everything.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very lightweight and has a very light smell.  </li>
      <li>It has not increased my whitheads or made my skin further oily which is good.</li>
      <li>Nice oil, but smelled old and perhaps rancid.</li>
      <li>I tried Argan oil in the past and liked it, but nothing was as good as this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>My friend who has excellent skin recommended it to me last year after I got a mysterious rash on my face.</li>
      <li>The oil soaks into the skin quickly leaving no oily residue.  </li>
      <li>It absorbs quickly.  </li>
      <li>This made me breakout pretty bad.&lt;br /&gt;The parts of my skin without huge zits looks nicer.</li>
      <li>It changes the texture of my cream almost like an oil as well which quickly gets absorbed into my skin.</li>
      <li>Over the winter my once combo skin suddenly went dry, but this wonderful oil is keeping it hydrated, glowing</li>
      <li>as light weight as squalane (not squalene) and slightly smell good.</li>
      <li>Whether using alone or under a light foundation, I will continue to use Pure Maracuja Oil.</li>
      <li>I wouldn&#x27;t wear it at night but definitely underneath your BB Cream (I use the amazonian clay BB -- also an amazing tarte product).</li>
      <li>but if used a few times a week, it is a great \\&quot;boost\\&quot; to my skin care regimen.</li>
      <li>I occasionally use it on the ends of my hair and it feels amazing.</li>
      <li>It is worth a try.</li>
      <li>The oil does not \\&quot;sit\\&quot; on the skin and is rapidly absorbed.  </li>
      <li>My hands feel soft too :).  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not perfumed with anything, so the natural scent is a light nutty one - which I don&#x27;t mind except that it has a touch of a rancid oil smell to it which I don&#x27;t enjoy</li>
      <li>My skin was soft and healthy looking.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> First: I have not ordered from Amazon, but this is the homeland for reviews, which is why I&#x27;m posting here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second: Amazing. My friend who has excellent skin recommended it to me last year after I got a mysterious rash on my face. Looking back, I think it was from my shampoo and my pillowcases, but I ended up having to completely change my entire cosmetic process. So, I switched my face wash and moisturizer to the CeraVe system, which worked, so I kind of dismissed her recommendation. That was until I saw it in the checkout line at Sephora, and so I got it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Holy moly. After only a week of using it (just a few drops in my moisturizer twice a day), I really noticed an improvement in the texture of my skin. I have combination skin: oily but also very dry and prone to breakouts. I had a few breakouts (like one at a time) for about 2 weeks after I started, but since then, my skin feels like velvet. It&#x27;s incredible. My pores look noticeably smaller (but really probably just cleaner), and the texture of my skin is very smooth. I have barely even had to wear foundation. I tried Argan oil in the past and liked it, but nothing was as good as this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been recommending it to all of my friends and recommend it for you.</li>
    <li> I had used argon oil and really liked it but got a sample of maracuja oil when I bought Tarte makeup which i love also but the maracuja oil beats argon oil to me , goes right into the skin , not heavy oily feeling at all on face , just love love love this oil</li>
    <li> This oil is really good.  I use it on my face along with the Wen body lotion.  I use a few drops mixed with the lotion, but like another poster said, you must exfoliate or it will sit on the surface.  I use a loofah mitt and kind of scrub first and then apply this.  It makes my skin nice and hydrated and dewy.  It has a faint scent, but not bad at all and it doesn&#x27;t last so that&#x27;s not a problem.  I will purchase again when I run out.  Seller did very good job too.  Received in timely manner.  Good Work!</li>
    <li> I purchased this oil for my skin, which is very oily. I haven&#x27;t seen any lasting or noticable results. I also used it in my hair, I did notice a different softness. May have to use it a little longer for more noticeable results.</li>
    <li> I purchased several bottles of this about a year ago, based on the customer reviews I thought it would be great. After using it for a year, there is absolutely no difference in my skin what so ever. Don&#x27;t waste your money. A cheaper bottle of Oil of Olay works just as well.</li>
    <li> This is not a knock off as some of you claim. Do your research! This is the same sample size that came in the IPSY monthly beauty subscription box.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is fantastic!  Been using my sample size for 7 weeks now and can see the difference in my face. :)</li>
    <li> This bottle is minuscule. Wait for the ulta sale or 20% off coupon. I feel duped. We bought a big bottle for $25 and got 10x more product.</li>
    <li> Great stuff.  This is the sample size which was what i was looking for.  My skin was super dry from the winter and I used this for a couple days and my skin felt so much better.  It&#x27;s very lightweight and has a very light smell.  I use a very small amount and it covers my face.  It absorbs quickly.  I did try it in warmer weather in lieu of my regular lotion however I did go back to my regular lotion because it has an SPF and this doesn&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> I use this everyday and it is especially great after you have used Retin A and your are all flaky.  It smooths out the peeling really fast.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> rancid smell, had to get refund</li>
    <li> I use this little 1/4 oz sample bottle of Tarte Maracuja oil (bought elsewhere for the same price as here, so I may buy it from here next time) &amp; love it as my final skincare step before bed. After cleansing I apply a serum, followed by a cream (in the winter), &amp; seal in all in w/3-4 drops of maracuja oil. I haven&#x27;t tried any other brands except Tarte so I can&#x27;t compare it w/other versions. I love the light texture (reminds me of light sesame seed oil) &amp; I like its purity &amp; gentleness to the skin - doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin or clog my pores. I understand that maracuja has a high vitamin C content, so that&#x27;s a plus. It doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling greasy or heavy, but fresh &amp; soft. It&#x27;s great for hands, cuticles/nails, neck &amp; chest also. I don&#x27;t really rub it in on my face, I just pat it on &amp; gently smooth my hands over my face to make sure it covers everything. If I get a big bottle of maracuja oil from another company, it would be great to use on legs for winter dryness &amp; for summer sheen. But I reserve my little Tarte bottle just for facial skincare use - I love it.   The little dropper bottle (sturdy purple glass) is very pretty &amp; reusable, which I like, though I admit the push-button dispenser (rather than the traditional rubber squeeze dropper) is a bit of a pain - it dispenses STRICTLY only ONE drop at a time, so I have to keep pressing to get multiple drops out. And the pipette never fully fills up. Ah well, it&#x27;s still wonderful &amp; I love it. Would definitely repurchase. I&#x27;ve been using this small bottle for a couple of months now &amp; I still have 1/2 remaining, so it&#x27;s very cost effective.  It&#x27;s not perfumed with anything, so the natural scent is a light nutty one - which I don&#x27;t mind except that it has a touch of a rancid oil smell to it which I don&#x27;t enjoy &amp; I know my bottle isn&#x27;t rancid - that&#x27;s just the smell. The less I use the less I smell it &amp; the more I use the more I can smell it for the few minutes that it smells until it sinks in.</li>
    <li> When I was younger my skin was clear, but oily. As I&#x27;ve aged, I&#x27;ve lost a lot of the natural oils that gave my skin that dewy look. This product helps to restore that youthful glow. I haven&#x27;t had any cosmetic procedures and at 53 have people asking me what I&#x27;ve done and what I use on my skin. The product itself is in a very small bottle, so using it sparingly is a must. Just a few dots under the eyes and in areas needing attention is all that&#x27;s needed. It has an oily feel when applied, but adheres to the skin so that makeup can be applied directly to it without losing the silkiness. I have also purchased other Marajuca products, but they do not have the same results as the Tarte product.</li>
    <li> While using this Maracuja oil, I noticed that any recent post acne marks that I had, went away faster while using this oil over my moisturizer every night. The smell isn&#x27;t nearly as bad as some people complain about in their reviews. It goes away within seconds too. I don&#x27;t even think the smell is worth mentioning unless a seriously mild smell of cooking oil for a few seconds will kill you. My face was very hydrated while using this and it also seeps into the skin wonderfully and doesn&#x27;t make you feel oily afterwards. My skin was soft and healthy looking. I switched over to rosehip seed oil because I read it&#x27;s better for evening out the skin tone and helping get rid of dark spots, but if for some reason I don&#x27;t like the results of the rosehip as much, I would come right back to this Maracuja oil.</li>
    <li> I love Tarte make-up and had been looking for something for my skin so I was stoked to see that they had come out with this oil.  However I ordered it from a vendor on amazon (to save money) and I&#x27;m not sure I got the real deal.  It looked legit, but the oil has an slight scent - nothing rancid, but it&#x27;s noticeable.  I got the actual Pure Maracuja oil from sephora for xmas a month later and it doesn&#x27;t smell like anything.  So I&#x27;m just a little suspicious - I&#x27;d recommend you buy it at an actual beauty store like sephora or ulta, especially since it&#x27;s going on your face.</li>
    <li> I loved the actual product but the dropper was difficult for me to use. I still would recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> This item smelled and had the same consistency as olive oil. Would not purchase again</li>
    <li> I love this!  I use it as a primer. it makes my makeup look flawless. My skin used to feel dry after a hot shower and after about 1 month it&#x27;s supper soft. And no more dryness.</li>
    <li> Best skincare product and a must in every persons bathroom.  Apply morning and night. I&#x27;ve noticed my skin smoother and clearer.  Got compliments from a friend that my skin looked like porcelain!  Get some!</li>
    <li> i think this is excellent though. as light weight as squalane (not squalene) and slightly smell good. also use it on hair</li>
    <li> It feels so good when it goes on but my skin hates it. Gets puffy and patchy with dryness and redness. I&#x27;m obviously allergic which is a shame because it feels like velvet when you apply it to your skin. :(</li>
    <li> After two months of regular usage, I most definitely see a difference in the texture of my skin. As a person who had oily skin in my youth, I never thought I&#x27;d use an oil on my face, but this product is light and easily absorbed without blocking pore, in fact, my pores look smaller. Whether using alone or under a light foundation, I will continue to use Pure Maracuja Oil. It also makes a great gift. Everyone I&#x27;ve given it to has found it remarkable as well.</li>
    <li> I recently started using facial oil because I live in the desert and my skin needs serious hydration. I got a sample of Caudalie overnight repair oil that I thought was amazing. I didn&#x27;t want to spend the $50, so I ordered this maracuja oil instead. It is definitely not comprable. I may have to splurge now. Will not reorder.</li>
    <li> All in one, no night cream no serum because this oil make me moisture all days.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for several months and find it leaves my face feeling very smooth/soft without any greasiness.  The oil soaks into the skin quickly leaving no oily residue.  The item arrived from the vendor quickly and in perfect condition</li>
    <li> I am in love with this product.  Growing up I had several problems with acne and tried everything on the market both prescription and otc, only thing that helped was accutane.  Fast forward 7 years and I have problems here and there with breakouts so I am very careful with what I use.&lt;br /&gt;This product is amazing!  My dry skin on my face is no more,  I do not suffer breakouts or spots from it. My skin is so soft with no visible oily shine. This will have a permanent place in my skin care line up</li>
    <li> Obviously I can only vouch for my own experience with this oil, but it&#x27;s been quite a miracle for me. I originally picked it up based on a recommendation from a friend who said it helped heal some dry patches she had. I have pretty average skin, but as I have gotten older I have developed similar dry patches here and there. After almost two weeks of dabbing just tiny bits on the patches every night before bed, they are virtually gone. A few tiny zits cropped up at first, but those went away quickly. Here&#x27;s the kicker: one of my dry patches was next to a rather dark age spot. Within a couple of days, I realized the spot itself was fading rapidly, so I started applying the oil directly on the spot as well. It&#x27;s now barely visible and my skin is so soft there! This week I have started using it on the outer corners of my eyes because that skin is getting a bit brittle, and I swear it&#x27;s already starting to soften and relax. I have a feeling I am going to end up using it all over my face at some point, but for now I am extremely happy with the results I have seen thus far in the problem areas.</li>
    <li> I really wanted to like this after reading so many great reviews,  but it just wasn&#x27;t for me. I have combo skin, acne prone,  and a few fine lines. I used this oil after cleansing while my face was still damp. It didn&#x27;t soak in as well as my argan oil, and it made my pores stand out more than usual.  After a few uses, I couldn&#x27;t see any change in my skin for the better.  No &amp;#34;glowing&amp;#34; skin, no refining of pores, couldn&#x27;t tell a difference in helping with blemishes,  no softening of fine lines. And it smells like cooking oil, but not overwhelming.</li>
    <li> :( It broke and I was refunded half. :/</li>
    <li> I really like this product not greasy my skin is moisturized and bright</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin on my face get dry and scaly during the winter months.  Normal facial moisturizers from Walmart, Clinque, Prescriptives, Mary Kay, Avon either do not work, cause an allergic reaction or are too oily.  After considerable research I found that maracuja oil is supposed to work well.  I am pleased to find it works wonderfully!</li>
    <li> This has really changed my life! I actually bought this because it came with a make-up pack I found in Sephora by Tarte. I was shopping for eye makeup that day and thought I would try the Tarte package because I was completely out of my usual anti-aging serums and thought I would try something new and get the eye makeup included.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am happy I bought the package just for this oil. I have seen healed acne pictures of people who went vegan and raw for years and wondered if my pores would ever look mostly closed like that again after having moderate acne on my cheeks as a teen that left some scars. This seriously closes my pores and evens-out my complection better than ANYTHING I have tried and also worked about 400% better than I thought it would in terms of helping the moisture level of my skin become more dewy. It also seems to lighten my scars and even clears blackheads up which is a near miracle without specific glycolic acid facewashes and exfoliaters which I am out of now--but this seems to be doing just fine getting rid of those without even my other skin care rituals. It is a mystery to me that this is working so well because I have tried thayer&#x27;s witch hazel and other cocoa butters/caffeine creams that I thought would be the best products out there until I found this. I think using it makes your skin look like you get a facial once a week, and this really is the best beauty purchase I have made for years. It takes ages off of your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also actually clears up dark circles under your eyes too! Again, this seems to be the best product I have found for the actual results of making the skin appear less dark under your eyes. It is almost unbelievable how well this product really works. I would definitely give it a try. I just use the oil in the morning and at night and rub a few drops around my face and under my eyes.</li>
    <li> I am age 60 with mature very dry skin.  After 3 days of use I look like a shriveled prune. end of story</li>
    <li> Use only as directed.  Will burn your skin if you don&#x27;t or if you apply too much at any one time.</li>
    <li> Not as good a product as other Tarte products</li>
    <li> First time trying ths product and feels and smells just like olive oil. Didn&#x27;t see a difference in the appearance of my skin.&lt;br /&gt;Would not purchase again.</li>
    <li> I use it every night and I swear in the morning my skin looks fantastic. I am 48 years old and this stuff is fabulous. You only need to use a little each night. No break outs.</li>
    <li> This oil is simply amazing! Use a few drops every night and your skin would feel soft and bright!&lt;br /&gt;The shipment came right on time and it was package very well. I would definitely order form this merchant again :)</li>
    <li> I had started to do my own research on Maracuja oil, and I wanted to try it out.  I am so glad that I tried it out! Tarte Pure Maracuja oil is a must for every girl&#x27;s regimen.  It does not clog your pores, and a little goes a long way. This is important because my pores tend to get clogged easily, and I am picky about the products I use on my face.  All you need is 3 drops on your hands, rub for a few seconds, and gently pat on your face and  neck.  I add another three drops and gently apply to my eye-lids and brow bone area.  The oil does not \\&quot;sit\\&quot; on the skin and is rapidly absorbed.  My hands feel soft too :).  I am going to start treating my hands and arms with this oil too :).  Because this oil has Vitamin C, it can help brighten complexion and possibly complement other products that are part of the nightly skin care regimen. I usually use this oil at night so it can do its best work while skin the begins the nightly recovery process while we sleep. The bottle is perfect, as the small opening and use of dropper tip applicator helps prevent oxidation of the oil. Be sure to avoid touching the droppper tip to anything though.  I would recommend starting out with a small bottle, as IT WILL LAST A LONG TIME.  It is worth a try.</li>
    <li> I love the way this feels.  I apply it around my eyes at night and when I wake up in the morning it stills feels like it is hydrating.  A little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> I love this it makes my skin niceand soft. I especially like to use it around my eyes it leaves tehm nice and soft</li>
    <li> This oil it doesn&#x27;t matter if you have oily skin or dry skin it works with both.  I know that is hard to believe but look at other reviews it is true.  I put this on morning and night and skin is so soft.  This small bottle is good for travel or to try it.</li>
    <li> Noticed nothing special about this oil compared to other essential oils. I used it on my face and some for my lips, but did not notice any difference. It&#x27;s not very oily and absorbs fast, but it does not leave the skin smoother or more hydrated. I would not recommend it.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t do much for my complexion.  I would not purchase it again. It is some what oily and I did not notice any difference after using it for sometime.</li>
    <li> After having combo/oily skin for many years, the thought of putting oil on my face terrified me. I heard many great reviews about maracuja oil so I purchased it. It&#x27;s more of a dry oil. When I started using it at night, I noticed that when I woke up in the morning, each day there was less &amp; less oil on my forehead and on my nose! My skin tone is evened out, fine lines have disappeared, pores look smaller, amazing! I used Josie Maran&#x27;s Argan Oil at first and liked it but this is much better. I use the Argan Oil on my knees, elbows, hair, etc. The Maracuja is specifically for the face &amp; neck. Over the winter my once combo skin suddenly went dry, but this wonderful oil is keeping it hydrated, glowing and I won&#x27;t be without it. One thing, the pictured item is only .23 oz. The 1.7 oz size sells for $40.00. Keep that in mind before purchasing. I highly recommend this item!!</li>
    <li> Only buy Tarte from a reliable retailer such as Sephora, Ulta, Macy&#x27;s and Tarte.com&lt;br /&gt;This oil could be old or a fake.</li>
    <li> Vitamin C is known for its firming and brightening abilities.  it is also touted to prevent antioxident damage from the sun.  Unfortunately, most Vitamin C products cannot penetrate into the dermis efficiently to be effective.  Many are very irritating to my sensitive skin and if used too often burn and irritate.  I do like to incorporate vitamin C skincare into my regimen, but NOT daily.  I especially like it around the under eye area for its brightening ability.  I tried this product and like it.  I especially like the ROLLER BALL version.  I keep it stored tightly in my fridge and use it a few times a week - a cool boost of Vitamin C on the eyes is great.  The roller balls gentle massage effect helps the product penetrate into the skin.  Again, I can&#x27;t use this daily because the Vitamin C irritates my sensitive skin but if used a few times a week, it is a great \\&quot;boost\\&quot; to my skin care regimen.</li>
    <li> I recently switched to cleansing my face with the Oil Cleansing method, so I didn&#x27;t want to moisturize with a lotion that had tons of ingredients in it.  I cleanse with my olive oil and caster oil mixture and use about 4 drops of this after.  My face feels great and I haven&#x27;t broken out.  Funny how all my life I would have thought oil on my face would break me out and cause my face to be more oily...definitely not the case!  Google Oil Cleansing Method--that and the maracuja oil will change your life when it comes to washing and moisturizing your face!</li>
    <li> I am so glad I found out about this product.  I am 69 year&#x27;s old and my skin was starting to become very dry.  I started using Tarte Pure Maracuja Oil and no more dry skin.  I use no other products.  This does it for me.  It leaves no oily film.  I put my makeup on right away.  It happens to be power makeup, so you don&#x27;t have to worry about it caking in your fine lines or wrinkles.</li>
    <li> Seriously. All the other rave reviews are right. This stuff works. I have combination skin and have been prone to acne my whole life, even now at age 28. I put this oil on at night after cleansing and toning, in place of my regular night cream. My skin has been great! Very moisterized, no breakouts, even tone and texture, etc. I haven&#x27;t tried any other face oils, and I may give argan oil a try as well, but this oil has worked wonders so far. Who would have known that putting oil on your face could be so good for it? I have a friend who has struggled with pretty terrible acne for many years and has tried everything besides Accutane with little to no luck. This oil alone has made a dramatic difference in her skin and her success story was what made me try this stuff. Trust me, it works. And the small size is pretty cheap here on Amazon. I ordered the 0.23oz size in November and I still have a third of it left. I think I might use a little more than some people, so you might be able to get more like 5-6 months out of the small size. A little does go a long way.</li>
    <li> I love Maracuja Oil and use it often but the price for this size bottle was ridiculous. The large bottle is around $46.00 but it contains a lot of product.  This size bottle is like you would get as a trial in a set and should not cost $18.95.  I thought the bottle would be a lot bigger and I would have returned it if not for the nearly $6.00 return shipping cost.  I will certainly read more closely in the future.</li>
    <li> been using this as part of my night time face routine. I&#x27;m in love. will be buying the bigger version pretty soon. For it being a &amp;#34;oil&amp;#34; product shortly after applying to face you wouldn&#x27;t even notice that you had just applied a oil product. It does have a certain smell but that too vanishes rather quickly.</li>
    <li> Let me begin by stating that my skin type is oily with whiteheads around my nose and cheeks. I do have uneven skin tone and blemishes. After I cleanse my face with my clinique facial soap I use my toner and then apply the maracuja oil also known as passion fruit oil. As soon as it soaks into my face I then apply my vitamin c cream. So far it has made my vitamin c cream much more effective. It changes the texture of my cream almost like an oil as well which quickly gets absorbed into my skin. This product works well with other moisturizers it gives it a boost and it also helps to keep your skin soft and supple. It has not increased my whitheads or made my skin further oily which is good. It&#x27;s worth Adding to your skin regimen to help keep your skin healthy and help in the repair process. I only use it at night and as I said very good combined with vitamin c cream or serum.</li>
    <li> I really good oil to use. I used it on my face really even and tone the skin</li>
    <li> This stuff is the bomb. Seriously. My boyfriend and I both got a small sample bottle with a small sample of the brightening eye cream from sephora as a promotional thing. I like the eye cream a lot but this stuff is truly amazing. I have combination skin, break out only occasionally but have never had acne. This stuff just totally balances out your skin, even when applied to the generally &amp;#34;greasier&amp;#34; areas like your t-zone, doesn&#x27;t cause black heads or breakouts. In fact, it prevents them. I&#x27;ve noticed fewer and small black heads on my nose. People continuously comment on my skin saying it looks bright and glowing and I really feel like this product is the reason why (and drinking lots of water). I wouldn&#x27;t wear it at night but definitely underneath your BB Cream (I use the amazonian clay BB -- also an amazing tarte product). Needless to say we used up the small bottles and bought the large 75 ml from Sephora. You don&#x27;t need much, just dot it on to each check, your forehead and chin and blend it in. I occasionally use it on the ends of my hair and it feels amazing.</li>
    <li> Nice oil, but smelled old and perhaps rancid. Not a fan.</li>
    <li> I really like this oil. It&#x27;s a small travel size but great for taking on a trip.I wanted it &amp; I bought it!</li>
    <li> The effect this oil has on skin is magic. I have never seen anything like it. I had terrible lips......terrible...this oil cleared them up within 15 minutes.  It helped my hands, cuticles.  It cannot think of a part of my body that it did not work miraculously on.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff...been using it for about a month everyday and definitely can see results. My skin is softer and the fine wrinkles by my eyes have noticeably  softened. Some people complain about the nutty scent but i like it.</li>
    <li> This made me breakout pretty bad.&lt;br /&gt;The parts of my skin without huge zits looks nicer. Gonna start using it again in cooler months and see if that helps.</li>
