### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Feel great!</li>
      <li>so I gave it a shot not expecting it to come close to Smashbox&#x27;s wonderful gel liner.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m now using ELF gel eyeliner with the brush from this Maybelline product and it&#x27;s a perfect set!  </li>
      <li>is an excellent opportunity price and product quality.</li>
      <li>Incredible!  </li>
      <li>This is the best.  </li>
      <li>It is perfect.</li>
      <li>I would recommend buying this gel liner just for the brush but the product itself is wonderful too.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It also has incredible staying power, and even my watery, allergy-prone eyes don&#x27;t cause it to</li>
      <li>But it is nearly as good!</li>
      <li>Looks beautiful.</li>
      <li>; it looks great either way.</li>
      <li>Great color.  </li>
      <li>Still looks great by the end of the day.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am really happy I tried this product - recommended without reservation.</li>
      <li>but I have used the Maybelline one and both do a great job at distributing the liner.</li>
      <li>The brush is really good.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a bit darker than I envisioned, but really it&#x27;s gorgeous.</li>
      <li>I love it!</li>
      <li>Absolutely LOVE this!</li>
      <li>I love it!</li>
      <li>but I think I like this even better!</li>
      <li>This product is amazing for the price.</li>
      <li>The brush that comes with it is AMAZING too.</li>
      <li>even survives to sweaty days and warm weather.</li>
      <li>I have my own brush</li>
      <li>I have used gel/cream liners before and liked them.</li>
      <li>I did not have to go over it too much, I created a perfect cat eye with this!</li>
      <li>So much easier to apply eyeliner and brush works great too!!</li>
      <li>I do not know how to do my own eye make-up yet...</li>
      <li>A good brush and smooth gel liner makes it easier for sure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>More colors, please, Sirs.</li>
      <li>Buy it! :)</li>
      <li>Seriously better than any pencil  or liquid eye liner you can buy.</li>
      <li>I bought Charcoal and am pleased with it.  </li>
      <li>Love this stuff.  </li>
      <li>The brown is an all-around win, as well.  </li>
      <li>but I don&#x27;t think it will do better than this color.</li>
      <li>Probably ok, it was my daughter order</li>
      <li>The product goes on nice, smooth lines, etc.  </li>
      <li>Love this liner, but I use an artists paintbrush with it to get a thinner line.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll buy again and again &#x3D;)</li>
      <li>but I don&#x27;t like the brush I have bought more than 1 brush.</li>
      <li>:)</li>
      <li>The Lasting Drama Gel in charcoal is awesome.  </li>
      <li>I have an eyeliner brush that I purchased separately from this product so application is very easy and smooth.</li>
      <li>The brush is worth the price alone!!</li>
      <li>love this, gel eyeliners are so easy to use even for beginers.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m blown away by how silky it is, and how much more easily it goes on than those higher-end brands.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I have really oily skin, so I was hoping that this eyeliner would be good.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve never try gel eyeliners and this is definitely my first one, I love it!</li>
      <li>It goes on easily with no clumping</li>
      <li>and it wasn&#x27;t as easy to apply as this product.</li>
      <li>Also, it goes on easily.  </li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t smear or rub off easily...but it does come off easily with my eye-makeup remover.  </li>
      <li>application is easy.</li>
      <li>but it comes off easily too.  </li>
      <li>This one is definitely a good value and comparable to high end gel liners.</li>
      <li>/&gt;The brush that it comes with is also pretty darn amazing.  </li>
      <li>I got it in charcoal and the consistency is smooth, stays on all day, doesn&#x27;t crease, and comes off easily with soap and water.</li>
      <li>Super precised!</li>
      <li>It last all day for me, the brush is great and it is easy to apply.</li>
      <li>The brush was so easy to use and the gel itself is a very nice consistency, not too dry, not too wet, PERFECT.</li>
      <li>The gel goes on well and lasts throughout the day, and the brush allows for a precise line.</li>
      <li>love this product, my only concern is the pencil, it&#x27;s a good pencil</li>
      <li>I love that when I take a shower it comes right off which is a plus for me</li>
      <li>I ordered this because of the really great reviews, and I thought that it might be nice to get regular deliveries of a decent eyeliner with Amazon&#x27;s subscribe and save program.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I find the brush supplied is fine because I was not looking for a super fine line application anyway.</li>
      <li>The pot is pretty large and even the included brush is good.</li>
      <li>I love how easy it is to apply and the brush works really well.</li>
      <li>Besides, the price is friendly.</li>
      <li>Clean line or smudged</li>
      <li>But in total it was very easy to use and it has a very smooth application.</li>
      <li>Came fast works grate love the brush that came with it</li>
      <li>Anyway, this stuff is really easy to apply and honestly does last all day.</li>
      <li>All the colors are good, except the purple, which should be more plum and less glinty.  </li>
      <li>I like the way this eyeliner looks and lasts, however, it dries up quickly in its container, and the brush becomes messed up and doesn&#x27;t hold its shape after a couple of uses and after I tried washing it.</li>
      <li>it makes it so easy to apply highly recomened!</li>
      <li>The eyeliner goes on easily, but doesn&#x27;t stay on through the day very well for me.  </li>
      <li>I normally use gel eyeliner, and this is much creamier, which is nice.</li>
      <li>It stays well, goes on easy, and the jar lasts a whole lot longer than a pencil eyeliner</li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m back to buy more of these!</li>
      <li>(A makeup remover pen can be useful, just in case.)  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s more of a natural, matte sort of black.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I wipe the brush off each time I use it by pinching it between a tissue and pulling it to the tip which keeps it nice and flat</li>
      <li>I have pretty oily eyelids</li>
      <li>This is the first gel eyeliner I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
      <li>I bought 2 different colors and I love them.  </li>
      <li>Very well in fact!</li>
      <li>At first I like this item</li>
      <li>I put mineral powder on before I apply and no smudging or leaving marks higher on my eyelid.</li>
      <li>This is my first gel eyeliner experience</li>
      <li>soooooo in love true color last long easy to remove</li>
      <li>but I love it so much I&#x27;ll never buy anything different.</li>
      <li>I purchased this product as a cheaper alternative to the Bobbi Brown eyeliner, and that&#x27;s pretty much what it is.</li>
      <li>For some reason I thought charcoal would be darker, but it is more of a grey color.</li>
      <li>I got it in blackest black and the color is really nice</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t not lasts not pigmented enough smudges easily</li>
      <li>This would be fine for theatrical use, but I can&#x27;t imagine looking like this in real life.</li>
      <li>I have been practicing at night so that when I really need to use it I will know how.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I&#x27;ve never try gel eyeliners and this is definitely my first one, I love it! The brush was so easy to use and the gel itself is a very nice consistency, not too dry, not too wet, PERFECT. I got it in blackest black and the color is really nice I did not have to go over it too much, I created a perfect cat eye with this! NOT TO FORGET its affordable price! I love it! Recommend it to everyone!</li>
    <li> I have a horrible time with eye-liner so thought would try this.  But still doesn&#x27;t do the trick with my unsteady hand.</li>
    <li> Love this liner, but I use an artists paintbrush with it to get a thinner line.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product as a cheaper alternative to the Bobbi Brown eyeliner, and that&#x27;s pretty much what it is. The gel goes on well and lasts throughout the day, and the brush allows for a precise line. I&#x27;m not a huge fan of the color, which is darker and more sparkly than I expected, and I&#x27;m finding it irritates my eyes if I put it on too close to the lashes, something I have avoided with other brands.</li>
    <li> I usually throw away brushes that come with products but this is an absolute dream. I would recommend buying this gel liner just for the brush but the product itself is wonderful too. I got it in charcoal and the consistency is smooth, stays on all day, doesn&#x27;t crease, and comes off easily with soap and water. Buy it! :)</li>
    <li> It is perfect. It stays on all day long.</li>
    <li> I generally use the darkest black eyeliner I can find but wanted to soften my look now and then so I bought this liner in charcoal. I have used gel/cream liners before and liked them. Maybelline&#x27;s was inexpensive and even came with a brush so I gave it a shot not expecting it to come close to Smashbox&#x27;s wonderful gel liner. But it is nearly as good! The pot is pretty large and even the included brush is good. I have my own brush but I have used the Maybelline one and both do a great job at distributing the liner. This eyeliner is thick and pigmented. It smoothes on my lids without tugging and once it dries, doesn&#x27;t budge all day. The charcoal is a &amp;quot;light black&amp;quot; as opposed to a washed out gray color which I like. I find it easy to apply either in a thin of thick line and much less messy than liquid liner. It washes off with my facial cleanser or eye makeup remover and doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes at all. This one is definitely a good value and comparable to high end gel liners.</li>
    <li> This is my first gel eyeliner experience and I have to say, I&#x27;m SOLD!  You can make it as dark and dramatic or as light and natural looking as you want.  I actually found that when I first put it on, it looked so natural and blended so well, I was worried that it wasn&#x27;t dramatic enough...but then I stood back and looked at the difference between my eyes and WOW!  It&#x27;s the dramatic look but with looking almost completely natural.  I didn&#x27;t think that was possible.  And with the gel, you have ultimate control.  No leakage, no running, no mess.  It goes where you put it and stays there.  Comes off when I wash my face with soap but not from crying at sappy movies. Incredible!  I wish it were a bit cheaper but I love it so much I&#x27;ll never buy anything different.</li>
    <li> The claim is that it lasts 24 hours - even being realistic I was hoping for 8.  Within an hour it began smudging and fading.  It does not live up to the claim whatsoever.</li>
    <li> I have an eyeliner brush that I purchased separately from this product so application is very easy and smooth. My only qualm was that the charcoal color seemed like a cross between a gray and their other color, &#x27;Blackest Black&#x27;. I didn&#x27;t like how faded it looked against my skin, I would have preferred a real gray or black to this mixture.</li>
    <li> Really like the product</li>
    <li> I wanted the charcoal because I&#x27;m super pale and wanted to avoid the overdone raccoon look. I&#x27;m too old for that! Anyway, this stuff is really easy to apply and honestly does last all day. Because of my overall coloring, it gives the illusion of black liner, but not as harsh, if that makes sense. It&#x27;s a bit darker than I envisioned, but really it&#x27;s gorgeous. I find the brush supplied is fine because I was not looking for a super fine line application anyway. I like a little smudgier, and this brush makes it easy.</li>
    <li> It last all day for me, the brush is great and it is easy to apply. For some reason I thought charcoal would be darker, but it is more of a grey color.</li>
    <li> I first read about this eyeliner in _Allure_ magazine, where it was awarded a &amp;#34;Best of Beauty&amp;#34; award in the black color.  Since I already have a black gel eyeliner, I ordered this in Charcoal, and I love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I usually buy MAC or Bobbi Brown gel eyeliners -- but I think I like this even better! I&#x27;m blown away by how silky it is, and how much more easily it goes on than those higher-end brands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also has incredible staying power, and even my watery, allergy-prone eyes don&#x27;t cause it to smear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush that it comes with is also pretty darn amazing.  I have both MAC and Bobbi Brown brushes that I&#x27;ve been using for their gel eyeliners, but this little brush is just as great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m back to buy more of these! For the price and quality, you can&#x27;t go wrong!</li>
    <li> Hi,&lt;br /&gt;  I got this because i wanted to try something new. I have never used gel liner before and was told that this was one of the easier ones to use. I had to play with it for a while to try and get a rythm going. But in total it was very easy to use and it has a very smooth application.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t not lasts not pigmented enough smudges easily</li>
    <li> The eyeliner goes on easily, but doesn&#x27;t stay on through the day very well for me.  I&#x27;m now using ELF gel eyeliner with the brush from this Maybelline product and it&#x27;s a perfect set!  Too bad they don&#x27;t come together.  :)</li>
    <li> I love it! It stays for a long time and it is easy to use. Besides, the price is friendly.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing for the price. I used to use a MAC gel eyeliner and it wasn&#x27;t as easy to apply as this product. The brush that comes with it is AMAZING too. Easiest application ever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only problem I had with this product was that it was slightly glittery. I was expecting a solid, black, everyday color, so the glitter caught me off guard. I purchased it in Charcoal 954 so beware if you&#x27;re looking for a solid color!</li>
    <li> This is the first gel eyeliner I&#x27;ve tried.  I&#x27;m a fan of liquid eyeliner and probably won&#x27;t completely switch over to gel, but I like this product a lot and will definitely use it on occasion.  (This review is for the &amp;#34;charcoal&amp;#34; color.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You do need a steady hand for applying.  (I&#x27;ve been doing a lot of practicing and I&#x27;m getting there.)  It takes just a little bit of time to dry, which is great for smudging if that&#x27;s something you want to do.  However, be careful once you&#x27;ve got it how you want it so you don&#x27;t smear while the drying process completes.  (A makeup remover pen can be useful, just in case.)  I have pretty oily eyelids but this lasts a decent amount of time without smearing or running.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The charcoal color is a nice black, but not particularly shiny.  It&#x27;s more of a natural, matte sort of black.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush that comes with it is a little wide and is good for dramatic looks.  However, you may want to buy a thinner brush for daytime wear.  Because I don&#x27;t use eyeliner that often, I&#x27;ve had this pot open for six months.  It hasn&#x27;t dried out or changed consistency at all!</li>
    <li> Absolutely LOVE this! So much easier to apply eyeliner and brush works great too!!</li>
    <li> I like it.  Doesn&#x27;t leave that eyeliner crease on upper eyelid.  My only complaint is the brush...it clumps and has something sharp in it.  It&#x27;s so clumpy and hard to clean I may have to throw the whole thing out...</li>
    <li> I bought 2 different colors and I love them.  I would buy again and it is not that hard to apply.  I have been practicing at night so that when I really need to use it I will know how.</li>
    <li> is an excellent opportunity price and product quality. rated 5 stars for that</li>
    <li> Professional looking eyeliner with the ease of application.  Works well along both lash lines.&lt;br /&gt;Great product....does not smudge....lasts all day.</li>
    <li> I bought the charcoal color. I love how easy it is to apply and the brush works really well. However I&#x27;m disappointed that it doesn&#x27;t last. It smears after couple hours. I was going to get the black color but I don&#x27;t think it will do better than this color.</li>
    <li> This product is next-level.  I like to line inside the waterline, and I own every, single idiot liner ever produced, from Serge Lutens to Chanel.  This is the go-to soldier.  No raccooning, and the longest lasting.  Saw it on a YouTube makeup artist&#x27;s tutorial.  All the colors are good, except the purple, which should be more plum and less glinty.  The black was insanely pigmented and intense, so am using charcoal.  The brown is an all-around win, as well.  More colors, please, Sirs.</li>
    <li> Feel great! Looks beautiful. Light charcoal color (like silver dark grey). The brush is worth the price alone!! Super precised! I do not know how to do my own eye make-up yet... but I will practice. A good brush and smooth gel liner makes it easier for sure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a very beginner here, I would totally recommend!</li>
    <li> I tried several different brands of more expensive eye liner before trying this product.  (Obviously, I was unhappy with the other ones if I was still looking around.)  The Lasting Drama Gel in charcoal is awesome.  Still looks great by the end of the day.  Also does not look as harsh as liquid eyeliners.  The brush is really good.  It&#x27;s possible to control the width of the line from really narrow to rather wide, and do so quite easily.  Also, a little goes a long way, and it&#x27;s easy to see how much is left in the container.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am really happy I tried this product - recommended without reservation.</li>
    <li> Came fast works grate love the brush that came with it it makes it so easy to apply highly recomened! A++</li>
    <li> soooooo in love true color last long easy to remove</li>
    <li> Probably ok, it was my daughter order</li>
    <li> Another waste of money.  Does not flow on evenly probably due to the brush.  Product seemed dry.  Should have returned it.</li>
    <li> Seriously better than any pencil  or liquid eye liner you can buy. It stays well, goes on easy, and the jar lasts a whole lot longer than a pencil eyeliner</li>
    <li> Love this stuff.  It doesn&#x27;t smear or rub off easily...but it does come off easily with my eye-makeup remover.  It goes on easily with no clumping and I can make it as thick or as thin as I want with the included brush.  I wipe the brush off each time I use it by pinching it between a tissue and pulling it to the tip which keeps it nice and flat just like it was when it was new.  I&#x27;ll buy again and again &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> I like the way this eyeliner looks and lasts, however, it dries up quickly in its container, and the brush becomes messed up and doesn&#x27;t hold its shape after a couple of uses and after I tried washing it. I&#x27;ll go back to the more expensive gel pot I was using.</li>
    <li> This product exceeded my expectations. Reading other reviews I was worried it wouldn&#x27;t stay. It does! Very well in fact! I love that when I take a shower it comes right off which is a plus for me because eye make up removers irritate my eyes. I put mineral powder on before I apply and no smudging or leaving marks higher on my eyelid.</li>
    <li> Great color.  Clean line or smudged; it looks great either way.</li>
    <li> I ordered this because of the really great reviews, and I thought that it might be nice to get regular deliveries of a decent eyeliner with Amazon&#x27;s subscribe and save program.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The application is easy. I normally use gel eyeliner, and this is much creamier, which is nice. It doesn&#x27;t feel as hard as a normal gel eyeliner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I applied it maybe 5 minutes ago, and it&#x27;s already starting to irritate my eyes. The brush that was included isn&#x27;t fine enough for normal application. My eyeliner is way too thick, and I&#x27;m not really a novice at makeup application. I&#x27;ve been using stage makeup since I was a little kid. This would be fine for theatrical use, but I can&#x27;t imagine looking like this in real life. I have really oily skin, so I was hoping that this eyeliner would be good. I cancelled my subscription instead.</li>
    <li> This is the best.  I&#x27;ve been using pencil for years because I like a soft line but it comes off easily too.  This gel allows me to soften the line the way I like it but it lasts all day.  Also, it goes on easily.  I will be using this gel from now on.  I bought Charcoal and am pleased with it.  It is dark enough for me, I can&#x27;t imagine what the black looks like.  I use this every day.</li>
    <li> The product goes on nice, smooth lines, etc.  The problem I have is the eyeliner rubs off/wears off my upper lids as the day goes on.  No complaints with the lower lids.  I will certainly use up the remainder of the product, but will not likely ever buy again.</li>
    <li> This product is hard to use and control application.  However, with lots of practice it could be what some people are looking for.  Just not me and I&#x27;m a make-up person.</li>
    <li> love this, gel eyeliners are so easy to use even for beginers. love this product, my only concern is the pencil, it&#x27;s a good pencil BUT i think i&#x27;m gonna use an old pencil apliyer i have to make my life easier. other than that i really really love this, stays put all day and it does not crease i repeate it does not crease. even survives to sweaty days and warm weather.</li>
    <li> At first I like this item but I don&#x27;t like the brush I have bought more than 1 brush. Also keep the conatiner close if not the eyeliner will dry.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t last as long as I&#x27;d like it to, but I guess all make up is going to be that way. The charcoal color is a nice alternative to black, as I have the black and it&#x27;s a little too bold. This color is a little less intense.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like it.</li>
