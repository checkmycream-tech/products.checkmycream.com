      <li>And this was great.</li>
      <li>I love it!!</li>
      <li>But I just reapply :o)</li>
      <li>Kind of like suntan oil or lotion, like the beach!</li>
      <li>I keep smelling my own wrists!</li>
      <li>she loved it.</li>
      <li>but this is mild and perfect.</li>
      <li>Going to  purchase more for sure !!</li>
      <li>Love the scent!</li>
      <li>I like warm, vanilla, coconut type sents.</li>
      <li>Really nice beachy smell that I like to wear in the summer or on vacation.</li>
      <li>Shipping was fast and the bottle is cute!!!</li>
      <li>liked the grapefruit scent a bit better but would not order either again.</li>
      <li>Its very sweet and kind of reminds me of spring.</li>
      <li>Love love love this scent</li>
      <li>I love this - it&#x27;s the strongest one of the Love &amp; Toast scents I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
      <li>I will definately order a couple more.</li>
      <li>I love the way it smells.</li>
      <li>A lot more honey than coconut.</li>
      <li>tiny bottle, but smells great!</li>
      <li>Love love the scent.</li>
      <li>I probably will not order a full size, but the scent s amazing</li>
      <li>I was looking for something more clean and beachy, but its very sweet</li>
      <li>just so I can enjoy it.</li>
      <li>I initially bought this scent for me because it smells great in the bottle.</li>
      <li>it smells like a kid&#x27;s perfume you buy at CVS that comes with like a free lip gloss.  </li>
      <li>Overall a good product.</li>
      <li>Sweet and reminds me of a fragrance I had as a kid</li>
      <li>This perfume doesn&#x27;t smell that  good and the bottle is smaller than my thumb.</li>
      <li>BUT.....it wears off way to quick.</li>
      <li>I put some on before going to The Fresh Market and got plenty compliments.</li>
      <li>it has a fresh smell to it.</li>
      <li>The pretty bottle and subtle sweet, yet, quickly vanishing fragrance is more suitable to preteen kids.</li>
      <li>but I was looking for something light and natural.</li>
      <li>Saw a review on YouTube about this product, I read the description of this product and knew it was a scent that I would e interested in.</li>
      <li>The item is small, but this product smells so good.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not complex; just a lovely blend of honey and coconut with a very tiny bit of something floral underneath.</li>
      <li>If it was longer lasting, it&#x27;d be my new favorite.</li>
      <li>When I received my package the perfume smells amazing but the only dwn fall is that the scent didn&#x27;t last at all.</li>
      <li>its a real pic</li>
      <li>It smells so good, especially if you layer it with other things,</li>
      <li>Maybe a bigger bottle with a spray pump will allow the smell to last longer since you are spraying more.</li>
      <li>I had high hopes for this product</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
      <li>planning on getting a bigger bottle, thanks!!</li>
      <li>so i gave it to a 10 year old girl.  </li>
      <li>Smelled old and musky</li>
      <li>Also this size bottle is super small.</li>
      <li>I wasnt really expecting much, but this little bottle of perfume rocks!!</li>

<li> The scent just doesn&#x27;t last very long...</li>
<li> but it does not last very long.  </li>
<li> I get compliments all day long when I wear it!</li>
<li> Perhaps because it&#x27;s a natural perfume, but the scent doesn&#x27;t stay past an hour.</li>
<li> The scent disappears quickly, which is disappointing because I wanted it as my daytime scent for this summer season.</li>
<li> Can&#x27;t wait to try their other scents!</li>
<li> I don&#x27;t usually wear perfume because the fragrance bothers me</li>
<li> Unfortunately I didn&#x27;t pay attention to the fluid oz</li>
<li> The scent was flat and on my skin smelled weirdly of play dough?!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
<li> but overall was disappointed.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s very expensive for the size.</li>
<li> So disappointed</li>
<li> This price for this size bottle is outrageous.</li>

    <li> I had high hopes for this product but overall was disappointed. The scent was flat and on my skin smelled weirdly of play dough?!&lt;br /&gt;I liked the grapefruit scent a bit better but would not order either again. Maybe it just didn&#x27;t work with my chemistry since others seem to like it.</li>
    <li> I saw a beauty guru on Youtube raving about this product so I decided to try it. It smells really good! I put some on before going to The Fresh Market and got plenty compliments. I will definately order a couple more. Shipping was fast and the bottle is cute!!!</li>
    <li> Sweet and reminds me of a fragrance I had as a kid but I was looking for something light and natural.</li>
    <li> A lot more honey than coconut. I was looking for something more clean and beachy, but its very sweet</li>
    <li> Yummy smelling. This fragrance is delightful. I put it on just so I can enjoy it. I don&#x27;t usually wear perfume because the fragrance bothers me but this is mild and perfect. The bottle is darling too!</li>
    <li> Love love love this scent and so does my boyfriend who actually hates perfumes. Going to  purchase more for sure !!</li>
    <li> Love love the scent. I like warm, vanilla, coconut type sents. Kind of like suntan oil or lotion, like the beach! And this was great. Wonderful smell, not &amp;#34;over-perfumey&amp;#34;. The scent just doesn&#x27;t last very long... But I just reapply :o)</li>
    <li> I like the smell but it does not last very long.  It smells like vanilla, coconut and lime.  Really nice beachy smell that I like to wear in the summer or on vacation.</li>
    <li> I love the way it smells. Its very sweet and kind of reminds me of spring. BUT.....it wears off way to quick. Also this size bottle is super small.

I will purchase a bigger bottle.</li>

Being tht the scent doesn&#x27;t last I probably will not order a full size, but the scent s amazing</li>
    <li> I think this is my favorite perfume ever!!! I love it!! So yummy! I get compliments all day long when I wear it! I keep smelling my own wrists! Can&#x27;t wait to try their other scents!</li>

    <li> Love the scent! Unfortunately I didn&#x27;t pay attention to the fluid oz and I ended up paying $11-$12 on a tester bottle.</li>
    <li> This perfume doesn&#x27;t smell that  good and the bottle is smaller than my thumb. It&#x27;s very expensive for the size.</li>

    <li> tiny bottle, but smells great! My daughter loves this scent.</li>
    <li> Smelled old and musky</li>
