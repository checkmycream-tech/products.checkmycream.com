      <li>It&#x27;s amazing, I like it better than the almond milk hand creme.</li>
      <li>I use a prescription hand creme on the cuts &amp; use Burt&#x27;s Bees Banana Hand Creme to seal in the prescription creme to make it more effective.  </li>
      <li>The banana scent is strong, but it IS a concentrated [effective] hand cream.</li>
      <li>i love it.</li>
      <li>The almond is much better.</li>
      <li>I love this hand cream because I love all things Banana</li>
      <li>Love the smell and keeps my hands nice and soft for the winter season!</li>
      <li>Hands felt smooth and moisturized afterwards though.</li>
      <li>and it is super rich and moisturizing.</li>
      <li>Super hydrating cream</li>
      <li>but it warms up quickly.</li>
      <li>I was lucky to find this 2 oz size on a clearance counter for 3.99, so I tried.</li>
      <li>I like the creamy feel as well as the mild fragrance.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not crazy about the smell</li>
      <li>That all being said, the scent of banana is different and I liked it.  </li>
      <li>Soon, there were no visible maggots anywhere, his skin turned a nice healthy pink color, and he quickly fully recovered and lived for a few more years.  </li>
      <li>I love that it has a light, sweet banana scent to it and its thick but goes on smooth.</li>
      <li>First I have to say My wife bought this jar</li>
      <li>I much preferred the almond hand creme.  </li>
      <li>Plus, I really like the fragrance of the Banana Hand Creme.  </li>
      <li>Thanks so much for the affordability and the product been looking for it since when i was in the Marines and couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere</li>
      <li>The next day I was happy to find It worked not only to hold back odar</li>
      <li>The next day yesterday actually I went with both sides and same great results.</li>
      <li>Works great for us females on our cuticles around the nails and also for bottom of feet and heels to keep down that dry, cracky buildup.</li>
      <li>He was a pretty old bird when he died, too.  </li>
      <li>There was nothing to lose, and he would possibly smell better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, within a short time, he did smell better.  </li>
      <li>This banana hand creme was in the kit, and although I liked the banana scent, the creme was too thick.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s better than plain lotion.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll stick to the almond scented one, that&#x27;s what I get for trying something new.</li>
      <li>a slight bit of greasiness but otherwise a fine hand moisturizer</li>
      <li>I like the natural ingredients.</li>
      <li>It makes her hand soft...</li>
      <li>But he was acting normal, instead of depressed, and was preening his feathers and eating.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s non-toxic, except apparently to maggots, at least the ones on one very lucky Pekin ducky.</li>
      <li>recently I wanted to find a recipe for a natural homemade anti perspirant and or deodorant .I</li>
      <li>From the side of the clear glass jar you could see that the cream had separated into two different colored layers, white and a cream color.  </li>
      <li>Luckily its small enough to get thorough it all before the &amp;#34;bad&amp;#34; smell sets in.</li>
      <li>The creme is rich, smooth, a bit heavy, slow to absorb into the skin, and leaves a slight greasy feel.  </li>

    <li> This is a great product. I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple years now durring the winter months to combat splitting and cracking from dry skin. In all, I&#x27;m really happy with this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the seller, I had no issues with the product delivery. The item arrived well within the timeframe and cost that was indicated at the time of purchase.</li>
    <li> a slight bit of greasiness but otherwise a fine hand moisturizer</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not crazy about the smell but I like it overall.</li>
    <li> This product is very good. I got it for my gf and she loves it. It makes her hand soft...</li>
    <li> This stuff rocks. I&#x27;d been unable to find it since around 2006, so I when I saw it for sale here I bought two jars. The banana scent is strong, but it IS a concentrated [effective] hand cream. I&#x27;m almost a compulsive hand washer because of my job site &amp; this is an item that keeps my hands from being ashy &amp; painfully rough all day.</li>
    <li> Love the smell and keeps my hands nice and soft for the winter season!</li>
    <li> I like the creamy feel as well as the mild fragrance. It&#x27;s better than plain lotion. When it&#x27;s cold it&#x27;s a little hard to spread but it warms up quickly.</li>
    <li> First I have to say My wife bought this jar .And recently I wanted to find a recipe for a natural homemade anti perspirant and or deodorant .I went to the heath place to check on some of the ingredients ,But did not have the ist with me. While at home I was going though the bathroom looking for potential candidate&#x27;s for the list of ingredients .After picking up burt&#x27;s bee&#x27;s and bananas I read ingredients .Surprisingly only to find it contained a couple of potential ingredients beeswax being one.I decided to test it as a deodorant .Putting under one arm and the regular brand under the other after showering.The next day I was happy to find It worked not only to hold back odar but the sweat also. The next day yesterday actually I went with both sides and same great results. Now it is a little thick to put on with the hand I dabbed it on in different areas.Also I am going to find a diluent like a coconut butter to thin it out so as it won &#x27;t be stiff .Oh and men and french women with hair under there be carefull applying untill diluted . If you give it a try.</li>
    <li> Super hydrating cream</li>
    <li> I entitled my review as I did because some may find what I&#x27;m going to discuss revolting--namely maggots.  Years ago, I got a Burt&#x27;s Bees hand kit for Christmas.  This banana hand creme was in the kit, and although I liked the banana scent, the creme was too thick.  I much preferred the almond hand creme.  Hence, I just stuck the banana hand creme in the medicine cabinet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One summer thereafter, I was taking care of a Pekin duck with wounds that were infested by maggots.  It was a very bad infestation, and the poor duck already smelled like a dead bird. The vets have never saved any birds I brought them in that condition, and neither had I. I expected him to die shortly.  But when looking for something to put on his wounds, I noticed the banana hand creme and decide to try that. Why not?  There was nothing to lose, and he would possibly smell better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, within a short time, he did smell better.  He smelled like bananas.  The room he was in started smelling like bananas, too. The next day, I noticed there were no longer any maggots on him, except in a small wound I did not notice before.  I assumed the maggots just went deeper into his wounds, and he was still going to die.  But he was acting normal, instead of depressed, and was preening his feathers and eating.  So, I put banana creme on the small wound.  Soon, there were no visible maggots anywhere, his skin turned a nice healthy pink color, and he quickly fully recovered and lived for a few more years.  He was a pretty old bird when he died, too.  He even had a cataract in one eye.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, there&#x27;s my Burt&#x27;s Bees banana hand creme story.  I have no idea what in it killed the maggots, unless it was the bees wax. But for anyone dealing with a wounded animal, you might want to give it a try.  It&#x27;s non-toxic, except apparently to maggots, at least the ones on one very lucky Pekin ducky.</li>
    <li> LOVE IT! LOVE IT! This hand cream is one of those products that should be around the house. It&#x27;s amazing, I like it better than the almond milk hand creme. I love that it has a light, sweet banana scent to it and its thick but goes on smooth. Does it&#x27;s job in moisturizing.</li>
    <li> This smells like the laffy taffy brand banana candy and it is super rich and moisturizing.</li>
    <li> Excellent stuff!  Have been using it myself for years, bought this one for my grown up son for a Christmas stocking stuffer as his hands had been dry and cracking from the subzero temps. Works great for us females on our cuticles around the nails and also for bottom of feet and heels to keep down that dry, cracky buildup.</li>
    <li> Thanks so much for the affordability and the product been looking for it since when i was in the Marines and couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere lol thank you i love it. I will buy from again!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lindsey</li>
    <li> I bought this for my chapped winter damaged hands! I&#x27;ve used it for a few week now and I&#x27;ve seen a great improvement!!</li>
    <li> I was lucky to find this 2 oz size on a clearance counter for 3.99, so I tried. From the side of the clear glass jar you could see that the cream had separated into two different colored layers, white and a cream color.  But I stirred it and it mixed together well.  While a little goes a long way,  I wouldn&#x27;t pay the $12 Amazon price though.  The creme is rich, smooth, a bit heavy, slow to absorb into the skin, and leaves a slight greasy feel.  Hands felt smooth and moisturized afterwards though. That all being said, the scent of banana is different and I liked it.  Nice change. Scent does not linger very long though.  I will use this cream before bed during the winter and maybe wear a cotton glove to help in the moisturizing process.  Good for hands, feet, or lips.  I like the natural ingredients. I thought I would carry it in my purse, but when on the go, I need a moisturizer that soaks in faster and isn&#x27;t greasy feeling.</li>
    <li> I love this hand cream because I love all things Banana but after awhile it goes bad and takes on a weird or &amp;#34;bad&amp;#34; smell. Luckily its small enough to get thorough it all before the &amp;#34;bad&amp;#34; smell sets in.</li>
    <li> The almond is much better. The banana smells kinda funny/funky and is waxier and a little sticky.</li>
    <li> doesn&#x27;t seem to soak into my hands at all, even when wearing gloves to bed.  It&#x27;s probably just my skin, but it didn&#x27;t do anything for my hands.</li>
    <li> I love the texture and results of this product but the scent is disgusting. So nauseating and artificial smelling. I&#x27;ll stick to the almond scented one, that&#x27;s what I get for trying something new.</li>
    <li> I have excema really bad in our dry inland northwest winters.  My fingertips crack &amp; bleed.  I use a prescription hand creme on the cuts &amp; use Burt&#x27;s Bees Banana Hand Creme to seal in the prescription creme to make it more effective.  Plus, I really like the fragrance of the Banana Hand Creme.  It&#x27;s just an excellent product for my needs and works well for my wife&#x27;s hands, too.</li>
