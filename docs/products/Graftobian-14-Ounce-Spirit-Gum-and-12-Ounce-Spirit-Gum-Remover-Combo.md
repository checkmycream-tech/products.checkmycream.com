      <li>The perfect skin safe adhesive.</li>
      <li>and I don&#x27;t doubt the fact that it&#x27;s a good product.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve always looked for a good adhesive for gems and glitter to apply on my face.</li>

      <li>Product worked as needed :) I used this product to adhere a bindi to my forehead for a performance; it stayed on all night :)</li>
      <li>, i had to break the top to get it off</li>
      <li>My boyfriend seemed to use it more, I found soap and water worked a lot better.</li>
      <li>Love the product.</li>
      <li>It works ok.  </li>
      <li>Easy application and easy clean-up!</li>
      <li>I was very satisfied with this purchase and would happily order again next year!</li>
      <li>At first it seemed to hold really good, but once it was set/dried</li>
      <li>for instance, i don&#x27;t need to use the spirit gum remover when taking it off, i just rub it off and it&#x27;s really easy to remove, but it does help hold it together better than if i didn&#x27;t have it on.</li>
      <li>Good quality product, fast shipping.</li>
      <li>It came off easily at the end of the night.</li>
      <li>After pulling the zipper off I used the remover and it wiped the Spirit Gum away easily.</li>
      <li>It did not take the spirit gum off so easily.</li>
      <li>Easy to remove.</li>
      <li>i recommend this for latex ears and just about anything you need a really strong hold on but comes off when you need it to</li>
      <li>i did not actually needs the removal liquid but good to have it handy in</li>
      <li>As an avid cosplayer and it will be nice to not have to worry about bows and stuff.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very easy to apply and sticks right away (after a bit of tapping, of course).</li>
      <li>Worked fine for silicon Mr. Spock ears...</li>
      <li>Great for my various disguises.</li>
      <li>Super easy to use</li>
      <li>Worked great with my Comic Con costume and it was totally pain free and no skin inflammation</li>
      <li>Its pretty good so far</li>
      <li>but spirit gum is good for kid&#x27;s plays or short term use.  </li>
      <li>Shipment was quick...</li>
      <li>The gum held until I was ready for it to come off, and then the remover took care of it easily.</li>
      <li>After a few hours the edges of the mustache would peal off but over I&#x27;m happy with it.</li>
      <li>this is much needed for my special fx makeup, i use it with scar wax</li>
      <li>Just make sure you pull the mustache off nice and slow when you&#x27;re done because this stuff sticks really well.</li>
      <li>Worked exactly the way it should.</li>
      <li>This was my first time using Spirit Gum</li>
      <li>The spirit gum worked really well!</li>
      <li>Exactly what I needed for my Captain Jack Sparrow beard...</li>
      <li>I first made the mistake of using it over makeup be</li>
      <li>Fast shipping!</li>
      <li>So much better than white glue.</li>
      <li>Smaller than expected, but for the price this was a great deal.</li>
      <li>Really stuck onto my face.</li>
      <li>so i couldn&#x27;t get to much use out of it..</li>
      <li>however, it doesn&#x27;t really stick too well with it..</li>
      <li>Spirit gum works very well.</li>
      <li>Worked very well.</li>
      <li>Fast delivery.</li>
      <li>, I haven&#x27;t had the chance to do any big makeups with it yet, but I did a little prosthetic test yesterday and so far its done good.</li>
      <li>Started to peel off after a few hours of dancing and sweating, but overall very satisfied.</li>
      <li>my niece just loves it and we don&#x27;t have to keep buying new mustaches for her.</li>
      <li>wow!</li>
      <li>I find that it is just as easy to remove spirit gum with a little olive oil on a q-tip.</li>
      <li>It is a very very professional product and the beard stayed on him for a whole school day and into the traditional &amp;#34;trick or treat&amp;#34; period of Halloween.</li>
      <li>In fact I was really surprised at how well it held on.</li>
      <li>It works great but the bottle is so small that you would have to buy a few for bigger &amp;#34;projects&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>Really nice but a little messy, but</li>
      <li>My daughter had her giant fake nose and loved it.</li>
      <li>but as the directions said you have to glue it to your bare skin.</li>
      <li>Some parts slipped a bit late into the evening, but overall it held on much better than I expected.</li>
      <li>I would highly recommend this product to my other theatre friends.</li>
      <li>This was my first time using anything like this, so I have nothing to compare it to, but I&#x27;ve used it a few times now, twice to put facial hair on, once to glue a bone on my husband face for Halloween.</li>

<li> This was my first time using anything like this, so I have nothing to compare it to, but I&#x27;ve used it a few times now, twice to put facial hair on, once to glue a bone on my husband face for Halloween.</li>
<li> It worked ok, not great, didn&#x27;t hold all the prosthetic in place on my makeup/costume was a little unimpressed.</li>
<li> I recommend putting it on the skin instead of the prosthetic--otherwise it is easy to accidently stick it to the wrong place.</li>
<li> I made the mistake of mixing with the adhesive strips that came with the beard and the reaction created something STRONG, but difficult to remove.</li>
<li> Wash it with soap dry it off then gluebit.</li>
<li> I would say it only lasted around 4 hours before the bolts I used for my frankenstein costume came off and was hanging by a little part.</li>
<li> /&gt;I&#x27;ve used spirit gum before (different brand) with great results, so I&#x27;m not sure why it didn&#x27;t work this time - maybe just simply a bad bottle/batch, not a good brand, who knows.&lt;br</li>
<li> Got what we expected.</li>
<li> Works as expected and well.</li>
<li> Small tip to all the folks saying that it takes forever to stick, try tapping the area where the spirit gum was applied for a bit until you feel it get tacky, that&#x27;s what the directions on the back of the package says to do.</li>
<li> Just use generous amounts of remover and work SLOW especially with children.</li>
<li> Did the work without the mess</li>
<li> Fake noses, artificial chins, Vulcan ears, moles, and scars all stay in place for as long as I need and remove easily with the remover.</li>
<li> though you have to let the product set for a little before you try to attack what you put the spirit gum on , let it get tacky</li>
<li> I got this to use with the fake mustaches you can get on here because my 5 year old niece loves to play dress up.</li>
<li> It can be messy to apply if you touch it, or if you apply it where you didn&#x27;t intend to.</li>
<li> Small amount of sweat glue did not stick</li>
<li> Of course I had another mess to contend with after the fake blood and face paint, but that is to be expected.</li>
<li> If I had any complaint it would have to be the remover.</li>
<li> Yes the bottle is small but it tells you that so that&#x27;s what I was expecting!</li>
<li> /&gt;It wasn&#x27;t too difficult to remove afterwards, either.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> it is what it is, spirt gum and remover</li>
    <li> Worked great with my Comic Con costume and it was totally pain free and no skin inflammation what so ever.</li>
    <li> Used this stuff for a beard for a costume, Everybody was amazed that it worked so well, Came off like a breeze too.</li>
    <li> Kept my Elven ears on until I wanted them off. Easy to remove.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used it yet, since I can&#x27;t get the actual spirit gum bottle open, (reason for only four stars) but it came on time and I don&#x27;t doubt the fact that it&#x27;s a good product. Small tip to all the folks saying that it takes forever to stick, try tapping the area where the spirit gum was applied for a bit until you feel it get tacky, that&#x27;s what the directions on the back of the package says to do.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always looked for a good adhesive for gems and glitter to apply on my face. Spirit Glue is awesome; it is easy to remove and sweat proof!</li>
    <li> Always a good brand, quick delivery.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing! Yes the bottle is small but it tells you that so that&#x27;s what I was expecting! The product works great, I used it for my Captian Jack Sparrow costume and my beard, mustache and goatee!</li>
    <li> The spirit gum worked really well! The gum remover was a bit more optional to me. My boyfriend seemed to use it more, I found soap and water worked a lot better.</li>
    <li> The spirit gum works quite well. I recommend putting it on the skin instead of the prosthetic--otherwise it is easy to accidently stick it to the wrong place. The spirit gum remover contains parabens. I do not recommend it to anyone with sensetive skin. I used it to remove prosthetic elf ears and it caused a severe rash and swelling in both ears for about a week. I find that it is just as easy to remove spirit gum with a little olive oil on a q-tip.</li>
    <li> I got this to use with the fake mustaches you can get on here because my 5 year old niece loves to play dress up. After the initial glue from the mustaches stopped working I spread some of this on and wow! Works great, my niece just loves it and we don&#x27;t have to keep buying new mustaches for her. Just make sure you pull the mustache off nice and slow when you&#x27;re done because this stuff sticks really well. Then just put some of the remover on your finger and spread around then wipe of with a damp rag. I fully recommend with parent supervision.</li>
    <li> What I needed was Prosaide and I ended up buying that but spirit gum is good for kid&#x27;s plays or short term use.  If you&#x27;re going to get spirit gum, get this, not the Party City stuff.</li>
    <li> I used this to keep my Hobbit ears on and they held on for many hours (8-9hrs). They could probably hold on for longer. Easy application and easy clean-up!</li>
    <li> Used this for haloween and it lasted all night. Started to peel off after a few hours of dancing and sweating, but overall very satisfied.</li>
    <li> Works wonderfully, and it arrived in record time and perfect condition. 5/5</li>
    <li> It helped my latex elf ears stay on all day but sometimes it was a pain to put on and wouldn&#x27;t stick to well without a couple applications. BEWARE if it gets in your hair it will take forever to get out so try not to do that.</li>
    <li> The perfect skin safe adhesive.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work. It&#x27;s that simple.</li>
    <li> Works as expected and well.</li>
    <li> Really stuck onto my face. Worked exactly the way it should. I would highly recommend this product to my other theatre friends.</li>
    <li> Love the product. Really nice but a little messy, but againt, that may be just me.</li>
    <li> works great for cos play, thank you</li>
    <li> Its pretty good so far, I haven&#x27;t had the chance to do any big makeups with it yet, but I did a little prosthetic test yesterday and so far its done good.</li>
    <li> works wonderfully ! though you have to let the product set for a little before you try to attack what you put the spirit gum on , let it get tacky or else youll be holding what your trying to attack to yourself for quiet awhile . i recommend this for latex ears and just about anything you need a really strong hold on but comes off when you need it to</li>
    <li> Did the work without the mess</li>
    <li> This worked well Overall. Took a while for it to get sticky and I had to hold it for a while. I would say it only lasted around 4 hours before the bolts I used for my frankenstein costume came off and was hanging by a little part. I first made the mistake of using it over makeup be chi didn&#x27;t want to have to reduce it but as the directions said you have to glue it to your bare skin. Wash it with soap dry it off then gluebit. Wait a 1 or 2 until it gets tacky then use it</li>
    <li> Smaller than expected, but for the price this was a great deal. Can&#x27;t wait to use it.</li>
    <li> Shipment was quick... Product worked as needed :) I used this product to adhere a bindi to my forehead for a performance; it stayed on all night :)</li>
    <li> This was my first time using anything like this, so I have nothing to compare it to, but I&#x27;ve used it a few times now, twice to put facial hair on, once to glue a bone on my husband face for Halloween. Held everything in place without ripping my skin off. I recommend this</li>
    <li> this is much needed for my special fx makeup, i use it with scar wax however, it doesn&#x27;t really stick too well with it.. for instance, i don&#x27;t need to use the spirit gum remover when taking it off, i just rub it off and it&#x27;s really easy to remove, but it does help hold it together better than if i didn&#x27;t have it on. I also gave it only 3 starts because i COULD NOT open it! it was glued shut, i had to break the top to get it off so i couldn&#x27;t get to much use out of it..</li>
    <li> Works amazingly.  It survives a full day of sweat and water in carnival!! i will def continue to buy this product.</li>
    <li> This worked for Halloween apparatus very nicely. My daughter had her giant fake nose and loved it. I&#x27;m hoping I can keep it for use in future!</li>
    <li> I used this to stick a zipper to my face and it worked like a charm! This was my first time using Spirit Gum and I have no complaints. It&#x27;s very easy to apply and sticks right away (after a bit of tapping, of course). In fact I was really surprised at how well it held on. I went to an evening Halloween party and it stayed on all night, even as I moved, talked and drank. Some parts slipped a bit late into the evening, but overall it held on much better than I expected. It was only the lengths that pulled as I spoke, and the rest managed to keep the entire zipper in place anyway so it wasn&#x27;t even noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It wasn&#x27;t too difficult to remove afterwards, either. After pulling the zipper off I used the remover and it wiped the Spirit Gum away easily. Of course I had another mess to contend with after the fake blood and face paint, but that is to be expected. I was very satisfied with this purchase and would happily order again next year!</li>
    <li> It works ok.  I had a Fu Man Chu mustache and beard that I was wearing.  After a few hours the edges of the mustache would peal off but over I&#x27;m happy with it.</li>
    <li> Worked very well. Just use generous amounts of remover and work SLOW especially with children. I made the mistake of mixing with the adhesive strips that came with the beard and the reaction created something STRONG, but difficult to remove. If you have a choice, remove the adhesive strips and use only this spirit gum. It is a very very professional product and the beard stayed on him for a whole school day and into the traditional &amp;#34;trick or treat&amp;#34; period of Halloween.</li>
    <li> Both items served worked perfectly. The gum held until I was ready for it to come off, and then the remover took care of it easily.</li>
    <li> Great for my various disguises. Fake noses, artificial chins, Vulcan ears, moles, and scars all stay in place for as long as I need and remove easily with the remover. So much better than white glue.</li>
    <li> Worked fine for silicon Mr. Spock ears...i did not actually needs the removal liquid but good to have it handy in case you need it..</li>
    <li> Worked perfectly. The foam piece stayed on all day in the Phoenix heat.</li>
    <li> It worked ok, not great, didn&#x27;t hold all the prosthetic in place on my makeup/costume was a little unimpressed. At first it seemed to hold really good, but once it was set/dried the slightest bit of movement made had stuff falling off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used spirit gum before (different brand) with great results, so I&#x27;m not sure why it didn&#x27;t work this time - maybe just simply a bad bottle/batch, not a good brand, who knows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The remover worked great, cleaned off everything without leaving any residue.</li>
    <li> This held my bindi all day in 80 degree sweaty forehead temperature.</li>
    <li> I used this to glue a bald cap to my head.  It can be messy to apply if you touch it, or if you apply it where you didn&#x27;t intend to.</li>
    <li> Small amount of sweat glue did not stick</li>
    <li> It works great but the bottle is so small that you would have to buy a few for bigger &amp;#34;projects&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I have heard of the uses of spirit gum. As an avid cosplayer and it will be nice to not have to worry about bows and stuff.</li>
    <li> Worked well. Fast shipping!</li>
    <li> Fast delivery. Got what we expected.</li>
    <li> Spirit gum works very well. Remover is truly a bonus. Exactly what I needed for my Captain Jack Sparrow beard...</li>
    <li> it is just what it says. Spirit gum and remover. it worked</li>
    <li> Super easy to use and it helped hold the elf ears in place, as well as my wig, for a costume I wore. Just follow the directions and you will not have an issue.</li>
    <li> worked great during my daughter&#x27;s dance competition</li>
    <li> worked wonders for my sisters make up this year. If I had any complaint it would have to be the remover. It did not take the spirit gum off so easily.</li>
    <li> Held up through the night no need for the removal glue. It came off easily at the end of the night.</li>
    <li> Good quality product, fast shipping.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t tried it yet, but heard good reviews about it. Packaging was just fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, WAY SMALLER THAN YOU WOULD EXPECT.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In my pictures I compare it to a peppermint.. because It is soooo tiny.</li>
