<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> loved this body wash will reorder when I run out.  Very reasonably priced and does a great job and the smell is wonderful.</li>
    <li> I am so glad that I can always find what I want on Amazon. This is the best shower gel in the universe. I have allergies and&lt;br /&gt;have been using it for years and all of a sudden I couldn&#x27;t find it at any of the stores I shop in. But thanks to Amazon I now&lt;br /&gt;have a closet full of it. It has a very pleasant and subtle fragrance and doesn&#x27;t contain any harsh chemicals.</li>
    <li> For some reason I&#x27;ve never tried this brand of body wash &amp; just so happen to be a bit broke at the moment, so I got a few bottles at freddys for under $2 each.&lt;br /&gt;First off, this Ocean Breeze smells really nice &amp; clean. This body wash doesn&#x27;t have a lot of oils like some of the others &amp; that makes a BIG difference. Very nice lather,rinses well,left my skin feeling &amp; smelling GOOD.</li>
    <li> Fantastic scent and really cleans well</li>
    <li> Nothing special but it&#x27;s cheap and it&#x27;s soap</li>
    <li> we&#x27;ve always used Suave Body Wash- it does the job, smells good &amp; it is a good value price for body wash</li>
    <li> This Suave product has a clean, fresh scent that stays with me.  I use it daily in my shower - it just takes a small amount, so the bottle lasts, too.  I&#x27;ve tried many of their other scents, but this is my favorite since it isn&#x27;t sweet.  It works for man or woman - not perfume-y - just clean smelling!</li>
    <li> Started using this instead of regular soap and really like it.  It lathers nicely, has a mild scent and I don&#x27;t have to worry about germs other other bacteria such as MRSA that can reside on bar soaps.</li>
    <li> Cleans well enough and smells like fresh soap.</li>
    <li> A little goes a long way and now that I&#x27;m able to use the subscribe &amp; save I&#x27;m lovin the savings!</li>
    <li> This was a good deal for the price we paid.  We love Suave products and glad we made this purchase.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s OK.  Scent is fine, nice.  Inexpensive, so that&#x27;s a plus.  It&#x27;s soap, it works.  I prefer Olay and wouldn&#x27;t buy this again, but that&#x27;s just my personal opinion and it was a change up soap.  I actually am using it for hand soap in my dispensers and not as a body wash.</li>
    <li> Good body soap. The scent is nice for women or men. It doesn&#x27;t smell like a tough brute man but I think either gender would be fine with the scent. Lathers nicely too.</li>
    <li> The package always arrives right on time which saves us a trip to the local store to purchase individually. It typically lasts long enough for the next shipment.</li>
    <li> price is higher than my local grocery</li>
    <li> This product is really good. The smell does relax you and take you far away. It leaves u feeling and smelling fresh.</li>
    <li> I like this product.  My husband and i use body wash every time in the shower, and this is a good buy and convient</li>
    <li> Smells ...like the Beach and feels nice and smooth and bubbly.  Works good in my wall mounted soap holder in the shower.</li>
    <li> I love the simplicity of the Ocean Breeze scent- it&#x27;s subtle and refreshing. I also love getting these in a case, so we don&#x27;t run out!</li>
    <li> I enjoy this body wash because not only does it smell great, but it takes so little to lather up and the Suave price is always right!</li>
    <li> It has a nice smell to it could be cheaper I can get for one dollar a bottle at my local supermarket</li>
    <li> very good sent, I love it</li>
    <li> Items reached on time, packaging was good and the items are as advertised on the site - correct size and quantity. they smell great and produces lather quickly with small quantities of body-wash.</li>
    <li> We love this stuff. I like how it makes my old skin feel silky. And we like the scent , it is a great way to waken in the mornings. I use this daily.</li>
    <li> Great economical body wash.  I have purchased other bargain brands that are like water.  Suave does an exact job of providing an inexpensive high quality product.</li>
    <li> Nice body wash.  Pleasant  fragrance.</li>
    <li> the best for the price</li>
    <li> I really like the cucumber-melon, and this is also a favorite, you smell GREAT when you get out of the shower!</li>
    <li> This product was given to me as a gift. I had to order more because my son loves it also.</li>
    <li> My 12 year old son asks me to get this scent for him. He loves the fresh clean scent.</li>
    <li> What can you say about body wash?  I love the smell of this stuff.  It&#x27;s cheaper than many leading brands, but it&#x27;s the only one my family will use.  It cleans and rinses of easy after a long day in the shower.  Love it!!</li>
    <li> I have used this and loved it. I could not find it in one of our grocery stores near by me and when I did it was more than the price on here for one than it was for one in a pack of six so I bought it on here. Would recommend.</li>
    <li> This is great body wash, it smells great, feels lovely foaming all over your whole bod. I like buying it by the case, especially as we will always have some available just when we need it. It&#x27;s a great value as well.</li>
    <li> Nice and clean, not overly perfumed.</li>
    <li> I know it is cheap, but leaves skin dry and itchy. Worth spending more for a better product. The sent is good though.</li>
    <li> The ocean breeze scent is great and I have received many compliments about my &amp;#34;colonge&amp;#34;.... When I say I didn&#x27;t put on colonge it&#x27;s only body wash people are impressed.  Give it a try.</li>
    <li> The 6-ounce pack couldn&#x27;t be more convenient. To my relief, the bottles arrived without leaking. The scents are nice. The consistency is nice and thick and easy to hold in your hand. And you can&#x27;t beat Subscribe and Save for the convenience.</li>
    <li> Great product, body wash is better for your skin than regular soap. Your arms, chest, legs don&#x27;t regularly need the hard core power of bar soap, so this product fits the bill. Less drying than bar soap.</li>
    <li> Great Price!  Love this brand!</li>
    <li> I like this - it washes my body and keeps me clean.  and its cheap.  and comes in a big bottle.</li>
    <li> Nice body wash, great scent for the whole family, reasonable price but you can buy this in the 16oz size for $1.50 a bottle at Target and Walmart, so not worth buying online.</li>
    <li> Perfectly priced for a bachelor!  Doesn&#x27;t leave your skin dry, and doesn&#x27;t have any overwhelming or lingering scents.  I recommend this to anyone who just wants to get clean cheaply.</li>
    <li> Nice scent.  Good amount of lather without using a lot.  Very economical because Amazon&#x27;s price is so low compared to other retailers.  Much cheaper than Target, Walmart etc.</li>
    <li> This has a very nice scent.  Washes off clean.  Nice you can turn it upside down so you get all of the soap in the container.</li>
    <li> good for the price but not of great quality.</li>
    <li> Great smell, a little beach and a little cologne of a scent. Gender neutral, so it&#x27;s great for girls or guys. It&#x27;s not moisturizing, but lathers decently and cleans well. I buy this stuff all the time.</li>
    <li> Nice scent and decent quality shampoo for the price............5 stars.</li>
    <li> We have two boys (ages 11 and 10) who come home from swim practice at the YMCA, smelling like pool water. We experimented with the ever-expanding product line of cleansers, everything from the Axe line of exhilarating (read: cloying) body gels to [[ASIN:B003ZYKUYY Suave Naturals Ocean Breeze body wash]].&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Suave&#x27;s \\&quot;mineral rich sea algae extract and skin conditioning vitamin e\\&quot; wasn&#x27;t the strongest selling point. My wife noted the \\&quot;subtle breezy scent.\\&quot; Axe body wash appeals to young boys and men but the blast/buzz/temptation marketing and the bowl-you-over power of their body wash scents are best in moderation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The need for subtly brings us to a less-expensive, more-pleasant body wash solution with Suave, which is currently on sale at Amazon for $2 or less per bottle. That is less than half the price of a comparably-sized bottle of Axe body wash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will our sons forego Axe forever? Not likely. But we can temper the freight train of fragrance so long as they live under our roof. I recommend Suave for value and for its \\&quot;subtle breezy scent.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rating: Five stars</li>
    <li> Keeps my balls somewhat not stinky</li>
    <li> I love this body wash. The Ocean Breeze scent lasts all day long and is so refreshing.</li>
    <li> I like this body wash, glad I tried it.  I like to switch every so often....gave this a try.  Smells great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend product.</li>
    <li> This body wash is easy on the wallet and easy on the skin. Affordable to keep in all shower stalls.</li>
    <li> My oldest daughter reached driving age not to long ago and one of the requirements for her license was for her to successfully change a flat tire on her own. I gave her a quick visual of where the equ⋯⋯</li>
    <li> Use this product every night as bubble bath and body wash. My favorite.</li>
    <li> At first I thought this was gonna be awesome.  We love the product use it all the time, but after looking at the prices it is cheaper for me to get at walmart.  So i wont get it on here until it goes on sale.</li>
    <li> The price was right, and this body wash did get me clean.  However, this Suave product isn&#x27;t as strong as Axe or some more expensive body washes.  I added tea tree oil to this in order to strengthen it.  Otherwise, I&#x27;d have used this Suave body wash up in a short time.  It&#x27;s kinda weak in removing body oil.</li>
