      <li>Avon has many good skin care products at reasonable prices.</li>
      <li>the smell of it goes away very quickly.</li>
      <li>, I think it is too strong.</li>
      <li>The apricot/rose scent is strong, I like it, but my boyfriend said it was way too strong.  </li>
      <li>AND THE PRICE IS FABULOUS,</li>
      <li>and she liked it so much she took one of mine home with her.</li>
      <li>It is not my primary face cream</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s light...</li>
      <li>I just started using this after reading great reviews I ordered this and to my surprise this replenishing cream works better than I expected.</li>
      <li>, I am 41 years old, looking good.</li>
      <li>It must be doing something right, I&#x27;m 32 and get mistaken for being mom&#x27;s grand daughter all the time.</li>
      <li>I agree with everyone in that it is very non-greasy and really creates a dewy type of look to your face that is so nice!</li>
      <li>I was so excited that you had this item on your website.</li>
      <li>Greatest Product I&#x27;ve been using this product for approximately 30 years just love it.</li>
      <li>It works great for dry patches anytime as well.</li>
      <li>Keeps my skin healthy and happy, even against harsh winter weather.</li>
      <li>,I also don&#x27;t smell a strong scent very light and the price is great compared to other high end name brands I have used.</li>
      <li>This cream absorbs quickly, is lightweight, and does have a floral fragrance to it, which I could do without, but it doesn&#x27;t affect how the product works.  </li>
      <li>It seems more light and keeps face soft longer.</li>
      <li>Very satisfied overall.</li>
      <li>I also wish it smelled a little nicer, but again, if you have sensitive skin, this might be the perfect thing for you.</li>
      <li>it is great year round.</li>
      <li>This completely cleared my skin, gave it a glow and made my makeup look better on my face.</li>
      <li>The only problem was when I took the top off, the product was not sealed.  </li>
      <li>I am 31 and experiencing patches of acne for the first time since adolescence.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using Nutura since 1999 and my skin is still smooth and soft</li>
      <li>I am really like it!</li>
      <li>I have used this cream since it first came out.  </li>
      <li>, it&#x27;s very creamy and leaves your skin brightened.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t like scented products on my face, but I really like how it works.</li>
      <li>I really like it and feel like I&#x27;ll be using this product for years to come.  </li>
      <li>Works very well.</li>
      <li>I plan to purchase more in the near future.</li>
      <li>but I do use it often &amp; much of the time on my neck &amp; chest, not only because of the moisturizing but also because of the very fresh smell that whiffs up.  </li>
      <li>The consistency is medium-weight: not as light as Clinique&#x27;s Dramatically Different Moisturizer, but not nearly as heavy as Eucerin.</li>
      <li>For this price I will be using this as my main face cream moving forward.</li>
      <li>Out performs many brands that are 3 x more expensive.</li>
      <li>It is truly sub-par for my normal skin.</li>
      <li>I love this stiff.</li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t live without it</li>
      <li>I am not sure if it stops wrinkles, but I know it makes my makeup application go on so much better and leaves a glow to my skin.  </li>
      <li>If you use a small amount you won&#x27;t feel it at all, but it is very moisturizing and light, not oily.</li>
      <li>On the plus side, it was really cheap until you add the shipping, that made it not worth what I paid for it!</li>
      <li>I use proactiv extra strength and it has been really drying out my skin, although it has completely cleared my acne.</li>
      <li>and now it&#x27;s just really soft and supple.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I am 31 and experiencing patches of acne for the first time since adolescence. I have tried a mineral face mask and a salicylic acid peel to help with the acne...but the peel caused the areas to become dry and peel badly.  This face cream is awesome.  After one use, the dryness was gone.  The smell is a little weird (like baby aspirin)...but it&#x27;s light...so I&#x27;ll keep using it.  If you only use a small amount this product will not be too heavy and it did NOT cause any new breakouts! :)  I have sensitive skin and usually break out after trying a new product, but not this time!  It is very light and whipped...but I noticed if I apply a heavier layer at night...it feels more like Vaseline.  If you use a small amount you won&#x27;t feel it at all, but it is very moisturizing and light, not oily. I really like it and feel like I&#x27;ll be using this product for years to come.  The only problem was when I took the top off, the product was not sealed.  So, I&#x27;m not sure if this usually comes with a tamper resistant seal or not.</li>
    <li> This product has been out for many years and it is still the best facial cream on the market.  Out performs many brands that are 3 x more expensive.</li>
    <li> My girlfriend told me about this cream. I have had a problem with light acne in my late 20&#x27;s due to dryness of my skin. This completely cleared my skin, gave it a glow and made my makeup look better on my face. It&#x27;s a night cream but I use it during the day as well. I was a little heavy at first, but my skin became acclimated to it and now it&#x27;s just really soft and supple. Great product and the price cannot be beat!</li>
    <li> Not good for sensitive skin - it gave me tiny bumps on my face!</li>
    <li> I sold Avon back in 1988 while I was in college and started using Nutura.  I was 19, now I am 45 and I don&#x27;t look it one bit!  People mistake me for someone still in their 20&#x27;s all the time.</li>
    <li> This was not what I expected. It did not provide much moisture and my face was still dry. I wasted my money and wished I could have returned it.</li>
    <li> This is the only lotion I use on my face! It&#x27;s light weight and is wonderful! It must be doing something right, I&#x27;m 32 and get mistaken for being mom&#x27;s grand daughter all the time.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful beautifying cream.  I use it to blend my makeup and on my skin to soften dry skin.  I get compliments when I wear it. I am not sure if it stops wrinkles, but I know it makes my makeup application go on so much better and leaves a glow to my skin.  I hope Avon never stops making it.</li>
    <li> I am really like it! because I have been use this for some months and the results are be great!</li>
    <li> It is a very good product.</li>
    <li> I used this years ago, and now that I have found it again, I am very pleased. I love the way it makes my face feel when I apply it under makeup. And, the smell is the same as it was so long ago. Maybe it is just the nostalgia, but I love this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for many years and was so disappointed to hear Avon discontinued it. So many competitors products smell like soap. This one has a relaxing scent, perfect for putting on before bedtime. It&#x27;s not oily or too thick like the others. It&#x27;s perfect and it&#x27;ll be gone soon. Sad to see it go.</li>
    <li> Feels absolutely wonderful on face!!!  No greasy feeling at all.</li>
    <li> My husband loves this cream.  He&#x27;s been using it got years.</li>
    <li> It was supposed to be a new item, yet some of the product was missing. Disappointed</li>
    <li> It was very light in texture, seemed ok, but I just couldn&#x27;t get past the weird almost plastic like smell!</li>
    <li> I have used this Nurtura cream for many years.  It is not my primary face cream but I do use it often &amp; much of the time on my neck &amp; chest, not only because of the moisturizing but also because of the very fresh smell that whiffs up.  A very nice moisturizing cream.</li>
    <li> Smells like mothballs or cleaning products...awful smell. Can&#x27;t get over it!</li>
    <li> Very nice product smells wonderful feels velvety.  I knew I&#x27;d like it Avon has good products at affordable prices.  Product came in a timely manner and I didn&#x27;t have any problems.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve use this cream for year. Love it</li>
    <li> I just started using this after reading great reviews I ordered this and to my surprise this replenishing cream works better than I expected.I use this in the morning and evening and my face feels so smooth this is a great moisturizer that is not oily and absorbs into my skin leaves my face with a healthy glow ,I also don&#x27;t smell a strong scent very light and the price is great compared to other high end name brands I have used.</li>
    <li> I have been using this cream for over 10 years. I have a radiant younger looking skin. Very satisfied overall.</li>
    <li> It makes my face feel so soft. It smells like roses which isn&#x27;t great but the smell of it goes away very quickly. It smells like the old Melrose hand lotion. I would recommend this product to others.</li>
    <li> This is one of the jars I purchased, and I was extremely satisfied with this product. I plan to purchase more in the near future.</li>
    <li> Greatest Product I&#x27;ve been using this product for approximately 30 years just love it. Advise everyone to try it and see.</li>
    <li> This is the best face and eye cream I&#x27;ve ever used and I&#x27;ve been using it for over 30 years.  I use it sparingly but it seems to do the trick at night as well as under makeup.  I love this cream.  I hope Avon never stops making it.  I know they have several new face creams but I&#x27;m sticking with the one i&#x27;ve been happy with for over 30 years.</li>
    <li> My aunt loves this product</li>
    <li> I have used this cream since it first came out.  I am 54 and constantly told I look like I am in my thirties.  Everyone asks me what I use and I tell them Nurtura.  It is the best lotion I have ever used for the price.  I was so excited that you had this item on your website.</li>
    <li> Nurtura feels thin on my skin.  It is well priced, but I may chose another product.</li>
    <li> A little too thick for my taste, but if you have very dry skin, this would be just the ticket.  I also wish it smelled a little nicer, but again, if you have sensitive skin, this might be the perfect thing for you.</li>
    <li> This is a nice face cream by Avon. It seems more light and keeps face soft longer. I just need to remember to use it daily. I love the smell and texture. This is a keeper.</li>
    <li> This cream is nice but on the thicker side. I love how it feels on my skin but I will not need to be using it daily as a night cream. It works great for dry patches anytime as well. Try this cream if you have very dry skin - you will see results immediately. I don&#x27;t care for the smell, but I don&#x27;t hate it either.</li>
    <li> I love this product. Will buy again!</li>
    <li> I am using this product but have not seen any changes, so I would not recommend this yet to anyone.</li>
    <li> I have used this for years &amp; it is great!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for two weeks now on my forearms and elbows.  I wanted to give it time to make a difference.  It is truly sub-par for my normal skin. It doesn&#x27;t even have a pleasant aroma. The only really dry skin is my elbows.  Also, one of the jars (of course the second one I opened) was half full.  Not happy with this and now not happy with seller.  On the plus side, it was really cheap until you add the shipping, that made it not worth what I paid for it!</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t live without it it&#x27;s the best cream ever I have been using it for years and will continue to use it</li>
    <li> I have been using this moisturizer for years.  It blends into the skin and is non-greasy.  An excellent facial moisturizer!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Nutura since 1999 and my skin is still smooth and soft, I am 41 years old, looking good. It&#x27;s a great face cream</li>
    <li> I love this stiff. i use to sale avon and fell in love with it. it is great year round. I hate to be w/out it.</li>
    <li> I would have given it 5 starts but for the scent - I don&#x27;t like scented products on my face, but I really like how it works. The consistency is medium-weight: not as light as Clinique&#x27;s Dramatically Different Moisturizer, but not nearly as heavy as Eucerin. Keeps my skin healthy and happy, even against harsh winter weather.</li>
    <li> This is a very nice face cream.&lt;br /&gt;It is a none greasy product.&lt;br /&gt;I do like it. The only thing I don&#x27;t like about it&lt;br /&gt; is the smell, I think it is too strong.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years and it&#x27;s the only moisturizer I would ever use on my face. I would recommend this product to others.</li>
    <li> Used by my grandmother and by my mother, I&#x27;m never without Nurtura.  It&#x27;s a wonderful night cream.  Avon has many good skin care products at reasonable prices.</li>
    <li> the best cream from AVON!</li>
    <li> I USE THIS PRODUCT ALL YEAR LONG IT IS THE BEST AND THE PRICE IS FABULOUS,WOULD RECOMMEND THIS FOR MEN AND WOMEN.</li>
    <li> I like Avon Solutions Nurtura Replenishing Cream, it&#x27;s very creamy and leaves your skin brightened.  The apricot/rose scent is strong, I like it, but my boyfriend said it was way too strong.  So I just use it when I&#x27;m home alone.</li>
    <li> Perfect face cream and best price I love Avon I hope they keep carrying this cream that&#x27;s really nice and affordable</li>
    <li> Put this on before I go to bed. Very refreshing smell! No more dry patches on my skin. Replenishing sooo good!</li>
    <li> I love how well this cream moisturizes!  My skin feels to soft when I use this. This cream absorbs quickly, is lightweight, and does have a floral fragrance to it, which I could do without, but it doesn&#x27;t affect how the product works.  My preferred use for this is as a night cream.  No wonder Avon has been making this for so long!  It does contain parabens, so do not use this during the day if you will be exposed to sunlight.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this cream.  My skin feels and stays so soft, I only wish it came in a larger container.  I would recommend it to a friend, over and over again.  My mom came to visit and she liked it so much she took one of mine home with her.</li>
    <li> Have used it for years! Works very well.</li>
    <li> I use proactiv extra strength and it has been really drying out my skin, although it has completely cleared my acne. I have tried all different face creams but they were all too greasy and made my skin feel really oily. I decided to try Nurtura and it has been incredible! I agree with everyone in that it is very non-greasy and really creates a dewy type of look to your face that is so nice! I use it at night and during the day and I have no complaints. For this price I will be using this as my main face cream moving forward. Very happy with it!</li>
    <li> I like this because it moisturizes well but I do not like the smell.  It takes some getting used to. I wish it was unscented.</li>
