      <li>Arrived on time and in perfect condition.</li>
      <li>The tweezers are as described, but did not work out best for my intended use.</li>
      <li>these tweezers are a great design, but won&#x27;t loosen up even with oil, so they&#x27;re not the easiest to use.</li>

      <li>Great for eyebrows.</li>

      <li>The price is good, However it did not work for me.  </li>
      <li>Good value and reliable functionality.</li>
      <li>A GOOD PRICE AND</li>
      <li>Good tweeting scissor.</li>
      <li>This is a good grooming aid.</li>
      <li>They were almost like some I&#x27;ve had for 43 yrs very pleased</li>
      <li>Love these tweezers!</li>
      <li>These are totally adequate and very good quality for the $...</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s ok, good for the price.</li>
      <li>well made and nice to use.  </li>
      <li>OK I will add it is better that tweezers that pinch with your thumb and index finger, that don&#x27;t have loops for your fingers, as this one does!  </li>
      <li>I find that it doesn&#x27;t work too well for very fine hairs, but gets the job done for most.</li>
      <li>also, They are very comfortable to hold</li>
      <li>THESE WILL BE SATISFIED.</li>
      <li>I love these.</li>
      <li>It is just OK.</li>
      <li>precision functionality makes and excellent extension in jobs that require extra manual dexterity.  </li>
      <li>tHESE FIT THE BILL!  </li>
      <li>.. would spend a bit more and get a better one..</li>
      <li>/&gt;The blunt tip is much better than slanted tip type.</li>
      <li>The satin edge is better than what I have.</li>
      <li>They work better because of the handle.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I do like the scissor-like design more than the slanted tweezers because it is easier to grip on.</li>
      <li>Instead any hair I gripped either slipped right through the grooves, or the grooves effectively cut the hair before I could pull it out.</li>
      <li>These are easy to use and the scissor effect helps with arthritic hands.</li>
      <li>So far works good, ok for the price</li>
      <li>While I do not like them as well as the Revlong slanted tweezers, they are pretty nice.  </li>
      <li>The price is good, they are well made, and will grab larger hairs very easily.</li>
      <li>AT ELIMANATING THOSE FINE HAIRS.  </li>
      <li>Tip is fine and it&#x27;s study.</li>
      <li>These are fine, work well and do the job.  </li>
      <li>Fortunately I ordered these on a whim, and they are great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>they&#x27;re PERFECT for that, so if you&#x27;re looking to tweeze a heavy unibrow than this is the style you want) ...</li>
      <li>Very accurate, as the ends of this Tweezer meet perfectly, whereas the other kind sometimes don&#x27;t meet as well, especially after time.</li>
      <li>- they&#x27;re really special and for years and years I treasured them with my life.</li>
      <li>- they&#x27;re really special and for years and years I treasured them with my life.</li>
      <li>I really think more people need to be exposed to them.</li>
      <li>I really think more people need to be exposed to them.</li>
      <li>Good enough for the money.</li>
      <li>For the price that I paid for it, it is a pretty decent tweezer, but there is nothing spectacular about it.  </li>
      <li>Cheap, just exactly like one I picked up at a flea market for $1.</li>
      <li>(if you were really patient you could tweeze your legs with these because you can easily grab a bunch of hairs all at once - between 5-10+ depending on the thickness and fullness of the hair).</li>
      <li>My old one (that is more than 30 years old!) does a slightly better job.</li>
      <li>Anyway, I rarely used these on my eyebrows (except for the two pesky hairs that grow between my eyebrows -</li>
      <li>I got two in one pack, which was also exciting.</li>
      <li>Definitely worth the price i paid for them.</li>
      <li>I figured for almost $10 these would have a nice tight fit at the end and pluck the finest of hairs...</li>
      <li>Was too small for my thumb and finger, so I opened it up more and it now works much better,  but the opening I created catches the edge of my finger or thumb sometimes.</li>
      <li>It works pretty well.</li>
      <li>Out of all of the different brands on amazon, the ones I had looked most like these</li>
      <li>I have a similar tweezer, thought I couldn&#x27;t find a better one</li>
      <li>Next time I&#x27;ll invest in a better quality product.</li>
      <li>They just don&#x27;t grip hair ends effectively enough to warrant a better rating.  </li>
      <li>I prefer this style of tweezers for ear/nose grooming, actually, it&#x27;s the only type I&#x27;m able to use easily.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve always used this type of tweezers and these are as good as any I&amp;#34;e used in the past.</li>
      <li>Strong, simple and works as advertised.</li>
      <li>I got it for moderately fine facial hair.  </li>
      <li>Exactly what I wanted, high quality instrument.  </li>
      <li>so I haven&#x27;t had much use for these lately (hence how they somehow got lost, when they used to be my most important beauty tool).</li>
      <li>These work very well</li>
      <li>and these give you a much much stronger grip.</li>
      <li>They ALSO work really well for plucking someone else&#x27;s eyebrows - since it can be kind of hard to get the right angle</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had normal tweezers kind of jump out if my hand because I missed or was in an odd position.</li>
      <li>Better than expected!  </li>
      <li>Now with the new satin edge tweezers, she doesn&#x27;t have any problems.  </li>
      <li>There&#x27;s just something about the extra strength and maneuverability that the handles give you that make these perfect for pulling out awkwardly placed hairs, a bunch of hair at once</li>
      <li>The edges were very thick and not quite coming together for a nice grip.</li>
      <li>Do not waste your money on it.</li>
      <li>The shipping was not fast, took over 2 weeks to get them, but it was worth the wait.</li>
      <li>They are not terrible, especially for the price, so if all you want is a well priced slightly above average quality pair of tweezers, they&#x27;ll do.</li>
      <li>I mainly used them to pluck facial hair between waxing appointments ...</li>
      <li>I guess I expected them to be a little better for the price, but they are not bad overall, and while I suspect not very durable, probably somewhat durable.</li>
      <li>Tweezers, especially a pair with enough spring to do the job, were a real hassle.</li>
      <li>They were also great for plucking any other stray body hairs (those weird hairs that pop up around nipples, for example) ...</li>
      <li>Tweezer is good quality and grasps finer hair without cutting it off or breaking it.  </li>
      <li>OK but no better than any other.  </li>
      <li>The corners of the pinching end could be more round, and these tweezers do not feel very durable because the fulcrum has seemed to get just a little loose in just a short period of time.  </li>
      <li>They work well unlike some other brands I have used Thanks</li>
      <li>/&gt;It takes a few minutes to getting the knack of using this design, but once you do, I doubt you&#x27;ll go back to your old straight pair.</li>
      <li>I have tried several pairs of tweezers, most of them do not perform to my liking, and these are not much better than average.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Tweezer works well---had to pry finger holes bigger as they were uncomfortable to use.</li>
    <li> For the price that I paid for it, it is a pretty decent tweezer, but there is nothing spectacular about it.  I still have trouble getting the tiny eyebrow hair that just sprouts out - I think it is because the edge is not sharp enough, so that it is hard to pull out the tiny ones out.  I do like the scissor-like design more than the slanted tweezers because it is easier to grip on.</li>
    <li> I purchased thesed for my mother who has diminished eye sight and difficulty using traditional tweezers. They work wonderfully.</li>
    <li> I use this to pluck my nose hairs. It works pretty well. also, They are very comfortable to hold and I like the angle that they are at.</li>
    <li> These are fine, work well and do the job.  I&#x27;ve always used this type of tweezers and these are as good as any I&amp;#34;e used in the past.</li>
    <li> They were almost like some I&#x27;ve had for 43 yrs very pleased</li>
    <li> The price is good, However it did not work for me.  Personally.  I got it for moderately fine facial hair.  The edges were very thick and not quite coming together for a nice grip.</li>
    <li> Better than expected!  I was not sure the grip would be solid enough to work but the ends meet up perfectly and the tool does its job perfectly. Great price.  Arrived on time and in perfect condition.</li>
    <li> I work with my hands all day long, and usually by the evening I&#x27;ve got that dreaded carpal tunnel numbness that just about drives me crazy when I&#x27;m trying to do something that requires precision with my hands. Tweezers, especially a pair with enough spring to do the job, were a real hassle. Fortunately I ordered these on a whim, and they are great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It takes a few minutes to getting the knack of using this design, but once you do, I doubt you&#x27;ll go back to your old straight pair.</li>
    <li> I recommend this product to tohers because it has a thin tip that allows for gripping the small and short hair.  It gets the hair out from the root.</li>
    <li> Not the greatest quality.</li>
    <li> these tweezers are a great design, but won&#x27;t loosen up even with oil, so they&#x27;re not the easiest to use.</li>
    <li> Strong, simple and works as advertised. Good value and reliable functionality. I would recommend for purchase to anyone looking for such a product.</li>
    <li> I had to use WD40 to make the stiff blades move.  Metal is quite flimsy.  What can you expect for $4.00 ?</li>
    <li> i HAVE FACIAL HAIRS ON MY CHIN, AND FIND IT HARD TO FIND A GOOOOD PAIR OF TWEEZERS.  tHESE FIT THE BILL!  A GOOD PRICE AND THE WORK WELL AT ELIMANATING THOSE FINE HAIRS.  i THINK WHOMEVER PURCHASE THESE WILL BE SATISFIED.</li>
    <li> I love these. Definitely worth the price i paid for them. They have a great grip on the hairs. Awesome!</li>
    <li> This is not a high quality product! Save your money and look for something that won&#x27;t break after 3 uses. Very disappointing!</li>
    <li> They don&#x27;t grip as well as I thought they would when I bought it.</li>
    <li> Cheap, just exactly like one I picked up at a flea market for $1. Do not waste your money on it.</li>
    <li> These tweezers won&#x27;t grab a single hair. These are in the running for &amp;#34;My worst Amazon purchase&amp;#34;. Should have gotten off my butt and went to the drugstore.....lesson learned.</li>
    <li> I figured for almost $10 these would have a nice tight fit at the end and pluck the finest of hairs... not so. They are awkward to use (I have been using scissor like tweezers for years) and dont have the quality I thought they would for that kind of money.</li>
    <li> My wife just love these tweezers, the one she had made it very difficult to pull out the thin shorter hair.  Now with the new satin edge tweezers, she doesn&#x27;t have any problems.  The shipping was not fast, took over 2 weeks to get them, but it was worth the wait.</li>
    <li> Not nearly as good as flat tipped tweezers I had before.</li>
    <li> works the way its suposed to do</li>
    <li> Too stiff couldn&#x27;t open them!</li>
    <li> well made and nice to use.  precision functionality makes and excellent extension in jobs that require extra manual dexterity.  recommend</li>
    <li> Exactly what I wanted, high quality instrument.  Would give highest rating except that only one of two ordered arrived</li>
    <li> So far works good, ok for the price</li>
    <li> I bought these because I prefer this style of tweezer for the grip. The reviews were great. I got two in one pack, which was also exciting. However, the tweezers have deep ridges in the tips, which I think is supposed to be for grip. They did not work as intended. Instead any hair I gripped either slipped right through the grooves, or the grooves effectively cut the hair before I could pull it out. The hinges were also very tight and were difficult to open/close. Definitely do not recommend!</li>
    <li> The front edge is to thick to grasp short hairs. I would not recommend buying these tweezers.</li>
    <li> didn&#x27;t work properly... hard to open and close and the edges don&#x27;t line up.</li>
    <li> Works well (and inexpensive), but the rivet holding the pieces together loosens over time - making the tips go out of alignment.</li>
    <li> They were not pointed enough.  Unable to use them as my previous ones that I lost.</li>
    <li> This needs to be in every makeup box/case/purse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I actually bought 3 or 4 sets because my (2) sisters were constantly stealing mine! They work better because of the handle.&lt;br /&gt;I refuse to use regular tweezers!</li>
    <li> I have a similar tweezer, thought I couldn&#x27;t find a better one but I did. The satin edge is better than what I have. Tip is fine and it&#x27;s study. Very great product.</li>
    <li> I have tried several pairs of tweezers, most of them do not perform to my liking, and these are not much better than average.  They just don&#x27;t grip hair ends effectively enough to warrant a better rating.  They are not terrible, especially for the price, so if all you want is a well priced slightly above average quality pair of tweezers, they&#x27;ll do.</li>
    <li> Inexpensive.. and feel like it.. would spend a bit more and get a better one.. bout said all that needed to be said..</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok, good for the price. I find that it doesn&#x27;t work too well for very fine hairs, but gets the job done for most.</li>
    <li> These work very well and they grab onto whatever small object you want them to w/minimal effort. Great for eyebrows.</li>
    <li> OK but no better than any other.  They all have a problems meeting in the middle.  I guess they were alright for the minimal price I paid for them.</li>
    <li> I had never seen tweezers with tips like this and thought I would give them a try.  While I do not like them as well as the Revlong slanted tweezers, they are pretty nice.  The price is good, they are well made, and will grab larger hairs very easily.</li>
    <li> Love these tweezers! A family member had some, but I could not find them in stores.</li>
    <li> Great pluckers for a good price</li>
    <li> The corners of the pinching end could be more round, and these tweezers do not feel very durable because the fulcrum has seemed to get just a little loose in just a short period of time.  I guess I expected them to be a little better for the price, but they are not bad overall, and while I suspect not very durable, probably somewhat durable.</li>
    <li> The tweezers are as described, but did not work out best for my intended use. Will hold on to them because another use is bound to come up one day.</li>
    <li> It is just OK. My old one (that is more than 30 years old!) does a slightly better job. Next time I&#x27;ll invest in a better quality product.</li>
    <li> These are easy to use and the scissor effect helps with arthritic hands. I have used these for years and keep a pair in my purse.</li>
    <li> Not a fan of the angle or design. Went back to standard tweezers.</li>
    <li> Tweezer is good quality and grasps finer hair without cutting it off or breaking it.  This is a good grooming aid.</li>
    <li> Good enough for the money. Walgreens is no better</li>
    <li> Great! Works! What else can I say! OK I will add it is better that tweezers that pinch with your thumb and index finger, that don&#x27;t have loops for your fingers, as this one does!  Very accurate, as the ends of this Tweezer meet perfectly, whereas the other kind sometimes don&#x27;t meet as well, especially after time.</li>
    <li> worst tweezers ever!!!</li>
    <li> These are excellent tweezers!&lt;br /&gt;They have perfect tips for doing your eyebrows.&lt;br /&gt;The blunt tip is much better than slanted tip type.</li>
    <li> They work well unlike some other brands I have used Thanks</li>
    <li> Very poor one! Does not work and it is just wasting your money. Perhaps the worst I have ever seen.</li>
    <li> Was too small for my thumb and finger, so I opened it up more and it now works much better,  but the opening I created catches the edge of my finger or thumb sometimes.</li>
    <li> Horrible, can&#x27;t grab hairs</li>
    <li> I prefer this style of tweezers for ear/nose grooming, actually, it&#x27;s the only type I&#x27;m able to use easily. These are totally adequate and very good quality for the $...</li>
    <li> I had a pair of scissor style tweezers that I&#x27;ve had forever and somehow lost after a couple of moves and the fact that I didn&#x27;t need them anymore. Out of all of the different brands on amazon, the ones I had looked most like these so I chose to put my review here (though if I were to buy a new pair, which I might, I would seriously consider the Tweezerman ones, because I adore my pointy and slanted tip Tweezerman tweezers and my Tweezerman Hair Cutting Scissors plus the lifetime sharpening guarantee makes them worth the higher price). Anyway, I rarely used these on my eyebrows (except for the two pesky hairs that grow between my eyebrows - they&#x27;re PERFECT for that, so if you&#x27;re looking to tweeze a heavy unibrow than this is the style you want) ... I mainly used them to pluck facial hair between waxing appointments ... I could sit there and not even look in a mirror and just pluck away at those awful hairs on my chinny chin chin. Since then I&#x27;ve had laser hair removal so I haven&#x27;t had much use for these lately (hence how they somehow got lost, when they used to be my most important beauty tool). They were also great for plucking any other stray body hairs (those weird hairs that pop up around nipples, for example) ... There&#x27;s just something about the extra strength and maneuverability that the handles give you that make these perfect for pulling out awkwardly placed hairs, a bunch of hair at once (if you were really patient you could tweeze your legs with these because you can easily grab a bunch of hairs all at once - between 5-10+ depending on the thickness and fullness of the hair). They ALSO work really well for plucking someone else&#x27;s eyebrows - since it can be kind of hard to get the right angle and these give you a much much stronger grip. I&#x27;ve had normal tweezers kind of jump out if my hand because I missed or was in an odd position. If you&#x27;re hairy and don&#x27;t want to be, you need these ... And if you have trouble using regular tweezers in any area of your body (including eyebrows) give these a try - they&#x27;re really special and for years and years I treasured them with my life. It&#x27;s strange, I NEVER see these around, except maybe a few times at the beauty supply store, but never at the drugstore or anything and they are such invaluable tools. I really think more people need to be exposed to them. I&#x27;m giving these particular tweezers 4 stars because I&#x27;m not sure if they are the brand that I had so I can&#x27;t comment on their specific quality ... But I can&#x27;t say enough about the style, if I could review just that I&#x27;d give it 10 stars out of 5!!dy (including eyebrows) give these a try - they&#x27;re really special and for years and years I treasured them with my life.
