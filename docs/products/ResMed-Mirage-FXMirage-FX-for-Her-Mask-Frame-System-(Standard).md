      <li>Great value!</li>

      <li>cocker thinks they are great chew toys.</li>
      <li>but it worked great and delivery</li>
      <li>Great seller.  </li>
      <li>I was hesitant about ordering my cpap supplies online, I didn&#x27;t know if the quality would be good or if they would be damaged or irregulars.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m so glad I threw caution to the wind and ordered this!</li>
      <li>Top notch products and amazing customer service!</li>
      <li>The first two nights weren&#x27;t great with a lot of air leakage.  </li>
      <li>very light, works well for me.</li>
      <li>Very comfortable and doesn&#x27;t leak.  </li>
      <li>Once I tightened the headgear more</li>
      <li>Once again  I do love this CPAP.</li>
      <li>I love this mask.</li>
      <li>I LOVE this mask</li>
      <li>I love this mask.  </li>
      <li>I have since ordered more supplies from this same vendor and I&#x27;ve been very happy.</li>
      <li>Exactly what we needed, great price quick delivery!  </li>
      <li>Generally it has a very good seal also</li>
      <li>you are considering this mask, it&#x27;s definitely worth a try!!</li>
      <li>The best mask I&#x27;ve had -- I like this and the wide.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s light weight and easy to put on.</li>
      <li>However, if you do then this mask is quite comfortable.  </li>
      <li>And honestly, it is so comfortable that I forget I have it on.</li>
      <li>but I was noticing it seemed to be pressing closer to my face and making a crinkling sound if I adjusted it at all...</li>
      <li>It is easy to clean and use</li>
      <li>FAST SHIPPER!!!</li>
      <li>/&gt;It feels very light on the face, too, and I can see pretty well around the frame which is nice!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This is a nice small mask that works well, happy with the mask and how quickly it was received and the price.</li>
      <li>If I had to wear a full face mask, I wouldn&#x27;t be compliant.  </li>
      <li>As described, quick shipping</li>
      <li>I am OK with paying $30 every 5 months for a new nose part of the mask...</li>
      <li>Right size, right fit, right price&lt;br</li>
      <li>Even if I am asleep I rarely have any leaks that show on my machine in the morning...</li>
      <li>but it gets sweaty during the night, this one is just the right size</li>
      <li>This particular mask is so comfortable.  </li>
      <li>If you have a small nose and face this mask fits great.  </li>
      <li>Very fast delivery.</li>
      <li>so ideal for replacing a broken mask when you still have viable headgear.  </li>
      <li>first Mirage mask lasted exactly 5 months--I could probably use it longer</li>
      <li>My next attempt will be the safe.</li>
      <li>this is the first that really fits.</li>
      <li>These are so comfortable, so less noisey than many others and &amp;#34;for her&amp;#34; is true, fits a female face a little more securely.</li>
      <li>really like the Resmed nasal pillows also,</li>
      <li>I am VERY thankful for this mask!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I really thought I had ended the problem.</li>
      <li>You get the whole mask fixture -- no hose, no headgear</li>
      <li>, These are nice masks -- have used for a few years and if I&#x27;ve had to change to anything else I miss it.</li>
      <li>so I tried a new one (Activa) that I had on hand last night and noticed a significant difference.  </li>
      <li>big problem, though, is that I can tell my top front teeth are being pushed back a bit and my bite is changing.  </li>
      <li>The new design eliminates the pressure points on your forhead.  </li>
      <li>buy the women&#x27;s model, exactly the same as men&#x27;s but cheaper..........</li>
      <li>Exact same item as you will get from the manufacturer</li>
      <li>I find I can adjust the mask to be VERY loose, and after the first few minutes, it seems to sort of cling to my face most of the time.  </li>
      <li>but I just find that it takes enough space in my nostrils that I end up breathing too fast when wearing</li>
      <li>I ordered the standard size and wonder if the small wouldn&#x27;t have been better.</li>
      <li>I tried all of the Resmed nasal masks and they all felt EXTREMELY heavy and clunky on my face!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, with the Mirage FX I can even wear my glasses--which is nice because since I can&#x27;t lie down at all without the mask, I can wear my glasses to watch TV when in bed, or read a book, etc.  </li>
      <li>No pinching or loud noise or air finding its way out of the mask when it is adjusted properly.</li>
      <li>I very seldom roll over at night due to another problem.</li>
      <li>However, I used the first one, on an average, 9 hours a day/night, every night, for 5 months, so it got a lot of use!  </li>

<li> Well, obviously I was wrong.</li>
<li> I have ordered four in the past year or so.</li>
<li> but again, any other nasal mask would probably be worse because they are heavier by far!&lt;br</li>
<li> since I feel like I&#x27;m suffocating whenever I lie down (until I put on the CPAP mask)</li>
<li> Very expensive chew toys.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> If you have a small nose and face this mask fits great.  I have gone though 5 masks and this is the first that really fits.</li>
    <li> very light, works well for me.</li>
    <li> Gave myself a week to get used to this mask as it is different from the one I had before.  The first two nights weren&#x27;t great with a lot of air leakage.  Once I tightened the headgear more it helped a lot and now I am sleeping well (into my second week).  I ordered the standard size and wonder if the small wouldn&#x27;t have been better.</li>
    <li> Needed this before I got insurance. You get the whole mask fixture -- no hose, no headgear but you get the rest of it -- so ideal for replacing a broken mask when you still have viable headgear.  Exact same item as you will get from the manufacturer, These are nice masks -- have used for a few years and if I&#x27;ve had to change to anything else I miss it. These are so comfortable, so less noisey than many others and &amp;#34;for her&amp;#34; is true, fits a female face a little more securely. The best mask I&#x27;ve had -- I like this and the wide.</li>
    <li> Works perfectly!  No co,plaints!  Great value!</li>
    <li> was a little concerned that product might not work on my machine but it worked great and delivery was earlier then expected.  I will be looking here again as I need to replace accessories</li>
    <li> As described, quick shipping</li>
    <li> This nasal mask is awesome!  If I had to wear a full face mask, I wouldn&#x27;t be compliant.  This particular mask is so comfortable.  Great seller.  Definitely will purchase from them in the future.  Very fast delivery.</li>
    <li> Honestly, it&#x27;s not enjoyable to have to wear something on your face at night.  However, if you do then this mask is quite comfortable.  The new design eliminates the pressure points on your forhead.  I recommend this one.</li>
    <li> I love this mask. It&#x27;s light weight and easy to put on. I have ordered four in the past year or so. Not because I wanted to&lt;br /&gt;My cocker thinks they are great chew toys. Very expensive chew toys. I have tried different ways to keep him from getting them. I really thought I had ended the problem. Well, obviously I was wrong. My next attempt will be the safe. I don&#x27;t think he could handle&lt;br /&gt;the key. But then again I didn&#x27;t think he could open a drawer and take it out.either&lt;br /&gt;  Once again  I do love this CPAP. mask. I very seldom roll over at night due to another problem. When I do, the mask goes along for the ride. No pinching or loud noise or air finding its way out of the mask when it is adjusted properly.</li>
    <li> Right size, right fit, right price&lt;br /&gt;  Will buy this again when needed.</li>
    <li> buy the women&#x27;s model, exactly the same as men&#x27;s but cheaper..........</li>
    <li> Exactly what we needed, great price quick delivery!  Thank you!</li>
    <li> Fits, face perfectly.  there is a wide version of this mask but it gets sweaty during the night, this one is just the right size</li>
    <li> I LOVE this mask (well, it&#x27;s a LOVE/HATE relationship as I would prefer NOT to have to use a CPAP machine, but since I feel like I&#x27;m suffocating whenever I lie down (until I put on the CPAP mask) I am VERY thankful for this mask!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like the Resmed nasal pillows also, but I just find that it takes enough space in my nostrils that I end up breathing too fast when wearing it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enter the Resmed Mirage FX....I tried all of the Resmed nasal masks and they all felt EXTREMELY heavy and clunky on my face!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, with the Mirage FX I can even wear my glasses--which is nice because since I can&#x27;t lie down at all without the mask, I can wear my glasses to watch TV when in bed, or read a book, etc.  I find I can adjust the mask to be VERY loose, and after the first few minutes, it seems to sort of cling to my face most of the time.  Generally it has a very good seal also--occasionally I will feel/hear a small wisp of air coming out one side or the other, and usually if I just press a little on that side the mask seems to seal again.  Even if I am asleep I rarely have any leaks that show on my machine in the morning...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It feels very light on the face, too, and I can see pretty well around the frame which is nice!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My big problem, though, is that I can tell my top front teeth are being pushed back a bit and my bite is changing.  I think that just about any nasal mask would do this, so I&#x27;m going to have to find out what my options are...but again, any other nasal mask would probably be worse because they are heavier by far!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My first Mirage mask lasted exactly 5 months--I could probably use it longer but I was noticing it seemed to be pressing closer to my face and making a crinkling sound if I adjusted it at all...so I tried a new one (Activa) that I had on hand last night and noticed a significant difference.

    <li> I use this mask with my sleep apnea machine.  Very comfortable and doesn&#x27;t leak.  It is easy to clean and use</li>
    <li> I love this mask.  It fits well, no leaks, very quiet.  And honestly, it is so comfortable that I forget I have it on.</li>
    <li> This is a nice small mask that works well, happy with the mask and how quickly it was received and the price.</li>
    <li> I was hesitant about ordering my cpap supplies online, I didn&#x27;t know if the quality would be good or if they would be damaged or irregulars. I&#x27;m so glad I threw caution to the wind and ordered this! I have since ordered more supplies from this same vendor and I&#x27;ve been very happy. Top notch products and amazing customer service!</li>
    <li> FAST SHIPPER!!! A++++</li>
