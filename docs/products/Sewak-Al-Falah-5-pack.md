      <li>You use the oil kind of like mouth wash, but you pull the oil through your teeth, don&#x27;t gargle, then you spit it out into the drain, then rinse your mouth out with water.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s been a really nice change</li>
      <li>so this made things simpler and it was effective.  </li>
      <li>The good news is that if you take out one stick to use, and let it air out for a couple of days, most of the smell goes away.</li>

      <li>The kids love it.</li>
      <li>i need to stock up more as i gave some to my family to try out :)</li>
      <li>I used a Sonicare before this, and it does a better job.</li>
      <li>Had read that these could work even better than flossing so decided to give it a try.</li>
      <li>I think there are just to many chemicals in our food to use these.</li>
      <li>love them all&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m rating 4 stars because I&#x27;m sure it does everything it claims, but this product is not for me.</li>
      <li>I feel my teeth more cleaner than ever</li>
      <li>I must say, after watching some YouTube videos about how to correctly use it, I&#x27;m in love with the product.</li>
      <li>But this is the next best thing.</li>
      <li>love being able to keep a stick on hand.  </li>
      <li>product I love Sewak.</li>
      <li>I love how clean my teeth feel!</li>
      <li>ITs easy compact travel size and my kids love it.</li>
      <li>Though I am strongly considering using one to try and configure a more &amp;#34;toothbrush&amp;#34; like shape out of the stick.  </li>
      <li>your teeth will be whiter and smoother, great natural way to brush your teeth with no poisonous fluoride!</li>
      <li>(maybe they could use a more organic packaging instead of using plastic) and it was very fresh</li>
      <li>I love the way these clean the teeth.</li>
      <li>My husband has even taken one to try and now carries it in his lunchbag so that he can brush his teeth easily after work.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;shipping was also very quick.</li>
      <li>These clean WAY better and leave your teeth feeling polished and looking glossy.</li>
      <li>This is an interesting item that I read a lot of good things about on a natural health blog.</li>
      <li>I received them very quickly as well.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you</li>
      <li>Then again, they&#x27;re not allowed candy, so a piece of strongly flavored bark is all they get that satisfies their urge to chew.</li>
      <li>3 were a good size to get everywhere in my mouth, but 2 were kind of big.</li>
      <li>In fact, I&#x27;m actually consideringnot flossing because when I do now, there&#x27;s nothing there, which is pretty awesome in my book.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I made holes in the holder and things have been fine ever since.</li>
      <li>feel it on my tongue, so I wasn&#x27;t sure what exactly possessed me to order these!</li>
      <li>Handy and healthy natural tooth cleaner.</li>
      <li>Maybe there are some people who wouldn&#x27;t enjoy it</li>
      <li>At first I loved these so much</li>
      <li>I have known the taste and flavor of original Sewak sticks from India and MiddleEast.</li>
      <li>I wasn&#x27;t sure at first if I could make the transition.</li>
      <li>I would feel more comfortable if I knew what exactly had the possibility of being in the stick and would certainly pay more for something guaranteed and proven organic if necessary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It tastes very fresh and &amp;#34;planty&amp;#34; but it&#x27;s not bad.</li>
      <li>My teeth feel so clean.</li>
      <li>I have been looking for a way to clean my teeth between meals and when&amp;#34;out and about&amp;#34;, which doesn&#x27;t require rinsing and spitting.</li>
      <li>Although they take some getting used to, they clean my teeth like nothing else I&#x27;ve found... including my $100 electric toothbrush.</li>
      <li>My mouth has a pleasant absence of flavor now that I use these.</li>
      <li>These are great at keeping teeth clean, and breath fresh.&lt;br /&gt;Arrived quickly, and so far, they seem to be very fresh.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I even used a special prescription toothpaste.  </li>
      <li>I liked it, I always prefer natural products I don&#x27;t use toothpaste I don&#x27;t like the fluoride</li>
      <li>but you can use any kind of natural oil of your choosing.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a good addition to regular brushing.</li>
      <li>I stop using toothpaste with all of those chemicals in it, such as fluoride, Jason&#x27;s toothpaste has a good one that doesn&#x27;t use any chemicals.</li>
      <li>Not bad.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This is my first time using this product, and I was shocked by the results. I&#x27;ve only been using it for about a couple of days now and I am amazed. When you first get the product it vacuumed sealed, the stick was still moist and not dry. I can&#x27;t tell you how much tooth paste I&#x27;ve tried and my breath was still not getting fresh. I stop using toothpaste with all of those chemicals in it, such as fluoride, Jason&#x27;s toothpaste has a good one that doesn&#x27;t use any chemicals. I use it only once in the morning, but before that I did something called oil pulling. Oil pulling is when you wash your mouth with oil, I use coconut oil but you can use any kind of natural oil of your choosing. You use the oil kind of like mouth wash, but you pull the oil through your teeth, don&#x27;t gargle, then you spit it out into the drain, then rinse your mouth out with water. Now my breath is fresher than it has ever been, I&#x27;m going to keep this up for a few months and see how my gums are improving, but so far I&#x27;m not having any pain. This product is awesome and I would recommend, also the shipping was pretty fast, got my product in a couple of days I was very happy. THANK YOU!</li>
    <li> Gotta get this for ramadan lol.  Its pretty good overall.  Does have a scent to it but its nothing to stress about.</li>
    <li> i ordered it recently and very disappointed to see that all the sticks were extremely thick and unusable.</li>
    <li> I use this to polish my teeth after brushing and flossing.  It is very natural and, earth friendly.  Nothing to harm you or the environment after you are done with it.  To top it all off, it gives your teeth that smooth feeling you commonly get after a cleaning session with the dentist (minus the chemicals).  Get over it&#x27;s initial taste/smell (from the natural oils of the tree....besides, it&#x27;s not that bad), and you&#x27;re good to go.  This type of products just make perfect sense.  The only thing I don&#x27;t like is that the packaging is plastic, but that is necessary to seal the oils and moisture.</li>
    <li> If you have never smelled a miswak stick, its definitely an acquired &amp;#34;taste&amp;#34;. They have a very strange mushroom-y, almost chemically like smell that some people might not like. The good news is that if you take out one stick to use, and let it air out for a couple of days, most of the smell goes away. I also &amp;#34;cleaned&amp;#34; my stick off with water and vinegar before using it the first time. It was much easier to peel and prepare the bristles than I thought it would be. The outer bark comes right off. I love the way these clean the teeth. Once you get used to a different routine, it is such a nice change of pace from conventional toothbrush and toothpaste. I have been recommending them to all my friends. I also enhance the experience by using a special oral cleaning essential oil blend. I just add two drops onto the stick and then brush.</li>
    <li> I have to refrain from chewing this stick to a nub. I hope to make converts of my family, but we&#x27;re American, and if it&#x27;s done the American way, it&#x27;s unfortunately tough to make a change.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s easy to use and convenient to carry, I like how it makes my mouth feel cleaner and fresher, great for tongue brushing. The stick does smell a little musty but it&#x27;s a root so that is expected. It has a slight taste but it&#x27;s pleasant. I noticed when I use it, my mouth makes more saliva which is a good thing. Only problem is, since it&#x27;s not angled like a toothbrush it&#x27;s hard to reach some places. It&#x27;s a good addition to regular brushing. Would be great for hiking and camping too. I bought 5 for $6 which I believe is a great deal.</li>
    <li> I plan to order the 60 pack for $50 which should last my family a very long time.  I&#x27;ve experimented with using one for a whole month without using any other form of washing my teeth.  My teeth are whiter and they feel fresh and clean.  Of course, I brush with the stick right after eating anything.  I intend to continue using the same stick for another 5 months.  We&#x27;ll see how long they last.  If you&#x27;re interested, reply to this comment and I&#x27;ll reply back with the status.</li>
    <li> I really don&#x27;t understand people who think the flavor is so heinous. It&#x27;s a little strange, but nothing that&#x27;s going to make you gag. I also wouldn&#x27;t say that it tastes are smells like synthetic chemicals. These come pretty fresh sealed inside the packages and are at first really easy to peel and loosen the fibers. Once it dries out, you will need to employ the water-soaking method, which makes it simple enough. Just make sure it soaks for at least an hour for very easy handling. I&#x27;ve been using the same stick for months. It usually takes about a week or two for the end to get ratty enough to cut and start over again. I wouldn&#x27;t say this stick eliminates flossing. It depends on the way your teeth are situated. I have some problem spots that I absolutely need to use floss for. That being said, I&#x27;ve noticed a significant reduction of plaque that is removed with a floss after brushing with a miswak (vs. after brushing with a good conventional toothbrush or even a sonicare toothbrush). In my personal experience, a miswak works better than a Sonicare. However, if you like the convenience of the Sonicare, stick to that. It depends on each person&#x27;s habits and personality. You can damage your enamel with a Sonicare, so please be careful and follow the instructions carefully. You really don&#x27;t have a problem with hurting gums or the enamel with a miswak. It is also the perfect travel toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: Lasts a long time, is completely natural, no need for toothpaste, minimal flossing, travels easily, gentle on teeth and gums while getting into nooks and crannies better than a traditional western brush, dental study shows improvement of gingivitis with regular use of miswak.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Awkward handling for back of teeth, must peel to get a new layer, some people don&#x27;t like the taste, not easy for children to use.</li>
    <li> The best way I can describe the flavor is apple cinnamon. You don&#x27;t NEED toothpaste but can use it.</li>
    <li> These are really awesome and don&#x27;t taste bad at all. The taste, in my opinion, is exactly that of a nasturtium flower and only last for the first few brushings. My teeth feel stronger to cold and sweet foods (less sensitivity) and it keeps my breath fresher. Also, I have noticed that my husbands &amp;#34;morning breath&amp;#34; is gone.</li>
    <li> it exactly what I was looking for, in the same time I consider it a little expensive.</li>
    <li> Ok, so silly me--even after reading all of the reviews, I still didn&#x27;t realize how much this would be like chewing on a stick!  I&#x27;m one of those people that can&#x27;t even stand to touch a wooden popsicle stick let alone feel it on my tongue, so I wasn&#x27;t sure what exactly possessed me to order these! So, keep in mind if you are like me and hate the taste/feel of wood--think twice about purchasing--it&#x27;s basically a tree branch.  I ordered because I&#x27;m always looking for healthy alternatives without fluoride and other chemicals. I&#x27;m rating 4 stars because I&#x27;m sure it does everything it claims, but this product is not for me. I&#x27;ll be gifting them to family and friends who don&#x27;t have wood phobia!  They were packaged individually and sealed well.  During the slight moment I had one in my mouth I did not notice any unpleasant taste or odor. They appear fresh.</li>
    <li> I wanted to like this. I&#x27;d used the miswak toothpaste before and it was the best tasting toothpaste I&#x27;ve ever tried. These, unfortunately, taste very different. I opened the package and it smelled foul. I forged ahead, gnawing the bark off, even more disgusting. My last hope was that the inside part of the stick would for some reason be bearable. So I&#x27;m sitting in the kitchen trying to keep the gagging to a minimum, eyes watering, mouth drooling (the stick makes you salivate a lot), while my roommate stared at me very concerned. After flossing the pieces of wood lodged in my teeth out, my mouth felt a little cleaner and tasted like hell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Probably will not be buying this product again...</li>
    <li> This is a great purchase. good quality miswak. One of the best Miswaks I ever used. The only reason I gave it four stars is because of the packaging. It is not resealable. If it was, then the rate should not be less than five stars.&lt;br /&gt;Regarding the smell. this is the normal smell of the Arak tree. some people may think it is bad. personally, I think it is normal and natural. it does not bother me or my wife at all.</li>
    <li> At first I loved these so much I threw out my old nylon toothbrush to use them exclusively. However they do seem to have been sprayed in something.. I can see small crystals on some of them, and they are wet and smelly when first taken out of the packaging. It actually irritates the corners of my mouth if I try to use it straight out of the packaging, so perhaps let it dry out before use or wash it. I do not like not knowing what is sprayed on them.&lt;br /&gt;Also a few of the sticks I was sent are MUCH too wide for my mouth; and even with the slender ones it can be difficult to really clean around my farthest molars and on the inside of the teeth. My teeth did seem to get whiter &amp; enamel healthier with extremely frequent use (basically using it all day, morning before bed and after I ate anything, and I eat a lot) but it eventually became too much of a hassle. &amp; Now that I am pregnant I had to switch back to a regular toothbrush + toothpowder because these just weren&#x27;t cutting it anymore. Still like tooth cleaning sticks, but will try another brand / type next time.They will be nice to use as baby toothbrushes, and are great for carrying around in your purse and light cleanings after eating.</li>
    <li> I purchased a multipack of the miswak sticks unfortunately they smell very bad. I did some research and it turns out the smell is pretty common. The have a harsh chemical smell naturally. I follow recommendations in regards to soaking the stick, but the smell never went away. I was very disappointed because I read sooooo many good benefits of the using the miswak stick but the smell is sooooooooooooooooo horrible I cannot bring my self to use it.</li>
    <li> Tastes horrible, but you get used to it. The kids love it. Then again, they&#x27;re not allowed candy, so a piece of strongly flavored bark is all they get that satisfies their urge to chew. Fun for the whole family!</li>
    <li> The product came vacuum sealed.  It was moist, flexible and with no white residue as some of the expired products have.  It does have a distinct taste that may take some getting use to (  like dirty mushrooms with a hint of rubber  ). However, this is strictly a health product.  I put a little rose water on it and brush well.</li>
    <li> I received my miswak sticks just on time as expected, they were all there, and sealed 100%. no damage, nothing! I haven&#x27;t bought any other items from this seller, but if they are all delivered with this care, then I would suggest to anyone! Literally the ONLY bad thing I can say is that the miswak sticks smell funky. But that&#x27;s not the seller&#x27;s fault, it&#x27;s just how they are.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know what made me buy this but somehow I came across it and was curious to try one. I just finished my first stick which lasted over a week. Every day I would chop off the ~1cm part I used. It probably lasted about 10 days. You might be able to use the same part multiple times, I just didn&#x27;t want to. I actually noticed it somehow whitened my teeth. The taste isnt good but I got used to it after 2 days. I still used a normal toothbrush as well, but I was curious to try this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t replace my normal electric toothbrush/toothpaste/flossing for just this, but I use this along with the rest.&lt;br /&gt;I might buy another 5 pack when this one is gone, but 4 more should last me a few months.</li>
    <li> I read the reviews and decided to try this. I’m not sure how to store it so it doesn’t dry out or get moldy.</li>
    <li> It works as advertised. I think though that the sewak can be copied in the form of a toothbrush, you can by a small one to go, just to brush with no toothpaste in the same manner. So I know that a toothbrush will be my future use but a smaller one for the go to clean the through the day plaque build up.</li>
    <li> Works Great! your teeth will be whiter and smoother, great natural way to brush your teeth with no poisonous fluoride!</li>
    <li> Holy crap if you can get past the scent of this then kudos, but for me it&#x27;s not worth it at all. I&#x27;d rather just use a regular toothbrush. It was interesting to try out though I will never buy these again because I can&#x27;t get past the smell. It smells very pungent..slightly sour and almost dirt like</li>
    <li> I have been looking for a way to clean my teeth between meals and when&amp;#34;out and about&amp;#34;, which doesn&#x27;t require rinsing and spitting. There are some excellent studies on the use of Miswak, which demonstrate greater efficacy than even toothbrush and paste. Miswak contains natural fluoride and antibacterial properties, too.&lt;br /&gt;I just received my sticks and tried them for the first time. I love it! They do have an earthy, herbal smell and taste, which isn&#x27;t bad--just unfamiliar. I imagine if you&#x27;re squeamish about the herbal odor, you could eyedropper on a few drops of pure peppermint extract (the pure essential oil probably too intense) on the bristle end.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The stick was moist and fresh, vacuum sealed. I wish I could get these without all the plastic packaging, like in a multi-pack instead of individually wrapped, but perhaps for that I&#x27;ll need to find a local birch or sassafras to cut chewing sticks from.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like these so far. I may try using them in combination with a calcium tooth powder. I&#x27;ll update if there&#x27;s anything to add with a few months use.</li>
    <li> Served my needs. I hate bringing a toothbrush and paste with me to work/class to use after lunch etc so this made things simpler and it was effective.  I bought 5 separate ones and some come thin, some wide - no standard size. This is a good thing if you&#x27;re buying it for various people but if for yourself, buy a few and choose the one that &amp;#34;fits&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> These are wonderful. Although they take some getting used to, they clean my teeth like nothing else I&#x27;ve found... including my $100 electric toothbrush. I will be using miswak sticks for oral hygiene from now on.</li>
    <li> I first saw these on the streets in Yemen when I visited, but never bought one. I was feeling nostalgic, so I ordered these. It tastes very fresh and &amp;#34;planty&amp;#34; but it&#x27;s not bad. It feels really good on my teeth and gums. I&#x27;m happy with my purchase.&lt;br /&gt;shipping was also very quick.</li>
    <li> I chose this rating because it was a bit expensive with shipping although the product was well packaged (maybe they could use a more organic packaging instead of using plastic) and it was very fresh, I got 5 well sized sticks, exactly what I was expecting. This supplier was excellent and would recommend them to anyone looking to try an alternative oral care product.</li>
    <li> Super spicy or something...burnt my lips</li>
    <li> Taste isn&#x27;t good, but works wonders for your teeth. I would suggest doing this along with regular brushing, though.</li>
    <li> I received my package of 5 sticks quite swiftly.  From other reviews I thought it would take awhile, but I had them less than a week after ordering them.  I had never heard of these Sewak&#x27;s or Miswak sticks until doing some research on alternative dental care.  After some reading, watching a few videos, and even reading the NHO&#x27;s stance on the sticks I decided it was worth trying.  I have autoimmune issues and my body often responds oddly to processed foods and products in general. Everything from obvious allergic reactions, to not so obvious reactions.  Upon discovering the difference made when cutting out 99% of processed items and chemicals, and having such bad results with traditional western dental care even though I do exactly what I&#x27;m supposed to and in fact  likely brush my teeth far more than most people do each day because my enamel is just disappearing far worse than should be, I decided to give this a try.  What could it hurt, after all?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will say, that were it not for one thing, I would give these 5 stars because I really do like them a lot.  I&#x27;ve been using them for about two weeks now, and am still on the same stick.  I use it in the morning after I do an oil pull, at night before bed, and after I eat anything, or after drinking something other than water, like tea or a smoothie.  For those unfamiliar and wondering, yes it&#x27;s an actual stick.  It&#x27;s extremely clean, no dirt or anything on it, very neatly cut, and has an earthy scent.  If you garden you&#x27;ll realize that the smell isn&#x27;t mold as some have suggested.  In terms that most Americans would be familiar with, I&#x27;d describe the scent as a combination of something starchy, with a strong undertone of earthiness/soil, and just a tiny herbaceous hint.  By no means does it taste that way, however.  It was a little strange at first, because it wasn&#x27;t what I&#x27;m used to.  After all, most toothpastes here not only are minty or cinnamony, but they&#x27;re also very sweet.  This is none of that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I followed the instructions I had read on the internet, though I used a razor blade to remove the thin layer of bark on the half inch of stick I revealed because my weak teeth would have been incapable of doing so without pain.  I then soaked the tip in some rose water, for I had read that is often done, because when I tried to chew to soften the bristles before doing this, it was quite difficult for me to do.  I don&#x27;t think everyone would have this problem though.  There is a flavor at first. I really can&#x27;t describe it. It&#x27;s slightly medicinal I guess, but nothing too terribly strong.  Just what you might expect from a natural remedy, I suppose.  It tingled a bit the first time, but that disappeared and the flavor faded after a few uses as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Though the bristles are a bit stiff the first time or two if you haven&#x27;t really given it a good chew, they loosen up swiftly and by no means are harsh on your gums.  I would recommend having a paper towel or washcloth on hand after  each new cut because some of the fibers will break off in your mouth.  I think this comes from the bark cutting/ chewing exercise and not the actual brushing because it ceases to be an issue after the first time or two.  The fibers do an amazing job at cleaning my teeth.  I&#x27;ve used one of the expensive Sonicare brushes for years now and this stick easily gets my teeth as clean as the Sonicare brush does.  Not only that, but in my opinion they stay clean longer and better.  It&#x27;s really quite strange.  I&#x27;m missing the &amp;#34;fresh brushed&amp;#34; feeling because there&#x27;s no minty crispness going on, but my teeth are just so darn clean. Not only that, but the shape of my teeth made flossing a necessity especially in the back teeth.  Eating chia seeds, hemp, flax, and various other seeds etc was always an issue for me and showed such on the floss.  They would get stuck between a few specific teeth and my Sonicare wouldn&#x27;t remove them.  This however does!!!  In fact, I&#x27;m actually consideringnot flossing because when I do now, there&#x27;s nothing there, which is pretty awesome in my book.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very sensitive teeth.  So sensitive, in fact, that I&#x27;ve kind of hated my Sonicare these years. I even used a special prescription toothpaste.  I&#x27;ve not used that toothpaste these past two weeks, using only the Miswak/Sewak and have found my sensitivity has DECREASED.  I also think there&#x27;s some whitening going on, but can&#x27;t be for certain.  It&#x27;s easy to use, but for someone with tmj it might be uncomfortable at first.  To get to certain angles on my back teeth, I have to open my mouth in such a manner that my jaw is sore afterwards and I do have some tension in my neck from it, but I&#x27;m hoping this will go away once my mouth is accustomed to the repetitive movements.  lol Though I am strongly considering using one to try and configure a more &amp;#34;toothbrush&amp;#34; like shape out of the stick.  If I can figure that out, it&#x27;ll be pretty perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now the thing that has caused me to knock a star.  Though they are marketed as &amp;#34;hygienically processed&amp;#34;  and even on the package it states, &amp;#34;Purchasing the finest available miswak direct from the source &amp; processing under exclusive quality control conditions for retaining the freshness, allows us to deliver the value added product in original natural as well as various refreshing flavours to our world wide potential buyers&amp; valuable users.&amp;#34;, it doesn&#x27;t say that they&#x27;re organic.  I couldn&#x27;t find any labeled as organic on Amazon and that does give me some hesitation.  They don&#x27;t taste of pesticide, but that doesn&#x27;t mean anything.  I haven&#x27;t researched the company, and should have first, I admit, so perhaps there is something on their website.  I personally would like to know that the stick I&#x27;m putting in my mouth was taken from a tree grown in healthy, live soil minus any type of chemical or pesticide.  I would feel more comfortable if I knew what exactly had the possibility of being in the stick and would certainly pay more for something guaranteed and proven organic if necessary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love being able to keep a stick on hand.  My husband has even taken one to try and now carries it in his lunchbag so that he can brush his teeth easily after work.  Oh! I&#x27;ve noticed that it&#x27;s kicked his foul morning breath too, which is a very good thing.  I will be sharing this idea with anyone who I think might be interested.  It&#x27;s been a really nice change and I really do recommend it to anyone looking for an alternative to common Western oral hygiene.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, and I do think it&#x27;s very affordable too.  The stick is going to last quite awhile.  I&#x27;m going to do some research to see how long the sticks remain &amp;#34;moist&amp;#34; once cut so as to make sure I don&#x27;t order too many at a time, but if they don&#x27;t dry out I&#x27;ll be ordering the larger box next time.  I&#x27;m going to look into seeing if the tree can be grown in my area also.  I&#x27;d love to grow my own.  That would be so rewarding.  But this is the next best thing.</li>
    <li> ITs easy compact travel size and my kids love it. My teeth feel so clean. Will definitely be buying these again way better than any tooth brush I ever tried before</li>
    <li> I really thought it was one of the worst smelling things I have ever smelt. Maybe you will like it but I had to throw them away.</li>
    <li> These are wonderful.  I wasn&#x27;t sure at first if I could make the transition. But these really are far superior to standard tooth brush and tooth paste. I used a Sonicare before this, and it does a better job. My mouth has a pleasant absence of flavor now that I use these. They are even string enough to battle my children&#x27;s morning breath! I also really like that there will be no plastic or battery waste (once the Sonicare battery loses its ability to hold a charge it is garbage. You get 3 years tops). I would recommend these to anyone.</li>
    <li> Maybe I&#x27;m doing it wrong but these tasted really bad, like poison bad. Cut the bark off like the directions said and started chewing. Then a super bitter, chemical-y juice oozed out and assaulted my taste buds. I&#x27;ve consumed a lot of questionable things in my days but this just felt dangerous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would have been a 1-star but I don&#x27;t want to look like a jerk if I just couldn&#x27;t figure out how to prepare it properly.</li>
    <li> These miswak arrived fresh and moist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are great for cleaning teeth and gums where floss does not reach.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They have a taste that reminds me of horseradish and tea. It&#x27;s a little unusual, but a nice change from all the mint flavored stuff.</li>
    <li> This cleans my teeth so well it has a new level of shine. has a mild mushroom smell when you first open the package. The bristles to me are like medium bristles. I have also tried licorice sticks, they are like soft bristles</li>
    <li> Not bad. Just expected more from the product</li>
    <li> Shipping was ultra fast and I have no complaints.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are unsure how to use this look up some information online.  Using it properly will make a big difference.</li>
    <li> Awesome natural tooth brushes at a great price, and they come as fresh as off the tree.</li>
    <li> These miswaks came quickly and well packaged. They are individually sealed and the packaging can be used as a convenient carrying case. If you have never used miswak before, the smell and taste of the bark is not a good one at all. That being said, the fibers that actually clean your teeth do not have much taste at all, and over time you get used to the smell. As far as cleaning the teeth, these things work great for those who are not fans of the traditional toothbrush and toothpaste. These are way more convenient overall. I would highly recommend these, but only buy one or a few your first time, just in case you don&#x27;t like them. They are not for everybody.</li>
    <li> been brushing my teeth with these bad boys for almost a year now. they are cleaner than they&#x27;ve ever been with a traditional toothbrush. and i&#x27;m not even muslim! but this is a case where all faiths can agree: cleanliness (of the mouth) is next to godliness.</li>
    <li> When you get these, they smell really weird and have like a white dust on them that looks like mold. These don&#x27;t seem safe at all!</li>
    <li> They have a strangely sour taste.  I was hoping to get rid of my plastic/nylon toothbrush in favor of something more natural, but chewing on this stick might be a little too much for now...I think i&#x27;ll try a neem twig next time...</li>
    <li> Handy and healthy natural tooth cleaner. I keep them in my classroom and use them as a quick way to freshen my teeth after a snack.</li>
    <li> I am not happy with the flavor these sticks possess.  They do not seem natural.</li>
    <li> This is an interesting item that I read a lot of good things about on a natural health blog. I was curious,  and since they were so cheap I purchased them. I must say, after watching some YouTube videos about how to correctly use it, I&#x27;m in love with the product. It leaves teeth feeling really clean and leaves a pleasant taste in the mouth. I think I might get rid of my toothbrush alltogether.  I will say that when I first opened the package I was revolted by the strong smell. However I learned that after a few hours out of the package the strong smell fades and is actually pleasant and earthy. Its sorta like purfume.. when its too concentrated it can be nasty.. but when it fades it smells nice.  I like the convenience of using these and that no toothpaste is needed. Sometimes if I want that toothpaste fresh feeling I just add a few drops of essential oil to the brush. Oral Wellness has a nice mouth blend of essential oils, however I&#x27;ve used tea tree and lavender before and mint oils too. (Therapeutic high grade oil)</li>
    <li> I like cleaning my teeth with these. I carry mine around in a travel toothbrush holder. It got moldy thought because the holder didn&#x27;t have air holes to allow it to air dry. I made holes in the holder and things have been fine ever since.</li>
    <li> LOVE it! i purposely did not brush my teeth before i used it because i wanted to feel the effects it has. those 1 star reviews from ppl not being able to stand the smell (bark) is retarded. you dont put that in your mouth duh! after 3 mins of usage ive noticed my morning breath was gone! its basically odorless leaving my dirty mouth feeling fresher as ever. i need to stock up more as i gave some to my family to try out :)</li>
    <li> I definitely recommended for others who want to use really original / real / genuine pelu.&lt;br /&gt;Excellent product I love Sewak.</li>
    <li> I like brushing my teeth with these, they leave your teeth very smooth and the natural chemical in them kill the bacteria.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From my experience you need to keep it somewhat hydrated, otherwise they&#x27;ll be dry and too stiff to brush, and less of the natural chemical coming out. I rinse them and put them back in the original plastic bag. You have to be careful that they aren&#x27;t too wet and develop mold though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It might have issues getting into some hard to get crevices which regular toothbrush can due to their stiffer and straighter brushes. So to compliment that I do &#x27;oil pulling&#x27; using coconut oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some negatives are the &#x27;wood fiber&#x27; that fell off and sticking your mouth as you brush (although I tend to use stronger strokes). It generate a lot of saliva (which is a good thing in this case), but you need to be next to a sink or have a bowl to spit them out, and it won&#x27;t look pretty. Depending on the person you may or may not like the smell and chemical taste, personally I like it a lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It take more time than regular toothbrush, but it mean you clean your teeth more thoroughly. It&#x27;s definitely more ideal for people who prefer more hand on and spend some time. It&#x27;s not as quick and neat as toothbrush imo, but I still think its healthier considering the usual chemical found in conventional toothpastes. I personally prefer it since I can use it to brush my teeth anywhere in the house.</li>
    <li> I love how clean my teeth feel! It does a wonderful job. I just wish that all 5 had been a little bit smaller. 3 were a good size to get everywhere in my mouth, but 2 were kind of big.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t realize the taste would be o horrid based on the other reviews. Would not recommend if you&#x27;re just looking to try it out and have never tasted it.</li>
    <li> I have never used these before. I just received mine in the mail and opened it up to use it. It works beautifully! I saw one other \\&quot;reviewer\\&quot; give a \\&quot;review\\&quot; in which they never actually used the stick. The moisture is normal and it may have a settle smell, but it does NOT taste like that at all! I could barely taste anything at all. I would recommend this. Cleaned my teeth well and left my breath fresh.</li>
    <li> I liked it, I always prefer natural products I don&#x27;t use toothpaste I don&#x27;t like the fluoride that&#x27;s it good</li>
    <li> Had read that these could work even better than flossing so decided to give it a try. Product seemed damp when I opened the package and smells like moldy pond scum, even after leaving out to dry for a couple of days. I&#x27;m not sure if this is normal or not, but I can&#x27;t bring myself to even try using it with this smell. Maybe I&#x27;m just a coward.</li>
    <li> Very good transaction and excellent product.</li>
    <li> This s*** stinks. I believe I ordered the wrong thing. A lot of people call African licorice sticks Miswak. Miswak is totally different. Used the same, but totally different results. This stuff smells nasty and taste worse. Know what you&#x27;re buying.</li>
    <li> amazing product and the best thing I ever found for brushing teeth.  I had some gums problem and nothing helped rescuing other than these sticks.  I feel my teeth more cleaner than ever and I don&#x27;t feel like I am going to count on tooth paste.  I don&#x27;t feel hot and cold anymore as well. it may look a simple thing but results are beyond imagination</li>
    <li> I have known the taste and flavor of original Sewak sticks from India and MiddleEast. These are real flavored sticks. They might smell musky and mushroomi but they are as they are.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You just need to get into a habit of those and once you peel of the top layer, the stick tastes normal. Thanks to Al-Rasheed.</li>
    <li> did not keep tarter build up. I think there are just to many chemicals in our food to use these.</li>
    <li> Loved them. I gave 4 of the 5 away as I wanted to share in how great they are. I received them very quickly as well.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you</li>
    <li> I am ready to throw away my toothbrush.  These sticks work so much better.  I can get in between my teeth and those hard to reach places in back.  My teeth feel fresh and clean after brushing.</li>
    <li> These miswak brushes are amazing. My husband and I grew up using toothbrushes and toothpaste and had never heard of this until recently. Since day 1 we have not used our toothbrushes once. These clean WAY better and leave your teeth feeling polished and looking glossy. It&#x27;s also much more convenient. I find myself using it at the computer, in the car (just not at a stop light lol), etc. Also, after a while of using just the miswak, you&#x27;ll find yourself not needing to brush as much. Ever left the house and forgot to brush your teeth and it feels totally disgusting? That does not happen when you switch to the miswak. Don&#x27;t know why, but it&#x27;s great!! I&#x27;ve already given them to several family members and everyone thinks they&#x27;re great. The smell/taste isn&#x27;t anything we&#x27;re bothered by... Maybe there are some people who wouldn&#x27;t enjoy it so much?&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, yeah- give this a try! It&#x27;s cheap enough!!</li>
    <li> These are great at keeping teeth clean, and breath fresh.&lt;br /&gt;Arrived quickly, and so far, they seem to be very fresh.&lt;br /&gt;I like the taste, and I actually get sad when the taste begins to diminish.&lt;br /&gt;No wonder these have been in use for centuries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BTW, I have an electric Oral-B which is now an expensive dust collector.</li>
    <li> love them all&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D; god loves you</li>
    <li> Like it. The mouth feels so fresh after using it.</li>
    <li> It was as expected, and arrived surprisingly fast.</li>
</ol>
