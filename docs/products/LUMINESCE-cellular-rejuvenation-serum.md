      <li>It doesn&#x27;t have the same consistency as the real luminesce that I have used previously.</li>

<li> Save your hard earned money, don&#x27;t buy this overpriced temporary fix.  </li>
<li> seriously.</li>
<li> so I can get it instead of this fake stuff</li>
<li> an a lot of people probably don&#x27;t know this stuff is the fake stuff instead of the fake -like me-</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> It is not the real thing</li>
    <li> Be wary of sellers.  If the name is spelled with some letters mixed around, to look like the original, like Jenuesse, or to make it sound like the company itself is selling this you are being tricked.  If someone will try to trick you with a name, they will do the same about a product.  Some have complained about different consistency or color of the product, so buyer beware.  I hate to say it but this stuff is uber expensive, is only temporary and is chalk full of chemicals.  Botox, Xeomin, et al. is cheaper in the long run and lasts a lot longer and overtime helps long standing wrinkles have to relearn where to fold.  Save your hard earned money, don&#x27;t buy this overpriced temporary fix.  Put your big girl pants on and go get a few injections.  You will love it.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t have the same consistency as the real luminesce that I have used previously. Not sure if it is the real deal.</li>
    <li> I buy this stuff from my demartologist (so i know what legit is). If there could be ZERO rating, I would put it. As this stuff is fake and totally different density (like almost water).</li>
    <li> I was very disappointed, did not see any signigicant results.</li>
    <li> What an amazing gel. Within two days with only one application a day, I see my wrinkles disappearing. I love this stuff!</li>
    <li> My wife wanted this and she had no complaints. I don&#x27;t know if she would recommend it or not. That&#x27;s all.</li>
    <li> really love it, after a month, I notice my skin texture begin to improve, dark spots fading, and even some slight cut were cured without leaving any scar when I applied this product. Hope to show some more improvements in the coming months,,,</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t like it leave my face sticky and don&#x27;t very clear. Is there a money back guarantee?</li>
    <li> Love the candles, look so real.</li>
    <li> Good stuff. Help the skin and I also use it to heal other injuries. Love this tone bottle</li>
    <li> Very impressed with the results of this product. Within 1 week my skin felt and looked younger!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t think this is the real luminesce serum like the one that is sold direct.. Possibly a knock off or old.. Not same consistency</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t take away the wrinkle</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a short time. I like how my skin feels and I look forward on replenishing my supplyu when the times come.</li>
    <li> First time user with the usual hesitation to believe the reviews but I&#x27;&#x27;m pleasantly surprised and already planning on ordering more products.  It does work and I&#x27;m thrilled.</li>
    <li> Very expensive product..it last less than 3 months! and I didn&#x27;t see any difference in my skin! very disappointed!</li>
    <li> This is for Robert ttitled (FAKE STUFF) I thought this was the real stuff so what&#x27;s the real stuff called an look like I need to know so I can get it instead of this fake stuff an a lot of people probably don&#x27;t know this stuff is the fake stuff instead of the fake -like me-</li>
    <li> Excellent product, it does what it says</li>
    <li> [...]  Best serum I have ever tried.  I suffered from adult acne about two years ago. Cystic acne to be specific. Was on antibiotics for 7months! and nothing worked.  Finally became \\&quot;vegan\\&quot; just to detox, because if it didn&#x27;t get better Accutane was next!    Long story short, wish I had known about this prior to getting scars, but even now I&#x27;m grateful to have found it today and use it today because my skin is finally Beautiful. a word I thought I would NEVER use to describe my skin.  you can email me if you wish to see evidence in the form of two pictures.  [...]  [...]  [...]  Check it out, you won&#x27;t regret it. seriously.</li>
    <li> It reduce wrinkles around my eye!</li>
    <li> I love this serum, only serum that truly works for me.  It helps brighten, tighten and makes my skin look smooth and flawless.  I also liked the fact that it was cheaper to purchase on Amazon than on retail through a consultant.</li>
    <li> I have a very sensitive skin. This product was very light, absorbed well and didn&#x27;t cause any irritation. I think it works because the lines on my neck seem to be less visible. I just tried it for a month. The sucky part is ends fast. It is half the size of the container. It is very expensive so it is your choice if you want to try it out or not. Your risk.</li>
    <li> I remind you to be cautious. I have bought two bottle of these serum before. One is just fine as before. But when I finished the first one and try to use the second one, I found there was strange, pink, stinky liquid spilled out inside the cap. totally different from the original transparent one. While the paper box outside looks just as a brand new one. Feels really disgusting about this, it&#x27;s like somebody has fill some shampoo liquid inside bottle to make a really bad fake one.&lt;br /&gt;Disappointed!!!</li>
    <li> Nice texture and absorbs well.  Seems to be as advertised.</li>
