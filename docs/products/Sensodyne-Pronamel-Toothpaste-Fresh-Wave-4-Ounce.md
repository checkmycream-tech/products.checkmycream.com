      <li>Loved the price.</li>
      <li>good product.</li>
      <li>and I loved it.  </li>
      <li>Sensodyne does a good job at leaving a layer of protection over your teeth to help with sensitivity.</li>
      <li>Good purchase.</li>
      <li>very satisfied.</li>
      <li>I would recommend this product and it has a nice minty taste.</li>
      <li>I kept buying these until I switched to making my own toothpaste.</li>
      <li>Good flavor and my teeth love it.</li>
      <li>Great product for sensitive teeth at a great price.</li>
      <li>Excellent product for my sensitive gum.</li>
      <li>Great product, tastes great, does not have SLS which I avoid since I suffer with canker sores when I use any toothpaste that has it.&lt;br /&gt;I am a dentist and recommend sensodyne products and give samples, but I just wanted at bigger tube for home use.</li>
      <li>Love the product.</li>
      <li>Pay attention to pricing here because the best price per ounce is not always the same package.</li>
      <li>Always love this brand.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll order more again.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad I can get it here.</li>
      <li>Been using for about 10 years and continue to love it</li>
      <li>For 2 more bucks, thinking about permanently switching to this brand from the Crests and Colgates.</li>
      <li>As it is, I can afford to pay a bit more because home delivery saves on fuel and time.</li>
      <li>I love this toothpaste and wish I had ordered it sooner.</li>
      <li>I love pronamel.</li>
      <li>But I&#x27;m pain free!</li>
      <li>I happen to like this one best  as it seems to have less aftertaste.</li>
      <li>If your mouth gums, or tounge get irritated, or sores pop up it may be time to switch to an SLS free toothpaste.</li>
      <li>This is good toothpaste, but I might have been able to get it cheaper at CVS or Walgreens if I lived in an urban area.  </li>
      <li>I had always used Sensodyne Pronamel with the blue cap (I believe that&#x27;s the Pronamel Multi-Action Cleansing Mint kind), and I liked the flavor and positive effects of the toothpaste, so I decided to order more.  </li>
      <li>Maybe what&#x27;s left in this tube can be converted to use in some kind of practical joke.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: I find that the \\&quot;Alpine Breeze\\&quot; flavor of this toothpaste is much more agreeable.</li>
      <li>for its primary function, it must be getting the job done because my teeth experience no sensitivity; so much so that sensitivity didn&#x27;t even occur to me until I read the product packaging just now.</li>
      <li>No trace of the punishing nature of the \\&quot;Fresh Wave\\&quot; flavor.</li>
      <li>It is a powerful irritant, and is a mouth culprit for pain, redness, and ulcers.  </li>
      <li>Thank you very much.</li>
      <li>Good product but not unique.</li>
      <li>Only wish that they would put more product in the tube for the price.</li>
      <li>/&gt;And since I haven&#x27;t been able to give up either cola or coffee, the fact that it prevents enamel erosion is a definite plus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Does exactly what I need it to do,clean and whiten my teeth while hopefully protecting my enamel and stopping any sensitivity I use to have.</li>
      <li>I love Sensodyne Pronamel products and have used them for a long time.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Does is really harden softer enamel?  </li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t really say yes or no to that</li>
      <li>Really like this toothpaste.</li>
      <li>and it really does work.</li>
      <li>This product would certainly fit the bill for that niche if daily use of whips and chains isn&#x27;t convenient, and it&#x27;s far more convenient for travel than such cumbersome lifestyle accessories.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>They work very well.</li>
      <li>Switching to more natural toothpaste though has done wonders for actually strengthening my teeth, compared to the temporary guard these offer.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s thick, cleans well, and leaves a good aftertaste.</li>
      <li>The Sensodyne Pronamel is very gentle if you have sensitive teeth</li>
      <li>This will go a long way towards your goal of a pain free mouth. </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this Pronamel version as my main toothpaste for about a year now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>a little paste, get more bubble</li>
      <li>This stuff really helps for people with sensitive teeth.</li>
      <li>in that department... I don&#x27;t like the taste/feel as much as the old formula.</li>
      <li>I purchased Sensodyne to prepare my teeth for the crest whitening strips which normally give me a toothache.  </li>
      <li>The metallic taste went away after a few (3-4) more days.  </li>
      <li>I use a lot of Sensodyne but one of 2 tubes from Amazon left such a strong taste/feeling of baking soda that I&#x27;d have to finish off with a mouthwash rinse to eliminate it.  </li>
      <li>After getting a bit older (we undead can literally live forever) and developing sensitive teeth, Pronamel has been my savior.</li>
      <li>I was pleasantly surprised, I did NOT get a toothache!</li>
      <li>Sodium Lauryl Sulfate is a foaming agent that&#x27;s used in all non natural or non sensitive  toothpastes.</li>
      <li>if you have sensitive teeth</li>
      <li>My dentist recommended this for my sensitive teeth.</li>
      <li>It shipped early and it was packaged well without a dent in the box.</li>
      <li>Can always count on Sensodyne to protect your sensitive teeth, no matter which variety you purchase.  </li>
      <li>No problems with hot or cold or eating anything super sweet.  </li>
      <li>Whoever put this on the market probably ran focus groups and determined that there&#x27;s a segment of the toothpaste market with a strong guilt complex resulting in masochistic behaviors.</li>
      <li>Feels much less harsh on the teeth, has pretty mild aftertaste.</li>
      <li>I honestly thought i got a bad batch of toothpaste when i first used it because of the numbing burning sensation on my tongue.</li>
      <li>I would definitely recommend this toothpaste for people with sensitive teeth.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using Sensodyne products on and off for a number of years, but a couple of sensitive teeth have me keep coming back.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m in my early fifties and want to protect my enamel, especially with drinking and eating acidic type of foods.</li>
      <li>I believe her that this is one of the least likely to damage my teeth and most likely to protect them.</li>
      <li>I would use standard Sensodyne paste for sensitive tooth.</li>
      <li>sensitive teeth protection... appears to be the same.</li>

<li> Needless to say I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
<li> I was a little skeptical when I saw the commercials for it on TV, but I have only used it for a week and have already noticed a difference!  </li>
<li> My dentist suggested sensodyne and no more sensitivity.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Love the product. Loved the price.</li>
    <li> I am going back to the tube due the cost of the cans.</li>
    <li> Has a baking soda taste, but that&#x27;s I with me as long as it works, which it does. If your mouth gums, or tounge get irritated, or sores pop up it may be time to switch to an SLS free toothpaste. Sodium Lauryl Sulfate is a foaming agent that&#x27;s used in all non natural or non sensitive  toothpastes. It is a powerful irritant, and is a mouth culprit for pain, redness, and ulcers.  This will go a long way towards your goal of a pain free mouth. </li>
    <li> Excellent product, great price and delivered as promised.</li>
    <li> I love this toothpaste and wish I had ordered it sooner. I&#x27;m in my early fifties and want to protect my enamel, especially with drinking and eating acidic type of foods. I would recommend this product and it has a nice minty taste.</li>
    <li> Wish it made my mouth fresher</li>
    <li> Remember that mouthwash ad about wanting to freshen breath rather than punishing your mouth for being bad? This mint product is like taking a handful of Altoids, popping them in your mouth, and just letting them sit there burning their way to your nether parts. Whoever put this on the market probably ran focus groups and determined that there&#x27;s a segment of the toothpaste market with a strong guilt complex resulting in masochistic behaviors. This product would certainly fit the bill for that niche if daily use of whips and chains isn&#x27;t convenient, and it&#x27;s far more convenient for travel than such cumbersome lifestyle accessories.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for its primary function, it must be getting the job done because my teeth experience no sensitivity; so much so that sensitivity didn&#x27;t even occur to me until I read the product packaging just now. I&#x27;d say stick with the Sensodyne brand but see if a milder flavor can get the job done without the double Altoid effect. Maybe what&#x27;s left in this tube can be converted to use in some kind of practical joke.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: I find that the \\&quot;Alpine Breeze\\&quot; flavor of this toothpaste is much more agreeable. No trace of the punishing nature of the \\&quot;Fresh Wave\\&quot; flavor. I&#x27;d give \\&quot;Alpine Breeze\\&quot; five stars.</li>
    <li> Feels much less harsh on the teeth, has pretty mild aftertaste. For 2 more bucks, thinking about permanently switching to this brand from the Crests and Colgates.</li>
    <li> Really like this toothpaste.</li>
    <li> Great product!  I was a little skeptical when I saw the commercials for it on TV, but I have only used it for a week and have already noticed a difference!  And this is after 5+ years of suffering when even just drinking cold water!  It says that it stakes 2-4 weeks to take effect, but it has been even quicker for me!</li>
    <li> ordered here to get choice of flavor</li>
    <li> Good product but not unique. I would use standard Sensodyne paste for sensitive tooth.</li>
    <li> Great product, tastes great, does not have SLS which I avoid since I suffer with canker sores when I use any toothpaste that has it.&lt;br /&gt;I am a dentist and recommend sensodyne products and give samples, but I just wanted at bigger tube for home use.</li>
    <li> This stuff really helps for people with sensitive teeth. It helps to strengthen your enamel and desensitize your teeth from pains. I like it a lot. It&#x27;s thick, cleans well, and leaves a good aftertaste. I&#x27;ll order more again.  Update: I kept buying these until I switched to making my own toothpaste. Sensodyne does a good job at leaving a layer of protection over your teeth to help with sensitivity. Switching to more natural toothpaste though has done wonders for actually strengthening my teeth, compared to the temporary guard these offer. It won&#x27;t actually rebuild or repair your enamel though.</li>
    <li> Used for years now and it does what it says. Don&#x27;t know about the whitening as I add hydrogen peroxide to the brush also.</li>
    <li> This could have just been a weird, concerning issue for me, so take this review with a grain of salt!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had been using Sensodyne toothpaste for months and I loved it.  I had always used Sensodyne Pronamel with the blue cap (I believe that&#x27;s the Pronamel Multi-Action Cleansing Mint kind), and I liked the flavor and positive effects of the toothpaste, so I decided to order more.  I ordered this flavor thinking it was the same flavor since the cap looks blue in the product picture, but the cap is actually blue/green.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using this toothpaste for only a few days, I noticed that I was tasting metal ALL THE TIME.  I wondered if it was the toothpaste, so I stopped using it immediately.  The metallic taste went away after a few (3-4) more days.  I googled this, and some other people mentioned this had happened to them too.  I do brush my tongue with my toothbrush when I brush, so maybe the toothpaste did something weird to my taste buds or something.  Scary, huh?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, this experience made me decide to not use Sensodyne anymore, and I have noticed that some tooth sensitivity has returned.</li>
    <li> Helped settle an active nerve after dental work.</li>
    <li> I would definitely recommend this toothpaste for people with sensitive teeth.  I was a bit hesitant because I had a bad reaction with another &amp;#34;sensitive&amp;#34; teeth toothpaste but this one did not give me any pain.  Needless to say I was pleasantly surprised.</li>
    <li> This was recommended to me by my dental hygienist. I believe her that this is one of the least likely to damage my teeth and most likely to protect them. I will continue to use this in the future for that reason.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I&#x27;ll note that it stings when it gets into a canker sore, and seems to make it harder for them to heal. So you might want to support it with some salt water for rinsing if you have the same problem.</li>
    <li> Like it. good product.</li>
    <li> Worse sensodyne product.</li>
    <li> This toothpaste does what it says...hardens and protects enamel.  Only wish that they would put more product in the tube for the price.</li>
    <li> This is good toothpaste, but I might have been able to get it cheaper at CVS or Walgreens if I lived in an urban area.  As it is, I can afford to pay a bit more because home delivery saves on fuel and time.</li>
    <li> My dentist recommended this type of non whitening pronamel. I happen to like this one best  as it seems to have less aftertaste.</li>
    <li> Thank you very much. This product is excelent!</li>
    <li> My dentist recommended this for my sensitive teeth. I&#x27;ve been using it for years and it really does work.</li>
    <li> Good purchase. The box was undamaged and am happy with my product.</li>
    <li> Been using for about 10 years and continue to love it</li>
    <li> Great tasting toothpaste, nice consistency. Can always count on Sensodyne to protect your sensitive teeth, no matter which variety you purchase.  Will keep buying it, and from Amazon.  You can&#x27;t beat their price or their Prime 2-day delivery.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical but this toothpaste has made a believer out of me.  I have had sensitive teeth for a long time and they had gradually gotten worse to the point where anything cold was very painful.  Sensodyne is taking me back to regular teeth again.</li>
    <li> I use this toothpaste everyday - don&#x27;t go anywhere without it.  My teeth are very sensitive - if I don&#x27;t use this toothpaste everyday - I have a dull pain :(</li>
    <li> I purchased Sensodyne to prepare my teeth for the crest whitening strips which normally give me a toothache.  I was pleasantly surprised, I did NOT get a toothache!</li>
    <li> have used for a long time.  very satisfied.</li>
    <li> I love pronamel. The kids pronamel had become difficult to find in the USA. I&#x27;m glad I can get it here.</li>
    <li> Just what I wanted. I especially like the cap that doubles as a stand for the product. It lets me put the toothpases down without taking up a lot of counter space.</li>
    <li> Excellent product for my sensitive gum.</li>
    <li> I have always used sensodyne and up until now never had a problem. This Fresh Wave flavor is awful. I honestly thought i got a bad batch of toothpaste when i first used it because of the numbing burning sensation on my tongue. It tasted like poison would taste. I will continue to use sensodyne but not this flavor. Can&#x27;t imagine anyone liking this chemical sensation in their mouth. But your mouth and taste buds return to normal after a few minutes.</li>
    <li> After getting a bit older (we undead can literally live forever) and developing sensitive teeth, Pronamel has been my savior. Now my teeth feel oddly invincible, and I&#x27;m never going back to regular toothpaste. Pay attention to pricing here because the best price per ounce is not always the same package.</li>
    <li> Great product for sensitive teeth at a great price.</li>
    <li> This product works great. It shipped early and it was packaged well without a dent in the box. I recommend!</li>
    <li> I love Sensodyne Pronamel products and have used them for a long time. It seems that recently they&#x27;ve changed their product formula though... I can tell a difference in the product over the last year in the feel/taste and something&#x27;s &amp;#34;off&amp;#34; in that department... I don&#x27;t like the taste/feel as much as the old formula. The benefit, however, of the toothpaste.... sensitive teeth protection... appears to be the same. This one probably has the best taste out of their offerings (depending on your tastes, of course).</li>
    <li> Good flavor and my teeth love it.</li>
    <li> if you have sensitive teeth this is the stuff for you. I use this stuff every day twice a day and neither cold nor hot foods/drinks bother me at all. It&#x27;s not the best for whiting but if you brush your teeth twice a day you shouldn&#x27;t have a problem. I do use whiting strips due to smoking. But I&#x27;m pain free! 100 out of 100 WILL buy again and again and again lol.</li>
    <li> I use a lot of Sensodyne but one of 2 tubes from Amazon left such a strong taste/feeling of baking soda that I&#x27;d have to finish off with a mouthwash rinse to eliminate it.  This was the &amp;#34;Freshest Breath&amp;#34; variety, which I&#x27;ll never risk buying again.</li>
    <li> a little paste, get more bubble。。。</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Sensodyne products on and off for a number of years, but a couple of sensitive teeth have me keep coming back.  I&#x27;ve been using this Pronamel version as my main toothpaste for about a year now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does not contain any taste of mint, which I do miss as it seems like your mouth just tastes fresher when using a mint toothpaste.  But this is one of those products where you feel the difference when you&#x27;re using it.  No problems with hot or cold or eating anything super sweet.  Go just 2 or 3 days using a different toothpaste and the sensitivity returns.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And since I haven&#x27;t been able to give up either cola or coffee, the fact that it prevents enamel erosion is a definite plus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does is really harden softer enamel?  I can&#x27;t really say yes or no to that as I haven&#x27;t noticed a difference in that area.</li>
    <li> Nice design great taste</li>
    <li> I have used Sensodyne products for years.  They work very well.</li>
    <li> always works the best</li>
    <li> My dentist suggested sensodyne and no more sensitivity. Works as promised.</li>
    <li> I use this product alternatively with Colgate Total Whitening Gel Toothpaste. The Sensodyne Pronamel is very gentle if you have sensitive teeth and I feel it does a very good job of cleaning my teeth. i will continue to order this from Amazon.</li>
    <li> Like how it feels to brush with</li>
    <li> Always love this brand.</li>
    <li> Does exactly what I need it to do,clean and whiten my teeth while hopefully protecting my enamel and stopping any sensitivity I use to have.</li>
    <li> This is the simply formula with protection but NO whitening. I&#x27;ve found the ones w/whitening often cause an increase in sensitivity, ironically. This formulation is the best!</li>
    <li> The best toothpaste ever made!</li>
