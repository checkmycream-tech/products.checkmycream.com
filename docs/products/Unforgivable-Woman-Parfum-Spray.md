      <li>the male one is also great for your partner... very sexy</li>

      <li>I&#x27;ve learned a valuable lesson, most of the sellers will take advantage of discontinued items and sell you watered down products.</li>
      <li>From other reviewers thought it would be a light citrusy scent, instead reminds me of an older woman&#x27;s &#x27;powdery&#x27; fragrance.</li>
      <li>Both equally smell great- &amp; different from the usual.</li>
      <li>I love that it has a nice, subtle smell that&#x27;s not overwhelming.  </li>
      <li>arrived early and is just what i wanted</li>
      <li>I work in a office and i am 30 years old...</li>
      <li>My daughter was thrilled because she loves the scent and was unable to find it anywhere</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> On of my favorite scents</li>
    <li> My daughter was thrilled because she loves the scent and was unable to find it anywhere</li>
    <li> I purchased this cologne as a Christmas gift for my daughter but I have used it on several occasions as well.  It has a light, sensual scent.  I would suggest not to use excessively as it may be too overpowering.  Good for a night on the town, special occasion or everyday wear.  I would recommend for wearers over the age of 25.</li>
    <li> Was disappointed with this scent.  From other reviewers thought it would be a light citrusy scent, instead reminds me of an older woman&#x27;s &#x27;powdery&#x27; fragrance.</li>
    <li> My current favorite scent and the price is good.</li>
    <li> Love, love, love this fragrance! Great price and fast shipping. Very happy with purchase.</li>
    <li> I love this Parfum.  I hope you always keep it in stock and with this price.  It&#x27;s unbelievable how little I purchased it for from Amazon.</li>
    <li> My favorite cologne! Great price, and fast delivery.</li>
    <li> I finally received what I thought I ordered.  Parfum Spray. But I received the same box but it was a vaporizer. This company is misleading. The perfume scent lasts for (I timed it) a little over 4 minutes!  I&#x27;ve learned a valuable lesson, most of the sellers will take advantage of discontinued items and sell you watered down products. Buyer beware!</li>
    <li> This is my # 1 pick when it comes to parfum.  I was so happy when I see that I could order it off here.  I used to buy from Wal-Mart, walgreens and they had stop selling it I was mad, but now I know where to look thanks Amazon</li>
    <li> I have used this product exclusively for more than 5 years.&lt;br /&gt; Have never had a fragrance that so matched my body chemistry.  Still get countless compliments.&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend this in a heartbeat.</li>
    <li> Great price no doubt I&#x27;m just mad it was discontinued &amp; I didn&#x27;t know I must have been under a rock but I&#x27;m glad I could still find it</li>
    <li> The best, I always get compliments on this fragrance!</li>
    <li> I work in a office and i am 30 years old...I wear this when I want to feel a powerful woman... delicious excent and its long lasting! the male one is also great for your partner... very sexy</li>
    <li> not my fav but wife really loves it; so, mom&#x27;s happy; i&#x27;m happy.  Good price and value compared to buying at a dept store</li>
    <li> arrived early and is just what i wanted</li>
    <li> this perfume seems to be watered down or something because it is not&lt;br /&gt;holding the scent for very long after i put it on?  this is my ultimate favorite perfume ever!&lt;br /&gt;just disappointed that this bottle seems weak. usually i can smell it all day long when i wear it.&lt;br /&gt;Even my husband commented on how he did not smell it on me like he usually does!</li>
    <li> Great Value for a Great Perfume. Since this product is hard to find in my local stores. I will be purchasing again from here in the future</li>
    <li> I have gotten so many compliments on this perfume.  I love that it has a nice, subtle smell that&#x27;s not overwhelming.  My husband loves it on me!</li>
    <li> I wore this a few years ago in high school. It&#x27;s a pretty smell that sticks with you all day. I wore it so often that I was known by that scent. So when I wear it now, my husband reminisces. I bought my husband the men&#x27;s version. Both equally smell great- &amp; different from the usual. Not flowery, or too sweet, but sexy. Sean John, you did it again. Ladies- get to it. Men- get it to your ladies :)</li>
    <li> This is one of my favorite fragrances.</li>
    <li> I purchased my perfume here because it is no longer offered in stores. Obviously I like it if I&#x27;m buying it. Lol</li>
    <li> This was a gift for my roommate. I gave it five  stars even though it was not for me , my roomate raves about it and how great it smells . She was super happy, so 5 stars it is!</li>
    <li> This perfume is heavenly, I love it.</li>
    <li> This perfume smells awesome! I wear it everyday now and I&#x27;m the type of person that likes to switch it up!</li>
    <li> I randomly purchased this cologne and little did I know that I would like it so much.  I believe that this is Sean John&#x27;s first parfume that hit the market, and it is a good one.  It has a hint of lemon in it, but it smells like a full fledged parfum.  It is a total delight.</li>
