<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I love doing my nails. I like to experiment and it&#x27;s cheaper than going to a salon once a week for a new polish design. That said, this set is great. It has everything you will need to get started. There is a wonderful assortment of brushes, but I especially like the stripping brushes. The dotting tools are great; they are double ended and all different sizes. The striping tape is smaller than I had anticipated but there are so many rolls that it doesn&#x27;t really make that big of a difference. Two of the tapes were doubles but that is expected since the description tells you they will be mixed, and I only use them to create lines so that doesn&#x27;t matter either. Overall, I&#x27;m completely impressed. The package got here on time and it is exactly as pictured. No surprises here. I&#x27;ve seen some comments about buying the same items cheaper from other sellers. Yes, you can do that. You should know though that if you choose to do that, it will take on average 4-6 weeks to get because it&#x27;s coming from China and most of those sellers will not work with you if there is a problem (I speak from personal experience). They are always buyer beware. This product here is worth the few extra dollars and if you&#x27;re impatient like me, you&#x27;ll want to get this one due to the fast shipping. ;)</li>
    <li> Granddaughter loves them</li>
    <li> Nice!&lt;br /&gt;So many, they&#x27;ll last forever.</li>
    <li> Perfect for my daughter who lives to do her nails, great price and fast delivery</li>
    <li> It is a great kit.  It comes with everything needed to make your nails beautiful.  The only downside was that the tape started peeling off the next day after applying it.  I applied everything in this order:  the base coat, the color, the tape, then a top coat.  First the ends of the tape started coming off, then only the middle of the tape remained.  I had to peel the whole thing off because it was barely holding on.  It looked beautiful when you first put the tape on.  Maybe next time I will try applying 2 or 3 layers of top coat.</li>
    <li> I ordered two sets of these brushes and tape strips for a &amp;#34;Girls&#x27; Night Out&amp;#34; event held at the middle school where I work.  They were happily and successfully used by 90 students and parents, and I was even asked where to purchase a set of the dotting tools by one of the participants; she loved them that much.  Yes, one of the tips fell off; but, we just used a dot of nail glue to secure it, and it was good as new.  The tools were easy to use by novice and more experienced nail decorators, and the tape strips were lots of fun and an easy way to ramp up the look of their nail art.  I recommend this set to anyone who wants to play with nail art and who isn&#x27;t necessarily looking for the ultimate in professional quality brushes and dotters, as these are good quality, but definitely not meant for use in a salon, etc.  I ended up ordering an additional set for the young lady who asked about where I purchased the set because she was so excited about the dotters.  So that is a testament to my approval of the product.  It&#x27;s a good value, and I would--and did--purchase it again.</li>
    <li> This is perfect for starting out to try some nail desings.</li>
    <li> So many tool means so many choices.  Great for making nail art.  Brushes are holding up nicely even after cleaning.</li>
    <li> both my daughters 10 and 16 years old love it</li>
    <li> Ordered this for our daughter and she loves it. Nice quality !!!</li>
    <li> Sets were durable and good quality. It came in a bag which is very convenient so you can travel with them.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s good for the price, the brushes a cheap though. It gets the job done.</li>
    <li> Items as described.  Great price, fast shipping!</li>
    <li> Never going to need another set again! There are sooo many tools here, I don&#x27;t know what to do with all of them! They&#x27;re amazing. I have a brush for everything I could want to do and more,they are sturdy and easy to clean, the dotting tools are lovely and everyone is a different size! The stripping tape too!! I didn&#x27;t realize it came in that many variations! I am in heaven!</li>
    <li> Daughters kit,  she enjoys doing different things with her nails.</li>
    <li> I love these brushes and dot pens. But at first look they looks so cheap. Yes they are cheap. But i expected a little bit harder brush hair than this.</li>
    <li> I have not used these yet, but the set is well worth the cost.  The shipping was fast and I can&#x27;t wait to use these!</li>
    <li> This was great.  The strips are really easy to use and don&#x27;t lose their color.  I stared at my toes for a day!  The stripes I added to my nails sparkled in the sun and looked awesome.  I used a bottom coat, then dark color, then the strips and then a top coat.  It looked very professional.  I haven&#x27;t used the brushes yet.  I&#x27;m a beginner (at age 63  :)  )......there seems to be a brush or tool for everything.  I&#x27;m enjoying doing my granddaughter&#x27;s toes too.</li>
    <li> Bought these tools as part of a manicure kit for my neice for Christmas.  Great products for a great price.  I was pleasantly surprised at the quality.  Wanted to keep them for myself!</li>
    <li> I had to glue my dotting tool together but the rest was great</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t get this it is not worth the money I got all of this stuff separately and it only cost me 7 dollars so don&#x27;t waste your money but them alone</li>
    <li> I gave this product because it came exactly as described, and every tool works with ease.  You don&#x27;t have to buy anything separately and wait for different shipping times/rates as this &amp;#34;kit&amp;#34; includes all the products you will need for simple to intermediate nail art designs.  I have created tribal, polka dotted, french, etc. with this nail kit.  I would definitely recommend this product for anyone that is looking to fancy-up their nails without paying money at a salon or paying for expensive tools.  The only flaw was the packaging because the dotting tools started to poke holes through the other end.  However, this was not a huge enough issue to reduce a star because I did not pay for the packaging, rather the tool itself is what I paid for.  Bottom line, great product, worth purchasing (so far)!</li>
    <li> Great value.  Really everything you could ever need in one package.  The brushes and dotting tools are good quality and there&#x27;s a nice selection and variety of colors in the striping tapes.</li>
    <li> We made a 16-year old the happiest teenager in the world today. Is it an understatement that she liked it?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All items arrived intact and as described. Not sure if it&#x27;s a professional-level kit but the brush tips were protected with plastic straw-like sleeves, the double-sided dotting tools were of different shaped ends and the multitudes of nail tape were wrapped up nicely. And the price was nice for a fun nail art kit. And a happy kid.</li>
    <li> You get so much in this set.  So fun!!</li>
    <li> My daughter does her nails. And loves this. She loves doing her nails!</li>
    <li> Got everything and they seem like they are of good quality ... Haven&#x27;t used me yet but I can&#x27;t wait ! Wish it would&#x27;ve came with a storage bag of some sort</li>
    <li> Loved the brushes, and the tapes were so cute. There were only 28 tapes though, if there were 30 like advertised I would have given 5 stars! All in all, I would have bought it again, and just might for a friend for Christmas!</li>
    <li> Great product, I love all the options of striping tape that I have. Brushes are good quality</li>
    <li> Great product arrived quickly. Only a few duplicate stripping tapes but that was expected.</li>
    <li> My 13 yr old daughter loves to do nail designs so this was a perfect kit for her. Everything is good quality and it arrived quicker than expected. She has been using them for months with no issues.</li>
    <li> A lot of tools for the price! And works amazing to teach my nail techs!</li>
    <li> Nice brush set! Multiple colors of the foil strips. Love it!</li>
    <li> good assortment, good price</li>
    <li> Lots of pieces and good quality for price</li>
    <li> Wanted brushes so getting dotting tools and striping tape is a big bonus.&lt;br /&gt;Does anyone know if the striping tape come in wider form like 1/4&amp;#34; or so?</li>
    <li> I expected a lot of duplicate striping tape, but there were very few. I&#x27;ve used them a few times and had no issues, they all stuck just fine. I&#x27;ve used all the dotting tools and 5 of the brushes, including one for clean-up that I dip directly in acetone, and they seem to be holding up just fine. I understand that because I use pure acetone on that one that I&#x27;ll have to replace it, but so far, so good. I have had no problems with them falling apart at this point. For the price, everything appears to be of decent quality, and I&#x27;m quite satisfied with this purchase. Yes, you can find most of these items for a lower price, but I was anxious to start creating, so Prime shipping was a deciding factor. I&#x27;ve bought single polishes that cost this much, but with this set I&#x27;m achieving lots of different looks. I&#x27;m a nail art newbie, and perhaps not the best judge of quality, but I&#x27;m having lots of fun with the set and have stepped up my manicures a bit. I&#x27;m including a picture of my first ever attempt, and all the imperfections you see are due to my own inexperience (not making sure the tape was completely flat, taking too long to remove it...newbie mistakes) and are not a reflection of the product itself. I hope this helps. :)</li>
    <li> Having so much fun with these tools and creating nail designs! Great product!</li>
    <li> Exactly as described, came quickly, my wife was very happy with her surprise! We couldn&#x27;t be more pleased with this transaction.</li>
    <li> Gave this to my daughter and she loved it.  She does her own nails every week and these tools were fun to use.</li>
    <li> It was a great gift for my daughter, she loved it.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my niece after ordering a set of brushes from China that never arrived. I had already purchased the dotting tools, but was looking for a new set I could get quickly that would qualify for Amazon Prime. The set looks very nice and I think my niece was excited to use it and try out the neat color rolls, as well.</li>
    <li> I bought these items in a set, and then realized I could buy all of them separately for about $5... Not happy with this price. I will definitely not be buying from this company again.</li>
    <li> I was a bit frustrated with this set because it took a long time to ship and came without promised additions.  However, the items I did get were very good quality for the money.  I really like the nail time for nail art designs, and the brushes work pretty well.  The dotting tools are my favorite and by far the easiest to use, I&#x27;d suggest starting with these if you&#x27;re new at nail art like me.  Great set for the money if you want to wait.</li>
    <li> A nice assortment of nail brushes and tabe.</li>
    <li> This was my first-ever purchase of nailart tools &amp; I&#x27;m very pleased with them. I absolutely LOVE the dotters. I&#x27;ve actually found that I can paint with them in addition to dotting with them. I haven&#x27;t perfected any sort of fine technique with brush painting, so I&#x27;m sticking with the dotters for now. The quality of the brushes is fairly good for the price, though I don&#x27;t have much experience with other brushes. I&#x27;ve only used the tape twice -- the red &amp; the blue. The red stayed on for several days until I decided to change my mani, but the blue peeled off after the first time I took a shower. That could be because it was the first time I&#x27;ve ever used tape in a mani design, and not because the quality of the tape was poor. Or maybe my top coat just didn&#x27;t agree with the coating on the tape. Who knows. But my set did include all different colored tapes, no duplicates. Anyway, this is a perfect set for a nailart newb such as myself &amp; I highly recommend it. Fast shipping, too. Thanks so much!</li>
    <li> I loved everything. I make my nail designs with each of these products &amp; I couldn&#x27;t be happier with them.</li>
    <li> these are great i do recommend them for more bling they work great you have to use polish to help them stick better and then top coat over it to keep them from stripping off.</li>
    <li> I like all the set of this products, the brushes, the roll strips and the dot tools are very nice. The only thing I have to add is that one  of the dot tools came broken, happily was fixable because was the metal point that get unattached from the plastic body. I don´t know if it was during handling and shipping or i came like that from the supplier.</li>
    <li> Items came VERY quickly!  Great condition and as advertised/described!  Great quality items!  Will purchase again from them!</li>
    <li> good quality, love the brushes!!</li>
    <li> Fast shipping, items look just like the photos. Look clean and nice. I haven&#x27;t tried it yet.</li>
    <li> The tape doesn&#x27;t stay on the nail and all of the tools were apart in the bag. I had to superglue all of the brush heads back on, and that&#x27;s only because I don&#x27;t want to go through the hassle of returning everything. Wouldn&#x27;t buy again.</li>
    <li> There was way more here than I expected.  Love it!</li>
