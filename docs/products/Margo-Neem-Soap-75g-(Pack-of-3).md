      <li>Something in this soap makes them steer clear and who can&#x27;t love that.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not crazy about this soap at all.</li>

      <li>But for camping they ought to be just right.</li>
      <li>Knocked them right out.</li>
      <li>It is best to use with a dark color washcloth because it can stain a white cloth but other than that it is good with me and my family.</li>

      <li>It&#x27;s very gentle on the skin.    </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> It is a good soap no doubt .It has \\&quot;Neem\\&quot; leaves which is proven to be good for skin. The soap size is very small as compared to what I expected.</li>
    <li> I bought this soap for a family member with acne issues and eczema. The smell of the soap is kind of funny....something that just takes some time getting used to...BUT the soap seems to work for her. Since using the soap she has experienced fewer breakout than with regular soap and it does not dry out her skin like some of the other acne product out there. So far so good- will update as more time passes....keeping my fingers crossed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;8/3/11&lt;br /&gt;Well it has been a few months since purchasing the soap and I must say I like it. The smell takes some getting used to, but it has worked well for my sisters skin. Her acne has really shown improvement and my eczema is really doing well with the soap. The thing I like most is that whenever I bathe in it and then go outside I do not get eaten up with mosquito bites like normal. Something in this soap makes them steer clear and who can&#x27;t love that. I am running low, so if you will excuse me I need to go order some more...lol!!</li>
    <li> This soap is great.  It has a really earthy smell (\\&quot;African\\&quot; is the best way I can describe it).     It&#x27;s very gentle on the skin.    I often go walking in places where there&#x27;s lots of mosquitoes, so the repellent nature of the soap is an added bonus.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried many acne products over the years but by the time I hit 30, I was still getting recurring spots in the &#x27;T zone&#x27;.    I discovered Margo soap a couple of years ago and after one application of Margo soap, my skin felt the cleanest it ever has done, but without the dryness that other soaps cause. Within a month of twice-daily use, instead of having two or three spots at one time, I now only succumb to a spot every few weeks and even then they are nowhere near as angry or noticeable as before. On the three occasions that I&#x27;ve stopped using Margo, I&#x27;ve noticed the acne creep back.  Margo soap truly is amazing! I&#x27;ve found this soap at various markets in the States, but it&#x27;s not as easy to get hold of in the UK, so I mail order it from India whilst there. It makes it more expensive, but still miles cheaper than over-the-counter acne preperations. Don&#x27;t get it in your eyes either - the anti-bacterial neem oil stings to high Heaven!  Give Margo a go, but make sure you give it a month of dedicated, twice-daily use: I&#x27;d be suprised if you don&#x27;t see marked results.</li>
    <li> thought it would work as an acne remedy, it does not accomplish that (at least for me), HOWEVER it does reduce oily skin and i realized fewer black-heads.  the anti-bacterial part was a big plus, i am a germaphobe. soap is light, non-greasy, and anti-bacterial. perfect for me.  i&#x27;d recommend it. give it a try.</li>
    <li> Love it. I can&#x27;t stop buying it.</li>
    <li> Decent soap but no miracle cure. I saw no noticeable difference in my skin. Aroma not bad for a Neem a product. I will not buy it again.</li>
    <li> Small bars but expected that. They are only 75 grams. But for camping they ought to be just right. I picked up a bug that caused a rash last fall into winter and decided it had to come from an over crowded campground over on Flathead lake. The johns were over run by too many campers and couldn&#x27;t stay cleaned as most are kept. Not sure if they can do much about it but they ought to put some of the money collected into solving that issue. However who knows who left that bug it was a microscopic thing. And the specialists I saw swore it was not any mite human they know of. Also no one ever saw a mite or bug or ogranism. But it was sent to two different pathology reports and the last one came back saying it was bug bites. So the orginal dermatologist who swore it was not...had to eat crow so to speak. She had yelled at me when she first asked me to describe the rash to her..and I said it&#x27;s like tiny bug bites...not yeast not heat not irritation like metal or latex which I can get. She told me that&#x27;s a medical description and to use my own terminology. I told her my terminology is BUG BITE...tiny bug bite and no can not find one have been trying and looking under the Zoom microcsope I do own for other scientific purposes....in my field of work. Anyway a biopsy was taken and sent off to labs...first one said BUG BITE and second said consistent with BUG BITE but no one identified the BUG bugging me. But the meds cleared it up finally. And so....this year I&#x27;m going to use NEEM soap during any visits to campgrounds in hopes I do not pick up something like this again. It was very hard to cure. Neem is a pretty decent defense though it may also work as a natural bug killer too. I have not used it as such only prevention.</li>
    <li> I bought this because I thought it would be good for my skin.  I really didn&#x27;t see much difference.  Also don&#x27;t care for the smell.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff!  It prevents breakouts and smells awesome. It also mild enough for me and my daughter to use on our entire bodies, just wish I could get it locally</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not crazy about this soap at all. It has a very strong and unpleasant odor. It might be okay for daytime use, but I wouldn&#x27;t want to go to bed smelling it on my body. It also leaves a film on the skin that is somewhat oily. I thought that it would be moisturizing, but instead it leaves my skin feeling tight and dry. That&#x27;s just how it&#x27;s worked on my skin. It might work for someone else. But still, the odor is pretty strong. I also purchased Maximum Strength Neem Oil Soap - 4 oz - Bar Soap by Organix and like that a lot better. It has an odor, too, but it&#x27;s not as strong. It also leaves a film on the skin, but much less so than the Margo Neem soap. And I do not experience any dryness or tightness using that.</li>
    <li> I bought this soap to help get rid of scabies.  I checked about 10 other websites for a list of ingredients, but couldn&#x27;t find one...  I received the soap today and they STINK, and not like neem as I would have expected.  For inquiring minds, here are the ingredients as listed on the packaging:   Sodium palmate, sodium palm kernelate/cocoate, sodium soap of neem oil, talc, PERFUME, petroleum jelly, lauric acid, disodium EDTA, disodium etidronate, lanolin, hard paraffin, vitamin E acetate, glyeryl monostearate, methyl paraben, CI 12740, and CI 61565.  The good news is you can hardly smell the neem (if that smell bothers you), the bad news is the perfume is quite strong--I can smell the soap from hall outside the bathrooms.</li>
    <li> I bought this after reading online several places how great it was for your skin &amp; was a \\&quot;natural\\&quot; way to clear up acne, I have mild acne on my forhead &amp; chin, I only used this soap for about 10 days, so perhaps I didn&#x27;t give it a fair shot - but it made my face VERY red and it felt HOT for hours after, so I couldn&#x27;t stand it and I stopped using it.  I didn&#x27;t notice my skin being any clearer.  It did feel very clean, but the it was not worth it to me to have a bright red face from using this. Also I was not a fan of the smell of this soap.</li>
    <li> A huge differance from homemade Soaps, Strong Neem Green! Want to get a Clean Body, Use IT!! Helps the Skin and I Shampoo with it also. After a long day a quick Shower with this Soap is The Bomb!</li>
    <li> Great soap. Used it to kill fleas on my Chihuahua. Knocked them right out.</li>
    <li> I will love Neem for the rest of my life. Cleared up my daughters ring worm ridded my face of acne....removed the dandruff from my husband....and even said bye bye to nasty athletes foot!!! gotta love it!</li>
    <li> It is Great!!!!  from the first time you use it you feel the difference.  The smell well...... that is another story, but the rewards are greater than the smell.</li>
    <li> This is a nice soap.  The smell of it didn&#x27;t bother me as it does some other reviewers.  It just smells like soap, although not a flowery, perfumed soap.  It makes a nice lather and is soothing.  But I bought it in hopes it would repell &amp;#34;invisible stinging bugs.&amp;#34;  Now that my body has broken out in all its creases and folds with a bright red itchy rash, I&#x27;ve also hoped that it would help to combat and heal the rash.  However, it does not seem to have any particular repellant or healing effect on the bugs so it has proven useless for me for that purpose.</li>
    <li> Not sure how good this soap is .. Price ok</li>
    <li> This soap is helping keep my eczema under control this winter. A staple for me.  So happy I found this product.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s just ok I think it stinks just like the oil.</li>
    <li> I tried this \\&quot;acne remedy\\&quot; and was totally skeptical about it working. I only got it because it was cheap and worth a try. It took 2 days to clear up my moderate acne, and it also evened out my skin tone which was also nice. The only down side is that it smells awful.   My boyfriend tried using it to clear up his psoriasis because we found a few websites that said it worked for that, but it didn&#x27;t really do anything. It just treats acne. But really, my skin hasn&#x27;t even felt cleaner.</li>
    <li> Great product.  Smell is very strong, similar to tea tree oil.  It helped with my itchy scalp.  I only used it for a few days but my scalp feels relief already.</li>
    <li> Fast delivery. Good price. Excellent quality. Does superior cleaning of the skin.</li>
    <li> Very fast delivery and my friend and her daughter love it. Will definitely be purchasing again</li>
    <li> This product worked great to clear up skin appearing of uneven skin tone and dryness but is a little high in price.  I was informed by some of my coworkers that the same product may be found in west Indian store for less.</li>
    <li> I was worried about the smell after reading the other reviews. The smell won&#x27;t win any awards, but it&#x27;s pretty minor. The main thing I care about is how wonderful this soap is for my skin. This is something I&#x27;ll buy regularly. Make sure to buy the soap at least 30 days in advance; the shipping comes from India so it takes forever.</li>
    <li> I use a neem clay face mask that is absolutely amazing! Seeing the effects neem had on my skin I thought I would give this a shot. The soap does, in fact, smell like neem...which isn&#x27;t the most pleasant smell in the world...but you don&#x27;t smell it once you rinse it off. I WILL recommend that those purchasing this don&#x27;t leave it sitting on a ledge in the shower or anywhere it will be constantly attacked by water....the bar will slowly start to \\&quot;peel\\&quot; into layers and become hard. I personally keep mine in one of those small travel soap holders and it lasts 2-3 times as long! Good stuff...and I even received a free gift! Margo makes good, quality products! Check it out!</li>
    <li> Did not like this soap or the smell.</li>
    <li> Love this soap! Great clean and especially great for acne.</li>
    <li> This product help with the bites  by helping get rid of the bites on the skin. It help stop the itching and did not cause a rash on the skin. Would buy again if needed.</li>
    <li> Delivery was reasonable considering it went through the military APO system via New York first. The product which I bought locally overseas the first time, then couldn&#x27;t find it again, is excellent. The cleansing properties of neem is why I purchased it to begin with. And neem delivers. I use the bar soap as a body wash and separately on my face resulting in a squeaky clean without drying out my already dry skin. It&#x27;s invigorating and refreshing. The smell is different but I&#x27;ve never considered it annoying. I have basal skin carcinoma and rosacia on my face and other areas, and neem is very user-friendly for it combined with using virgin coconut oil after a wash. Anyway, pleased with everything from price to delivery to use and result. Will definitely keep this product in stock.</li>
    <li> Really enjoy this soap. I would&#x27;ve liked to see more &#x27;significant&#x27; results for my dry skin problem...but, I am seeing a little improvement. Thanks again.</li>
    <li> A very fragrant soap, and it doesn&#x27;t have any actual sensation, no tingling or anything like that, but I just like it.</li>
    <li> I ordered this soap but received Natures Stream organic lavender neem soap. It is beautiful so I am happy they messed up the order!</li>
    <li> Since gardening without gloves and walking on my flower bed shoeless. That happens to be a stay cats litter box.I have been battling parasitic infestation . This soap is amazing!!! You can feel and see it working. It may not be bath and body works with the smell but it&#x27;s not that bad of a smell just reminds me of zest</li>
    <li> love this soap smells pretty good and I feel good after using for 2 weeks now</li>
    <li> the worst smelling soap i have ever used...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;right when i took it out.. i was a lil upset.. then i used it in the shower and i got pissed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;threw all 3 bars away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i&#x27;ll be sticking to organix neem instead.</li>
    <li> This soap smells great--also leaves my skin feeling super soft and cleansed !! Very affordable and lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> I received the soap on Tuesday it is now Sunday. I used it as soon as it arrived and i have to say that i am absolutely pleased with the soap. I have been in the battle against bed bugs and had been looking for something to relieve the itching and scarring from these bugs. I have twin toddler boys and they have been getting bit as well as myself and one of my sons and myself have been having a bad allergic reaction to the bites, my arm was horrible and i thought i was going to have to get my arm tattooed to hide the scarring, so within a week my arm is healing wonderfully. My son had a bad reaction all over the trunk of his body which started a week after my arm had been attacked my these creatures, so within three days of me using the soap on him his swelling and bumps have diminished. I am very very pleased that there will be no terrible scars left on him. I did find that the soap can dry out my face so i will now start to use it every 2 days.</li>
    <li> I absolutely adore this soap. i bought it because regular retail store soap was not cutting it anymore for various reasons. But this without a doubt left my skin clean and so freaking soft. The main reason i purchased was after coming across &amp;#34;neems&amp;#34; abundance of multi uses on the internet bible (Pintrest) lol. I get really painfully bad Palitine cyst under my arms, as well as on my V. I have gone to doctors and not much of anything has helped, but this has done miracles for my body. As previously stated it has a suddle sent,  which only last while in use in the shower. I have notice the smell reacts different on initial contact with a womans V than it does on a mans P, however again it last only while in the shower(by the time you rinse and get out theres not smell). You also get use to it after a few uses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How it comes: three medium deep green square sized bars.</li>
    <li> I like using this soap, it has a nice herbaly smell and it leaves me feeling clean and great. You get a good amount of bars for your money (3). I will keep buying this soap.</li>
    <li> Best, safest soap you can buy</li>
    <li> I had a really bad break out during my time of using this. It may be due in part to me being allergic to most plants. I should have known better.</li>
    <li> Received it, haven&#x27;t bought it in a while because my local health food store was carrying it. It works well with my skin problems. Hyper sensitive to most soaps.</li>
    <li> This soap may not cure your skin problems,but is sure will subside it. This soap doesn&#x27;t spell pleasant,but it clears up the most difficult skin condition. Try it and see for yourself. I did,and my children. It cleared up their pimples and blackhead. Their and my skin is clear and smooth.</li>
    <li> Safely shipped, just as described.</li>
    <li> Smells bad, works like a surgical soap. Haven&#x27;t noticed much softening or relief from skin issues yet. 2 days</li>
    <li> I am amazed on how well this soap really clears your problem areas!  Good for body and face. Soap bars are very small though. Even if you buy the 3 pack you go through them quick!</li>
    <li> I ordered this for my TV but I haven&#x27;t seen any results yet. I&#x27;m still using it. IT SMELLS TERRIBLE!!</li>
    <li> This soap it great for everything, even your hair. This soap has helped my complexion tremendously! Thank you so much!</li>
    <li> This is a great product, gets down to the sebaceous and cleans it our the hair follicle. Great for any type of skin problem. At 65 I am experiencing more of this stuff. Use it at the gym to kill athletes food fungus. It has Neem oil in it so it cleans and seals. Your skin will thank you. As always Amazon is the best.</li>
    <li> I was disappointed.  I&#x27;ve brought the same soap before but at a better price.</li>
    <li> Stinks but makes your skin smoother and apparently is good for blemishes.</li>
    <li> This is a great soap. Works well if you have any type of body breakouts like on your back. I&#x27;ve gotten used to the smell and I love this soap.</li>
    <li> its okay, suds are incredibly green which leaves me to suspect color dye, also leaves some sort of film like other soaps.</li>
    <li> I like this soap.  Like others have mentioned this soap does stink.  If I don&#x27;t put it in a zip-lock bag it will smell up my whole bedroom.  I do feel very clean after I use it and it does the job.  Knowing this is a bacteria killer puts my mind at ease.  I haven&#x27;t used it long enough to say the effects it has on acne.</li>
    <li> Ok the first few times I used it the smell was like industrial soap. Like you would find in a fast food restaurant or gas station. But this time I do smell the poop odor some. It&#x27;s not super strong but it&#x27;s there. It does have a tea tree oil type odor as well. I&#x27;ve only been using it for a week so I&#x27;ve not seen a big difference in my skin. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for someone who has a professional job where you work with other people unless you want to explain it to them.</li>
    <li> very good price, I use it daily.</li>
    <li> I like this soap. this soap is good.</li>
    <li> I was having trouble with  acne on my face and tried  numberious products but this Neem soap did the job.  It also help fade dark spots. Thanks.</li>
    <li> The soap has a great smell and it helps to tone down the natural smell of the Neem oil, which can be horrible. It is best to use with a dark color washcloth because it can stain a white cloth but other than that it is good with me and my family.</li>
