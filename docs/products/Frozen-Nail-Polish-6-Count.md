      <li>Perfect gift for any little girl who loves Frozen!</li>
      <li>Cute packaging and pretty colors of polish.</li>
      <li>Perfect for the little one that loves frozen!!</li>

      <li>It comes off pretty easily since it is a non toxic product.</li>
      <li>My 4 year old grand daughter was excited to get her nails done.</li>
      <li>Great quality for toddlers and little girls.</li>
      <li>Obviously not a &#x27;serious&#x27; nail polish, but it&#x27;s as close to real as something that is safe and fuss-free can be.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t smell and peels right off.</li>
      <li>My little girl will love these nail polishes, really like the fact that they are safe for children</li>
      <li>My daughter still loves the bottles -- and they are pretty -- but they just sit on the shelf for now until I can get away with throwing them out.</li>
      <li>It accomplished what I needed it to do!</li>
      <li>In summary, this is pretty</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s pretty much like a glue based typed polish</li>
      <li>At 6, she prefers and has used real nail</li>
      <li>I was on my way out to lunch with friends (which I rarely do with a 2 year old) and grabbed one to take in with me.</li>
      <li>I really Like this nail polish....</li>
      <li>so it has that &#x27;real feel&#x27; to her.</li>
      <li>She was so excited to have her toes polished, we left the polish there</li>
      <li>the 4-soon-to-be-5 year old I babysit could use on her own (with adult supervision of course, but I mean use it herself as she is very independent and insists on applying her own nail polish)</li>
      <li>but it has peeled off a good bit less than 24 hours later.</li>
      <li>but thats exactly what I wanted for my 3 year old</li>
      <li>3 year old granddaughter loves nail polish.  </li>
      <li>Got it for my 7 1/2 year old neice</li>
      <li>The colors DO take a few coats if you want something bold, but one coat is sufficient.</li>

    <li> my daughter love em and so do I its safe for children it peals off easy but thats exactly what I wanted for my 3 year old</li>
    <li> my daughter loves the colors</li>
    <li> Our granddaughter is thrilled with these.</li>
    <li> my daughter will love this</li>
    <li> Some parents would probably prefer fake nail polish that peels right off like this. It does come off easily, and in one easily peeled piece in the shape of each nail. But my daughter was really disappointed b/c it didn&#x27;t even last an hour before each nail began to peel. At 6, she prefers and has used real nail polish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Applying this was also weird as it&#x27;s very thin and transparent so it takes multiple (about 5) coats to get anythign close to the color in the bottle onto the kid&#x27;s nails. What little kid is going to sit still for 5 coats of nail polish?  Or be satisfied with the barest hint of color you get from one or two coats? Overall, it was just a disappointment for us. My daughter still loves the bottles -- and they are pretty -- but they just sit on the shelf for now until I can get away with throwing them out. Would def not buy again.</li>
    <li> Gave as a gift and they are very nice.  She loved the &amp;#34;Frozen&amp;#34; title and all the girls in it.</li>
    <li> Great product! Can be removed with water! Perfect for little girls!</li>
    <li> It was a Christmas present for my niece and she loved it.</li>
    <li> I got these for my niece for her birthday and she loves them!  Perfect gift for any little girl who loves Frozen!</li>
    <li> Just received and painted my 3yo nails. She LOVES it! She wanted her nails done &amp;#34;like mommy&#x27;s&amp;#34; but I didn&#x27;t want to deal with fumes or chemicals (polish or removers) so this was perfect and bonus mommy points for it being Frozen :-)</li>
    <li> I really Like this nail polish.... great to use as Party favors. Would recomend it for birthday parties. Good product.</li>
    <li> 4 YEAR OLD GRANDDAUGHTER LOVED IT</li>
    <li> Just as described! Perfect for the little one that loves frozen!!</li>
    <li> Arrived and some of the colors were completely dried out. Don&#x27;t bother purchasing. Very disappointing</li>
    <li> The polish stays on for up to a 1/2 hour at most. Piggy Paint is much better. It&#x27;s safe and lasts longer.</li>
    <li> Great Niece loved it!!!</li>
    <li> My kid just loved. It comes off pretty easily since it is a non toxic product. I super recommend! And for me, it arrived so quickly!</li>
    <li> 3 year old granddaughter loves nail polish.  Good for children.  She paid her Uncles toe nails while he was asleep.</li>
    <li> Granddaughter loved it</li>
    <li> gifts so rating isn&#x27;t factual</li>
    <li> My little girl will love these nail polishes, really like the fact that they are safe for children</li>
    <li> Perfect for a little girl who loves having her nails done. Comes off easily.</li>
    <li> Cute packaging and pretty colors of polish. My 4 year old grand daughter was excited to get her nails done. However, that is where the good stuff ended. On the orange polish the brush wouldn&#x27;t stay attached to the cap lid so there wasn&#x27;t anything to hold. The polish does not go on well at all and we took it off of her fingers minutes after application. Once applied, this polish became rather plastic feeling or like clingy vinyl. It just did not stick to the nail and if on her hands very easily could get in her food. Even though it is labeled as nontoxic, I still don&#x27;t want my Darling ingesting this. She was so excited to have her toes polished, we left the polish there but it has peeled off a good bit less than 24 hours later. In summary, this is pretty but otherwise it&#x27;s a waste of money.</li>
    <li> Great quality for toddlers and little girls.</li>
    <li> Perfect gift for little girls</li>
    <li> Nail polish was dried out</li>
    <li> Cute set of nail polish for those Frozen fans. Got it for my 7 1/2 year old neice and she loved them!</li>
    <li> Colors are nice and my daughter loved it as a gift.</li>
    <li> I saw the reviews of others who seemed disappointed in quality of this product, which is why I decided to purchase this product to begin with. I was seeking something the 4-soon-to-be-5 year old I babysit could use on her own (with adult supervision of course, but I mean use it herself as she is very independent and insists on applying her own nail polish) She likes to join in when her 10 and 12 year old sisters are painting their own nails. This product is perfect! The bottles are a solid glass so it has that &#x27;real feel&#x27; to her. The colors DO take a few coats if you want something bold, but one coat is sufficient. It&#x27;s pretty much like a glue based typed polish so it peels/washes right off beautifully! Obviously not a &#x27;serious&#x27; nail polish, but it&#x27;s as close to real as something that is safe and fuss-free can be. Plus it made her happy. The characters on the bottle and color choices were perfect. It accomplished what I needed it to do!</li>
    <li> Very cute but wish sven was on one of the bottles like in the picture.  Any frozen fan would love these</li>
    <li> The nail polish is cheap and does not stay on. BUT my daughters still LOVE them!!</li>
    <li> These are awesome! I was on my way out to lunch with friends (which I rarely do with a 2 year old) and grabbed one to take in with me. Great idea! She sat at the table and painted her nails till her lunch came. It doesn&#x27;t smell and peels right off. Great colors as well.</li>
