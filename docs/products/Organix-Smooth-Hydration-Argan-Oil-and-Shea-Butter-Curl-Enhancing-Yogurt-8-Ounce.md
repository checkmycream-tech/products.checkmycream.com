      <li>It is also excellent for twist outs, two strand twists, and roller sets.</li>
      <li>I had to experiment with the amount before I found my perfect match.</li>
      <li>So, I started using it for just that since it has a wonderful smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

      <li>No frizz and smells great.  </li>
      <li>Did I mention how happy I am with my hair?  </li>
      <li>The application of the cream is great because it has the consistency of whipped butter and distributes evenly when you rub it between your palms.</li>
      <li>and this moisturizes very effectively.</li>
      <li>I ordered this product for a family member and it worked so good that I had to order them another one great product</li>
      <li>Plus it smells really good</li>
      <li>Package came quickly and perfectly.</li>
      <li>This is my favorite product of all!</li>
      <li>I love it!  </li>
      <li>It does have a nice scent to it, though.  </li>
      <li>This is the best curl product I have found so far.</li>
      <li>Eh... It&#x27;s OK.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad it works for others, but I&#x27;m throwing my jar in the trash.</li>
      <li>I love the smell too.</li>
      <li>I mix this product with a heavier cream because my hair desires more moisture to be tamed.</li>
      <li>Oh I love the smell of this product I have heads turning</li>
      <li>Love this.</li>
      <li>so I thought I might be able to use this when I run out</li>
      <li>I love this</li>
      <li>I love how this stuff works.  </li>
      <li>and I don&#x27;t have immediate time to make more.  </li>
      <li>can&#x27;t seem to find it on the shelves any more, and I panicked.</li>
      <li>This works good for my very curly hair.  </li>
      <li>I use it on my daughter hair all the time as her is fine and frizzes easily so it helps to maintain style while providing a light sheen.</li>
      <li>Overall great light product.</li>
      <li>and I use it to smooth and soften my hair too.</li>
      <li>and I have used so many things in the stores for curly hair that I could open my own shop.  </li>
      <li>My palm was full after conditioning.  </li>
      <li>But the company&#x27;s shipping was quick. .</li>
      <li>This product made my fine wavy/curly hair look much frizzier than without it.  </li>
      <li>This leaves my hair so soft and lovely smelling.</li>
      <li>I end up having NO FRIZZ and lovely soft ringlets.  </li>
      <li>It helps with the frizz in the summer and actually makes my hair look healthy and smooth.  </li>
      <li>I wanted to find a product that I could use after cleansing with Wen, instead of using more Wen after showering, which seems to be necessary to get the full effect.&lt;br /&gt;If</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been searching for this product for weeks since first seeing it online.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad I picked up the last 2 jars on the shelf.</li>
      <li>Love it and recommend it to all my sisters with curly or coarse hair .</li>
      <li>Always looking for new hair products and love this one so far.</li>
      <li>Great instant moisturizer for your scalp and shine for your hair, but not much curl affect/pattern on my 4A hair type,</li>
      <li>however I noticed an incredibly large amount of my hair falling out in the shower.  </li>
      <li>It is a great moisturizer and creates light fluffy curls that aren&#x27;t weighed down.</li>
      <li>This product is a great for black hair and short curly hair styles</li>
      <li>/&gt;Not worth ordering for natural 4b/4c hair.  </li>
      <li>I like that this feels very moisturizing</li>
      <li>I highly recommend it!</li>
      <li>Since it contains shea butter and argan oil, I assumed it would really moisturize my hair.  </li>
      <li>plus it really does enhance my curls.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t really care the product itself.</li>
      <li>I already have very curly hair</li>
      <li>My hair is not crunchy but it is still very well defined when using this cream.</li>
      <li>and it really does enhance your curls.</li>
      <li>I started using this product on my loose natural hair about 2 years ago as a moisturizer and not only did it moisturize my hair, it made it soft and smell soooooo good.</li>
      <li>I have super strait long hair</li>
      <li>I have a young son who is mixed and has super soft curly hair I did not want to use any product in his hair that would leave it feeling crunchy.</li>
      <li>It makes hair noticeably more lustrous and doesn&#x27;t weigh it down, as long as I do not use too much.</li>
      <li>I like to use it on dry hair to calm frizz during the day.  </li>
      <li>My usual conditioning products work far better than this.</li>
      <li>This curl enhancing yogurt provides a light fragrant moisturizer to seal ends and hydrate natural styles without weighing it down.</li>
      <li>It works better if I blow dry my hair, but I was really hoping for a product that would make my hair look a little neater without blow drying.  </li>
      <li>I comb my hair in the shower with BWC Conditioner, gently towel dry and then apply a finger full of this product and finger comb through and let air dry.  </li>
      <li>I have natural curly hair</li>
      <li>My hair is touchably soft after using this as part of my wash and go routine.</li>
      <li>Not to heavy, not too light.</li>
      <li>This hair yogurt leaves his hair soft and defines his curls</li>
      <li>Curl cream is not heavy and doesn&#x27;t make your hair sticky.</li>
      <li>I have naturally curly hair</li>
      <li>This is an okay purchase that I probably wont make again; this covers my hair and makes it heavy and the  is not worth the money.</li>
      <li>My first day of using this it really dried out my hair.  </li>
      <li>It has a subtle nutty scent, nothing special</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I love how this stuff works.  My local store stopped selling it so I had to come to amazon to find it again.  I use it on both wet and dry hair.  I use it on wet hair to help define my wavy hair and reduce frizz.  I like to use it on dry hair to calm frizz during the day.  I only use a small amount and It doesn&#x27;t make my hair sticky.  Plus it smells really good</li>
    <li> This makes my make hair soft and keeps the curl helps a little bit with the frizz but not much</li>
    <li> This is my favorite product of all! The smell, the definition and moisture it gives to my curls... AMAZING.&lt;br /&gt;But of course, this product is no longer in production I had emailed Oraganix and they stated this ;(</li>
    <li> Not to heavy, not too light. To keep my hair from being weighed down, I only condition in the shower and then use this on the bottom half of my hair (that is as long as the base of my spine). In between washes some is applied to my ends if  they get crinkly dry. I love the smell too.</li>
    <li> Did not work well with my hair at all when I used it while damp. I have not tried it on my dry hair yet.</li>
    <li> Did not like the smell or how it left my hair!</li>
    <li> I have natural curly hair and I have used so many things in the stores for curly hair that I could open my own shop.  Came across this and OMG....I love it!  It helps with the frizz in the summer and actually makes my hair look healthy and smooth.  I hope they never stop making this!</li>
    <li> My first day of using this it really dried out my hair.  Days 2-4 it worked perfectly, my curls were defined and bouncy however I noticed an incredibly large amount of my hair falling out in the shower.  My palm was full after conditioning.  I stopped using it and my hair is no longer falling out.  Unfortunately for me this product worked but was not worth me losing my hair over.  I will be returning this product.</li>
    <li> Purchased thinking I could afford to waste $8 on yet another product that would leave my hair either sticky or greasy.  It does neither.  I&#x27;m SO HAPPY!  I comb my hair in the shower with BWC Conditioner, gently towel dry and then apply a finger full of this product and finger comb through and let air dry.  I end up having NO FRIZZ and lovely soft ringlets.  Did I mention how happy I am with my hair?  I bought this at Rite-Aid but will order from Amazon when I run out.</li>
    <li> Product smells great and makes my hair curly and moist. I mix this product with a heavier cream because my hair desires more moisture to be tamed. Overall great light product. Would recommend for 3am hair types</li>
    <li> This curl enhancing yogurt provides a light fragrant moisturizer to seal ends and hydrate natural styles without weighing it down. It is also excellent for twist outs, two strand twists, and roller sets.

    <li> I ordered this product for a family member and it worked so good that I had to order them another one great product</li>
    <li> I have REALLY dry hair and this moisturizes very effectively. My hair is touchably soft after using this as part of my wash and go routine. It has a subtle nutty scent, nothing special but it doesn&#x27;t bother me. My hair is not crunchy but it is still very well defined when using this cream. The application of the cream is great because it has the consistency of whipped butter and distributes evenly when you rub it between your palms. I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> This is the best curl product I have found so far. I have a young son who is mixed and has super soft curly hair I did not want to use any product in his hair that would leave it feeling crunchy. This hair yogurt leaves his hair soft and defines his curls plus it smells great. I have super strait long hair and I use it to smooth and soften my hair too.</li>
    <li> I like that this feels very moisturizing and it really does enhance your curls. But I wouldn&#x27;t use it everyday because I feel it is too oily so a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> This leaves my hair so soft and lovely smelling. It doesn&#x27;t leave my curls crunchy or heavy or overly greasy. I love this and I would order it again.</li>
    <li> Love this. Package came quickly and perfectly. Curl cream is not heavy and doesn&#x27;t make your hair sticky. I have medium length, semi thick hair and I use about a quarter size after toweling drying my hair. Great smell too! Will definitely continue to buy from here.</li>
    <li> I started using this product on my loose natural hair about 2 years ago as a moisturizer and not only did it moisturize my hair, it made it soft and smell soooooo good. My loose natural hair has been loc&#x27;d for a little over a year and this product still works the same on my hair. This is one of my staple hair products and if OGX ever decided to discontinue this product, I would be devastated!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t really care the product itself. I already have very curly hair so I need my curls to be &amp;#34;enhanced&amp;#34; and I can&#x27;t notice a difference in them even when I apply it it damp hair. But the company&#x27;s shipping was quick. . So that is always a plus</li>
    <li> I wear an Afro and have tried just about every product on the market for curly hair.&lt;br /&gt;I guess you could say I am a product whore.  I will not be without this product.&lt;br /&gt;It is moisturizing without being greasy and there is no build up.  Love it and recommend it to all my sisters with curly or coarse hair .</li>
    <li> I have naturally curly hair so this product is a must have.  It keeps my hair from being frizzy without making it gunky, crusty or weighing it down.  I used to get this product at Ulta 3 but they were out of it the last 3 times I went.  Finally I thought of checking Amazon.</li>
    <li> Oh I love the smell of this product I have heads turning n asking what&#x27;s that smell plus it really does enhance my curls.</li>
    <li> This is an okay purchase that I probably wont make again; this covers my hair and makes it heavy and the  is not worth the money.</li>
    <li> Great instant moisturizer for your scalp and shine for your hair, but not much curl affect/pattern on my 4A hair type,</li>
    <li> This works good for my very curly hair.  No frizz and smells great.  Doesn&#x27;t way my hair down.  Will buy again.</li>

It works better if I blow dry my hair, but I was really hoping for a product that would make my hair look a little neater without blow drying.  It does have a nice scent to it, though.  Just not good for my type of curls. I will continue my hunt for the perfect curl enhancing product...</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a year now. I have thick, medium length hair and only use a teaspoonful on wet hair. It makes hair noticeably more lustrous and doesn&#x27;t weigh it down, as long as I do not use too much. I had to experiment with the amount before I found my perfect match. I wanted to find a product that I could use after cleansing with Wen, instead of using more Wen after showering, which seems to be necessary to get the full effect.&lt;br /&gt;If you have wavy or curly hair, try using this after your shower and then going to bed with your slightly damp. You will find that you wake up with beautiful body and shine. I think it&#x27;s due to the humidity produced from your body heat.&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t seem to find it on the shelves any more, and I panicked. I have this on auto-renew with Amazon every 6 months.</li>
    <li> Eh... It&#x27;s OK. It provides moisture but I wouldn&#x27;t say it&#x27;s specifically for curls. It didn&#x27;t enhance my curls in any way. Wouldn&#x27;t buy again.</li>
    <li> It is a great moisturizer and creates light fluffy curls that aren&#x27;t weighed down. This product is a great for black hair and short curly hair styles</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been searching for this product for weeks since first seeing it online. Finally found it locally at RiteAid and wasn&#x27;t disappointed.  It&#x27;s a fit-for-a-queen moisture treat for my 3b/c/4a curls. I&#x27;m glad I picked up the last 2 jars on the shelf. Will definitely be using this on the regular.</li>
    <li> So, I ordered this because I make a DIY whipped shea butter cream with argan oil so I thought I might be able to use this when I run out and I don&#x27;t have immediate time to make more.  NOT!  This has the consistency of lotion or a thin body cream.  So, I started using it for just that since it has a wonderful smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not worth ordering for natural 4b/4c hair.  Might work on 3a/b or 4a.</li>
    <li> This &amp;#34;curl enhancing&amp;#34; yogurt did NOT live up to its name. My curls were not defined after using this product nor did my DRY hair feel moisturized. I like a lot of OGX&#x27;s products, but this is not one I will re-order.</li>
