      <li>sure what the deal is</li>
      <li>this is filled  by their own home made solution... smells like Armani...</li>
      <li>br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Armani, please bring back the magic!!!</li>
      <li>Absolutely original!</li>
      <li>Classic scent, suitable for the office meeting or an elegant evening out.</li>
      <li>almost as if it were not the genuine thing</li>
      <li>/&gt;Cologne itself smells different and the scent is not as strong as original ARMANI!!!</li>
      <li>The scent is nowhere like the original.</li>
      <li>woodsy and clean fragrance.</li>
      <li>Or the toilet weaker nice but not the original you love so much&lt;</li>
      <li>use frequently specially  on nights&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Just to let ya all no armani us all love so much is over theyvstarted production on 1983,</li>

      <li>Thank you for getting it here so quickly.</li>
      <li>Always sensual and a real classic!</li>
      <li>love this since 1993, old is gold.</li>
      <li>It appears that Armani decided to update and significantly change the Armani cologne and the new version is TERRIBLE!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I have been wearing this Armani trademark cologne for 30 years since it first came out.</li>
      <li>It is arguably my favorite cologne of all time, but the product that showed up was NOT the same.</li>
      <li>There is NO indication in the description that this is NOT the genuine article, and the name is exactly the same as the original.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It looks very much like the original Giorgio Armani Eau de Toilette Spray for Men, BUT it is NOT the same fragrance.  </li>
      <li>thanks</li>
      <li>this time we ordered this one through Amazon I am very disippointed</li>
      <li>this is  one of the fragances I really like&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I really like it a lot.</li>
      <li>So if somebody from Armani reads, this, please bring back the original.</li>
      <li>ordered it, because the picture that you show here, is the same that I using for more that 5 years, but, is completely different fragrance, I don&#x27;t understand why you don&#x27;t show the real bottle that you send to customers.&lt;br</li>
      <li>the NEW Coke v. Coke CLASSIC</li>
      <li>I have always enjoyed this product, which is getting more difficult to find, because the manufacturer is starting to change the formula.</li>
      <li>no, black as you show.</li>
      <li>/&gt;I was extremely disappointed after having bought six (yes 6!) bottles as a gift for my husband who loved the original fragrance.  </li>
      <li>Be careful of substitute which has new or nuit on box.</li>

<li> /&gt;I was extremely disappointed after having bought six (yes 6!) bottles as a gift for my husband who loved the original fragrance.  </li>
<li> Be careful of substitute which has new or nuit on box.</li>
<li> Also, the new bottle is a little bit narrower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> fragrance is so weak that I suspect that either this bottle is very old or possibly counterfeit.</li>
<li> The bottle design changed, and it looks similar, but the bottom and the cap are now silver and black instead of black and gold.</li>
<li> after doing some research , the actual issue is that the Armani I got and others did, is a different item , Amazon for some reason delivered the wrong item.&lt;br /&gt;There is Eau de toilet and there is Eau de Parfum , Armani makes both and</li>
<li> It would be like going to the store and buying a container of orange juice, and bringing it home and pouring it in a glass to find out there was sour milk in the Orange juice</li>
<li> It doesn&#x27;t have the black section in the bottom.&lt;br /&gt;Smells</li>
<li> I have previously ordered this product through another internet company, but, they were out of stock.</li>
<li> the base of the bottel is a silver one instead of a black unlike the picture, and it smells like a cheap cologne.</li>
<li> Not sure how anyone can buy something like this online</li>
<li> but this is hard to find in dept stores.  </li>
<li> /&gt;Secondly, it is so weak, you can&#x27;t even smell it a minute after you put it on!?!?!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> the worse thing is that I can return it.</li>
<li> This is much worse than the difference in-betwen</li>
<li> Armani decided to try and update their classic cologne, the outcome was an AWFUL MISTAKE.</li>
<li> and I reported that the item is a &amp;#34; Fake &amp;#34; , they gave me a refund since it is a &amp;#34; flammable &amp;#34; and cannot be returned.&lt;br /&gt;WELL  </li>
<li> How bad?</li>
<li> /&gt;i am disappointed that the after shave balm is now discontinued though.</li>
<li> received a bottle with silver color base</li>
<li> can&#x27;t even begin to communicate how disappointing this is !?!?!?!</li>

    <li> Smells soooooo-oo good. . . woodsy and clean fragrance.</li>
    <li> I have previously ordered this product through another internet company, but, they were out of stock. After receiving and using this product it just doesn&#x27;t seem to be as good .. almost as if it were not the genuine thing .. I&#x27;m not accusing anyone, just offering my opinion, however, I would not re-order this again.</li>
    <li> I got this one for my father for Chirstmas and he loves using it and this is favorite spray .</li>
    <li> My husband loves this fragrance and l was so happy to be able to get it quickly and at a great price.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this stuff for the last 20 years. Absolutely original!</li>
    <li> OMG! Armani decided to change the scent!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;Stop complaining and wear the cologne!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;Its fine!!! It smells really really good.</li>
    <li> I have always loved this scent for men.  Always sensual and a real classic! It always makes me turn to see who wears it when I smell it outside, somewhere.  Love it!</li>
    <li> This cologne is awesome!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for almost twenty years and I believe I know it well.&lt;br /&gt;The fragrance is so weak that I suspect that either this bottle is very old or possibly counterfeit.</li>
    <li> my husband has been using Armanie Eau de Toilette for years. this time we ordered this one through Amazon I am very disippointed it is not what we are used to. the base of the bottel is a silver one instead of a black unlike the picture, and it smells like a cheap cologne. I am disippionted. I don&#x27;t reccommend buying it through Amazon.</li>
    <li> DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM!  IT IS A SCAM!  It looks very much like the original Giorgio Armani Eau de Toilette Spray for Men, BUT it is NOT the same fragrance.  It is a KNOCKOFF!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was extremely disappointed after having bought six (yes 6!) bottles as a gift for my husband who loved the original fragrance.  There is NO indication in the description that this is NOT the genuine article, and the name is exactly the same as the original.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shame on Amazon for this scam.</li>
    <li> I ORDERED 3.4 OUNCE AND GOT 3.4 OUNCE</li>
    <li> I have been wearing this Armani trademark cologne for 30 years since it first came out. It is arguably my favorite cologne of all time, but the product that showed up was NOT the same. The bottle design changed, and it looks similar, but the bottom and the cap are now silver and black instead of black and gold. Also, the new bottle is a little bit narrower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know what happened? It appears that Armani decided to update and significantly change the Armani cologne and the new version is TERRIBLE!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all, it does NOT smell like the trademark Armani at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Secondly, it is so weak, you can&#x27;t even smell it a minute after you put it on!?!?!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If Armani decided to try and update their classic cologne, the outcome was an AWFUL MISTAKE. How bad? It would be like going to the store and buying a container of orange juice, and bringing it home and pouring it in a glass to find out there was sour milk in the Orange juice container!?!?!?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seriously, this is a HUGE MISTAKE!!! So if somebody from Armani reads, this, please bring back the original. This is much worse than the difference in-betwen the NEW Coke v. Coke CLASSIC fiasco.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t even begin to communicate how disappointing this is !?!?!?!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Armani, please bring back the magic!!!</li>
    <li> great smell, added to my collection to sprays for my self. looking for more deals to come my way. thanks</li>
    <li> What can I say, this has been my scent for years.  Use daytime and the noir nighttime.  Nice tingle after shaving, great (not overpowering) scent.  Not sure how anyone can buy something like this online but this is hard to find in dept stores.  I guess you can return it if no like.  I think a man will like this.</li>
    <li> love this since 1993, old is gold.</li>

    <li> Great smell&lt;br /&gt;This perfume&#x27; has a good smell.  It also has this freshness and it gives this feeling of cleaness.  I really like it a lot.</li>
    <li> I ordered this  item and what I got is what others got too, a different product with a silver bottom , smaller bottle and different smell .&lt;br /&gt;Called Customer care and I reported that the item is a &amp;#34; Fake &amp;#34; , they gave me a refund since it is a &amp;#34; flammable &amp;#34; and cannot be returned.&lt;br /&gt;WELL  after doing some research , the actual issue is that the Armani I got and others did, is a different item , Amazon for some reason delivered the wrong item.&lt;br /&gt;There is Eau de toilet and there is Eau de Parfum , Armani makes both and what we got is Eau de Parfum , which is totally different .&lt;br /&gt;item.</li>
    <li> The bottle is different than store bought! It doesn&#x27;t have the black section in the bottom.&lt;br /&gt;Smells the same&lt;br /&gt;Not sure what the deal is</li>
    <li> this is  one of the fragances I really like&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use frequently specially  on nights&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife also love it</li>
    <li> this is filled  by their own home made solution... smells like Armani... but it aint no armani...&lt;br /&gt;This is illeagal!</li>

    <li> I received a different fragrance whit a different bottle.&lt;br /&gt;I ordered it, because the picture that you show here, is the same that I using for more that 5 years, but, is completely different fragrance, I don&#x27;t understand why you don&#x27;t show the real bottle that you send to customers.&lt;br /&gt;I received a bottle with silver color base no, black as you show. I checked it in Macys and this is a different fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;but the worse thing is that I can return it. I lost $80.00 dollars</li>
