      <li>/&gt;The first time I ever tried argan oil I was some impressed and using EVAO is no different.</li>
      <li>It could maybe be I&#x27;m just using too much on my fine hair.</li>
      <li>/&gt;The first time I ever tried argan oil I was some impressed and using EVAO is no different.</li>

      <li>Very pleased and highly recommend.</li>
      <li>This is 100% pure organic extra virgin argan oil, which is the best.</li>
      <li>a huge multi-tasker.</li>
      <li>My daughter&#x27;s frizzy hair had become a huge fan of Argan oil.</li>
      <li>got this product free for review.</li>
      <li>/&gt;EVAO Argan oil glides on silky smooth</li>
      <li>It also keeps my hair shiny and smooth from fly-aways.  </li>
      <li>It has nutty light smell, it is not a perfume</li>
      <li>amber glass bottle to protect it from the light, with a glass dropper attached to the cap.  </li>
      <li>There has been no other lotions, creams or body butters that I have liked more than EVAO.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s ideal for combination skin because the skin will absorb just as much as it needs to, so dry areas will soak up more than oily areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Highly recommended for those looking for an amazing product.</li>
      <li>It is also great for helping healing dry skin patches and scabs</li>
      <li>Great for moisturizing dry skin.&lt;br /&gt;►</li>
      <li>oil is not only at a fair price, according to the manufacturer it is</li>
      <li>It is quickly absorbed by the skin, locking in moisture, leaving it smooth and moist, and not at all greasy.</li>
      <li>I am a blogger that states my true opinion.</li>
      <li>Your hair won&#x27;t get caught in it, it gives the perfect amount of shine, and your lips will never dry out or feel chapped afterwards (like with regular lip gloss).</li>
      <li>Overall I have fallen in love with this product I use it for so many things and have benefited from it</li>
      <li>It has so many uses, but two main things I use Argan Oil for is my hair and my skin.&lt;br</li>
      <li>cool thing about Argan oil is that it is so easy to apply but quickly diminishes into your skin and hydrates super fast - but the oily feeling will be gone within minutes.</li>
      <li>I found it to be good for skin and hair because it has more benefits than normal oils like olive or coconut, but it&#x27;s not as thick or oily so it&#x27;s easier to use and absorbs better.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It makes my skin soft and supple and helps keep acne at bay, and it also helps smooth out fine lines and wrinkles.</li>
      <li>However, thanks much to the reviewer who noted that they used more of the oil than suggested in the guidance, as I bumped up my treatment to three or four drops worked on my scalp, and then four or five worked through my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The items were securely placed into their boxes, (something you can&#x27;t say about most sellers), and it even came with bubble wrap, my ultimate distraction.</li>
      <li>and I had a job for it right away, having a case of the humid summer air frizzies.</li>
      <li>Right out of the package, I opened the bottle and smelled the oil.</li>
      <li>I love that this natural product is not irritating if maybe by accident I get something into my eyes</li>
      <li>I feel that this oil helped keep my hair soft as well and helped me easily comb through my hair as I uninstalled my hair.</li>
      <li>The end result is very soft and smooth.  </li>
      <li>Not only can you use it on everything from hair to feet, it&#x27;s appropriate for all skin types.  </li>
      <li>Out of the last 4 argan oils I&#x27;ve reviewed recently (this one included), this one definitely smells the best.</li>
      <li>This is actually much better than lotions such as Eucerin.</li>
      <li>First and foremost, I must inform you that I was sent this product to review.</li>
      <li>This is actually much better than lotions such as Eucerin.</li>
      <li>I absolutely love this Extra Virgin Argan oil.</li>
      <li>Firstly, I&#x27;d like to say that I have other items from this company, and they are all amazing.</li>
      <li>Trade certified means workers get a fair wage and are justly compensated for the work they do, empowering not only people but entire communities.&lt;br</li>
      <li>A few drops added to skin moisturizer under makeup produces a silky finish, and a drop or two on clean skin before bed will have you waking up to a really healthy looking</li>
      <li>She said many of her clients get dry hair from wearing hats in the winter.</li>
      <li>The pure oil smells nutty.  </li>
      <li>It is very important to store in a dark cool place and out of direct sunlight.  </li>
      <li>Very cool.&lt;br</li>
      <li>There really isn’t any packaging save a bubble wrap sleeve to keep the bottle from damaging.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> My daughter-in-law is a big fan of argan oil because she uses it for her hair. Believe you me, that woman has beautiful hair without having to resort to any expensive treatments. My preferred use for argan oil is to take just a small drop, put it on my skin, and rub it in. It doesn’t take much at all because just a tiny drop goes a long way to restoring flaky skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EVAO Moroccan argan oil, a 100% organic extra virgin oil, comes in a brown glass bottle, something I definitely appreciate. I know that when I purchase coconut oil, it’s annoying to find it comes in a plastic container. Undoubtedly, the packaging was given consideration, especially to those who want or need organic products. There really isn’t any packaging save a bubble wrap sleeve to keep the bottle from damaging. Many will appreciate this eco-friendly approach.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those who do want to know, organic Argan oil should have zero sulfates (SLS), diethanolamine (DEA), chemical dyes, chemical preservatives parabens, benzethonium chloride, trielosan, etc., or artificial fragrances. There really isn’t any fragrance, something that the fragrance-free aficionados will like. The tinted brown oil bottle is an excellent storage container that will aid in the shelf life. The EVAO should last a couple of years, but is not marked as such.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FEATURES:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;► EVAO Extra Virgin Argan Oil&lt;br /&gt;► 100% Organic. USDA Organic. EcoCert Organic.&lt;br /&gt;► Nothing added or subtracted. Cold Pressed to preserve natural vitamins.&lt;br /&gt;► Ideal for adding shine and manageability to hair. Great for moisturizing dry skin.&lt;br /&gt;► Produced by a cooperative of Moroccan Berber women. Fair Trade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are several uses for argan oil, but I’ve been using it a while now and it’s perfect for dry skin. I have a bottle of argan oil on my desk to get rid dried-out look on my skin which it inevitably manages to get during the winter months. Just one single squirt is enough to cover my entire forearm and hand. That flaky look instantly goes away, soothing my skin and making it supple and soft. This is something that lotions don’t seem to take care of. Even if I wash, there is enough oil left on the skin to keep it looking nice. Water will simply bead off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first time I ever tried argan oil I was some impressed and using EVAO is no different. The cost of the oil may seem quite expensive, but if you think of how much lotion you might go through trying to moisturize, in comparison it’s not. This is a skin-saving oil and very little is needed. I just use a couple of drops as opposed to at least a half dollar sized dollop of lotion and get better results. This is actually much better than lotions such as Eucerin. I actually keep a bottle of arganl on my desk for when my hands are really dry. EVAO has an internal medicine dropper for use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sample provided for reviewmy entire forearm and hand.

    <li> My daughter&#x27;s frizzy hair had become a huge fan of Argan oil. She puts a little on and brushes it through. It does make a difference in helping to make it smoother and softer. So a word about this particular Argan oil. It is great. Having it extra virgin makes for a high quality oil and means that you only need a small amount. It smells a little nutty. But Argan oil can be used for other areas as well including dry elbows and other dry winter patches. It helps that it comes in a dark, glass bottle. Oil can go rancid if exposed to the sun so the packaging will help to prolong the shelf life. Sample provided for testing.</li>
    <li> I use to use oil of olay but I now use this instead it leaves my face feeling soft and not greasy</li>
    <li> I just recently started using Argan oil and I wish it didn&#x27;t take me so long to try it. This oil has done wonders for my dry skin and brittle nails. My nails have never been so healthy,shiny,and strong. I also have less peeling and breakage. I use it in my hair as well. It makes my hair soft and shiny but I only apply it in my hair at night because it makes it look greasy. It could maybe be I&#x27;m just using too much on my fine hair. It also works great as a moisturizer it absorbs quickly, and does not leave an oily residue. This is definitely a great all natural versatile product to add to your beauty routine. Overall I have fallen in love with this product I use it for so many things and have benefited from it greatly.&lt;br /&gt;I received a sample of this product for test and review purposes with no restrictions on the review outcome.</li>
    <li> First and foremost, I must inform you that I was sent this product to review. That doesn&#x27;t affect my review or experience with the product at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am an African American woman with relaxed hair. Typically, when protective styling, my scalp tends to itch and get dry. When I received this oil, I was excited to test it out; I&#x27;m a sucker for new oils. This isn&#x27;t my first rodeo with Argan oil, so I had a little bit of an idea of how it could make my hair and scalp feel. Right out of the package, I opened the bottle and smelled the oil. Unlike another brand of Argan oil I tried, this did not smell like garbage or vomit. It just smelled like oil, which I was happy about. The dropper bottle was perfect for me because I had crochet braids installed at the time of testing, and it was easy for me (or my fiancé) to apply this to my scalp and massage in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found that this oil really kept my scalp from feeling dry and helped seal in any moisture I applied to my scalp. I feel that this oil helped keep my hair soft as well and helped me easily comb through my hair as I uninstalled my hair. I have recently began to use this oil as a hand/cuticle oil after I wash my hands, or push back my cuticles. My hands feel like silk after using this product, and I truly love it more for my hands than my hair. This is a definite purchase for me after I finish out my review bottle. It is an oil I would love to keep on hand.</li>
    <li> After using this Argan Oil for about one month now, I can say that I like it and would recommend it to others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first I saw no major impact other than a more tangle-free after shower combing experience, and less fly-away frizzies. However, thanks much to the reviewer who noted that they used more of the oil than suggested in the guidance, as I bumped up my treatment to three or four drops worked on my scalp, and then four or five worked through my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That did the trick for me, increasing sheen while not feeling oily or greasy and still providing the tangle-free and less frizzy experience too. I did receive this oil gratis from the seller and have put it to use for several weeks in order to objectively test its effect on my hair. My statements here reflect that testing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for an Argon Oil, or just seeking a product to use for the effects that I noted above, then I would recommend this product to you based on my experience with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Go for it.</li>
    <li> I really love Argan Oil. This stuff works wonders on my dry forehead in the winter. I love it for stray hairs to. It also helped clear up my son&#x27;s eczema spot on his back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got this product free for review. I am a blogger that states my true opinion.</li>
    <li> This oil really delivers, a little goes a very long way. I put a couple of drops of this into my favorite conditioner and it works great with no oily residue. I&#x27;ve also been using it after pedicures to prevent cracked skin and Im very happy with the results. Will definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> This is the best and purest Argan Oil I have tried. It has so many uses, but two main things I use Argan Oil for is my hair and my skin.&lt;br /&gt;It makes my skin soft and supple and helps keep acne at bay, and it also helps smooth out fine lines and wrinkles. It makes your hair super soft and silky, you can use it as a deep conditioning treatment, or overnight if your hair is super dry I also have put a few drops of Argan Oil in my favorite conditioner.</li>
    <li> This is a MUST have beauty staple for any beauty mavens out there. It does wonders on dry, cracked feet and dry elbows too. There has been no other lotions, creams or body butters that I have liked more than EVAO. I especially love how this oil soothes psoriasis on my scalp and body. EVAO is good for you… and good for the environment. I highly recommend this product, especially for those of you who suffer with extremely dry skin. A little goes a long way!</li>
    <li> Really a nice quality argan oil, one of the better oils I have seen in some time. I like the Fair Trade with a women&#x27;s cooperative, something I use for health and beauty is even better when I know that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received my sample to review and I had a job for it right away, having a case of the humid summer air frizzies. Just a little in hand helped to calm down the hair nicely without weighing it down. My hands were apparently thirsty as well, with the oil soaking in quickly and not leaving me greasy.</li>
    <li> Though I was a little apprehensive about using this, I was very impressed at what argan oil can do.  I have very dry skin, especially in the winter, and this really helps me with that and had the effects were fast and striking.  The fact that it&#x27;s sold at a very reasonable price makes it even more appealing.  Highly recommended for those looking for an amazing product.</li>
    <li> Argan oil is AMAZING! It&#x27;s my liquid gold. I would bathe in argan oil if I could. This is 100% pure organic extra virgin argan oil, which is the best. It is also in a dark bottle, which is a must. And it doesn&#x27;t have a heavy smell and what is there, I like. Out of the last 4 argan oils I&#x27;ve reviewed recently (this one included), this one definitely smells the best. And it works wonderfully. I use argan oil in my hair, on my skin, on my nails and cuticles, on my face (all the time), and I LOVE using it as a shiny lip gloss. Your hair won&#x27;t get caught in it, it gives the perfect amount of shine, and your lips will never dry out or feel chapped afterwards (like with regular lip gloss). I also love braiding my hair at night and then putting argan oil through the braid. In the morning, your hair has a nice wave and it&#x27;s really made a difference in my hair over time.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this Extra Virgin Argan oil. I love that it is 100% USDA Organic. Since I received this, I have used it for my skin, and my hair. I can say for someone that has extreme dry skin, and eczema this Argan oil is very affective. My skin feels like silk. This being an oil I was a little skeptical, because i thought my hands would be extremely oily after applying. To my surprise this oil absorbed  quickly, leaving my skin extremely silky smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have applied the Argan oil to my hair while wet, an let my hair dry naturally and boy does my hair feel amazing. Silky and shiny. I love it. I have been struggling with my hair being very dull lately. This oil has brought a lot of life back into my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can say I am very satisfied, and I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Argan  Oil really is a one-size-fits-all product.  Not only can you use it on everything from hair to feet, it&#x27;s appropriate for all skin types.  It&#x27;s ideal for combination skin because the skin will absorb just as much as it needs to, so dry areas will soak up more than oily areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using various types of argan oil for several years and it&#x27;s a product I never want to be without. The labels on my other products just say \\&quot;argan oil\\&quot; on the packaging, and they smell flowery.  This is an added fragrance that sometimes causes a skin reaction.  The pure oil smells nutty.  The ISA EVAO Extra Virgin Argan Oil has no additives.  It&#x27;s the real deal.  The USDA says so.  And, it smells nutty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A tiny bit goes a very long way.  I put a few drops on my palms and run them through my hair before blow drying or using a heated styling appliance.  The end result is very soft and smooth.  A few drops added to skin moisturizer under makeup produces a silky finish, and a drop or two on clean skin before bed will have you waking up to a really healthy looking face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re interested in Fair Trade practices, ISA is too.  Their Argan Oil is purchased from small cooperatives, so you can rest assured that your great hair and skin isn&#x27;t the result of exploiting third world workers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sample provided for review.</li>
    <li> Argan oil and argan oil products are expensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This oil is not only at a fair price, according to the manufacturer it is Fair Trade.&lt;br /&gt;Fair Trade certified means workers get a fair wage and are justly compensated for the work they do, empowering not only people but entire communities.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s amazing what argan oil can do. Used as is, it is wonderful as a pre-wash conditioner. A drop or two on the feet nourishes and helps heal chapped, cracked heels. Mix it with a little rose hip seed oil and some emu oil and it makes the best hand and foot oil ever.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a huge multi-tasker. From head to toe, on skin or hair. Add a few drops to bath water. Alone or with a drop of avocado oil added, it makes a perfect after shower oil, especially in winter. I even mix it in with my foundation when my face is dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cold pressing of this oil helps it to retain all the nutrients, all the essential fatty acids, so important in body care. As with all oils, argan oil is going to last longer if kept away from heat. The refrigerator is best. You can easily decant some into a small container to keep by the rest of your skin care products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sample size was provided for testing and review.</li>
    <li> As soon as I looked at the bottle and smelled it I knew it was authentic.  In order for Argan oil to keeps it&#x27;s effectiveness it should be bottled in amber or blue glass bottles.  It will have a slight nutty aroma, but never like flowers because that is a sign a fragrance additive has been added.  If it smells awful or has a strong foul odor than it probably has gone rancid.  Believe it or not Argan oil has a shelf life.  Since this is an organic Aragan Oil, it has a shelf life of 12 months after opening.  It is very important to store in a dark cool place and out of direct sunlight.  I actually keep mine in my mini refrigerator/water cooler in my bedroom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You are probably wondering why I know some much about Argan Oil - I have been using it for years and years.  I regularly use Argan Oil in my hair and face.  By using it in my hair it protects against damaged caused by my blow dryer and flat iron.  It also keeps my hair shiny and smooth from fly-aways.  It helps eliminates frizz and leaves hair more manageable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In regards to my face, I give myself a micro needle skin treatment on my face about twice a week.  After rolling 540 tiny needles over my face, I apply the EVAO Argan Oil over my face for a deep moisturizing since I have millions of new little holes in my face.  It is also great for helping healing dry skin patches and scabs quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EVAO Argan oil glides on silky smooth and once you realize how wonderful the benefits are on your hair and skin you too will be addicted and calling it liquid gold because it is priceless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Review sample.</li>
    <li> The oil is excellent. Well packaged. Had no skin issues.  Sample was provided to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Per wiki, Argan Oil has several use cases. Unroasted argan oil is traditionally used as a treatment for skin diseases and as a cosmetic oil for skin and hair: &amp;#34;In cosmetics, argan oil is advocated as moisturizing oil, against juvenile acne and flaking of the skin as well as for nourishing the hair. This oil has also medicinal uses against rheumatism and the healing of burns ... Externally, argan oil is used ... for hair as brilliantine, to fortify and ... in the treatment of wrinkled or scaly dry skin&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Gave a couple away as gifts and they are a hit!</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:3bae73ae7bf68cfcfa755297b880db9f]]I began using argan on regular basis after my hairdresser recommended that I start using it in my hair because she noticed that the hair on on top of my hair felt dry. She called it \\&quot;hat hair\\&quot;. She said many of her clients get dry hair from wearing hats in the winter. A few drops does not make the hair look or feel greasy. My hairdresser said it can be applied to dry hair or wet hair with the same effectiveness. The key is not to apply too much not have a greasy hair look. On my next appointment she said she could see the difference that the hair felt better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EVAO argan oil comes in a 2 oz bottle with a glass droplet applicator. It has nutty light smell, it is not a perfume scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried bottles with different applicators: spray bottles and bottle with droplets. I prefer droplet applicators because they gives me more control than the spray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This argan oil provided by ISA Professional.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ali Julia review</li>
    <li> Love this EVAO argan oil. It&#x27;s full of naturally occurring vitamins and is very good for both hair and skin. The first thing you notice is that the bottle is solid glass and has a pretty sticker of a gold tree on it. The production date is stamped on the side of the bottle and it&#x27;s made in small batches so the one I bought in January was only made in Dcember, so only 1 month from berber women to me. Very cool.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The oil inside is fair trade and smells light and nutty. After using other brands of argan oils that have fillers and perfume added to it, it&#x27;s cool to have this one which is pure. I have very sensitive skin and some eczema and I have not found any problems using this oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The manufacturer says that a little goes a long way, and that is true, but I use lots of it. I put about half a dropper full in my hair every other day, it seems to last so that I don&#x27;t need to use it every day. Once a week I do a deep conditioning treatment where you put enough in your hair until it looks greasy and then let it soak in for about half an hour or more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin is softer and my hair is shinier and healthier. Very pleased and highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Excellent product.  I use it morning and night on my face!</li>
    <li> It is always a pleasure to open a fresh bottle of pure argan oil and inhale the complex fragrance, which is sweet, nutty, and earthy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This organic argan oil from ISA Professional is cold-pressed from the kernel of the seed of the fruit of the Argania spinosa tree, which is native to the semi-arid valleys of Morocco, so it retains all of the fragrance as well as the natural pale straw color.  Berber women cooperatively gather the fruit from the and extract the oil through a process that has evolved over the centuries.  They use it for cooking and to support their families through fair-trade sale.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The oil is presented in a 2 oz. amber glass bottle to protect it from the light, with a glass dropper attached to the cap.  The label displays a golden argan tree, echoing the pale gold of the liquid inside.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just a few drops of argan oil conditions the skin, nails, cuticles, or hair.  It is quickly absorbed by the skin, locking in moisture, leaving it smooth and moist, and not at all greasy. It is especially beneficial for heat-treated or damaged hair, giving it a beautiful sheen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ISA Professional provided argan oil for evaluation and review.</li>
    <li> Would have written a review earlier, but as a warning this is a thorough review of not only the product but supplier. Firstly, I&#x27;d like to say that I have other items from this company, and they are all amazing. Each of the items I received were all professionally packaged. The items were securely placed into their boxes, (something you can&#x27;t say about most sellers), and it even came with bubble wrap, my ultimate distraction. There were no &amp;#34;dings&amp;#34; or bends on any of the products and no broken glass either.&lt;br /&gt;Now for the Argon oil itself, at first I thought it would be a gimmick, you know the ordinary try this it&#x27;s amazing but turns out to be completely useless, NO IT WASNT!! This was 100% PURE ORGANIC COLD PRESSED Argon oil. I&#x27;ve been attempting to grow my hair back out from its short wrap, but I could not give up flat ironing. This actually kept my hair soft after applying heat, I now use it on a daily basis! My hair has been getting stronger and fuller and has rid of its dull disposition, another hint, THIS IS VERSATILE! It moisturizer the skin and grows eyebrows and lashes when applied as a serum! pictures will be uploaded soon including before and afters using these products.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product on my hair to keep it healthy and de-winterized.  After showering, I put a few drops in my hand, rub my hands together, and work through my damp hair.  I also massage it into my scalp.  After using this product for a few weeks, I feel as if my hair and scalp have added moisture without appearing to be greasy.&lt;br /&gt;ISA Professional provided this product to evaluate and review.</li>
    <li> I am a lover of Argan oil. You can use Argan oil on your hair or your skin. Because my eye area is really dry I love to pat the EVAO Argan oil on my eyes. I love that this natural product is not irritating if maybe by accident I get something into my eyes (my eyes are very sensitive).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cool thing about Argan oil is that it is so easy to apply but quickly diminishes into your skin and hydrates super fast - but the oily feeling will be gone within minutes. Be aware that a cold pressed Argan oil has a &amp;#34;natural plant based&amp;#34; scent to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you add Argan oil to your hair (only on the ends!) it will give you gorgeous shine.</li>
    <li> How can one little bottle do so much?? The EVAO Argan oil is a must for any girl. The benefits of Argan Oil is unlimited from hair, scalp, face, body, and nails.I found it to be good for skin and hair because it has more benefits than normal oils like olive or coconut, but it&#x27;s not as thick or oily so it&#x27;s easier to use and absorbs better.</li>
