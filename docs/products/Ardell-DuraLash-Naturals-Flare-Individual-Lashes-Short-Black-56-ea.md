      <li>I just make sure to grasp all of the lashes in each flare with tweezers before I pick the glue off with my fingers.  </li>
      <li>I have used these along my whole eye and they look great.  </li>
      <li>I guess I love them because I keep buying them.</li>
      <li>These are okay.</li>
      <li>I seem to lose one or two lash clusters in the shower, so I plan on touching up my lashes while putting on my makeup&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s something I am doing</li>
      <li>I love that there is not a &amp;#34;lump&amp;#34; at the rott, so they don&#x27;t look goopy once on the eye..</li>
      <li>I remove by placing a cotton pad soaked in an oil- or silicon-based eye remover on top of my lashes.  </li>
      <li>Been wearing these for MANY years and they are cheaper on amazon then when I buy them at a store.</li>
      <li>Nice and light lashes.</li>
      <li>I absolutely love these and order multiples now whenever I place an order:)</li>
      <li>Much better than the ones with knots.</li>
      <li>HIGHLY recommended!!!!!</li>
      <li>This is a super good deal for these lashes and it was delivered extremely quick!</li>
      <li>She kept saying how lucky I was to have nice lashes, and how cheated she felt.  </li>
      <li>These were fairly easy to put on.  </li>
      <li>, I can easily pull it off.  </li>
      <li>The reason I wear and remove each day is I like to set my own eyelashes first by curling, lining the waterline and in between each lash, mascara, and comb through.  </li>
      <li>I liked them so much that I ordered them again.</li>
      <li>These are knot free but the glue used to glue the lashes together are sometimes in clumps.</li>
      <li>if you buy the individual lash glue from Ardell, make sure to buy the remover too!!</li>
      <li>The short lashes are the perfect length, make me look normal</li>
      <li>Moving the lash clump to spread the glue along the adjoining lashes first helps the cluster bond to the neighboring lashes, plus it makes them look darker and blend better.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s nice to have just one product in creating many different looks.&lt;br</li>
      <li>/&gt;These lashes are much more natural looking than many others.  </li>
      <li>I have time to reposition and make sure they lay next to my own lashes before the glue dries.  </li>
      <li>These lashes came right off!  </li>
      <li>It is very sticky, and some packages seem to have more than others.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure they would look like real eye lashes.  </li>
      <li>didn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I went out and bought a good lighted magnifying mirror and \\&quot;flat tweezers.\\&quot;  </li>
      <li>I make sure the tweezers are clean before each new clump is applied.  </li>
      <li>much more realistic look than with the knotted ones.</li>
      <li>Pro: came quickly, looked like photo...</li>
      <li>I love this product and with a steady hand, a magnifying mirror and some practice, you will too.</li>
      <li>If you use good glue (I like Ardell clear better than any of the Duo because it lasts longer) and avoid rubbing your eyes &amp; using lots of eye makeup, they should last about a week.&lt;br /&gt;4.</li>
      <li>I have a pair of needle nosed looking tweezers, which makes it pretty easy to get the lashes right where I want them.  </li>
      <li>If it looks ok in that high power mirror, it will look amazing to the naked eye.  </li>
      <li>i prefer using the Ardell individual lash glue and am sure my lashes won&#x27;t fall out and cause embarrassment!</li>
      <li>But for this exact brand and quantity, it&#x27;s sold at Target for $3.99!</li>
      <li>I love using the indvidual lashes because they are so natural looking</li>
      <li>you&#x27;ll pull your own lashes out at the same time.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m all about looking as naturally beautiful as possible, and these things really do look natural.</li>
      <li>Found these to be a bit fiddle to put on ,but got it right in the end.</li>
      <li>I then learned if I applied them under on my own lashes instead on top of my lashes, using very little glue</li>
      <li>The best thing about this brand is that they come in short-- which means long for those of us with normal lashes.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t have time to go get my lashes extended as frequently as I need to, due to my rorating work schedule, so I decided to learn this magical skill on my own.</li>
      <li>wear these for one day only, clean the lashes, and reapply the lashes that are in good condition at a later day.  </li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t tried very many other kinds, but for the price, these are exactly what I need.</li>
      <li>I will know better next time.</li>
      <li>And I use a pretty permanent glue.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> the glue is really bad. It goes from clear to a frosty color after you get it wet. I waited 72 hours before getting them wet but that didn&#x27;t help. Now I have 3 boxes I won&#x27;t use.</li>
    <li> I am looking forward to using these. I have used lashes that are one piece but not individual like these. I like the fact they are.</li>
    <li> First... it is four packages - someone was mad they only rec&#x27;d one (so contact customer service ninny).  I don&#x27;t wear a lot of make-up - these were a bit too long for my taste; I&#x27;ll be trimming them down.  Next time I&#x27;ll order mini&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> These are nice, with no bulgy knot at the base, but they&#x27;re a little tricky to work with. Getting them out of their little wells can be a nightmare. If you don&#x27;t get all of the lashes in the bundle together, at the base, you can either lose a few lashes or warp the whole bundle. That can be a real pain. Also even without the knot, a lot of them have a little piece of white glue holding them together which is visible against your natural lashes. You have to very carefully peel or trim the excess glue off before applying it to your lashes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re new to applying individual lashes, keep in mind a few things:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Use a magnifying mirror&lt;br /&gt;2. Don&#x27;t put the lashes on your eyelid, you&#x27;re gluing them to the lashes you&#x27;ve already got&lt;br /&gt;3. How long the lashes last depends entirely on what kind of glue you use, and how rough you are with your eyes. If you use good glue (I like Ardell clear better than any of the Duo because it lasts longer) and avoid rubbing your eyes &amp; using lots of eye makeup, they should last about a week.&lt;br /&gt;4. Don&#x27;t pull them off. Use remover &amp; gently wash them, if you pull them you&#x27;ll pull out your natural lashes &amp; they take a LONG time to grow back.&lt;br /&gt;5. Be patient. You&#x27;ll figure out your best way of doing it, and what works for you, but you&#x27;ve gotta breathe easy &amp; take your time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I&#x27;m happy with these. I haven&#x27;t tried very many other kinds, but for the price, these are exactly what I need.</li>
    <li> Great deal! Nice and light lashes.</li>
    <li> I love Ardell eyelashes! I didn&#x27;t have time to go get my lashes extended as frequently as I need to, due to my rorating work schedule, so I decided to learn this magical skill on my own. This id the perfect legnth for anyone trying extentions for the first time. I actually use the short ones up to the muddle of my eye from the nose out and use medium legnths to fill the rest, with two to three long ones at the end. Love these!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried lots of different lashes, and these are my favorites.  I&#x27;m blonde, which seems to come with very stubby and almost colorless eyelashes, so augmenting my sad little natural lashes seems the most sensible route for me.  I&#x27;ve used strip lashes too, but they don&#x27;t look very natural on me.  These Ardell lashes look like I grew them myself- almost.  I was recently at the dentist, with my mouth hanging open, and my dentist&#x27;s assistant (wearing magnifying glasses) was complaining about her crummy lashes.  She kept saying how lucky I was to have nice lashes, and how cheated she felt.  When I finally was able to talk I told her that they were individual clusters - fake lashes.  She took another look through her magnifiers and still had trouble seeing them, even with my eyes closed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After months of trying different combos of adhesive and lashes, I&#x27;ve found that these Ardell Duralash Naturals in short black, with their lack of a knot at the bottom work the best for me, especially when I use Ardell Lashtite Adhesive in dark.  I bought the larger 3/4 oz bottle two months ago ($5.92 here on Amazon inc shipping with amazon prime), and have barely made a dent in it. No problems with it getting gummy or drying out in the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These lashes are much more natural looking than many others.  They are soft to the touch, have a nice natural shape, and are not a harsh black like some others I&#x27;ve tried.  I&#x27;ve tried different lengths, and I&#x27;m happiest with the short.  I don&#x27;t want to look like I&#x27;m wearing fake lashes!  I almost always wear lashes, occasionally taking a break from them for a week or two (and wearing strip lashes during that time).  A fresh set of these lashes will last for three or four weeks, with minimal maintenance.  I seem to sleep primarily on my left side, so my left eye&#x27;s lashes needs a little more maintenance after being smooshed into the pillow all night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While showering, I use normal bar soap (Caress) to wash my face, using my fingers to gently wash my eyelids and lashes.  I don&#x27;t dry my eyes with a towel- I airdry.  This makes a difference in how long the lashes stay on.  I avoid anything greasy or oily around my eyes, as it makes the adhesive fail (good to know if you want to get them off).  Don&#x27;t try to remove these lashes by pulling or scraping with your fingernail- you&#x27;ll pull your own lashes out at the same time.  I know that from experience.  I seem to lose one or two lash clusters in the shower, so I plan on touching up my lashes while putting on my makeup&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use a 12x magnifying mirror with a bright reading light to apply my lashes.  If it looks ok in that high power mirror, it will look amazing to the naked eye.  I have a pair of needle nosed looking tweezers, which makes it pretty easy to get the lashes right where I want them.  I put a drop of adhesive on a little piece of foil, or in one of the empty little wells in the lash container (where the lashes used to be), dip the end of the lash into the glue and rub the inner part of the lash off on the edge of the container.  I don&#x27;t want globs of dried glue at the base of my lashes.  I try to get each lash cluster in between my own lashes, not just laying on the top as the instructions state.  Moving the lash clump to spread the glue along the adjoining lashes first helps the cluster bond to the neighboring lashes, plus it makes them look darker and blend better.  The trick is to have the lashes glued to your own lashes, not your eyelid.  Using a high power magnifying mirror makes this much easier! I use the handle end of the tweezers to support the lashes for a few seconds to allow the glue to setup.  If for whatever reason the clump doesn&#x27;t stick, I wipe the old glue off, redip into fresh glue, and try again.  I make sure the tweezers are clean before each new clump is applied.  I probably have to replace two or three clumps of lashes each morning, which just takes a few minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing that bugs me about all lashes is the adhesive that the companies use to keep the lashes in the plastic packaging.  It is very sticky, and some packages seem to have more than others.  I always check the base of the lashes after removing from the pack to take off any extra goopy glue before I put the lash glue on.  I use my fingernail to scrape off the little ball of goop.  I don&#x27;t need extra goop at the base of my lashes either!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once the lashes are on, I wait about five minutes to put on my eye makeup.  I use soap and water removeable products because waterproof products require oily remover, which will take the lashes off too.  I&#x27;ve had good luck with liquid and pencil eyeliner, and I like to use a small eyeliner brush with dark (black/brown) loose eyeshadow powder to fill in the base of my lashes to make the lashes undetectable.  I use black mascara (just a little) to blend my lashes into the fake lashes, and I&#x27;ve had the best luck using a lengthening mascara (like Illegal Lengths from Maybelline) rather than a volumizing formula, which looks too thick and messy on me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a learning curve to using these lashes!  I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t give up after trying them the first couple times, because they are wonderful when you get accustomed to applying them.  Watching a few videos on youtube helped too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now that I&#x27;m so happy with these lashes, I&#x27;ve subscribed with amazon to have them automatically sent every two months.  I can&#x27;t find them any cheaper in a store, and pack of four is perfect!  I save an extra 15% this way, and don&#x27;t have to worry about running out.</li>
    <li> Since that other review is useless, I&#x27;ll put in my 2-cents.   I friggin&#x27; love these things! I&#x27;m all about looking as naturally beautiful as possible, and these things really do look natural. When I put them on the first night after cleaning my face, my BF thought I was wearing makeup because my eyes looked so pretty.    I&#x27;m new to falsies and after having some bad (read: horrible) experiences with strip lashes, I decided to give individuals a try. Ardell makes a very natural-looking, sturdy lash that holds up to newbies like myself. I believe they are made of real human hair, so they don&#x27;t have that weird plastic sheen to them.     They are pretty tricky to apply, but once you get the hang of it, it will go must faster. A magnifying mirror helps a ton. If you have shaky hands like me, bracing your elbow against something like a table or the wall will help too.    Though the Ardell clear lash glue held very solidly (held on for several days until I took the lashes out), I found it to be a little irritating as well as too visible (it dried a little white). Right now I&#x27;m trying out DUO lash adhesive in black, which doesn&#x27;t hold strong enough and I doubt will last for more than a couple of days. Still searching.</li>
    <li> The eyelashes woiuld be great but, I can&#x27;t see to put them on.  They got some good reviews, so for people that doesn&#x27;t have eye problems they would be great. I&#x27;m sure they would look like real eye lashes.  The service was great and  would  order again from them.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you again,  I&#x27;m sorry they didn&#x27;t work for me.&lt;br /&gt;M.L.P</li>
    <li> Excellent shipment, on time delivery. This is just a bit confusing when it says (Pack of 4) I thought it would be four packs of these lashes but &amp;#34;pack of four&amp;#34; means (apparently) Rows of 4 lashes. I could have gotten this same product at a beauty store for less money. I thought I was getting a real deal but  otherwise I&#x27;m pleased. I will know better next time.</li>
    <li> It is a great product</li>
    <li> This is a super good deal for these lashes and it was delivered extremely quick! I can&#x27;t find short lashed anywhere and certainly not for this price! These go quite a long ways if you glue a few together and reuse them.</li>
    <li> I just love, love, love them!  First off, I have bad eyes and I was using a 3X unlighted magnifying mirror and still could not see to apply them.  It took me three days (yes, I said three days) and many hours to apply them!!  I was frustrated, mad and was going to give up but didn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I went out and bought a good lighted magnifying mirror and \\&quot;flat tweezers.\\&quot;  I then learned if I applied them under on my own lashes instead on top of my lashes, using very little glue (wait at least 15-30 seconds for the glue to become tacky), place them close together working from the inside corner of my right eye out and from the outer to the inside corner of my left eye (reverse if you are left handed) I did not disturb what lashes I had already applied; and it only took me 40 minutes to do both! They look so natural and beautiful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use short, knot-free individuals and black adhesive.  I tried the clear adhesive but it does not dry clear as they state no matter how little glue I used it still dried white.  I just wonder when people say it dries clear if it is newer glue they got and when it turns white if the glue might be old or something.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would like to find Ardell Double Individuals in \\&quot;short\\&quot; if some one out there knows where to get them.  I have only seen them in medium.  Ardell&#x27;s web site does not even show the doubles at all!  I will definitely buy more and never be without my individual lashes.</li>
    <li> The adhesive holding the lashes in the tray is so strong that tweezing them out of the tray pulls them out  shape such that they are unusable.  Very few lashes can be used; I spent as much, probably more, for usable lashes, as the mainstream drug stores.</li>
    <li> I really like this set of lashes but I have to write a review and give it only 1 star because I only received 1 pack instead of 4 on my re-order last February 3, 2014 (Order #116-0412152-9715459).I had ordered 2 sets of these at the beginning of the year which I was still using. I liked them so much that I ordered them again. The box arrived in February, but because I still had some left from the prior pack, I did not open this box until yesterday, March 18th. Upon opening this box, only 1 pack had been sent instead of the 4 that I paid for. By this time the return or replacement option was unavailable and all I can do to complain is through this review. I am hoping that the seller of this product read these reviews. My recommendation is to open the box as soon as it arrives to make sure that what is promised is what you get.  :(</li>
    <li> Sometimes these individual lashes are glued down so tightly that you have to pick that glue off the end of the lash before ou use them!  A BIG pain!  These lashes came right off!  Hopefully, my next order will be the same.  Been wearing these for MANY years and they are cheaper on amazon then when I buy them at a store.</li>
    <li> Nice quality!  Lashes last 2-3 weeks.  I go to my local beauty school &amp; have 50+ lashes applies for less than $6!</li>
    <li> I guess I love them because I keep buying them. I buy these and the mediums and alternate them along my lash line for a more natural, random look. I have never had any quality issues.</li>
    <li> My new favorites! I love that there is not a &amp;#34;lump&amp;#34; at the rott, so they don&#x27;t look goopy once on the eye..</li>
    <li> These eyelashes aren&#x27;t legit. I still used them, but I know for a fact they weren&#x27;t what I ordered. If you have had experience using eyelashes, you can make them work; however, compare some store bought lashes with these and see for yourself.</li>
    <li> Great lashes for all occasions. I use tweezerman tweezers to remove them from the package and have no issures. Lash duo is the only glue I&#x27;ve found to apply them with ease! If you are unsure how to apply false lashes, I suggest watching Lisa Elderidges video on youtube for individual lashes. Let your glue get tacky! I let mine sit for 3 minutes. I apply the glue the the cardboard that comes in the pack, I just tear it into smaller pieces.</li>
    <li> These are okay. Much better than the ones with knots. These are knot free but the glue used to glue the lashes together are sometimes in clumps. They are not even when it comes to the glue. Overall, just okay.</li>
    <li> I received this package just fine and all of the lashes looked perfect on me (months of experience will help!).  I would recommend this product for the quality.</li>
    <li> I love Ardell lashes. I&#x27;ve used these for years. They come off quickly and look natural. I would recommend, pulling them off with your fingers, rather than tweezers as they can bend the lashes.</li>
    <li> I do my own lashes. And I use a pretty permanent glue. Many people who use a longer lasting glue will use individual lashes, but I&#x27;ve found that these work just as well, and often better. Sometimes I&#x27;ll trim a few to place on the inner corners of my eyes, and the alternating lengths in one grouping make these very natural looking. I absolutely love these and order multiples now whenever I place an order:)</li>
    <li> I have purchased this item several times and this time it came with only 1 pack of the 4 it was supposed to have come with. I contacted customer service the day I received it, and even though it took me some time to receive a response, Amazon took care of the issue entirely. I love this product and with a steady hand, a magnifying mirror and some practice, you will too.</li>
    <li> great product and fast</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been buying and using artificial eyelashes for 18 years now, as they are much taxing on the eyes than mascara. The regular variety that you will find in drug stores is better. This particular one has the lashes stuck so tightly to the box that when I remove them one third of the lashes deform and become unusable (e.g. one &amp;#34;hair&amp;#34; sticks in the opposing direction, or two of the hair strands separate from the rest), no matter how carefully I try. Also, this particular variety does not stay on very well, so I have to reapply new ones every other day, as opposed to once a week with a drug store variety.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t live without these. They are good quality and are a must-have in my beauty routine.</li>
    <li> easy to apply and looks very good. much more realistic look than with the knotted ones. i recommend these to people who are new in applying false lashes, a bit more forgiving than the single lashes.</li>
    <li> The lashes were okay... Will recommend this product for people that want to save some money and don&#x27;t want to pay salon prices to get their lashes done..</li>
    <li> Hard to find in the stores in Parker, Arizona so getting them online is a big help. A product I have used for years.</li>
    <li> These lashes were defective, they fell apart as I removed them from the plastic container.  I was only able to salvage a few from each package.  HUGE disappointment!!!  Do NOT order these!  I use this company and buy them from the stores and they work great, but these must be seconds.</li>
    <li> Easy to use and delicate. Excellent product. 5 star seller. HIGHLY recommended!!!!!</li>
    <li> I always get these, they look natural on me!</li>
    <li> The lashes were great, easy to put on, just the right length. The price is better than the beauty supply store.</li>
    <li> I need this single lashes I have Trichotillomania very bad so when I put them on they look very natural looking</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t bother buying other brands. They are too long and use too much glue to keep them in the packaging. Best for every day use.</li>
    <li> Found these to be a bit fiddle to put on ,but got it right in the end.They looked really good once on.&lt;br /&gt;Don think I would go back to full lashes now, friends think they look super!!</li>
    <li> These were fairly easy to put on.  The best thing about this brand is that they come in short-- which means long for those of us with normal lashes. You can cut them down if you like.</li>
    <li> Dont get me wrong these lashes are great. Very natural looking but 11.00 for one pack thats Absurd. For some reason i thought I was getting four packs not just the one pack. I am going to try and find them somewhere around where I live.  That&#x27;s just too much money my goodness.</li>
    <li> Been using these for quite sometime now so glad&lt;br /&gt;Amazon carries them!! Can&#x27;t go wrong ! Looks&lt;br /&gt;Looks like your own lashes !&lt;br /&gt;Easy to put in!!</li>
    <li> These are great lashes and easy to use. But for this exact brand and quantity, it&#x27;s sold at Target for $3.99! I couldn&#x27;t believe the price difference when I saw them at Target!</li>
    <li> I love using the indvidual lashes because they are so natural looking and they last longer, but now i&#x27;m addicted to the strips!</li>
    <li> These lashes are my go-to falsies. I think these are the easiest lashes to apply; way easier than strip lashes. You can customize the look by placing the lashes differently. It&#x27;s nice to have just one product in creating many different looks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I initially bought the knot-free short black lashes as well as the medium.  I found the medium lashes were too long for my eyes and made me look like I was wearing falsies, much like most strip lashes do to me.  The short lashes are the perfect length, make me look normal (I live in a city where the girls wear 3 inch lashes - over-the-top! why?!?), and always draw compliments from people on my beautiful eyes.  I like buying them from Amazon because they are knot-free and cheaper than any vendor I&#x27;ve found.  Maybe only by $0.50 / box, but still. It adds up.  The ones with knots you see in drugstores look very different on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wear these for one day only, clean the lashes, and reapply the lashes that are in good condition at a later day.  The reason I wear and remove each day is I like to set my own eyelashes first by curling, lining the waterline and in between each lash, mascara, and comb through.  I can&#x27;t do that with fake lashes glued to my own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I learned to apply with Lisa Eldridge&#x27;s tutorial: [...]  It&#x27;s a great resource if you haven&#x27;t used them before.  If you don&#x27;t want to watch a video, my description is below.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;False lashes are generally the last part of my eye routine.  I use Duo glue in dark. I put a small drop of the glue on the back of my hand and then dip the end of each lash in it with tweezers. I then glue the lashes to my own, the false root next to the real root.  I have time to reposition and make sure they lay next to my own lashes before the glue dries.  Several minutes later so as to make sure the glue is dry, I then do a final coat of mascara (a light coat, no clumps because you can&#x27;t comb through!) to blend the fake with the real. I have round eyes, so I generally put the lashes on only to the outer half of my eye. I average 5 lashes per eye. I have used these along my whole eye and they look great.  My whole eye takes 10-12 lashes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I remove by placing a cotton pad soaked in an oil- or silicon-based eye remover on top of my lashes.  I gently move the pad back and forth.  I may also dip a cotton swab in the makeup remover and roll that gently along my lash roots.  I collect the lashes that come off and set them aside.  Then I wash my face, and the last few lashes come off then.  If I catch them before they go down the sink, I set them aside as well.  I usually save almost all of them, 8-10 lashes.  If the lashes are misshapen or have crimps, I toss them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If the lashes still have glue on them the next time I want to wear them, I can easily pull it off.  I just make sure to grasp all of the lashes in each flare with tweezers before I pick the glue off with my fingers.  That way I don&#x27;t pull the lash flare apart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend these!uter half of my eye. I average 5 lashes per eye. I have used these along my whole eye and they look great.

    <li> have used these for 30 years.  recently several packs have excess glue, rending 2 rows of lashes unable to be lifted without tearing them</li>
    <li> I use the dark adhesive and attach one, two or three on the corner of each lash after applying two coats of dried masacara.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These really make your eyes POP !</li>
    <li> it hurts. The price is expensive for the quality of the product</li>
    <li> I gave this a three as these are NOT easy to put on.  First I dropped about 6 of them when I tried to pick them up with tweezers and since they are lashes I couldn&#x27;t find them so that was not good then when I put the glue on and tried to attach them, they just didn&#x27;t stay on.  I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s something I am doing and I&#x27;ll try again but first blush....not for the routine person out there.</li>
    <li> been using these lashes for a while and I love them, they give that wow factor whilst not looking fake and tacky&lt;br /&gt;these arrived a whole week earlier than expected and they are exactly what I expected&lt;br /&gt;would definitely recommend</li>
    <li> These lashes are great. They look natural and when used with the right glue (and some practice) they look amazing. The only problem I have with them is the chunk of glue that holds them in the packaging. It&#x27;s a little tricky to get off and it doesn&#x27;t look nice if you accidentally leave a bit there.</li>
    <li> Hi what is pack of 4 mean? If I only got one pack inside the package. That I why I bought this product because all I thought there is 4 pack but it only contains 1 pack.</li>
    <li> VERY GOOD VALUE FOR A QUALITY PRODUCT</li>
    <li> if you buy the individual lash glue from Ardell, make sure to buy the remover too!! i have to yank them out after 3 weeks of them being on! some people just use dou lash glue! i prefer using the Ardell individual lash glue and am sure my lashes won&#x27;t fall out and cause embarrassment!</li>
    <li> Pro: came quickly, looked like photo...especially like that they don&#x27;t have knots.&lt;br /&gt;+short length (harder to find)&lt;br /&gt;+easy to handle&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con: - seem to mess up after sleep pretty easy...look kind of funky if you are a side sleeper.  Sometimes just washing your eyes and gently pressing with your fingertips fixes the crimps, sometimes not :(</li>
    <li> There is so much glue on these lashes that when you remove them from the package it looks like a big blob.  Then if you try to remove the glue, you ruin the lashes!  Terrible batch!!!!</li>
