      <li>It feels nice under moisturizer -</li>
      <li>I use cleanser (any kind) and toner (with lemon in it)</li>
      <li>But I knew my skin still needed more help and consulted with an aesthetician in my dermatologist&#x27;s office, who suggested this serum.</li>

      <li>I&#x27;m now cautious of ordering cheap items from amazon.</li>
      <li>I have used iS Clinical Pro-Heal Serum for several years and it is absolutely amazing!</li>
      <li>totally worth it!</li>
      <li>Then I shake the misting bottle every time I use it and apply to clean skin before moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I have super sensitive/ combination skin with eczema &amp; rosecea.</li>
      <li>So far, I&#x27;ve used it for about a month and am really pleased.</li>
      <li>She asked for it because she liked how it worked when she first bought one last year.</li>
      <li>This product worked for the first three months</li>
      <li>This one that was bought from amazon didn&#x27;t do anything when applied onto her face, but made her break out more the next day.  </li>
      <li>I started using the product again to see if the serum was in fact the cause of my breakouts and sure enough, after two weeks I started breaking out.</li>
      <li>Will be back for more.</li>
      <li>I love this product, use it daily on face, neck, and chest.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for about a month and my face is starting to look so much better.</li>

      <li>Highly recommend this product!</li>
      <li>I really like this product.  </li>
      <li>and I really don&#x27;t even wear that much...</li>
      <li>Highly recommended!</li>
      <li>now it&#x27;s been a few weeks and wow-- something good is going on.</li>
      <li>I was thrilled to find it on  Amazon for less!</li>
      <li>I use other products, too, but this is on my top 3 MUST HAVE skin care</li>
      <li>I used this in conjunction with IS Clinical Active Serum for a few weeks before my wedding (I have oily, acneic skin), and I happily didn&#x27;t have ANY pimples for my wedding.</li>
      <li>I was recommended this product by my facial lady and at first I thought she was just trying to sell me products</li>
      <li>It seems like my skin is less red, and more pores look smoother.</li>
      <li>so I always have to use make up to cover my dark spots but lately I&#x27;ve been feeling much more confident and have only been wearing sunscreen with lipstick and mascara out.</li>
      <li>It heals my skin and keeps it clear.  </li>
      <li>Wow.  </li>
      <li>I purchased the pro-heal serum on the advice of an aesthetician to help with my sensitive skin, hormonal breakouts and my rosacea.  </li>
      <li>I have sensitive, acne prone skin</li>
      <li>I open a new bottle of the balancing mist and add about 1 TBS of Pro-Heal to the mix, along with about a 1/2 tsp of Sovereign Silver.</li>
      <li>I have had cystic acne outbreaks for most of my life, that just got worse in my mid-30s.</li>
      <li>The first few times I used it, I wasn&#x27;t really wowed because my skin was still red and a mess from a prior breakout.</li>

<li> and my breakouts are very minor now.  </li>
<li> This one is not the same as the original one, meaning the quality is not right or it&#x27;s a fake.</li>
<li> but if you have to, only wear it until your face starts to clear up because from what I&#x27;ve noticed, make up makes your skin worse.</li>
<li> But after a few days my bumps and red dots were drastically minimzed.  </li>
<li> This product is very expensive but you don&#x27;t use very much and it last a long time.  </li>
<li> I use the active product at night also.</li>
<li> I have 0 active acne and my scars are getting way lighter.</li>
<li> then I use the pro heal in the morning and active serum at night.</li>
<li> Use SPARINGLY, a little goes a LONG way…plus it is not cheap.  </li>
<li> A very little bit goes a really long way.</li>
<li> This stuff does it all - improves tone, lightens dark spots, tightens skin, and helps with acne blemishes.  </li>
<li> I didn&#x27;t feel very optimistic about trying another expensive product.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
<li> That is less than $6 per month!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

<li> A little bit goes along way.</li>
<li> I use it once i feel a pimple forming and use a small amount to reduce inflammation and redness without the dryness of other pimple creams.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Although very expensive, I decided to purchase this after it was recommended by my cosmetologist. This product worked for the first three months and then my skin started breaking out. Once I stopped using the serum my skin cleared up. I started using the product again to see if the serum was in fact the cause of my breakouts and sure enough, after two weeks I started breaking out. So, I suggest getting a sample for a couple weeks prior to actually purchasing!</li>
    <li> Reduces the size of pimples dramatically. I use it once i feel a pimple forming and use a small amount to reduce inflammation and redness without the dryness of other pimple creams. A little bit goes along way. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> I have tried so many serums, and this one is for me the best ever. It calms skin, makes it tighter, good for acne, wrinkles, rosacea etc. Vit. A makes skin cells renewal faster (the best for wrinkles and acne), vit. C is oxidant plus brightens skin, and vit. E heals. I truly see my skin gets better when I use it.   To last longer I apply over damp face.   Maybe pricey but totally worth it!</li>
    <li> I have super sensitive/ combination skin with eczema &amp; rosecea. Everything irritates and hurts my skin. About 2 weeks after i started using this i noticed my skin has a kinda glow and skin seemed smoother. I haven&#x27;t used my rosecea prescription cream since I started this and my skin has been great. I am really hoping it continues!</li>
    <li> OMG--anyone with cystic acne should get this.  Though pricey, it is amazing.  I spent $2400 for DOT laser therapy 3 months ago with negative improvement in my skin texture due to acne flare ups.  My ethestician recommended iS Clinical Pro-Heal Serum Advance+ and gave me some samples.  Wow.  Three days and a huge cyst is now 95% diminished.  I&#x27;m sorry she was holding out on me.</li>
    <li> I have used iS Clinical Pro-Heal Serum for several years and it is absolutely amazing! I am not fighting acne, but I use it to eliminate redness and maintain a more youthful tone. I use other products, too, but this is on my top 3 MUST HAVE skin care items.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazon tells me I bought my previous 1 oz bottle in Nov2010. That&#x27;s over 1.5 yrs since my last purchase! AND I knocked the bottle over and spilled about 1/4 of the product on a countertop! So figure 2 yrs of excellent skincare for this price! That is less than $6 per month!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most non-acne customers will not NEED to use it every day. I use it after serious treatments like microdermabrasion or if my red tones get too high. I also mist Na-PCa onto my face after every cleansing. I open a new bottle of the balancing mist and add about 1 TBS of Pro-Heal to the mix, along with about a 1/2 tsp of Sovereign Silver. Then I shake the misting bottle every time I use it and apply to clean skin before moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Excellent choice for healthy, fresh skin.</li>
    <li> I love this product, use it daily on face, neck, and chest.  It heals my skin and keeps it clear.  If I have a scratch, mark, pimple, I put it on 2x a day until gone.  This is the best price I have found.  Will be back for more.</li>
    <li> The lid leaks after initial opening.</li>
    <li> I really like this product.  My skin looks healthier and it took the lines out of my chest, something that sleeping on my back alone couldn&#x27;t fix.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years and am very happy with the results. I use it in conjunction with the IS Clinical Hydra-Cool Serum</li>
    <li> I bought this for my wife.  She asked for it because she liked how it worked when she first bought one last year. This one is not the same as the original one, meaning the quality is not right or it&#x27;s a fake. The one she used before would foam up when placed onto acne and cleared her face of pimples the next day. This one that was bought from amazon didn&#x27;t do anything when applied onto her face, but made her break out more the next day.  I&#x27;m now cautious of ordering cheap items from amazon.</li>
    <li> I used this in conjunction with IS Clinical Active Serum for a few weeks before my wedding (I have oily, acneic skin), and I happily didn&#x27;t have ANY pimples for my wedding. I&#x27;ve continued to use it and LOVE it! It helps repair skin after a breakout, but also helps fade past scars. It feels nice under moisturizer - I wear it every day!</li>
    <li> My Dermatologist recommend this to me in her office and it is great for any healing that needs to be done on face/body/sensitive area.  Use SPARINGLY, a little goes a LONG way…plus it is not cheap.  My Dr charged $140. per bottle in her office ($$$$$$) I was thrilled to find it on  Amazon for less!</li>
    <li> I have struggled with my skin for many, many years. I have hormonal related breakouts with miserable cyst like acne around my chin. Some of those have resulted in scars that I dread. I have wrestled with keeping my skin hydrated enough while trying to keep the acne at bay. I use mostly Dermalogica products now and seem to have good luck with their cleanser and intensive moisturizer. But I knew my skin still needed more help and consulted with an aesthetician in my dermatologist&#x27;s office, who suggested this serum. The first few times I used it, I wasn&#x27;t really wowed because my skin was still red and a mess from a prior breakout. I didn&#x27;t feel very optimistic about trying another expensive product.&lt;br /&gt;But now it&#x27;s been a few weeks and wow-- something good is going on. My skin has a healthy tightness to it and a sheen that is not greasy. My make up goes on smoother and stays put much, much better-- and I really don&#x27;t even wear that much...some mineral powder and a light bronzer. I am really liking what I see, and pray it continues. It seems like my skin is less red, and more pores look smoother. My skin also feels fantastic-- I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s ever felt this smooth.  I plan to try the cleanser soon, and will definitely plan to continue with this serum if this keeps up. So far, I&#x27;ve used it for about a month and am really pleased. I have not been &#x27;pleased&#x27; with my skin in a really long time, so thank you iS Clinical.</li>
    <li> This is the best rosacea medicine I have used. There have been many products that I have tried before this one. An amazing product!</li>
    <li> I was skeptical b/c this product contains alcohol which is not good for rosacea.  But after a few days my bumps and red dots were drastically minimzed.  Some flaky drying but it definatly evened out my skintone.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Pro-Heal serum for about one year now in conjuction with Diamondtome microdermabrasion treatments once every month. I have had cystic acne outbreaks for most of my life, that just got worse in my mid-30s. This serum is a great product to help control not only the cystic acne but also calms my somewhat \\&quot;pinky\\&quot; skin tone. A very little bit goes a really long way. I put a few drops on the back of my hand, smooth a few fingertips over my face, then rub the backs of my hands together to get some serum worked into my hand skin. Highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I received a sample when I was at the Exhale Spa. I occasionally  breakout on my chin area. Since I used this product; going on 6 months no breakouts.</li>
    <li> The product helps with my lines</li>
    <li> I was recommended this product by my facial lady and at first I thought she was just trying to sell me products so I looked on amazon and found them for a bit cheaper. I&#x27;m in love with this product...I have sensitive, acne prone skin and I scar like crazy. I&#x27;ve been using this product for about a month and my face is starting to look so much better. I use the active product at night also. I have 0 active acne and my scars are getting way lighter. I have tan skin so I always have to use make up to cover my dark spots but lately I&#x27;ve been feeling much more confident and have only been wearing sunscreen with lipstick and mascara out. I recommend not wearing make up ever but if you have to, only wear it until your face starts to clear up because from what I&#x27;ve noticed, make up makes your skin worse. I use cleanser (any kind) and toner (with lemon in it) then I use the pro heal in the morning and active serum at night. I Hope this helped!! Good luck.</li>
    <li> I purchased the pro-heal serum on the advice of an aesthetician to help with my sensitive skin, hormonal breakouts and my rosacea.  I use the IS Clinical Face Wash, then use the serum and add a light moisturizer on top.  I&#x27;ve noticed my rosacea is much better and my breakouts are very minor now.  This product is very expensive but you don&#x27;t use very much and it last a long time.  This will be part of my skin care routine for years to come. I wouldn&#x27;t go back to anything else.</li>
    <li> This stuff does it all - improves tone, lightens dark spots, tightens skin, and helps with acne blemishes.  I am very pleased with this purchase!</li>
