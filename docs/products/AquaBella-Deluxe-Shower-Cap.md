### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>These are perfect.</li>
      <li>Very happy find.</li>
      <li>Perfect shower cap for our CHILDREN.  </li>
      <li>Very cute shower cap -- for a child!</li>
      <li>I think it&#x27;s GREAT -&gt;</li>
      <li>so it is another great find on Amazon.</li>
      <li>Personally, I love it!!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s the perfect size for my kids and really cute.</li>
      <li>but for the most part it is a very good buy.</li>
      <li>It is really good quality</li>
      <li>The quality is good, though.</li>
      <li>Nice shower cap a good buy.</li>
      <li>They keep all the water off my hair and fit great.</li>
      <li>so I don&#x27;t understand why so many complaints when it&#x27;s SAYS it&#x27;s \\&quot;SMALL\\&quot; and good for a child&#x27;s size head.  </li>
      <li>I WAS thrilled- until we used it.</li>
      <li>it comes off very easily from the head</li>
      <li>But i will not buy that kind any more.</li>
      <li>Love this.</li>
      <li>I am able to use it, but I am hoping it will stretch out in time as others have that I have purchased elsewhere.  </li>
      <li>:):)</li>
      <li>I would have been better served with a Medium</li>
      <li>so I ordered this cap in the hopes it would fit.</li>
      <li>Other than that, the kids love them and they are good quality.</li>
      <li>I bought this shower cap for the super savers shipping.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s just the right size for my wife Mary.</li>
      <li>All the ones in the local stores were huge!</li>
      <li>It is a pretty &amp; well made cap that looks like it will hold up for awhile.  </li>
      <li>At first I would have given it a 3 stars</li>
      <li>I wanted a small cap and it suits my needs just right, plus it&#x27;s durable &amp; very cute.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t have a large head</li>
      <li>so if you have a large head this might not be the cap for you.  </li>
      <li>This keeps the moisture of the bathroom air away from my hair and has a fairly tight fit while still being comfortable.</li>
      <li>But I actually really like it.</li>
      <li>I have hair above my shoulders and I can barely fit it all into this cap.  </li>
      <li>This one is small size, has a nice lining, looks pretty and does he job.</li>
      <li>I had one of these I liked in the past, but I lost it.</li>
      <li>I ordered this shower cap because everyone said it was so small and most people ordered it for their kids.</li>
      <li>It does the job, is roomy, and the color, white with a subtle blue pattern, is attractive and does not clash with the color of the shower curtain</li>
      <li>How can I send it back and get my money back in full including shipping.</li>
      <li>This should be sold as a childs shower cap - definitely not a small adult head size.</li>
      <li>even my 9 year old could not make this work...</li>
      <li>Cute cap, but WAY too small!  </li>
      <li>very big and not the small size as described and the elastic is very cheap..</li>
      <li>I ordered a new one recently and the elastic just broke after 2 weeks of use.</li>
      <li>I have curly hair that I blow out straight, which can take a while, so I try to only wash it every other day.  </li>
      <li>I decided that there was really no reason that my hair should be that wet, so even though it was very very inexpensive it wasn&#x27;t even worth the small amount that I paid for it.</li>
      <li>After reading previous reviews, I&#x27;ve assumed that this cap would be on a smaller side as some people complained about it being a size suitable for a child.</li>

<li> It is so small that I had to throw it away and buy a new one.</li>
<li> I can&#x27;t imagine it not fitting an average person, really.</li>
<li> Even though I have short hair it barely fit under the cap, which was so tight as to be uncomfortable.  </li>
<li> I was surprised to find this shower hat is so small.  </li>
<li> I bought these for my two girls and it has been a pretty poor experience.</li>
<li> I have a small head &amp; usually wear a small shower cap, but the previous reviewer was right in that this size small will fit a small child.  </li>
<li> It is big, or at least, a regular size.</li>
<li> My kids were really careful to keep their heads out of the shower spray but their hair was still soaking wet!</li>
<li> I like to think I have an average size head and shoulder length hair, and this cap doesn&#x27;t cover my head at all.  </li>
<li> I am petite and hate most shower caps that slide down over my eyes.</li>
<li> I used it a few times and maybe because it was so tight on my head, my hair was always wet when I took it off.</li>
<li> too small and water was still getting in and making a mess...  </li>
<li> simply because when you pay little you should expect little, but it was really useless for me.</li>
<li> When the previous reviews say it is small, they REALLY mean small.</li>
<li> I have a small head, shoulder length hair</li>
<li> Well I am a senior and I have a small head</li>
<li> After a few wearings I tossed it in the trash!</li>
<li> Remember, this cap is advertized as a \\&quot;small cap\\&quot;</li>
<li> The caps are not waterproof, but water resistant, they fail to meet the fundamental promise of a shower cap - to keep one&#x27;s head dry...</li>
<li> The cap runs very small.  </li>
<li> That was ridiculous.</li>
<li> I hate a shower cap that falls down over my eyes.</li>
<li> I ordered the wrong product.</li>
<li> I was disappointed in this purchase.  </li>
<li> Very disappointing.</li>
<li> I was very disappointed.</li>
<li> This is so wrong!!!</li>
<li> This product is awful.</li>

    <li> It&#x27;s just the right size for my wife Mary. All the ones in the local stores were huge! This one is small size, has a nice lining, looks pretty and does he job.</li>
    <li> Perfect shower cap for our CHILDREN.  These caps will not fit an adult unless the adult has a head the size of a CHILD.  Other than that, the kids love them and they are good quality.</li>
    <li> I have a small head &amp; usually wear a small shower cap, but the previous reviewer was right in that this size small will fit a small child.  I would have been better served with a Medium so if you have a large head this might not be the cap for you.  It is a pretty &amp; well made cap that looks like it will hold up for awhile.  I am able to use it, but I am hoping it will stretch out in time as others have that I have purchased elsewhere.  I gave a rating of 4 stars because it is a well made cap despite the sizing being off.</li>
    <li> This product is awful. It&#x27;s a shower cap for children. How can I send it back and get my money back in full including shipping. That was ridiculous.</li>
    <li> I bought this shower cap for the super savers shipping. But I actually really like it. It is really good quality and I use it all the time. Two tumbs up</li>
    <li> When the previous reviews say it is small, they REALLY mean small. Actually, that is why I orginally ordered it. I hate a shower cap that falls down over my eyes. At first I would have given it a 3 stars simply because when you pay little you should expect little, but it was really useless for me. I used it a few times and maybe because it was so tight on my head, my hair was always wet when I took it off. I don&#x27;t have a large head and I have very short hair. I decided that there was really no reason that my hair should be that wet, so even though it was very very inexpensive it wasn&#x27;t even worth the small amount that I paid for it.</li>
    <li> I think it&#x27;s GREAT -&gt; I wanted a small cap and it suits my needs just right, plus it&#x27;s durable &amp; very cute.  Remember, this cap is advertized as a \\&quot;small cap\\&quot; so I don&#x27;t understand why so many complaints when it&#x27;s SAYS it&#x27;s \\&quot;SMALL\\&quot; and good for a child&#x27;s size head.  Personally, I love it!! :):)</li>
    <li> This shower cup doesn&#x27;t protect you from the water. It is made of some material that lets water in. I&#x27;m in shock. Did they test this thing when they made it?</li>
    <li> Very cute shower cap -- for a child! I could not possibly  get it on my head. Very disappointing.</li>
    <li> This cap must not be for women with hair!!!  It is so small that I had to throw it away and buy a new one.</li>
    <li> I was disappointed in this purchase.  The cap runs very small.  Even though I have short hair it barely fit under the cap, which was so tight as to be uncomfortable.  After a few wearings I tossed it in the trash!</li>
    <li> I was surprised to find this shower hat is so small.  I have hair above my shoulders and I can barely fit it all into this cap.  It would not work for anyone with shoulder-length hair or longer.</li>
    <li> This is a well made shower cap that should last for quite a while.  I have curly hair that I blow out straight, which can take a while, so I try to only wash it every other day.  This keeps the moisture of the bathroom air away from my hair and has a fairly tight fit while still being comfortable.</li>
    <li> very big and not the small size as described and the elastic is very cheap..it comes off very easily from the head</li>
    <li> Love this. I am petite and hate most shower caps that slide down over my eyes. These are perfect. They keep all the water off my hair and fit great. I bought several. Very happy find.</li>
    <li> After reading previous reviews, I&#x27;ve assumed that this cap would be on a smaller side as some people complained about it being a size suitable for a child. This is so wrong!!! I have a small head, shoulder length hair and I could not keep the cap on my head for 5 seconds. It is big, or at least, a regular size. I can&#x27;t imagine it not fitting an average person, really. I had to return it. The quality is good, though.</li>
    <li> This should be sold as a childs shower cap - definitely not a small adult head size. I was very disappointed.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t work. It&#x27;s the perfect size for my kids and really cute. I WAS thrilled- until we used it. Totally doesn&#x27;t work. My kids were really careful to keep their heads out of the shower spray but their hair was still soaking wet! DO NOT BUY THIS!</li>
    <li> I bought these for my two girls and it has been a pretty poor experience. The caps are not waterproof, but water resistant, they fail to meet the fundamental promise of a shower cap - to keep one&#x27;s head dry...</li>
    <li> It does the job, is roomy, and the color, white with a subtle blue pattern, is attractive and does not clash with the color of the shower curtain</li>
    <li> even my 9 year old could not make this work... too small and water was still getting in and making a mess...  it&#x27;s a dud.</li>
    <li> Cute cap, but WAY too small!  I like to think I have an average size head and shoulder length hair, and this cap doesn&#x27;t cover my head at all.  Will give to my friend&#x27;s daughter, and try ordering the medium size cap.</li>
    <li> Nice shower cap a good buy.</li>
    <li> I ordered the wrong product. I was looking for a vinyl shower cap. but for the most part it is a very good buy. But i will not buy that kind any more.</li>
    <li> I ordered this shower cap because everyone said it was so small and most people ordered it for their kids. Well I am a senior and I have a small head so I ordered this cap in the hopes it would fit. It fits and I still have plenty of room so it is another great find on Amazon.</li>
    <li> I had one of these I liked in the past, but I lost it. I ordered a new one recently and the elastic just broke after 2 weeks of use. I&#x27;ll choose a different cap next time.</li>
