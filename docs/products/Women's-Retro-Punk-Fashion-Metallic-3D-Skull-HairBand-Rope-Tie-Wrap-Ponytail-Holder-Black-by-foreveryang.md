    <li> Great Item, bought many....</li>
    <li> I got it in silver, they sent me black. Still looks great even though they can&#x27;t read. I give it a four cause I still think it would have been better in silver.</li>
    <li> I thought that the skull appearance was going to be a matte black but it still looks cool,,,Wish it was bigger but i am satisfied...</li>
    <li> Its black, not silver!  Hard to make what it is...disappointed but too much of a hassle to return a 2 dollar item.</li>
    <li> It was broken when I received it.</li>
    <li> Thanks so much. Happy with the product</li>
    <li> 1st time trying to use, rubber band broke..</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t worn them yet... I bought two, and one of them had a busted, or, &amp;#34;Exploded&amp;#34; band. They&#x27;re super cute, but I&#x27;d probably recommend wearing them over other hair ties and not relying on them, as you don&#x27;t want them to catch on your hair. I really like them, and I&#x27;ll try them out. If they&#x27;re bad, I&#x27;ll update my review.</li>
    <li> I can not believe this product will come from China! The product is cheap, cheap, looks very cute, my hair has it.</li>
    <li> Was on time and loved it.</li>
    <li> I got two. Should have been silver..came in black. The skulls popped off the first time I tried to put them in my hair! Do not buy!!!</li>

    <li> Excellent product. Cute skull, right size for hair tie.</li>
    <li> broke in the first day</li>
    <li> It came to me with the skull broken off. i super glued it and now it looks amazing.</li>
    <li> Received hair ties...NOT AT ALL WHAT IS PICTURED.  What I thought I was getting is a silver metal skull, instead what I received was a black, plastic darth vader looking thing:(</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve bought multiples of these in both black and silver. I love them. Save time though and order more than one cause  if you love skulls you will want more and they do take a while to arrive. I haven&#x27;t had any pop off like people are saying but I did have one I tighted with a pair of pliers quick just in case. Simple quick fix.</li>
    <li> Elastic portion was not very strong.  There was a large chip of paint missing on the skull.</li>
    <li> Great gift for the wife..fast delivery</li>
    <li> I thought it would look very nice but I ordered it in silver and it came in black. Broke off the second I took it out of the package. Do not buy unless you have a glue gun handy.</li>
    <li> Love them, only hair tie I wear 💀💀💀💀</li>
