      <li>, it is not greasy feeling, and it is easy to apply.  </li>
      <li>I used it on my face over my regular moisturizer and on my legs the next day for 35 minutes in the sun and have a wonderful, even light tan (I&#x27;m fairly pale-skinned).</li>
      <li>It just hydrates and keeps the skin smooth.</li>

      <li>was super hesitant because this is a newer product to me but works better than any other facial bronzer I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
      <li>far, I really like it.</li>
      <li>Originally purchased this for tanning purposes, but realized how much softer and clearer my facial skin was and began using it as a daily moisturizer after I quit tanning.</li>
      <li>I have very sensitive skin</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not a very thick lotion.</li>
      <li>Only positive experiences with this product.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t want bronzers or tinglers, just a lotion to help keep my face looking natural and to help prevent premature aging.</li>
      <li>Would deff recommend for someone with sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t leave my skin caky or with brown residue because the lotion is white and goes on clear.</li>
      <li>I have normal skin, neither dry or greasy.  </li>
      <li>Didn&#x27;t work as fast as I&#x27;d like it too, but after 3 exposures I got the dark tan I wanted.</li>
      <li>While application is easy, and there isn&#x27;t an overpowering smell, I&#x27;m not really seeing the &amp;#34;intensifier&amp;#34; results that would be expected from other facial tanners.</li>
      <li>You achieve a clearer complex more darker color, no white spots nor blemishes caused by other lotions!</li>
      <li>I have very dry, sensitive facial skin with some fatigue lines.</li>

    <li> It has no color in the lotion, just white. A little goes a long way. I love it!!</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t really tell if it works any better than regular tanning lotion.</li>
    <li> I really like the feel of the lotion..highly recommend it:)</li>
    <li> This lotion is not tinted.  It comes out of the container white.  I like the texture, it is not greasy feeling, and it is easy to apply.  It does not irritate my skin, but it also isn&#x27;t very intensifying.  I think it&#x27;s better than using no product, but you aren&#x27;t going to see a huge difference.</li>
    <li> Expired in 2014, just received my bottle today :(</li>
    <li> Reduces the oil look of my face after tanning.</li>
    <li> Good size for the cost - definitely a good value.</li>
    <li> This facial tanner is absolutely perfect!  It has not cause any breakouts and is not greasy.  I have normal skin, neither dry or greasy.  I also suffer from rosacea.  This does not cause any kind of flare ups of that either.</li>
    <li> was super hesitant because this is a newer product to me but works better than any other facial bronzer I&#x27;ve ever used. Clearly obsessed by designer skin doesn&#x27;t even compare nor any others! this product is really what it advertises. You achieve a clearer complex more darker color, no white spots nor blemishes caused by other lotions! Recommend for anyone having trouble achieving dark facial tans</li>
    <li> This brand never disappoints me in any of their products I have purchased. This one really helps and works for my face and neck area.</li>
    <li> i have always loved australian gold have use it for at 15 years its the best</li>
    <li> I just received a bottle of this and am returning it. It smells horrible and the bottle is only 2/3 of the way full? I&#x27;ll go back to the product I was using before~</li>
    <li> I have very dry, sensitive facial skin with some fatigue lines. I&#x27;m also going through cancer treatments and can&#x27;t stay in the sun long this summer.&lt;br /&gt;I received this a few days ago and couldn&#x27;t believe the difference. It made my base tan look radiant and my face look as if I had just had 8 hours of good rest. I used it on my face over my regular moisturizer and on my legs the next day for 35 minutes in the sun and have a wonderful, even light tan (I&#x27;m fairly pale-skinned). No bad skin reactions. Will use on my face year round for the glow. Only drawback is it smells a bit chemically (a bit like Jergen&#x27;s self-tanner from the drugstore).</li>
    <li> This product is amazing! I had the woman who owns the tanning salon ask me if i had gotten a spray on tan on my face...after one use! My friends were amazed. The best part for me though...it cleared up my skin! I dont have a bad complexion but makeup and tanning and life were making it look rough. This producf cleared up my skin while making me tanner! Also, this seller is awesome! I received my order WAY earlier than expected...snowstorms and all. Plus they put a sample packet of a lotion in there for me! You will not be disappointed...with the product OR the seller!</li>
    <li> I only recently started tanning to help with a sun condition. I wanted something to help keep my face conditioned to maintain my youthful appearance, so I decided to try out this facial lotion. I didn&#x27;t want bronzers or tinglers, just a lotion to help keep my face looking natural and to help prevent premature aging. This fit the bill at a reasonable price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far, I really like it. It conditions really well and does seem to accelerate tanning. It has very little odor and doesn&#x27;t stain my clothes. There&#x27;s no bronzer in it. It just hydrates and keeps the skin smooth. It&#x27;s not a very thick lotion. It goes a long way and rubs in nicely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like it.</li>
    <li> This stuff definitely helps accelerate a tan.</li>
    <li> Really like idk if it does much but seems like it</li>
    <li> While application is easy, and there isn&#x27;t an overpowering smell, I&#x27;m not really seeing the &amp;#34;intensifier&amp;#34; results that would be expected from other facial tanners.</li>

    <li> It&#x27;s nice to finally have a product for face by Australian Gold.  It&#x27;s been my favorite lotion for years but I could never find anything for my face.  This is great.</li>
    <li> Originally purchased this for tanning purposes, but realized how much softer and clearer my facial skin was and began using it as a daily moisturizer after I quit tanning.</li>
    <li> awesome results, highly recommended!</li>
