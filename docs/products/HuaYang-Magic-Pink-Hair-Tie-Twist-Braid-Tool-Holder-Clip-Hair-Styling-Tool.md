    <li> it&#x27;s piece of plastic. didn&#x27;t work on me</li>
    <li> impossible to use, there isnt information how to use</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t know how to use</li>
    <li> Not very happy with this, if you look at the photo, it appears much larger than it actually is. This item is actually about half the size it shows. No way can I &amp;#34;braid&amp;#34; my hair in any form they show in the images, except for maybe a tiny braid? Ah well, I guess this one was a learning experience...</li>
    <li> NO WAY TO KNOW HOW TO USE IT!!!</li>
    <li> How to use: First spread your hair, then again set respectively symmetrical spread the hook on both ends of the ontology, and then to the left of the hair connection is set at the bottom of the S type spread the hook  Note: The size is MINI and smaller than a bank card。</li>
    <li> It works well  in hair.  It was easy to use.  I  would recommend to others.  Even granddaughter could use it easily.</li>
    <li> This item comes with no instructions whatsoever.  I was able to google ONE instructional video.  If anyone can link me to better instruction, I would appreciate it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Worth the dollar I paid, I am sure, but I still can&#x27;t *really* figure out how to use this.  Also, I would recommend the larger size.  This small size I received is difficult to use with hair that is even remotely thick.</li>
    <li> confusing how to use. No directions.</li>
    <li> I give this 1 star rating because you get NO INSTRUCTIONS good luck figuring out how to use it BLINDFOLDED!</li>
    <li> I bought this a year ago and its still in its original package - WHERE ARE THE INSTRUCTIONS?!?!?!</li>
    <li> No instructions were given and i have never used this product.</li>
    <li> There is very little for directions. I was mislead</li>
    <li> Instructions are fuzzy pictures and chines I dont know how used</li>
    <li> No directions anywhere... Not helpful</li>
    <li> Without any instructions it is a worthless piece of pink plastic.</li>
    <li> No information or instructions whatsoever.  . I looked all over the Internet and couldn&#x27;t find any instructions for this particular model.</li>
    <li> Very nice. Its not expensive but I can hold it up to my expensive bracelets without being able to tell the difference. Light weight. Bold colored stone without looking cheap. Enjoyed it more than a 1ct ginuine purpleAM that I have.</li>
    <li> Needs directions or I just don&#x27;t get it</li>
    <li> I wanted to like this, but the product directions were not in English. I thought I might be able to figure it out myself from the picture, but it was too small to see. If your good a puzzles, maybe you can get some use out of this product.</li>
    <li> The instructions are in Chinese, and the illustrations are so small I just can&#x27;t figure out how to use it.</li>
    <li> This is fun to use but too small for a grown ups head. It is better to be used on girls.</li>
    <li> Couldn&#x27;t figure it out</li>
    <li> No instructions mailed to me. Received item earlier than expected though. Have no idea how to create braids with this tool.</li>
    <li> Loved this it was cool I don&#x27;t think I use it correctly wish I had in strutting on use. Was easy to order.</li>
    <li> not sure how to even use directions were microscopic and in Chinese</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used it a couple times, for me kind of confusing at first.  It&#x27;s not a style I wear often, but it&#x27;s okay.</li>
    <li> The directions are only in pictures so it&#x27;s a little confusing.</li>
    <li> How do you use this thing?  No one knows!!!</li>
