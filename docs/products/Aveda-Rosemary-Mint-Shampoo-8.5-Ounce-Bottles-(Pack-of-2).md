      <li>Fast shipping</li>
      <li>and I feel like this keeps the dandruff away just as well as a normal dandruff shampoo</li>
      <li>I drink cheap beer, wear cheap clothes, and buy very few luxuries in general.</li>
      <li>Why would anyone buy this from this company when you can buy it directly from Aveda for $13.50!  </li>
      <li>It smells great, and the mint tingles, and it reminds me of being in NYC on a cold and rainy morning, walking down 46th to the diner for a bagel.</li>

<li> and i swear you&#x27;ll be addicted.</li>
<li> It also rinses all of the soap out of your hair even in hard water!!</li>
<li> I also bought the conditioner which was disappointing.  </li>

    <li> Always a great product</li>
    <li> When the packaged was damaged during mailing, the company sent me another bottle.  My daughter loves this shampoo; she says it makes her scalp tingle and leaves her hair very fresh and clean.</li>
    <li> Smells wonderful and wakes me up in the morning with the invigorating smell and feel of mint. A great product!</li>
    <li> Mint shampoo makes my head tingle, love the smell</li>
    <li> Simply my favorite shampoo!</li>
    <li> wife said ( just what I needed)</li>
    <li> Every once in a while, I take the time to treat myself to something out of the everyday... Most of the time, I&#x27;m pretty simple- I drink cheap beer, wear cheap clothes, and buy very few luxuries in general. However, I drink good coffee, drive a nice truck, and use this particular shampoo. Why? Because it&#x27;s awesome, and I am not a barbarian. It smells great, and the mint tingles, and it reminds me of being in NYC on a cold and rainy morning, walking down 46th to the diner for a bagel.</li>
    <li> great shampoo, love it</li>
    <li> Have used this product in the past and loved it so wanted it again. Love the sensation my scalp gets from the mint.</li>
    <li> I never have reactions to shampoos, but this one makes my scalp itch.  I washed my hair 11 hours ago and my scalp is pretty itchy right now.  I&#x27;m at work so there&#x27;s nothing I can do about it.  It left a greasy residue after I rinsed it off in the shower.  I also bought the conditioner which was disappointing.  I chose the Rosemary Mint on the recommendation of an Aveda representative.  I&#x27;ll be returning both to Aveda.com.  The scent is pretty good, but that&#x27;s the only thing I liked.</li>
    <li> Love this product!  Been using it for years</li>
    <li> This shampoo smells amazing and makes my hair so shiny! Worth the money for sure! I don&#x27;t have to use very much at one time either so this bottle will last me.</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this stuff!  It is expensive anywhere that you get it but worth the price in my book.</li>
    <li> Great! Love this product! First used it in a suite at Bellagio, LAS...better wake up than an espresso! Any time I wake up tired, a quick shower with this is the cure. I even use it as a body wash. Worth every penny! So invigorating! Be sure you love the scent of rosemary though. If you like sweet, floral scents, you will not appreciate this product. When Lancome made Aroma Tonic, it was my fav scent. This product gives me the same feel-good sensation.</li>
    <li> I love how well this lathers. I have a hard time with dandruff and I feel like this keeps the dandruff away just as well as a normal dandruff shampoo only it smells much better.</li>
    <li> Great product.  Fast shipping</li>
    <li> This is one of my favorite shampoos. I discovered it at a W Hotel once and had to have it ever since.</li>
    <li> Bottle came with tape over the lid but this didn&#x27;t prevent loss of some shampoo. About 1/2&amp;#34; ;(</li>
    <li> Excellent product for hair!  Thank you!</li>
    <li> i have tried and tried to buy other faux-aveda products that advertise mint &amp; rosemary.  shame on me.  none are as good as aveda -- there is something about the organic ingredients that make my hair shinier than any other shampoo. i have very thick curly filipina/spaniard hair, this tames it.  just try it seriously -- best 10 bucks spent and i swear you&#x27;ll be addicted.</li>
    <li> Why would anyone buy this from this company when you can buy it directly from Aveda for $13.50!  It is a wonderfully invigorating shampoo though... wakes me up in the morning.</li>
    <li> This shampoo with just a  dap of soap in your palm really cleans your hair. It also rinses all of the soap out of your hair even in hard water!! Your bathroom smell&#x27;s wonderful and so does your hair!!</li>
    <li> Fantastic shampoo. I only give two stars because the cost for the product and for shipping is unreasonable. Will buy again but from a cheaper vendor.</li>
    <li> The shampoo and conditioner are a great pair.</li>
