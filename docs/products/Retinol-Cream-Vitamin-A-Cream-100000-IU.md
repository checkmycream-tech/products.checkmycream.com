      <li>A Cream 200,000 IU]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this cream for several years and it is the very best at removing wrinkles.</li>
      <li>The product is awesome, will definitely be back.  </li>
      <li>and I think I look better then my friends.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m pleased with how Retinol Cream has improved my skin.  </li>
      <li>So, I&#x27;ll keep using the Retinol Cream, give it some more time, a couple more months, and hopefully that will be just the length of time I need for my wrinkle situation to improve.  </li>
      <li>I love this.  </li>
      <li>I love this product.  </li>
      <li>Both are &amp;#34;shrinking!&amp;#34;  I&#x27;m glad to see a product that matches</li>
      <li>Please tell them to expect more orders.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend it, and the price is great..</li>
      <li>This stuff is a real &amp;#34;Miracle Cream&amp;#34; I love this stuff!</li>
      <li>It makes my skin look smooth and radiant...</li>
      <li>I put it on at night before going to bed, and in the morning my face feels so smooth.</li>
      <li>Goes on smoothly and seems to help.  </li>
      <li>and I love the creaminess of this product, right out of the jar.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m pretty sure the 8 (5-star) reviews are bogus.  </li>
      <li>It is really a true results for me.</li>
      <li>As I said, I have all kinds of jars of things, but this few dollars if the best thing I have purchased so far!</li>
      <li>Then, the price is right</li>
      <li>I am still recovering and have spent most of this time in pain, which has put many new lines and wrinkles on my face and body from weight loss.</li>
      <li>Now as far as my fine lines and those deeper nagging wrinkles, I&#x27;m just not seeing the results others have reported.  </li>
      <li>First, of course, I read the other reviews, as most of us savvy shoppers do, went off those reviews and purchased this retinol cream.  </li>
      <li>I spent many weeks in and out of the hospital, etc.</li>
      <li>My skin gets really dry/rough because of it.</li>
      <li>It is very oily and made me break out.  </li>
      <li>I am absolutely nuts about this product.</li>
      <li>so I&#x27;m always thrilled to find things that will make me look younger, but this is not only slowing wrinkling, it is taking away that flaky skin thing that makes you feel like you need dusting.  </li>
      <li>My face felt very soft and smooth after the first application, that of course is a plus, and this was the same for me, after each application.  </li>
      <li>It leave my skin smooth and silky, and when I wake up in the morning my skin does not feel dry.</li>
      <li>Not only is it making my skin softer, more moist and younger looking, but it is making skin tags and plaques shrink.  </li>
      <li>cream keeps your face hydrated, but it is not actual Retinol cream, and does not reduce wrinkles like true retinol does, but since you are actually moisturizing your face and neck consistently, that helps...</li>
      <li>I have to say that it surprised me!</li>
      <li>i am 55 years old .&lt;br</li>
      <li>I have adult acne (blackheads and whiteheads).  </li>
      <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
      <li>My skin is so soft.</li>
      <li>My skin feels soft and moist, but not greasy.</li>
      <li>moisture to old peoples faces</li>
      <li>Haven&#x27;t tried it long enough, but the price is definitely worth it.  </li>
      <li>One of the things I love about this product is that it isn&#x27;t greasy, most of these things are greasy and feel heavy and uncomfortable.</li>
      <li>The next morning my face looks and feels very soft.  </li>
      <li>The vitamin A really gets down deep into your skin then.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I found out about retinol cream from a dermatologist on youtube.  The product is awesome, will definitely be back.  The customer service at Nutri Plus Tea is really good also.</li>
    <li> This stuff is a real &amp;#34;Miracle Cream&amp;#34; I love this stuff! It makes my skin look smooth and radiant...A great moisterizer...But use it at night only apply before bed...</li>
    <li> I am a fan of this product to this date I still use it and can&#x27;t complain of the results. It is really a true results for me. I recommend this product.</li>
    <li> i used the retinol cream for about 3 weeks now . i did not see no difference in my face .i take good cear of my face . i wonet buy it again . i am 55 years old .&lt;br /&gt;i purchased at amazon .</li>
    <li> The cream has a good reaction on the skin it make the darkspots disappear. I&#x27;m using and sell one of them to some clients and they feel confortable for buying it</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin so I have bouts with Eczema, Seborrheic dermatitis, and Rosacea from time to time. My skin gets really dry/rough because of it. This cream started working from day one, and it only cost 6 dollars. My skin is so soft.</li>
    <li> The cream is leaved my skin feeling nice, however, the smell is death defying!!! It took me a couple of days to get used it as it was on my skin and I still find it extremely yucky.</li>
    <li> Great product; great price.  It leave my skin smooth and silky, and when I wake up in the morning my skin does not feel dry.</li>
    <li> A little goes a long way with this product.  It is very oily and made me break out.  However, if you&#x27;re not acne prone, it is a good product to help see immediate softness in the skin.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  I put it on at night before going to bed, and in the morning my face feels so smooth.</li>
    <li> I definitely saw a difference with my skin using this moisturizing cream.  Not only did I see a difference but my best friend wanted to know what I&#x27;ve been using on my skin too bc she thought my skin looked great.  It&#x27;s softer, brighter, and just over all healthier.  I use it on my face, neck, chest, and hands.  A little bit goes a long way bc it is so concentrated.  Its especially good to use after you micro needle your face.  The vitamin A really gets down deep into your skin then.  I&#x27;m hooked!</li>
    <li> This retinol cream, highly recommended by experts, smells, feels great! Great size, great price, clean and smooth,love love! One of the things I love about this product is that it isn&#x27;t greasy, most of these things are greasy and feel heavy and uncomfortable. You can wear makeup over this or nothing at all, night or day. I have to say that it surprised me! For this price, I am thrilled! Over the last couple of years I suffered 3 heart attacks, 2 stents, followed by heart bypass surgery, a sternectomy plus other surgeries arising from complications. I spent many weeks in and out of the hospital, etc. I am still recovering and have spent most of this time in pain, which has put many new lines and wrinkles on my face and body from weight loss. This product seems to be working out for me for both those problems and for discolorations as well on my skin! As I said, I have all kinds of jars of things, but this few dollars if the best thing I have purchased so far! Go figure??!! Purchased through Amazon online as well, love it!!</li>
    <li> moisture to old peoples faces&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;love it and would recommend this product it help moisturizes my face  and makes it feel better.1 time a day</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m pleased with how Retinol Cream has improved my skin.  I have adult acne (blackheads and whiteheads).  Both are &amp;#34;shrinking!&amp;#34;  I&#x27;m glad to see a product that matches it&#x27;s advertising.</li>
    <li> I am absolutely nuts about this product. I ordered it as an experiment. Not only is it making my skin softer, more moist and younger looking, but it is making skin tags and plaques shrink.  I am overjoyed about this.  I&#x27;m 64 so I&#x27;m always thrilled to find things that will make me look younger, but this is not only slowing wrinkling, it is taking away that flaky skin thing that makes you feel like you need dusting.  I cannot say enough about this product and I intend to keep it in my makeup bag for the foreseeable future. Please tell them to expect more orders.</li>
    <li> I thought I bought the Retinol 200,000 iu [which is in the picture] only to be sent the 100,000 iu I&#x27;m going to take the time and money to return. I would like you to fix the picture if that&#x27;s the cause of the mistake. Hope you have a great day !</li>
    <li> This is a great product. I use it for daytime as well as night. If you use a light coating for day it works perfect. My skin feels soft and moist, but not greasy.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B005P0NAFW Retinol Cream Vitamin A Cream 200,000 IU]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this cream for several years and it is the very best at removing wrinkles. And the price is terrific.</li>
    <li> I used to get a prescription for Retin-A which was very expensive to keep using. I found this and have been using it for a few weeks and the results are just as good as the expensive stuff.</li>

So, I&#x27;ll keep using the Retinol Cream, give it some more time, a couple more months, and hopefully that will be just the length of time I need for my wrinkle situation to improve.  We&#x27;ll see...</li>
    <li> Use it every night, it helps to remove wrinkles and I think I look better then my friends. I highly recommend it, and the price is great..</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m pretty sure the 8 (5-star) reviews are bogus.  The one \\&quot;3-star\\&quot; review is written by someone with poor grammar and spelling skills...not a coincidence, I&#x27;m sure.&lt;br /&gt;This cream keeps your face hydrated, but it is not actual Retinol cream, and does not reduce wrinkles like true retinol does, but since you are actually moisturizing your face and neck consistently, that helps...</li>
    <li> Love this cream - great value! Will be ordering this again! Wish it were frangrance-free, but the smell isn&#x27;t offensive.</li>
    <li> I love this.  Goes on smoothly and seems to help.  Haven&#x27;t tried it long enough, but the price is definitely worth it.  Will re-order when its gone.</li>
    <li> I have naturally dry skin. I am African. In general we have dry skin.  I use this at night after my shower or washing my face. The next morning my face looks and feels very soft.  My skin just soaks it up and does a happy dance.</li>
    <li> I got this for my eye area. I had to toss it. It contains several eye irritants in it. My eyes would water and become red.</li>
