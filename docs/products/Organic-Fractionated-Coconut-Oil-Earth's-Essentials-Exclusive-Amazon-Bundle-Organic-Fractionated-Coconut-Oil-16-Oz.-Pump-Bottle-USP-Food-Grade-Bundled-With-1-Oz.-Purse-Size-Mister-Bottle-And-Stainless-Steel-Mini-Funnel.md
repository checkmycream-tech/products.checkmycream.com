      <li>&amp; it&#x27;s so much better.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m sure it&lt;br /&gt;be</li>
      <li>and it soaks in a lot better.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m in love will it</li>
      <li>but I am satisfied</li>
      <li>I love that it came with a pump and funnel.</li>
      <li>I knew that my first step would be to find a good carrier oil (this Earth&#x27;s Essentials Fractionated Coconut Oil)&lt;br</li>
      <li>/&gt;It arrived super fast, in its very own box and was undamaged.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I like that this oil is already in liquid form and easy to apply.</li>
      <li>It seems to soak into my skin more quickly also.</li>
      <li>oil arrived quickly and was packaged well with bubble wrap!</li>
      <li>i love this some much and for the price !!</li>
      <li>I want to review this fabulous fractionated coconut oil!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>(it couldn’t hurt) and it brought out the grain and it look fabulous.  </li>
      <li>The lable states it was bottled in the USA, is 100% organic and the highest grade available.</li>
      <li>It is nicely made and stainless</li>
      <li>I have only used it once but found the oil is very rich, clear and smells awesome.  </li>
      <li>Strangely I also found that this oil is great for wood.</li>
      <li>and it has a great coconut scent that lingers on the skin once dry.</li>
      <li>I did receive a discount to review this product and even after trying it out, I would pay full price to purchase this again.</li>
      <li>I used a healthy squirt for my hands and arms and that was way too much.</li>
      <li>This comes with the right tools to be portable without having to carry  the whole bottle!!!</li>
      <li>After reading some stuff online, I guess coconut does not have much smell to begin with, and if there is a strong coconut scent it is probably artificial.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m in love and it makes the skin feel so soft!</li>
      <li>This set is just amazing for a beginner like me - it has everything I need except the essential oil to add to it.  </li>
      <li>This product is amazing not only does it have a pump for home use it also came with a travel spray bottle.</li>
      <li>coconut oil seems good quality and is as expected for a fractionated coconut oil.</li>
      <li>I thought it was silky smooth and went on nicely, but it took a very long time to soak in, I felt pretty greasy for awhile.</li>
      <li>This bottle is huge and the little accessory bottle is nice.</li>
      <li>You can easily use the pump to pump directly to the hands to massage.</li>
      <li>The bottle and the pretty cobalt blue atomizer with the funnel are attractive and work great!&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely be reordering my oils from Earth’s essentials!!  </li>
      <li>and I very much like it.&lt;br /&gt;It</li>
      <li>I really like this coconut oil!</li>
      <li>I regularly use coconut oil on my skin, and I love the effects of it.</li>
      <li>whoever decided to include the stainless steel funnel is a genius!</li>
      <li>am extremely pleased with Earth’s Essential’s and want people to know that I would absolutely buy from this company again!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had issues with the pump getting stuck, even on the first use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I tried a little just straight from the bottle and it went on really nice, absorbed quickly and didn&#x27;t leave a greasy feel.</li>
      <li>will absolutely be looking to get more sets like this in the future to give as gifts to my family and friends.</li>
      <li>I normally use mineral oil on a daily basis, but like this oil much better.</li>
      <li>/&gt;The oil applies easily to skin and is not as greasy as regular coconut oil.</li>
      <li>I love fractionated coconut oil , I use it every single day</li>
      <li>I previously mentioned, the Organic Fractionated Coconut Oil Bundle really is a great started set, but it definitely has it&#x27;s flaws.</li>
      <li>The bundle is wonderful, the small spray bottle allows me to use this on my very curly hair and my damp skin after a shower I plan on using this with other oils and I will let you know how it works out</li>
      <li>The mini bottle &amp;#34;spritzer&amp;#34; is great if you only need a little oil.  </li>
      <li>I go to whole foods and purchase cheap essential oils that work well as</li>
      <li>The top of the pump can be closed and mine has not leaked, not even when traveling with it from neither the lid nor pump</li>
      <li>Arrived very well packaged.</li>
      <li>My whole family uses it too!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I really like that it comes w a travel sized bottle and a funnel to fill it up.</li>
      <li>There are some things I really like about the set and a couple things I don&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>How do I know if this is the real deal or not?</li>
      <li>Purse Size Mister Bottle And Stainless Steel Mini Funnel set.  </li>
      <li>Other than that, I love the way it makes my skin look and feel.</li>
      <li>The only reason I did not give this 5 stars is because I love the smell of coconut and was left wanting that with this product.</li>
      <li>And I know that when I am using fractionated coconut oil, my skin is absorbing a natural ingredient!</li>
      <li>Regardless, I am overall happy with my purchase, but would likely only purchase again as a gift for an essential oil beginner.</li>
      <li>So far, I&#x27;m enjoying this carrier oil that doesn&#x27;t have a coconut smell like some of the other carrier oils I have</li>
      <li>Little to no smell and love the spray bottle that came with it.</li>

    <li> I tried a little just straight from the bottle and it went on really nice, absorbed quickly and didn&#x27;t leave a greasy feel. The I put a few drops of essential oil in the spray bottle with the coconut oil to make a nice after shower spray. So far, I&#x27;m enjoying this carrier oil that doesn&#x27;t have a coconut smell like some of the other carrier oils I have tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Side note: I did receive a discount to review this product and even after trying it out, I would pay full price to purchase this again.</li>
    <li> Wonderful carrier oil. Great quality. It is a fractionated oil so there is no coconut smell. We received this product at a reduced rate in exchange for our honest review.</li>
    <li> Excellent Product, fantastic customer service.  The spray bottle comes in handy and is very easy to fill using the included funnel.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great.  I even made sugar scrub with it.  Little to no smell and love the spray bottle that came with it.</li>
    <li> Awesome product. I can hardly wait to create some custom essential oil blends.</li>
    <li> This kit is wonderful. You can easily use the pump to pump directly to the hands to massage. Or fill the little spritzer bottle with the  funnel that came with it to massage little ones or smaller parts like hands. I&#x27;m in love will it and it has a great coconut scent that lingers on the skin once dry. I will continue to let others try it and see how long it lasts.</li>
    <li> Love this coconut oil. I use it on my body and in my hair to moisture it. Love that it came with a little spray bottle and a little funnel so I can mix some essential oils with it and take it on the go.</li>
    <li> I love fractionated coconut oil , I use it every single day so when Earth&#x27;s Essentials offered me this  mazing bundle during a promotion for my honest review I was ecstatic to test it out.&lt;br /&gt;It arrived super fast, in its very own box and was undamaged.&lt;br /&gt;It comes with a pump, this is new to me and I very much like it.&lt;br /&gt;It also comes with a compact bottle for on the go which is perfect for spitzing away stress throughout the day.&lt;br /&gt;And whoever decided to include the stainless steel funnel is a genius! I dont know q single person that uses essential oils who would say no to this much needed gadget!&lt;br /&gt;It is fragrance free and this soaks right in to my skin as i expected, I even rubbed some on my hubbys face after he shaved tonight and it leaves no greasy film at all.&lt;br /&gt;This one blows the competition completely out of the water!</li>
    <li> I have never purchased fractionated oil before, so I was not sure what to expect. I regularly use coconut oil on my skin, and I love the effects of it. Usually, the coconut oil I use is partially solid, and I have to rub it between my hands to turn it into a liquid to apply to my skin. I like that this oil is already in liquid form and easy to apply. Also, the pump top makes for less mess than the usual jar I use. The first thing I was shocked my when using this was the lack of any scent. It has no smell to it at all, and I was anticipating a coconut scent. After reading some stuff online, I guess coconut does not have much smell to begin with, and if there is a strong coconut scent it is probably artificial.&lt;br /&gt;The oil applies easily to skin and is not as greasy as regular coconut oil. It seems to soak into my skin more quickly also. The only reason I did not give this 5 stars is because I love the smell of coconut and was left wanting that with this product. Other than that, I love the way it makes my skin look and feel.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing not only does it have a pump for home use it also came with a travel spray bottle. Makes my hair and skin feeling wonderful</li>
    <li> Huge believer in the benefits of coconut oil! Been using for about a year now and tell everyone how great it is! This comes with the right tools to be portable without having to carry  the whole bottle!!! Cant say enough! Great idea!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m liking this so far. I really like that it comes w a travel sized bottle and a funnel to fill it up.</li>
    <li> Arrived very well packaged. I have only used it once but found the oil is very rich, clear and smells awesome.  Very convenient to have the spray pump, small spray bottle and mini funnel.</li>
    <li> I use it as a skin softener and it works great. Makes my skin soft all day long.</li>
    <li> I really like this coconut oil! It&#x27;s not greasy,and makes my skin very soft.</li>
    <li> Great! I love it and would recommend to anyone. I have used every type of coconut oil out there and i love Earths essentials.</li>
    <li> I use this every day all over.  It is fragrance free, which is nice if you&#x27;d like to add your own scent.  I love the consistency of this oil.  The mini bottle &amp;#34;spritzer&amp;#34; is great if you only need a little oil.  I normally use mineral oil on a daily basis, but like this oil much better.</li>
    <li> I have never used fractionated coconut oil before - I am new into this whole new world of essential oils.  I am very interested in using essential oils as bug repellent for my one and four year olds - I am hesitant to use any store brand bug repellent because of the nasty chemicals used.  I knew that my first step would be to find a good carrier oil (this Earth&#x27;s Essentials Fractionated Coconut Oil)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this Earth&#x27;s Essentials Exclusive Amazon Bundle-Organic Fractionated Coconut Oil-16 Oz. Pump Bottle With A 1 Oz. Purse Size Mister Bottle And Stainless Steel Mini Funnel set.  This set is just amazing for a beginner like me - it has everything I need except the essential oil to add to it.  I really love that it comes with a funnel and small mister bottle - those are items I don&#x27;t normally have on hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will absolutely be looking to get more sets like this in the future to give as gifts to my family and friends. I received this product at a discounted rate in return for my honest and unbiased review.  All opinions expressed are my own.</li>
    <li> Great product! I love that it came with a pump and funnel.</li>
    <li> I use coconut oil all the time, but had never tried fractionated oil. I was surprised that there is no odor to it. I thought it was silky smooth and went on nicely, but it took a very long time to soak in, I felt pretty greasy for awhile. That could be a good thing for massages when you don&#x27;t want it to soak in very quickly. I don&#x27;t think I will use it as an everyday moisturizer though. This product was provided at a discounted price in exchange for my honest review.  *I updated this to 4 stars, I figured out that it takes a very small amount and it soaks in a lot better. I used a healthy squirt for my hands and arms and that was way too much.</li>
    <li> i love this some much and for the price !!</li>
    <li> This bottle is huge and the little accessory bottle is nice. I guess I am unclear on whether I can still use this oil like I do with refuse coconut oil such as for my hair and nails or if those benefits are taken out of this because its fractionated? That&#x27;s my only though there. There&#x27;s no odor and I&#x27;m sure it&lt;br /&gt;be great for massages!!</li>
    <li> I bought this product a month ago but did not want to review it until I knew how good or bad it is. And, it turned out to be really awesome.  I go to whole foods and purchase cheap essential oils that work well as topical skin agents (like Rose and Lavender) and mix a few drops with this oil.  I then pop it in my purse and use it all day to re-moisturize and refresh my skin.  This product is great.</li>
    <li> I use it for washing face, removing make up and lil moisturizer for face and hair. Cute bottle</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome! There is no overwhelming coconut smell and it doesn&#x27;t make you feel all oily and gross after using it! I&#x27;m in love and it makes the skin feel so soft!</li>
    <li> Excellent product, would recommend to friends</li>
    <li> Any essential oil enthusiast knows that fractionated coconut oil is a necessity. The Organic Fractionated Coconut Oil Bundle from Earth&#x27;s Essentials is a great starter set. There are some things I really like about the set and a couple things I don&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 16ounce bottle is a great size and I like that it&#x27;s stylish with a wide base and slim top, so it will look nice if out in the open, especially if you&#x27;ll be using it in a professional atmosphere, such as a salon, beauty, or massage parlor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The coconut oil seems good quality and is as expected for a fractionated coconut oil. The lable states it was bottled in the USA, is 100% organic and the highest grade available. I included a lable picture for reference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pump works well and attaches tightly. The top of the pump can be closed and mine has not leaked, not even when traveling with it from neither the lid nor pump itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The funnel was much larger than I expected, but I already have a bunch of minis, so it&#x27;s nice to have a larger size. I included a picture for reference. It is nicely made and stainless steel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smaller pump bottle is made of plastic and definitely isn&#x27;t anything special. I&#x27;ve had issues with the pump getting stuck, even on the first use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like I previously mentioned, the Organic Fractionated Coconut Oil Bundle really is a great started set, but it definitely has it&#x27;s flaws. Disclaimer: I received this product at a discounted rate in exchange for my unbiased review. Regardless, I am overall happy with my purchase, but would likely only purchase again as a gift for an essential oil beginner.</li>
    <li> The bundle is wonderful, the small spray bottle allows me to use this on my very curly hair and my damp skin after a shower I plan on using this with other oils and I will let you know how it works out but I am satisfied</li>
    <li> I want to review this fabulous fractionated coconut oil!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My oil arrived quickly and was packaged well with bubble wrap! The bottle and the pretty cobalt blue atomizer with the funnel are attractive and work great!&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely be reordering my oils from Earth’s essentials!!  I am very impressed with this product. My whole family uses it too!&lt;br /&gt;I see that you have a variety of other oils that I look forward to trying!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used the coconut oil for not only for cooking but also for my face and skin!  I use it to take off my make-up (even waterproof mascara comes off like a breeze).  Morning and evening I put it all over my face as a moisturizer.  I know that it will never clog your pores. I use it with my mineral foundation and a foundation brush; then I mix 1 pump of the fractionated coconut oil with my powder and mix together. It not only covers well but also makes your skin feel awesome all day. After using this for a while I went to get a facial and she was so surprised because the last time I was there she said that I had rosacea and now I don’t.  I told her what I use on my face and she said that she had heard this but never saw how well it worked.  She is now telling everyone to get fractionated coconut oil. I use it all over my body and also before and after shaving my legs! I got sunburn last weekend and put this on and it took the burn away. Soothes the skin too! My skin has never felt so good! And I know that when I am using fractionated coconut oil, my skin is absorbing a natural ingredient! It’s fabulous!&lt;br /&gt;I used it in my hair everyday after my shower when my hair is wet! It keeps the frizz away and makes my hair shiny!  Once a month I put it in my hair before my shower to give it a deep condition.  I kept the little vial in my purse when the weather got humid and used it to spritz on my hand and then ran it through my hair to control the frizz.  It also worked great on chapped lips or hands. It soaks it so fast!Absolutely Love this!!&lt;br /&gt;I also used the oil to cook with!  Made Mayonnaise with it! I use it sometimes instead of olive oil!  Strangely I also found that this oil is great for wood. I have a very dry old piano and thought that I would try to use some on it (it couldn’t hurt) and it brought out the grain and it look fabulous.  It just drank it up!&lt;br /&gt;I am extremely pleased with Earth’s Essential’s and want people to know that I would absolutely buy from this company again!</li>
    <li> I have never used fractionated coconut oil before, but it feels like mineral oil to me. How do I know if this is the real deal or not? My skin feels suffocated. I am using my rose hip seed oil again &amp; it&#x27;s so much better.</li>
