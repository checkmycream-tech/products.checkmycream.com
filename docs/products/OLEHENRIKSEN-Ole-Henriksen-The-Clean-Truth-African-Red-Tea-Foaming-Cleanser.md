      <li>my all time favorite face cleanser.  </li>
      <li>Just love it.</li>
      <li>One of the best simple face wash products I have used.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried many cleansers from most of brands that you see in department store.</li>
      <li>But just this one and Clarins Shea butter are my precious gems.</li>
      <li>Lovely grapefruit scent.</li>
      <li>With this one, my picky skin is just getting better &amp;#60;3</li>
      <li>My skin is more radiance after using this, oil also takes longer to appear.</li>
      <li>This cleanser is great for this issue and great to use year round, although for some it may not be as strong in warm or humid weather.</li>
      <li>It does not leave any film and my face feels very clean after using it.</li>
      <li>I love how portable and easy to use this face wash is.</li>
      <li>Not only is the product incredible with a wonderful fragrance (a blend of fruity, floral and earthy), but it lasts a long time.  </li>
      <li>Fabulous cleanser---mild and refreshing ..</li>
      <li>Also the bottle is easy to travel with and the suds that are created are easy to wash off.</li>
      <li>I am always trying new products and do a good amount of research before I purchase hygiene products.</li>
      <li>The smell was pleasant, it left my face very clean.</li>
      <li>For these needs, this fit the bill.  </li>
      <li>Used with a Clarisonic (ish) cleansing brush, it makes my skin soft and bright.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s good for all skin types, washes without drying and leaves your skin clean and clear.  </li>
      <li>I noticed a significant improvement: my skin looked clearer, felt softer.</li>
      <li>I prefer this cleanser to the one that came with the brush originally.  </li>
      <li>By far the best facial wash products I&#x27;ve ever found.</li>
      <li>soaps etc clean my face well.</li>
      <li>It leaves my skin clean feeling</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t have high hopes for this, because I don&#x27;t normally find foam cleansers to be very effective.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend it for anyone who wants a good face wash.</li>
      <li>I believe that this scent is gender-neutral as it is sweet tea scented.</li>
      <li>First, it is easy to use.  </li>
      <li>I guess it cleanses the skin well leaving it fresh and clean in feeling</li>
      <li>Thanks Amazon!!</li>
      <li>Secondly, it smells very good, and actually makes me look forward to using it in the shower.  </li>
      <li>While Clarins gives me a soft, pampering feel; Ole Henrikson gives me refreshing, clarify skin that I prefer to use it in the morning and Clarins in the evening.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Yes, fun.</li>
      <li>Love , love this product, my skin feels clean and refreshed, tight but hydrated.</li>
      <li>My skin feels soft, clean, fresh, smooth, and tight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s so hard to find a facial cleanser that doesn&#x27;t do more harm than good (AKA more harm that cleaning).</li>
      <li>and this does not leave my face dry but smooth and very clean.  </li>
      <li>The relieve that, simply open the top of the bottle to let air in, it will resume it&#x27;s shape.</li>
      <li>I love the citrus smell and the way it deep cleans my skin.</li>
      <li>Has helped smooth out my 60 year old skin.</li>
      <li>The natural products make this a great product for those wishing to lesson the impact of excessive chemincals on their skin.  </li>
      <li>With such easy use it really cleans the dirt off your face really well.</li>
      <li>Very &amp;#34;fresh&amp;#34; in smell and texture and fun/easy to use.</li>
      <li>I also really like the experience of using this product.  </li>
      <li>I have very oily skin and not all</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s gentle on my face yet cleans make-up off well.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall, I really like this and think it works well with my skin type.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s only been 2 months and it has completely collapsed, even though I&#x27;ve used the pump on the top and haven&#x27;t squeezed the bottle.</li>
      <li>I never imagined myself spending $30 on a facial cleanser, but it&#x27;s entirely worth it!  </li>
      <li>Facial products are high on my list of important hygiene products.  </li>
      <li>I am currently deployed and it keeps my face clean and moisturized.</li>
      <li>I usually have problems getting the right winter cleanser since the ones for dry skin never do a good job getting my sunblock off and leave me with clogged pores.</li>
      <li>This quickly made it into my box of items that I travel with just to use up..will never be a basic bathroom staple to me.</li>
      <li>This product seemed to be highly recommended.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>I have combination to more dry skin (especially in the winter)</li>
      <li>This isn&#x27;t necessarily a negative but is worth noting as some other cleansers do seem to do a good job of adding moisture to the skin and locking in the moisture that is already there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>My skin is combo, very sensitive, acne prone.</li>
      <li>I stick with the more classic drugstore items for facial cleansers, not worth the money.</li>
      <li>Wow!  </li>
      <li>My skin is soft and clear!</li>
      <li>I found it drying to my skin and my face was red, especially in my t-zone area and around my mouth, so I did a super hydrating mask, which seemed to help.</li>
      <li>And while genetics are certainly a factor, this cleanser is also a  key ingredient in my skin care regimen....</li>
      <li>This foaming facial cleaner is very high quality.  </li>
      <li>Took a week to clear</li>
      <li>My 17 year old has took a fancy to it now also</li>
      <li>I like the foam action.</li>
      <li>Leaves the skin soft and does not leave a film</li>
      <li>I keep one in the shower and one near the sink (for before bedtime face washing).</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This is a great cleanser. It does not dry out your skin. Lovely grapefruit scent.</li>
    <li> Nothing gets past this cleanser. Just one little pump of the stuff goes a long way and washes off a face full of makeup and very harsh environmental debris (sandstorms galore out here). My skin feels soft, clean, fresh, smooth, and tight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a comment about the packaging. I noticed that the pump will pull air out of the bottle -- there&#x27;s no way to avoid this. And the bottle indents. The relieve that, simply open the top of the bottle to let air in, it will resume it&#x27;s shape. You only have to do it periodically, but since that happening is a law of physics, I&#x27;d rather open the bottle from time to time than have them take away the pump.....LOVE THE PUMP. Those 7 oz ought to last about three months - four months. All around fab. Love Ole Henriksen!</li>
    <li> This is my go-to facial cleanser.  It&#x27;s gentle on my face yet cleans make-up off well.</li>
    <li> A little drying for my skin.  Removes eye makeup wonderfully.</li>
    <li> Wonderful face wash. Does not dry skin out. Has helped smooth out my 60 year old skin.Just love it.Thank You</li>
    <li> I have combination/oily skin so i had been avoiding Argan oil for my face.  Wow!  I really love this stuff.  Facial products are high on my list of important hygiene products.  This cleanser kicked it out of the park.  Used with a Clarisonic (ish) cleansing brush, it makes my skin soft and bright.</li>
    <li> The natural products make this a great product for those wishing to lesson the impact of excessive chemincals on their skin.  It is economical as just a small amount is needed to cleanse the skin.</li>
    <li> I was a little hesitant buying this cleanser, because I had no reason to leave my original face wash other than plain getting bored of it. I tried the Ole cleanser. The smell was pleasant, it left my face very clean. Shortly after, maybe two days later I noticed breakouts on my face. I thought they were a sign my skin was adjusting. I decided the cleanser was not to blame. With this in mind, I continued using it. There were no breakouts. I noticed a significant improvement: my skin looked clearer, felt softer. Wonderful product.</li>
    <li> For years I used gel cleansers because of my somewhat oily t-zone. But this was horrible for the more dry skin on the rest of my face. This cleanser is great for this issue and great to use year round, although for some it may not be as strong in warm or humid weather. And it smells great too!</li>
    <li> Been using this product for years.  Works best for me during the spring and summer.  Ole Henriksen products deliver as promised.  I&#x27;ll always have as part of my regimen.</li>
    <li> I usually buy this at Sephora but ordered it online this time.  It is an amazing face wash/toner but the bottle that was shipped does not work great -- don&#x27;t know if that had anything to do with shipping but I will probably just get it from the store from now on.</li>
    <li> smell I like it very good!</li>
    <li> my all time favorite face cleanser.  Deep cleans, keeps acne away and removes make up.  no need for anything else.  I love love love it!</li>
    <li> My skin is combo, very sensitive, acne prone. I&#x27;ve tried many cleansers from most of brands that you see in department store. But just this one and Clarins Shea butter are my precious gems. While Clarins gives me a soft, pampering feel; Ole Henrikson gives me refreshing, clarify skin that I prefer to use it in the morning and Clarins in the evening.&lt;br /&gt;It has thick, creamy foam with mild scent of orange peel which makes me feel so relaxing. It cleans well and clarify my skin but does not dries skin out any bit. My skin is more radiance after using this, oil also takes longer to appear. There was few cleansers could give me the same result but in the long term, they started drying out my skin horribly. With this one, my picky skin is just getting better &amp;#60;3</li>
    <li> Failed to list &amp;#34;shea butter&amp;#34; as an ingredient on the Amazon sales page &amp; I&#x27;m allergic. Took a week to clear up- but in its defense, my husband used it &amp; loved it.</li>
    <li> One of the best simple face wash products I have used. I am about to order another bottle, it will be my 4th one.</li>
    <li> Deep cleans my skin without drying it out.</li>
    <li> Another product I bought for my granddaughter.  She loves it and it keeps her skin in good condition. Good buy.</li>
    <li> This product thoroughly cleans my skin without drying it out. I usually have problems getting the right winter cleanser since the ones for dry skin never do a good job getting my sunblock off and leave me with clogged pores. This is a great product. For summer time, I use the on the go vitamin C cleanser by Ole.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Updated review: I still love this product as it is a really good cleanser. The packaging however has proven to be awful over time. It&#x27;s only been 2 months and it has completely collapsed, even though I&#x27;ve used the pump on the top and haven&#x27;t squeezed the bottle.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years and it is just wonderful.  It&#x27;s good for all skin types, washes without drying and leaves your skin clean and clear.  I highly recommend it for anyone who wants a good face wash.</li>
    <li> I love how portable and easy to use this face wash is. I am currently deployed and it keeps my face clean and moisturized. Also the bottle is easy to travel with and the suds that are created are easy to wash off. With such easy use it really cleans the dirt off your face really well. The washing water here has slight amounts of salt in it, however, I have had no skin dryness or problems while using this face wash. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Deep cleans . Love the scent</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t have high hopes for this, because I don&#x27;t normally find foam cleansers to be very effective. This one really surprised me. After about a week, I noticed that my complexion looked brighter and my skin was smoother and softer. My skin tends to be pretty sensitive and even with the slight fragrance, this cleanser did not irritate me at all.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t recommend this stuff enough. It&#x27;s so hard to find a facial cleanser that doesn&#x27;t do more harm than good (AKA more harm that cleaning). Very &amp;#34;fresh&amp;#34; in smell and texture and fun/easy to use. Yes, fun. I like the foam action. I keep one in the shower and one near the sink (for before bedtime face washing). LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Ole Henriken African Red Tea Foaming Cleanser for years.  I&#x27;ve tried other products but nothing cleans as well and as gently as this product.</li>
    <li> I alternate between this and Truth to Go wipes. I tend to use the wipes because I love how they smell, although this doesn&#x27;t smell bad at all. It leaves my skin clean feeling and I don&#x27;t feel any residue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do use a number of other Ole Henricksen products. I doubt I will ever leave them for another brand.</li>
    <li> I use this Ole Henriksen cleanser with my Clarisonic Mia 2 brush.  I prefer this cleanser to the one that came with the brush originally.  It does not leave any film and my face feels very clean after using it.</li>
    <li> Love , love this product, my skin feels clean and refreshed, tight but hydrated. My 17 year old has took a fancy to it now also, I will be reordering this product repeatedly.</li>
    <li> Loooove! Smells good. My skin is soft and clear! 1 pump is enough so this big bottle will last a long time.</li>
    <li> This foaming facial cleaner is very high quality.  First, it is easy to use.  One pump and it foams perfectly, making it very easy and fast to wash your face.  Secondly, it smells very good, and actually makes me look forward to using it in the shower.  I believe that this scent is gender-neutral as it is sweet tea scented.</li>
    <li> I first tried Ole Henriken African Red Tea Foaming&lt;br /&gt;Cleanser in a discovery kit offered on QVC Shopping&lt;br /&gt;Channel. I found this product on Amazon and ordered the&lt;br /&gt;7 oz Bottle.  1-2 Pumps is sufficient to cleanse the&lt;br /&gt;face whether you use your hands, wash cloth or facial&lt;br /&gt;brush.  Leaves the skin soft and does not leave a film&lt;br /&gt;which would require a toner!! As individual results&lt;br /&gt;may vary, I have noticed with regular use my complexion&lt;br /&gt;is softer, clarity and tone have improved. The cleanser&lt;br /&gt;has very nice aroma also. Very happy with product.&lt;br /&gt;Will reorder again from Amazon.  Thanks Amazon!! as I&lt;br /&gt;remain a happy customer :)</li>
    <li> I will start by saying that I love Ole Henriksen products (obsessed with truth serum and invigorating night gel) so I jumped at the chance to buy this one. I was pretty disappointed in that after a few weeks of using, I saw nothing different in my skin. I will also say that I dont have any major skin problems and perhaps it is intended to do something if you already have existing conditions.  I guess it cleanses the skin well leaving it fresh and clean in feeling but it definitely isn&#x27;t a great make up remover. This quickly made it into my box of items that I travel with just to use up..will never be a basic bathroom staple to me. I stick with the more classic drugstore items for facial cleansers, not worth the money. (The scent is the best part...not a deal breaker for me).</li>
    <li> I never imagined myself spending $30 on a facial cleanser, but it&#x27;s entirely worth it!  Not only is the product incredible with a wonderful fragrance (a blend of fruity, floral and earthy), but it lasts a long time.  I&#x27;ve had my current bottle for at least four months and I use it twice every day.  Buy this!</li>
    <li> The African Red Tea cleanser leaves my skin feeling soft and refreshed. By far the best facial wash products I&#x27;ve ever found.</li>
    <li> Fabulous cleanser---mild and refreshing ..leaves face soft and clean without ridiculous scent and without drying. I am 53 and usually mistaken for someone 10-15 years younger....because this leaves me with a dewy complexion. And while genetics are certainly a factor, this cleanser is also a  key ingredient in my skin care regimen....and a little goes a loooong way!</li>
    <li> I have very oily skin and not all soaps etc clean my face well. Ole Henriksen is been the best so far. I recommend it because it works.</li>
    <li> My favourite cleanser. I have ordered my second bottle.</li>
    <li> As the title mentions, I have sensitive, acne prone skin that is also very dry.  Because of this, I tend to be picky about the products that I use and stick to things that won&#x27;t irritate my skin, over dry, or exasperate my acne.  For these needs, this fit the bill.  I didn&#x27;t notice any increase in frequency or severity of my breakouts after using this.  It also didn&#x27;t dry out or irritate my skin or leave a film behind, which I appreciate.  I also really like the experience of using this product.  It is easy to use, feels great on the skin, and has a really pleasant smell. I like that the smell is pronounced, but doesn&#x27;t smell artificial or overpowering as some facial products do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think the only thing to keep in mind is that although this doesn&#x27;t dry out or irritate the skin, it doesn&#x27;t moisturize the skin either.  This isn&#x27;t necessarily a negative but is worth noting as some other cleansers do seem to do a good job of adding moisture to the skin and locking in the moisture that is already there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I really like this and think it works well with my skin type.</li>
    <li> I love the citrus smell and the way it deep cleans my skin.</li>
    <li> I am a 49 year old male. I am always trying new products and do a good amount of research before I purchase hygiene products. This product seemed to be highly recommended. I found it drying to my skin and my face was red, especially in my t-zone area and around my mouth, so I did a super hydrating mask, which seemed to help. However, in the morning, the area around my mouth was still dry. I am taking this product back. Next...</li>
    <li> Love how this makes my face feel!  I have combination to more dry skin (especially in the winter) and this does not leave my face dry but smooth and very clean.  Will for sure buy again!</li>
