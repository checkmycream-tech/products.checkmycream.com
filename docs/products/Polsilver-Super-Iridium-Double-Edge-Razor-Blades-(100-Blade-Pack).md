      <li>The Pol Silver SI Blades were the best of the lot; very sharp, and very smooth.</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t by Mach3 razors when these are dirt cheap and work 100,000,000x better.  </li>
      <li>Some of my most comfortable shaves have come from them.</li>
      <li>The blades are really sharp and give excellent shaves.</li>

      <li>me, these are the perfect balance of sharp and smooth.</li>
      <li>Feel free to disagree but that is my opinion of them.&lt;br /&gt;PPI</li>
      <li>A bit more costly but worth the price.</li>
      <li>Extremely smooth blades.</li>
      <li>Smooth, but not all that forgiving.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Incidentally, the best blade packaging I&#x27;ve found is that of the Western Family Stainless blades.  </li>
      <li>They tell me just the right pressure to apply -- very light, but still allowing for a decent-length, full contact stroke.</li>
      <li>but, on my first pass I checked, twice, to make sure the blade was inserted correctly because it was that smooth.</li>
      <li>at least\\&quot; a weeks worth of close, irritation free shaves.</li>
      <li>I have been shaving with them for over a week now and the shaves are very consistent: very close and very comfortable.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m surprised I&#x27;m the first to write a review on these wonderful Russian blades.</li>
      <li>Razor Polsilver Super Iridium - cpl.</li>
      <li>7 O&#x27;Clock Super Stainless&lt;br /&gt;Feather</li>
      <li>For the first time in my shaving career, I could have comfortably walked out the door with a one pass shave.</li>
      <li>This week started the PolSilver blades and at first I thought there wasn&#x27;t a blade in the razor?!?</li>
      <li>Of the blades I&#x27;ve tried thus far, the PolSilver Super Iridium is my favorite.  </li>
      <li>The best price for 100 blades is usually around $25, though quoted prices range to as high as $40.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Astra has the same coatings so make your own decision.</li>
      <li>They are good blades, just be careful.  </li>
      <li>Are they worth the price?</li>
      <li>I feel it&#x27;s worth it to have some on hand</li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve used this blade in every razor that I own...from mild merkur long handle, EJ89, Feather Popular....</li>
      <li>/&gt;They are worth the investment to get a nice sharp blade that is comfortable to use.  </li>
      <li>While still a deal compared to carts, they are rather pricey compared to other good blades.</li>
      <li>Astra razor blades made in the same factory as these cost much less and are excellent blades.</li>
      <li>But, at the present time, I&#x27;m extremely satisfied with the PolSilver Super Iridium blade.  </li>
      <li>After using SI&#x27;s for several months I can say they are simply the BEST blade I&#x27;ve tried so far.</li>
      <li>I rarely splurge on higher priced things, and this is why.</li>
      <li>I get a much better shave than what I was getting with my Gillette Mach 3 cartridge razor, and at a tiny fraction of the cost.  </li>
      <li>I have a medium-coarse beard and my first blade of choice was the Feather blade.  </li>
      <li>Absolutely effortless!</li>
      <li>A bit pricier thanother DE blades, but higher quality.</li>
      <li>Next week will be the Astra&#x27;s, so I will be able to determine their likeness.  </li>
      <li>I did have enough though to still have some when I found these and have been able to shave with them side by side.</li>
      <li>I just finished my first batch of 100.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m getting four shaves out of each blade right now, and could push it further, but I&#x27;m enjoying the luxury too much.</li>
      <li>/&gt;The downside of the PolSteel Super Iridium blades (and many other double-edge blade brands, for that matter) is the packaging.  </li>
      <li>If you liked the old Russian Iridium blades, you will like these.</li>
      <li>I also have used several of the modern made blades and these are at the top of my list.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>There is a small difference between good and great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The big difference is how long will they give a good shave before they start tugging.</li>
      <li>And shaving with a safety razor is a lot more fun and satisfying than is the tiresome act of dragging a modern multi-blade cartridge across one&#x27;s face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Each set up resulted in silky smooth, super-close shaves with next to zero irritation.&lt;br</li>
      <li>to the very agressive Merkur Futur (set to 4).</li>
      <li>Very close shave with no burn or irritation.</li>
      <li>I really could not tell any difference except for the price</li>
      <li>That said SI&#x27;s are \\&quot;ABSOLUTELY</li>
      <li>I have tried these against the real super iridiums and I can say that they are not as sharp, but about 95% of the way there.  </li>
      <li>Also, these PolSilver Super Iridium blades last much longer.</li>
      <li>Gillette 7 O&#x27;clock Russian Super Platinum (7 O&#x27;clock blues) blades are no longer made.</li>
      <li>With the Polisilver Super Iridiums, I did not have the same experience.</li>
      <li>So dulling from corrosion is hurting my total shave yield per blade more than actual dulling from wear.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve only tried the Super Iridium.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I understand the absurdity of my quest, but my healthy contrarian streak is constantly urging me to find something different...</li>
      <li>Highly recommend anyone try these if working with a safety razor.</li>
      <li>I use for my shaving ritual:&lt;br /&gt;Merkur Futur Razor (I rotate with a Merkur Progress Long Handle)&lt;br /&gt;Polisiver Super Iridium DE Razor Blades&lt;br /&gt;Mitchells Wool Fat Shaving Soap</li>
      <li>Smooth and sharp shaving blades.</li>
      <li>Polsilver SI, is without a doubt, my new go-to blade.</li>
      <li>I use these blades with pre-shave oil, a good shave cream, and proper technique, I can get a super-smooth super-close shave in less than five minutes total time.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not hip to all of the shaving message board lingo, but if I were someone more comfortable with making myself look silly</li>
      <li>They are very sharp, extremely smooth and give \\&quot;me</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve heard that there are other PolSilver blades besides the Super Iridium.  </li>
      <li>They are about 2.5 times what I was paying for the Israeli blades, but on the other hand, they aren&#x27;t even 1/10th the cost of Gillette Proglide Fusion blades, so it was easy not to worry that buying these was making me into the last of the big-time</li>
      <li>Clear audio as it cuts the grain.</li>
      <li>Polsilver blades  shave as close as Feather blades, but are much smoother and last longer.</li>
      <li>These are the blades you were looking for if you were an old SI devotee.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Gillette 7 O&#x27;clock Russian Super Platinum (7 O&#x27;clock blues) blades are no longer made. This is a nice alternative, but a bit pricey. Excellent blades.</li>
    <li> Getting good DE blades these days is tricky (quality at foreign factories doesn&#x27;t stay constant over time), and you have to cast your net wide. For now, at least, these blades from Poland are the state of the art.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are great blades. They compare favorably to every blade I&#x27;ve used, including high-end Gillettes made in Russia. I&#x27;ve been using generic Israeli Super Stainless blades for about seven years, and when my last box was running out, I did a little research to see what else was out there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are at or near the top of most DE users&#x27; lists of the best blades out there in 2014, from what I could find reading online forums on shave gear. They are about 2.5 times what I was paying for the Israeli blades, but on the other hand, they aren&#x27;t even 1/10th the cost of Gillette Proglide Fusion blades, so it was easy not to worry that buying these was making me into the last of the big-time spenders.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t do much to dry my blades after a shave, because I&#x27;m lazy. So dulling from corrosion is hurting my total shave yield per blade more than actual dulling from wear. I&#x27;m getting four shaves out of each blade right now, and could push it further, but I&#x27;m enjoying the luxury too much. But I&#x27;m not shaving daily; I think a person who shaved daily could get a week out of each blade before corrosion robbed him of the highest quality shaves. A person who dried out the innards of his razor with a hair dryer, or opened up the razor every time to wipe down the blade with a towel, might go a lot longer. But that seems like a lot of work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To me, these are the perfect balance of sharp and smooth. They tell me just the right pressure to apply -- very light, but still allowing for a decent-length, full contact stroke.</li>
    <li> When I went to Double Edge wet shaving, I tried a variety pack of different blades.  The Pol Silver SI Blades were the best of the lot; very sharp, and very smooth.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a new DE shaver so take my comments as such. I&#x27;ve collected all the blades (as a hobby) and I&#x27;m in search for the one that suits me best.  I have a medium-coarse beard and my first blade of choice was the Feather blade.  Ouch...was that a mistake.  They&#x27;re wonderful blades, but they ate my face! (My inexperience I&#x27;m sure).  Week two, I moved to the Derby blades because I heard they&#x27;re not as sharp. The shaving experience was mediocre - like a cartridge razor, but no bleeding.  This week started the PolSilver blades and at first I thought there wasn&#x27;t a blade in the razor?!? It took three passes and this has been the closest shave that I&#x27;ve ever had in my life.  Next week will be the Astra&#x27;s, so I will be able to determine their likeness.  Regardless, I have a life-supply of blades and considering what I was paying a month in cartridge blades, my testing isn&#x27;t frivolous.</li>
    <li> The blades are really sharp and give excellent shaves. Personna med preps are cheaper but comparable quality.</li>
    <li> A great blade. Always performs well. Great glide on almost any lather. Clear audio as it cuts the grain. A bit more costly but worth the price. Good shaving to you.</li>
    <li> Smooth and sharp shaving blades. A bit pricier thanother DE blades, but higher quality. I go with an Astra SP for daily shaves and pop in these for a treat and change up now and then.  If you liked the old Russian Iridium blades, you will like these. They feel like the same blade. Longevity is about 5 multi pass shaves, which is what I get from the Astra SPs too, but the Iridiums have a smoother feel to them. Are they worth the price? Maybe.  I feel it&#x27;s worth it to have some on hand and they are still cheaper than cartidges.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t by Mach3 razors when these are dirt cheap and work 100,000,000x better.  If you want, buy these and shave.  If you don&#x27;t want grow a beard.  Beards are manly anyway.</li>
    <li> I have been using Feathers for awhile and find them hard to beat. Astra razor blades made in the same factory as these cost much less and are excellent blades. I can get as close a shave with any blade. The big difference is how long will they give a good shave before they start tugging. I get about 5 shaves, the same as the Feathers. And 3 with the Astra&#x27;s. Also are these the same as the old Pol silvers? I don&#x27;t know, but the old blades where double rapped. These are single wrapped.&lt;br /&gt;If you want the most from your money and have to feed the kids buy the Astra s. I rarely splurge on higher priced things, and this is why. These come on a card meat for store use, that is fine, it is just a little different Will I buy them again, no I think the Feathers are a much better value and just as good a blade, maybe better..&lt;br /&gt;Oh and do they have any Iridium? there is no info any I can find on the web that says there is. It is a very rare and expensive element. I have gotten it on the tip of a fountain pen tip(nib) that comes from Germany, and it says so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: by mistake I used a Astra blade thinking it was a Pol Silver. I really could not tell any difference except for the price so I did some research.&lt;br /&gt;From the Pol Silver. Razor Polsilver Super Iridium - cpl. 5 pc Dual blades are coated with platinum and chromium, provide a safe and practical shave.&lt;br /&gt;http://dobreprodukty.pl/polsilver-zyletka-super-iridium-5-szt--pid750650&lt;br /&gt;Using Google translate.&lt;br /&gt;Astra has the same coatings so make your own decision. I can say I would have the 300 Astras rather than the 100 Pol slivers. I can buy Astras from the bay for 9.80 per 100.&lt;br /&gt;I think part of the reason for the higher price is they are harder to come by for the seller,the other price being hype. Feel free to disagree but that is my opinion of them.&lt;br /&gt;PPI Russia makes at least 10 different blades. Do you think they use different process on each blade or just different artwork for each name?</li>
    <li> These are lasting me about 7-10 days each, and when I replace them I&#x27;m not really noticing any reduction in sharpness.</li>
    <li> Not as sharp as the feather DE blades</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d like to start by saying that I have actively been searching, for about a year, for a solution to my &#x27;Feather Problem&#x27;. Feathers are great blades. The best I&#x27;d used...so what&#x27;s the problem? Call it silly or childish, but \\&quot;the cult of feather\\&quot; annoys me. I understand the absurdity of my quest, but my healthy contrarian streak is constantly urging me to find something different...outside of the box....better. So, about a month ago I rolled the dice on 100 Polsilver blades.&lt;br /&gt;Because of its reputation as a very sharp blade, I first used the Polsilver in my least aggressive razor, the merkur long handled. I know this sounds incredibly cliche but, on my first pass I checked, twice, to make sure the blade was inserted correctly because it was that smooth. Absolutely effortless! For the first time in my shaving career, I could have comfortably walked out the door with a one pass shave. I went 3 passes and it was as close to a perfect shave as I&#x27;ve ever experienced. I&#x27;m not hip to all of the shaving message board lingo, but if I were someone more comfortable with making myself look silly I&#x27;d refer to it as \\&quot;BBS\\&quot; or something else that is equally sophomoric.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used this blade in every razor that I own...from mild merkur long handle, EJ89, Feather Popular....to the agressive merkur slant, razorock little bastone....to the very agressive Merkur Futur (set to 4). Each set up resulted in silky smooth, super-close shaves with next to zero irritation.&lt;br /&gt;The Polsilver SI, is without a doubt, my new go-to blade.</li>
    <li> Two double edge razor blades vie for recognition as the best blade, and Polsilver wins fans for its smoothness and consistency. The best price for 100 blades is usually around $25, though quoted prices range to as high as $40.</li>
    <li> I just finished my first batch of 100. I have sensitive skin, and ingrown hair on my neck and cheek. With these, they completely disappeared after 4 weeks of using these blades 3x a week. 100 is enough to treat these as single use blades. I probably average 1 nick every 2 weeks, which I can live with.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m surprised I&#x27;m the first to write a review on these wonderful Russian blades. After using SI&#x27;s for several months I can say they are simply the BEST blade I&#x27;ve tried so far. For my face these blades have ALL the attributes you could want for a really nice shave. They are very sharp, extremely smooth and give \\&quot;me at least\\&quot; a weeks worth of close, irritation free shaves. I&#x27;m glad I bought a bulk order.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BUT like everything else they do have a \\&quot;darkside\\&quot; the PRICE\\&quot;!! These blade are in the Feather price range and I haven&#x27;t found them anywhere appreciately cheaper than they are here on Amazon. While still a deal compared to carts, they are rather pricey compared to other good blades. That said SI&#x27;s are \\&quot;ABSOLUTELY the BEST blades\\&quot; I&#x27;ve EVER used!! I.M.O. you should buy a 5 blade pack and give them a try. First check out some other reviews for these blades on the shave forums such as The Shave Den and B&amp;B, so you can get other opinions...</li>
    <li> If you were a fan of the Super Iridiums that quietly vanished from the market a few years ago, these are their encore performance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having always felt that the Super Iridiums of years past were the smoothest, longest lasting blades I&#x27;d found; I was deeply disappointed that I hadn&#x27;t built a large cache of them before they disappeared.  I did have enough though to still have some when I found these and have been able to shave with them side by side. These are the blades you were looking for if you were an old SI devotee.</li>
    <li> I began using an old-fashioned double-edge safety razor several months ago.  I&#x27;ve tested a number of blades.  Each brand and model of blade works differently on my face.  Of the blades I&#x27;ve tried thus far, the PolSilver Super Iridium is my favorite.  It combines sharpness, smoothness, and durability.  PolSilver is a Polish brand that was purchased by Gillette.  Production of PolSilver blades was moved to a big razor-blade factory in St. Petersburg, Russia, which is a joint venture between Gillette and a Russian company, with Gillette owning the majority of the venture.  PolSilver blades are intended for the Polish market, which is why the labeling on the package is in Polish.  I&#x27;ve heard that there are other PolSilver blades besides the Super Iridium.  I&#x27;ve only tried the Super Iridium.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I use these blades with pre-shave oil, a good shave cream, and proper technique, I can get a super-smooth super-close shave in less than five minutes total time.  I get a much better shave than what I was getting with my Gillette Mach 3 cartridge razor, and at a tiny fraction of the cost.  And shaving with a safety razor is a lot more fun and satisfying than is the tiresome act of dragging a modern multi-blade cartridge across one&#x27;s face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The downside of the PolSteel Super Iridium blades (and many other double-edge blade brands, for that matter) is the packaging.  They come in a tiny paper box with no slot for used blade disposal, and the individual blade wrappers are a bit of a pain to remove.  But I now have a blade bank for disposing of used blades, and the unwrapping is but a minor inconvenience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Incidentally, the best blade packaging I&#x27;ve found is that of the Western Family Stainless blades.  I don&#x27;t know who makes these blades, but the packing is identical to that of a Persona blade I plan to try.  It&#x27;s an old-fashioned metal package that allows one to push the blade directly onto the razor without having to actually handle the blade.  Theblades are not wrapped, and the package has a built-in blade bank for used blades.  I wish Gillette would consider using this type of packaging for the various brands it now manufactures.  In the early 1960s, such packaging was standard for all double-edge razor blades sold in the United States.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Besides PolSilver Super Iridium, I&#x27;ve tested the following other blades, listed in the order of how well they perform on my face and beard:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gillette 7 O&#x27;Clock Super Stainless&lt;br /&gt;Feather Hi-Stainless&lt;br /&gt;Western Family Stainless&lt;br /&gt;Bluebird&lt;br /&gt;Gillette Platinum&lt;br /&gt;Bic Chrome Platinum&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I intend to try other blades.  I&#x27;ve heard good things about the Gillette 7 O&#x27;Clock SharpEdge and look forward to testing it.  But, at the present time, I&#x27;m extremely satisfied with the PolSilver Super Iridium blade.  Some reviewers have speculated that these two blades are exactly identical but are merely marketed under different names.  Both are made by Gillette in St. Petersburg.</li>
    <li> Ridiculously sharp, up there with feathers.  Smooth, but not all that forgiving.  They are good blades, just be careful.  Like!</li>
    <li> These are the best blades I have found for my face!</li>
    <li> Polsilver blades  shave as close as Feather blades, but are much smoother and last longer.</li>
    <li> I have tried these against the real super iridiums and I can say that they are not as sharp, but about 95% of the way there.  There is a small difference between good and great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They are worth the investment to get a nice sharp blade that is comfortable to use.  I also have used several of the modern made blades and these are at the top of my list.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My beard is thick and I get about two good shaves from these.  Others may get 3-4 good shaves per blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Happy shopping!</li>
    <li> The best blade for MY face. I have been wet shaving for over ten years. I was a big fan of Feather DE razors because of the close shaves (they are very sharp), but my skin was always irritated and burned afterwards. With the Polisilver Super Iridiums, I did not have the same experience. Very close shave with no burn or irritation. I have been shaving with them for over a week now and the shaves are very consistent: very close and very comfortable. Shaving is a very personal experience and everyones face is different. I would recommend buying the assorted razor blade packs found on Amazon in order to experiment.&lt;br /&gt;What I use for my shaving ritual:&lt;br /&gt;Merkur Futur Razor (I rotate with a Merkur Progress Long Handle)&lt;br /&gt;Polisiver Super Iridium DE Razor Blades&lt;br /&gt;Mitchells Wool Fat Shaving Soap&lt;br /&gt;Proraso Aftershave</li>
    <li> Best double edge money can buy.  Highly recommend anyone try these if working with a safety razor.</li>
    <li> Extremely smooth blades. Some of my most comfortable shaves have come from them. Here&#x27;s the thing with blades. Don&#x27;t listen to the negative people. Blades are subjective. Something that might be great for you might be horrible for me. So try them out.</li>
    <li> I have tried 20 different blades now searching for a blade that is very sharp, smooth, and lasts a long time.  This blade is the best I have found.  Feathers and Astra Superior Platinums are on par with this for sharpness.  But those blades are too harsh for me.  Also, these PolSilver Super Iridium blades last much longer.</li>
