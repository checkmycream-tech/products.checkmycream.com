### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>This is an excellent product.</li>
      <li>This product works great!</li>
      <li>Hydroxatone is a great product!  </li>
      <li>Great value.</li>
      <li>It is a good mositurizer but nothing for wrinkle reduction.</li>
      <li>thought this box was a good deal.</li>
      <li>Good Products.  </li>
      <li>A great bargain to get all the item I use and love.</li>
      <li>this is great and leaves your skin so smooth and soft.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Although, I have used the Eye Cream and It is effective.  </li>
      <li>products exactly as described, and a good price!</li>
      <li>/&gt;The under eye cream is not creamy and is like wax and does not go on good at all and pulls the tender skin under the eye.&lt;br /&gt;The am pm anti wrinkle cream with moisturizer does not go on smoothly</li>
      <li>just wish it was more creamier</li>
      <li>will order more again</li>
      <li>The moisturizer is ok.  </li>
      <li>i love you hydroxytone you have made my life awsome</li>
      <li>I am really enjoying the products.</li>
      <li>I love this product.</li>
      <li>and it does work pretty good</li>
      <li>anti wrinkle .5 is very nice and makes your skin feel very soft after it</li>
      <li>so it would go on more smoothly</li>
      <li>Good Price and Fast Shipping.</li>
      <li>I LOVE that it does not cause my skin to break out as I have very very sensitive skin, and I also love the fragrance.</li>
      <li>i could see the difference right away</li>
      <li>I love what it instantly does to my skin.</li>
      <li>When I received the order, two of the creams had gotten too hot before it was delivered and was unusable.  </li>
      <li>Your skin will look smoother, more supple and elastic and overall radiant.</li>
      <li>Love this product and have used it regularly for several years...keeps skin wrinkle free and supple.</li>
      <li>That little bottle with the pump is like magic!  </li>
      <li>No dramatic difference.</li>
      <li>Microdermabrasion: Exfoliating cream with pure high-grade micronized magnesium oxide crystals</li>
      <li>really like this product</li>
      <li>Very disapointed</li>
      <li>so disapointed I was really looking forward to see the results...</li>
      <li>I really wanted to see results</li>
      <li>Thanks.  </li>
      <li>It makes my skin pretty soft.</li>
      <li>This may have been new about 5 years ago!  </li>
      <li>The eye cream was so dry, I couldn&#x27;t get my finger in the container to get some of the cream out and apply it, it looked like a ball of wax and the whole thing slid out leaving the container clean....</li>
      <li>when I have AM PM on alone and lightly dabbed on top of my makeup, almost daily at least one person comments on my radiant complexion.  </li>
      <li>Not knocking the product, but this appears to be very old stock.</li>
      <li>I always notice a difference when I use higher quality facial creams.  </li>
      <li>DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM AS THEY ARE SELLING OLD EXPIRED CREAM!</li>
      <li>The sample packets I got earlier worked great but the little bottle is not the same as the sample product of the 90 second</li>
      <li>Order from Hydroxatone direct.</li>
      <li>They keep my skin soft and hydrated.</li>
      <li>and I really haven&#x27;t seen any lasting results.</li>
      <li>The products are old and the eye crème crumbled and was not useable.  </li>
      <li>the am/pm complex and exfolilating cream are fine.</li>
      <li>used hydroxatone several years ago and liked it but company required monthly shipments and that got too expensive.</li>

<li> If you have dry skin and need an instant boost then this is for you!</li>
<li> I cannot use the other items, so I will order only the tube of Hydroxatone and the Eye Cream in the future.</li>
<li> too bad, i would have liked to try it out.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
<li> The creams made my face more oily and broke me out not to mention the smell was bad.</li>
<li> The wrinkle reducer container is empty.  </li>
<li> Whenever I run out and just use some run of the mill product, thinking that it does not really make a difference, I see the changes in my skin.  </li>
<li> so basically it&#x27;s garbage, the stop wrinkle cream was an empty container.</li>
<li> was the same hard as a rock.</li>
<li> The am/pm Cream came leaking so that all that was left was a hard clump of white stuff, the under eye cream was hard and you couldnt even get it out of the container.</li>
<li> The rest seems to work well on dark circles.</li>
<li> Not worth the sale price</li>
<li> The under eye gel seems dried out.  </li>
<li> the hydrolyze is too dried up to use.</li>
<li> I use it, but see no difference after a few weeks use.  </li>
<li> The night cream is thick and abrasive, the eye cream does nothing at all for the dark circles</li>
<li> The jars can be difficult to open</li>
<li> I received this product and the eye cream was hard as a rock and could not be use.</li>
<li> The under-eye serum was hard, but I scraped some off with my fingernail, and tried it anyway.  </li>
<li> No contact from seller when I wrote a complaint.</li>
<li> I didn&#x27;t try it until now and its too late to exchange it.</li>
<li> eye cream was so thick it could not be applied without adding lotion to it.</li>
<li> It is very thick and hard to spread.  </li>
<li> It goes on like rubber on my skin, its very hard to put it on.</li>
<li> Very poor quality.</li>
<li> Don&#x27;t know if it was because the heat got to it or just a bad product but no difference for me.</li>
<li> I was disappointed by the cream.  </li>
<li> This product was very disappointing</li>
<li> I was very disappointed with the purchase.  </li>

    <li> the only saving grace in this kit is the microdermabrasion scrub. The creams made my face more oily and broke me out not to mention the smell was bad.</li>
    <li> I use it, but see no difference after a few weeks use.  I LOVE that it does not cause my skin to break out as I have very very sensitive skin, and I also love the fragrance.</li>
    <li> Microdermabrasion: Exfoliating cream with pure high-grade micronized magnesium oxide crystals this is great and leaves your skin so smooth and soft.&lt;br /&gt;The under eye cream is not creamy and is like wax and does not go on good at all and pulls the tender skin under the eye.&lt;br /&gt;The am pm anti wrinkle cream with moisturizer does not go on smoothly&lt;br /&gt;Am Pm anti wrinkle .5 is very nice and makes your skin feel very soft after it dries.&lt;br /&gt;I really like this product and it does work pretty good just wish it was more creamier so it would go on more smoothly&lt;br /&gt;I will order more again</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product.</li>
    <li> I am really enjoying the products. They keep my skin soft and hydrated. I will have to buy again.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t recommend purchasing this product from Amazon.  The products are old and the eye crème crumbled and was not useable.  Hydroxatone is a great product!  I was very disappointed with the purchase.  Order from Hydroxatone direct.</li>
    <li> This product works great! products exactly as described, and a good price! I would definitely buy these again. thank you!</li>
    <li> I received this product and the eye cream was hard as a rock and could not be use. I returned it for a replacement and I received the return item and the eye cream was the same hard as a rock. DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM AS THEY ARE SELLING OLD EXPIRED CREAM!</li>
    <li> when I have AM PM on alone and lightly dabbed on top of my makeup, almost daily at least one person comments on my radiant complexion.  Although I have avoided sun and that such, I am 62 and give Hydroxatone all the credit.  Thanks.  A five yr on/off user.  Gina</li>
    <li> The wrinkle reducer container is empty.  I didn&#x27;t try it until now and its too late to exchange it. too bad, i would have liked to try it out.&lt;br /&gt;I like the microdermabrasion product.  It makes my skin pretty soft. The under eye gel seems dried out.  It goes on like rubber on my skin, its very hard to put it on. The moisturizer is ok.  No dramatic difference.</li>
    <li> The eye cream was so dry, I couldn&#x27;t get my finger in the container to get some of the cream out and apply it, it looked like a ball of wax and the whole thing slid out leaving the container clean....so disapointed I was really looking forward to see the results...</li>
    <li> I always notice a difference when I use higher quality facial creams.  Whenever I run out and just use some run of the mill product, thinking that it does not really make a difference, I see the changes in my skin.  Hydroxatone definitely delivers what it promises.  Your skin will look smoother, more supple and elastic and overall radiant.</li>
    <li> That little bottle with the pump is like magic!  The rest seems to work well on dark circles.</li>
    <li> When I received the order, two of the creams had gotten too hot before it was delivered and was unusable.  The Beauty Boxes were ordered by mistake.  My husband misunderstood the directions when ordering.  He meant to order the larger tube of Hydroxatone only.  Although, I have used the Eye Cream and It is effective.  I cannot use the other items, so I will order only the tube of Hydroxatone and the Eye Cream in the future.</li>
    <li> A great bargain to get all the item I use and love.</li>
    <li> Product melted and leaked in plastic. eye cream was so thick it could not be applied without adding lotion to it. Don&#x27;t know if it was because the heat got to it or just a bad product but no difference for me. The 15 second wrinkle remover also showed no results.</li>
    <li> The jars can be difficult to open and I really haven&#x27;t seen any lasting results. It is a good mositurizer but nothing for wrinkle reduction. Also, the product causes my eyes to water.</li>
    <li> I was disappointed by the cream.  It is very thick and hard to spread.  I really wanted to see results but I hesitate to use it for these reasons.</li>
    <li> This may have been new about 5 years ago!  The oils had separated in the AM/PM cream, leaving an oily glob of goo.  The under-eye serum was hard, but I scraped some off with my fingernail, and tried it anyway.  It wouldn&#x27;t absorb.  I would never buy from this seller again.</li>
    <li> The night cream is thick and abrasive, the eye cream does nothing at all for the dark circles so basically it&#x27;s garbage, the stop wrinkle cream was an empty container. This product was very disappointing&lt;br /&gt;And I can&#x27;t recommend it at all.</li>
    <li> One of the products in the package was not sealed and had have the product inside. I have opened it and did not notice the last product not sealed until after. Karen Boucher</li>
    <li> 90 second wrinkle cream pump broke after only 3 applications and felt like sticky jelly when applied. The under eye cream was the consistency of play doh so couldn&#x27;t be applied at all. Very poor quality. Not worth the sale price let alone the regular price. No contact from seller when I wrote a complaint. Avoid!!</li>
    <li> It does not do what it claims  I see no difference in my appearance or skin tone Will not recommend this product</li>
    <li> used hydroxatone several years ago and liked it but company required monthly shipments and that got too expensive. thought this box was a good deal. the am/pm complex and exfolilating cream are fine. the 90 second wrinkle reducer will not dispense; one tiny drop and that was it. the hydrolyze is too dried up to use. Not knocking the product, but this appears to be very old stock.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work!  The sample packets I got earlier worked great but the little bottle is not the same as the sample product of the 90 second</li>
    <li> Love this product and have used it regularly for several years...keeps skin wrinkle free and supple.</li>
    <li> The am/pm Cream came leaking so that all that was left was a hard clump of white stuff, the under eye cream was hard and you couldnt even get it out of the container. Very disapointed</li>
    <li> If you have dry skin and need an instant boost then this is for you! I love what it instantly does to my skin.</li>
    <li> i love you hydroxytone you have made my life awsome i could see the difference right away thank you for everything</li>
    <li> Great value. I love this product.</li>
    <li> Good Products.  Good Price and Fast Shipping.</li>
    <li> I have only been using this product for about a week now, however,  I notice a difference with my skin already.  I shall be purchasing this item again in the future.</li>
