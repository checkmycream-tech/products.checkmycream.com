      <li>Holds you hair back really good</li>
      <li>They&#x27;re a good length; not too long.</li>
      <li>the old fashioned strong headbands and the newer cheap &amp; flimsy &amp;#34;can&#x27;t hold a thing&amp;#34; headbands.  </li>
      <li>These are pretty good, even if they&#x27;re not as durable as the old ones from way back when.  </li>
      <li>All 3 items broke on first use.</li>
      <li>Fast Shipping!</li>
      <li>I tried putting the first one around my head and it snapped.</li>
      <li>but I was turned off by the snags in the plastic in the first one I tried.</li>
      <li>The first one I broke befor</li>
      <li>Two of the three headbands broke the first time I used them.</li>
      <li>I  looked for this for years and finally found it, the perfect black stretch headband!!</li>
      <li>The same is still true!</li>
      <li>but I found it super cheap to just break in half like that right away.</li>
      <li>These don&#x27;t stretch out nearly as fast as the ones you buy in the store, maybe not at all as I am still using these.</li>
      <li>Thanks to amazon I found these again</li>
      <li>This product is flexible and durable allowing me to quickly pull my hair back and keep moving.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know if they use a better plastic or manufacture differently, but they are the same as the brand name headbands but with no breakage or stretching out of shape.</li>
      <li>They arrived quickly, well packaged, and were exactly what I expected.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had this type of headband in the past, but these are much more flimsy and the hook doesn&#x27;t hold well.</li>
      <li>Works just like the old ones I had.</li>
      <li>When I was younger i wore these like they were going out of style, then as I got older they started to disappear from the stores.</li>
      <li>Finding a strong, flexible headband has been a challenge lately.  </li>
      <li>can barely feel it in my hair during the day.</li>
      <li>Throw back old school hair do.  </li>
      <li>Bought several sets as cheaper than others and found that quality was poor and broke easily.</li>
      <li>They hold my thick hair back when its down and they also looks cute in a pony tail.</li>

<li> Now I can get lots of fluff.</li>

<li> (now I know to unfasten it, put it carefully along my hairline, clasp it, and slowly move it into my hair)</li>
<li> It&#x27;s hard to find these in the stores these days.</li>
<li> but I have THICK hair...</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> 1 lasted a week, the other 2 broke when I went to put on</li>
    <li> I like thiis flexible headband, it is perfect for natural hair styles.  I would recommend this product. This is a great gift idea.</li>
    <li> beautifully packaged &amp; promptly shipped, these headbands arrived in the nick of time!  I wear them to keep my curly unmanageable hair under costume hats (hennins, hoods, etc) and can wear them 10 hours with no headache.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well made, they last for years but it&#x27;s always good to have a spare.</li>
    <li> Gave save rating  as other flex comb purchased, with a slight difference -&amp;#62; these didn&#x27;t break on 1st usage .. they&#x27;re stronger</li>
    <li> One of the three just doesn&#x27;t work,  like a previous reviewer stated. But I would buy again. I love this style headband and can&#x27;t find it in the store.</li>
    <li> Just like we had in the 90&#x27;s! gotta love em!</li>
    <li> A very cheap product. The first one I broke befor I use it. There are better product in the store.</li>
    <li> I loved them as a child, but I guess my tastes have changed. Still a great product though.</li>
    <li> When I was younger i wore these like they were going out of style, then as I got older they started to disappear from the stores. Thanks to amazon I found these again and I bought a TON of them. They hold my thick hair back when its down and they also looks cute in a pony tail.</li>
    <li> wife uses this all the time</li>
    <li> I ordered black headbands and got multi colored head bands. On the paper with the info it said \\&quot;colors may vary\\&quot; and it was circled in red pen. No where on the original post did it say that. So I basically got the opposite of what I wanted.</li>
    <li> I have the type of hair that likes to \\&quot;stick\\&quot; to my scalp, giving me no fullness.  My solution:  after shampooing I put this on my head with my hair soaking wet.  Then I blow it dry with the headband still on my head.  Wait a few minutes until everything cools down a bit before removing the headband.  Now I can get lots of fluff.</li>
    <li> Finding a strong, flexible headband has been a challenge lately.  I WOULD RATE THESE IN THE MIDDLE ---between the old fashioned strong headbands and the newer cheap &amp; flimsy &amp;#34;can&#x27;t hold a thing&amp;#34; headbands.  These are pretty good, even if they&#x27;re not as durable as the old ones from way back when.  BONUS: They&#x27;re a good length; not too long.</li>
    <li> Throw back old school hair do.  This product is flexible and durable allowing me to quickly pull my hair back and keep moving.</li>
    <li> My mother-in-law was looking for these and I was thrilled that they were available.  They arrived quickly, well packaged, and were exactly what I expected.  I&#x27;m quite pleased with my purchase.</li>
    <li> Bought several sets as cheaper than others and found that quality was poor and broke easily. Not worth the price.</li>
    <li> These don&#x27;t stretch out nearly as fast as the ones you buy in the store, maybe not at all as I am still using these. I don&#x27;t know if they use a better plastic or manufacture differently, but they are the same as the brand name headbands but with no breakage or stretching out of shape. I will always repurchase from this seller.</li>
    <li> Works just like the old ones I had. Keeps my hair off my face and neck.</li>
    <li> All 3 items broke on first use.</li>
    <li> I opened this package today, took out one headbead and proceeded to unclasp it and it broke. Additionally, the seams of the headband have extra plastic like they are unfinished. I&#x27;ve purchased the name brand of these before and never have I come across this. I think I will be returning these.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this type of headband in the past, but these are much more flimsy and the hook doesn&#x27;t hold well. Don&#x27;t buy these, folks!    Update: Two of the three headbands broke the first time I used them. I am going to toss out the last one, why bother?</li>
    <li> I remember these were IN when I was in middle school and I went to a school where we always had to wear buns and uniform, this gave us a chance to spice up the do from time to time without getting in trouble. Now that my hair is at that long &amp;#34;what do I do with it?&amp;#34; length this is a lifesaver for something simple and chic for the office and changing the typical hairband from time to time.</li>
    <li> I loved these in high school. They were the only head band that would not slide off my head. The same is still true! So glad i found them!</li>
    <li> I tried putting the first one around my head and it snapped. Very cheap. Maybe I dont&#x27; know how to put this on properly (now I know to unfasten it, put it carefully along my hairline, clasp it, and slowly move it into my hair) but I found it super cheap to just break in half like that right away. Good thing there&#x27;s 3 of them. I&#x27;ll see how long the other two last.</li>
    <li> It is stretchy, comfortable, and looks great. Not at all fragile or sharp like it may appear. got lots of compliments</li>
    <li> These are cheap. They didn&#x27;t break but I was turned off by the snags in the plastic in the first one I tried. Snags and hair products don&#x27;t mix.</li>
    <li> Non-Durable, they last about a day a piece.</li>
    <li> I  looked for this for years and finally found it, the perfect black stretch headband!!</li>
    <li> 10 YEARS AGO I USED THEM, THEY ARE GREAT WHILE LETTING YOUR HAIR GROW  OUT AND EVEN BETTER WHEN YOUR HAIR IS LONGER AND CURLY !</li>
    <li> Purchased these for my nieces and they love them.  Thank you!</li>
    <li> Not as heavy duty as in the old days but I have THICK hair...still does what I need it to do...and thicker than some I have seen.</li>
    <li> These are perfect for my natural puffs! They look cheap on screen but they are very good quality and work wonderfully .I can barely feel it in my hair during the day.</li>
    <li> my head fits these well and they keep my hair back real nice</li>
    <li> Holds you hair back really good</li>
    <li> This comb is perfect for keeping my hair back from my face. It&#x27;s hard to find these in the stores these days.</li>
    <li> These are sort of what I was looking for. They get stretched out and don&#x27;t really back in to their shape. The fastener will come undone sometimes while you are wearing it. I had one break on me.</li>
    <li> Fast Shipping! I&#x27;m happy with the product!</li>
    <li> its no good, garbage :{ no even free!!!!!!</li>
    <li> An oldie but a goodie. Can beat the price, works well.</li>
