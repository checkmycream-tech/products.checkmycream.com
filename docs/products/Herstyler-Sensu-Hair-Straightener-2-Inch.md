      <li>Friends who have used it love it too and they have all gone out to buy it after using mine.  </li>
      <li>I know she is satisfied with the iron and had wanted to purchase a Chi.  </li>
      <li>It gives my hair static and does not straighten my hair at all.</li>
      <li>Purchase a better product.</li>
      <li>This product is ok.  </li>
      <li>It makes sense to be that you would want to get the correct tension throughout the product by hold both the top and bottom while sliding it through your hair.    </li>
      <li>I have a 1 inch and 1.75 inch flat iron, both made by Herstyler as well, and I&#x27;m very happy with the product and performance.</li>
      <li>It straightens quick and doesn&#x27;t fry your hair!</li>
      <li>I have straight hair but after using my own it gives me that smooth silky feel</li>
      <li>It heats up fast, differnet heating levels...and works amazingly well with my hair which tends to be frizzy and wavy.</li>
      <li>it would leave my hair feeling silky and smooth.</li>
      <li>I used it it is worth more money .&lt;br /&gt;thanks</li>
      <li>In order for me to get good results on my hair, I have to press the plates together and the covering gets pretty hot.</li>
      <li>It was well worth the price!</li>
      <li>Forever, it worth the battle!</li>
      <li>It is one of the most inexpensive flat irons I&#x27;ve ever purchased but its definitely the best.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s clearly the best flat iron ever.  </li>
      <li>I was excited to get such a good deal on this product.</li>
      <li>I have to say this product didn&#x27;t meet my full expectations.</li>
      <li>product, if you get a good deal, but don&#x27;t expect it to last.</li>
      <li>and I have had difficulty finding a product that produced a very smooth, polished look that I have only been able to get at a salon.</li>
      <li>It heats up quickly and I can&#x27;t tell the difference between this product and the CHI I have.</li>
      <li>I like light up display, and it&#x27;s pretty quick to heat up.</li>
      <li>is straight!!</li>
      <li>totally worth it.</li>
      <li>You can log onto the website directly and compare the savings by buying it here on Amazon and shipping is free!</li>
      <li>This one was at a great price and does really good with thick, coarse hair,</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s worth every dime I paid.  </li>
      <li>This is an amazing flat iron.</li>
      <li>This also came with a stand or some kind of pouch to keep the flat iron on or in.  </li>
      <li>I bought it because the price was right</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had this hair straightener for several years now, I use it regularly, and it still works just great.</li>
      <li>I have a long thick colored wavy kinda frizzy hair and it takes me 40min for perfect smooth silky hair.</li>
      <li>is that the ends do get really hot when using it</li>
      <li>Herstyler straightners are so much better than the ones in your local drugstores.</li>
      <li>While I was looking for a wider straightener, I do like the size of this one (this gets so hot you don&#x27;t need the 2\\&quot;).</li>
      <li>Everyone with curly hair---who want straight hair should have one!</li>
      <li>and I paid a pretty penny for it, but</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t have any frizzies and my hair is so soft and smooth.</li>
      <li>it heats up super-fast, gets really really hot, and makes my hair shiny and silky.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend it!!</li>
      <li>The first time it got hot within 2 minutes; after 15 minutes I gave up.</li>
      <li>love the product, i bought the same one two years ago at the mall.</li>
      <li>The flat irons that are sold at the mall Work way better.</li>
      <li>The product is lightweight ( compared to most flat irons), so it doesn&#x27;t bother my tendinitis.</li>
      <li>And also unlike my old straightener, the plates glide across my hair rather smoothly; it doesn&#x27;t snag nearly as much.</li>
      <li>and she still has it and uses it pretty much every day.  </li>
      <li>My cheap one from the store lasted years, but it took several passes to get the hair straight.</li>
      <li>Fast shipping .</li>
      <li>I purchased this hair straightener and because of the reviews I thought it was going to be perfect for my not so curly hair, but I was wrong, it straights good but doesn&#x27;t last at all, a few hours and my hair gain fluffiness, something not desired.</li>
      <li>If you want straight hair use this period, it will not disappoint.</li>
      <li>bone straight with out</li>
      <li>I found this straightener really by chance, well spend money , ah</li>
      <li>Wavy but not curly or straight.</li>
      <li>With a normal straightener, it could take as many as 3-4 tries per strand to get it straight even on maximum heat.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t spend much and this has the quality of a high end straightener.</li>
      <li>The Sensu took one pass the first time and never would straighten the second time because it wouldn&#x27;t get hot.</li>
      <li>One more thing my wife did not like about this product was there is no additional space at the end of this product to grab and really clamp the hair down like her old product had.  </li>
      <li>It shines and is soft; it works!!</li>
      <li>Tried a couple of times and it seems that it just doesn&#x27;t get hot enough to really truly straigten my hair.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Time to buy a new flatiron, but I won&#x27;t buy another one of these.  </li>
      <li>but after about 6 months it was time for a new one.</li>
      <li>My hair is more healthy, I no longer blow dry before flat ironing, now all I use is this flat iron after letting my hair air dry.</li>
      <li>She said it made her hair very shiny, so we did learn one good thing after buying the wrongly labeled product.    </li>
      <li>I had the first one for total 2 years and had I not dropped it</li>
      <li>that said, i always got my straighteners at walmart before, so some might say my standards were pretty low...</li>
      <li>Especially when they lied in the first place about the size.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have to warn you, I&#x27;ve only had this flat iron for a few days, it just came in the mail about a week ago. However, as of now I&#x27;m super happy with it. It is one of the most inexpensive flat irons I&#x27;ve ever purchased but its definitely the best. Its heats up to 430F and it makes my thick, frizzy hair smooth, sleek, and shiny. I bought it because the price was right and I&#x27;m very impressed with what it can do. I&#x27;ve never had a flat iron work so well on my hair. I highly recommend it!!</li>
    <li> This product is ok.  It straighten the hair but the plates on the pair I have does not completely touch when they are closed.  In order for me to get good results on my hair, I have to press the plates together and the covering gets pretty hot.</li>
    <li> but instead i get the same results with my 26.00 flat iron.&lt;br /&gt;It doesnt do anything for my hair even on the highest setting. I was thinking it was just the products i was using on my hair with the flat iron but i was so wrong.  I will never recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping . Great Item . I used it it is worth more money .&lt;br /&gt;thanks</li>
    <li> this flat iron does wonders, i have curly hair that fizz alot during the warm, windy, and rainy weather it straightings my hair  bone straight with out it frizzing when i go outside and it hides my split ends that i need to cut. i highly recommend this flat iron. once you straighten your hair you do not need to touch up untill your next wash(if you keep hair tied at night) if you want to straighten it again</li>
    <li> i can&#x27;t say anything bad about this product. it heats up super-fast, gets really really hot, and makes my hair shiny and silky. that said, i always got my straighteners at walmart before, so some might say my standards were pretty low...but, if you are looking for a nicer straightener for a good price, you cant go wrong with this one!</li>
    <li> The Sensu works just as good as the Herstyler Forever, it worth the battle! I have permed long hair, so I don&#x27;t like to apply much heat on it because it will damage it. But with the Sensu, it straightens fast and keeps the same temperature at all times. And it doesn&#x27;t take me very long to do my hair neither. The product is lightweight ( compared to most flat irons), so it doesn&#x27;t bother my tendinitis.</li>
    <li> I bought this flat iron hopeing it would leave my hair feeling silky and smooth. It did that and then some! I don&#x27;t have any frizzies and my hair is so soft and smooth. It was well worth the price!</li>
    <li> That she cancelled her hair appointment.  This also came with a stand or some kind of pouch to keep the flat iron on or in.  Very happy with the purchase.</li>
    <li> This is my second Herstyler and that is only because I dropped the first one on my sink then on my stone floor, it still kept working but after about 6 months it was time for a new one. I had the first one for total 2 years and had I not dropped it I think it would have lasted longer. Non the less I have unpermed hair, tight cork srew, but with this flat iron with one pass my hair is straight!! It shines and is soft; it works!! Trust me I have tried all the products out there and this one works and does what is says. My hair is more healthy, I no longer blow dry before flat ironing, now all I use is this flat iron after letting my hair air dry. If you want straight hair use this period, it will not disappoint.</li>
    <li> I have had this hair straightener for over a year, and it is still working perfectly. I can create some wonderful styles with it. Best straightener I have ever used. Beats the more expensive ones!</li>
    <li> The Sensu is the best hair straightener I have ever used.  It straightens quick and doesn&#x27;t fry your hair! It wins hands down against all others!</li>
    <li> I bought this Flat Iron about 4 years ago and it is still going and I have had no problems with it what so ever.  It&#x27;s clearly the best flat iron ever.  Friends who have used it love it too and they have all gone out to buy it after using mine.  My hair looks silky and shiny after using it.  I have very kinky hair due to some medications I am on and this flat iron does the trick every time.  I wish they made it in a one inch as well.  I purchased mine from a kiosk in the mall and I paid a pretty penny for it, but it&#x27;s worth every dime I paid.  The only con I have with it is that the ends do get really hot when using it so you have to be careful not to burn yourself.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m quite surprised that among all the reviews, no one has commented that the plates are actually 1.5 inches wide, not 2 inches wide as advertised.  It even incorrectly states 2 inches on the box.  I am going to have to return this flat iron for one that is truly 2 inches wide.    I have a 1 inch and 1.75 inch flat iron, both made by Herstyler as well, and I&#x27;m very happy with the product and performance.</li>
    <li> I purchased this hair straightener and because of the reviews I thought it was going to be perfect for my not so curly hair, but I was wrong, it straights good but doesn&#x27;t last at all, a few hours and my hair gain fluffiness, something not desired.</li>
    <li> I was excited to get such a good deal on this product. Tried a couple of times and it seems that it just doesn&#x27;t get hot enough to really truly straigten my hair. Besides the temp issue, no other complaints</li>
    <li> I purchased this as a gift for my sister. She has coarse, kinky and curly hair. The other straightner she use would make her hair straight but look dry and dull after using and split her ends. I seen her yesterday and after just a month of using of this straightner her hair looks beautiful healthy, shiny and smooth. I couldn&#x27;t believe the results it has given her. I ordered this paticular one for her because of the reviews I read for her hair type. She is very happy with the results. My own experience is that I love herstyler. I have straight hair but after using my own it gives me that smooth silky feel and it doesn&#x27;t split my ends at all. I purchase the wet to dry (gold one) on Amazon. I have lots of hair and it takes me about 15mins to straigten it all.  Herstyler straightners are so much better than the ones in your local drugstores. You will not be disappointed if you buy this brand! You can log onto the website directly and compare the savings by buying it here on Amazon and shipping is free!</li>
    <li> I received this as a Christmas gift. It does come in a very nice box. However, tt is NOT 2\\&quot;, the plates are 1.5\\&quot;. When I used it the first time, it worked PERFECTLY. After it cooled completely, I carefully it put back in the box with the cord folded as when it was delievered. I put the plastic covers over the plates to keep them from being scratched. When I pulled it out to use the second time, it wouldn&#x27;t heat up past the second setting. The first time it got hot within 2 minutes; after 15 minutes I gave up. I hardly got any heat!! My hair is \\&quot;normal\\&quot;. Wavy but not curly or straight. My cheap one from the store lasted years, but it took several passes to get the hair straight. The Sensu took one pass the first time and never would straighten the second time because it wouldn&#x27;t get hot. It&#x27;s being sent back. Mine may have been a \\&quot;bad egg\\&quot; but unfortunately I don&#x27;t care to give it second chance. Especially when they lied in the first place about the size.</li>
    <li> I bought this product about a year ago, and it worked well for some time. I like light up display, and it&#x27;s pretty quick to heat up. Came in a nice box with a felt cover thats good for travel. However, after a few months of use, one of the plates fell off. It&#x27;s dangling by the wire inside. I tried to glue it back but didn&#x27;t last. I contacted Herstyler and they said its the manufacture that must do the lifetime warranty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ok product, if you get a good deal, but don&#x27;t expect it to last.</li>
    <li> I tried a friend&#x27;s Sensu and it was amazing! I immediately made the purchase and the results exceeded my expectations. My hair is naturally wavy and I have had difficulty finding a product that produced a very smooth, polished look that I have only been able to get at a salon. The Sensu gives me salon-style results and has already paid for itself. I recommend this product to anyone who would like a smooth, salon-style beautiful look! Amazing!</li>
    <li> love the product, i bought the same one two years ago at the mall. it was 150 dollars, and then i bought it here for this price and practically is the same thing but cheaper. i totally recommended</li>
    <li> This is an amazing flat iron. Everyone with curly hair---who want straight hair should have one! I love mine! :)</li>
    <li> Worked great! It lasted a year before it died. Purchased another HerStyler, just not this model.</li>
    <li> I have to say this product didn&#x27;t meet my full expectations. It doesn&#x27;t heat up to the proper temperature. I threw the box away and have a newborn otherwise I would have returned it. I bought this specific style since I had the same one and it was great. This one isn&#x27;t the same quality so I&#x27;m not sure if the manufacturer changed the heating settings or if this one in particular is defective. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
    <li> This product is about the quality that you would expect with a price like this, but it is not what is promised. was returned.</li>
    <li> Not what i expected after reading the reviews. The flat irons that are sold at the mall Work way better. 10x ...</li>
    <li> I was initially happy with this flatiron, but it hasn&#x27;t been working for a while now.  1 side doesn&#x27;t heat up at all.  I&#x27;ve had it for just over 2 years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Time to buy a new flatiron, but I won&#x27;t buy another one of these.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this to any of my friends.</li>
    <li> I totally recommend this product. I have a long thick colored wavy kinda frizzy hair and it takes me 40min for perfect smooth silky hair. I found this straightener really by chance, well spend money , ah totally worth it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this hair straightener for several years now, I use it regularly, and it still works just great. It heats up quickly and I can&#x27;t tell the difference between this product and the CHI I have. The different temperature settings is another plus.</li>
    <li> After using this straightener, the difference between a $20 hair straightener and a $150 hair straightener becomes rather obvious; and while I would never spend $150 on a hair product, $40 was a steal for this thing. I have relatively thick hair, and this straightener generally straightens each strand in 1-2 goes, and I don&#x27;t even need to have it on the maximum heat setting. With a normal straightener, it could take as many as 3-4 tries per strand to get it straight even on maximum heat. And also unlike my old straightener, the plates glide across my hair rather smoothly; it doesn&#x27;t snag nearly as much. Awesome product, and I would recommend it to anyone willing to spend the money.</li>
    <li> I love this straightener. It heats up very quickly and takes very little time to get desired hair. It does not feel like it damages the hair at all.</li>
    <li> I ordered this flat iron specifically because it was described at 2 inches wide.  This was not the case it was just over 1 1/4 inches wide.  I was not please at all.  Also, this flat iron does not seem to work as well as the HerStyler flat irons I have purchased before.  I have to go over my hair several times no matter how little hair I put through.  I have been using this flat iron for about 6 months.  I am not particularly please with it.</li>
    <li> I love this straightner! It heats up fast, differnet heating levels...and works amazingly well with my hair which tends to be frizzy and wavy. So if you&#x27;re in the market, go with this or at least the herstyler brand :)</li>
    <li> I purchased this flat iron for my wife on 10/29/2010 and she still has it and uses it pretty much every day.  I think the only other item that we have and use that often is our TV, which should also last for quite some years.  I know she is satisfied with the iron and had wanted to purchase a Chi.  I don&#x27;t think the performance warrants any crazy $$$ purchase, but I wanted to write here to let everyone know that at least this product lasts for some users.  Watch this, I write this review that it has lasted 2 years + and it will break tomorrow...I hope not!</li>
    <li> I just recently ordered this item to replace an older hair straightener.  My wife has very thick hair, and desires a wider product to get the job done quickly.  This product claims to be 2 inches wide, but in reality is less than 1 inch wide.  It might be 2 inches long if you round up.  This product is being returned and I would advise all readers to take heed that this product is not what you think.  One more thing my wife did not like about this product was there is no additional space at the end of this product to grab and really clamp the hair down like her old product had.  It makes sense to be that you would want to get the correct tension throughout the product by hold both the top and bottom while sliding it through your hair.    One thing that was good, and we will be using as I shop for a replacement item was the plates.  She loved the plate composition.  She said it made her hair very shiny, so we did learn one good thing after buying the wrongly labeled product.    One thing is that the product is labeled 2 inches wide from the maker, and not the poster of this.  The manufacturer displays the product as 2 inches wide.</li>
    <li> I love this straightener. The plates are the key- they really make a difference and keeps the frizz down. I noticed a big difference from my old Conair 1\\&quot; straightener.  While I was looking for a wider straightener, I do like the size of this one (this gets so hot you don&#x27;t need the 2\\&quot;). I read a previous review about the straightener not being 2\\&quot; and was ready for this.  I just measured the plates and they aren&#x27;t quite 1 1/2\\&quot;.  Just keep this in mind when ordering.  The cord is even especially thick with a rotating connection to the straightener so no kinking the cord. The box this comes in is very nice- if you are thinking of this as a gift then that is basically how they designed the box (I couldn&#x27;t throw mine away). This is a great buy- I didn&#x27;t spend much and this has the quality of a high end straightener.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.  Flat iron stopped heating up at all in about 8 1/2 months.  Purchase a better product.</li>
    <li> A wonderful price for such a good straightener. I spent 100 dollars plus on a smaller straightener and it barely did well on my hair! This one was at a great price and does really good with thick, coarse hair,</li>
    <li> I love this hair straightener, heats up fast and does a very good job.  Seems like it makes my hair shiney.</li>
    <li> It gives my hair static and does not straighten my hair at all. I have thin hair and i have never had a problem with other irons.</li>
    <li> Have this flat iron for 6 years still works well.</li>
    <li> Bought this and it worked well for almost a year. It died. Manufacturer said that there was a one year warranty. Contacted Amazon and they replaced it. Only odd thing was that Amazon acted like they were doing me a favor by honoring the warranty that their product explicitly states the retailer should honor.</li>
