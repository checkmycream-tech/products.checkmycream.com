      <li>This lips exfoliator is good for the price it sells for.</li>

      <li>Nice product for the price</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s the perfect level of coarseness, and felt like giving my lips a gentle massage.</li>
      <li>And if you make your own, you&#x27;re looking at about 10-20 in start up costs.</li>
      <li>It also has a nice smell, even though you wipe it off</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Ship was faster then I expected. I bought it because my lips were dry, after using it for a couple of days I notice my lips were less dry. The only thing I didn&#x27;t like about it was that the bits and pieces of grain in the lipstick got into my mouth.</li>
    <li> A little grittier than I expected (even for an exfoliator).</li>
    <li> Great stuff n great value</li>
    <li> This lips exfoliator is good for the price it sells for. Its easy to use but can break easily and get dry just after a few uses.</li>
    <li> I decided to drop by Target and buy one for $3, rather than spend $12 and have two left unused products over if I ended up being disappointed. Turns out, I&#x27;m in love. I take care of my lips like nothing else, and I&#x27;m exceptionally picky about what I use. This exfoliates my lips and leaves behind a wonderful, soft balm that smells like buttery, home made cookie dough. It tastes sweet as well. Mind you, the smell isn&#x27;t oppressive at all. I generally prefer fruity scents over sweet scents when it comes to my products, but the sweeter scent wasn&#x27;t a problem in the least.&lt;br /&gt;The product works wonderfully as both a moisturizer and an exfoliator. It has the texture of Burt&#x27;s Bees Beeswax chapstick, and contains granules of brown sugar that do the exfoliating. The first application will feel more like a moisturizing balm, however, since there&#x27;s a thin layer of balm to use before getting to the exfoliating sugar. The package recommends exfoliating and removing the remaining balm, but since it&#x27;s so light and sweet smelling, it works just as well as a leave on product.&lt;br /&gt;Absolutely excellent product! I love it.</li>
    <li> I was hesitant to buy a 3 pack of these without even trying them first, but I am so glad I did! It smells and tastes like sugar, and basically is like a rough sugar scrub in lipstick form. This has saved my lips from being rough and chapped this winter. I&#x27;ll use this before I do my makeup in the morning, and again at night, and top it with coconut oil. Everything sinks right into the lips and they look flawless, healthy and hydrated all the time!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely be repurchasing these!</li>
    <li> oh my god I&#x27;m so addicted to this. it smells like vanilla and there&#x27;s actual sugar in it, plus it&#x27;s in a lipstick container so no more dipping your fingers into your scrub. this is the holy grail for me. can&#x27;t live without it. so happy I could get it in a 3 pack like this :3</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome!&lt;br /&gt;But it&#x27;s literally $1 on elf.com.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Save yourself some money and just go to their website&#x3D;)</li>
    <li> Does the job it is supposed to do but the stick keeps falling out if the holder.</li>
    <li> Perfect. Everything I&#x27;ve ever purchased from e.l.f. has been equal or superior to the super expensive department store brands. It takes a swipe or two to get to the actual scrub, but once you get there it&#x27;s a fantastic product. I have so many issues with chapped lips and after the first use my lips feel brand spanking new. 10/10 would recommend.</li>
    <li> Let me first say that I am the QUEEN of chapped lips. I have a nervous habit of picking and biting at my lips dry skin, which in turn just dries my lips out even more. I read a few reviews on this product and while most people raved, I was a bit reluctant to believe that something for 3 bucks would work that well compared to my $25 Elizabeth Arden balms; HOWEVER, this is hands down that BEST stuff I could have purchased and for $3!! You absolutely cannot beat that. Within minutes, the dry skin on my lips literally softens and my lips feel unbelievably moisturized. I could literally spend hours biting and picking but this stuff heals them in less than a half hour. For you chronic chapped lip people out there - use this and a little Vaseline or moisturizing chapstick over it and your lips will be healed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only con to this product is that the &amp;#34;shape&amp;#34; wears down quickly and sort of rounds off at the top, similar to a used lipstick. Regardless, that is the least of my worries with such an amazing product like this. LOVE LOVE LOVE! highly recommend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;GREAT GOING E.L.F!!</li>
    <li> The best lip scrub I&#x27;ve ever tried! Will not be going back to other lip scrubs - this one is it for me. Good price for a pack of three since these will last a while. Thank you e.l.f. Studio for creating this product!</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome!</li>
    <li> I read the reviews for this product and figured I would like it, so I ordered 3 at once to pay a lower price. For me personally it was too abrasive (or maybe I pressed it too hard to my lips, I don&#x27;t know). So abrasive in fact, after a few uses the corners of my mouth started cracking and my lips felt like the skin had been ripped off. My lips would sting any time I ate something salty or spicy, and I kept having to apply chap stick like twice an hour. And when my skin started to &amp;#34;grow back&amp;#34; my lips were more cracked and chapped then they&#x27;ve ever been, which lasted for 1-2 weeks. I&#x27;ve been afraid to use it again since then. I will say it&#x27;s pretty sleek looking and it doesn&#x27;t taste bad, but even before the trauma my lips went through I didn&#x27;t see much of a difference after the first few uses. I do not recommend this, sorry!</li>
    <li> Sadly this product Did not work. I have tried everything for chapped and cracked lips. It&#x27;s hard to put on bc it has a lipstick style appeal to it. Glad it was cheap bc it doesn&#x27;t work :(</li>
    <li> My lips are always chapped and bleeding especially during the colder months.  I also have an awful habit of picking at them incessantly.  This stuff works wonders!  If you are someone who cannot wear lipstick because your lips are too cracked, this exfoliator is the cure! I&#x27;m finally able to wear my fun lip colors without having chunks of color clinging to the dead skin.  Finally!</li>
    <li> This is my first time ever usung any exfoliatos. I&#x27;ve only had these about a week now but my lips are super soft now. It&#x27;s a bit rough but I kind of expected that. Just make sure you always put a balm on after using this. The only negative is that all three pieces were broken when they arrived.</li>
    <li> Nice product for the price</li>
    <li> Goodbye, chapped lips &amp; hello, baby smooth smackers! This little stick of magic buffs away all the dead skin leaving behind soft lips for the perfect lip gloss/lipstick application. I don&#x27;t know what I would do without it in the winter!</li>
    <li> I am very happy with this product. Makes my lips look nicer and feel smoother. One of the three items arrived broken, though :(. Maybe because it travelled such a long distance (US to Europe!). But I am still very happy with how the product works on my lips.</li>
    <li> great product but it does break VERY easily if rolled too high and applied with the slightest amount of pressure. still use all the time though!</li>
    <li> Okay, so if you can find this item in a store, it only runs approximately 3 bucks for ONE. I ordered here on amazon because the local Target did not have the item at the time (you can look up the store in your area and the system will tell you if it is in stock or otherwise), but I don&#x27;t mind because the price was not gouged all that much (at the original time of purchase, at least...).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Onto the actual product:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fab, period. I&#x27;ve made my own lipscrubs and I&#x27;ve purchased some from luxury companies (LUSH, for example). I find that this product is not only the most affordable option, but it is also one of the LEAST MESSY and MOST EFFECTIVE! This scrub is so easy to use in a lipstick like form. I absolutely love the concept: portability. This is such a great item to have in your purse/makeup-to-go bag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve found that other lipscrubs are WAYYY overpriced. And if you make your own, you&#x27;re looking at about 10-20 in start up costs. You really CAN&#x27;T go wrong here...</li>
    <li> I used  to use a product called Lip Scuff from The Body Shop. The product works pretty well to take dry dead skin off my lips. It&#x27;s not as moisturizing as I I thought it would be. I usually  use a petroleum jelly based lip product afterward.</li>
    <li> I use this all the time when my lips get chapped or cracked, it really helps so when I apply lipstick it looks more smooth.</li>
    <li> Difficult to get out of the tube onto lips at first. I ended up breaking the stick and smashing it into a little plastic jar. Tastes good, though!</li>
    <li> This product is made with lots of sugar granules, however since it starts to melt due to the heat of your lips- the lipstick form isn&#x27;t the best idea. Also I need to use other products in order to fully exfoliate and smooth my lips (q-tip and regular Chapstick tube).  May look for a similar product in a pot.</li>
    <li> I love this already and I just got it!  One use and I&#x27;m absolutely hooked. It feels wonderful, looks classy, tastes sweet, and the smell is good. I couldn&#x27;t figure out at first what the heck it smelled like. Then in the middle of the night it came to me...HOOKAH! Lol. Yep...it&#x27;s like exfoliating your lips with hookah smoke. :D  I say buy it, but buy it somewhere cheaper. That&#x27;s just my advice. Even for a 3 pack, the prices here are kind of high.</li>
    <li> It was a great purchase. The scrub was neithet harsh or gentle and doesnt tastes bad. After a few uses I managed to get extremely soft lips. Just make sure you use a balm after you wash it off.</li>
    <li> The right product at the right time. Thanks.</li>
    <li> My eternally peeling lips have been given a reprieve at last. It&#x27;s shocking how well this works.</li>
    <li> Did you know that you can order these from e.l.f. for $3 each and they usually offer free shipping?  I made the mistake of overpaying because I had something else to order from Amazon but it wont happen again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product itself is great.  I used to Vaseline and baby toothbrush trick to exfoliate my lips but never again.  These work great and are very convenient.</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t even tell you how the product worked because I opened the first package, applied it to my lips and had this overwhelming smell flood my nostrils all day. To the point it made me sick and also made me take a pregnancy test. Not pregnant so it must just be that the smell is terrible. So I thought maybe it was just that package. I opened the second one and same thing. I had to send it back because the smell was so strong and terrible I can&#x27;t even think about using it again.</li>
    <li> I got this in an e.l.f. Beauty Bundle and at first, I thought, what would I ever use this for? But it was winter at the time, and I had been playing around with different lip colors lately, and some of them are not very moisturizing. Pretty soon my lips got chapped. And then I remembered that I had this lip exfoliator.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I like this fairly well, but I find it to be a bit inconsistent at times. Sometimes it feels more moisturizing to me, and sometimes it feels scratchier. (There are little rough bits that do the exfoliating. The rough bits don&#x27;t seem to transfer to the lips at all, and they do gently get rid of dead skin cells.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like that this contains a lot of plant oils, although please note that ceresin is derived from mineral wax. Also please note that it contains aspartame, which I find a little odd since it also has sugar in it. (I don&#x27;t have anything against aspartame; I consume it all the time. I&#x27;m just passing on the information in case it is a concern for you.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This does not add any color or shine to the lips and is probably not a substitute for a lip balm. However, the oils and waxes do soften the lips somewhat. I think it would be best for people who want to even out the skin on the lips, for example, prior to applying lip stains (which look best with smooth lips), or for people with highly chapped lips.</li>
    <li> Let me start off by saying this is more of a lip scrub than lip balm. If you are looking for a moisturizing lip balm, this is not the product you need. To properly get the &#x27;scrub&#x27; properties of this balm, you have to use it around 3 times to scrape off a thick layer of soft moisturizing balm on the tip of the stick. Once you actually get to the scrub part however, I found that this is pretty inconvenient. First off, if you have dry or chapped lips and you actually want to get enough product on your lips.. it just won&#x27;t work for you. Mine broke at the 4th or 5th use when I tried to rub it on my lips (not enough product was actually getting on my lips). I did learn a good trick from the breaking of this product however. I took the broken stick out of the holder/packaging thing and used the bottom side as a deep exfoliator. It is very rough, and basically like applying brown sugar to your lips. But it finally got enough product on my lips to actually repair dryness! The reason that this product is inconvenient is because after using it, you have to wipe it off your lips with a moist towel, and then have to apply layers of your favorite lip balm. The only useful purpose of this is if you have very chapped, flaky lips and need something to get the dead skin off. Other than that, it&#x27;s not very useful. I still do use it sometimes however, because the smell is fantastic (it reminds me of warm cookies, vanilla, and brown sugar- absolutely delicious)!</li>
    <li> I love this Lip Exfoliator,when i rubbed it across my mouth it was a little ruff but then the sugar dissolved and my lips became moisturized,i didn&#x27;t expect that,it leaves your lips very smooth and it doesn&#x27;t taste bad either,it has a nice vanilla scent it&#x27;s not to strong.I really like this product,and i would recommend this Lip Exfoliator.</li>
    <li> Not great results my daughter says. I see she&#x27;s back to using her chapstick. She says 3 stars but that may be generous if results are what is being graded.</li>
    <li> This lip exfolitor is awesome. it makes my lips feel smooth and no more peeling. AWESOME!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve ised lip scrubs before but it doesn&#x27;t seem to do much due to not enough scrub beads. This is perfect, it&#x27;s a very solid and doesn&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s going to break if you press it a little hard. Makes your lips look healthy and just overall nicer</li>
    <li> I do not smoke but my lips turned black. I used this and my lips are pretty much even now.</li>
    <li> Perfect stuff! It&#x27;s a sugar scrub for your lips! Rub on straight out of the shower (I smear it like real lipstick, too) and wipe off with a damp cotton ball. Follow up with a moisturizing lip balm and you&#x27;re done. Three days and my lips were like new! Love this stuff.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had dry, chapped lips my entire life and after using these little miracles I haven&#x27;t had a problem since.  Heck, I only use chapstick once and that&#x27;s only because the instructions on the exfoliator say I should.  I would buy again but I don&#x27;t have to.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve spent over $20 on the Sara Happ lip exfoliator and now I&#x27;m sad I did that because this product is so much more superior. Its everything I&#x27;ve wanted out of a exfoliator - logical packaging, natural ingredients, and grit. I love that it is packaged in lipstick form because you can use it from the tube and make circular motions on your lips. It doesn&#x27;t fall apart on your lips and does have enough hold in the product to keep it together. When you first get it, you will have to use a bit to get down to the sugar part so don&#x27;t immediately think its too slick to work as an exfoliator.</li>
    <li> I have experienced instantaneous results with this product.I would absolutely recommend this to anyone who has the habit of biting lips like me. This is the quickest fix I got for my chipped lips.</li>
    <li> Absolutely amazing this lip scrub smells amazing and tastes exactly like brown sugar! My little sister cant stop applying it lol! Its great for chapped lips! 5 stars!</li>
    <li> I like how it really does exfoliate the lips and the feeling after use is amazing. It was sad when one of the lipsticks came off it&#x27;s base but it was okay. I just love the use of the product and the after feeling.</li>
    <li> This works nicely if you have really chapped, peeling lips. Takes away the cracked layer. Just make sure to rinse it off after a few minutes. Lips will be smooth and fresh!</li>
    <li> I love it! After all these years, I finally have a normal mouth! Never know lip exfoliator existed so i can&#x27;t compare with other products but this one works and I&#x27;m very happy.</li>
    <li> Wow! I can&#x27;t understand the fabulous reviews this product received, because it left my poor lips feeling like they&#x27;d been run through a chipper shredder! Don&#x27;t know what the exfoliating grit was used in the stuff, but it felt like I was torturing my lips with gravel embedded in grease. Such a painful experience that I threw it out immediately and was glad that ELF cosmetics are so inexpensive. Yoiks! I am fair skinned and have sensitive skin and my lips were screaming for mercy after I tried this stuff. To be fair, I usually love the quality and price of the ELF brand but will never get within 10 feet of this stuff again! For those of you who love this lip exfoliator, I am envious, because I am still looking for the perfect product. What works great for me is after cleansing my face, I simply rub my lips briskly with a soft washcloth &amp; then massage in a couple of drop of unscented grapeseed oil and my lops are soft, exfoliated and soothed. I do this every morning and night.</li>
    <li> I do not appreciate that this stick broke so quickly.  It crumbled a few days into using it.  It definitely exfoliates your lips, but the application is uneven, so part of my lip was smooth, another part was not, and yet another part was scraped too deeply.  I will not buy this product again.</li>
    <li> Best elf product I&#x27;ve bought!! Makes my lips sooooo soft! Soft and sweet. ;)</li>
    <li> First of all, if you buy this item from the actual website www.eyeslipsface.com it&#x27;s only $3. This Exfoliator is great! I&#x27;m a lip biter so my lips can look gross and peel and get rough. And this Exfoliator has little cristals in it that gets off the dead skin and makes your lips feel so soft. And look so good. You should definitely get it.</li>
    <li> I bought this pack because I have terribly dry lips, and I lick them which in turn makes them way worse. Terrible, horrible bacon lips. I&#x27;ve gotten better about using chapstick but every now and then I get behind and this is the kind of boost I needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They work pretty well, definitely helps scrub off some of that skin that is pestering you so you can start fresh. It does taste good, so don&#x27;t go eating it or it won&#x27;t last very long. It goes pretty fast, being grains of sugar and a light something to hold it all together, you can burn through it if you use it a lot or push hard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ALSO, do not leave this stuff anywhere remotely warm. I left one in my car the first few days I was using it and it all melted into the cap and became unusable. Very sad about that.</li>
    <li> This was actually hard to use. Most lip scrubs/exfoliators come in a tub - since this is an actual lipstick scrub I found it was very dry and rough to apply. My first tube broke while I was applying it (thank goodness this was a 3 pack)!&lt;br /&gt;I did manage to get a successful application from my 2nd tube, but it was so dry getting in on my lips was something of a chore.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll finish using this set but I won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
    <li> love it , hope to deal with you again</li>
    <li> I am constantly biting on my chapped lips and picking at the flaking skin.  This exfoliator works!!  It actually removes all the dead skin, leaving behind silky smooth lips.  Not only that but it has a nice scent and unlike most products, does not taste awful.  I&#x27;ll be using this product year round!!</li>
    <li> Just ok. Could have more micro beads for exfoliating</li>
    <li> These are cheaper on the E.L.F. Cosmetics website. However I did like this lip exfoliator. The smell is sweet, almost like vanilla mixed with brown sugar.</li>
    <li> Wonderful thank you very much</li>
    <li> This lip exfoliator is okay.  I was expecting some a wee bit more moisturizing as other lip exfoliator&#x27;s I have used have been, but this one falls way short.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would not recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;T</li>
    <li> Great lip exfoliator.  Convenient to use.  Pleasant taste.  Leaves my lips feeling soft and moisturized--ready for lipstick.  Price was great.  Will definitely order, again, for Christmas stocking stuffers.  Arrived well packaged and quickly.</li>
    <li> I got the product when they said I would. The product came to me unopened, and not damanged.  The product does what it says. However, I would get the same result from sugar and olive oil mix. With the price being a lot less.</li>
    <li> Works like magic and it is such a good price!</li>
    <li> e.l.f. Studio Lip Exfoliator is the perfect product to use, especially when the weather turns cold and your skin  is drained dry by indoor heat and intense outdoor cold. This product contains Vitamin E, Shea Butter, Avocado, Grape and Jojoba Oils. There is no color, so it is perfect underneath whatever lip color you normally wear. The taste is sweet, the smell is inoffensive, and the results are excellent. At first I thought it might be a waste of money, but using it after a while prooved that it did exfoliate that dry upper layer of rough skin that is such a total discomfort. It&#x27;s the perfect therapy for chapped lips, and to keep them smooth all year, and it&#x27;s better than other products I&#x27;ve tried.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended!</li>
    <li> Amazing! Leaves your lips smooth. Never going back to traditional chap stick again.</li>
    <li> This stuff is a great exfoliator and also smells and tastes delicious - like vanilla frosting! Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I have a TERRIBLE habit of picking at my lips. They are almost always cracked and dry. This stuff is the answer to my prayers! It takes all the dry skin off and makes my lips nice and smooth. It also has a nice smell, even though you wipe it off it&#x27;s still nice! I will be buying this as long as they make it, which I hope is a long time!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t usually wear lipstick unless with my make-up artist, in films, or special events.  Lipgloss and moisturizers are usually my daily deal.  But, this portable stick quickly repairs what my norm routine can&#x27;t.  It&#x27;s quite a blessing to carry.</li>
    <li> i didnt get this product on Amazon but in Target... the product itself is great and DOES exfoliate... very well actually, the &amp;#34;grit&amp;#34; is really harsh on chapped lips and works well to remove chapped skin i suppose we call it... but there isnt much product in the tube and (both my sister and i got a tube) my tube at the product broke off from the base.. so aside from having to keep the product short so it doesnt wobble out its great</li>
    <li> I battle chapped lips all winter. Despite using Blistex lip balm all day every day and Carmex every night I still get little flakes of dry skin on my lips. I&#x27;ve learned the hard way never to pull these off - ouch! - as it just makes the problem worse to have what is now a raw area on my lips. I prefer using lip stain over lipstick but if you have ANY areas of dry skin or peeling on your lips a lip stain looks awful. I wanted to try a lip scrub but they&#x27;re so expensive. I was going to try making my own but I&#x27;d read so many positive reviews on this product I decided to give it a try. I was skeptical something so cheap would work but it did! It worked great! I use it every morning after I brush my teeth and follow up immediately with a lip balm while I put on my makeup. I then wipe off the lip balm, apply a lip stain, cover again with lip balm. I apply lip balm periodically throughout the day but removing the flakes in the morning keeps my lips looking good all day and I can use my lip stain once again. This products smells and tastes great. I rub it back and forth over my lips several times, then rub a little more with my finger to make sure I have done a total exfoliation. I bought my first tube at Target for $2, then ordered a 3 pack here while ordering other items but paid twice as much for the convenience. They sell for $2 each tube at Walmart, Target, Meijer, CVS, etc., if you want to try it out before buying a 3 pack.</li>
    <li> Love the sweet sugary smell &amp; taste. But was expecting it to work better/more efficiently.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing. It is cheap and it works like a charm. It also has a wonderful smell</li>
    <li> This is a great exfoliator. Just right for lips.</li>
    <li> I will never buy a different lip scrub again!! Not messy like some in the jars can be. Great product, left my lips smooth as can be. Love that it&#x27;s in a lipstick tube. Makes it much easier to do on the go or last minute</li>
    <li> I seriously love this exfoliator. It has a gritty texture like sand that can be a little rough but as someone who wanted all cracked and dry skin removed, this was fantastic. The gritty part is sugar and the moisturizing ingredients that keep it together are smooth and do their job. My boyfriend has already said my lips feel creamier and smoother that before and with constant use my lips just feel so much more attractive and my lipstick looks so much better.</li>
    <li> Amazing you get your money&#x27;s worth. It Smoothes away everything and leaves you with soft and kissable lips. My sister loves it too</li>
    <li> This product is ok. I received three in my order. Three were more than I needed. I would not purchase again. A simple homemade scrub of sugar and coconut oil works better. I bought this because of magazine recommendation.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing. I have always stayed away from wearing lipstick because of how flaky and chapped my lips get. This has brown sugar which exfoliates your lips and tastes yummy. Sometimes it can be a little too rough, but I wipe away any excess sugar on the tip so it&#x27;s a bit smoother when I apply. Now, before I apply any lipstick, I use this as well as a good lip balm to smooth out my lips.</li>
    <li> Makes my lips feel great! Just don&#x27;t get addicted to putting it on, the beads might get all over your lips.</li>
    <li> Exfoliates well,  however,  it gets a buildup and won&#x27;t work well until it is removed.</li>
    <li> Magic.  Perfect lip exfoliant, and easy and neat</li>
    <li> was looking for a possible replacement for body shop lip scuff- this is not it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;too rough, oddly (as in way beyond expected) sugary sweet, hard to get &amp;#34;started&amp;#34;, and actually hurts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;because amazon doesn&#x27;t accept returns on this item i ended up tossing these in the trash, total waste of money and resources.</li>
    <li> This is an amazing product, especially for it&#x27;s price. So far, it&#x27;s been working very well for me. I feel as though it dried out for some people because they didn&#x27;t damp their lips before putting this on maybe? Because I tried putting it on when my lips were dry and it was hard and scraped at my lips. But whenever I damp my lips first, it goes on well. So I would suggest reading the instructions (which is on the side of the packaging of the exfoliater) before using it. Whenever I use this my lips are so soft and smooth and I absolutely love it! I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff! Works well, has a great smell, not messy, and CHEAP. Glad I have it in time for winter! Strongly suggest pairing it with ELF moisturizing lipstick. Almost double the effects.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cheapest at Target though....</li>
    <li> I love this e.l.f. product and the shipping/packaging was great. I use this product every morning before I put on any kind of lip blam, lipstick etc.</li>
    <li> This smooths and moisturizes perfectly, and it&#x27;s so affordable! Yay!</li>
    <li> OMG - This exfoiliator is amazing!!  I&#x27;m obsessed with this stuff.  I keep it in my purse, at my desk, in my bathroom, so I always have access.  Makes my usually flaky lips smooth and hydrated.  e.l.f. makes a lot of great products, and this is definitely one of them.</li>
    <li> I love this product. Gave the other two to my besties and they are enjoying it, as well!</li>
    <li> Used the product several times before just had to get a pack for this winter. I love elf lip scrub... It&#x27;s amazing</li>
    <li> I have a terrible time with my lips, they are always chapped and they get really bad no matter what chapstick I use/how much. I go though a lot of them! But this product smells amazing, works great, and leaves my lips so smooth! For the price this is a great product! Its wonderful! From the first time I used it I was in love with it :)</li>
    <li> This works awesome.  It really does remove the flaky skin from my lips and it brings out the natural glow.  Then I put on some lip gloss or lip balm to make them shine even more (and stay well protected).</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s alright. I still have severely chapped lips. I do use chap sticks and other things along with this product. Maybe I haven&#x27;t given it enough time yet</li>
    <li> best and most convient product for fixing dry cracked lips I have ever tried. and it tastes good too</li>
    <li> I wish I didn&#x27;t have to buy this in a three pack. I use some sort of lip balm several times daily, and with winter setting in I decided to try this. I don&#x27;t know if I received an old batch or something, but dragging this across your sensitive lips feels like scouring them with sandpaper. I&#x27;ve figured out that wetting the product under the tap first makes it more tolerable. Leaves a very sugary taste behind. Since I need to wet it before I use it, this is something that stays in my vanity at home for use in the morning and before bed, and not something I&#x27;d put in my purse to use during the day.</li>
    <li> I love it it smells amazing like sweet cookies and I did not buy this three pack I bought one at a store.</li>
    <li> This stuff is absolutely amazing. I heard about it on Reddit, and had to try it immediately. It is absolutely great for exfoliating your lips - and with winters as terrible as they are in Wisconsin, I need all the help I can get! The only negative is that the caps of the tubes tend to not fit very snugly, but it is something easily overlooked as I do not carry a tube with me. It is something I typically use at night and before going out. In any case, for the price, it is definitely worth a shot. Other positive? It tastes great! Of course, if you somehow hate brown sugar, you will hate the taste. But if you love it, you&#x27;ll feel the same way I do!</li>
    <li> I LOVE this product!! First I&#x27;d like to say I didn&#x27;t read correctly and didn&#x27;t realize I was getting THREE for only 10 bucks!! Whoa awesome!&lt;br /&gt;It smells sweet and natural. It works great and I even use it on my daughter and her chapped lips are almost 100 % better!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m so happy I found out about ELF products- so inexpensive and I love them! By the way, the three sticks are the same size as a regular lipstick!</li>
    <li> It is suitable when you suffer from dry lips and need to fix the situation quickly with no problems,, i take a medicine that dried the skin so it&#x27;s perfect for such bad case .. But i use it from time to time and i use medical moisturizer immediately</li>
    <li> This product has the yummiest smell to it. Luckily I don&#x27;t have a sweet tooth or I would have tried to taste it haha!&lt;br /&gt;It goes on rough but that&#x27;s obviously to buff out the dry and cracked skin on your lips but it leaves them feeling so soft! This deal was great and it was shipped super fast. It made it to my house 2-4 days earlier than expected so it was a pleasant surprise to find in  my mailbox.</li>
    <li> I was very skeptical as i put this on, once i had received it but after getting the initial clear coating off, it has been magnificent. I am very happy with this product and HIGHLY suggest it. My lips have been chapped for months, due the the crazy Maryland weather and i really wish i had known about this stuff months ago.</li>
    <li> I love these lip scrubs. I had been searching for a good one for a while, and was pleased to find that these are both the cheapest and the best out there. They do the job amazingly, and they taste yummy too. They also leave behind a little bit of moisture to help smooth your lips after exfoliating. Definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> I love it so much that I want to keep using it all day but.. the reason I&#x27;m not giving it a full 5 stars is because if you have it warmed up in your fingers or you hands for too long, it will MELT. so try keeping it in a cool place. but don&#x27;t refrigerate it or anything Haha</li>
    <li> The first couple of times you use it, it is like magic and really does exfoliate your lips.&lt;br /&gt;After the first few times, the stick starts to lose definition, and every time you use it it leaves behind gritty goops of the stick (which gets worse and more pronounced with subsequent use). I suppose it does still exfoliate the lips, but also requires rubbing it off and cleaning yourself up.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know how well this does at exfoliating, I haven&#x27;t noticed a huge change in my lips, but it does smell (and taste! oops) amazing and seems to moisturize well.</li>
    <li> Awesome lip exfoliators 😄</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t notice much of a difference!</li>
    <li> I LOVE this product, I was a little skeptical but it was recommended by a friend so I gave it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A little goes a long way with this product, it doesn&#x27;t take much to do the job.</li>
    <li> Love this product! Glad it came with 3! Works great!</li>
    <li> not bad, but not great.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the time of year for my lips to be super dry, chapped, and uncomfortable. I&#x27;ve finally given up on the not-so-good-for-me lip treatments and decided to try e.l.f.&#x27;s exfoliator after seeing it get a decent review on the Paula&#x27;s Choice website. This thing really does exfoliate but it doesn&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s tearing up my skin and the gentle, but pleasant taste of the moisturizing balm is a nice touch. After a couple days, I went from peeling lips to smooth lips and back to wearing bright red lipstick during the day. I&#x27;m really, truly grateful to have found this.</li>
    <li> Great exfoliation and easy to store and use.</li>
    <li> Excellent product!! Buttery lips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love Amazon! Let me be the first to say that. Now having said that, you are getting robbed at the price of $16.23!!! I just purchased this tonight (2/27/15 in DC area) at Old Navy for $2.80 (originally $4)....still too much. I HATE getting jipped, but it happens (can&#x27;t catch every little thing). Walgreens has this same product for $2.69 online and Target for $3. At either store mentioned, you are coming nowhere close to $16.23! Save yourself a few bucks and head to Starbuck&#x27;s or treat yourself in some other way. But I ❤️u still...Amazon!</li>
    <li> It works temporarily but it makes my lips sticky.</li>
    <li> Makes my lips so soft after use!</li>
    <li> I have purchased numerous expensive  lip exfoliators so I had my doubts when purchasing this product.  e.l.f exfoliator worked as well as any high priced item. It is easy to use unlike some of my others with three different steps. This is simple, rub it on your lips and wipe it off. The difference in your lips is noticeable. The dry flakes instantly are gone. The greatest bonus for me is that your lipstick goes on smooth and your lips feel moist. I will not spend high prices for lip exfoliator again.e.l.f. is my brand from now on.</li>
    <li> I loved this product. I&#x27;ll buy it next time Good price And high quality Fast Delivery</li>
    <li> I love it.it works great</li>
    <li> love love this product. Go ahead and buy it.</li>
    <li> I love these things! Perfect for a quick exfoliation. I use it about once a week on dry or moist lips. Scrubs off dead skin and leaves my lips super smooth.</li>
    <li> I picked this up on a whim - it was $3 at Walmart, so what the heck - but I didn&#x27;t expect much because every lip exfoliator I&#x27;ve used before was terrible. Either they&#x27;re too harsh, like sandpaper, or too mild, like trying to buff your lips with pure wax (not very effective). I dampened my lips before using this, and buffed in small circular motions. It quickly became addicting! It&#x27;s the perfect level of coarseness, and felt like giving my lips a gentle massage. I wiped it off and finished with a layer of Blistex medicated lip ointment, and my lips looked and felt amazing! As with anything involving lips, be gentle - you can quickly go overboard with using this too often or with too much pressure. But it smells great, it works wonderfully, and it&#x27;s in such a perfect lipstick tube, it fits right in with all the other products in your purse. A MUST HAVE!</li>
    <li> somewhat weakens the dead layers of skin but doesn&#x27;t actually remove them unless you scrub extremely hard, (which is obviously not advised unless you want red, raw, bleeding lips) surprising considering how abrasive the sugar particles are&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;you&#x27;re better off just using a homemade mixture of olive oil and sugar</li>
    <li> I absolutely love the ELF lip exfoliater, it makes my lips so soft! It&#x27;s a great purchase!</li>
    <li> This is a great lip exfoliator. Since it comes in a lipstick form, it is really easy to apply. It has brown sugar and a sweet taste and, most importantly, it is really effective. I have backups of this, For just $3 on the ELF website this is a bargain!</li>
    <li> I got mine today. Its winter, so I tried it right away. It smells excellent! I had a hard time not licking my lips. I did a little once I wiped my lips, it was tasty! The first time you use it you must run it over your lips a few times to get it going. I could see the dead skin right away. I wiped my lips off with a moist napkin (no cotton balls in my office at work) and applied gloss as directed on the back of the packaging. It tingles for a bit, but it isn&#x27;t bothersome. I have mint lip gloss that tingles way more than this so my tolerance for tingling lips may be higher than others. My lips feel awesome and I don&#x27;t feel any of the dead skin right now. I know there is still some there, but it isn&#x27;t peeling right now. I would not use this if you have severely chapped lips or and open cut or sore. It will likely burn very much if you do. It gets very gritty, similar to St. Ives Apricot Scrub, except yummy and for your lips.</li>
    <li> Smells great and helps keep lips soft!</li>
    <li> Ever since I received this, I became obssessed with exfoliating my lips. It works well and leaves a sweet taste on your lips. I was originally going to get only 1 from the CVS store online but I figured this option was cheaper.</li>
</ol>
