### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>This is the best gel I have ever used, it&#x27;s basically waterproof (pool tested).</li>
      <li>Great stuff!</li>
      <li>I always forget to use this, but the smell is great and it works for long-hair, too!  </li>
      <li>Great product i have used for over five years and my hair is still in place none falling out.  </li>
      <li>Worked great.  </li>
      <li>I love this product!  </li>
      <li>Its a nice gel, but I was looking for a stronger hold than what this product could offer.</li>
      <li>I have to use hairspray on top of this product..</li>
      <li>good price, pruduct rare to find in superstores</li>
      <li>Most gels are sold in a package that one does not have to shake or pound the bottle to get the product to arrive at the nozzle--This is mostly a nuisance, since the product is so runny.&lt;br /&gt;3.  </li>
      <li>There much better products.</li>
      <li>If I keep adding more product to my hair, eventually it works holding my hair in place.  </li>
      <li>YOU NOT the moment i stopped using this product my acne cleared up, my face felt clean in a way I cannot remember, and my life changed forever.</li>
      <li>I find it&#x27;s a good value here on Amazon as opposed to buying it locally in a store.  </li>
      <li>I first got this product when I wore my hear in a spike to set it.</li>
      <li>To be fair, I used it for a few weeks to see if I can find a way to like the product.  </li>
      <li>I switched to my original gell and it felt heavy, this one is better.  </li>
      <li>I have curly hair and really need a get that can hold my curls in place.</li>
      <li>My hair has a tendency to stand straight up in the morning.  </li>
      <li>Kudos to the engineer who figures if Schwarzkopf sells a watered down product, they might sell more of it!&lt;br /&gt;2.  </li>
      <li>It holds as well as the stickier more glue like textured gel but without the mess.  </li>
      <li>The engineer of the dispenser bottle should be looking for a new job.  </li>
      <li>Then even comical, when closing the nozzle, a small amount of product does squirt out.</li>
      <li>I use my curling and flat iron first before I can apply anything.</li>
      <li>One bottle was liquified and no where near a &amp;#34;gel&amp;#34;.  </li>
      <li>(There needs to be a uniform rating system for the amount of hold a gel offers.)</li>
      <li>It gives it a bit more fullness with just running i little bit on your fingertips, and then maybe blow drying (even if hair is dry), which is what I do, when I have occasion to look great:)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Elle</li>
      <li>It is less expensive than others and yet does a great job.  </li>
      <li>I think of you have thick hair, this product isn&#x27;t strong enough.</li>

    <li> My son uses this to spike his hair up and it works well.</li>
    <li> I know this may be a little harsh, but this product is not to the Schwarzkopf Standard.  I (5 star) like  the \\&quot;got 2b GLUED\\&quot; product that holds hair all day, but I sometimes want a dryer look.  So I tried this product.  After all the \\&quot;Spiked-Up\\&quot; product label also states Hold, Spike, etc., just as the \\&quot;glued\\&quot; product I like.  Big disappointment!  To be fair, I used it for a few weeks to see if I can find a way to like the product.  Nope.  I have given up and I am throwing the rest away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros...  Given up looking for one&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;1.  Product should be sold as a \\&quot;Syrup\\&quot; not as a \\&quot;gel\\&quot;.  I have not tried syrup in my hair, but I imagine that corn syrup would hold about as well as this product.  If I keep adding more product to my hair, eventually it works holding my hair in place.  Kudos to the engineer who figures if Schwarzkopf sells a watered down product, they might sell more of it!&lt;br /&gt;2.  The engineer of the dispenser bottle should be looking for a new job.  Most gels are sold in a package that one does not have to shake or pound the bottle to get the product to arrive at the nozzle--This is mostly a nuisance, since the product is so runny.&lt;br /&gt;3.  Then even comical, when closing the nozzle, a small amount of product does squirt out. It can \\&quot;shoot\\&quot; several feet.  I have figured out how to control the discharge by using two hands to keep control of the discharge.  If you do not close the nozzle the product dries and you have to dig it out clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line:  There much better products.</li>
    <li> The scourge of my existence. For two years i battled severe acne, combatting it every way possible. The moment, I S*** YOU NOT the moment i stopped using this product my acne cleared up, my face felt clean in a way I cannot remember, and my life changed forever. If only this product could have come with a warning label saying \\&quot;will ruin life\\&quot; maybe two of the prime years of my adulthood may not have been ripped from me.</li>
    <li> I always forget to use this, but the smell is great and it works for long-hair, too!  It gives it a bit more fullness with just running i little bit on your fingertips, and then maybe blow drying (even if hair is dry), which is what I do, when I have occasion to look great:)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Elle</li>
    <li> I like this gel a lot.  It holds as well as the stickier more glue like textured gel but without the mess.  It&#x27;s easier to get out of the container and doesn&#x27;t get clogged.</li>
    <li> One bottle was liquified and no where near a &amp;#34;gel&amp;#34;.  And the other bottle was partially evaporated.  Not what I expected at all</li>
    <li> My hair has a tendency to stand straight up in the morning.  Using this gel has solved that problem all day.  I find it&#x27;s a good value here on Amazon as opposed to buying it locally in a store.  I&#x27;ll buy it again and highly recommend it for &#x27;hard to manage&#x27; hair.</li>
    <li> Great product i have used for over five years and my hair is still in place none falling out.  I switched to my original gell and it felt heavy, this one is better.  The plastic it comes in is thinning compared to store bought got2b.</li>
    <li> Use just a little bit to do the job! Great stuff!</li>
    <li> I like being spikey, it&#x27;s the only way to be! This is the best gel I have ever used, it&#x27;s basically waterproof (pool tested).</li>
    <li> I like this product and have used in the past and present. I would not recommend buying it on line It appears that it was either out dated or someone added water to the bottle</li>
    <li> good price, pruduct rare to find in superstores</li>
    <li> I have curly hair and really need a get that can hold my curls in place. This product was not strong enough to do the job I needed. Its a nice gel, but I was looking for a stronger hold than what this product could offer. (There needs to be a uniform rating system for the amount of hold a gel offers.)</li>
    <li> This product has a total different consistency than the travel size I had been using. It is not a gel and does not hold as stated. Instead of adding volume and control, it adds weight to the hair. Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t buy this product through amazon, but bought it at the store. I just had to put a review. I&#x27;m asian and I have very thick hair. I&#x27;ve had my hair cut into several styles of mohawks and frohawks. I&#x27;m a girl, so i did a lot of research into which gels or paste would work for me. I cannot style while my hair is wet. I use my curling and flat iron first before I can apply anything. This product does not work for me at all. It may work for others, but not me. My hair didn&#x27;t stay at all, my mohawk wouldn&#x27;t stand at all. Even my frohawk wouldn&#x27;t stay in place. I have to use hairspray on top of this product.. then my hair felt heavier.. what works for others doesn&#x27;t mean it works for everyone else. I think of you have thick hair, this product isn&#x27;t strong enough.</li>
    <li> I love this product!  It is less expensive than others and yet does a great job.  You can spike your hair or simply \\&quot;gel\\&quot; it in place and it stays. I would buy this product over and over again.</li>
    <li> I first got this product when I wore my hear in a spike to set it. Worked great.  Now my hair is gray, limp and longer but I still use it to give my &#x27;asymetrical bob&#x27; the body it needs to look sharp.  This is the second bottle I&#x27;ve purchased. It doesn&#x27;t flake or leave a residue.  I would definitely recommend it.</li>
