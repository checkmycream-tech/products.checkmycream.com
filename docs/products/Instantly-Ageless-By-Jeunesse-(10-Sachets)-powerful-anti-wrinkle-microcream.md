### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>The video was quite impressive but my experience was not even close to those results.</li>
      <li>I wan&#x27;t all impressed by the product.</li>
      <li>Received product and it works wonderfully.</li>
      <li>I like this product it works great</li>
      <li>They are great for a night out or an event.</li>
      <li>They smell really good also.</li>
      <li>I think it works but after so many uses, it doesn&#x27;t work as great.</li>
      <li>Love it!</li>
      <li>They work great and do exactly what they are advertised to do.</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s more hype than help.</li>
      <li>It works temporarily but better than anything I have ever tried before.</li>
      <li>so we are still waiting to see how it feels and works with makeup and to make sure there is no adverse reactions.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll be ordering more as soon as I run out</li>
      <li>I love this product except that it seems like it has a powder effect  </li>
      <li>My sister is a nurse and she recommended a hemorrhoid cream, which allegedly is much more proactive than this product.</li>
      <li>You can&#x27;t put makeup on over it because it&#x27;s easily rubbed off, and it stops working.</li>
      <li>Works great for short periods (3-4 hours).  </li>
      <li>It made a significant difference.</li>
      <li>Its only good if you don&#x27;t wear any makeup becauae</li>
      <li>I cannot wait to see what happens after the 10 full days.  </li>
      <li>There is no way I would use this except in the case of a quick &amp;#34;photo-shoot&amp;#34;.  </li>
      <li>The package arrived quickly and well packaged.  </li>
      <li>Not as good as I expected</li>
      <li>Pretty cool.  </li>
      <li>I really liked the commercial</li>
      <li>This isn&#x27;t worth buying.  </li>
      <li>The only thing I don&#x27;t love is the sachet packaging.</li>
      <li>Love this product,  great pricing and speedy shipping, can&#x27;t go wrong here!</li>
      <li>However, it left my skin feeling very stiff (as if it would crack if I smiled!!)</li>
      <li>After that, I would really want to get the stuff off of my face.  </li>
      <li>I really wanted this to work</li>
      <li>I watched youtube videos, googled all about it and really want to like this product.  </li>
      <li>You get a full box for 74.95 plus shipping through an actual Jeunesse web page.</li>
      <li>It is only out first time using it</li>
      <li>it does leave a white film if you use too much.</li>
      <li>What this does is essentially stretch and flatten any loose skin, such as wrinkly loose skin under your eyes - much like a clay masque or a wax might do.  </li>

<li> I&#x27;ve been using the packages for a few days and it makes my skin feel so soft.  </li>
<li> so it doesn&#x27;t dry out in between uses.</li>
<li> It does take the puffiness away from under eyes, but then it gives you the appearance of wrinkles and dry skin.  </li>
<li> To me, it just feels like you put Elmer&#x27;s glue on and let it dry.</li>
<li> This is a great product, but this price in INSANE!!!</li>
<li> Just OK product; I was somewhat disappointed</li>
<li> It does make a difference in my under eye puffiness and dark circles.</li>
<li> I have dark circles that age me.</li>
<li> They will try to tell you to use less product, or not to moisturize before using.</li>
<li> I was so hoping this product would work as amazing as it appeared, but I was very disappointed.  </li>
<li> Waste of money.</li>
<li> So don&#x27;t know if wearing it everyday will improve.</li>
<li> but overall it just makes the eye bags worse.  </li>
<li> and I was so anxious to try it.  </li>
<li> I saw a small improvement but not like as seen in the demo</li>
<li> Not a good trade off for me.  </li>
<li> And make me look tired.</li>
<li> My mom has really bad bags and dark circles.</li>
<li> Unfortunately, I lost the packets immediately after receiving them.</li>
<li> Its kinda weird feeling.</li>
<li> Sorry, not a winner!</li>
<li> Sorry, but I was very disappointed.  </li>
<li> I was frankly disappointed.  </li>
<li> too pricey!  :(</li>

    <li> This stuff works. I have dark circles that age me. And make me look tired. I saw a difference within minutes. My mom has really bad bags and dark circles. It made a significant difference. It is only out first time using it so we are still waiting to see how it feels and works with makeup and to make sure there is no adverse reactions. The only thing I don&#x27;t love is the sachet packaging.</li>
    <li> This is a great product, but this price in INSANE!!! You get a full box for 74.95 plus shipping through an actual Jeunesse web page. If you don&#x27;t want to get ripped off, go to www .sweetfreshness.jeunesseglobal .com</li>
    <li> Product works on the bags under the eyes but creates crows feet on the corners.</li>
    <li> I watched youtube videos, googled all about it and really want to like this product.  It is just so hit and miss.  I use a brush to tap it on and some days, I think it might work.  but overall it just makes the eye bags worse.  I won&#x27;t be reordering.</li>
    <li> Love this product,  great pricing and speedy shipping, can&#x27;t go wrong here!</li>
    <li> I like this product it works great I&#x27;ll be ordering more as soon as I run out</li>
    <li> Unfortunately, I lost the packets immediately after receiving them. Hopefully I&#x27;ll find them some day but I&#x27;m not counting on it.</li>
    <li> The video was quite impressive but my experience was not even close to those results. I really wanted this to work but it&#x27;s more hype than help. Sorry, not a winner!</li>
    <li> I was frankly disappointed.  The product DOES give the illusion of taking away the lines. However, it left my skin feeling very stiff (as if it would crack if I smiled!!) and I did not like that feeling at all.  There is no way I would use this except in the case of a quick &amp;#34;photo-shoot&amp;#34;.  After that, I would really want to get the stuff off of my face.  Sorry, but I was very disappointed.  There is no miracle cure to wrinkles (with the possible exception of fillers and/or a face lift)!</li>
    <li> Works great for short periods (3-4 hours).  Definitely can see a difference when using. Love it!</li>
    <li> Didnt see any Results</li>
    <li> Its only good if you don&#x27;t wear any makeup becauae it leaves a white film</li>
    <li> I think it works but after so many uses, it doesn&#x27;t work as great.</li>
    <li> Received product and it works wonderfully.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very short lived and you can&#x27;t move a muscle or you&#x27;re entire face looks like it&#x27;s cracking. I would not recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Just OK product; I was somewhat disappointed</li>
    <li> Dries the skin and leaves a residue. I would not recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Not as good as I expected</li>
    <li> My sister is a nurse and she recommended a hemorrhoid cream, which allegedly is much more proactive than this product.</li>
    <li> I saw a small improvement but not like as seen in the demo</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t even give it a 1 star because it did NOT DO anything at all. I TRIED every which way to apply it and nothing. Waste of money.</li>
    <li> I really liked the commercial so I bought the product!</li>
    <li> What this does is essentially stretch and flatten any loose skin, such as wrinkly loose skin under your eyes - much like a clay masque or a wax might do.  But you can&#x27;t go out of the house with a clay masque or wax on your face so instead you use this.  Pretty cool.  It works temporarily but better than anything I have ever tried before.</li>
    <li> The wife loves it!!!!</li>
    <li> works for me!!  it does leave a white film if you use too much. it needs a lid so it doesn&#x27;t dry out in between uses.</li>
    <li> No problem with Seller, this product did not work as well as I thought it would.</li>
    <li> I could not wait to receive this product.  A friend told me about it and I was so anxious to try it.  The package arrived quickly and well packaged.  I&#x27;ve been using the packages for a few days and it makes my skin feel so soft.  I cannot wait to see what happens after the 10 full days.  They smell really good also.</li>
    <li> This isn&#x27;t worth buying.  It works ok, but leaves a faint white spot wherever you apply it.  It&#x27;s not invisible.  You can&#x27;t put makeup on over it because it&#x27;s easily rubbed off, and it stops working.</li>
    <li> me dio alergia no me gusto</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t help the crease on my forhead which was what I wanted but it does work on the under eye</li>
    <li> I was so hoping this product would work as amazing as it appeared, but I was very disappointed.  It does take the puffiness away from under eyes, but then it gives you the appearance of wrinkles and dry skin.  Not a good trade off for me.  They will try to tell you to use less product, or not to moisturize before using. Those suggestions don&#x27;t even work.  So, one star only because I have to.</li>
    <li> Used for a week.  Didn&#x27;t work.</li>
    <li> Does not work! It seems like tinted powder.</li>
    <li> product yes! packaging no!</li>
    <li> Its kinda weird feeling. To me, it just feels like you put Elmer&#x27;s glue on and let it dry. When it dries, it does tighten.</li>
    <li> After hearing all the hype about these I wanted to try them out. They work great and do exactly what they are advertised to do. The only downfall is it only lasts about 6-8 hours. They are great for a night out or an event.</li>
    <li> I love this product except that it seems like it has a powder effect  the longer it is worn. It does make a difference in my under eye puffiness and dark circles. I used it before applying make up. Maybe I should have applied after</li>
    <li> I wan&#x27;t all impressed by the product. The effects are short term. So don&#x27;t know if wearing it everyday will improve.</li>
    <li> The cost and size does not reflect well with results.  too pricey!  :(</li>
    <li> Takes away my under eye bags within minutes.  I won&#x27;t be without this product.</li>
