    <li> It&#x27;s really cute had it for a while but the zipper broke and I couldn&#x27;t fix it bummer. It&#x27;s kinda big I thought it was going to be smaller.</li>
    <li> This is absolutely everything I had hoped it would be. It is so soft, and oh my goodness, the blush on it is too cute! My makeup fits into it also. I ordered this item on February 6, and it arrived March 2.</li>
    <li> I love this item! It is soft and plush and even roomier than I expected, which is great! The quality seems to be very good, so I will try to update after I use it for awhile.

I highly recommend it! I included a few items in my photo to give people an idea of how big the bag is. (By the way, the deodorant stick looks small in this photo, but it is full sized)</li>

It is super soft and you can fit a lot of things in it! I put my cosmetic things and my utensils for school, the bow seems to be... Okay, I mean it&#x27;salittle bent, kinda like the picture, but again, it&#x27;s okay! Worth the price! :D And it came 1 week earlier.</li>
