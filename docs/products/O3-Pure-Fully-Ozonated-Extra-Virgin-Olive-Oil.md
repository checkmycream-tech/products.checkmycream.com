      <li>I&#x27;ll be using is sparingly and savoring it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks O3 Pure!  </li>
      <li>A very unusual product.  </li>
      <li>This is the first time that I have ever used this product.</li>
      <li>Really worked well!  </li>
      <li>Sorry TMI but its the best for that in my opinion.</li>
      <li>I used it at night for acne, and it was significantly better the next day, and it disappeared in a week!</li>
      <li>During the summer, it&#x27;s hot and humid here in the South and the oil makes her break out in a heat rash.</li>
      <li>It was pretty stinky.</li>
      <li>It has a good effect on the chapped skin on my hands; however the odor is such that I would not go out in public with it.  </li>
      <li>products smell is similar to that of Vicks-Vapor-Rub.&lt;br /&gt;Smell strong at first then soaks-in and wears</li>
      <li>Amazing for all kinds of skin problems (even some of those that &amp;#34;have no cure&amp;#34; according to modern medicine, like psoriasis, pityriasis and other years-lasting problems), acne, any cuts, burns, sunburns, athlete&#x60;s foot, nail fungus, spider veins, boo-boos making any scars disappear.</li>
      <li>use it on my pets with the same amazing success (they hate the smell but they&#x60;ll deal with it for a good treat).&lt;br /&gt;10 stars would still not show my full satisfaction !</li>
      <li>and I could even taste it, though maybe that was just from smelling it so much.</li>
      <li>The real deal.</li>
      <li>I put it onto a very large inflammation behind my right shoulder and it made things much better in the first 24 hours of use during which I had put it on just two times.  </li>
      <li>As mentioned in the other comments, it has a slight smell, but it gets MUCH better if you use it more often.</li>
      <li>and I later lerned that actually the smellier the better as experts say.  </li>
      <li>Highly recommend, I even use it on my pets to heal their paws or chapped nose.  </li>
      <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>And the O3 smell is not so strong compare with other O3 product.</li>
      <li>such sensitive skin, you look for the &amp;#34;no dyes, no perfumes, no fragrances, etc&amp;#34; stuff and this olive oil could not be any more simple.</li>
      <li>Bought this for my son&#x27;s eczema, although it helped a little with it, but amazingly it got red of the planters warts on his hands.  </li>
      <li>&amp;#34;Musty old books&amp;#34</li>
      <li>I bought his product and it came professionally wrapped.  </li>
      <li>It has helped with old acne scars and I will continue to use it until it is gone.  </li>
      <li>it really helps too or get some especially for the knees.  </li>
      <li>Without going into details, I had a vaginal problem with major pain and discomfort and swelling.  </li>
      <li>It took just two applications for a complete cure, and I probably didn&#x27;t even need the second application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Six year old blonde daughter (cutie) with Genetic Eczema.&lt;br /&gt;Have</li>
      <li>other drawback is that it must stay refrigerated, so it&#x27;s not too convenient it that I can&#x27;t have it sitting on the changing table ready to go.</li>
      <li>Good Product with bad smell, but</li>

<li> Good Product with bad smell, but</li>
<li> The strong smell was a little hard to handle.</li>
<li> Upon opening, the ozonated smell is strong, and the product stays really firm, almost hard, when refrigerated.</li>
<li> I do have to say that his condition has been better with this cream, but it is very stiff and hard to get spread on his legs.</li>
<li> you are even thinking of purchasing this item, it is probably because you have a major problem that has not been improved with other treatments.  </li>
<li> And, it will probably last forever, as a little goes along way, and I believe I read that in the refrigerator this stuff could last ten years.  </li>
<li> what my daughter ending-up with scaring from itching dry skin.&lt;br</li>
<li> It has worked on the dry skin (for my kid and I) as well as a cut that I had from working in the garden.  </li>
<li> A buddy of mine mentioned that Ozonated Olive Oil was a \\&quot;miracle product\\&quot; and that I needed to try it for my kid&#x27;s Psoriasis and my dry skin.  </li>
<li> It has an odd smell but that is part of its quirky charm.</li>
<li> I ordered this for my dad who was having an issue with a weird, super itchy skin rash on his arms.  </li>
<li> She constantly has staph and this oil kills it without the harsh side effects of steroids.</li>
<li> I bought this product and he applied it over a course of maybe 2 - 3 months every night and this product drew out the infection and then closed the flesh.  </li>
<li> I put it on my fathers legs that have some wounds due to skin breakdown.  </li>
<li> And, as far as being expensive, I don&#x27;t think $25 for a medical treatment</li>
<li> The first night was the worst, but after that, I don&#x27;t really notice the smell!</li>
<li> he puts a little on and its gone.  </li>
<li> This product clears up skin lesions in as little as one application (gone in as little as 24 hours).  </li>
<li> But you get used to it after a few treatments.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
<li> If your a female with a bad rotary cuff also get a wireless back support bra do all these for about 3 months an you not need surgery it worked for my mom!</li>
<li> I have used very little and will keep it in my refrigerator</li>
<li> Small cuts, burns, blemishes etc.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m not sure</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> My infant daughter has severe oozy angry eczema all over her body. She has scratched herself to the point of bleeding sometimes, so I put this ozonated olive oil on her skin and immediatly begins healing! It doesn&#x27;t sting, inflame, or burn her skin. Some creams I have put on her and she would scream bloody murder and her skin would flare up due to the irritation.&lt;br /&gt;With such sensitive skin, you look for the &amp;#34;no dyes, no perfumes, no fragrances, etc&amp;#34; stuff and this olive oil could not be any more simple. It&#x27;s oxygen and olive oil.&lt;br /&gt;This is the only solution we use for our daughter during the winter months for her skin because it&#x27;s the only one that works. She constantly has staph and this oil kills it without the harsh side effects of steroids. I say that I only use this in the winter because it&#x27;s an emollient. During the summer, it&#x27;s hot and humid here in the South and the oil makes her break out in a heat rash. So I use a very thick Eucerin cream now.&lt;br /&gt;The other drawback is that it must stay refrigerated, so it&#x27;s not too convenient it that I can&#x27;t have it sitting on the changing table ready to go. Also, at first, the smell is terrible! But you get used to it after a few treatments.&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this!</li>
    <li> I used just a little of this stuff on my skin and got SICK!! This stuff is dangerous!! DON&#x27;T BUY!!!</li>
    <li> A buddy of mine mentioned that Ozonated Olive Oil was a \\&quot;miracle product\\&quot; and that I needed to try it for my kid&#x27;s Psoriasis and my dry skin.  He mentioned that all Ozonated Olive Oil is not created equal and that I should do some research.  I found these guys and ordered the product.  It was a bit stinky and I later lerned that actually the smellier the better as experts say.  I have become used to it and used it as a nightly ritual.  It has worked on the dry skin (for my kid and I) as well as a cut that I had from working in the garden.  The cut healed perfectly in two-three days after using this stuff.  I even read it works on crows feet.  After lifeguarding for years as a kid, this stuff has actually reduced my crows feet in a short week!  I&#x27;ll be using is sparingly and savoring it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks O3 Pure!  I&#x27;ll will be a returning customer!</li>
    <li> I ordered this for my dad who was having an issue with a weird, super itchy skin rash on his arms.  We don&#x27;t like using meds or store ointments so I thought I would give it a try.  Really worked well!  His rash was mostly gone in 24 hrs and now whenever he gets it starting again he puts a little on and its gone.  I also learned about using it as a deodorant and I love it.  This was well worth it!</li>
    <li> I had  bad burns to my scalp from a relaxer. I use this product and my burns were healed in 3&lt;br /&gt;days. The strong smell was a little hard to handle. It was pretty stinky. If you can stand the smell I recommend it for it&#x27;s healing powers.</li>
    <li> Amazing for all kinds of skin problems (even some of those that &amp;#34;have no cure&amp;#34; according to modern medicine, like psoriasis, pityriasis and other years-lasting problems), acne, any cuts, burns, sunburns, athlete&#x60;s foot, nail fungus, spider veins, boo-boos making any scars disappear. Works deep, I was so impressed I offered this as gifts to friends and family with diverse problems like listed above.&lt;br /&gt;Please note that your skin may have an adverse reaction at first (adverse, not side-effect !!), when the skin shows as if it worsens, that is just the surge, please allow it to work its wonders.&lt;br /&gt;Oh, it smoothens your wrinkles too.&lt;br /&gt;The best I used before was the coconut oil but this beats it, it just works faster ! (love coconut oil just as much)&lt;br /&gt;I use it on my pets with the same amazing success (they hate the smell but they&#x60;ll deal with it for a good treat).&lt;br /&gt;10 stars would still not show my full satisfaction !</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve read that olive oil has great properties for the skin, so I believe the reviews that say it&#x27;s effective.  It has a good effect on the chapped skin on my hands; however the odor is such that I would not go out in public with it.  It&#x27;s not disgusting but it is peculiar, and I can imagine getting some funny looks in a checkout line.  &amp;#34;Musty old books&amp;#34; is the closest I can come to describing it.  I&#x27;ve been able to mitigate the smell somewhat by spraying perfume over it, but this might negate some of the benefits, which is probably why they didn&#x27;t add perfume to begin with.  I&#x27;d like to find a better solution for olive oil cream.</li>
    <li> Just couldn&#x27;t get past the STANK! The product seemed perfectly fine and high quality as described just too smelly for me.</li>
    <li> This works great for pain on knees and rotary cuff helps you to get threw it and tape on some Therion magnets it really helps too or get some especially for the knees.  If your a female with a bad rotary cuff also get a wireless back support bra do all these for about 3 months an you not need surgery it worked for my mom!</li>
    <li> I had a person that made Ozonated water which really helped with my arthritis but can&#x27;t get any more. This product can get the containment out of a problem sore or area. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I bought it to help with a stagnant leg wound.  I&#x27;m not sure but I think it helped at one point.  It has an odd smell but that is part of its quirky charm.</li>
    <li> I have used various different Ozonated Olive Oil creams and this is a great one! The smell when I opened the container proved that it was fresh and it has lasted six months in the fridge without any problems. My family uses this on burns, cuts, scrapes, acne and I use it to help prevent wrinkles. I love this stuff. Thanks for making such a good product!</li>
    <li> Have purchased this before, and it is a miracle salve.  Highly recommend, I even use it on my pets to heal their paws or chapped nose.  Love natural remedies!</li>
    <li> This product works well but is very stiff when kept in the refrigerator.  I put it on my fathers legs that have some wounds due to skin breakdown.  I do have to say that his condition has been better with this cream, but it is very stiff and hard to get spread on his legs.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product after a friend of mine recommended it to me for skin care. He has beautiful skin so I trusted him. After reading and researching about ozonated olive oil, I use it for all scratches, rashes, and for removing my eye makeup. I&#x27;ve also used it for lubing my enema tip and there&#x27;s nothing else I would use for that! Sorry TMI but its the best for that in my opinion.</li>
    <li> Good Product with bad smell, but it is effective for worm bite. And the O3 smell is not so strong compare with other O3 product.</li>
    <li> This product totally healed my husband&#x27;s foot.  He had a would that would not heal and the doctor wanted to remove two of his toes surgically.  I bought this product and he applied it over a course of maybe 2 - 3 months every night and this product drew out the infection and then closed the flesh.  His foot now is as good as new.  No need to remove his toes.</li>
    <li> I was looking for ozonated olive oil and decided to try this brand. Excellent. The real deal. The company shipped in bubble wrap and enclosed a freezer gel pad to keep the item cool, as well as intructions to refrigerate 4 hrs before opening. Upon opening, the ozonated smell is strong, and the product stays really firm, almost hard, when refrigerated. Top quality.</li>
    <li> Tis is amazing stuff. Works to get rid of bad diaper rash in a day. You,ll need to keep it refridgerated and it has a smell but it&#x27;s amazing.</li>
    <li> This cleared up my son&#x27;s diaper rash over night, I have been trying everything to get rid of it, but nothing worked!&lt;br /&gt; Great product, am using it as my go to for spots, rashes, you name it.</li>
    <li> This product clears up skin lesions in as little as one application (gone in as little as 24 hours).  Many uses.</li>
    <li> I recommend this 100% my granddaughter suffers from Eczema and I used this on her skin and it has helped her tremendously.  Ordered a 2nd one.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t let the smell stop you from trying this. Smelly and greasy, this ointment will literally heal overnight. Small cuts, burns, blemishes etc. Just a tiny bit is needed. This is a must have for every household. I use it on my pets, no need to worry if f they lick it off because it is safe and natural.</li>
    <li> I dont know why the people always say this product works  this product doesnt work who say the true f.. !</li>
    <li> This is the first time that I have ever used this product. So far, I am satisfied with it. I would recommend this product to others.</li>
    <li> The Ozonated Olive OIl is amazing.  I put it onto a very large inflammation behind my right shoulder and it made things much better in the first 24 hours of use during which I had put it on just two times.  I&#x27;ll do the same thing for another 24 hours and I think it&#x27;ll be entirely taken care of.  I have used very little and will keep it in my refrigerator should I need it again.</li>
    <li> This thing is amazing!! I used it at night for acne, and it was significantly better the next day, and it disappeared in a week! As mentioned in the other comments, it has a slight smell, but it gets MUCH better if you use it more often. The first night was the worst, but after that, I don&#x27;t really notice the smell! An awesome product, shipped quickly in an insulated package with an ice pack, and will last a long time!</li>
    <li> Bought this for my son&#x27;s eczema, although it helped a little with it, but amazingly it got red of the planters warts on his hands.  Liquid nitrogen doesn&#x27;t even compare to how effectively it got rid of them, will still apply to eczema and see what happens.</li>
    <li> Hooray for this goop. It is miracle balm. More medicine that is non pharmaceutical! It works on rashes, acne, bacterial stuff... Honestly anything I&#x27;ve put it on, has disappeared within 48 hours.</li>
    <li> I actually rate this product a zero.... It&#x27;s too crease and it has a fowl odor.... I am so disappointed..... paid too much.... but I will have to throw the product away because I just can&#x27;t stand the smell, there&#x27;s nothing more I can do with it.</li>
    <li> Another reviewer wanted to give this product zero stars because it stinks, is greasy, and too expensive. Well, yes it stinks, because ozone has an odor.  And, yes, it is greasy, because it is an oil.  And, as far as being expensive, I don&#x27;t think $25 for a medical treatment is that far-fetched...not like it costs $100 for the jar. And, it will probably last forever, as a little goes along way, and I believe I read that in the refrigerator this stuff could last ten years.  That reviewer didn&#x27;t say if he used the product and it worked or didn&#x27;t work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are even thinking of purchasing this item, it is probably because you have a major problem that has not been improved with other treatments.  I know that was my case. Without going into details, I had a vaginal problem with major pain and discomfort and swelling.  No sores, but serious swelling and pain.  Two doctors couldn&#x27;t figure it out. I had tried every ointment out there.  I was desperate. I bought his product and it came professionally wrapped.  One night I couldn&#x27;t take the pain any longer, so I applied some.  In about fifteen seconds I felt relief.  And, after thirty seconds, I was sure this was helping.  When I woke up in the morning, NO PAIN and NO SWELLING.  I decided to apply more that morning to my vaginal area, just to make sure. It took just two applications for a complete cure, and I probably didn&#x27;t even need the second application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, this stuff is stinky. My pants smelled and others could smell it.  I even felt like it had permeated my body and I could even taste it, though maybe that was just from smelling it so much. However, it has been almost two weeks, and I am totally cured from two applications.  And, I had been battling this problem for months, every day, every second.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, it worked for me. I don&#x27;t know what I suffered from, but neither did two doctors, and now I am cured totally.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If this review uses a man&#x27;s name, that is because this account is in my husband&#x27;s name.is in my husband&#x27;s name.</li>
    <li> Six year old blonde daughter (cutie) with Genetic Eczema.&lt;br /&gt;Have tried several products prescription and over-the-counter medication.&lt;br /&gt;This products smell is similar to that of Vicks-Vapor-Rub.&lt;br /&gt;Smell strong at first then soaks-in and wears down.&lt;br /&gt;It’s too soon to tell for sure if it works but, seems to be helping.&lt;br /&gt;If it works for sure, will not care about smell don’t what my daughter ending-up with scaring from itching dry skin.&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes you learn to compromise when it comes to a fix of a condition.&lt;br /&gt;I’ll try to keep you updated in the weeks to come.</li>
    <li> A very unusual product.  Was shipped correctly and I made sure I placed it in the refrigerator immediately.  It has helped with old acne scars and I will continue to use it until it is gone.  Has a very strong smell, but you can tolerate it.  I may purchase again.  I will have to wait and see.</li>
