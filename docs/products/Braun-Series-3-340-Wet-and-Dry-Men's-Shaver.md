      <li>Nice stand up or lay-down charge option..</li>
      <li>if you are looking for a good electric razor i would surely recommend this one.</li>
      <li>I gave the Braun an honest month</li>
      <li>Rinse with warm water.</li>
      <li>This razor has done a great job of giving me a clean shave with zero pulling of my skin or beard hair</li>
      <li>Great price and works just right for me!</li>
      <li>this shaver is great, i suggest this to anyone who&#x27;s looking for a good, comfortable, clean shave.</li>
      <li>Light is good.</li>
      <li>To be honest, the Braun shaves so close that I should be satisfied considering the results I used to receive from disposables.</li>
      <li>Used a Norelco for many years and liked it</li>
      <li>this Braun shaver is priced right and works great.</li>
      <li>It tore again this morning, and this is with very light use, so I&#x27;m done with this model.  </li>
      <li>i always shave against the grain towards the end of my shave, with cartridge razors, to ensure a very smooth face.</li>
      <li>bottom line with this Model 3-340 is I am perfectly satisfied with it.</li>
      <li>I am in my 50&#x27;s and have used Braun shavers for many years.  </li>
      <li>Maybe most of them will, but this one doesn&#x27;t.  </li>
      <li>Wahl Electric Trimmer Oil) more often.  </li>
      <li>it is okay</li>
      <li>But I do plan to go that route if it means this razor stays in top shape.    </li>
      <li>I am now going to order a Panasonic - hopefully they are better.</li>
      <li>The on/off switch on this Bruan shaver feels like it&#x27;s more</li>
      <li>I guess its back to Panasonic and Remington to see what works best for my mugg.  </li>
      <li>I like it better than the Remington.</li>
      <li>There I use this Braun and it works ok.</li>
      <li>It shaves much better.</li>
      <li>This razor works better than described.</li>
      <li>When I switched to this razor recently I was very happy with the results.</li>
      <li>All in all, the Braun 340 Series 3 is just okay</li>
      <li>how many shaves one can get on one charge.</li>
      <li>but this is a lot more convenient.  </li>
      <li>The top of the T is what moves the blades in the head.   </li>
      <li>Braun&#x27;s foils and cutter blades hold up much better than the Remington razors I have owned.</li>
      <li>I have tried many others some specifically for the head and this shaver beats them all.</li>
      <li>The Braun Series 3 340 Men&#x27;s Shaver was a replacement for another Braun shaver I had had for more than 8 years.</li>
      <li>So much better quality and engineering than the Braun.  </li>
      <li>as it is a Braun I expect to have it for many years to come.</li>
      <li>OK  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s just what I wanted and more and</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad I did.  </li>
      <li>I was a blade shaver most of my life (I&#x27;m 70).</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Good performing shaver.  Excellent build quality.  Contours the face while providing a smooth shave with no irritation.  Gives a much better shave than my panasonic which seems to have inferior cutting blades.  Much more quick and comfortable to use and glides over the face while cutting.  Braun makes very nice shavers and are highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been shaving with Remington shavers for the past 10 years. When I switched to this razor recently I was very happy with the results. My take:     Pros:   1- Close comfortable shave.   2- Spring flex cutting edge moderate skin pressure and makes shave comfortable  3- Motor is smooth and not noisy.   4- Holds charge for a long time  5- Catches all hairs and shaves in reasonable time.     Cons:   1- Does not work with cord shaving. Must always charge 1st and then shave. \  2- Price is a bit higher than Remington and Panasonic.     I&#x27;m very happy with it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used a number of Braun shavers over the years, with consistently good results. Unfortunately, the 340, which I recently purchased, gives a terrible shave. It&#x27;s painful, with regular nasty tugs on skin &amp; hair, and the it doesn&#x27;t result in a close shave, even after applying lots of elbow grease. It&#x27;s an awful product, and Braun should re-think their current line &amp; approach, if the 340 is any indication. This is the most uncomfortable shave I&#x27;ve ever had with an electric shaver.</li>
    <li> I should have read the reviews before buying this, as a replacement for my earlier Braun shaver. This is a very poor shaver: it hurts, and does not provide a close shave at all. It seems the main feature is you can use it in the shower... I then bought a series 5, more expensive but similar to the comfort and quality I was used to.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this for two shaves so far.  It gives me a nice, close shave, no razor burn (I get razor burn from the Norelco 3 round head style.) It is fairly quiet, charges pretty quickly, is comfortable in my hand and not bad looking, either.  I would have no trouble recommending it based on its performance so far.  I don&#x27;t see how the performance could degrade at this point. The only thing I&#x27;d be concerned with is the battery, but don&#x27;t think that will be a concern for a year or more.</li>
    <li> I was very skepical about finding a razor that would be right for me.  I am sixty-five and all my life had a tough beard.  I started shaving at 14.  But this looks like the one.  Also, on some things you cannot get away without spending a little money.  I had another brand and cheaper razor which I was unhappy with in a little more than a month.  This one in no time at all, has made me a happy person.  Love the closeness, the lasting power without charging.  Thank you Braun.</li>
    <li> Ive been a long time blade user... for years.. the last electric razor I used was over 10 years ago..  As a new father I find my daily time a little more rushed then it was a year ago.. :)  My old razor was a Panasonic Wet/Dry unit.    So, I looked at reviews of many other electric razors.  Came down to this Braun 340 Series 3.  I picked my razor up at Target in the Spring of 09 for around $50.  I could not see spending $50 more for the self cleaning stand and option (Braun 390 Series 3).. and the 370 is $20 more - and it gives you the \\&quot;contour\\&quot; head... neither of which I really feel you need when this razor is the same blade head!    This razor has several nice features (Pros);  Quick Recharge Time with NiMH batteries - Lights on the razor indicate charge/ low charge.  5 min quick charge if needed to get time in for a fast shave.    Feels good in your hand, hefty.  Non slip grip, even when wet.    Easy to move flip-up clippers from the back.    Simple no bumble on-off push button.    Nice stand up or lay-down charge option.. base use is optional.    Washable, blades.  Easy to care for.      Unit is shower use friendly.  However Braun recommends shaving before washing your face.  I do find that to work the best.    Battery life is very good.  I do put it back on the charger once a week - even if it needs it or not.  I did get a full 10 days out of the razor before the red \\&quot;low charge\\&quot; light came on.  @ about 5 min a day of shaving.  Even with the red light on, the razor stayed running @ full power.  It regains a full charge after 1 hour.    And finally, - THE SHAVE!  ITS GREAT!  Smooth, clean, no hassle, no bumps.  Ive only used the razor for two weeks - but I NEVER HAD A PROBLEM with bumps or rashes!  The beauty of this razor is it has three cutting surfaces.  Two foil sections, and then a center section that snips longer neck hairs.  The razor as a whole does a really good job at \\&quot;problem\\&quot; areas like around my neck.. I had problems with my last razor in that area,and I always needed to clean up with a blade razor.    Cons - I guess I could say that I wont be looking foreword to a $25 blade set 18 months from now.  But I do plan to go that route if it means this razor stays in top shape.    Cleaning, while running it under water is a snap.  The guide says that weekly to use the oil and lube the blades.  Not a big deal, but its something that you&#x27;ll likely forget.    Unit comes with Razor, (optional use) stand, charging cord, oil, cleaning brush, blade cover, instructions/tip guide.    [...]</li>
    <li> I was really surprised at my terrible experience with this razor.     I had always liked Braun products and had a wonderful razor from them for about 20 years. They don&#x27;t seem to make them as well anymore. This model stopped working correctly on about the 31st day after a 30-day money back guarantee, by not turning off. It just rattled for an hour or two until it ran down. I recharged it and it came on (loudly) in the middle of the night. So I sent it to a service center.     They sent it back about six weeks later without comment. At this point, it would turn off, but it had a new problem: the trimmer would not slide out. Then, after about five shaves, it started doing the same thing - it would not turn off.     Sadly, the new reality is avoid Braun razors at all cost. They really seem to have gone downhill. So sad for what was a legacy brand.</li>
    <li> For years I used the Norelco circular blade shavers and they worked okay.  I always felt the straight model shavers would give me a closer shave.  Maybe most of them will, but this one doesn&#x27;t.  I have owned it since Christmas and wanted to give it a shot for a few months before I gave it a negative review.  Even when I only haven&#x27;t shaven since yesterday, I have to go over my face 3 or 4 times to get everything.  Wet shave doesn&#x27;t seem to help.  It just amazes me it can go over a patch of hair and no do anything to it.  I&#x27;ve even tried Lectric Shave, and it doesn&#x27;t help much.  And you can tell when the battery starts to get low because it decides to rip the hairs out of my face instead of cut them.  I&#x27;m amazed at how much this costs for the quality, I would recommend going the Norelco route or a higher model with better ratings.  Skip the series 3.</li>
    <li> I am a very hairy man, with thick gorilla type hair.  The Braun Series 3 tried to keep up with the mess on my face, but unfortunately fell a little short.  I was rooting for it; I was patient, gave my face the 3 weeks the instructions said to give your face time to adapt.  I used it wet, dry, immediately after waking up, in the shower...all with the same result.  I fastidiously cleaned it, took the blades apart to restore it to new condition all with mediocre results.    Truth be told, if you are only a partially hairy man, with thin hair this razor might be ok.  I was able to get decent shaves after literally 20 minutes of rubbing this thing across my face.  I had to go over the same area way more than I should have, and fortunately my technique (and the razor) kept me from getting rashes.  Then after all that I had to take my 6 month old Gillette Fusion and clean up the rest of my face.  I gave the Braun an honest month and it has earned a return trip back to Boston.  I&#x27;m going to take the $90 or so I paid for this and invest in a good safety razor say a [[ASIN:B000JPKLUU Merkur Futur Safety Razor - Satin Finish]] and a quality brush &amp; soap.</li>
    <li> I tried an electric shaver years ago and it was too rough on my face.  So after years of using blades I decided to one again try an electric shaver.  This one does not seem to be too rough on my face but it takes some effort to shave, especially closely.    The bottom line is that this is good for normal shaving, but I will still use a blade for special occasions when how I look really matters.</li>
    <li> Received the shaver promptly.  When I charged the shaver, the charging light did not operate properly. It did&#x27;nt blink as it was supposed to, to indicate that it was charging properly.  Also didn&#x27;t blink as it should have when charging was complete. I called the Braun office at the number provided to inquire about this apparent defect.  The woman I talked to told that that \\&quot;blink\\&quot; meant one thing to the Germans and something else to us (Americans, English?) and that I shouldn&#x27;t worry about the status lights. \\&quot;The shaver is working fine\\&quot;, she said. I removed the charger after the supposed required number of hours and the shaver did operate as it should.  I have used the shaver about a half dozen time so far and it seems to be holding a charge OK  Operation is quiet, compared to my old Remington and the shave seems to be pretty good. So far, so good.  I&#x27;ll reserve final judgement until I&#x27;ve recharged it at least a half dozen times.</li>
    <li> I have used either Norelco or Remington rotary razors exclusively for over 30 years. This is my first foil razor. I like it a lot. Its easy to clean and in my opinion gives a better shave than the rotaries. I noticed that many of the people giving negative reviews are long time Braun users. Perhaps there is something to it. Perhaps they truly \\&quot;don&#x27;t make um like they used to\\&quot;. I don&#x27;t know. What I do know is this razor was cheaper than the high end rotaries and gives good value for the money. I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> Easy to use.  Shaves very close.  Shaves long hairs too. I have had 2 Remingtons, 2 Norelcos and this is my 2nd Braun. Remingtons were the worst... I have an almost new F5790 that I wasted $50 on... Norelcos not too bad...have to press firm and go over and over.  This Braun shaves the closest, fastest and with the least amount of effort.</li>
    <li> This is a poorly performing and poorly engineered shaver.  It takes several passes to cut even a day&#x27;s growth of whiskers, and it does not even touch long whiskers unless the trimmer is used.  The head tends to come off too easily during shaving if one presses too hard or if one&#x27;s face is wet.  Also the on/off button is right where the thumb rests during shaving, so the tendency is to inadvertently turn the razor on &amp; off.  I would not purchase ANY Braun again.  This razor is TERRIBLE!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used other Braun shavers in the past, but this one is truly terrible.  It will not cut stubble over one day old with the foil. You have to use the trimmer on even the shortest stubble, then go back with the foil (over and over again) to try to get anything approaching a close shave.  Really not worth the money.  Try another one.</li>
    <li> I have been shaving my head for over 10 years.  Initially I purchased two Panasonic 3800 Wet/Dry razors.  They did a good job and lasted about 8 years, using them alternately.  I purchased another Panasonic, not the same model, that lasted a few months. I bought a Torq as a backup.  The Torq did a good job, so, I went to buy another one.  I guess they do not make them anymore.  Decided to try this Braun razor which resembles the original Panasonics I had.  It is fantastic.  I&#x27;ve never had such an easy, comfortably shaved head.  As a matter-or-fact I still check my head, while I&#x27;m shaving, to make sure it is removing hair.  It is so smooth. I love it.  I wet my head down in the shower.  I use pre electric shave.  It helps the razor glide easier and it also lubricates the blades.</li>
    <li> Shaving with razor blades has gotten more difficult as I get older.  My face has gotten craggier and my eyesight poorer.  It is a rare day that I don&#x27;t draw blood.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A friend told me how much he liked his Braun shaver so when I saw this model at such a reasonable price, I decided to give electric shavers another try.  And, I am amazed.  The Braun makes shaving a pleasure.  Even if I press down firmly to get a closer shave, the Braun simply glides over my face.  No pulling, no scraping.  It almost feels like a massage. However, it is NOT a close shave...my 5 o&#x27;clock shadow arrives around 3 p.m.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The charger does a great job.  A two hour charge provides a week worth of shaves (eight or ten shaves).  When the red warning light comes on, you are able to get a couple more shaves before charging.  If you ever let the battery go to zero, you can \\&quot;quick charge\\&quot; it for just one shave with a five or ten minute charge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also have an inexpensive Norelco that provides a MUCH closer shave...but the Norelco irritates the skin on my neck.  I&#x27;ll use the Norelco when I need a super close shave, but for most days, I prefer the comfort of the Braun.</li>
    <li> In the spirit of full disclosure: I hate to shave.  But having said that, I can report that I&#x27;ve been using the Braun model 340 shaver for about a month now, and couldn&#x27;t be happier.  It actually gives me a \\&quot;baby&#x27;s butt\\&quot; smooth shave with minimal fuss.  This is a big change from the multi-head rotary shavers I&#x27;d been using in recent years, which never really seemed to give me a truly close shave.  I still hate to shave, but at least now I&#x27;ve got very good results to show for the effort.</li>
    <li> My last electric shaver was a Braun, that I bought about 10 years ago. It shaved fast and close. I lost it on vacation in Alaska.  Of course I went out and bought another Braun.  Big mistake!  This is the WORST electric shaver I have ever used.   It does not cut well, it does not shave close, no matter how much time you spend shaving, and it seems to work best by ripping the whiskers out by the roots - very painful.  Not a great idea if you need to shave around a beard, unless you are some special kind of Masochist.  It seems here, like many other technologies, that the design secrets have been lost, and every \\&quot;technological advance\\&quot; is a retrograde step.</li>
    <li> My Remington triple header gives a better shave. This shaver is made well but does  not shave as close as my Remington..</li>
    <li> This is now my third Braun shaver and I must say that my experience with this new 3 series has already been quite dismal after only 3 weeks of use. First allow me to go back over previous recent shaver experiences.   With my previous Braun shavers providing me with a shaving experience akin to a weed whacker hacking it&#x27;s way through a dense forest of 6 foot wide tree trunks, I was a bit apprehensive about going down the same road.   I had previously refused to spend the exorbitant amount of money Braun requires of consumers to get even a decent shave. I didn&#x27;t give a crap about the gimmickry and foolishness of cleaning cartridges and pulsing waves, I just wanted a good shave.   The previous 2 Braun models were no nonsense shavers and unfortunately, no results shavers. Disgusted I tried a remington only to develop a serious rash on my cheeks and dismal quality, especially on the underside of the chin and the neck area. Whats more, the remington&#x27;s foil head lasted barely 4 months before being eaten through by the cutter beneath. $75 down the drain. Well, here we are back at the time when I was shopping for a new shaver again, as my remington debacle forced me to go back to the Braun that was now also eating thru it&#x27;s screen as well(at least I got a little over a year out of it, and it was a $40 shaver)   I saw the 3 series with it&#x27;s new no nonsense, no cleaner reservoir but still the same quality cutting head found in the ridiculously overpriced models. I was intrigued. The price seemed right at $65 (at Target) so I went ahead and bought it.   After charging it up, I found it difficult to discern whether the thing was really working or not, it was so quiet. It was indeed working however, and my face enjoyed the experience. I wasn&#x27;t too pleased to discover however, that the neck and chin underside area were still a concern (as always). Then something else happened too.   I was noticing that a half hour to an hour after shaving, my face seemed bristled. My theory is, that the pulsing sensation of the shaver swells the skin temporarily and the hairs seem to have been properly cut, but when the swelling goes down (especially right now, with the weather being cold and the skin tightens)the results of the inferior shave are all too clear. My suspicions are founded when I open the foil head to discover a lesser amount of cut hair debris than my old hack away shavers.   Also, the company claims that you can get 5 days of shaving out of a typical full charge. Because of the added effort I have to go thru to get my chin and neck shaved properly, making pass after pass after pass in varying directions and circular motions and pretzel-like positions that even puzzle master Rubik would raise an eyebrow to, I am lucky to get two days of a good shave (for this shaver) and then a horrible shaving experience the third day when the charge is low and halfway thru the shave, dies entirely, forcing a 5 minute charge to try and finish the job, if I am lucky.   This whole experience is more than disheartening, its unbelievable for the simple fact that this company (and all shaver companies) are allowed to get away with such price gouging while providing not only an inferior product, but such a miserable experience in the process. I am taking my case to Braun on behalf of the millions of men who have to deal with this absurd stupidity when all they want is what the product is supposed to be designed to do. Thats what we are paying for, and if it has to cost more, then it better damn well do BETTER than what is expected of it, MORE than just the bare (or not so bare,in the stubble faced case here) minimum of providing an adequate shave.   We should all revolt against these shoddy, inferior products and refuse to buy unless they raise their standards accordingly. I believe it&#x27;s time for the consumer groups and unions and the better business bureau to become more involved in this fight, and that&#x27;s where I will next go if Braun cannot satisfactorily appease my complaints.</li>
    <li> It does a good job with short stubble but the long stubble cutters don&#x27;t seem to work very well for me, perhaps as my whiskers don&#x27;t grow out straight.  Also, if you have mustache and/or beard you&#x27;re shaving around, long hairs can get caught in the cutting foil.  Battery life is very good.</li>
    <li> I was given a Braun shaver for xmas which I didn&#x27;t use until the end of January. Today, March 11, 2010, I gave up and used my 10 year old Norelco. For the first time since when I started with the Braun, I got a decent shave even though it is past time for new rotarty blades for the Norelco. With the Braun you must run the shaver over your beard 4 -5 times to get a lousy shave, the 10 yr old Norelco does it in less than half the time.    Today I tried to contact Braun, a waste of time. The Android hangs up before you can talk to a real live person. The email option only gives you a chance for a review.    I&#x27;M so happy I still have my Norelco.</li>
    <li> Used a Norelco for many years and liked it but it was a little rough on my skin. The Braun gives just as smooth and  close shave but much easier on my face!</li>
    <li> I purchased the Braun 340 3 after researching other reviewers opinions. I agree with Common sence that the 340 with the same head as the more expensive models that sell for well over $100.00 made more sence than to spend a bundle on something I don&#x27;t see as all that important--such as the self cleaning models. Obviously Braun is bilking all of us with the price of their Cadillac models. My feeling is that even at just under $60.00 and free shp. which I paid at Amazon--could be considered a good deal is high enough in todays market for this item made in CHINA with low cost labor. We American&#x27;s are playing our part exactly as the Multi-National Corporations have intended to make them filthy rich--One shave at a time!!! As for the product itself.  It is all anyone can expect from an electric.  My only complaint is with the engineering of the clip on guard to (protect) the shaving head from being damaged in a travel bag etc., etc. The guard simply is not going to stay on unless you wrap masking tape or something around the guard to secure it--It is just that flimsy! Worthless would better describe the design of this guard.  Braun engineers have made a guard that is really top notch though--My old Braun marked (series 1 190) has a guard that when snapped on stays on. Just to hear the (click) sound will assure you that the guard will not allow the head go unguarded by slipping off in a travel bag. Maybe Braun engineers were ordered to design such a useless guard for the Series 3 fully realizing that the thing is sure to fail thereby racking up sales of replacements for damaged heads, Who knows?  One thing we do know is this--What traveler wants to get to their destination only to discover the guard came off in transit and the head of their shaver has been ruined?  It is my assumption that all Series 3 shavers are sold with this useless guard?  I only wish the right people at Braun could read this review and take this (lesson on engineering) to heart.</li>
    <li> seems to be water proof and works pretty well over all would recommend this would be better than if they are more waterproff</li>
    <li> I have been using two Braun 6520 shavers:  one at home and one for travel.  I thought I might try a newer model and decided to try the 340 model.   After using it for 6 weeks I have gone back to the 6520 at home because:  the 340 does not shave as well,  it runs slower, it is harder to keep the shaver head clean.  Only if I had not tried or been using a 6520 would I ever consider the 340 - in other words if I did not know any better!  The 340 is not worth the money!</li>
    <li> After using it the first time and zero lotion I didn&#x27;t have redness due to irritation. Overtime will tell but I maybe a Braun owner from know on.</li>
    <li> Great Shaver. It gives a close shave almost as close as a manual shaver. It takes me half the time to shave now, so its great when I have to get ready in a hurry.</li>
    <li> After reading the reviews, I bought this shaver for my boyfriend for a Christmas present. I want a shaver that he can use anywhere and anytime. He made a comment that it was great to have, but not good enough to do the job right. It does not come close enough to the chin and neck area, that he has to shave with a razor blade afterwards. But on the positive side, he said that it doesn&#x27;t leave his face feeling chaffed after a razor shave, and his face is not as red, that I usually notice with a razor shave.</li>
    <li> Not a good product. The top of the razor pops off randomly while shaving and make a mess.</li>
    <li> Very satisfied with the closeness of the shave.  It only needs charged once a week, so far.  This is at least my 4th or 5th Braun Shaver.  Each one has lasted many years and my last one I handed down to my son.  I also kept one of the old ones for a spare.  Braun is an excellent choice.</li>
    <li> Like several reviewers, I have used Braun shavers for many years. I decided it was time for a new one, and I settled on the 340. It is the suck. It doesn&#x27;t give a good shave.  It yanks rather than cuts any stubble.  The foil blade cover is more delicate than a spider web.  I&#x27;ve replaced it once, and that wasn&#x27;t cheap. It tore again this morning, and this is with very light use, so I&#x27;m done with this model.  I&#x27;ve used my 20-year old Braun more often anyway.  The only problem with it is it won&#x27;t hold a charge any longer.  If it is plugged in, it is fine.  So I&#x27;ll keep using my retro Braun as long as it still works.  By the way, that old shaver was made in Germany.  As far as I&#x27;ve been able to determine, most, if not all Braun shavers are now made in China, like everything else. That is likely the problem. I&#x27;d pay five times as much for a solid Braun that was made in Germany.</li>
    <li> I actually bought one for my husband at Target because we saw it on sale, but we were planning on buying it from here.  His Remington that he had used for 10 years and spent $130 on finally gave out and he was very apprehensive about finding a cost effective replacement that would give the same kind of quality.  For the price he figured it was worth a shot despite some of the bad reviews, but is now raving that it&#x27;s just as good if not better than the one he had replaced it with!  Battery life is excellent, gives a very close shave, and is excellent quality.  You just need to make sure you maintain it the way you&#x27;re instructed to do so and shave according to the recommendations in the manual.  Reading goes a long way!</li>
    <li> This is a nice shaver. Compared to my old Braun that I used for many years it is quieter. The overall shave is good as it gives a close shave and the trimmer for long facial hair and sideburns works well also. It charges very quickly and has an indicator light to tell you that it is charging but you cannot use it as a corded shaver. It works cordless only. It is a little  pricy but overall it is worth it.</li>
    <li> After being a satisfied user of Braun electric shavers for several decades, the 340 is the end of the line for me.  Regardless of features and design, the bottom line is how a shaver cuts whiskers and this one doesn&#x27;t - at least not very well.    The fault probably lies in the design of the fully-floating cutter head and foil.  In(advertising)theory, having all three (each foil and the long-whisker cutter)float independently should provide more comfort, but the the head ends up floating across your face and whiskers instead of doing its intended job.  In addition, the long whisker cutter in the middle of the head is recessed too far to pick up much, and the holes in the twin foils seem too small to easily capture the rest.    The result is a shaver that requires a great deal of pressure against your face in order to get any sort of acceptable shave.  But if you accidentally press too hard while the head is at an angle on your face, the head falls off of the razor and hits the floor.  This is the only exploding shaver of any brand that I&#x27;ve ever owned.    Nor is the \\&quot;cool\\&quot; curved design so great, coupled as it is with a 90 degree sideburn trimmer.  If you try to use the other, or \\&quot;back\\&quot;, side of the shaver, you can easily and painfully scrape the sideburn trimmer across your face.    Shaving performance could be cured with a decent replacement head designed by the engineering department instead of the marketing department.  But since Braun is now owned by Procter &amp; Gamble, don&#x27;t hold your breath.    In short I wish I&#x27;d bought a different model, but since this one is so far off the mark, I won&#x27;t buy any other Braun.    January 14, 2011 Update:    OK that&#x27;s it - I&#x27;ll never buy ANY Braun product again.  Today I tapped the plastic shaving head on the side of the sink to empty the whiskers (as I&#x27;ve done for decades with previous Braun shavers) and the plastic skirt around the head broke.  The part is paper-thin and I have to buy a whole new cutter asswmbly to fix my 3-month old shaver. Cost? $25.99 for a $69.77 shaver, or 37% of the cost of an entire new shaver!  NEVER!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> This is a great razor and it arrived quickly and new.  I had bought one elsewhere and it worked so good compared to any previous razor I stopped using pre shave oils.  On Amazon I bought the second one for when I travel.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;M A BRAUN SHAVER USER FOR OVER 15 YEARS.  I HAD BEEN USING SAME OLD MODEL SERIES 1 FIRST VERSION (I BELEIVE, ) FOR OVER 10 YEARS AND IT WAS WORKING GREAT FOR ME.  ONLY PROBLEM WAS WHERE CONNECT FOIL AND CARTRIDGE SHAVER ARE WEAK AND FRAGILE.  SO IT CAN BREAK EASIELY. I PURCHASED REPLACEMENT CARTRIDGES FOR ABOUT 4 TIMES IN THE PAST.   IT COSTED ME  ABOUT $20~30 FOR 1 CARTRIDGE REPLACEMENT,    AND I REALIZED THAT BRAND NEW MODEL SHAVER DOESN&#x27;T COST MUCH DIFFERENT THAN REPLACEMENT.  SO THIS TIME I PURCHASED SERIES 1 BRAND NEW 2010 MODEL.  IT WAS WRONG CHOICE! AND I MADE BIG MISTAKE.  FIRST OF ALL IT SHAVES REALLY LESS, AND COULDN&#x27;T SHAVE THEM OFF FOR OVER 5 MINUTES. SAME AREA BACK AND FORTH.  OLD ONE (OVER 10 YEARS) TAKES ONLY A FEW MINUTES TO SHAVE ALL OFF CLEAN...  THEN THIS POWER CABLE IS SOFT AND VERY EASY TO TANGLED UP.  ALSO HEAD IS WIDE SO YOU CAN NOT REALLY SHAVE DETAILS OR SMALL AREAS CLEANER.  IS THIS REALLY 2010 MODEL???  IT WAS WORST EXPERIENCE OF MY LIFE.  BRAUN NEEDS TO UPDATE AND REMODEL ALL THE SHAVERS.  REALLY SUCKS!  NOWADAYS TECHNOLOGY AND STILL A PIECE OF CRAP.  I&#x27;M ORIGINALLY FROM TOKYO JAPAN AND WE KNOW THAT WE CAN NOT COMPARE ANY ELECTRONIC PRODUCTS WITH USA.  IT&#x27;S LIKE HIGH END LUXURY VS  PIECE OF CRAP (1 GENERATION OLD). THAT WAS 15 YEARS AGO.  AND STILL THE SAME.  DO NOT RECOMMEND ANYONE WHO REAL;LY NEED SHAVER.  I RECOMMEND ALL JAPANESE PRODUCTS FOR WORTH MONEY AND QUALITY OF PRODUCTS.  ESPECIALLY ELECTRONICS PRODUCTS.</li>
    <li> I was a blade shaver most of my life (I&#x27;m 70). I was tired of it, so decided on this Braun.. It performs as expected, except it takes longer to get a fairly descent shave, than I expected ... no big deal. I shave every other day, mostly&lt;br /&gt;See other reviews ... Shave slowly, against the grain. I no longer use burning after shave lotion. I use Nivea after shave balm. I&#x27;ll try other a.s. brands, over time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: 12/1/2013 - Shortly after writing above review the razor started acting up, pulling at the face hairs. I mailed it to the shop Braun has the work done (around $8?). It came back quicker than I expected (about 7-10 days), and is working again. No charge. I had been using an older Norelco in the meantime, and the fixed-Braun gives a much better shave. Of course, it&#x27;s newer.</li>
    <li> 1st order from Amazon---easy to do, came on time, met criteria, gifted item---did not use personally.   I ordered a Braun becaue we have always had superior experirnce with their shavers!!!!! When I say always---I am retired great grandmother!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s excellent machine and sufficient</li>
    <li> The Braun Series 3 340 Men&#x27;s Shaver was a replacement for another Braun shaver I had had for more than 8 years. I had been very happy with it but it eventually just needed a replacement.  Because my Braun shaver had always been reliable, serviceable and just plain good at what it did I first thought of Braun, of course, to replace it.  I&#x27;m glad I did.  The newer model is noticeably quieter than my older model and its head design shaves closer and more quickly.  It&#x27;s just what I wanted and more and as it is a Braun I expect to have it for many years to come.</li>
    <li> After using a simple single cutter (closer to the now available PocketGo&#x27;s) model Braun a few years ago and then switching to Philips, Norelco and Remington I have returned to Braun.  I must say I am delightfully surprised and so far no brand changing crosses my mind.  The shave is MUCH CLOSER (razor like close) than any of the other brands I have ever used, even my prior Braun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This unit has its limitations, but I prefer such units than the fancy self-cleaning, huge base, gel dispensing, blah blah units.  This unit is extremely portable, to the point where the base included is totally optional, I have stashed it somewhere it will not interfere and left only the brush, cable and oil at hand.  They, and the shaver unit, snuggly fit in my hair clipper box, so it&#x27;s literally occupying no space at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I shave dry and only use a preshave if trying to get rid of late day shadows.  No bumps, no redness, no irritation.  This for me is the REAL SALE, for I cannot shave using a regular razor because I&#x27;ll be red and bumpy for days (literally).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only real con I find is I am unable to operate the unit while it is plugged in.  Otherwise, I am happier now than with any of my prior shavers.</li>
    <li> Purchased this as a replacement for my aging 5 series Braun.  First impression is that it has a much wider shaving surface and it is more quiet.  Shaving results are better and battery life is good, so I am happy.</li>
    <li> With a weak motor and poor performance, this is the worst Braun shaver I&#x27;ve ever had.  The shaver construction materials seem good, but the shaver just doesn&#x27;t give you a close shave, even after several passes.</li>
    <li> This is my second Braun shaver.  The first one was good, this one is better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like everything about it.  It shaves closer and faster than the one it replaced and I like the convenient charging stand that comes with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve noticed that several of the negative reviews mention that it doesn&#x27;t work well on thick, heavy beards.  But I have a light, soft beard, so perhaps a common failing with electric shavers is those that work well with light beards won&#x27;t work well with heavy ones.  And this is probably true in reverse because I&#x27;ve had a couple of shavers, including a Panasonic that I paid $125 for, which did a terrible job for me but earned very positive reviews from others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottom line with this Model 3-340 is I am perfectly satisfied with it.</li>
    <li> My husband requested this for Christmas because of the previous Braun he had and loved. This style # was actually a little different than what he had but he really does like this one, It gives a nice close, smooth shave and the price was the best here at Amazon, plus aways a bonus when you get free shipping on items.</li>
    <li> The Amazon page for the Braun shavers only shows pictures of boxes or one view with no useable description.  I wanted a shaver to replace the shaver for my Braun 360 cleaning system.  I bought the shaver next to the picture of a 360 system and I got a shaver totally different from the item I wanted and completely incompatible with the 360 cleaning unit.</li>
    <li> Ref the Braun Series 3 340 Wet and dry model, I read all those great shaver reveiws about this model, but the one I purchased does not give a clean shave. Have to pass over and over to get a not too good a shave. This shaver model does not work when you plug it in to charge the battery.  If battery goes out you cannot use the shaver. New technology, ha ha. Went back to old Series 3 340 Shaver, not wet and dry model. Get nice clean shave.  Don&#x27;t believe Braun produces this model anymore.  Had to purchase new head and cutter for older model to keep in service. This model can be used when the battery is discharged by plugging into AC power.    Do not recommend purching wet &amp; dry model.                                        ser</li>
    <li> This is the second Braun Shaver. I like that it is a wet dry shaver. It is quieter than my last one. It also has a wider head and seems smoother on the face. Love the pop-up trimmer, my last one had a trimmer too, and would not get one with out one.Faster shipping that they said too.</li>
    <li> I have a beard and a bald head and it does a great job on my head. I recommend it  for shaving ones head. I have tried many others some specifically for the head and this shaver beats them all.</li>
    <li> I have had my 340 for 3 years. I now have 2 holes in the foil which are tearing up my face! It would cost me $30.14 to replace the inexpensive foil from Braun as they, and all sites that I have found, force you to buy part# 30B which includes the other items that hopefully I would not need for a couple of more years. This appears to be planned obsolescence to make a large profit! It would make it much more customer friendly if the foil was offered as the inexpensive part that it is as an option to retain the customers. I am on my out to buy any razor that does not say BRAUN!!</li>
    <li> I bought this to replace my Braun 6250.  It works great and provides a great shave.  Being able to use it wet or dry is plus.  It&#x27;s a little disappointing that you can&#x27;t shave with it while it&#x27;s being charged, but the battery life is very good and they promise that a 5 min quick-charge gives it enough juice for one shave.  So far (1 month after purchase) I haven&#x27;t missed any of the other features provided by the more expensive models in this series of shavers and I have been happy with the purchase.</li>
    <li> This is the third Braun shaver that I have purchased, first the Syncro shaver 7000, then the Braun 360 complete, and now this one the series 3 340. The 340 is lacking the side to side movement or &#x27;active head&#x27; that my previous Braun shavers had, but the foils are more flexible allowing the cutters to float to match the profile of my face better which results in a good quality shave.  Having said this, the lack of a cleaning stand is in my opinion a disadvantage due to the redesigned cutter and foil which is now an integrated cassette type of assembly, meaning that the individual foil and cutter cannot be separated for cleaning. They tend to accumulate debris that is hard to remove.  I find that the cassette becomes difficult to clean thoroughly under the faucet, and the price of cassette is higher than the typical cutter block and foil.    Bottom line, this is a very good entry level electric shaver that will give a close and comfortable shave. But the higher cost of replacement cassette cartridges, and lack of a cleaning station are disadvantages.</li>
    <li> I just bought my first electric razor, this Braun Series 3 340, after spending about 3.5 decades (I just turned 50) as a razor shaver. I used to use the Mach3 razors. Anyway, I&#x27;ve used this product for a few weeks now, and I am happy with it. It shaves my face exremely well, but it requires at least 2 passes under your jawline for your entire neck area. Having said that, I&#x27;m done shaving in 60-70 seconds every morning. I like the easy washability of the product, its cutting capability for my face, and the money I paid (only $60 at Target). The charger seems cheap though, so we&#x27;ll see how long that lasts. But after a few weeks, I&#x27;m thoroughly pleased with this product. It&#x27;s a good value, no-frills electric shaver!</li>
    <li> I bought this new Braub 340 to replace a Braun that was about 5 yrs old. BAD move !!  This model MUST be fully charged prior to shaving. The unit simple does not have the power as my prior corded model, as I also shave my head after shaving my face. I purchased it about 4 weeks ago and the plastic parts that moves the blades in the head have broken off. They looked like the letter T. But now look like the letter | .  The top of the T is what moves the blades in the head.   This is my 6th Braun that I have purchased over my lifetime. The quality seems to have fallen through the floor while the price has gone through the clouds.    I would NOT recommend this product.</li>
    <li> The Braun Series 3 340 Men&#x27;s Shaver gives a decent shave.  I have never found any electric shaver to be as good as the old soap and razor routine but this is a lot more convenient.  I would give it 5 stars in terms of how long it holds its charge and how many shaves one can get on one charge. I would rate it highly and recommend it!</li>
    <li> During the time it was working, the Braun 340 shaver provided a close, quick shave and worked well with shaving cream.  Unfortunately, the shaver broke approximately a year and a half after I bought it.  The on-off switch stopped working, and the shaver would randomly shut-off during shaving, or even more annoying, would turn itself on at random times throughout the day and drain its battery life.  I will not be buying another Braun 340 as a replacement.</li>
    <li> I bought this one to replace the old Braun shave I had - it was more than 20yrs old, replacement parts are non-existent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m Asian and it shaves my thick stubby facial hair with ease. It doesn&#x27;t scrape skin off my face; if it did, it&#x27;s very minimal/unnoticeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Minimal bells and whistles - which I like. All I need were the green and red light indicators. I just need to know when the battery is low for recharging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> the braun series 3 340 shaver is a wonderful shaver thing. I had been using a regular razor for years and was looking for an alternative after numerous nicks and irritation. This hand-held battery operated device works wonders on my face. if you are looking for a good electric razor i would surely recommend this one.</li>
    <li> Do not buy the replacement cutter that Amazon shows. It is the wrong one, and won&#x27;t fit.&lt;br /&gt;Even on the Braun package, it shows a picture of this very model, but it doesn&#x27;t fit, it&#x27;s way too small.&lt;br /&gt;I spent 20 bucks for this information. Hope this helps somebody.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a gift for my husband for Christmas and I know he is going to like it.  Can&#x27;t wait for him to try it.</li>
    <li> This razor works better than described. I like that I have to charge it only once a week. The head is comfortable and not as expensive as my previous Braun razor. It shaves much better. Cleaning is a little bit more of a pain since the blades and foil are inseparable, but it&#x27;s not a big deal. It&#x27;s also very quiet. Definitely a plus. I don&#x27;t plan on using it wet, but it&#x27;s nice to know that water won&#x27;t hurt it.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not a bad shaver but I have had better - other Braun shavers.&lt;br /&gt;I like to shave every second or third day.  I use a Phillips rotary shaver ( wet and dry) which works brilliantly in quickly removing a two to three day growth everywhere except the sensitive areas of the neck.  There I use this Braun and it works ok.</li>
    <li> Works Great! Fast Shipping!</li>
    <li> I have used Remington shavers for many years but the screens and blades did not last very long.  The Braun  has so far exceeded my  expectations.  I like it better than the Remington.</li>
    <li> Braun shavers arent what they used to be.  This is my fifth Braun in about 18 years (most recent since about 5 years)and they just dont cut like they used to.  Sure my facial hair has changed some but this new foil screen that theyve been using for five years or so doesnt cut thick,tough beards all that well.  Even when used everyday for the morning shave there&#x27;s a lot of pulling, angling and stretching of my face to get all the hairs.  Also, Braun wants you to pay a couple of hundred dollars (or close to it) to get a better shaver with a hardened case.  Years ago the case was standard and the shave was closer, quicker and the battery lasted longer.  I thought I&#x27;d give them a try after a hiatus to see if maybe it was a production or mangement phase.......but I see it&#x27;s not.  I guess its back to Panasonic and Remington to see what works best for my mugg.  Since I wasnt asked I&#x27;ll provide an easy rating system from someone who has used e-shavers for about 22 years.  This Series 3, 340, from Braun, on a scale of 1 to 10 (1 terrible and 10 superior) rates at a 5 - mediocre in my opinion.  Thanks to Amazon for providng me with a somewhat decent price.</li>
    <li> I always liked Bruan and Remington shavers but this one has the best design yet.  The last shaver I had was a Remington and it was good but the push-button on/off switch gave out after only two years.  The on/off switch on this Bruan shaver feels like it&#x27;s more durable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the 3-head set-up, the design of the shaver and the push-up trimmer.  For all the shavers I&#x27;ve had, the trimmer is usually the first thing to fail so I hope this design is a good one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shave itself is great.  I didn&#x27;t have to use a blade for my neck later.  No irritation either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the charging system but I&#x27;m surprised the shaver doesn&#x27;t come with a carrying case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:  Less than two years after I bought it the on/off switch acted-up.  It either wouldn&#x27;t turn on, wouldn&#x27;t turn off or it would turn on by itself.  I brought it to a warranty dealer and there wasn&#x27;t a part available for it so Braun is sending me a new shaver.  Great customer service but I never suspected that switch would conk-out.</li>
    <li> I have had this shaver for a few years now and felt it was time for a review.  I agree with other posters that Braun shavers are not what they used to be.  This one does not cut as close as my previous Braun shaver, especially under the chin.  I have to go over the same area several times.  I do change the head unit and cutting blades yearly and initially thought it was the cutting head.  After two replacement units, the shaver still cuts the same way.  Just recently the trimmer decided to fall apart - literally.  Not what I expected from Braun.  I am now going to order a Panasonic - hopefully they are better.</li>
    <li> I was very disappointed in this product, it did&#x27;t shave very well.  I&#x27;ll never buy another one.</li>
    <li> This shaver is very nicely made and everything works without problems, but the shave is not as good as I have been used to with other brands of shavers.  They say to give it 3 weeks for a person&#x27;s beard to adapt to the shaver and I have yet to reach that point, but it seems to take a lot of pressure and slow movement to get a close shave.  It is also large to handle and clumsy to use on the upper lip area.  Pretty good overall, but the ease of use leaves something to be desired.</li>
    <li> Shave so well I rarely need the long hair trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;So easy to clean under faucet.  Don&#x27;t need the cleaing setup on more expensive models.</li>
    <li> Before buying this razor, the review cons were that it felt light and cheap, it was noisy and that it did not cut well. As to the first complaint, it feels light but that does not necessarily mean cheap. I like not dragging a brick around my face in the morning. Light is good. Noise? It is an electric motor... near your ear. It is not overly loud and it is certainly quieter than the 15 year-old Remington I am finally giving up. As for the shaving: few of us have a perfect beard. Hairs grow in different directions, some grow flat against the skin. This razor does a fine job with little extra effort needed to catch the odd-hair-out. No skin burn afterwards, but I use a non-alcohol based balm in any case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good razor. Enjoy it.</li>
    <li> In 7 months I have ordered new 32B Foil Cutters and can not get a good shave.  This razor does not do it for me, even though I have had a braun for  years.  The others were greatg--this is a horrible razor and the cutters are not good at all.    As a result of using this razor I have developed ingrown hairs which I did not have before.      Oh yes the trimmer is useless.    Bob Walton  Lakeland, FL</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been a loyal Braun customer for at least 30 years, going thru a number of different models. All have worked well and been good value - till this one. The worst!   Seems comparable in price to past models, but very underpowered and made of inferior material. Part of the problem may be that it works only on battery (charged), not with the wire plugged in, which could give it more power. Starting out each morning annoyed and feeling ripped off. This one&#x27;s going in the trash and I&#x27;m already searching for other brands. I also note that this one is made in China. Seemed like the older ones were made in Germany. If you&#x27;re shopping, I&#x27;d encourage you to check the higher end Braun models or other brands. Save your money on the 340!</li>
    <li> I recently got this shaver and am extremely pleased with it.  I am a lifelong user of electric shavers and have to say that this one is exceptional.  I&#x27;m replacing an older Braun shaver and this one has some excellent upgrades, I&#x27;m not sure what changes they made but this one easily deals with those trouble areas that are normally hard to shave, and its much quieter than my previous model.  I am very pleased with this new one!</li>
    <li> it is okay but it take longer to shave and heavy to. i like my other braun  series 1000 even it is old it stillwork.</li>
    <li> DISCLAIMER: I know nothing about shaving or electric shavers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having said this, this Braun exceeded my expectations...my expectations being to get a reasonably close shave without leaving my face raw and irritated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Never paid much attention to shaving. Oh I&#x27;ve shaved my entire adult life, but I never saw any reason to invest in anything other than a bag of cheap single blade disposable razors and a can of shaving cream. Starting dating again following the death of my wife (cancer) so a close shave has just recently become a major priority.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Abandoned the disposable razors for a straight razor and discovered what a really close shave was. Would have settled for that but for the fact I didn&#x27;t like scraping a layer of flesh off in my daily quest for a close shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Began reading up on electric shavers. Decided the Braun Series 7 was what I wanted, but the Braun Series 3 fit my budget. I also wanted the option of shaving wet so I could use it with Creamo Creme, which creates a thin lubricant for the face while shaving to minimize irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I use the Braun with the Creamo and get a shave that&#x27;s almost as close as the straight razor I previously used. To be honest, the Braun shaves so close that I should be satisfied considering the results I used to receive from disposables. So in my effort to match the closeness of my razor, I follow up my Braun shave with a disposable. Instead of wiping my face clean, I use the disposable to clean off the excess shaving solution...along with the fine hairs the Braun doesn&#x27;t cut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve read the arguments concerning electric razors not shaving close enough. In my case I guess that&#x27;s true. But I don&#x27;t see that as a negative. This Braun effectively minimizes the need for me to drag a razor blade across my face. By the time I&#x27;m done each morning my face is straight razor smooth without irritation, nicks or scrapes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I couldn&#x27;t be more satisfied.</li>
    <li> I am in my 50&#x27;s and have used Braun shavers for many years.  I purchased my 340 about 6 months ago and what a lousy shaver.  This gives the worse shave of any electric I&#x27;ve ever owned.  I have to go over areas time and time again in an attempt to get a decent shave.  Looks I may have to go to another shaver and it won&#x27;t be Braun.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned several Braun shavers over the decades and they have all done well.  This Braun-340 shaves close with no irritation.  It has good ergonomics, and is easy to clean.  It will work for about a week between charges, so I don&#x27;t need to carry the charger on trips.  Unknown is how long the battery will last but my other Braun batteries have lasted several years so I would expect the same here.  My conclusion... I would buy this razor again, in fact, I bought another for my Dad.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Braun Series 3 340s daily for two weeks and don&#x27;t have any complaints. It feels solid in my hand, is easy to operate, and seems to hold a charge well. I&#x27;ve only charged it once in two weeks and it recharged in about 5 minutes. I would say I have slow growing, medium coarse whiskers and not too thick of coat. This razor has done a great job of giving me a clean shave with zero pulling of my skin or beard hair (did I mention I have a full beard?) which was a problem with a previous circular-bladed electric razor. The blade head assembly is easy to remove and cleans out with just a couple of gentle taps on the sink. That all said, I would admit that I&#x27;m not a razor aficionado so my experience is limited. Overall I&#x27;m happy with my purchase and have no reason to believe it won&#x27;t hold up to my fairly regular usage.</li>
    <li> I have used Braun shavers for years.  In January, 2011 I bought a Series 3 340 shaver and luckily still had my old Syncro model. The  340 does not shave close at all and it takes a good while to get as good a shave as I can.  I will throw it away and hope my old ond lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> Not having had a Braun shaver before, I thought to try it out.  Shaves ok, but sounds like a combine thresher in the wheat fields. For awhile I thought I might dunk it in a can of motor \\&quot;awl\\&quot;.  (West Texas talk) I plan to use it when I let my face go unshaven for a few days. (Which I do too often) It does not shave as close as my Norelco, but does well on longer hairs.    The Texan</li>
    <li> the shaver works as advertised, i like the wet option as it does not cause a lot&lt;br /&gt;of skin irritation afterwards....</li>
    <li> I Always wanted an electric shaver, but i  was always skeptical about how well they shave. I did ALOT of research, and found the braun 340 wet and dry. i saw alot of controversy about this shaver. some say it doesn&#x27;t cut well, others say it cuts great. What made me really want an electric shaver was the convenience. i recently took a trip up to salt lake city (im from boston, Ma) to visit family i haven&#x27;t seen a long time. and i forgot my cartridge razors. so during my 2 week stay i decided to look into electric shavers while i was there. i was about to get the most expensive norelco best buy had, i figured you get what you pay for. but i decided against it, because my cousin has the same model and he says he doesn&#x27;t get a close shave at all. so i went the whole trip without shaving (and my beard grows thick and FAST). when i came back i knew i wanted a braun foil razor. i watched/read a bunch of reviews and wanted an inexpensive one to begin with. so i pulled the trigger on the 340 wet &amp; dry. this is my first electric shaver and i must say... it is AWESOME! i had a pretty thick beard when i received it, and the 340 cut it straight down. to be very clear, i am very anal about my shaving process. i always shave against the grain towards the end of my shave, with cartridge razors, to ensure a very smooth face. with this electric shaver i do not need to do that. the foil cutter does almost all the work for me. and it feels great on my face. i don&#x27;t feel any pulling or tugging, or shaving for that matter. it floats on my face and cuts all the hairs, and cuts my shaving time down to a fraction.  this shaver is great, i suggest this to anyone who&#x27;s looking for a good, comfortable, clean shave.</li>
    <li> I have used Remington, Norelco and Braun shavers as well as a blade to shave. Braun in my opinion is the best. Electric razors don&#x27;t shave as close as a blade, so keep that in mind. My skin is sensitive so a blade really irritates my skin. But an electric razor can irritate to if you do not use a little common sense. If you run the razor to fast over your face it will pull hairs and not cut cleanly and irritate your shin and cause ingrown hairs. Just like mowing a lawn. The grass gets long and thick you have to take it slow or the mower does not cut all the grass cleanly. Common Sense!     At 58 my beard has course gray hairs now and is more difficult to cut. Takes me 5 to 7 minutes to shave. Move the razor slowly and it cuts fine with no irritation. And it takes less time in the long run and less passes over your face. The 340 does a good job. Cleaning is easy. Lightly tap the foil head on the sink to get excess hair out. Rinse with warm water. Then attach it to the razor turn it on and run it under the water. If you want to do a better cleaning, get some soft soap and spread some on the foils and run the razor then rinse with warm water. Tap out the excess water and let dry. Then add a little oil to the foil and run for a few seconds and your done.   Braun&#x27;s foils and cutter blades hold up much better than the Remington razors I have owned. If I could get 4 months with Remington before the foil shredded and cut my face I was lucky. Never had the Braun foil fail in 12 to 18 months of use. I try and replace the foil and cutter once a year for optimum performance. You may want to go longer than that depending on your beard. Braun if I remember right recommends replacing it at 18 months.  So all in all the Braun 340 is an excellent little razor. I have owned it for 2 years.</li>
    <li> seems p&amp;g bought Braun. miss the shave i used to get w/the old style Braun</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried other products, but for sensitive (or cry baby people like me), nothing performs better then Braun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TIP: When using electric razors, try lubing the blades with oil (ie. Wahl Electric Trimmer Oil) more often.  Preferably, I have been lubing my blades after each use and tap-cleaning.  I tend to avoid using water, although this model handles water cleaning very well.  Not oiling the blades often, I find they tend to heat-up.  Keeping them well oiled seems to keep the blades much cooler, rather then only oiling them after each water cleaning per manufacturer instructions.</li>
    <li> I had a Norelco before and this is so much better.</li>
    <li> I have been using Braun electric shavers for a long time and found the product to be superior to previous Braun shavers.  They have made great strides in improving the shaving experience.</li>
    <li> Received product on time without delay.  Shaver comes in a package as previously described, no surprises.  Excellent product and customer service.</li>
    <li> this Braun shaver is priced right and works great. it gives a close and comfortable shave , wet or dry. it is designed to fit comfortably in your hand.  J.Barbaro, N.Y.</li>
    <li> I and my family have used Braun electric shavers for the past 9 years.  Up until now I felt that their shavers were one of the best.  I replaced an old Braun shaver with this one (Braun Series 3 340 Men&#x27;s Shaver) in May of 2011 and paid a premium price for it.  The first thing I noticed is that it didn&#x27;t have the same cutting power as the older one.  Plus the design wasn&#x27;t as solid. After six months of use, a part inside shook loose and now it buzzes loudly and the whole unit shakes in my hand.  So having called Braun about the warranty their &#x27;outsourced&#x27; customer service asked a lot of questions to see if the product had been misused in any way and then said I must ship it to their local repair affiliate at my expense.  From this they will determine whether or not to repair or replace it.  BTW - hang on to your receipts or you will not have a warranty.    We sent it in and are waiting for their response.  In the meantime, since I have no idea when I&#x27;ll have a working razor again (as they offered no turn-around time), I purchased a highly rated &#x27;Panasonic ES 8103 S&#x27; which so far has been excellent.  So much better quality and engineering than the Braun.  Clean and mostly one pass shaving, easy to clean and maintain.  A lot of thought when into the design of the Panasonic shaver.  Check it out: [[ASIN:B001DNE3KQ Panasonic ES8103S Pro-Curve Wet/Dry Rechargeable Linear Pivot Action Shaving System, Silver]]</li>
    <li> Although for the money, not sure what expected.  The razor had very little power compared to my Braun Series 7 (bought this one as a spare travel backup).</li>
    <li> I have owned this for 2 years. Never a problem</li>
    <li> Candidly the razor has never given me a close shave. It said in the instructions your skin has to adapt to an electric razor which requires frequent and continious use.  I am retired and do not shave everyday and when I used it my whiskers were lond , not so stiff and somewhat curley. This may indicate it was just no suited for my application rather than any failing of the razor.</li>
    <li> I have been using my old shaver for almost 4 years and it finally broke. I like to grow big beard. So when i bought this shaver i was a little worried whether it will be up to the task. But man it was good. It gave one of the smoothest shaves. As smooth as if it was done with a razor. Totally worth the cost. And i guess if maintained properly it will last long as well.</li>
    <li> Well made.  Long lasting battery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Battery charging stand does not last long;  it is cheap plastic and apparently cannot stand up to water.  In a 3 year period,  two charger stands have malfunctioned;  ,  but shaver can be charged by plugging directly into the shaver.  Also, even though  the chargiing  stand  shorts out quickly, it  can still  be used as the stand  that holds the shaver when not in use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like most electric shavers,  it does not shave  the neck  very well,  but  that is not  unique to this particular  razor.</li>
    <li> I purchased the Braun 340 Series 3 razor from Amazon about 9 months ago. I also have a Panasonic ES8077. The Braun 340 Series 3 offers a confortable facial hair cut but lacks easy cutting of neck hair. You can not use the razor when being recharged or the cord is connected to the shaver. The charging stand is very cheaply made and is difficult to insert the razor for storing or charging. I threw the charger stand away and just lay the shaver on a flat surface for storing/charging. When compared to my Panason ES8077, the Panasonic has more power, cuts facial hair and neck hair better, and has better storage base. All in all, the Braun 340 Series 3 is just okay in  my opinion.</li>
    <li> This was my first Braun shaver and my previous Norelco was a 3 head rotary type that I used for at least 20 years and went through a couple of replacement heads and replaced the rechargeable batteries as well. It shaved close and didn&#x27;t pull, but finally just got too old. This Braun has been a disappointment from the beginning and I have had it about 3 years now. It skips over whiskers, especially on the neck area and won&#x27;t cut anything that has grown out to a couple of days length. It often pulls when encountering longer hairs that it had previously failed to cut and is difficult to shave near my goatee and mustache. I just replaced the foil shaving head this week hoping it would improve the performance but have been very disappointed that I can feel no improvement over the discarded three year old cutters. I have taken to shaving with a razor in the shower getting the whiskers the Braun misses and using the Braun just for touch-up. As this was my first foil cutter type I can&#x27;t comment on whether the problem&#x27;s the same for other foil type cutters or just poor engineering on the part of Braun. I would certainly not recommend the Braun to anyone.</li>
    <li> I will give a review after I use it for a while</li>
    <li> Great price and works just right for me!</li>
    <li> I love it! I don&#x27;t write many reviews but I shave my head daily for work and this affordable razor shaves as close as my pro fusion was shaving. It&#x27;s a smooth cut with no pull and you can&#x27;t beat it for the price. Only thing is it takes several passes on neck hair. I bought this for my head so it does a excellent job! 5 star</li>
    <li> I bought this shaver about six month ago ... It has been working well and it didn&#x27;t have any problem. I guess it was a good deal!</li>
