      <li>I love this.</li>
      <li>I use them both together and love them</li>

      <li>I will update later..on more results..</li>
      <li>This works great, it&#x27;s well made, and very sturdy.</li>
      <li>&amp; Make sure you feel the jaw/neck muscles tensing as your using it.</li>
      <li>Who wouldn&#x27;t pay $5 to have a thinner chin? :)</li>
      <li>its not as comfortable as I would have liked but that may feel better over time.</li>
      <li>Love that it has</li>
      <li>but it doesn&#x27;t work and cause more neck pain.</li>
      <li>I wanted to try this to help with my love life.  </li>
      <li>In more than one way.  </li>
      <li>Took a long time to arrive but it works beautifully!!</li>
      <li>This product is worth every penny!!</li>
      <li>This idea is so easy and better than surgery.</li>
      <li>Easy to use.</li>
      <li>I can see it breaking easily if you are not careful.&lt;br /&gt;Still</li>
      <li>Easy to use but didn&#x27;t see results</li>
      <li>The easy was just too easy.</li>
      <li>Easy to use.</li>
      <li>But I strongly believe over time, it will help tone your neckline.</li>
      <li>pretty nice, just have to use it</li>
      <li>Fine.  </li>
      <li>My wife uses just one spring and that works fine for her.</li>
      <li>So far the neckline slimmer is easy to use and has a lot of resistance that&#x27;s good for toning.</li>
      <li>but I was not in a huge rush to start working out my neck anyways.</li>
      <li>you have to actually use it to see results lol.</li>
      <li>The sagging cheeks lifted, filled out</li>
      <li>Works great only use it 3 times a week</li>
      <li>I started as recommended with the lightest resistance, and exercise quite slowly, merely a few repetitions, keeping my jaw in perfect alignment, and comfort.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>It was extremely cheap and does what it advertises.</li>
      <li>This is a great item and it goes along great with my Facial Flex Facial Exercise System.</li>
      <li>It also is light on the resistance side, but you can put two springs in at a time if you pay attention to what you are doing.</li>
      <li>cheap, cheap product.</li>
      <li>Funky and cheaply made</li>
      <li>I was comfortable with the purple level spring immediately.</li>
      <li>and I had significant definition of my jawline.</li>
      <li>She hasn&#x27;t learned yet that pretty much all beauty products are too good to be true.</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t advertise this product as original, as that&#x27;s not what you&#x27;re getting.</li>
      <li>i didnt expect much for the price so its ok</li>
      <li>This will increase the resistance to a more reasonable level for a man.</li>
      <li>certainly good enough for this price</li>
      <li>Cool concept</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve returned it for a full refund.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used it much. I had the hardest time with changing the springs.</li>
    <li> I just received this item and I am having a major problem in opening it to put the springs in, I am trying my best to follow the instructions but I still cannot open it. I am anxious to try it out.</li>
    <li> Took a long time to arrive but it works beautifully!! I use it because I was starting to see looseness and it tightened things up nicely. I had one before and lost it so I knew it worked before ordering.</li>
    <li> Not sure if this actually works but it was the best white elephant gift in out traditional gift exchange!! ;)</li>
    <li> Cheaply made and was in pieces the first time I tried to use it.  Not even worth the time to try and send it back after waiting 3-4 weeks to get it in the first place.</li>
    <li> First off the directions are in Chinese. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s complicated to put together but I hope I did it right. It doesn&#x27;t seem like a complicated concept but who knows.</li>
    <li> This really works but you need to be consistent to see results. Very easy to use and does not take up a lot of time to perform.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t had it long enough to see much change (about two weeks), but it IS indeed extremely easy to use, and I do feel the effects of the movements under my chin between my jawbones. I&#x27;m hoping it&#x27;ll come through for me!</li>
    <li> So far the neckline slimmer is easy to use and has a lot of resistance that&#x27;s good for toning. I just got the system and have not had a chance to use it religiously yet, but so far I do like what I think I&#x27;m starting to see. It&#x27;s a great price too.</li>
    <li> Quick delivery and I love it too!</li>
    <li> It works if you do it every day!</li>
    <li> I never got around to using it.  I purchased the facial flex ultra and used it for awhile.  it seemed to re-align my jaw so that my teeth didn&#x27;t connect properly, which was very uncomfortable.  When i looked at the Before and After photos on the Neckline Slimmer &amp; Toning System, the After photo showed the model&#x27;s jaw jutting out, just as with the Facial-Flex.  I already know what that feels like and don&#x27;t plan on using it.</li>
    <li> i didnt expect much for the price so its ok</li>
    <li> it hurt my chin and made it really sore :(</li>
    <li> Got mine two weeks earlier than the arrival date said and I&#x27;m excited to see if this works for my double chin haha.</li>
    <li> Came about when it said it would (~4 weeks) from China, was in soft envelope-type package and broken. I&#x27;d file a complaint but it was only $4 and I don&#x27;t care to waste any more time with this business/person. Item was a piece of junk though, and clearly not in its original packaging. I don&#x27;t know if it was a knock-off or what, but it is entirely useless and currently now in my trash can (well, by now, its probably at the dump).</li>
    <li> Does not even open to allow user to insert springs!!  Best to use as brain teaser, rather than neckline slimmer!!</li>
    <li> I am 34 years old and people say I look like I&#x27;m in my early 20&#x27;s. Regardless, I have an obsession with anti-aging products. I have heard how your neck ages faster than your face. I liked how low priced this item was, so I thought I would give it a try. Big mistake but it&#x27;s my own fault.  I have problems with anxiety and hold all my stress in my neck. The back of my neck almost always hurts. I tried this product and OUCH. Don&#x27;t try this if you have neck pain. But I would assume that it would work well otherwise.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t actually do anything</li>
    <li> While I am sitting at my computer, I do the exercises that were recommended to me, and I hope that they will firm up my neck and chin.</li>
    <li> I liked the product but when i opened my package the product was broken. Good thing it wasnt that damaged that i could glue it together.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t seen an improvement yet, but forget to use it everyday....</li>
    <li> I guess it&#x27;s working. Just takes a LONG time! Easy to use. I like that it comes with 3 different springs. I started on medium. The easy was just too easy. I didn&#x27;t feel it. Withing 3 days, bumped up to hard. I don&#x27;t feel much, but after a month, I think I may see a slight difference. It&#x27;s not a miracle worker, like I had hoped. lol. I was hoping in a month, my double would be a single.</li>
    <li> My neck is noticeably firmer.</li>
    <li> Does not work like I though it would.</li>
    <li> This does help. Not really quickly, but after a month (I started out doing 10 a day, but have graduated to 100 a day), I&#x27;ve started seeing an improvement in my neckline. If you have patience it will help.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve seen some bad reviews on this item. I still bought ite because it was cheap and if it didn&#x27;t work, it wouldn&#x27;t be a total loss for me. I have been doing facial exercises that I&#x27;ve seen on YouTube etc. and I &#x27;ve noticed slight changes in my face. It took time so I know this&#x27;ll be the same. I just received it 3 ago, I plan on using it everyday. I think maybe twice daily.</li>
    <li> Product as described but it doesn&#x27;t work and cause more neck pain.</li>
    <li> I wanted to try this to help with my love life.  Not only has it made my face prettier but it made doing some jobs easier. You know how guys are &amp;#34;Diamonds, that will shut them up&amp;#34;?  Use this for about two weeks and that will get your man to be speechless.  In more than one way.  Lolz.  Not only that but you&#x27;ll love the way your face looks.  Don&#x27;t forget to moisturize.</li>
    <li> I see a slight improvement in my facial toning and hope to continue the improvement with continual proper use ....</li>
    <li> You can feel the muscle getting warm which means its working. It comes with instructions and workouts with frequency recomendation.  The pictures before and after are really impressive.</li>
    <li> Having trouble with opening the device to put in the springs! Looking online for further advice to open so not to brake it!</li>
    <li> It Works. Have moved up to 2nd level tension spring. If you have sensitive skin, try putting a small towel or lightweight pad between device and skin.  I am female, 61 years young.</li>
    <li> I love it. Some reviews are saying it does nothing for them but I use mine daily and already see and feel a difference. I use it while watching a 30minute T.V. show and even lose track of time and I use it for an hour before I realize it. Just put it under your chin and neck push down and it does the work for you. AMAZING !!!</li>
    <li> My neck has definitely slimmed down.</li>
    <li> you have to actually use it to see results lol. &amp; Make sure you feel the jaw/neck muscles tensing as your using it.</li>
    <li> This works right away.  I&#x27;m still stuck on the weakest spring and 1/2 my chicken neck is already gone. I&#x27;ve seen these units for $20 at US stores.  This is a good quality with comfortable rubber ends so you don&#x27;t feel the plastic as you squeeze your chin to your chest.  Note that if you don&#x27;t squeeze all the way down the back of your skull won&#x27;t hurt.</li>
    <li> I bought this, reluctant, but it wasn&#x27;t a big investment so I knew it wouldn&#x27;t be much lost if it didn&#x27;t work.  I didn&#x27;t even start using it right away. Then one day I picked it up &amp; told myself I WOULD do it every day, even if it was only for 15-20 rep&#x27;s.  I swear I could see a difference in about 4 days!!!  It was enough of a reinforcer to make me WANT to do it everyday now!  I started out with the middle spring.  After I started to see a difference, I decided I could do the firmest spring.  I actually have a defined jaw line again!!</li>
    <li> Great speed, super eBay seller!! thanks</li>
    <li> Product came quickly and on time but when I looked at where the coils should be inserted it was rusty. Considering this touches your neck/face I was a bit reluctant to use it. Product might work - but considering it was rusty I just threw it away.</li>
    <li> This thing is no better than you moving your head up and down without it..it even gave me an ache trying to do it. You have to hold it in place and it is squeaky with the spring in it. A waste.</li>
    <li> I love this little machine! It came in a nice little storage bag and three springs for different strengths. I started with the lowest spring and it was pretty easy. I felt a little funny doing it but when I moved up to the second spring I could really feel it working my neck and jaw muscles. I have just started using it (day 2) but really think that it is going to make a difference in my neck line. Soon I will try the hardest spring and see if I can get results faster.</li>
    <li> This product works very well in slimming  under the chin and tightening the neck area if used twice a day as directed.&lt;br /&gt;After reaching desired effect, once a day maintenance works well.</li>
    <li> stupid. doesn&#x27;t even work</li>
    <li> Would never order again. It took almost 2 months to get it. by the time I got it I had forgotten I ordered it. Also was broken. The top piece was broken and smelled like it sat in somebody&#x27;s moldy basement for YEARS!!! It came in a dirty looking makeup bag that was very dirty. Brought product from another seller who shipped pronto. Results are good but buyers beware... YOU GET WHAT U PAY FOR</li>
    <li> It took a while to arrive but it is a fun little exercise machine. It&#x27;s only a couple of bucks so why not try it!?! I need to be more constant with my exercises but seems sturdy and that can work</li>
    <li> Getting jowls in the 40s really sucks!  This handy, lightweight, spring-loaded tool is effective.  When I look down in the mirror, my neck is definitely slimmer!  Not exactly a miracle, but, then, I am not fanatical about using it.  Usually I do three sets of 12 (holding each for a few seconds) in the morning, in the car on the way to work, and before bed time.  Buy two of these!  I have one by my bed and one in my car. Great way to pass time in traffic or to do while watching a movie in bed.</li>
    <li> Works really well. I haven&#x27;t had a problem with it what-so-ever and I have used it several times. I haven&#x27;t seen major results with toning, but that will take time no matter what product a person uses.</li>
    <li> After three sessions I could actually feel my muscles tightening in my neck And my jowls.&lt;br /&gt;Who ever imagined, that we need to exercise those areas of our body, as we age!!</li>
    <li> This is a great product! I think it works great. excited to see results in the future based on reviews.</li>
    <li> No directions that made any sense.  Broke the second time I used it.  Actually, it looked used when I received it, and it wasn&#x27;t supposed to be. I&#x27;d give no stars if I could.</li>
    <li> Has been helping since starting it, tones the neck and jaw muscles.</li>
    <li> certainly good enough for this price and it has enough resistance to allow you to feel you are getting a little workout in the area it targets. its not as comfortable as I would have liked but that may feel better over time. I do a facial workout everyday, a sort of facial yoga routine that I have done for about 3 years and this is a nice addition.</li>
    <li> Broke in the first 2 min ... plastic broke getting spring in ...</li>
    <li> I received it broken, awaiting a new one..</li>
    <li> This is a great item and it goes along great with my Facial Flex Facial Exercise System. I use them both together and love them</li>
    <li> This idea is so easy and better than surgery. They also respond back to your email so quickly! Will definitely do business with Lucky again!</li>
    <li> Had it for a while now and don&#x27;t see no change  at all do I diet as well why doing. Excersise</li>
    <li> I needed this. Worked with dedication and some weight loss supplements.</li>
    <li> This product was very reasonable in price, compared to the one&#x27;s advertised on T.V. same product, waaaay less $$$. I found out however, there are some great FREE exercises on youtube ....have a look. For those of us on limited income, free is always better, no?  Sorry that I may be taking business away from the Neckline slimmer folks.</li>
    <li> It WORKS!!! I took before and after photos of myself over a 4 week period and the results are amazing!! The sagging cheeks lifted, filled out and I had significant definition of my jawline. I use it a few times a week just for maintenance. Use as directed...for the price who&#x27;d had thought something so cheap could so much.</li>
    <li> This product Is great! ... enough said.</li>
    <li> So people spend money for this.  You put the base against your chest, and you push down on the head.  The springs create resistance, giving a thinner, firmer neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can get the SAME results or MORE by putting the palm of your hand under your chin and pushing down against your palm.</li>
    <li> I waited a long time for this item because it ships from hong kong. Just got it yesterday and the parts are stuck together so I can&#x27;t even put the coils in. You get what you paid for.</li>
    <li> This thing looks so crazy, but works so well! I had my doubts when I bought it, but I am glad that I did. I have rapidly lost 70 lbs and it tightened my skin on my neck and face in no time.</li>
    <li> I bought this product over 7 years ago, and I cannot believe you people are getting it for only $4.00. That is insane. This is the type of product that you don&#x27;t see the results until later in life, but I assure you if you don&#x27;t buy this product, and you don&#x27;t exercise that neck now you will regret what you did to yourself. I paid $29.99 back then for this product, and I would do it again. I am 43 years old and there is not one single sign of aging on my neck. I only use this product for 3 minutes a day if that. This product also helped me to keep my face young...I am not saying that it does the face part alone because it can&#x27;t; you need the cheek exerciser as well, but for sure my neck is perfect. People think I am 26 years old. Who ever made this product, and selling it for $4.00 is an idiot.</li>
    <li> Still waiting, I do the exercises daily so waiting to see results</li>
    <li> Wife uses it. Don&#x27;t know if it helps or not. I wouldn&#x27;t have the patience for it and find the noise it makes irritating.</li>
    <li> It was extremely cheap and does what it advertises. I think the quality is sturdy for the $3.99. If you are into how you look make the nominal investment. I was pleasantly surprised by the results.</li>
    <li> I can feel it working I need to increase the time to use it.</li>
    <li> Do not waste your money.  You&#x27;ll get better results to just do some regular facial and neck exercises.  Just google &amp;#34;neck exercises&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;get rid of a double chin&amp;#34; and you&#x27;ll find all sorts.  I bought this and after I finally got it, found it wasn&#x27;t worth the wait.</li>
    <li> great product and great service</li>
    <li> Works great only use it 3 times a week</li>
    <li> Bought this as a replacement for one that was lost in a move to a new home.  Bottom line, yes, it does work.  It will tighten your neck and reduce jowls as well as marionette lines.  The catch? Well, there is no catch.  As with any exercise program it must be done daily.  I do it twice daily.  You may not see results if you are overweight.  This will not get rid of fat.  It builds muscle to keep your neck and jowls looking younger.</li>
    <li> Easy to use but didn&#x27;t see results</li>
    <li> The little device makes quite a difference!  I was surprised.  It smoothes out the neckline quite a bit.  I would definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> I feel stupid for buying</li>
    <li> Did nothing for my neckline after using for two months...</li>
    <li> Using it everyday. i believe I&#x27;ll get the results I&#x27;m after. Thanks</li>
    <li> THIS STUFF IS THE MOST AWFUL THING THAT I&#x27;VE EVER BOUGHT. MY HUSBAND HAD GET HIS TOOLS TO GET TO OPEN THIS THING TO INSERT THE OTHER PIECE AND USE IT. AS FAR AS KNOW IF THIS WORKS? I&#x27;M NOT SURE YET THIS REVIEW IS JUST ABOUT HOW DIFFCULT THIS IS.</li>
    <li> It came in an envelop , no return label . Was unable to open the unit to put in springs. it was glued together. Suppost to be new, I believe it was used. I am not happy with it at all</li>
    <li> I can definitely feel my jaw toning as I use this Product. It took a little while to arrive (about a month) but I was not in a huge rush to start working out my neck anyways. 3 different springs and a little carrying case for it all. Cute strange product. Than you!</li>
    <li> The plastic broke very easily. Barely used it once.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not bad....I think you need to use it alot to get results.  I was worried it would be cheaply made, but it&#x27;s pretty sturdy.</li>
    <li> What can I say about this product it really works as expected and I recommend it, it is Awesome!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;Very good!!!</li>
    <li> This is a piece of junk. Can&#x27;t get it open to insert coils. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> THIS IS not for an old lady with neck problems.  I should have known better</li>
    <li> Did the job but never really used Because it hurt my neck.</li>
    <li> This is great, I use it everyday.</li>
    <li> product did not come as described in the instructions,the parts were different colors</li>
    <li> This is pointless... you can feel the cheapness. Get what you pay for I suppose...</li>
    <li> I actually ordered this years ago, when it first came out, but am terrible about using religiously, so it ended up in a drawer.  After finding out about a big event I would be attending, I decided to try this again.  I have now been using it for 8 weeks, once a day and am shocked by the results.  My double chin is now gone and I can actually feel the tightening of the muscles.  Could not be happier.  I could see results after about 3-4 weeks, so it does require a commitment, BUT if you stick with it, you will see the results and you will WANT to continue to use it.  I keep mine beside the commode and use it once a day, while I&#x27;m &amp;#34;doing other things&amp;#34;, lol.  Works for me!</li>
    <li> I think this really would work  but It made my jaws(TMJ) hurt so I had to quit. Now I just do facial/neck exercises without it. Its priced about right. Not totally cheap plastic but not a fancy contraption either.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t even come with all the parts  I am missing the springs which is really necessary for the item to work! Really angry</li>
    <li> Purchased as a gift. Recipient says it works really well &amp; he&#x27;s very happy with it.</li>
    <li> Not a great product...</li>
    <li> pretty nice, just have to use it ALLOT to make a difference..</li>
    <li> so retared! does nothing but make you dizzy!!!!!</li>
    <li> Easy to use. Early but beginning to see results.</li>
    <li> Was a gag gift, I don&#x27;t know if it actually works, but it&#x27;s easy to use... You can watch tv while you do it? ;)&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s made of plastic, so I can see it breaking easily if you are not careful.&lt;br /&gt;Still waiting on my friends results!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok but not great.</li>
    <li> If you able to use it 24/7 maybe your chin will disappear if you also will loose all extra pounds but without it, forget it!!! Nothing miracle will happen to the double or three chins</li>
    <li> It functions as stated. I don&#x27;t know if it would produce the claimed result yet.I have only been using it for a couple weeks.</li>
    <li> I ordered two of these, one for me and one as a gift, even though I was a little skeptical about the price. The ones I had seen in stores were $20, and not only were these a quarter of that price, but they were also over $2 less than the next-cheapest listing for the exact same product here on Amazon. I decided that for five bucks apiece I was willing to take the risk of receiving a cheaper and less-effective knockoff, if such a things exists for this product, and now I&#x27;m SO glad I went for the cheaper seller! I was pleasantly surprised to find that my neckline slimmers arrived in factory packaging with everything exactly as described in each box: PY brand device, three springs, and a small, dark green zippered storage bag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t yet vouch for the results, as I&#x27;ve only been using mine a day, but I could feel it working as I used it, so I have no reason to doubt it will do what it&#x27;s supposed to do. I will change my rating later if it doesn&#x27;t. Mainly I just wanted to go ahead and get my review out there for other skeptical shoppers since this seller (shop &amp; save) has received so few reviews. Bottom line: If you&#x27;re going to buy a Neckline Slimmer, this is the seller you need to get it from! Quick shipping and a much lower price than the others. Who wouldn&#x27;t pay $5 to have a thinner chin? :)</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t spot reduce fat, my bad for buying this</li>
    <li> Does anyone know how to install the springs in this thing?</li>
    <li> For nick massage I got some feeling good. But can not see result on my nick.</li>
    <li> It looks so old. I don&#x27;t like it.</li>
    <li> Product is as described. Arrived on time. Great!</li>
    <li> does not work. this thing does not give you a workout nor does it tone</li>
    <li> Inexpensive and very effective - I&#x27;ve been using it consistently with strongest spring and can feel the burn and see improvement.  I use it lying down before I sleep which I feel is better than sitting up as it seems to isolate the neck area better.</li>
    <li> Cool concept but it broke after 1 use and it took 4 weeks to get here</li>
    <li> For an inexpensive little tool, I can clearly see a difference in my neck.  It is much tighter and smoother now.  I do not use it for jaw shaping, as I have TMJ - so that would set off negative affects.  Anyway, for the price, was worth buying it.</li>
    <li> No good, no change with this apparatus.</li>
    <li> cheap, cheap product. Barely worth 10 cents.</li>
    <li> Bought on a whim. Broke after a week. Never got to see if it worked or not.</li>
    <li> Didnt work for me at all</li>
    <li> I like this a lot. The only problem, is that the top does not go down, and lock in, though I really don&#x27;t want to return it, as that is not that big of a deal. I had another one, that worked like it should, but was lost in my move. You can really feel the muscles used in the movements, and I believe this unit  really works, if it is used consistently.</li>
    <li> This little device is doing just what it says. It may look simple, but it really works</li>
    <li> The Neckline Slimmer arrived without the springs that go with it. Please forward the springs to me at 137 Spinnaker Walk, Savannah GA 31410. It is really useless without the springs.</li>
    <li> Not too bad. Not magical but you have to work your way there. Take some times to notice the result.</li>
    <li> Received this quickly. I started using it the same day. I just had a total thyroidectomy 4 weeks before and wanted to strengthen my neck muscles. Well, this has not only done that, it has tightened up my neck skin and is lifting my lower jawline.  Amazing results for only 3 weeks of use. I am very glad I purchased this and will continue to use it!</li>
    <li> I have been using the Neckline Slimmer &amp; Toning System for a short time, but I do see a difference.  It&#x27;s an inexpensive product that works.  It arrived in a few days, even if it was promised in a few weeks.  I like it.</li>
    <li> I am finding I can exercise those muscles of my throat, under my chin, around my ears even. I have confidence I will see results as I am keeping up with using the system. thanks!</li>
    <li> This works great, it&#x27;s well made, and very sturdy. I can see improvement in my neck after just a couple weeks. Also, it shipped really quickly considering that it was dispatched from Asia.</li>
    <li> I think I can see a slight difference but I need a little more time. The stretching of the jaw does feel good!</li>
    <li> It kind of pulls the skin down.</li>
    <li> I am impressed with this easy device&#x27;s purpose. I was comfortable with the purple level spring immediately. Like any muscle that is used repeatedly, there will be toning and firming. This is like crunches for the stomach muscles. Pressing down on the plunger of this device with the chin, toward the chest, works the muscles in the neck and jaw. This works just as well for my hand muscles to strengthen my grip when I hold the plunger against my finger tips to collapse the plunger in my fist, toward my thumb which is at the base of the device. I simply open and close my hand to exercise my grip. All very simple and clever, actually.</li>
    <li> Very dissatisfied. I thought i began seeing results until i started to develop TMJ (Temporomandibular joint dysfunction). A condition where your jaw locks up and becomes very uncomfortable. I believe the stress put on my jaw from this neckline slimmer lead to the development of TMJ. Definitely not work a slimmer neck at the cost of jaw locking.</li>
    <li> Yes I liked it and I bought it as a gift to my friend</li>
    <li> My daughter bought this against my advice. She hasn&#x27;t learned yet that pretty much all beauty products are too good to be true. Use your brain and don&#x27;t buy this waste of plastic.</li>
    <li> nice I am gonna try this and then see the results.</li>
    <li> You have to hold it in place. ...it would be nice to have a strap to go around your head to hold it. ...no one likes double chins in selfies</li>
    <li> YOU HAVE TO DO THIS EVERY DAY IF YOU WANT IT TO WORK !! I SAW THIS ON KARDASHIAN SHOW AND GOT IT FOR THE HELL OF IT</li>
    <li> I ordered this product,I was suppose to get it on the 15th..but received it two days Early..very happy about that. It came in the actual product box,Brand new. Like it had come from the actual company itself..I started to use it today,started on the lightest coil..but switched to the strongest..I can feel my neck muscles already worked after using it..I have great faith in this product..read so many good reviews before buying it..I will update later..on more results..</li>
    <li> As described, makes a squeaking noise when in use from the spring sliding across the inside.</li>
    <li> I FREAKING LOVE THIS PRODUCT!! seen a HUGE different in less than a WEEK! This product is worth every penny!!</li>
    <li> I was a little unsure if this product actually worked, but decided to give it a shot since it was so cheap. I&#x27;ve been using it for about a week and can definitely see a difference!</li>
    <li> Sometimes it would hurt my chest from pushing down. But it does the job. You just have. To use it everyday and can&#x27;t be lazy. I noticed after a week that my chin look more defined. Totally would recommend to anyone. My mom even wanted to use it after I was done because she wanted to try. Any age would be able to use this.</li>
    <li> The neckline is something that we tend to ignore and take for granted (until that small secondary chin starts to form). This is a product with different spring settings to test your strength to tone a bit your neckline. The results are definitely not miraculous/instant. But I strongly believe over time, it will help tone your neckline. It&#x27;s also about posture. Just do the exercise in the booklet and you&#x27;ll definitely feel something under your chin. I&#x27;m curious to see how it will work in the long run. Love that it has it&#x27;s own nice pouch for easy storage.</li>
    <li> This device works muscles that a weight lifting headband won&#x27;t. It also is light on the resistance side, but you can put two springs in at a time if you pay attention to what you are doing. This will increase the resistance to a more reasonable level for a man. My wife uses just one spring and that works fine for her. There are no quick fixes; you didn&#x27;t obtain the loss of muscle tone in a week or a month and you won&#x27;t correct the problem in a short time frame. This is still like any other workout routine; you must set a schedule and stick to it if you want too achieve any lasting results. You must also continue the routine after you achieve the results or you will regress to where you were. We have been using this device for a little over three weeks and can already see small improvements but we both realize it will take months of use to get the results we seek. I am a former bodybuilder and my wife is just a gorgeous woman who has had to do very little to maintain her looks. We are in our late 50s now and while we both still pass as early 40s we see signs of growing older and this little device is helping us regain the healthy looks to which we are accustomed. Plus we have converted a room of our house into a gym and are both back into body building, albeit at a much lighter level. So buy this gadget if you plan to use it diligently and you will eventually get the results you seek. If you aren&#x27;t willing to put in the time and effort necessary to achieve the results, save your money and do nothing.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t know much about these, but it seems to be a good workout!</li>
    <li> I have always wanted to get rid of my double chin so thought I&#x27;d give it a try. On receipt I thought how very cheap and plasticky the item was. It squeaks and grinds like mad when using it and is absolutely useless. I used it twice a day, as per instructions for 14 days and it gave me painful jaw ache. My dentist has advised me to stop using this IMMEDIATELY as the pressure can cause hinge/muscle problems within the jaw. I&#x27;ve returned it for a full refund. Utter, utter cheap RUBBISH.</li>
    <li> A little stiff, but works fine</li>
    <li> it really works once you maintain your daily excuse...</li>
    <li> Broke after first use :(</li>
    <li> I can see how th&lt;br /&gt;is might have the potential to work, but it sticks when I lift my head up, kind of annoying. I received from china in a cloth bag with crumbled instructions. I feel like I got a used product as there was a pinkish smudge on the rubber end. Kind of turned me off. We will see if ths product works, if it does it will be worth it</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t get the slimmer to  operate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can someone tell me how to work it?</li>
    <li> I love this. Just like we exercise our other muscles this exercises the face muscles very well. Need to exercise face with this 3+ days a week. I use it twice a day using the toughest tension spring 30-50 reps per exercise to get my results. It tones and tightens face muscles by this it lifts up sagging skin from the sagging muscles. Kind of like doing squats to lift your booty.</li>
    <li> Seems to be working just have to be disciplined</li>
    <li> Yes this product works the muscles and you have to actually take time to use it and it will work. Just like everything else in exercise you have to commit to do it. I could tell a difference in the short time I used it. I stopped due to I got sick and now I have to start all over again. Yes I recommend it.</li>
    <li> Product arrived on time, neatly packaged with a sturdy zip-up bag to protect the neckline slimmer and the extra coils. Thank you !&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My need for this purchase was a bit different that most reviewers. I am using this nifty device to help strengthen my  jaw. I started as recommended with the lightest resistance, and exercise quite slowly, merely a few repetitions, keeping my jaw in perfect alignment, and comfort.&lt;br /&gt;I like this smart little machine, and will toss it into luggage for travel. Thank you !</li>
    <li> Fine.  If it works and improves my neck and husband&#x27;s I will give it a 5!</li>
    <li> Awful product, it was damaged when it arrived and took forever to receive. very cheap plastic. When I try to use it the spring jams every time .Very unsatisfied and will not recommend to anyone.</li>
    <li> This is awesome! I&#x27;ve seen Khloe Kardashian used one of this and I decided to finally get one for myself! It comes with multiple springs to adjust the toning. ITS PERFECT!</li>
    <li> MY WIFE LOVES IT. IT MAKES A DIFFERENCE. THANKS.</li>
    <li> Received it today, took forever to get here. I can&#x27;t even open it to put the springs in. This product really sucks.</li>
    <li> Interesting and works fairly well.</li>
    <li> Funky and cheaply made but it does what the ad says. I think if I use it every day it will work in a few weeks. I have had mine only a few days.</li>
    <li> At this point do not see any results.</li>
    <li> I lost a lot of weight, but my face still looked very chubby. I even had a double chin!The quality is great, I&#x27;ve had mine for several months and I use the blue spring the most. The results are great, but it takes time to start noticing. I personally did it for 15 minutes a day and by two weeks I noticed results.</li>
    <li> This item was advertised as original, but it&#x27;s clearly a knockoff. Didn&#x27;t come with a box and even the color tabs for the springs don&#x27;t match. Don&#x27;t advertise this product as original, as that&#x27;s not what you&#x27;re getting. Otherwise seems to work ok.</li>
