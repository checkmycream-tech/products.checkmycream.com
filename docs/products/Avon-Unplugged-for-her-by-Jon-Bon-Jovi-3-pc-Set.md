    <li> This set smells absolutely beautiful. I bought the wash and lotion from my Avon rep because it was on sale. I looked in the new catalog for the cologne and didn&#x27;t see it so I&#x27;m on amazon and lo and behold it is on here! ! Can&#x27;t wait to get it! ! Thank you for having it. Thank you Bon Jovi for creating it.</li>
    <li> What more can I say!  The scent is gorgeous and delicious!  Love that I can layer the scent with shower gel, lotion and perfume</li>

    <li> I took a chance on this product and was very pleased.  Not a heavy sent, floral but not over powering.  Had to be good, just ordered another set.  Art work on the bottle of perfume beautiful, great deal of thought went into the mixture of scents.  Bon Jovi has another success.</li>
    <li> Cheaper than ordering from the catalog. Exact same product. Smells great. Lotion doesn&#x27;t smell quite as strong as the perfume but together all three layer together very well.</li>
    <li> I got a sample of this and I liked it so much I looked on amazon for it. The 3 piece set was a great price. I love the way the lotion and shower gel have a twist cap with a hole in the center. The cap doesn&#x27;t come off but rather opens the hole when you twist it. I think it is great!</li>
