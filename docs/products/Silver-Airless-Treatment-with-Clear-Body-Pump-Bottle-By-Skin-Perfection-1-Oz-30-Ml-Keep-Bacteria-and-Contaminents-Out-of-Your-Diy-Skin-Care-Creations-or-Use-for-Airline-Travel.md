      <li>and that is fantastic and very cost effective.  </li>
      <li>I also wrap it with aluminum foil to keep out light.  </li>
      <li>They&#x27;re so useful for many purposes.</li>
      <li>I wish the shipping was free.</li>
      <li>so I can make a tinted moisturizer for light coverage/winter days.</li>

      <li>It turns out I chose right!</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s still fresh as it was when i filled it up.</li>
      <li>Full review on my blog.</li>
      <li>) fill almost all of the way full.</li>
      <li>I got this bottle to keep my L&#x27;oreal True Match foundation in, and I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple of months now.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It pumped well, filled easily, and was a reasonable price.</li>
      <li>I purchased this to use for Vitamin C serum which I make myself, as it quickly deteriorates when exposed to air.  </li>
      <li>Both pumps are very consistent despite the difference between the two products I use them for.</li>
      <li>/&gt;The bottles are also reusable, you just clean with hot, soapy water and refill.</li>
      <li>This is a great little airless bottle.  </li>
      <li>Definitely worth the money</li>
      <li>Then I directly put the bottle over the opening of my pump bottle and tapped it against the top until all the product I could transfer was out.</li>
      <li>The seller is nice enough to print out instructions and include them with orders.</li>
      <li>These \\&quot;styes\\&quot; of airless pumps (different than the frosted kind) do not pump with nothing in them.</li>
      <li>Its also a very nice looking product (not cheap looking at</li>
      <li>Anyways, the shipping was EXCEPTIONAL FAST I purchased on a Monday and received on Wednesday of the SAME WEEK.</li>
      <li>we love how our make up will last longer and comes out clean each time.</li>
      <li>and first of all, i love how clean and simple it looks.</li>
      <li>, I went back and bought two more.</li>
      <li>How it works is as you pump, a bottom piece pushes the product up to reach the dispenser&#x27;s inlet instead of leaving air at the top like regular pump bottles.</li>
      <li>Will definitely be ordering more of these.</li>
      <li>Exactly what I was looking for.</li>
      <li>The company also sent an instruction page with my order that was helpful with filling them up for the first time.</li>
      <li>so I could have a sanitary and consistent way is dispensing my makeup.</li>

    <li> omg this bottle saved me from waisting a ton of revlon colorstay foundation.  i transfered my foundation into this bottle and its amazing that it has a pump.  will be purchasing more asap</li>
    <li> This pump is perfect for my Revlon Colorstay foundation. I originally ordered one and then liked it so much, I went back and bought two more. It&#x27;s a little tedious putting product into it, but worth the trouble because once it is in, it is a breeze to use!</li>
    <li> I ordered 3 of these bottles. They came safely packaged and were delivered an entire week sooner than expected! Arrived with a nice instructional guide on how to fill and use them. Already filled all three and am incredibly impressed with both the quality and functionality of them. Will most likely be buying more!</li>
    <li> I love that all my foundations that didn&#x27;t have a pump before  have a better one than the ones that do come with pumps!</li>
    <li> I was nervous to try something like this, wondering if it would be a total waste of time, money, and product. However, my favorite foundations don&#x27;t come with a pump and I was sick of banging glass foundation bottles on my wrist to get product onto my makeup sponge. After some searching, it looked like the answer was to transfer product into another container that had a pump. But with so many available, I still felt like I was taking chances. It turns out I chose right! I highly recommend this bottle, and because of that I&#x27;m taking time to answer some questions I had before buying:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;IS THIS GOOD QUALITY? This pump is great quality, but it is plastic (not glass). That being said, it&#x27;s still thick and will not break if you drop it onto tile. For the price that it is, I&#x27;m not complaining. The container is also pleasing to look at on my makeup shelf.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HOW DOES IT WORK? The seller is nice enough to print out instructions and include them with orders. Essentially, you unscrew the pump and dump your product in.Give it a few taps to release air bubbles and the container will push the product up to the top of the container. Simply screw the top back on and you&#x27;re now able to see exactly how much product is left, and pumping releases the perfect amount of product from the container. As you run out of product, the container pushes the remaining product to the top. This airless method is a much better system in comparison to devices using a &#x27;straw.&#x27;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HOW DO YOU TRANSFER PRODUCT? I wanted to transfer foundation. To do this, I left my foundation bottle upside-down over night to get as much product as possible to the top for transfer. Then I directly put the bottle over the opening of my pump bottle and tapped it against the top until all the product I could transfer was out. This method does not waste product, because you&#x27;re getting as much product out of the bottle as you would using it directly. A secondary option would be to use a funnel, but thiswill definitely waste a bit of product that will stay on the funnel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CAN I USE THIS FOR OIL? I would recommend this for lotions or foundations only. With the way this product is put together, it&#x27;s not spill-proof for thinner liquids like oils. For oils, I recommend any glass dropper bottle. I use them for my own oils and they don&#x27;t spill!</li>
    <li> I bought these bottles for mixing foundations since it&#x27;s hard to get a color match for me.  They are really nice quality glass bottles that look nice on my vanity and they work quite well.  I am able to put a cream foundation in and the pump works just fine, so a thicker formula lotion will work in these as well as a liquid.</li>
    <li> These are awesome for foundations that don&#x27;t have a pump.  Use it with the makeup spatula from TKBTrading.com. Full review on my blog. dizzynick[.]wordpress[.]com</li>
    <li> I make a wonderful facial serum and these bottles look so high-end without the high-end price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love these bottles.  They make my product look fabulous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Continued customer!!</li>
    <li> I bought this place my Revlon Color Stat foundation in. (Which, by the way, is AWESOME but it doesn&#x27;t come with a pump) :-(  Anyways, the shipping was EXCEPTIONAL FAST I purchased on a Monday and received on Wednesday of the SAME WEEK. I love that! The bottles are exactly the right size, holding 1 fluid ounce. The pump works just great and the bottle are  nice and seem to be very strong.  I can tell they won&#x27;t burst with one drop on the floor.  I&#x27;m DEFINITELY  buying another TWO of these bottles for other beauty products!</li>
    <li> These bottles are awesome to put liquid makeup in.  The pump works great.  I will be purchasing more in the future.</li>
    <li> I ordered a couple of these pumps for my foundation that was in a jar and the lid broke apart and would no longer close and another was in a pour out style bottle.  They work like a dream.  I like how I do not have to dip my finger in the foundation causing contamination. Also it dispenses the perfect amount of foundation and there is no wasting product.  I see other reviewers have washed and re-used the bottles and that is fantastic and very cost effective.  I probably will buy more in the future.</li>
    <li> This is great if you buy drugstore foundation!!!! I put all of my foundations into these now LOVE them!!!! Definitely worth the money</li>
    <li> I got this bottle to keep my L&#x27;oreal True Match foundation in, and I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple of months now. The lid and the bottom of the container have a nice silver coating, and the middle is more of a hard plastic material. As inexpensive as this bottle is, I don&#x27;t mind that it isn&#x27;t made of glass. In fact, I prefer it because I can be accident prone and if I drop this, it won&#x27;t shatter. Sometimes the top of the pump gets stuck down a little when I&#x27;m using it, but this is more of a heads up than a negative thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-Nice quality for the price.&lt;br /&gt;-The fact that this is an airless bottle is great. Once my foundation was inside, it took a few pumps to push all the air out and dispense the makeup, but I won&#x27;t have to go digging for my foundation once the bottle is low.&lt;br /&gt;-It does the job well. One pump (sometimes 1 1/2) of this is enough for my whole face, and I&#x27;m not left with a messy pump-less bottle. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I purchased two, one for my Revlon Colorstay and another for my Rimmel 25 hour and it worked well with both. I am going to order a third so I can make a tinted moisturizer for light coverage/winter days. I do wish this game with the plastic tube, you have to tip the bottle to use the pump.</li>
    <li> Very happy with this product. The instructions and tips they provided were very helpful and much appreciated. I also read a lot online about the proper way to fill it, and had no problems. It is a rather large bottle compared to how much it stores, but I like this over the pumps with the tube in the middle, so it&#x27;s worth it to me. Its also a very nice looking product (not cheap looking at all)&lt;br /&gt;Tips:&lt;br /&gt;1) fill almost all of the way full. You&#x27;ll need to make sure there aren&#x27;t air bubbles. So order the smaller of the sizes that you want to store. Screw the cap on tightly.&lt;br /&gt;2) If it doesn&#x27;t work, tip it upside down, tap on hard surface (to get the air bubbles to the bottom), and take a paperclip to push the bottom up through the hole as far as it can go.&lt;br /&gt;3) These \\&quot;styes\\&quot; of airless pumps (different than the frosted kind) do not pump with nothing in them. Once there is liquid, it will properly produce the suction needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It pumped well, filled easily, and was a reasonable price. Would recommend.</li>
    <li> I love this. I use it to dispense my foundation.  It&#x27;s a much more convenient way to get your foundation out if you&#x27;re using a brush for application, and there&#x27;s significantly less waste.</li>
    <li> So glad I found this item.  It really works and has been working as claimed, no leaks, high quality product to transfer my high end makeup that comes without a pump on</li>
    <li> Pro: perfect keeping air out and stays fresher longer, easy to use, easy to store, lastest longer, no mess, nice to travel with,never waste foundation always the right amount comes out.&lt;br /&gt;Con: cleaning it out, and depends on how liquidly/or/thick the foundation is for it to come out, takes a few pumps to get it to work,I suggest when you fill it and put the lid on and cap.. put it upside down for 15-30 mins then pump it. I wish the shipping was free. $4 is a good price but free shipping would be awesome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought 2 last year.. April 2013 and still have the make up and it&#x27;s still fresh as it was when i filled it up. today is February 2014. :P&lt;br /&gt;I would of bought it on ebay if i found cheaper.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> I love these bottles!! I am so glad I found them! They&#x27;re so useful for many purposes. I use them for my RevlonColorStayFoundation which comes with no pump. I am also happy when I take them with me for traveling! No mess anymore, airless bottles are the best!!!</li>
    <li> I purchased this to use for Vitamin C serum which I make myself, as it quickly deteriorates when exposed to air.  Makes me wonder why the expensive Vitamin C serums are still using bottles with droppers.  It is easy to use and works well.  They say you can re-use it but I haven&#x27;t gotten that far.  I also wrap it with aluminum foil to keep out light.  Small price to pay for what it does.</li>
    <li> I love these bottles! They look great on my dressing table, they are easy to fill and to use, they work perfectly, they are reusable and affordable and this seller ships lightening fast and combines shipping when you order multiple items in the same order. These bottles are so easy to fill and use. All you do is unscrew the top, pour in your foundation or what have you, screw the top back on, pull off the lid and pump a few times to prime until the product begins to flow. It usually takes just a few pumps and you are good to go. Easy-peasy. If you are struggling with open mouth bottles of foundation, face moisturizer, serum, oil, what have you... Get some of these bottles. You&#x27;ll love them.</li>
    <li> I use this for the Estee Lauder doublewear foundation. It took some time to get a thick product in there but it works fine. My only complaint would be the price, it costs as much as shipping.</li>
    <li> Quick delivery and so happy with the product.&lt;br /&gt;It also came with instructions and a written thank you from the seller.&lt;br /&gt;I needed it to mix my foundations to make my perfect color. Using for almost a month and it gets the job done.</li>
    <li> This is a great little airless bottle.  It is easy to fill with any product you need, just make sure it is not oily and it is easy to assemble.  I love it.</li>
    <li> Bought four to keep postage reasonable and gave two to my daughter. we love how our make up will last longer and comes out clean each time.</li>
    <li> Does as it says. Lid is nice and tight. Perfect for Revlon colorstay foundation or other foundations. It works like a syringe with a piston moving inwards vs. your usual pump that comes with most makeup you get which relies upon pumping air into the container to maintain pressure.</li>
    <li> I bought four of these to put my revlon colorstay foundation into, since those bottles are sold without a pump.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It worked out great! The pump can distribute a small or large amount of product, depending on how much pressure you apply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottles are also reusable, you just clean with hot, soapy water and refill. These bottles would also be great as travel sized storage for face or body lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seller was great, received my package in a timely manner and it was well packaged.</li>
    <li> These bottles are beautiful and great for reducing the amount oxygen coming in contact with your product to keep it fresh. Great for traveling or making your own items. How it works is as you pump, a bottom piece pushes the product up to reach the dispenser&#x27;s inlet instead of leaving air at the top like regular pump bottles. They are plastic and thus lightweight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottles are re-usable, but of course, because it&#x27;s a small bottle with a small opening I find it hard to clean but that is to be expected.  I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;m doing it correctly, but in order to push the bottom piece back down (when you wash and re-use), I use a chopstick. It seems to work well.</li>
    <li> Awesome product, just make sure when you fill it there are no bubbles to avoid air pockets.</li>
    <li> I bought this to put foundation in so I could have a sanitary and consistent way is dispensing my makeup. It&#x27;s worked for years and very happy with the purchase. May buy more to fill with other products so I don&#x27;t have to dip my fingers in</li>
    <li> I got this for my camellia oil but it didn&#x27;t work very well. The oil would leak out from the top and run all over my gym bag. But works great for my lotion. This size is not very big, but perfect in a carry on.</li>
    <li> I could not get this to work properly.  It pumped out a tiny drop at a time with the bottle two-thirds full and with about fifteen depressions of the pump every time to get anything at all.  I even contacted the seller to see if I was missing a part and was assured that it was complete.  I have no idea how other people get this to work.  Mine went in the trash since it was dirty from trying to make it work after contacting the seller.  Complete waste of money.</li>
    <li> I bought two of these bottles a year ago and they are everything I expected. I have my thick Revlon Colorstay liquid foundation in one and runny Garnier BB Cream in the other. Both pumps are very consistent despite the difference between the two products I use them for. The company also sent an instruction page with my order that was helpful with filling them up for the first time. I would absolutely recommend these.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know about the rest of you makeup consumers but I HATE pour bottles that you get at the drugstore! I purchased this to replace my Revlon Nearly Naked foundation and I LOVE IT! It&#x27;s reusable and so easy to use! I lose a little bit of product transferring to the new bottle but I feel like I would be wasting when I pour out too much on my hand from the pour bottle also. I would definitely purchase again and again!</li>
    <li> I use this bottle to pump out a makeup primer. and first of all, i love how clean and simple it looks. seond of all, the pump works nice and smoothly, which is always great.&lt;br /&gt;either way, if you&#x27;re looking for a good quality pump bottle, this is for you.</li>
    <li> This pump works great, the only thing is it is difficult to clean, but comes apart completely when you need to clean it.</li>
    <li> I got this airless pump bottle because the tube of cream I had broke open, wouldn&#x27;t seal back up and I couldn&#x27;t get the product out without it getting everywhere. This bottle is the perfect solution. Now I&#x27;m able to use my cream again and it dispenses the perfect amount every time. It has a great lid and travels well. Also, the airless pump looks really nice. I actually love this bottle better than the tube the cream originally came in. Will definitely be ordering more of these.</li>
