### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>It is also very good for wounds in wheelchair patients.</li>
      <li>Great product and</li>
      <li>A great product to always have around..</li>
      <li>This stuff is amazing!</li>
      <li>So I was hoping for good results from the comfrey oil.</li>
      <li>but it didn&#x27;t do as good a job of relieving the pain as products I had already been using.</li>
      <li>but my friend has and says the product is good</li>
      <li>I am amazed at how well it works,  it removed a bruise in two days that I have had for months,  amazing</li>
      <li>I read many good things about comfrey&#x27;s properties and was looking for an oil to use to massage the knee and area around it</li>
      <li>I now have my own comfrey plant and have some oil in the making.</li>
      <li>Glad I got this.  </li>
      <li>This oil is fantastic!</li>
      <li>/&gt;Since this is described as using the &amp;#34;whole plant&amp;#34;, that would include the &amp;#34;root&amp;#34; which is again the most toxic part.</li>
      <li>I am happy about this product although i cannot say for sure the extent to which it helps ligamentize my new graft.</li>
      <li>I have used it on a very sensitive skinned dog of mine and it is a good product.</li>
      <li>Even started light jogging.</li>
      <li>That could be do to many things such as my break not being that severe, to my healthy to diet, to taking many vitamins, to using Comfrey Oil.</li>
      <li>, however, this is a truly wonderful compliment to the essential oils that I use for muscle aches...nice and smooth, leaves skin feeling soft.</li>
      <li>I really don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s in my head, but my aches and pains felt much better after applying this oil.</li>
      <li>Oil feels good to the skin but not greasy like other oils.</li>
      <li>Had my ACL reconstructed (blew my right knee out during soccer) and was looking for a homeopathic cream to massage the knee (my story @  aclsurgeryrecovery.wordpress.com/  ).  </li>
      <li>have him put some comfrey oil on and he felt fine the next day!</li>
      <li>I highly recommend everyone have some in their first aid kit.</li>
      <li>but I much prefer this oil.  </li>
      <li>My whole family is now using it.  </li>
      <li>Either way, this oil is very affordable and it wouldn&#x27;t hurt to give it a try.</li>
      <li>Obtaining a Comfrey Plant and caring for it seemed to be too much work, so I looked for an easier option, which ended up being this Comfrey Oil.</li>
      <li>I really did not see a change and did not think that the comfrey oil helped.  </li>
      <li>(the cream absorbs really fast).  </li>
      <li>Works very well as a component in my pain salve that I make.</li>
      <li>So unless this product is specifically pyrrolizidine alkaloid &#x27;free&#x27; (not labeled as such), please do not use on your pets!!!</li>
      <li>Goes on great and a little goes a long way!  </li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s 100% back to normal now.</li>
      <li>I keep it with all the other first aid supplies.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not really sure if it worked or not, I never noticed an immediate difference, but I will say that my ankle healed fairly quickly</li>
      <li>I used it for bug bites and it took out the itch, with the following morning the bites were barely detectible.</li>
      <li>It is especially toxic if ingested and since animals LICK themselves constantly (particularly if they have an injury or skin issue), I find it extremely irresponsible for this Comfrey product to be marketed for pet use!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Yes this saved me 4 weeks of being off work when my van fell on my foot after a scissor jack twisted allowing the van to fall on my 4 fractured toes rubbed on whole foot 3 times a day for a week and a half was able to get Dr. &#x27;S request to go back to work it works!!!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Great product and I use it as part of a cocktail to treat a nagging skin condition!</li>
    <li> Purchased this product for back pain and used it often after recieving it but it didn&#x27;t do as good a job of relieving the pain as products I had already been using.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing! I won&#x27;t be without it again! I now have my own comfrey plant and have some oil in the making. I was a little leery but it has worked wonders. We used it twice on some pretty bad cuts and both times the cuts were healed overnight. I used it for bug bites and it took out the itch, with the following morning the bites were barely detectible. It needs to be applied liberally. Comfrey is a tissue regenerator not a pain reliever, thus why one person said it didn&#x27;t do anything for her back pain.  I highly recommend everyone have some in their first aid kit.</li>
    <li> A great product to always have around.. It helped my knee overnight and I&#x27;m back to working out again.. Even started light jogging. This oil is fantastic!</li>
    <li> Yes this saved me 4 weeks of being off work when my van fell on my foot after a scissor jack twisted allowing the van to fall on my 4 fractured toes rubbed on whole foot 3 times a day for a week and a half was able to get Dr. &#x27;S request to go back to work it works!!!</li>
    <li> Arrived un damaged , didn&#x27;t try it yet but my friend has and says the product is good</li>
    <li> Comfrey root has a TOXIC substance called pyrrolizidine alkaloids. It is especially toxic if ingested and since animals LICK themselves constantly (particularly if they have an injury or skin issue), I find it extremely irresponsible for this Comfrey product to be marketed for pet use!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since this is described as using the &amp;#34;whole plant&amp;#34;, that would include the &amp;#34;root&amp;#34; which is again the most toxic part. This is a liver toxin and may take months to show symtoms (which can be fatal). So unless this product is specifically pyrrolizidine alkaloid &#x27;free&#x27; (not labeled as such), please do not use on your pets!!!</li>
    <li> I am amazed at how well it works,  it removed a bruise in two days that I have had for months,  amazing</li>
    <li> This is another ingredient in my Aloe Vera Gel recipe.</li>
    <li> I use this oil all over while my skin is still damp from a shower.</li>
    <li> I was told that comfrey oil would relieve skin issues for my dog, spots where she licks repeatedly.  I really did not see a change and did not think that the comfrey oil helped.  The solutions offered by the vet, cortisone and antibiotics don&#x27;t produce a  cure either, just temporary fix.  So I was hoping for good results from the comfrey oil.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t think it has anything in it but olive oil.  It smells just like the olive oil I have in the cupboard.  Very disappointed.  Going to send it back.</li>
    <li> I used this product for my broken ankle after hearing about the magical powers of the Comfrey Plant on broken bones. Obtaining a Comfrey Plant and caring for it seemed to be too much work, so I looked for an easier option, which ended up being this Comfrey Oil. I&#x27;m not really sure if it worked or not, I never noticed an immediate difference, but I will say that my ankle healed fairly quickly and it&#x27;s 100% back to normal now. That could be do to many things such as my break not being that severe, to my healthy to diet, to taking many vitamins, to using Comfrey Oil. Maybe it was a combination of all four. Either way, this oil is very affordable and it wouldn&#x27;t hurt to give it a try.</li>
    <li> Had my ACL reconstructed (blew my right knee out during soccer) and was looking for a homeopathic cream to massage the knee (my story @  aclsurgeryrecovery.wordpress.com/  ).  I read many good things about comfrey&#x27;s properties and was looking for an oil to use to massage the knee and area around it (the cream absorbs really fast).  I am happy about this product although i cannot say for sure the extent to which it helps ligamentize my new graft.</li>
    <li> Thsi has been reviewed before but just want to let you know that I use this oil for the relief of arthritis pain my hands and believe it does help.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product a long time ago and have it next to my couch and use it for my cuticles. I have used it on a very sensitive skinned dog of mine and it is a good product. I would recommend it for everyone!</li>
    <li> I take a diluted solution of this but I much prefer this oil.  Glad I got this.  I think if you are taking this you should give this a try.</li>
    <li> Works very well as a component in my pain salve that I make.</li>
    <li> I like the way even though it is oil, it is not too greasy.  I was using a comfrey root salve which was an olive oil base, for arthritis help.  Using the this oil with a lotion is less greasy.  I prefer it over the comfrey root extracts I have used.  I would recommend it for all of your comfrey root uses.  I only use comfrey externally, never ingested.</li>
    <li> I have been reading up on the healing properties of comfrey oil...haven&#x27;t noticed anything yet, however, this is a truly wonderful compliment to the essential oils that I use for muscle aches...nice and smooth, leaves skin feeling soft.</li>
    <li> works well on sore bones</li>
    <li> I really don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s in my head, but my aches and pains felt much better after applying this oil.</li>
    <li> Goes on great and a little goes a long way!  My whole family is now using it.  I keep it with all the other first aid supplies.  With 3 teenage boys someone is almost always getting hurt.  Son fell off his skateboard...have him put some comfrey oil on and he felt fine the next day!</li>
    <li> Never has my dry skin looked so refreshed.  It&#x27;s a pleasure now to apply foundation.  Yes, I recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Oil feels good to the skin but not greasy like other oils. The comfrey plant is a healing plant and heals cracks in skin.It is also very good for wounds in wheelchair patients. You can almost see the skin grow.</li>
