      <li>GREAT product!!</li>
      <li>so I ordered it at Amazon and got a great \\&quot;2</li>
      <li>I have tried so many sunblocks for my face and this is the one that has been the best.  </li>
      <li>One of the best sunblocks I&#x27;ve ever used :)</li>
      <li>Good going Neutrogena, keep inflation going.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I am fair and can burn easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The product is amazing.</li>
      <li>Makes you feel good about protecting yourself too :-)</li>
      <li>This particular sunscreen was shown on TV as being the best of 200+ sunscreens tested.  </li>
      <li>Very light feeling</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>This is a terrific buy at a great price!</li>
      <li>I am glad I bought it.</li>
      <li>I really love this stuff ...</li>
      <li>Better than any of the \\&quot;baby\\&quot; sunblocks out there.  </li>
      <li>Thanks Neutrogena for creating a great product.</li>
      <li>In the meantime search for better affordable sunscreen continues.</li>
      <li>After reading the reviews above, I decided to buy this, and I am very happy with the product.  </li>
      <li>I have very fair skin, but this product lets me be outdoors on the golf course or ski slope all day with only one application.  </li>
      <li>b/c I really need to find an awesome moisturizer with high SPF that does not sting/burn when it is applied on my face.</li>
      <li>This may be an excellent product, but if the manufacturer is unwilling to list \\&quot;active ingredients\\&quot;, it is of no value.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend these products to anyone who needs a good sunblock.</li>
      <li>It goes on kind of greasy, so in the first minute you think</li>
      <li>This makes it perfect as an everyday sunscreen, as well as one to take to the beach.  </li>
      <li>Since I knew I would be using a lot of sunblock on a trip to Hawaii, I thought I would go with a more economical choice.  </li>
      <li>It felt light, not sticky nor greasy.  </li>
      <li>I apply it in the morning and it pretty much lasts me a good 8 hours.</li>
      <li>After a full day in the sun</li>
      <li>I used to think this was ok until I discovered a better sunscreen at the Shiseido counter, one that actually gives no shine whatsoever</li>
      <li>This is definitely one of the better sunscreens found at most drug stores.</li>
      <li>In short, it works, smells and feels good; so much</li>
      <li>your face/skin feels fresh and not oily.</li>
      <li>Well worth the money.</li>
      <li>My grandmother bought my mother and me our own packages, just so we would have enough.  </li>
      <li>but right away it would be sucked by your skin and</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m very fair and have sensitive, slightly oily skin.  </li>
      <li>I like this product very much.  </li>
      <li>I really hope they don&#x27;t change this formula!</li>
      <li>Like other reviewers have stated, it goes on well, absorbs quickly, does not smell like most sunscreens, and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy.  </li>
      <li>This one actually works and has a non-greasy feel and drys very quickly</li>
      <li>For daily use it&#x27;s fine.</li>
      <li>This sunblock is very effective at preventing tanning or burning, but the amazing thing about it is  that it is effective without being thick, greasy, and unpleasant.  </li>
      <li>However, this lotion tends to run into my eyes and it really burns and stings.</li>
      <li>It applies smoothly, is absolutely non greasy, and provides the protection it says it does.  </li>
      <li>think this product is well worth the money, it is quickly absorbed into the skin and has a dry feel.</li>
      <li>I found that this sunscreen feels pretty sheer when it&#x27;s first applied, but not as much as it claims.</li>
      <li>HIGHLY recommended.</li>
      <li>I have combination skin, and it&#x27;s a little more difficult to find a good face lotion.</li>
      <li>I have Normal to Oily, sensitive, acne-prone skin.</li>
      <li>Wow.</li>
      <li>So far, this is the one sunblock I WILL wear.</li>
      <li>With overly sensitive skin, I require, not need, a sunblock that works all day, impervious to ocean spray or sweat.</li>

<li> I typically use a more expensive sunblock.  </li>
<li> I went all day without even getting pink!</li>
<li> Oh and Jake it does have active ingredients listed.</li>
<li> Not as oily as the Active but dries faster and goes on smoother/easier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;July</li>

<li> For the past 6 years I used Neutrogena Active SPF-45 4 oz</li>
<li> During my trip, I applied it liberally everyday on my face and didn&#x27;t have any breakout problems at all.  </li>
<li> It is also one of the few 45 SPFs I have used on my face that doesn&#x27;t drip into my eyes when I am running or riding.  </li>
<li> I am SUPER disappointed</li>
<li> It is comparatively costly (3 oz tubes are small)</li>
<li> By the way, I also noticed a decrease in the amount of shine combination skin usually tends to get throughout the day.</li>
<li> Because of this, it was difficult to find at the local drug stores</li>
<li> If I apply this before playing sport, in less than 20 minutes my face feels like it&#x27;s trying to sweat behind a mask.  </li>
<li> I decided to purchase this version after reading some of the negative reviews about the Helioplex version and its flaking issues.</li>
<li> I should mention that I decided to experiment with the newer Dry-Touch Sunblock SPF 55 with helioplex, and found that to be thicker and slightly irritating to my skin.  </li>
<li> I really hate smelly sunscreen, and it doesn&#x27;t have a noticeable odor either.  </li>

    <li> This is the 2nd year that I have used the Neutrogena Ultra Sheer Dry-Touch Sunblock, SPF 45. I have Normal to Oily, sensitive, acne-prone skin. I am fair and can burn easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think this product is well worth the money, it is quickly absorbed into the skin and has a dry feel. It does not make your skin look greasy and has never caused me to break out. I apply it in the morning and it pretty much lasts me a good 8 hours. The time will vary depending on your sun tolerance, though. It is also conveniently sized to toss in your bag and lasts quite awhile.</li>
    <li> This is definitely one of the better sunscreens found at most drug stores. I found that this sunscreen feels pretty sheer when it&#x27;s first applied, but not as much as it claims. If I apply this before playing sport, in less than 20 minutes my face feels like it&#x27;s trying to sweat behind a mask.  For daily use it&#x27;s fine. Also this still imparts a whitish appearance to the face. I used to think this was ok until I discovered a better sunscreen at the Shiseido counter, one that actually gives no shine whatsoever (Neutrogena still gives a slight shine), but then that cost me an arm and leg.  In the meantime search for better affordable sunscreen continues.</li>
    <li> I really love this stuff ... I have tried so many sunblocks for my face and this is the one that has been the best.  It is very sheer - not oily but moisturizing.  I like the way is goes under my makeup, too, on the days I wear a foundation.  It is also one of the few 45 SPFs I have used on my face that doesn&#x27;t drip into my eyes when I am running or riding.  GREAT product!!</li>
    <li> We took this on our trip to the Caribbean recently. Normally I burn within about a half hour of sun exposure. I went all day without even getting pink! In the water, out of the water, it didn&#x27;t matter. Once in a while you find a product that actually works. This WORKS. It doesn&#x27;t have an over whelming odor. It dries and is not greasy. I actually got to take my shirt off and not have to worry about burning. The Coppertone just sits in the cabinet now</li>
    <li> For the past 6 years I used Neutrogena Active SPF-45 4 oz but it has been replaced with the $heer Dry-Touch $PF-45 at 3 oz and twice as expen$ive. Good going Neutrogena, keep inflation going.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aside from that, I am an active outdoors person sitting on my deck reading, or on my sailboat, fishing, or riding my bike to name a few activities. With overly sensitive skin, I require, not need, a sunblock that works all day, impervious to ocean spray or sweat. Neutrogena&#x27;s Sheer Dry-Touch SPF-45 fits the bill to a \\&quot;T\\&quot; and works as it should. Not as oily as the Active but dries faster and goes on smoother/easier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;July 2010 - Walmart has it for $7.00 online</li>
    <li> My entire family swears by this sunscreen.  My grandmother bought my mother and me our own packages, just so we would have enough.  It is not greasy at all, and you cannot even feel or smell it once its applied.  This makes it perfect as an everyday sunscreen, as well as one to take to the beach.  HIGHLY recommended.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very fair and have sensitive, slightly oily skin.  This sunblock is very effective at preventing tanning or burning, but the amazing thing about it is  that it is effective without being thick, greasy, and unpleasant.  The sunscreen goes on and seems to disappear into the skin.  I really hate smelly sunscreen, and it doesn&#x27;t have a noticeable odor either.  No irritation, no breakouts.  I should mention that I decided to experiment with the newer Dry-Touch Sunblock SPF 55 with helioplex, and found that to be thicker and slightly irritating to my skin.  I really hope they don&#x27;t change this formula!</li>
    <li> I have very fair skin, but this product lets me be outdoors on the golf course or ski slope all day with only one application.  This one actually works and has a non-greasy feel and drys very quickly</li>
    <li> Wow. I love it. I have combination skin, and it&#x27;s a little more difficult to find a good face lotion. It goes on kind of greasy, so in the first minute you think \\&quot;ew, this is too much\\&quot; but right away it would be sucked by your skin and it just becomes like you never even put it on. By the way, I also noticed a decrease in the amount of shine combination skin usually tends to get throughout the day. Plus it&#x27;s 45 SPF. Makes you feel good about protecting yourself too :-)</li>
    <li> So far, this is the one sunblock I WILL wear. It doesn&#x27;t smell like sunblock, it doesn&#x27;t feel like a sunblock, it doesn&#x27;t clog my pores and make my face \\&quot;glow\\&quot; and shine. In short, it works, smells and feels good; so much so I like using it! Thanks Neutrogena for creating a great product.</li>
    <li> The product is amazing. After a full day in the sun your face/skin feels fresh and not oily. However, you should just go to CVS or another pharmacy to buy it because its cheaper than getting it on Amazon. Oh and Jake it does have active ingredients listed.</li>
    <li> A lot of moms now use this sunblock for our kids, babies even.  Its really sheer -- non-oily and doesn&#x27;t leave that white sheen on you.  Better than any of the \\&quot;baby\\&quot; sunblocks out there.  Well worth the money.</li>
    <li> I have to use sunblock because of my skin type.  I have tried others and Neutrogena is the best!  It is non greasy, (I use it under my makeup), blocks the sun rays and stays on long. When I go to work I have morning sun on the left side of my body and when I go home I have afternoon sun on the left side again.  I had a \\&quot;farmers tan\\&quot;, the strip on my arm and on my face.  Started using Neutrogena and the stripe is gone.  I use the regular Neutrogena sunblock on my arms and use the dry touch on my face and neck.  I highly recommend these products to anyone who needs a good sunblock.</li>
    <li> I typically use a more expensive sunblock.  Since I knew I would be using a lot of sunblock on a trip to Hawaii, I thought I would go with a more economical choice.  After reading the reviews above, I decided to buy this, and I am very happy with the product.  During my trip, I applied it liberally everyday on my face and didn&#x27;t have any breakout problems at all.  It felt light, not sticky nor greasy.  This is a terrific buy at a great price!</li>
    <li> Like other reviewers have stated, it goes on well, absorbs quickly, does not smell like most sunscreens, and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy.  I&#x27;ve also used it on my face with no problems.  I decided to purchase this version after reading some of the negative reviews about the Helioplex version and its flaking issues.</li>
    <li> Very light feeling and it doesn&#x27;t make my skin feel oily/greasy at all...I also haven&#x27;t had any of that burning eye sensation when I apply it to my face. One of the best sunblocks I&#x27;ve ever used :)</li>
    <li> This may be an excellent product, but if the manufacturer is unwilling to list \\&quot;active ingredients\\&quot;, it is of no value.</li>
    <li> I like this product very much.  It applies smoothly, is absolutely non greasy, and provides the protection it says it does.  It is comparatively costly (3 oz tubes are small) but this was recommended to me by my dermatologist to prevent both UVA and UVB exposure.  I am glad I bought it.</li>
    <li> I thought I should share some info about this product. I am a big fan of Neutrogena. However, this lotion tends to run into my eyes and it really burns and stings. I use their 30+ sunblock stick, and it does not sting when you touch your eyes/face. I am SUPER disappointed b/c I really need to find an awesome moisturizer with high SPF that does not sting/burn when it is applied on my face.</li>
    <li> This particular sunscreen was shown on TV as being the best of 200+ sunscreens tested.  Because of this, it was difficult to find at the local drug stores so I ordered it at Amazon and got a great \\&quot;2 for\\&quot; deal.</li>
