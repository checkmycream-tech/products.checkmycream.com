      <li>I fell in love with the orignal Daisy from the beginning</li>

      <li>I love this perfume sooooo much!</li>
      <li>and I love it from the first smell.</li>
      <li>Looks like an original one</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Took a chance purchasing for wife. She loves it and so do I. Uses it everyday. Pleasant fragrance.</li>
    <li> I purchased this perfume back in June 2011. It&#x27;s been a short 5 months and it&#x27;s already almost gone! I love this perfume sooooo much! I smell good and feel good when I wear it. If my morning didn&#x27;t go so well, I squirt this a few times and it&#x27;s literally a \\&quot;pick-me-up\\&quot; becuase it smells so good. The scent lasts on your clothes all day but only if you layer it with the lotion. I get tons and tons of compliments on this perfume, never fails. My roomate is constantly trying to steal some, I&#x27;ve resorted to hiding it from her! I call it \\&quot;the good stuff\\&quot;!</li>
    <li> I have been a fan of the perfume Daisy for many years, but I like this Daisy Eau So Fresh even better. It has a very light, fresh, clean scent; not over powering at all. The scent doesn&#x27;t fade away, but stays nice all day. Love this!</li>
    <li> Fresh, light, not so overpowering that you can&#x27;t wear it daily, a hint of spring every day that gets noticed in a good way. The cap is cute, but impractical for travel.</li>
    <li> Lovely light scent, sweet and fresh.  It is slightly floral but not powdery or overpowering. This is a nice everyday perfume.</li>
    <li> Notes:&lt;br /&gt;Natural Raspberry, Grapefruit, Pear, Violet, Wild Rose, Apple Blossom, Musks, Cedarwood, Plum.&lt;br /&gt;Style:&lt;br /&gt;Exhilarating. Bubbly. Playful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this scent, woodsy and slightly sweet!</li>
    <li> I got this as a gift for myself at the end of my pregnancy and it is the BEST! I get so many compilments everywhere I go on how wonderful it smells. It&#x27;s light and fresh and wonderful! My husband and I are buying some for my mother in-law for Mother&#x27;s Day, as she raves about it everytime she smells it on me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**About the matching lotion, I purchased my perfume at Macy&#x27;s when they were giving a free large bottle of the Daisy Eau So Fresh Lotion with the purchase of the large bottle of perfume and the lotion does NOT smell exactly the same and I actully do not like the smell of the lotion at all.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love the scent, which is light, fresh and floral.  But it doesn&#x27;t last as long as one would think a more expensive cologne would last.  I wear it all the time, and just refesh it if I need to.</li>
    <li> I bought this item as a gift for my sister and she loved it. Hasn&#x27;t given me any complaints about it.</li>
    <li> This perfume smells great on my wife.  I&#x27;m glad that I bought it for her, but the down side is that it doesn&#x27;t seem to last very long.  One thing that I like about it is that it doesn&#x27;t smell like every other girl that you walk by.  It could definitely be a signature scent.</li>
    <li> This is hands down my favorite perfume of all time--reminds me of gum drops and flowers. The scent is unbelievably beautiful and light, but lasts for several hours. I purchased 3 other perfumes within a week&#x27;s time of receiving this one in the mail, and wish that I would have splurged a little more for the large bottle of Eau So Fresh because it is the only one I really care to wear. This is a fragrance that is made for all women. Even if you prefer more musky, strong scents, and especially if you are a fan of sweet scents, GIVE THIS ONE A TRY. I promise you will not be disappointed. I am an extremely picky perfume wearer, but this one will most definitely stay in rotation for quite some time.</li>
    <li> this is perfect, very good fragrance. I have bought for my daughter as birthday present and she loves it very much. thank the seller very much.</li>
    <li> Amazon definitely had the best deal around; normal price for 2.5 fl oz is $89.50. Got this for $49.99. It&#x27;s not a fake either, 100% authentic!! The smell is so light and fresh it&#x27;s one of my favorites scents. So glad I found here for this amazing price!! Got it fast with Prime too!! Great purchase all around!  ðŸ˜Š</li>
    <li> Love the scent! It&#x27;s light and great for the summer time. It will last a long time too especially if you&#x27;re like me and have many other perfumes. Well worth the price!!</li>
    <li> Ive never smelled anything like this one before. Im a BIG fan of juicy coutures viva la juicy, but its not unique like this, there is other things that smell similar to it.It got here in 2 days, it came UPS, very fast, no problems whatsoever! i bought this after smelling a sample in a magazine, and when i recieved the bottle i was shocked when i smelled it. it smells nothing like the sample. thats okay though. it has a flowery tone to it, it doesnt come off as being really fruity to me though, it has more of a musky/soapy/flowery/fresh smell on my skin. I love it though, very unique. Def. reccommend this for anybodys perfume collection! i got the 2.5 fl oz, and it is a big bottle will last a long time!</li>
    <li> Not sure if this is an original make because the smell doesn&#x27;t even stay for an hour.</li>
    <li> Everything was great with this order. The perfume smell awesome and the deliver time was great too!! I will definitely ordering this perfume again~</li>
    <li> What a great perfume!  So nice and fresh smelling!  Not over-powering in any way.  Will definitely order it again when I run out.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been eyeing this perfume for the past year and finally bought it. It&#x27;s significantly cheaper on amazon and the shipping was extremely fast. The perfume has the cutest packaging, smells great, and lasts all day. I can even still smell it faintly the next morning. I would definitely recommend it!</li>
    <li> One of my favorites!!! Love it. Came right on time. Looks like an original one so I don&#x27;t know but it&#x27;s the same scent and it lasts a long time on me.</li>
    <li> Wonderful fresh and sweet scent.  My 16 year old daughter is obsessed with it.  This size can run $90 in the department store.&lt;br /&gt;Getting it for less than $50 is a great bargain.</li>
    <li> I love the scent so much I also bought the lotion. It&#x27;s a light fresh smell which I love. Even though it&#x27;s not heavy it lasts through the day. I also love that I get compliments all the time from men and women.</li>
    <li> The fragerance is lovely.  However it&#x27;s staying power is lacking.  For that reason I do not feel that there is much bang for the buck as it is fairly pricey.</li>
    <li> My boyfriend and I love this smell so much. Not too strong. I think it lasts pretty long. Cute packaging :)</li>
    <li> My wife&#x27;s birthday gift was a hit with this perfume.  Plus she, like most girls, loves the cutsey flowers on the bottle...&lt;br /&gt;I scored extra points, wahoo!</li>
    <li> The wife loves the way this perfume smells</li>
    <li> Purchased this as a gift for my son&#x27;s girlfriend...and he actually paid me for it, but she loved it and it smelled great...he got some serious brownie points for this present!</li>
    <li> Its the right one, smells great!</li>
    <li> A GREAT FLORAL, LAST ALL DAY  GIVES THE FEELING OF FRESHNESS.  WORTH THE PRICE  i WOULD  KEEP THIS ITEM  ON MY WISH LIST.</li>
    <li> this product got to me within a few days of ordering it.  SO FAST!!  The smell is beautiful and I wear it everyday!  great product and I definitely recommend it!</li>
    <li> I only use this spray even though I have many others.  It&#x27;s subtle and feminine.  My husband love it and I love it from the first smell. I recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I purchased this as a gift and she loves it! I also sampled it and it smells great, a definite addition to any woman&#x27;s perfume collection. Very suttle smell and flowery.</li>
    <li> Great smell. Great packaging. Got this for my sister as a birthday gift and she loves it. Fantastic size too, will last you probably 2 years if you use a squirt a day!</li>
    <li> shipment was super fast but not crazy about the smell that I smelled in a magazine card.  Will not be buying it again</li>
    <li> I enjoy this perfume. It is light and  subtle. Just what I like in a  perfume. The bottle top is flowery clusters of daisies, and is playful and pleasing to the eye. Looks great on my vanity. I would recommend it to anyone looking for a fresh, clean, airy scent in a perfume.</li>
    <li> Almost half the price for the fullsize brand new bottle, shipped quickly, couldn&#x27;t be happier</li>
    <li> My daughter&#x27;s been wanting this for months and I surprised her at Christmas with it.  She is elated!  We are big Marc Jacbos perfume fans due to the light soft smell and lasting power of his perfumes.</li>
    <li> I was very happy to find such a great price for this perfume.  It is a fresh, clean scent-not too strong, just what I was looking for.  It was shipped to my house very quickly, which was great.</li>
    <li> Bought for my boyfiend&#x27;s mother. She loves the product! I thinks she might have ordered more of it off of here</li>
    <li> doesn&#x27;t last after one minute. it doesn&#x27;t worth the money, probably it is fake.,</li>
    <li> Love the scent and the price!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s such a perfect scent for the warmer seasons it&#x27;s lighter and fresh without being overpoweringly sweet or flowery and it comes in one of the cutest bottles ever almost as cute as his dot bottle!!!!</li>
    <li> I love this scent and it stays on well.  I saw this at the Ulta stores but found it here online for less!</li>
    <li> I love this perfume.  It is fragrant, but light and refreshing.  I have the regular Marc Jacobs Daisy perfume, and love that too, but this has a much lighter scent, more airy.</li>
    <li> delicious duration of 6 to 7 hours good projection and fixing a special smell</li>
    <li> I receive many compliments on this perfume. It is light and not overpowering. The bottle is beautiful. My daughter also loves the scent.</li>
    <li> It smells ok, not as original one,but it&#x27;s not bad,and the smell lasts quite long... I am happy to have it</li>
    <li> I feel so sad, I thought  that I was doing a great deal bc if I buy it in any department store, I would have to pay twice the price that I paid here... Well the shipping was ok,on time; however, the perfume is not... The smell is good not to soft, not too strong but after maybe 30 minutes is GONE! I cant smell it at all! I will never buy a perfume from amazon again... Pretty disappointing.</li>
    <li> Although I got it for a long time, I love it very much.It smells good and the bottle is beautiful.</li>
    <li> This is the second time I&#x27;ve purchased this product for my wife. She liked it so much the first time I had to get it for her again.</li>
    <li> smells great but it only lasts like for 5 minutes because is Eau de Toilette.  Needed to purchase the Eau de Parfume.</li>
    <li> So light and beautiful</li>
    <li> Arrivered fast&lt;br /&gt;Smelled nice !</li>
    <li> This is a great fragrence for those who are in love with their florals. It just wasn&#x27;t for me, it smelled way too sweet.</li>
    <li> Soft spring woodsy clean scent. It lasts for hours. Many people says it only last for 30min or so, not true. Like most perfumes, once you put it on you become immune to the scent and don&#x27;t smell it, but others do. I work in a smoke filled casino and I&#x27;m constantly told that I smell nice. Just proof that it lasts.</li>
    <li> I love Marc Jacobs I have all his perfumes but my collection of all is his Dasiy line</li>
    <li> I fell in love with the orignal Daisy from the beginning so I decided to give the Eau So Fresh version a try. I do not think the scent lasts as long as the orginal Daisy but it has a very clean and fresch scent that is great for day/work wear.</li>
    <li> This is one of my favorite perfumes!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It smells soooooo good! It&#x27;s definitely a lot softer than the original Marc Jacobs Daisy... I recommend this one instead. It&#x27;s soft, girly, and floral. Lasts several hours, and not that this matters THAT much but...the bottle is so cute! and you can also save some money and buy the 4.0 bottle and it will last you a while.</li>
    <li> I do believe this is fake. Doesn&#x27;t stay on your skin after 20 min. Horrible!</li>
    <li> I ordered this perfume in September of 2013 and have used as my daily fragrance consistently since that time.  I had noticed a handful of reviews with thoughts that this product may be fake.  I chose to ignore these since initially the quality seemed to be authentic, and I routinely received compliments on how lovely it smells.  Over the last couple months of, I noticed the general strength of the scent was declining, however it still maintained the same fragrance.  Today, I spritzed on my usual two sprays and it was like I had doused myself in rubbing alcohol.  Overnight, the scent seems to have completely deteriorated.  It has been about an hour now and the rubbing alcohol smell has dissipated, but the scent of the perfume is incredibly weak.  I am so disappointed seeing as I have not even owned this bottle for a year and it is only about a third of the way gone.  I&#x27;ve worn perfume and sprays for years and have never had one go rancid this quickly.  Will not be reordering and I am extremely disappointed in the quality, especially considering it was sold by Amazon.com.</li>
    <li> This Marc Jacobs Daisy product is just right for a light scent that is not overwhelming.  It works well in the office setting.</li>
    <li> Fresh beautiful everyday scent. I love it! My husband cannot get enough of it! This was a really great gift.</li>
    <li> By far the best perfume I&#x27;ve EVER smelled in my entire life! I will continue to purchase until the day I&#x27;m no longer here! That&#x27;s how beautiful it is to me!</li>
    <li> Purchased this perfume as gift for niece.&lt;br /&gt;She loves the scent.&lt;br /&gt;Price for the item was fantastic, would purchase again.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t see the volume of perfume listed and ended up being the small bottle for expenses price rather than the big bottle for a cheap price.</li>
    <li> Product which we have used before continues to be an excellent choice fragrance. We highly recommend this product. Thank you.</li>
    <li> my fave perfume and at a great price!</li>
    <li> Very light and fresh. I absolutely love it and never get tired of wearing it! A little on the sweeter side, but definitely not overwhelming.</li>
