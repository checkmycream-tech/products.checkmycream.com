<li> and I am quite sensitive to some products.  </li>
<li> With this, the eyeshadow is SO vibrant and stays in place way past midnight.    </li>
<li> a ittle goes a long way.</li>
<li> Ask the other brands are pricey but do the same thing.</li>
<li> and I still have plenty left because a little goes a long way.</li>
<li> The product itself is thick and applies much like other products; a little goes a long way.  </li>
<li> I will be using this from now on, after trying so many and being disappointed.  </li>
<li> It is a primer and takes a little bit longer to dry then other brands.  </li>
<li> Not worth the money.</li>
<li> , i do still use i have not tried putting on shadow without a base and will have to see if its any better.</li>
<li> I then started to apply less of the primer...</li>
<li> This product is on the thick side, so a little goes a long way.</li>
<li> You just have to dab a little bit on your eyelid and rub it in  with your finger.</li>
<li> It is NOTtoo heavy for me.</li>
<li> it is inexpensive but still a waste of money.</li>
<li> this lasts about 6 hours before creasing a little &amp; I usually take my makeup off soon after,</li>
<li> i was very excited to get this, but now i&#x27;m very disappointed.</li>
<li> but since i hardly wear shadow I don&#x27;t know.</li>
<li> was not happy.  </li>
<li> which is irritating</li>
<li> and it says it will be NO good after six months LIESSS !</li>
<li> At 0730 this morning, my eyeshadow had a bad case of the \\&quot;creasies\\&quot;-I</li>
<li> Save yourself the disappointment and money!</li>
<li> All day base, sometimes I just use it and no shadow.  </li>
<li> and I must say this is one of the worst primers out there.</li>
<li> I always had a problem with my oily eyelids and a nasty looking crease mark-</li>

    <li> Sally&#x27;s quit carrying this, so glad i found it again!!!</li>
    <li> Its awesome!! You just have to dab a little bit on your eyelid and rub it in  with your finger. I would recommend it to anyone :)</li>
    <li> I bought this primer and I must say this is one of the worst primers out there. Be warned. There is a reason this product is only $4 because it&#x27;s a very crappy product. If you want to look like you have cheap eyeshadow then use this product. Not worth the money.</li>
    <li> This Eye Primer is wonderful.  It doesn&#x27;t crease or cause the crinkly/crepe effect that some primers do.  My eye shadow goes on smoothly and stays on.  It&#x27;s also good to dab on under your eye as a concealer.  I will be using this from now on, after trying so many and being disappointed.  The color is perfect for my light skin and I had no reaction, no itching or burning.  Just a great product and the price is so great.</li>
    <li> Great shipping time and it does its job well. I only use eye make-up and it really does make the eye shadows look more pigmented and they DO NOT crease at all. Pleased w/ this purchase. The price was a bonus!</li>
    <li> Im VERY into makeup i love my Urban Decay primer potion i only have the mini one that came with my naked pallete , i wanted to try this out because it was cheap i received it last year and it says it will be NO good after six months LIESSS ! i have it now and its november i&#x27;ve had for almost year now and i still have ALOT of the product i also use it as a concealer and on my blemishes i have very oily lids and this works i pair it with my nyx jumbo stick . LOVE LOVE LOVE this primer and 4.99 you cant beat it&lt;3</li>
    <li> I bought this primer as I complain constantly about the bottle design of Urban Decay&#x27;s Primer Potion.  I read some decent reviews and figured I would give it a whirl.  I used it for the first and last time today.  I applied my eyeshadow at about 6 am this morning.  The product itself is thick and applies much like other products; a little goes a long way.  At 0730 this morning, my eyeshadow had a bad case of the \\&quot;creasies\\&quot;-I was not happy.  Having no choice but to continue to wear my eye makeup in its current state for the remainder of the day, I have this to say, there hasn&#x27;t been any \\&quot;more\\&quot; creasing.  Most of the time when my eye makeup creases, it will in fact crease, and then clump.  This wasn&#x27;t the case with this primer.  I would suggest using this primer for makeup tutorials or if you don&#x27;t plan to wear eyeshadow for extended periods of time.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  I purchased it from Sallys and they have stopped carrying it, I was delighted to find it on Amazon.  All day base, sometimes I just use it and no shadow.  No irritation at all and I am quite sensitive to some products.  Great Price, I just paid $20 for a similar product that I cannot use.</li>
    <li> Nothing spectacular to review.  It is a primer and takes a little bit longer to dry then other brands.  Although I have to say that it is a great value for the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Arrived way earlier then promised.</li>
    <li> It keeps the shadow on but it definitely creases within 5 minutes of putting it on. i do NOT recommend this product at all! right now it is all i have which is irritating, i do still use i have not tried putting on shadow without a base and will have to see if its any better. I wish i would not have bought this it is inexpensive but still a waste of money. i was very excited to get this, but now i&#x27;m very disappointed. Save yourself the disappointment and money!</li>
    <li> I had to buy this from Amazon as Sally&#x27;s no longer sells it. Thank God it is still on the market. I use it for under eye circles. I have the bluish kind ( so the orange in the primer counteracts the blue circles. I suppose it would work as intended as a primer but since i hardly wear shadow I don&#x27;t know.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years.  Works great and doesn&#x27;t cake or run.  I couldn&#x27;t get it any more at Sally&#x27;s and was thrilled to find it on Amazon.</li>
    <li> In my opinion the texture of this product is gooey. I then started to apply less of the primer...a ittle goes a long way. Overall it kept my eye shadow in place and free of creases.</li>
    <li> I have been looking for a good eyeshadow primer for a while so I decided to try this out. My eyeshadow would always crease by the time school was over. With this, the eyeshadow is SO vibrant and stays in place way past midnight.    I recommend it for people that don&#x27;t want to shell out money on some more expensive things like the urban decay primer potion.</li>
    <li> This product does it&#x27;s job. It works really well. When I first got into makeup, I never wore any primer (aaaahh!!). But that Christmas night when i got this and did my makeup, i was literally like \\&quot;WOWWWWW\\&quot;. Such a big freakin difference. Also, dont put too much on, b/c then it will crease. Just use what you need. It can be easy to squirt out too much, also.</li>
    <li> This product is pretty good for the price I paid. Ive been using this for over a year now &amp; it works pretty well. I always had a problem with my oily eyelids and a nasty looking crease mark- this lasts about 6 hours before creasing a little &amp; I usually take my makeup off soon after, so all in all its not bad.</li>
    <li> This eye primer is amazing, it keeps my eyeshadows on all day long, I have never had to reapply my eyesahdow using this primer. It makes my eyesahdows look great and best of all it stays looking great all day long until I take it off at night. I have had this primer for a year and I still have plenty left because a little goes a long way. I will be buying this eye primer again:)</li>
    <li> This product is on the thick side, so a little goes a long way. It is NOTtoo heavy for me. I have very oily skin, especially on the lids and around my eyes. It works very well to keep shadow in place. No scent. The sponge applicator at the tip is excellent for spreading the product without geting it on your fingers or having to tug on lids. The color is good for under all colors of shadows or alone with just mascara. I would buy this product again. The price is great for the amount of product and the staying power of the product.</li>
    <li> I love it. I was very thankful to be able to buy it from Amazon when I learned it was no longer in the store I normally bought it from.</li>
    <li> I like this item , which is now discontinued in Sally beauty and as under eye coverage it seems real good over total effect of oil of Olay</li>
    <li> It works just fine for.the price. Ask the other brands are pricey but do the same thing. Not a bad buy</li>
    <li> Been using this for over a year and love love love it! Highly recommend. Eye makeup stays put all day. Primer also works as a spot cover up for me.</li>
