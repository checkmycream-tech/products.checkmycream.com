### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>This is awesome.  </li>
      <li>Am 73, and it provides great coverage!</li>
      <li>I put a finishing powder from Lucy minerals over it, and my skin looks perfect.</li>
      <li>I would recommend this to anyone who is looking for the perfect makeup</li>
      <li>I have lots of redness and irritation from passed makeup and this evened out my skin perfectly</li>
      <li>lol.</li>
      <li>It gives great coverage though.</li>
      <li>It is a great shade for my very fair skin and manages to leave it feeling light and as if I&#x27;m not wearing anything.</li>
      <li>I like the coverage and pureness of the product, and that special application brush pairs up with it perfectly.</li>
      <li>Great coverage, very light.</li>
      <li>Love this makeup!</li>
      <li>/&gt;-coverage isnt as nice as the powder foundations</li>
      <li>I set it with the perfecting veil compressed powder and it gives it a nice matte finish.</li>
      <li>Most over 80 buck</li>
      <li>and I LOVE this one.</li>
      <li>Love it&#x27;</li>
      <li>/&gt;Please be aware that I&#x27;m not the best at applying makeup as I don&#x27;t wear much...</li>
      <li>This is a pretty close match though when blended in really good.</li>
      <li>im pretty fair</li>
      <li>Also, despite having very fair skin this was nearly white...</li>
      <li>Other than that, it works perfectly on my oily skin.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve always loved bare minerals but it was always pricey for me..</li>
      <li>First of all, I really appreciate how this product gives my skin a glow and is perfect for the areas where I need light or minimal coverage but could use some brightening.</li>
      <li>so much too light for me</li>
      <li>The price is worth it because it doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin and make me have breakouts.</li>
      <li>I got this in the mail super fast!</li>
      <li>but I could not get it quite right.  </li>
      <li>I would like a little more matte finish, as my skin is very oily, but otherwise love it!</li>
      <li>Its pretty off putting imo</li>
      <li>, it feels light not heavy at all.</li>
      <li>Maybe with more practice I would have gotten the proper effect</li>
      <li>It was good during the winter, but once I got some sun, it was too pale.</li>
      <li>The staying power leaves much to be desired</li>
      <li>I cant afford the whole collection</li>
      <li>Having used the bare mineral foundation I was excited to try this new product.  </li>
      <li>I love everything about this foundation EXCEPT it is still too dark for me!</li>
      <li>Looks very natural.</li>
      <li>and it made me look like I had white circles under my eye which made them stand out more than the dark circles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The consistency is thin, light, but the coverage it provides is full.</li>
      <li>doesnt feel oily to the touch and it looks natural</li>
      <li>... blends soo well and NOT HEAVY feeling.</li>
      <li>So I started using drug store foundations, tried to find something I loved and failed.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t use it alone because I do have adult acne to a rather annoying degree, however, it works as a perfect primer for the powder foundation/concealer</li>
      <li>I decided to try the new bare skin, the make up person at ulta</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s strange, but you have to really be careful not to use too much!!!</li>
      <li>It covers my red eczema completely.</li>
      <li>Went a couple days without makeup and finally decided to continue using bare minerals.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> First of all, I really appreciate how this product gives my skin a glow and is perfect for the areas where I need light or minimal coverage but could use some brightening. It is a great shade for my very fair skin and manages to leave it feeling light and as if I&#x27;m not wearing anything. I can&#x27;t use it alone because I do have adult acne to a rather annoying degree, however, it works as a perfect primer for the powder foundation/concealer and I use it all over before applying the powder on trouble areas and using a darker powder to deepen the color on my cheekbones. I&#x27;ve gotten a lot of compliments since I purchased this so I am definitely a fan.</li>
    <li> This is awesome.  It&#x27;s strange, but you have to really be careful not to use too much!!! Am 73, and it provides great coverage!</li>
    <li> Well this didn&#x27;t work for me at all.  I do like the smoothness of the application but it will collect in tiny wrinkles around/under your eye if you have any.  Also, despite having very fair skin this was nearly white... so much too light for me and it made me look like I had white circles under my eye which made them stand out more than the dark circles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please be aware that I&#x27;m not the best at applying makeup as I don&#x27;t wear much... so take my review - and please try for yourself... I would hate to mislead anyone about the product if it&#x27;s just me... and my inexperience!</li>
    <li> To drying gave it to my daughter, since she has oily skin!</li>
    <li> I love everything about this foundation EXCEPT it is still too dark for me! I am VERY pale, nearly white as paper. Other than that, it works perfectly on my oily skin. The consistency is thin, light, but the coverage it provides is full.</li>
    <li> Love this makeup! I purchased the porcelain color... im pretty fair... blends soo well and NOT HEAVY feeling.</li>
    <li> Awesone product! Love it&#x27;</li>
    <li> Pros: applies nicely&lt;br /&gt;-soft to the touch&lt;br /&gt;-natural skin finish&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-it doesnt feel oily to the touch and it looks natural but you can feel it sitting on your skin and i feel like it sits heavy on my pores. Im not sure how to describe it. The sensation of wearing it feels heavier and oily even though it doesnt look it or feel like it when you touch it.&lt;br /&gt;-strong powder smell. Its pretty off putting imo&lt;br /&gt;-it creases sometimes&lt;br /&gt;-coverage isnt as nice as the powder foundations</li>
    <li> I wish it had the same staying power as the minerals. This wipes off (transfers).  I like the coverage and pureness of the product, and that special application brush pairs up with it perfectly.</li>
    <li> Great coverage, very light. Looks very natural. Does not break out my face.</li>
    <li> I got this in the mail super fast! I&#x27;m very pale and usually have to mix foundations with a white shade. This is a pretty close match though when blended in really good. The staying power leaves much to be desired but I&#x27;m going to experiment with different primers and powders.</li>
    <li> I have bought a few brands. Most over 80 buck and I LOVE this one. Only one I will use from now on</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always loved bare minerals but it was always pricey for me.. So I started using drug store foundations, tried to find something I loved and failed. After months (almost a year) of using drug store foundation i tossed out my last one because it broke me out so bad. Went a couple days without makeup and finally decided to continue using bare minerals. The price is worth it because it doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin and make me have breakouts. I decided to try the new bare skin, the make up person at ulta informed me that it was a &amp;#34;total drag queen makeup&amp;#34; to me it sounded heavy but thought why not. I HATE the cakey makeup look and this is not cakey or &amp;#34;drag queen&amp;#34; like at all! I have lots of redness and irritation from passed makeup and this evened out my skin perfectly, it feels light not heavy at all. I set it with the perfecting veil compressed powder and it gives it a nice matte finish. Not oily at all. I also applied the foundation with a regular eco brush (around $6) and not the one that was made for it. I cant afford the whole collection lol. I would recommend this to anyone who is looking for the perfect makeup</li>
    <li> This one is slightly yellow based, but very pale. It was good during the winter, but once I got some sun, it was too pale. It gives great coverage though. I just use my fingers to apply it. It covers my red eczema completely. I put a finishing powder from Lucy minerals over it, and my skin looks perfect.</li>
    <li> I would like a little more matte finish, as my skin is very oily, but otherwise love it!</li>
    <li> Having used the bare mineral foundation I was excited to try this new product.  I have very dry skin and found this difficult to use. Maybe with more practice I would have gotten the proper effect but I could not get it quite right.  It seemed to cake on my skin.  I don&#x27;t believe it was really mean for mature skin that tends to be dry.</li>
