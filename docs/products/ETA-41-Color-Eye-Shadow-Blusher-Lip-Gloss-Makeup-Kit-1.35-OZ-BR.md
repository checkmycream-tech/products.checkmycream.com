    <li> I am a male, occasional cross dresser who doesn&#x27;t go out much so am no expert on this stuff.  The product arrived intact and I have used it a little.  All I can say is that it works for me.  Also have liquid foundation mascara and eye pencils.</li>
    <li> All of the items leave sparkly crap all over.  The case doesn&#x27;t stay together,  Would only purchase for small child and then I would have to seriously think about it.</li>
    <li> Beautiful colors, with a silky mineral feel.</li>
    <li> I Love this. It has everything I need blush, eye shadow, lipstick, foudation. They all coordinate each other. No more which makeup goes with what so I will not look like a clown, this works. Try you&#x27;ll love it.</li>
    <li> Cute little makeup kit. Picture appeared to be  larger then what it was. Very small.. could actually fit in my purse. Bought it for my 10 year old to play with and she loved it tho...</li>
    <li> 12 year old loves it.</li>
    <li> I bought two of these for two young girls who cannot get enough make up.  The toy make up is not gentle on the face and always causes a rash so I opted for adult make up.  Cute product for a good price.</li>
    <li> I love this kit! It fits in my purse, isn&#x27;t too bulky, and has great colors. I was not expecting the colors to be as vibrant as they are, but that is an added bonus. Great buy!</li>
    <li> This was a Christmas gift for my Granddaughter and she loves it.  She is teenager and is very particular about how she looks.  Very happy.</li>
    <li> I ordered two of these for my two granddaughters.  When they arrived the eyeshadows in one were completely crushed and all over everything.  I think this was due to the packaging which was just a box with no padding.  The colours are not as in the picture.  I thought I would get some nice pastels, they&#x27;re just little girls.  Instead, they are rather dark and muddy looking.  I will give the good one to the 8yo and find something more appropriate for the 5yo.</li>
    <li> Bought this as a gift but it was all smashed up so just kept for myself.  Was too hard to use in that state so ended up throwing away.  Better packaging should probably be considered.</li>
    <li> Great makeup kit for my makeup addict 4yo daughter. She loves all the color options. I love how everything is included.</li>
    <li> Great for daily travel, fits perfect in just about any purse.</li>
    <li> Better than expected.  I purchased for vacation, but now it&#x27;s my go to in the morning.  This is amazing, the colors to choose from are spot on for my olive compextion.  This would work well for light complextions as well.  It goes from cools to warms.  The lip gloss is okay, doesn&#x27;t stay, but the eye shawdow/blushes make up for the shortfall there.  I&#x27;m very happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> Item arrived early and in tact! I am so pleased!!! It is just what I was looking for and it will make a great addition to my makeup bag! I will be suggesting this item to friends.</li>
    <li> Younger daughter loved this</li>
    <li> I purchased this makeup kit for my little sister. It arrived in perfect condition. There are plenty of color options. The eye shadow colors are beautiful. This made the perfect gift</li>
    <li> This item is poorly made. The pigment is terrible. Very hard to work with. A waste of money.</li>
    <li> the entire bottom tray was broken up just want my money back</li>
    <li> It would have been nice if it hadn&#x27;t come all busted up when it arrived.</li>
