      <li>Just like when you have had too many relaxers on your hair already.</li>
      <li>I hesitated to buy this product because I&#x27;ve tried so many hair products that don&#x27;t work, and I did not want to have that experience again.</li>
      <li>I love this product.  </li>
      <li>This conditioner tames my stubborn tangles and helps me to more easily manage my hair before blow drying.</li>
      <li>There was a huge difference between using it with heat or steam vs without.  </li>
      <li>In essence, I think it has some kind of relaxer ingredient that chemically treated hairs don&#x27;t really need.</li>
      <li>A light floral scent.</li>
      <li>I had great results, but when I used it at home initially, I didn&#x27;t use heat</li>
      <li>this product is NOT sulfate and paraben free</li>
      <li>but the quality is worth the price!</li>
      <li>Right!</li>
      <li>Beats bakery and candy sweet scent in my hair.</li>
      <li>I can easily detangle during shower, and my ends became much softer.</li>
      <li>and I think they are pretty effective as far as retaining moisture and keeping hair defined.</li>
      <li>The best part for me is that a little goes a long way which helps to keep more of my bucks in MY pocket</li>
      <li>great for my dry very wavy hair</li>
      <li>Very pleased with product leaves hair soft and managable with refreshing fragrance also very shiny and soft to the touch</li>
      <li>Much to my surprise my hair really does love this conditioner and soakes it up.</li>
      <li>Cheaper than the stores and worth the wait for in the mail.</li>
      <li>It lasts  longer than most other conditioners and does a better job.</li>
      <li>She was right.</li>
      <li>I had to rinse it right away.</li>
      <li>I can list so many products that cost less and leave me hair feeling more hydrated and moisturized.  </li>
      <li>I really like the smell, the healthy ingredients and my curls are in much better condition vs using my other conditioner.</li>
      <li>I have naturally slightly wavy hair and could see this working exceptionally well on someone who has curly  or wavy hair.</li>
      <li>I bought this because I wanted a deep conditioning treatment, however it turned out that this was actually more of a protein treatment.  </li>
      <li>I originally bought a bottle of this in a local health food store when I needed something quick.</li>
      <li>I mostly love it because of its natural ingredients, I am trying to live overall a more natural life style, and the products fits it perfectly!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>My hair is colored, dry and tends to frizz, this conditioner made it more manageable.</li>
      <li>It gave my hair so much moisture and has sooo much slip leaving my hair super soft .</li>
      <li>It made my hair drier, and it broke like a chewy stick desintegrating fast.</li>
      <li>I really like Jane Carter hair products</li>
      <li>It smells like absolutely nothing in the bottle.</li>
      <li>, it is actually the first silicone free product that leaves my hair feeling really good, it really makes a difference when you apply heat to your hair when using this product, I applied my leave in and curling cream, sealed with oil, and let it air dry, my hair was soft, moisturized, bouncy, shiny, it has become my staple deep conditioner.  </li>
      <li>Used this as a conditioner and deep conditioner as I am curly girl friendly.</li>
      <li>Too grown for teenage sweet scents.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend it for course, curly, or kinky hair.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t get why there are so many products saturating the market that are so costly, don&#x27;t last long, and there are cheaper alternatives.  </li>
      <li>My hair is very soft and conditioned when I rinse this conditioner out.</li>
      <li>super silky on african american hair.</li>
      <li>Once I started using it in conjunction with other products in this collection , it seemed to bring out my natural curl more, which I have never scene before ( as long as I can remember my hair has always been heat treated to make it straight).&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>so I do use some natural remedies to help</li>
      <li>my hair does not feel quite as shiny, soft, and moisturized.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t make my ends look moisturized and alive.</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t use if you have sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>leaves my hair soft.</li>
      <li>I save an old bottle and put a little conditioner in it, water it down because it is so thick and it is perfect.</li>
      <li>As soon as I smeared it on my hair after shampooing, my hair became very light and smooth, and then the ugly happened.</li>
      <li>, what can I say, it left my hair very soft, moisturized</li>
      <li>I dont know whether this product would react differently if my hair was all natural, but I doubt I will re-purchase to find out.  </li>
      <li>but it leaves my hair soft, moist and it also defines my curls, big plus!</li>
      <li>I am currently transitioning from relaxed to natural hair</li>
      <li>Deep conditioner allowed my hair to go back to normal from the damage.</li>
      <li>, anyways I shampooed my hair with cream of nature detangling shampoo ( amazing by the way) divided my hair in sections and applied from roots to ends, used a plastic cap, under the hooded dryer for 20 mins, then 2 hrs to let it penetrate and cool down, sprayed some cold water, detangling was a breeze</li>
      <li>This makes my hair so much softer, shinier, and less tangled.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> did not soften hair after using moisturizing shampoo.  my daughter tried it and she does not have bad hair.  will not repurchase this  product for her or myself.</li>
    <li> I really like the smell, the healthy ingredients and my curls are in much better condition vs using my other conditioner. I also love Jane Carter&#x27;s Nourish and Shine.</li>
    <li> I actually use this conditioner as a co-wash and moisturizer for my TWA.  I have 4a hair and this in conjunction with the leave-in smells PHENOMINAL and adds great shine and moisture. My hair loves Jane Carter products! This is a great leave-in moisturizer.</li>
    <li> Damaged my hair and made it so DRY like a desert! Used this as a conditioner and deep conditioner as I am curly girl friendly. My hair broke off alot and tangled. Scalp itchy, and very dry. I don&#x27;t recommend for 4b hair. Went back to v05 moisture milks strawberry conditioner. That and Curly Kids Deep conditioner allowed my hair to go back to normal from the damage.</li>
    <li> I bought this product for my daughter&#x27;s hair. She has very tight African American curls. This product relaxes the curls just enough to look like I pressed or flat ironed her hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll be buying more.</li>
    <li> Jane Carter&#x27;s Nutrient Conditioner is excellent for softening and conditioning unruly curls, locs, and kinky hair. I&#x27;ve used this product for more than a year because I can count on it to restore softness after vigorous washing. This conditioner is especially helpful following a clarifying shampoo, vinegar rinse, or other concoctions that may cause hair to feel stripped of moisture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My tresses are restored to softness after applying this conditioner. I highly recommend it for course, curly, or kinky hair.</li>
    <li> I tried this conditioner over a year ago.  I didn&#x27;t think it moisturized my hair enough and tried several other products.  Well I&#x27;m back using this conditioner.  It works best after using a good shampoo and with heat or a steamer.  When my stylist used this on my hair, she used a steamer.  I had great results, but when I used it at home initially, I didn&#x27;t use heat, I just left it on my hair for about 10 min.  There was a huge difference between using it with heat or steam vs without.  I have 3c/4a hair that is very dry.  I have dry skin &amp; scalp so I do use some natural remedies to help but this conditioner is great for my hair.  Just keep in my that not every product will work for every person.</li>
    <li> This conditioner tames my stubborn tangles and helps me to more easily manage my hair before blow drying.</li>
    <li> Eh, I&#x27;ve tried so much better. I can list so many products that cost less and leave me hair feeling more hydrated and moisturized.  I don&#x27;t get why there are so many products saturating the market that are so costly, don&#x27;t last long, and there are cheaper alternatives.  I try everything.  I heard of jane carter and had to give this a try.  It did nothing for my hair.  Carol&#x27;s Daughter&#x27;s hair smoothies are significantly better.  Just saying...</li>
    <li> I love the result after using the Nutrient Replenishing Conditioner. My hair feels GREAT! Like the smell too.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I am currently transitioning from relaxed to natural hair and I am 8 months post relaxer.  I bought this because I wanted a deep conditioning treatment, however it turned out that this was actually more of a protein treatment.  I used it twice and both times I was not impressed.  It did not have a lot of slip and it left my hair feeling a little hard and dry, I guess that&#x27;s because of the protein, and it did nothing for my curls.  I prefer Organic Root Stimulator Hair Mayonaisse, it is also a protein treatment but it leaves my hair soft, moist and it also defines my curls, big plus! It&#x27;s also about half the price of this!  I dont know whether this product would react differently if my hair was all natural, but I doubt I will re-purchase to find out.  I gave what was left to my mom.  It does have a nice smell though.</li>
    <li> I am in love with this conditioner. I watched Jane Carter&#x27;s video discussing this conditioner. She said you only need a little. I was like, Yeah Right! I tested her advice out a bit I used a quarter size amount and applied it to my hair. She was right. I applied it every where and my hair bowed down to this conditioner. It smells like absolutely nothing in the bottle. I was okay with that, but in my hands, this stuff smells beautiful. A light floral scent. Beats bakery and candy sweet scent in my hair. Too grown for teenage sweet scents. It detangles like nothing.</li>
    <li> I Like this conditioner it is thick and feels like a little goes a long way. I have naturally slightly wavy hair and could see this working exceptionally well on someone who has curly  or wavy hair.</li>
    <li> I originally bought a bottle of this in a local health food store when I needed something quick. Much to my surprise my hair really does love this conditioner and soakes it up. I alternate conditioners and most of mine are very expensive, excluding this one. It&#x27;s a good deal and my hair feels great afterward. I have med-thick, wavy hair that gets frizzy without product.</li>
    <li> Love the conditioner. Makes hair manageable</li>
    <li> This has to be my number one conditioner . It gave my hair so much moisture and has sooo much slip leaving my hair super soft . The best part for me is that a little goes a long way which helps to keep more of my bucks in MY pocket lol .</li>
    <li> Cheaper than the stores and worth the wait for in the mail. This is one of the few products that works in my hair. A little goes a long way. I save an old bottle and put a little conditioner in it, water it down because it is so thick and it is perfect. It lasts  longer than most other conditioners and does a better job.</li>
    <li> Whenever I use this product at home or in the salon my head begins to itch severely. Don&#x27;t use if you have sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> Very pleased with product leaves hair soft and managable with refreshing fragrance also very shiny and soft to the touch</li>
    <li> I love Jane Carter products. I also use the leave-in conditioner. I use this in conjunction with Urbanbella shampoo and Redken deep conditioner. I shampoo, deep condition for about 30 minutes, rinse, then condition with JC conditioner. This makes my hair so much softer, shinier, and less tangled. I am a Black woman with a variation of hair types ranging from loose S-curls to tight spiral curls, and my hair loves this conditioner. Whether I am straightening my hair or wearing it curly, my hair always turns out better after using this conditioner. Also, it is probably JC working in conjunction with the other products that I use, but without it (I&#x27;ve run out before and just decided to only use the Redken DC) my hair does not feel quite as shiny, soft, and moisturized.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  I will purchase again.</li>
    <li> I hesitated to buy this product because I&#x27;ve tried so many hair products that don&#x27;t work, and I did not want to have that experience again. Well, I bought it and said: let me just use it once and see how my hair feels. As soon as I smeared it on my hair after shampooing, my hair became very light and smooth, and then the ugly happened. It began to break. Just like when you have had too many relaxers on your hair already. Yes, I have curly hair, that in normal conditions is shiny and thick. I have highlights, color, and a little bit of keratin treatment on my hair already, and as you can imagine I&#x27;m looking for the miracle treatment all the time. To my surprise, this is not it. It made my hair drier, and it broke like a chewy stick desintegrating fast. I had to rinse it right away. Needless to say, I took it back to the store and got my money back. In essence, I think it has some kind of relaxer ingredient that chemically treated hairs don&#x27;t really need. Silk products strengthen my hair, not break it as this one did. Don&#x27;t buy it if your hair is thin, dry, relaxed, brittle. It will make it worse. Products that have worked for my hair include the Silk brand and Shea Moisture, the hair lotion with coconut.</li>
    <li> I have tried a vast numbr of conditioners and this is the best. My hair is colored, dry and tends to frizz, this conditioner made it more manageable.For me it works better than conditioners twice it&#x27;s price.</li>
    <li> I use this in the mornings to redefine my curls - works wonderful.  However, don&#x27;t over use - can make hair a little stiff!</li>
    <li> My hair is 3A, and I am desperately trying to grow my hair. Co-washing has been helping me with this task, but recently I&#x27;ve noticed I can&#x27;t make my ends look moisturized and alive. This conditioner does that work! I can easily detangle during shower, and my ends became much softer. Can&#x27;t wait to try other Jane Carter products!</li>
    <li> Softens and detangles</li>
    <li> love love love it! super silky on african american hair. i always purchase it.</li>
    <li> Love this conditioner for my hair it has great slip for detangling and really good deep condition.</li>
    <li> The whole Jane Carter collection is just wonderful! I mostly love it because of its natural ingredients, I am trying to live overall a more natural life style, and the products fits it perfectly!&lt;br /&gt;I am of mixed race, half black half white, and trying to grow out my hair without doing &amp;#34;the big chop&amp;#34; after years of using chemicals. Once I started using it in conjunction with other products in this collection , it seemed to bring out my natural curl more, which I have never scene before ( as long as I can remember my hair has always been heat treated to make it straight).&lt;br /&gt;I do wish it was a little cheaper but the quality is worth the price!</li>
    <li> My hair is a mix of 3 b-3c curls, frizzy, with a mind of its own lol, I bought this at a pharmacy nearby and sat on my bathroom closet for two weeks, i was a little afraid to try it because i have tried natural hair products and they did nothing for my hair, anyways I shampooed my hair with cream of nature detangling shampoo ( amazing by the way) divided my hair in sections and applied from roots to ends, used a plastic cap, under the hooded dryer for 20 mins, then 2 hrs to let it penetrate and cool down, sprayed some cold water, detangling was a breeze, what can I say, it left my hair very soft, moisturized, it is actually the first silicone free product that leaves my hair feeling really good, it really makes a difference when you apply heat to your hair when using this product, I applied my leave in and curling cream, sealed with oil, and let it air dry, my hair was soft, moisturized, bouncy, shiny, it has become my staple deep conditioner.

    <li> Wonderful conditioner. leaves my hair soft.</li>
    <li> I really like Jane Carter hair products and I think they are pretty effective as far as retaining moisture and keeping hair defined. This conditioner works really great for me. I like to use it in the shower with my head covered with a conditioner cap for as long as possible. My hair is very soft and conditioned when I rinse this conditioner out. I don&#x27;t agree with the company when heat is suggest for better results.</li>
    <li> this product is NOT sulfate and paraben free</li>
    <li> great for my dry very wavy hair</li>
</ol>
