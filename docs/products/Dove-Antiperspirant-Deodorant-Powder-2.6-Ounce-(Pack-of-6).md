      <li>Doves baby powder scent does not add to my odor, it masks it and leaves me feeling clean throughout the day. :)</li>
      <li>It shipped pretty fast and arrived in great condition.</li>
      <li>The description and photo are accurate.</li>
      <li>Great deoderant, especially if you don&#x27;t require the clinical stuff.</li>

      <li>long time customer always looking for a good price.</li>
      <li>Kinda a little overpowering but great for those hot and sweaty days!</li>
      <li>- and maybe most importantly, this is the only stuff that doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin.</li>
      <li>I have even tried mens deodorant, far too many brands to even name.</li>
      <li>Works great on sensitive skin, and keeps you dry even on the hottest of these summer triple digit days.</li>
      <li>/&gt;So if you are looking for a simple, gentle, and effective Antiperspirant - then this is for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Guys</li>
      <li>It smells amazing and keeps my under arms dry!</li>
      <li>but when I ran out and just bought what ever was on sale, I can absolutely tell a difference!  </li>
      <li>Great deals and they last a long time.</li>
      <li>First of all, let me say that I do not wear cologne or other fragrances of any kind.</li>
      <li>Didn&#x27;t really notice when I was using it,</li>
      <li>I really like the scent of it this deodorant</li>
      <li>I was deployed and could not find the brand of deoderant that I used, found this item for a reasonable price.  </li>
      <li>I also like a simple, clean, scent and not some \\&quot;sporty\\&quot; or \\&quot;active\\&quot; scent.</li>
      <li>Highly recommended,</li>
      <li>so i really didn&#x27;t give soft underarms a thought.  </li>
      <li>You can never go wrong with dove, it&#x27;s smooth silky and smells good all day long.</li>
      <li>Well, not only is there great odor and wetness protection, but it does make underarms softer, feel less rough when shaving my underarms.  </li>
      <li>Keeps me from sweating and smells fresh all day long.</li>
      <li>Apparently I have sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>you have ever used a deodorant with a scent, to all the women out there, you know that certain deodorant scents can actually accentuate the perspiration and create an even harsher smell than your personal body odor alone.</li>
      <li>Leaves me dry the whole day long, I can wear other fragances once this is really smooth.&lt;br</li>

<li> , this deodorant might have to be reapplied during the day or you might want to try the secret active line, but chose a smell that will not react to your own odor in an odd way.&lt;br /&gt;If</li>
<li> Recently Walmart stopped selling this particular scent; I bought another called &amp;#34;Fresh,&amp;#34; but it&#x27;s not nearly as good.  </li>
<li> and  keeps you  dry  </li>
<li> Product performs well and keeps me dry.  </li>
<li> Sticks seem to last a long time even with an average of 9 applications per week.</li>
<li> Love this in the Powder, but not to crazy about the other scents.</li>
<li> Unlike gel deodorants, it doesn&#x27;t stay wet and sticky, and unlike other solid deodorants, it doesn&#x27;t get &amp;#34;cakey.&amp;#34;  </li>
<li> I learned this the hard way when I developed a cyst under my arm.</li>
<li> On a trip a few years ago, I forgot my flavor and borrowed my wife&#x27;s Dove &amp;#34;POWDER&amp;#34; solid.</li>
<li> Others they&#x27;ve tried caused irrittation (even other Dove products).</li>
<li> A little transfer is to be expected.</li>
<li> Only slight downside is that it leaves behind a white residue on black shirts</li>
<li> I have also used at least 20+ different kinds/brands of feminine deodorant.</li>
<li> only bad point is that you have to be carefull not to get white marks in your shirt :</li>
<li> Less expensive bought through Amazon than at the supermarket.</li>

    <li> good deal - fast ship via prime</li>
    <li> No sweat protection at all!</li>
    <li> This is all I use its perfect and I like bulk thx guys</li>
    <li> so i really didn&#x27;t give soft underarms a thought.  Really just make sure the antiperspirant &amp; deod part work, right?  Well, not only is there great odor and wetness protection, but it does make underarms softer, feel less rough when shaving my underarms.  Didn&#x27;t really notice when I was using it, but when I ran out and just bought what ever was on sale, I can absolutely tell a difference!  So now I bought a 6 pack of deod so I should be good to go for awhile</li>
    <li> First of all, let me say that I do not wear cologne or other fragrances of any kind. I do use antiperspirant / deodorant. I also like a simple, clean, scent and not some \\&quot;sporty\\&quot; or \\&quot;active\\&quot; scent. This fits the bill perfectly ...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also - and maybe most importantly, this is the only stuff that doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin. I have tried all kinds of AP/D and they all irritate me over time. I have used this stuff for years now and it is the only one that I have found that works and doesn&#x27;t irritate me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So if you are looking for a simple, gentle, and effective Antiperspirant - then this is for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Guys and gals.</li>
    <li> Suuuuuper. Leaves me dry the whole day long, I can wear other fragances once this is really smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only bad point is that you have to be carefull not to get white marks in your shirt :-(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stil recommend a lot</li>
    <li> I still have two left. Has been a while but will order again. Great deals and they last a long time.</li>
    <li> I love this dove deodorant. It smells amazing and keeps my under arms dry! I also love that amazon sells it in bulk as well.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for YEARS now and I will use nothing else. Apparently I have sensitive skin. I learned this the hard way when I developed a cyst under my arm. I have been using Dove (Powder scent) for several years and I have never had a problem. Some of the more powerful scents used to make me itch, but this doesn&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> The only deodorant my finicky wife and daughter will use. Others they&#x27;ve tried caused irrittation (even other Dove products). This one works great.</li>
    <li> On a trip a few years ago, I forgot my flavor and borrowed my wife&#x27;s Dove &amp;#34;POWDER&amp;#34; solid. I loved it and it&#x27;s handy to use the same as your mate so you can buy in bulk and be able to share if someone forgets it. Excellent sweat stopping power with a light baby powder scent. Sticks seem to last a long time even with an average of 9 applications per week. Only slight downside is that it leaves behind a white residue on black shirts but, hey, it&#x27;s a solid stick of white chemicals you&#x27;re rubbing on your skin. A little transfer is to be expected.</li>
    <li> You can never go wrong with dove, it&#x27;s smooth silky and smells good all day long. Will order again and again.</li>
    <li> A great product.  I save several dollars buying the multi pack.  Product performs well and keeps me dry.  Highly recommended,</li>
    <li> Every girl loves  Doves  product. This  deodorant  is  great  and  keeps you  dry  all  day. Plus  it  does  not  stain your  clothes.</li>
    <li> This has been my favorite deodorant/anti-perspirant for years.  Recently Walmart stopped selling this particular scent; I bought another called &amp;#34;Fresh,&amp;#34; but it&#x27;s not nearly as good.  I haven&#x27;t had a problem with it leaving marks on my clothes; it is, after all, advertised as &amp;#34;invisible.&amp;#34;  Unlike gel deodorants, it doesn&#x27;t stay wet and sticky, and unlike other solid deodorants, it doesn&#x27;t get &amp;#34;cakey.&amp;#34;  I&#x27;ll use this for life.</li>
    <li> Excellent  product. Works well. Smells great and can&#x27;t beat the price</li>
    <li> Great purchase for the price</li>
    <li> Kinda a little overpowering but great for those hot and sweaty days! Good deal price wise as well!</li>
    <li> Great product.  Shipped on time.  Woks well and causes no skin irritation.  It does contain Aluminum Zirconium Tetracholorhydrex (15.2%) anti-persperant.  Less expensive bought through Amazon than at the supermarket.</li>
    <li> This product was purchased for a person that enjoys having on the Dove deodorant. The shipment arrived on time. The description and photo are accurate.</li>
    <li> Got this for a really excellent price. Always happy with Dove and the powder scent is light and pleasant.</li>
    <li> I really like the scent of it this deodorant&lt;br /&gt;Besides, it&#x27;s a great product DOVE does respect the complection of your skin !</li>
    <li> always love dove deodorant, works great the smell is very fresh and inviting. long time customer always looking for a good price.</li>
    <li> 18/6 literally means 2$ per deodorant. STEAL!</li>
    <li> This is a great deodorant. There are 3 of us using it in our house and no one complains.</li>
    <li> Love this in the Powder, but not to crazy about the other scents. Works great on sensitive skin, and keeps you dry even on the hottest of these summer triple digit days.</li>
    <li> Great deoderant, especially if you don&#x27;t require the clinical stuff. Keeps me from sweating and smells fresh all day long.</li>
    <li> I was deployed and could not find the brand of deoderant that I used, found this item for a reasonable price.  It shipped pretty fast and arrived in great condition.</li>
    <li> I have tried EVERY kind of deodorant, I perspire, just like every one else, maybe even more than some. I have even tried mens deodorant, far too many brands to even name. I have also used at least 20+ different kinds/brands of feminine deodorant. This deodorant is the only one that does not leave my arms feeling chapped, and still fights off odor. Now I mus admit, if you sweat more than most people, and you do a lot of strenuous activities, this deodorant might have to be reapplied during the day or you might want to try the secret active line, but chose a smell that will not react to your own odor in an odd way.&lt;br /&gt;If you have ever used a deodorant with a scent, to all the women out there, you know that certain deodorant scents can actually accentuate the perspiration and create an even harsher smell than your personal body odor alone. Doves baby powder scent does not add to my odor, it masks it and leaves me feeling clean throughout the day. :)</li>
    <li> When I purchased this product the description said it was a pack of 6. I only got 1 stick. Paid $13 for 1 stick of deodorant...rip off.</li>
