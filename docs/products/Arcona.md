### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>It smells absolutely delicious, and it cleanses &amp; tones my skin, and feels so luxurious.....</li>
      <li>Best makeup remover and takes off eye makeup too!</li>
      <li>best product.</li>
      <li>Great product!</li>
      <li>However, there have been some reports of allergic reactions to benzyl alcohol in skincare products (see the Wikipedia page for benzyl alcohol), so it is best to do a patch test if you have known skin allergies.  </li>
      <li>So it&#x27;s a wonderful &amp;#34;second pass&amp;#34; makeup remover.  </li>
      <li>It smells wonderful.  </li>
      <li>The best toner I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
      <li>It smells great!</li>
      <li>It does a great job keeping my face moisturized without stripping it of all the oil.  </li>
      <li>The shipping on this was great</li>
      <li>are a very handy way to go and are great on trail to freshen up and remove the sunscreen and grime from the day.</li>

      <li>Good price for prime shipping also.</li>
      <li>the stuff is good.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve loved the smell and feel of it</li>
      <li>This is really good.</li>
      <li>So I went to Amazon&#x27;s best selling toner list and tried the Rose Petal Witch Hazel Toner (alcohol free).</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a good toner with nice ingredients</li>
      <li>I used it 3 times and already see a difference in my skin...feels healthy and smooth!!!</li>
      <li>Otherwise love it!</li>
      <li>Even better, I can get a 12 ounce bottle (3x the size of Arcona&#x27;s) for $10!</li>
      <li>and I liked it a lot.  </li>
      <li>Honestly the reason I tried it is because it came in a Birchbox.  </li>
      <li>Try at your own risk...</li>
      <li>Excellent product, I have severe acne and this has helped clear it up.  </li>
      <li>Awesome product except the plastic grey top always cracks!</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s certainly effective; it removes lip stain, eyeshadow, and waterproof mascara easily.  </li>
      <li>I also want to say that I put a spray bottle top on this</li>
      <li>Because of the issues surrounding getting it in your eyes, it may be better not to use it as a cleanser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It smells a bit better than the cleansing bar too.  </li>
      <li>Ok, I guess I&#x27;ll give it a go.  </li>
      <li>This toner&#x27;s better than Dr Haushka (sp)</li>
      <li>this is my favorite toner.  </li>
      <li>The scent is more pronounced in the pads than in the bottle of toner.</li>
      <li>I also checked out the company and decided to try the Raspberry Cleanser Bar, which I absolutely love.</li>
      <li>I love using this toner.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a magic product.  </li>
      <li>This is a non-drying toner that I love using in the morning</li>
      <li>The ARCONA Cranberry Toner is fantastic!</li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>but the reason I felt compelled to write a review is because I found a product even better.</li>
      <li>I use this every day and I  love it and have been using it for years.</li>
      <li>When I have shaken the bottle before, it seems to leak more.  </li>
      <li>and like it much better now.</li>
      <li>LOVE, love this product.</li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>My face feels very clean but not all</li>
      <li>I first tried this product as a sample and absolutely LOVED the way it made my skin feel and glow.</li>
      <li>, it is pretty strong, but still pleasant.  </li>
      <li>it doesn&#x27;t dry my face, which is wonderful.</li>
      <li>The smell is incredible and the formula cleanses, tones, and moisturizes and leaves my super sensitive skin soft and smooth and happy.  </li>
      <li>the end, as far as the product claims go, I&#x27;d say this is an excellent toner, a decent makeup remover (for non-eye areas), and it has some hydration value.  </li>
      <li>I bought this stuff bc of a youtube review but at the end she did say arcona gave her the products for free.</li>
      <li>The scent has never bothered me, as it has others--it is light, and fruity, and perhaps not for everyone, but I like it .</li>
      <li>/&gt;Disclaimer: Received a free full-sized bottle of toner from Truth in Aging for evaluation purposes.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Disclaimer: Received a free full-sized bottle of toner from Truth in Aging for evaluation purposes.om the Arcona</li>
      <li>Also good for sensitive skin</li>
      <li>This is like some magical tonic that wants to gently love your face.  </li>
      <li>I was so excited to get this product.</li>
      <li>I first bought it in a spa in Ojai California and fell in love with it.  </li>
      <li>Clean and fruity.</li>
      <li>Most of the toners I&#x27;ve tried in the past have been alcohol-based and have been quite drying, so I was happy to get the chance to try a toner that is not alcohol-based.  </li>
      <li>I actually feel like my skin has been fairly well moisturized while I&#x27;ve been using this.  </li>
      <li>I had gotten this product as a sample and had ordered the full size version, so I did like this toner.</li>
      <li>It didn&#x27;t dry out my face or sting, and the smell was pleasant not medicinal.  </li>
      <li>After using this twice a day for a few weeks, I&#x27;m happy with this as a toner.  </li>
      <li>It is pricey, but worth it.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s a wonderfully refreshing and natural product.</li>
      <li>Honestly, I&#x27;d say the manufacturer is making a few too many claims about the benefits of this product, and they may want to rethink that.  </li>
      <li>I felt like I could use the toner and not require moisturizer, which is rare.  </li>
      <li>Worth the money.</li>
      <li>have combination and sensitive skin, and this surprisingly didnt break me out, it is light, gentle, and didnot dry my skin&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Actually I usually only use this at night, after using a Doc cloth to wash off my makeup, so if there is even the slightest bit of residue left on my skin, the cranberry toner removes it at the same time it tones, leaving the perfect canvas for my serums &amp; creams!</li>
      <li>I love the cranberry smell, color, and the bottle as well, i&#x27;d definitely buy this product again!</li>
      <li>hmmm it now has a pretty sheen.  </li>
      <li>I felt like after using the Arcona toner for several years, that I wasn&#x27;t as in love with the product as when I first tried it.</li>
      <li>The antioxidants (from cranberry extract, white tea extract, grapeseed extract, and vitamin E) may provide anti-aging benefits although many sources suggest using a sunscreen in addition to antioxidants.  </li>
      <li>Benzyl alcohol can be found in many plants and essential oils (including jasmine).  </li>

      <li>The first thing I noticed is the scent.  </li>
      <li>It is extremely hydrating and can be used as a cleanser all on its own.</li>
      <li>Even after washing my face this gets so much more out of my pores and it doesn&#x27;t dry your face.</li>
      <li>I still really like the product but find that it leaves my skin feeling a bit sticky.</li>
      <li>I like this whole line of products.</li>
      <li>really like the way this product smells</li>
      <li>It left me feeling clean AND moisturized.  </li>
      <li>Then after you use it your skin feels oddly tight (not in a good way) and that there is a film residue type feeling left over.</li>
      <li>Love it just dislike the fact it came half way.</li>
      <li>I also think the product tries to do too much by claiming you can cleanse your face and tone and protect your skin from free radicals.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s going to, and I miss the textured surface of the Triad Pads that offers some exfoliation, but this is still an amazing product.  </li>
      <li>Other than that I had no problem with it my skin reacts to it fine.</li>
      <li>Rice milk is likely to be all right for people with gluten intolerances/allergies since rice is gluten-free.  </li>
      <li>Rice milk is likely to be all right for people with gluten intolerances/allergies since rice is gluten-free.  </li>
      <li>Just as a note--I prefer the toner on its own to the pads--yes the container which includes pads is convenient, but I feel that the pads are oversaturated (I believe another reviewer mentioned this as well) and messier (despite being of good quality) than my regular cotton squares :(</li>
      <li>My problem skin has been clear ever since I started using this product line.</li>
      <li>(Also, something oily from this toner remained in my eye nearly all night.  </li>
      <li>Not only is it refreshing, you really feel as if you&#x27;ve cleansed your skin--and it feels that way for at least an hour afterward.</li>
      <li>This is a little pricey, but well worth it!</li>
      <li>First, I&#x27;ll use a cleanser and then pat my face dry with a towel.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Awesome product except the plastic grey top always cracks! Otherwise love it!</li>
    <li> I use this every day and I  love it and have been using it for years.</li>
    <li> Nothing bad to say. Great product! My problem skin has been clear ever since I started using this product line.</li>
    <li> I use this to remove my make-up. This is really good. I don&#x27;t get any break-outs (I usually get them with some other make-up remover products)and it doesn&#x27;t dry my face, which is wonderful. Love it.</li>
    <li> The ARCONA Cranberry Toner is fantastic! I use it daily to remove makeup in the evening and sometimes throughout the day as a skin pick-me-up after a workout. It is extremely hydrating and can be used as a cleanser all on its own. The [[ASIN:B000Z61TFO ARCONA Triad Pads, Refresh 45 pads (100 ml)]] are a very handy way to go and are great on trail to freshen up and remove the sunscreen and grime from the day.</li>
    <li> This is a little pricey, but well worth it! It smells absolutely delicious, and it cleanses &amp; tones my skin, and feels so luxurious.....it&#x27;s something I actually look forward to using each day. Actually I usually only use this at night, after using a Doc cloth to wash off my makeup, so if there is even the slightest bit of residue left on my skin, the cranberry toner removes it at the same time it tones, leaving the perfect canvas for my serums &amp; creams! Treat yourself to this stuff, or to the Arcona Triad pads (non-woven cotton pads pre-soaked in this cranberry toner), I can almost guarantee you will never go back to another toner!</li>
    <li> I have used the Arcona Cranberry Toner for several years. I&#x27;ve loved the smell and feel of it but the reason I felt compelled to write a review is because I found a product even better. I felt like after using the Arcona toner for several years, that I wasn&#x27;t as in love with the product as when I first tried it. So I went to Amazon&#x27;s best selling toner list and tried the Rose Petal Witch Hazel Toner (alcohol free). It&#x27;s amazing! Even better, I can get a 12 ounce bottle (3x the size of Arcona&#x27;s) for $10! Sorry Arcona!  I&#x27;m moving on!!</li>
    <li> I really like this product so far, it doesn&#x27;t feel like other toners I&#x27;ve used and being that I have sensitive skin it&#x27;s hard for me to use toner really.  The shipping on this was great, I got it in 3 days.  It smells a bit better than the cleansing bar too.  I also want to say that I put a spray bottle top on this so I can use it as a spritzer and then use the cotton pad to spread it evenly because you use less.  Also if you are curious about what people really are saying about it before you spend the money I suggest looking on youtube because that&#x27;s actually how I even heard about it.</li>
    <li> This is a non-drying toner that I love using in the morning so I can smell it on my face everyday.</li>
    <li> Best makeup remover and takes off eye makeup too! Good price for prime shipping also. Also good for sensitive skin</li>
    <li> best product. totally remove any residue of make up after using a face wash or face cleanser.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in my mid-30s and I have combination skin (oily T-zone, dry cheeks).  Most of the toners I&#x27;ve tried in the past have been alcohol-based and have been quite drying, so I was happy to get the chance to try a toner that is not alcohol-based.  After using this twice a day for a few weeks, I&#x27;m happy with this as a toner.  First, I&#x27;ll use a cleanser and then pat my face dry with a towel.  Following that, I&#x27;ll dispense this toner onto a disposable cotton pad (usually I press the dispenser top twice) and apply it to my face and neck.  It takes a little longer to dry than an alcohol-based toner, which is understandable.  While I wait for it to dry, I do something else (like apply a hair treatment) so I&#x27;m not wasting time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do feel a tightening effect when I use this, which may be due to the witch hazel and/or the cranberry extract, since both have astringent effects (shrinking pores, tightening tissues).  I find that this dries without leaving a residue.  After it has dried, I then continue with my skincare routine, which varies based on time of day.  Thus far, this toner has been compatible with all the serums, moisturizers, and liquid foundation products I currently use.  I would say that the oil level of my skin is approximately the same using this versus an alcohol-based toner.  It is not causing my skin to break out, which is nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is definitely less drying than alcohol-based toners, so if you have sensitive skin and find other toners and/or astringents too harsh, you might really like this.  I am pleased that it does not contain any artificial fragrances or dyes; the only preservatives are vitamin E, essential oils, citric acid, and benzyl alcohol (present only in very small amounts).  Benzyl alcohol can be found in many plants and essential oils (including jasmine).  However, there have been some reports of allergic reactions to benzyl alcohol in skincare products (see the Wikipedia page for benzyl alcohol), so it is best to do a patch test if you have known skin allergies.  I did not have a reaction even after extended use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like the way this product smells but I&#x27;ve long been a fan of fruity-scented skincare products.  The scent of this one lingers a bit longer than the scents of toners/astringents I&#x27;ve used in the past, but since I like the scent, I&#x27;m fine with that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product makes some other claims that I&#x27;d like to address now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, it&#x27;s advertised as a makeup remover.  I&#x27;ve tried using it as a makeup remover and it&#x27;s certainly effective; it removes lip stain, eyeshadow, and waterproof mascara easily.  I also noticed that it removed traces of leftover liquid foundation that remained after cleansing with another product.  So it&#x27;s a wonderful &amp;#34;second pass&amp;#34; makeup remover.  However, I&#x27;d like to offer a caution: if this gets in your eye, it hurts!  (Also, something oily from this toner remained in my eye nearly all night.  So this should perhaps not be used as an eye makeup remover.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second, it&#x27;s advertised as having cleansing properties.  This product does not have any detergents or surfactants and it neither foams nor lathers.  Because of the issues surrounding getting it in your eyes, it may be better not to use it as a cleanser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Third, it&#x27;s advertised as hydrating skin.  I actually feel like my skin has been fairly well moisturized while I&#x27;ve been using this.  I have been using other moisturizers, as well, though.  It&#x27;s certainly not drying, at any rate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the end, as far as the product claims go, I&#x27;d say this is an excellent toner, a decent makeup remover (for non-eye areas), and it has some hydration value.  Honestly, I&#x27;d say the manufacturer is making a few too many claims about the benefits of this product, and they may want to rethink that.  However, that being said, I like the product enough as a toner to continue using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Amazon ingredients list is not complete, so here is the list from the Arcona website:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Distilled Water, Witch Hazel Extract, Rice Milk, Sodium Lactate, Cranberry Fruit Extract, White Tea Extract, Grapeseed Extract, Vitamin E, Citric Acid, Benzyl Alcohol, Essential Oils&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The rice milk may help absorb some oil as rice powder is commonly used for this purpose and only the rice powder/flour would remain on the skin after the water evaporates.  Rice milk is likely to be all right for people with gluten intolerances/allergies since rice is gluten-free.  The antioxidants (from cranberry extract, white tea extract, grapeseed extract, and vitamin E) may provide anti-aging benefits although many sources suggest using a sunscreen in addition to antioxidants.  In particular, the grapeseed extract contains an alpha-hydroxy acid (malic acid), which should always be used with sunscreens; however, this compound is going to be present in only small amounts in this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer: Received a free full-sized bottle of toner from Truth in Aging for evaluation purposes.om the Arcona website:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Distilled Water, Witch Hazel Extract, Rice Milk, Sodium Lactate, Cranberry Fruit Extract, White Tea Extract, Grapeseed Extract, Vitamin E, Citric Acid, Benzyl Alcohol, Essential Oils&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The rice milk may help absorb some oil as rice powder is commonly used for this purpose and only the rice powder/flour would remain on the skin after the water evaporates.

    <li> I received it damaged in the mail because it had not been packaged properly.  I had gotten this product as a sample and had ordered the full size version, so I did like this toner.</li>
    <li> This toner&#x27;s better than Dr Haushka (sp) but it comes in a flimsy plastic bottle. It&#x27;s a good toner with nice ingredients but I didnt find it that moisturizing. Maybe I got a bad batch. I switched to L&#x27;UVALLA bitter orange toner because it also contains natural ingredient and it&#x27;s packaged in glass. 3.75 stars&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: I gave this another try and like it much better now. Company switched to less flimsy bottle. But still plastic. Grrr</li>
    <li> I bought this stuff bc of a youtube review but at the end she did say arcona gave her the products for free. Now I know why she told people to buy this and it wasnt bc the stuff is good. I think this product is trying to do to much and maybe thats why it falls so flat. It says its a wash, a makeup remover, toner and moisturizer in one. In fact it really just half-asses all of those jobs, except maybe the makeup remover (not for eyes though it would be too harsh). Then after you use it your skin feels oddly tight (not in a good way) and that there is a film residue type feeling left over. Its not a good moisture type film but a like synthetic residue. Not a good feeling at all!! Try at your own risk...</li>
    <li> this is my favorite toner.  I first bought it in a spa in Ojai California and fell in love with it.  It smells wonderful.  Clean and fruity.</li>
    <li> The best toner I&#x27;ve ever used. I hardly ever have breakouts after using this product</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not one to write reviews personally because i&#x27;m lazy. I was so excited to get this product. When I got it I was kinda disappointed because the bottle was half way used. Other than that I had no problem with it my skin reacts to it fine. It smells great! Love it just dislike the fact it came half way.</li>
    <li> LOVE, love this product. Deep cleanses yet does not strip natural oils!</li>
    <li> I am a longtime fan of Arcona&#x27;s Triad Pads, which are saturated with this toner.  The bottle of toner costs the same as a jar of 30 pads, so I thought I might save some money if the bottle lasts longer....I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s going to, and I miss the textured surface of the Triad Pads that offers some exfoliation, but this is still an amazing product.  The smell is incredible and the formula cleanses, tones, and moisturizes and leaves my super sensitive skin soft and smooth and happy.  I have never found any other toner that even comes close to this.</li>
    <li> The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because my bottle leaks a little in my medicine cabinet.  I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;m supposed to shake the bottle because there is a white milky residue on the bottom.  When I have shaken the bottle before, it seems to leak more.  Overall, I like the smell of the product, it is pretty strong, but still pleasant.  It does a great job keeping my face moisturized without stripping it of all the oil.  I use it in the AM and follow up with my SPF moisturizer. I think I would order this product again.</li>
    <li> Love it. My face feels very clean but not all dried out. I like this whole line of products. Definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> I used it 3 times and already see a difference in my skin...feels healthy and smooth!!! The only complaint I have is that the pump is not working, the top is broken and makes a mess to get it out!!</li>
    <li> I first tried this product as a sample and absolutely LOVED the way it made my skin feel and glow. I bought the full-size immediately after the sample was empty. I still really like the product but find that it leaves my skin feeling a bit sticky. I also think the product tries to do too much by claiming you can cleanse your face and tone and protect your skin from free radicals.</li>
    <li> Got this product in my Birchbox initially and now I can&#x27;t go a day without it.  I buy it from both Amazon and Birchbox depending on the shipping costs.  I use it for makeup removal and toning.  It&#x27;s a magic product.  The only drawback?  The bottle leaks.  It happens on every bottle so it&#x27;s a design flaw in the pump.  It&#x27;s a bummer as it&#x27;s expensive and I lose probably 15% -20% of the bottle on my bathroom counter.</li>
    <li> I love using this toner. This is my second bottle.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a wonderfully refreshing and natural product. Worth the money.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t normally use toner, not sure why, but I got a sample of this toner in my Goodebox and I liked it a lot.  It didn&#x27;t dry out my face or sting, and the smell was pleasant not medicinal.  I felt like I could use the toner and not require moisturizer, which is rare.  I also checked out the company and decided to try the Raspberry Cleanser Bar, which I absolutely love.</li>
    <li> I had a facial at spa gregories (sumwer near san diego), and the aesthetician recommended me this product, so i gave it a try.&lt;br /&gt;I have combination and sensitive skin, and this surprisingly didnt break me out, it is light, gentle, and didnot dry my skin&lt;br /&gt;I use this at morning and b4 i go to sleep, it smoothed my forehead too, coz i have tiny bumps on that part, and i noticed it&lt;br /&gt;Only on my second use of ths product. I love the cranberry smell, color, and the bottle as well, i&#x27;d definitely buy this product again!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m ADDICTED to this toner. Not only is it refreshing, you really feel as if you&#x27;ve cleansed your skin--and it feels that way for at least an hour afterward. The scent is more pronounced in the pads than in the bottle of toner. The scent has never bothered me, as it has others--it is light, and fruity, and perhaps not for everyone, but I like it . And the toner itself? Well, it feels good--good consistency. It is pricey, but worth it. I&#x27;ve used a number of toners over the years, and this is one of the few that goes above and beyond. You can even use it to remove makeup!&lt;br /&gt;If you are thinking about trying this toner, do. I coveted it for over a year (didn&#x27;t want to spend that much on an unknown product), and received a sample through a different source. Haven&#x27;t used anything else since. It is one of those products that daily lifts your spirits and becomes part of your permanent rotation. Just as a note--I prefer the toner on its own to the pads--yes the container which includes pads is convenient, but I feel that the pads are oversaturated (I believe another reviewer mentioned this as well) and messier (despite being of good quality) than my regular cotton squares :(</li>
    <li> I was a little skeptical of this product because it has the word &amp;#34;toner&amp;#34; in it.  I remember toner from my teenage years when we used Seabreeze.  It was like turpentine for your face.  Honestly the reason I tried it is because it came in a Birchbox.  The first thing I noticed is the scent.  It actually smells like cranberries-not cranberry fragrance but actual cranberries.  Ok, I guess I&#x27;ll give it a go.  Shake before using...hmmm it now has a pretty sheen.  Apply to cotton round..and to face.  Glorious.  Yes, glorious.  It left me feeling clean AND moisturized.  This is not the toner of days past.  This is like some magical tonic that wants to gently love your face.  So let it.</li>
    <li> Excellent product, I have severe acne and this has helped clear it up.  Even after washing my face this gets so much more out of my pores and it doesn&#x27;t dry your face.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t see any difference between this expensive product and any other toner I ever used.  Very disappointed.</li>
