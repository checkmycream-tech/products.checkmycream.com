      <li>Most of the scales and redness is gone!!</li>
      <li>This is a light-feeling but very effective moisturizer that is to be applied sparingly to damp skin.</li>
      <li>I am so pleased that I bought 2 3-packs and will be sending a 3-pack to my best friend who has ezcema.</li>
      <li>It does not leave a greasy coating and lasts a fair amount of time.  </li>
      <li>is really good</li>
      <li>The price was fair and the product got to me in a couple of days.</li>
      <li>I can even remember the star stickers she would put on my lotion bottle every time I did a good job.</li>
      <li>Good moisterizer....</li>
      <li>health wise, and the products that aided in preventing and controlling itchiness, irritation and inflammation no longer do or have been discontinued :|</li>
      <li>but this stuff is the perfect consistency and absorbs quickly.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s works great without being greasy :)</li>

      <li>You guys can make up your own minds though.</li>
      <li>Not the greasy kind.  </li>
      <li>I break out whenever I use any kind of creams...</li>
      <li>Anyway this stuff works and has never cause any kind of breakout.</li>
      <li>You&#x27;d sell a zillion more units and life would be much easier for those of us who struggle to find your excellent product!!</li>
      <li>Anyways, the problem with most effective moisturizers is that they are oil based and tend to inflame acne.     </li>
      <li>Love, love, love!</li>
      <li>Boy, was I happy ;)</li>
      <li>I love this stuff as face cream.  </li>
      <li>which has so many benefits.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I have rosacea and my face is irritated by most lotions.</li>
      <li>better than most.  </li>
      <li>I need to order more but don&#x27;t think that the products is still for sale.  </li>
      <li>If you like a more creamy consistency try the face formulation.</li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>So glad I found it on-line</li>
      <li>I have been using this product for many years and absolutely love it.</li>
      <li>but you&#x27;ll have to apply more often .</li>
      <li>I love it and could not find it in stores anymore so ordered on-line.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m allergic to lotions with smell and most oils.  </li>
      <li>Most people are suprised when they learn my age.  </li>
      <li>This is one of the best moisturizers I have used recently.</li>
      <li>i have used this product for many yrs -</li>
      <li>It did not do everything I needed it to do, but for over the counter products, there isn&#x27;t much better.</li>
      <li>Most hand lotions manage to make my face break out--I guess when I touch my face after applying them.  </li>
      <li>I am allergic to many lotions and perfumes.  </li>
      <li>It was a favorite of my mother&#x27;s year ago, and I maintain the tradition to this day.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this stuff for twenty years, initially on the recommendation of a dermatologist, and it&#x27;s the best moisturizer I&#x27;ve ever tried.</li>
      <li>I love this product.  </li>
      <li>It is my favorite face cream.  </li>
      <li>it was best treatment for dry skin after menopause.  </li>
      <li>Was pleased with the price and delivery was very quick.</li>
      <li>goes on easy absorbs fast.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Really, if you have sensitive skin this is the best lotion for you.  </li>
      <li>The lotion is light, smooths on easily and does not feel greasy on one&#x27;s skin.  </li>
      <li>Buying through Amazon has made it more affordable and my order are filled quickly.</li>
      <li>It is light and thirst quenching for the skin.  </li>
      <li>It is light, non-greasy, and has no smell.  </li>
      <li>The best lotion that I have found for winter dried hands and face.  </li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t know why, since it&#x27;s light, clean, fragrance-free and one of the gentlest things you can put on your skin.</li>
      <li>probably the cream would work better on dry hands but this lotion feels good when applied on legs and body</li>
      <li>I originally bought this lotion for my face.  </li>
      <li>It is also a great treatment for minor sunburn or windburn!  </li>
      <li>so much I special order it since it no longer appears on the shelves of the stores where I shop.</li>
      <li>From a physician&#x27;s perspective this is a superior product that actually does what the advertisements declare.  </li>
      <li>Complex 15 lotion is without a doubt the BEST I have ever used.  </li>
      <li>Was very happy to find complex 15 online.</li>
      <li>I began using it as a teenager due to oily skin and this was great, so I&#x27;ve been using it ever since.  </li>
      <li>It absorbs into the skin quickly and does not stain clothing or leave a film on the skin.  </li>
      <li>I,ve used Complex 15 for many years and was extremley happy to find it so readilly avaliable on Amazon.</li>
      <li>It absorbs quickly and never feels greasy.</li>
      <li>This product is absorbed quickly and does what it purports to do.  </li>
      <li>I also have very sensitive skin and can&#x27;t use most products.</li>
      <li>It is especially  effective in treating dry skin in the winter when the humidity is low.  </li>
      <li>Store manager had no explanation why they can&#x27;t keep such a popular product stocked.  </li>
      <li>I have never experienced a moisturizer this awesome!</li>
      <li>so I figured it&#x27;d be worth it to try this product.  </li>
      <li>(I moisturize head to foot and when i get finished with my legs, the lotion has already absorbed on my arms)&lt;br</li>
      <li>I have no plans to purchase this product again, but I believe it&#x27;s a better moisturizing lotion than the ones available at local stores.    </li>
      <li>I would recommend this to anyone who wants a face moisturizer that is light, absorbs right away, does not cause breakouts, and never feels greasy.</li>
      <li>It is not a fancy or particularly attractive bottle like other moisturizers but it really does the job.  </li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t cause me to breakout and gives just the right amount of moisture.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This was merely a refill of a long-used product.  It doesn&#x27;t cause an allergic reaction as so many other products do,</li>
    <li> nohting wrong with this. no stinky smell, no heavy greasy feel. goes on easy absorbs fast.&lt;br /&gt;price is really good</li>
    <li> I have rosacea and my face is irritated by most lotions. This lotion does not irritate or exacerbate my rosacea.  I wish it had some sunscreen.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for at least 20 years, mainly on my face.  It&#x27;s hard to find at local pharmacies (which I&#x27;m stumped as to why), but I can feel it moisturizing without a greasy or slippery feel.  The few times I&#x27;ve run out or forgotten it when I travel I&#x27;ve never liked the way any other lotion feels on my face.  I began using it as a teenager due to oily skin and this was great, so I&#x27;ve been using it ever since.  Based on all the other moisturizers now out there, it&#x27;s cost is no longer out of range.  I would recommend this to anyone who wants a face moisturizer that is light, absorbs right away, does not cause breakouts, and never feels greasy.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this stuff for twenty years, initially on the recommendation of a dermatologist, and it&#x27;s the best moisturizer I&#x27;ve ever tried. It really isn&#x27;t at all greasy, and it absorbs quickly. I usually use it all over after a shower; Complex 15 sells a version specifically for the face, but I use this on my cheeks and around the eyes, too, with no problems. And I like that it&#x27;s unscented. It&#x27;s a little more expensive than most supermarket brands, and every once in a while I try one of those to see if I can save a couple of bucks, but I always come back to this.</li>
    <li> I have used this cream for over 20 yrs and have beautiful skin! At 33 yrs old I still get carded! My sister has really bad egsima and this is the only cream that makes it go away! I am so happy to find it online!</li>
    <li> We have used Complex 15 for quite a number of years and find it&#x27;s the only hand lotion that doesn&#x27;t leave your hands feeling waxy but the price is a little high.  Next time I think I would try find a better price.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this since the early 80&#x27;s and don&#x27;t know what I would do without it. Somehow my face is oily and dried out all at the same time. Has been my whole life.  Every other lotions I tried gives me zits.     Anyway this stuff works and has never cause any kind of breakout. It drags water molecules down into the skin and leaves no oil on the skin.    Can&#x27;t tell you how sad I was when they stopped stocking it at all the stores in So Cal and now the only way to get it is to order it.  The price was fair and the product got to me in a couple of days. Highly recommend this product to anyone who gets zits from lotion on the face.</li>
    <li> best moisturizer ever. discontinued. if you can find it, let me know.</li>
    <li> I tried to use this for my face like other users suggested, but for me it was awful! I noticed it not only clogged my pores but it didnt even moisturize that well. My end of my nose gets easily dry for some reason, and when I use the complex 15 face one it is always perfect and hydrated but when I used this it was peeling a little. Needless to say, I ponied up the $ to buy the face one again.&lt;br /&gt;Compared to the face lotion, this one is a lot thinner/liquidier. That&#x27;s probably why it doesn&#x27;t rly moisturize that well. I use it on my hands from time to time just so I can use up the 3 bottles of it I now have, but even for that it doesn&#x27;t really hydrate that well.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m sticking to the face moisturizer.</li>
    <li> This product is perfect for me!  It doesn&#x27;t cause me to breakout and gives just the right amount of moisture.  It dries fast and is just the thing I needed for my combination skin.  I love it and could not find it in stores anymore so ordered on-line.  Boy, was I happy ;)</li>
    <li> i have used this product for many yrs - i have very thin, ultrasensitive skin &amp; complex 15 skin lotion is the best product i&#x27;ve found to keep my skin from getting irritated</li>
    <li> I bought this lotion mainly because it has lecithin in it. I have had psoriasis for 29 years. I now have it on the tops of my hands which makes me very self-conscious. The lotion has worked wonders on my hands!! Most of the scales and redness is gone!! I am so pleased that I bought 2 3-packs and will be sending a 3-pack to my best friend who has ezcema. I would definitely recommend this product to anyone who has skin problems.</li>
    <li> I have had acne and dry skin for many years. This product works wonders by keeping my face moisturized even in the face of the drying antibiotics that I use for my skin. Other products were either ineffective or too greasy. I had to rely on vaseline cream to avoid embarrassing dry skin breakouts in my face during important days (meetings, interviews, etc). Anyways, the problem with most effective moisturizers is that they are oil based and tend to inflame acne.     Anyways, this product is water based and non-comedogenic. Basically means it won&#x27;t cause breakouts. Further, it is the only water based/non-comedogenic moisturizer out there that keeps my skin from drying out all day. All other moisturizers require frequent trips to the bathroom for reapplication during the day.     Take it from me, this product works extremely well. I don&#x27;t know how I managed without it.</li>
    <li> I purchased Complex 15 Therapeutic Moisturizing Lotion in &#x27;09 after I had researched recommendations for my dermatologist diagnosed sensitive skin. I read a recommendation from an individual who had similar skin conditions, issues and problems as myself. S/he received positive feedback for her recommendation of the use of Complex 15 Therapeutic Moisturizing Lotion among other products so I figured it&#x27;d be worth it to try this product.  The product met it&#x27;s description/features and the packaging is uncomplicated.  I finished the order (3, 8 fl oz) in less than one week with no improvement.  I have no plans to purchase this product again, but I believe it&#x27;s a better moisturizing lotion than the ones available at local stores.    Background:  In a nutshell, I have suffered from dermatologist diagnosed sensitive skin since childhood.  I developed eczema and allergies when I started elementary school, oddly.  I&#x27;d react to the itchiness, irritation, and inflammation I dealt with and I suffered from resulting in aches, pains, tears and frequent visits to the doctor&#x27;s office.  I found relief when a family friend brought a product from abroad that helped treat the state I had been in, and I learned to prevent and to control the flare-ups as I entered adolescence and adulthood.  Unfortunately, my 20&#x27;s have not been kind to me health wise, and the products that aided in preventing and controlling itchiness, irritation and inflammation no longer do or have been discontinued :|</li>
    <li> I love this product.  It is my favorite face cream.  I use it everyday.  It is light, non-greasy, and has no smell.  It was a favorite of my mother&#x27;s year ago, and I maintain the tradition to this day.</li>
    <li> I have used this lotion for over 33 years.  I am allergic to many lotions and perfumes.  This product does not leave any film on your skin or odor.  It doesn&#x27;t burn or irritate. You don&#x27;t have to use very much and therefore, the bottle lasts forever.</li>
    <li> I began using this lotion in 1990 soon after it arrived on the market.  I heard a dermatologist recommend it on a radio program.  It is light and thirst quenching for the skin.  I like it so much I special order it since it no longer appears on the shelves of the stores where I shop.</li>
    <li> This product is very hard to find in stores but readilly avaliable on amazon. I,ve used Complex 15 for many years and was extremley happy to find it so readilly avaliable on Amazon.For those with problem dry skin i highly recommend it&#x27;s non-greasy application. I find it EXTREMLEY effective on my sensitive dry skin. I rate this product 5 stars, i hope those who try this will be just half as satisified withtherapudic results as i have been.once you try it you&#x27;ll continue to buy it!</li>
    <li> I use this exclusively, it is the best, no perfume, absorbs immediately and a little goes a long way, will never use anything else!!</li>
    <li> Most hand lotions manage to make my face break out--I guess when I touch my face after applying them.  This one doen&#x27;t.  It isn&#x27;t heavy or greasy; it&#x27;s just right.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B001EJOPOI Complex 15 Therapeutic Moisturizing Lotion - 8 fl oz (Pack of 3)]]  This cream is great...I break out whenever I use any kind of creams...this cream does not make me itch or break out...I would recommend it for anyone who is sensitive or for anyone for that matter...it&#x27;s works great without being greasy :)</li>
    <li> I am a male now 70 years of age.  I started using this product about ten yrs ago.  My facial skin is very smooth for my age.  Most people are suprised when they learn my age.  My dermotologist even remarks about my skin and said she used the product years ago, but can no longer find it in town.  I still use the produce daily and after my shower.  My relatives and friends have begun using the product as well.  Wished I got a commission).</li>
    <li> I itch.  I have dry skin.  I hate being sticky.  I&#x27;m allergic to lotions with smell and most oils.  I would be a shriveled prune person without complex 15.</li>
    <li> This is the best hand lotion.  Non greasy or waxy.  The only stuff we use.  We buy this by the dozen to save on shipping.</li>
    <li> This product is absorbed quickly and does what it purports to do.  It was recommended to me years ago by my dematologist because it moisturizes the skin without clogging its pores.  I&#x27;ve used this and the one for the face for over ten years and they both are excellent.</li>
    <li> The local chain pharmacies do not carry Complex 15 for some reason, and perhaps they should. This is a light-feeling but very effective moisturizer that is to be applied sparingly to damp skin. I also use the facial version of Complex 15.  The product is not inexpensive, but it is a good value because so little is needed.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been putting on lotion from my hairline to my toes everyday since I can remember. My mom was a stickler and got me started when I was tiny. I can even remember the star stickers she would put on my lotion bottle every time I did a good job. So needless to say, I&#x27;ve been through a lot of lotion in my lifetime. Complex 15 is by far the best. It&#x27;s like giving your skin a drink of cool, clean water all day long. Unscented, non-greasy, non-clogging and very absorbing. Sometimes I try another brand just for variety, but I end up giving it away and coming back to Complex 15. In the winter I sometimes apply a second coat in the evenings. I order in bulk and stockpile for convenience. If you like a more creamy consistency try the face formulation.</li>
    <li> My doctor suggested several lotions before he recommended this one.  I&#x27;ve used it for over 20 years and it is great!  It absorbs into the skin quickly and does not stain clothing or leave a film on the skin.  If you are allergic to fragrance, this is the body lotion for you.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Complex 15 since 1985. Unfortunately it is no longer sold in local pharmacies. Over the years, I have recommended Complex 15 to many friends.</li>
    <li> Great product for those of us who are allergic to so many products.  You can purchases it at Costco pharmacy but it is behind the counter.</li>
    <li> The best lotion that I have found for winter dried hands and face.  It does not leave a greasy coating and lasts a fair amount of time.  A great product.</li>
    <li> This is a decent product. It did not do everything I needed it to do, but for over the counter products, there isn&#x27;t much better.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about 20 years after I was told by a dermatologist it was best treatment for dry skin after menopause.  It is impossible to buy the large size except on Amazon.  Most drug stores only carry the small size.  It works because it penetrates below the skin and retains moisture for several hours after applications.  It is not a fancy or particularly attractive bottle like other moisturizers but it really does the job.  Give it a try.</li>
    <li> not greasy at all but you&#x27;ll have to apply more often . probably the cream would work better on dry hands but this lotion feels good when applied on legs and body</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this lotion for over twenty years, and I know for a fact there&#x27;s nothing out there like it.  I have dry, sensitive skin with slightly oily skin on my face.  This product works for all my various issues.  Years ago used to get it at local drug stores, but one-by-one they all stopped carrying it.  Ulta beauty supply stores have a space for it on their shelves, but it&#x27;s always sold out.  Store manager had no explanation why they can&#x27;t keep such a popular product stocked.  Am guessing it may be problems dealing with the manufacturer.  Hey--Complex 15 people--get your act together and put your product on the shelves of CVS, Walgreen&#x27;s, Walmart, Target, etc!  You&#x27;d sell a zillion more units and life would be much easier for those of us who struggle to find your excellent product!!</li>
    <li> I am super sensitive to fragrance. Been using this for years from Amazon. Love it. I use it on my face and body.</li>
    <li> My grandmother used Complex 15 and I&#x27;ve been using it since I was a teenager. I&#x27;ve tried a lot of lotions over the years, from expensive to homemade, and this is my favorite.</li>
    <li> My wife has had problems with any moisturizer that has petroleum products (like Intensive Care)--they actually put an oil barrier between your skin and the moisture that may be in the air.  Her hands and other parts of her body can crack and even bleed if she uses those.&lt;br /&gt;A dermatologist recommended (prescribed?) Complex 15 lotion years ago... it was a miracle!  She covers virtually all of her body with it after showering.  It is the go-to moisturizer for the whole family, especially after a lot of sun or swimming in clorinated water.  It is also a great treatment for minor sunburn or windburn!  Helps retain a tan as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Suddenly, we can&#x27;t resupply!  We used to find it on some shelves, and then had our pharmacy order in groups of 6 - 12.  Now they say they cannot reorder.  Does anyone have a source?  We DO NOT WANT THE CREAM!</li>
    <li> This is some of the best lotion I&#x27;ve ever used. I normally purchase it in pharmacy stores, but it is becoming harder to find. I was really glad to be able to find it on Amazon!! Much easier!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This lotion has zero fragrance and make-up can be applied over it.</li>
    <li> I have used this lotion for a few years and LOVE it and now I understand&lt;br /&gt;it is no longer made by Merck and I am distresseds!!  I never received the&lt;br /&gt;shipment of these 3 I ordered and no one knew why and gave me a refund.&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t find any of it now and really hate it and don&#x27;t know what I will use.</li>
    <li> From a physician&#x27;s perspective this is a superior product that actually does what the advertisements declare.  It is especially  effective in treating dry skin in the winter when the humidity is low.  An excellent product!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used tons of lotions (including pure shea butter) that promise younger looking skin!  This is the only one that delivers!  My 65+ year old hands look 20 years younger.  Apply the moisturizer and see immediate and I mean IMMEDIATE results!  Not greasy at all!  Love, love, love!</li>
    <li> Really, if you have sensitive skin this is the best lotion for you.  I just wish I could buy it at the corner drug store!</li>
    <li> Water based, so it&#x27;s thin compared to most lotion. But it won&#x27;t make acne prone skin break out. I&#x27;ve used it for almost 20 years now.</li>
    <li> Moisterizes without leaving a residue behind. ONe two three four five. I hate this minimum word count comment response requirement.</li>
    <li> This product is the best.  Not the greasy kind.  I especially like it on arms and legs.  I would recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Complex 15 since I was about 20, and I&#x27;m 27 now. I swear by this stuff. I have never experienced a moisturizer this awesome! It&#x27;s not greasy, feels wonderful on skin, and is all around a great product.</li>
    <li> The pediatrician recommended this for my daughter in 1989 because she had dry sensitive skin as a baby. I also have very sensitive skin and can&#x27;t use most products. This is the only product we&#x27;ve tried that does not cause breakouts.It absorbs quickly and never feels greasy. We are both still using Complex 15 and hope they never stop making it.</li>
    <li> This was recommended to me by a dermatologist decades ago and is the only absolutely plain, pure moisturizer I have ever had.  I have spent a fortune on more expensive Creme de mer, Clay de Peau etc.... and at the end of the day all you really need is a plain old moisturizer and this one is so pure it is amazing for people with sensitive skin or allergies.  I have been able to use it even when I had an allergic reaction to other things going on.</li>
    <li> I have over the years tried many, many products for dry skin, with no success.  Complex 15 lotion is without a doubt the BEST I have ever used.  It was recommended to me over 30 years ago by my then OBGYN doctor.  I had stopped using it and the dryness became worse and worse until my now grown son asked why.  I started using this again and am grateful he &amp;#34;reminded&amp;#34; me of its effectiveness.  I will keep it in my home from now on.</li>
    <li> Good moisterizer....better than most.  The lotion is light, smooths on easily and does not feel greasy on one&#x27;s skin.  Really helps dry winter skin.</li>
    <li> Was very happy to find complex 15 online. It is a great lotion but very difficult to find locally. Was pleased with the price and delivery was very quick. Will be ordering again!</li>
    <li> This product is one I&#x27;ve used for years and I swear by it.  Buying through Amazon has made it more affordable and my order are filled quickly.</li>
    <li> I originally bought this lotion for my face.  But my face is extremely sensitive and the lotion irritated it.  So not to waste my investment, I decided to use it up as a body lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this as a body lotion!  The lotion is rather thin (not thick and waxy) and it really penetrates.  When applied, it appears to and feels like it relaxes my skin, moistens it, plumps it up.  This lotion also contains urea (look it up)  which has so many benefits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, this is the best body lotion I have ever used.</li>
    <li> Some time ago my M.D. sent me to the drug store to get Complex 15 for eczema on my hands.  When I first used it I thought it was too thin and didn&#x27;t smell good.  I guess it had no smell.  After just a day or two of using it my hands cleared up.  It rubs in clean, dry and doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy film on your skin.  It&#x27;s hard to find in drugstores but since I&#x27;ve been using Complex 15 I go the extra mile to find it.  I keep it on hands for my husband and son.  They like it because it is unscented and it works for them as well.  It was packaged great, arrived in a timely fashion and let me know I could order it again with no worries.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for many years and absolutely love it. I need to order more but don&#x27;t think that the products is still for sale.  I only saw the face cream, not the body lotion advertised the last time I looked. It is the best moisturizer for the money and absorbs into the skin like water. It is not one but greasy. I&#x27;m sure that the face cream will do the same but the quantity of that bottle is much less.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff as face cream.  I hate oily, heavy creams on my face but this stuff is the perfect consistency and absorbs quickly.</li>
    <li> The consistency is thin, unlike other moisturizers &amp; lotions and rubs into your skin completely. Great product for your face.</li>
    <li> This stuff is AWESOME! It&#x27;s hands-down the best moisturizer I&#x27;ve ever come across and I&#x27;ve tried them ALL!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Absorbs in seconds (I moisturize head to foot and when i get finished with my legs, the lotion has already absorbed on my arms)&lt;br /&gt;-No fragrance (if you like fragrance, squirt one shot of perfume on your lotion before rubbing it in)&lt;br /&gt;-Lightweight (doesn&#x27;t leave you feeling &amp;#34;lotioned up&amp;#34;)&lt;br /&gt;-Leaves skin super soft (but not greasy)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s worth the extra to splurge on this high-quality, high-performance lotion!</li>
    <li> Complex 15 is an effective moisturizing lotion that is great to use after shaving and for dry skin, especially during the winter months. Another great thing I like about this product is that it&#x27;s unscented. I have used it for over 20 years. It can be difficult to find in traditional drug stores. I was purchasing it from Drugstore.com. However, it was backordered for the first time since I began buying from them. Except for their email I received telling me that it was backordered, I heard nothing from them for several weeks. Finally, I called them and was told they had no idea when they would get another shipment. Therefore, I looked for other outlets and found that Amazon had it in stock and I got the product in a couple days. I will be buying Complex 15 from Amazon in the future.</li>
    <li> the least greasy, most milky smooth lotion i ever found. I&#x27;ve been using it for 20 years now. Such a deal.</li>
    <li> It used to be available in New York drugstores but no longer. Don&#x27;t know why, since it&#x27;s light, clean, fragrance-free and one of the gentlest things you can put on your skin. Since most other thick, perfumey lotions are irritating, I use this after shaving with a blade.</li>
    <li> Great deal. Hypoallergenic. Very happy</li>
    <li> My wife and I began using Complex 15 after it was recommended to us by my sister.  It is great stuff and a little goes a long way.  About the only moisturizer that doesn&#x27;t seem to make my face greasy!</li>
    <li> I appreciate Complex 15 so much. I use it on my hands and it is the only lotion I can use. Thank you to Amazon for carrying it.</li>
    <li> This is one of the best moisturizers I have used recently. I have paid much more for much less, but this is the product I will continue to buy. I use on my face, neck, and chest. Keeps my skin moist but not oily all day.</li>
    <li> Started using this product on the recommendation of acne.org, and it works extremely well. You can mix a few drops of jojoba oil in with it for extra protection against dry skin. Couldn&#x27;t find it at any drug stores near me.</li>
    <li> Used this product years ago and couldn&#x27;t find it in the stores any longer.  So glad I found it on-line -- this is the best moisturizer ever!</li>
    <li> Many have recommended using this over the more expensive face lotion for your face to save money. I&#x27;ve been using these lotions for a year or two now, and I had always noticed that they felt identical. I was curious what the actual differences were in the ingredients lists, so I started doing a little research.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After getting rid of the ingredients the two lotions have in common, I was left with the following.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Face Lotion: PEG-40 Stearate / Disodium EDTA&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Body Lotion: Tetrasodium EDTA&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s it. The formulas are otherwise identical. EDTAs are just a stabilizer and preservative, and the reason for using different EDTAs is based on the PH of the substance. I suppose the addition of the PEG-40 Stearate changed the overall PH of the face lotion, so they used the different EDTA.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So the only REAL difference worth noting, the difference that you&#x27;re paying the premium for, is the PEG-40 Stearate. From what I&#x27;ve read, it helps water mix with oil and dirt to presumably be washed off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I can see this being useful in a face wash, I don&#x27;t see this as particularly helpful or necessary in my case. The lotion I put on my face always goes on after washing it in the shower, so it seems mostly useless to be honest. Even if I put it on at other times, I don&#x27;t see it as particularly useful, especially when I&#x27;m being charged a steep premium for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The body and face lotion 3-packs are currently going for $1.04 and $2.46 an ounce, respectively. That&#x27;s about a 150% premium for this one ingredient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All-in-all, I say go with the body lotion and forget the face lotion. You guys can make up your own minds though.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t find this lotion anywhere else.  Husband uses it daily (age 62) and has for many years.  He likes that it absorbs quickly and has very little fragrance.  He is a rancher and it helps keep his skin from drying out so much</li>
    <li> I originally started using this moisturizer as a teen because my mom used it religiously. Now, 10 years later, we&#x27;re both still using it. It&#x27;s very hard to find in retailers and pharmacies, so we&#x27;ve taken to ordering online instead. I use it in conjunction with Neutrogena&#x27;s Deep Clean Cleanser. Is perfect for hot months. I use something different that&#x27;s a little thicker during the winter months when my skin is really taking a beating from the cold air. Very highly recommend - would be so disappointed if it were ever discontinued!</li>
