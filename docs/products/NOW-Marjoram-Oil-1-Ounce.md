      <li>Perfect for the few drops I needed.</li>
      <li>One night of light snoring and that was it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Since them I have used it primarily as a scent to help soothe into sleep at night.</li>
      <li>Really good essential oil</li>
      <li>I use it diluted in carrier oil...or full strength.  </li>

      <li>We tried it for another week and had only one case where he snored lightly but quickly stopped.  </li>
      <li>it have anti-viral, anti-bacterial and so many other great properties i reccomend anyone with little kids should have this in their medicine cabinet!</li>
      <li>It makes my husband and my little Lhasa Apso sneeze several times when i first put it on, which always makes for a great laugh.  </li>
      <li>it smells pretty nice, almost a little minty.</li>
      <li>These oil are the same fine quality that i have come to exect.  </li>
      <li>A little Argan oil is nice in this blend as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Marjoram has a distinct warm and bit of a spicy smell, not unpleasant, it isn&#x27;t irritating to the skin and is not a toxic oil.</li>
      <li>but i was ready to try anything nautral over giving them medication all the time.</li>
      <li>Thanks Amazon &amp;  </li>
      <li>It works really well.  </li>
      <li>and fast service.</li>

      <li>Very &amp;#34;herbal&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>I actually really like this brand.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> It&#x27;s working again this spring and the pollen was so thick here in Virginia yesterday that you could see the yellow haze in the air.&lt;br /&gt;The plague of the constantly dripping nose, sneezing, watery eyes is controlled by putting a drop of this marvelous stuff under the tongue about twice a day.  I let it absorb for a while, then wash it down with some water. It is very strong, but who cares! It stops the plague!&lt;br /&gt;Note that this is &amp;#34;thymus mastichina.&amp;#34; There are different oils called &amp;#34;majoram.&amp;#34; This one is more accurately &amp;#34;Spanish marjoram.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;I do not know if the other &amp;#34;marjorams&amp;#34; have the same effect.&lt;br /&gt;Oh, and I often carry a cotton hankie with a few drops of Marjoram for breathing in the vapors when I&#x27;m out. Love this stuff!&lt;br /&gt;Now Foods has excellent quality! I trust this brand completely.</li>
    <li> The NOW oils may not be the rarest oils around, like the ones from Floracopeia, but they are effective, affordable and available in&lt;br /&gt;larger quantities if you need it.</li>
    <li> At first the smell really bother me because I don&#x27;t enjoy mintly sense.  However,  I mix it with lavender essential oil into my essential oil diffuser,  I kind of enjoy it a little more,  after few more days,  I love it.  I turned the diffsuer on before I go to bed,  I felt into sleep very quickly</li>
    <li> I use about 3 drops of this in a mix with a base oil and 3 drops of frankincense oil in a gel cap three times a day.  It helps lift my mood, combats pain, and anxiety without any bad side effects.  It also helps with my insomnia.  I recommend this product for anyone who is looking for an alternative to medications.</li>
    <li> Really good essential oil it works. I highly recommend this item. Thanks Amazon &amp;  Great Delivery too.</li>
    <li> The Marjoram Oil is the best.  I had purchased a round container from a home show to help my husband&#x27;s snoring.  It works really well.  The scent was wearing off so I thought I would try this oil and it works great.  Would buy again in the future...</li>
    <li> Great marjoram oil.  Very fresh and very effective.  Our massage therapist advised us to use it on the soles of our feet to help relieve nasal stuffiness - - - and it works!  Also helps to clear up nasal stuffiness when applied to the outer edge of nostril openings. This marjoram oil also helps us to prevent dry skin problems.  Very reasonably priced.  We recommend this marjoram oil without any reservation whatsoever.</li>
    <li> Wild marjoram for achy muscles.  Works good.  Very &amp;#34;herbal&amp;#34; smelling....which isn&#x27;t  a bad thing.  I use it diluted in carrier oil...or full strength.  Good value</li>
    <li> Great product and delivered fast</li>
    <li> A great quality Marjoram I have used for years. Would like to find it in the 4 oz size.</li>
    <li> Great product. and fast service.</li>
    <li> I am THE biggest fan of all things NOW, but I am not a fan of the oils after trying the Rose Absolute and the Marjoram. I ordered this instead of my usual brand while I was away and forgot my oils bag and Prime fit my time options. The Rose is difficult to diffuse and mix and I could barely use it. The Marjoram was far too overpowering even in a carrier oil. It seemed artificial. I will wind up tossing them once I&#x27;m back home for good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am surprised that NOW doesn&#x27;t offer USDA Certified Organic or Therapeutic Grade essential oils. That was a shock. &#x27;100% Pure&#x27; is not the same thing.</li>
    <li> Strong and effective, exactly as it should be. I&#x27;ve been using it for several weeks and it&#x27;s everything I&#x27;d hoped. It&#x27;s another oil I use for carpel tunnel as well as muscle spasms and deep aches. When I put it on the bottom of my feet before I go to bed at night it alleviates pain and makes me drowsy very quickly.  It makes my husband and my little Lhasa Apso sneeze several times when i first put it on, which always makes for a great laugh.  Doesn&#x27;t laughter release endorphins, boosting the immune system? So I can add that to it&#x27;s plus side. Marjoram has a distinct warm and bit of a spicy smell, not unpleasant, it isn&#x27;t irritating to the skin and is not a toxic oil. It&#x27;s a great sedative. This brand oil has done everything I needed it to do.  Easy recommendation.</li>
    <li> I use this to fall asleep sometimes. It&#x27;s pretty strong but it does help me to relax so I can fall asleep.</li>
    <li> I purchased the Marjoram oil before and it smells totally different from the NOW Foods product!!!&lt;br /&gt;The Marjoram oil from the NOW Food smelles exactely like Eucalyptus oil, or at least has a lot of Eucalytus oil in it!!!&lt;br /&gt;I even bought Lavender oil from NOW Foods and it has an odd smell. The price of NOW Foods products are very good, but they&#x27;re loosing their quality BIG TIME.</li>
    <li> I use this in my diffuser every night mixed with cypress, bergamot, and lavender. Puts me right to sleep. I also use it mixed with coconut oil to run into my bone spur and it warms it up and minimizes the pain. I highly recommend this oil.</li>
    <li> Marjoram oil works quickly on tired, sore, tight muscles as well as muscle spasms and pain. The Quality and the price are very good.</li>
    <li> This is a updated edited review since 2014;&lt;br /&gt;7-13-16&lt;br /&gt;This marjoram essential oil has the botanical name Thymus Mastichina which is not the same as the sweeter smelling sweet marjoram that has the botanical name Origanum Majorana. I use this medicinally and  it works great in a blend I use for severe menstrual Cramps. I use 10 drops of Marjoram, 10 drops Clary Sage, and 20 drops of Lavender which I add to a one ounce bottle and then I add a carrier oil to the top. I cover and shake. You than rub it on your abdominal areas where you are experiencing pain and it works better than any pill for severe cramps. I  also was given a muscle relaxer for my severe cramps and it did not help at all but this simple recipe helps me. I  been using now foods marjoram essential oil for years and it works great.</li>
    <li> I actually really like this brand. it smells pretty nice, almost a little minty. I am pleased with my buy</li>
    <li> I prefer NOW foods EPO&#x27;s to many brands out there. Not the best, but fine for most uses.</li>
    <li> Marjoram oil was used by ancient Egyptians as a sedative. I put it on it every night before I go to bed, it helps me reach a deep level of relaxation fast. I put it on my chest, temples, soles of my feet and some times in my nostrils, as it clears the air passages and helps me breath really well. Love it!</li>
    <li> just adding to my stock</li>
    <li> We have been mixing this with carrier oils (castor oil and grapeseed oil) along with a few drops of eucalyptus oil and either peppermint oil or lavender oil. My husband finds that rubbing this mixture on his sore knees 2 or 3 x/day is more effective than the prescription NSAIDS that he no longer needs!</li>
    <li> This is very good for Charlie horse in your legs. I use it right away on the onset of one. And it takes it away fast.</li>
    <li> I have lots of this brand, reliable quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This oil is good blended sparingly with lavender in a coconut and Shea butter base and used for sore aching muscles and hands.  For 1 oz base I old use 3 drops marjoram and 10 drops lavender.  A little Argan oil is nice in this blend as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A bit too strong to use on the face.</li>
    <li> ***********  UPDATE 3/816/2015  ***********************&lt;br /&gt;Since I&#x27;ve written this review I have been back to purchase another bottle of this EO.  It&#x27;s been a life saver for me.  My husband has had only minor snoring issue since I started him on this . The snoring issues he has had have been very few and far between and either very brief or due to allergies.  I can count on one hand the number of times I have been woken up by his snoring since I&#x27;ve been using this EO.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not 100% sure if it&#x27;s the EO or just an amazing coincidence. Prior to using this EO there had many nights he volunteered to sleep on the couch due to his snoring so he isn&#x27;t yet willing to test whether this EO is the cure for his snoring or whether he just doesn&#x27;t have an issue any longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**************  Review from September 12, 2014 *********************************&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is Marjoram essential oil  ( thymus mastichina )  passed my paper test which may indicate that it&#x27;s 100% essential oil.  It smells a bit minty and medicinal.  I purchased this essential oil after researching that there is a potential that essential oils can help with snoring.  My husband and I&#x27;ve been together coming up 16 years and in the last year he just started snoring.  We contribute the change to a 20 pound weight gain and he&#x27;s working losing those 20 pounds however in the mean time we needed something which could help with his snoring.  We used nose strips, he tries to stay on his side, he stopped drinking before bed and we even elevated the bed so he&#x27;s sleeping on a slight incline but none of this has been 100% effective and in the last month I&#x27;ve been woken up by his snoring more times than not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We had tried the Marjoram essential oil in the past and it seemed to work but we stopped using it for some reason.  I brought it out again after a week of him snoring heavily.  He spent a good 5 minutes breathing it in and even put some under his nose and for the first time in a longtime I was able to sleep the entire night.  We tried it for another week and had only one case where he snored lightly but quickly stopped.  I then purchased an essential oil diffuser and it&#x27;s been running for a week with success.  Currently we have gone two weeks being nearly snore free.  One night of light snoring and that was it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My fingers are crossed that Marjoram is working and it&#x27;s not some sort of coincidence that he&#x27;s not snoring.</li>
    <li> excellent would buy again</li>
    <li> This is not regular marjoram oil (marjorana hortensia), is the wild type (thymus mastichina) and it stinks. Nowhere in the description of the product is mentioned the type of oil you are buying. I wonder about all the great reviews this item got and if people really knew what they were buying. If they liked this one so much maybe they should try the regular one</li>
    <li> This is a good marjoram oil and I can recommend it. I believe a lot of NOW oils are equivalent to more expensive ones.</li>
    <li> Good for the price.  Smells strong Product came well wrapped.  This company is good for quality and price.</li>
    <li> The product arrived earlier than expected.  I especially like NOW oils and trying Basil in addition to Frankincense was a suggestion that I&#x27;m glad I pursued.  These oil are the same fine quality that i have come to exect.  The entire ordering, notifications, and shipment and delivery were flawless.  I would highly recommend this seller and the price was more than competitive.</li>
    <li> Different than what I expected from marjoram.&lt;br /&gt;More campherous and not quite like the herbal smell itself.&lt;br /&gt;However, very nice in the diffuser. Would recommend.&lt;br /&gt;Fast shipment and good packaging.</li>
    <li> Exactly what i was looking for.</li>
    <li> Now has the best oils out there. Just make sure when buying you get 100% essential oils. Love the scent in my products.</li>
    <li> It took me a while to get used to the scent but now I like it. It is relaxing and wonderful in a diffuser. Mixed with a bit of high quality (not this brand though --there are better available on Amazon.com) lavender Essential Oil, will calm you.</li>
    <li> Just use them as directed and they work. Better than taking all the drugs that people are taking I would recommend this.</li>
    <li> Smells like menthol -- remember Vicks Vapo-rub?!</li>
    <li> Great scent and good for general use.  I use a lot of oil sfor different things and these are great.</li>
    <li> Now is my favorite EO brand!!</li>
    <li> This is one of the oils I use every night to ensure a great nights sleep. It has a soothing medicinal type of smell.</li>
    <li> Ive got three boys and they all get Croup about 6 times a year each! My youngest is 15 months and oldest is 6 years old and the doctors were giving them steroids everytime! i hated giving them steroids that often so i set out to find an alternitive to those darn steroids. I came across several things suggested using Marjoram. I am still learning about essential oils but i was ready to try anything nautral over giving them medication all the time. Let me tell you this stuff is awesome! it have anti-viral, anti-bacterial and so many other great properties i reccomend anyone with little kids should have this in their medicine cabinet!</li>
    <li> Warm soothing aroma. Ants hate it; my potted plants are now free of ants after just a few drops each.</li>
    <li> The product itself probably was fine, however the bottle was not closed tightly, so the entire bottle leaked out inside the bubble wrap pouch. Fortunately, the packaging was so good it didn&#x27;t damage any other products and Amazon gave me a full refund, but I was still left without the marjoram. In small quantities, I find the smell quite relaxing, but in large quantities (like the entire bottle&#x27;s contents when I opened the bubble wrap), it causes a severe headache. Just because of the leaking bottle, I&#x27;m inclined to find a different seller for my next purchase.</li>
    <li> Arrived way faster than estimated. Exactly what I was looking for. Nice packaging also.</li>
    <li> I mixed this with my Mom&#x27;s baby lotion she uses everyday and within 15 mins of her putting it on the pain in her back and stomach were almost gone!  She is a believer of essential oils now.</li>
    <li> I first came across marjoram oil as aromatherapy in Barcelona. Since them I have used it primarily as a scent to help soothe into sleep at night. Highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I really like the NOW oils, however this was a let down. It smells terrible! I have smelled marjoram before, but I do not care for the scent of this marjoram at all. I love you NOW brand, and will continue to buy other EO&#x27;s, but I will pass on the marjoram. I&#x27;m sorry :(</li>
    <li> yet again another great deal off amazon.com I never buy my oils in stores or from Doterra. These are just as good and you save a ton of money and they smell better. Maybe it because they have not been filtered 100 times?</li>
    <li> My favorite oil for pain. This is so good . I do double drops, but it works!!!!</li>
    <li> pure essential oil, in a small amount.  Perfect for the few drops I needed.</li>
    <li> I use NOW Foods essential oils a LOT in my home &amp; for personal use. I have never been disappointed by the quality nor their very reasonable pricing. The products have a long shelf life. I use this one in making my own home deodorizing spray combined with a few other herbal oils. We have several cats &amp; dogs here so pet odors can get out of control! I am chemically sensitive now so I had to find alternatives to keeping my home smelling good.</li>
