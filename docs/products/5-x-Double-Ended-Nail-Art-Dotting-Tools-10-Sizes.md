      <li>I was so excited to get a set of dotting tools because I&#x27;d seen nail tutorials on Youtube in which the people use them.</li>
      <li>Overall, a good product that should serve its purpose just fine.</li>
      <li>The price is right for what you get and they are easy to use.</li>
      <li>But I just rubbed the ends on a cotton ball and it comes right off!</li>
      <li>i was surprised to have received the hello kitty nail decorations and the rhinestones, i honestly didn&#x27;t expect to receive them (even though it was advertised),</li>
      <li>Overall it&#x27;s a good product and the bonus rhinestones and sequins</li>
      <li>These are very nice dotting tools, and I thought it&#x27;d be a bit harder to clean off the nail polish.</li>
      <li>but they are super  </li>
      <li>super colourful and fun,they get the job done.</li>
      <li>are so pretty!</li>

      <li>The pens are catchy and makes marbelizing fun.  </li>
      <li>I was warned of this from other reviews so was not surprised by this, and still find that these are great as I do not think any more sizes are necessary.&lt;br /&gt;Overall,</li>

      <li>Most of the ones I have are bigger, and these are smaller.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I love these dotting tools!  The sizes are not incredibly varied, but I still have all the sizes that I need to create any nail art imaginable.</li>
    <li> The pen set came with hello kitty gold nail art decorations and gold rhinestones.  The pens are catchy and makes marbelizing fun.  Not only I get to create art but use artistic looking pens.  I like the different sizes of round tips to get the exact lines and swirls that I like to create.  I own other pens as well and for the price these are pens are what to expect.  I was hoping they came in their own storage case as others usually do but thats okay.  The free bonus was nice but not the reason i purchased the pens.</li>
    <li> these dotting tools are awesome! super colourful and fun,they get the job done. they clean up nicely too. i was surprised to have received the hello kitty nail decorations and the rhinestones, i honestly didn&#x27;t expect to receive them (even though it was advertised), but sure enough i open the package and there they are! thanx so much!</li>
    <li> after watching tons of youtube nail videos this was a must-have tool, i couldnt be more happy with the tools and delivery, i feel like a pro!</li>
    <li> These are very nice dotting tools, and I thought it&#x27;d be a bit harder to clean off the nail polish. But I just rubbed the ends on a cotton ball and it comes right off! I actually thought the little nail designs and hello kitty ones would be a bit larger but they&#x27;re actually really small. I think almost so small people will barely be able to tell it&#x27;s hello kitty! But they do come along free, so it&#x27;s cute and worth it! I would definitely recommend these! Great price, shipped fast, and they are very handy!</li>
    <li> I love the product, it was just what i was looking for. I will be sure to tell other nail techs where to come for these great tools!</li>
    <li> the dotting tools are great,very convenient  Easy to hold...came with Different size ,but i expect ten Different  sizes ended but i got about 5-6 sizes for 5 pens and in a pen there are 2 Different  sizes ended.  but !!!!! still , a very good dotting set to buy .  \\&quot;Hello Kitty\\&quot; Gold Nail Art Decoration and Rhinestones are very cute, i love it.and  i very impress on their prompt and great customer service.</li>
    <li> I think this nail dotting pen set is great and does exactly what they should. I have used them to make polka dots and french tips on my nails. Some of the tips are the same size, but I don&#x27;t really mind. The price is right for what you get and they are easy to use. I love the Hello Kitty nail art that I received too. I just wish it would have come with more of those cute little kitty heads!</li>
    <li> I enjoy my new tools for my nails. Easy to use. Easy to clean. Colors are enjoyable to view. Only one issue I have is one of the tools seem to not be as rounded as the others...sort of sharp pointy. But otherwise, great product. Will recommend.</li>
    <li> I Absolutely LOVE THESE! They came way before the time estimated and they are absolutely PERFECT. I love the way the acrylic or plastic handles are, the shapes of each of the dotting tools at each end. They are all different on each end. Very colorful, easy to use. The itty bitty one that is on one of the end is PERFECT for marbling the colors on your nails and also is perfect for making designs with. I LOVE THESE! I HIGHLY Recommend these to ANYONE who loves Nail art like I do! The Rhinestones, Hello Kitty designs, and confetti it comes with are so pretty! Very tiny, but perfect for doing adult as well as children&#x27;s nails!</li>
    <li> These have been instrumental in making my manicures look awesome and precise!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They are sturdy (I haven&#x27;t had the pointers come out or loosen from their bases) and there is a nice variety of tip sizes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They come in a little plastic fold-over bag, which is nice for storing and viewing to see which one you&#x27;ll need.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended!!</li>
    <li> These are fun :), arrived in great time. I&#x27;ve been using a toothpick (hahah), an now I can FINALLY do sooo much more! I really am enjoying all the different sizes.</li>
    <li> This product shipped in time and came with everything it said it would. Each side is different if u look closely and works well for all different nail art! i use these all the time now! Also the gold Hello Kitty nail art decoration is useable and cute and so are the different types of rhinestones it comes with. Great package worth buying:)</li>
    <li> What a wonderful tool.  I really enjoy using it in my polymer clay work.  Thanks for a great product.&lt;br /&gt;Cheers.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical about whom these were coming from, but needn&#x27;t be. The tools are great, the balls are great sizes, and no bumps or rough edges on the balls. As a beginner I&#x27;ve already used these and can see where I&#x27;ll continue using them.</li>
    <li> I bought these thinking I would be doing finger nails, but I use them more for crafting and my clay work than anything else. have to  buy more!! Good price great quality!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a set of dotters for a while, when I came across this bargain! Dotters arrived within a week, I believe. Everything arrived as promised, although I have yet to use the Hello Kitty decor or the gems. Dotters work well. My only gripe is that on one end of each, the dotter is the same size. Each opposite end is either larger or smaller. Not sure if other dotters are this way. In total, there are 6 different sizes. Was hoping for 10. Still a good buy for the price :)</li>
    <li> I was so excited to get a set of dotting tools because I&#x27;d seen nail tutorials on Youtube in which the people use them. I&#x27;ve never had them before and just tested them out on a piece of paper and have to say they&#x27;re easy to use, even for beginners. I got them the day before the expected arrival date and it only took them five days to get here! The bonuses are tiny and at first I thought I had only gotten the confetti but they were all there. Though they are small in size I still can&#x27;t wait to try them out. They are so cute. I definitely recommend the tools because they&#x27;re easy to use and not very expensive. I&#x27;m going to be using them for a while!</li>
    <li> These pens are cute and I&#x27;m pleased with my purchase. They look exactly like the picture and came with some little nail decor sequins. Would buy from this seller again.</li>
    <li> I like the durable feel of these. Nice design. Like in some if the other reviews these dotting tools have one major flaw, you have the same size on the end of each tool therefore lessening your size variations from the sellers description. Overall it&#x27;s a good product and the bonus rhinestones and sequins are really cute.</li>
    <li> Better than I expected the dots come out perfect than they would with a homemade dotting tool love this product</li>
    <li> ok so they tell you that you get 5 dotting tools with 10 different size dotters but you really only get 6 one end of each has a different size and the other ends are all the same just thought that was a little silly when they tell you you get 10 different  dotting tools but they are super  i do love them</li>
    <li> I love these dotting tools are a really good product and if i ever lose them i will buy them again because they are perfect! They have all the ideal sized dotting tools that anyone needs and the hello kitty decorations and rhinestones are really cute</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t do nails, however, I do other c raft things that sometimes need finer dotting tools. Most of the ones I have are bigger, and these are smaller. They pretty m ugh me t my expectations. Thank you! I gave the second set to a friend. She said &amp;#34;Cool!&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I gave this product 4 stars because the Hello Kitty decals were so microscopicslly tiny that they look like diamonds...you can&#x27;t tell that they are hello kitty at all. They are solid instead of the outline which was advertised but being that they were a bonus with the dotters I can&#x27;t say too much. I love the dotters...the design is beautiful and they make a great addition to my nail products. Fast delivery! Thanks.</li>
    <li> good. One point fell out on day one.</li>
    <li> The bonus items were really nice, but the product is misleading one end on each of the sticks are the same. However, I still enjoy it and they are great tools.</li>
    <li> These tools are perfect for creating pretty nail designs.  I use them all the time. I like the variety of sizes available.</li>
    <li> Excellent.  Good price. Prompt delivery.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughter to use and its a great tool, makes easy work of dotting and design and what a great price</li>
    <li> I ordered a set of these for the first time and found that they were great. I use them to create several designs on my nails and it is extremely easy. In the past I have used toothpicks and paintbrushes for this and it took me much longer to create designs than it does with the dotting tool and that the ones from the dotting tool look much nicer. They shipped quickly, were undamaged and came in a small plastic case which I can store them in. The color of each pen  was also a nice bonus as they do look pretty (soft pastels).&lt;br /&gt;Be warned, you do get 5 2-way pens, but this does not mean you get 10 different sizes. You get 5 sizes as all the tips on one side are the same and one of them has two sides of the same tip. I was warned of this from other reviews so was not surprised by this, and still find that these are great as I do not think any more sizes are necessary.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, Nice pens, look pretty and in a plastic case. Good shipping time. Good price. No product damage. Work well to create several designs. Only FIVE different tip sizes.</li>
    <li> For a first time user, this product has taken a little getting used to. It sure beats using a toothpick, though! I won&#x27;t say it&#x27;s state of the art technology, because it&#x27;s not, but the tools are helpful. Just know that you really should have some creativity and a steady hand if you want anything close to recognizable on your nails. The quality of the pens seem acceptable. They are a heavy plastic, so I don&#x27;t think they will break or anything like some of the reviews I have read on other products, and the little bag of designs is SUPER tiny. I almost missed it, so keep your eye out. It&#x27;s there, just not in your face. Overall, a good product that should serve its purpose just fine.</li>
    <li> The dotting tools come in different colors. However the dotting tools do have the same size dot at one end of the tools. But the other sides are varied. The work magnificently.</li>
    <li> I do my nails every 3 days these come in handy when i do design on my nails! and there easy to clean too!</li>
