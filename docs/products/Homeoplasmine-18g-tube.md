      <li>Cost aside, this product is great!  </li>
      <li>AS THE PRODUCT INSIDE IS WONDERFUL.</li>
      <li>Best beauty find ever!</li>
      <li>This is the best stuff ever.</li>
      <li>Great Product!</li>
      <li>Makes skin look beautiful and helps to keep away blemishes.</li>
      <li>but it is also great for healing.</li>
      <li>works great for chapped lips</li>
      <li>this is a great primer under makeup</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m beyond happy.</li>
      <li>and I am happy I tried this one out.</li>
      <li>As I said, it may be great for soothing the skin...just don&#x27;t know.</li>
      <li>My lips are happy but the inside of my handbag isn&#x27;t.  </li>
      <li>this stuff is amazing!</li>
      <li>Might be good for rashes or something.  </li>
      <li>Everything I tried before has tendency to be too greasy when I am in fact looking for good hydration.</li>
      <li>but I&#x27;ve been using it for years, this is the best petroleum jelly type product you can get- better than Vaseline, better than Aquaphor, better than Lucas Pawpaw ointment.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Quite honestly, it&#x27;s just Vaseline with a smattering of plant-based extracts and boric acid.</li>
      <li>I was excited to read all the great reviews and when i got the product i tried it on myself and everybody else in my family.</li>
      <li>I use it as facial cream and my face is very happy about that.</li>
      <li>/&gt;needs better packaging.</li>
      <li>This has been lovely for chapped lips.</li>
      <li>It works much better than vaseline or petrolium based products.</li>
      <li>I love the product but wish it came in a pot or a sturdier tube.  </li>
      <li>Caused a lot of discomfort, couldn&#x27;t keep it on for more than 10 mins.</li>
      <li>Not quite as shiny as Vaseline or Aquaphor; more of a satin finish on the skin.  </li>
      <li>for the first time in 2 months!!!</li>
      <li>so nice and such a great product.</li>
      <li>This certainly will not cause irritation and it is emollient and a good barrier cream, but it&#x27;s not a miracle product.</li>
      <li>Worth the money for sure.</li>
      <li>Great for chapped lips, dry skin.</li>
      <li>upon applying Homeoplasmine, we noticed a difference right away!</li>
      <li>I keep it in my purse and use it to moisturize my generous, full lips.</li>
      <li>It is profoundly powerful.</li>
      <li>Worth every penny.</li>
      <li>In combination with daily 5 minute luke warm oatmeal baths, and a barrier cream she is almost entirely eczema free...</li>
      <li>/&gt;Trick Tip: To eke out every last drop of this precious ointment, i use a wringer :</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t result in a shiny Vaseline finish, just very moisturized looking,</li>
      <li>I grew up very close to the facilities of the company in France, and my family has used this product for decades.</li>
      <li>Really keeps the the mositure in your lips.</li>
      <li>Very soothing, no taste or smell</li>
      <li>Products is taking care of rough spots,and dark spots on face very nicely.  </li>
      <li>I love homeopathics but this product gets a thumbs down from me.</li>
      <li>i got too much sun 2 weeks ago and wore this on my face to repair the damage and help along the new skin.</li>
      <li>The main ingredient is Vaseline, followed by boric acid and some herbs.  </li>
      <li>I use it almost exclusively as a lip balm and can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
      <li>May look good temporarily but in the long run will dry your skin,all petroleum products dry the skin even though appearing to look moist.</li>
      <li>It was recommended to me by the pharmacist because of irritation in the nose membrane and after using for one day the problem was almost completely remedied!  </li>
      <li>This is fine for chapped lips and rough skin, but the French name and old-fashioned cure-</li>
      <li>we&#x27;ve been using this for 4 days now on my 6 month old baby.</li>
      <li>WOW...</li>
      <li>It is a bit shinny on the skin (especially if used too much it)</li>
      <li>I have been using it on my dry lips and cuticles, and it&#x27;s fine, but not worth the price.  </li>
      <li>Pity it costs so much to get in the US.  </li>
      <li>I was over taken by other people&#x27;s reviews, but this really doesn&#x27;t do anything.</li>
      <li>It contains vaselinum alba more commonly known as Vaseline or petroleum jelly,with a few homeopathics thrown in.&lt;br /&gt;Vaselinum alba/vaseline is purified and wholly or nearly decolorised mixture of semi-solid hydrocarbons, obtained from petroleum.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Bought some of this in the UK recently.  The 18g tube was £8 at TopShop.  It is an ointment very similar to Aquaphor, at about 3x the price.  I have been using it on my dry lips and cuticles, and it&#x27;s fine, but not worth the price.  Not quite as shiny as Vaseline or Aquaphor; more of a satin finish on the skin.  Buying it online is even more expensive than what I paid.  I will use this up, but will go back to buying Aquaphor.  Just don&#x27;t see the value in this stuff.</li>
    <li> works great for chapped lips</li>
    <li> Great Product! I have been using this all Winter due to my really dry lips. It works much better than vaseline or petrolium based products. Really keeps the the mositure in your lips.</li>
    <li> WOW...we&#x27;ve been using this for 4 days now on my 6 month old baby. She has eczema.  We&#x27;ve tried just about everything, and nothing has worked but cortisone creams. I&#x27;ve been searching for another solution, and this cream seems to be it! In combination with daily 5 minute luke warm oatmeal baths, and a barrier cream she is almost entirely eczema free...for the first time in 2 months!!! I&#x27;m beyond happy. Worth every penny.</li>
    <li> love the balm but the packaging is terrible and after has cracked to the point where the balm eeks out of the actual container.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;needs better packaging.</li>
    <li> this was a tip from the ad in the magazine and I am happy I tried this one out. Everything I tried before has tendency to be too greasy when I am in fact looking for good hydration.Little goes a long way. I use it as facial cream and my face is very happy about that. I want to use it on my hands also, but I&#x27;d need to buy a bigger tube now, which I will. It is a bit shinny on the skin (especially if used too much it) so, using it as a morning cream is a bit tricky. But I blot it with tissue before putting make up on, and since my face and neck feel well hydrated throughout the day I am still tempted to use it even in the morning.</li>
    <li> this stuff is amazing! heals any irritated skin problem from chapped lips to blisters to reducing redness when a cut is healing!</li>
    <li> This is fine for chapped lips and rough skin, but the French name and old-fashioned cure-all reputation should not fool people.  The main ingredient is Vaseline, followed by boric acid and some herbs.  This certainly will not cause irritation and it is emollient and a good barrier cream, but it&#x27;s not a miracle product.</li>
    <li> this is a great primer under makeup but it is also great for healing. i got too much sun 2 weeks ago and wore this on my face to repair the damage and help along the new skin. so nice and such a great product.</li>
    <li> Add the word &amp;#34;French&amp;#34; to any product and watch it turn into a cult-status item. Is it a miracle product? No more than any other petroleum-jelly-based salve. But it&#x27;s got the &amp;#34;French Factor&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;High Unavailability in the States&amp;#34; which increases its &amp;#34;cult status&amp;#34; even more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Quite honestly, it&#x27;s just Vaseline with a smattering of plant-based extracts and boric acid. A slightly &amp;#34;friendlier&amp;#34; version of Aquaphor or Elizabeth Arden&#x27;s 8-hour cream, which both contain lanolin (animal-based ingredient), but similar in texture and formula.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s an oily, occlusive ointment/salve meant for cuts &amp; irritations. Just like Vaseline, it &amp;#34;heals&amp;#34; by way of occlusion and blocking impurities/bacteria from entering a wound/cut. It also blocks from dryness/chapping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do NOT recommend using this on your face if you are acne-prone or have blemishes--its too clogging and doesn&#x27;t allow skin to breathe. It in no way &amp;#34;eliminates acne&amp;#34; which is the Amazon.com description (false marketing!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A tube costs about $5 in France so if you have a friend going there, ask them to stock up at any local pharmacy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trick Tip: To eke out every last drop of this precious ointment, i use a wringer :[[ASIN:B003XKEK50 Heavy Duty All Metal Tube Wringer By Gill Manufacturing]]</li>
    <li> doesn&#x27;t do anything. I was over taken by other people&#x27;s reviews, but this really doesn&#x27;t do anything. It doesn&#x27;t really ease irritation, its just thick and Vaseline like.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t see how one could use this under makeup as suggested.  Might be good for rashes or something.  But I bought it on the recommendation as a cream for under makeup.  For me it would be far too heavy and greasy.  As I said, it may be great for soothing the skin...just don&#x27;t know.</li>
    <li> This is the best stuff ever. Never leave home without it. Great for chapped lips, dry skin. Have used it on face, hands, elbows. Best beauty find ever!</li>
    <li> Homeoplasmine is a French product. I grew up very close to the facilities of the company in France, and my family has used this product for decades. If you have any type of rash, scratch, itch, etc... this is THE ointment for it.  This stuff works well and helps the healing process.</li>
    <li> I love the product but wish it came in a pot or a sturdier tube.  My lips are happy but the inside of my handbag isn&#x27;t.  If they did something to prevent the tube from leaking I WOULD GIVE IT 5 STARS WITHOUT HESITATION.  I WILL ORDER AGAIN EVEN WITH THE TUBE ISSUE AS THE PRODUCT INSIDE IS WONDERFUL.</li>
    <li> Very soothing, no taste or smell</li>
    <li> Pity it costs so much to get in the US.  I got an 18g tube at the pharmacy in France (where the product is made) for about $5.  Cost aside, this product is great!  It was recommended to me by the pharmacist because of irritation in the nose membrane and after using for one day the problem was almost completely remedied!  When this tube runs out, I&#x27;ll be buying it here so that I always have some on hand.</li>
    <li> I keep it in my purse and use it to moisturize my generous, full lips. It doesn&#x27;t result in a shiny Vaseline finish, just very moisturized looking, well taken care of lips. Will buy again!</li>
    <li> Read about a star using this daily and she also said in France the makeup artists use this under all their makeup. Makes skin look beautiful and helps to keep away blemishes. I would totally recommend!</li>
    <li> My son had a bad skin irritations from chapped lips and poor hydration. it was really bad. upon applying Homeoplasmine, we noticed a difference right away! I RECOMMEND</li>
    <li> I got this on advice from my homeopathic doctor to reduce inflammation inside my nose. It works. Also, have at times put on my forehead. It is profoundly powerful. Never felt anything Like it. Worth the money for sure.</li>
    <li> I love homeopathics but this product gets a thumbs down from me.It contains vaselinum alba more commonly known as Vaseline or petroleum jelly,with a few homeopathics thrown in.&lt;br /&gt;Vaselinum alba/vaseline is purified and wholly or nearly decolorised mixture of semi-solid hydrocarbons, obtained from petroleum.May look good temporarily but in the long run will dry your skin,all petroleum products dry the skin even though appearing to look moist.</li>
    <li> fab product i use it for my lips and for any irritation like sore noses after a cold , i use it when my skin is sore from skiing and sun and wind, amazing , i have dry skin</li>
    <li> This has been lovely for chapped lips. My husband uses it for his eczema.</li>
    <li> I was excited to read all the great reviews and when i got the product i tried it on myself and everybody else in my family. None of us saw any difference, moreover, it felt like we had put expired vaseline all over our faces and hands. It wouldn&#x27;t  absort at all or soothe or moisturise. Caused a lot of discomfort, couldn&#x27;t keep it on for more than 10 mins. I do not recommend this to anyone. Save your $$$ get some aquaphor or vaseline.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t bought this from Amazon yet but I&#x27;ve been using it for years, this is the best petroleum jelly type product you can get- better than Vaseline, better than Aquaphor, better than Lucas Pawpaw ointment. I use it almost exclusively as a lip balm and can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
    <li> Products is taking care of rough spots,and dark spots on face very nicely.  However all the instructions came in French?? Caled my GP who told me about it and she said I could use it severla times a day. thats all I know??</li>
