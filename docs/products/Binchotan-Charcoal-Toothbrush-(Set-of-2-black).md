      <li>Great experience!!!! :D</li>
      <li>Excellent product.</li>
      <li>Great product!!</li>
      <li>these are great</li>
      <li>Great job Morihata....</li>
      <li>Amazing toothbrush!</li>
      <li>very stylish, and seems effective.  </li>
      <li>The magic of charcoal!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s has nice medium bristles.</li>
      <li>This is a high-quality toothbrush with nice proportions.  </li>
      <li>I feel like I can maneuver it better and reach a lot more places!</li>
      <li>I believe this so companies can sell more brushes and dentists can make money removing tartar.</li>
      <li>but over all I&#x27;m satisfied with product.</li>
      <li>Love, love this toothbrush.</li>
      <li>My teeth feel so clean!</li>
      <li>I am convinced that these two products together is the most effective  system for cleaning, whitening and providing good overall health for my teeth.</li>
      <li>Very non-abrasive and very stylish.</li>
      <li>Comfortable to hold and use.</li>
      <li>This is the perfect toothbrush for individuals who prefer a rather stiff bristle.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I was really excited for this toothbrush.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m even brushing more often i enjoy using it so much</li>
      <li>I noticed some gum irritation go away almost immediately after starting to use this brush which let me know it was a good buying choice.</li>
      <li>Simple build to the handle and a bit pricey at first glance, but it is by far and away the best manual brush I have ever owned.</li>
      <li>Quick shipment.</li>
      <li>I was excited when I received Binchotan charcoal toothbrush, I read most of the reviews prior to making the purchase &amp; I agree bristles are firmer then</li>
      <li>Bristles just the right texture.</li>
      <li>The bristles don&#x27;t wear like other brushes i love these!</li>
      <li>/&gt;Great value and the fact that it&#x27;s murdered out is pretty rad.</li>
      <li>I love the smaller toothbrush head -</li>
      <li>It looks exactly as it does online.  </li>
      <li>Although it&#x27;s great for brushing with a charcoal toothpaste mixture, it doesn&#x27;t have that heavy feel of a normal, higher quality toothbrush.</li>
      <li>I have been using Binchotan toothbrush for two years when I was first introduced to it at a bath shop in Greenwich Village,  NY.  </li>
      <li>Also, the bristles are slightly more firm than I&#x27;d normally prefer, however all-in-all, for a specialty toothbrush, it&#x27;s not bad!</li>
      <li>The slim handle is terrific maneuvering the head to reach all areas of my teeth even in my huge paws.</li>
      <li>what I&#x27;m really use to</li>
      <li>This coupled with food grade activated charcoal and calcium bentonite clay (as a toothpaste) has really helped whiten my teeth.  </li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s absolutely noticeable.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I like the look of the brush, but I think it is important to note that this is not a soft bristled brush.</li>
      <li>These are fairly stiff bristled toothbrushes, but i think that is what helps them be more effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had the old brushes snap pounding them on the sink to remove the paste and this one felt so slim</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this toothbrush along with Earthpaste Natural toothpaste for about 4 months.  </li>
      <li>Wow,i threw away my old brush after using this one for a couple of days.</li>
      <li>they never feel old and gunky like regular toothbrushes.</li>
      <li>From the photos, the Binchotan Charcoal Toothbrush looks quite sleek and modern, so I expected it to feel the same way in my hand as well.</li>
      <li>This brush will last me a very long time since it still looks new after a couple of weeks use.</li>
      <li>At my last dentist appointment, my hygienist (who has been cleaning my teeth for years) commented on how much whiter my teeth were, with less plaque buildup and healthier looking gums.  </li>

    <li> Love, love this toothbrush. Smaller, a little bit firmer.....PERFECT !!!!</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Comfortable to hold and use. Bristles just the right texture. Pleasung to look at as well.</li>
    <li> We got rid of the electric, and now use these. Our Dentist has noticed an improvement in our teeth.</li>
    <li> I was excited when I received Binchotan charcoal toothbrush, I read most of the reviews prior to making the purchase &amp; I agree bristles are firmer then what I&#x27;m really use to but over all I&#x27;m satisfied with product.</li>
    <li> very stylish, and seems effective.  they are hard bristles, though.</li>
    <li> these are great they never feel old and gunky like regular toothbrushes. The bristles don&#x27;t wear like other brushes i love these!</li>
    <li> I like the look of the brush, but I think it is important to note that this is not a soft bristled brush.</li>
    <li> Simple build to the handle and a bit pricey at first glance, but it is by far and away the best manual brush I have ever owned. For those with sensitive teeth, be careful to not brush aggressively. Plaque is removed with slow and light motions as is, and this brush does extremely well at that. I noticed some gum irritation go away almost immediately after starting to use this brush which let me know it was a good buying choice.</li>
    <li> I was really excited for this toothbrush. Unfortunately, I can&#x27;t recommend it to anyone besides a barnyard animal.&lt;br /&gt;The bristles are incredibly stiff. If this were normally described as &amp;#34;soft, medium, hard&amp;#34; these bristles are diamond -- insanely rough.&lt;br /&gt;Life&#x27;s hard, your toothbrush gotta be hard too? No.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you like increased sensitivity to your teeth and the occasional ripped  gum, then the ionic property of charcoal are for you!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Additionally, the quality of the handle severely lacks for a $9 toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Spare yourself the hype unless you want an $18 decoration for your bathroom.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s impossible to buy a stiff toothbrush and next to impossible to buy a medium brush these days.These soft brushes are worthless after a month of use.I believe this so companies can sell more brushes and dentists can make money removing tartar.When i handled this brush i was disappointed it was so slim and the head looked small next to my AA battery operated,thick handled new age brush.It sat on my sink for a few days before i even tried it.I&#x27;ve had the old brushes snap pounding them on the sink to remove the paste and this one felt so slim i thought it wouldn&#x27;t last a day.Wow,i threw away my old brush after using this one for a couple of days.It&#x27;s has nice medium bristles.Just don&#x27;t use a lot of pressure if your afraid of removing the hardest substance in your body.It doesn&#x27;t collect and hold any paste.No banging on the sink.The slim handle is terrific maneuvering the head to reach all areas of my teeth even in my huge paws.I&#x27;m even brushing more often i enjoy using it so much and my teeth feel much cleaner with the tarter slowly going away.This brush will last me a very long time since it still looks new after a couple of weeks use.When i break out the second brush i&#x27;ll be ordering another set.Great job Morihata....</li>

    <li> My teeth have never been cleaner though.  The magic of charcoal!</li>
    <li> Great product!! Quick shipment. Great experience!!!! :D</li>
    <li> This coupled with food grade activated charcoal and calcium bentonite clay (as a toothpaste) has really helped whiten my teeth.  These are fairly stiff bristled toothbrushes, but i think that is what helps them be more effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I&#x27;ve been using this toothbrush along with Earthpaste Natural toothpaste for about 4 months.  At my last dentist appointment, my hygienist (who has been cleaning my teeth for years) commented on how much whiter my teeth were, with less plaque buildup and healthier looking gums.  I guess when you work on teeth for that long, you notice these things.  She was amazed!  I knew she would be.  That&#x27;s why I brought both the toothbrush and toothpaste along with me that day to show her.  I am convinced that these two products together is the most effective  system for cleaning, whitening and providing good overall health for my teeth.</li>
    <li> I orded two but only received one.</li>
    <li> Amazing toothbrush! My teeth feel so clean! Very non-abrasive and very stylish. I love the smaller toothbrush head - I feel like I can maneuver it better and reach a lot more places!</li>
