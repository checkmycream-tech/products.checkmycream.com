      <li>These bottles DON&#x27;T leak, are small and attractive.</li>

      <li>They look really pretty and sturdy.</li>
      <li>At first we didn&#x27;t know how to refill it.</li>
      <li>these bottles are pretty adn they have never once got clogged.</li>
      <li>Exactly as described.  </li>
      <li>They are in my purse(s) and have never leaked a drop even though I am kind of rough with my bags</li>
      <li>These are just little bottles that don&#x27;t allow for easy transfer of your favorite perfume.</li>
      <li>I love the idea that you can take the glass bottle out of the container and see how much perfume you have left.</li>
      <li>The funnel that comes with them works great;  surprisingly no spills.  </li>
      <li>The spray on these bottles is also large too.</li>
      <li>I even drove to Colorado with them, forgetting to take them out of my purse, and the altitude up in the mountains did not affect them too much...</li>
      <li>These bottles are much prettier than the picture.</li>
      <li>But two days into use the spray stopped working, not worth the hassle to return it, Will just twist the top to get oils out.</li>
      <li>I love keeping perfume in my purse, but even the smallest perfume bottles are heavy.  </li>
      <li>I love these little sprayers!  </li>
      <li>but you need to open it first, then take out the bottom part of the bottle(remove</li>
      <li>They do not leak and they spray a nice even mist if you press all the way down, or they release a little sprinkle of perfume for your wrist if you lightly press down.  </li>
      <li>As it is, I can use&lt;br /&gt;it for perfume, but not for hair spray or any product that requires a fine mist instead of small droplets.</li>
      <li>I like this product for the fact that I travel quite a bit and its always easy to carry these travel atomizers rather than big perfume bottles that gets heavy.</li>
      <li>Overall, great buy for me at the last minute when something went wrong.</li>
      <li>the initial spray was harsh, but they worked fine after and again to my surprise, they still did not leak.</li>

    <li> Bought these for my daughter and she just loves them. She&#x27;s into perfume now and loves being able to bring her favorite scent with her. They&#x27;re really cute too!</li>
    <li> Exactly as described.  great size for purse -- i would buy again! does not leak -- easy to use -- take those bigger bottles of perfume and pour (or squirt with funnel) into this great little atomizer.  and cute!</li>
    <li> These atomizers have a classy and elegant appearance. I love the idea that you can take the glass bottle out of the container and see how much perfume you have left. Price is also great. Certainly worth the price.</li>
    <li> Love that I can take my favorite perfume with me everywhere without having to lug the big ass bottle around.  I also love that it&#x27;s glass so that it would leech into my perfume!</li>
    <li> This is a great travel bottle for oils.  But two days into use the spray stopped working, not worth the hassle to return it, Will just twist the top to get oils out. If you are looking for a spray bottle, I would look else where, but this a great travel bottle.</li>
    <li> This was not what it appeared to be. These bottles are just perfume holders. They are not the kind that allow the user to spray into it underneath from another bottle like real atomizers. These are just little bottles that don&#x27;t allow for easy transfer of your favorite perfume. There wasn&#x27;t even a return form or order form in the package either. Wouldn&#x27;t buy from here again.</li>
    <li> I love my perfume bottles. Easy to transfer into portable bottles and no leakage. Love to be able to fresh in up while I&#x27;m out. Convenient, fun and worth it!!</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re great and I love them!  They are in my purse(s) and have never leaked a drop even though I am kind of rough with my bags and they are tossed around a lot! They are also very pretty, even prettier than the picture.</li>
    <li> One of the bottles broke (would not spray anything and leaked everywhere) after just the first use! Not worth it!</li>
    <li> Despite having read the reviews, I decided to try these out. They worked great at first, very cute, but after 4-5 uses, it stopped spraying and started leaking. I tried taking them apart and putting them back together, they just leak. Pretty disappointed.</li>
    <li> These bottles DON&#x27;T leak, are small and attractive. The actual bottle (inside the metal canister) is glass and has a tight seal to help prevent leaks. I can&#x27;t decide whether to give one as a small gift or selfishly keep them both for myself.</li>
    <li> I love these little sprayers!  The funnel that comes with them works great;  surprisingly no spills.  They do not leak and they spray a nice even mist if you press all the way down, or they release a little sprinkle of perfume for your wrist if you lightly press down.  I carry both in my purse all day and they get knocked around, and they still do not leak.  I have had them for a few months now, and they still work great! I even drove to Colorado with them, forgetting to take them out of my purse, and the altitude up in the mountains did not affect them too much... the initial spray was harsh, but they worked fine after and again to my surprise, they still did not leak.</li>
    <li> These bottles are much prettier than the picture. They&#x27;re about the size of a tube of lipstick and they didn&#x27;t leak.</li>
    <li> I was getting this as a present for my sister. I got everything and it was perfect! She loved it very much. At first we didn&#x27;t know how to refill it. but you need to open it first, then take out the bottom part of the bottle(remove the decoration/plastic from the glass case).</li>
    <li> I read the reviews, but I&#x27;ve not had any issues with leaking of the ones I&#x27;ve received. They are super cute and work perfectly. I keep on in my purse and it&#x27;s not shown deep wear of the colors/metal.</li>
    <li> Okay for perfume.  It makes perfume droplets that you spray, the bottle is refillable and has a nice&lt;br /&gt;outer case that is pink or silver, and you can remove the glass bottle from it to refill.&lt;br /&gt;The bottle stays well in its case, being tight-fitted.  I give it 2 stars because it was called an&lt;br /&gt;atomizer and I was expecting a fine mist spray so I could put hair spray in it.  As it is, I can use&lt;br /&gt;it for perfume, but not for hair spray or any product that requires a fine mist instead of small droplets.</li>
    <li> these bottles are pretty adn they have never once got clogged. I use them for purfume as well as body sprays.</li>
    <li> I love keeping perfume in my purse, but even the smallest perfume bottles are heavy.  It&#x27;s easy to put the perfume into the bottles and the atomizers are very light for carrying around.</li>
    <li> Ordered these after one of my perfume bottles broke, and there is still some perfume in there. I didn&#x27;t want it to go to waste. These bottles are the perfect size to carry around in my purse. They&#x27;re even very pretty too, a lot prettier in person than in the picture. The pink bottle is a little darker than what is shown in the picture, but I still like it. The funnel is great too; glad that was included in the purchase. The spray on these bottles is also large too. I would advise spraying yourself at a good distance, otherwise you might get some perfume in your eye or mouth. Overall, great buy for me at the last minute when something went wrong.</li>
    <li> Found what i was looking for. Very cute packaging and it came with a droplet and cone for easy transfer of perfume. :) love them!</li>
    <li> They look really pretty and sturdy. Nice quality item but I was not able to open them! Maybe I am just too (well let&#x27;s not say it) but instructions would have helped me.</li>
    <li> I liked them... I rearlly recommend it to other.. like the funnel which came with this making easy for refilling</li>
    <li> The bottles were very cute, and easy to fill, but they both stopped working within a couple of days of use.  The pumps would not move at all, and I ultimately had to move the contents to another bottle.  Complete waste of money.</li>
    <li> The container is a bit smaller than I realized but it works well and gives a full, strong spray. I have to refill it often which is a bit of a pain since my perfume bottle doesn&#x27;t come apart--I actually had to spray it into an alternate container and fill it from there. I would prefer it had one of those filling spouts that you just connect to your perfume bottle&#x27;s spray tip.</li>
    <li> I like this product for the fact that I travel quite a bit and its always easy to carry these travel atomizers rather than big perfume bottles that gets heavy.</li>
