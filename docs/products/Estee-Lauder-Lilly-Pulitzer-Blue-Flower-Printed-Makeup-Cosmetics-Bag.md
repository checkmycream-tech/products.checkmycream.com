<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Perfect if you carry a HUGE purse like me. Keeps all my cosmetics and necessities stylishly organized. The pattern is very cute and I&#x27;ve received many compliments.</li>
    <li> Not meant to hold much make up, so I use this bag for brushes and sponges and q-tips and tweezers and small little tools like that. Very ideal for a lot of smaller items</li>
    <li> I love the print of my new Lilly Pulitzer Blue Flower Printed Makeup Cosmetics Bag. It is made of great quality material. I use it alone with some other size Lilly bags to organize my makeup and accessories. It is a great function for that job. I would recommend a person trying a couple of sizes of the bags instead of just trying to get one. It is hard to tell if that size is the right one for you. And we really made good use of the extra bags we purchased.</li>
    <li> Great to make-up, to put your medicine when you travell.&lt;br /&gt;To organize all different things in your bag! Love Love!</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s slightly bigger than expected, but I like it.  The inside is BRIGHT pink.</li>
    <li> Very roomy.  Seems to be good quality.  I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple months now and iys still in great shape</li>
    <li> Perfect! just what i was looking for. perfect space and good quality! fits all of my make up without being crammed</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great. This makeup bag is small but big. It appears small but it can fit so much. I love it and it&#x27;s so cute.</li>
    <li> not good and not bad, just a cheap bag.</li>
    <li> The Estee Lauder Lilly Pulitzer Blue Flower Printed Makeup Cosmetics Bag is pretty and functional.  It will hold a lot of cosmetics or other things.  It has a zip top opening.  I keep it in my purse to carry papers, letters I have to mail, my lunch, pens, and other things I don&#x27;t want to be floating around in the bottom of my purse.  This cosmetics bag helps me to keep everything very organized in my purse.  Although it didn&#x27;t cost very much, the seller assured me that it is a new bag and not used.  It&#x27;s very well made, and I love it!</li>
    <li> This was a gift for my granddaughter which work out perfectly.  Holds a lot and since this was the first time she got her own personal makeup.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love it! It was a lot bigger than I expected and was such a fabulous price! Best makeup bag I&#x27;ve ever bought!</li>
    <li> This has to be the cutest bag. In love with it!</li>
    <li> very good product with good finish big in size and many thing can be stored i would like to buy if in other color or design</li>
    <li> Works so well for using on the beach for phones, keys, sunscreen and so much more. Works well for traveling</li>
    <li> Nice shape &amp; large enough to carry small &amp; large size makeup products.&lt;br /&gt;Made well &amp; light to carry. Won&#x27;t soil easily.</li>
    <li> fits a lot of stuff from makeup accessories to all other stuff and its good quality great buy for anyone</li>
    <li> This bag is larger than it looks so check sizing..At first I didn&#x27;t know what I could possibly fill it with...Now I throw everything in it!! Pretty and nice quality.</li>
    <li> Big enough for all of my makeup (I use lots of products, I&#x27;m a junkie). Looks exactly as pictured, very cute.</li>
    <li> It is a very nice carry for makeup or whatever, but I would have liked much better if it had a handle. Very good size and made of very good quality material. Anyone but I would probably love it.</li>
    <li> Great makeup bag. I have gone threw many and a lot of them I hated because I couldn&#x27;t fit in all of my makeup brushes. I found the perfect bag.</li>
    <li> Such a gorgeous bag and so spacious too! So glad I bought it!</li>
    <li> Elegant, roomy, water-proof lining, great value for the price. I have purchased this repeatedly, both for myself and to give away as gifts. Just fill it up with lotions or beauty items and it&#x27;s a hit as a gift.</li>
    <li> This is my new favorite makeup bag the picture is pretty but in person it is much more prettier a good size bag to fit your makeup the colors are so pretty with Blue,yellow and a light green the inside is Hot Pink.The quality of this is excellent and I plan on ordering more for friends .This is a 5 star cosmetic bag .</li>
    <li> Very pretty and plenty of room.</li>
    <li> So cute love it. I get many compliments on it.</li>
    <li> I love this bag. I thought it was going to be too big because of some of the reviews I read but I feel like it&#x27;s the perfect size. It&#x27;s cute too!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great as a clutch.</li>
    <li> Simply wonderful. Love the interior hot pink lining! Looks expensive and well made. Hold a lot of makeup too. I&#x27;m happy :)</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a little bigger than I had expected; I&#x27;m not really good with measurements, so that is not a reflection on the item itself. I&#x27;m mentioning it for those out there like me, it&#x27;s big enough to store a couple of bananas and a few grapefruit...not that you&#x27;d use this to store fruit...sorry, I really suck at this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anywhooo, it is exactly as described and pictured (except it is larger than you&#x27;d think basing it on the pic). It&#x27;s good quality and no weird smell (I&#x27;ve occasionally received beauty accessory type stuff that had a funky smell).</li>
    <li> Love this make up bag! Bigger than i expected wich is great! Love it!</li>
    <li> small hole in one of the bags, very cheap looking, would not recommend, will be returning items for a refund</li>
    <li> The bag looks exactly like the photo. When I received it, the bag was huge. I&#x27;m not complaining it&#x27;s just a little bigger than an standard makeup size bag. More the size of a small purse. Overall, I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> So I have gone through this phase of buying these make up bags as gifts. This bag is pretty and spacious for people who go out with a mini make up station in their bags, and also a nice bag for storing your own make up. Great quality bag and lovely colors too. More of this please !</li>
    <li> This makeup bag is very cute and it is a nice large size that can easily fit a tote, or in my case a diaper bag lol. All of my makeup brushes and makeup and moisturizer fit in it and I absolutely love the bright colors!</li>
    <li> This is so adorable&amp;#60;3 My boyfriend gave me money and told me that I could buy whatever my little heart pleased and when I bought my new pursed I had to buy a cute makeup bag&amp;#60;3 This is so adorable, the inside is a hot pink and is huge. It&#x27;s so cute and girly, I&#x27;m in love with this&amp;#60;3 I&#x27;m being honest if you want a cute makeup bag this is worth the buy :D</li>
    <li> This was larger than I expected, but my fault for not reading the measuresments.  The colors are great and quality is decent as far as cosmetic bags go.  I am still loooking for a great purse size though.  Keeping this for travel.</li>
    <li> Perfect size and beautifully made.</li>
    <li> Beautiful and spacious makeup bag. Easy to find items, and it holds everything I need. The color and print are true to the picture, and even look better in person.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my girlfriend and she loved it! The build quality is excellent and it&#x27;s stylish as well! Great price too!</li>
    <li> It did take long to get here that&#x27;s why the 4 stars but besides that the makeup bag was just what I wanted yes its big but so is my MY purse so it fits nicely</li>
    <li> Good quality, great bag for the price.</li>
    <li> Very pretty on the outside, very practical on the inside. The bag is lined to contain accidental leakage. It is a nice size to take on a short trip, or to fill with essentials then tuck into your larger handbag.  It is narrow enough that your bottles do not tip over and shift around as they do in a rectangular cosmetic bag. Under $3...a bargain!</li>
    <li> Adorable pattern! Bought these as a gift for my bridesmaids and filled them with everything they might need, they were a huge hit! Still use mine today to store my makeup. Would recommend!</li>
    <li> Very pretty with plenty of storage.</li>
    <li> Love this bag! Its a little larger than expected but its perfect. The inside is bright pink. So much prettier in person</li>
