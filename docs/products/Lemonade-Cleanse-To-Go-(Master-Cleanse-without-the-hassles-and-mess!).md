      <li>think this a good approach to a fresh start</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m sure homemade</li>
      <li>I absolutely LOVE this product.</li>
      <li>One packet does not satisfy my hunger in the morning, so I start with two at a time and use 1-3 more before dinner.</li>
      <li>I am on Day 3 of the cleanse, and feel much better.</li>
      <li>I did love the ease of the packets.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s so easy to take to work and makes the whole cleanse a more pleasant experience.</li>
      <li>is way more nutritionally sound.</li>
      <li>Having the packets made this extremely easy.</li>
      <li>Easy</li>
      <li>You could easily get the ingredients and make this yourself if so inclined to do this type of detoxing.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s interesting because everytime I drink the stuff I feel full for almost 2 hours.</li>
      <li>Thanks for making it easy to stay on course, the results were amazing.</li>
      <li>then it&#x27;s better to make all of your lemonade fresh.</li>
      <li>Quick and easy way to bring it with you.  </li>
      <li>Taste was not bad - spicy lemonade.</li>
      <li>Because of this product, the cleanse is easy and I really recommend it!</li>
      <li>I bought the entire kit, and specifically the \\&quot;sticks\\&quot; (packets) are just amazingly convenient.  </li>
      <li>I think it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
      <li>something like a cleanse is so intense that it could have been any number of things that affected me, but I definitely did not have a good experience using this.  </li>
      <li>\\&quot;That gets you nowhere near the goal of a healthy weight that you can maintain foreve</li>
      <li>it was so convenient to be able to get the right mixture of nutrients to complete the cleanse.</li>
      <li>Even with healthy diet and exericse, I quickly gained back a couple of the pounds I lost.</li>
      <li>/&gt;But...the point of the master cleanse is to give your body a break from pre-made processed products, and I couldn&#x27;t help but think that even though this was made from good ingredients, I was still missing out on the perks of using fresh lemons, syrups, etc.  </li>
      <li>I received this product very fast.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t see any results and I followed the plan exact.</li>
      <li>I can continue to stay with my Cleanse plan while I&#x27;m at work, all I need is hot water.  </li>
      <li>this is not an effective product, and they don&#x27;t even give you enough in the box to complete a week.  </li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t done a cleanse and haven&#x27;t really dieted</li>
      <li>/&gt;Actually went really well.</li>
      <li>It tastes just like I made it myself and very convenient for my on the go life.</li>
      <li>On the plus side, I travel a lot and found this very convenient to use while away from home.</li>
      <li>Not the products fault, just the result of the fast.</li>
      <li>Didn&#x27;t really work  for me.</li>
      <li>However, who has that much time on their hands?</li>
      <li>Really wasn&#x27;t for me....</li>
      <li>it was more of a sense of missing the activity/routine of eating.</li>
      <li>When I finished I almost did not want to start eating again, &amp; was very conscious of what I did eat.  </li>
      <li>and that is what this busy working mom needs!</li>
      <li>Developed in the 1940s, the Master Cleanse diet has seen numerous revivals, most recently through adherents such as Gwyneth Paltrow and Beyoncé.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m the kind of person who wouldn&#x27;t do the full cleanse just because of all the dirty dishes and citrus peels to compost.  </li>
      <li>Overall, this is a quick fix for losing a couple pounds before a big event--but, don&#x27;t expect the pounds to stay off of you!</li>
      <li>now of course anything fresh is better but this still works, I lost 40lbs in 21 days, these packets are definitely expensive but that is the price of convenience,</li>
      <li>Next time I&#x27;ll go back to taking the time to prep it all fresh.  </li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t have a good cleanse experience while on this product and actually had to stop early since I was feeling so ill.  </li>
      <li>anyone who has done the original master cleanse would agree that the preperation and clean up was the worst part of the cleanse, I do recommend this product to all who want a easy to do cleanse.</li>
      <li>I have used it numerous times to do a lemonade cleanse and it has made it possible for me with my busy lifestyle.</li>
      <li>There&#x27;s no excuse for getting off the Cleanse with this around.  </li>
      <li>I understand the purpose of the Master Cleasne the natural way however when your work long hours this is the way to go.</li>

    <li> The master cleanse works, you just have to stick to it, now of course anything fresh is better but this still works, I lost 40lbs in 21 days, these packets are definitely expensive but that is the price of convenience, anyone who has done the original master cleanse would agree that the preperation and clean up was the worst part of the cleanse, I do recommend this product to all who want a easy to do cleanse.</li>
    <li> I understand the purpose of the Master Cleasne the natural way however when your work long hours this is the way to go. Please bring the 10-day and 14-day kits.</li>
    <li> Do u have to hang out by the bathroom all day? I want to try it but nervous about having to void constantly.</li>
    <li> Handy packets but did not work for me.</li>
    <li> A lot of money for not a lot of product. On the plus side, I travel a lot and found this very convenient to use while away from home. The taste is ok, nothing like homemade and I&#x27;m sure homemade is way more nutritionally sound. The jury is still out on whether or not I would purchase this again.</li>
    <li> This is great if you&#x27;re not at home to make your Cleanse.  I can continue to stay with my Cleanse plan while I&#x27;m at work, all I need is hot water.  There&#x27;s no excuse for getting off the Cleanse with this around.  No measuring, cutting lemons, squeezing...just pour the packet into your glass and fill with water.</li>
    <li> This tasted great! When I was on the go it was so convenient to be able to get the right mixture of nutrients to complete the cleanse. Great product. Thanks for making it easy to stay on course, the results were amazing.</li>
    <li> Yuck! Much worse than the fresh version But ultra convenient</li>
    <li> Does what it&#x27;s meant to do, but after a few days, you&#x27;ll want to rip out your tongue, because it just makes you gag. Not the products fault, just the result of the fast.</li>
    <li> I use it for mini cleanses during the week. One packet does not satisfy my hunger in the morning, so I start with two at a time and use 1-3 more before dinner. Good energy, good taste. Easy and that is what this busy working mom needs!</li>
    <li> Tastes almost identical to homemade</li>
    <li> Diets come and go, but some come back. Developed in the 1940s, the Master Cleanse diet has seen numerous revivals, most recently through adherents such as Gwyneth Paltrow and Beyoncé. The idea is simple: Consume nothing but several glasses of water flavored with lemon juice, maple syrup and cayenne pepper. Throw in a nightly laxative and a little salt water, and repeat for up to two weeks. The diet is supposed to detoxify the body and promote weight loss. Diet experts see two problems with this: One, there&#x27;s no behavior modification to keep weight off long term; and two, it can be dangerous. Lofton said that consuming only liquids for a long period of time could deprive the body of needed nutrients and lead to dramatic changes in blood pressure. Quebbemann said he just doesn&#x27;t see the point. \\&quot;You can take anybody and put them on something - a supplement or six glasses of lemon juice per day - that gives them an upset stomach 24 hours per day and they&#x27;re going to lose weight,\\&quot; he said. \\&quot;That gets you nowhere near the goal of a healthy weight that you can maintain foreve</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t see any results and I followed the plan exact. I would much rather just make the stuff myself next time like I have in the past. I did love the ease of the packets. I would like a refund....waste of money.</li>
    <li> There is no substitute for the actual cleanse. However, if you don&#x27;t have all your supplies or time, this is a good substitute.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great. I am on Day 3 of the cleanse, and feel much better. The stuff that is coming out of me is scarry. Will do this again in a couple of months.</li>
    <li> I received this product very fast. It was really good. Save me a lot of time from having to make it from scratch.</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE this product. I have used it numerous times to do a lemonade cleanse and it has made it possible for me with my busy lifestyle. No more lemons, maple syrup and cayenne pepper to carry around everywhere. Thank you!!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. It&#x27;s just like it says on the box. I haven&#x27;t done a cleanse and haven&#x27;t really dieted so I was nervous. Also if you aren&#x27;t good at sticking to things this make it easy. I really enjoyed this product and will buy again when my stock runs out. It&#x27;s interesting because everytime I drink the stuff I feel full for almost 2 hours. After that I can drink water until the next mix and I have lost weight!!!!</li>
    <li> I was very impressed with this product. Having done this cleanse from scratch quite a few times, this tasted just like the real thing.&lt;br /&gt;I can keep some in my purse and make it at work very easily!</li>
    <li> Product does not work. There was no &amp;#34;cleansing&amp;#34; that took place. I used all of the packets and i have not had a movement sense.</li>
    <li> Really wasn&#x27;t for me.... Didn&#x27;t really work  for me. I followed the instructions and still didn&#x27;t see a difference in my body or my energy level. Everyone&#x27;s body is different and sadly this one didn&#x27;t agree with me</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong, this product simplifies the process of prepping the master cleanse, and gives you a way to go to work without carrying around bottles of pre-made lemonade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But...the point of the master cleanse is to give your body a break from pre-made processed products, and I couldn&#x27;t help but think that even though this was made from good ingredients, I was still missing out on the perks of using fresh lemons, syrups, etc.  I didn&#x27;t have a good cleanse experience while on this product and actually had to stop early since I was feeling so ill.  That doesn&#x27;t necessarily mean that it was the fault of this product--something like a cleanse is so intense that it could have been any number of things that affected me, but I definitely did not have a good experience using this.  I&#x27;d say I used this about half of the time, and fresh ingredients the other half.  Next time I&#x27;ll go back to taking the time to prep it all fresh.  I think it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;ve ever done the Lemonade Cleanse, you will not be dissapointed in these little &amp;#34;to go&amp;#34; packets. I&#x27;ve read all the books, and I know that if you decide to go on the cleanse then it&#x27;s better to make all of your lemonade fresh. However, who has that much time on their hands? I don&#x27;t! These are a great substitute. The flavor isn&#x27;t too bad... I&#x27;ve noticed it gets a bit more spicy the longer you let the drink mix sit in water. Overall, this is a quick fix for losing a couple pounds before a big event--but, don&#x27;t expect the pounds to stay off of you! Even with healthy diet and exericse, I quickly gained back a couple of the pounds I lost. But, I wasn&#x27;t looking for a miracle but a two-day fix. Great product, just go into the purchase knowledgeable and keep your expectations at a minimum. After ten days drinking these, I lost almost 11 lbs. I gained almost 7 lbs immediately after transitioning out of the lemonade cleanse, but I expected that. It was a good jump-start to my summer bikini season.</li>
    <li> No more cutting and squeezing dozens of lemons, measuring sticky syrup and cayenne pepper!  It&#x27;s so easy to take to work and makes the whole cleanse a more pleasant experience.</li>
    <li> Quick and easy way to bring it with you.  I like them and use them even at home for convenience.</li>
    <li> Did the cleanse for 5 days, but without the salt water treatment. Had been through series of cortisone injections and felt like I needed something to get me cleared out and on track again. A kickstart. Read all the reviews, heard multiple warnings from my family, etc. and decided to try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Actually went really well. I scheduled 3-4 periods of drinking 10 oz and then sipped from a bottle during the in-between periods.  Was not hungry- it was more of a sense of missing the activity/routine of eating. Had a few periods of feeling tired, but nothing major. By the third day I had reduced the number of ounces per day. Having the packets made this extremely easy. Taste was not bad - spicy lemonade. I actually liked it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the end, I was alert and my digestion was clear-felt great. The one post-cleanse symptom I had was tooth sensitivity. Next time I do this I will take vitamins.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think this a good approach to a fresh start - I came out of it with a stronger mind set, reduced appetite, happy digestive tract, and great energy. When I finished I almost did not want to start eating again, &amp; was very conscious of what I did eat.  I lost some weight, &amp; definitely got rid of the unwanted residuals of the cortisone treatments.</li>
    <li> did what I thought it would</li>
    <li> It tastes just like I made it myself and very convenient for my on the go life. Love it! !</li>
    <li> This product is way over priced or what it claims to do.  You could easily get the ingredients and make this yourself if so inclined to do this type of detoxing.  However I didn&#x27;t find that this product was helpful in doing that.</li>
    <li> I bought the entire kit, and specifically the \\&quot;sticks\\&quot; (packets) are just amazingly convenient.  It&#x27;s a really good sweet/spicy drink and dissolves quickly and I don&#x27;t have to worry about the cleanup.  I&#x27;m the kind of person who wouldn&#x27;t do the full cleanse just because of all the dirty dishes and citrus peels to compost.  I&#x27;d want to, but I wouldn&#x27;t follow through.  Because of this product, the cleanse is easy and I really recommend it!</li>
    <li> this is not an effective product, and they don&#x27;t even give you enough in the box to complete a week.  if you want to do the cleanse, just get the ingredients and follow the recipe. additionally, when you open these pouches, the dusty smoke cloud that comes out is cayenne pepper, makes your eyes run and makes you cough. advise against purchase.</li>
