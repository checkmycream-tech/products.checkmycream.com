<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I can see result within 2 wk.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing!! I love it. Purchased it about 3-4 weeks and i saw my results in like 2 days!! I use this where i&#x27;ve had razor scars for almost a year. 2-3 times a day sometimes in conjunction w a scrub, only cause I just really want the scar to be gone. I tried soo many different products and nothing has worked as effectively or as quickly as this! I will be repurchasing soon, not cause mine is out (still have half the bottle left), but because I don&#x27;t ever want to have to go without it!&lt;br /&gt;Btw: I&#x27;m African American :)</li>
    <li> For the past year I had continuos problems with in grown hairs.  Due to the problems with in grown hair it was leaving scars so you can imagine my frustration.  After trying PFG I really don&#x27;t  have any more problems with in grown hairs!!!!  I really do love this product.  It works.</li>
    <li> Caucasian female with med/light complexion. Iv&#x27;e been using this product for about a month the way that it was recommended (2x a day after exfoliating with St. Ives Apricot Scrub), and it has helped fade the dark marks. I don&#x27;t think it has helped too much with the ingrown hairs however. I am still getting them, but not as many as I was. That being said, I&#x27;m still happy with the product! Dark marks are hard to fade and this has done that.</li>
    <li> It kind of leaves a greasy feel to your face afterwards. I did notice less ingrown hairs after using it, but they are back as soon as I stopped.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only been using it for 5 days and it has worked wonders! My chin hair grows dark and coarse, so I always get ingrown hairs. This product is already working; making them grow out straighter.&lt;br /&gt;If this matters, I&#x27;m African American (+ some other stuff, lol) with light red toned skin and dark, thick hair.&lt;br /&gt;- I exfoliate with a salicylic acid cleanser first; use a face sponge&lt;br /&gt;- I apply the product and let it dry. About 5-10 minutes while I brush my teeth, etc&lt;br /&gt;- I follow up with moisturizer and/or make up routine. (I haven&#x27;t noticed any adverse reaction to mixing products, but I&#x27;m also not highly sensitive to anything. If you have sensitive skin, you should be using one product line to begin with and maybe only use this at night when you&#x27;re going to bed and won&#x27;t be following it up with make up or sunscreen, etc).&lt;br /&gt;- I do this twice a day; in the morning before work and at night after the gym.&lt;br /&gt;My results have been amazing. I haven&#x27;t had any new ingrown hairs and the irritation bumps are gone!  My hair is actually growing in slower too.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll keep using it twice a day until the scars are completely gone (I have two really dark ones that have lightened a LOT with this product) and then I will go to using it just once a day, and then only when I remove hair.&lt;br /&gt;More info: I used to shave and got tired of doing it everyday (sometimes twice a day), so I started tweezing and everything was smooth for almost two weeks and then I got crazy ingrown hairs and bumps as the hair grew back in. I am shaving now, as the instructions suggest, but I will try tweezing again when everything is cleared up. Most likely in the next week or two, with how fast this is working.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s super affordable. Try it!</li>
    <li> Made my skin peel where applied unfortunately. :(</li>
    <li> This is a great product.  I used it for a couple of weeks and did notice that I wouldn&#x27;t get all those red bumps from razor burn and my dark spots (scars from ingrown hairs, which I am prone to) were starting to light and go away.  It does sting slightly when applied, but it&#x27;s worth it since it works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I took away one star since the seller didn&#x27;t list that you cannot use while pregnant or nursing.  Since I&#x27;m still nursing, I&#x27;ve had to stop using it and I am now applying lemon juice to my legs instead. (The lemon juice contains a lightening agent and citric acid which works like a chemical peel. Not as strong, but it&#x27;ll do for now.)</li>
    <li> This works amazingly!!</li>
    <li> To those who are looking for a product to help with ingrown hairs and discoloration, this is the product.  At first I was very very skeptical. Then read all the reviews and decided to try. I most say this product has been helping my skin (EVERYDAY) for about 14 days now. I wax and tweeze less. So glad I purchased.</li>
    <li> This product works so well for me! I use it only on my bikini line and in two weeks I&#x27;ve noticed a significant difference. I use this product twice a day and wait a few minutes before putting clothes on so it can dry a bit. This product does not have a strong or noticeable scent in my opinion which is a plus. The changes I&#x27;ve noticed are improvement in dark spots, less ingrown hairs, and even reduced regrowth of hair in the area. The only negative aspect is that my skin has been peeling in the area recently. I will be adding a gentle exfoliant and moisturizer in the area in order to improve the skin. I would highly recommend this product and will certainly buy again.&lt;br /&gt;P.s. product comes in a container less than 3 oz so I can travel with it as well.</li>
    <li> I get Brazilian waxes monthly and very sensitive to the wax well the removal of hair itself and I used this in between waxes and has prevented ingrowns and anything else. I am very happy with the product. I wish it came in a bigger bottle and was a little cheaper but by far is the best product on the market for this purpose. It also even&#x27;s skin tone and has really made it a lot more bearable between waxes.</li>
    <li> Very good product!! I am african american dark complexion and with everything you have to be consistent. I bought this product back in January after struggling with ingrown hairs and the dark spots that they leave on the bikini line (very embarrassing) for a long time. So I came across this product and said why not? And I can say after using this CONSISTENTLY over the last six months it has worked wonders!! After waxing and using this product I do not get ANY ingrown hairs! It is really amazing and all the dark spots have virtually gone away. It did take a while and this product does cause peeling, but with exfoliating with St. Ives with a little bit of tea tree oil, then this product and vitamin E or almond oil after it definitely helps with the peeling and makes my skin feel amazing! I would absolutely would recommend this product to anyone!!</li>
    <li> It really fades your dark marks</li>
    <li> I write this ruefully to say that this caused my underarms and bikini areas a bad allergic reaction. Looks like contact dermatitis -- dry, itchy, scaly skin. I really wanted to like this because it worked well for the first couple of months. It&#x27;s just too abrasive for long-term use. I saw another reviewer get the same allergic reaction after using it for some time as well. Be careful</li>
    <li> I get ingrown hairs easily and this really seems to help.  It also says it helps lighten dark spots from old ingrowns, but maybe I haven&#x27;t been using it long enough to see those results.  I have really sensitive skin and I had no allergic reaction to this.  However, I can&#x27;t stand the smell (this is just my personal preference).</li>
    <li> So i&#x27;m not sure what it is about this stuff that works.. but hell yeah!! I also suffered from those unsightly red bumps on my bum and within a week they were mostly gone!! Then I waxed my fae and usually I get unsightly ingrown hairs and nada!!! I love this stuff!! I&#x27;ll be buying this for the rest of my life for sure. I can proudly wear those tiny bikinis at the beach again! No more little towle wrapped around my waist :D</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not gonna lie, this is a product that do actually works. All you have to do is just follow the direction and use it wisely.</li>
    <li> The instructions say results in 2 months. After 3 weeks I noticed a difference. I only had a peeling problem in the first week maybe only with in a few days. I use it on my bikini line. I use the product twice a day. I had red marks from ingrown hairs, a few were raised. After 3 weeks I noticed a difference. Bumps were gone, redness was faded significantly. It&#x27;s been more than 2 months and my skin looks so much better, not 100% perfect but much better. I think because of the strength/lightning formula it has left my skin lighter than the rest of legs but, tanning more will help that. The product did do what it said it would do, for that I am happy. I suggest using a self tan, will help even out your skin tone (I&#x27;m a white girl).</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t do reviews, why bother when most time you know what you&#x27;re getting or it&#x27;s at least bearable but I have to say, so far I&#x27;m more than impressed. It has been only 13 hours since I first applied this to my bikini area and already I&#x27;m noticing less irritation and less redness. Of course it&#x27;s not gone, I wouldn&#x27;t expect that from a product that says it can take up to two months to work but I would say it has gone down by AT LEAST a third in just one day. This just might be that miracle I thought I&#x27;d never find.</li>
    <li> This is a game changer!  I have been doing electrolysis on my face for the past two years.  I&#x27;m very light in complexion and get horrible ingrowns.  My chin and neck always looked broken out, UNTIL I DISCOVERED THIS PRODUCT!. I could cry, I&#x27;m so happy with the results.  Worth every penny ladies,  I hope they never discontinue.  I&#x27;ve tried tend skin and there is no comparison.</li>
    <li> This product is sent from heaven ! I tried every product and home remedy but this product works great and has improved my bikini area amazingly. I will definitely be buying another bottle soon, because it&#x27;s worth every penny.</li>
    <li> Wonderful results, addicted to the smell :)</li>
    <li> It may take a month to see results but so far so good</li>
    <li> This product is amazing!! Completely clear in TWO WEEKS!!! Marks and ingrown hair GONE!! I am SO HAPPY!!! Buy this!!!</li>
    <li> Works good not as great as I thought it would but will continue to use it</li>
    <li> some of my ingrowns actually popped out on their own, this is an excellent product, but it has a pretty strong smell and your skin starts to flake off after a day but thats exactly what&#x27;s supposed to happen.</li>
    <li> I am African American Male and suffer from razor bumps.  Before purchasing PFB I had tried pretty much everything for treatment for my razor bumps sadly nothing really had much of an effect on helping tame them until PFB.  So far since using PFB my razor bumps have pretty much disappeared and has help lighten up my skin from razor bump blemishes.  I would recommend PFB to anyone who suffering from razor bumps</li>
    <li> Does as advertised. Nice scent. Did not irritate my sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> You have to use it a while but it does its job applied daily!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried damn near everything. This works!</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t noticed a difference in the regular off but I&#x27;m not a consistent user. I just use it a couple days before and after waxing. Never get ingrowns when using it.</li>
    <li> Happy with the results so far... No ingrown hairs, no raiser bumps. Also smells good</li>
    <li> I use this item daily since I started getting Brazilian waxes. Decreased the razor bumps, and made it easier to removed razor ump hairs that were stubborn. I use twice a day after each shower. It does tingle at first application but no irritation. I have noticed some peeling of the skin, I think from the salicylic acid. Which has reduced my hyperpigmentation . I will  continue to use and purchase this item again!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m African American Woman and get ingrown hair in the bikini area. Just start using about for three weeks and I notice a difference. Will be reordering.</li>
    <li> This product may work. I don&#x27;t know because it smells so bad I must stop using it. You know when someone sprays floral air freshener after the annihilate the bathroom? This smells exactly like that. And the smell does not go away. It doesn&#x27;t fade. So if you apply this in the morning, it smells the whole day long. so really, it just can&#x27;t be worn. People will avoid you.</li>
    <li> LOVE this product. It dries out any blimish in its early stage. Great for keeping the cystic acne spots from blowing up. Also great to use in between bikini wax&#x27;s to help control ingrown hairs.</li>
    <li> This product doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
    <li> It was exactly what i wanted and shippement was quick!</li>
    <li> excellent seller A +&lt;br /&gt;THANK YOU</li>
    <li> helps with ingrowns for sure- great exfoliator. hopefully will rertore my skin within the next two months completelty</li>
    <li> So far I love this product. Only had it for 2 day and I can tell a difference already.  My skin is peeling and I can see the lightning effect.  Makes me feel so much better because adult acne is looking to be a thing in the past.</li>
    <li> I typically use tend skin. This stung a LOT less but I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s as solid as a product in my opinion.  Yes it stings less but it takes longer to get rid of red bumps that razor burn leaves behind</li>
    <li> This product is beyond amazing! Before i started using this product, i had really bad ingrown hair on my chin from waxing and shaving. It was horrible. There were big, bumpy, painful, and hard to miss, even with tons of concealer! I did some research, and chose this product. Barely, two weeks after, the ingrown bumps had dried up, and looked much better under makeup. I have been using it for about 4 weeks now, and my skin is significantly clearer! It&#x27;s a little slower at lightening  up the discoloration, but i&#x27;m just grateful the bumps are gone. Be patient, at least finish the bottle.  It does cause skin peeling, so keep a good exfoliator on deck. Also, the smell is pretty strong. It has like 5 different alcohols in it, so its pretty pungent. Overall, great product! I think i&#x27;ll order another one when im done with this one.</li>
    <li> Skin on my face/neck started peeling after only using twice a day for a couple weeks. Crazy the difference it makes and the new skin it reveals. I&#x27;ve been suffering with dark spots and ingrown hairs for at least 10 years now. Love this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this product for almost 2 weeks and I&#x27;m seeing results already. The dark spots under my arms and on my legs (between my legs) are disappearing due to folliculitis which I&#x27;ve been struggling with for years....I&#x27;m extremely happy I found this product; I&#x27;m looking forward to the weeks that lays ahead for even better results so I can finally feel comfortable wearing shorts.....I cant wait until next summer!!!!!</li>
    <li> Been using this product and wasn&#x27;t expecting it to work but as of recently I haven&#x27;t seen any ingrown hairs on my bikini area and I have noticed some change in that area also. Good thing I brought 2 at the same time or else I&#x27;d be out of luck waiting on more</li>
    <li> this product is exceptional, I personally saw results within 2-3 weeks, I no longer have issues with ingrown hairs and the scars are lighter, highly recommend!!</li>
    <li> I like this stuff.  However, it smells like glue and even feels like it too because it leaves a slightly sticky residue. But other than that, it works pretty well. The razor bumps I had on my stomach and pubic area are gone! its very smooth, and bump free now and the scars are vanishing. Good stuff(: Try it!</li>
    <li> This did not work at all. It burns, but that&#x27;s about it. Don&#x27;t rely on this, no matter what anyone tells you.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t commend on the lightening aspect of it, but it definitely did help with bumps. I will, however, caution you if you are using it after shaving -- it burns as hell if you use it after you shave or even a couple days after (which may seem ironic as you are trying to use it for razor bumps). Really wish it came with an added numbing agent in the ingredients to help with the burning, which is why I&#x27;m knocking off a star.</li>
    <li> Great product that actually works. The only downside is that it turns flaky after it dries. I suggest applying at night and washing it off in the morning.</li>
    <li> Came on time its working great</li>
    <li> Did not really expect this product to work to be honest but I have to say that it is amazing. I know I&#x27;ve still got a way to go but the results are good so far..in such a short time. Will definitely recommend and will be buying more😄👍</li>
    <li> great product my bumps were gone or almost going in less than a week</li>
    <li> It doesnt really combat ingrown hairs but it does work as a mild chemical peel if you have mild hyperpigmentation. I got a brazillian and had really deep ingrowns that lead to scarring. This didnt help with either but i dont dislike the product. If you have MILD scarring and razor burn this can work great for you. Just be aware that your skin will start to peel. And it will burn post shaved skin. Thats why i gave it 3 stars instead of 4-5</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a black woman that shaves constantly. I have used this product for over a year now and it works wonders and doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin like other products had in the past. It really does diminish the scars dramatically with continued use. Awesome product!!</li>
    <li> It doesnt work at all, it doesnt clear up razor bumps nor does lighten dark areas.&lt;br /&gt;Will never buy again.</li>
    <li> This stuff really works! Helped heal up the razor burn quickly and dark spots.</li>
    <li> I will order another one as soon as I am done with this one.&lt;br /&gt;I stopped getting ingrown in my bikini area and on my legs.</li>
    <li> Very good for razor bumps/ingrown bumps. Lightens the skin a bit, not enough for my conditions. I bought this product twice.</li>
    <li> I liked this product much better than the more expensive cream I was getting from European Wax Center. I have no ingrown hairs this time around.</li>
    <li> Love this product it helped me so much</li>
    <li> Did not work for me at all</li>
    <li> It works. Don&#x27;t worry about what you are seeing at first. After couple of weeks your skin will start to clear up.</li>
    <li> Excellent product saw results immediately. Word of advice do not use this product after removing hair it does stings. But great results!</li>
    <li> Definitely feel that this product reduces razor or shave bumps I&#x27;ve also notice dark spots lightening it does cause peeling and can be a little tacky when first applied otherwise it&#x27;s a overall good product.</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome. I shave my arms and that leaves behind the worst ingrown hairs I&#x27;ve ever seen. It got pretty bad recently and I was too embarrassed to wear short sleeves outside. It&#x27;s summer in Oklahoma right now and it was just a miserable time. So I looked up how to get rid of them, read about this, and tried it out. And I must say... It&#x27;s perfect. No more gross bumps! It&#x27;s not immediate (well, I used it one time on my bikini area and haven&#x27;t had anything since, but...), but it really does work. I&#x27;m so happy with it. I feel a lot more confident. Just be sure to moisturize and you&#x27;ll be good to go. :)</li>
    <li> Rec&#x27;d on time and, so far (2 days), like the product - does what it says</li>
    <li> This product is awesome!  Has worked perfectly for me.  I am African-American and had dark spot in my bikini area from failed laser treatments (I was burned!!) and years of shaving.  I now get my bikini line waxed but the dark spots remained.  I also constantly got ingrown hairs. I have been using the PFB Vanish + Chromabright for about a month now and the results are phenomenal.  No more ingrown hairs and the dark spots are basically gone!  I couldn&#x27;t be happier.  Looking forward to my trip to Playa Del Carmen Mexico next month and wearing my bikini without hesitation.</li>
    <li> Seems effective under my arms. The fragrance of it seems to get sour shortly after applying. I can smell if overly perfume.</li>
    <li> Great product and it really works.. I always had insecurites about my dark spots in my bikini area from ingrown hairs and from me using this product fora month already I have seen my dark spot fade. I so happy I will be repurchasing again</li>
    <li> Been using this product for over a month now. Haven&#x27;t noticed much ingrown hair change. I still have them around the perimeter on my bikini line. I have noticed that the dark spots I once had around my inner thighs has lightened. I really wish I could have fast acting results like some of the stories I read about their ingrown hair problem. I&#x27;m also an African American female, that tends to have thicker, coarser hair follicles. Almost done with the bottle, will buy one more to see if that will do the trick.</li>
    <li> Made my areas darker, but the hair is slowing down</li>
    <li> So i keep my &amp;#34;feminines&amp;#34; completely shaved and used to have a fair amount of anxiety about my bikini line in the front because it was noticeably darker at the thigh, but after using this product just a few times I can feel confident without a cover-up/skirt, plus it prevents any in-growns!  I think it&#x27;s a super-strong astringent and that&#x27;s how come it prevents in-growns (dries and thins the very thin top layer of skin so the course edge of hair follicle will break through) so i&#x27;m a little concerned it won&#x27;t bleach out the colour of any fabric it comes into contact with.  I shake up the bottle and roll it on after my shower, and try to let it dry before getting dressed. Noticeable results using just once a week for three weeks.</li>
    <li> I stumbled upon this product when &amp;#34;googling&amp;#34; products for ingrown hairs. Even with proper exfoliation, shave gels/creams/lotions, fresh/clean/sharp razors, etc., I have a major problem with ingrown hairs (legs, underarms, &amp; bikini area). I have tried going with the grain, against the grain and every way between. I always end up with tons of ingrown hairs. It was not always this way. When I was a teenager and even when I was in my 20&#x27;s, I rarely had issues with ingrown hairs. Now that I am in my 30&#x27;s and after having the bumps/red spots exposed on my legs/underarms/bikini area, along with the ugly (minor) scarring on my bikini area from trying to get those ingrown hairs out, I decided enough is enough. When this product arrived, I immediately applied it (after showering without shaving) to my underarms and bikini area. I repeated the next day and the next day. I decided to shave my underarms (after 3 days) and I rolled on the serum afterwards and then put it on again the next day and the next day. I know, you are like come on, get to the point... Well, instead of my usual 7 or more ingrown hairs under each arm, I only have 1 under my right arm today. Just one. It just so happens to be the troublesome follicle I have come to loathe for years, but even so, it is not nearly as painfully ingrown or as terrible as it was. My underarms look better &amp; more even toned/brighter. As for my bikini zone, I have noticed that the serum has helped the ingrown hairs come out. I have not attempted to shave there just yet, but I believe the results will be just as good as with my underarms. Bottom line- the serum is affordable, it is easy to apply and it works for me... Hopefully it will work for you too.</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin so after shaving or waxing I would get really bad bumps everywhere but after using this product I never get bumps anymore and It made the bumps I had before go away! Really recommend this product</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t do anything for me. Not sure if its because i&#x27;m not using it properly, and if anyone has any other feedback or comments to help, but i have a lot of dark spots in my bikini area and they look exactly the same after a month of using the produce twice a day.</li>
    <li> I have always had very sensitive skin, and have tried numerous hair removal methods such as sugaring, waxing, and shaving. Bottom line, my skin reacts to all. Therefore, I was desperate to find a product that would help with ingrown hair and this works! I am African American and I can state that this works well with our skin. I use it twice daily and have been for two months. I can honestly state that I noticed results within weeks, and my esthetician did as well. I am so relieved to have finally found something that works for me. Overall, I am very happy with this product.</li>
    <li> If even laser treatments fail, you cant expect much from this product&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t waste your money&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does nothing really, didn&#x27;t see any brightening effect or any change in ingrown hair&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not sure what it does but smells awful</li>
    <li> Helped! (I think). No bad reactions, and I have really sensitive skin. I can&#x27;t even use Aveeno. And I have no more ingrown hairs. yay</li>
    <li> Spectacular!!!! Great product i love the results!</li>
    <li> Works amazingly, however there&#x27;s a slight stinging sensation but I&#x27;ll take that over ingrown any day!</li>
    <li> Both my spouse and I use this product with positively satisfactory results. As the bottle describes, it has worked great on razor-bump troublesome areas, reduces post-waxing ingrown hairs, and most definitely diminishes the &amp;#34;dark spots&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product works great, even for those who suffer from sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first, we both thought it was a costly product, but the solution is quite potent, and a very small amount goes far. We believe this quantity will last 12 months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely purchase this product many times over, as well as recommend it to anyone having trouble with pesky ingrown hairs, or dark blemishes. Be forewarned, however, this cannot be used near, or around, the eyes--it is a very powerful solution, and may be optically harmful.</li>
    <li> Yep, I agree with everyone else.  It does as it claims.</li>
    <li> I have tried everythingggggg and spent hundreds on different products but this has been the one and only product that has worked.</li>
    <li> This product really works!  I&#x27;ve been using an Emjoi to remove hair on my legs and it left them with dark spots.  I started using this product and it has faded the dark spots on my legs to the point where they are almost not visible.  I will continue using this until I get the end result that I want.  This product is a Godsend!</li>
    <li> Unlike others, I really like the smell.  It&#x27;s a green tea fragrance and levels off a lot after it dries.  I find that it takes a while to dry.  It appears to work by increasing the rate of skin cell renewal and I imagine that the various components have some anti-microbial properties as well.  You should exfoliate regularly and moisturize.  It has salicylic, glycolic, and lactic acids which I often read about as being recommended for post-waxing.  It seems to be helping and is more cost-effective than some of the other brands.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t really have much high expectation since the product explains clearly that it takes awhile for it to work. I&#x27;ve used it twice a day for a week and I was peeling!! Not like you&#x27;ll get an instant whitening results but slowly and gradually. I used it on my bikini area and my underarm, I have really stubborn spots from pimples &amp; ingrow hair.</li>
    <li> This is the first review I have ever written.  This product is incredible.  I have incredibly sensitive skin and am very prone to ingrown hairs after waxing/shaving, esp. around my bikini area.  I have tried other ingrown serums, but nothing has been effective.  I have only been using this for a few days, but am already seeing significant results.  Red and dark spots from old ingrowns are fading, and ingrown hairs are coming out to the surface.  I am very excited to see the results of a few more weeks of use.  If you have any trouble with ingrown hair I definitely recommend you try this.</li>
    <li> This product is awesome. No more bumps around my bikini area. Will be purchasing more</li>
    <li> helped with underarm respiration.  made my underarm sore after the 5th use.  i dont have dark armpits, now, theyre very unsightly.  The redness like ringe surrounding my whole armpit turned black, Ingrown hair is still a problem</li>
    <li> I am an adult African American female with very coarse curly dry hair. Every time I shaved no matter the region I would get an ingrown hair which would later become inflamed and infected. After popping bump after bump very dark unattractive and embarrassing scars began to appear. I went from waxing, to shaving, to epilation, and still had the same results! I even looked into laser hair removal as a way to permanently rid my body of those embarrassing marks. Let me remind you I AM NOT a person paid by this company to write this review or an employee. Within 2 weeks of using PFB + chromabright twice a day along with exfoliating once a day everyday the marks began to quickly disappear and I couldn&#x27;t spot one ingrown hair!! In fact my whole bikini area began to lighten. I really want to thank this company for putting out such a great product and I encourage every female with ingrown hair/dark spots to try this!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve seen a big change and I&#x27;ve only been using for about 2 weeks now. I&#x27;m brown skinned and when I shave its horrible. I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This product didn&#x27;t work for me. For me this profuct started to peel of my skin and I decided to stop using it.</li>
    <li> the best so far... it really works</li>
    <li> This is my first Amazon review ever. I gave this product 5 stars because I bought it about 2 weeks ago, and my hyperpigmentation due to ingrown hairs on my jawline/ neck area are about 43% reduced in coloring and thickness (some were raised scars).&lt;br /&gt;I am so happy. The product make your skin peel, and this is what causes the lifting of skin layers. My skin is pretty oily, so I don&#x27;t notice the peeling much. I also wear scarves everyday because Im in the midwest. I exfoliate every couple days just to help the process along, but it is working great. When you roll it on, it tingles and has a strong but pleasant peppermint smell. I don&#x27;t know if the &amp;#34;chromabright&amp;#34; is contributing to my results, because I&#x27;ve never tried the product without it, but I am inclined to think so. It leaves kind of a matte sticky residue that wears off and I can&#x27;t smell the product on myself after the initial application. But with my current results, I cant wait to see my skin when I finish the bottle. I use it twice a day per the instructions due to my severe scarring.</li>
    <li> Works so well! Everything that it said it would be! Glad I finally found this product, no matter what style of hair removal, with this product  I have smooth skin.</li>
    <li> I have purchased this product twice now and could not be happier. I used to have very dark corse hair especially in the bikini area and was embarrassed and could not wear a bikini ever, and shaving made it even worse. But since I started using this product the hair around my bikini line is almost completely gone. It took almost two bottles of this but it was all worth it. I would recommend this product to everyone I know. It is amazing.</li>
    <li> works great on bumps behind the neck</li>
    <li> This product was recommended to me from a friend. I have tried different ones with almost no result. Over all I like this one. It does  the job. When I don&#x27;t use it I am covered with ingrown hairs. When I use it I only have a few. However it dries the skin a little after long use.</li>
    <li> Feels great , been using it constantly for almost two years and I&#x27;ve personally seen no difference . I stopped using .</li>
    <li> This is no joke! It really works</li>
    <li> Holy crap! This worked, really really well. I am super happy I took a chance and bought this product. I got a Brazilian and received a mother of an ingrown hair, puss all the gross stuff and it&#x27;s on my vag, so now it looks like I have an std! Not having money for a doctor I got this and bam! It lightened the skin, becuase it had gotten a dark spot Bc of the ingrown hair, and the pain stopped... and my skin is back to normal, thank goodness!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m Mexican American and have a medium skin tone... to give you perspective.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had a few extremely stubborn ingrown hairs in my bikini area that has bothered me for almost a year. I&#x27;ve tried exfoliating, tweezing, applying acne cream, you name it. They would not let up. But a twice daily application of this wiggled them out in about a week. It&#x27;s a little drying though and I don&#x27;t have anything to say on brightening yet (I&#x27;ve only yet seen a slight difference- but be advised the package says it might take months for the brightening effects to work), but so far it&#x27;s been doing well in treating my ingrowns! I wouldn&#x27;t stop exfoliating just yet, though. This isn&#x27;t the miracle cure everyone hopes for.</li>
    <li> Hasn&#x27;t worked for me. Still have terrible ingrowns. :(</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing. I&#x27;ve only been using it a week and I am glad that I took my aestheticians recommendation and bought this product.</li>
    <li> This product was an ingrown lifesaver. I am glad to have found this. Made the week after electrolysis so much less painful.</li>
    <li> Works really well! but when it is applied it burns more than i would like it to on the first several applications. Afterwards, it&#x27;s not much of an issue. If u stop applications for a long while the burning sensation is more likely to occur again. Oh and i almost forgot to mention that it doesnt smell good, but it does the job very well. I used these for several years before trying shaving oils, so now i dont need this product anymore. Overall it works very well and leaves your skin clean and super soft</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t buy this product!!! After I used it for about three weeks (and loved it in the beginning as the results were great at first) my skin started to peel like after a sunburn. I&#x27;ve heard that this is a common side effect so I wasnt worried but I stopped using it to give my skin a break. However, the peeling didn&#x27;t stop, it actually got worse. Whole batches of skin came off, I am left with only a very thin layer of red bruning skin. Anyone seen the episode in Sex and the City where Samantha gets a chemical peel and the skin of her face peels off? That is what my intimate area looks like right now! Although I havent used this product in almost two weeks now it keeps getting worse. The doctor advised me to use hydracortisone 1% to help my skin heal. It is such a nightmare, I cant even wear underwear anymore because my skin is too sensitive. Wearing a bathingsuit or going into the sun (or making love) is all out of the question. I just want it to be normal again, has anyone experienced something similar and knows when it is going to stop??</li>
    <li> Best stuff on the planet!</li>
    <li> This stuff stinks. and its the gift that keeps on giving. somewehre between chemicals and sour wine. but, with consistent use i&#x27;d say the stuff works. no real notice of skin brightening but looks like a smoother shave to me. I&#x27;d say it was worth it, maybe the one without chromabright would smell different, at least it will save you some money. I dont regret the purchase :)</li>
    <li> The product is okay, but I feel like PFB Vanish alone (no Chromabright) was more effective in preventing ingrown hairs post-waxing, which is obviously the point. Moreover, three months later and using it nearly every morning, I haven&#x27;t noticed anything in the way of skin lightening. Next time I&#x27;ll go back to the original version.</li>
    <li> It started working about 2weeks after I started using it. I&#x27;m an AA female and my underarm discoloration was unsightly. I alternated between it and my deodorant after about 3-4wks of use because I needed the extra dryness protection and nice smell from my deodorant. I currently still alternate and use it about 3-4x/week. Consistency is key! I can now raise my underarm and show off my bikini line without ingrown hair or discoloration issues!</li>
    <li> This works!! I had terrible ingrowns along my chin/jaw line which were beginning to scar. I&#x27;ve been using this twice daily for 2 weeks or so now &amp; I see a tremendous difference. Pretty much right away the ingrowns stopped &amp; I can see the scars gently fading now. I have notice a slowing in my hair growth also, not sure if thats related or not, but welcome nonetheless! I wouldn&#x27;t do without this product going forward.</li>
    <li> I have razor bumps from shaving before I bought this product. I used this product the same day that I received it and it worked like miracle. The razor bump was gone the next day. It has a mint smell and feel, I love the smell too. It also brightens the area that I use it on by exfoliating and revealing a new skin. I use it on my bikini and underarm area. No more itchy skin from shaving sticks. I so love this product!</li>
    <li> Been using and did see some peeling with a hint of change but still not enough to make a raving review about. I may change my star rating later once the bottle is gone depending on if I see a difference or not. Not irritation though so that is good.</li>
    <li> Lightens dark marks caused by acne.</li>
    <li> Perfect product. It really works. I recomend it for you if you have problem with you skin.</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t work as well as I hoped. The bottle says it can take up to two months to start working so I ordered another bottle to see if it&#x27;s going to really work. I found that the Bliss pre-soaked pads really worked for me but they are expensive. I will update my review in another month &amp; let you guys know if it starts to work once the full two months has passed.</li>
    <li> Nothing about this product is true,it leaves your face very sticky and does not remove any dark spots.What a waste of money</li>
    <li> Arrived earlier than expected. Long time PFB Vanish user (great stuff), first time trying Chromabright. The smell of this product is definitely better than the original.</li>
    <li> Iv been using this Product for week it&#x27;s Awesome it works. Iv had Razor bumps on the back of my Arms for ever and now there Finally there going away.</li>
    <li> Items came rather quickly. Still waiting to see results. Product says use 4-6 weeks to see results. So far so good.So far so good.</li>
    <li> Does work but takes time.</li>
    <li> Has a strong alcohol smell but hasn&#x27;t done anything for my boyfriend</li>
    <li> Swear by this product...never fails.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t work, it seems that the product sent to me is old.</li>
    <li> My shipment got lost at the post office :( so I ended up ordering one from ebay. But let me tell you this thing works!! After years of waxing, shaving and epilating I had some bumps and razor burns around my bikini area but after using this for only a week, I&#x27;m seeing results. The only thing I don&#x27;t like is that it makes your skin a bit dry and might even make it peel at first but it&#x27;s nothing a little exfoliating can&#x27;t help. I can&#x27;t tell if the skin is any lighter but it definitely helps with the ingrown hair.</li>
    <li> I am really prone to ingrown  hairs. I normally use a different product, but the &amp;#34;roll on&amp;#34; appealed to me. It took awhile, then kicked in. I am getting far less. so, I am pleased and would recommend this.</li>
    <li> This has helped. I don&#x27;t use it every day mostly because the bottle says to use it after hair removal (I don&#x27;t do that every day) plus at 26 bucks a pop....eeehh it has helped.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product not only for the bikini area, but also on the back of my upper arm to combat the &#x27;bumps&#x27; aka folliculitis.  I can&#x27;t tell you how awesome this product is and that it actually works.  I have very sensitive skin and it does not irritate at all.  I&#x27;m hooked!</li>
    <li> I like it, it works if you use it consistently.  Negative note...it takes while to dry off.  This product WILL stain your clothes if you don&#x27;t let dry off completely.</li>
    <li> Works wonders, love it. Made my face smoother and lighter.</li>
    <li> Really works. Fast shipping. Will buy again.</li>
    <li> Great product! Works!</li>
    <li> I have spent years, and years trying almost every product known to treat ingrown hairs. I would get embarrassing ingrowns all over my bikini from waxing, and even leaving it natural! And shaving was probably the worst I have ever done! I got an ingrown in every single hair follicle every time I shaved down there! It was so embarrassing and left me with dark scars everywhere. My skin is just so sensitive nothing worked to get those hairs out. I started using PFB and after a few weeks I have not had one ingrown!!!!! Not one! And my scars are already fading! This product is a little sticky(but dries after a few minutes) but doesnt sting badly(just a tiny bit at first). The roll on makes this so easy i take it in my purse so that I am never without it! And if using as much as I do(twice a day) the PFB will make you peel a bit. But you have to remember this is all part of helping the ingrowns come out. A little peeling every once in a while is so minuscule compared to the effects it leaves your skin with. I am honestly just so thankful I found this product. It had gotten to the point I just wouldn&#x27;t wear bikini bottoms anymore because they were honestly so embarrassing. I am a cheapo and hate spending money on expensive products, but for this product I would honestly spend up to $200 (that is really how amazing it is and how drastically it has changed my skin!!!) for this! If you have never tried this I am telling you it is amazing! A MUST!</li>
    <li> Great for in grown hairs</li>
    <li> i DID LIKE THIS PRODUCT IT DID WHAT I BOUGHT IT FOR, AND YOU DO HAVE TO USE IT CONSISTANTLY TO SEE THE RESULTS</li>
    <li> I am an African American female who has extremely sensitive skin. This product is the best for your bikini area. I use it to help with my skin after waxing. I really recommend it.</li>
    <li> I would have it 5 but your skin does peel after using this I have no ingrown hairs even the bumps are home it does lighten up the scar mark of ingrown</li>
    <li> Only recently bought this product, so far it&#x27;s working but the bottle said to wait 2 months and I&#x27;ve only used it for 2 weeks. Will update.</li>
    <li> It worked, no adverse reactions, however it requires patience. The results happened but over the course of using the product for a month.</li>
    <li> I am so happy with the change I&#x27;ve notice in 2 weeks...i had to stop because my skin is peeling right now but i will start bac again soon...i use it 2 times a day and I try my best to avoid washing...i will be ordering more as soon as i run out</li>
    <li> This is a good product. I have used just plain PFB Vanish without Chromabright and to be honest, I can&#x27;t say I see a huge difference between the two. Both work wonderfully against ingrown hairs, but I haven&#x27;t seen any improvement with \\&quot;skin lightening.\\&quot; The scent is certainly different-- pretty pungent. This product is effective against pseudofolliculitis barbae and I&#x27;ve seen great results within 5-7 days of daily use. I&#x27;ve tried other products and the PFB Vanish brand is my favorite.</li>
    <li> It works!  It does help with ingrown  hair and skin lightening as it claims. Truth to be told, I would give it 4.5 stars if I could because it doesn&#x27;t entirely solve the problem of ingrown hair but it makes a HUGE difference.  I epilate my legs, bikini and for years have been suffering from ingrown hair.  This stuff combined with Anthony Logistics for Men Ingrown Hair Treatment Hair Removal Products make my skin look MUCH better.  It&#x27;s easy to apply and there will be no waste (unlike with some other products).  It&#x27;s clear and almost odorless. One roll lasts for about 3-4 weeks using it once a day.</li>
    <li> I simply cannot live without this product. Anything in drug stores simply doesn&#x27;t compare. Within hours, the inflammation, bumps, &amp; itchiness is gone; within days, the ingrown hairs fix themselves (no more horrible digging) and the scars or skin discolorations fade. CAN&#x27;T LIVE WITHOUT</li>
    <li> I wish all cosmetic problems had a solution as simple and effective as this one! I recently started getting regular &amp;#34;nothing down there&amp;#34; waxes and The first ome I had about a hundred bitty whiteheads sprout up down there! It was painful, ugly and embarressing. So I went on Amazon, did some research and ordered this bottle. Next wax? I used this regularly and had about maybe seven. Huge difference!! Additionally I can feel and see a difference in the number of ingrown hairs, evenness of skin texture, and discoloration is already fading. I would recommend this to everyone!! I have über thick hair that usually comes with two hairs to the follicle so ingrown hairs used to be common to me. I actually think I&#x27;m going to miss my sessions of unearthing those ingrown follicles. This product is a life changer!</li>
    <li> Really helps ingrown hairs and fades and heals marks. Will order again. It does last awhile though. It&#x27;s an easy roll on.</li>
    <li> I was hopeful that this product would be great as reviews elsewhere have been so positive however after 2 days I had to stop using it as it started to sting. Not sure if this is the actual product as it didn&#x27;t come in a box. Very disappointing and a waste of money</li>
    <li> The first few times I used it, I thought it did a good job.  Since then, it hasn&#x27;t done anything at all.  Perhaps it disinfects any pimple/in-grown areas as it has an alcohol smell and sting, but otherwise, doesn&#x27;t work for me on my face or bikini area.</li>
    <li> I used for 2 weeks , I don&#x27;t see much difference with in grown hair.</li>
    <li> I am plagued by ingrown hairs. Plagued. If I shave, I get them, if I wax, I get them even worse, if I epilate, even worse.&lt;br /&gt;They last for weeks and leave red marks that last longer. I think I have tried every product and remedy and approach to hair removal with limited or no result on my persistent in grown hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Until this magic stuff right here.&lt;br /&gt;I gave it 4 stars because it hasn&#x27;t eradicated the ingrown hairs but here is what it has done:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Greatly reduced the number.&lt;br /&gt;Completely eliminated large ones.&lt;br /&gt;Eliminated redness, so the ones I have are virtually invisible.&lt;br /&gt;Eliminated discomfort since none are huge.&lt;br /&gt;Tremendously reduced the healing time.&lt;br /&gt;Also, when used under arms it works as an antiperspirant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me this is fairly life changing. This means more skirts, &amp; not telling people \\&quot;they&#x27;re mosquito bites.\\&quot; When they ask what happened to my legs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a product it is simple to apply and has a light lemon grass, melon, cucumber sort of scent.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve experienced little irritation from use. It is an exfoliant so I&#x27;ve had some light peeling but only in the inner thigh area.&lt;br /&gt;It does not sting, but it does have a warmth when applied to damaged skin. It&#x27;s kind of a whiskey warmth. Not painful.&lt;br /&gt;It absorbs quickly and I&#x27;ve noticed no residue on skin, oiliness, or stickiness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me, this has been absolutely worth the price. If I find that over time, it loses efficacy I will update this review, but at this point I am thrilled to have discovered this. I wish I&#x27;d had it 10 years ago.</li>
    <li> Great product. Really works. I see a difference after 1 week.</li>
    <li> This has brightened my skin a little and is good with ingrown hairs.</li>
    <li> Applied everyday this product seems to work as sold.&lt;br /&gt;I does work slowly but does seem to work very well.</li>
    <li> Works wonders! Skin does peel though, sort of like a sunburn. But... it&#x27;s nothing a little exfoliation can&#x27;t fix. Definitely worth $20. No more ingrown hairs and lightened scars!!</li>
    <li> I used this product years ago on an ingrown hair I had. It helps so much for in grown hair. I haven&#x27;t been looking out for lightening of the skin but it definitely helps for ingrown hair.</li>
    <li> Works and smells great. Takes care of razor burns over night. Easy to put on. No mess and greasy  feeling.</li>
    <li> I feel like I have tried them all. THIS is the only one that actually lasts long term. It is also super easy to apply.</li>
    <li> Has saved me from ingrown hairs. It is a life saver. However, I do not know if it is as good when it comes to lightening the dark marks. If it does after a month, I will change the review to 5 stars.</li>
    <li> this stuff is great. works fast - i only needed a few days</li>
    <li> I really like this product! I used under my arms and could tell the next day after one use that my underarms weren&#x27;t as dark!!!</li>
    <li> Im on my second bottle and ive been seeing results from bottle one. Even though the results are minimal its far more than i have with other products. Its a slow process but really works with ingrown hair and brightening the marks that can leave.</li>
    <li> I SO wanted this to work, but unfortunately, it really did not improve my terrible breakout of red spots and ingrown hairs after a waxing gone wrong. This item received rave reviews by so many! I just think mine were SO bad that this stuff just couldn&#x27;t combat it. Perhaps it&#x27;s something that takes a lot more time to show good results....</li>
    <li> This really reduced the redness associated with razor burn. Smells great. It says its for men and women but as a woman I dont think men would like the scent on themselves.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing - if you happen to get ingrown hairs on your neck from shaving, this stuff will almost immediately stop them.  Took about a week to get rid of existing issues and, when used every day, stopped new problems from showing up.  This is my third purchase of this stuff and it is totally worth giving a shot!</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t noticed any difference yet but it&#x27;s been only 3 weeks now.</li>
    <li> Amazing. Does what it says. Brightens skin and loosens ingrowns, even reduces overall hair reappearance (for me, anyway). Skin does peel quite a bit, but exfoliating takes care of that. Don&#x27;t forget to moisturize, especially on your face.</li>
    <li> I have only used this a few times a week over the recommended two month period but I&#x27;ve already seen great results. It does take time but this is an excellent product. Full disclosure I am American american, I have curl hair, curly beard hair and this almost always causes razor bumps when I use a regular razor. I finally switched to an electric razor to reduce the amount of razor bumps I kept getting but needed a product to clear up some of the scarring caused by disposable razors (I still use a straight razor infrequently to clean up anything the electric razor can&#x27;t get to and to shape up my hairline and beard.) Regardless I have less razor bumps but I still experience razor bumps (best way to deal with them when you do get them is with a tweezer and a patient girlfriend :). I purchased this product because I have alot of scarring on my neck and needed something to help lighten the dark spots and further reduce the razor bumps I get even though I predominantly use an electric razor. This product does the trick exactly as needed. It lightens the area very slowly so that you can mitigate the bleaching while smoothening the skin and reducing the bumps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When other reviewers mention flaking being an issue they neglect to tell you that the flaking is actually a good thing. Not only is it caused by the vetting of unhealthy skin, and the replacement of newer healthier skin. But persistent bumps and dry skin covering ingrown hairs are what is flaking off and the more you use the product the less the flaking occurs since your skin is getting healthier and healther over time and there are less dark spots,dry skin patches, ingrown hairs, and razor bumps to flake off. Much thanks to whomever made this product, I&#x27;m a happy customer and will main one.</li>
    <li> I have tried several products for ingrown hairs. I found this to be the best one. A friend of mine who is a licensed esthetician recommended it as well. However, during the process, I noticed a lot of dead skin in the afffected area of the hairs. I didn&#x27;t use the product for one apppication. I simply washed the area with my Mary Kay Cleanser and used Mary Kay Moisturizer afterwards. I have had less problem with the peeling skin. The ingrown hairs and discoloration are actually disappearing, but it is highly important to follow the manufacturer&#x27;s directions. If the area is really affected, you can use more than one application per day. Overall, I love this product!!!:)</li>
    <li> I must say that this is one of the best products that I have ever used.  I was a skeptic at first but after only one week I began seeing dramatic results.  I have been struggling with facial hair for a very long time so over the years and through various forms of hair removal methods, it has drastically scarred and darkened my light brown skin.  Needless to say I have tried everything including chemical peels which only assists in helping the resulting problem but not the actual problem.  So I am very happy that I purchased this PFB product and I am sold for life!!!</li>
    <li> Gets rid of ingrown hair instantly, but it smells terrible</li>
    <li> As a person of color, it is common to get ingrown hairs when you don&#x27;t take extra care when shaving. The great thing about this product is when I get ingrown hairs it is easy to roll on the liquid and with in 24 hours it is diminished leaving no scars at all. I will always keep this product on hand.</li>
    <li> Still have the same problem , marks are even more visible</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t seen it do much yet in terms of skin brightening; however it does do a great job of clearing up any ingrown hairs in the bikini area.  does cause some peeling. follow with good moisturizer.</li>
    <li> The product is excellent and the cheapest I found and delivery was much earlier than I expected. It took two days when my confirmation email said about two weeks. Thank you Amazon for your fast delivery.</li>
    <li> Does what it says it&#x27;ll do. Saw results after only 2-3 days.</li>
    <li> I have yet to see the overall result.  i&#x27;ve been using for 1 week now and although it keeps your skin dry (which you can prevent by using lotion or moisturizer), you can see the little red bumps are actually disappearing.</li>
    <li> This product is awesome. Stopped using it after a couple of weeks because started seeing result! it worked wonders. Would repurchase again when run out of it and would recommend to a friend as well. After using it for a while, it started drying my skin a bit, thus leaving some dead skin in the areas I used it, a side effect expected from this type of product. Nothing that can&#x27;t be solved with an exfoliating sponge!</li>
    <li> Item arrived on time. Love this stuff.</li>
    <li> It made my skin peel.I honestly didn&#x27;t see the bumps disappearing after using it for two weeks.Maybe it was just me.</li>
    <li> Works wonders! Ordering another bottle.</li>
    <li> Received shipment promptly, packaged well and as expected. Works wonderfully so far</li>
    <li> If you have done something to irritate your skin, waxing, shaving, epilate, over scrubbed, etc., anywhere on your body or face this stuff makes your skin look so much better.  I have super sensitive skin.  I use an epilator and when I am finished I use this product.  My skin feels soft and smooth and does not look irritated and I have a lots less dark spots or ingrown hairs when I use this.  But there are three drawbacks 1) The smell.  The smell doesn&#x27;t last a long time but I am not a fan of the smell.  The results however are worth it.  2) There can be a slight sting at first, but I swear it is not that bad; and quickly disappears.  3) The price.  I wish it cost less but it does work.  Ladies you can easily use this under tinted lotion or makeup as it smooths out your skin and whatever you put over it, if anything is need at all has a smooth surface to cover making your face look lovely.</li>
    <li> I like it! I think it helps with ingrown hair esp armpits.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing. I got this recommended to me by my friend that was recommended from her waxer to help with ingrown hairs after waxing. Since I&#x27;ve been using it twice a day in the morning and in the evening I can see a noticeable difference of less ingrown hairs and my skin looks flawless. My skin does flake once in a while, but it makes sense why it would do that. Will order again.</li>
    <li> Great product use it 2 times a day morning and night just be careful not to use too much! It has works wonders, 2 months with no ingrown hairs from waxing!</li>
    <li> This product smells great and shows results quickly. I use it on my face but the drawback is it makes the skin peel in order to shed resulting in mew brighter skin.</li>
    <li> Your skin will peel to reveal a new layer of skin. This works wonders.</li>
    <li> I do not see any results! It burns a little but not too bad. I wouldn&#x27;t mind the smell if it actually worked.</li>
    <li> I love it! I had bought every single thing in the market to brighten my skin and for razor bumps as it is embarrassing to wear swim suits like that but, this thing really really helps! I have been using it for about a month and it&#x27;s amazing. It is helping, I see the difference now.</li>
    <li> Honestly I&#x27;ve been using this for about a month and not even twice a day as indicated and I already see a difference. The area is a lot lighter and no razor bumps. I love this product!</li>
    <li> This product has helped tremendously to stop ingrown hairs.  I have been using it for over a month now each day &amp; have noticed that previous dark spots from prior ingrown hairs are fading.  I am very happy with this product.  It lasts a long time too.  This stuff is totally worth it if you wax and have ingrown hair issues.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s been a little over a month since I started using this and my skin is looking and feeling sooooo much better! The only thing that is a slight drawback is that it makes my skin peel and in public that can be a little embarrassing but if I can deal with that if that means getting rid of dark spots and bumps on my neck and chin. I would most definitely recommend this product. I am not ashamed to hold my head up and back as I once was. Not only is my skin smooth but the dark marks are fading and quickly!</li>
    <li> Good stuff for after waxing.  Helps prevent red bumps and ingrown hairs.</li>
    <li> This product has successfully eliminated all ingrown hairs, which I used to get all the time due to the coarse texture of my hair.  I&#x27;m also starting to see old scars fade.  They&#x27;re not completely gone yet but they aren&#x27;t as noticeable as before. I&#x27;ve been using it for about 3 weeks.</li>
    <li> It definitely looks like it&#x27;s working and the in-growns have decreased significantly...when I&#x27;m using it systematically. Not sure about lightening, but I think it&#x27;s working slowly/slightly. Better then what I&#x27;ve tried before over all!</li>
    <li> see results quick. hopefully they continue.</li>
    <li> Easy to use.. But didn&#x27;t see no result in a month..</li>
    <li> I never thought I&#x27;d find a real solution to my ingrown hairs and skin discoloration a, but this stuff is a miracle. I believe they test on animals which is really upsetting, and I hope they go cruelty free soon.</li>
    <li> I have issues with ingrown hair and since using this , no more issues.  Will not be without this in my medicine cabinet.</li>
    <li> Razor bumps vanish practically next day when applied after shaving and it also helps prevent ingrown hairs. Will purchase more!</li>
    <li> I get embarrassed by my dark underarms especially after shaving since I have dark hair and I&#x27;ve used deodorants &amp; lightening lotions but didn&#x27;t have much an effect until I found this product! It helped brighten my arms so much within two weeks! I use it after I pluck my facial hair too and its helped lighten! When you put it on, it stings a little but has a pleasant smell &amp; it makes you feel refreshed! It&#x27;s light and absorbs rather quickly too! I don&#x27;t use deodorants or any lotions anymore! This is definitely a product I&#x27;ll use for quite a while.</li>
    <li> I suffer with adult acne and scaring from ingrown facial hairs due to my hrt. This has helped clear my face beautifully!!</li>
    <li> All in all I&#x27;m pretty satisfied with this product. It does help prevent ingrown hairs by drying out the area, so the hair can surface, making it easier to remove. I only gave it 4 stars because when it comes to the scarring from previous ingrowns, it doesn&#x27;t seem to work as well. I&#x27;ve been using it twice a day for about a month now, and I don&#x27;t see much of a difference.</li>
    <li> To start off, let me tell you that I have suffered from ingrown hair for about 7 years now. It&#x27;s gotten to the point I couldn&#x27;t wear bikini to the beach in two years  and my beach shorts kept on getting longer and longer. I&#x27;ve tried everything from waxing to threading to whatever you can image. I tried so many products out there, spent about $400 a year on them but NOTHING worked until now.&lt;br /&gt;It is not a magic eraser and I still have a few problem spots but I am no longer afraid to put on a bikini bottom and take a stroll on the beach. It doesn&#x27;t work immediately and it takes time. Make sure you use it EVERY DAY, otherwise it won&#x27;t work so well. It does burn and smell funky but it goes away within a few minutes. I apply it in the morning and evening. So far this is the best results I have gotten and I will continue using this product until someone else  SHOWS me that there is something better out there. Give this a try!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve just been using this for a few weeks, so that&#x27;s why I&#x27;m giving it 4 stars, but I&#x27;m definitely seeing results. I have PCOS which causes excessive hair growth. This is turn has led to dark marks, ingrown hairs and razor bumps. Right now, I&#x27;ve seen a definite reduction in the number of bumps and ingrown hairs. I think that before long, I will start to see results when it comes to my uneven skin tone.</li>
    <li> works really well, especially if you exfoliate before applying pfb, it&#x27;s only been a month and I am already seeing great results. Ive finally found a product that lives up to its name. bye bye ingrown&#x27;s and dark spots</li>
    <li> This works just as it promises to. It quickly helps to eliminate and prevent ingrown hairs. I am a Black American woman who Brazillian waxes. After each wax, I use this product. It does cause the skin to peel, which is necessary and one of the perks. That&#x27;s part of the &amp;#34;brightening&amp;#34; and ingrown hair prevention process. Daily exfoliating during showering and moisturizing keep you from looking sun damaged in spite of that. Some complain of the smell but I love the smell. It&#x27;s very fresh and fragrant to me, without being perfumey. It&#x27;s a little sticky when you apply it, but it dries perfectly texture free.  I&#x27;ll continue to buy and use this product.</li>
    <li> Saw no results. Waste of money.</li>
    <li> It may be too soon to tell if it actually works;  bottle reads takes 2 months for redness to disappear.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s taking a couple of months to notice a big change but it definitely helped dry up existing places and allow me to better exfoliate. I have also not encountered any new problems with ingrown hairs. I will continue to use this product.</li>
</ol>
