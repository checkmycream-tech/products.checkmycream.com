      <li>I have used 3 bottles of this now, and order a 4 oz bottle for someone, and they love it as much as I do.</li>

      <li>/&gt;This is my first review.</li>
      <li>(just be aware that product may lower BP)</li>
      <li>and it helped sooo much!</li>
      <li>The bottle is not very user friendly, ie it doesn&#x27;t allow for easy pouring.</li>
      <li>It has though cleared up many&lt;br /&gt;wart like eruptions, involving much drying and unattractive skin, on my hands and arms.</li>
      <li>I couldn&#x27;t wear clothing after putting this on, but it helped so much</li>
      <li>I bought this for my mom to use because she has rosacea, and I heard this product can really help.</li>

      <li>I really didn&#x27;t mind.</li>

      <li>I also saw much improvement and clear skin on my face.</li>
      <li>I saw results within the first two weeks, hair loss halted and new hair grew within the same month.</li>
      <li>Packaging is minimal but the bottle is sturdy and easy to open.</li>
      <li>so I walked around without a top on waiting for it to dry unlike some other oils I used that relieved itchiness but didn&#x27;t ruin clothing.</li>
      <li>evening primrose oil is one of the recommended natural treatments for rosacea.  </li>
      <li>I put on my feet at night and cover them with socks and they are so soft in the morning.</li>
      <li>BUT, it is very oily/greasy and takes a while to dry</li>
      <li>Blend gently &amp; apply to clean, damp face at least twice daily.</li>

<li> BUT, it is very oily/greasy and takes a while to dry</li>
<li> Blend gently &amp; apply to clean, damp face at least twice daily.</li>
<li> I also mix it in my hand with sunblock, which tends to be pretty thick, and find it helps spread the sunblock evenly.</li>
<li> Strange</li>
<li> Just what I ordered and in a larger quantity than I expected.</li>
<li> Itchy, irritable and it hurt as it was being stretched.</li>
<li> I think I will only use it in combination with other oils.  </li>
<li> I use it to temporary take care of my dry scalp.</li>
<li> Not sure if it was old when I got it.</li>
<li> It is not real evp.</li>
<li> Oil not right.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve been taking a half teaspoon in&lt;br /&gt;the morning and again in the evening and those problems are hardly noticeable after only one month.&lt;br /&gt;</li>
<li> I noticed that this product has less viscosity than the capsules</li>
<li> and it also should have a slightly earthy taste.</li>
<li> The bottle seems a little flimsy, but it has held up anyway, so maybe looks are deceiving.</li>
<li> Its a simple product that has lots of claims behind it, but I just like the way it feels on my skin.</li>
<li> The packaging looks a little shady because all it is is a plastic bottle and an unimpressive sticker.</li>
<li> Just started taking this supplement due to dramatic hairloss from being hypothyroid.</li>
<li> What I mean by \\&quot;real\\&quot; is that I think it has been cut with a cheaper oil, or it just is not evp.</li>
<li> I have really bad dry skin</li>
<li> Went bad in a couple months.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have really bad dry skin and I use this and it is fine. Nothing spectacular but its good for dry skin.</li>
    <li> On yahoo.com i belong to a rosacea support group.  evening primrose oil is one of the recommended natural treatments for rosacea.  i ordered this one because the price is so economical -- i use LOTS of evening primrose oil each day.  this is a very good product and i encourage people to buy it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;many thanks to all the wonderful people at the company who manufactures it.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s good for my skin but okay for my hair. I use it to temporary take care of my dry scalp.</li>
    <li> It moisturizes, and doesn&#x27;t break out my skin. There is no smell. But I haven&#x27;t found anything special about the oil. I was happy with my purchase but won&#x27;t buy primrose oil again. The packaging looks a little shady because all it is is a plastic bottle and an unimpressive sticker.</li>
    <li> I use to take makeup off. I love this!!!! Feels great not greasy</li>
    <li> This is a great oil to be used on mature complexions. It also helps to&lt;br /&gt;minimize fine lines &amp; wrinkles. Just add 2 drops of vitamin E oil to 2 ounces&lt;br /&gt;of Evening Primrose oil. Blend gently &amp; apply to clean, damp face at least twice daily.</li>
    <li> I purchased this EPO for my sons&#x27; eczema.  I was using the capsules on his skin by popping them open with a needle and then squeezing it on his problem areas.  I noticed that this product has less viscosity than the capsules and it did not work as well.  I think I will only use it in combination with other oils.  It might work well as an intimate lubricant....idk?  Haven&#x27;t used it for that, but I guess it&#x27;s an option.</li>
    <li> Maybe would have been good if not old from bottle already been opened. Oil not right.</li>
    <li> This products did not help with my itching eczema and so back to the steroid Rx ointment. It has though cleared up many&lt;br /&gt;wart like eruptions, involving much drying and unattractive skin, on my hands and arms. I&#x27;ve been taking a half teaspoon in&lt;br /&gt;the morning and again in the evening and those problems are hardly noticeable after only one month.&lt;br /&gt; Shipping was very fast and I&#x27;ll be reordering when needed.</li>
    <li> Just what I ordered and in a larger quantity than I expected. Packaging is minimal but the bottle is sturdy and easy to open.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s been a weeks and this has helped fade my acne scars and it really moisturizes my skin.  I will continue to use this on the regular</li>
    <li> This is an Awesome oil and a great buy.  I would definitely buy it again.  I made a body scrub with it.</li>
    <li> I was so excited to receive this product. I opened it when it came and had a spoonful. It is not real evp. What I mean by \\&quot;real\\&quot; is that I think it has been cut with a cheaper oil, or it just is not evp. I have been taking evp oil for two years now. I know what it should taste like. Real organic evp oil is thicker than this cheap oil and it also should have a slightly earthy taste. This tastes like nothing and the consistency is also cheap and runny. Of course the contact number for the company just rand and went to voicemail like a regular cell phone:(&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my first review. I felt it was important to share this experience so someone else is not duped. I do not understand why there are so many good reviews here on this product...Strange</li>
    <li> I purchased this oil because it was the cheapest of its kind and quantity. The bottle is not very user friendly, ie it doesn&#x27;t allow for easy pouring. Every time I pour some of this oil to use, I spill even more of it. I&#x27;ll spend the extra money next time to get a better, easier to pour bottle.</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE this Organic Evening Primrose Oil. It has significantly helped with my acne!!! My skin is clearing up fast, I just apply it several times throughout the day, and the results are almost immediate. I have also been using it on my hair and it has made my hair much softer, shiner, and stronger. This is a fantastic product. And the seller shipped very fast. Will continue to buy this product!!</li>
    <li> Just started taking this supplement due to dramatic hairloss from being hypothyroid. I couldn&#x27;t believe how quickly it works. I saw results within the first two weeks, hair loss halted and new hair grew within the same month. I will never stop taking this, I urge anyone who maybe hypothyroid to give it a try! (just be aware that product may lower BP) I also saw much improvement and clear skin on my face.</li>
    <li> I love this oil.  It is non-scented and yes, oily, but after reading the restorative information about evening primrose, I&#x27;m hooked.  Great for body, as well.  I also mix it in my hand with sunblock, which tends to be pretty thick, and find it helps spread the sunblock evenly.</li>
    <li> Went bad in a couple months. Not sure if it was old when I got it. I didn&#x27;t think evening prim needed to be refrigerated but I guess I should have.</li>
    <li> I have used 3 bottles of this now, and order a 4 oz bottle for someone, and they love it as much as I do. This oil is a key staple in my skin care routine, and I never go a day/night without it! Amazing price for an amazing product!</li>
    <li> Primrose oil has wonderful benefits for overall skin care.  I put on my feet at night and cover them with socks and they are so soft in the morning.</li>
    <li> i like to mix different oils together and use this mixture as a body and face moisturizer.....each oil adds a special something to the skin....</li>
    <li> This oil was of an excellent quality.  I received it in a timely fashion and in good condition.  The beauty lotion made from it was of excellent quality and is being enjoyed by all who have used it.</li>
    <li> Great product. It has my face flawless.</li>
    <li> Great Product, excellent quality, I used this day and night as part of my skin care routine also mix it in with my body lotion it, feels great, will buy again, i am hooked!</li>
    <li> Evening Primrose Oil has been called the most sensational preventive discovery since vitamin C. It contains the pain relieving compound phenylalanine and is increasingly being used to treat chronic headaches. It is currently being studied all over the world as a treatment for aging problems, alcoholism, acne, heart disease, hyperactivity in children, symptoms of menopause, multiple sclerosis, weight control, obesity, PMS and schizophrenia. It has so many preventive and therapeutic qualities that it has become a standard part of recommendations of many herbalist for maintaining youth and preventing disease.</li>
    <li> Depending on your needs and desire, the product is good. Arrived on time and in good shape. I researched the different uses for the product and it met my needs.</li>
    <li> My midwife recommended evening primrose oil for my appendicitis scar while I was pregnant as it was very bothersome to me. Itchy, irritable and it hurt as it was being stretched. I began using this and it helped sooo much! BUT, it is very oily/greasy and takes a while to dry so I walked around without a top on waiting for it to dry unlike some other oils I used that relieved itchiness but didn&#x27;t ruin clothing. I couldn&#x27;t wear clothing after putting this on, but it helped so much I really didn&#x27;t mind. I ended up getting a few stretch marks around my scar the last two days of my pregnancy; but this oil made the process much smoother for me. It relieved any discomfort I had with the stretching of my scar and felt great. I highly recommend it although tablets are a bit more convenient if you aren&#x27;t using as much at a time.</li>
    <li> Awesome shipping and price, not much to say about the product, it&#x27;s Organic Evening Primrose Oil!! Lol. Feels very nice. I bought this for my mom to use because she has rosacea, and I heard this product can really help. I mixed it 40% along with 30%  Grapeseed Oil, and 30% sweet almond oil. Also added a couple drops of Eucalyptus EO, Lavender EO, Clary Sage EO, and Tea Tree EO. This all using the OCM (Oil Cleansing Method) look it up!! :)</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t buy this for anything fancy,. Its a simple product that has lots of claims behind it, but I just like the way it feels on my skin. The bottle seems a little flimsy, but it has held up anyway, so maybe looks are deceiving.</li>
