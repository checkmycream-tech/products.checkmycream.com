      <li>The spray was easy to use, and seemed to protect well.  </li>

      <li>It seems greasy when you first apply it, but it dries quickly and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy at all.</li>
      <li>am thrilled that this product exists, and plan to keep using it for as long as they make it.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s my favorite and the only one</li>
      <li>sticks pretty well, even though I sweat a lot.</li>
      <li>Ever since then, if he is going to be doing something along those lines, I use a more solid cream sunscreen that seems to hold up</li>
      <li>He was curious about this new one and laughed when I sprayed it -</li>
      <li>They seem to do a good job preventing sunburn, although I also try to be careful about spending too much time in direct sunlight.</li>
      <li>She also has super sensitive skin with eczema etc.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s easy to put on and keeps them protected while playing outside.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been an outdoorsman my whole life.  </li>
      <li>Part of the problem was that he was standing in running water of the fountains 80 percent of the day which I imagine really just washed it off over and over.  </li>

      <li>This is highly rated on EWG.org</li>
      <li>There&#x27;s no better sunscreen I&#x27;ve found: applies very easy, has no scent, and no oily residue --</li>
      <li>This has worked really well for me and my 2 yr old twins.  </li>
      <li>nice benefit is that it&#x27;s non-greasy and doesn&#x27;t have any of the negative effects of zinc oxide.</li>
      <li>live in Florida</li>
      <li>It layers decently under make up, but I generally use a tinted spf if I want some complexion help.</li>
      <li>I did use it again after the original symptoms cleared up to see if this was the culprit versus something else and the redness and dry skin came back.</li>
      <li>I bought the Kinesys Sunscreen Spray, Kids, SPF 30 and sprayed it on my 2 year old who cries when he sees me reach for the sunscreen.  </li>
      <li>It has a strange texture at first (sort of slippery/greasy/soapy)</li>
      <li>I wouldn&#x27;t spray it directly in, but it doesn&#x27;t hurt the eyes if you wipe it over your eyelids.</li>
      <li>B002ZJWD6I Coppertone Sensitive Skin Body Lotion SPF</li>
      <li>This is a good, albeit expensive, alternative to the Neutragena type spray sunscreens.  </li>
      <li>Yes, this product is super expensive, but worth every penny!</li>
      <li>It goes on smooth and dries nicely, not greasy.  </li>
      <li>As far as I can tell, they are the same.  </li>
      <li>I liked it, but it&#x27;s expensive.</li>
      <li>It was not a bad burn though, he woke up totally pale the next day.  </li>
      <li>This sunscreen was recommended by our dermatologist, and it is much easier to apply than other highly-rated, kid-safe sunscreen creams I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
      <li>Red hair, blue eyes, and sensitive skin...</li>
      <li>We use a high quality spray for legs and arms that are less sensitive...</li>
      <li>4oz bottle will hold me through at least a full summer of frequent outdoor activities, so it lasts a long time.</li>
      <li>I have a tube of UV Natural that takes over 1/2 hour to dry, it&#x27;s like applying Crisco.  </li>
      <li>After using this on my 22 month old, I noticed red, dry skin on her ears, chin and cheeks.  </li>
      <li>My 16 yr old is super pale and burns no matter what sunscreen she uses....until this product!!!  </li>

<li> It goes on looking pretty greasy, but it dried within a few minutes.  </li>
<li> - usually i have to go scrub them in the bathroom for a while to get regular sunscreen off and then use a towel I don&#x27;t care about to dry them because it never comes completely off.  </li>
<li> My daughter came home several shades darker, she didn&#x27;t burn but was extremely tan.  </li>
<li> My husband, myself and our 2 kids use this product all summer long!</li>
<li> This is the only sunscreen I use on my little girls.  </li>
<li> It doesn&#x27;t leave a pronounced scent once it absorbs, and although my skin feels a little different (in terms of texture), it doesn&#x27;t feel obtrusive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve probably bought at least 4 bottles so far</li>
<li> We have spent a lot of time in the sun this summer with no burns.  </li>
<li> He did get pink on his cheeks and arms.  </li>
<li> She spent the day at a water park and came home looking like..NORMAL, and not a lobster.  </li>
<li> like we have with other sunscreens.</li>
<li> I usually use this if we are only going to be in the sun for a little while, or when I don&#x27;t want to deal with the hassle of applying the cream sunscreens.  </li>
<li> : some of the chemicals will mess with your hormones.</li>
<li> KINeSYS sunscreens are an absolute godsend for me--I&#x27;ve been allergic to almost every sunscreen I&#x27;ve ever tried, and the Kinesys sunscreens don&#x27;t provoke me too badly.</li>
<li> For some reason, I was under the assumption that this order contains multiple bottles - but for one bottle of sunscreen, it is an expensive option.</li>
<li> I sort of wish I could use it for myself, but it&#x27;s just too expensive for both of us to use it daily.  </li>
<li> 50, 6-Ounce Bottles (Pack of 3)]] doesn&#x27;t rate too bad by EWG but it remains white on the skin.</li>
<li> that&#x27;s very hard to describe, but once it absorbs, it stays.</li>

    <li> After using this on my 22 month old, I noticed red, dry skin on her ears, chin and cheeks.  I did use it again after the original symptoms cleared up to see if this was the culprit versus something else and the redness and dry skin came back.</li>
    <li> This is pricey, but the best rated spray on sunscreen for children.  I do a lot of research on sunscreen for my son after finding out that I was using one that is TOXIC to children!!  AHHH, mommy nightmare!!    This sprays on nicely.  Dries quickly and does not leave a sticky residue AT ALL!    Sometimes you get what you pay for and sometimes it&#x27;s worth it.  This is one of those things.  I will buy this OVER AND OVER AGAIN!!</li>
    <li> I bought this sunscreen for my 4 year old son mostly based on the Environmental Working Group&#x27;s recommendation on safest and best sunscreens.  It is the highest rated spray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I like about it the most is that my son LOVES it.  For some reason it goes on so light and silky that he really doesn&#x27;t mind putting it on.  I spray it in my hand and then wipe on his face and ears.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We live in Florida so sunscreen is a daily thing.  I keep this in the car and put it on before school, camp etc.  I sort of wish I could use it for myself, but it&#x27;s just too expensive for both of us to use it daily.  So I reserve it mostly for my son.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did have a problem with it.  During a day at the waterpark I applied it before we arrived (930) and he was in the waterpark from 1030-3pm.  I did reapply after lunch at about noon.  It wasn&#x27;t enough.  He did get pink on his cheeks and arms.  It was not a bad burn though, he woke up totally pale the next day.  Part of the problem was that he was standing in running water of the fountains 80 percent of the day which I imagine really just washed it off over and over.  I probably should have reapplied another time too.  Ever since then, if he is going to be doing something along those lines, I use a more solid cream sunscreen that seems to hold up better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But for the most part, we live in the sunniest climate and otherwise this sunscreen has been great.</li>
    <li> This is a good, albeit expensive, alternative to the Neutragena type spray sunscreens.  This is highly rated on EWG.org and my kids don&#x27;t object to it, like some of the creams.  Works well.  I usually use this if we are only going to be in the sun for a little while, or when I don&#x27;t want to deal with the hassle of applying the cream sunscreens.  Generally I use Vanicream for all day use, which is exceptional in preventing sunburn and the best sunscreen I have ever found, and then will touch up my sunscreen coverage later in the day with the Kinesys spray.  Lastly, I find no difference whatsoever between the sunscreen in the orange bottle and that in the white bottle.  As far as I can tell, they are the same.  Buy whichever one is cheaper.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  It is safe, non toxic and it really works!  We have spent a lot of time in the sun this summer with no burns.  It feels great on your skin and the spray bottle works well. I will definitely continue to use this product.</li>
    <li> This sunscreen works well. EWG gives it a good rating in terms of uvb and uva protection.  I have sensitive, acne-prone skin, and this never stings when I put on like other sunscreens I have used. It layers decently under make up, but I generally use a tinted spf if I want some complexion help.</li>

    <li> KINeSYS sunscreens are an absolute godsend for me--I&#x27;ve been allergic to almost every sunscreen I&#x27;ve ever tried, and the Kinesys sunscreens don&#x27;t provoke me too badly. They seem to do a good job preventing sunburn, although I also try to be careful about spending too much time in direct sunlight. I&#x27;ve used their sunscreens for years, in a lot of different contexts:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- winter mountaineering&lt;br /&gt;- kayaking&lt;br /&gt;- camping&lt;br /&gt;- music festivals&lt;br /&gt;- swimming&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It sticks pretty well, even though I sweat a lot. It has a strange texture at first (sort of slippery/greasy/soapy) that&#x27;s very hard to describe, but once it absorbs, it stays. It doesn&#x27;t leave a pronounced scent once it absorbs, and although my skin feels a little different (in terms of texture), it doesn&#x27;t feel obtrusive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A 4oz bottle will hold me through at least a full summer of frequent outdoor activities, so it lasts a long time. For backpacking and travel, I bought the smaller (1 oz) bottle, which I refill at home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am thrilled that this product exists, and plan to keep using it for as long as they make it.</li>
    <li> The spray was easy to use, and seemed to protect well.  It seems greasy when you first apply it, but it dries quickly and doesn&#x27;t feel greasy at all.</li>
    <li> This has worked really well for me and my 2 yr old twins.  I found it through Skin Deep, the Environmental Working Group&#x27;s cosmetic database.  It gets great ratings for sun protection and minimal toxicity.  It goes on easily, dries quickly, and kept them tan and burn free for a week in the Caribbean.  It&#x27;s so light feeling it&#x27;s deceptive but it works!  I started using it myself when I felt how non-greasy and light it feels on the skin.</li>
    <li> We order this online each year.  It goes on easy and dries completely clear, which is nice for those with brown skin.  You can spray on body or spray on hands and apply to the kids if you don&#x27;t want them to breathe it in.  It goes on smooth and dries nicely, not greasy.  Stays on throught sweat and swimming.</li>
    <li> Highly recommended by our dermatologist for kids and adults.It&#x27;s a light spray, no scent, and not sticky. After reading all the bad press about Neutrogena products, this is our go to product. You need to buy this one.</li>
    <li> This sunscreen was recommended by our dermatologist, and it is much easier to apply than other highly-rated, kid-safe sunscreen creams I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s non-greasy, non-smelly, doesn&#x27;t sting, stays on in the water, just works great.  It&#x27;s my favorite and the only one my kids don&#x27;t whine and complain about.</li>
    <li> BEST spray sunscreen. It goes on easily, smells great and really works! I have been buying this product for years and will continue to do so! I&#x27;m a very happy mom!</li>
    <li> Our family loves this sunscreen, it&#x27;s so easy to apply, works very well, feels good on skin, and I don&#x27;t need to worry about the harms of a continuous spray or the ingredients! Love it!</li>
    <li> Great sunscreen and my kid doesn&#x27;t tear like he does with almost every other brand. For some reason, I was under the assumption that this order contains multiple bottles - but for one bottle of sunscreen, it is an expensive option.</li>
    <li> I liked it, but it&#x27;s expensive.</li>
    <li> I bought the Kinesys Sunscreen Spray, Kids, SPF 30 and sprayed it on my 2 year old who cries when he sees me reach for the sunscreen.  He was curious about this new one and laughed when I sprayed it - I guess he wasn&#x27;t expecting that.  It goes on looking pretty greasy, but it dried within a few minutes.  I have a tube of UV Natural that takes over 1/2 hour to dry, it&#x27;s like applying Crisco.  With the Kinesys My hands felt greasy afterwards, but I just used hand sanitizer and a baby wipe - usually i have to go scrub them in the bathroom for a while to get regular sunscreen off and then use a towel I don&#x27;t care about to dry them because it never comes completely off.  I hope this brand takes off and enables them to lower the price - tell 2 friends!  **  Update: My daughter came home several shades darker, she didn&#x27;t burn but was extremely tan.  Back to the fence paint type of products...  [[ASIN:B002ZJWD6I Coppertone Sensitive Skin Body Lotion SPF 50, 6-Ounce Bottles (Pack of 3)]] doesn&#x27;t rate too bad by EWG but it remains white on the skin.</li>
    <li> This is the only sunscreen I use on my little girls.  It&#x27;s easy to put on and keeps them protected while playing outside.  I&#x27;ve probably bought at least 4 bottles so far and I will continue to use this product.</li>
    <li> BEST feeling sunscreen.  It is rather expensive, but I&#x27;m willing to pay it because it feels great on the skin and works.  Spray bottle gives great coverage.  I wouldn&#x27;t spray it directly in, but it doesn&#x27;t hurt the eyes if you wipe it over your eyelids. We&#x27;ve never burnt wearing this.</li>
    <li> I found this using the Environmental Working Group site and bought it last summer. I love it. It goes on thin, and feels silky not greasy. No smell. Works great. Use it for adults and kids alike. I use it on my nose daily, and as needed elsewhere. Keep in mind, it appears that some sun exposure is good (vitamin D), so consider going without sunscreen when you can do so without getting a burn.</li>
    <li> Hits: No scent!!!  Sprays on nicely&lt;br /&gt;Misses: some of the chemicals will mess with your hormones. Kids may breath in some of the spray when applying it.&lt;br /&gt;Better to find non-spray sunscreen that uses mineral based blockers rather than chemical.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been an outdoorsman my whole life.  There&#x27;s no better sunscreen I&#x27;ve found: applies very easy, has no scent, and no oily residue -- don&#x27;t even notice it&#x27;s on.</li>
    <li> Our family has been using this for a couple of years now and I have all good things to say about it (there is one exception).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It goes on easy, a bottle lasts a long time, and it&#x27;s very effective as a sunblock.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one caveat: One of my children gets a rash if we use it 3-4 days in a row.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, I personally use it every day and have never gotten a sunburn. It&#x27;s top-notch. It&#x27;s the ONLY sunscreen I use nowadays.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A nice benefit is that it&#x27;s non-greasy and doesn&#x27;t have any of the negative effects of zinc oxide.</li>
    <li> This is the second bottle of the KINeSYS I have used for my child. Red hair, blue eyes, and sensitive skin... we have had NO issues whatsoever related to rash, irritation, etc. like we have with other sunscreens. We use this primarily on the face / neck area (can&#x27;t afford it for the entire body lube). We use a high quality spray for legs and arms that are less sensitive...</li>
    <li> best sunscreen ever! kids love it, no tears!</li>
    <li> This is the best sunscreen I have ever used and I probably have used more than 50 types. It&#x27;s clear, smells great and moisturizes the skin, and it&#x27;s safe for kids. I am very disappointed that Kinesys is not sold on IHerb anymore as I live in Hong Kong. I need this product but now I can only get them when relatives from the US come visit.</li>
    <li> My 16 yr old is super pale and burns no matter what sunscreen she uses....until this product!!!  She spent the day at a water park and came home looking like..NORMAL, and not a lobster.  She also has super sensitive skin with eczema etc.  No flare ups, etc.  Yes, this product is super expensive, but worth every penny!</li>
