<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I do not recommend this product for use during pregnancy. The amount you have to use, compared to how much is supplied is not enough. They say to use 2-4 pumps, which is about the size of a dime. For most pregnant bellies, that isn&#x27;t going to work.  I also haven&#x27;t noticed a difference at all since using it. It hasn&#x27;t faded or prevented any new marks. It does smell nice, and may work for post partum, but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this for use when you need more than a dime size.</li>
    <li> absorbs quickly, stretch marks are feeling a lot better</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 22 weeks pregnant and have been using this cream everydayand still no stretch marks!It&#x27;s nice and smooth and smells good too. Better than coco butter! The customer service was great and I wluld totally recommend this product to any woman!!!</li>
    <li> Used this all though my pregnancy and I am prone to stretch marks, as I have gotten them before due to rapid weight gain. Did not get a single new mark! and I got big! Delivered a 10lb baby!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t see much of a difference but slightly fading.  I&#x27;m sure after continuous use they will fade.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m sorry... Maybe I&#x27;m using this product wrong!? I&#x27;ve had this bottle for less than 2 weeks, and it is completely finished! I love the cream, it absorbs so quickly and smells great. But there&#x27;s no way I&#x27;m going to reorder this every 2 weeks. And that was only using it once a day! Imagine if I had used it twice a day, like the packaging recommended.</li>
    <li> Unlike others I did not recurve this free or as a promotion for a review. I purchased it in hopes of results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I feel it&#x27;s important to list current circumstances as it plays into results...&lt;br /&gt;I gave birth approx. 2 months prior to trying this product, attend hot yoga 2-3 times/week, hike/long walk 1-2 times/week, exfoliate (dry brush/harsh scrub in shower) 4-5 times/week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I apply 4 pumps in a circular motion morning and night. I&#x27;ve accidentally skipped a couple applications, but have used it for 1 month now and have noticed that my stretch marks (on tummy due to pregnancy) have lightened, but am not sure if it&#x27;s due to the cream or all of the above factors. I have stretch marks that are in a triangle from just above my belly button down to my belt line and have noticed that the ones by my belly button have significantly faded and are barely noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve ordered another bottle as I&#x27;m almost out and am going to keep using it as it does seem to be helping for the marks. I can&#x27;t speak on any benefits to cellulite as I&#x27;m fortunate enough to not have any on my belly where I&#x27;m applying the cream. If I have any left over I may try it on my thighs where I do, but I&#x27;m focusing on my tummy first.</li>
    <li> Stretch marks be gone, I am so loving this after having twins my tummy is in serious need of some stretch mark removal.  I love the feel of this and am hoping for a miracle  in a bottle:)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve started seeing results after just 1 use. I&#x27;m pretty impressed!</li>
    <li> Does not work. Waste of money.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t rub in well, and I have found others that work better that are more cost efficient</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my teenage daughter whose rapidly growing curves are causing her discomfort in multiple ways!  She has maybe a hundred or more marks on her chest, inner and outer thighs and upper butt.  This has completely erased all the redness and angry streaks which all now look like &amp;#34;old&amp;#34; stretch marks, just silvery skin ripples.  They look like they&#x27;ll keep healing, too.  I&#x27;m hoping her young age works in her favor to heal.  Just try this and see!</li>
    <li> Had this product for about 2 weeks, have seen a slight difference in stretch marks. Hope to see more of a difference.</li>
    <li> I have to say I got this product due to stretch marks I have from weight gain as I have gotten older.  The product goes on smooth and isn&#x27;t greasy.  I haven&#x27;t used it enough to see the true results but so far, I am very pleased.</li>
    <li> Only been using this product for about a week but already showing signs of lightening on my stretch marks and softer skin.</li>
    <li> I am using this in conjunction with microneedling/dermarolling so I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s the dermarolling or the cream or if they&#x27;re working together but it does seem to be working.  I have really bad stretchmarks from 3 kids and I am noticing that the skin within the stretchmarks is getting firmer and smoothing out a little.  It&#x27;s not like they&#x27;re totally erased, but they are definitely less noticeable.</li>
    <li> Not sure that I have noticed too much difference, have been using nighty on stomach and legs and hasn&#x27;t seemed to make much if any stretch marks less noticeable.</li>
    <li> &amp;#60;Posting on behalf of my wife who delivered two months ago&amp;#62; ...This cream doesn&#x27;t work at all....used for 2 months and no effect on my wife&#x27;s pregnancy stretch marks. Zilch. Nada. Absolutely no difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I want my money back. How does the money back warranty work ?</li>
    <li> Arrived quickly. Impressed with the product so far. I&#x27;ve only been using for 5 days but hope it works as well as it did for others who purchased it.</li>
    <li> This cream feels great going on. In the short time I have used it I can actually see a difference.</li>
    <li> i am currently pregnant with my 3rd child. due in june and i am currectly using the product for my stretch marks. goes on great and doesnt leave you feeling greasy. hoping to see a difference soon as this is the first time I&#x27;ve used the product</li>
    <li> Using this on my stretch marks and pleased so far. I love the pump bottle and how light it goes on without being greasy. I apply it after showering and it absorbs quickly so I don&#x27;t have to worry about it rubbing off on my clothes.</li>
    <li> Wife likes to use this cream on her battle scars and loves how it works and feels... Gonna get a few more...</li>
    <li> Been using this for weeks to help with removing stretch marks and to prevent new ones. It is working for either. Following directions exactly as stated and no results.</li>
    <li> I only have a small section of my tummy with stretch marks after 3 pregnancies so I wasn&#x27;t panicking to get rid of it. This is actually the first time I&#x27;ve used stretch marks cream. This product barely has a scent which is a good thing. Soft cream but not oily. It doesn&#x27;t leave your skin sticky and it absorbs fast on your skin. I gave it a 4 star coz I just literally started using it. So I&#x27;m waiting how my stretch marks will react to it. Overall I&#x27;m happy with this purchase :)</li>
    <li> I used the whole bottle but did not see much change in existing stretch marks from my first pregnancy. I am currently pregnant with my second. The cream does keep my skin feeling moisturized and is absorbed easily by skin. But my skin is already stretched out so maybe its easier this time around to keep my tummy skin moisturized than last time? Or maybe I need to use another bottle to see the difference?</li>
    <li> Love this so far. Works great, doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy feeling.</li>
    <li> Best product in the market.</li>
    <li> I like the pump on this cream. Have only recently started using, but have already noticed a difference in the stretch marks.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t really see a result.... Won&#x27;t be buying this again </li>
    <li> Just started using this recently so haven&#x27;t seen its full potential. I have 4 kids &amp; plenty of stretch marks came along with them. So far it seems to work somewhat. I know it&#x27;s not a miracle cream so I&#x27;m not expecting that. Will update in a few more weeks.</li>
    <li> I have only been using this product for 2 days and have noticed a very slight fade in my stretch marks. I am hoping with continued use they will fade even more. The cream does not leave a sticky residue and has a pleasant smell. An amazing product for the cost. I just wish it was a bigger bottle.</li>
    <li> I like this product its not too thick its its more thin then thick, It made my skin feel instantly smooth if you are looking for a product like this I would recommend checking this out!</li>
    <li> I received this a few days ago so I cant speak to the long term effects yet. I will say I was pleasantly surprised at the size of the bottle and the smooth calming texture of the cream. It glides right on and absorbs nicely. It has not left my hands messy at all. In fact it leaves my hands smelling nice and feeling smooth. I have sensitive skin and have applied this several times and have had no reactions at all. I hope that helps someone.</li>
    <li> Feels very soft and not oily.</li>
    <li> I have to say that I have been using this more as a preventive precautionary product rather than a necessity.  I don&#x27;t really have serious stretch marks or cellulite but I do feel a more suppleness in my skin tone.  OVerall I like this product.</li>
    <li> Purchased 2 bottles for my wife and she loved it, she said she noticed results within a few days of some stretch marks getting dimmed, she liked it so much, she asked me to purchase another bottle to last her through the pregnancy. </li>
    <li> This cream if you follow the directions you can actually see the effects within a few days I had a couple of stretch marks that I felt self conscious about and this cream actually helped to blend them in a bit they are less visible and I love it.</li>
    <li> Smelled nice, but ran out fast. I didn&#x27;t even have enough product to test its efficiency. &amp;#34;/</li>
    <li> I just started using this and can already see a difference in my stretch marks. Can&#x27;t wait to see what the results will be after a few weeks!</li>
    <li> Awesome one .it leaves a smooth skin.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my wife since she likes to try to get rid of her stretch marks. After having 3 babies it&#x27;s normal to have them! Let&#x27;s face it in my opinion nothing is going to work instantly or completely make them go away, but my wife has seen some good results with this cream. I can totally see a difference in the appearance of her stretch marks especially the ones on her hips are not nearly as noticeable, and she is happy with the product. We didn&#x27;t see results over night, and with most products you won&#x27;t see that. I think if you buy this cream you will see a slight difference in the first week and a little bit more every week after. We had a great experience and plan to buy more when this runs out.</li>
    <li> love this product , smells good, easy to use, and smooth s and fades some of the stretch mark. thank you for letting me try it for little or zero money</li>
    <li> My wife really like to use this cream , I bought it for discount.I definitely recommend this for those who are pregnant to prevent and repair stretch marks or for those who have already had children to help repair stretch marks.</li>
    <li> Also i dont see a huge change it did make my skin very soft. I&#x27;ll keep using it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this a couple times and haven&#x27;t seen any improvement so far. I&#x27;m giving it 3 stars though because I love the way it feels once on. Its silky and you can really feel it penetrating. I&#x27;m hoping that it does help within a couple weeks or so. But  it isn&#x27;t bad but isn&#x27;t great.</li>
    <li> I was given a discount for this product for a review.  I like the feeling of this product and I did see a slight change in color of just a few stretch marks I have but not the change that I was really hoping for that may be that all my stretch marks are old and I have had them for 20+ years, that may play a roll in the results.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok.  This comes in a pretty pump bottle with an unscrew able lid.  The product doesn&#x27;t seem to contain perfume, but it doesn&#x27;t stink either.  I usually prefer lotion with a little more scent - but I guess technically this isn&#x27;t lotion.  It seems to go on fine, though I haven&#x27;t seen much of a difference - probably too soon to tell.</li>
    <li> I loved it. It worked great!</li>
    <li> Very good very  smooth</li>
    <li> For the records, this is not a  &#x27;paid for&#x27; review. I am a regular amazon customer who shops a lot on their website. I was looking for something to help with my stretchmarks and decided to try this product.&lt;br /&gt;In a few weeks of using this product, I have to confirm that this is the best product by far, you see, I do not have new stretchmarks but old ones and amazingly this product has begun to fade the marks.&lt;br /&gt;I know a few buyers mentioned that the pump bottle did not work for them, so curiously I cut open the bottle to see if there were a lot of remains in the bottle, but to my surprise, it was absolutely empty. The pump bottle is apparently designed to push every drop of cream to the top.&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend this cream. Check my other reviews, and you will see that I am a very fussy buyer. Best of luck!</li>
    <li> it was not worth the money. the little bottle lasted only 2 weeks and had no result to show for it on my pregnant wife.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i was refunded for the product, giving it 5 star.</li>
    <li> I love his stuff. In the little time that i have been using it i notice a difference.</li>
    <li> I have only been using this product for a few days but I love how smooth it makes my skin feel. I am 34 weeks pregnant and am excited to see the results</li>
    <li> Have only used a couple days, but it seems to be working. Can tell a small difference already.</li>
    <li> I love this product. Im a man and I use it for my weight loss journey. Best ive ever used. Ive used coco butter for moms. Bio oil and others. This is the best overall. I see results within days.</li>
    <li> Love the light scent. I&#x27;ve used it 4 times so far and like the way it absorbs. looking to see a big change with continued use. Great size for travel!</li>
    <li> The bottle literally lasted me a week and a half (just applying it to my pregnant belly only once a day) and I saw no results.</li>
    <li> Great! Quick shipment!</li>
    <li> I had my daughter almost a year ago and I have some not so pretty stretch marks! I started using this cream two days ago and I am already starting to see a little improvemtent! I am not looking for them to completely disappear even though that would be nice! I wanted so!etjin to make them fade this is doing just that thanks!</li>
    <li> I really like how this cream absorbs quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy feel on your skin.  After having 2 kids and getting stretch marks due to rapid weight gain with my youngest, I am willing to try anything.  I noticed that this cream definitely had a firming effect on my thighs.  As I have only been using it for 3 days I am not sure as to how it is working on helping my stretch marks, but my thighs look noticeably firmer.</li>
    <li> arrived promptly and packaging was to be expected. Love the pump dispenser. No odor and absorbs quickly. Slight tingle last 1 sec or 2. So far I&#x27;ve noticed a slight firming in my thigh area. tks</li>
    <li> Love this product. It works .</li>
    <li> The cream was very smooth and hydrating. It has minimized the appearance of my stretch marks on my thighs but not significantly. But I didn&#x27;t expect dramatic results, that&#x27;s just unrealistic lol&lt;br /&gt;Maybe with continued use it would further help minimize......</li>
    <li> So...what can I say about this magical  cream?! It&#x27;s  expensive,  super tiny, finished to fast and didn&#x27;t  help at all! I won&#x27;t  recommend  it to my friends!</li>
    <li> I like this product, it smells good and not really sticky. But I haven&#x27;t seen any significant changes until niw so I will wait some more time.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a week or so no change yet will update</li>
    <li> Quickly shipped. Happy with product</li>
    <li> I really like the lite scent, I have only used this for just a few days and am excited about how well this is going to work.</li>
    <li> We are all anxious to get rid of those unsightly marks and I&#x27;m sure we all run to any product claiming results. I can say that I have been using this product for a little over 3 weeks and a slight difference. No my stretch marks have not disappeared but I do notice a change. It looks like they are fading into a more even skin tone in some places. I am so glad this product doesn&#x27;t smell like chemicals. It has a very subtle fragrance that doesn&#x27;t linger. It blends effortlessly into my skin without feeling oily or leaving a residue. With any scar cream it&#x27;s takes time and patience to see results. I will have to come back again after a few more weeks with comparison photos. As of now I&#x27;m satisfied with its performance.</li>
    <li> A+++++ Fast shipment! Very happy with product!</li>
    <li> Used it everyday for the last 3 weeks. It has a nice, smooth texture to it. Love that it doesnt have an irritating smell. Cant wait to see results. Hope it works.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this stuff! I am currently 26 weeks pregnant and so far I have no stretch marks. I don&#x27;t know if I just got lucky or if this product is the reason. I do know that it does not leave my skin greasy like all of the other products I have tried but I can still tell it is conditioning my skin. Also something I never read in any other reviews or saw mentioned in the description, this has actually helped clear my skin up. When I got pregnant my skin started breaking out horribly (a problem I never had before) on my face, my chest, my back, everywhere. I couldn&#x27;t find anything to help, even proactiv, but this works!! I use this for a face moisturizer and all over to keep my skin clear. The bottle is small and doesn&#x27;t last long but well worth it.</li>
    <li> Skin feels smoother and appears tighter already, waiting to see further results but hopeful since I have only used for one week and I am already seeing some results</li>
    <li> Love it. and smell great,</li>
    <li> A little goes a long way for the stretch mark cream. It does leave your skin feeling soft and smooth I haven&#x27;t been using it long enough to get a full review on it but I am noticing a difference. My stretch marks have been getting lighter so I&#x27;m sure that this is working the way it&#x27;s supposed to. I got the stretch mark cream other was on promotion and I definitely do think it&#x27;s worth every dollar because I&#x27;m already seeing results and I&#x27;ve only been using this one time.</li>
    <li> THIS STUFF REALLY WORKS. I had literally only used it for two days when I started noticing results.</li>
    <li> My daughter is using and she likes the feel of the cream. she says it feels soft and smells nice</li>
    <li> Got this package fairly quick. The cream has no bad smell and it isn&#x27;t too thick or light, so it absorbs into my skin well. I&#x27;ve only been using this cream for a week to prevent any pregnancy stretch marks so I can&#x27;t tell just yet how it&#x27;s doing. I just know that I&#x27;m applying twice daily and it helps relieve the itchiness.</li>
    <li> Great. very satisfied</li>
    <li> it works awesomely to hide my stretch marks i have</li>
    <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with this pricing, smells good.</li>
    <li> I got this for my stretch mark from previous both pregnant. I have lot of stretch marks and I saw this then I told myself it won&#x27;t hurt me to get this to try out... I know it is too early to tell how much it work...so I started to use it right away....good thing that I do not get any reactions from it which it is plus...I will have to wait and see the results in few weeks.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t wait to test it out. I have old white stretch marks that will hopefully fade away with this cream.</li>
    <li> Arrived quickly. I really like the dispenser and you don&#x27;t need much of the cream at all. It feels a little strange for a second or so. But I like the way it feels after. Will update the review once I use it longer. So far, so good.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m always up for trying anything new for stretch marks, being a mother of 4, but when I tried this product I wasn&#x27;t too happy with it. It came out like a lotion consistency, but when I rubbed it into my skin it left these yellow balls of crud that wouldn&#x27;t rub into my skin. It was kinda gross.</li>
    <li> Ive been using this and you have to apply it often throughout the day. It even feels like it absorbs quickly</li>
    <li> This is an amazing product and this company has great costumer service. I would definantly recommend this product not just to expecting mothers but to all mothers.</li>
    <li> Just started using this product a couple of days ago. Smells great, &amp; it instantly left my skin feeling smoother. I will be sure to update in a month or so to see if I can tell a difference in my stretch marks after using this product.</li>
    <li> Too early to see significant change but I&#x27;ll add another review later</li>
    <li> Love this cream it has helped my skin so much!</li>
    <li> My brother gain weight and he earn stretch mark on leg, arm etc.. I gave him this cream. He use it everydayamd I felt stretch mark gonna weakening. He want to say thanks to the product.</li>
    <li> not sure if its making a difference yet, but the ingredients are great! quick absorbing</li>
    <li> great price. great product</li>
    <li> This creme dries fairly quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy residue. I am curious to see what kind of results I see with continued use.</li>
    <li> Feels good on the skin and smells amazing. I&#x27;ve had this lotion for a week already can&#x27;t wait to see results.</li>
    <li> My wife has been using it for a week, and she can tell there is a little bit different now.  She likes it.</li>
    <li> Light scent great moisturizer</li>
    <li> I love this product it REALLY works when I order this it arrived on time and was everything they said it was i have been using this for about 2 weeks now and I have seen results my sterch marks are fading and my skin tone is lighting this is great i have ordered 3 more bottles it is nice to find a product that works!!!!!!! Thank you</li>
    <li> Great cream, I have been using for a few days and I have notice slight a slight change in my stretch marks.  I will continue to use this, and hope for the best results. Great communication from the company before, and after the sale.  Also fast shipping and great price.</li>
    <li> It has a great scent and is very silky. Not sticky or thick like other products.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product and when it arrived I was disappointed it was that small compared to other products I have used for stretch marks. Any how I&#x27;ve been using it and honestly I have not seen much of a difference in regards to my stretch marks however I do feel my skin much much softer than before. It is probably too soon to tell whether this product does in fact diminish the look of stretch marks but I will keep applying it and hope for positive results. Again the downside to this product is that it&#x27;s such a small amount of product, it runs out way too fast.</li>
    <li> I have a lot of stretch marks but they didn&#x27;t reduce the appearing. It does make my skin feel really soft. My stretch marks are old maybe if you use when they are coming out it would help.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t used it long enough to 5 star it yet, but I love the smell and the feeling! Using it on the cellulite and side stretch marks and can already notice some change.  It is a large bottle for the price especially if you are using small amounts. I&#x27;d recommend it.</li>
    <li> i hope they make bigger bottle for cheaper price. Its too pricey for its size. I feel my skin soft but no changes on stretch marks so far. Still hoping for vest result.</li>
    <li> When circulation is poor, it leads to an uneven skin tone, wrinkle and stretch marks. With that being said i&#x27;m so happy i got this product to review free and test out on my stretch marks left over from my pregnancy i mean i tried everything i use cocoa butter and ever varieties of stretch marks creams and to my disbelieve nothing work until i try this stretch mark cream and in a few days i noticed a subtle difference the cream is Working I mean it&#x27;s definitely up there with the highly cost stretch mark product and it&#x27;s less expensive than others  it&#x27;s a pleasant smell and it doesn&#x27;t leave my skin itchy and irritated. my stomach feels very tight and moisturisetell if your pregnant or you just had a baby this is the product for you and your stretch marks.</li>
    <li> Using it for about two weeks now, can&#x27;t really tell the difference or it&#x27;s just not working as fast as I thought. I had stretch mark at least for 6 years. I may need a few more bottles to see the difference.</li>
    <li> No results just yet but great quick delivery</li>
    <li> Just started using this product a few weeks ago, and yes, I&#x27;ve noticed a difference. My stretch marks seem lighter and starting a to shrink, just a bit. But it is making a change. I had used another similar product but decided to give this one a try. It just has a real small amount, 2 oz., and using it in a large area, all my stomach, I used it up pretty quickly. So I had to order another. So, so far good results. We&#x27;ll see at the end of the month my results. 1 month because that&#x27;s the time I&#x27;ve decided to see results with this product.</li>
    <li> I am the mother of two wonderful children, ages 9 and 22 months. I love them so much but I have hated what they did to my body. I have tried everything under the sun to get rid of these nasty stretch marks and nothing seems to work. When I got the opportunity to try Mother’s Select Stretch Mark Cream and an incredible price I was so happy to try something I had never tried. When I got the cream I could not believe how great it smelled. I am so pleased to share my finding with you, my stretch marks have to magically disappeared but they are softer and less deep than they use to, and that’s a miracle in itself. I am so glad that I found something that is already giving me results. Amazing!! Thank you Mother’s Select for a genuine product!!</li>
    <li> This cream works wonders! Strongly recommend if you want to diminish stretch marks..</li>
    <li> Package came misprinted, but other than the cosmetic flaw in packaging it seems to be nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have silvery strech marks on the belly from 4 kids. The cream goes on smooth and absorbs well. I don&#x27;t expect instant results, but I will update after 6 weeks of use, as I feel that is enough time to see any result.</li>
    <li> Really cute packaging! Product works really well! Consistency is light and doesnt leave my skin feel weighed down.  I have a few strech marks on my arms from when I lost weight months back. Ive tried cocoa butter and other products on the market but nothing seemed to work.  After just 2 days of using this, i can already see a bit of a difference.  I cant wait to see what continued use will do.  Super exciting!</li>
    <li> It smells good it has a rosey flowery smell. It&#x27;s not greasy. It absorbs quick. You don&#x27;t feel any left over reside after you apply. I apply after I shower at night and in the mornings so twice a day. When you apply move your hand in a circular motion. Three pumps is enough to cover my stomach and two pumps for my upper arms. I will update later to see if I see any results with my older stretch marks.</li>
    <li> I got this product since it also advertised being good at reducing the appearance of scars. I have some surgery scars that I have been trying to find something to help them fade. I tried this product for a few months now and haven&#x27;t seen a noticeable difference. I do like that it doesn&#x27;t have a strong scent. It also isn&#x27;t greasy which is nice and it seems to moisturize well so I might continue to use it just for that alone. It might work better on stretchmarks or smaller scars.</li>
    <li> Does seem to help a bit, I love this companies products.</li>
    <li> I have only had it for about a week! But my stretch marks seem to be fading!</li>
    <li> wow this stuff is amazing i used it one night before i went to bed and my belly felt so smooth. took the itch away over time it has lightened the marks shrunk them and made them less visible. I use this now everyday its way better than anything i ever bought at walmart. Thank you i plan to continue using this product  the benefits are amazing</li>
    <li> I have had the chance to use this product for a little while now. Needless to say I am happy with the results so far. My stretch marks are on there way to being a thing of the past.</li>
    <li> I love this product! not only does it smell good but you can feel the skin tightening when it dries. I just started using it but I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll love the results. I&#x27;d recommend it.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t leave a complete review because these things take time to show you complete results! Lately I have been trying to find ways to make my stretch marks less noticeable because honestly who likes stretch marks!? I&#x27;ve had some great experiences with other stretch mark creams I have found on amazon, and I expect nothing but the same from this brand! I&#x27;ve only used it a few times, but I really have high hopes because of how mousterized my skin feels after using it. I will try to post an updated review after a few weeks of using it, but so far I would recommend it to anyone! I actually already ordered another one for my sister who is pregnant in hopes it will help her too!</li>
