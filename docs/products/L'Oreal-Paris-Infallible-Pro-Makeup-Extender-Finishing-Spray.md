      <li>Great product and great price.  </li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t smudge your make up as you spray it on - plus it has a pump and isn&#x27;t an aerosol (great for the environment).&lt;br</li>
      <li>and it feels great.</li>
      <li>I have recommended this extender to friends and feel it is a great value compared to what you would pay for a department store brand.</li>
      <li>Great makeup spray, seems to add a hint of glow but not oily.</li>
      <li>And its not that great at holding the makeup up.</li>
      <li>This doesn&#x27;t keep the lipstick on but it works great on my mineral make-up and eye shawdow.</li>
      <li>As a girl with oily skin, I am always on the lookout for products that will keep my makeup looking great all day.  </li>
      <li>I will buy again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One happy customer.</li>
      <li>, it has a nicer finish, but this is great too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This product works very effectively.</li>
      <li>I loved how beautiful my skin looked.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m really pleased and impressed with this one.</li>
      <li>For all of my foundations I prepped with Lumene Bright</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m happy to see L&#x27;Oreal, a drugstore brand that I trust has come up with their own setting</li>
      <li>Makes you glow, in a good way.  </li>
      <li>I absolutely loved this product.</li>
      <li>You get a good amount of product for the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a good product.</li>
      <li>and then it continued to make my makeup look good all day.</li>
      <li>This setting spray is just as good-</li>
      <li>Also, the mist is good.</li>
      <li>Product came quickly is the pump is working perfectly.</li>
      <li>I used these when I was in vegas and my makeup looked great more than 15 hrs after I applied it.</li>
      <li>This is a very worthwhile product to keep your makeup on during humid days.</li>
      <li>So I was happy to try Loreal&#x27;s since I love all their products.</li>
      <li>Fast shipping, great product for a very good price.</li>
      <li>This stuff works better than any I&#x27;ve tried!</li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall, I love this stuff!  </li>
      <li>Love it!</li>
      <li>/&gt;This is so much more pleasant than putting primer on.</li>
      <li>/&gt;This is BEST for bold eye makeup, and works MUCH better than an eye makeup primer to prevent &amp;#34;melting&amp;#34; eye makeup.</li>
      <li>Amazing.</li>
      <li>and I feel like it just isn&#x27;t as nice a finish.</li>
      <li>So for eye make up, this is kind of a bust to me, but for everything else, it works great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Honestly?</li>
      <li>/&gt;Three things I liked about the product:&lt;br</li>
      <li>If you want to keep your budget for setting spray under $15 a bottle AND have excellent quality then this is an absolute MUST BUY.</li>
      <li>so the finish is really nice.</li>
      <li>You do feel it on your face - kind of like how hairspray feels but not so sticky.</li>
      <li>But for the price, it honestly isn&#x27;t a dealbreaker.</li>
      <li>honestly couldn&#x27;t tell a difference between the UD spray and the L&#x27;Oreal spray.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve heard so many great things about this foundation, and the hype is true!</li>
      <li>... if you are a fan of more striking makeup, like smoky eyes, or contoured face (check out the youtube videos for how to do this, it is AMAZING), or have bright lipstick...</li>
      <li>Love it! &#x3D;)</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s nice and misty and refreshing.</li>
      <li>don&#x27;t like wording that suggests a product is near perfect, or indestructible.  </li>
      <li>The spray is not sticky or strongly scented, comes in a nice sized bottle to keep with you if you have a biggish cosmetic bag.</li>
      <li>I would love it if it was truly infallible.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;This comes out more like a mist</li>
      <li>An aerosol application may better.</li>
      <li>It works like products that cost twice as much (Urban Decay&#x27;s setting spray is considered the BEST setting spray, and it&#x27;s around $30 a bottle).</li>
      <li>This is the best spray on the market will be buying more especially for my clients</li>
      <li>I love L&#x27;Oreal.  </li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s ok and doesn&#x27;t bother me.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I mostly use this after applying makeup in the morning so that my finish doesn&#x27;t look too &amp;#34;done&amp;#34;.</li>
      <li>You save $7 :)</li>
      <li>Most work well</li>
      <li>By the end of the evening my eyeliner was not &amp;#34;perfect&amp;#34; but it was WAY better than it would have been.  </li>
      <li>This helped with keeping my makeup most of the day.</li>
      <li>I think this just might rock your world even better.</li>
      <li>Model in a bottle is better quality and cheaper</li>
      <li>OK product.</li>
      <li>I thought for sure all of my makeup was going to run because of how liquid the setting spray is.</li>
      <li>I have found that this product works best when used in conjunction with the liquid foundation and pressed powder from the same line.</li>
      <li>Absolutely love this product</li>
      <li>LOVE this product.</li>
      <li>Love this spray and the price.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s just okay.</li>
      <li>never wear makeup more than 12hrs</li>
      <li>It performed so much better than the primers</li>
      <li>so it was ok by me.  </li>
      <li>so I was happy to get it for much cheaper and</li>
      <li>This also makes my skin glow and removes the powdery look, which I love about it since UD doesn&#x27;t give me that type of look</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Awesome setting spray! Prefer this one over UD setting spray.</li>
    <li> Just as good as all the other makeup finish sprays</li>
    <li> works as expected. Your skin condition does effect how well it works</li>
    <li> This stuff works better than any I&#x27;ve tried! Love it! It&#x27;s $16.99 in store Amazon price is great!</li>
    <li> This is the best spray on the market will be buying more especially for my clients</li>
    <li> Yes. Yes. YES! Finally a great make-up setting spray that won&#x27;t bankrupt me! I compared this to Urban Decay&#x27;s Up All Night, and this little bottle L-Oreal accidentally outperformed it! With Up All Night, the spray did a great job of setting my make-up, but it left me with a shiny, chalky, pasty finish. The L-Oreal sets my make-up just as well, but is invisible. It leaves a trace of shine, but doesn&#x27;t leave me looking like I&#x27;m wearing a mask. I&#x27;m really pleased and impressed with this one. Try it.</li>
    <li> I felt like it didn&#x27;t help my makeup stay longer. I have mixed feelings about this product.</li>
    <li> I like this.  This is my first time using a product like this.  I was worried that this would have a strong scent, but thankfully, it smells clean and light.  I can be pretty sensitive to scents, so I&#x27;m happy I can spray this on my face and it&#x27;s ok and doesn&#x27;t bother me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wear contacts and I am finding I need to be careful when spraying this around my eyes, especially around the corners.  If I over spray, I can feel a little sting around my eyes when I open them.  As it is, even when I am careful, I still need to go back after it dries and add a little powder on my eye lids as this makes them feel a little moist and sticky.  Putting a little neutral powder on after I use this handles that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This really does set my makeup and it makes the late day creases around my mouth and eyes much less noticeable.  Other than my eye lids after I first spray this on, it&#x27;s not sticky and I don&#x27;t feel it on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve sprayed it on my lips and have licked my lips later in the day and haven&#x27;t tasted anything awful.  It keeps my eye makeup and face makeup from creasing pretty well.  Especially the eye makeup, I love how it keeps my eye makeup fresh looking for hours.  Actually, now I feel more comfortable wearing a little more eye makeup knowing it&#x27;s not going to crease on me.</li>
    <li> Perfect for dancers, performers, etc. or just for those of us who&#x27;d like our make-up to stay on clear and clean without smudging.&lt;br /&gt;Three things I liked about the product:&lt;br /&gt;1. NO stinky perfumed scent - actually, I couldn&#x27;t smell anything at all.&lt;br /&gt;2. I have VERY sensitive skin and this didn&#x27;t seem to bother it.&lt;br /&gt;3. It doesn&#x27;t smudge your make up as you spray it on - plus it has a pump and isn&#x27;t an aerosol (great for the environment).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most of my products already are long-lasting. This is just an extra &amp;#34;hold&amp;#34; to make sure everything stays in place and looks natural. It is oil-free so easily washed off when it comes time to remove your make-up. You do feel it on your face - kind of like how hairspray feels but not so sticky. Application is pretty easy, just criss-cross your face, then hit the forehead and chin (T shaped)&lt;br /&gt; The price is the only thing I don&#x27;t appreciate for a 3.4oz bottle - $14.99 although with free prime shipping. Granted make-up doesn&#x27;t come cheap, but this is a liquid you&#x27;ll go through quickly...not a long lasting powder, lip stick, etc.</li>
    <li> Worked really well for 8 hours. I have an oily-mixed combination skin and it stayed for around 7 hrs or so before make up got shiny. But it definitely worked better than I thought it would. Make up was not absorbed/dissolved by my oiliness and it really wasn&#x27;t that much... It&#x27;s a good product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a recent convert to makeup setting sprays, but I&#x27;ve been using the Urban Decay All Nighter Long-Lasting Setting Spray for about six months now and I love not only how it extends the wear of my makeup, but also eliminates &#x27;cake face&#x27; when I overdo it :) I have combination skin and get pretty oily in my t-zone, but the UD All Nighter Spray keeps my makeup from melting off and from looking too shiny. It&#x27;s not a miracle worker, but it helps a lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s where I was coming from when I picked up this L&#x27;Oreal Paris Cosmetics Infallible Pro-Spray and Makeup Extender. I did a straight up comparison using the UD spray on one side of my face (covering the other half with a towel) and used the L&#x27;Oreal spray on the other side. At the end of the night, I asked friends if they could tell a difference between one side of my face and the other and they couldn&#x27;t! I couldn&#x27;t either. The spray is denser and slightly finer coming out of the UD spray bottle, but that was literally the only difference I noticed (and the L&#x27;Oreal spray bottle sprays well--no spitting etc.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The UD spray is $14 for 1 oz. whereas the L&#x27;Oreal costs $14.99 for 3.4 oz. They are virtually identical. I might back-fill my UD bottle with the L&#x27;Oreal spray when it runs out, but I&#x27;ll definitely be buying this from now on.</li>
    <li> It helps but isn&#x27;t a miracle worker.  I don&#x27;t know what to say about my skin.  Here in the south I am bombarded by heat and humidity and cursed with oily skin.  Given what this product is up against I was surprised it worked at all.  Some people had such great results that I was optimistic that I would experience the same results but for me that wasn&#x27;t the case.  It definitely extended my makeup from about 3 hours freshness to 6, and instead of looking totally worn out by the end of the day, I only looked half worn out.  Pretty good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like others it did not work to help my eye makeup stay in place.  I finally found a mascara that stays put but even water proof eyeliner put on my top lid ends up under my eyes within a few hours of application.  I sprayed my eyelids hoping this extended would help, but it had no impact.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So overall, I am happy to only look half as bad as I used to, or twice as good, depending on perspective, but it doesn&#x27;t work on eyes and while it will extend your makeup,  don&#x27;t expect miracles.  Your skin type and environment are going to still make an impact.</li>
    <li> This L&#x27;Oreal make up extender has kept my makeup looking fresh all day long. I sprayed it in an X and T pattern as directed on the bottle and that covered my entire face. It does feel wet after application but it dries very fast and has no offensive odor. I wear contacts and consider myself to have sensitive eyes and this did not irritate them in the least. I made no special attempts to shield my eyes other than closing them. I have recommended this extender to friends and feel it is a great value compared to what you would pay for a department store brand.</li>
    <li> My wife has used a few different products for setting her makeup.  Most work well and they  allow her to apply her makeup once and not have to reapply the whole day.  This L&#x27;Oreal spray works similarly.  It goes on with a light fragrance that fades away after little while so it does not bother or irritate  you.  It does not leave any oily residue so it does not detract from your makeup.  It truly allows your makeup to last all day.  In addition the price  is much less than similar  branded products so this is a product worthy of 5 stars.</li>
    <li> I cannot tell that this product does anything that it claims it will do. My makeup did not seem to be anymore smudge proof or fade resistant than normal.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time. Brand new. Amazing. I have combinatiom\oily skin and makeup lasts all day long.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t really understand what this product is supposed to do other than put more money in L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s bank account.  Largely unimpressed with this product.  It did absolutely nothing to keep my makeup in place nor did it make my makeup last any longer.</li>
    <li> This spray doesn&#x27;t work as intended. I also honestly believe the product in this bottle is different from what actually sells in a legit product. The bottle came with the top taped to it, so no real seal there. And the spray nozzle leaves DROPS of the product on my face, and not really a fine mist. And it smells so close to hair spray that I&#x27;m inclined to believe it is actually some weird hair spray refill in a face spray bottle! After taking eons to dry, it was just a sticky non-matte layer of goop on my face! I am thoroughly disappointed! Save your money.&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: After a day of pressing down on it, the spray nozzle works well. But I have a favorite Urban Decay makeup spray that works way better than this! I bought this spray because it was way cheaper than the Urban Decay spray, but it really is no match. This spray nozzle sprays well, but doesn&#x27;t really create a matte effect on my face. It dries up to a dewy (not shiny) finish. And its not that great at holding the makeup up. I&#x27;m now using it in conjunction with my Urban Decay makeup spray so I don&#x27;t waste it/trash it altogether.</li>
    <li> If you don&#x27;t use a foundation for oily skin an of 3 hours you&#x27;re been so oily</li>
    <li> Fast shipping, great product for a very good price. Will definitely do business again, thanks so much!</li>
    <li> I have extreme oily skin around my T zones...this spray lasts for a couple of hours my fav setting spray</li>
    <li> Not a fan, it did nothing. I will stick to Mac Studio Fix spray.</li>
    <li> Great makeup spray, seems to add a hint of glow but not oily. It really smoothes your makeup out, especially if you use powder foundation or have that powdery finish after you&#x27;re done doing your makeup.</li>
    <li> It works better than other product brands.</li>
    <li> This product was delivered promptly.  It works great.  I will buy again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One happy customer.</li>
    <li> Use it before every 12-hour shift at the hospital to set my makeup. Makeup definitely lasts longer and my face doesn&#x27;t get oily so quick with it. Around hour 9-10 is when I need to use a blotting tissue whereas before it was 4-5 hours.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 45 and have been looking at various make-up videos for my 2015 transformation. I am at awe how some of the make up on the women in the instructional videos looks flawless. In addition to a few other products, this type of product was one of the ones that was recommended, so I ordered it when I saw it come up on Amazon Vine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first time I tried this, it was a hot mess. I put it on too close to my face. The instructions say 4-6 inches from face, so the second day, I felt like a pro. I would suggest praying it into the air a couple of times before spraying it on face, as initially, large clumps and bubbles came out.  Since this was the first time I&#x27;ve used this product, I set out in search for YouTube videos and it looks like this product is a contender with &amp;#34;Model in a Bottle&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;Kat Von D.&amp;#34; None of which I&#x27;ve ever heard of.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So without not having anything else to compare this product to, I have to conclude it worked for me for at least 8 hours. Comparing the price to the other two that I mentioned above, this product is least expensive.</li>
    <li> Product came quickly is the pump is working perfectly.</li>
    <li> It keeps makeup on for possibly a little longer than normal but I think it would be better if the spray came out in a fine mist.  It doesn&#x27;t spray out very evenly.</li>
    <li> How did I ever live without this stuff? Since it was L&#x27;Oreal I was a little unsure that it was worth spending the money on, but I would say this works better than any high-end product I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
    <li> For a &amp;#34;drug store&amp;#34; make up item , it&#x27;s really good! Love it! &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> As a girl with oily skin, I am always on the lookout for products that will keep my makeup looking great all day.  I used to use primers and have tried virtually every drugstore brand, but after deciding I didn&#x27;t  really like the way they felt on my face and not finding one that really performed how I wanted it to in the summer (where I have hot, humid, southern US weather), I began to entertain the idea of using a setting spray.  There are a few  already on the drugstore market but the parabens in E.L.F.&#x27;s version and the mixed reviews on NYX kept me from trying them (and I can&#x27;t justify paying for the higher end brands).  When L&#x27;Oreal introduced this one, my interests perked and kept rising as I read the numerous great reviews out there.  I was convinced after having tried their Pro-Matte foundation; it&#x27;s fabulous and really controls shine all day.  Although the setting spray is a bit pricey for the drugstore, there are often $2.00 off coupons in the paper and when buying at Wal-Mart the cost comes to around $12-13, so definitely worth trying in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wore this on top of three different foundations: Physician&#x27;s Formula (PF) NudeWear Touch of Glow Foundation, L&#x27;Oreal Infallible Pro-Matte Foundation, and Hard Candy Glamoflauge Foundation.  For all of my foundations I prepped with Lumene Bright Now BB Serum, and set with PF Organic Wear Loose Powder and E.L.F. Studio Translucent Setting Powder.  I applied the setting spray in the &amp;#34;X&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;T&amp;#34; motion after doing my face makeup but before applying eye makeup.  When it first went on it was so wet!  I was worried it wouldn&#x27;t look right.  However it dried in a matter of minutes and gave slightly different effects.  For my PF formula, my face looked almost airbrushed (or as close as someone with oily skin, minor blemishes, and large pores can get)!  I loved how beautiful my skin looked.  On all of the foundations it gave a slightly dewy glow, but this seemed more pronounced on the L&#x27;Orealfoundation.  On top of Hard Candy, it looked satiny and smooth.  As for performance, it really keeps oil at bay all day.  A teeny, tiny bit of shine poked through around my t-zone, but it looked dewy rather than gross so it was ok by me.  At the end of the day, I could touch my face without coming away with that gross, greasy feeling.  It performed so much better than the primers I used!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I love this stuff!  It leaves a slightly dewy glow on my skin but controls oil all day!  I don&#x27;t have to worry about touch-ups at all.  It comes out in a mist and sets very quickly.  It&#x27;s a little expensive compared to other drugstore setting sprays, primers, and foundations, but to me the price is worth it, especially if I can score a coupon in the papers.  And at 3.4 oz, I think it will last quite a while.  If you&#x27;re in the market for a setting spray and want something that truly delivers on its promises, then I highly suggest checking this product out.  I&#x27;m waiting to find the new setting spray from Hard Candy to see how it compares (it&#x27;s about half the price), but if I&#x27;m unsuccessful in that endeavor then this will definitely become a permanent fixture in my makeup routine.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this product</li>
    <li> OK product. Not really recommended for oily skin. Did not set my foundation at all.</li>
    <li> Model in a bottle is better quality and cheaper</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used this a couple of times since I got it but this is AMAZING so far. It&#x27;s much cheaper here on Amazon than in the store where it can range from $13-$16 depending on where you buy it. Very comparable to Urban Decay All Nighter. It doesn&#x27;t completely matte out your face but I don&#x27;t like the totally matte look anyway so I wouldn&#x27;t like it if it did. It made my makeup look much better right after I sprayed it on and then it continued to make my makeup look good all day. Also, the mist is good. LOVE this product. The only downside I would say is that my bottle came a little icky but that&#x27;s more to do with the texture that the bottle is in general a lot of things can stick to it and make it dirty. It&#x27;s just like the NARS packaging.</li>
    <li> MY wife loves it  her makeup stays put even in high humidity!</li>
    <li> This keeps my makeup from even considering doing anything but staying put all day.  It dries fast after spraying and works like a charm!</li>
    <li> This product works very effectively.(;</li>
    <li> Works! Tried this out last night in the high humidity while barbecuing! My makeup looked just as good as it did when I started!  I was amazed!</li>
    <li> The formula may or may not work.....I can&#x27;t really tell because it does not go on smoothly. It&#x27;s a pump spray so I would end up with visible spray droplets on my face. An aerosol application may better. But alas, as it is, I ended up throwing it out.</li>
    <li> Best I hav ever used!</li>
    <li> I have certain eye shadows and blush that disappear in a blink of an eye unless I put primer on beforehand. To test this product, I left off the primer and put on the makeup most like to fade away even before lunchtime. I followed the directions and the product easy to put on. The scent was light and pleasing and it didn&#x27;t leave any sort of weird feel to my skin. It did, interestingly enough, leave me with a type of glow to my skin. If the product only did that, I would be pleased with it. But, it did as promised, it kept my makeup on all day long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is so much more pleasant than putting primer on. I will be using This Pro-Spray whenever I am using a makeup product that doesn&#x27;t have lasting power. I&#x27;m thrilled to have found such a nice way to keep my makeup set throughout the day.</li>
    <li> I waited a full 30 days to before posting my review because I wanted to ensure the product was working as advertised. There were times that my make up lasted all day and there were a couple of times that my make up was gone by evening. To be fair I was battling allergies and a cold during this 30 days so I feel that using tissue was what made the difference. The only thing that didn&#x27;t set with the spray was my mascara. No matter what I did mascara always ran under my eye.  Other than that I would highly recommend this setting spray.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a month now, and I really don&#x27;t see much difference at the end of the day.  I won&#x27;t be buying it again.</li>
    <li> My current favorite make-up setting spray.  Great product and great price.  Will repurchase.</li>
    <li> In the endless quest to stop my makeup from falling off my face, this stuff helps, but it makes my &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; type skin a bit shiny. To be honest, I&#x27;ve only used it a few times because of the smell. Because it comes at a nicer price than other setting sprays, I really tried to get used to it. I really tried, but I just can&#x27;t. Reminds me of old lady perfume. I can&#x27;t tell if the odor dissipates after a while or I just get used to it, but I don&#x27;t want to risk walking around smelling like it. So disappointed. :( The quest continues!</li>
    <li> couldnt be better, long lasting, no weird smell, great presentation</li>
    <li> I definitely notice a difference when using this setting spray! I have very oily skin and usually have to blot multiple times throughout the day and find that my makeup is pretty much gone at the end of the day. With this spray and a good primer,  I only have to blot maybe once a day and my makeup really stays in place with only a little oiliness.</li>
    <li> Must have product for your make up routine. Sprays evenly with a light mist. Refreshes my face and prolongs the life of my makeup. Definitely a budget-friendly option when it comes to the setting spray market!</li>
    <li> Best setting spray I have used yet. At least for me, this was better than NYX.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve heard so many great things about this foundation, and the hype is true! I&#x27;m a big makeup guru and I love finding sales on things! This is only $10 on Amazon for the big bottle and its $16.99 in stores! You save $7 :)</li>
    <li> This does seem to extend makeup wear, and it doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin.  The only complaint I have is that I don&#x27;t really think I can spray it in a &amp;#34;T&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;X&amp;#34; fashion as per the directions.  One spray doesn&#x27;t last long enough--pressing the pump once just gives you a quick squirt rather than a continuous spray you can control.  I&#x27;m not sure it matters.  The spray pattern is wide enough that I can get my whole face in one squirt.  I read in other reviews that others didn&#x27;t like the bottle as much as the expensive brands, but used this one to refill the more expensive bottles since the spray does work well.</li>
    <li> I lightly spray my face after applying my makeup. my skin has a soft  look to it after I use it. Yes, I would recommend it.  Even if you don&#x27;t wear makeup it can be sprayed over your moisturizer and your skin will look better.</li>
    <li> If you want your makeup to stay fresh all day the. This is the product to use!</li>
    <li> Been using this for the past week. Works great! I do use a primer so not sure how much of the spray is keeping my makeup fresh and in place. Will use without primer to see. I live in the south where it is hot and humid. And I have oily skin. So anything that helps my makeup stay on longer is a win for me!!</li>
    <li> Name brand makeup setting spray are really pricy... So I was happy to try Loreal&#x27;s since I love all their products. The direction says to use it once at the very end. Living with humid summers it did not seem to work as well and my face is so oily. I decided to spray my foundation brush before hand and it actually sets my makeup sooooo well!! Went bike riding on a hot day and my face was matte with no greasyness!! I am so glad this product works even though the direction says to spray at the end. That definitely did not work for me...</li>
    <li> This spray causes my L&#x27;oreal foundation to wear poorly. It seemed to shatter the foundation and make it pool and concentrate around my pores while oxidizing a horrible orange. Why did loreal release this product????</li>
    <li> this little spray is amazing! i have really oily, acne prone skin and this spray helps my makeup stay on all day. Usually I wear foundation and concealer over primer and then apply some setting powder. However, give it 2-3 hours and my face is already starting to melt off. This setting spray made my makeup last all day - and in 90 degree Miami weather! Definitely worth a try. My only issue is that I wish it was a bit bigger. You have to spray 4-6 times to get the full affect and I can see it running out soon.</li>
    <li> great setting spray, makes your makeup last all day. comparable to higher end brands</li>
    <li> This was actually my first setting spray...for the price and quality it can&#x27;t quite be beat except for maybe Mehron&#x27;s barrier spray (I&#x27;ve gotten that as low as 7 for 2oz and you only need like 2-3 sprays of that vs 4-6 of the L&#x27;Oreal)..&lt;br /&gt;I never wear makeup more than 12hrs (12hrs is rare for me but still the longest ever) and don&#x27;t notice any dewiness (not even slightly oily or wanted to blot then) until about MAYBE 8-8.5hrs in. My regimen is an oil-control face wash (Cetaphil),  witch hazel for toning, oil-control &amp; oil-free face moisturizer (Cetaphil or oil-free for combination/oily by Olay), matte/mattifying primer (W7 Camera Ready or Smashbox Studio Finish), a matte/oil-absorbing or oil-free/spf-free foundation, matte/oil-absorbing powder for setting and this spray. I&#x27;m leaving room for error/higher score just because I have not done all of my previous steps using my other setting sprays by Skindanavia (oil control formula), NYX (matte version), or Model In A Bottle (sensitive skin formula) for as long as I put this L&#x27;Oreal Spray through. If you want to keep your budget for setting spray under $15 a bottle AND have excellent quality then this is an absolute MUST BUY. If you&#x27;re less oily and maybe more of an combination or normal or dry skin girl I think this just might rock your world even better.</li>
    <li> Generous sized bottle of light mist that sets and holds everything in place except lipstick all day long without touch ups.</li>
    <li> This doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin, the mist is incredibly light and fine, and it lasts ALL DAY. New favorite setting spray, and that&#x27;s saying something. So affordable, a nice big bottle, and I don&#x27;t have to travel the tempting, bank-breaking aisles of sephora to get it.</li>
    <li> Well, my goodness!  This stuff really works!&lt;br /&gt;I put on liquid foundation, blush, eyeliner and mascara and a touch of lipstick this morning and the coverage of my foundation did not change (usually it has faded after a few hours), my eyeliner stayed in place and my mascara did not smudge.  My  lipstick did disappear, but that isn&#x27;t a problem in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;There is no scent, I like the light non-aerosol spray, and it is extremely easy to use.  I&#x27;m sold!</li>
    <li> I tried this finishing spray for New Year&#x27;s Eve and everything did stay in place until I took off my makeup. The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it five stars is because it does have a chockfull of extra chemicals to put in your face, so if that is something that would bother you, keep it in mind. The spray is not sticky or strongly scented, comes in a nice sized bottle to keep with you if you have a biggish cosmetic bag. Not sure that I would use it on a daily basis, although I did like not to have to reapply makeup at all. (I usually have to touch up my blush at least once in an eve). If you have pro makeup already I&#x27;m not sure you&#x27;ll need this because the pricier brands do tend to last a long time, but I do use MAC blush and have to reapply and with this I didn&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> I tried this product  daily for seven days.  The directions state to spray the solution in the pattern of a &amp;#34;X,&amp;#34; horizontally across the eye area (with closed eyes), and vertically from the forehead down to the chin.  It has a scent but it&#x27;s not overowering.  It takes about a minute to completely dry.  It doesn&#x27;t cause any irritation, although my skin is not super sensitive.  It may be slightly drying but nothing major.  I apply my makeup between 6:00-6:30 A.M.  and usually wash it off around 9:30 P.M.  This stuff holds everything in place all day and even seems to help control shine.  This is not something I would use on a daily basis but for a special occasion when I&#x27;m wearing full makeup.  Overall, it works pretty well.  I&#x27;ve tried the Elf version and didn&#x27;t care for it at all.</li>
    <li> I absolutely loved this product. I have wanted a makeup extender for a long time but didn&#x27;t want to pay $17-$30 at the drugstore. This came sooner than expected, is easy to use and doesn&#x27;t leave my makeup looking oily, spotty, etc. I put this on in the morning and my makeup lasted all throughout the day (almost 12 hours!) I&#x27;ve also used the spray in the morning and my makeup stayed looking flawless even after going to the gym. Would definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> Some background info:  I use setting spray to keep my makeup lasting all day.  I have combo skin with oiliness on/around my nose and chin.  I own Model In a Bottle and Urban decay&#x27;s All-Nighter.  My favorite is Urban Decay, since I find the MIAB too sticky, as well as ineffective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Compared to Urban Decay&#x27;s All Nighter spray, the L&#x27;oreal spray doesn&#x27;t do much to prolong the wear of my makeup.  However, unlike the UD spray, my face doesn&#x27;t feel still as...stiff?  I don&#x27;t know how to explain, but when I use the Ud spray, it locks the makeup in so well that I can feel it.  This also makes my skin glow and removes the powdery look, which I love about it since UD doesn&#x27;t give me that type of look and I&#x27;m too cheap to get Mac&#x27;s Fix + just for that purpose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend to those who are looking for their makeup to be bulletproof and long-lasting.  However, if you have issues with your makeup looking powdery and dull, use this stuff.  Makes you glow, in a good way.  Rating 3 out of 5 stars.</li>
    <li> Besides this setting spray i have used UD all nighter. Works just as good as high end for 1/3 the cost</li>
    <li> Works very well. Comparable to the much higher priced product. I mostly use this after applying makeup in the morning so that my finish doesn&#x27;t look too &amp;#34;done&amp;#34;. It seems to work adequately as a setting spray. Occasionally, I use it during the day as a refresher.</li>
    <li> What can I say for a drugstore product this stuff is amazing and works the same as my all nighter spray that cost double this I will save myself the money and buy this for now on.. My make up stays on and stays flawless all day even in the 115 Arizona heat</li>
    <li> WHY would you spray alcohol on your face!  This stuff is horrible!!!!!  I want to give it a 0</li>
    <li> I usually use Skindinavia Bridal Makeup  setting spray.  But,  upon reading some of the reviews here and on You tube, I decided to give this L&#x27;oreal Paris Pro-Spray a try.  This setting product worked just as well as the Skindinavia Bridal Makeup setting spray that I had grown accustom to.  However, my one complain is on how large the droplets from the spraying mist pump are.  I resolved that problem by simply replacing the pump on this product with the one on the Skindinavia Bridal Makeup one.  Now, when I spray my face with this Skindinavia Bridal Makeup pump, I get a more even and light mist, instead of an uneven mist... The product will last longer, less product waste..  So, If you love this product but not the pump, do as I did, and switch the setting spray pump...</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a huge Urban Decay All Nighter fan and have used it for years. To find something that works just as good for half the price would be a godsend... This isn&#x27;t it, though. It works, don&#x27;t get me wrong, just... Not for as long as they say it does. I&#x27;m a face toucher throughout the day, UD can stand up to my hands rubbing my face all day long, but the L&#x27;Oreal can&#x27;t. It wears off by afternoon. Since I don&#x27;t carry my makeup with me, that&#x27;s a problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the plus side, it&#x27;s very light and refreshing like Urban Decay and it feels great. There&#x27;s no stickiness to it and it applies evenly. There is no scent so it doesn&#x27;t bother people with sensitive noses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s something I will keep on hand as a backup, but it&#x27;s not my go to makeup setting spray.</li>
    <li> The ingredients don&#x27;t sound all that safe to me, but it does what it is supposed to do.  Make-up doesn&#x27;t last all that long on me (and lipstick lasts 15 minutes tops.  This doesn&#x27;t keep the lipstick on but it works great on my mineral make-up and eye shawdow.</li>
    <li> It helps with making your face look less powdery but not sure if it actually keeps my makeup on longer .its pricey for drugstore but a lot less the ones you get from ulta or sephora so still on the fence  so we shall see</li>
    <li> Are you always told, &amp;#34;Why don&#x27;t you wear any make-up?&amp;#34; My mom has been saying this to me my whole life and guess what....I AM WEARING MAKE-UP! At least I put it on in the morning - but an hour later it looks like I have not done anything...no matter if I use primer or the make-up says &amp;#34;12 hour wear&amp;#34;. Basically I have wasted my time and money bothering to put make-up on at all! Well I took a chance on this product and WOW! It actually works. It keeps my make-up on all day and it doesn&#x27;t break me out like I expected from something like this!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried a number of makeup setting sprays. L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s version ranks up there with Kat Von D&#x27;s Lock and Load and UrbanDecay&#x27;s Setting spray. L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s has a very light fragrance; a couple spritzes up/down and side-to-side will adequately cover face and eye makeup. It dries quickly, and a bottle will last a while at 5-6 sprays per use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I usually do my full makeup, except mascara -- for some reason, it rubs/runs a little if I use the spray after, so mascara is last. Lip color -- especially glosses and tints -- will also come off, but the spray adds staying power to matte colors.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff.  I will definitely be purchasing this again.</li>
    <li> I have found that this product works best when used in conjunction with the liquid foundation and pressed powder from the same line. I used these when I was in vegas and my makeup looked great more than 15 hrs after I applied it. My skin is normally very oily but this kept the shine away the whole time and kept my makeup from transferring as well.</li>
    <li> Was very hopeful after all of the reviews, but it is not as good as UD All Nighter. The spray does not come out in a fine mist, it shoots out in a heavy spray, and even though I was inside all day, my face was shiny, and goopy in my T zone within three hours.</li>
    <li> I love this setting spray. I live in a really humid climate and it helps my makeup last without melting off my face. It also takes away powdery look. And is a great alternative for Urban Decay setting spray!</li>
    <li> So when I got this It had leaked about a third of the bottle into the packaging.  But I just washed the bottle off and it was fine.  It works... But it smells terrible. Like chemicals... Which it is... Just most Sprays at least mask the chemical  smells a little better. If you can get this at the store instead of Amazon  I would really recommend it.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical about setting sprays. However, this works really really well! One tip- if you spray too much it will not dry fully, and you will smudge. I thought &amp;#34;the more the better&amp;#34; and went overboard one day. Whoops.</li>
    <li> I tried this out for a Christmas Eve party.  I followed the directions precisely, I was a little surprised that it was not an aerosol but rather a pump spray. But I still gave it a whirl.  Droplet size was still pretty small and felt rather &amp;#34;misty&amp;#34; so it wasn&#x27;t like my face felt too wet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had on full make up, but I noticed that this did absolutely NOTHING to hold my lipstick on.  It came off with the same speed it always does.  I felt like everything else stayed on pretty well.  By the end of the evening my eyeliner was not &amp;#34;perfect&amp;#34; but it was WAY better than it would have been.  It was a little bit scuffy on one of the lids but not terribly bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was exhausted after the party and then having to get my mother AND mother in law settled in AND also get the kids gifts under the tree AND get myself/hubby to bed I didn&#x27;t have time to wash makeup off.  In the morning it was pretty much all on.  So aside from it not working on lips... this stuff WORKS.  Give it a try.  I&#x27;ll still give it 5 stars even though it didn&#x27;t hold my lipstick on.</li>
    <li> Great product! Long lasting</li>
    <li> I only recently started using this kind of beauty product when a clerk at Sephora told me about setting spray. I had been complaining of a too-matte look. She suggested, that instead of dusting loose powder on, I forego it and use this to set my makeup instead. It gives me a dewy look without shine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before L&#x27;Oreal, I had been using Make Up Forever brand. Both work well but MFU comes in a tiny, pricey bottle that requires more than one spray app to do the job. This comes in a chunky, easy to hold sprayer that covers more in one shot. Other reviews complain about it not setting eye makeup or lipstick but it&#x27;s primary use is to set face makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let&#x27;s face it (haa) we eat, drink, talk all day - nothing can keep your lipstick from wearing off. I find it does keep my eye makeup from changing if I close my eyes tight and manage a very light spray. That&#x27;s the key, a very light hand. Don&#x27;t go all 50&#x27;s Aqua Net, creating Pig Pen dust clouds. Skeptics, just try it. There&#x27;s a learning curve but it&#x27;s a lesson well learned.</li>
    <li> This spray is a miracle saver after time spent on applying your perfected makeup. Just a little spritz on your face after the make up is applied and it helps keep the makeup in place. It&#x27;s a mist, so there&#x27;s no over applying to make your face wet and the results lasted all night long.</li>
    <li> I like this product.  I would love it if it was truly infallible.  My makeup does wear down by the end of the day. I have heavy eyelids, and my lipstick always comes off because I lick my lips a lot.  I won&#x27;t really hold it against this product.  Some people just have a terrible time, eyeshadow coming off, eyeliner smearing.  It&#x27;s a fact of life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t like wording that suggests a product is near perfect, or indestructible.  I love L&#x27;Oreal.  I have their infallible eyeshadows - several colors.  Some eyeshadows are not worth the money, but these are.  However, the hood of my eyelid rubs off the shadow after awhile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So what I did was to put the infallible eyeshadow just at the lash line over and under, with L&#x27;Oreal eye pencil on the insides of my bottom lashes. That makes the eyes pop.  Then I use my moisturizers and essential oils under my vitamin complex liquid.  I use concealer under the eye a bit, and just a bit of foundation to cover a few areas on my face.  I misted the pump spray on my face and allowed it a reasonable amount of time to dry.  Lipstick always dries my lips so I had a bit of gloss on top.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did notice that the black eyeliner didn&#x27;t run or smear after nearly a whole day.  Next time I will use a primer for makeup (by urban decay) on my eyelids, and that will seal the deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product does in fact work - but to en extent not represented in it&#x27;s name.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do recommend this, though, because, HEY! we all need extra help when we get all prettied up and go out on the town or to a wedding.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been careful about how much I get near my eyes, so it&#x27;s a little less effective there for me. My eyes are just abnormally sensitive, though, so that won&#x27;t affect most people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, it&#x27;s doing a good job of keeping makeup on and keeping me from having to fuss about making sure it&#x27;s all tidy and in place multiple times a day. I&#x27;m surprised by how effective this kind of thing can be.</li>
    <li> For the past year or so, Urban Decay Makeup Setting Spray has kind of ruled the roost in the beauty world when it comes to setting sprays. I use the &amp;#34;Chill&amp;#34; (hydrating and cooling) and standard version of the UD setting spray and I have never even considered looking for an alternative because I have been so happy with it. But here&#x27;s a little secret... L&#x27;Oreal purchased Urban Decay a few years ago and they have taken the magic that makes the Urban Decay setting spray so amazing and put it in a cheaper version. Shhhh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To be fair, I don&#x27;t know for sure that they just bottled the UD spray into the L&#x27;Oreal bottle, but the ingredients are super similar - in fact, they are almost the same, just the amount of each ingredient is slightly different. But what really matters to me is how well it works, and the L&#x27;Oreal spray is every bit as good as the UD spray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I honestly couldn&#x27;t tell a difference between the UD spray and the L&#x27;Oreal spray. They even smell similar (the UD &amp;#34;Chill&amp;#34; gets an extra point for smelling slightly better than the UD standard or L&#x27;Oreal version, likely due to the addition of aloe). I followed the directions (same directions as the UD spray, just sayin&#x27;) and applied the L&#x27;Oreal spray in a T and X motion and then let it dry. My makeup stayed in place all day, no smudging or sliding or smearing at all. And, unlike setting powders, it made my face look dewey (not shiny) and fresh. I even find that I can go without a primer if I am using the spray, but if you are going somewhere sweaty or where you really want your makeup to last for hours and hours, a primer plus the spray will keep your makeup in place like a tattoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, sorry Urban Decay. I love you to pieces, but why should I pay $30 for your spray when L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s Infallible spray is every bit as good and costs half the price? (However, note that the L&#x27;Oreal version is .6 of an ounce smaller than the Urban Decay, so still cheaper but not technically half the cost.) The only thing that will keep me returning to Sephora for the Urban Decay spray is the &amp;#34;Chill&amp;#34; version, since the L&#x27;Oreal spray only comes in the one version. If they are smart, they will expand the line, because setting spray is one of those things that I never knew I needed until I tried it and now I find that I can&#x27;t live without it.cost.)

    <li> Honestly? When I initially got this, I wasn&#x27;t sure it was going to be useful. I mean, the first two ingredients are water and alcohol. What could the product really do?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And, to be frank, for daily minimal makeup wear, this product is absolutely unnecessary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HOWEVER... if you are a fan of more striking makeup, like smoky eyes, or contoured face (check out the youtube videos for how to do this, it is AMAZING), or have bright lipstick... this sets the makeup, keeps the colors without melting them, and lasts from morning till evening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend this product. It works like products that cost twice as much (Urban Decay&#x27;s setting spray is considered the BEST setting spray, and it&#x27;s around $30 a bottle). Frankly I like UD&#x27;s product a lot, it has a nicer finish, but this is great too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is BEST for bold eye makeup, and works MUCH better than an eye makeup primer to prevent &amp;#34;melting&amp;#34; eye makeup. So if that is your style, you absolutely need this product. It works okay, not great for lipstick (lipstick will HAVE to be reapplied, but I haven&#x27;t really found any lipstick that literally lasts all day).</li>
    <li> This product has a soft, clean scent and has a refreshing feel when sprayed.  It helps to extend my makeup wear and I would recommend it to anyone looking for some help to keep their makeup looking fresh all day.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve seen quite a few reviews for this product on youtube, and after hearing that it&#x27;s an affordable, drugstore version of Urban Decay&#x27;s setting spray, I decided to try it out. I&#x27;ve had sample sprays of Urban Decay&#x27;s setting spray and I do think they&#x27;re pretty comparable. (Also, L&#x27;Or&amp;eacute;al owns Urban Decay, so it&#x27;s possible that the products may have a similar formulation.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I feel like the spray really pulls my foundation together. Like it sort of melds all the makeup so the finish is really nice. I&#x27;ve gone days of wearing foundation without the spray and I feel like it just isn&#x27;t as nice a finish. I&#x27;m oily-combination and with my degree of oiliness, I always end up blotting and repowdering. This doesn&#x27;t change even with this spray, though it does prolong the time between initial application and blotting/powdering. Many of my days are 8+ hours, and this spray does make a difference. It is also pretty much scentless which is great. You get a good amount of product for the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only qualm about this product is that I don&#x27;t really like the nozzle. The way that the product sprays is really... weird? I don&#x27;t feel like the mist is very fine, and it kinda gets all over (which I guess isn&#x27;t a big deal since it&#x27;s pretty much odorless and also colorless). Like there are bigger drops of liquid interspersed with the actual mist is what I&#x27;m trying to say. Haha. But for the price, it honestly isn&#x27;t a dealbreaker. You can put up with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I&#x27;d say definitely go for this product. It&#x27;s a great deal listed on Amazon (at my local Target it retails at ~$12 and at Walgreens and such I&#x27;ve seen the price go all the way up to $15).</li>
    <li> I have bought this product before and Was surprised at how cheap it was to find it on amazon. However, I&#x27;m certain this product container doesn&#x27;t actually contain the correct fluid that this is supposed to have.</li>
    <li> I definitely noticed a difference in the staying power of my makeup after using this setting spray. I would always need to touch up my foundation or concealer through out the day before and now I no longer need to do that. The smell is fine and it doesn&#x27;t leave your skin feeling sticky or heavy. I do recommend this.</li>
    <li> This helped with keeping my makeup most of the day. I don&#x27;t think it helped with any oil control though. The sprayer could be a little better about misting rather than spraying large sized drops onto your face. It&#x27;s also fairly expensive for a drugstore brand in my opinion.</li>
    <li> Love this spray and the price. I wasn&#x27;t expecting a high end quality product, but this one is as good as others I&#x27;ve bought as Sephora.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s just okay. I was excited to see a drugstore version of this product. It seems to do the job but I don&#x27;t really like the way the spray comes out. It isn&#x27;t really a mist, more of a splashy windex feel.</li>
    <li> This setting spray is lightweight and does a pretty good job of keeping makeup in place (or mostly in place) all day. I tend not to wear a lot of makeup--just BB cream and powder most days, sometimes mascara and eyeliner. This spray is great for the cream and mascara and but doesn&#x27;t keep pencil liner from totally smudging.</li>
    <li> Love it, highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> Great product! But a little too pricy.</li>
    <li> No side effects from use. Excellent product.</li>
    <li> I have dry skin so I really don&#x27;t like having to set my makeup with powder and especially with New York&#x27;s severe summers, I don&#x27;t wanna look like I caked powder onto my face. In stores this product is about $17-18 so I was happy to get it for much cheaper and so far it&#x27;s been great and holding my makeup together during these hot summer days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know it feels stupid to apply this since you have to hold the bottle like 8 inches away from your face and then spray it like 8 times, but so far it&#x27;s been worth it.</li>
    <li> I usually use UD AllNighter,  I was looking for something different. This does work well with my powder foundations but not so much with whipped or creme. I don&#x27;t notice as much shine control but when first applied it looks good. It&#x27;s not bad to help get a more natural look in the morning and get rid of the powder-y face but it&#x27;s not great for helping makeup last all day long.</li>
    <li> This is the large size bottle that I can not find in my local drug stores or department stores. It is exactly as the smaller version in the materials used in the bottle and the product. It does not sting, just close your eyes and spray lightly in an X and then a T motion and wait about 1 minute to let your make up set. This is a very worthwhile product to keep your makeup on during humid days.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t buy. Save your money. I purchased this product expecting to see a difference in my make up by it lasting longer, not!</li>
    <li> I was so happy that l&#x27;or&amp;eacute;al finally came out with a setting spray!  I&#x27;m always looking for ways to help my makeup last a long time.  I normally wear rimmel, covergirl, or my tarte foundation.  I am so upset to say that, despite having oily skin,  this dryed my son out sooooo bad!!  I&#x27;m talking to the point of bleeding and cracking.  And that NEVER happens to me!  It&#x27;s been a week and I&#x27;m still trying to get my skin back to normal.  If it hadn&#x27;t have been for this one thing, it would be the perfect spray!!</li>
    <li> This setting spray is just as good- if not- better than Urban Decay All Nighter! Good job Loreal!</li>
    <li> I received L&#x27;Oreal Paris setting spray in my Target Beauty Box and had never used a setting spray before. The first time I used it was for my wedding day. I don&#x27;t know why I thought I needed to save it for a special occasion, but I did. All I can say is &amp;#34;Wow.&amp;#34; My makeup.. my entire face stayed in place for over 12 hours. This was the perfect day to test it out on. It last through hair, pictures, ceremony, reception, etc.&lt;br /&gt;I can say that I was not sure what to expect when spraying it and was nervous. Once it hit my face I thought for sure all of my makeup was going to run because of how liquid the setting spray is. I was scared to open my eyes and look in the mirror. Much to my surprise it dries fairly quickly and doesn&#x27;t cause any running. (this would obviously defeat the purpose, but it almost seems magical). I now use this setting spray on a daily basis to work and still love the results. The bottle lasts quite awhile too, great value!</li>
    <li> You&#x27;ve gotta try this... it&#x27;s great!</li>
    <li> I tested this out in 100 degree weather and my makeup stayed put! Also great to spray on your face as a primer!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never used a product like this before, but certainly am a fan now. It does a great job setting your make up and keeping it lasting all day without needing those touch ups. I use mineral powder foundation, and do find that it doesn&#x27;t tend to last as long as the liquid kinds. This, however, gives it a longer last on my face, which is super useful. The one downside of this, to me, is eye make up. I don&#x27;t see any difference in how that lasts when I use this, and it&#x27;s also kind of hard to really get this accurately onto your eye make up. You pretty much just close your eyes and spray from 8-10 inches out, but you also have to be careful to not get too much around your eyes so it doesn&#x27;t get in your eyes. So for eye make up, this is kind of a bust to me, but for everything else, it works great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also has no scent that I can tell, and it&#x27;s totally light weight and not at all sticky. I actually sprayed it the first time on my skin without any make up on, to test this aspect. I couldn&#x27;t even tell it was there, nor did it make me break out or dry my skin out. It&#x27;s well formulated in this regard. It also doesn&#x27;t make it difficult to wash off make up at the end of the day.</li>
    <li> There are a ton of setting sprays out there. MAC Fix + being one of the bigger known ones or the one from Urban Decay. But those are pretty pricey for what they offer. I&#x27;m happy to see L&#x27;Oreal, a drugstore brand that I trust has come up with their own setting spray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Majority of the time I normally used my MAC Fix + to foil eyeshadows since I lived in CA and it doesn&#x27;t get too humid out there. But now living in FL, I feel like wearing eyeliner or mascara on any day is just a bad bad bad idea. My face tends to get oily even though it&#x27;s actually dry (so annoying) so pencil eyeliner will 100% smudge. Even if I do set it with eyeshadow. Even then just putting on concealer and foundation makes me feel like it&#x27;s smudging all over the place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This comes out more like a mist so you don&#x27;t have to worry about it shooting out like a spray bottle or a hairspray type. It&#x27;s nice and misty and refreshing. I noticed that it does a better job at holding my mascara and eyeliner in place (trust me, I obsessed checking on the liner). It wasn&#x27;t perfect at locking in the pencil liner but it did prevent it from smudging to the point of raccoon eyes which is always a good thing, amiright?!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely a product to try out if you&#x27;re not down to spend the money for the higher end ones!</li>
    <li> Really great stuff! I bought this because I had heard a good review about it on YouTube and even though I work at ulta and get a good discount I couldn&#x27;t justify paying for the urban decay setting sprays. I figured since loreal bought urban decay it couldn&#x27;t be bad to give it a try even though it&#x27;s not technically made by skindinavia. I wore it for the first time today for work and it really felt significantly better than the elf setting spray and I felt it worked just as well as the All Nighter. I felt like I could actually touch my face for once and not have movement. My skin felt soft and matte all day. Very please and I&#x27;m glad I got it for half of the store price!</li>
