<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This is a compliment maker!</li>
    <li> It was a blind buy and it was a let down. I bought based on the create reviews. It has a cheap smell and a powdery dry down. I tossed it out after the first spray. Waste of money. If you like Aqua like colognes like me, then skip this.</li>
    <li> A nice clean fresh scent. This is a perfect natch for my husband. The bottle is huge, so this should last a while. I would definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m going to keep this short and simple.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This particular cologne is awesome, my friends and girlfriend compliment me on it every time I wear it, and I&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Personally do enjoy the fragrance of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am happy with both my Colognes, this and my regular Chrome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s simply no more to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want to smell good all day long, use these, you won&#x27;t regret it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I bought this product, since my friend told that it was good. I never regret getting this product. Too good. Got a lot of compliments from colleagues and friends</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this Cologne for awhile, one of the best smells you will ever smell.  I&#x27;ve received tons of compliments because it smells that good.  If you like more of a citrus type of smell than you will love Chrome Legend.  Also, come to find out after all these years of buying it at our local outlet, I checked on my favorite website (Amazon) and found out that it&#x27;s half the price than what I was paying at the outlets, Amazon never disappoints, by by outlets!</li>
    <li> Wow smells great. The girls loved it.</li>
    <li> I still have my orginal one so as to compare with this purchase. To be honest, it&#x27;s not as authentic as my original being less powerful. But with such prize I can say a fair trade. So if you don&#x27;t mind about authenticity and wanta good, long-lasting cologne with reasonable price it could be quite a good deal.</li>
    <li> Happy, happy, happy. ... no issues...</li>
    <li> my son loved it came fast and was a nice stocking stuffer</li>
    <li> I bought this from amazon when I realized that Macy&#x27;s wasn&#x27;t carrying it anymore. Funny thing is that i get the same perfume, bigger unit, for less money. GOTTA LOVE AMAZON... I choose standard shipping and I did receive the product two days after I made my order. Can&#x27;t complain.</li>
    <li> Bought this before and a lot of people are asking me , what is the after shave you are using .&lt;br /&gt;This is just awesome .&lt;br /&gt;Will buy again .</li>
    <li> I always like Chrome Legend and Amazon has the best price of anyone. I have a nice big bottle that will last me a long time.  I always get complaints when I wear Chrome Legend.  It smells clean and fresh not a candy loud smell.  I like that.</li>
    <li> If you are like me then buying cologne is something you take pride in. There is nothing better than smelling good and having a hot lady tell you what you already know. I will guarantee that you get compliments left and right and also and few numbers if you buy this. This stuff rocks. Its one of my top three.</li>
    <li> I am a guy and I gave a guy a complement as soon as he walked into the room</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve bought this perfume because it smells good lasts long, it lasts for about 8 hours and even more,I work in a poultry Company and we deal with turkey products and it smell not good but with this long lasting perfume,I smell good.</li>
    <li> Just what expected and at a great price too.</li>
    <li> I actually just received this bottle of cologne from my roommate (he literally has about 50 bottles of different cologne. I had made a comment that I really needed to find my signature scent, so he told me to look through his collection and help myself to a bottle. This cologne instantly appealed to me, and I chose this cologne over others like Diesel, True Religion, Cool Water, Blue, and other well known, reputable cologne brands and scents. This scent is extremely masculine, mixed with a crisp, clean scent that brings a little extra something to the table. It&#x27;s masculine, but not overpowering; more like a caress of aroma that leads the senses of others to the man wearing it. Honestly, women go crazy for this stuff. I&#x27;ve tried a lot of different scents in my time, but i think this one is the end-all for me. If you&#x27;re a fan of True Religion, Tim McGraw&#x27;s Silver (also a damn good cologne), I&#x27;d suggest giving this stuff a try, you will NOT be disappointed.</li>
    <li> Chrome legend is a great price for the size you are getting, however, doesn&#x27;t smell like the regular chrome like I was expecting, doesn&#x27;t smell like the legend either. very long lasting smell. About a half hour after applying the great smell starts working.</li>
    <li> Great price. Fast shipping. Excellent transactions. Thanks. A+</li>
    <li> Smells amazing.  I&#x27;ve used the normal Chrome for years (since 2004), and it was my go-to, regular favorite for the price(about $60 or so at Macy&#x27;s).  Then I stumbled upon this Legend variant of Chrome.  I couldn&#x27;t be happier, the core/base smells a lot like the regular Chrome, it reminds of it, but it&#x27;s more aggressive, I won&#x27;t go into detail but it appropriately smells like a Chrome variant, and a nice one at that... all for a lot less than the original!  So I am a fan now.</li>
    <li> Great product! This was my second order. I believe I have found the fragrance for me!!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband and it smells amazing. He loves it. I will definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> Hey now. I have been down with chrome since 2001 and it&#x27;s still my number one scent to wear. But last year I discovered this little gem and it blew me away. Chrome and chrome legend are all a guy needs to smell like a legend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;update:&lt;br /&gt; It&#x27;s been three years now and this is still my favorite! I get asked all the time what am i wearing and i dont tell them. lol. This scent is one of the best ever created , hands down!</li>
    <li> Smell is not strong enough. I was hoping for more of a crisp smell but instead got a watered down flower smelling bottle</li>
    <li> This is the real thing.  i have used this for years and it cost so much in retail stores, so i thought i would try it.&lt;br /&gt;i am very happy with the product and will order mine here from now on.  it takes about 5 days to get to you, but i got it and use it&lt;br /&gt;everyday.  Ladies really like it.  Ronn of denver.</li>
    <li> I am typically skeptical of purchasing items off the internet, especially perishable items such as cologne. No problems, arrived before expected date, scent smells excellent and fresh (I already own a bottle but it has been discontinued in stores in my area). I am very pleased with Amazon as a whole!</li>
    <li> Bought it for a friend who had previously use the cologne. Smells great. Would definitely repurchase.</li>
    <li> great product but best of all the customer servce was the best part of all received the wrong product at first and not only did they remedy the problem they got it to me fast so that i could give it as a gift</li>
    <li> this product is the best for me. and amazon have did a perfect work always, because it never fail to me. thank you amazon</li>
    <li> This one has very strong scent at first, but it will be fading away in a few minutes and begin to smell good and last very long. I would say this one is my favorite cologne. I would recommend this cologne unless you like strong scent. Btw, i purchased this cologne directly from Amazon, not third-party merchant.</li>
    <li> Not happy with purchase at all. I&#x27;m not sure its the real thing since it does not smell like the last bottle I owed. I do not recommend this purchase from this seller.</li>
    <li> I took a chance and purchased based off of amazon reviews. Smells great on my husband! I can&#x27;t comment on if its a knock off. My opinion looks real nice packaging. I sprayed it on myself to test it out sent lasted I could still smell it even after a shower. Very pleased thanks to everyone that took the time to review it</li>
    <li> I ordered it as a last minute birthday gift. I was a little unsure because  I had only smelled a knock off oil, but I wanted the cologne. My husband loved it!!!  Great choice!</li>
    <li> clean and refreshing scent.  I would think this would be hard not to love.  Inexpensive too!  Don&#x27;t buy some frangrance reviews on Amazon that says these colognes are weak--probably just retailers that are jealous of Amazon.  Never had any problems buying cologne from amazon and Chrome Legend is no exception.</li>
    <li> i feel this is probably a best to have for daily wear speacially in a casual gathering or gym or after swimming.</li>
    <li> works great and super price on amazon</li>
    <li> Great product, delivered promptly, awesome fragrance, and the price was well worth it.  Get a lot of compliments and the wife loves it.</li>
    <li> This is soo good. It makes you feel good and makes others feel good too. Ladies are crazy about this stuff. This stuff is awesome. You need to buy it before you die without it!</li>
    <li> This is one of the best perfumes I have ever smelled, so refereshing and cool. It smells like rain and fruits combined together. I absolutely recommend it.</li>
    <li> This has always been one of my favorite scents</li>
    <li> My Son told me about this stuff. I purchase one for him and one for me from Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; My son was right the stuff smalls great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  I would recommend it to others.</li>
    <li> well i went by reviews and well its good but thats about it . I dont see myself getting any compliments with this but only time will tell. i honestly think it smells kinda cheap. Smell does stay for a bit but thats it not to crazy about the smell.</li>
    <li> Love this cologne. It&#x27;s my husband favorite.</li>
    <li> Smells great, large bottle, and affordable! My husband really likes it and so do I! Also I received this much quicker that expected.</li>
    <li> Great smell and long lasting</li>
    <li> El perfume Chrome Legend by Azzaro For Men. Eau De Toilette Spray 4.2-Ounces llego bien era la presentacion elejida Gracias</li>
    <li> the best cologne ever i get more complements about this cologne then any other cologne i have had i will be buying this cologne again and again. this is a must buy!!!!</li>
    <li> Great smell, refreshing wear, anytime of the day. A combination of fresh marine minerals plus woody scents(at least thats what it feels like).&lt;br /&gt;Very lasting smell. The price is unbeatable. A valuable addition to my collection. Recommended.</li>
    <li> Definitely smelled different than expected. I would not recommend this cologne in a large quantity as a gift because one may get tired of it fast.</li>
    <li> A good strong fresh, clean summer fragrance with good projection and longevity...Good one to have on your summer scent collection; Although it may not be very unique, it&#x27;s one that will get the job done, very peasant smell ( may be a bit strong to some )  but one that I would buy again... and for the prince stand point of view, it&#x27;s a good buy IMO</li>
    <li> Nothing special, and a little too perfume like for my tastes.</li>
    <li> Attention getting! Perfect for the summer!&lt;br /&gt;Women ask for your time!  Professional and distinctive fragrance.  Top shelf. A ten&lt;br /&gt;#</li>
    <li> Excellent product, totally recommended.!</li>
    <li> This is my favorite cologne of all time, not too scandalous or overwhelming scent, just the right mix and you cannot beat the price anywhere! a few sprays is all you need to last the whole day. Just be prepared to be asked a lot what you&#x27;re wearing and enjoy the compliments all day long. This purchase is a re-order,,, hey, I always say, if it ain&#x27;t broke, why fix it ;-) (wink!)</li>
    <li> I felt the top is kind tight, and make some ugly noise. Not bad for what I pay, but still there are perfume cheaper than this and better, like Insurrection Pure II. And also, i would say Azzaro has nice other perfumes like Azzaro Pour Homme Night.</li>
    <li> Fast shipper, great product. Every one loves the scent, it doesnt stain clothing and the aroma is great for every occassion</li>
    <li> The real stuff, smells great.</li>
    <li> I was going for channel but so far I love it, not so strong bt last long enough.... love it. just right</li>
    <li> Very crisp and clean smelling cologne.  I like it a lot and have received many compliments on it.  This one lasts a good portion of the day.  I&#x27;m looking forward to trying Chrome next to compare the two.....Update....After wearing this more often I&#x27;ve come to the conclusion that Chrome is a much better scent than Chrome Legend....Chrome Legend became quite sharp and was a note in there that actually smelled sour to me...Still a good cologne in it&#x27;s own right but it&#x27;s just not for me... I prefer the freshness and not so sharpness of Chrome.</li>
    <li> Fruity yet subtle. perfect for my first upcoming office job. Sure to carry a great scent without being too overpowering.</li>
    <li> This smells sooooo good. I got it for my boyfriend after I kept smelling it on the UPS guy that comes to my work. If you&#x27;re into the clean, masculine scents, this one is A-mazing! Decent price for a good sized bottle.</li>
    <li> It comes off as a bit strong, but let&#x27;s be honest. I wear this for the ladies, and it fulfils that purpose quite well. Every time I&#x27;ve worn it, I&#x27;ve received complements on it.</li>
    <li> Girlfriend doesn&#x27;t like it. It&#x27;s been sitting on my shelf for over 2 years now and I&#x27;m throwing it out tonight. I wore it once and she said it smells too pungent and &amp;#34;old man-ish&amp;#34;. If that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re into, then try this out. For us young bucks though, we are looking for something more subtle and pleasing to our counterpart&#x27;s nostrils.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All-in-all, if she doesn&#x27;t like it, nor do I.</li>
    <li> Great clean smell...lots of compliments....I just wished the smell lasted a little longer</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gifts for family members and friends so I cannot rate this product at this time.</li>
    <li> The smell is very good.Every one really appreciates it.The smell remains all the day. Good to buy as a gift</li>
    <li> The Product is definitely not authentic. I bought this after I used the smaller version from a local Macy&#x27;s that was complimented by everyone. This one although smells similar but fades away in under 2 hours. Whats the point. Will never buy a perfume from Amazon again. FAKE!!!!!</li>
    <li> I am very displeased with this purchase.  We bought 4 bottles, as this is my husband&#x27;s favorite cologne, only, these were fakes.  They smell different (even other people noticed and said &amp;#34;did you change colognes?&amp;#34;) and the sprayer itself doesn&#x27;t work well.  This is a complete rip off, and since it&#x27;s a liquid, we can&#x27;t return it.  VERY dissatisfied.</li>
    <li> I have never had a women tell me that I didn&#x27;t smell great. This is the only cologne I wear. With the great deal you get on this cologne on amazon, you&#x27;d be crazy to not at least give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;IT&#x27;LL BE WORTH IT; just give out some hugs, you&#x27;ll see soon enough.</li>
    <li> The price for the perfume is fair, the perfume it can be a little strong, but smell good. I recommended.</li>
    <li> After reading many of the reviews,  I could tell you NOW that this perfum is not THE original!!!&lt;br /&gt;It is definitely diluted but still smells very good. therefore if you&#x27;re wondering why it is $26 when the original costs $80, now you know.&lt;br /&gt;I wish someone would have wrote the same before I bought it.</li>
    <li> Have gotten countless compliments from both men and women alike! My girlfriend loves this scent! You&#x27;re sure to woo all the ladies with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pretty cost effective as well! Smells fresh, clean, and masculine. I like it better than my Nautica Classic, RL Polo Blue, AND RL Polo Sport. For $24.99, it was a steal! I remember buying a 2.6 ounce bottle for $40.00 at the mall. You&#x27;re getting a really good deal here folks.</li>
    <li> Smells great, I love it on my husband</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m hoping this one is real--the last one I bought didn&#x27;t smell like the chrome legend.</li>
    <li> I got this for my boyfriend and was worried because I only bought it based on reviews online.  I made the right choice because it smells GREAT!  my boyfriend said it was a great gift and hes hard to shop for.  he is mid 30&#x27;s professional btw</li>
    <li> My boyfriend absolutely loves this cologne! two thumbs up!</li>
    <li> I got this for mu husband and I love the scent. It is not too strong and stays with him all day. I love the scent! He likes it too.</li>
    <li> Call me crazy, but I ordered this strictly based on Amazon customer reviews. I was too damn lazy to go to the mall and smell each and every one. Plus, I have come to conclude everything is cheaper online. Now let me tell you, this cologne did not disappoint. When I received this in the mail and began opening the box, I admit I began worrying what kind of smell it would be. It smells great. It&#x27;s quite impossible to describe it exactly. But it&#x27;s fresh and manly. The kind where you catch a glimpse and want to breathe the rest in. I can confirm it is magic. The bottle makes it look like some kind of elixir too. I bet if you drink it you will overcome body odor. Of course, everyone has different opinions on scent so I highly suggest you go ahead and try out a tester at the mall and not be an idiot like me. Or be like me. It&#x27;s quite an adventure.</li>
    <li> This stuff stinks. I trusted all of the reviews and I got nothing but negative feedback from people around me. It&#x27;s too strong and I have not gotten any compliments from women around me, and that is the primary reason I bought this cologne. Don&#x27;t buy.</li>
    <li> great clean &amp; crisp smell. I keep mine in the car. I also had buy some super glue because the silver plastic that lines the upper part of the bottle becamse loose but its all good now.</li>
    <li> Great customs serivce receive an great timely maner, Will most defenetly order again when i run out of this one .</li>
    <li> I purchase this for my husband smells so good and love the price</li>
    <li> It smells great going to order another one</li>
    <li> It is a good and orginal product and i am enjoying it, looking forward 2 buy more !</li>
    <li> Most people love it, I think it is just ok.  Green apple scent is good but just overall not my cup of tea, very good for the price though.</li>
    <li> I am back to smellin&#x27; great!</li>
    <li> could not believe the price and free shipping so I ordered it, this scent lasts all day I get asked frequently what are u wearing</li>
    <li> I like all Azzaro Colognes but this one in particular...the scent(woody and musk) is great and it lasts a long time!&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product to the guys!!!</li>
    <li> I normally use the normal chrome but seeing how much this bottle compares to price/oz to the regular I decided to take a gamble and give it a try on that stand point.  The cologne smells better than the original in my opinion.  It seems to last longer on clothes as well.  As weird as it sounds it tends to have a flowerly smell rather than a brutal musk smell.  The one reviewer who said it didn&#x27;t smell like his bottle probably used the original to compare it to.  This product is much better over all.</li>
    <li> Awesome!  Not too light...not too strong!</li>
    <li> Great fragrance for a great price</li>
    <li> I have bought the Chrome Sport by Azzaro in the past, as well as the regular Chrome.  However, by far the Chrome Legend by Azzaro is the best.  Long lasting, but not a overpowering scent, but a classy scent that last all day</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this cologne and so does my girlfriend, wow.</li>
    <li> After reading some reviews on the quality,shipping, blah blah. I must say I&#x27;m completely satisfied with my purchase. It smells great!!! I don&#x27;t know why some people thought it was diluted, my bottle wasn&#x27;t. And another thing that goes along with any other cologne purchases, people have been complaining about amazon has been sending them damaged,diluted, and the list goes on about products. It&#x27;s not amazon its the third party people. So if you do decide to purchase from amazon, makes sure its sold by and shipped by them. This  Chrome legend is awesome! can&#x27;t wait to see what others thing about it!</li>
    <li> excellent it like it its nice and cool</li>
    <li> I have bought this product several times before,  but always was sold by amazon, this time i didnt realize and i ordered from SavingsClub and it is fake.&lt;br /&gt;Doesnt smell like original, and it doesnt last more than 10 minutes. Don Buy This One.</li>
    <li> Thanks. Fast shipping. Product came completely sealed.</li>
    <li> Love it great cologne</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift for my partner. Just let me say, I want to eat her up! Yum! And the price was great for the huge bottle!</li>
    <li> I cant believe how good this gut smells, wifey cant get enough of this one thank you for the prompt service and extra goodies, I will be sure to come back.</li>
    <li> This is my scent.  It came as advertised!</li>
    <li> I wanted to buy a Cologne for my husband which did&#x27;nt cost too much but still had a great smell. I read the discription of this on Amazon and decided to give it a try.  It is wonderful.  Try it !</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t smell like Azzaro...</li>
    <li> Price is good and shipping too but doesnt smell like the original</li>
    <li> Cologne gets a lot of attention.  Smells really good!!!!!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s one of the best cologne I ever use</li>
    <li> Smells great , I&#x27;ve brought another since buy the first one also cheaper then mall price by 40 bucks</li>
    <li> Prety good purchase! I had to gift my Dad and he really liked it!</li>
    <li> Item as described. Thanks.</li>
    <li> Awesome product. Great price. Fast delivery. Will keep buying as long as it&#x27;s still available.</li>
    <li> This cologne is guaranteed to take your complete breath away!  I am going to wear this cologne out like some deodorant!</li>
    <li> Great product!! Even better price!! I&#x27;ve been wearing Azzaro for years. Always smells great and attracts complements. Will definitely buy again :)</li>
    <li> This cologne smells amazing. I get compliments all the time.</li>
    <li> Very pleasant smell, stays through the day.. But feels a little diluted though..I just hope its the original. Still on the lookout for a better spray</li>
    <li> smells awesome, what more can is say. especially for the price it&#x27;s at, it lasts a very long time and girls dig it</li>
    <li> I think the title says enough. It feels wierd having someone sniff me with moans of pleasure but thats what this gives you.</li>
    <li> One of my favs!  Goes well with my natural sent.  People always compliment and girls can help say wow you smell great...</li>
    <li> The cologne smells nice and last a whole day. I get asked what I&#x27;m wearing almost every day. Love it</li>
    <li> this smells good. I really like it and the bottle is pretty big so that&#x27;s a plus.</li>
    <li> Great buy with great price</li>
    <li> Love this scent.  Smells very masculine and great for an everyday cologne.  The smell is subtle, but lasts all day.  Not too strong, but that&#x27;s a good thing.</li>
    <li> the product is great, cuz it met my expectations, and is original so I gave that rate cuz I like it, the only bad point is that it took so long to get here......</li>
    <li> My favorite cologne the females love it</li>
    <li> The price of this cologne was amazing. We paid $60 for this same size cologne elsewhere. This is a great site to shop to get anything you want. I&#x27;m very satisfied and will be shopping on Amazon all the time now.</li>
    <li> My favourite one. Reasonable price.</li>
    <li> Hard to find cologne.  Smells amazing!!!!</li>
    <li> Not like the original Chrome but still fantastic. It&#x27;s hard to describe the smell but it&#x27;s clean yet attractive and it will leave you smelling good. I bought it at the suggestion of my uncle and I&#x27;m really glad I bought this cologne. It was a good deal too. For a big 4.2 oz bottle, I payed a little over $20 and it was worth it. Shipping was prompt too as it came even earlier than expected. I give it 5 stars.</li>
    <li> Smells almost identical to the original chrome, but is slightly milder. Great cologne overall.</li>
    <li> This cologne smells amazing. I recive numerous compliments when wearing</li>
    <li> I love this scent! It is clean and professional</li>
    <li> YESS !!!!! This fragrance is by far one of the best smelling IV ever smelled. NOT FAKE. Do NOT pay attention to the 1 star reveiws on this certain carrier. GET IT !</li>
    <li> After reading many reviews for this product, I was excited about purchasing it. Unfortunately, after receiving the cologne, I was disappointed and did not like the scent. I guess I learned my lesson not to buy cologne/perfume online before knowing the scent.</li>
    <li> fresh scent that everyone Compliments on.  verified authentic</li>
    <li> I love the way it smells... and the scent lasts for a while&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want something new, get this!!!</li>
    <li> Chrome Legend is a fresh and clean sent that lasts hour after hour.  Very reasonably priced.  I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> I used Azzaro Chrome all the time never tried the Legend. When I tried it oh boy! Lady&#x27;s love it!</li>
    <li> I buy this cologne for my son an all his friends love it so when i saw the price for this 4.2 bottle i just had to buy two.</li>
    <li> When I first started dating my husband I told him to buy this. I smelled it at a cologne and perfume store and fell in love. He still wears it to this day and it just makes me smile! Smells greeeeeat!</li>
    <li> This version of chrome is pretty awesome!! It&#x27;s allot like Chrome in that it&#x27;s light and has citrus tones to it, but it also has a touch of melon to it that rounds it out a bit. All i can say is that i have never had a cologne stop people as much as this one, every time i wear it, i get asked what it is. It&#x27;s funny how it does what a cologne is supposed to do, get woman to notice you, finally one that works, and again at a  budget price. I think the whole Azzaro line might be worth having on hand. Oh yeah, i have to add, this is super strong, i&#x27;ve had woman ask what it was from 6 plus feet away, and it stays with me pretty much into the next day...and that&#x27;s only a couple of sprays.</li>
    <li> Its clean, fresh and metalic sweet.. i like this fragance.. people allways asking me what i wearing..  just chrome legend!!</li>
    <li> its realy  original  and smell awfull.ı highly recommend it. you will not regret.the price also very good when compere with it.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for both of my young adult sons. They love it.  I plan to purchase it again for their bdays coming up. Clean fresh scent that I would like to smell on men of nearly any age.</li>
    <li> I bought it for my son.  It smells so good!  Wonderful fragrance, great price for the amount you get and for the quality!</li>
    <li> This cologne is awesome, especially for the price. I have had many women compliment me on this cologne. I bought this as a blind buy just going by what other users experience. The best part for the price this cologne will easily last 10 - 12 hours on me. Please be advised everyone experiences will vary to due body chemistry.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift for my boyfriend he absolutely loved it. It was as described and even better.</li>
    <li> Great, thank you! Although I dropped and broke it, it was great while it lasted.</li>
    <li> this stuff is strong and fairly long lasting.  When I first used it I put too much on, I guess I was expecting it to be like regular chrome and fizzle out too soon. Nope, an hour later when I picked my daughter up from school she rolled down the window and said my cologne was too strong!  It was too strong in a good way though, it smells good.</li>
    <li> It never disappoint my wife loves it and when i was dating her thats what she fell in love with</li>
    <li> this has been my favorite fragance for years!th eproduct shipped fast and arrive in good shape. the size is good it will last for some time</li>
    <li> Azzaro best smelling cologne for men. Last all day too.</li>
    <li> Not only was the size bigger than expected which is awesome but the fragrance lasted all night and my girlfriend loved it i literally could not get her of my neck</li>
    <li> Nice perfume and very reasonable price. I have bought this from the same vendor 4 times now and I like it.</li>
    <li> great product, I get a lot of compliments from ladies wherever I go. The scent lasts all day.</li>
    <li> Nice size for good price</li>
    <li> Was scared this would be a knock off but it wasn&#x27;t. Huge bottle for great price!</li>
    <li> My favorite cologne!!</li>
    <li> It smells great and lasts throughout the day. Similar to the original Chrome but a tad bit different in its own way.</li>
    <li> This a good perfume,  it smells really good and is durable,  I really live it and best, girls love it too</li>
    <li> Great product. been using this for years and can&#x27;t replace it,</li>
    <li> i have got the chrome legend after being fan of chrome by azzaro and i must say i was pleasantly surprised by it, the shipping was ok, it arrived in excellent condition, and the smell is perfect which reminds me at this incredible sea feeling - aroma, one of my most used lately colognes.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift for my father on his birthday, and he stopped using all the other dozen colognes he has and instead uses only this one. He really enjoyed it; when I got home from college he let me use it, and I found it to be just as great of a cologne. Definitely recommended for anyone just browsing for cologne, this is a great product for a great price!</li>
    <li> I was not sure what to expect at first, but after smelling the fragrance I was pleased, It is heavy a a bit strong at first, but once your let it sit for a little while it begins to calm down and it is enjoyable.</li>
    <li> Everyone comments that I smell great without being overpowering.</li>
    <li> I get more positive comments when I use this scent. Originally received as a gift, I was blown away by how many people told me how wonderful this was on me. Now it&#x27;s a mainstay next to my Prada.</li>
    <li> I HAVE BEEN USING COLOGNE FOR A LONG TIME CHROME LEGEND IS ONE OF THE BEST COLOGNES I EVER USED I ALSO GET LOTS OF COMPLEMENTS FROM THE LADIES ON THS COLOGNE.</li>
    <li> Underrated projection horse! GUARANTEED compliment getter. Want something for hot humid summer days that smells fresh and sexy people? Get this one here! Women have given me more compliments on this one than Versace Eau Fraiche...Versace Pour Homme...Armani&#x27;s Aqua Di Gio...YSLs L&#x27;homme...or other summer classics. Chrome Legend lasts and doesn&#x27;t punk out in heat and humidity.  What a bargain as well for the 4.2 oz bottle. Buy it.</li>
    <li> Bought a bottle for myself,  loved the smell, a couple of friends liked it too. So I ordered a couple of bottles for them. Each time the shipment came on time. Ordered from same vender both times, would order again in the future. A great deal for a 4.2 ounce bottle!</li>
    <li> This was a gift and he was ultimately thrilled. Shipped fast, Packaged well, Very satisfied, will buy again soon. Highly reccomend</li>
    <li> it definitely smells. Smells like I&#x27;m sick like i need a balm for my skin. Didn&#x27;t smell attractive or refreshing. Maybe its not the real deal or this cologne is just bad?</li>
    <li> Been using the cologne for a few years now. The smell is fresh and does not get old. I like the fact that it is not super popular, and the price is right.</li>
    <li> Nice fragrance. I always buy it and will buy again and again. Thanks</li>
    <li> Great smelling cologne that isn&#x27;t over powering or musky. Also comes in large amount to make certain you&#x27;ll have enough for all the ladies</li>
    <li> This is a good Cologne, I would give it 5 stars, but I am giving it 4 so all of you won&#x27;t buy it and I will be the only guy wearing it! Ha!</li>
    <li> Great smelling everyday cologne, but the scent only lasts about 5 or 6 hours. I&#x27;ve gotten compliments on it (more than when I wear the original Chrome scent, actually).</li>
    <li> This one is good too don&#x27;t get me wrong, but It just smells stronger and more for aged men not really my preference. I suggest Chrome Azzaro.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my son. He loved it,fragrance last forever.</li>
    <li> I am fan of Azzaro perfumes, i have Visit, Crome and Crome legend. I tried this brand in Shopping mall, the guy told me that its different from Crome and has a different base notes. After spraying them on my wrists it smelled different at first, so i billed the item. after an hour it smelled exactly like crome. i was shocked, but learned a lesson.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) \\&quot;Never listen to sales guys!\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;2) \\&quot;Try them a check for few hours, and then make decision to buy\\&quot;</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so happy I found this here. Great price !!!!!!</li>
    <li> I had bought this perfume before for my husband from else where, he liked it so much and the fragrance also used to stay a whole day and more..so i bought it again..but i am disappointed...This doesnt seem original...It is not having the same fragrance .so i don&#x27;t think it was original..and the smell doesn&#x27;t even last half a day also</li>
    <li> love this manly scent! and the price was GREAT!! I would buy this again for sure :) love love love</li>
    <li> I very much like this Cologne. I receive compliments all the time, I beleive this scent fits me, but becoming more difficult to find.</li>
    <li> This item is FAKE!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is different than real Chrome Legend (which I have a bottle of), there are also a few marking differences on the bottle..most notably the serial number that is on the back of the bottle. When compared to the real bottle the serial number on the fake is a completely different font than what is used on the real.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will say that this does smell good, but it is not what I purchased</li>
    <li> SMELLS GREAT! HAVEN&#x27;T HAD THIS MANY COMPLIMENTS FOR THE WAY I SMELL SINCE MY ALL-TIME FAVORITE 212!</li>
    <li> Sorry I could not rate this any higher than a 3 would have gone one more star if I could smell it on myself. My sister in law really enjoys this fragrance as she smelled it as soon as I walked in her place (don&#x27;t get the wrong idea folks) I only wish that I could pick up the scent of &amp;#34;clean, fresh ocean air.....smells like green apple and tea&amp;#34; those were her words. I respect the expressions of my dear sister in law so in the back of my mind I&#x27;m moving this one more star to a four. Like I said, that is only in the back of my mind.</li>
    <li> Great Scent - lasts all day long.  I have several colognes, but this is the one that gets comments whenever I wear it.  The price less than half what you&#x27;ll pay in the Mall -- this is the second order I&#x27;ve placed.  Definite cologne to have in your collection!  Must buy!</li>
    <li> great scent; great product</li>
    <li> Really like this smell, of nice &amp; fresh smell, really was excited purchasing this fragrance because was recommended by someone and will still keep using it for a while....</li>
    <li> el producto es la calidad que describen y el tiempo de llegada del producto es el estipulado en los parametros</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not a bad choice for summer! But the smell won&#x27;t last long!</li>
    <li> Great product. I bought for a birthday gift.</li>
    <li> Got a sample of this stuff at a department store and I hadn&#x27;t been able to find this in any store since.  Love the scent and how much it matures over time.</li>
    <li> Awesomeness in a bottle; the best there ever was.</li>
    <li> Chrome Legend by Azzaro is a very crisp and citrusy (word?) scent, that is perfect for an individual that is on the go.  I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> Azzaro chrome flavor is ordinary, low lasting I won&#x27;t refer this item</li>
    <li> I bought this after viewing a lot of good review about it. Quite frankly, doesn&#x27;t live up to the hype. Nothing special and smells wierd when I put it on sometimes.</li>
    <li> Already owned the product so I knew I liked it. The price here was better than any other place I looked</li>
    <li> Nice product I&#x27;m really excited about this</li>
    <li> I was searching for a new fragrance as i&#x27;d been wearing a cologne an ex-girlfriend introduced to me for six years. It was time to be single...and acquire a cologne that matched my new lifestyle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All the women i&#x27;ve met, love it. It also passed the mom test so i knew it was a great choice.</li>
    <li> I received the 4.2 oz version of this EDT today and let me tell You , I was not disappointed .&lt;br /&gt;First of all , even though the bottle cap and neck are made of plastic, from a distance it&#x27;s one of the best looking fragrance bottles I know .&lt;br /&gt;Also, it has one of the best spray nozzles I&#x27;ve ever used . Unlike a lot of other perfumes with flimsy nozzles, You get an even, continuous spray everytime .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now to the important stuff . This fragrance smells great !&lt;br /&gt;If I had to describe this scent with three words that immediately come to my mind, it would be : &#x27;Fresh, Beach, Shower&#x27; .&lt;br /&gt;I get a &#x27;sunny day at the beach&#x27;, &#x27;fresh out of the shower&#x27; vibe from it .&lt;br /&gt;Remember these old ads for Davidoff&#x27;s Cool Water ? They could just as well have been created for Chrome Legend instead .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My previous Beach fragrance was Bvlgari Aqua and to me they&#x27;re a bit similar .&lt;br /&gt;But Azzaro&#x27;s scent is much more subtle, less overwhelming and leaves a note of &#x27;refreshing shampoo&#x27; when I&#x27;m wearing it .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Additionally, I paid less than 30 bucks for a 125ml bottle , so I don&#x27;t think I will need another one for a long time .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great fragrance ...</li>
    <li> I love this on my husband. He tells me that he gets so many compliments on it. I&#x27;m very happy with this cologne and will be purchasing it again!</li>
