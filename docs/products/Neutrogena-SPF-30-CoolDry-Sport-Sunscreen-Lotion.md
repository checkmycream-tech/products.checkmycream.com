      <li>drawback in this is the strong scent.  </li>
      <li>It wasn&#x27;t so strong that I didn&#x27;t want to put it on, but neither did I prefer it.  </li>
      <li>It is not greasy &amp; the fragrance is not too strong.  </li>
      <li>like how this feels, and it seems to stay put much better than the Neutrogena Cool Spray with none of the oily sheen</li>
      <li>This sunscreen seems to work fine</li>
      <li>this stuff feels good, smells pleasant, and once it&#x27;s absorbed does indeed feel light and drier on the skin than some other sunscreens I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
      <li>but I used 30 spf Coppertone Oil Free on my face and my face did not burn at all.</li>
      <li>Fortunately once it&#x27;s applied the scent goes away.</li>
      <li>This is our new favorite sunscreen!</li>
      <li>The smell is mild, which is good for those like me that have sensitive skin and allergies.</li>
      <li>The fragrance is light and mildly floral / soapy, a nice clean scent, and the texture starts out like a moisturizing lotion but once rubbed in is light and pretty much not noticeable.</li>
      <li>For my face on more intense / longer days</li>
      <li>Some people may want a higher SPF, but the 30 is fine for me.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It is protective , and it absorbs quickly without stickiness.</li>
      <li>This new cool dry sport version is ideal for active people, and it would be great for a day of going in and out of the water, or playing sports out in</li>
      <li>It goes on not at all greasy, dries quick, and actually makes my skin feel nice when it dries (which is quickly).</li>
      <li>Favorite sunscreen by far!</li>
      <li>and I like that it is light, non greasy, pretty much fragrance free</li>
      <li>For that reason we&#x27;ve been using the Neutrogena Fresh Cooling spray sunscreen for years, but it&#x27;s sort of a hassle to pack with us.</li>
      <li>It is quite hot and the cool part did seem to hold up to its&#x27; claims.</li>
      <li>/&gt;I am fair skinned and live at high altitude so consequently have a need to use high quality sunscreen.  </li>
      <li>It actually does go on very quickly and absorbs easily.  </li>
      <li>Nobody burned, and my husband would know it right away, because he burns within five minutes, and we were out there longer than five minutes.</li>
      <li>I like the new color scheme on the bottle, as it&#x27;s easy to pick out in a crowded beach bag.</li>
      <li>It was easy to apply and dried on nicely.  </li>
      <li>Though it is not marked as hypoallergenic, I have not had any kind of adverse reaction, and it is dermatologist recommended.  </li>
      <li>While I can&#x27;t really say whether it is more or less effective than other SPF 30 brands, I feel comfortable and safe using it.</li>
      <li>First, it goes on the skin with just the right consistency.  </li>
      <li>Very nice sunscreen - with the usual implied quality of Neutrogena.  </li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t particularly feel cool</li>
      <li>My kids all have allergies to many different sunscreens</li>
      <li>The first day of my vacation I applied the product 4 times throughout the day.</li>
      <li>My husband&#x27;s first comment was \\&quot;It&#x27;s not oily.\\&quot;  </li>
      <li>so I am assuming that it is consistent with the rating that this product carries.</li>
      <li>I personally find some of the spray-on sunscreens to have more of a &amp;#34;cooling&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>My first thought was \\&quot;It</li>
      <li>tested it during a hot day at the beach (in FL) and it held up well to heat, activity and water sports.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It is exactly what I look for in a sunblock.</li>
      <li>My daughter&#x27;s first comment was \\&quot;It&#x27;s not sticky.\\&quot;  </li>
      <li>have purchased so many sunscreens for sports or water play that feel as if you have a layer of oil on you or leave a white coating.  </li>
      <li>This lotion goes on smoothly, a creamy white lotion that quickly turns transparent as it soaks in to the skin.  </li>
      <li>Last year, we opted for the spray on sunscreen which is easy to apply but still leaves you feeling sticky and then washes off much too quickly.  </li>
      <li>Neutrogena Cool Dry Sport Sunscreen was very lightweight and absorbed quickly as advertised.</li>
      <li>It goes on smooth, absorbs quickly, and isn&#x27;t sticky or dry.  </li>
      <li>The sun protection certainly seemed to work -</li>
      <li>/&gt;**I really love how this Neutrogena sunscreen went on smoothly, dried quickly, and didn&#x27;t leave a greasy or sticky residue.**&lt;br</li>
      <li>I know people have mentioned the (slight) scent, but I opened up the bottle and sniffed right at the top and couldn&#x27;t smell anything.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not fragrance free, but the odor is definitely low</li>
      <li>(that is, if it really holds up to 80 minutes of sweaty activity), so I won&#x27;t comment on that.</li>
      <li>I really couldn&#x27;t speak to the effectiveness of the sunscreen as we have not had warm enough or sunny enough weather to try that part out.</li>
      <li>Our family use much sunscreen during the sunny months.  </li>
      <li>That being said, my husband loves this and wants one in the &amp;#34;spray&amp;#34; version.  </li>
      <li>so I am very picky about my sunscreen.</li>
      <li>: when you get really sweaty and wear sunglasses, the sunglasses will cause the sunscreen to rub away.</li>
      <li>We are often by the pool watching my oldest at his swim practices during the late morning hours when the sun can be very damaging to my fair skinned girls.</li>
      <li>had some unseasonably warm weather the last few weeks, so I&#x27;ve been able to test this on two strenuous hikes with temps in the mid 70&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a really pale girl and have always struggled finding the right kind of skin protection, but I&#x27;ve found one at last.</li>
      <li>It does have a slight sunscreen smell that I don&#x27;t love</li>
      <li>It has a mild odor but less so than many sunscreen lotions or regular skin lotions.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used Neutrogena many times in the past and their sunscreen products are consistently dependable.</li>
      <li>5 oz is actually a decent amount of sunscreen - it&#x27;s about 6 inches by 2 inches by 1 inch.  </li>
      <li>My whole family slathered on Neutrogena Cool Dry Sport Sunscreen for a day at an outdoor festival.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I along with my family, wear tons of sunscreen and this is something I would buy, especially if it were unscented!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**I really love how this Neutrogena sunscreen went on smoothly, dried quickly, and didn&#x27;t leave a greasy or sticky residue.**&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have purchased so many sunscreens for sports or water play that feel as if you have a layer of oil on you or leave a white coating.  I am really sick of wasting my money and am glad to have found a few that work well, including this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is great for me in almost every way except that is does have a mild scent.  It wasn&#x27;t so strong that I didn&#x27;t want to put it on, but neither did I prefer it.  That being said, my husband loves this and wants one in the &amp;#34;spray&amp;#34; version.  At under ten bucks for 30 spf or 70 spf, I will be picking another one up in the Neutrogena Cool Dry Sport Sunscreen Spray, SPF 70, 5.5 Ounce!</li>
    <li> My whole family slathered on Neutrogena Cool Dry Sport Sunscreen for a day at an outdoor festival.  Normally, everyone prefers a sunscreen spray, but we didn&#x27;t have any on hand.  The lotion would have to suffice.  My daughter&#x27;s first comment was \\&quot;It&#x27;s not sticky.\\&quot;  My husband&#x27;s first comment was \\&quot;It&#x27;s not oily.\\&quot;  My first thought was \\&quot;It doesn&#x27;t leave an ugly white film.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle is small (5 ounces), but a little dab will do ya, meaning just a small squeeze seems to cover a large area (though with sunscreens, a big dab is better).  Nobody burned, and my husband would know it right away, because he burns within five minutes, and we were out there longer than five minutes.</li>
    <li> Neutrogena has long been a brand name of quality and this product will do nothing to diminish that reputation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am fair skinned and live at high altitude so consequently have a need to use high quality sunscreen.  This lotion goes on smoothly, a creamy white lotion that quickly turns transparent as it soaks in to the skin.  It does have a very mild scent but not particularly noticeable and certainly not &amp;#34;perfumy&amp;#34; in any way.  It is also long lasting, despite a high amount of sweating as I partake in various outdoor sports.  It results in absolutely no threat of sunburn and yet my skin stays soft and pliant despite hours in the sun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all this is a great product for health-conscious people worried about the harmful aspects of too much sun</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t stand the greasiness of standard sunblock, nor the cocoa butter smell (I hate coconuts and pina coladas [and try to avoid getting caught in the rain, too]), and I also sometimes have skin irritation issues with beauty products; so any sunscreen I use needs to be formulated differently. Low odor and low grease are essential.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Neutrogena sunblock gets the job done. It&#x27;s not fragrance free, but the odor is definitely low and it&#x27;s NOT the smell of cocoa butter. It&#x27;s more of a soapy, baby oil scent. It goes on not at all greasy, dries quick, and actually makes my skin feel nice when it dries (which is quickly). It is exactly what I look for in a sunblock. Being that I am in Michigan, I haven&#x27;t had too much chance to try out its blocking effectiveness, but assuming it works like standard SPF 30 sunscreens, I think I&#x27;ve found my new go-to sunscreen.</li>
    <li> It is both a UVA and UVB broad spectrum 30 SPF lotion that wicks away sweat due to a special micromesh technology.  It lasts 80 minutes in the water or after sweating.  That is why it is good for sports or like me working in the yard.  When I first applied the sunscreen it felt a little sticky, but dried smooth, and fast. The smell is mild, which is good for those like me that have sensitive skin and allergies. Though it is not marked as hypoallergenic, I have not had any kind of adverse reaction, and it is dermatologist recommended.  I definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> We hike a lot, and in the high desert we need sun protection even in the cooler months. My problem is I really hate anything that feels heavy or sticky. For that reason we&#x27;ve been using the Neutrogena Fresh Cooling spray sunscreen for years, but it&#x27;s sort of a hassle to pack with us. This new Dry Sport looked intriguing because the formula says its sweat and water resistant, and it lets sweat through so you stay cool.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We&#x27;ve had some unseasonably warm weather the last few weeks, so I&#x27;ve been able to test this on two strenuous hikes with temps in the mid 70&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My husband hates anything that feels sticky or is heavily scented, he liked the feel of this cream, but hated the floral scent. Initially I completely agreed with him, the scent is very feminine. Fortunately once it&#x27;s applied the scent goes away. Another plus is that it does not attract flying insects like some scented lotions do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like how this feels, and it seems to stay put much better than the Neutrogena Cool Spray with none of the oily sheen you get when you mix most sunscreens with sweat. If it was unscented, I&#x27;d give it a resounding 5 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still definitely recommended, but if they ever offer an unscented version, I&#x27;ll be buying that instead of this.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  First, it goes on the skin with just the right consistency.  It spreads nicely.  It also goes on without any oily feel and as soon as it dries, which is quite fast, your skin does not feel it has something foreign on it.  It has a mild odor but less so than many sunscreen lotions or regular skin lotions.  The order dissipates relatively fast leaving a very faint odor only noticeable when you smell your skin very closely.  I don&#x27;t like strong smelling lotions.  At about $10, it is not the cheapest especially given its size but it is a quality product.  As for screening the sun, it is hard to tell but I have not felt my skin burning after being out in the sun using this product so I am assuming that it is consistent with the rating that this product carries.</li>
    <li> The sunscreen does a really good job with going on smoothly. It does have a scent, but the scent is pleasant. The scent also didn&#x27;t seem to attack insects, which was really my major concern. While I can&#x27;t really say whether it is more or less effective than other SPF 30 brands, I feel comfortable and safe using it.</li>
    <li> Works great, smells good and stays on a long time. No burn here:}</li>
    <li> We always use Neutrogena sunscreen in our household.  This new cool dry sport version is ideal for active people, and it would be great for a day of going in and out of the water, or playing sports out in the sun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The odor is light and pleasant. The lotion itself goes on easily and is not greasy.  Some people may want a higher SPF, but the 30 is fine for me. I like the new color scheme on the bottle, as it&#x27;s easy to pick out in a crowded beach bag.</li>
    <li> Neutrogena is a good brand and I&#x27;ve never disliked a product from them but this one I don&#x27;t like. Mostly because of the scent. It has a strong fake lime/ floral smell. It is the most strongly perfumed sunscreen I&#x27;ve ever encountered ,and the scent lingers.  I only used it on my arms. If I used it all over I&#x27;d be in a cloud of fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is protective , and it absorbs quickly without stickiness. But due to the scent I will not use this again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A 4 star product ( if it smelled better) that I&#x27;m giving a 3 because it works but I&#x27;d give it 1 for the scent.</li>
    <li> This sunscreen seems to work fine and it doesn&#x27;t feel too heavy on the skin.  I personally find some of the spray-on sunscreens to have more of a &amp;#34;cooling&amp;#34; effect.</li>
    <li> Love this sunscreen! I use it when I run and I like that it is light, non greasy, pretty much fragrance free ( I don&#x27;t smell like a coconut tropical drink) and made by a trusted brand. I hope it comes in a bigger bottle because this will go fast.</li>
    <li> I have the Neutrogena SPF 30 sunscreen. This sunscreen did its job great.  No one in my family was sunburned after an afternoon of swimming.  It was easy to apply and dried on nicely.  As far as mainstream sunscreens go, Neutrogena is one of my favorites.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One drawback in this is the strong scent.  The scent wouldn&#x27;t be unpleasant if it were mild, but as it is, it&#x27;s overwhelming.</li>
    <li> Neutrogena Cool Dry Sport Sunscreen was very lightweight and absorbed quickly as advertised. It does have a slight sunscreen smell that I don&#x27;t love but it wasn&#x27;t overpowering. Most sunscreens leave a residue that gets all over everything but this did not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tested it during a hot day at the beach (in FL) and it held up well to heat, activity and water sports.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This will definitely be my go to sunscreen.</li>
    <li> This is a nice size bottle of sunscreen that stands on its head so it is easy to get the product out.  No tube to squeeze and no waste.  The lotion is soft and moisterizing and feels very nice on the skin.  It does indeed go on cool and dry.  It did not have a strong odor which is good for me since I have a sensitivity to smells.  I really couldn&#x27;t speak to the effectiveness of the sunscreen as we have not had warm enough or sunny enough weather to try that part out.</li>
    <li> Our family use much sunscreen during the sunny months.  This one is much better than the others.  It does not leave a sticky/oily residue after application.  It feels very light on the skin.  This is our new favorite sunscreen!</li>
    <li> Nice, smooth sunscreen. It has a pleasant feel that isn&#x27;t too greasy, and it goes on easily. It&#x27;s hard to quanitify how well it stays on (that is, if it really holds up to 80 minutes of sweaty activity), so I won&#x27;t comment on that. It has the quality feel of Neutrogena lotions, but it seems you also pay for that. The comparable Coppertone Sport lotion is cheaper per ounce (about $10.50 for 8 ounces, verses just under $10 for 5 ounces with this), so that is a factor. For those who have issues with the greasy feel of less-expensive sunscreens, this will be a very good option, and it seems to be of high quality. I&#x27;m looking forward to having it at the beach or during sporting events as we move into summer.</li>
    <li> Favorite sunscreen by far! I&#x27;m a really pale girl and have always struggled finding the right kind of skin protection, but I&#x27;ve found one at last. It really works well and doesn&#x27;t leave your skin feeling clogged or weighed down. It&#x27;s goes on and blends really well, none of that yucky white residue that just won&#x27;t go away. Also, if you sweat a bunch, no sweat! It seems to stay in place. I went from 60 degree weather in SF to 112 degree weather in Vegas for a vacay and I did not come home sunburned--- AND went horseback riding in the crazy sun heat for two hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TIP: when you get really sweaty and wear sunglasses, the sunglasses will cause the sunscreen to rub away. Be sure to apply more often on the nose area.</li>
    <li> I am a fair skinned person so I am very picky about my sunscreen. I was at the store buying sunscreen for my 10 day vacation to Maui and saw Neutrogena&#x27;s NEW CoolDry Sport Sunscreen Lotion Broad Spectrum SPF 30. I use a lot of sunscreen so I bought 6 bottles of it. The first day of my vacation I applied the product 4 times throughout the day. Well I might as well have not put anything on at all because I got fried to the point where my skin blistered in some places. I thought maybe I did something wrong but I used 30 spf Coppertone Oil Free on my face and my face did not burn at all. I switched to the Coppertone for the rest of my trip and did not burn again. Needless to say I have returned all of the bottles and will not be using Neutrogena&#x27;s sunscreen products again.</li>
    <li> Recently used this product in Punta Cana.  Midday sun was brutal but I had no difficulty with it using the Neutrogena Sport.  Applied it to face and body and had no problems.  Will rub in to a tansparent film unlike Zinc problems.  Had no problems with product burning my eyes when I sweat either!  Recommended!</li>
    <li> Very nice sunscreen - with the usual implied quality of Neutrogena.  I know people have mentioned the (slight) scent, but I opened up the bottle and sniffed right at the top and couldn&#x27;t smell anything.  It goes on smooth, absorbs quickly, and isn&#x27;t sticky or dry.  The sun protection certainly seemed to work - but I&#x27;m no dermatologist.  SPF 30 is enough for all but the sunniest beach days for me&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The packaging is a big bonus here - the bottle is actually bigger than I expected (in a good way).  5 oz is actually a decent amount of sunscreen - it&#x27;s about 6 inches by 2 inches by 1 inch.  I was expecting a little mini bottle but this will last a lot longer.  The shape of the bottle is also a big improvement over cylindrical bottles.  It is flat so it won&#x27;t bulk up your tote bag the same way, and it is made to stand on the spout net so all the lotion moves to the opening so you can get the most out of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A bit pricey but definitely good stuff.</li>
    <li> I hate applying sunscreen.  It&#x27;s messy and time consuming and you end up feeling a bit like a greased pig by the time you&#x27;re done.  Last year, we opted for the spray on sunscreen which is easy to apply but still leaves you feeling sticky and then washes off much too quickly.  So, I certainly was skeptical that this product could do all that it claims.  I have to admit that I was wrong.  It actually does go on very quickly and absorbs easily.  A little goes a long way.  It doesn&#x27;t make your skin feel icky or look shiny or white coated.  It doesn&#x27;t particularly feel cool but I guess if you are out in the sun it might be different.  We were outside all day at a charity fun run and didn&#x27;t get burned at all.  Also, an added bonus for me, there&#x27;s no bothersome fragrance to have to contend with.  Quite simply, it does what it claims.  Isn&#x27;t that enough of an endorsement these days?</li>
    <li> One of the lightest feeling sunscreens I have felt in lotion format.  It goes on easy, but does not feel filmy like some other ones I have tried.  No issues with reactions, etc. Definitely recommended.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in the sun a lot, and typically use SPF 8 / SPF 15. For my face on more intense / longer days I&#x27;ll use SPF 30, and generally stick to either Banana Boat or Neutrogena.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The selling points for this particular sunscreen are its water resistance (the standard 80 minutes) and the &#x27;Cool Dry&#x27; technology which supposedly lets you sweat through the sunscreen and keep cooler.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will say that, compared to heavier sunscreens (I&#x27;ve also got some Hawaiian Tropic 60 and some specialty brand zinc oxide sunblock), this stuff feels lighter and drier -- less oily -- once it&#x27;s been rubbed in and had time to dry. The fragrance is light and mildly floral / soapy, a nice clean scent, and the texture starts out like a moisturizing lotion but once rubbed in is light and pretty much not noticeable. Compared to my Banana Boat SPF 30, the difference is slight but I think I can tell that this feels slightly drier to the touch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The catch? You pay a little more. This is close to $2 / oz currently, while the Banana Boat is closer to $1.50 / oz. The proportions of sunscreen chemicals are a little different, too -- this Neutrogena has 3% Avobenzone, 8% Homosalate, 5% Octisalate, 4% Octocrylene, and 4% Oxybenzone. The Banana Boat has 1% / 10% / 5% / 0.8% and 4% of the same chemicals. Don&#x27;t ask me what the difference is, though...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BOTTOM LINE -- this stuff feels good, smells pleasant, and once it&#x27;s absorbed does indeed feel light and drier on the skin than some other sunscreens I&#x27;ve tried. I&#x27;ve used Neutrogena many times in the past and their sunscreen products are consistently dependable. This is no exception. 5 stars.</li>
    <li> I was slightly hesitant to try this sunscreen as it is not marked sensitive. My kids all have allergies to many different sunscreens so we typically stick with the neutrogena sensitive ones. However, this has worked perfectly. We are often by the pool watching my oldest at his swim practices during the late morning hours when the sun can be very damaging to my fair skinned girls. Both of my girls are blonde with porcelain complexions so sunscreen is a must. My middle child also has sensory issues so we can not use one that dries sticky or that is too thick and leaves a residue or has a smell. This was a little thick on application but once it dried there didn&#x27;t appear to be a residue or any stickiness that would bother the girls. There was also a very light scent but nothing overly tropical.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The protection offered by this was excellent as after a week of being out from 10-12 ish each day didn&#x27;t cause any sun burns and there wasn&#x27;t any irritation of the skin. It is quite hot and the cool part did seem to hold up to its&#x27; claims.</li>
    <li> Lotion SPF 30&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a very good sunscreen.  It stays on if you are sweating or get wet.  It is not greasy &amp; the fragrance is not too strong.  And most importantly, it does keep us from getting a sunburn.  You should reapply after swimming or sweating a lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a small bottle - 5 ounces.</li>
