      <li>I am looking forward to getting more colors very soon.</li>
      <li>Kind of evens out the color of the nail bed but looks clear when you are wearing it.  </li>
      <li>Years ago I used a similar Sally gel-like product and I loved it</li>
      <li>colour is also great if you are new to doing your own Gelish manicure at home because mistakes are less visible.</li>
      <li>Perfect for those that just want a nice clear coat or to pair with white for a french manicure look.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> It is a gel based nail polish, I applied as other colors- however was very disappointed, its a see through clear gel cover,  NO COLOR at all!!! I love the other two color I got, gossip girl and star burst by gelish and was hoping to buy one in a lighter shade but Simler sheer has no pink to it at all!!!! its just a clear cover.....</li>
    <li> The polish has a slight pink hue IN THE BOTTLE ONLY.  When you put it on, it definitely goes on CLEAR. I&#x27;m very dissapointed that I wasted money on this.  If I wanted clear polish I would just use what I already have, Top It Off. It&#x27;s clear and it&#x27;s something you already need if you use Gelish products. Don&#x27;t waste your money on this polish.  You&#x27;re better off spending the money on something else that will give you color.      I wish Gelish would come up with a better/more true display of their nail polish colors.</li>
    <li> Great color for French manicure!!</li>
    <li> There are times when I don&#x27;t want color.  This polish is the most natural I&#x27;ve found in the gelish line.</li>
    <li> This is so light pink and translucent.  You almost can not tell it is on.  Kind of evens out the color of the nail bed but looks clear when you are wearing it.  I wanted it to be pinker.  Depends on what you&#x27;re looking for.</li>
    <li> The color is kind of drab looking,  a slight yellowing dingey hue.</li>
    <li> Perfect those people who want a natural looking polish. Just a slight pink to this great color. I bought this for my mom because she doesnt really like using color for polish. Absolutely perfect!</li>
    <li> Not the pink like on picture.&lt;br /&gt;It is absolutely clear with just a little hint of pink. I use it for french on my toes so its ok...</li>
    <li> Like one of the reviewer said, its money wasted. The Foundation gel and Top It Off would have done the same purpose. What you see on the screen is not the same color when applied or even when you look at the color in the bottle. I could have used my money to buy a different color if I have known that this polish is colorless after all.</li>
    <li> I am a Nail Tech and have been for 15 years.  I was very pleased to finally have a product that will last.  I have tried other brands but like Gelish the best.  Be careful when buying colors though some of them as is the case with this appear very different in bottle than it does on an actual nail.  Simple Sheer is in fact a clear.  It is really only good if you want a break from color and are looking to only protect your nails. Your better off going to you tube and watching some of the videos where people posted videos of the colors they use so you can see it before buying.</li>
    <li> This product does what it says!  As other have noted, this last more than 2 weeks and is worth every dollar.  I am happy to know that someone thought of a way to bring more versatility to nail care.</li>
    <li> Bought this item but switched to OPI as Gelish seemed to not last very long.  It would peel quicker so I will not be buying any more Gelish brands.</li>
    <li> This color is great and goes on nice and clear perfect for french manicure.  I really love the gelish colors and suggest them for anyone looking for gel colors.</li>
    <li> I gave this 5 stars because of quality, but now that I know that you can sandwich regular polish between the layers or put another regular polish color on the top and remove that with regular acetone, I probably would have just got the basics along with the Simple Sheer. ---&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the last 2-3 years my nails have been extremely brittle, thin and could not grow them at all. I have been using Gelish for 3 weeks now and finally I have a French Manicure without destroying my nails with tips or acrylic. I refuse to pay the salon prices for nails that only going to make them worse once removed. Years ago I used a similar Sally gel-like product and I loved it but it was no longer available. So when I found out about Gelish I instantly bought the basics for French Manicure. - I bought The PH Bond, Foundation, three colors: Light Elegant and Simple Sheer, Sheek White and Top It Off. I really did not need the Light Elegant as I could easily sandwich another color of regular polish before I apply white for tips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just to compare; my nails with and without Gelish: I started with no nail growth at all, because I they constantly broke as they grew. With Gelish, I had no chip on my natural nails for the past 3 weeks. Once I removed Gelish and let my nails breathe for a day, I instantly broke two of my nails completely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;LAMP: I use a 9Watt UV lamp I had for years. It works perfectly, but it will cure slower. Instead of 30secs I cure each layer for 4 minutes. Once this lamp goes I will switch over to a 30 watt lamp. Right now it takes at least 1hr to get my nails done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SOAK OFF: Buff the surface then I use foil, cotton ball soaked with the Soak Off remover. I leave it on for 30 minutes (not 15 as recommended) just because my nails are so weak I do not want to rish the chance of hurting them. - After 30 mins I can easily and completely remove them with the tip of a nail file or a cuticule remover. My nails will look healthy and clean. DO NOT PRY OR TEAR IT. It will remove the top layer of your nail. - I do clean the cuticles and apply oil and cream to nourish the natural nails. Then let my nails breathe for a while before putting Gelish on again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PRICE: At the beauty store you buy a small bottle for almost the same price so these big bottles really worth it.&lt;br /&gt;Knowing what I now know about the Cleanser and the Soak off remover, I will probably not reorder refills. I will get 100% acetone for a cheaper price at stores it does not have to be brand name. It goes very fast. I used 1/3 already and had 3 manicures so far. I use regular oil free nail polish remover to clean off the tackiness from the Top it Off. It does not solve Gelish at all, which is great because if I decide to put a coat of different color regular polish on during the week I can do that, removed it with regular polish and go back to a French manicure. - While I did not try yet, I read you can sandwich regular polish in between layers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DURABILITY: They go about 1-2 weeks before they start to grow down and lift at the edges. However I think they were lifting for me because I applied a bit too much at the edges. It took a little while to get the hang of it. They may last 3 weeks with these but I do a lot of housework so they do go through a lot of wear and tear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TIPS:&lt;br /&gt;- Soak off: 30 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;- White tip. - Though technically you should not, I find that I need to remove tackiness from the layer on which I am putting the white tip of Sheek White on. For some reason applying on top of the tacky surface Gelish Sheek White will run and turn milky instead of solid white.&lt;br /&gt;- Less is better. Do not apply close to the sides and cuticles of your nail. If you do, you will not only have thick edges tuck to your skin but will have lifting on the top and sides sooner or later. The product will level a bit during curing.</li>
    <li> This is not a pale pink, its not a shimmery pink, it almost looks like the tiniest bit of pink stain in an otherwise totally clear polish.  If u are familiar with CND shellac \\&quot;Clearly Pink\\&quot;, I would say this is basically the same idea. If u are looking for a polish that looks like you are not wearing polish, this will likely fit the bill. This is actually exactly what I was looking for as I am a nursing student and we are not allowed to wear polish when we start clinicals. Bummer right?</li>
    <li> One of the dictionary definitions of the word \\&quot;sheer\\&quot; is \\&quot;unmixed with anything else.\\&quot; Based on that, I would expect the color to be clear, and it is. I love playing with polish colors, but I have extremely thin, weak nails that don&#x27;t hold polish at all. I use - and love - the Gelish system to keep my natural nails strong, and so that regular polishes will stay on longer. I wanted a totally clear product that works with the Gelish system, and Simpler Sheer is exactly that.    Gelish requires two coats of color between their Foundation and Top it Off products, so for those who don&#x27;t want color, this is the perfect solution. Tip: using one coat of this and one coat of \\&quot;Vegas Nights\\&quot; gives a gorgeous, sparkly nail.</li>
    <li> As others have said already.. it goes on clear. It is very much a waste of money since you can just buy the foundation and topper and use them without color. This was a very bad choice of color by Gelish. I will stick to their products because they still last and apply awesomely, however this color shouldn&#x27;t even be listed as color. I&#x27;m going to try \\&quot;Need a Tan\\&quot; and \\&quot;Taffeta\\&quot; instead.</li>
    <li> This is a nice, sheer color for Gelish nails.  You can use it when doing your French manicure, or for just a natural look.</li>
    <li> This product yellows badly. My nails looked awful.  Thanks goodness for the color I ordered in Taffeta! Now, that one&#x27;s a keeper!</li>
    <li> I purchased the light, a pack of colors, base and top coat.  I stopped trying to get this right.  It didn&#x27;t matter how much or how little I put on it didn&#x27;t last more than a couple of days.</li>
    <li> I love this color. If you want a natural looking French manicure this is the color to use. I put my base coat on,  two coats of sheek white on the nail tip  and go over with two coats of simpler sheer and then top coat. I found its lasts longer by putting the sheek white on first. I love how it looks and everyone asks me where I go to get them done.</li>
    <li> EXCELLENT.  Get a lot more for your money.  Sally sells bottles half the size for same amount of money.  Will always buy here</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this color for a year now as my go to French manicure color.</li>
    <li> This is the perfect clear Gelish product. I want my nails to look natural, but shiny and this product succeeded.    UPDATE:   I am frustrated with the quality of this product.  I loved the color--or lack of color really.  I thought it would be a perfect clear when I wanted the strength of gel nails without using color.  The problem I have been having is that the polish seems thinned out.  At first I thought it was my light that was causing the polish to run and not set properly, but I&#x27;m still having the same problems with a new light.  My other Gelish polishes stay put and cure quickly without smearing or running.  This one causes me problems every time I try and use it.  I can no longer recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I had gel nails put on at a nail salon and at first they used regular nail polish as a top coat.  It lasted only a few days before my nails started to look crappy.  I went back within three days and they said they got in a new polish called, \\&quot;Gelish\\&quot;.  It dried extremely fast and I didn&#x27;t have to worry about messing up my nails on the way out the door.  It lasted about 2 to 3 weeks with no touch-ups. They did use a UV light to set the polish, so I&#x27;m not sure if I need to get one or not.  I will throw-out all my other polish if this works as good for me at home as it did at the salon, and I&#x27;ll see if it works good without a UV light.</li>
    <li> Awesome price! Full sized bottle</li>
    <li> barely pink for the base on your French Manicure.  It looks VERY pink in the bottle but goes on nearly clear.  Just enough pink to mask imperfections in your nails!</li>
    <li> This has no color whatsover!!! I used 3 coats and it is still very clear!!</li>
    <li> I was disconcerted to find the Gelish Simple Sheer polish I received has a front label with what appears to be a black or dark color circle (color swatch) on it and not the pale pink color as depicted in the product photo. However, the label on the bottom of the bottle does say Simple Sheer and the polish within is a very light pink as other reviewers have described. The polish dried (LED dryer) in time stipulated on bottle directions and is wearing well so it appears to be the legitimate article. The vendor (Beauty Shine) explained that \\&quot;ever since we became an authorize seller of Gelish, all the bottles we had came with a dark circle.\\&quot; It might be better if they just change the product photo on Amazon to match what they sell to avoid further confusion. Otherwise the product is fine and Beauty Shine shipped it quickly.</li>
    <li> have never been able to have my nails grow due to splitting and breaking  and Hashimotos ... first I used it with uv-light and all, but do not like the polished look and it peeled of for me  ... want the natural look ... came up with way to get totally natural looking nails, stronger than a nail : put the gelish on, let it sit for a few minutes and the wipe off the excess with  toiletpaper and you get a perfect power layer ... I  have repeated the doing several times ... no peeling no soaking off, just  hard natural nails ... wohoo</li>
    <li> I completely agree with the previous reviews.  The color strip on the bottle is a vary faint pale pink, when in actuality it goes on clear after two coats. I did open the bottle at the store and paint a strip on a paper and it had a pink tint.  Not true.&lt;br /&gt;Also, dont wast ur time/money on buying any of the polishes from Sally&#x27;s.  They charge about $16(inc. tax) for a mini bottle.  When u can get a full size bottle with a wide variety of colors from Amazon with avg prices of $8-$12!  Plus the best online company with gelish colors ships out pretty fast!</li>
    <li> This was exactly the color I was hoping for. I used to gel solar nails done years ago and would only do the &#x27;pink&#x27; not the &#x27;white&#x27; part so that I could have very natural looking nails. This color reminds me of how beautiful my nails used to look back then, but now without the damage of solar nails!</li>
    <li> **This is CLEAR. It looks like there is only a clear gloss on my nails rather than the nude/sheer pink it appears as in the picture.**</li>
    <li> I wanted clear and this is as close as I could get.</li>
    <li> It really depends what you want to use this gel polish for. If you want colour, this is definitely NOT the polish for you. If you want to achieve a natural look, this polish is perfect!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very weak nails that split all the time and end up breaking. I tried all the \\&quot;special\\&quot; polishes and treatments that are meant to make the nails stronger but with no luck. Then I tried Gelish and it actually helps protect my nails so they don&#x27;t split. The reason I chose Simple Sheer is because it gives a very natural look. I can use Gelish to help protect my nails but don&#x27;t have to get an actual colour.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also noticed that if you put a few coats of the actual colour polishes they start to look thick and not pretty so you have to limit them to 2-3 coats. With Simple Sheer I tried 4 coats and it looked even better than only 2-3 and it also gave more strength to my nail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This colour is also great if you are new to doing your own Gelish manicure at home because mistakes are less visible. For example if you put it too close to the cuticle. It&#x27;s also easier to work with then dark colours as those require a good layering technique or the final result won&#x27;t be even.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Simple Sheer is almost clear with a slight pink tint to it. You can notice the pink mainly at a certain light, otherwise it&#x27;s clear. You can still see your natural nails through it so if you want to disguise those, I&#x27;d recommend using an actual colour or using Simple Sheer together with a white polish for French manicure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note for curing: I read a few Gelish reviews saying that if you cure Gelish polish for too long it will start peeling and you need to be super careful with Simple Sheer because it&#x27;s almost clear and hardly needs any curing with the LED light. Follow the instructions on the bottles. Also make sure you know what kind of light you&#x27;re using, LED needs only seconds while UV takes minutes.</li>
    <li> Not sure why simple sheer would suggest that it had color...anyways this is great for its purpose</li>
    <li> Good product but the color shown is no where near the actual color!!!  The actual color is more of a darker mauve see through pink...like a tint.  You know when you get white tip nails done and they put that pink tinted nail polish on...kinda like that but darker.</li>
    <li> I was expecting a light pink color but this one is just simply clear stuff. If you are looking for a cear nail polish you can get this one.</li>
    <li> I have only one complaint about this product...I didn&#x27;t invent it. I love this stuff. If you haven&#x27;t tried gel polish then you dont know what you are missing. Perfect manicure and stays without chipping and it&#x27;s high gloss for weeks and I am usually a pretty busy gal and my hands see a lot of action. The best!!</li>
    <li> In my opinion, there is a &#x27;slight&#x27; tint to the color.  Enough so, that it makes it the perfect &#x27;color&#x27; for natural looking french manicures and/or pedicures.</li>
    <li> I love this gel polish!  It wears without ANY chips for at least two weeks.  You will see grow out before any deterioration of the finish and edges.  Harmony has lots of colors, but this one is very, very sheer.  That&#x27;s why I only gave it 4 stars. It looks like it has a rosy tint to it in the bottle, but once it is on your nails, it doesn&#x27;t appear to impart any color at all.  I wont buy this color again, because it will last forever.  But I will get many more colors.  Be sure to purchase the foundation gel and top it off to go with your colors for a &#x27;can&#x27;t be beat manicure&#x27;.  Also works so very very well on toes!</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong - I absolutely love wearing the colors! But sometimes I just want the restfulness of clear polish. And sometimes I can&#x27;t make up my mind! You can&#x27;t go wrong with clear, it&#x27;s classic.</li>
    <li> A must have if you use Gelish! Love the size of this polish and the color is perfect for french manicure.</li>
    <li> This is almost clear, just has a touch of color, Works well for French tip</li>
    <li> It is definitely sheer :) if you want a more pinky looking manicure then this is the wrong pink. This color is very natural looking. Love it :)</li>
    <li> Excellent polish and ease of use. The color was perfect and was easy to put on. The lamp dried the gel and I Felt like a pro.</li>
    <li> Excelent product and delivery on time</li>
    <li> Great product arrived quickly! This color works very well for french manicures. I strongly recommend it. But it is light so if you prefer a little more darker then do not buy.</li>
    <li> haven&#x27; t tried it on my nails , but the color in the bottle does not look sheer. It is an odd plank clear.</li>
    <li> Perfect for those that just want a nice clear coat or to pair with white for a french manicure look.</li>
    <li> I knew what I was buying when I ordered this. It is almost completely clear, but I love it for my French manicure.</li>
    <li> Colour is perfect - clear and fresh looking without any pink or shimmer, great for a manicured everyday look. Great quick delivery.</li>
    <li> Price was good. Color is sheer not pink but that is what I wanted. Would give a better review but it took the company three weeks to deliver my polish but they did give me 20% back for the trouble. Other then that good product</li>
    <li> Love this gel nail polish.  It really does last as long as Gelish says it will.  I&#x27;ve had my current polish on for 2 weeks without a single chip or loss of shine!  And I&#x27;m not careful with it either.  I do all kinds of gardening work and house remodeling projects, so there are plenty of chances to mess it up.  The best thing about this type of polish is it adds thickness and strength to your nails.   I have very weak nails and I haven&#x27;t had a single one break or tear while I&#x27;ve had this polish on.  When you apply the polish, since it&#x27;s a thick gel, it settles out any brush strokes before it cures so you get a smooth finish.  There are a couple of things to be careful of when applying.  Make sure to really clean the nail up near the cuticle.  I didn&#x27;t the first manicure I did on myself and the polish didn&#x27;t stick as well and started peeling at the top edge.  I use a q-tip and really scrub near the cuticle with the cleaning solution, and that seems to do the trick.  The other thing to be mindful of is to be careful when applying near the cuticles.  It will wick up under the skin, and as it grows out you&#x27;ll have a huge ridge.  If you try to stay a little ways away from the base of the nail it won&#x27;t be a problem.  Finally, as you&#x27;re working on your nails, just ignore how awful the cuticles look.  The cleaning solution drys them out, but the nourish oil fixes it all up at the end.  Read the directions on the Gelish website.  You will require an LED or UV curing light.  I think I saw someone else complain that the polish never dried on this product or one of the other Gelish polishes I was looking at on Amazon.  Clearly that person didn&#x27;t understand that this type of polish requires a light to cure and the cleaning solution at the end.</li>
    <li> I bought it to use it with my French.  I like putting a base natural color on the nail. It didn&#x27;t add any color. It&#x27;s 100% a clear color.</li>
    <li> Ok, so I thought I&#x27;d get a color similar to the photo that&#x27;s displayed...NO. haha It really is a &amp;#34;clear coat&amp;#34;, although I&#x27;m glad I got it. ^_^</li>
    <li> I have VERY weak and splitting nails and need gel polish to grow them at all.  This is the closest to clear that is made.  I need 4 coats plus foundation coat and you can see a pink tint, but still looks almost natural.</li>
    <li> Just what i was looking for, a gel polish without color.  I recommend it as long as you realize it is virtually a clear polish.</li>
    <li> Hey girls, I read all of these reviews like you are now and most said that the Simple Sheer is clear and you cannot even tell that there is a hint of pink to it...well, I posted a picture of my nails after I did a french manicure with this so you can judge for yourself :) the caption is (Foundation (1), Snow Bunny (2), Simple Sheer (2), Top It Off (1). (# of coats)).  I like it because I can put this over the white tips and they don&#x27;t look discolored and the finished product does not have a ridge at the smile line.  I hope this helps!! [[ASIN:B003VMVBVG Harmony Gelish UV Soak Off Gel Polish #324 Simple Sheer]]</li>
    <li> Great Transaction, Harmony Gelish Gel Polish is a great Product. I am looking forward to getting more colors very soon. I love the fact that it makes your nails look great for two weeks. Thank You</li>
    <li> I have not had any issues with this product it goes on easy and works well. Came in one day.</li>
    <li> This is very nice if your doing a french manicure. I love Gelish products. Much cheaper through Amazon then say Sally&#x27;s. Also a way bigger bottle for less.</li>
    <li> Not terrible I guess, but kind of a waste. The quality of Gelish is there but...If you want clear pink that actually has color, my recommendation is Glam and Glits Ink gel polish. The name of the color is &amp;#34;French&amp;#34;. It&#x27;s completely clear, but the color is a saturated pink. Beautiful, great quality and there&#x27;s a great seller (missionbeauty) on ebay who has Ink cheap. Totally impressed with Ink gel polish, it&#x27;s my new favorite line!!</li>
    <li> Great color for the pink/pale/natural section of a french tip manicure.  Great quality polish.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a base color for french mani&#x27;s and this is it! I love the color! The order came within the time it said and it wasn&#x27;t broken or old looking. Great company would purchase again!</li>
    <li> I would recommend this to anyone doing their own nails.  However, be careful with the colors you buy....they don&#x27;t always match the picture on the websites.  In fact, they don&#x27;t always look like the color showing through the window when you actually put it on your nails.</li>
    <li> Its a great sheer pink, multiple layers make it darker but I love it for French manicures or to leave nails natural</li>
    <li> works for every thing love it fastshipping and handled with care looks seethrough and shows your own true natural nail look just shinier.</li>
    <li> This polish is perfect when you want a break from color. I wanted the support from the Gelish products, but did not want color on my nails.  This polish was perfect for that purpose. Although it looks pink in the bottle, when applied it only added a glossy finish to my nails. I&#x27;ll use this when I&#x27;m ready to try my hand at a French Manicure.</li>
    <li> How I wish these things would really work.  Oh well, back to the salon.</li>
    <li> I like this. Other customers should note that this color is really just a clear gel polish tinged with pink. This is well suited for french manicure designs or things of the like. I knew this in advanced, and that is what I bought it for, so I&#x27;m pleased with this purchase.</li>
    <li> I love this color. It doesn&#x27;t have much of a color but it is perfect for doing french manicures. It is not too pink or too clear. I did one coat after I painted my white tips and it was perfect. I still used a top coat over it to give it a perfect shine. Definitely recommend this color! I use this with Sheek White and they are the perfect combo!</li>
    <li> It is very clear.  It is almost like the top coat and doesn&#x27;t even add a tint of color to my nail.  Good for when I dont want to show my nail polish but want strong nails.</li>
    <li> It is a nice hue of pink but still clear.  I don&#x27; t like colors but this makes me feel pretty</li>
    <li> its realy sheer, more than I expected</li>
    <li> Much larger size than I had been receiving at Sally&#x27;s Beauty Supply so pretty stoked :D same price as the minis with the same quality.</li>
    <li> The quality is fine, however it wasn&#x27;t the color I expected.  Though, I can see that happening when you purchase polish online, it&#x27;s hard to tell.  It&#x27;s very very very clear.  It may have a slight pink tint to it, though it&#x27;s very slight.  Still looks nice and clean, it just looks like you have clear polish on.</li>
    <li> Simple sheer color is great. I am getting pretty good at doing my nails myself. It took a couple tries.</li>
