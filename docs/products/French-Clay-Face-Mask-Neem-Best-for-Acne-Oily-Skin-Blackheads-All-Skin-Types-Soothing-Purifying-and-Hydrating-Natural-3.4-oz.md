      <li>Switching to the use of more Neem based products.</li>
      <li>Love this mask..expecially because of the &amp;#34;neem &amp;#34;which</li>

      <li>i love this product and the packaging.  </li>
      <li>i will buy more.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s upsetting because it wasn&#x27;t cheap!  </li>
      <li>My face is nice and clean.  </li>
      <li>I used to use the Sensaria clay mask and was trying to find a suitable replacement when it stopped being available.  </li>
      <li>NEEM is a powerful ingredient in the battle against acne!!</li>
      <li>but i guess its nice and natural, good price</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not a miracle though, but who has problems with hyperpigmentation any single improvement is awesome!</li>
      <li>I recently heard about Neem and thought I would give it a try since the reviews on this product were very good.  </li>
      <li>neem is a little grainy and needs more clay, but it was ok, the best I ever received was from a health food store or ingestion, go figure.</li>
      <li>I bought it for my daughter while it has made her face feel more smooth</li>
      <li>After using this my face is much more smooth</li>
      <li>Neem is a great, natural product for the skin.</li>
      <li>Love how it took the shine away and felt clean.</li>
      <li>For me my face got fine bumps</li>
      <li>and this works fine for me</li>
      <li>Not the greatest smelling mask, but washes off well once it has dried.  </li>
      <li>This definitely fit the bill.</li>
      <li>Once I took the mask off, I felt nice tightness across my cheeks, yet didn&#x27;t really do much for the bumps.</li>
      <li>Great for maybe one facial a month depending on your skin type.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m pimple free.  </li>
      <li>But it feels so good and really does reduce pore size and gives your skin a fresh start.</li>
      <li>Was not drying to the skin but definitely leaves a great clean look.</li>
      <li>love how my face feels after washing it off, fresh and clean.</li>
      <li>It make my face smooth and clean.</li>
      <li>Worth it each peny!</li>
      <li>Ordering from JustNeem was a very positive experience!</li>
      <li>Clean feeling no film on teeth.</li>
      <li>I love this mask so much, it&#x27;s so amazing how you can feel it sucking all the toxins out of your skin, after waking up the next day</li>
      <li>The first time I used it I put to much on, but after adjusting to a smaller amount it works wonderfully.</li>
      <li>The response I got was that it was weighed to an amount, but it was not even 1/2 full.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used it 3 times and my daughter has used it 2 times and it is still really full.  </li>
      <li>It isn&#x27;t a miracle product or anything like that, but it does provide a good home-spa facial option.</li>
      <li>I just need to remember to use it a couple times a week in order to get the full benefits.  </li>
      <li>It has a fresh, clean smell.</li>
      <li>I wil be able able to giver a better rating in a few weeks.</li>
      <li>It is a little fragrant but my skin looked great afterwards.</li>
      <li>he whole family enjoy this mask,really cleans our pores</li>
      <li>and that&#x27;s coming from someone who has the most sensitive skin.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> The first time I used the mask I could tell it was differant, My skin felt clearer and smoother, I look forward to seeing improvements with continued use.</li>
    <li> This product is awesome! I&#x27;ve been using it for a few months and absolutely love it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve ordered this product three times and it has really helped my skin. I have acne (not severe, but a couple of blemishes at least everyday day) and I&#x27;ve tried A LOT of products (mostly topical). I saw this product on Dr. Oz and so far it really has helped keep my acne in-check. It doesn&#x27;t do anything to heal, but I believe it has helped prevent. Also, I use the product everyday - the women featured on Dr. Oz said it was safe to use everyday on oily skin. Also, the only reason I&#x27;m giving this product 4 stars is because the shipment on my second order was a bit delayed.</li>
    <li> Have tried neem tooth paste ...loved ot. Clean feeling no film on teeth. The mask has been a great product to use. Using twice a week. Skin looks and feels good. Received compliments. Recommend. Hard to find in health stores.</li>
    <li> neem is a little grainy and needs more clay, but it was ok, the best I ever received was from a health food store or ingestion, go figure.</li>
    <li> only have to use it once a week and does a wonderful job. love it i will buy more. it is great!!</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin, so I am always a little afraid to use anything other than Dove on my face. This stuff is the real deal if you want beautiful skin. If you don&#x27;t believe me then give it a try...you won&#x27;t regret it!</li>
    <li> First time I used this I noticed a big difference in my skin!! My skin is EXTREMELY sensitive and it did not break it out or anything. Really makes my skin feel great!!!!</li>
    <li> I really like this product.  I have very sensitive skin, so I started out slow when using it.  I pretty much did a patch test on my neck first.  After I saw that it did not break me out in any way I started using it all over my face once a week.  I have noticed that my skin looks brighter and it has helped with my acne.  I will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> Amazing mask! This is the only mask I have ever used that did not make my face red after using. Neem is a great, natural product for the skin.</li>
    <li> I am enjoying product. It arrived on time and in good condition. Thanks so much!! I am looking forward to using more Neem products in the future.</li>
    <li> This was an okay mask but not really wild about it.  I did notice that it was reasonbably but since &amp;#34;Dr. Oz&amp;#34; has endorsed it, the price has tripled.  Disappointed.</li>
    <li> I really like the way my face looks after using this product.  My skin is tighter and has fewer problems.</li>
    <li> I use the Neem Clay Face Mask about once a week. It has a fresh, clean smell. It tightens pores and leaves my face feeling soft and smooth. I tried it on a whim since Dr. Oz&#x27;s presentation reminded me of the clay face mask my mother and grandmother used so many years ago.</li>
    <li> Love how it took the shine away and felt clean. Was not drying to the skin but definitely leaves a great clean look.</li>
    <li> I ordered this with high expectations, but when it arrived, the jar was put inside a plastic ziplock bag.  Well, guess what, it was a good thing because it leaked all inside the bag.  I haven&#x27;t even used it yet because I don&#x27;t know if the product has been compromised by the leakage.  It&#x27;s upsetting because it wasn&#x27;t cheap!  I really don&#x27;t know if it is &amp;#34;okay&amp;#34;, but in all fairness have to say &amp;#34;okay&amp;#34; because I haven&#x27;t tried it.</li>
    <li> This mask is gentle and has a cooling feel when you use it. It has a healing feeling to your skin.i love it.</li>
    <li> This stuff works really well.  It causing a tingling sensation once it&#x27;s on your face and it deep cleans really well.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive, oily skin that has really tiny bumps all over the face. Though it is not noticeable by sight, but definitely can feel it when touched.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, when I used this mask, my skin first started off with a slight burning sensation, which later gave a cooling sensation. Once I took the mask off, I felt nice tightness across my cheeks, yet didn&#x27;t really do much for the bumps. My skin did not react negatively, but didn&#x27;t really see any positive effects either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me, it is just a mask that takes off dead cells and tightens skin.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical at first but after the 3rd use it change my outlook about this product. It controlled my acne and skin redness plus it has a cooling effect once you applied it all over your face. I would recommend this product. It&#x27;s worth a shot.</li>
    <li> I really like this product, will buy again I have sensitive skin and this works fine for me I use about 1 time a week</li>
    <li> I would never have known about this if I hadn&#x27;t seen it on the Dr O show, which didn&#x27;t even come close to hailing the benefits of this facial mask.</li>
    <li> I have Rosacea and I saw this recommended to help soothe the condition.  It certainly did that and also helped soften up the dried patches of skin that came from using the prescription MetroGel that the dermatologist recommended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does have a unique smell - very like tea tree oil and much stronger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This clay mask has what appears to be bits of leaf in it which can help exfoliate but are not at all too abrasive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I liked all the anti-bacterial and other natural properties without all the unpronounceable chemicals that come with the usual drug store facial products.</li>
    <li> i love this product and the packaging.  the quality is excellent, and i will get many hours of use from it</li>
    <li> still using it though. too early to tell the effect, but i guess its nice and natural, good price though</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing, and the smell is awesome. Every time I use it I can see a change in my pores. It also makes me feel so relaxed when I have it on my face.</li>
    <li> This is one of my favorite products, when I clean my face and use this mask let sit for 2-3 mnts my face feels tight and clear it works for me.&lt;br /&gt;I have introduced my African American friends to this and they love it must try!</li>
    <li> The clay mask leaves me looking like a zombie--perfect for scaring little kids and keeping men away.  But it feels so good and really does reduce pore size and gives your skin a fresh start. Great girlfriend gift.</li>
    <li> Definitely has reduce pores on my nose.  Also has reduced the amount of redness and unevenness of my facial skin.&lt;br /&gt;Will definitely purchase more of this product.</li>
    <li> I only used the face mask about 3 times and can already see and feel the positive differences to my face skin.</li>
    <li> Not the greatest smelling mask, but washes off well once it has dried.  Seemed to help my teenage son&#x27;s blackheads and calmed his skin down from breakouts.  Switching to the use of more Neem based products.</li>
    <li> I gave this to my 14 year old grand daughter. She has been using it and her face looks much better.</li>
    <li> I recently heard about Neem and thought I would give it a try since the reviews on this product were very good.  I agree!  This is an excellent product.  The mask is somewhat tingly, but that let&#x27;s you know it&#x27;s working.  After removal, my skin is soft and much brighter.  This will last me a LONG LONG time.  I&#x27;ve used it 3 times and my daughter has used it 2 times and it is still really full.  5+ star product!  Arrived quickly and worth every single cent!</li>
    <li> I have used this facial mask once a week.  It isn&#x27;t a miracle product or anything like that, but it does provide a good home-spa facial option.</li>
    <li> I used to use the Sensaria clay mask and was trying to find a suitable replacement when it stopped being available.  After some research, i settled on this one and have to say i do like it.  Its not as effective as reducing blemish breakouts as Sensaria was, but this one is easy to put on, leaves a tingling as you wear it for 10-15 minutes.  I just need to remember to use it a couple times a week in order to get the full benefits.  I&#x27;m very particular about the stuff I put on my face and want as natural as possible.  This definitely fit the bill.</li>
    <li> very unhappy that it was not filled.  The response I got was that it was weighed to an amount, but it was not even 1/2 full.  Feel got jipped</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m jumping on the organic product band wagon and this Neem mask is an excellent addition to my skincare routine. I have hormonal cystic acne due to menopause 😕 and in the past have tried harsh prescription and OTC medications which only made my skin angry, red and dry. Neem has healing and anti-inflammatory properties that my skin desperately needed . This product does the trick.  It&#x27;s not an overnight miracle cure but it does consistently heal and soothe my acne prone skin. The mask has a nice cooling effect and does not cause dryness or irritation. When I do have an acne flare-up  I apply the mask up to 3 times daily with no adverse effects. Some reviewers comment on the scent being horrible. In my opinion it&#x27;s not intolerable,  I rather like it! I also use the Vicco turmeric cream at night which also has healing and skin brightening properties, Oz organic facial cleanser which I use with my Clarisonic cleansing brush and Poppy Austin organic rose water as a toner.  When it comes to healthy skin,  slow and steady wins the race!</li>
    <li> I love the Neem Clay Face Mask, even though Dr. Oz does not like his name associated with products.  I still bought it and I love it.  Not wild about the odor, but I love the mask.</li>
    <li> So, I saw this product on the Dr. Oz show where it was recommended for daily use for my skin type.  I immediately went to Whole Foods to purchase it but was disappointed to find that they don&#x27;t carry it in Florida.  Ordering from JustNeem was a very positive experience! My order shopped immediately and arrived in a couple of days. I began using the product the very next day and saw immediate results in the texture of my skin. I use it daily on my combination black-head prone skin and it feels and looks wonderful. I apply it in the morning before I have my tea and its dry before I take my shower.  It deep cleanses the skin without drying as mud packs tend to do.  Try it, you won&#x27;t be sorry!</li>
    <li> This mask really works! It tingles a bit when you put it on, but in my opinion it&#x27;s the product doing the job. It&#x27;s a cooling effect only. I was very skeptical about this mask because I have a dry, very sensitive and hyperpigmented skin (melasma) and I&#x27;ve been trying many product without successes. I decide to give it a try and I loved the effect. My skin after 15 min with this mask on looked smooth and soft...and more important...lighter! It&#x27;s not a miracle though, but who has problems with hyperpigmentation any single improvement is awesome! Definitely I&#x27;ll continue using this mask at least twice a week to keep the effect. Worth it each peny!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff while it cleans deep into my pours, it&#x27;s also soothing to my skin.</li>
    <li> I tried this mask and hated the smell. I heard this is a very good product but I just cannot tolerate the smell.</li>
    <li> My go-to mask every other day, leaves my skin soft and clear! then I apply my Argan oil from Poppy Austin, great combo!</li>
    <li> Since I purchased this, I&#x27;ve used it approximately twice a week for the last two months. I like the way my skin feels after I use it as it is soft and smooth.  I do wish it would help with my skins pigmentation but I don&#x27;t believe that is one of issues that the information says it corrects.  I also use it on my neck and chest so it will not last as long for me as it would if I just used it on my face. Overall I&#x27;m badly with the results.</li>
    <li> WORTH THE PRICE AND GOOD PRODUCT!</li>
    <li> You can feel it working right away, use every week and you will see improvements! I especially like how it tightens my pores, at 44 years of age it&#x27;s perfect for my skin!</li>
    <li> This is amazing stuff, I never want to be with out it.  My daughter and I share, I want one for my own!</li>
    <li> If you liked the now-discontinued Bath and Bodyworks Neem facial masque, then you will appreciate the exquisite quality of this masque. And, since the company is celebrating it&#x27;s 8th birthday, they included two FULL SIZE gifts of Neem essential oil and Neem lip balm in my order! 5 star quality masque and excellent gifts--can&#x27;t ask for more than that.</li>
    <li> Works great on skin breakouts!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff.  When you put it on it tingles a tad but it does do the trick.  After using this twice a week, I&#x27;ve noticed a change in my complexion.  My pores are a lot smaller and also my fine lines near my eyes are diminishing.  I highly recommend this face mask.</li>
    <li> I like the way the product consistancy and when applying it. You do have to be careful what other topical products you use with the Neem Clay mask it may cause a reaction. I will continue to use it cleans well, the scent does not bother me.</li>
    <li> Cool, invigorating and easy to apply, it does dry differently than just plain french clay mask, but actually superior with the whipped ingredients that smooth easily over your face</li>
    <li> Really liked the mask. I have very sensitive skin. It didnt dry it out. It is a little fragrant but my skin looked great afterwards.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m on my 3rd jar.  This mask is great for my face and I can tell the difference after first use.  A friend of mine complimented me on my face skin, and she wanted a jar and loves it too.</li>
    <li> This product really deep cleans my skin. It does not dry out my skin. The first time I used it I put to much on, but after adjusting to a smaller amount it works wonderfully.</li>
    <li> It cools the skin and leaves my face looking clean and clear.  I have rosacea, so this calms my complexion.</li>
    <li> My wife found that this product worked very well for her skin type.I hope you continue to have this product in stock</li>
    <li> love how my face feels after washing it off, fresh and clean. its only been a few days, but I definitely like it</li>
    <li> Have used a couple of times for a mask, works great but don&#x27;t use more than once a week . For me my face got fine bumps but when I count back the use. It did the job. Great for maybe one facial a month depending on your skin type.</li>
    <li> My daughter has acne.  None of the doctors helped, nothing over the counter helps.  I heard about this from Dr. Oz.  Ordered her a jar last year for Christmas.  Used a directed, she was just scraping the bottom of the jar this December and asked for another.  She says this has helped her complexion more than anything else.  She loves the way her skin feels after use too.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product. I have never had such soft skin as I do now. I get a lot of compliments that my skin  looks and feel much smoother.</li>
    <li> Very good product for smoothing out wrinkles and roughness on the neck. I like it!</li>
    <li> It does have bit of a sting to it when you first put it on, not sure if that&#x27;s suppose to be a cooling effect or not. But it&#x27;s nothing that is intolerable.</li>
    <li> If you are like me - oily skin, frequent breakouts, acne scars, uneven skin tone - then this product is one to try.  It recommends to use it 1-2 times a week but when I am suffering from a breakout I use it every other day.  While it&#x27;s a clay mask, which evens skin tone, absorbs oil, and soothes acne, it goes one step further in hydrating the skin at the same time - no peeling, no agitation to the skin and that&#x27;s coming from someone who has the most sensitive skin.  Wonderful product if you need to detox your face of impurities and so affordable because this small tub will last you awhile.  A little bit goes a LONG way.  NEEM is a powerful ingredient in the battle against acne!!</li>
    <li> I love this mask. It make my face smooth and clean. I am on my second jar and will buy more</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin and this is the only mask I have found that does not make my skin red or breakout. I have noticed smoother, brighter skin within just a few uses. I also like that when I purchase this product, it is going to a good cause- helping provide jobs in Africa.</li>
    <li> I borrowed this from my wife and it helped clear my face after a few uses. Love that it&#x27;s all natural and Fair Trade too!!  Great stuff!</li>
    <li> After using this my face is much more smooth and I notice that any acne that was thinking of coming up immediately disappears!</li>
    <li> Has really helped my face.</li>
    <li> I used my Neem facial mask as soon as I recieved it, and I could feel it working as soon as I put it on, I&#x27;ll use it twice a week and already, just having used it twice my face has cleared up and I&#x27;m pimple free.  I&#x27;ll keep this on hand forever!!</li>
    <li> This is the first product that I have been able to use and not have my sensitive skin break out.  I will make this a regular part of my skin care program</li>
    <li> Love this mask..expecially because of the &amp;#34;neem &amp;#34;which I have found to be very healing for  my sensitive skin issues.</li>
    <li> I use this on rough sun spots on my chest, arms and shoulders, plus on my face several times a week. I&#x27;ve noticed smoother softer skin. More even skin tones. I will be ordering more!</li>
    <li> My skin is already dry and this just made it more dry.  I stopped using it after the second time.</li>
    <li> All it does is tingle. It doesn&#x27;t make my skin any healthier. It doesn&#x27;t dry out bumps or pimples. It doesn&#x27;t even skin tone. It does nothing their is no difference after taking it off except it has dried my skin out some or it wasted my time. The Cheaper neem mask by Himalaya has way more benefits and it has instant results and that product is only $6 while this product is over $30 including shipping charge. Not pleased whatsoever and I am returning it as soon as I possibly can. What a waste of money. I recommend the cheaper Neem mask by Himalaya.</li>
    <li> Have used it only twice. like the pleasant smell, the way the skin feels when it is removed and it is gentle/</li>
    <li> This mask is wonderful.  My face is nice and clean.  It works just like it says it works.  I will use this product again.</li>
    <li> T he whole family enjoy this mask,really cleans our pores</li>
    <li> I bought it for my daughter while it has made her face feel more smooth it has not helped with the acne problem.</li>
    <li> I love this mask so much, it&#x27;s so amazing how you can feel it sucking all the toxins out of your skin, after waking up the next day it gives your face a nice glow, but be sure to moisturizer after using.</li>
    <li> the smell is nauseating</li>
    <li> While I try to avoid getting drawn in by talk-show sales, this product sounded like something I was willing to try.  I use it a couple of times a week and am impressed by the results.</li>
    <li> Saw this on TV and wanted to try a clay mask. I&#x27;ve only tried it twice and it is most refreshing.</li>
    <li> Reecived last week only used once it feels soothing but I can&#x27;t give an honest rating at this time I wil be able able to giver a better rating in a few weeks.</li>
