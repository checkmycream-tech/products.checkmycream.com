    <li> My daughter loves loves that perfume and I might have to get more later on.</li>
    <li> I love this fragrence....The only problem with it is that it doesn&#x27;t last as long as I would like...It is very light and flowery....</li>
    <li> A friend got this for me on my bday after I whined about how much i wanted it. I actually bought a similar perfume before which smelled very similar to this one so I remembered the smell too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My friend who usually dislikes versace perfume complimented me and asked me what I was wearing. The scent actually lingers and stays for quite awhile! :D This bottle&#x27;s going to last me for awhile and the bottle&#x27;s lovely too.</li>
    <li> Versace Bright Crystal is such a sophisticated scent.  I&#x27;ve worn this fragrance since late-2010 and, although I prefer wearing other designer Eau de Parfums,Versace&#x27;s Eau de Toilette Bright Crystal has a perfect strength that lasts for hours.</li>
    <li> I am usually a one perfume kind of person. Once i have one I dont change but when i smelled the alluringly light fragrance i could not help myself from purchasing it. It came without delay, faster then the sender claimed. It lasts a very long time and the bottle draws the eye. Not to mention that i have received many compliments ;].</li>
    <li> To receive the goods, like, use is also very good, everyone in the family is like, after opportunity will buy, thank you.</li>
    <li> I like the scent well enough.  It smells like something I&#x27;ve had before.  It&#x27;s a younger smelling perfume and fruity floral to me.</li>
    <li> I so love my New Perfume!  I get headache&#x27;s with strong scented perfumes, but I was recommended to purchase Versace Bright Crystal and I am in love!!!  It is light and long lasting.</li>
    <li> Looked up this perfume to see how to tell if it was the real thing or fake and turns out, it&#x27;s fake. I could tell without even opening the packaging. The real thing says e 30ml vs. 30ml e (the one on the packaging). Also, the font is thinner and the ridges on the top of the box are supposed to be indented, to make craters, vs. in the fake, they are elevated. It smells totally alcoholly and the scent doesn&#x27;t last at all. Total rip off. I thought I would take the chance to save $10 (the sell the same thing at Nordstrom Rack for $40) but it&#x27;s not worth it. And I can&#x27;t return it because it&#x27;s a flammable substance... However, Amazon being the awesome customer servers that they are, refunded me in full.</li>
    <li> This fragrance is lovely on my best friend, so I wanted to try it and was happy to find it on Amazon at a lower price than offered in large retail stores. However, the fragrance vanishes in about 10 minutes after applying the spray.  It seems to be diluted or a different balance than that from retail stores.  This seems to be a case of \\&quot;you get what you pay for.\\&quot;  Very disappointing.</li>
    <li> Very nice scent, It reminds me of what an elegant lady would wear, beautiful and light. Love it and the bottle is so cute and the top will fit on a larger bottle if I want to get a sample bottle to save money</li>

    <li> Sparkling yet soft, light and definite, delicate and fresh.&lt;br /&gt;the right amount, the right price, the right bottle.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m pleased.</li>
    <li> Very clean, crisp smell. I love it! Double checked the box, pipe, and bottle for authenticity since I know some sellers will sell counterfeits. Everything check out great. Thanks!</li>
    <li> Great price, decent package and received the product in a moderate time manner...not too bad!&lt;br /&gt;Quality of the product is good, but the fragrance doesn&#x27;t seem to last as long as I expected.

    <li> This is okay. It smells good but doesn&#x27;t last as long or smell as noticeable as if you were to buy it in say, Ulta, or something. Still pretty good size.</li>
    <li> I had received a sample of this fragrance and loved it.  This is a fresh, soft fragrance perfect for every day or for a special occasion.  I&#x27;m definitely a fan!</li>
    <li> Love the Clean, Fresh Floral Scent. I went 1 year without it and no other fragrance compared to Versace Bright Crystal.</li>
    <li> It got to me fast and it was a great pice, also it smells great!</li>
