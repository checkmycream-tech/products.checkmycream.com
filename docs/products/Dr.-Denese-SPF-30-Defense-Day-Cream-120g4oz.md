<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This product is a combination of sunscreen and a tinted moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;It does not feel heavy on the skin and yes, I have suggested it to others.</li>
    <li> Love Dr. Denese products</li>
    <li> This cream is so thick that you either have to use a ton of it or cut it with another lotion unless you use serum under it!  The good news is that it replaces my foundation. I use serum (which helps get this thick stuff to spread!) then immediately apply the day cream then just put loose powder over it and it looks great and glowey!  It is definitely tinted and has a good sunscreen. I will use up this 4oz bottle but doubt I will reorder. I just prefer a more spreadable lotion</li>
    <li> I really like this product.  It does what it claims.  I love the fact the it contains anti aging ingredients and it protects the skin from negative environment.  The price is incredible compare to qvc.</li>
    <li> I was reluctant to purchase but so glad I did.  Now I finally wear sun screen every day for 1st time in my 62 years of flee!  Plus, it makes my skin look great.</li>
    <li> Great sun protection without the burning eyes from other sunblock products. Everything else I&#x27;ve tried gets in my eyes and mouth. This is made with zinc instead.</li>
    <li> This is my six tube of this product. I love it, many days this is the only thing I put on my face, the tint acts as my make up while the SPF protects my skin.</li>
    <li> My favorite moisture of all time.  Great sunscreen coverage and goes on nicely with a touch of foundation.  Love it</li>
    <li> This is the best foundation with sunscreen I have found.  I am middle aged and it makes my skin look soft and natural with good coverage.  It does not leave your skin shiny or greasy.  I can not live without this product.  This four ounce tube lasts for at least six months for me and well worth the price.</li>
    <li> This is a tinted moisturizer/sun screen which allows your skin to breath, and look glowing.&lt;br /&gt;I have stopped using regular foundations as, compared to this, they feel so heavy and the&lt;br /&gt;color is never right.  This blends with your skins natural tone which allows you to look like&lt;br /&gt;you&#x27;re wearing nothing at all.</li>
    <li> Love this for my foundation.  Goes on smoothly and give great coverage plus sun protection. Love Love Love it.  Thanks</li>
    <li> i&#x27;ve been using Dr. Denese&#x27;s Day Cream for 7 or 8 years now; don&#x27;t know what i&#x27;d do if she stopped selling it!</li>
    <li> I love this cream!  Love the color in anything but the summer.  My skin tone gets darker in the summer and this looks like powder then.</li>
    <li> This cream does not cover minor imperfections or flaws.  What it does do, is provide a broad spectrum UVA/UVB SPF30 protection from the sun without feeling greasy or tacky.  It is tinted, so it blends nicely into my fairly light skin.  It has zinc oxide base, yet because of the tint - there is no white residue on the skin.  In my opinion, zinc oxide is perhaps the best ingredient for full spectrum sun protection.  I feel this formula offers the best sun protection with some added skin care benefits.  It is not very emollient, anyone with dry skin will probably want/need to use a moisturizer prior to applying this cream.  My skin is sensitive combination -  this does not cause any irritation nor promote oil production.  It is a nice feeling product.  The cream absorbs and then seems to disappear - vanish - no trace of the product.  I can apply foundation without any \\&quot;roll up\\&quot; .  The tint in this product does not interfere with the color of my foundation.  It absorbs quickly and blends into my skin so well, that I never have any problems when applying foundation and blush.  I really really really like this SPF30 product.  Tube version.</li>
    <li> I have been buying this product for the past 3 years off of QVC at %75 so the price was great saving $20.  This product really works.  It protects my face from the sun.  It is nice cream and actually gives a slight coverage.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for about 5 years and it is my favorite day cream.  I do occasionally use other day creams because I&#x27;ve found through many years of using skin care that plateaus can be reached without switching things up a bit.  This is my experience and ymmv.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is tinted and there are many days that I don&#x27;t bother using a foundation.  Adding a little eye makeup and blush is all that is necessary.  Don&#x27;t expect full coverage.  It isn&#x27;t a substitute for full coverage foundation.  I do recommend using a cleanser that removes makeup because it really stays on like foundation would do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Those with dry skin will probably want to add her hydroshield serum before applying but that is also an outstanding product I use as well.  As a matter-of-fact, I use the hydroshield serum for the body, too, and highly recommend adding that to your beauty regimen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In summary, I reiterate this my favorite day cream.  Full spectrum SPF protection is the best thing we can do for our skin but I think most of us hate the way sunscreen feels on the face.  Most leave a whitish color and feel way too heavy.  Dr. Denese&#x27;s SPF 30 Day Cream fills not only the sunscreen need but is a lovely tint as well.  I&#x27;ll also add that this is the best pricing I have found for the cream and my order experience with the seller was positive.  I will be using them to order my Dr. Denese products.</li>
    <li> very good product, 2nd time ordered.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for a few years now.  I do not use foundation, only the tinted day cream . Great product, I also use the hydro shield.</li>
    <li> I need a day cream with sunscreen and have tried many. This is the best I have found. The whole line of skin are by Dr.&lt;br /&gt;Denese is quite good. Quality doesn&#x27;t fail.</li>
    <li> For some reason, this cream makes my skin feel really dry....I&#x27;m very aware of having something on my face that just doesn&#x27;t feel right.  I&#x27;m going to see how it feels with a hydrating serum applied first (you shouldn&#x27;t have to do this with something that says it hydrates....).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It gives a nice matte finish that lasts throughout the day...despite my having a somewhat oily complexion even at my age (61).  But I have to apply it really thinly or else I look like I&#x27;m wearing a clay masque.  I don&#x27;t really have faith in this thin application for serious Summertime sun and will revert to using my regular tinted sunscreen in the warmer months.  The directions say to apply it liberally...you really don&#x27;t want to do that.</li>
    <li> Other reviewers are correct that this is a very thick lotion.  I usually thin it out just a little with my serum and I love the coverage I get with it.  I&#x27;ve started using a little extra as a concealer, too and it seems to do the trick.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for years and continue to love it!  Love the lightweight feeling and finished look.</li>
    <li> This is good stuff. It looks like it will be a funky color, but it quickly adjusts to any face tone once you rub it in, so don&#x27;t panic when you first put it on your face!</li>
    <li> I started using this product about 4 years ago when I began taking care of my skin on a regular basis.  This product was recommended by Dr. Denese so strongly because it has an SPF of 30.  Dr. Denese really puts a great deal of emphasis on avoiding the sun.  She says that the sun is the single most important thing that will cause skin to age prematurely.  So, she created this product for that specific purpose.  Some people may love this product, but I just didn&#x27;t like wearing a lotion that was rather &amp;#34;heavy&amp;#34; because of the high SPF factor.  It is a good product, and anyone would do well to use it because I, too, know that the sun is so damaging to skin.  But, after a while, it just started to feel like a mask on my face.  The lotion is tinted to look like normal flesh coloring, and it does a good job of that.  Dr. Denese says that it will match anyone&#x27;s natural skin color because it works with your own melanin to produce color.  Melanin is that substance in all of us that is responsible for each individual&#x27;s skin tone.  So, the more melanin you have, the darker your skin will be.  So, this lotion works with your own melanin to produce a color that matches your own skin tone very well.  That is one of the really good things about this product as is the high SPF factor.  Because of those two things, I kept using it for quite a while.  It is made to be a foundation used under makeup, and it works well for that use.  However, I just didn&#x27;t like putting a heavy lotion that was tinted as well on my skin.  It does do what she claims it will do, so don&#x27;t get me wrong.  It was just a matter of personal preference for me.  I discontinued using it and replaced it with another product that I liked better even though it didn&#x27;t have those nice SPF qualities.  I simply try not to be out in the sun for long periods of time without a sunblock purchased just for that purpose.  I can say in defense of Dr. Denese that there was one summer where I spent all day every day out in the sun because we were landscaping our yard.  I put on this lotion before I started working outside every day, and I didn&#x27;t get even the slightest burn or damage from the sun.  I would recommend this lotion to anyone who doesn&#x27;t mind the characteristics of it that I have spoken about here.  Everyone is different, and so are their likes and dislikes.  It is definitely a very good product, but even though I knew that, I simply didn&#x27;t like using it.  It made my face feel &amp;#34;mealy&amp;#34; if that makes sense to anyone.  So, after knowing these things and you still want to give it a try for yourself, I would recommend you do so.  It definitely has some very healthy properties for the skin.the sun because we were landscaping our yard.

    <li> One tube lasts amazingly long. The cream is light, gives a good coverage and you don&#x27;t need foundation. Love it.</li>
    <li> Product is the best!  Have used this product for years and still do;  works on any skin tone and matches perfect plus it has SPF .  I will continue to purchase</li>
    <li> use this cream daily as a moisturizer and a daycream.  gives me protection and gives me some color to my face with heavy makeup.</li>
