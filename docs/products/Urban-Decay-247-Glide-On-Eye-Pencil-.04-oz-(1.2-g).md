      <li>AM VERY HAPPY WITH THE PRODUCT AND SERVICE.</li>
      <li>THIS IS THE BEST EYELINER EVER!</li>
      <li>My sister tried two colors and loved them, but she never stopped complaining about their price or the price of the sharpener (which you will need as they work best when sharpened).  </li>
      <li>24/7 Eye Pencils are really great.  </li>
      <li>How can it work so great for everyone else but not me?</li>
      <li>I agree, but I am still happy because I am not as cheap as she is!!!  </li>
      <li>This is my favorite pencil eyeliner!!</li>
      <li>It lasts all day and looks very nice.</li>
      <li>These pencils are great because of their ease of application, wonderful colors available (with amusing names!), and their durability.      </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s perfect for when you aren&#x27;t up for a huge cross-brand swatch and sample adventure.  </li>
      <li>the bright side, I don&#x27;t have to remove it at the end of the day.</li>
      <li>However, if you don&#x27;t like to sleep with any makeup on then this might not be a good one because it stays overnight, even if you wash your face.  </li>

      <li>colors seem pretty awesome too.</li>

      <li>I am sensitive to dressing and making myself up as befits my age (as I am proud and happy to be in my 40s), and I am not in the slightest bit concerned that these eyeliners scream \\&quot;please</li>
      <li>This pencil eyeliner does goes on very easy, but it does not stay on like the product description states.  </li>
      <li>I absolutely love love this!</li>
      <li>This is the best eyeliner out there by far that I have tried and I think I&#x27;ve tried just about all of them.</li>
      <li>Now I am still happy with it, but less impressed.</li>
      <li>I love the amount of colors it comes in and how great of a texture it was, but it just isnt worth the money.</li>
      <li>It was nice to use a pencil eyeliner that went on so smoothly, but I wouldn&#x27;t describe this eyeliner as long-lasting or waterproof.</li>
      <li>I love the colors \\&quot;Zero,\\&quot; \\&quot;Bourbon,\\&quot; and</li>
      <li>I just expect more from a respected brand, and for the price they are asking!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
      <li>Okay $20 for one tube of eyeliner is a lot</li>
      <li>I have also enjoyed:</li>
      <li>you will not only pay but be really happy that they exist at all!!</li>
      <li>Otherwise I have no complaints and I love that it is a vegan product.</li>
      <li>UD has created a phenomenal shade range; there is literally something for every occasion.  </li>
      <li>I was glad to see someone else noticed the odor.  </li>
      <li>Love this</li>
      <li>I have most of the colors and use them according to whim.  </li>
      <li>The quantity of colors only adds to the benefit of this awesome product!</li>
      <li>By the way the Urban Decay sharpener is awesome too!</li>
      <li>It goes on OK.</li>
      <li>Granted, some shades are better than orders, but at the end of the day this liner always works.  </li>
      <li>THIS EYELINER IS OK, IT JUST ISN&#x27;T</li>
      <li>\\&quot;Demolition.\\&quot; \\&quot;Demolition\\&quot; and \\&quot;Bourbon\\&quot; work beautifully together when creating a more natural look.</li>
      <li>I have worked in the cosmetics industry for a long time and this is the best eye liner pencil I have found in years!  </li>
      <li>It is a pretty good eye pencil.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s creamy and smooth, easy to apply!</li>
      <li>Perhaps the way that eye makeup is applied is more important than the color?  </li>
      <li>Quick and easy!</li>
      <li>This pencil gives Kohl eye look and glides easily over the eye.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s so easy to work with.</li>
      <li>Honestly I was more impressed with it a few years ago when I first used it.</li>
      <li>BUT ZERO IS THE BEST BLACK EYELINER OUT THERE.</li>
      <li>It stays on applies smoothly, doesn&#x27;t smudge, and wears all day.  </li>
      <li>colors looks amazing and blends very well.</li>
      <li>Loved this stuff until I developed an allergy to it.</li>
      <li>It is very creamy and very easy to apply.</li>
      <li>AND IT LAST ALL DAY, ITS AMAZING AND A MUSH HAVE!</li>
      <li>Overall, these are great liners to reach for, but, at the end of the day, these aren&#x27;t my absolute favorite.</li>
      <li>Have Fun!</li>
      <li>Lucky is like a shiny copper penny, Bourbon is a light bronze-ish medium brown</li>
      <li>It is nice and dark and goes on very smoothly and easily.</li>
      <li>Most won&#x27;t show up on the water line, and you have to really pull at your skin to get the line to appear.</li>
      <li>It easily glides on the first time you use it.</li>
      <li>I own many different colors and the most practical by far</li>
      <li>I love this eye liners, Really (and I say Really) last a lot and colors are beautiful, THIS SELLER WAS VERY FAST AND RESPONSIBLE WITH SHIPPING...</li>
      <li>They have consistently created VERY good eyeliners, but for great liners, I seem to have found hidden gems in other lines.  </li>
      <li>First off, I think the rimmel scandal eyes are actually more creamy and feel like a higher end product than these.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a very lovely deep black liner that was excellent for tight-lining because unlike most liners, it actually stayed put.</li>
      <li>Youth will look even more scrumptious than usual, while older good looks are enhanced!    </li>
      <li>I used to not be able to wear eyeliner because my eyes are very sensitive and would swell shut.</li>
      <li>(an idea that is debatable and based upon the individual, surely?!?  </li>
      <li>Liked the UD liner better than Revlon because it&#x27;s just a darker, richer black liner.      </li>
      <li>The consistency is really creamy and it runs smoothly on the eye, but again, the product runs out quickly.</li>
      <li>I have been using the Zero eyeliner and really like it, but it seems that after a while an odor develops-not particularly unpleasant-but very strong.  </li>
      <li>&quot; colour all the time, great for anyone with green eyes.  </li>
      <li>A friend introduced me to Urban Decay years ago and at the time I really liked it.</li>
      <li>but this item is totally worth the splurge.</li>
      <li>I am wondering if it is absorbed into my system and I have a concern about safety.</li>
      <li>This stays on all day even if my skin is super oily or the weather is really hot and humid.</li>
      <li>The product runs out quickly if you line your eye straight from the pencil.</li>
      <li>It really does go on smoothly and you can smudge it out with a brush to create a soft or bold look -</li>
      <li>Highly Recommend this eyeliner!!</li>
      <li>I will rate higher than I think, because again, I feel as if my inexperience with makeup could be a factor.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I have used many stick eyeliners in my life and they all end up doing the same thing, they smudge and wear off-</li>
      <li>I´ll buy again, THANKS!</li>
      <li>I hope they offer more colors in the future.</li>
      <li>I love these pencils immensely and this shade is no exception.</li>
      <li>I love the Urban Decay eye liner since I first used it.</li>
      <li>Replacement of this eye pencil can be frequent and adds up quickly, but in my opinion it is worth it.</li>
      <li>It looks great and stays on through the work day, plus no more swollen and itchy eyes!</li>
      <li>I read quite a few of amazing reviews and realized its worth a try.</li>
      <li>and it stays all day long :)</li>
      <li>2 best things about this liner is that it is waterline safe for contact lens wearers (I have had problems with other liners flaking off and getting stuck to my contacts and irritating my eyes), and that it is smudgeable!  </li>
      <li>Because of the pencils&#x27; fabulous texture that is the perfect density (not too hard, not too soft--Goldilocks and all of that....), they will then last all day or all night without too much liner gooping under the eye by the evening or next day.      </li>
      <li>The one draw back is that it lifts off easily.</li>
      <li>This is the only downside of the product, otherwise it is really quite fantastic.</li>
      <li>I use gentle makeup wipes to take it</li>
      <li>It really does stay all day without having to retouch.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I would definitely recommend this eyeliner!  I am a huge fan of eyeliner and until recently I just used the generic eye pencils from Sephora.  This 24/7 liner from UD is a huge upgrade (both in quality and price) over the hard pencil liners that tug and poke!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 2 best things about this liner is that it is waterline safe for contact lens wearers (I have had problems with other liners flaking off and getting stuck to my contacts and irritating my eyes), and that it is smudgeable!  It really does go on smoothly and you can smudge it out with a brush to create a soft or bold look - whatever you want!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This liner is long lasting - it will stay on all day exactly as you applied it.  Just be aware that you will have to carefully remove it from your waterline at the end of the day with, especially if you wear contacts, because it will just stay there.  I use gentle makeup wipes to take it off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this eyeliner.  $17 is a bit steep, but you are paying that price for a high quality product.</li>
    <li> This eyeliner is the best one I have ever used. It really does stay all day without having to retouch. Highly Recommend this eyeliner!!</li>
    <li> These pencils are great because of their ease of application, wonderful colors available (with amusing names!), and their durability.      Until these eyeliners, I had never had much luck with eye pencils as they were hard to apply (literally hard as a rock) or too difficult to rub in or the opposite they were too soft and ran causing dark lines to form above your eye or black smudges under the eyes etc.  These pencils apply nicely.  They are not too soft or too hard, so that they can be smudged just so or even removed by rubbing gently and reapplying etc.      The great colors rely heavily on sprinklings of other colors, so that a brown like Bourbon or Stash has a number of colors swirled into it along with the brown.  If you have hazel eyes, you can bring a lot of colors out.  If you have brown eyes (like me), you can have a less intense look to your eyeliner.   I have most of the colors and use them according to whim.  If I use one that is blue or green (Mildew) I can then rub it in to make it less strong and reline the eye with a black or brown so that the blue or green is not too monolithic.     As an aside, these pencils work well whether you are old or young.  For those of you who have heard the generalization that older women (late 30s to 50s on up) should not wear sparkles or glitter as it makes them look older  (an idea that is debatable and based upon the individual, surely?!?  Perhaps the way that eye makeup is applied is more important than the color?  If you lay it on thick, you had better be young or you might look ridiculous?), I must report that these pencils are \\&quot;adult\\&quot; enough.  In other words, these pencils are not best for teenagers or 20 year olds in spite of the youthful names of the colors.   I am sensitive to dressing and making myself up as befits my age (as I am proud and happy to be in my 40s), and I am not in the slightest bit concerned that these eyeliners scream \\&quot;please think that I am ten years younger\\&quot; in any way!!  I would hate that.They work quite well whether you are young or old.  Youth will look even more scrumptious than usual, while older good looks are enhanced!    Because of the pencils&#x27; fabulous texture that is the perfect density (not too hard, not too soft--Goldilocks and all of that....), they will then last all day or all night without too much liner gooping under the eye by the evening or next day.      Bottom line--It depends upon how attached you are to money and how drawn to makeup you are.  My sister tried two colors and loved them, but she never stopped complaining about their price or the price of the sharpener (which you will need as they work best when sharpened).  She also complained that the sharpener shaved away too much of the pencil when used.   I agree, but I am still happy because I am not as cheap as she is!!!  No doubt, the expense for the pencil is ridiculous as is the price of the sharpener, but if you accept that eyeliners have to be expensive to be decent (like I have) you will not only pay but be really happy that they exist at all!!</li>
    <li> This is my favorite pencil eyeliner!! It&#x27;s creamy and smooth, easy to apply! I&#x27;ve been using it for 2 years now.</li>
    <li> I was glad to see someone else noticed the odor.  I have been using the Zero eyeliner and really like it, but it seems that after a while an odor develops-not particularly unpleasant-but very strong.  I am wondering if it is absorbed into my system and I have a concern about safety.</li>
    <li> I was sick of spending money trying different eyeliners that would last an hr or two max. I randomly tried this eyeliner out in black and now I&#x27;m addicted. I only have to put it on once in the morning and it stays all day long :) Def worth the money!!!</li>
    <li> THIS EYELINER IS OK, IT JUST ISN&#x27;T FOR ME. I AM LOOKING FOR ONE THAT DOESN&#x27;T SMEAR AND DOESN&#x27;T FLAKE.</li>
    <li> This is an eyeliner that flat-out performs, all day everyday.  UD has created a phenomenal shade range; there is literally something for every occasion.  This is a liner that I have come to count on.  It&#x27;s perfect for when you aren&#x27;t up for a huge cross-brand swatch and sample adventure.  Granted, some shades are better than orders, but at the end of the day this liner always works.  It stays on applies smoothly, doesn&#x27;t smudge, and wears all day.  However, as I review my makeup stash, I come to realize that very few of my favorite eyeliners are UD.  They have consistently created VERY good eyeliners, but for great liners, I seem to have found hidden gems in other lines.  Overall, these are great liners to reach for, but, at the end of the day, these aren&#x27;t my absolute favorite.</li>
    <li> This pencil eyeliner does goes on very easy, but it does not stay on like the product description states.  It was nice to use a pencil eyeliner that went on so smoothly, but I wouldn&#x27;t describe this eyeliner as long-lasting or waterproof.</li>
    <li> This eyeliner glides on great!  It&#x27;s so easy to work with. The only thing I didn&#x27;t like was that it didn&#x27;t stay on through the night for me.</li>
    <li> I have used many stick eyeliners in my life and they all end up doing the same thing, they smudge and wear off- not this eyeliner. I often use liquid eyeliner due to the fact that I only have to apply it once; however, since ordering these, I have been using stick eyeliner once again. I love the colors \\&quot;Zero,\\&quot; \\&quot;Bourbon,\\&quot; and \\&quot;Demolition.\\&quot; \\&quot;Demolition\\&quot; and \\&quot;Bourbon\\&quot; work beautifully together when creating a more natural look. I am sold on this eyeliner for life. I absolutely love it!</li>
    <li> I love these pencils immensely and this shade is no exception. It is nice and dark and goes on very smoothly and easily. It lasts until I take it off. The only place the lasting power isn&#x27;t present is when using on the waterline. I thought since these were waterline safe that they had a shot of lasting decently long. These last about 2 hours on the waterline before disappearing completely. This is the only downside of the product, otherwise it is really quite fantastic.</li>
    <li> I have been a long-time user for urban decay products, but the \\&quot;24/7\\&quot; eyeliner is NOT waterproof. After a few hours it starts to smudge. I wore it to the pool one day and I came out with eyeliner down to my chin. I love the amount of colors it comes in and how great of a texture it was, but it just isnt worth the money.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a very lovely deep black liner that was excellent for tight-lining because unlike most liners, it actually stayed put. Loved this stuff until I developed an allergy to it. Took about a year of use before I developed any clear signs or symptoms. Had used Revlon&#x27;s Colorstay for the same purpose (with similar stay-put results) and also developed an allergy, so I think it&#x27;s more me than the product... Liked the UD liner better than Revlon because it&#x27;s just a darker, richer black liner.      Currently have switched to Mac&#x27;s Technakohl in Graphblack. Haven&#x27;t had any issues. It&#x27;s also a deep, dark black. Less glossy than UD&#x27;s though.</li>
    <li> A friend introduced me to Urban Decay years ago and at the time I really liked it. The 24/7 glide-on eye pencil isn&#x27;t what I would call \\&quot;24/7\\&quot;. Its long lasting yes, but it does begin to fade and come off rather quickly. Honestly I was more impressed with it a few years ago when I first used it. Now I am still happy with it, but less impressed. I don&#x27;t mind using it, just have to touch it up every now and then.</li>
    <li> I love the Urban Decay eye liner since I first used it. I ordered my eyeliner and two days later received my package. Wonderful. Quick and easy! Thank you.</li>
    <li> I love this eye liners, Really (and I say Really) last a lot and colors are beautiful, THIS SELLER WAS VERY FAST AND RESPONSIBLE WITH SHIPPING... AM VERY HAPPY WITH THE PRODUCT AND SERVICE. I´ll buy again, THANKS!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a while and I really like it. Its almost as dark as a liquid eyeliner! It is pretty soft though and you have to sharpen it a lot to get precision. Otherwise I have no complaints and I love that it is a vegan product.</li>
    <li> I really am confused about the hype around these eye pencils.  First off, I think the rimmel scandal eyes are actually more creamy and feel like a higher end product than these.  I have SUPER oily eyelids, and these boast about being long lasting.  This is not the case for me and my oily lids...in fact, they transferred to my upper lids and disappeared in a few hours.  I was hoping to finally find a pencil I could love and use on a daily basis, but this isn&#x27;t it.  If you like pencils, and they are your go-to..I still wouldn&#x27;t recommend them over a drug-store product (again, rimmel) here&#x27;s why: color payoff.  I had to go over my line a FEW times to get a super rich color.  I just expect more from a respected brand, and for the price they are asking!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, random side note: this page is set up horribly, the colors aren&#x27;t shown in any way.  Someone read this comment, someone fix it.</li>
    <li> Okay $20 for one tube of eyeliner is a lot but this item is totally worth the splurge. It lasts all day and looks very nice. It is very creamy and very easy to apply. I got this in Shade Zero which is very dark black. It looks very Dramatic and gorgeously. BEST-EYELINER-EVER-MADE!!!!</li>
    <li> This is by far my favourite Urban Decay line of anything.  I use the bronze-ish \\&quot;Lucky\\&quot; colour all the time, great for anyone with green eyes.  Gives a hint of sparkle without being over-the-top about it.</li>
    <li> This black liner came with an eyelash kit I got from Urban Decay, I use it on top of my liquid liner to set it and it works so well! I put it on at 7 AM and at 7PM I looked in the mirror and realized my liner looked the exact same! Love this</li>
    <li> This stays on all day even if my skin is super oily or the weather is really hot and humid. Immediately after applying, you can smudge it for a smokey effect, but after 30 secs or so, it sets and will stay on until you take it off with make-up remover.  It is rain and sweat-proof and I&#x27;ve even gone swimming with it and it stayed on!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love love this! colors looks amazing and blends very well. I bought 2 of these and some of these colors and I am very satisfied.   [...]</li>
    <li> The only eyeliner I will ever use now. Creamy and easy to apply yet long lasting. I put this on in the morning and it stays there until I wash it off at night. This is the best eyeliner out there by far that I have tried and I think I&#x27;ve tried just about all of them. I hope they offer more colors in the future.</li>
    <li> For all the positive hype this product receives, I was really surprised that it doesn&#x27;t go on very smoothly or very dark, and it smudged from my eyes within an hour or less.  I did not find it to be waterproof or smudge-proof at all.  I also found that I had to press down very hard on my skin to get the color to be dark enough, and I bought it in black.  I can&#x27;t seem to find a pencil eyeliner that goes on dark and stays on for hours.  I guess I&#x27;ll have to try the liquid stuff.</li>
    <li> THIS IS THE BEST EYELINER EVER! IT IS SO DARK AND INTENSE, ITS AMAZING, NOT ALL THE COLORS WORK AS WELL, LIKE THE PURPLE AND THE WHITE SUCK! BUT ZERO IS THE BEST BLACK EYELINER OUT THERE. MINE DOES NOT RUN OR SMUDGE AND IT LAST ALL DAY, ITS AMAZING AND A MUSH HAVE!</li>
    <li> It is a pretty good eye pencil. Quite a few of the ones I have tried are too hard and you have to apply them 10 times hoping they&#x27;d soak up some moisture from your eyes and actually work.  Those are the ones that you get sick of easily and your eyes more than you. Urban decay glide-on eye pencil does what the name implies. It easily glides on the first time you use it. It&#x27;s very soft and creamy and doesn&#x27;t hurt the eyes at all.  I have noticed, though, that it smudges after some time, which is really the only problem I have with it. But if add a steak of eye shadow on my lower waterline, it stays put.  However, if you don&#x27;t like to sleep with any makeup on then this might not be a good one because it stays overnight, even if you wash your face.  I do have really sensitive eyes and it doesn&#x27;t seem to affect them at all, so nothing to worry about like that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The colors seem pretty awesome too. I just haven&#x27;t been bold enough to try any other than black.</li>
    <li> This could be my inexperience with makeup talking, but while it did last, it was soo...whats a good word here? Like oozy marker, not liquid, but you could very well find yourself with way too much on. I will rate higher than I think, because again, I feel as if my inexperience with makeup could be a factor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It did(is still) lasting forever, and I use a smudger to spread it out.</li>
    <li> This pencil gives Kohl eye look and glides easily over the eye.  The one draw back is that it lifts off easily.</li>
    <li> I have worked in the cosmetics industry for a long time and this is the best eye liner pencil I have found in years!  It wears extremely well, doesn&#x27;t pull when applied (it actually glides on), waterproof/doesn&#x27;t smudge or run, makes a medium line when not sharpened and has never had the colored tip fall out or break off out of the center when sharpening (unlike a lot of pencils). The quantity of colors only adds to the benefit of this awesome product! You&#x27;re going to love using it, now if you can only decide which color.. Zero is the basic black that I use on a regular basis. I have also enjoyed: Ransom is a brighter violet purple, Lust is a darker blue-violet purple, Lucky is like a shiny copper penny, Bourbon is a light bronze-ish medium brown, Binge is a medium navy blue with a hint of silver, Oil-Slick is a black with small flecks of silver glitter, Rockstar and Crash are more of a burgundy color with Crash having flecks of silver, Underground is more of a medium brown, Demolition is dark brown and Gunmetal is a shiny silver. Have Fun! By the way the Urban Decay sharpener is awesome too!</li>
    <li> I used to not be able to wear eyeliner because my eyes are very sensitive and would swell shut. I bought this product under a last resort and it worked! I have never had any trouble with this eyeliner. It looks great and stays on through the work day, plus no more swollen and itchy eyes!</li>
    <li> Urban Decay 24/7 Eye Pencils are really great.  They have intense color payout, but can be smudged to make the color less harsh.  I own many different colors and the most practical by far is the basic color: \\&quot;Zero.\\&quot;  The tip dulls very quickly, so if you wear this daily, you will be sharpening every couple of days.  Replacement of this eye pencil can be frequent and adds up quickly, but in my opinion it is worth it.</li>
    <li> In my 12+ years of being makeup obsessed, I&#x27;ve tried countless eye pencils. Most won&#x27;t show up on the water line, and you have to really pull at your skin to get the line to appear. Not with this pencil. It glides on with minimal effort, and applies on the waterline nice and dark. I can line my eyes in just a few seconds because I don&#x27;t have to go over it multiple times. It stays dark and vibrant all day long without smudging or running. This is the ultimate eye pencil, and I will never be using another brand. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> The product runs out quickly if you line your eye straight from the pencil. The consistency is really creamy and it runs smoothly on the eye, but again, the product runs out quickly. What I do now is I take a liner brush and brush it on the tip of the pencil so it doesn&#x27;t use too much product and line my eyes with the brush. I ordered this in early 2014 and I still have it now in late jan. 2015.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I tried using this to line my water line and it still smudged. Despite the name it still smudges on your eyes so if you don&#x27;t have the money to spend I would just get a drug store eyeliner because this basically does the same thing</li>
    <li> I recently bought one of these eyeliner pencils after a friend tried one. I read quite a few of amazing reviews and realized its worth a try. I have been using black eye shadow and a brush for years. It would always smear and fade as the day went on and I just accepted it. But no more!&lt;br /&gt;Wrong!! Today was my third day using this new eyeliner. It goes on OK. My eyeshadow did too. I probably just need to get used to this. However, as the day goes on it just seems to disappear!! It really doesn&#x27;t smear or run much, but it&#x27;s just gone. Where does it go??! I will admit that I do have oily skin.&lt;br /&gt;On the bright side, I don&#x27;t have to remove it at the end of the day. I&#x27;m really disappointed in my new $19 eye pencil. How can it work so great for everyone else but not me? Back to my $1.99 eyeshadow.</li>
