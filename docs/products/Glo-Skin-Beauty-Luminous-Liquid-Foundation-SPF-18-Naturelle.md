### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>shipping was great!!</li>
      <li>Best foundation ever.</li>
      <li>Use glo face primer for best results.</li>
      <li>perfect !</li>
      <li>This is a wonderful product.</li>
      <li>I apply it with a foundation brush and it goes on perfectly.</li>
      <li>So happy that I gave a sample that was sent to me a try.</li>
      <li>I thought I&#x27;d have flawless skin, but it&#x27;s too shiny, and didn&#x27;t reflect any light away from my imperfections.</li>
      <li>I was told that this would be just as good.  </li>
      <li>Love this foundation!  </li>
      <li>I love this foundation !</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s just kind of greasy-looking.</li>
      <li>Very creamy with good coverage &amp; feels great on the skin.</li>
      <li>I found this liquid foundation very easy to apply just with my fingers.  </li>
      <li>think I&#x27;d have better luck with a drug store brand, to be honest, and would be about $35 wealthier.</li>
      <li>Love it and will continue to use....</li>
      <li>Easy to find your match.</li>
      <li>but the foundation was fine inside.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s light weight and gives me the coverage I need.</li>
      <li>I have old acne scars and skin issues and the first day using this product I received compliments saying how beautiful my skin looks.</li>
      <li>Although I found it kind of light, but it blends well with the skin tone after it sets, leaving a very dewy and fresh look.  </li>
      <li>I think it&#x27;d be great for dry skin.  </li>
      <li>It also did not provide a full coverage like the original does.</li>
      <li>When I first pumped it, I thought for sure it would not provide enough coverage, but it does a good job at being a full coverage.</li>
      <li>I had this makeup applied after a facial and loved it.</li>
      <li>Has good coverage, but cannot wear to dry consistancy.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t offer the same &#x27;dewy&#x27; coverage of my favorite brand, either...</li>
      <li>I purchased this from my local salon after they stopped carrying my favorite brand of liquid mineral foundation</li>
      <li>It seems almost &#x27;slippery&#x27; and the coverage doesn&#x27;t last all day like my favorite brand.</li>
      <li>This foundation is very drying.  </li>
      <li>Not so much.  </li>
      <li>I love all other glo minerals makeup though.</li>
      <li>I would highly recommend and will purchase again.</li>
      <li>I have sensitive skin and this suits me more than any other I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
      <li>It really gives the skin a natural glow look and it didn&#x27;t make my skin break out whatsoever.</li>
      <li>Compared to the regular gloMinerals Satin II foundation, Luxe felt much oilier on my skin.</li>

<li> I like the product but expected the same coverage as my previous foundation, and it just doesn&#x27;t measure up.</li>
<li> I give it 4 stars because the foundations leaks around the pump when it is turned on its side (in my makeup bag for example..impossible to stand it up at all times) but other than that the makeup itself should get 5 stars.</li>
<li> Covers flaws without bring heavy.</li>
<li> and I got the wrong shade</li>
<li> This make up is quite expensive.</li>
<li> IT was broken to pieces!!!</li>
<li> I was extremely disappointed!!</li>

    <li> I have been using this product for a year or so, and the fact that I continue to purchase it, says it all.</li>

    <li> This foundation is very drying.  Has good coverage, but cannot wear to dry consistancy.</li>
    <li> The package was damaged when I got it but the foundation was fine inside.

    <li> I love this foundation ! It&#x27;s light weight and gives me the coverage I need. I apply it with a foundation brush and it goes on perfectly. So happy that I gave a sample that was sent to me a try.</li>
    <li> Broke my face out. I think it&#x27;d be great for dry skin.  I love all other glo minerals makeup though.</li>
    <li> I purchased this from my local salon after they stopped carrying my favorite brand of liquid mineral foundation (that starts with a &#x27;J&#x27;).  I was told that this would be just as good.  Not so much.  It seems almost &#x27;slippery&#x27; and the coverage doesn&#x27;t last all day like my favorite brand. It doesn&#x27;t offer the same &#x27;dewy&#x27; coverage of my favorite brand, either...it&#x27;s just kind of greasy-looking. It also made me break out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think I&#x27;d have better luck with a drug store brand, to be honest, and would be about $35 wealthier.</li>
    <li> I had this makeup applied after a facial and loved it. I wore it all day before deciding to order it. Love it and will continue to use....I have sensitive skin and this suits me more than any other I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> This make up is quite expensive. When I first pumped it, I thought for sure it would not provide enough coverage, but it does a good job at being a full coverage. I thought I&#x27;d have flawless skin, but it&#x27;s too shiny, and didn&#x27;t reflect any light away from my imperfections.</li>
    <li> Compared to the regular gloMinerals Satin II foundation, Luxe felt much oilier on my skin. It also did not provide a full coverage like the original does. It also has some shimmering effect, or could it be just the oily nature of this foundation? I am going to stick to GloMinerals protective foundation (http://smile.amazon.com/glominerals-gloProtective-Liquid-Foundation-Honey-Light/dp/B001HXAI8S/ref&#x3D;sr_1_8?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1416879845&amp;sr&#x3D;8-8&amp;keywords&#x3D;glominerals)</li>
    <li> Love this foundation!  Very creamy with good coverage &amp; feels great on the skin. I started using it after the plastic surgeon recommended it. Will never use anything else!!</li>
    <li> Best foundation ever. Covers flaws without bring heavy. Lots of shades to choose from. Easy to find your match. Use glo face primer for best results.</li>
    <li> I found this liquid foundation very easy to apply just with my fingers.  Although I found it kind of light, but it blends well with the skin tone after it sets, leaving a very dewy and fresh look.  I would highly recommend and will purchase again.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful product. I have old acne scars and skin issues and the first day using this product I received compliments saying how beautiful my skin looks. It really gives the skin a natural glow look and it didn&#x27;t make my skin break out whatsoever.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure what to feel about the foundation because trying to find the correct color using the online shade chart was super hard and I got the wrong shade so I can&#x27;t even use it to see what it is like.  So, my review is a bit skewed.</li>
    <li> IT was broken to pieces!!! I was extremely disappointed!!</li>
    <li> perfect ! shipping was great!!</li>
