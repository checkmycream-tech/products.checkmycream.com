    <li> got the hair today. I ordered it sunday..... really quick service. They hair feels really nice in texture and the hair looks exactly like the picture. I am actually surprised I expected to have to work with it a lot but it seems great. really soft a couple of greys but i plan on dying the hair anyway. SO far it is perfect i got just what i wanted</li>
    <li> The hair is very pretty at first, but then it tends to get matted up , &amp; it sheds A LOT !!</li>
    <li> DON&#x27;T PURCHASE THIS HAIR IT&#x27;S A TOTAL RIP OFF THE HAIR IS SYNTHETIC &amp; DON&#x27;T CURL. I admit the hair looks good on their site but when it arrives it isn&#x27;t real Brazillian hair. You can&#x27;t curl it cause the hair will melt. I reckon you get what you pay for</li>
    <li> Hair is beautiful but it sheds a lot. I don&#x27;t think it will last long, But the hair is beautiful.</li>

    <li> It&#x27;s suppose to Be Brazilian Human Hair. It&#x27;s not it&#x27;s A Human Hair Blend. I paid alot of Money formy hair an it&#x27;s Not what I was suppose to get. My Beautician an I were floored by the quality of this Suppose to be Human Hair. I demand to get what I paid for It&#x27;s not right for them to sell bad hair an lie an say it&#x27;s Human. I want JUSTICE</li>
    <li> I love my hair. Eliza Wigs is a great company. Very responsive. Its everything I wanted &amp;&amp; I get great compliments every I go. Must purchase.</li>
    <li> This hair was HORRIBLE! It shedded way too much. I had hair everywhere. There were synthetic fibers in it. Not all human hair. Tangled too much as well.</li>
    <li> not enough hair onj the bundles although the quality is very nice three bundles could barely do my entire head.</li>
    <li> I really like this hair.  It is really long and it matches my hair texture perfectly. I have gotten many compliments on it, the only thing is that it does not hold curls that good.  Other than that I will be ordering this again&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After washing this hair, it sheds terribly and frizzes.  I blew it out and flat ironed it and curled, but after about an hour the curls dropped and the hair tangles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My advice do not buy this hair</li>

    <li> Very Bad!!!!!Customer Service was poor.Person was unkind.Hair was not as expected..The person selling is a liar and the play many games with you.The hair frizzed up and was not true to lenghth...poor service.</li>
    <li> Being this cheap I didn&#x27;t know what to expect but the hair is of great quality and is better than I thought it would be. Similar bundles are 350+ so I saved a lot.</li>
