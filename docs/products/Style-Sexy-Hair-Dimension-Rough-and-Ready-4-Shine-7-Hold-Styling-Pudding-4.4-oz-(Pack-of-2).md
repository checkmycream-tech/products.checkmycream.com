    <li> Best hair gel ever.  I. Don&#x27;t understand why they stopped  making this.  The new formula that they are selling in place of this doesn&#x27;t work as well, you get less, and it is more expensive.  I&#x27;m glad I can still buy this on Amazon for the time being.</li>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t what I thought it was, but it works pretty good.</li>
    <li> Very happy with this product.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the best for fine short hair..never greasy. Wish you would go back to selling it in 3 packs.</li>

I have researched everything on the market and can&#x27;t find anything that compares.
