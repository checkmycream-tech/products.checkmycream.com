### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>But the color is perfect.</li>
      <li>And it&#x27;s a perfect</li>
      <li>The best BB Cream out there!</li>
      <li>Jvlogger Mimei recommended this product, and I have to say it&#x27;s quite excellent.</li>
      <li>This matches my skin sooo perfectly!!</li>
      <li>match!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have combination skin, and this BB cream does a great job at controlling the oiliness in my t-zone while also not drying out the rest of my face.</li>
      <li>this is absolutely amazing!</li>
      <li>you are always looking at the lightest makeup in brands this should be a good match.</li>
      <li>too fair for 90% of the &amp;#34;fair&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>Super happy with this purchase !</li>
      <li>and I love it!</li>
      <li>My favorite BB cream ever!</li>
      <li>Absolutely love this BB cream!</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s own.</li>
      <li>After a while I honestly started to think that maybe foundation in my shade just didn&#x27;t exist.</li>
      <li>This product matches my extremely pale skin perfectly, and it gives me perfect coverage without looking too cakey.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s light and pleasing to the skin, but provides nice coverage!</li>
      <li>Great if you have a neutral to cool skin tone.</li>
      <li>It spreads and blends very easily on skin</li>
      <li>have fair skin with light freckling across my nose and cheeks.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s also a bit too light!</li>
      <li>The Signature BB Cream runs just a tad lighter and more yellow toned than the Perfect Cover BB cream</li>
      <li>I need to stock up for sure. ^^</li>
      <li>Those are tinted moisturizers, this is more like a medium-coverage foundation.</li>
      <li>(most products date codes show expiration, not production)</li>
      <li>I do still use a separate moisturizer before I put this on as I feel it helps me get a more even amount of coverage with the BB</li>
      <li>(it adheres to the skin better).</li>
      <li>This is not my favorite BB Cream.</li>
      <li>This will be my go-to bb cream unless something even better ever comes along.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad I did</li>
      <li>good bb cream, it has a nice fragrance too, don&#x27;t use too much</li>
      <li>one light enough for my skin tone, but this matches perfectly.</li>
      <li>so if you are pink toned, you may have better luck with the Perfect Cover in 13.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>be too light for most people</li>
      <li>Won&#x27;t break you out, moisturizes, and looks great on mature skin</li>
      <li>/&gt;Signature BB can be a little oily for already oily skinned people, however my friends with oily skin seem to have great luck towards oil control by letting the BB absorb into the skin a bit, then applying a good setting powder.</li>
      <li>I have Purchased the Missha M Perfect Cover BB cream in #21 which is slightly greyish but once applied it seems to adapt well to my face.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s pleasant and not overpowering, though if people are extremely sensitive to that sort of thing it may not be for them.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s very easy to build up to a higher coverage.</li>
      <li>My skin is lightly combination</li>
      <li>It provides light to medium coverage, but doesn&#x27;t need a primer.</li>
      <li>The color is fantastic, but the texture is a bit off.</li>
      <li>It was sooo light</li>
      <li>Best Bb for pale gals.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m pretty sure it will be too light for winter days as well.</li>
      <li>It fits my skin color perfectly and doesn&#x27;t leave my face looking oily and greasy after a few hours!</li>
      <li>(Although it isn&#x27;t an all-natural product by far), is very moisturizing and provides great coverage whether you want a more natural or formal look.  </li>
      <li>&lt;br /&gt;**Not for super oily skin</li>
      <li>It lasted all day and it still looked very good when I got home, though I&#x27;m not sure how it holds up with sweating</li>
      <li>but this is my new favorite.</li>
      <li>I will definitely be buying more!</li>
      <li>If you find that most drugstore and even high-end foundations don&#x27;t fit your skintone definitely give this one a try.</li>
      <li>Like the skin79 bb, it&#x27;s so natural looking, no one can tell you are wearing a bb cream, yet it covers very well for freckles and fine lines and feels moisturized !</li>
      <li>This is my first BB cream purchase and I did a lot of research online before trying one out.</li>
      <li>Better in my opinion than the red tube，because</li>
      <li>Anyway, I like this one better than skin79 because it stays with my face for hours even though I have a very red complexion</li>
      <li>Seems a little ashy and makes my skin super oily, but has nice coverage and feels moisturizing.</li>
      <li>So don&#x27;t touch your face for 5-10 minutes after applying and then set it in the powder of your choice to dry and secure it, and you will be good to go all day long.  </li>
      <li>and I got the lightest color because I have such fair skin, but that was a bit too white.</li>
      <li>The #13 goes on slightly grey, I&#x27;m guessing its because of the sunscreen, but that fades within 20-30 seconds to provide a coverage and color that is better than any foundation I have used before- including my Mac foundations.  </li>
      <li>but the consistency was really runny</li>
      <li>Over the years I&#x27;ve tried the lightest shade of every foundation and BB cream I&#x27;ve ever come across, and nothing has ever been even close to being light enough.</li>
      <li>This BB cream, in it&#x27;s lightest shade, has worked really well for my skin tone.</li>
      <li>and sometimes it&#x27;s affordable and sometimes not so much.</li>
      <li>/&gt;-may be too moisturizing for people with very oily skin</li>
      <li>The product arrived right on time, no trouble at all in shipping.</li>
      <li>So I often find myself mixing it with other creams to achieve a better texture.</li>
      <li>If you are a very fair skinned individual who knows the frustrations of trying every &amp;#34;Ivory&amp;#34; foundation out there that is way too dark, orange or pink for your skin, this is the product you&#x27;ve been hoping to find.  </li>
      <li>I found it does help if you set it with a light dusting of loose powder.</li>
      <li>High performance bb cream.</li>
      <li>I can only use it during the winter because of the color and have to mix it with moisturizer to get clean, natural coverage.</li>
      <li>I heard so many good things about this product, but I was a tad disappointed.</li>
      <li>It is so pearlescent and pale and I love</li>
      <li>I wish more BB creams would manufacture something as pale as MISSHA 13</li>
      <li>This is very good for people who find it hard to match makeup to their pale skin.</li>
      <li>Over all if I dot it and blend it really well its sheer and brightens my complexion but too much can be ghostly</li>
      <li>My skin is very sensitive too, and this does not make me break out.</li>
      <li>After reading up on different BB creams I decided to try Missha because of all the positive feedback.  </li>
      <li>If you are a match to these, or darker, you are not pale enough for #13, so steer clear!</li>
      <li>For me it has medium coverage-a light application softens my freckles but doesn&#x27;t block them out completely-and acts as a good base for my other makeup, which now stays on much longer.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I have been searching for years for something that would match my pale skin (I live in the US and even the lightest shade of most makeup is too dark for me) and</li>
      <li>It was also really dry would make my skin look really flaky if I didn&#x27;t exfoliate and moisturize before.</li>
      <li>Light enough for my pale skin, and arrived well packaged and on time.</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t worry, it oxidizes and that initial white/cream look fades away to a natural look.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve completely stopped using foundation and concealer; I only use the BB cream.</li>
      <li>This is the second BB I&#x27;ve tried (used to use the Skin 79 hot pink)</li>
      <li>I use Clean &amp; Clear Morning Burst Hydrating Gel Moisturizer, and then apply a little (you only need a small amount) of this BB cream with my Real Techniques Miracle Complexion Sponge.</li>
      <li>I always buy the lightest BB cream since I&#x27;m pretty darn pale but this one washed me out and made me a bit ghost-like.</li>
      <li>Use less than you think you need because you will end up looking really make-upy</li>
      <li>and I am a pretty pale Asian.</li>
      <li>I have to put on a thin layer of powder over it to smooth my face (which actually might be what you are supposed to do o.O)</li>
      <li>I normally like to use Skin79 Green label (It&#x27;s a bit paler than this bbcream and it has a very neutral tone, not too pink or yellow.)</li>

<li> only downside is that because it is such a creamy formula, it takes a few minutes to dry and</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> It is frustrating to me that the only BB cream I have found pale enough for my Winter NW-10 skin wears so poorly. It is hard to apply it so that it doesn&#x27;t look caked on. But the color is perfect. So I often find myself mixing it with other creams to achieve a better texture. I wish more BB creams would manufacture something as pale as MISSHA 13 so I could stop buying this.</li>
    <li> My favorite BB cream ever! It fits my skin color perfectly and doesn&#x27;t leave my face looking oily and greasy after a few hours! I&#x27;ve bought this several times and I love it! It doesn&#x27;t break me out or clog my pores either!</li>
    <li> The best BB Cream out there! Jvlogger Mimei recommended this product, and I have to say it&#x27;s quite excellent. It&#x27;s light and pleasing to the skin, but provides nice coverage!</li>
    <li> I heard so many good things about this product, but I was a tad disappointed. It&#x27;s a bit thick and I got the lightest color because I have such fair skin, but that was a bit too white. I can only use it during the winter because of the color and have to mix it with moisturizer to get clean, natural coverage.</li>
    <li> This product matches my extremely pale skin perfectly, and it gives me perfect coverage without looking too cakey. I need to stock up for sure. ^^</li>
    <li> This is my first BB cream purchase and I did a lot of research online before trying one out. While several US name brands are producing BB cream I decided to go with this Korean manufacturer. Korean beauty companies know their BB creams and they&#x27;ve been doing it longer and for a much larger scale customer group than US companies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have fair skin with light freckling across my nose and cheeks. My skin is lightly combination and I&#x27;m just starting to see a wrinkle start at the corner of each eye.  This BB cream, in it&#x27;s lightest shade, has worked really well for my skin tone. I do still use a separate moisturizer before I put this on as I feel it helps me get a more even amount of coverage with the BB cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The BB cream goes on heavy looking because it&#x27;s very thick. Don&#x27;t worry, it oxidizes and that initial white/cream look fades away to a natural look. It offers medium coverage which can be layered up a little for any problem areas. I&#x27;ve completely stopped using foundation and concealer; I only use the BB cream. It lasts all day (8 am to 8 pm no problem) and once it&#x27;s dried it doesn&#x27;t rub off when you blow your nose, like foundation does. I found it does help if you set it with a light dusting of loose powder.</li>
    <li> good bb cream, it has a nice fragrance too, don&#x27;t use too much cause it makes your skin white as ghost</li>
    <li> This is very good for people who find it hard to match makeup to their pale skin. I normally like to use Skin79 Green label (It&#x27;s a bit paler than this bbcream and it has a very neutral tone, not too pink or yellow.) but the price fluctuates a lot and sometimes it&#x27;s affordable and sometimes not so much. Though this Missha cream is a bit darker it does match my skin well when it blends in and it doesn&#x27;t oxidize to a darker color! The fragrance is perfume-y. It&#x27;s pleasant and not overpowering, though if people are extremely sensitive to that sort of thing it may not be for them. I usually apply BB cream with a sponge wedge and it applied very naturally, not streaky. It lasted all day and it still looked very good when I got home, though I&#x27;m not sure how it holds up with sweating yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are always looking at the lightest makeup in brands this should be a good match. (Or if you&#x27;re like me and you have to add a lot of white color corrector to your existing makeup check out Skin79&#x27;s Green Label.)</li>
    <li> Seems a little ashy and makes my skin super oily, but has nice coverage and feels moisturizing. Probably wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
    <li> Over the years I&#x27;ve tried the lightest shade of every foundation and BB cream I&#x27;ve ever come across, and nothing has ever been even close to being light enough. After a while I honestly started to think that maybe foundation in my shade just didn&#x27;t exist. But then I saw some swatches of this online and decided to give it a try. And it&#x27;s a perfect match!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have combination skin, and this BB cream does a great job at controlling the oiliness in my t-zone while also not drying out the rest of my face. My skin is very sensitive too, and this does not make me break out. It provides light to medium coverage, but doesn&#x27;t need a primer. However, I do recommend using a lightweight moisturizer underneath, because it makes the application a LOT smoother and less splotchy (it adheres to the skin better). I use Clean &amp; Clear Morning Burst Hydrating Gel Moisturizer, and then apply a little (you only need a small amount) of this BB cream with my Real Techniques Miracle Complexion Sponge. I let it sink into my skin for a minute, finish it off with some translucent powder, and I&#x27;m done!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS&lt;br /&gt;**Perfect for the ghostliest of pale people&lt;br /&gt;**Only need a little&lt;br /&gt;**Smooth and lightweight&lt;br /&gt;**No annoying smell&lt;br /&gt;**Light to medium coverage&lt;br /&gt;**Buildable&lt;br /&gt;**Great for combination/dry skin&lt;br /&gt;**Contains spf25&lt;br /&gt;**Didn&#x27;t break me out&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS&lt;br /&gt;**Will be too light for most people&lt;br /&gt;**Not for super oily skin&lt;br /&gt;**Needs a minute to settle in</li>
    <li> High performance bb cream. Better in my opinion than the red tube，because it has less harsh ingredients to suited for dry/sensitive/mature skin. Like the skin79 bb, it&#x27;s so natural looking, no one can tell you are wearing a bb cream, yet it covers very well for freckles and fine lines and feels moisturized ! Like it so much!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I regret is that I ordered # 13. It is really pale with a slight pink undertone, and it doesn&#x27;t really oxidize to get darker match my skin. So I can only wear it in winter. Thinking about buying#21 mix the two together. Because I am Nw 15 in Mac, which is in between of #13 and #21 in Missha. Bummer!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it exceeded my expectations. Super happy with this purchase !</li>
    <li> This is lighter than MAC NC15. It is also just a bit lighter than NARS Siberia. If you are a match to these, or darker, you are not pale enough for #13, so steer clear! The Signature BB Cream runs just a tad lighter and more yellow toned than the Perfect Cover BB cream so if you are pink toned, you may have better luck with the Perfect Cover in 13.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;-Moisturizing&lt;br /&gt;-Fair enough for pale skin&lt;br /&gt;-lightweight&lt;br /&gt;-easily applied&lt;br /&gt;-doesn&#x27;t smell&lt;br /&gt;-little goes a long way&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;-may be too moisturizing for people with very oily skin&lt;br /&gt;-runny consistency&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Signature BB can be a little oily for already oily skinned people, however my friends with oily skin seem to have great luck towards oil control by letting the BB absorb into the skin a bit, then applying a good setting powder. Don&#x27;t put this on and immediately don your powder, give it time to set a bit on it&#x27;s own. The same goes for drier skinned gals. The watery consistency can make dispensing this a bit messy if you aren&#x27;t careful, but the application isn&#x27;t difficult at all. It spreads and blends very easily on skin and it&#x27;s very easy to build up to a higher coverage.</li>
    <li> This was far too pale for my skin tone and I am a pretty pale Asian. It was also really dry would make my skin look really flaky if I didn&#x27;t exfoliate and moisturize before. The only way I could use this was if I mixed it with my darker bb cream but the consistency was really runny and overall I was disappointed because I spent more on this than any other bb cream. I would suggest skin79 vip gold. I haven&#x27;t tried any other missha creams but this one was a miss</li>
    <li> Great if you have a neutral to cool skin tone. The color is fantastic, but the texture is a bit off. Goes on a bit dry and turns shiny after an hour or two. Definitely not a long-wearing foundation. If you&#x27;re used to American BB creams this is not that. Those are tinted moisturizers, this is more like a medium-coverage foundation. If you find that most drugstore and even high-end foundations don&#x27;t fit your skintone definitely give this one a try. The reason that I took a star off is the finish.</li>
    <li> The product arrived right on time, no trouble at all in shipping. Absolutely love this BB cream! It&#x27;s so hard finding one light enough for my skin tone, but this matches perfectly. This is the second BB I&#x27;ve tried (used to use the Skin 79 hot pink) but this is my new favorite. I have oily skin and I can get through my day only oil blotting once with this product. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be using a different BB cream for a long time.</li>
    <li> Use less than you think you need because you will end up looking really make-upy..ish. I have to put on a thin layer of powder over it to smooth my face (which actually might be what you are supposed to do o.O) Anyway, I like this one better than skin79 because it stays with my face for hours even though I have a very red complexion but my roommate disagrees. Keep trying till you find a BB cream that matches you!</li>
    <li> After reading up on different BB creams I decided to try Missha because of all the positive feedback.  I&#x27;m glad I did and I plan to try their other formulation.  The #13 goes on slightly grey, I&#x27;m guessing its because of the sunscreen, but that fades within 20-30 seconds to provide a coverage and color that is better than any foundation I have used before- including my Mac foundations.  The feeling wasn&#x27;t any heavier than a foundation (vs. a tinted moisturizer) and on my skin does not looked caked on.  For me it has medium coverage-a light application softens my freckles but doesn&#x27;t block them out completely-and acts as a good base for my other makeup, which now stays on much longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a MAC NW15 (I use NC15 as concealer to counteract tones), the old N1 was and is a little dark- too fair for 90% of the &amp;#34;fair&amp;#34; foundations out there. I have not tried NW13, I have a feeling that I might fall better under that heading if I go back to Mac foundation, (after using Missha&#x27;s BB cream thats unlikely).</li>
    <li> Light enough for my pale skin, and arrived well packaged and on time. Will definitely repurchase.</li>
    <li> This matches my skin sooo perfectly!! I have been searching for years for something that would match my pale skin (I live in the US and even the lightest shade of most makeup is too dark for me) and this is absolutely amazing! I will definitely be buying more!</li>
    <li> I received this along with the Lioele Beyond The Solution BB cream and both products came with a date code of 2012 (most products date codes show expiration, not production) so I was bummed. But since it was never opened I figured the product could still do well. I have Purchased the Missha M Perfect Cover BB cream in #21 which is slightly greyish but once applied it seems to adapt well to my face. Winter is approaching and I get Snow White so I read that #13 was lighter shade than 21, and that ended up being an understatement. It was sooo light I had to mix it with something dark to apply it. I&#x27;m pretty sure it will be too light for winter days as well. I&#x27;m pretty pale, near red head status pale so this was weird that this shade was beyond light beige. Over all if I dot it and blend it really well its sheer and brightens my complexion but too much can be ghostly</li>
    <li> This stuff is crack for my face.  Don&#x27;t buy it all because I need some too!  If you are a very fair skinned individual who knows the frustrations of trying every &amp;#34;Ivory&amp;#34; foundation out there that is way too dark, orange or pink for your skin, this is the product you&#x27;ve been hoping to find.  It&#x27;s quite inexpensive for what you get, has a lot of botanicals in it (Although it isn&#x27;t an all-natural product by far), is very moisturizing and provides great coverage whether you want a more natural or formal look.  It is so pearlescent and pale and I love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downside is that because it is such a creamy formula, it takes a few minutes to dry and (At least for me) requires setting with a translucent powder afterwards (I like to use crushed pearl powder for it&#x27;s colorless and pearlescent quality).  So don&#x27;t touch your face for 5-10 minutes after applying and then set it in the powder of your choice to dry and secure it, and you will be good to go all day long.  This will be my go-to bb cream unless something even better ever comes along.</li>
    <li> Best Bb for pale gals. Won&#x27;t break you out, moisturizes, and looks great on mature skin</li>
    <li> This is not my favorite BB Cream. I keep it at work as my backup since it&#x27;s a little thicker than I like. It goes on well but, like I said, I like BB cream to be thinner. It&#x27;s also a bit too light! I always buy the lightest BB cream since I&#x27;m pretty darn pale but this one washed me out and made me a bit ghost-like. I&#x27;ll stick with some of the others I use.</li>
