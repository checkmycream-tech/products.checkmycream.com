      <li>I liked the recharge/wet-dry/and length adjustment options and Remington is a good name.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried so many trimmers!  </li>
      <li>I had my first one for about 4 or 5 years and it worked great!  </li>
      <li>this is still an amazing product.</li>
      <li>I liked it.</li>
      <li>but the color is nice</li>
      <li>Comes nicely packaged with accessories too.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had mine for two years and liked it</li>
      <li>and it has it&#x27;s own carrier.</li>
      <li>Very easy to use.</li>
      <li>Very good, easy to use and gentle.</li>
      <li>This is just ok.</li>
      <li>Love all the attachments</li>
      <li>This trimmer comes with many attachments.  </li>
      <li>did try it in the shower, and it worked OK.</li>
      <li>Wayyy better than scissors but now want to upgrade to a closer cut.  </li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>I might buy this again now that I was able to find it online.  </li>
      <li>:)   </li>
      <li>Others either are not as effective and pull hair, or are so cheap they break after 1 use (Wahl).  </li>
      <li>Being rechargeable it has much more power and smoothness than the battery operated groomers.</li>
      <li>I used to have one of these exact models, and I used it for YEARs and loved it.</li>
      <li>It is easy to use.</li>
      <li>nose trimmer and a good goatee groomer as well as decent clippers.</li>
      <li>The thing would stop working as soon as I put an attachment on, but when I turned it on with no attachment, it would run fine.</li>
      <li>and I find it just fine.</li>
      <li>I suppose it might work for someone with really fine hair.</li>
      <li>It is also light weight and easy to hold.</li>
      <li>I did like my old one, but this one is just as good and easy to use.</li>
      <li>only drawback is that the battery life isn&#x27;t so great.  </li>
      <li>I brought my Remington Smooth &amp; Silky and let him use it to remove the missed hairs.  </li>
      <li>it is also easy to clean.</li>
      <li>but I&#x27;ve found it even more useful for the peach fuzz on my face.  </li>
      <li>this had been a cheap $4 piece of junk at the discount mart I would have shrugged.</li>
      <li>Loved the first one and was glad I was able to replace it with the same product.</li>
      <li>My original one broke.</li>
      <li>: Lightweight, easy to maintain, holds a charge for weeks, keeps sharp blades for years, great for travel.&lt;br /&gt;Cons</li>
      <li>and they would expect you would be taking it off and on fairly regularly to clean</li>
      <li>If you have coarse hair, this is by far the best.  </li>
      <li>I would go for another product (as I am doing right now!).</li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t say enough good things about it.  </li>
      <li>First it pulls hair really easily</li>
      <li>I wouldn&#x27;t buy again, and will invest in a better brand with better reviews next time around.</li>
      <li>Get it quickly before they change the formula.</li>
      <li>It isn&#x27;t very powerful, doesn&#x27;t cut very well, and always sounds like it&#x27;s about to die, even when I&#x27;ve just taken it off the charger.</li>
      <li>No nicks or pinches - didn&#x27;t try to go super fast though!</li>
      <li>It worked really good for my right eyebrow, but because it doesn&#x27;t allow you to change the angle, it didn&#x27;t work as well for the other eyebrow.</li>
      <li>When it finally died, I was happy to find the same model here.</li>
      <li>My complaints are only that the comb attachments aren&#x27;t as effective as I would like (doesn&#x27;t really lift and separate the hair</li>
      <li>It was exactly what I wanted.</li>
      <li>It is definitely the better</li>
      <li>Practice on your legs or arms first.  </li>
      <li>I broke my first one when I plugged it in an outlet in Thailand without an adapter.  </li>
      <li>So I use the short trimmer to trim my peach fuzz and no one knows the better.  </li>
      <li>if you have some intense grooming to do before a certain time, plan it in stages!  </li>
      <li>I dropped and broke the one I had and was very grateful to get exactly what I broke.</li>
      <li>This is the second Smooth &amp; Silky kit I have bought.  </li>
      <li>It serves it&#x27;s purpose and at a very affordable price.</li>
      <li>Be gentle and take your time when using it on your face.</li>
      <li>very well.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I have not had much luck with battery-powered versions.  </li>
      <li>Shaves gently and closely.  </li>
      <li>Eventually it stopped holding a charge (had it about a year) and the main trimmer head broke.</li>
      <li>I hadn&#x27;t used it in time for the normal 30 day return policy.</li>
      <li>I decided to buy the same one my grandchild has, it&#x27;s small, light, and easy to store away.</li>
      <li>So i bought a new one as soon as I got home.  </li>
      <li>When it stopped holding a charge I bought a new one.  </li>
      <li>I will admit, although this worked perfectly for me when it came to trimming very closely, after a while the internal battery would be so bad</li>
      <li>It didn&#x27;t work very well at all, but I thought it was because of the different voltage etc.</li>
      <li>This sucks for many reasons.</li>
      <li>(the Remington WR5000 is far superior!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>hey, I have gotten this for my fifteen year old grandaugther, who likes it..</li>
      <li>Next bought a Panasonic Epiglide about $45 which i really like.</li>
      <li>Guess another company bites the dust - outsources to save money but loses in the end on the cheap manufacturing with a high retail cost.</li>
      <li>After the first time it ran down (I let it run the whole way down as directions suggest for rechargeable batteries), it never quite worked right again.</li>
      <li>There are higher rated products that are only slightly more expensive.</li>
      <li>I continued to use it and would recharge it when it ran all the way down but eventually after about six months the motor wasn&#x27;t running consistently enough with enough charge to operate smoothly.</li>
      <li>Works well, doesn&#x27;t pull hairs as much as other trimmers but the batter goes pretty fast, but not much of a problem because I&#x27;m not exactly using it for a large area.</li>
      <li>The motor on full recharge would sort of rrr-rrrrrr-rr like a car that had trouble starting.</li>
      <li>If you charge the shaver completely and use it for 2 minutes and then put it up for a day the next day it is not charged at all, you can only use it once immediately after removing it from charger before charging it again.</li>
      <li>No pinching, but as with anything with a blade, risk of a nick is possible and can happen if you&#x27;re not careful.  </li>

<li> They are also really hard to clean, and hair gets trapped in places that you can&#x27;t get to.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have used this trimmer for two years now.  If you have coarse hair, this is by far the best.  The blades on mine are still sharp!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Remington&#x27;s newer model does not have the same bikini trimmer attachment.  The updated version does not work well at all.  I have not had much luck with battery-powered versions.  If you can find one of these, buy it.  It is definitely the better trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: Lightweight, easy to maintain, holds a charge for weeks, keeps sharp blades for years, great for travel.&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Does not work well in the shower.  Don&#x27;t bother with the leg shaver attachment (the Remington WR5000 is far superior!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A previous review stated that the trimmer can pinch.  Yes, it can pierce the skin if you don&#x27;t use caution.  Remember that these are blades meant for cutting hair.  Practice on your legs or arms first.  Be gentle and take your time when using it on your face.</li>
    <li> Doesnt do a good job! You have to go slow or it will pinch. Next bought a Panasonic Epiglide about $45 which i really like.</li>
    <li> I bought this product intending to use it for bikini area maintenance but I&#x27;ve found it even more useful for the peach fuzz on my face.  I break out from EVERYTHING: waxing, threading, &amp; plucking. So I use the short trimmer to trim my peach fuzz and no one knows the better.  I have used it for \\&quot;all sorts\\&quot; of hair maintenance and I find it just fine. No pinching, but as with anything with a blade, risk of a nick is possible and can happen if you&#x27;re not careful.  My complaints are only that the comb attachments aren&#x27;t as effective as I would like (doesn&#x27;t really lift and separate the hair well enough so multiple pass-throughs are necessary) and there aren&#x27;t enough length options (doesn&#x27;t go short enough).    I considered other more expensive groomers but I am very happy with the item. It serves it&#x27;s purpose and at a very affordable price.</li>
    <li> Works well, doesn&#x27;t pull hairs as much as other trimmers but the batter goes pretty fast, but not much of a problem because I&#x27;m not exactly using it for a large area.</li>
    <li> I have this. I bought mine in store from Walmart. I liked it. It is a trimmer, not \\&quot;silky smooth\\&quot;... it works great for trimming bikini area. trimming only though. Close shave was impossible. I have coarse hair. I suppose it might work for someone with really fine hair. but the color is nice i like it because it&#x27;s feminine and comes in a little pouch. It is also light weight and easy to hold. it is also easy to clean. I dont even mind that i cant shave with it since i prefer to trim.  I might buy this again now that I was able to find it online.  :)   My original one broke. I was cleaning it and one of the screws fell out and i can&#x27;t find it.. :(  The price is fair so I won&#x27;t mind spending for it again.   Perfect for trimming but not for close shaves.</li>
    <li> hey, I have gotten this for my fifteen year old grandaugther, who likes it..I decided to buy one since mine gave out after several years of using it.(not the same one)..I decided to buy the same one my grandchild has, it&#x27;s small, light, and easy to store away. it&#x27;s great for traveling. I love it. I did like my old one, but this one is just as good and easy to use. and it has it&#x27;s own carrier.</li>
    <li> This product works great! It has all the attachments you could need! It also holds an excellent charge for grooming!</li>
    <li> DiscountJungle did not send the correct adapters in this kit. The shaver has marks on it like it has been used before. I am so MAD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Returning it TODAY</li>
    <li> I like this.  Some of the blades seem a little scratchy but otherwise does the job.  Love all the attachments</li>
    <li> If you charge the shaver completely and use it for 2 minutes and then put it up for a day the next day it is not charged at all, you can only use it once immediately after removing it from charger before charging it again. Not a good investment at all.</li>
    <li> It was exactly what I wanted. I dropped and broke the one I had and was very grateful to get exactly what I broke.</li>
    <li> I had to return this item. It basically broke before I could even use it. I had a really hard time removing the attachments - which was weird because this was a replacement of the same product I had had with zero problems for like 6 years. The thing would stop working as soon as I put an attachment on, but when I turned it on with no attachment, it would run fine. I&#x27;m thankful the company took it back, cause I hadn&#x27;t used it in time for the normal 30 day return policy.</li>
    <li> Disappointed that I need to keep this plugged in to have it keep a charge.  Overall, it is just &amp;#34;average&amp;#34;...the motor seems to rev up and down during use.  Not too impressed.</li>
    <li> Very good, easy to use and gentle.</li>
    <li> It is easy to use. You can use it wet or dry. It is rechargeable</li>
    <li> This is the second one I bought.  I had my first one for about 4 or 5 years and it worked great!  When it stopped holding a charge I bought a new one.  The current one has maybe been charged 3 or 4 times and has totally died on me. Disappointed with the inconsistency of the product.</li>
    <li> The battery lasted about a couple months before it would no longer hold any charge.</li>
    <li> Great product.  My husband had been having problems with his electric shaver, as it always seemed to miss chin and cheek hairs.  I brought my Remington Smooth &amp; Silky and let him use it to remove the missed hairs.  To make a long story short, I had to order one for him.  My hair is short and tinted, so I use it to trim the salt-and-pepper neck hair that starts to grow out after a haircut.</li>
    <li> This is just ok. It has ripped my skin off multiple times which i cant understand. I stopped using it because of it.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t think an electric razor would draw blood until now.  I  bought this a couple months ago for bikini trimming.  I have tried wet and dry and  both ways were painful.  I thought I would try one last time today and it actually drew blood.  Do not recommend</li>
    <li> Gift; recipient like it</li>
    <li> I bought this a few years ago when I was living abroad. It didn&#x27;t work very well at all, but I thought it was because of the different voltage etc. So I bought another one in the hopes that it would work well in the U.S.  NOPE! It isn&#x27;t very powerful, doesn&#x27;t cut very well, and always sounds like it&#x27;s about to die, even when I&#x27;ve just taken it off the charger. Also, the comb attachments are narrow, with big teeth, so it doesn&#x27;t comb through the hair very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did try it in the shower, and it worked OK. Due to this feature, I gave it 2 stars. But I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it. I&#x27;m going to stick to my husband&#x27;s old Norelco, even though it&#x27;s not very handy. At least it works!</li>
    <li> I have a beard and use this shaver for my neck and shaping around the edges of my my beard instead of a razor. Works well.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve purchased this shaver in the past and was disappointed to see that the company know longer makes it. Compared to 4 other bikini shavers I&#x27;ve tried (and a few beard trimmers as well) this is still an amazing product. However, the cord to charge it is another story...it&#x27;s always the cord that goes on this item- always! I have to tape the cord to the shaver whenever I need to charge it, otherwise it simply wont hold a charge.&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise, this it&#x27;s great! It doesn&#x27;t pull, cut or clog up with little hairs like the other shavers I&#x27;ve used have.</li>
    <li> This shaver is truly everything a woman needs.  Shaves gently and closely.  Combs can be used to shave long hairs.  Shaves one hair or multiples.  Can&#x27;t say enough good things about it.  Get it quickly before they change the formula.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this for about 2 years and was quite please with it.  Wayyy better than scissors but now want to upgrade to a closer cut.  Leaves about 1/4 inch stubbles.</li>
    <li> I will admit, although this worked perfectly for me when it came to trimming very closely, after a while the internal battery would be so bad that even after charging it for a few days it would only last one use. I wouldn&#x27;t buy again, and will invest in a better brand with better reviews next time around.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many trimmers!  This is the only one that I will order.  Others either are not as effective and pull hair, or are so cheap they break after 1 use (Wahl).  This trimmer comes with many attachments.  It does work to trim hair completely off or to just trim it back a little.  I use a combo of attachments for my bikini area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only drawback is that the battery life isn&#x27;t so great.  It stays charged for about 15 min, so if you have some intense grooming to do before a certain time, plan it in stages!  But once you get your situation under control, this trimmer can upkeep no problem.</li>
    <li> This sucks for many reasons. First it pulls hair really easily, it can also cut you (so there are some places that this can&#x27;t go!!). It worked really good for my right eyebrow, but because it doesn&#x27;t allow you to change the angle, it didn&#x27;t work as well for the other eyebrow. It was hard to get them to look even, so I eventually went back to plucking. They are also really hard to clean, and hair gets trapped in places that you can&#x27;t get to. Eventually it stopped holding a charge (had it about a year) and the main trimmer head broke. I can&#x27;t see how though, you can pull them apart and I don&#x27;t see anything that would be causing the issue. There are higher rated products that are only slightly more expensive. I would go for another product (as I am doing right now!).</li>
    <li> I purchased this shaver because I had no intention of ripping hair off in a bikini wax, and regular shaving leaves horrible skin rashes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the shaver, it gets close, but not as close as normal shaving and nowhere near as painful as a bikini wax.&lt;br /&gt;You do have to be careful though. Make certain to press down skin with other hand while shaving and DON&#x27;T shave over hair bumps!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You will regret it!</li>
    <li> I broke my first one when I plugged it in an outlet in Thailand without an adapter.  So i bought a new one as soon as I got home.  I love this razor, best ever!</li>
    <li> Does not work will at all. I had one electric shave that lasted 10 years.  This one justs sits under my sink because it does not work well.</li>
    <li> I used to have one of these exact models, and I used it for YEARs and loved it. When it finally died, I was happy to find the same model here. Unfortunately this one was a dud because I only used it 3 times and it died. This seller wouldn&#x27;t give me my money back or replace it because it was over 30 days since I had bought it. They sold me a defective product and did not stand behind it. DO NOT BUY FROM THIS SELLER.</li>
    <li> Excellent groomer. Very easy to use. I use the small eyebrow attachment to remove unwanted hair from my chin and lip. It works great. I&#x27;ve had mine for two years and liked it so well I bought one for my mother. She loves it. Being rechargeable it has much more power and smoothness than the battery operated groomers. Would recommend!!</li>
    <li> Yeup, I am a man and I ordered this for myself. Why? Because,&lt;br /&gt;Good nose trimmer and a good goatee groomer as well as decent clippers.</li>
    <li> This is the second Smooth &amp; Silky kit I have bought.  Loved the first one and was glad I was able to replace it with the same product.</li>
    <li> I read a lot of different reviews before deciding on this trimmer. I liked the recharge/wet-dry/and length adjustment options and Remington is a good name. Except now. :-( It did a good job upon purchase. Comes nicely packaged with accessories too. No nicks or pinches - didn&#x27;t try to go super fast though! You might have to make a couple of passes for the length you want as another reviewer mentioned but that&#x27;s fine.&lt;br /&gt;Now the downside. After the first time it ran down (I let it run the whole way down as directions suggest for rechargeable batteries), it never quite worked right again. The motor on full recharge would sort of rrr-rrrrrr-rr like a car that had trouble starting. I continued to use it and would recharge it when it ran all the way down but eventually after about six months the motor wasn&#x27;t running consistently enough with enough charge to operate smoothly. And you don&#x27;t want a rr-rr-rr-rrrrrrrrrr-r jump when you are dealing delicate! Also, the plastic length change piece broke after about three uses...and they would expect you would be taking it off and on fairly regularly to clean it.&lt;br /&gt;If this had been a cheap $4 piece of junk at the discount mart I would have shrugged. But it was an expensive shaver from a well known company and I was disappointed in its cheap manufacturing for the price. Guess another company bites the dust - outsources to save money but loses in the end on the cheap manufacturing with a high retail cost. I don&#x27;t want remington&#x27;s execs getting fat on my loss. This shaver takes about three hours wages to buy for me currently and I expected it to last at least a few years.</li>
