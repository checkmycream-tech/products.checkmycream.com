      <li>If you had tonnes and tonnes of stuff on your feet like i did its good for you.</li>

      <li>It&#x27;s like magic!</li>
      <li>I love this stuff!</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t wait to see even better results this time around!</li>
      <li>AMAZING product.  </li>
      <li>so he didnt think this would do much for him, but he is very happy with the results.</li>
      <li>Enjoy!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m using it for the 2nd time so that my feet will be beautiful for my daughter&#x27;s wedding.</li>
      <li>This product was great, it was a lot better than I expected to keep my feet in the provided booties for 90mins, and it took about 4 days for me to notice some peeling.  </li>
      <li>I did some reading about this product and after seeing such great reviews, I was excited to try it.</li>
      <li>So fun!  </li>
      <li>My feet are very gnarly, so they weren&#x27;t totally smooth, but better.  </li>
      <li>A cool experience.</li>
      <li>Item was shipped as promised and I received it quickly.  </li>
      <li>I left them alone for the most part, but lightly buffed them in the shower with a fine pumice stone.</li>
      <li>I plan to make Smile Foot Peeling a quarterly regimen.  </li>
      <li>The only reason I didn&#x27;t give five stars is because the bottom of my soles didn&#x27;t peel as well as I would of liked.</li>
      <li>Place feet in booties (double-lined, so make sure to go directly into inside lining) Soak for a minimum of 1 hour.</li>
      <li>This product was excellent, I really did enjoy it, it did exactly what I expected, and on the fourth day as described on the pack please buy this product without any doubts</li>
      <li>I am totally buying another one :)</li>
      <li>This did exactly what I wanted it to do.</li>
      <li>It worked pretty well.</li>
      <li>I was very unsure about this product at first, but it really did work!  </li>
      <li>Although the peeling process is a bit disturbing to look at, it ends up being worth it because the result produces wonderful, soft feet!</li>
      <li>I like the product, but my feet aren&#x27;t as super soft as I thought they would be.</li>
      <li>cause my feet were capable of grinding metal.</li>
      <li>Gently use a pumice stone or whatever gentle abrasive you have after soaking.</li>
      <li>The product did make my skin peel, but I didn&#x27;t see much, if any improvement.</li>
      <li>tv viewing, remote handy, tablet and phone near by.</li>
      <li>Ok, ok... I get that this is a ridiculous thing to do, but hey, it worked!</li>
      <li>Clean feet without open wounds&lt;</li>
      <li>I had heavy peeling for about 10 days and some minor peeling for almost 2 weeks more before I really felt comfortable wearing sandals.  </li>
      <li>Such a simple way to make a huge difference in the condition of my feet!</li>
      <li>My feet are still in good shape almost 6 weeks later though I do continue to buff them a few times a week.</li>
      <li>your feet really do get soft as baby&#x27;s feet!  </li>
      <li>Right on cue, 5 days later my feet began to peel.</li>
      <li>My feet turned out a lot better than I expected them to, and that includes the callouses on my big toes.</li>
      <li>Rinse and dry new baby feet!!!!</li>
      <li>I would recommend this though if you&#x27;re looking into buying Baby Feet, this will save you money and do the same exact thing.</li>
      <li>Wow!  </li>
      <li>I assumed the product didn&#x27;t work, and got busy with the pumice stone when I got out of the shower.&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
      <li>My feet feel soft</li>
      <li>My feet have never been this soft, not even from a pedicure.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>It took a couple of days for the sloughing, my feet were as soft as a baby&#x27;s butt when done.  </li>
      <li>took nearly 3-4 weeks to be completely done.</li>
      <li>One your feet shed they will be baby soft.</li>
      <li>This was cool and gross, but I&#x27;m weird and love peely skin.</li>
      <li>This product certainly gets rid of dry winter feet!  </li>
      <li>Weird, disgusting, awesome magic!</li>

<li> Weird, disgusting, awesome magic!</li>
<li> It took a full 7 days, the first time, to see any peeling start but on the 8th day while swimming, my dead skin started peeling like crazy.</li>
<li> For the next 3 days my skin felt tight and dry on my feet.</li>
<li> A full week later, my feet hadn&#x27;t peeled and were in DESPERATE need of some attention.</li>
<li> I did it, left the booties on for an hour and a half.</li>
<li> If you get some on your hands wipe them off with wet towel....do not rub</li>
<li> Wet</li>
<li> Using pumice stone on calloused areas assists where several layers of dead skin removal is needed.  </li>
<li> Probably only works for very slightly callused feet.</li>
<li> My feet started peeling like crazy right then!</li>
<li> I made a big mess in my shoes for a few days!  </li>
<li> It will be odd like a sunburn.</li>
<li> Sit for an hour or so with you feet in the little booties, solution inside.  </li>
<li> Since I thought it would start in a few days</li>
<li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this.</li>
<li> It was less expensive than others offering the same product.  </li>
<li> On the 3rd day, I noticed my feet were peeling like crazy.</li>
<li> Sadly this product did nothing for me.</li>
<li> But it is so slow!!!</li>
<li> your feet will look disgusting - like the worst sun burn of your life is just starting to peel.&lt;br</li>
<li> and you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>

    <li> SIx days out and this hasn&#x27;t worked for me yet. I&#x27;ll update if I begin to notice changes.</li>
    <li> It worked pretty well. I will warn you that it will take about five days after you soak your feet for them to start peeling. It will be odd like a sunburn. One your feet shed they will be baby soft. The only reason I didn&#x27;t give five stars is because the bottom of my soles didn&#x27;t peel as well as I would of liked.</li>
    <li> Wow!  This product certainly gets rid of dry winter feet!  I used it as directed and it took about 5 days for my feet to start peeling.  Since I thought it would start in a few days I thought it wasn&#x27;t working so don&#x27;t give up if this happens to you.  After the peeling started I had heavy peeling for about 10 days and some minor peeling for almost 2 weeks more before I really felt comfortable wearing sandals.  Do this about a month before sandal season or vacation and you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> took nearly 3-4 weeks to be completely done. Its good when its done but its sloooooooow. And you camt wear flip flops. Your feet will look disease ridden so be patient. If you had tonnes and tonnes of stuff on your feet like i did its good for you. But it is so slow!!!</li>
    <li> Soaked my feet for 90 minutes, skin sloughing began six days later.  It took a couple of days for the sloughing, my feet were as soft as a baby&#x27;s butt when done.  Using pumice stone on calloused areas assists where several layers of dead skin removal is needed.  I plan to make Smile Foot Peeling a quarterly regimen.  Enjoy!</li>
    <li> Day 8 it started peeling. My feet feel soft</li>
    <li> This did exactly what I wanted it to do. I encountered these while traveling in Korea. Although the peeling process is a bit disturbing to look at, it ends up being worth it because the result produces wonderful, soft feet! It&#x27;s like magic! Weird, disgusting, awesome magic!</li>
    <li> Bought one for myself just to try it out but decided to try it on my dad instead, who has problems with his feet peeling (wont get into the details) and he has tried a lot of lotions etc. so he didnt think this would do much for him, but he is very happy with the results. His feet feel smoother , so will be buying a good chunk more for the family!</li>
    <li> This definitely works! On the 3rd day, I noticed my feet were peeling like crazy. I like the product, but my feet aren&#x27;t as super soft as I thought they would be. Maybe that just requires multiple treatments. I would recommend this though if you&#x27;re looking into buying Baby Feet, this will save you money and do the same exact thing.</li>
    <li> This was cool and gross, but I&#x27;m weird and love peely skin. I did it, left the booties on for an hour and a half. For the next 3 days my skin felt tight and dry on my feet. Then, by day 4, it was skin city. After a week I took a pumice stone to it to get the last of the skin off. I am totally buying another one :)</li>
    <li> good results, perfect for summer sandals</li>
    <li> Ok, ok... I get that this is a ridiculous thing to do, but hey, it worked! My feet were smoother than I have ever seen them and felt great. I did this a couple months ago now, but I think it took about 4-5 days to see any peeling and then probably another 4 days to finish. It did take some time to remove the peeling skin each night, but it was totally painless.</li>
    <li> My daughter and I both tried this. 90 minutes and nothing. I even did a pumice stone like one reviewer said. No peeling even after a week of waiting. Don&#x27;t waste your money on this.</li>
    <li> So fun!  Sit for an hour or so with you feet in the little booties, solution inside.  No smell and feels like water.  Looks like nothing is happening.  One week later I thought I had sand in my sandals, but no, it&#x27;s sloughed off skin!  I made a big mess in my shoes for a few days!  My feet are very gnarly, so they weren&#x27;t totally smooth, but better.  A cool experience.</li>
    <li> your feet really do get soft as baby&#x27;s feet!  just be prepared that your feet will peel (it does not hurt) but will look like you are shedding a layer of skin for a week.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! I have the toughest feet on the planet from going barefoot or wearing flip flops daily since I was a child. I&#x27;m using it for the 2nd time so that my feet will be beautiful for my daughter&#x27;s wedding. It took a full 7 days, the first time, to see any peeling start but on the 8th day while swimming, my dead skin started peeling like crazy. I never even used a pumice. I can&#x27;t wait to see even better results this time around!</li>
    <li> This product was excellent, I really did enjoy it, it did exactly what I expected, and on the fourth day as described on the pack please buy this product without any doubts</li>
    <li> Such a simple way to make a huge difference in the condition of my feet! Now, transitioning my feet from winter to summer is a breeze! So so so happy I tried this!!! I&#x27;ll never be without it in my beauty arsenal!</li>
    <li> Sadly this product did nothing for me. I followed everyone&#x27;s advice about timing and soaking your feet but saw no results!</li>
    <li> This is a very very good foot peeling product, buying couple times already. The result is very good. I will suggest try this product.</li>
    <li> I did some reading about this product and after seeing such great reviews, I was excited to try it. Well, I applied it according to directions. I&#x27;d read somewhere not to moisturize while you were waiting for your feet to peel. A full week later, my feet hadn&#x27;t peeled and were in DESPERATE need of some attention. I assumed the product didn&#x27;t work, and got busy with the pumice stone when I got out of the shower.&lt;br /&gt;Well, that&#x27;s all they needed. My feet started peeling like crazy right then! I did moisturize that night because I couldn&#x27;t stand the feeling of flaking skin. A day later, I used the pumice to get the rest of the skin off. My feet have never been this soft, not even from a pedicure.&lt;br /&gt;I cannot believe how well this works! I think I could&#x27;ve gotten results earlier in the week had I used the pumice some then, but it was good to get it over with in 2 days!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve ordered more for myself, my mom, and my sister!</li>
    <li> I read several reviews and blog posts on this product before finally buying it. I soaked my feet in the solution for about 90 minutes. Right on cue, 5 days later my feet began to peel. I left them alone for the most part, but lightly buffed them in the shower with a fine pumice stone. My feet turned out a lot better than I expected them to, and that includes the callouses on my big toes. My feet are still in good shape almost 6 weeks later though I do continue to buff them a few times a week.</li>
    <li> The product did make my skin peel, but I didn&#x27;t see much, if any improvement. Probably only works for very slightly callused feet.</li>
    <li> I was very unsure about this product at first, but it really did work!  It was less expensive than others offering the same product.  Item was shipped as promised and I received it quickly.  Will buy this product again!!!!</li>
    <li> After seeing the results on several people I decided to try it.  AMAZING product.  The best foot product I have EVER used.&lt;br /&gt;Directions are not in English.&lt;br /&gt;1. Clean feet without open wounds&lt;br /&gt;2.  Set up your sitting station. Water bottle in case you get thirsty, good angle&lt;br /&gt;for tv viewing, remote handy, tablet and phone near by. Wet towel.&lt;br /&gt;3.  Place feet in booties (double-lined, so make sure to go directly into inside lining) Soak for a minimum of 1 hour. I did 1 hr 20 minutes cause my feet were capable of grinding metal. If you get some on your hands wipe them off with wet towel....do not rub eyes!&lt;br /&gt;4. Rinse completely&lt;br /&gt;5.  Wait. Nothing will happen!&lt;br /&gt;6.  5-8 days later (depending on the aridity conditions of your home and outside weather) your feet will look disgusting - like the worst sun burn of your life is just starting to peel.&lt;br /&gt;7.  Soak in hot/warm water for about an hour. Gently use a pumice stone or whatever gentle abrasive you have after soaking. I use it whilst my feet are still in water. Prepare your mind. It will be gross.&lt;br /&gt;8.  Rinse and dry new baby feet!!!!</li>
    <li> This product was great, it was a lot better than I expected to keep my feet in the provided booties for 90mins, and it took about 4 days for me to notice some peeling.  It was gone within another 3 days, although I did use pumice stone in the shower to help the process along.  I will be reordering for myself as well as my mom and sisters!</li>
