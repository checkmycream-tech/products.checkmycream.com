<ol>
      <li>I had the best dental checkup ever!</li>
      <li>Awesome toothpaste.</li>
      <li>and my teeth feel great--</li>
      <li>Great product.  </li>
      <li>My dentist recommended this toothpaste, and since I started using it over a year ago I’ve had great results.  </li>
      <li>I find it a very effective and great product.</li>
      <li>Price is good too.</li>
      <li>We are thrilled with our purchase .</li>
      <li>My favorite toothpaste</li>
      <li>It tastes more like baking soda than anything.</li>
      <li>Product is a favorite for tooth care.</li>
      <li>great quality fast shipment</li>
      <li>I would love it if it had a more breath freshening flavor - peppermint, cinnamon,</li>
      <li>Great for enamel and really makes teeth and mouth feel clean.  </li>
      <li>Everything fine- no problems</li>
      <li>Great for your teeth but not minty enough</li>
      <li>Was pleased to find it at such a good price in a multi-pack</li>
      <li>but my mouth feels clean when I use it</li>
      <li>I have to use mouthwash after brushing to get that clean, fresh breath feeling.</li>
      <li>Unusual taste at first but quickly got to love it.  </li>
      <li>- it leaves a fresh taste in the mouth.  </li>
      <li>Most of the stores carry the teeth whitening version of Complete Care but not the Enamel Strengthening.  </li>
      <li>Still, the formula works fine for my sensitive teeth and leaves them appearing clean and a bit whiter.</li>
      <li>Since changing to this toothpaste (from Colgate), areas in which I had slightly large gaps have all shrunk down to healthy small gaps, which is great!</li>
      <li>This is great and sometimes hard to find the enamel strengthening one.</li>
      <li>At first I wasn&#x27;t sure what was causing it, but finally figured out it was the toothpaste.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this toothpaste consistently for a while</li>
      <li>I guess white teeth are more important than healthy teeth. :-/</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know if it is helping with too much acid in my mouth at night</li>
      <li>A toothpaste that makes you feel like you&#x27;ve really done something with your brushing.</li>
      <li>but perhaps it does a better job of preventing cavities than other toothpastes.  </li>
      <li>tastes decent and doesn&#x27;t cause sensitivity.</li>
      <li>thought I&#x27;d try again (using a new tube).</li>
      <li>I also haven&#x27;t had any cavities since starting using the toothpaste; I can&#x27;t absolutely attribute this to the toothpaste</li>
      <li>This was recommended by my dentist for my sensitive teeth</li>
      <li>Dentist recommends this stuff which actually puts some small bit of enamel back on your teeth rather than the opposite like most whitening toothpastes do....</li>

    <li> This toothpaste cleans my teeth well and seems to have some anti sensitivity properties as well. However, it isn&#x27;t minty enough. It tastes more like baking soda than anything. I would love it if it had a more breath freshening flavor - peppermint, cinnamon, whatever. I have to use mouthwash after brushing to get that clean, fresh breath feeling. Still, the formula works fine for my sensitive teeth and leaves them appearing clean and a bit whiter. Price is good too.</li>
    <li> Everything fine- no problems</li>
    <li> great quality fast shipment</li>
    <li> My dentist recommended this as a toothpaste that reduces the acid in your mouth after a research study he did of different toothpastes. I like the toothpaste. I don&#x27;t know if it is helping with too much acid in my mouth at night but my mouth feels clean when I use it so I will keep using it.</li>
    <li> My favorite toothpaste</li>
    <li> no wasting time running out to the store when you run out of toothpaste...</li>
    <li> My dentist recommended this toothpaste, and since I started using it over a year ago I’ve had great results.  During checkups my dental hygienist does periodontal charting, in which measurements are taken on the gaps between my gums and teeth.  Since changing to this toothpaste (from Colgate), areas in which I had slightly large gaps have all shrunk down to healthy small gaps, which is great!</li>
    <li> Great for your teeth but not minty enough</li>
    <li> I used this toothpaste for about 1.5 years without a problem, but last fall started developing cracking/dryness in the corner of my lips. At first I wasn&#x27;t sure what was causing it, but finally figured out it was the toothpaste.  I stopped using it for about 6 weeks and had no problems, and a few weeks ago thought I&#x27;d try again (using a new tube). Within days, the cracking &amp; dryness came back.  I don&#x27;t know if they changed their formula or whether there are ingredients in the toothpaste that some people just can&#x27;t tolerate.  (Others have reported similar problems for other Arm &amp; Hammer toothpastes in Amazon reviews, including sores under the tongue and swelling in the mouth for a whitening toothpaste).  If you develop these problems, discontinue the toothpaste.  Arm &amp; Hammer needs to warn people about these potential problems on their product which is why they&#x27;re getting only 2 stars. I did like the toothpaste before I had these problems.  (For the first few times I brushed my teeth, the taste of baking soda seemed awful but I stuck with it and eventually came to like the flavor quite a bit - it leaves a fresh taste in the mouth.  I also haven&#x27;t had any cavities since starting using the toothpaste; I can&#x27;t absolutely attribute this to the toothpaste but perhaps it does a better job of preventing cavities than other toothpastes.  Unfortunately, it seems to be irritating my mouth now.)</li>
    <li> Everything was as promised</li>
    <li> This was recommended by my dentist for my sensitive teeth and I have such a hard time finding it!  Was pleased to find it at such a good price in a multi-pack so I don&#x27;t have to worry about it for a bit. Most of the stores carry the teeth whitening version of Complete Care but not the Enamel Strengthening.  I guess white teeth are more important than healthy teeth. :-/</li>
    <li> I have sensitive teeth due to years of using peroxide as a rinse, which has demineralized them. There was a point wherein I could not drink or eat cold things without pain. I&#x27;ve been using this toothpaste consistently for a while and my teeth feel great--no pain when I eat ice cream. It&#x27;s expensive and it takes a while to arrive, but for me it&#x27;s worth it. It works.</li>
    <li> A toothpaste that makes you feel like you&#x27;ve really done something with your brushing. Not just brushed but scraped and washed. Awesome toothpaste.</li>
    <li> This is the only toothpaste my husband will use.&lt;br /&gt;The lack of tarter control is what the dentist ordered. Very difficult to find. We are thrilled with our purchase . Thank you Amazon. Thank you Arm &amp; Hammer.</li>
    <li> Unusual taste at first but quickly got to love it.  Great for enamel and really makes teeth and mouth feel clean.  This is great and sometimes hard to find the enamel strengthening one.</li>
    <li> Hard to find in stores around our area.  Product is a favorite for tooth care.</li>
    <li> Great product.  Works extremely well and doesn&#x27;t leave film in my mouth as my previous product did.  I had the best dental checkup ever!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been in dentistry for 30+yrs and I recommend this Arm &amp; Hammer toothpaste to my patients.  I find it a very effective and great product.</li>
    <li> Dentist recommends this stuff which actually puts some small bit of enamel back on your teeth rather than the opposite like most whitening toothpastes do....tastes decent and doesn&#x27;t cause sensitivity. Hard to find this in stores.</li>
