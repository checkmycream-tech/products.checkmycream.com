      <li>, it&#x27;s wonderful.</li>
      <li>What a wonderful aroma....</li>
      <li>What a wonderful scent!</li>
      <li>I was so happy I found Amazon carrying this</li>
      <li>I use this around the house and it releases a pleasant lavander scent that lasts but is not too overpowering.</li>
      <li>Good buy,,shipping is good,,price is good</li>
      <li>LOVE this!  </li>
      <li>A relaxing and refreshing fragrance!</li>
      <li>I have been looking for a line of products with a nice lavender scent and think I&#x27;ve found it, like the shower gel, body</li>
      <li>smells good, lasts a lot on the skin, does not irritate sensitive skin and also the skin of children, very good</li>
      <li>Nice, refreshing fragrance.  </li>
      <li>Have had many compliments.</li>
      <li>It refreshing afterbath</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s my wife favorite.</li>
      <li>There is an excellent site where you can check the safety of ingredients for personal and cosmetic products, which I used for this review: http://chemicaloftheday.squarespace.com/home/</li>
      <li>most pleased.&lt;br /&gt;In terms of the quality of the product</li>
      <li>Thought I would add this info as so many people do have sensitivities.</li>
      <li>I bought this to use as an aftershave but ended up liking the scent more as a freshener around the house.  </li>
      <li>Yes I do love Lavander smells</li>
      <li>It blends lavender and clary sage which are two of my favorite scents.</li>
      <li>Splashed on after a bath at night helps induce relaxing sleep, but is also refreshing for daytime use.</li>
      <li>I remember buying it in Spain 30 years ago and was so glad to find it available on amazon.</li>
      <li>Finally, it has incredible longevity for a cologne.</li>
      <li>The packaging of the Lavanda was  fine, wrapped with bubble wrap to prevent breakage.</li>
      <li>love it quick response would buy again</li>
      <li>I purchased four bottles for the free delivery.  </li>
      <li>The right price but smells more like it is intended for men.</li>
      <li>It comes in a plain plastic (HUGE) bottle which makes it incredibly affordable.</li>
      <li>I much prefer a fresher, more citrus-y &#x27;mediterranean&#x27; scent, but this one will get some use.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I use it as an after shave or my wife just for a quick freshen up splash</li>
      <li>Quick delivery, product matches description and ease of order.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>The bottle is huge -- just over 11\\&quot; tall -- so it is certainly a bargain, and can be found here on Amazon for around $10.</li>
      <li>Since all the Antonio Puig products are from the Mediterranean region, I imagine the ingredients are relatively fresh.</li>
      <li>The delivery was pretty quick as well.  </li>
      <li>It stays with you pretty much all day and makes you feel  fresh and clean.</li>
      <li>Very light scent...doesn&#x27;t linger long.</li>
      <li>I was hoping for a pure lavender scent.  </li>
      <li>Highly recommend to either gender!</li>
      <li>There is no way to know how fresh these ingredients are, except to say I have sensitive skin and no problems using this product.</li>
      <li>The fragrance fades almost as fast as you apply it.</li>
      <li>At least half of the purchase price of designer fragrances goes towards those beautiful glass bottles!</li>
      <li>I have used this as afterbath splash since I was in high school.  </li>
      <li>Incerdibly natural and very soothing.</li>
      <li>I use lavender soap then top it off with a few splashes of the lavanda,</li>
      <li>These are all &#x27;safe&#x27; for the skin, as long as the original oils were fresh; otherwise, ALL oil extracts can be irritating once they start to oxidize.</li>
      <li>There is a slight lavender scent which comes from linalool, an extracted component of many essential oils.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s in the back of cabinet along with my hi karate &amp; old English...  </li>

    <li> this stuff is horrible  it&#x27;s in the back of cabinet along with my hi karate &amp; old English...  save your money...</li>
    <li> Great splash ! The scent doesnt hang around long  I use it as an after shave or my wife just for a quick freshen up splash</li>
    <li> This is SOAP not cologne!</li>
    <li> LOVE this!  It blends lavender and clary sage which are two of my favorite scents. Splashed on after a bath at night helps induce relaxing sleep, but is also refreshing for daytime use. I sometimes layer it with another scent to add some extra freshness and improved longevity. I&#x27;ve even used it as a starting point for some of the colognes I make myself. It comes in a plain plastic (HUGE) bottle which makes it incredibly affordable. At least half of the purchase price of designer fragrances goes towards those beautiful glass bottles! Finally, it has incredible longevity for a cologne. I&#x27;ve just purchased another bottle, this is something I want on hand all the time. Highly recommend to either gender!</li>
    <li> I use this around the house and it releases a pleasant lavander scent that lasts but is not too overpowering.</li>
    <li> Quick delivery, product matches description and ease of order.&lt;br /&gt;I definitely recommend to my family and friends.</li>
    <li> love it quick response would buy again</li>
    <li> I have been looking for a line of products with a nice lavender scent and think I&#x27;ve found it, like the shower gel, body&lt;br /&gt;milk and cologne- but my bottle of cologne was sealed shut by plastic and had to cut it open, now it wont shut completely.&lt;br /&gt;Good product for price though.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s my wife favorite.</li>
    <li> What a wonderful aroma.... Brings back memories of my travels to my family in Spain and Iberia airlines of course.</li>
    <li> I was hoping for a pure lavender scent.  There is other stuff in it that makes it smell almost evil.</li>
    <li> The right price but smells more like it is intended for men.</li>
    <li> Yes I do love Lavander smells</li>
    <li> Incerdibly natural and very soothing. I like to use it after a shower before I go to bed; Aromatherapy you can wear!</li>
    <li> smells good, lasts a lot on the skin, does not irritate sensitive skin and also the skin of children, very good</li>
    <li> A relaxing and refreshing fragrance!</li>
    <li> I bought this to use as an aftershave but ended up liking the scent more as a freshener around the house.  To me it was a bit harsh as an aftershave.  We put it in a spray bottle and use it to freshen pillows and sheets.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t smell any difference between women&#x27;s and men&#x27;s scents.</li>
    <li> Good buy,,shipping is good,,price is good</li>
    <li> What a wonderful scent! I remember buying it in Spain 30 years ago and was so glad to find it available on amazon. I do find the enormous container hard to handle, so have used a smaller, refillable bottle for every day.</li>
    <li> I have used this as afterbath splash since I was in high school.  I was so happy I found Amazon carrying this product.&lt;br /&gt;It was reasonibly priced.  The packaging of the Lavanda was  fine, wrapped with bubble wrap to prevent breakage. The delivery was pretty quick as well.  I purchased four bottles for the free delivery.  I am on my second order and most pleased.&lt;br /&gt;In terms of the quality of the product, it&#x27;s wonderful. It refreshing afterbath and it is not overpowering in terms of fragrance. It stays with you pretty much all day and makes you feel  fresh and clean. Have had many compliments. I use lavender soap then top it off with a few splashes of the lavanda, just wonderful!</li>
    <li> Nice, refreshing fragrance.  Unfortunately, it does not last.  The fragrance fades almost as fast as you apply it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried several diff lavender colognes, this one is not worth the six dollars. It&#x27;s has a soapy odar. Just don&#x27;t know what I can use this for:(</li>
    <li> No atomizer.  I put some in a spray bottle and spray liberally whenever I want to feel refreshed.  Very light scent...doesn&#x27;t linger long.</li>
    <li> I have no idea if the actual Aqua Lavenda cologne smells anything like this. Yes, this one is a &#x27;splash&#x27; version, but it is by no means a weak scent, so I am quite puzzled by those who write that it is. A small amount of it is sufficient, and splashing it on is definitely too much. The bottle is huge -- just over 11\\&quot; tall -- so it is certainly a bargain, and can be found here on Amazon for around $10. I much prefer a fresher, more citrus-y &#x27;mediterranean&#x27; scent, but this one will get some use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fragrance is rather like some bath powder my grandmother used in the 1950&#x27;s, so do not expect an edgy modern scent. There is a slight lavender scent which comes from linalool, an extracted component of many essential oils. Limonene is the second fragrant ingredient. Other ingredients are also extracts of oils, from tree moss, eugenol (clove oil), etc. These are all &#x27;safe&#x27; for the skin, as long as the original oils were fresh; otherwise, ALL oil extracts can be irritating once they start to oxidize. There is no way to know how fresh these ingredients are, except to say I have sensitive skin and no problems using this product. Thought I would add this info as so many people do have sensitivities. Since all the Antonio Puig products are from the Mediterranean region, I imagine the ingredients are relatively fresh. There is an excellent site where you can check the safety of ingredients for personal and cosmetic products, which I used for this review: http://chemicaloftheday.squarespace.com/home/</li>
