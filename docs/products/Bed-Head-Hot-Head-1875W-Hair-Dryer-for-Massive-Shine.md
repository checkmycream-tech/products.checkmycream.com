<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I used this dryer about two times. I loved that it was lightweight and cute. The teo times I did use it, it worked great! Unfortunately, I only had it for a little under a month then it broke. I was sooo sad. I&#x27;m contemplating repurchasing it. amazon is amazing when it comes to customer service, they refunded my money as soon as I got a tracking number for my return. I&#x27;m thinking about buying a babyliss or maybe a good old conair that my friend recommended. Decision decisions!</li>
    <li> Works really well, and fun colors</li>
    <li> Very cool and sleak design that I expect from Bed Head.  My hair drys quick and the Ions leave it smooth, shiny, and less &#x27;fried&#x27;    AWESOME DRYER!!!</li>
    <li> Amazing!  Great product!</li>
    <li> I read some bad reviews on this hair dryer but so far I have not had any problems with it. I actually love it, cute colors and drys well</li>
    <li> I was very pleased with this dryer.  My daughter had one, so I deceided to go with the same.  It has a lot of power and I am very happy with it.  I received it very quickly!</li>
    <li> I got this hair dryer as a gift for my best friend for Christmas and it arrived in the perfect condition I expected it to be in.</li>
    <li> I love this hair dryer!!! It dry&#x27;s my hair pretty fast and no frizziness either!! And I love the color!  I would buy this hair dryer again and again!!!!</li>
    <li> I need to replace this dryer. I have somewhat fine hair, and this dryer is frying it on the ends. I&#x27;m going to purchase a Revlon tourmaline dryer again. I had one previously, which worked great, but died after a few years of use. Guess I was caught up in how cute this one is. If you have fine hair, stay away.</li>
    <li> Works fine. Cute design. Yellow piece on tip doesn&#x27;t stay on so I threw the piece away.</li>
    <li> My hair still stays frizzy but it does dry a bit faster.</li>
    <li> works great! im pretty picky about everything, but I&#x27;d buy this again and again!</li>
    <li> I love-love- love- this blow dryer!!!  Good price, does a great job!!  I hope it lasts as long as my old one (13 yrs).  :)</li>
    <li> Great dryer makes my hair feel like silk</li>
    <li> ABSOLUTELY LOVE NEW HAIR DRYER!!!&lt;br /&gt;Exactly what I was wanting, my hair is thick and short and this hair dryer is amazing at getting my hair dried quick!!!</li>
    <li> Fast Shipping! Great product! No issues!</li>
    <li> Pleased with packaging and shipping. Pleased with product. Its better than our other brands and love how fast it dries my hair and leaves it less frizzy.</li>
    <li> Does what it&#x27;s supposed to.</li>
    <li> Amazing product, the cool air feature keeps my wife from burning her neck. Best hair dryer she has ever had!!</li>
    <li> This is the best hair dryer I have ever had. I would buy it again, dries my hair quickly. Love it!! I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> As a hairstylist, this blowdryer was a great price and dries my hair very fast. I would strongly reccomend this to any of my friends or clients. The concentrater works great to be able to round brush your hair quickly and efficiently.</li>
    <li> I love my bed head !!!!!!! This hair dryer does what it says,works great. Gets hot. I did notice that it does make my hair shiny. Great find at an awesome price.</li>
    <li> Under-enthused..with this product!  Absolutely NO different than any other blow dryer than I&#x27;ve used in the past 20 years...apparently this IONIC theory is just that...a theory.  I&#x27;m going to drag my old hair dryer back out of the closed &amp; keep on using it, just keep this $26.00 mistake as a back-up...on a scale from 1-10, I rate this a 5. No better, no worse than a standard 1875 watt dryer I would&#x27;ve purchased from a Target/Walmart/Costco...for far less expense...Don&#x27;t fall for this IONIC scam....</li>
    <li> Fun colors, light, and well made! Great dryer! VERY fast shipping!</li>
    <li> Spectacular, light-weight, compact and an outstanding price!  I purchased two!!</li>
    <li> Great Product! I would recommend for anyone. I had no issues with it, and it does it does fight the frizz! have been through so many blowdryers and I have to say this is the best blowdryer I have ever owned.</li>
    <li> Not as big as my last hair dryer. Wanted the same one from Bed Head, that one lasted about 7 years of daily use. But things change. It doesn&#x27;t move as much air, but this one is lighter. Would definitely purchase this again.</li>
    <li> I did not enjoy this product.  It was almost too powerful...yes there is such a thing.  The previous bed head Bh407 model was great, why mess with a good thing.  Returned.</li>
    <li> This is an awesome .dryer. Very powerful for such a small compact device. Dries my long thick hair within ten minutes. It did help to reduce the frizzies and left my hair smooth and shiny.</li>
    <li> This is a good hairdryer, and I particularly like the cold shot of air.  It&#x27;s very powerful -- too powerful for my short curly hair, because it leaves it &#x27;frizzy.&#x27; That&#x27;s where the cold shot of air comes in handy.  Would be ideal for long hair, though.  Well worth the money.  Arrived early, but Amazon always does a great job with delivery.</li>
    <li> Heats great, love the ergonimical style</li>
    <li> This is probably my favorite hair dryer I&#x27;ve ever had. Lots of power and it dries my hair super fast!</li>
    <li> Great hairddryer!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Love the look of this blow dryer. It&#x27;s really girly and looks just like the picture. This was my first time straighten my hair with a blow dryer and a round barrel brush so it was a little difficult, probably because I needed a better brush. But the blow dryer worked well drying my mid length curly hair. I definitely suggest others to buy this! :)</li>
    <li> This hair dryer is extremely affordable, especially when compared to other brand hair dryers of equal ability.  This dryer is easy to use and is great for any female in your life.</li>
    <li> not what i expected make&#x27;s my hair frizzy it supose to prevent the frizzyness  i gave it to my 12 year old daughter</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE Bed Head&#x27;s Turbo Dryer! I have super long (hits at the top of my bum), super thick hair- that is dry and styled within 8-10 minutes. I blow-out my hair everyday and this blow dryer has withstood all of my abuse! I get Brazilian Keratin Treatments every 6 weeks, so my dry time may be a bit faster than that of someone with my same hair type and length who does not- but then again, maybe not- I&#x27;m not perfect at blow drying, so if your really good at it, you&#x27;ll probably be done quicker. I love that it comes with a good diffuser- I&#x27;ve never taken mine off! You can also unscrew the back and clean off the filter, which I have only needed to do once in the year that I&#x27;ve owned it. It has a hook holder, so you can hang it up either when not in use or changing positions. The cord length is fine for me, though I&#x27;ve heard some people saying it&#x27;s too short. There are two speeds- High and Low, and two heat settings- three if you count the cold shot button- which I can absolutely NOT live without! After blowing out my hair to my hearts content, I hold down the cold shot button and target my whole head for about 1 minute and my hair is super glossy, and frizz free!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this blow dryer! I got it to replace a salon dryer I had been using for a while and I love this one a lot more! I have very thick coarse curly hair and this dryer dries my hair quickly and it is very smooth! Best Ive ever had!</li>
    <li> This is the best hair dryer I have ever purchased. It provides tons of power and isn&#x27;t loud. It dries my hair quickly and doesn&#x27;t hsve shutting off issues like other dryers I have used. The bed head brand seems to be experts in their field and make products that work well and hold up well. They last a long time and I have no complaints.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product.. I&#x27;m really happy how my hair takes so little time to dry !</li>
    <li> Extremely happy with my purchase, great product and shipping was fast :)</li>
    <li> Gift for my wife.  Received quickly and just as described</li>
    <li> This is a good hair dryer. I have a lot of hair and this dries my hair very quickly.</li>
    <li> I had a bed head dryer which i used for six + years.  I wore out the plug on it and replaced the 3 years ago.  One day, the replaced plug arc&#x27;d electricity and ruined the dryer.  :(  Because the bed head dryer I purchased was so great, I found this one with similar features as the previous one and purchased.  I used this one for six months and it was awful.  The dryer would over heat the exterior of my hair and not get the hair closer to my head dry.  Tried all different combination settings and it caused horrible frizziness and breakage in my hair - no matter the setting used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In January, I purchased a Hot Tools blow dryer and immediately frizziness went away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do not purchase this dryer because it causes hair damage quickly.  My hair is extremely thick and curly with highlights and length is midway down my back..</li>
    <li> This is my second Bed Head Blow Dryer. I just love it. It is lighter and smaller than my previous one that I had for so many years. My dog ate the cord so I had to get a new one. It blows my long hair dry in less than 10 minutes. Amazon had the best price and with my prime account I had it in 2 days. I highly recommend this model it works fabulously!</li>
    <li> great hair dryer, i love Bed Head products and tools, i&#x27;m very satisfied i&#x27;m going to purchase Bed Head hair curling iron as well:)</li>
    <li> Not worth the money! I have course dry hair and it took forever to dry and it came out frizzy and it is super loud! Do not waste your money!!</li>
    <li> Working great so far!</li>
    <li> The hairdryer had made a strong electric shoot the moment i turned it on, plus i was using it in low tepmreture and it melted the front cover and it was very hot, wont recomend it.</li>
    <li> This was a gift for our daughter who loves the hair dryer.  With LOTS of hair we have been through several dryers in our house but this dryer is of great quality and appears to outlast its competitors.</li>
    <li> It works great and is hot and sassy looking like me ! This is the best I had. Especially for the price</li>
    <li> Very loud and heat escapes the cap... What&#x27;s the purpose ...</li>
    <li> Bought this for the wife why&#x27;ll I was on deployment and she still has it today uses it everyday and I use it on the dog too every weekend lol shhhhhh</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s hot but not burn your hair hot, and powerful.  It&#x27;s definitely worth buying</li>
    <li> I purchased this because I had a hair dryer that was 20 years old.  This works great dries my hair very fast works great.</li>
    <li> This is a nice hair dryer if you don&#x27;t mind the shorter cord. I was looking for a Bed Head dryer, like I used to have, with the professional length cord, but this wasn&#x27;t it.  Oh well, it is still a nice hair dryer for the money.</li>
    <li> I loved this blow dryer. I have had it for 2 months now and its working great. Its very lightweight and powerful.</li>
    <li> I get out of the shower with wet hair, use this and bam! Hair is dry!&lt;br /&gt;Seriously though, I find the hot setting to be too hot. I use the lower heat on high speed and it works great. It dries without frying my hair. I&#x27;ve owned 2 bedhead dryers in the past and this is my least favorite one but it does what it&#x27;s supposed to.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m sorry that I have rate this product 3 stars without trying it out but I would like to share what happened with this item. I received this package today and was really excited about it. When I opened the box I saw at least 4 small bugs crawling around in it. This was enough to make me immediately close the box and bring it outside my house. As for the product, it looks great and as pictured but I didn&#x27;t get a chance to try it because I am sending it back to Amazon tomorrow. I don&#x27;t believe that this pest issue would be from the product so I think it must have happened in the warehouse/packaging stage. I&#x27;m disappointed that I didn&#x27;t get a chance to try this blowdryer but I will not be ordering another one for fear of the same thing happening again.</li>
    <li> I luv this product.. it&#x27;s not only attractive but it does what it said. Makes my hair soft &amp; shinny.</li>
    <li> i had this exact model for like 3 years. my husband bought this for me online bc it was finally dying on me. but this one...idk its not as powerful as my old one. and im literally in the bathroom ten minutes longer trying to get my hair dry.</li>
    <li> This was a good purchase for the money and for what I needed.  I don&#x27;t use a dryer daily so I didn&#x27;t want to spend another $150 for a hairdryer for which I wasn&#x27;t going to use often.  High setting is very hot so I use the medium which is more than hot enough.  A little light weight which isn&#x27;t really a bad thing.  I was used to my old dryer which was a professional, heavier dryer.</li>
    <li> Gets the job done thanks</li>
    <li> I preferred the prior bedhead model over this one as it had a stronger/forceful air flow.. this one works fine though just a bit slower, has same ionizing anti-frizz technology, more compact design, feels cheaper than prior model overall though.</li>
    <li> This dryer leaves my hair shiny and soft, has good variety of settings, and that necessary cool shot of air to set my hair for the day. Highly recommend! Can&#x27;t beat the price point.</li>
    <li> Her old dryer was going out so I bought her this one as a surprise and she loves it!  Uses it every day.</li>
    <li> The item arrived in more then a timely fashion, i was actually more then impressed with the speed of delivery. The item was packaged well &amp;&amp; arrived in perfect condition, the seller left no room for damage to be made to the item on it&#x27;s route. Not only did i get this amazing bed head ionic turbo dryer for a steal on the price but it works equally as well to one you would buy at the salon!!!! i will be purchasing from this seller again</li>
    <li> Great blow dryer. Thanks.</li>
    <li> Product did not work at all. It wouldn&#x27;t even turn on. I thought there was a 90 return policy, but I was incorrect. I guess I&#x27;ve eaten the cost of this. I would not recommend.</li>
    <li> Full size dryer but the lightest weight dryer I have ever used. I LOVE THIS!!!</li>
    <li> I bought this with the matching curling iron and it&#x27;s great! Works great and the color is beautiful. Have had it for 8 months and no issues at all. I use it every day!</li>
    <li> I purchased this as a back up to my more expensive blow drier to give to guests to use or use while traveling. I must say, this works almost as good as my more expensive type. It gets just as hot and keeps my hair shiny and also has the conveniently located cold shot button. It&#x27;s also extremely cute.</li>
    <li> So my previous 1875 watt ionic dryer started making my hair frizzy and finally died on me. I was looking around for a new one and found that my favorite brand in hair products made a cute stylish hair dryer. It doesn&#x27;t just look nice, it works amazing too. I love how it has a setting for hot and warm. I haven&#x27;t had a hair dryer with that option yet. I also really like the switch, rather than a sliding one. I have no complaints and I highly recommend it. It dries quickly and I have no frizzies and my hair looks so much better with this dryer compared to my old Revlon. It&#x27;s great for drying my curlies and works just as well for blowouts, too.</li>
    <li> I bought this item after frying multipule hair dryers . I got it because the price was not bad and it was recommend to me .&lt;br /&gt;I have medium ,fine hair and long hair ,and agree with the review that it frys it . It burns the hair. I use NO hair products in my hair other than shampoo and conditioner , but my hair has a sticky residue with this hair dryer , when I use the travel/work hair dryer it does not get that residue feeling .&lt;br /&gt;The filter is not the easiest to clean but not extreamly hard  just getting the end to snap on and stay is the issue .&lt;br /&gt;The hot on this is HOT and the low is so low that it takes for ever to dry the cool shot is not really cool either . This product is from Tigi which I felt would be good but it has been anything but , trying to contact customer support is impossible . So I am looking at a diffrent dryer altogether . I would NOT recommend this dryer for any one under 16 as it can / WILL burn the neck , and head , heck I dont recommend it for any one for that matter . With it only having 2 settings it is not worth the money !</li>
    <li> Ordered this and it quit working right away.</li>
    <li> Best I&#x27;ve ever bought. I have long thick hair and it only takes about 5-7 minutes to dry with this blow dryer.</li>
    <li> Love it light weight and the cord is the perfect length...dries my hair fast and i do have a good amount of hair</li>
    <li> The worst blow dryer I have ever had! This dryer make more noise than blow hot air. I let my hair partially air dry than blow dried it, and it took forever to dry (between 45min-1hour to completely dry using the blow dryer). That was the longest it ever took for my hair to dry and my hair isn&#x27;t long or very thick , it&#x27;s ear length. It isn&#x27;t a strong blow dryer AT ALL! it gets hot, but that&#x27;s about it! 😒</li>
    <li> Bought this at the end of October and it lasted a whopping 2 months before it popped and died.  Just long enough for me to be unable to return it.  Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> Good heat, no air power.</li>
    <li> Great replacement for my old blowdryer. No need to worry about getting electrocuted anymore. Great looking product.</li>
