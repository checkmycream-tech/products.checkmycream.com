      <li>Like many others, I discovered this product by watching makeup artist (to stars like Kate Winslet)</li>

      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>Love this exfoliant.</li>
      <li>Love it.</li>

      <li>the ones costing over $150 or much more.  </li>
      <li>Also, this was a much better price than the $45 I paid for it at a spa.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a thumbs-up from me :)</li>
      <li>You can also check to see if your salon/spa sells Dermalogica, but be prepared to pay a lot more than what you&#x27;ll find here on Amazon.</li>
      <li>I love</li>
      <li>GREAT PRODUCTS, FAST SERVICE</li>
      <li>Plase make sure you buy genuine DERMALOGICA products.</li>
      <li>It is gentle yet effective and leaves my skin smooth, soft, and feeling great.</li>
      <li>Leaves the skin feeling refreshed and smooth.</li>
      <li>My skin always looks glowing and feels incredibly smooth afterwards.</li>
      <li>It goes on smoothly and you let it stay on your skin for up to 15 minutes and then rinse off.</li>
      <li>Paying almost $40 for products is stickershock to me as much as it is to many of you out there, but it is worth the money.  </li>
      <li>All genuine Dermalogica products have the following:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>So far so good</li>
      <li>Lisa was right, this is a great exfoliant and makes your skin clean, soft and renewed.  </li>
      <li>Using twice a week with just a little blob each time...seems worth it to me :) !!!!!!  </li>
      <li>It has a clean scent--pleasant and mild.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>so it stretches out over many months and can be gentle on the face.  </li>
      <li>It works like a chemical exfoliant (dissolves the dead skin rather scraping it off), and that&#x27;s a great thing for my acne scars and the fine lines.  </li>
      <li>I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for acneic skin, but for other skin types it&#x27;s great.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m 55 but look 40 due to my great skincare program provided by Dermalogica</li>
      <li>but it is mild and eventually settles.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s super mild (</li>
      <li>This product takes care of that because it is not very gritty, goes on smooth and leaves your skin feeling nice.  </li>
      <li>This is a new holy grail, and I will repurchase for many years to come.</li>
      <li>My skin felt very soft after using it, more so than with the scrubs.  </li>
      <li>This is a nice, soft, cream, but I have to say that it certainly doesn&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m exfoliating anything.</li>
      <li>However, my skin is still very prone to periodic breakouts, which is why I&#x27;m constantly looking for a good skincare line.</li>
      <li>Although the results aren&#x27;t long term if you don&#x27;t use other products, it gives your face a nice clean feeling, a good moisture and glow and is done in 10 mins.  </li>
      <li>I purchased this product previously at a spa and really liked how easy this product is to use.  </li>
      <li>This is what you need if you want your skin to feel clear and clean and smooth without using a sandpapery exfoliant.</li>
      <li>She said this is THE AHA mask to go for, and she was right.</li>
      <li>I will keep it for travel since it is so easy to use, but as an exfoliant, I prefer Natural Aqua Gel Cure.</li>
      <li>It is very gently and doesn&#x27;t burn.</li>
      <li>Yeah it is very gentle and doesn&#x27;t work at all.</li>
      <li>35 year old skin looks 25.&lt;br /&gt;bright, smooth, and drinks up my moisturizer afterwards.</li>
      <li>There was a noticeable difference in the feel and look of my skin after the first use.  </li>
      <li>On first use, she did not realise it was a leave-on mask, so she used it as a cleanser.</li>
      <li>started looking at Dermalogica at first because they are Leaping Bunny certified ([...]).</li>
      <li>I m 35 years old, female, sensitive skin, rosacea in first stage, normal-combo skin and this exfoliant works great for me.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Not too aggressive but does exactly what it needs to and exfoliates.  </li>
      <li>I had not used a dermalogica product in a while, so when looking for an exfoliant I decided to try this product, its does exactly what it said it would</li>
      <li>There is some tingling when you first put it on</li>
      <li>I do notice my skin looks pretty good afterwards, and doesn&#x27;t feel dried out, which some exfoliators will do, so this is a good product if you have sensitive or dry skin.</li>
      <li>Really does make my skin feel smooth and soft.  </li>
      <li>My pores are smaller, complexion is clearer and it&#x27;s so easy.  </li>
      <li>I know it&#x27;s a little more price wise than your average exfoliant...</li>
      <li>Does not work very deep, i could get a better exfoliation from a St. Ives scrub, not really worth the price but its ok.</li>
      <li>same as most seals on a new jar of peanut butter or medicine/vitamin bottle</li>
      <li>My friend gave me a fabulous facial, using Dermalogica products, including the gentle cream exfoliant.</li>
      <li>Fast delivery..</li>
      <li>The cream is gentle and leaves the face looking deep-cleansed and refreshed.</li>
      <li>I had a sample of the Gentle Cream Exfoliant and used it once when I ran out of scrub.  </li>
      <li>This product is really gentle.  </li>
      <li>Any real dermalogica product will come with a bar coded seal on the label.</li>
      <li>I read the reviews and bought this dermalogica gentle cream.</li>
      <li>The Dermalogica daily microfoliant is better for sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>I have been trying this cream exfoliant and while it feels good, I&#x27;m not sure whether it actually does anything and whether it is worth the price.</li>
      <li>With continued use, my skin has appeared less blotchy and more uniform.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Do not buy anything from Zap it Deals! This product was old and expired! They took off the expiration date! Any real dermalogica product will come with a bar coded seal on the label. I know it&#x27;s tempting to buy from Amazon because of the price, but you CANNOT DO IT. Trust me! I fell for it too because I love Amazon! But do not buy this from Amazon, go to the salon and get it. I&#x27;ve used dermalogica for a very long time and once I bought from Amazon, my face began to break out like crazy. DO NOT DO IT.</li>
    <li> never used a mask until this one.&lt;br /&gt;LOVE it. leave it on 15 minutes, wash off warm water.&lt;br /&gt;my skin is brand spanking new. once a week i use it.&lt;br /&gt;my 35 year old skin looks 25.&lt;br /&gt;bright, smooth, and drinks up my moisturizer afterwards.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for probably five years now.  I have struggled with acne all my live and using this regularly is a key to keeping my acne under control.  It&#x27;s super mild (a leetle drying-- just use moisturizer after) and get&#x27;s all the impurities out of the way.  My esthetician recommended using this in combo with the Skin Renewal Booster (also Dermalogica) and the combo leaves my face feeling like I just had a facial.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for over 10 years now and I think it&#x27;s one of the best exfoliant masks I&#x27;ve ever used. It is gentle yet effective and leaves my skin smooth, soft, and feeling great. I wouldn&#x27;t dream of using any other exfoliant out there on my face.  The price is reasonable when compared to some of the other things on the market by other big name companies but frankly, those others don&#x27;t perform better than this and I have tried them.. you know the ones I&#x27;m talking about- the ones costing over $150 or much more.  This is still not the cheapest exfoliant out there but it&#x27;s the best I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product previously at a spa and really liked how easy this product is to use.  This product texture was different than the one I bought at the spa.  This one seemed thinner.  It still works just as well, but it seems to take longer to dry.  Despite this difference I will order it again because it&#x27;s a great product and a great price.</li>
    <li> I am a recent Dermalogica convert and I love it. My friend gave me a fabulous facial, using Dermalogica products, including the gentle cream exfoliant. I had a small tube, used it all, and realized that I REALLY needed more. This is what you need if you want your skin to feel clear and clean and smooth without using a sandpapery exfoliant. No more apricot kernels!!</li>
    <li> I have normal/oily skin and used to have terrible acne.  Now I&#x27;m left with a lot of scarring, and typically I use Dermalogica Skin Prep Scrub or Daily Microfoliant on my skin.  I had a sample of the Gentle Cream Exfoliant and used it once when I ran out of scrub.  I love it!  It works like a chemical exfoliant (dissolves the dead skin rather scraping it off), and that&#x27;s a great thing for my acne scars and the fine lines.  My skin felt very soft after using it, more so than with the scrubs.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for acneic skin, but for other skin types it&#x27;s great.</li>
    <li> Does not work very deep, i could get a better exfoliation from a St. Ives scrub, not really worth the price but its ok. Does some superficial exfoliating no tingling and smells nice.</li>
    <li> put it on 2 secs can&#x27;t stand the horrible burning feeling, washed it off right away, then i got red marks all over my face for about 12hrs. just not for me.</li>
    <li> Love this exfoliant. It doesn&#x27;t sting my face or make it red. It goes on smoothly and you let it stay on your skin for up to 15 minutes and then rinse off. My skin always looks glowing and feels incredibly smooth afterwards. I use it twice a week to keep my skin exfoliated and clear.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t get enough of this stuff. When I break out, I use this stuff about 3 times that week and it helps the blemishes fade. I used this on my neck and the lines disappeared, too. Another shout out to Lisa Eldridge!</li>
    <li> This product may work for some, but it irritates my skin and makes it peel for about five days.  I even tried putting it on and leaving it on for only five minutes (instead of the recommended ten) and it made no difference.  I was left with red skin and a face that peeled for most of the week.  Don&#x27;t use if you have sensitive skin.  The Dermalogica daily microfoliant is better for sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> No lotion turns my skin into a sponge like this one.  I could feel it every time.  How odd.</li>
    <li> I read the reviews and bought this dermalogica gentle cream. Yeah it is very gentle and doesn&#x27;t work at all. I won&#x27;t buy this product again and won&#x27;t suggest anyone else. Waste of money, it is expensive and doesn&#x27;t work all. I don&#x27;t understand why it is priced so high when it is not doing its job.</li>
    <li> Lisa was right, this is a great exfoliant and makes your skin clean, soft and renewed.  Will buy again.  I use it 2-3 times a week with great results!  An excellent addition to my routine!</li>
    <li> Staple product of mine.  Not too aggressive but does exactly what it needs to and exfoliates.  I use it once a week and it helps keep my skin healthy and decrease breakouts.  Great for problematic skin.</li>
    <li> I like the Dermalogica line.  Paying almost $40 for products is stickershock to me as much as it is to many of you out there, but it is worth the money.  You don&#x27;t need to use a lot of the product so it stretches out over many months and can be gentle on the face.  I&#x27;m currently suffering from some acne so my dermatologist says I can&#x27;t use any gritty exfoliants on my cheeks, but what do I do for the pores on my nose and forehead?  This product takes care of that because it is not very gritty, goes on smooth and leaves your skin feeling nice.  There is some tingling when you first put it on but it is mild and eventually settles.</li>
    <li> Had to return. Didn&#x27;t work.</li>
    <li> GREAT PRODUCTS, FAST SERVICE</li>
    <li> My skin is dry and acne-prone and recently, I&#x27;ve had trouble with excess sebum and clogged pores. My skin needs a lot of help to exfoliate. I bought this (based on Youtuber and makeup artist Lisa Eldridge&#x27;s recommendation) hoping it would help me exfoliate, eliminate clogged pores, and reduce my acne. I&#x27;m just tired of all those exfoliating scrubs with harsh beads. This sounded like it would be more effective but also gentler.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product is whitish and dries in 10-15 minutes. Sometimes I leave it on 30-40 minutes, hoping for more dramatic results. After removing it, my skin feels softer. I always moisturize afterward because it is rather drying. It has a clean scent--pleasant and mild.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I do think it has helped a little, it doesn&#x27;t have a dramatic effect. My skin feels soft for the rest of the day after I use it, but then it goes back to normal. I wish they made a stronger version of the product that would give me more dramatic exfoliation. Because of the price tag and the not-so-impressive effects, I won&#x27;t be repurchasing this product.</li>
    <li> I could feel the tingle, but this did nothing for my skin. Will stick to less expensive clay-based masks in future.</li>
    <li> I like this as a simple, easy mask (it&#x27;s not messy or difficult to wear around the house), but overall I don&#x27;t see much benefit to my skin. I will keep it for travel since it is so easy to use, but as an exfoliant, I prefer Natural Aqua Gel Cure.</li>
    <li> In my teen years I was plagued by really bad acne. Now that I&#x27;m 24, I no longer have actual clinical \\&quot;acne\\&quot;, which is a relief. However, my skin is still very prone to periodic breakouts, which is why I&#x27;m constantly looking for a good skincare line. Yet most of the anti-breakout products I find in CVS are way too harsh for my skin--the levels of salicylic acid are much too high for my skin. If you&#x27;re a teenager or a woman older than 35, CVS is the perfect place to find good skincare products at great prices. But if you&#x27;re in your 20s and early 30s, there is no product that is really well-balanced for your mature-but-not-too-mature skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started looking at Dermalogica at first because they are Leaping Bunny certified ([...]). This means that they absolutely do not test on animals and are cruelty-free, which is something Clinique and other high-end skincare lines can&#x27;t say. After a bit of research, I decided to take the plunge and plunk down the money for the Clearing Skin Wash, Gentle Cream Exfoliant, and Oil Control Lotion. And I&#x27;m so thankful I did! My skin is noticeably healthier and shine-free, and I haven&#x27;t had a breakout since I started using these products. I still get the occasional pimple around my period, but nothing like the breakouts I was getting before. This exfoliant is my favorite product because it gets rid of all the dead skin without scratching micro-cuts into my face like a gritty exfoliant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before you buy any Dermalogica product, I highly recommend visiting their website ([...]). They have an interactive tool that helps you determine which products are best for your skin, which is how I decided on the three products I purchased. You can also check to see if your salon/spa sells Dermalogica, but be prepared to pay a lot more than what you&#x27;ll find here on Amazon.</li>
    <li> Fast delivery.. NIB working great as described</li>
    <li> I had not used a dermalogica product in a while, so when looking for an exfoliant I decided to try this product, its does exactly what it said it would and I&#x27;m happy about that.</li>
    <li> this was a little stingy at first but went away quickly.  I felt like my face was softer and pores less visible after using it. The star off is because it is expensive, but I suppose you get what you pay for.  I would buy this again!</li>
    <li> All genuine Dermalogica products have the following:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Original grey box with barcode sticker sealing the lid of the box&lt;br /&gt;2. Silver stay-fresh seal on the opening of the tube, same as most seals on a new jar of peanut butter or medicine/vitamin bottle&lt;br /&gt;3. If you are buying a larger size bottle with a pump top there will be a half barcode/ half dermalogica brand name sticker that connects the top of the bottle with the bottom of the lid, proving it has never been open&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These barcode stickers and seals are only put on by the dermalogica company. If your product does not have them YOU ARE GETTING A TAMPERED WITH, EXPIRED, or KNOCK-OFF PRODUCT!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please list the seller who sold the inferior product so we can avoid them! I love a good deal but these products are expensive and I don&#x27;t want anyone to loose their money on a scam.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was going to buy these on amazon and ended up chickening out and paid the extra from a legitimate salon company because I didn&#x27;t want to get screwed over. Now I&#x27;m glad I did as I hope this info will help any ladies who are buying on amazon find the honest sellers and avoid the scammers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**Product Review**&lt;br /&gt;Fabulous exfoliant! You&#x27;ll love it!!!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s different than the exfoliant that I normally use because it&#x27;s more like a mask, since it&#x27;s left on the skin for about 15 minutes.  I have no complaints.</li>
    <li> I have been trying this cream exfoliant and while it feels good, I&#x27;m not sure whether it actually does anything and whether it is worth the price. I think I will do yogurt masks instead - a lot cheaper and 100% lactic acid.</li>
    <li> Great product! I have very sensitive skin and I use this product once or twice a week.</li>
    <li> I use this once a week.  Love it.</li>
    <li> I have had the product for about 2 weeks now and have used it twice, and my skin seems to be a little clearer already. Less huge zits.  It is quite expensive though.</li>
    <li> With old exfoliant I thought, OUCH OUCH FACE BEING SCRUBBED WITH SANDPAPER OUCH.  But with this exfoliant, I feel like I&#x27;m putting silk on my face.  It&#x27;s almost like you&#x27;re putting a facial mask on, you don&#x27;t need to scrub or anything.  Just put a thin layer on your face (which is just a little small blob), leave for about 10-15 mins, then rinse off...and wow, lovely skin!!!!  I know it&#x27;s a little more price wise than your average exfoliant...but then again, this is not your average exfoliant!  Using twice a week with just a little blob each time...seems worth it to me :) !!!!!!  Go for it!</li>
    <li> Great for oily and prone to acne skin. It arrived as announced. Definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> Really does make my skin feel smooth and soft.  I love that is exfoliates without harsh beads or any sort of scrub.  It&#x27;s great, I had no sensitivity to it, no irritations or any reactions.  So far so good but I have only used it about three times so I will be keeping an eye out for results and how my skin feels.  It&#x27;s a thumbs-up from me :)</li>
    <li> This is a nice, soft, cream, but I have to say that it certainly doesn&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m exfoliating anything. I do notice my skin looks pretty good afterwards, and doesn&#x27;t feel dried out, which some exfoliators will do, so this is a good product if you have sensitive or dry skin.</li>
    <li> Will never use anything but Dermalogica.  I&#x27;m 55 but look 40 due to my great skincare program provided by Dermalogica</li>
    <li> I purchased this product and instead I got four sample containters. They didn&#x27;t only look old, but the did not have a sealed box or experation date. Plase make sure you buy genuine DERMALOGICA products. Don&#x27;t make the same mistake I did..</li>
    <li> This product is really gentle.  I have sensitive, easily irritated skin, dehydrated, combination dry during winter and combination oily during summer.  This product works but it&#x27;s not a huge effect.  You will notice a difference but for me, i felt like it only made a small difference.  I honestly feel like peels made a better effect on my skin than this product.  But if you&#x27;re looking for something gentle and have terrible skin like me, this product is not a bad exfoliants.  Best part about it is that it don&#x27;t have granules which can increase irritation on your face.</li>
    <li> I m 35 years old, female, sensitive skin, rosacea in first stage, normal-combo skin and this exfoliant works great for me.&lt;br /&gt;I use it once a week or when I feel my skin feels rough or not smooth anymore.</li>
    <li> Like many others, I discovered this product by watching makeup artist (to stars like Kate Winslet) Lisa Eldridge. She said this is THE AHA mask to go for, and she was right. The results are subtle but noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin feels resurfaced after every use. I try to do it twice per week.  It really refines the texture of my sensitive, combination 32 y/o skin.  This is a new holy grail, and I will repurchase for many years to come. So glad to have found this!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Note: I bought this at my local Ulta store, which is an authorized Dermalogica dealer. Also, Ulta accepts returns w/ receipt if you are not satisfied, so why not try it?)</li>
    <li> its an ok product. doesnt really exfoliate by itself but it definitely loosens your blocked pores. if you use it then use a blackhead tool then it actually accomplishes exfoliation.</li>
    <li> The cream is great for exfoliating! It&#x27;s slightly stings when you first apply but only for a split second. Leaves the skin feeling refreshed and smooth. Do recommend to try.</li>
    <li> This product is wonderful.  There was a noticeable difference in the feel and look of my skin after the first use.  My skin was smoother, looked cleaner and more radiant.  With continued use, my skin has appeared less blotchy and more uniform.  Also, this was a much better price than the $45 I paid for it at a spa.</li>
    <li> I use this exfoliant every day. It helps get rid of the dry flaky skin caused by rentinol products. It is very gently and doesn&#x27;t burn.</li>
    <li> Bought this item on behalf of my friend. She read many good reviews on it and decided to try it out since she had blackheads and whiteheads on her nose. On first use, she did not realise it was a leave-on mask, so she used it as a cleanser. It wasn&#x27;t foamy so she merely spread it over her face and massaged gently (especially at the nose areas). After washing it off,she had a pleasant surprise as the whiteheads were literally cleansed off, while the blackheads were reduced in numbers. The skin felt smoother to touch, and did not feel stripped of moisture. looking forward to the results on the 2nd try when the mask is left on for the 10min as instructed!</li>
    <li> I use this every 3rd day. I love Dermalogica. Since I started using the Exfoliant and the Moisture my skin looks 5 years&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; younger and people have noticed.</li>
    <li> Although the results aren&#x27;t long term if you don&#x27;t use other products, it gives your face a nice clean feeling, a good moisture and glow and is done in 10 mins.  Use this a few times a week and you&#x27;ll feel like you have a face for a commercial!</li>
    <li> The cream is gentle and leaves the face looking deep-cleansed and refreshed. As the instructions note, it might give a slightly burning sensations the first minute you put it on, but this is to be expected and it creates absolutely no other unpleasant effects on my sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I love it. My skin was already adjusted for AHA and BHA.&lt;br /&gt;It is very good and I&#x27;ll keep buying it.</li>
    <li> Good part of my beauty regime!</li>
    <li> I BOUGHT THIS PRODUCT BACK IN EARLY DECEMBER AND I DECIDED THAT I DID NOT WANT THESE PRODUCTS ANYMORE BECAUSE THEY CONTAIN PARABENS.  I EMAILED THIS SELLER, CT BEAUTY, AND THEY STILL HAVE NOT CREDITED ME A REFUND FOR THIS PRODUCT EVEN THOUGH I SENT IT BACK ALMOST 2 MONTHS AGO!</li>
    <li> This product has changed my life.  I usually purchase facial scrubs but no matter what I do the abrasive particles always goes in my eyes.  This is a gentle way to get rid of dead skin and really cleared up my skin.  My pores are smaller, complexion is clearer and it&#x27;s so easy.  Will now try other products of this line.</li>
    <li> If you don&#x27;t want to scrub your face hard with sandy feeling stuff until it&#x27;s raw, this is an excellent alternative.  a thin coat for about an hour or overnight does more and your skin isn&#x27;t raw or dried out.</li>
