      <li>soothing and gentle to the skin.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this seller and product!</li>
      <li>She seems to really like them.</li>
      <li>I used to much prefer Convatec&#x27;s bathing cloths to their competitions&#x27;, but now I&#x27;m re-evaluating.</li>
      <li>If I ever have a need, I will use this product again - as long as it is still available.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s just as described and much more reasonable than those sold in the medical supply stores locally..</li>
      <li>We use them for quick cleaning of the dogs when we don&#x27;t have time for their regular tub grooming.</li>
      <li>Sometimes, there are just days (particularly on weekends) when you need a break from everything, including a shower.</li>
      <li>&quot; and the new just says \\&quot;cleansing\\&quot;.  </li>
      <li>easy to use when a shower is not available.</li>
      <li>When I noticed the difference in thickness, I compared the text on the old packaging with that on the new: the old packaging says \\&quot;bathing and cleansing\\</li>
      <li>These are great, works well without water, not so crazy about the scent; as the other aloe products are not as strong as this one; but they do hold up well; just wish there was a bigger package.  </li>
      <li>Unfortunately showering daily was not always an option and these helped greatly between opportunities.  </li>
      <li>We have to be very cautious about what products are used, because she cannot communicate discomfort properly.  </li>
      <li>If you get wipes with the solid green packaging, those are the better ones.  </li>
      <li>In general, I like Aloe Vesta products</li>
      <li>I am unable to shower every day because of back surgeries and these are quite handy.</li>
      <li>For personal bathing cloths there are simply no other items on the market that come close to the quality.</li>

<li> And, though I don&#x27;t have small children anymore, I think these would be great for moms to have on hand to freshen the little ones after a day in the hot sun or when they&#x27;re sick and don&#x27;t feel up to taking a bath.</li>
<li> They are large and thick.</li>
<li> After a long day, I use them to freshen my feet.</li>
<li> This product has changed in the last 6 months or so -- the wipes are thinner (and therefore hold less liquid) and the scent is stronger.  </li>
<li> The texture isn&#x27;t quite what I expected but they work well.  </li>
<li> Introduced to this item in the hospital a few years ago, i still purchase them on a regular basis.</li>
<li> Not what I expected.</li>
<li> I guess it will work well like the other items I bought and used before.  </li>
<li> These wipes are terrific for those lazy days.</li>
<li> Used other companies like this</li>
<li> One little hint I&#x27;ll pass along, in order to help extend shelf life I used our kitchen vacuum sealer and sealed them in small bags.</li>
<li> My mother in law has Alzheimer&#x27;s and very dry and delicate skin.  </li>
<li> Nothing negative, just not exactly like the ones I had before.</li>
<li> They are pricey but protect delicate skin.</li>
<li> Too expensive for the quality of the cloths, I will not order these again.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I bought these to try because I couldn&#x27;t find the ones I have used for years.  By comparison these are almost as good.and the others.  They do seem to protect my skin as advertised and provide good cleaning.  Nothing negative, just not exactly like the ones I had before.</li>
    <li> They seem to be pretty good.  The texture isn&#x27;t quite what I expected but they work well.  But they work.</li>
    <li> Had opportunity to use Convatec Aloe Vesta Bathing Clothes while hospitalized. I sent these for a family member who is bed-ridden.&lt;br /&gt;Very soothing and gentle to the skin. Makes the care-taker&#x27;s job easier.&lt;br /&gt;Was delivered promptly. They are pricey but protect delicate skin.</li>
    <li> These bathing cloths are great for someone who is bedfast or who is handicapped and has difficulty getting into the shower. They are also great for anyone who wants to freshen up but does not have the time for even a quick shower.</li>
    <li> My mother in law has Alzheimer&#x27;s and very dry and delicate skin.  We have to be very cautious about what products are used, because she cannot communicate discomfort properly.  The cloths are an excellent addition to our small stockpile of prduct that seem to work and do not cause problems.</li>
    <li> I take these in the car and on the plane for a quick clean up for my son. Wipes are good but this is really more like a bath.</li>
    <li> We heard about this when my mom went to the hospital we tried it on my mom  and my older sister really liked it. So I checked Amazon and sure enough they had it and we will be  reordering again.. Thanks</li>
    <li> I bought these for my daughter who was touring the country during the warm summer months.  Unfortunately showering daily was not always an option and these helped greatly between opportunities.  The large size of these cloths is a huge plus. In addition they smell very nice and moisturize the skin.</li>
    <li> Introduced to this item in the hospital a few years ago, i still purchase them on a regular basis. Being handicapped and ill, they are wonderful for those days that you connot shower, or for a quick clean up after meals or accidents.</li>
    <li> I purchased these for personal use when traveling.  I love the Aloe Vesta Foam cleanser and hope this leaves skin just as nice.</li>
    <li> For personal bathing cloths there are simply no other items on the market that come close to the quality. In point of fact, just ONE cloth can effectively make you feel fresh enough to face another day without an actual bath or shower. Also great as the ultimate wipes for extreme digestive problems as well. (Now if only they were flushable!)</li>
    <li> I used these bathing cloths for emergency situations when my father was still with us.  They were great to have with us in case he had an accident that was a little bigger clean up than a general baby wipe could handle.  I also used them to freshen him up when he wasn&#x27;t feeling up to getting into the shower.  If I ever have a need, I will use this product again - as long as it is still available.</li>
    <li> Not what I expected.I will stick with comfort bath. Too expensive for the quality of the cloths, I will not order these again.</li>
    <li> Used these on a missions trip over seas, and they worked great! Very large and smelled good. Will buy again.</li>
    <li> After a hospital stay, I was given several packages of these for home use. Months later, we discovered they work just as well on our big dogs as on humans. We use them for quick cleaning of the dogs when we don&#x27;t have time for their regular tub grooming. After a long day, I use them to freshen my feet. We keep them on hand for ourselves and our animals.</li>
    <li> These are great, works well without water, not so crazy about the scent; as the other aloe products are not as strong as this one; but they do hold up well; just wish there was a bigger package.  Will probably purchase again.</li>
    <li> I purchased these for my Mother-In-Law who has a colostomy.  I thought they would be convenient for her to carry in her purse.  She seems to really like them.</li>
    <li> I purchased these while my mother was in recovery and rehabilitation phase after a spinal cord injury left her semi paralyzed.  These were great to have around when we could not give her a full sponge bath.  The scent is very nice and they clean very well leaving no residue.  They truly are a no rinse product.  I love all of the Aloe Vesta products we have purchased so far.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  I have well water so I sweat rusty sweat.  These clothes help so I no longer have orange spots on my clothing where I sweat.</li>
    <li> I love these cloths. I bought them to have on hand if power went out and I had no water. I have used them otherwise and they are great for freshening up between showers. I will always have some on hand.</li>
    <li> I had not used these until our water was shut off on Christmas Day! They were life savers. They are large and thick.</li>
    <li> This product has changed in the last 6 months or so -- the wipes are thinner (and therefore hold less liquid) and the scent is stronger.  If you get wipes with the solid green packaging, those are the better ones.  When I noticed the difference in thickness, I compared the text on the old packaging with that on the new: the old packaging says \\&quot;bathing and cleansing\\&quot; and the new just says \\&quot;cleansing\\&quot;.  I used to much prefer Convatec&#x27;s bathing cloths to their competitions&#x27;, but now I&#x27;m re-evaluating.</li>
    <li> Never used before but used the no rinse shampoo by the same company. I guess it will work well like the other items I bought and used before.  Used other companies like this but some have stuff in it I did not like on my body.</li>
    <li> lol wasn&#x27;t sure if I would like this or not but purchased it anyway. I sure am glad I did as it worked great for emergency use. Nothing beats a real shower or bath but you do feel somewhat cleaner than you did when using this than you would have without it. I recommend this for those who do travel. Easy and convenient to use.</li>
    <li> easy to use when a shower is not available.</li>
    <li> I am unable to shower every day because of back surgeries and these are quite handy. They can be used to remove make-up or clean any part of your body. I highly recommend this seller and product!</li>
    <li> I bought these to use after hip surgery and was very pleased with them. The cloths are big, have the right amount of soap, and warm easily in the microwave.  I used them in lieu of a bath at first, but now use them after working out or when I need to freshen up, but have no time for a shower.</li>
    <li> The product description does not state this product contains &amp;#34;scent&amp;#34;, it does.  Had I known this, I would not have ordered.  In general, I like Aloe Vesta products, however, this is not one of them.</li>
    <li> I WOULD RECOMMED THIS PRODUCT TO EVERYONE, FOR THE TIMES YOU NEED A QUICK FRESHEN UP, THEY WORK GREAT. AWESOME</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s just as described and much more reasonable than those sold in the medical supply stores locally..Nothing else to be said.</li>
    <li> The Red Cross (and DHS) recommend that everyone keep a 72 hr Emergency kit on hand in case of disasters (If you went through Hurricane are reading this you know how prudent that advice is).  I purchased several of these to keep in our family&#x27;s kit as well as to take with us on our tent camping trips.  After opening one to check it out, I am quite pleased with my purchase. One little hint I&#x27;ll pass along, in order to help extend shelf life I used our kitchen vacuum sealer and sealed them in small bags.</li>
    <li> These are great for when you have an injury or medical procedure that you can&#x27;t get wet in bath or shower.  My husband has had 3 surgeries that prevented showering.  These cloths were a great alternative to clean his body.</li>
    <li> Sometimes, there are just days (particularly on weekends) when you need a break from everything, including a shower. These wipes are terrific for those lazy days. You feel as clean and fresh as you do after a real shower. And, though I don&#x27;t have small children anymore, I think these would be great for moms to have on hand to freshen the little ones after a day in the hot sun or when they&#x27;re sick and don&#x27;t feel up to taking a bath.</li>
