      <li>Thanks!</li>

      <li>While this is a great product, I am only giving 3 stars because cleaning up exploded lotion is not a fun way to prepare for the holidays.</li>
      <li>Yesterday my wife was getting ready and as I walked by the bathroom</li>
      <li>Fast shipping.</li>
      <li>It is still available in my store but only in a cream type.  </li>

      <li>I love the feel on my skin and how it keeps me moist and not dried up like a dead fish.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not super strong and it&#x27;s not offensive -</li>
      <li>I will definitely reorder this product as long as it is available.</li>
      <li>My wife and I would go out on the town and on numerous occasions I would notice a stench of body older and would ask if she smelled it as well.</li>

<li> It smells as expected.</li>
<li> but I do wear other fragrances as well.  </li>
<li> I paid 40% less then retail...</li>
<li> has been about the only one I&#x27;ve found that helps w/ the red bumps, and isn&#x27;t expensive like the lotions that are formulated specifically for KP.</li>
<li> Saved a few bucks too, and now I am a &amp;#34;hero&amp;#34; (for a while).</li>
<li> I have been using this product for a number of years, and my local Victoria Secret store has discontinued this lotion.  </li>
<li> The only thing I was disappointed in was I thought I was getting the same product that was advertised.</li>
<li> It was less expensive than buying it even at Vic Secrets, the store.  </li>
<li> MUCH less expensive than buying it it online anywhere else.  </li>
<li> As far as the product, it absolutely stinks!!</li>
<li> don&#x27;t get me wrong</li>
<li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with this one!</li>
<li> It&#x27;s nasty and hard to be around.</li>
<li> and I wasn&#x27;t disappointed at all.</li>

    <li> The first time I smelled Heavenly was at the mall as I passed by the store. It was years ago when this fragrance was brand new. I normally don&#x27;t allow myself to be hassled and sprayed by salespeople but when I smelled this one...I had to try it. Been hooked ever since!! It&#x27;s all I wear and I get compliments every day from men and women alike. This is the first time I decided to buy off the internet and I wasn&#x27;t disappointed at all. I paid 40% less then retail...the product arrived within a few days and was in perfect condition. I&#x27;ll probably never buy retail again. Thanks!</li>
    <li> Fast shipping. I have always loved this lotion and never understood why Victoria Secrets discontinued it. It smells as expected.</li>

    <li> I am happy with my products. All came on time.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff!! I have Keratosis Pilaris on the back of my arms &amp; this lotion has been about the only one I&#x27;ve found that helps w/ the red bumps, and isn&#x27;t expensive like the lotions that are formulated specifically for KP.</li>
    <li> This smells just like the one that I bought at Victoria&#x27;s Secret for a much higher price. I love it and so does my husband......</li>
    <li> Now she is a heavenly smelling dream angel.</li>
    <li> I love this lotion. It smellds great and doesn&#x27;t giv e that sticky feeling. I would reccomend this product to everyone</li>
    <li> I really do enjoy this product it smells wonderful and softens my skin so silky it makes me feel feminine and sexy and the smell is to die for I love it &amp;#34; and I would deffinately tell my family and friends about this product&amp;#34;!</li>
    <li> The Victoria&#x27;s Secret Dream Angels Heavenly lotion is one of my mothers favorite, so for Christmas I have bought this for her. Today I received the lotion and I am so glad that I opened the package instead of just wrapping it. The lotion was leaking out of the bottle and had smeared all over the the packaging... While this is a great product, I am only giving 3 stars because cleaning up exploded lotion is not a fun way to prepare for the holidays.</li>
    <li> Smells AMAZING!! It said it would take 3 weeks to be delivered and it came the following week-I was so shocked and happy when I recieved it today!! Will be ordering again when I run out! Did not come with box if your looking to give as a gift</li>
    <li> My wife likes it! It is actually not 8.4 oz in size. something like 5 or 6 oz only</li>
    <li> I used to buy this product years ago from Victoria Secrets. I love the scent. The delivery was very fast. The only thing I was disappointed in was I thought I was getting the same product that was advertised. Meaning in a bottle instead of a tube.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping! Great smelling lotion!</li>
    <li> This I have been wearing for 11 years now one of the first fragrance my husband gave me when we were dating it is definitely in my top 5 !!!!</li>
    <li> My wife loves this lotion and so I wanted to get her some from Amazon. She was worried it might be a &amp;#34;knock off&amp;#34; but it is the real deal, and wifey is very satisfied with the purchase. Saved a few bucks too, and now I am a &amp;#34;hero&amp;#34; (for a while).</li>
    <li> This is my favorite scent. It is so light and clean. The lotion goes on silky, and the scent stays for hours. Love, love, love!</li>
    <li> Love it smell very good</li>
    <li> This was a gift and came in a very nice large bottle.</li>
    <li> Timely arrival. Good price.</li>
    <li> This is by far THE most intoxicating, wonderful, fresh fragrance!  I&#x27;ve worn it for years - but I do wear other fragrances as well.  This, however, is the fragrance I get the most compliments on!  It&#x27;s not super strong and it&#x27;s not offensive - it&#x27;s light &amp; fresh &amp; clean and HEAVENLY!  I haven&#x27;t met one person (male or female) who hasn&#x27;t smelled this and loved it.  Some of my guy friends have even purchased this for their wives and the feedback I&#x27;ve heard from their wives has been 100% positive as well.  You can&#x27;t go wrong with this one!</li>
    <li> Excelente la mercanc&amp;iacute;a&lt;br /&gt;Llego en buen estado&lt;br /&gt;Llego a tiempo la mercanc&amp;iacute;a&lt;br /&gt;Recomiendo a este comprador&lt;br /&gt;Estoy muy contento con mi producto...</li>
    <li> Wife loves it what more can I say.  So I am happy.  Smells great doesn&#x27;t stain her clothing, even my kids like the smell.</li>
    <li> My favvvvooorrrriiitttteee!</li>
    <li> I am giving a star for not having problems with the process. As far as the product, it absolutely stinks!! My wife and I would go out on the town and on numerous occasions I would notice a stench of body older and would ask if she smelled it as well. I blew it off as stinky people in public. Yesterday my wife was getting ready and as I walked by the bathroom I smelled the &amp;#34;body older again&amp;#34;. It was this product. Please don&#x27;t fool people and tell them it smells good. It&#x27;s nasty and hard to be around.</li>
    <li> great price and fast delivery</li>
    <li> I love the feel on my skin and how it keeps me moist and not dried up like a dead fish.</li>
