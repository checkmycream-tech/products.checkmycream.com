      <li>I have used this moisturizer for several years and I love it, it makes my skin soft and smooth., but I understand this product is no longer available.</li>
      <li>and it came very fast.</li>
      <li>Shipped quick and the product was new &amp; fresh.</li>
      <li>Keeps your face soft and free of wrinkles</li>
      <li>I have tried so many facial creams/lotions.  </li>

      <li>Positively</li>
      <li>I use this daily and it worked out just fine.</li>
      <li>Thanks to the purveyor for working the &#x27;kinks&#x27; out of some challenges with billing.  </li>

      <li>Thanks</li>
      <li>I know that there are other products with more of this and that, but the bottom line is, if it works why change.</li>
      <li>now that I am older</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s the only facial moisturizer she has been able to use in years that doesn&#x27;t break her face out.</li>

      <li>and she said the product was over 4 years old.</li>
      <li>I have sensitive skin</li>
      <li>NO ONE BELIEVES I AM AS OLD</li>
      <li>/&gt;This does not have SPF, but I live in a temperate rain forest, so that&#x27;s not a big concern.</li>
      <li>found other products useful in the winter, especially the Aveeno</li>
      <li>This one is light enough to soak in yet it&#x27;s not so thick that you feel like you have something on your face.</li>

    <li> My local Mary Kay representative told me it is illegal to sell Mary Kay products online. I had a horrible reaction to the Extra Emolient Cream and had to go to the hospital.
