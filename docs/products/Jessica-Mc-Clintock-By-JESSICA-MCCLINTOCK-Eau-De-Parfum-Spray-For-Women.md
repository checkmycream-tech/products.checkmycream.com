<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> My favorite fragrance ever.</li>
    <li> Great fragrance, great price.</li>
    <li> It was a gift for my daughter.  She liked it.  She uses this perfume exclusively. what more can we say</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Jessica McClintock perfume for years and I love it.  No reason to pay over $60 anymore when you can get this at such a great price.  I&#x27;ve never noticed a difference in the fragrance at all.  Just the same as the dept store!</li>
    <li> My favorite and am happy to be able to purchase here on Amazon.</li>
    <li> My wife loves it and so do I. Not much else to say. Freedom: this nation was founded on God, guns, and guts.</li>
    <li> I won&#x27;t buy this  again because this product seems less fragrant than the bottles I have purchased in the department stores.</li>
    <li> This fragrance is my signature fragrance and I really dislike going to the mall to purchase it.  Getting it on Amazon is easy.  The fragrance is light and soft.  It goes with everything and I feel so good when I wear it!</li>
    <li> I fell in love with this perfume when I opened the box . the bottle was beautiful.any lady would be glad to receive  this..</li>
    <li> My very favorite parfum of about 30 years, getting harder to find and there is no way I can do without it!  I always get compliments and always have.  Love it!!!</li>
    <li> This perfume has a natural flower-like scent that is always fresh and pleasant.  I bought it for my wife and every once in a while feel tempted to put it on...</li>
    <li> In the store it is double the price. I love it</li>
    <li> Awesome product..will order it again..</li>
    <li> Diorissimo has always been my default summer fragrance, but I&#x27;m down to the last quarter inch in my last bottle.  It is, alas, discontinued.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jessica McClintock&#x27;s signature fragrance is very close, and may even be better.  It&#x27;s a white flower fragrance, from gardenia to orange blossom to lily, but with green notes that keep it from being too sweet or cloying.  It&#x27;s light but lasts. My husband even likes it, and he hates overpowering perfumes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price on Amazon is a steal.</li>
    <li> Is a nice summer fragrance.  Not sweet but nice and fresh.  If colognes tend to turn sweet on you, you will probably like this one alot.  I usually prefer a sweeter fragrance but this one is still nice.</li>
    <li> The product was delivered well in advance of stated time frame and came safely packaged.  More return purchaces in the future.</li>
    <li> I bought this fragrance for my wife as it is one of her favorites and one of mine.  It is a great fragrance and buying it on Amazon is a great deal.</li>
    <li> Love it!! Its the only perfume I wear!! I get lots of compliments!!</li>
    <li> LOVE this perfume! Smells fresh and clean. I wear it every day! :)</li>
    <li> I am so upset....for years I used Jessica McClintock REAL PERFUME  It was about $70 but lasted for ever.  Now all I see advertised is the cologn stuff.  The stores have stopped selling the REAL perfume, even Macy&#x27;s.  If anyone can help, my EMail is : CHICAGO@STI.NET</li>
    <li> One of my favorites.  I put it on often.  I love the scent.</li>
    <li> Jessica McClintock is probably  the most wonderful smell, there is.&lt;br /&gt;There is not a woman that won&#x27;t get comments, when wearing Jessica.&lt;br /&gt;It is not to heavy, not sick sweet, but is sooooooo smothe....you will&lt;br /&gt;love it and the people you are around will love you.</li>
    <li> Great smelling that&#x27;s not overpowering</li>
    <li> This has an earthy/spicy smell to me....no flowers, yay! I love it. Bonus, my husband loves the smell on me also!</li>
    <li> Bought this as a present for the wife. Very nice perfume and the price is almost half of retail stores.</li>
    <li> This was a gift she loves it.  Would buy again, smells great.</li>
    <li> Was soo excited to find my all time favorite but truth be told, don&#x27;t remember the scent being as it is now.  Kinda disappointed.</li>
    <li> This is an imitation.  Smells nothing like genuine Jessica McClintock. I normally get my JM at Nordstrom Rack, which is authentic. When you compare manufacturers of the two perfumes, they are totally different ans shouldnt be.  I complained to amazon and they kindly refunded my money.  Be careful.</li>
    <li> I bought this perfume because I liked how it smelled on someone else.  However, I have to say that I was really dissappointed when I used it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Firstly, I found that I had to spray a lot of it to really be able to smell the frangrance.  Then, I realized that I did not like how it smelled on me.  It seemed to have a chemical scent on my own skin.  I wish I would have gotten a tester of it before deciding to buy 3.4 oz worth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do have to have to say that I gave it to 2 stars only because I happened to like how it smelled on someone else.  So, I would not discount it completely.  I would encourage you to make sure it smells good on you personally before choosing to purchase this perfume.</li>
    <li> Great service...Love it !</li>
    <li> My daughter introduced me to this scent-Jessica McClintock.It is lovely,feminine, long lasting, not over powering but you know you&#x27;re wearing \\&quot;perfume\\&quot; for hours and hours.</li>
    <li> I love this scent. It is soooo fresh and clean and smells like fresh flowers with a bit o&#x27; citrus. And this delightful scent lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for many years.  It is the only fragrance that I use.  I was devastated when a clerk told me at the dept store I usually purchase it said they no longer make that fragrance.  So I went to \\&quot;Amazon\\&quot;.  Not only did I find the product but it was 1/2 the price I was paying for it at the department store!  I love Jessica McClintock.  I love Amazon.</li>
    <li> It met every expectation.</li>
    <li> excellent product. only thing my wife will wear</li>
    <li> i ordered and received (on the day expected) my jessica mcclintock cologne.  it was so easy, no complaints, and at a great price. it was exactly as described.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with my purchase. It was delivered exactly as described. I will reorder.</li>
    <li> My boyfriend loved the flowery scent on me, was enough to keep him hooked!&lt;br /&gt;I like it&#x27;s staying power and for making me feel like a beautiful lady!&lt;br /&gt;Great for the price!</li>
    <li> OH MY!!! How wonderful. I love this scent and it is not available in my small town. Thanks Amazon  love my prime membership.</li>
    <li> I wore this perfume for years, and then could not find it in any local stores.  Finally searched online.  Amazon had the absolute best price.  My cousin has now ordered it as well - from Amazon.  People ALWAYS comment positively when I wear it - and most know it by name!</li>
    <li> I am thrilled with this product.  The bottle size and price are an exceptional buy.  I think they make a body lotion and other items of this product line - I will definitely purchase again !</li>
    <li> My order was delivered in a very timely manner and was in tip top shape when it arrived. I have always loved the scent of Jessica Mcclintock and look forward to using this Eau De Parfum. Thank you Amazon!</li>
    <li> Best value anywhere for this product. My order was received in less than a week after ordering.</li>
    <li> Unless you like to smell like lemon pledge---don&#x27;t buy it</li>
    <li> I was looking for a gardenia scent. This has it BUT, I had to spray it in the air and walk through it. This kept it light and fresh..When I first got it I sprayed it on my skin..big mistake for me. All things considered I have to say I like it. I did purchase this item from Amazon. Good price.</li>
    <li> Very happy with this purchase. I got it quickly and a great price</li>
    <li> jessica  Mcclintock is always perfect</li>
    <li> First bottle I purchased did not hold its fragrance for very long.  Amazon replaced it but it&#x27;s not much better.  Probably old inventory bottles.  Should have known better since the retail on this size bottle is $68 and I got it for $25.  You get what you pay for!</li>
    <li> I order this fragrance probably 2 times a year.  Have tried others but always go back to this classic.  Everywhere I go, people stop me to ask what fragrance I am wearing.  It is so light and fresh...perfect year round but especially great in the spring/summer.  Can&#x27;t go wrong with this one!</li>
    <li> Love this JM fragrance, but have trouble finding it in a real store. Wonderful floral with a slight, bright fruitiness. Not heavy, but youthful and with that \\&quot;Gunisax\\&quot; flavor. Distinctive and different from so many \\&quot;big Name\\&quot; fragrances. I can always pick it out when I encounter it in public. Hope they don&#x27;t stop making it.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s been many years I had been using this fragrance. But with time I have felt its not the same as it used to be. I donor understand the reason. I think the overall quality is declined.</li>
    <li> My mom&#x27;s favorite.  Good price.</li>
    <li> True story: I was at the checkout at an autoparts store.  I was late 40&#x27;s; the salesperson...maybe 20. As he was ringing up my purchases he looked kind of embarrassed and says \\&quot;I am not hitting on you or anything, but you sure do smell good!\\&quot;  I just had to laugh; he was so polite and sincere. Of course, I said thank you and told him I was wearing \\&quot;Jessica Mcclintock\\&quot; by Jessica Mcclintock. Random, unexpected compliments are always the best, and most sincere. That young man made my day!</li>
    <li> Very Happy with the perfume! The perfume is exactly like the one I had purchased from a department store, but at half the price! Arrived earlier than expected. Will buy from this retailer again!</li>
    <li> This item came on time in good packaging. This fragrance is a one I love. I would like to try a few different ones</li>
    <li> DO NOT BUY ..... the item is NOT what it says.  Sold as Jessica McClintock Eau De Parfum Spray.  I&#x27;ve used this perfume for years and this is a cheap (poor) imitation of Jessica McClintock.  If you purchase you will not be able to return if you are dissatisfied.  It came in an unwrapped box and the smell was horrible.  AGAIN DO NOT BUY........</li>
    <li> received the product promptly. it was good quality for a great value. I will purchase from this seller again in the future. thanks</li>
    <li> Not a good purchase.  I was so disappointed with this purchase.  It smells mostly of alcohol, sort of like an old perfume.  Too bad.</li>
    <li> My husband said this smells so great, so I stupidly bought some without smelling it...what a mistake. To me it smells like a gardenia flower. I do not want to smell like a flower, I only like skin musk. I have a entire bottle, now wondering whom would like it.</li>
    <li> I buy this product for my wife.  In an effort to keep things clean, I really don&#x27;t think I should say anything more than that.</li>
    <li> Been my favorite for many years. Comes nicely packaged. If you like a floral scent that is not too heavy this is it. Scent will last all day and a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> This fragrance never disappoints.</li>
    <li> I received Jessica McClintock bath powder years ago and always enjoyed the fragrance.  I purchased the spray and have been disappointed.  The fragrance is there and it is beautiful, but it has absolutely no staying power.  By the time I get into my car, it is gone.  It doesn&#x27;t even stick to my clothing.  I am very disappointed in this item.  You certainly don&#x27;t have to worry about offending anyone with an overwhelming fragrance because it is gone within 1/2 hour.</li>
    <li> I had this perfume years ago. I wanted to find a gift for my son&#x27;s teacher and came across Jessica Mcclintock. I love this perfume and ordered 2 one for me and one for my son&#x27;s teacher. Happy recieved it yesterday!</li>
    <li> It is my Wife&#x27;s favorite fragrance, and I love to keep her in good supply.  It is a scent of which I never tire.</li>
    <li> This Eau de Parfum is my favorite and only fragrance I have used for over 20 years.  I love the light scent and that it doesn&#x27;t take over the surrounding air like so many heavy perfumes do.</li>
    <li> It was 3xactly what I expected...great job Amazon!!!</li>
    <li> My most favorite scent ever! Hard to find this product in stores anymore, so I was ecstatic when I found I could get it through Amazon at a decent price. Will definitely purchase again. Hope the price stays low.</li>
    <li> Love this  lilies of the valley scent.</li>
    <li> For me this is the MOST beautiful fragrance out there!  Perfect for spring and summer but I now use it year round since MEN even love it! Such a pleasant scent and NOT over powering.  LOVE IT!!!</li>
    <li> My wife loved this scent the first time she sprayed the testor many years ago. It&#x27;s still her favorite and mine too. We hope it will never be discontinued. Try it, you&#x27;ll love it too.</li>
    <li> This is a great cologne.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been in love with this classic scent from Jessica McClintock since I was in college.  It&#x27;s fresh floral scent is not overpowering like a lot of women&#x27;s scents and it&#x27;s a classic beauty that goes well with work and casual days.  I found myself going back to wearing this after many years of just wearing lotions and am quite happy as it brings back lots of memories of happy events and everyone compliments the scent.</li>
    <li> This item arrived with no celephane wrapping as is customary for all high-end parfum.  I will be returning it for that reason.  Also, at first, the aroma is very strong, but in no time it dwindles.  It seems to stay on clothing longer than on the body.  &#x27;Unsure of authenticity.</li>
    <li> Love Jessica McClintock&#x27;s scent.  I was ready to pay around $65 for the same thing at the retail store.  Can&#x27;t believe I found it here for so much less.  I guess it&#x27;s an \\&quot;old\\&quot; scent, maybe that&#x27;s why it is discounted.  Whatever.  It is  w o n d e r f u l.  And at a wonderful price!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my wife because she loves it and I love the way it smells on her. This activates the senses that makes you close your eyes as you inhale the sweet smell. Excellent parfum.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite cologne.  Everytime I wear it, I get compliments.  Men seem to love it.  They always ask me what I&#x27;m wearing.  Amazon is the only way I buy it.  You can&#x27;t touch it in the local department stores for what you can buy it for on Amazon.  I&#x27;ve turned everyone on to buying it this way.  Thank you so much.</li>
    <li> I have loved Jessica for several years and I thought I would give it a whirl on Amazon for the great price.&lt;br /&gt;The perfume I recieved smells nice but a bit chemicalish, almost overwhelmingly so at first.&lt;br /&gt;Will most def pick Jessica up at the beauty counter next time.</li>
    <li> This was a great buy. The price was very reasonable and the product is great. I bought this for my wife and she loves it.</li>
    <li> I have used Jessica McClintock products for some time.  I received this product quickly and in good condition.  It was a great price also.  I would order again.</li>
    <li> This Jessica McClintock fragrance is really one of a kind fragrances and it&#x27;s more of a different kind of fragrance you can use for special occasions rather than for everyday use. I bought this fragrance for my mother and she loves it.</li>
    <li> The first shipment of it did not smell anything like it should - I&#x27;ve ordered it every year for a few years in the row. The Customer service arranged to send me another one; the smell is still very weak, and does not last; but I just felt that I could not complain AGAIN - I will not order it anymore. I suspect that the bottles of this kind are just old, and the parfum loses its scent in time.</li>
    <li> I was very pleased to receive the real thing at such a good price.  Would definitely purchase from this vendor again.</li>
    <li> I am totally pleased with the product. I was afraid it would be a knock off or some how watered down. But, it is just wonderful. Just like from the department stores. Jessica McClintock is a product that stays on your skin for hours. Most men love the smell of this product.</li>
    <li> Just as I expected.  I have used it in the past.</li>
    <li> Great scent girl loves this fragrance</li>
    <li> I have been using this for a few years and now my daughter also loves it.  I alway get people stop me to ask what I&#x27;m wearing as they love the way it smells.</li>
    <li> Jessica McClintock is one of my wife&#x27;s favorite fragrances, and she can no longer find it in stores, so we are very happy that we can get it through Amazon at a very decent price.</li>
    <li> This product was shipped quickly, exactly as advertised and the best price I&#x27;ve found online.  I love this perfume and get compliments on it almost daily.  I&#x27;ll definitely be a return shopper!!!</li>
    <li> My wife likes it and it does have a nice fragrance. I do my best to give her what she likes on Christmas morning.</li>
    <li> I received this as a gift several years ago for my birthday.  When I priced it in department stores, it was much more pricey than I expected.  Amazon&#x27;s price was 50% cheaper than department stores.  Will order through Amazon again.  Floral fragrance....received many compliments on the perfume</li>
    <li> Best bargain for best value ever!! I praise Amazon for making it so affordable for me to use my beloved Jessica so freely becuase it is so darn affordable and the best value ever. Thank you Amazon.</li>
    <li> I guess everyone has to get burned once, this was my time....What I received is nothing more than a bottle of water...VERY DISAPPOINTING!</li>
    <li> Just received my perfume!! It smells so good!! Happy customer..</li>
    <li> I love the floral scent.  So much less expensive than at the store!</li>
    <li> Love this, get compliments all the time</li>
    <li> absolutely my favorite perfume, and the price was right too!  There are no Department stores close by to where I live, so this is a great way to shop, and a very  handy way for me to shop,</li>
    <li> My mother asks for this perfume every year for Christmas. I love it!  However, you need to make sure not to use too much. It is a very strong scent.  Floral- gardinia.  The price here is the best I have seen.</li>
    <li> Love this scent. I&#x27;ve been wearing it for years. It&#x27;s the only perfume that I can still smell on my body and clothes hours after applying it.</li>
    <li> Best smell. Fresh &amp; clean. Many have asked what it was. My favorite!</li>
    <li> I have worn Jessica McClintock cologne for years, and lately I&#x27;ve had some problem finding it and when I did, it was out of my price range.  So when I found it on Amazon, I was very happy to order it as a gift and one for myself.  It arrived on time, was almost half the price I&#x27;d paid before, and the recipient has been very happy with it, as I have always been.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[...]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;Jessica Mcclintock By Jessica Mcclintock For Women. Eau De Parfum Spray 3.4 Oz.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;Jessica Mcclintock; Health and Beauty; $26.45</li>
    <li> my friend bought this perfume not too long ago from amazon (probably from another seller) and the scent spot on, close to what would be bought at the store. i was running out of the perfume so i thought that maybe i&#x27;d get the same thing but i was wrong. the item that i purchased had an awful alcohol scent and WAS NOT ANYTHING REMOTELY CLOSE to the perfume that my friend bought. i am very familiar with its distinct scent as i have been wearing it all through my adulthood so i was very disappointed when the product came in. teaches me a lesson for buying it online rather than from the store.</li>
    <li> What can anyone say about this fragrance except I love this perfume.  I always receive many compliments.  A very feminine and beautifully soft floral.  Long lasting, but not overly potent.  A welcome addition to any fragrance collection. By far one of my favorite scents at a huge savings in comparison to department store prices!</li>
    <li> I have tried many perfumes in many years and some were okay but not satisfying.  With this perfume which I have used for years now, I get many compliments even from strangers.  My grandchildren love my perfume and identify it with me.</li>
    <li> This is my daughter&#x27;s favorite fragrance.  I buy it yearly at Christmas for one of her Christmas presents.  I recommend this fragrance to anyone wanting a nice floral scent.</li>
    <li> Very smooth transaction with no problems whatsoever.  The product was exactly as described and I will be ordering from you in the future.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> I ordered this beca7use this is what my wife wanted for Christmas...She was happy so I was happy... happy, happy, happy</li>
    <li> This is the closest thing I could find as a replacement for my all-time favorite, Christian Dior&#x27;s Diorissimo--now discontinued (and altered from original).  It has most of the same ingredients, especially the Lily of the Valley scent, which is hard to come by.  It is a nice, brisk, crisp fragrance--not cloying--and can be worn day or night.  Men seem to like it, too--just as they liked Diorissimo.  Another similar fragrance is Dana Buchman&#x27;s Luxury.</li>
    <li> Love the scent. Bought more than one since this fragrance has been discontinued.</li>
    <li> Apparently some people have gotten an imitation product but not the from the seller I used - this is the real perfume for a great price - I got a bottle from Macy&#x27;s half the size for twice the price for Christmas so I ordered this to compare and it is exactly the same.</li>
    <li> I just adore the scent!  It&#x27;s feminine without being overpowering, and a little lasts all day... very nice, great choice.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product, exactly what we ordered and wanted.&lt;br /&gt;Great price too.</li>
    <li> Bought this as a gift along with the dusting powder. It really makes a nice gift combo to give. My mom loves it. Smells fine.</li>
    <li> I ordered this for my mom for Christmas.  She hadn&#x27;t been able to find it in the stores anymore.  She lives on a ranch where the nearest mall is 2 hours away.  She was delighted to receive it and asked me where I got it.  I told her you can get anything (well almost!) on Amazon!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my wife.  She likes to wear this fragrance for work and everyday activities. I usually purchase this item at Macy&#x27;s for $75.  So I thought this was a bargain.  That was a big mistake.  My wife was not pleased with the aroma.  She thought that this must be stock that was lost and recently found and that&#x27;s why the price was so CHEAP!  She described it as musty, tired, indefinite, indistinct, obscure, opaque, pale, shadowy, unclear, undefined, undetermined, vague, aged, and unyoung. DO NOT BUY unless you like your Eau De Parfume STALE, FAINT AND OLD!</li>
    <li> Love this fragrance. Lasts all day long.</li>
    <li> Lot more expensive elsewhere  We love the scent and use it a lot</li>
    <li> The cologne was exactly as I ordered and a considerable savings over major store price.  I am very pleased with it.  Delievery was quick and efficient</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the first time a bought this for my wife, she likes it. I like to smell it on her. You should try it for the lady in your life.</li>
    <li> It smells really close to Jessica McClintock, but the real deal lasts FOREVER!  This fades so quickly that I can many times I don&#x27;t even make it into the office with perfume.  I gave it two stars, because quite frankly.....I should have known that the price was too good to be true!</li>
    <li> Great timing on shipping, great quality on the packaging. It was a gift for my mom and she just loves this perfume so it was a successful purchase for us! Keeps us from having to go to the mall for it and the price is always MUCH better here!!</li>
    <li> I have never been to an &amp;#34;English Garden&amp;#34;, but this fragrance would be what I would expect...lilacs, lillies, beautiful. It is so lovely.&lt;br /&gt;Great springtime/summertime fragrance. Soft but lasts. I love it and it&#x27;s at a great price. Walgreens, Boston Store and Macy&#x27;s sell this for at least double what I paid. Love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:  Purchased this again in September 2016 and was greatly disappointed.  There was something off about this fragrance.  I do not know if I was sold an old bottle or a knock-off.  I have worn this fragrance many times over the years and it has never smelled like this bottle.</li>
    <li> Jessica McClintock is the only fragrance I wear and was very pleased to see it offered here for much cheaper than the stores.Although hestitant,I ordered it and recieved the same product that I would have paid twenty dollars more for in the local stores.</li>
    <li> My wife LOVES this stuff....and everyone gives her compliments --- what more could you want!?</li>
    <li> I paid half of what I would have had to pay in a Department store and I cannot tell any differnce in this product than what I usually get at full price. I don&#x27;t think it is a \\&quot; knock-off \\&quot; and I was complimented on its fragrance last week. It&#x27;s a great value !!!!</li>
    <li> The seller represented this product with the wrong item pictured.&lt;br /&gt;I thought I was buy Jessica McClintocks  Always and Forever.&lt;br /&gt;The description was Jessica McClintocks.  The picture threw me!</li>
    <li> My wife loves it - so that is good enough for me.</li>
    <li> What a rip-off!  I ordered the 3.4 oz. parfum.  It&#x27;s the color of water and has no smell.  I&#x27;d swear that someone watered it down.  I&#x27;ve been wearing Jessica MacClintock for years and this is not the real thing.  My last bottle, which is less than a year old,  is 10 times stronger and is the color of dark urine (Sorry, but that&#x27;s what it looks like).  It&#x27;s described as the exact same product and came in the exact same packaging and 3.4 oz. bottle as I&#x27;ve always gotten so I absolutely know I didn&#x27;t order the wrong product or strength.  This new stuff came in the correct and pristine packaging, says it&#x27;s parfum, and is 3.4 oz. but is about the strength of toilet water - if that.  You can&#x27;t even smell it when sprayed on your wrist.  Now I&#x27;ve learned that I can&#x27;t even return it!  Plus, I can&#x27;t even find a real human being to talk to about this either.  Help!  I want my money back!  Will not buy another fragrance through Amazon ever again.</li>
    <li> good smell the wife is happy</li>
    <li> I have purchased this Perfume over and over again.  It is a very light scent and is never offensive to anyone.  I will purchase it again when this bottle is empty. It is one of my favorite scents.</li>
    <li> I have gotten so many compliments when I wear this Fragrance.  I highly recommend it to anyone.  I don&#x27;t think there is one person that didn&#x27;t like it.</li>
    <li> I love this perfume. It leaves a pretty scent that people will notice as they walk by.</li>
    <li> A classic favorite fresh fragrance for spring and summer that I&#x27;ve loved for years! Great price...So happy I bought it!</li>
    <li> This has been my wife&#x27;s favorite for over 20 years. Makes gift giving a breeze! Chose to use Amazon because of the low price. The price was half of what I had been paying at the department store. Love to save money and get exactly what I want!</li>
    <li> I have worn this perfume for almost 20 years now.  I was a little hesitant to order this from Amazon after reading some of the reviews that said it was a weakened formula.  However, I figured that I would give it a try for myself.  Once the package arrived I took it to a brick and mortar store here in town that sells this perfume.  After comparing the ingredients list (which has changed in the last few years) and the color of the perfume, I saw that what I received from  Amazon was exactly the same as what was being sold at the store, but for a fraction of the cost.  Any changes that are noted in other reviews are from the formula change and not because Amazon has watered the product down.  Enjoy!</li>
    <li> Love this scent.  Beautiful, Light, floral and fresh --- it has been my primary fragrance for more than 20 years and I ALWAYS get compliments on it with people asking me what scent I&#x27;m wearing. I wear a few other perfumes too, but this is hands-down one of my very favorites. It lasts, and is not an overpowering, obnoxious scent. This is a good price for it, too.</li>
    <li> This cologne is my Mom&#x27;s favorite and she can&#x27;t get it at the department store anymore. She was thrilled when it arrived on her doorstep.  I will definately order this again.</li>
    <li> I got a knock off (imitation).  I have used this perfume for so many years and bought it at Macy&#x27;s everytime. The version I got from Amazon does not last long.  The real version is powerful and even becomes intense when you sweat and the scent stays long until you go to bed. I am so disappointed with this purchase.</li>
    <li> Designer Jessica McClintock has outdone herself with this beautiful and memorable fragrance! This lovely floral blend of white jasmine, white roses, and lily of the valley is gentle, whisper soft, and feminine (but not at all powdery), making this perfume perfect for daytime, work, or warm weather wear. The sparkling top notes of lemon and basil leave this perfume youthful, uplifting and refreshing, without being harsh or biting. After application, the scent lingers for the rest of the day, and it tends to have a good deal of throw, so don&#x27;t be surprised if others comment on your choice of fragrance; however this perfume is very rarely overpowering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking for a soft, long lasting, romantic floral perfume reminiscent of sunlight and springtime, you&#x27;ve found it here. This scent is quickly becoming a favorite!</li>
    <li> I have been using this fragrance for many years and the bottle that I received is definitely not the same strength that it has been.  The box was not sealed and could have been tampered with.  I was hesitant to purchase this product because of the low price and I should have listened to my inner voice.</li>
    <li> Got is for my mom-in-law as a gift. She loves this fragrance. A year later I complimented her on her fragrance, and she was wearing this one. Its a lovely scent, and a great gift.</li>
    <li> Wow - the best price I&#x27;ve found online and the merchandise was received in perfect condition.  Very Pleased!</li>
    <li> JESSICA MCCLINTOCK IS THE ONLY PARFUM I USE; I DO NOT LIKE STRONG SENCE. I LOVE SOFT PARFUME.. JESSICA IS THE BEST FOR ME; I GET MANY I LOVE YOU WHAT WEARING.</li>
    <li> I beleive this perfum to be the best almost 95% of the day and evening. It&#x27;s fragence is perfect anytime</li>
    <li> Jessica McClintock is my favorite scent of all time.  It smells similar to lily of the valley.  I can&#x27;t find anything that compares to it or that I like better.</li>
    <li> It was just as expected.  I love it! I have been using this Parfum Spray for almost&lt;br /&gt;20 years and I have always received many compliments.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not quite the same.  I&#x27;ll probably end up buying another bottle at a department store and won&#x27;t try this again.</li>
    <li> I choose these earrings because I love amethysts. These were the worst color I have ever seen! They were not the close to being&lt;br /&gt;anyway near amethyst!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> This is the second time I have ordered Jessica McClintock perfume from Amazon. I have been very pleased with the price, quality, and speed of service in which I received the perfume. I will order this product again.</li>
    <li> Wonderful love the scent</li>
    <li> Lovely fresh scent, it lasts a good long time.</li>
    <li> I love fragrance - people are always asking me what I&#x27;m wearing</li>
    <li> This is a fake or watered down. It smells like ethyl alcohol. I have worn Jessica McClintock as my only perfume for about .. eeek .. 20 years now!! I knew she had gone out of business and licensed her perfume, but I have bought good bottles of it at Walgreens for a while. I don&#x27;t live near a walgreens currently and tried this bottle on Amazon. Reviews are all over the place, with some long-time Jessica McClintock wearers claiming to like it (I kind of think those are fake reviews now..) and some thinking it is a fake, watery knock off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am in the fake watery knock off camp. Don&#x27;t waste your money or time on this, and it CAN&#x27;T BE RETURNED!! You can only petition amazon for a refund if you hate it too. Here are some details on how it differs from my last, real, bottle:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My prior bottle has glass embossing that says BOTTLE MADE IN FRANCE with a sticker that says &amp;#34;Eau de parfum spray made especially for Jessica McClintock INC san francisco CA 94103&amp;#34;. This bottle from Amazon also says BOTTLE MADE IN FRANCE in glass embossing but has a sticker saying &amp;#34;Eau de parfum spray&amp;#34; with a flammable sign under it and some kind of symbol like a jar with the lid open. Then it says &amp;#34;Distributed by Virtue Development Company, Purchase, NY 10557.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is just totally different from the bottle I had before, in every way, in color, smell, how long the scent lasts.</li>
    <li> My perfume at a great price!!</li>
    <li> Everything I expected</li>
    <li> For some reason, Jessica McClintok has an aroma of &amp;#34;watermelon&amp;#34; to me....a fresh, &amp;#34;warm weather&amp;#34; fragrance that just makes me feel clean and wonderful! I love it ! Met all my expectations and of course I would order it again at the price. I haven&#x27;t found it lower anywhere.&lt;br /&gt;Great Spring and Summer fragrance!  Great buy!</li>
    <li> AWESOME PRICE, FAST SHIPPING! EXTREMELY HAPPY!</li>
    <li> This is very stong with Lilly of the Valley scent indeed!  Its beautiful!  May I suggest the new scent called Satin Ribbons, its a heady scent for the fall and winter, it almost smells of chocolate but not quite but it is a nice fall scent to ware and holds nicely.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  It has a clean fresh scent. I went on my first date with a man and he called me a few days later telling me that his bedroom smelled nice and he could not figure out how it smelled like me.  When we kissed each other goodbye on our date, my smell rubbed off on him.  He put his shirt in the hamper.  He finally figured out that it was his shirt in the hamper and he said \\&quot;the room smelled like me...and he enjoyed the smell\\&quot;...very nice compliment.  I always get compliments when I wear this perfume from men and women.  The scent lingers and it smells very nice.</li>
    <li> I just love Jessica Mcclintock and have been wearing the scent for 10 years!  It just didn&#x27;t seem like it smelled the same as it usually does......it seemed watered down with this shipment.  A little disappointed!</li>
    <li> I love this fragrance and was happy I could find it online.</li>
    <li> Jessica Mcclintock is a great smelling perfume. I got this for my wife about 15 years or so ago, and it has been an annual &amp;#34;Christmas gift request&amp;#34; from her. It used to be really expensive, but the price has come down over the years, and Amazon got me the best price. It still smells as good as it did years ago - we never get tired of it.</li>
    <li> item arrived quickly.  same as in the stores, NOT a knock off. very fresh, well packed.  extremely satisfied.  why go to a brick and mortar store when you can get the same product cheaper and in a few days?</li>
    <li> My wife had been using Chanel 5, but after several years of this I told her that either the Chanel goes, or she goes.  She left me, but my new wife is using this perfume, and it is awesome, delightful without being overwhelming.</li>
    <li> It has been many years since I used this perfume.  I boght it in department store when it was on same with intention to recapture my younger years by wearing this fragrance that woudl remind me of time passed.  Perfume comes in a very attractive looking white box with Jessica McClintock logo on it.  The perfume bottle itself comes in a nice sqaure bottle with white top that reminds you this is white flower fragrance perfume.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although ingredients list that perfume has white roses, jasmine, citrus and basil in it; predominant notes are white jasmine and lilly of the valley.  It is light perfume, the kind one can wear in a daytime.  It is suitable for younger women and I like it very much.  It does nto stay on for too long, but thta is true for most white flower perfumes anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All I can say it is fun perfume, light and the price is right.  Give it a try.  It is perfect to wear in the hot summer day.</li>
    <li> This is sometimes a difficult fragrance to find, although I always get positive comments on this lovely, light fragrance. It is refreshing without knocking you over. It probably has a hard time standing up against celebrity-of-the-month scents. Glad I could get it so quickly through Amazon at a very reasonable price. I would be sad to see it discontinued.</li>
    <li> I have been using Jessica Mcclintock perfume for years!  I love the nice light fragrance and that Everyone knows I am wearing Jessica M!  This is a great gift as well because it is very reasonably priced!  Very happy with my product!</li>
    <li> I love the scent of this, and the shipping was fast.</li>
    <li> wonderful product, hard to find in stores</li>
    <li> I bought this for my wife. It&#x27;s amazing and the fragrance is just superb. She likes it too. It lasts whole day.</li>
    <li> This is the best smelling, longest lasting perfume.  I have loved it for years. The price was great alos.l  Thanks</li>
    <li> Not staying longer as per my wife info</li>
    <li> Fast shipping! My mom loved it. Thanks!</li>
    <li> This product has a floral essence that is is well able to provide a key element of one&#x27;s personality statement. It evokes favorable comments from men and women alike with its floral hints.</li>
    <li> Excellent Buy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best in line product and very good experience while shopping online as it was my first time to buy a perfume online.&lt;br /&gt;Must try once.</li>
    <li> best perfume....very fresh smelling- I get lots of compliments.. great price..</li>
    <li> This has a smooth floral scent, not harsh floral, but sweet floral.  Some floral scented perfumes can be a little too tart, harsh on the throat.  This is smooth and fragrant.  One of my favorites.</li>
    <li> I smelled this on someone else and thought I would like it. It just didn&#x27;t smell very good on me. My husband said it was too sweet and flowery.</li>
    <li> MY wife loves this perfume, and I like it when she wears it. The perfume  is old, but it is one of the best for women.</li>
    <li> I have been using Jessica McClintock for many years.  This is not the same as what I have been purchasing.  It was not the same color (it looked very light in color), but I just thought it was because my last bottle was about empty that it was much darker in color.  NOT!  This does not have that wonderful scent that lasts all day like I have been buying in the past.  I am so disappointed.  I guess this good deal (price) was not such a good deal.....just a waste of money.  :(</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t use any other fragrance!  I always get compliments on this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing this cologne for a very long time.  I bought it At&lt;br /&gt;DIillards (they discontinued carrying it)  Then I started buying it at Macy&#x27;s...well, they have been out of it for a couple of months.  sO the light finally went on...try Amazon.  I purchased it at Amazon and was very pleased because it was available and less expensive..&lt;br /&gt;I will buy Jessica McClintock from Amazon from now on&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THANK YOU,</li>
    <li> came quickly just as expected</li>
    <li> It smells nice but seems to loss its fragrance very fast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It would be great if it offers a perfume version</li>
    <li> Found out about this from a relative. Decided to try it. I am so glad I did. Its breathtaking. You feel sexy when wearing this perfume. Reasonable price. Packaged well. I will buy again and other fragrances as well. Great seller. Fast service. Delivery was quick. Thank you so much.</li>
    <li> I have worn this fragrance for years.  Unlike several other reviewers, I am satisfied that the current formulation is the same as in past purchases.  My only disappointment is that the spray mechanism seems faulty.  Unfortunately, it&#x27;s a bit late for a return.  I bought the bottle several months ago, before I had finished using an old one, and, then, when I began using the new one, it took me a while to realize the problem.  A nearly full bottle with a faulty spray mechanism!  Sigh...  You might want to check the spray mechanism as soon as you receive your order so you don&#x27;t suffer the same fate.</li>
    <li> Love it!!! This is my favorite scent!!!! I have worn this for years and was glad to find it here</li>
    <li> Heavenly fragrance.  I&#x27;ve received many compliments.</li>
    <li> I will always order this fragrance and hope when I do run out of mine, I&#x27;ll be able to get it from the same supplier that sent me this one</li>
    <li> This is my mother-in-law&#x27;s favorite perfume. I bought it for her and it was fast shipping, actual product(not a knock-off), she was very excited as she has not been able to afford it for many years. (She does not have Internet access.)</li>
    <li> Can you believe the price is so low. I love this Parfum. It smells like Lily of the Valley. It stays on and is devine</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing this fragrance for years and always get wonderful complements on. It is a light floral scent. Definitely my favorite. to purchase this item in retail stores it costs 59.00. the Amazon price cannot be beat.</li>
    <li> I constantly receive compliments about my perfume when I am out and about.  People stop me on the street or in the stores and ask what am I wearing and I tell them Jessica McClintock and they immediately comment that they knew it and they just love it.  It is quite a compliment .  I have been wearing this perfume for at least  15 years and it is the only perfume I ever purchase.</li>
    <li> I just found this perfume and I love it. It&#x27;s floral and light. I use it as my day perfume. It makes me happy.</li>
    <li> My wife wanted this for christmas. What makes my wife happy, makes me happy! So I bought it for her. I&#x27;m happy.</li>
    <li> I love being able to by designer parfume at a great price!!! I loved it!!!!! This is a great price buy more and give them as gifts!!!!</li>
    <li> This scent is my favorite.  JM has a soft floral, clean scent that makes you feel like you just got out of the shower.  I love it!</li>
    <li> Exactly how it was described! Have always loved this fragrance!</li>
    <li> My wife&#x27;s only preferred scent is Jessica McClintock and it worried me a little to pay so little for it.  However, when it arrived I was pleasantly surprised that it was just like the one from the much higher priced department stores!  Feels good to save so much money in this economy and still get exactly what you wanted. :)</li>
    <li> Nice clean and floral scent!</li>
    <li> The product arrived in excellent condition.  Just what I was looking for at a much lower price than Department&lt;br /&gt;stores.</li>
    <li> I have purchased 2 bottles. I love this line so fresh. Be careful easy to overdo.</li>
    <li> Product dissipates quickly.  A cheap copy?</li>
    <li> I have been wearing this perfume for years and have never been disappointed by a bad batch or bottle that smelled off.</li>
    <li> I was looking for Jessica McClintock in the stores for a special friend for Christmas.  I could not find it anywhere - but found it on Amazon so I ordered it just in the nick of time.  It was perfect - and loved by the receipient.</li>
    <li> I have used this fragrance for a long time.I did mostly purchase&lt;br /&gt;it at a department store.When my perfume arrived from Amazon&lt;br /&gt;I was disappointed to see the cellophane wrapper was not on the&lt;br /&gt;box.I wondered if this was a second or perhaps a used return.&lt;br /&gt;I had planned on giving this perfume as a  gift. I will not do so with&lt;br /&gt;this item.I will have to go to a department store and repurchase it.&lt;br /&gt;This is the first time that Amazon has let me down. Carol V.</li>
    <li> This is a fragrance that has been around for a while and rightly so.  lovely floral, definite overtones of lily of the valley but with other scents involved.  Not overpowering.  great spring and summer fragrance .  or for any light hearted pickme up. great to get it at a good price with limited income... nice treat!</li>
    <li> I love it.  Pleasant smelling perfume if you learn to not use too much.  I will order it again.  And the body powder too.</li>
    <li> I have used Jessica McClintock for many years and have not able to purchase it often because it is rather pricely.  With your great prices, I was able to afford the larger bottle.  Keep up the good work!</li>
    <li> Perfect gift for my wife because she loves this.  It was just as high quality as anything at the major stores and it was to my doors in just days.  Seller like these are the reason I return to Amazon!</li>
    <li> This is my wife&#x27;s favorite perfume. In fact it is the only that she will wear. Great value. We will buy more in the future.</li>
    <li> I love this scent more than anything out there today..I can not be without it ..,It seems to get lots of compliments from men..I was well received and packaged..Thanks for keeping me smelling good</li>
    <li> I have been wearing this parfum for years. But I had been having a problem finding it in the last couple of years. For me is the only fragrance that matches me. I am thankful to find it here and for a quarter of the price it was such a great find. Thank you!!!!</li>
    <li> I chose this item because I get a lot of compliments when I wear Jessica McClintock Eau De Parfum Spray. I buy it from Amazon because the price is right.&lt;br /&gt;  Thank You!</li>
    <li> Product arrived even before it was scheduled but am very disappointed with itself. The smell is far from what I know to be Jessica Mcclintock, it smells like fake. I guess this explains such a low price, I should have known better. Very disappointed and would not recommend it to anybody.</li>
    <li> great product. Better price then at retail stores.</li>
    <li> Great Product; Great Service</li>
    <li> As described, Great deal, fast ship. What more could you ask for.</li>
    <li> Best all time favorite scent.</li>
    <li> This scent is light fresh with vanilla- gardenia overtones which last for 6 - 8 hours. I receive pleasant compliments from both sexes at all times.</li>
    <li> Love this scent.  It is perfect for spring and summer!</li>
    <li> My favorite perfume ever. If I wear perfume, this is the only one I will wear.</li>
    <li> Not real! Dont buy it!</li>
    <li> Love, love this product...it&#x27;s one of my favorites! Beautiful yet not an over powering scent. You&#x27;ll love it too. A great great deal for your hard earned money.</li>
    <li> Been wearing this Perfume for years and never fail to have people complement on it!!  One of my favorites!!</li>
    <li> I am happy with the promptness in receiving my order and the condition was as though I picked it up at the store with the convenience of having it hand delivered to me. Actually I would have given it 5 star rating but I believe that is perfection which puts a lot of pressure on the recipient of that honor. So if anyone reading this has any questions as to if you would be satisfied let me put them at rest. I am well satisfied.</li>
    <li> Excellent product.  Merchandise was fresh and new.  Item was in stock and was received in a timely manner.</li>
    <li> My wife is very pleased!</li>
    <li> great price, fast delivery. Thank you!</li>
    <li> Love the price difference  I have been wearing this fragrance for many years. My usual department stores discontinue carrying it.  This fragrance is the best</li>
    <li> Why spend full price?  You can get the same perfume here for less.  exactly as shown.  great seller</li>
    <li> My favorite perfume ever. great price.</li>
    <li> This item is hard to find in local stores. So I decided to look online to see what I can fine. I was so excited that I found this on amazon. I order this and gave it to my mother. She could not believe I found it. She has been out for over 3 months. Item was shipped fast and quick.</li>
    <li> Excellent. Fast shipping.</li>
    <li> Fresh smell. Light for the spring/summer. I complimented a women years ago on her scent. We worked together and I found mys,Ed saying a lot too her...yup smell so nice. Well saw this on Amazon and the light bulb went off! Bought it and would definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> This Jessica McClintock  is the same bottle and packaging that I wore for many, many years.  After receiving it from Amazon yesterday, I opened  and sprayed it on, very excited.  It STINKS!!!....literally.  This is not the light, floral, and super clean smell that it always was when purchased in a nice store that sold it.  I wore it for three hours thinking that it may fade into that old familiar scent, it did not.  Very heavy, strong, and gave both my husband and I a headache.  I&#x27;ll shop for my perfumes and colgnes in store from now on.</li>
    <li> I have used this fragrance for 19 years. Only a couple sprays and you smelled it all day, never over powering. You could smell it the next day on your clothes still and it smelled wonderful. This must be a knock off. The smell is gone as soon as it dries and isn&#x27;t the exact same smell. I still have my last bottle from Macy&#x27;s and the stickers on the bottom do not match. Original bottle states that it is Manufactured for or by Jessica McClintock and the other is strictly packaging information.</li>
    <li> The smell doesn&#x27;t last all day</li>
    <li> My wife has worn this perfume for years and the bottle I received was not the real thing.  It doesn&#x27;t smell the same and does not last long when worn.  In the past, she has gotten compliments not this time.  Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> Bought abou 4 bottles!</li>
    <li> I noticed the scent on a woman in the grocery store and asked what she was wearing. She told me it would be hard to find but had no trouble finding it on Amazon. I couldn&#x27;t believe the bargain price and now I, too, am receiving compliments on my perfume whenever I go out.</li>
    <li> thanks...but it is a stronger smell than I recall sampling at Belk&#x27;s recently, but, I use just one slight spritzer of it when using it; it will last me years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Barb</li>
    <li> This is my favorite perfume in the whole wide world. I have used it for years, have tried others but always came running back to Jessica.</li>
    <li> love this very much the price is amazing.Used for years never found cheaper anywhere.Thank you</li>
    <li> Always the same quality summer perfume product that I use.</li>
    <li> My favorite fragrance of all time. One squirt will last all day. It you love Lilly of the Vally, this is the fragrance for you&lt;br /&gt;RoseVignettes.blogspot.com</li>
    <li> Good quality, scent is not old, it is not weak and the price is right!</li>
    <li> My favorite perfume shame it is almost impossible to find anymore.</li>
    <li> This is my wife&#x27;s favorite perfume.  It&#x27;s much less expensive on Amazon than in local stores, for the same product.</li>
    <li> Ladies, I was walking through Macy&#x27;s fragrance area, and got my head turned completely around by a woman wearing this fragrance to advertise it that day.  She saw my reaction and had to stifle a laugh.  It was a typical warm, humid afternoon at this store located at the Ala Moana Shopping Center in Honolulu, Hawaii.  This fragrance had an almost hypnotic affect on me.  I could not get over how attracted I was to it.  Of course I immediately purchased a bottle, for a very special lady.  It quickly became her \\&quot;signature scent\\&quot;.  Most reviews are from ladies, so I logged in using my daughter&#x27;s account because I HAD to give this a man&#x27;s perspective.  You ladies wear your fragrances more for men than for other women, do you not?  If that is the case, try a bottle, just to see a man&#x27;s reaction.  You may be pleasantly surprised.  By the way, the sales-lady gathered her shoulder length hair and sprayed just once near the nape of her neck (so she told me...), and the fragrance had permeated her entire head it seemed to me.  She invited me to \\&quot;take a sniff\\&quot; anywhere I wanted, and I was amazed at how pleasantly, sexy she smelled.  Please take my comments under advisement.  This fragrance has that \\&quot;wow\\&quot; factor.  :-)</li>
    <li> I love this scent. Clean and fresh.&lt;br /&gt; I have breathing issues with many perfumes and this one is my favorite to wear.  Has been for years.  I used to buy this at Macy&#x27;s  then I bought one on ebay for a lesser price but it did not smell the same at all.  I tried amazon and I got the product I paid much more for at Macy&#x27;s/</li>
    <li> Love the scent!  It smells so fresh and clean!</li>
    <li> Love Jessica McClintock perfume, it has a light clean smell to it, and it last for a long time. :)</li>
    <li> Amazon sent product quickly.  One of the bottles received was damaged and they  quickly replaced it.  Price on Amazon was excellent!!!!!!!  Couldn&#x27;t ask for better service.</li>
    <li> it is not the same as i&#x27;ve been using for years, it&#x27;s very weak in smell and color. is amazon selling fakes? i hate to think so, we use amazon a lot and customer service is great! i was going to ask for a refund but i saw a comment that the person said some are ok some aren&#x27;t. i really love this perfume so i might try for an exchange instead and hope for better.  this is rather weird though... how could one bottle purchased be good but not the next.</li>
    <li> I have worn this perfume for several years now and I love the way it lingers with out being too strong. I get so many compliments. I don&#x27;t understand the comments about buying here at Amazon versus the department stores. It is the exact same thing. I don&#x27;t believe that it is \\&quot;watered down\\&quot; Same exact bottle. hmm? Either way, it would proably cost more at the department stores because of the mark ups. For the price and the fact I can put it on early morning and it stays on all day.</li>
    <li> I love this fragrance the same as the lotion, all of Jessica Mc Clintock products that I have tried are great.  Would purchase this again from this site as their products, price, and service is very good.</li>
    <li> My daughter admired this fragrance worn by a co-worker. She added it to her Christmas list and I gave it to her as one of her presents. Nice product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried other perfumes...but I always come back to Jessica McClintock!&lt;br /&gt;Love it!</li>
    <li> I love this perfume. I am glad I can get it still.</li>
    <li> My favorite fragrance...and a great price too! Can&#x27;t beat Amazon for price comparing!</li>
    <li> Smells perfect, so much cheaper than the department store.</li>
    <li> Same lovely scent for less than half the price!</li>
    <li> Love this perfume and the prices on Amazon.</li>
    <li> I like it  if  I order more the give me discount on it?</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t smell like the real stuff</li>
    <li> I purchase perfume for special occasion gifts for my wife.  This is one of her favorites.  The price beats anything on the local market.  A special gift for any occasion..</li>
    <li> I was so happy when i rcvd my order, the fraqrance is so light,not heavy,and it lasts a long time,its a classic fraquance,romantic and soft but u will know its there,,Ladies don&#x27;t be afraid,take a chance and try it;you just might be surprise;I thought it was priced just right for 3.4 .oz,this will be one of my signature fragrances to wear.I like to switch up on my parfums,I can&#x27;t say enough its Beautiful*</li>
    <li> My wife loves this perfume as do I. When she seen the great price she had me order 2 large bottles of it.</li>
    <li> My mother loved it, she was actually looking for this exact perfume from a sample she found</li>
    <li> I have purchased this same fragrance for about 5 years. I&#x27;ve bought is at a leading department store as well as from a perfume store at the outlet mall. I am very disappointed in this purchase as it seems to me that the fragrance is rather weak - almost as if it is watered down. Maybe that is why the price was so unbelievable.</li>
    <li> I adore Jessica Mcclintock perfume and was told at my local department store that the company went out of business. I&#x27;m very disappointed but appreciate that I can purchase the perfume on Amazon. The fragrance is so popular that I&#x27;m amazed they haven&#x27;t sold it to another company.</li>
    <li> Just like the much more expensive  perfume!</li>
    <li> it was a gift for my mother.  it is her favorite perfume.</li>
    <li> My sister in law loves this cologne, perfect birthday gift and great service.</li>
    <li> Beautiful perfume. Excellent service</li>
    <li> I love the scent of this perfume; this is the only perfume I will wear. My friends and family also love this scent!</li>
    <li> I love this clean delicate smell of Jessica Mcclintock perfume.  My husband really likes it and asks me to spray it on his t-shirts that he wears to work the next day.  Many compliments from people I am around when I wear it.  The 3.4 oz bottle really lasts a long time and only one spray is plenty</li>
    <li> the perfume purchased did not have \\&quot;made in France\\&quot; on the bottom as did the ones I have purchased from dept. stores.  The scent also did not last as the more expensive dept. store items.  Is this a \\&quot;knock-off\\&quot;, or is this the real thing?  I was disappointed in the purchase, please let me know.</li>
    <li> Beautiful, light, memorable fragrance.  Many men and women love it according to all the compliments I&#x27;ve received over the years.  Recently I went online to see what the price was at Amazon and was amazed and delighted at the steep discount for the large bottle!  Needless to say, I snapped up one for myself and bought the other as a birthday gift for my daughter-in-law who loves this particular Jessica McClintock fragrance as well.  Unbeatable price at Amazon and super fast delivery. It is the real deal, not an imitation.  My nose knows!  Thank you Amazon and Jessica M!!</li>
    <li> SO MANY COMPLIMENTS-SO FEMININE-LOVE THE GARDENIA UNDERTOMES. LASTS ALL DAY. GOT A GIFT FROM MY SISTER IN LAW 7 YEARS AGO AND NOW THIS IS ALL I WEAR!!!!!!!  LOVE IT!!!!!!!!!! COMPARE THE PRICES TO DEPT STORES-HA-GO AMAZON!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always love this perfume as opposed to new ones that come in the market. Works well with my body chemistry, has florant scent, subtle not overpowering.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for years--now I can pay less than 1/2 price for buying it online!  Definitely recommend if you like a light floral perfume that isn&#x27;t overpowering.</li>
    <li> Have not tried the O&#x27;Keeffe&#x27;s Healthy Feet Creme, as it was bought for my son&lt;br /&gt;who gets cracked and dry feet in cold weather.  Sorry!</li>
    <li> My favorite. Always earns compliments, even from strangers walking by.</li>
    <li> This doesn&#x27;t smell like the original Jessica McClintock purfume that I have purchased in the past. It smells more like a bathroom spray...so sad and it says I cannot return it because it is a liquid. I will not ever buy another perfume from Amazon if that is the case.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite cologne.  I have been wearing it for years and I don&#x27;t believe I will ever change.  I would recommend this to my friends.</li>
    <li> Very, very economical!  I&#x27;ve recommended many others to buy it here!  Best price around and it&#x27;s so, so worth it!</li>
    <li> This fragrance provides a hint of romance so it&#x27;s not overpowering and it has some staying power.  I constantly receive compliments and requests for the name of my perfume.</li>
    <li> Jessica McClintock perfume is my all-time favorite.  I&#x27;v been getting compliments from all kinds of people for years.  It suits me.  It&#x27;s very floral and light... but it lasts all day.  Seriously.... 8-10 hours after I spray (only one spritz), I still get told I smell good.  It doesn&#x27;t agree with everyone, but if you like floral, this is a must have.  The price on Amazon is the cheapest by far.</li>
    <li> If I could put a 0 star, I would! The fragrance is not the original one that  i fell in love with . And now that I am out of the country, I can&#x27;t even return it anymore without me spending shipping cost .</li>
    <li> I am very disappointed!!! This is not the same as I used to buy. I actually think it is filled with water. There is no scent.&lt;br /&gt;I would not recommend and feel I was ripped off.!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update on this order.......I would like to apologize for my comment. When I received this , the box was very hot. I don&#x27;t know if that had something to do with it not having the scent, but I am now using and it does smell the same as I used to buy. I love this perfume and hope I can continue to purchase.</li>
    <li> I bought for my daughter and she loves it.  Was very happy to find on Amazon - Thank you :)</li>
    <li> It lays upon you so softly, and is good for a layering scent, with your favorit powders.  Floral honeysuckle, enjoy it very much.</li>
    <li> I have used this for years.  It smells fresh and isn&#x27;t heavy.  I ordered two large bottles.  One smells perfect.  The other has more of a alcohol smell instead of perfume.  Why is that?????</li>
    <li> This fragrance is timeless and even though I might purchase or receive other scents, I always come back to this one.  It smells like flowers, it&#x27;s fresh, it&#x27;s feminine.  It is not overbearing.  There are times that a musk or spice-based perfume might be alright, but this is ME...every day.  It lasts all day, from work to dinner afterwards.  In fact, to help make it last longer, I use Jessica Mcclintock&#x27;s lotion as a base on pulse points when I know I have a long day ahead of me. I always have a small vial in my purse when traveling. Like I said, I have other perfumes that I like, but this is my favorite, my signature scent.</li>
    <li> Wife loves it !  She is a teacher.  When wearing it to school on occasion almost all her fellow female teachers at one time or another have asked what it is.... so they can get some !!</li>
    <li> This is my absolute favorite fragrance, and this is a terrific Price. No matter where I go, I get compliments on this fragrance. This is a great value for the size of the bottle and the price.</li>
    <li> I received the perfume before Christmas.  Didn&#x27;t open it until I was traveling.  When I finally sprayed the perfume, it did not even smell like Jessica McClintock.  It is my signature scent.  I will not order it from Amazon.  The bottle must have been old.  I was really disappointed as I do not live close to a store when I can readily purchase this.</li>
    <li> I have been wearing this scent for over 19 years and plan on wearing it for many more. The price was great</li>
    <li> I used this cologne many year ago.  Like the smell of jasmine in this cologne...thoughts of jasmine evoked memories of my home country (India) which made me nostalgic so I ordered it again recently.  Like it just as much as I did years ago.  Its a bit strong but if you like the smell of jasmine, you will love it!!!</li>
    <li> This perfume smell good but it don&#x27;t last long on your skin but on your clothes it do for a long time so if u a person that like it on your clothes then your skin a must get</li>
    <li> Gift for my sister - she has bought this at a bridal shop that went out of business. Glad I could find it.</li>
    <li> Wife likes this perfume, but cannot find it on stores.&lt;br /&gt;She&#x27;s delighted we found online.&lt;br /&gt;If momma ain&#x27;t happy, no one is ;)</li>
    <li> Bought this for my mother and she loves the fragrance.it was a lot cheaper than buying it in a store.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t know how many years this has been available, but it&#x27;s a testament to its staying power. This gets many, many compliments. It&#x27;s never over the top, but a deep, lovely floral scent.</li>
    <li> Arrived fast and packaged nicely.  Made a great gift.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smells great.</li>
    <li> I was hesitant after reading some previous reviews on this product through Amazon, but I took a chance and the perfume is fine! Ive been wearing Jessica McClintock for 15+ years and for most of those years have purchased it through department stores at a much more expensive price. I was very satisfied with this purchase.</li>
    <li> The scent is very like lily of the valley which I find cloying in a perfume.  Too bad I didn&#x27;t sample it at a store first.</li>
    <li> great price and I love it.</li>
    <li> I tried this product years ago.  After trying many other more expensive perfumes, I decided to try the Jessica Mcclintock once again.  I still love it.  It&#x27;s a very clean and refreshing scent.  On top of that, it is much less expensive than most other perfumes.</li>
    <li> Gardenias and lilies of the valley, very light and floral, nice for spring and summer. A great classic perfume spray.</li>
    <li> A real bargain @ this price.  Thx.</li>
    <li> Excellent product, excellent deal.  Cheaper than stores, a perfect gift for my mam and my aunties.</li>
    <li> This bottle had absolutely NO FRAGRANCE whatsoever.  It must have been old stock.  Not happy.</li>
    <li> This price is unheard of for Jessica Mcclintock perfume. I bought this for my grandmother for her birthday and she is adamant it smells just as good as any other Jessica perfume she bought in store at twice the price. Amazon comes through again.</li>
    <li> Very, very pleased.....would order again....you cannot beat the price....and the scent is just great!!!  Ordered for gifts....I know this will be a very surprising gift.</li>
    <li> It is a wonderful fragrance!  I have enjoyed Jessica Mcclintock for years.  The price on Amazon is good, and the product is easy to&lt;br /&gt;order.</li>
    <li> Purchased this as a gift for my sister. She loved the fragrance and said it was now her favorite.  The price was way lower than I owuld have paid elsewhere!</li>
    <li> My wife used to have this perfume and loved it. I got it for her for Christmas and Amazon had the best price by far. I&#x27;m happy she is happy.</li>
    <li> I buy a bottle of this a year, I have been wearing this scent since I was 17, my best friend Kara Jaques bought me my very first bottle. It was her favorite perfume, now in memory of her, I buy a bottle every year. A truly beautful scent and has wonderful memories attached to it!</li>
    <li> Love this fragrance and really loved the price and speedy shipping! Than you</li>
    <li> Love this perfume. Very good price fast shipping.  Happy with this purchase</li>
    <li> The cost was outstanding. I went on line because the store that my wife bought it at stopped stocking it.</li>
    <li> Soft fragrance, doesn&#x27;t overwhelm. I&#x27;ve been using this for 15 years..</li>
    <li> I have been using this scent since it came on the market.  Since I&#x27;m wearing it I have been asked,  &amp;#34;What is that perfume you are wewaring?&amp;#34; countless times.  A man followed me around Home Depot to ask me, a woman tapped me on the shoulder in the movie theater and a man asked me on on airplane!  All of them asked me to write the name down so they could by it for themselves or their wives.  The scent lingers, smells like fresh flowers, and is truly amazing.  My husband loves it!</li>
    <li> Arrived on time, new, great deal and speedy delivery. Thank you.</li>
    <li> My fave perfume for over 25 years, Amazon has never let me down when ordering Jessica McClintock online.  The parfum comes with perfect aromatic intensity, I have never had to return a bottle because it was too old &amp; alcohol-turned.  Love my latest bottle, the uniquely Jessica feminine fragrance perfect for prepping for the happy holiday season!  Always packaged in the proper original Jessica box, the sturdy bottle arrives undamaged, with perfect spraying activity, ready to go as soon as you open the package.</li>
    <li> This is one a classic perfume. My mother wore it for a season when I was young, and it always brings back memories when I use it. It&#x27;s light yet musky. I&#x27;ve never purchased it here though, usually at a retail establishment. It&#x27;s a great price on Amazon though.</li>
    <li> This was the real perfume not a toilet&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I searched and searched and this was the BEST value! I bought several and everyone loved it!</li>
    <li> This product was very affordable and of great quality. I would recommend to others. Thank you and have a great day.</li>
    <li> I thought the scent was off.  I have been using this perfume for many years now.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know if there is a change in the formula but not quit the same.</li>
    <li> I have been wearing Jessica Mcclintock perfume for about 20 years I have tried others but always keep coming back to it. I constantly get compliments from young to old. Great perfume and not over bearing</li>
    <li> Ordered as a gift for Valentines Day, Arrived on time. That&#x27;s the only good points.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Packaging and the Bottle is the sames as that sold in the major department stores, but the contents is just WATER. I thought the price was to good, so I trusted Amazon as to the authenticity of the product, and ordered it directly through their store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trying to return it, Amazon website tells you that you are out of luck and should contact your local government agency on the proper procedures for disposing of toxic waste, (WATER?). No other information.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buyer be ware! Now I&#x27;m off to Macy&#x27;s to buy the real thing, questioning may reasoning for having a prime account and doing business with Amazon.</li>
    <li> I love this perfume and have purchased it for years via Dept Stores.  I thought it would be easier to buy from Amazon but after reading the reviews here I will definitely NOT purchase online.  I&#x27;d rather pay more at a Dept store and know what I&#x27;m getting than to order from an unknown vendor and get watered down product or something that smells like alcohol.  This is a lovely fragrance, particularly for people like myself that tend to get headaches from really strong scents.  Would recommend the product - but buy it where you can smell it first!</li>
    <li> Smells good, just a bit strong.</li>
    <li> My favorite perfume. So thankful I was able to find it here and at a great price.</li>
    <li> Wondeful! Arrived safely in days!</li>
    <li> Shipped quickly; and the person I ordered it for loves it!!!</li>
    <li> Quick delivery and great price! Love this product😁</li>
    <li> I am very disappointed that Amazon would sell a knock off parfum when I trust you as a source for everything.  I have a little of my old one and when i compare Amazon&#x27;s to mine it smells different. I am sorry that i purchased this item from amazon and now they don&#x27;t accept returns.</li>
    <li> I was amazed by how quickly this product arrived.................practically the next day!!  (Maybe it was a few days.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And the natural, flower-like fragrance is wonderful.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this perfume off and on since the mid 90s, and I get more compliments from this particular fragrance than any other I&#x27;ve ever worn.</li>
    <li> I have used Jessica McClintock for a few years and love it.It is not overpowering like so many other perfumes.  JG</li>
    <li> have you ever been somewhere and somebody smells really good,well I am the kind of person who asks what perfume they are wearing....10 times out of 10 it was Jessica Mcclintock.I love flowery light scents and this is one of the best...also Amazon has it for much less than others...enjoy spring all year round</li>
    <li> Love this fragrance - Always get compliments</li>
    <li> This has been one of my favorites, but very hard to fine.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you</li>
    <li> Great seller, great price, my fav perfume.</li>
    <li> I ordered three packs of Jessica Mcclintock and received a fake imitation of the product. The packing did not disclose the manufacturer or where it was made. I tried to return this purchase to Amazon but was not allowed on the basis that this is a hazardous material and must be disposed of locally.</li>
    <li> I have my own bottle and ordered this for my mom&#x27;s birthday.  it is not the same.</li>
    <li> Great value for the size of perfume. Shipped very fast too!</li>
    <li> Love the light, subtle fragrance of this perfume.  It remains gentle and not overpowering  when applied to your skin, even in hot, humid climates.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift,I was surprised and very pleased when it arrived.It was twice the size of the bottle I got at KMart for the same price.</li>
    <li> Not as strong smell as it used to be, it evaporates almost instantly</li>
    <li> I was married in a Jessica Mcclintock dress but don&#x27;t let that prejudice get in the way of this review. I&#x27;ve used this perfume for almost 20 years and still love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is one of my favorite daily fragrances. It is light, flowery but not too sweet, not too heavy and perfect for daytime. I get compliments on it constantly even though I can&#x27;t smell it on myself. I love the initial scent and feel like I&#x27;m starting the day with a pleasant introduction to others instead of an onslaught of overpowering fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this as a daily use, casual scent.</li>
    <li> One of my favorites at a great price!</li>
    <li> Gift purchase.....she loved it.</li>
    <li> Always a favorite - thanks</li>
    <li> A very pleasant scent!</li>
    <li> One of my two favorites.  Often asked what I have on.  Good clean smell.  Not overbearing.</li>
    <li> Gift for my mother-in-law. She can&#x27;t take strong perfumes. Used to be able to buy it at department stores, but now only online.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time as stated. Nice size bottle. Very pleased!</li>
    <li> Wears of quickly and irritates sinuses</li>
    <li> I really like my perfume</li>
    <li> classic and timeless, delicate and affordable! fresh spring lily of valley scent!</li>
    <li> Great price for the parfum my mother has used for years. Made an awesome gift.</li>
    <li> The order was received promptly and the recipient liked it very much</li>
    <li> I was very skeptical about buying this product because of the very low price.  It is the same perfume I&#x27;ve been paying $60 for!  I&#x27;m so happy I looked for it at Amazon.com.</li>
    <li> Great service, Great Price!  Made my wife a very happy person!  Once again, Amazon comes through on quality product at a great price.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love the smell of jessica Mcclintock perfume and I am very happy with the size and price that I paid for this product.</li>
    <li> it is wonderful product and it was original packaging not repackage...</li>
    <li> Never fails to lift my spirits. Glorious scent, lasts a long time. You don&#x27;t even have to put much on to smell heavenly. I keep buying this over and over and am never disappointed. Thank you Jessica Mcclintock.</li>
    <li> Great product.  The same one that they sell for $80 at Ulta.  I don&#x27;t understand some of the bad reviews.  It&#x27;s the real stuff.</li>
    <li> Smells good going on but disappears after about 1hour.  Seemed like its watered down. Will not purchase from this vendor again.</li>
    <li> Love this Eau De Parfum and the price was so much cheaper than in the retail stores.  Again, Amazon has come through to make your purchases very easy.  The big plus, it comes to your door.</li>
    <li> Another big consumer win purchasing from Amazon. Fast shipping and great value. This is a lovely light smelling cologne. I am usually asked what I am wearing when people get a whiff of it.</li>
    <li> Given as a gift, and my friend loves it.</li>
    <li> Item arrived quickly and as described...excellent value for the transaction.  this will not be my last purchase many more to come</li>
    <li> My husband got me this perfume for Christmas. I have worn this fragrance for years and couldn&#x27;t believe how great of a deal we got on this.  I have never found this size bottle of Jessica Mcclintock  perfume for this great price.  I would most certainly recommend this seller and I will definitely order from them in the future.</li>
    <li> I love Jessica McClintock! It is so fresh and sensual also.&lt;br /&gt;Every where I go people (both male and female) ask me&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;What is that wonderful perfume you are wearing!!? I tell&lt;br /&gt;them &amp;#34;Jessica&amp;#34; of course! I hope it will be available like&lt;br /&gt;this for a very long time.</li>
    <li> I have worn this perfume for years.  I have never purchased it online before.  I don&#x27;t know if they have changed the formula for the scent but I&#x27;m not smelling what I have for years.  I&#x27;m going to go to a store and see if their formula smells like this or what I have had before.  Very sad if something has changed :(  People have many said &amp;#34;You smell so good...what is that?  No one is saying that now including me.</li>
    <li> I ordered this and it arrived but the scent is not the same like the one I ordered sometime ago. I don&#x27;t understand why the scent has changed. I am hesitant to order again.</li>
    <li> My wife smells wonderful wearing it, and she loves it too! It&#x27;s not overpoweringand reminds me of lilies of the valley in the Springtime.</li>
    <li> Purchased this as a gift for my mom.  This is one of her favorite signature scents.  This perfume is a classic.  I&#x27;ll be purchasing this again.</li>
    <li> This has been my favorite fragrance for years and years so I was happy to find it on Amazon at a super price compared to Macy&#x27;s. I have had many people ask me what perfume I was wearing because they liked it so well. At Amazon&#x27;s price, I can wear it every day.</li>
    <li> Reminds me of Lily of the valley, the purfume of my childhood.  I would always as a ninth grader buy Coty Lily of the valley.  And Jessica Mcclintock reminds me of that, not as sweet but as airy.</li>
    <li> This is the most wonderful perfume spray ever.  It has the best blend of flower fragrances - light, never heavy.  This fragrance lasts all day long.  Everywhere I go people always ask what perfume I am wearing and say it smells wonderful.  I will not wear any other scent.  You will love it!</li>
    <li> A fraction of the cost of what you pay in a high end department store.  A very good deal and I will be ordering again.</li>
    <li> My Mom been using this scent for a long time. The scent is not strong so as not to bother anybody close.</li>
    <li> This is my wife&#x27;s favorite perfume. I buy it for her every year. This purchase was 1/2 the cost of department stores in my area.</li>
    <li> I love this scent.  Sometimes total strangers stop my and ask what I&#x27;m wearing (which is how I found the fragrance in the first place!).  It&#x27;s become &#x27;my&#x27; fragrance and I love it.</li>
    <li> I tend to love floral perfumes and have tried many.  However, THE ONLY perfume I ever get complimented on when I wear it is Jessica Mcclintock.  Of course, everyone&#x27;s body chemistry is different, but I can&#x27;t recommend Jessica Mcclintock enough!  Amazon has a great price on the large eau de parfum and shipping was fast.</li>
    <li> el producto llego a tiempo, son de muy buena calidad, igual a las fotos, lo recomiendo a toda la comunidad</li>
    <li> I have worn Jessica McClintock perfume for years. This last bottle I purchased seems watered down. The scent doesn&#x27;t stay on me like before and even the color is closer to clear. I bought two bottles so I hope this bottle is just a fluke. I am disappointed. Not sure what happened to the product and why it is different.  :-(</li>
    <li> This is a delightfully pretty, fresh, sophisticated, appealing fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;If you like floral and citrus scents that never overpowers, then this fragrance is for you.&lt;br /&gt;A very feminine fragrance.</li>
    <li> This is one of my favorite perfumes and kinda expensive. I found this product on Amazon at an amazing price and thought this can&#x27;t be the real thing. Well I took a chance and ordered it and it is the real deal and not a knock off. Love it so much I have ordered more already as gifts.</li>
    <li> Such a lovely and sexy scent. Nice and light for daytime, with floral overtones. Clean and uncomplicated, I never tire of it.</li>
    <li> No real perfume scented water. Rip off. No returns allowed!!!! Buyer beware!</li>
    <li> Good purchase for the price.</li>
    <li> WAS ACTUALLY PROMISED TO NO END THAT THIS PERFUME WAS  THE REAL  THING/SCENT. Well my wife has been using this perfume for years and no stores are carrying it anymore. SO out of desperations I purchased this perfume from AMAZON( EVEN AFTER QUESTIONING THE VERY LOW  PRICE) WELL I WILL NEVER BUY PERFUME FROM AMAZON AGAIN&amp;#62;&amp;#62; LIVE AND LEARN. THE PERFUME IS A FRAUD AS ITS SCENT IS SO WEAK .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;MR B</li>
    <li> absolutely satisfied with this perfume. thank you as always my girlfriend loved it.i will buy this product again , thanks</li>
    <li> This is my favorite perfume and amazon had it available at 1/2 the price I normally pay.  I was thrilled.</li>
    <li> I have many scents I wear often.  However, this is a beautiful and refreshing scent.  Smells as I&#x27;d u just bathed in a field of beautiful flowers!</li>
    <li> MY FAVORITE PERFUME, DELIVERD ON TIME, JESSICA MCCLINTOCK SPEAKS FOR HERSELF. PRICE IS JUST RIGHT. THIS PRODUCT IS A WIN /WIN ITEM.</li>
    <li> Whenever I spray this on, even if its early in the morn&lt;br /&gt;Ing, I always  get a &amp;#34;Wow that smells so good. What are you wearing &amp;#34;  comment. I&#x27;ve been  spraying Jessica on for years, and I love it. Floral but subtle.</li>
    <li> classic, lovely floral</li>
    <li> My mom LOVES this stuff, and when she found out I could order it for her on here and at this price/size at such a amazing value? It was a no-brainer. Now one of her BFFs asked what it was and how to get it so I just ordered another one for her as well. The best thing to an allergy sufferer like me? It&#x27;s scent is SUBTLE and sophisticated, unlike a lot of these designer women&#x27;s fragrances, that are cloying and so strong they could wrestle the Rock. This has a pretty, feminine and unobtrusive elegance.</li>
    <li> The only perfume I&#x27;ll wear since I discovered it about 15 years ago. Need I say more!</li>
    <li> Amazing...My most favorite perfume....Do not buy cause that will leave more for me</li>
    <li> FAST DELIVERY GREAT PRICE ON AN AMAZING FLORAL SCENT not too strong of a scent ... quite lovely</li>
    <li> I have used Jessica for years.  It&#x27;s a light scent but remains with you throughout the day.&lt;br /&gt;I am always asked what &amp;#34;are you wearing&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Christmas Present for wife.</li>
    <li> Love this fragrance!! Smells good!  A light scent!</li>
    <li> This does not seem as strong as what I have bought in stores. Makes you wonder if this is the real thing?</li>
    <li> Jessica McClintock perfume is the ONLY fragrance that I wear now ~ and I&#x27;ve worn a lot of famous perfumes. I discovered it years ago by asking a lady what she was &#x27;wearing&#x27; and she recommended this. Since then, I have been asked what I was &#x27;wearing&#x27;. Never before has that happened, and I am 69 years old!! It&#x27;s a romantic, light, floral fragrance that is not over-powering. My only &#x27;con&#x27; is that it does not last a long time. Still, it&#x27;s very much worth it. The price is right and the fragrance is the most wonderful, clean, refreshing scent I have ever worn. Expect compliments from men &amp; women.</li>
    <li> The scent of Lily of the valley is so delicate and warm...persistent though..and for such a great price..a must buy, if you like Lily of the valley..</li>
    <li> I have worn this perfume for the last 10 years!!  It is not the same!  It is more like a watered down knock off!  I am so very disappointed!  This was my one christmas present to myself, but instead it looks like this cheap watered down brand is going into the garbage!  Never again!!!  II&#x27;ll stick to paying the higher price for the real product from a reputable seller! Like a department store!!!</li>
    <li> I purchased this perfume for a friend as a gift. A few days after I gave my friend this perfume she called to ask me where I purchased it from so she could return/exchange it due to it smelling - OLD, MUSTY, and SOUR. I am mortified and embarrassed. I don&#x27;t see anywhere on here where I can talk to the seller or ask for a replacement or refund. Needless to say, I will not be ordering again. I am highly disappointed. :(</li>
    <li> The purfume came fast and it was quicker then I tho,thanksught,the purfume smells gret ot was a present and they loved it</li>
    <li> This is my favorite perfume,  it arrived on time, it was new and reasonably priced. I recommend this product to anyone who likes this scent.</li>
    <li> My wife has been using this product for many years.&lt;br /&gt;Exactly the same product as sold in major department stores, only for nearly half of the price.</li>
    <li> nice item. price is good. couldnt have asked for anything more. i was pleased with the overall purchase and everything.</li>
    <li> If you are looking for a light and floral perfume, this is for you. It is not overpowering and lasts all day. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> This is one of my favorite colognes. I have been using this for about 10 to 15 years. The price online is good and you get more bang for your buck!</li>
    <li> I have to agree with the other reviwers that this is a somewhat watererd down version&lt;br /&gt;But even watered down I love it!&lt;br /&gt;What more can I say?&lt;br /&gt;I LOVE it&lt;br /&gt;LOVE IT&lt;br /&gt;Absolutely love it&lt;br /&gt;My favorite fragrance it lasts all day,&lt;br /&gt;be prepared for people asking you what is that fragrance you are wearing...it doesn&#x27;t take much!</li>
    <li> Very satisfied with the price</li>
    <li> Very pleased with this product.</li>
    <li> I have worn this perfume for over 20 years and it&#x27;s the best perfume I have ever had and will ever purchase.  It stays on all day, you never need a touch up, it smells light and refreshing, and it&#x27;s the only perfume I&#x27;ve ever received compliments on by both men and women.  My friend was wearing it one day, I was working for the airlines at the time and we were not permitted to wear perfume that had a strong fragrance, when I smelled this perfume for the first time I was hooked and had to have some and have been wearing it ever since.  Great fragrance and great price.</li>
    <li> Delightful fragrance.  I get sooo many compliments on this wonderfully fresh cologne.</li>
    <li> Disappointed to confirm that the reviewers who reported that this product was not the same Jessica McClintock that they had used previously were absolutely right.  I have used Jessica as my spring/summer fragrance for many years but was unable to locate anymore in department stores - so ordered through Amazon.  Reviews were just all over the place - many very positive - many very negative - decided to take a chance.  When I received my bottle, I compared it to the small amount left in my old bottle (purchased spring of 2013.)  The color of the perfume in the new bottle was noticeably paler than the old.  I sprayed a good amount of the new on my arm - the fragrance wasn&#x27;t very strong and just did not smell the same - and the fragrance dissipated within 30 seconds.  Honestly - I just couldn&#x27;t smell it anymore.  Guess I&#x27;ll just move on to my fall/winter fragrance a little early this year and try to find something comparable to the old Jessica next spring.  Bummer!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE - Amazon is great - they refunded the purchase price of this item.</li>
    <li> NIce convenient size. The price is great. I am very satisfied</li>
    <li> Compared to the long-lasting fragrance of Jessica McLintock I used to get, this smells just slightly better than tap water. Its been that way for the last several years. For awhile I thought I was getting a knock-off but I&#x27;ve been careful to buy from the best stores I know of and its still not a full fragrance. Very disappointing. I may go back to Nina Ricci</li>
    <li> I AM VERY HAPPY WITH THIS STUFF, REACH BEFORE I WAS EXPECTING, GOOD PRICE AND I RECOMMENDED IT VERY MUCH</li>
    <li> My boss let me use his account to order one of these for myself and the scent is really lovely and the price isn&#x27;t bad at all.</li>
    <li> This perfume is not authentic Jessica McClintock eau de Perfume) it is distributed by Virtue Development N.Y. The &amp;#34;Original&amp;#34; perfume is distributed by &amp;#34;Made exclusively for Jessica McClintock&amp;#34;. If one looks at the bottom of the bottle you can see where the perfume originates. I have ordered this perfume over the past few years and never had this problem. I trusted Amazon.com would qualify their venders!</li>
    <li> Excellent, love this scent.  Have been wearing it every day since mid-90&#x27;s.  Never get tired of it and still get compliments!</li>
    <li> Great &amp;#34;teacher&amp;#34; fragrance</li>
    <li> been looking for this product a long time with out high price. Love, love, love it.will be buying again. it is my favorite summer smell.</li>
    <li> I LOVE Jessica Mcclintock eau de parfum spray.  It is the only fragrance that I have used for 30 years.  Everyone always compliments me and asks what I am wearing.  Wonderful, light fragrance.</li>
    <li> Bought as a gift for my mother and she absolutely loves it. It has a really lovely floral fragrance and I would wear it myself.</li>
    <li> The product i received was definitely NOT Jessica McClintock perfume. It&#x27;s the only fragrance I&#x27;ve worn for years and am very familiar with the product. This didn&#x27;t smell even remotely like Jessica McClintock. I can&#x27;t help but think that this is some kind of scam where they put very malodorous, sub-par frangrance in a brand name bottle - isn&#x27;t that illegal? Anyway, I should&#x27;ve known the price was too good to be true. DO NOT TAKE YOUR CHANCES ON THIS!!</li>
    <li> Very pleased, thank you&lt;br /&gt;Could not find it in department stores</li>
    <li> Bought 2 bottles for my mother&#x27;s birthday.  It is definitely not the same as what you would find in a retail store.  The fragrance is weak and smells almost as if it was watered down.  Wish I could return for a refund but it has been too long.</li>
    <li> It came on the date promised. It was a gift and the receiver said it was all she expected it to be.</li>
    <li> It is watered and not the real thing at all,it is really awfull smell compared to the real thing.It is really a waste of money.</li>
    <li> Love the price and purchased for my mom for her birthday.  She loves the scent and it arrived early and in good condition</li>
    <li> I like it. More importantly, the wife loves it.</li>
    <li> This was a cheap replica and was not the real thing! Do not buy!</li>
    <li> Great Service as always , Thank you.</li>
    <li> My everyday  parfum, and I get many complements. Not overpowering.</li>
    <li> My favorite all time and really good price!</li>
    <li> I ordered this perfume for my mom as a birthday present. IT WAS NOT THE PERFUME, it smelled a lot like rubbing alcohol. I only rated it one star because Amazon made me. Don&#x27;t be fooled! What a scam!</li>
    <li> I love this perfume which I have used for well over 20 years. Over all these years using this product, the scent has stood the test of time. Get many compliments every time I use it, wherever I go.</li>
    <li> Smells amazing and lasts all day:)</li>
    <li> The aroma doesn&#x27;t seem as strong as the store bought product.</li>
    <li> I always buy this product.  It smells wonderful, doesn&#x27;t overpower and is wearable year round.  I&#x27;m never dissapointed with Jessica McClintock.</li>
    <li> I have worn this perfume for 20+ years!&lt;br /&gt;It is a fresh, clean, powdery, floral scent.  Lily of the Valley and jasmine are the two strongest scents, and the rest just smell fresh.  This lasts a long time...but since I have worn it so long, neither my hubby and I can smell it on me mostly!  I have been looking for a replacement scent for the last 5 years (since we can&#x27;t smell it on me) but I can&#x27;t find something that I like that lasts more than a couple of hours.</li>
    <li> I choose this rating because it arrival on time. I like this product is my favorite perfume, will refer to a friend</li>
    <li> Thanks for making it available. Not sure why we need to have twenty (20) words. Need five more - one more time.</li>
    <li> I love this scent and will keep buying it. The packaging is very nice too. Soft fragrance that doesn&#x27;t seem overpowering.</li>
    <li> My favorite perfume. Far less expensive than perfume depts. Well worth the purchase and it shipped great.&lt;br /&gt;So happy I bought it!</li>
    <li> This is my favorite fragrance to wear and I get asked a lot what kind of perfume I wear because&lt;br /&gt;they like it so well.  It has a fresh smell.</li>
    <li> I was very pleased with the speed at what i received this product. Thank you.</li>
</ol>
