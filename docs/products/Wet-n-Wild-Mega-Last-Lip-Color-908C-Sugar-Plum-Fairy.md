<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Excellent in comparison. Love this lipstick and will order again.</li>
    <li> Honestly, I am disappointed with this product. I was hoping for a deeper purple color but instead this is actually a bright fuchsia, almost a pink or red.  I even watched some YouTube reviews and the color on camera shows up as a dark purple. It is a pretty color, but just not what I wanted or expected.</li>
    <li> This lipstick for me my tone dark skin african american is perfect in but it is good for all tone . It my come off darker on light skin.</li>
    <li> The Sugar Plum Fairy shade went on a bit lighter and brighter than I expected, but it turned out to be a beautiful magenta-like color.  Other than the shade being lighter than I planned, I am happy with my purchase.  It was a bit tough to put on, so I used a dab of lip balm first and then it went on just fine.  It definitely gives me a sassy/pouty look.  I held the lipstick to my lips for comparison.</li>
    <li> Beautiful color.  doesn&#x27;t smudge easily.  Goes on nicely.  no complaints.</li>
    <li> Beautiful lip color on women of color. I love it.</li>
    <li> Color looks great on a brown-skin African American.</li>
    <li> It depends on what your skin color is. I was hoping it will be a little darker but I&#x27;m tan in color and it still looks red on my lips :/</li>
    <li> Great lipstick..was expecting it to be poor quality because of price, but I love the matte finish. I do not have to apply all the time.  The color is a dark plum, very pretty.  Will buy other colors</li>
    <li> I love the color of this lipstip. Every time someone&#x27;s sees the color on me they give complement me and they ask where I got it from. I gave 3 away already and bought my mother 2 already.</li>
    <li> Great color. I always get compliments when I wear it! People are always surprised when I tell them the brand and how inexpensive the lipstick is. It stays on for awhile as well.</li>
    <li> This was absolutely awful. It looks like my 11 year old niece&#x27;s lip stick she got in her first make up set.</li>
    <li> i like it but it is cheaper everywhere else</li>
    <li> Love the color but it&#x27;s quite messy going on.  Perhaps because the top is more flat than your traditional shaped lipstick. Will not be buying again unless it&#x27;s offered in a slanted top shape to make applying cleaner and easier.</li>
    <li> I thought it was going to be a little darker but it was still a good color, it also arrived ontime.</li>
    <li> In my opinion, this color is lighter than I imagined it to be. Still a lovely color; I&#x27;m tan and I find it complimentary to my skin. Fast delivery!</li>
    <li> This lipstick is so pretty and matte. Last quite a while too. Nice deep purple color, but I was hoping it would be a bit darker. It&#x27;s still a very pretty color.</li>
    <li> Cute color! Wish it dried alittle more.. But It is real cute on</li>
    <li> Will buy again.  Great lipstick.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a cute lip color but it chaps my lips.</li>
    <li> Love this color against my darker complexion. Make sure the exfoliate and moisturize before applying for best quality.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s brighter than expected.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a plum lipstick for a long time. I was about to spend 20$ and came across this really great lipstick.&lt;br /&gt;As you can read in other reviews, it simulates the MAC plum lipstick. This is actually,  better.&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s why:&lt;br /&gt;•It stays on for 8 hours&lt;br /&gt;•Highly pigmented&lt;br /&gt;•Matte and not unnatural&lt;br /&gt;•CHEAP.&lt;br /&gt;*The only downsides are*&lt;br /&gt;-It will rub off even if it stays. It&#x27;s easy to wipe or transfer onto things a bit.&lt;br /&gt;-Colour does fade a bit to a lighter, brighter than it&#x27;s darker application. Need for a re-application is needed after 3-4 hours.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m still surprised at the quality for the price, really nice! Smooth no tug application too~ I&#x27;ll be ordering more when mines is half gone!&lt;br /&gt; (perfect colour for fall)</li>
    <li> Wow what an amazing color.  Goes on creamy  and has a great shine gloss finish.  You can wear this with a natural eye or a bold look</li>
    <li> Like this color sooo much most definitely have to purchase more</li>
    <li> its a very nice dark purple color i love it!!!!!</li>
    <li> Perfect for an in-between dark shade! Just be care pful because if you mess up, it tends to stain for a bit.</li>
    <li> I love it! The color is great. The quality is very well and I will order from them again.</li>
    <li> I came across this lipstick by just looking up Wet N Wild prodcts, because there eyeshadows are the ish. I have been looking for this shade of lipstick since I seen a similar color on Jennifer Hudson and it was stunning. Glad I found it and I&#x27;m glad it&#x27;s cheap too, tried looking for it in the store to save a 1.50 but oh well I know where it&#x27;s at now.</li>
    <li> I was excited for this shade but what I got was really bad quality.</li>
    <li> Pops on my dark skin! People constantly ask me where I got it and often assume it&#x27;s Mac before anything else! LOVE LOVE LOVE this color!</li>
    <li> I really like this brand, for the price is a very good product, has a nice color and stay long time.</li>
    <li> I prefer a pointed tip.  Easier to use.  I&#x27;ll just have to order the one with a easy-to-use tip.</li>
    <li> Such a gorgeous color, a dupe for Mac Rebel. It&#x27;s amazing! Really lovely and powerful without being too much on.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this color. I have such a hard time finding a color that I like and looks good on my. This was a great choice!! It goes on great, covers well and wears nicely!!</li>
    <li> Love the color better then I expected . Totally worth it came quick too!</li>
    <li> This was newly packaged and arrived quickly. The shade was very pretty like the color of those dark red cherries/plum (as described) but because of the flat shape it was difficult to nicely put it on. The lipstick stays on for a couple of hours. I liked the matte finish. It&#x27;s a good buy I guess. :)</li>
    <li> ok this is my new favorite lipstick!  I ran across it on pinterest saying it was a dupe for one of the MAC cosmetic ones (dont remember name) and i must say i am so glad i bought this.  I receive compliments everytime i wear it.</li>
    <li> This lipstick isnt as dark as it looks on the picture. I added a little bit of black to make the color darker</li>
    <li> Love it... Matte is my fave finish! It&#x27;s pretty &amp; it stays put! Color just right for my skin tone.</li>
    <li> would not purchase again.</li>
    <li> Amazing color pay off !  Long lasting too !</li>
    <li> Love this product... Will buy again...</li>
    <li> Love the color it goes well with my skin tone has the creme matte look and glides on good.</li>
    <li> Very beautiful color, I loved it. 100% recommended. puntul and reliable.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in like love with this color. I&#x27;ts beautiful and looks amazing on me , i fully recommend this so anyone. Just be careful taking the top off and putting it on because the lipstick will get on it</li>
    <li> i just noticed, i cam get it at rite aid so the shipping for this was unnecessary. plus i thought it was way darker but it wasn&#x27;t. i found what i was looking for at the store which is about 5 mins from my house.</li>
    <li> You only need to reapply if you drink through a straw or wipe your mouth with a table cloth. Asides from that it is pretty permanent, a make up wipe will remove all of it.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love it. Will buy it again. Super cheap &amp; durable love this color so dark purple and reddish.</li>
    <li> i love it. the color is bright and sharp. i just love it</li>
    <li> LOVE THESE LIPSTICKS THEY HAVE GREAT PIGMENTATION AND LAST A REALLY LONG TIME !&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I HAVE THESE IN TEN DIFF SHADESS !&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CHECK OUT MY YOUTUBE BEAUTY CHANNEL WHERE YOU CAN SEE THESE IN ACTION (kimkreations p)</li>
    <li> This is my first time ever buying lip Stick on amazon and I am very pleased its great for the price and the shipping is great :).the color is very strong and I&#x27;ve already ordered other products from this seller:-)  over all loved the quality and service!</li>
    <li> A little lighter than I wanted if u want a dark vampy lip this is not for you</li>
    <li> Im never buying anything from honkong or china again i got broken ancklets and also this lipstick spelled of dog and sewer water ..its disgusting do not make your products with what u inhale please ...</li>
    <li> This is the Perfect item. It came in fairly quickly and is super pretty.&lt;br /&gt;I like it a whole lot!</li>
    <li> This color is very rich in pigment and nice. For a matte finish, it glides on very well. Shipping was fast and packaged very well. Will be ordering more.</li>
    <li> I love this color!! This color would look good on anybody.</li>
    <li> Last very long, and it looks very nice. It is a lighter color, but it is still worth the buy.</li>
    <li> This Lipstick has been my fall staple since last year its such a beautiful shade of purple. I think women of many different colors could rock this lipstick. Wet n Wild lipsticks are great (or at least the Mega Last ones) They&#x27;re matte and are very pigmented, in my opinion it&#x27;s a cheaper version of some more expensive brand lipsticks such as Mac and Nars.</li>
    <li> What I really loved about this color was that it was a much darker purple with a tint of red.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Think of it as magenta mixed with a dark blood color (i&#x27;m a nursing major and that&#x27;s the color that immediately came to mind).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The quality of the lipstick is really nice considering it&#x27;s so cheap!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s also CRUELTY FREE!! So that makes it even better!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend doing a light scrub on your lips to remove dead skin so it&#x27;ll leave your lips soft and smooth to apply this lipstick. It&#x27;s a little tricky because if your lips aren&#x27;t entirely smooth, it won&#x27;t come out perfect. It also smears a little bit on the corner or your mouth so be careful applying it. Have a napkin or put lotion on your skin before applying it, so that if you do happen to mess up, it wipes off nice and clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But it&#x27;s an absolutely beautiful color and I&#x27;m very happy with it. Nice to wear out on evenings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Worth buying!!</li>
    <li> Wet n wild is one of my favorite brands!! They have so many lipstick shades, the nmegalast ones are almost all matte. It isn&#x27;t too drying on your lips but i don&#x27;t dare wear them in the winter! The colors are extremely pigmented and they feel nice on your lips. They last hours at a time and I can drink and eat with the lipstick without too much coming off. If it is a bit drying on you try to put a clear gloss over it and it will feel amazing and look amazing. I have tons of these in my makeup collection and find myself reaching for them all the time.</li>
    <li> Great pigment, goes on smooth (according to my wife!), stays on. Simply loves it! She wants other colours! Definitly sa great product!</li>
    <li> Amazing lip color, I am totally fascinated with this purchase. Everythying I expected.&lt;br /&gt;this is a good choice. BUY IT!</li>
    <li> I am so happy that I got this Lipstick.  It looks Great on me.  I really love it.  I mistakenly got another color and now that I have &amp;#34;Sugar Plum Fairy&amp;#34;, it looks so pretty on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sincerely,&lt;br /&gt;Farrell E. Manuel</li>
    <li> This color is absolutely gorgeous! Especially on African American skin. This is a great fall color and I&#x27;m really excited to incorporate it with my fall outfits. I have worn this color almost everyday since I got it so I hope it lasts that long :)It&#x27;s just beautiful.</li>
    <li> It broke off the first week that I had it.  Color is good.</li>
    <li> Like the color! A bit lighter than I expected but it still looks good. It also leaves a stain on your lips all day. Only downside is it dried up my lips, so I had to put moisturizer underneath.</li>
    <li> I love this lipstick!!  It&#x27;s a pretty color and long lasting.  It is a little matte, but just add a little gloss and it will look perfect!</li>
    <li> Not the color I was expecting at all</li>
    <li> It looks like the cherry one that I reviewed and bought but again this does work on darker women and compliments the skin town in a great way. Great product.</li>
    <li> Beautiful color and it lasts...matte lipstick takes getting used to though!!</li>
    <li> The color is fantastic, but it doesn&#x27;t go on very smoothly.</li>
    <li> Very cute color to wear</li>
    <li> very nice! received lots of compliments</li>
    <li> Love the feeling, love the color, everything!!!</li>
    <li> I received my package rather quickly. This is a great lipstick with wonderful pigmentation. I couldn&#x27;t believe how good it looked on me when I first put it on. I honestly bought this on a whim, and wasn&#x27;t expecting much because it was only less than $4. This just blew me away. It&#x27;s just a must-have!</li>
    <li> Nice color, a little soft, it comes off very easy on glass or to wipe it off. but really great color.</li>
    <li> It is not sheer instead the color is very thick. The color is absolutely beautiful on all skin tones. In addition, the price is amazing. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> LOVE this lipstick color. Probably the best lipstick color I have ever owned. Looks great on my deeper complexion. Arrived in a timely manner also.</li>
    <li> I love this color!  It&#x27;s the perfect blue red!  It goes on nicely, lasts, and looks great!  I would definitely buy this again!</li>
    <li> The only reason I have to apply occasinally is because i contined to eat throughout the day... But for the most part it stayed, and the color is beautiful!!!</li>
    <li> The Wet n Wild Mega Last are my favorite lipsticks. Great colors, and they last ALL day - seriously, I apply in the morning (without a liner or primer) and when I come home at the end of the day from work, it&#x27;s still pretty perfect. I have bought $30 lipsticks and nothing compares to these cheapies: high-pigmented color and perfectly matte - a lip stain disguised as a lipstick. The Sugar Plum Fairy is a gorgeous berry color that&#x27;s perfect for fall/winter.</li>
    <li> love the lipstick. This lipstick by far is the best one. shipment was fast, package was good and secure. love it</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a dark reddish, purplish color that isnt too flashy, this is it. I have worn this every single day!</li>
    <li> Hello&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very beautiful&lt;br /&gt;And work well&lt;br /&gt;The color is also beautiful&lt;br /&gt;My sister and I love it&lt;br /&gt;I love it</li>
    <li> This lip stick is amazing. Perfect color. Last a very long time! I love it :-) perfect product! Buy it</li>
    <li> this color is absolutelllyyy stunning. its a perfect vampy color and then when it fades it leaves a beautiful pink color on the lips. its pretty matte and does not dry out your lips at allll. except it does smudge a little so you do have to wear it with lip liner</li>
    <li> Love, love the colour.</li>
    <li> i bought this because unfortunately during my last move i lost my favorite MAC REBEL lipstick, this is a great substitute, not as long lasting but i do love the color !</li>
    <li> This lipstick just like all of the other wet n wild lipsticks is phenomenal. I love these lipsticks and will be doing a review/swatches on them on my Youtube channel @ bsbeautymix</li>
    <li> Gorgeous color that changes color in different lightIng, purplish hues are present and sometimes it looks red or pink. Adorable</li>
    <li> I like dark lipstick and this exactly what I wanted. It lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love the color of this one. At first I thought that it&#x27;s gonna be darker if I wear it but it&#x27;s the opposite. When I tried it, the color became a little bit lighter but don&#x27;t worry it still looks good. I like it because the color is really unique and it looks so sexy&amp;#60;3333 The only thing that I don&#x27;t like about it is when it gets smeared...it&#x27;s a bit hard to remove ( unless you have a make-up remover). Note: Be careful when you eat if you&#x27;re wearing this one.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t get the color even and it ends up smearing on EVERYTHING.  Will never stray from expensive lipsticks again.</li>
    <li> This color is just absolutly stunning and amazing! For my Complexion (Im a light-fair skinned Caucasian) i was pretty amazed and happy from the results that came out :)</li>
    <li> Beautiful color. Fast shipping. I searched for this color for a long time and when I found it I was very pleased!</li>
    <li> Loved it! Only complaint is that it&#x27;s a tad brighter than expected. Still looks nice and stays on for awhile. Super cool color to mix with black.</li>
    <li> Total dupe for Mac Rebel! Omg, I can&#x27;t believe I bought rebel for $15!!!!! Jeeeez.why didn&#x27;t I find u sooner Sugar Plum Fairy???.love it!!</li>
    <li> It IS slightly lighter and brighter than expected, but because I didn&#x27;t desire a dark color as much, this was okay for me. However, if you reapply the lipstick to the same area, it&#x27;ll turn darker. Unfortunately, then it feels heavy. I don&#x27;t like the round stub, because now I&#x27;m considering using a lip liner first, which I usually don&#x27;t use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like how this is really long lasting though. For example, I&#x27;ll kind of wipe it off for lunch but as long as I&#x27;m not drinking too much or in the heat, this will last for the next 24 hours or so, meaning the original color will fade a bit, but I&#x27;ll still get a nicely toned pink on my lips. Definitely worth the price.</li>
    <li> Beautiful color but it does run so i recommend getting one of those clear lip liners that prevent the running.</li>
    <li> I love this color..... Sooo pretty</li>
    <li> Love the color! looks great on me! But the only thing it may fade away after an hour our two. But I&#x27;m okay with it..</li>
    <li> This is a wet and wild lipstick ?! I swear the finish looks so high quality. I get compliments on the color constantly.  I am super fair skinned and its hard to find colors that compliment my skin tone, especially darker shades. This was perfect.  Cant say enough how great this lipstick is !</li>
    <li> I have rather large lips and thought this color would be more of a dark purple but it is completely black! Wearing black lipstick is not my style and does not look good on me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I won&#x27;t be wearing this lipstick ever!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this color, you cannot find it in stores, so was happy to be able to find it online.</li>
    <li> Although it looks purple it comes out as a very beautiful deep red.</li>
    <li> Sugar Plum Fairy is a lovely color. You can dab a little bit on your lips and you get a whole bunch of color!</li>
    <li> I love the color of this Lipstick but I have to fresh it often but for the price that is nothing! Try it out and it&#x27;ll be worth it especially if you love Rebel from MAC cosmetics. I use them together, OMG! Pops so hard.... #LoveIt 😘</li>
    <li> I bought this product because the description was &amp;#34;wet &amp; wild&amp;#34;,  NOT SO!  I applied it, it was dull, dry, and unpleasant. The only thing that I found favor in was that it lasted all day, which if that was all that it  was intended for then it&#x27;s not for me.  Will not buy again.</li>
    <li> the colour goes on lips very bright not as dark as i thought it would be</li>
    <li> First time getting lipstick from wet n&#x27; wild because I&#x27;m a Mack girl but now I&#x27;m a fan of wet n&#x27; wild. Being a dark skin I really love how the color looks on me. It pops!💋💄I will deft be ordering more lipsticks in the future.</li>
    <li> I whould recomended this lip color for everyone . It&#x27;s really great color and really matte. Evertyone buy this lip &amp;#60;3</li>
    <li> It goes on a lot more pink than I had thought it would going by the description and color of it in the tube however I&#x27;m very happy with it. It&#x27;s easy to apply and goes on evenly. It did stain my lips an almost hit pink for about 4 hours after I used a makeup wipe to remove it. That for me was not an issue but I know that could be an issue for some people so I am mentioning it.</li>
    <li> loved color and i received it in a timely manner.</li>
    <li> Great shade. It has become my favorite lipstick at the moment. Cant go wrong</li>
    <li> I really like this lipstick and the color, it is one of the only lip sticks i use, the only negative is it drys out your lips which is pretty annoying having to apply moisturizer all the time.</li>
    <li> This is a pretty berry toned color that&#x27;s great for fall. I have very fair skin and it makes my lips POP! Stays for about 2 hours with normal eating/drinking. Matte finish. Can be a little drying so just cover with a lip-balm!</li>
    <li> Yes hellz yes! U want Sugar Plum Fairy for a reason- great reviews on Youtube. I bought it for the same reason.Hot damn it&#x27;s HOT!!!! Compliments any skin tone.</li>
    <li> It has a magenta undertone and looks burgandy when applied, not the deep red I was looking for. Cherry bomb has a brown undertone with deep red tint which is what I was looking for. It is pretty dry &amp; exfoliating your lips prior to wearing will give a smoother look as the lipstick tends to highlight any dry areas, applied with Chapstick helps.</li>
    <li> This lipstick is amazing. I love love love purple lipsticks but this is something different than anything I&#x27;ve had. Its purple but with a red undertone so it works well for all different skin tones. Its not too dark, its not too weird, its literally perfect. An awesome autumnal color!</li>
    <li> I was a little disappointed when I received this lipstick. Through reviews and information on the color I was led to believe it would be a sort of dark, rich purple, when in reality it is pretty bright and has more fuchsia than purple. The color is nice, just not what I wanted and also not very flattering on me, but it goes on smooth. I&#x27;m sure this is great for other people, but it&#x27;s just not right for me.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a cheaper vamp looking lipstick and this color is honestly perfect, I received it within the estimated delivery date and it&#x27;s not to dark it stays on pretty well for a 4 dollar lipstick. The only bad thing I could say about it is that when you first apply it you have to re apply a few times because when you rub your lips together it loses color on either the top or bottom lip which is weird and after being worn a while it starts clumping on your lips and looks weird. But it was worth the 4 bucks I bought a couple more just because of how in love I am with the color. It may do better with a lip primer put on first I might start trying that. But all around a good lipstick.</li>
    <li> It deliverd fast and its a beautiful colour</li>
    <li> last on me up to 6 hrs it was shipped fast I just fell in love with the color I am going to be ordering another one soon</li>
    <li> very pretty color, looks even better with a layer of translucent powder</li>
    <li> Came In The Perfect Color And Stays On All Day. They Do Make Your Lips A Little Dry So Put On Some Lip Balm Before You Put It On If You Plan On Wearing It All Day.</li>
    <li> Very nice and pigmented lipstick</li>
    <li> I was excited to try on this color. After reading a lot of the reviews, I was unsure about how well this color will fit an Asian, but it turned out great! :D it&#x27;s really creamy and lasting, so worthy for the price!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing I don&#x27;t like about the package is that the lipstick itself doesn&#x27;t go all the way in, so it&#x27;s really easy to have stains on the lid. Oh well.</li>
    <li> This lipstick came to me with a smudge on the inside of the top where the bullet touched.  But the color is beautiful &amp; the wear is just fine!</li>
    <li> Looks a bit darker in the picture, but still very happy with my purchase!</li>
    <li> I was very surprised as how long this lipstick actually lasts on my lips. I have always had trouble finding long lasting lipstick that did not look flaky. And this \\&quot;Sugar Plum Fairy\\&quot; is an amazing color on my caramel skin. Perfect for fall. I will be buying this brand of lipstick from now on.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe Wet n Wild still makes the lipstick I wore over 25 years ago while in high school!  I think they improved the formula!  This lipstick adds lots of moisture.  Can&#x27;t wait to show my friends!!</li>
    <li> I love all their Mattie lipsticks,  but you can get this way cheaper at CVS OR WALGREENS THEY LAST ALL DAY LONG I HAVE EVERY COLOR</li>
    <li> I love this color ... everywhere I go I receive nothing but wonderful compliments from everyone telling me how pretty this color is on me.&lt;br /&gt;I will be purchasing more of this and vamp it up&lt;br /&gt;Fall 2012 colors from Wet and Wild are definately the colors to wear.</li>
    <li> Wet &#x27;n&#x27; Wild&#x27;s lipsticks are my favorite types. In terms of this Sugar Plum Fairy color; I absolutely love it.&lt;br /&gt;Ever see yourself in the mirror and wish your lips could have a little more color? Well this is the one to choose. This is my go and grab lipstick, the one I can carry around work, school, or night time fun. For work and school I dab on the minimum amount of lipstick so  it&#x27;s not too dramatic and for outgoing nights, I use the color on full force. It&#x27;s beautiful.</li>
    <li> I really like this color but find the lipstick itself too dry to go on smoothly.  I like the matte finish though.  I put on a lip balm first and it helps.</li>
    <li> This color is beautiful like others stated, love it!!!</li>
    <li> Amazing colour, lasts about 4 hours but fades away really nicely.&lt;br /&gt;MAC Rebel serious dupe</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE this color. It has a nice pigment, only downside is you need to moisturize before putting it on or your lips look &amp;#34;peely&amp;#34; and kinda gross.</li>
    <li> Love this color and brand!</li>
    <li> I abolutely love it!!</li>
    <li> this product is alright. for the price it is great. I wish the stick had a sharper tip to define lips instead of rounding them. this was also lighter and more red than it appears in the photo.</li>
    <li> Wet n Wild has really been stepping up their game lately because the Megalast Lipsticks are the best. This is a perfect match up to MAC&#x27;s Rebel and honestly, I prefer this lipstick to MAC. It is pasty, but with the purpose of staying on your lips (MAC glides on too oily for me and rubs off too easily.) Perfect consistency. Great color (use it everyday). Goes on COMPLETELY MATTE, which is perfect. Make sure your lips are moisturized before use, easy to tell chapped lips through product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best lipstick I&#x27;ve ever used. Would recommend.</li>
    <li> Love this long wear cheap lipstick!</li>
    <li> Not as dark as shown on Amazon, but its good for if you wanna have a light make-up day, the color is still pretty, similar to nyx&#x27;s aria, not entirely but similar</li>
    <li> I knew the color wasn&#x27;t going to be super dark, but I liked the color anyways. Got here 3 days before the expected day! Super happy! 💄</li>
    <li> Niceeeeee&lt;br /&gt;Amazing</li>
    <li> The color is as shown in the image: strong purple. Once applied, I can eat, drink, talk, even use napkins and it lasts, obviously after all that it looks lighter, but still looks perfect and you don&#x27;t need to reapply because it still looks great. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I love it!!!! Last long goes on silky smooth💄</li>
    <li> I love the shade and the texture of this lipstick! So glad I got it!!</li>
    <li> Beautiful colour for dark skin.</li>
    <li> I love dark lipsticks and this one is very nice on the lips. With a sealant it last up to 8 to 12 hours on your lips</li>
    <li> love color very nostalgic</li>
    <li> This color is not what it looks like on the lips. I thought this was a dupe for Mac&#x27;s rebel but I think it&#x27;s clearly not. The color turn out like a fuchsia hot pink instead of a sexy dark purplish color. Disappointed.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m kelly Rowland complexion and this looks beautiful on me..has some luster</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a tad lighter than I expected but overall it&#x27;s a decent product. I would order again, if I found a shade that I like better.</li>
    <li> Love the colour so much.</li>
    <li> Been a HUGE fan of Wet n&#x27; Wild since high school and a lover of all things MAC and I say this is my favorite shade of lipstick for the fall. If you&#x27;re looking for a deep plum color that lasts and won&#x27;t hurt your wallet...then this is the shade for you.</li>
    <li> It is a beautiful color! :) I&#x27;m a light tan skin tone and the shade looks devine. It last on me for nearly half a day</li>
    <li> I love this color and wish I could find it in stores where I live. If you want a dark purplish red then this is the color for you.</li>
    <li> My package arrived on time and very protected.&lt;br /&gt;I look forward to purchasing products from you again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks so much!</li>
    <li> I was expecting dark plum color. This is a bright pink. :(</li>
    <li> My new favorite lipstick for the fall/winter</li>
    <li> Love it beautiful color</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in love with anything from wet and wild</li>
    <li> Soooo pretty loved it ! 😍</li>
    <li> Great long lasting lipstick that leaves a pretty stain. This is a great dupe for mac&#x27;s rebel except this is more of a matte finish.</li>
    <li> Yes this color is the exact match of MAC rebel. But this is beyond better than MAC!! The color stays on until you decide you want to take it off. Only thing I didn&#x27;t like is that the lipstick doesn&#x27;t go all the way down in the tube, so be careful when removing the cap and recapping it. It was delivered on time as well. Since my order came this has been my go to lipstick. It looks WONDERFUL on brown skin tones. I&#x27;ll absolutely order again.</li>
    <li> Had this lipstick for a little more than a month beautiful plum color my first time trying a plum color. Love this lipstick for the fall season. Cheap. Great. Product.</li>
    <li> This product deserves a 4/5 because the color doesn&#x27;t look like the one in the picture. I thought it was going to be darker like a black and purple. But its more like a purple and red. I love the color but it wasn&#x27;t what i was expecting.</li>
    <li> Bought this because I always wanted to try out the color and I could never find in the stores it&#x27;s such a great lipstick! I love how the color compliments my lips such a great product! I even receive compliments from people when I wear it. Will purchase again.</li>
    <li> The color is amazing and it lasts for a fair amount of time considering the value of the product. I&#x27;m loving wet and wild products right now</li>
    <li> Lovely fall shade, it truly compliments deeper toned women</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if I was sent the wrong color or not, but I expected a darker red, not a bright fuchsia. The shipping was great, but I didn&#x27;t get what I thought I was buying.</li>
    <li> Love the color and it lasts for a good time</li>
    <li> Such a great color! Just doesn&#x27;t last too long and smudges easily</li>
    <li> I was a little hesitant on trying it, because I was looking for a really good matte lipstick in a deep shade of purple. I came across this and thought why not? I have two other matte colors from Wet n&#x27; Wild, and I really like them, although they are loud, lol. It goes on very well. After about two coats, the color appears really well, although it is a shade slightly lighter than I wanted. What I did not like is that it wasn&#x27;t completely matte, so I was a little disappointed. But that was primarily due to the moisturizer I had on as a base. I just need to be careful with every wear in the future. Another negative is the fact that this lipstick (this brand actually) really STAINS my lips. I tried this last night and about 4 hours later, a majority of it has worn off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise, I like it and it does not dry out my lips like some other brands do.</li>
    <li> i give it 4 stars because it deserves it! i like the richness to this product creamy and glides on really smooth! also it has a long last time.. i would definitely recommend it!</li>
    <li> I needed to get Rebel by MAC. It&#x27;s such a compelling and lively fuchsia color, but at $15 it was not a wise decision for someone on a small budget. I did my research on duplicates, or &amp;#34;dupes&amp;#34; as the internet makeup world calls them, and this color was EXACT in shade/finish with a lower price. I happened to get lucky in that there was free shipping being offered at the time from this company. I couldn&#x27;t say no and I don&#x27;t regret the impulse buy. It arrived in about 4 days, tracking was available, and even the packaging was overly protective (nice touch!) nothing will get damaged the way they ship!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It wears like a dream, isn&#x27;t drying, has massive &amp;#34;staining&amp;#34; power so it stays and stays, but with minimal drying! Best deal ever-I stand out everywhere I go.</li>
    <li> I am a makeup junkie, and I actually saw this on a vlogger on Youtube. I believe is was the Head Mistress. She does really pretty make up looks when she is on youtube.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So since it was wet-n-wild I tried to located in my neighborhood,not so successful. I found every color; which I purchased, but not this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will say that it is dark, and matte, so please be aware of that. It can be worn with gloss or match it with another lipcolor to create another look!</li>
    <li> As a underground gothcore band, the Myskitkul Skull Deth Vampyres rock the house with angsty, histrionically emotional jams that shred the soul and plunge the mind into the Abyss.  As Will, Jeff, Sindi and RayRay, we found that we were spending WAY too much money on MAC lipstick!  The $45 we make for each set at Jim&#x27;s House of Wings and Fries barely covers our white pancake makeup and unfiltered cigarette budget as it is...blowing all that cash on purple lipstick to goth out with was killing us!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank Cthulu and the Council of Darkhavenspyrerealm that this lipstick exists!  The shade is perfect (dark purple for clotted blood and vampyre eyes) and it really lasts a long time!  Jeff says it even stays on through hot coffee when he&#x27;s on shift at Rally&#x27;s!  The real value comes in the price!  For just ONE tube of premium lipstick, we can get several of these, which comes in handy when Sindi&#x27;s herpes is acting up and none of us want to share that lip crust.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stock this up and kiss your soul goodbye as the GOTHIC HORROR of the Myskitkul Skull Deth Vampyres entangles your eternal soul!!!!!</li>
    <li> I had to put chap stick on underneath of it because 2 mins into wearing the product and  it cracks in the crevice of the lip making it look weird and like youre dead. I have tried this on multiple people chapstick seems to fix that. But a very nice color</li>
    <li> LOVE this lipstick! Beautiful purple-pink color, I always get nice compliments with this on! My best cheap drugstore lipstick by far!</li>
    <li> Very beautiful color! It came before it was scheduled too, and I have been using it ever since! It works and looks so well for a great winter look.</li>
    <li> Love this color. Will buy again when I run out. LOL</li>
    <li> This was a much brighter color than I expected, and I feel as though it could have gone on more smoothly.</li>
    <li> This sugar plum fairy is great I love it,  I was expecting for it to arrive late but it came way before the estimated date.  I actually worn this lipstick last night and it last for a long time,  I actually had to just wipe it off.  Its great !</li>
    <li> Awesome! You really only need to apply it once unless you eat or something.</li>
    <li> I bought this lipstick for my daughter, she loves it. The color is perfect for her complexion. Goes on nice and smooth......Lady Ice</li>
    <li> My favorite color ever!! It lasts and feels good on.</li>
    <li> I love this color! It&#x27;s so pretty vibrant and very moisturizing!!! Perfect for a bold spring lip color. I will be getting this again!!!</li>
    <li> i love this color it is plum and it pops i also use this as a liner for my mac heroine i have to get more of this color again</li>
    <li> The color is a perfect mix of dark purple, red and pink.&lt;br /&gt;The only downside is the drying aspect of the lipstick, which I counteract by using lip balm before putting it on.</li>
    <li> I like this darker color. I did put a small amount of vaseline on my lips before I applied this based on the comments I saw in the reviews.</li>
    <li> amazimg price, Love the color,  &amp; came way sooner than expected! Overall extremely happy with this product 😌💄</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this color. it&#x27;s just a bit lighter than the picture though.</li>
    <li> this lipstick is awesome its so smooth and pretty i&#x27;m defiantly buying it again when i run out i recommended to anyone who&#x27;s looking for a plumish color you&#x27;ll love it</li>
    <li> i purchased this product because i had heard it was the replica for MAC&#x27;s rebel and it definitely is! looks exactly the same. so happy with my new lipstick.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a dark color and I thought this would be perfect...but its not dark at all.</li>
    <li> This color is amazing for winter. I&#x27;ve been looking for the right color and luckily I found it on here. It stays on the whole day. I recommend it to the ladies that like dark shaded lips</li>
    <li> I love last very long</li>
    <li> The color is Amazing, it lasts very long and goes on smooth!</li>
    <li> LOVE the color of this lipstick. It goes on as more of a purple berry color. It is very drying though so use a very moisturizing lip balm above and below it if you can. I only gave 4 stars because of the dryness of it. You do have to reapply a few times a day also for all day wear.</li>
    <li> Extremely pigmented and rich color!! Creamy and doesn&#x27;t try out my lips! No need to buy MAC, this is a great dupe!!</li>
    <li> I love it its almost black its so dark!</li>
    <li> arrived broken, but I melted the two pieces back together and its great!</li>
    <li> Hard to put on. Need gloss to smooth application process</li>
    <li> This product isn&#x27;t what I thought it would be, the color is gorgeous, yes, but it isn&#x27;t as dark as I wanted. It does not go on smoothly, I had to apply lip balm first and when I apply it, little circular chunks come off and scatter around my lips. It&#x27;s also hard to draw with on my lips because of the way it&#x27;s shaped. It also doesn&#x27;t sit right on my lips, it seems very blotchy. I most likely would not waste my money on buying this product again. Maybe it just doesn&#x27;t take well to my lips, I&#x27;m not sure, but it doesn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
    <li> Bought it as a DUPE for MAC Rebel, love the color. Texture is a little pasty though. Would love if it would glide on smoother.</li>
    <li> Love the color! It was a little more on the pinkish tone for me so I put the Revlon lip liner in the Plum shade under it and its the perfect plum color. Also be sure to put a  little moisturizer or chapstick on your lips so it can go on smooth, since it is very dry/matte. I wouldn&#x27;t purchase it from Amazon though I purchased mine at my local Rite Aid for $1.99.</li>
    <li> I bought this lipstick both amazon and my local drug store. I must say after my first time purchasing this lipstick, im highly pleased and satisfied!!!! I LOVE THIS COLOR!!! It looks exactly like the picture. It&#x27;s not so high glossy or oily like other lipsticks. Its nice color coated on the lips and its lasts me for a good couple of hours. Its beautiful rich color and affordable.  I also use it for eyeshadow and it works perfectly. Fantastic lipstick. Affordable price. I recommend it.</li>
    <li> This lipstick is such a nice color, it&#x27;s a mix between a wine and purple and it stays on for several hours.</li>
    <li> Perfect color for me.  Same possible complaint as with other color - flat finish seems to leave lips dry instead with a smooth glide.</li>
    <li> Love the color.  Lasts good, but bleeds a little.</li>
    <li> So in love with the color</li>
    <li> The color is calmer than it looks.  Really nice</li>
    <li> Not as dark as the picture showed, more of a fushia, but it is still a nice lipstick.</li>
    <li> I get so many compliments on this color is ridiculous. I LOVE THIS!</li>
    <li> Gave it to my mom not as dark as pic.</li>
    <li> These are only $1.99  at drugstores</li>
    <li> Nice lipstick and nice color have had lots of compliments, good for Winter.</li>
    <li> Alright so the good is that this lipstick is awesome,it goes on strong and doesn&#x27;t make my lips feel dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bad is that its much more of a magenta shade than the dark purple-plum I wanted. So in that respect its a fair amount brighter than I expected as well. Still going to keep it and wear it, but my search for a good purple lipstick continues.</li>
    <li> Because this is a tad drying (more so the lighter colours than this particular one) but often to improve the drying effect it can have, I will put a really nice Chapstick/lip balm on a few minutes before applying it to let it set and then blot it off with a sheet of toilet paper. Other than that (which is easily fixed) this is such an amazing lip product and it&#x27;s so so pigmented and beautiful. Go over a couple times for darkest colour.</li>
    <li> Love this dupe looks great</li>
    <li> Weird, waxy type texture, takes a good swipe for the color to get evenly over everything, but sticks very well!</li>
    <li> One of my favorite color! Wet n wild out did themselves this time</li>
    <li> This lipstick is great. When I put it on it last for hours. It seems to stain your lips tho if you have it on for a long time</li>
    <li> I ordered this first and then went to MAC and bought Rebel on an impulse buy. I totally forgot that I had placed an order for this. It&#x27;s a little hard to put on the lips. I wind up doing a swatch on the back of my hand instead. Since I have Rebel, I probably won&#x27;t use it for a while. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll purchase this again.</li>
    <li> Great product, love the color. Needs to be reapplied occasionally if drinking anything for a while, but has staying power and is vibrant!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! I&#x27;ve tried many lipsticks and I&#x27;ve gotten the most compliments on this! It&#x27;s really dry so it&#x27;s a big difficult to put on at first but the dryness keeps it on all day. I was looking for a bit of a bolder/darker lipstick for an edgy/girly look. Oh, and it looks great on girls with cool undertones!</li>
    <li> Omg!!! I absolutely love this color,iit was exactly what I wanted. I have a darker skim complexion but it works well with me.</li>
    <li> This lip color is an exact match for the MAC lipstick in Rebel. It doesn&#x27;t last as long as the MAC lipstick, but it&#x27;s a huge fraction of the price. Great purchase!!</li>
    <li> you can get these for $2 at cvs&lt;br /&gt;but the quality is 95% perfect</li>
    <li> I bought this as a cheap alternative to MAC and didn&#x27;t expect much from it.  The color (a dark fuchsia) is a lovely and perfect shade for what I was using it for (a Beforus Feferi costume).  But it&#x27;s amazing.  It really stuck on and stayed on even after eating and such.  Very pleased with this!!</li>
