      <li>it finds every lash you have a locks them into a gorgeous curl!!  </li>
      <li>This eyelash curler is the very best.</li>
      <li>and this is perfect.  </li>
      <li>Durable, well made, no eye lash pulls or catches and gives the best sustaining eye lash curl.</li>
      <li>Best eyelash curler ever made!</li>
      <li>GREAT FIND!</li>
      <li>Great find!!!</li>
      <li>Best of all it does not cut your eye lashes!!!</li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve had this curler for a couple of months now and it turns out that it&#x27;s great.</li>
      <li>and I am happy with my decision.</li>
      <li>-I am happy to say this one fits the bill.  </li>
      <li>Still a good curler</li>
      <li>Quality of it is good</li>
      <li>This is a good quality eyelash curler, not flimsy like the drugstore ones.</li>
      <li>so loved it</li>
      <li>I will keep searching, because I love this product!</li>
      <li>I just ordered three more!</li>
      <li>I am 52 when you would think lashes would be scarce but not with this amazing curler....</li>
      <li>Now I own 2</li>
      <li>This one is the best so far!</li>
      <li>but this is by far the best curler for the price!</li>
      <li>But on my natural lashes it works perfect,</li>
      <li>Seller was good though at getting product to me quickly and in a sturdy package.</li>
      <li>Most of the curlers pinch my eyelids.  </li>
      <li>Love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Had to buy her a tweezerman after this one didn&#x27;t meet expectations, for the price thought she would love it.</li>
      <li>This Paula Dorf one was better than an inexpensive drugstore one my daughter had, however,</li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>I use shuemura eyelash curler and while it&#x27;s effectiveness is short-lived, it is the most effective eyelash curler available on the market.  </li>
      <li>It has more of a \\&quot;curling\\&quot; effect.  </li>
      <li>I bought this off of the reviews on Amazon and I am really glad that I did.  </li>
      <li>But so far so good!</li>
      <li>so I really need a good curler</li>
      <li>After much reviewing and researching I heard good things about this curler and decided to give it a try.  </li>
      <li>It curls your eyelashes and is easy to use.  </li>
      <li>The best way that I&#x27;ve found for great curled lashes that last all day is to curl them with a curler, apply mascara, let the mascara dry, then use a heated eyelash curler.</li>
      <li>your lashes won&#x27;t seem to curl as easily.</li>
      <li>I like the color, and it&#x27;s easy to grip.</li>
      <li>but somehow the curl isn&#x27;t as strong.  </li>
      <li>However, my new Paula Dorf Curl Up Eyelash Curler has been the BEST EVER so far ...AND has beaten the performance and ease of use of all the others!</li>
      <li>I have used it for about a year and a half now with superb results.  </li>
      <li>This one is fabulous and my lashes stayed curled.</li>
      <li>The Paul Dorf does not curl as fast and as effectively as the shuemura.  </li>
      <li>Love my new eyelash curler!</li>
      <li>Ironically, at about the same time our local newspaper published an article in the newspaper &#x27;Living&#x27; section on the best reviewed  cosmetic tools.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;ve tried soooo many others looking for the effect I used to get from my old Maybelline curler, before they changed them.</li>
      <li>oh and it also comes with an extra rubber lip which is nice.</li>
      <li>and it IS worth the money in case you are wondering.</li>
      <li>Totally worth the money.</li>
      <li>The curler may not work on all eyelashes but on mine they left a much more pronounced curl than I have previously experienced with other eyelash curlers.  </li>
      <li>As far as speed, it curls ok, doesn&#x27;t take too long, but not as fast as the Elf curler was before they changed it (used to get a great curl in a couple of seconds with the old style).</li>
      <li>I have even been able to use it after applying mascara and experienced no lash damage or \\&quot;weird</li>
      <li>Highly recommend this product!!</li>
      <li>Just received mine and I was wondering are there pads on top and bottom and was it supposed to come with extra pads?</li>
      <li>But truthfully they are all basically the same tool.</li>
      <li>It hasn&#x27;t pinched or broken any lashes yet, does a real nice job.</li>
      <li>I used love the Tarte curler, but it seems that it&#x27;s been changed; that one will work really well for about a week or two only.  </li>
      <li>It curls my lashes beautifully with minimum effort in just a few short seconds.  </li>
      <li>Overall, WELL WORTH the wait and (VERY reasonable) price paid!</li>
      <li>and shes a really picky person.</li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t really think of anything to complain about.</li>
      <li>It curls my lashes very well and they stay curled.</li>
      <li>Well made product and works very well.</li>
      <li>I also never felt that it got a hold of my outer lashes very well.</li>
      <li>but it take too much concentration and fear to use without pinching myself.  </li>
      <li>I really like this eyelash curler</li>
      <li>I have also found this curler very easy to use (no pain or trouble getting eyelashes inside the curler).</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried various curlers over the years, and for awhile Elf actually made a great curler that sold for only a buck or two, but then apparently they changed the curler</li>
      <li>This is &amp;#34;okay&amp;#34; - certainly better than typical drugstore ones that pinch and crimp, but it&#x27;s just doesn&#x27;t measure up to the Shu Uemura for this price.  </li>
      <li>In any case, I am happy enough with this curler that I won&#x27;t be searching for a new brand eyelash curler any time soon, unless they change the style or some other problem turns up in the future.</li>
      <li>I did a lot of research on eyelash curlers before buying a new replacement.</li>
      <li>she had a old one that broke, tried some new ones and didnt like them.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m so impatient that I barely hold the thing on my lashes more than five seconds, but it works.</li>
      <li>my old one (Revlon) just broke after several years&#x27; consistent use.  </li>
      <li>This one performs very well, especially with a new rubber pad.</li>
      <li>I am old and have been using an eyelash curler since I was a teenager.</li>
      <li>You&#x27;ll notice when the pad gets old...  </li>
      <li>Curls like no other curler.</li>
      <li>I would just say it&#x27;s pretty average.</li>
      <li>Its smaller than expected but totally does the job, its worth the money and boy</li>
      <li>:) I&#x27;ve had this for about 3 weeks now and hasn&#x27;t broken at all</li>
      <li>Arrived quickly however the curler is too small for my eyelash width.</li>
      <li>Grabs every lash short or long and curls them into perfection.....threw my old Revlon one away.....</li>

<li> and it&#x27;s now horrible (and an accurate reflection of its low price).</li>
<li> And from time to time it has gotten misplaced and I have gone through panic trying to find it.</li>

    <li> I read the reviews that said this pinched them and never thought it would apply to me with my vast experience using cheap and expensive eyelash curlers.  I figured it was the actual crimping part of the tool that was pinching but in my experience it was the part on the side of the curler that slides up and down the handle of the tool that grabbed hold of my inner under eye skin bringing on instant tears.  Like other reviewers have said it could just be my eye shape but it take too much concentration and fear to use without pinching myself.  I also never felt that it got a hold of my outer lashes very well.</li>
    <li> I have used a lot of eyelash curlers over the years but this is by far the best curler for the price!</li>
    <li> With all the five star reviews, thought I&#x27;d give this eyelash curler a try.  I used love the Tarte curler, but it seems that it&#x27;s been changed; that one will work really well for about a week or two only.  After purchasing this Paula Dorf one, I was not impressed with the fit to capture all my lashes, or the last of the curl, and went back to using my Shiseido.  This Paula Dorf one was better than an inexpensive drugstore one my daughter had, however, so I kept it and gave it to her.  I would just say it&#x27;s pretty average.</li>
    <li> I have used this eyelash curler for several months now, and I like it a lot. I have twenty different eyelash curlers sitting in a box... I didn&#x27;t like any of them. This one performs very well, especially with a new rubber pad. You&#x27;ll notice when the pad gets old...  your lashes won&#x27;t seem to curl as easily. But, it comes with spares, so you&#x27;ll be set for a while. I like the color, and it&#x27;s easy to grip. The best way that I&#x27;ve found for great curled lashes that last all day is to curl them with a curler, apply mascara, let the mascara dry, then use a heated eyelash curler. You&#x27;ll get false-eyelash-looking lashes with out the falsies!</li>
    <li> Like some of the others, I&#x27;m old(er) and I&#x27;ve tried soooo many others looking for the effect I used to get from my old Maybelline curler, before they changed them. This one is the best so far!</li>
    <li> This is a good quality eyelash curler, not flimsy like the drugstore ones. It curls my lashes very well and they stay curled.</li>
    <li> Arrived quickly however the curler is too small for my eyelash width. Quality of it is good but it doesn&#x27;t curl well either. If I can I will return it as i only tried to use it once. I will stick to my trusty shiseido or tweezerman curler. Would not recommend this product. Seller was good though at getting product to me quickly and in a sturdy package.</li>
    <li> Its smaller than expected but totally does the job, its worth the money and boy did it make my eye lashes curl.</li>
    <li> I have used a few eyelash curlers over the years - my old one (Revlon) just broke after several years&#x27; consistent use.  However, my new Paula Dorf Curl Up Eyelash Curler has been the BEST EVER so far ...AND has beaten the performance and ease of use of all the others! I did read others&#x27; reviews before deciding on this eyelash curler -- it received rave reviews even over much more expensive name brands.  It curls my lashes beautifully with minimum effort in just a few short seconds.  I have even been able to use it after applying mascara and experienced no lash damage or \\&quot;weird kinks\\&quot; whatsoever -- unlike Revlon, Cover Girl ...I even like its sleek black finish! Overall, WELL WORTH the wait and (VERY reasonable) price paid! GREAT FIND!</li>
    <li> I really like this eyelash curler it does the job :) I&#x27;ve had this for about 3 weeks now and hasn&#x27;t broken at all, I use it all the time. The only reason that I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 was because I wish you could open it just a little bit wider, I like to wear fake eyelashes a lot and sometimes its a little bit difficult to fit all of lashes into the opening. But on my natural lashes it works perfect, oh and it also comes with an extra rubber lip which is nice.</li>
    <li> Love my new eyelash curler! I have very short lashes and it still curls them all with very little effort!</li>
    <li> Love it. Works well. Solid construction. I&#x27;m so impatient that I barely hold the thing on my lashes more than five seconds, but it works.</li>
    <li> This eyelash curler is the very best. Durable, well made, no eye lash pulls or catches and gives the best sustaining eye lash curl.</li>
    <li> What can I say? I have tried EVERY eyelash curler made- from $ Maybelline to $$$ Shu Uemura- the Paula Dorf curler works the best- and it IS worth the money in case you are wondering.</li>
    <li> It curls your eyelashes and is easy to use.  I have used other curlers and this is a step above the average.  But truthfully they are all basically the same tool.</li>
    <li> This did not live up to its potential.  It still crimps my lashes and pulls some out.  I ended up buying another curler from Revlon.</li>
    <li> Update: 1 year later and this is still my curler of choice. Love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had this curler for a couple of months now and it turns out that it&#x27;s great. I will be sticking with this curler from now on. I&#x27;ve tried various curlers over the years, and for awhile Elf actually made a great curler that sold for only a buck or two, but then apparently they changed the curler and it&#x27;s now horrible (and an accurate reflection of its low price). I have big eyes and long lashes so I really need a good curler -I am happy to say this one fits the bill.  It hasn&#x27;t pinched or broken any lashes yet, does a real nice job. As far as speed, it curls ok, doesn&#x27;t take too long, but not as fast as the Elf curler was before they changed it (used to get a great curl in a couple of seconds with the old style). In any case, I am happy enough with this curler that I won&#x27;t be searching for a new brand eyelash curler any time soon, unless they change the style or some other problem turns up in the future. But so far so good!</li>
    <li> Most of the curlers pinch my eyelids.  I have almond shaped eyes and this is perfect.  I am going to buy another one for my daughter.</li>
    <li> I am old and have been using an eyelash curler since I was a teenager. The last several year eyelash curlers just weren&#x27;t doing it for me- even though my eyelashes are still the same length. This one is fabulous and my lashes stayed curled. I just ordered three more! Great find!!!</li>
    <li> I use shuemura eyelash curler and while it&#x27;s effectiveness is short-lived, it is the most effective eyelash curler available on the market.  The Paul Dorf does not curl as fast and as effectively as the shuemura.  Have to use it several times to get the same effect as the shuemura.  However, it does not \\&quot;bend\\&quot; the eyelashes the way shuemura can.  It has more of a \\&quot;curling\\&quot; effect.  But, overall, takes too long.</li>
    <li> Just received mine and I was wondering are there pads on top and bottom and was it supposed to come with extra pads?</li>
    <li> My wife didn&#x27;t like this at all. Had to buy her a tweezerman after this one didn&#x27;t meet expectations, for the price thought she would love it.</li>
    <li> Got this to replace my shu uemura curler that broke.  I was considering purchasing another online but lots of reviews warned it they were not authentic.  After much reviewing and researching I heard good things about this curler and decided to give it a try.  I like it, works well and feels just like my shu uemura one but somehow the curl isn&#x27;t as strong.  Still a good curler and I am happy with my decision.</li>
    <li> Well made product and works very well. Can&#x27;t really think of anything to complain about. We&#x27;ll see how it holds up!</li>
    <li> Grabs every lash short or long and curls them into perfection.....threw my old Revlon one away.....I am 52 when you would think lashes would be scarce but not with this amazing curler....it finds every lash you have a locks them into a gorgeous curl!!  Highly recommend this product!!</li>
    <li> I did a lot of research on eyelash curlers before buying a new replacement. Ironically, at about the same time our local newspaper published an article in the newspaper &#x27;Living&#x27; section on the best reviewed  cosmetic tools. Paula Dorf was their # 1 choice. I have used it for about a year and a half now with superb results.  I cannot however, locate any  of the rubberized refills. I will keep searching, because I love this product!</li>
    <li> Since Shu Uemura stopped selling eyelash curlers at Sephora, I had to try something else when it was time to replace.  This is &amp;#34;okay&amp;#34; - certainly better than typical drugstore ones that pinch and crimp, but it&#x27;s just doesn&#x27;t measure up to the Shu Uemura for this price.  It doesn&#x27;t curl your lashes as well, and the curl doesn&#x27;t last as long.</li>
    <li> This eye lash curler leaves the lashes very curled and they don&#x27;t fall down again!! Best of all it does not cut your eye lashes!!!</li>
    <li> Best eyelash curler ever made! Curls like no other curler. Totally worth the money. I have owned one of these for the last 8 yrs. And from time to time it has gotten misplaced and I have gone through panic trying to find it. Now I own 2 so hopefully that never happens.</li>
    <li> she had a old one that broke, tried some new ones and didnt like them. Tried this and shes so loved it and shes a really picky person.</li>
    <li> I bought this off of the reviews on Amazon and I am really glad that I did.  The curler may not work on all eyelashes but on mine they left a much more pronounced curl than I have previously experienced with other eyelash curlers.  I have also found this curler very easy to use (no pain or trouble getting eyelashes inside the curler).</li>
