<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Clunky is all i can say.</li>
    <li> This is my second one. Works great.</li>
    <li> It works very good that it is mine second one for my son</li>
    <li> I use this Braun M90 all the time, I had one before and I needed a replacement, it works great and last a long time.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a very well build razor (you can trust Braun for that). I was surprised when I received it to see that it&#x27;s not much smaller than the one I use currently but, of course, if I consider not having to carry the separate charger, it makes this model smaller and lighter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It shaves pretty well. Again, I do not think it does as good of a job as my older 7526 but still it does a relatively good job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it&#x27;s a nice alternative for people who travel frequently (or plan a long travel like me), especially considering the price. So, not giving 5 stars due to the size and weight (when the batteries are inside) and the shaving quality but still a 4 star since it&#x27;s a workable option and well priced.</li>
    <li> Works better than expected!</li>
    <li> A very nice travel companion.</li>
    <li> Braun was legendary in making portable electric shavers. although it may not have the iconic status that it enjoyed in its heyday, we can only hope those days are back!</li>
    <li> I love these cheaper travel razors. I personally think they work better than most $70&amp;up electrics. And they last! I bought this one to replace my discontinued travel braun I&#x27;ve had for five years(it still works but I broke the foil when I dropped it while cleaning it) And these newer ones can be washed in water! get two.</li>
    <li> I BOUGHT IT AS A PRESENT FOR MY DAD... ITS VERY WELL BUILT AND THE JOB GETS IT DONE! great purchase!</li>
    <li> Where has this shaver been all my life???  I am amazed at the quiet efficiency of this battery-powered shaver.  It&#x27;s built-in protective cover is excellent and can never be misplaced.  The shaving head is smooth and cuts whiskers cleanly and closely.  I have had other battery-powered shavers, but I&#x27;ve NEVER had one that produces a shave so clean and close that it could be my every day shaver!  Every man needs one of these in his travel kit or as his touch-up shaver at home.</li>
    <li> This shaver was a gift. I already had one that I liked so much that I wanted my best friend to have one too. I find it convenient &amp; use it for running around the edges of my ears &amp; under my nose, after shaving most of my face with a conventional 3 rotary head shaver. It shaves very close, &amp; very fast. A great, convenient product.</li>
    <li> Have used these shavers for several years and find them to be a quality product that does the job well.</li>
    <li> Works for approx 1 year, no razor burn. Then replace the cutter block or buy another one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Compact.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Long Lasting. With daily (or every other day) shaving about 1 year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, a replacement cutterblock is, at the time of writing (July 2013), more expensive (with shipping) than a new shaver + batteries + free (amazon prime) shipping. Something like 20$ vs 18$ (give or take).</li>
    <li> Braun has always stood for high quality, long lasting products. However this one can&#x27;t be ranked in the glorious Braun history. It works poorly. Don&#x27;t buy it if you&#x27;re looking for a rszor that you plan to use it more than for a 2 day journey!</li>
    <li> This shaver works very well, I use it both at home on the road. Great shave and a great price. Legendary Braun quality</li>
    <li> I purchased the model without the trimmer previously as a test and have liked it immensely.  It does a good job of providing a close shave, comparable to my expensive full size Panasonic shaver.  I am amazed at how long the battery life is.  I have used it for two months on and off without a battery change yet.  The swivel cover is great protection for the mesh blade cover which can sometimes be easily damaged on shavers especially in a suitcase.  I decided I really needed a trimmer on my shaver when I go on vacation.  The trimmer does an adequate job and is angled reasonable well for use.  The shaver comes with two AA batteries which is a nice little surprise.  Its easy to clean as well.  All in all, I thinks its a well made, powerful, travel shaver that anyone would be happy to travel with.</li>
    <li> The shaver is the best ever but the trimmer is almost useless. I need to use an external trimmer for my beard.</li>
    <li> This is a very convenient shaver because of its compact size, easy replaceable AA batteries and apparent rugged design.  I purchased it for about $18 to use as a travel shaver only. It has performed without a flaw for the past several months during two extended trips.  I can&#x27;t imagine a better product for my purpose because I have a light to medium growth which this shaver handles perfectly.</li>
    <li> Long hair trimmer does a good job - regular beard shaver is not very useful.</li>
    <li> As caveats, I would describe my beard density as significantly below average and I have fairly sensitive skin.  I have generally shaved with a double bladed razor in the past, but I have had problems with irritation of my neck.  This little shaver comes fairly close to a razor shave on the face and is, on a whole, better on the neck, with significantly less irritation.  I have taken to keeping one at work and another in my gym bag.</li>
    <li> I might be in the minority to say that travel shavers like this actually give me a much closer shave than the more expensive models. The only drawback is if I let it go for a few days, it takes much longer to \\&quot;catch\\&quot; all the hairs so I&#x27;m going over the same area over and over. But hey, it&#x27;s just making up for letting it go for a few days right?     For the price and simplicity, you can&#x27;t beat this.</li>
    <li> Complete garbage, tryed to shave for 20 minutes, nothing. What is this a kids toy??</li>
    <li> I purchased this shaver for use when away from home.  (At home I use shaving soap and a brush and get great shaves.)      I find that it does a good job -- not as good as you can get with shaving soap and a brush, but as good as I have ever gotten with an electric shaver.      It shaves well enough to serve as my daily shaving tool.</li>
    <li> I have a ten year old Braun Mobile Shaver, and it works quite well.  I needed a second one and bought this one.  The design is stupendous.  But it does not shave as well as the old one.  Period, end of sentence.</li>
    <li> This is a GREAT little electric razor... for what it is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a $100+ Norelco and a $100+ Braun electric razors that I use as my main razor, I only use this little M90 for touch ups or travel, etc.  I wouldn&#x27;t consider it as a replacement for the others, but I wouldn&#x27;t be without it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I haven&#x27;t shaved for a couple days, I will use the Norelco.  It is the best for longer growth, but it does not shave very close at all and leaves a lot that I have to touch up.  I usually use the Norelco, then my $100+ Braun, then this little M90 as needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The M90 is great for areas expensive electric razors miss, like around my mouth, side burns, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The M90 will also get a much closer shave than the more expensive razors, which is why I use it last.  It gets what they miss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had the generation before the m90 (the Braun PocketGo 370) for years (maybe 10 years!) and it finally just died, so I ordered this m90 and it appears to be the exact same thing (down to every detail).  No changes in 10+ years because, it works!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For $20, I wouldn&#x27;t expect this to last more than a year or two and I would be happy to buy a new one every year if needed.  That said, if this one lasts for 10+ years like my last one did, that would be super impressive and speak to the quality of the Braun brand.  I have also had my $100+ Braun for almost 10 years now too.  They make great products that last a long time.</li>
    <li> This replaces one my boyfriend has had for about 15 years. He loves the fact that it can travel anywhere. Hoping he gets 15 years out of this one too.</li>
    <li> I bought this razor for the occasional weekend away and for those other times where I don&#x27;t feel like using a blade and shaving cream.  I also bought it for touching spots under the nose and around the chin and lips where a regular razor misses.    When I received the product, it looked nice and seemed like it was well constructed.  It didn&#x27;t have a cheap Chinese product feel.    I first tried shaving a 3 day old beard.  I shaved with the grain and found that it wasn&#x27;t doing anything, just making noises like it was.  I tried against the grain and it started removing hair, but was pulling a lot, causing me pain and was very slow.  I figured 3 days is probably too much so I then tried a 2 day old beard and it was the same story.    I finally tried it on a beard that was less than a day old and too my surprise the razor continued to not really do anything when shaving with the grain.  Unfortunately, shaving against the grain was still slow, splotchy and painful.  I actually felt scared to use it on my neck because it was pulling hairs so much.    All in all, this razor did nothing for me shaving with the grain and against the grain it was a horrible experience.  So really there&#x27;s no reason for me to use this over a blade and shaving cream.    I will say that I do have a thicker than average beard, but a one day old beard any razor should be able to handle.  What&#x27;s the use if it can&#x27;t even maintain a five o&#x27;clock shadow look.  I returned this product to Amazon and would definitely not recommend it.</li>
    <li> Bought on sale. It works. Like it better than the Panasonic product in the same price range, but both do the job. I just think this one shaves a little smoother.</li>
    <li> Fantastic Razor for the price. I keep this one in my locker at work. It&#x27;s small, seems very durable and works well.</li>
    <li> I am a blade shaver but I wanted to try an electric thinking it would save me time in the morning and less of a mess. Well, this one was not the one to try. It barely cuts anything and if a hair gets longer than a 3/16ths of an inch it simply will not be cut. I even bought a pre-shave lotion, and not even that helped. I think I have a money-back guarantee and I think I will use it.</li>
    <li> This shaver is really nice and handy. For this price there is no one like this. I have two. One was bought in 2007 and still works well. I have bought another to have a replacement and also use it in my car. I recommend it.</li>
    <li> This has to be the best shaver for the price you pay for it you can&#x27;t beat it.I hardly ever use my battery operated  shaver since I got this one trust me I give it five stars.</li>
    <li> This is the best shaver I have ever had. The first M90 I bought lasted me 2 1/2 years, and I used it every day. That&#x27;s why I bought another one.  Great product, unbelievable price.</li>
    <li> I bought this razor to take on a round-the-world trip. I was sold because it&#x27;s small, simple and battery-powered. It seemed to provide a decent shave, but I didn&#x27;t get the opportunity to really test it out because it died on about the third use, while I was in Iceland. I would have returned it but obviously that&#x27;s pretty difficult while traveling long-term.  Plus side: I got really good at using disposable razors!</li>
    <li> This mobile shaver is as advertised.  I originally decided to buy it based on a Consumer Reports review.  Amazon.com had one available at a good price and it arrived in a few days.  Excellent service from Amazon, as usual.  It&#x27;s not the closest shave, as explained in the CR review, but it is adequate for a travel shaver and runs on two AA batteries.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t shave that close but it&#x27;s portable.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like to give negative reviews but  it&#x27;s important to give both the good and bad and this razor bites!      Really, it bites you and regardless of how hard you try to make the razor actually cut your &#x27;5 oclock shadow&#x27; it doesn&#x27;t.    I had to call down to the hotel operator and have a razor brought to my room as I literally could not get this razor to cut anything.    I thought that based upon it being a Braun that it would be a good razor... easy to get sucked into buying this razor based upon the price.    Beware of this electric &#x27;biter&#x27;.</li>
    <li> I purchased this travel shaver because I have a Braun Series 7 for home use and I like it.  I needed something lighter and smaller for travel and this one seemed to fit the bill.  I like the idea of using &amp;#34;AA&amp;#34; batteries instead of having to lug around (and potentially lose) yet another power cord.  This is not a shaver for everyday use, but for a back-up unit or a one or two week trip it did a great job plus it fits in my travel kit nicely.  Kinda loud, but it works well enough that you only have to have it on for a few minutes.  I like Braun products in general, and the price of this shaver is fair, assuming it works for a few years as a travel shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: recommended&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;September 2011 UPDATE:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had this shaver for about a year and a half now and I still think it is a great value.  I have taken it all over the world a couple of times now and the motor is still working strong.  The only problem is the foil.  After about 25 hours of use it wore out. I couldn&#x27;t use my Braun on my last trip due to the foil wear.  I was relegated to a razor and cream for a week...yikes, razor burn made me miss my Braun shaver oh so much. I bought another foil for $11 with free shipping on Amazon so I am all ready for my next trip.  Still a fine travel shaver, just keep an eye on the foil and replace it immediately upon signs of wear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;April 2014 UPDATE:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This little monster keeps on going and going. Motor is still as strong as when I bought it and regular maintenance keeps it if fine working condition. I am upgrading my review to HIGHLY RECOMMENDED&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;February 2015 UPDATE:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another 8 trips since my last review, a battery refresh, and this razor just keeps on going! Couldn&#x27;t be happier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;May 2017 Update:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Countless trips around the world now with this mighty little razor and not a single problem. I installed a new screen and batteries when needed (not very often) and it just keeps on going.</li>
    <li> As one who shaves his head I have used the old Braun 370 for final/closeness touchups during the day for several years and was very pleased. It finally died. I was disappointed to discover that the 370 was no longer available and read some bad reviews on the M70 replacement. Regardless, I decided to give the M90 a try and so far am very pleased.</li>
    <li> Took this to Europe for 11 days &#x3D; extra batteries that I didn&#x27;t have to use. Performance exceeded expectations.  Had an old on purchased in Amsterdam several years ago for a lot more money.</li>
    <li> Love this shaver.  My previous one (Pocket 370) used for 10 years.</li>
    <li> Barely works for 5 o&#x27;clock shadow with half a dozen passes. Utterly worthless for anything more.</li>
    <li> After dropping my first one and suffering through a lesser brand, I returned to the excellent Braun model. No regrets, and Amazon got here quickly and efficiently, as usual.  Great shaver, great way to shop.</li>
    <li> Excellent shaver, my best one so far, a little quieter than ES3831k, I really love it.</li>
    <li> Great price. Works as designed.</li>
    <li> I bought this so that I would not have to take my other new shaver on trips.  As it turns out, this one works even better!  The smart foil catches more of the odd growing hairs.  Great shaver!!</li>
    <li> To be fair, I had the discontinued P-70 model which is essentially the same.  The razor did work at first, but easily took 5 times longer to shave than my full-size Braun Shaver.  But then when it wore out, it did so very quickly without warning.  I was left traveling with no working shaver.  Even an hour could not produce a shave.  I&#x27;m going to try a rotary shaver next.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a razor to use everyday then this is not for you. You really need to go spend some more money and buy a better unit. But if you&#x27;re looking for a razor that you can keep in the car and use in \\&quot;emergency situations\\&quot;, this thing is pretty great. It runs on regular batteries, so you don&#x27;t have to worry about it being charged.     It does a pretty decent job too - not like my at home Braun unit, but it gets pretty close (some spots require a few extra passes) and it may occasionally \\&quot;bite\\&quot; on longer hairs. But it&#x27;s saved me a few times when I thought I didn&#x27;t have to shave, but then remembered about a meeting I had previously forgotten about.</li>
    <li> I bought this little razor specifically for traveling and I have not been disappointed.  It is very well made and seems to run a long time on one set of AA batteries.      The design is smart in that 1) the delicate foil is protected by a intergrated cover that cannot fall off or be lost and 2) the switch cannot accidentally be turned on if the cover is in place.  With other travel razors I have had, the foil got damaged inside my toilet case when the cover fell off and/or the switch came on accidentally and the batteries got used up.    This razor provides a good smooth shave and the nice pop out trimmer takes care of the longer hairs that the foil cannot get as the other reviewers have mentioned.    As nice as this razor is, though, I would not use it for everyday shaving because it runs off AA batteries and it takes me longer to shave with this razor than it does with my normal electric razor.    UPDATE: There is no replacement foil available for this razor.  I had to throw the whole thing away when my foil got a hole in it.  What a waste.</li>
    <li> Took the shaver on a trip overseas.&lt;br /&gt;Worked great and was most convenient to use.&lt;br /&gt;Also used the Kyoku Pre Shave Optimizer.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend it as well.</li>
    <li> I have been on the fence regarding purchasing my son his first razor. I went back and forth with all the expensive models until I got so frustrated I came across this shaver to just hold me over till I decided. Well they work perfect for my sons needs. I get the same shave with these as I do my expensive shaver. I will not be purchasing a replacement. The battery I have yet to change. The trimmer works great. Are there better ones yes though I could not be happier.</li>
    <li> I forgot my shaver on a recent trip and ordered this shaver as a cheap travel shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Things I like&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.  Very close shave&lt;br /&gt;2.  Protective cover is a great design&lt;br /&gt;3.  Comes with easy to replace AA batteries&lt;br /&gt;4.  Good build quality for a $20 shaver&lt;br /&gt;5.  Excellent value&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Things that I don&#x27;t like&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.  It&#x27;s a bit thicker and longer than what I would expect for a travel shaver.&lt;br /&gt;2.  There&#x27;s a fair amount of vibration&lt;br /&gt;3.  I don&#x27;t know if the included battery was low, but it seems to go through the battery rather quickly.  Luckily it&#x27;s easy to find AA batteries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it&#x27;s a great $20 travel shaver.  Can&#x27;t go wrong at this price.</li>
    <li> Works surprisingly well for the price. Use it for travel.</li>
    <li> I saw this on sale for about $12 and I thought, with all the good reviews here, I&#x27;d give it a try on my next vacation.  It would definitely be nice not to have to worry about banging up or losing my regular electric shaver.    So I did.  I spent about 15 minutes trying to use this razor and it left about half the hairs on my face completely intact.  I would go over the same area several times and still nothing.  I&#x27;ve never had this problem with any electric razor I&#x27;ve bought before because my beard does not grow in thick by any means.  I ended up having to borrow my girlfriends razor for that morning, which she wasn&#x27;t exactly happy about, but she didn&#x27;t really want me going out looking like an idiot with my face half shaved either.    Terrible product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never owned an electric shaver, so this is my first as I get lazier and lazier. The Braun M90 was recommended by a friend, so I raced to Amazon, read all the reviews and ordered one. It is the perfect solution for a quick spiff-up, leaves my face nice and smooth, and for the price it&#x27;s a wonderful deal. I&#x27;m guessing that if it&#x27;s gently used and cleaned after every use it should last a long time. Love it!</li>
    <li> This is a good mobile shaver for light use. I have one that was purchased during travel in Asia back in 2009. It has served me well. The replacement blade and screens costs as much as this new model. If you have one of these, next time you need to get a new blade or screen, buy a new shaver.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m deployed to the desert right now, and this little guy has been a blessing. Obviously it can&#x27;t get as close as a normal straight razor can, but if you have a baby-face like mine, this does the trick. Takes about a minute to shave, compared to 5 (maybe even 10) when you have to lather up and rinse off. I don&#x27;t really use the side-burn shaver, but it&#x27;s nice to have it there in case I need it.</li>
    <li> good price and good quality.</li>
    <li> The M-90 traveled with me everywhere - backpack when not in the cupholder of the car.  It was my almost-daily shave.  Now it&#x27;s in a rental car somewhere and I hope somebody loves it as much as I did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the shave:  I echo what people say about the longer neck hairs.  I need a wet shave every five or six days to tidy up.  Otherwise, it&#x27;s a very nice, even, close shave.  This shaver LOVES lithium camera AA batteries.  It&#x27;s good with regular alkalines, but if you give it lithiums, it seems to go forever.  I can&#x27;t quantify how many batteries one set of lithiums is equivalent to in terms of duration of shave, but knowing they will work a long time sure is nice.  Plus if you have a digital camera, there&#x27;s always a spare set of batteries in the car!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this product to people with light to moderate beards.  It is effective on heavy beards; it just takes longer.</li>
    <li> Great travel shaver.  Cuts nicely and just the right size.  The replacement foil I ordered with it&lt;br /&gt;did not travel well due to packaging.  Foil severely bent in transit - not worth returning.....</li>
    <li> These inexpensive portable electric razors are light, but efficient. They have the benefit of running on two AA batteries, so if you travel to 220 volt countries, you don&#x27;t have to worry about charging.  The batteries last about six months. My prior razor suffered a nick in the foil, and it was cheaper to buy a new razor than to try and replace the foil. Its light weight and compact size make it easy to use.  Get the M-90 model that has the groomer attached.</li>
    <li> I tossed out my MUCH MORE expensive multi-bladed Panasonic electric shaver for this one.  I already owned a Braun P-70 mobile shaver and it works great.  The M90 is identical from what I can see (see photo).  I just wish vendors would stop shipping alkaline batteries.  These have poor shelf stability and can greatly reduce the initial customer experience if the batteries have lost power from sitting around.  Drop in some lithium AA batteries and you will see what I mean.  So now I have two mobile shavers, one for travel and one at home and both for easily less than half the cost of what I paid for the Panasonic.</li>
    <li> This is the second Braun Mobile Shaver that I have purchased.  The first was for our nephew.  He is in medical school and loves having something so lightweight and handy so he can \\&quot;freshen up\\&quot; when he has long hours at the hospital.  The second shaver was for my husband.  He keeps it in his car in case his morning shave didn&#x27;t totally do the trick :-)  The design is great and the shaver performs well!  A very nice gift!</li>
    <li> This shaver is light weight, well made, and very affordable. Does the trick so don&#x27;t hesitate to purchase if you are looking for a travel shaver, need one but can&#x27;t afford much, or just need a quick touch up shaver that you keep at work or take to the gym.</li>
    <li> I was using this ancient piece of junk that was probably new when the Berlin wall fell. It exploded on my face during it&#x27;s final voyage. I ordered this guy here, the M90. Came within 3 days, pretty sweet. I had no idea what shaving was supposed to feel like before I used this. My cold war cutter always left stubble, but this thing makes my face feel like a baby&#x27;s ass. Another cool part that they don&#x27;t mention in the product description is that there is a little brush in the base of the thing that pops out and you can use it to clean out the device. Would&#x27;ve been handy in my Reagan Rover. My only problem with it is the little trimmer. It slides out from the side up there, and its absolutely perfect for reaching those hard to get places, like right under your nose, or when trying to sculpt your immaculate sideburns, not so perfect when trying to trim your whole face. Kind of like trying to mow your lawn with a pair of scissors. Even my (insert early 90&#x27;s shaver pun here) had a trimmer that was the same length as the shaver. Even so, highly reccomended to anyone looking for a good travel razor at a low low low price.</li>
    <li> Not worth it even for 1 day stubble.  Doesn&#x27;t provide a smooth shave like a blade.  Multiple passes will cause irritarion unless you have a rough skin. May be need to buy a costlier version.</li>
    <li> My husband is in the military, currently serving in Afghanistan. He loves this item, he can throw it in his pocket on missions and it only takes batteries so no need for plug in adapters.</li>
    <li> I purchased the Braun M90 Mobile Shaver for my budding teenage son for Christmas. When he finally grew enough hair on his face to make it worthwhile to use the shaver (now March), the shaver didn&#x27;t even work.  It removed absolutely no hair from his face.  Are you kidding me?  What a disappointment and a waste of money. I recommend this product to NO ONE.  Unfortunately, we have passed our \\&quot;return by\\&quot; date and am stuck with this useless piece of equipment. In addition, I&#x27;m now stuck with the \\&quot;clean and renew\\&quot; refills for the shaver.  I&#x27;ve purchased several items from Amazon and for the most part have been pleased, but this purchase not so much.</li>
    <li> This is the second Braun razor that I have gotten. The new one performs very well. I used my first one for about 4 years and I hope to get the same performance from this one. I do think that the trimmer is worthless for trimming so I never use it. Good product</li>
    <li> Great razor.  Always close shave but no nicking.  Easy to clean.  Dry or wet.  Even works well when used in the shower.  Trimmer also comes in handy.  Take it with me on my business trips all around the country.  Being a battery unit, it is even easier to always have it close for emergency shaves when needed.</li>
    <li> I bought this Braun M-90 electric shaver on recommendation from the salesperson that it was an essentially the same shaver as P-70 except that this one had a different screen.    So far, it does a decent job but as one would expect that most electric shavers do not shave as closely as razors.    I would recommend this shaver for its value and quality but not as a replacement for razor shaving.</li>
    <li> One of the best mobile shavers I have used and is very easy to clean. I am using 2 rechargeable AA batteries and would highly recommend others to do the same. I still have not had to replace the blades yet and I have been using it for over a year.</li>
    <li> Got this razor because I am in Iraq and don&#x27;t always have water or time to shave in bathroom.  I own a Braun foil head back in the states but did not want to take the expensive razor to the field envior.  This guy works just a good as my expensive one.  I use an old tooth brush every few shaves to clean out the blade, it has a small brush but the tooth brush is quicker.  Batteries last but keep a good stock on hand, AA&#x27;s are easy to pack with your gear.  The built in cover is great.  I will have another (maybe even this one) on my next deployment.</li>
    <li> I bought this for when I travel. I wanted something small and without a power cord. After using this a dozen or so times I am not disapointed.</li>
    <li> Much more shaver than I expected for the price. Just the perfect size for travel. Shaves as close as my more expensive Braun although not as fast. Have not had it long enough yet to attest to it&#x27;s durability but for the price one could not expect to much. Extremly happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a fan of this device; though, I had my suspicions that this product would not cut the...hairs on my face:    1. Battery Life- this thing has delivered 5 powerful shaves on the same batteries. And, I know what you&#x27;re thinking \\&quot;that doesn&#x27;t sound like a lot...\\&quot; Right? Well just think about how little you know about how intensive my shaves are. I go over my face for about 10 minutes to maintain this smooth baby face. Next, I want you to think about how often you shave: once a day? ...You&#x27;ll get a business week&#x27;s worth of a smooth face for one set of batteries. Any less? You get the idea.    2. Utility- \\&quot;Am I going to be able to trim an unsightly strip of freakishly long sideburn hairs with the M90?\\&quot; That was me asking myself a question about this product before I bought it. Now, I can answer truthfully with \\&quot;Yes.\\&quot; Now, to be fair, I don&#x27;t know if everyone will find the same utility in this shaver, but I&#x27;M ABLE TO TRIM MY NOSE HAIRS WITH THIS THING. Yeah, I&#x27;ve got a medium-large size nose. What about it?    3. Price- Just kidding... I wasn&#x27;t worried about the price.    Conclusion: I feel good about owning this shaver; and, I feel good that I didn&#x27;t pay more money than I needed to. It&#x27;s the ultimate travel shaver that I&#x27;ve found.</li>
    <li> This is the second one I&#x27;ve bought, so you can tell I was satisfied. The shaver generally works well, and regular AA batteries last pretty long. The reason I bought the second one is the following: after several years, the foil tore in two places (this I would consider normal after such a long time), and a replacement foil with cutting block would have been just as expensive as buying a new one. This shouldn&#x27;t be the case, the replacement parts shouldn&#x27;t be that expensive I think. But otherwise, a good purchase.</li>
    <li> my husband has used this shaver for years. it was great for use as a long haul truck driver. now that he is not driving, it is still the only one he will use.  very affordable.  just as cheap to buy a new one as it is to buy replacement parts.</li>
    <li> This shaver has many features for the price but it does not shave very well, the basic requirement.  Multiple passes still would not cut cleanly and I had to switch to a blade unit during my overseas vacation.  I would not recommend this shaver to friends.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B002TQ4AO0 Braun M90  Mobile Shaver, Silver, 1]]  I GOT THIS LITTLE BEAUTY IN MAY.  USED IT 2-4 TIMES A WEEK ON AN AVERAGE BEARD, ON THE WAY TO WORK IN THE CAR, ESP WHEN RUNNING LATE. I WAS VERY SATISFIED WITH IT.  THEN IN EARLY SEPTEMBER IT BEGAN TO CUT POORLY.  BY SEPTEMBER 15TH, NADA.  THE BRAUN WEBSITE SAYS A FOIL AND CUTTING BLOCK SHOULD LAST ABOUT A YEAR.  DON&#x27;T KNOW IF THAT APPLIES TO THIS LITTLE PORTABLE UNIT.    I AM TEMPTED TO GET A NEW FOIL/BLOCK PACKAGE, BUT NOT IF IT IS JUST GOING TO LAST A LITTLE WHILE.  WONDERING IF OTHERS HAVE HAD THIS EXPERIENCE; IF SO, I HAVE MISSED IT IN THE REVIEWS, WHICH SEEM TO BE EITHER IT WORKED OR IT DIDN&#x27;T BUT NOTHING ABOUT LONGEVITY.  I REALIZE I AM TRYING TO GET OFF CHEAP WITH THIS PORTABLE SHAVER, BUT IT IS NOT MY MAIN RAZOR, HONEST.  HOWEVER, I LIKED IT SO MUCH I MAY HAVE WORN IT OUT.  OF COURSE, MOST FOLKS ON THE PLANET WOULD LOVE TO HAVE SUCH LITTLE PROBLEMS, BUT....    COMMENTS VERY WELCOME.</li>
    <li> Wow...what a great improvement on the last Braun that I had for over 10 years. It was cheaper to buy a new one than it was to replace the screen. This one is smooth and really powerful. Great job Braun. And this vendor had it to me in a couple of days even though I didn&#x27;t pay extra. Good job to them as well!</li>
    <li> This product works very well. The batteries last long hours. No problem with it whatsoever. I bought one for my brother who loves his too.</li>
    <li> Bought one of these several months ago and love it.   This one is for the RV, so I&#x27;ll always have one with me.  I recommend them!</li>
    <li> Good product. Reasonable price. Shave pretty close comparing to other shaver 3 times the price. I would recommend to friends.</li>
    <li> it doesn&#x27;t cost a bundle, don&#x27;t expect it works same as a  hundred dollars shaver but traveling with it, its real handie</li>
    <li> For the price it is a convenient shaver for emergency uses and overnight travels. You are not going to get the perfect shave however you will look good. Small, lightweight and easy to use. Probably is underpowered for a guy who has a thick course beard.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s hard to believe that some of the reviewers used the same M-90 that I did. A few weeks ago I lost all my luggage (including my Panasonic ES-LA63) in a ferry accident in the Philippians. I felt lucky to come across the Braun M90 in the airport. My previous Braun worked quite well and this unit looked well designed. Unfortunately, this unit shaves very poorly in both dry and wet conditions, with or without shaving cream. It was practically useless and you will likely be happier with the $9.99 shavers available at CVS. When I got home, I bought another Panasonic ES-LA63 which is quite light and gives me the best shave ever.</li>
    <li> The Braun M90 M0vile Razon is an excellent by for the price.  This is the second one I have bought and they usually last about 2 years before the blades start to dull.  I paid $10 for my first one in a super store and could only find another one on Amazon.com with a price of $18.00.  For a quick, economical shave the M90 is the best.  Jim Conerly</li>
    <li> Excellent product.  Was torn between this and the Panasonic one as I have a Panasonic as my main shaver and wanted to stick with the same brand but I gave Braun a try and its actually pretty good.  Love the fact that it has a flippable cover to protect the foil and a little trimmer for the random hanging hairs.  Love the travel size so now I don&#x27;t have to bring my expensive one anymore!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a travel shaver and as such it was just fine.  As an everyday shaver however, it doesn&#x27;t shave as close as I like but ok.</li>
    <li> I got what I ordered and received it with in the delivery time stated. This is a very good shaver and would recommend it.</li>
    <li> Excellent product, built with quality.  Better than expected, and does the job, the acid test.  Would not hesitate to recommend it to others.</li>
    <li> Best for touch up at end of day for going out from the office.  However, in a pinch, can do a complete from scratch shave and it turns out well.</li>
    <li> When my long-time portable electric shaver finally bit the dust, I researched the market thoroughly.  This one works very well.  It is a little bigger than I&#x27;d like, but the cover and switch never comes on accidentally resulting in a dead battery.  The trouble with all screen shavers is they miss long hairs.  This one has a popout trimmer.  But it doesn&#x27;t work too great.  Thus I witheld one star.</li>
    <li> Should have read the negative reviews closer. This little shaver doesnt shave close at all so I returned it and bought a more expensive one, which does the job I need. If you dont care about a real close/clean shave, this may work for you as using batterys is a plus.</li>
    <li> I use this for various trimming, and it does a better job than any rotary electric razor. However, the bulk of facial shaving I still use a razor for, since all electrics give me razor burn.</li>
    <li> Husband seems to like it  and that is all it counts!</li>
    <li> My husband uses this shaver exclusively, not just for travel. He loves it. It&#x27;s light, compact, and really does the job.</li>
    <li> perfect for travel or a quick shave at home. Real close for an electric.</li>
    <li> Always use electric razors so when looking for a smaller and lighter model for travel purchased a Braun M90. As mentioned by others it cannot remove hairs that grow too long and it was a bother to try and cut them individually with the trimmer.  Found a AA battery powered two blade Norelco/Phillips that was recently discontinued in the USA on a auction site from a Chinese company. I had no problem with selective cutting and one set of batteries lasted a month and are still going.</li>
    <li> I work out of town and travel every week.  I have a Braun 7 series electric razor that I use in the mornings, I shave with a blade at night.  When I saw this little razor, I thought I would give it a try and see how it works, to keep my big razor from wear of the road.  So far it shaves as close as the big Braun razor does.  I have no complaints with this mobile shaver at all, and you can&#x27;t beat the price, it&#x27;s a steal.</li>
    <li> Made in China, for those who are wondering the country of origin.  That was one of the questions that I could not find the answer to before i purchased this product.  For an electric razor it actually works better than most that I have used.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using a Braun shaver I bought at some drugstore 10 years ago when I left my \\&quot;real\\&quot; one at  home on a business trip.&lt;br /&gt;I bought two of these for my sons first shavers.  They works good, look cool, and are low priced.&lt;br /&gt;They&#x27;re waterproof too which is great.</li>
    <li> Great razor and fast delivery really enjoy the Braun razors.  The trimmer is decent and gets the job done, but my Gillette trimmer is much better.  Overall though I&#x27;m impressed with the razor.</li>
    <li> The size is great but the power is weak. Took a long time to do an adequate job. I think the razor and shaving cream are still easier and one gets a better job.</li>
    <li> I purchased one of the these about 3 years ago at the recommendation of another Amazon buyer and I am very happy that I did so. Even though it is a \\&quot;mobile\\&quot; shaver, I guess primarily designed for travel, I use mine at home almost every day. The batteries you put in it seem to last forever. The effectivness of the the thing is second to none - it does a better job than all other electric razors I have ever owned. My original one is still workign fine, but becasue I think it is such a good product, I bought another one and stored it in my bathroom in case I ever need a new one...</li>
    <li> I have had this shaver for a week.  I am a life long blade user.  I have tried a lot of electric shavers over the years.  Generally I got the best overall shaves from the Norelco, but the heads didn&#x27;t last as long as I thought they should have (2 to 3 months) and replacements were expensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I get a better shave from this shaver than the Norelco.  I get a shave about 95% as close as a blade, with no skin irritation.  By late evening my stubble is a little \\&quot;rougher\\&quot; than with a blade, but still no need to shave again before going out for the evening.  The reviews I have read suggest that the key to success is NO PRESSURE.  That is very true.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One big advantage that I can see is that when the screen finally wears out, buying a new shaver will still be MUCH cheaper than buying new shaver heads for any of the other electric shavers I&#x27;ve had.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So... after a little more than one week of use, I&#x27;m a very happy camper with this thing.  So far, no negatives at all.  It&#x27;s quiet, comfortable to hold, shaves close and clean with no skin irritation, and is still running full speed on the included batteries, and... the slide out trimmer works perfectly.  What else could you want in a shaver???&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: I have been using this shaver for 6 weeks.  I love it more than ever.  I get a fast, close shave with absolutely no skin irritation.  In order to get around the AA only Battery operation, I bought a Braun 150 (rechargeable) which was \\&quot;suppose\\&quot; to have the same screen (the screen is the secret to this shavers success... honest)as the M90, because I wanted a rechargeable shaver as opposed to one which is 100% battery.  I received the shaver two weeks ago.  The screen is NOT the same as the M90.  The 150 does a fair job, but not nearly as good as the M90, and takes a lot longer to get the job done.  Nothing against the 150 as it does a satisfactory job, but even with the AA Battery problem, the M90 is hands down, a MUCH better shaver.  Still the best I have ever used.  My blade razor is now in permanent moth balls.ade razor is now in permanent moth balls.</li>
    <li> These little shavers rock.  They are the only one&#x27;s my husband will use and he has at purchased at least  6 of them.&lt;br /&gt;They are priced right since he discards them when they have had it, as the replacement heads cost more than the whole new shaver.&lt;br /&gt;They give a very, nice close shave.</li>
    <li> I think I&#x27;ve been using this model for over 14 years now. I bought only 3 in this period, so that shows the durability, they are tough! It&#x27;s perfect for me since I don&#x27;t have much facial hair (lame), but I guess that if you have a viking beard you would need something different.</li>
    <li> I have owned Braun shavers for 10+ years and had excellent service from all of them, but the full size models are a bit bulky for travel.  Enter the M90.  This shaver fits in my travel kit nicely, and gives me a shave which is quite acceptable. The design is clever in that the base of the shaver rotates to protect the shaving foil while traveling - definitely a more secure guard than the clip-on plastic shield found on most Brauns. The on/off switch is a large button which is extremely unlikely to accidentally get turned on in your travel kit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A point that should be mentioned is the trimmer.  It&#x27;s a odd little doo-dad that pops out of the side of this shaver and is about 3/4\\&quot; wide with a tiny head on the end.  I think it would be possible but difficult to use, but I didn&#x27;t buy this shaver for its trimming capabilities. It&#x27;s advertised as for moustaches and sideburns, and it might be OK for a bit of work on them, but it&#x27;s not something you&#x27;re going to use to chase stray long hairs on your face or neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using 2 AA batteries for power, it&#x27;s easy to keep power up and there are no worries about remembering to recharge it.  If you run it down, AA batteries are widely available. The shave this gives me is comparable to my larger Braun shavers, and although it&#x27;s not quite as gentle on the face, I haven&#x27;t had any problem with irritation from it...unless I shaved for much too long.  Read on for an explanation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its one drawback is letting your whiskers grow.  I read other reviews which mentioned that this shaver had problems with longer hairs, but I didn&#x27;t realize how little it takes to classify them as \\&quot;long\\&quot;.  While on a recent trip I went three days without shaving and this shaver simply couldn&#x27;t cope with the whiskers at that length. I spent twice as long as usual shaving and still only got about 75% of the whiskers - and my face was becoming irritated after that extended shaving period.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The solution is simple: shave daily.  As long as I shave daily, which is normal for me when traveling, I have no problem with this shaver at all.  Now that I know that, I will simply make it a point to shave each day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the $20-odd it costs you, this is a light, compact and functional shaver, and at the price it&#x27;s even disposable if you have problems with it.  I do recommend it.</li>
    <li> It uses good. However, it&#x27;s very thick and inconvenient to carry. The shaver is made of plastic, rather than metal, so it might be broken easily.</li>
    <li> I thought my last 10 year old battery operated Braun would not be duplicated because so much junk has appeared on the market in the 20 dollar range...I was wrong ..... this unit is better than the old ones (I had two)...I can hardly wait for the old one that is left to die so I can get another like this new one....I had a Braun that cost me about 80 bucks and I cant tell the difference in the shave...(Sorry Braun)  The batteries last for months with daily use and the shave is as good as any of the disposable blades I&#x27;ve used....The self contained guard is convenient, it is easy to clean (even washable)... I would readily pay 50 bucks for this performance............</li>
    <li> I owned the previous model, the PocketGo P-70. It is virtually identical to the MobileShave M-90, except this shaver has a new \\&quot;Smart Foil\\&quot; that allegedly \\&quot;captures hairs growing in different directions.\\&quot; In truth, the PocketGo gave a slightly closer shave, though neither gives a terribly close shave. But it&#x27;s a great razor for vacation travel, or anywhere you don&#x27;t have to look especially neat.</li>
    <li> I had an earlier model of Braun travel shaver that finally broke after more than thirty years. That one was made in Ireland by one of the most educated, literate workforces in the World. I&#x27;ll see how long this one last but it seems to be a very nice replacement. I use this when traveling and when I need a touch up in the afternoon.</li>
    <li> Excellent value for the money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When needed it is most useful as a secondary shave to my usual soap and brush.</li>
    <li> PROS:    * Inexpensive  * Shaves quite well. Even though pretty much every shaver out there now has multiple foils, I&#x27;ve always considered that a gimmick -- one works just fine.  * Integrated foil protector won&#x27;t get lost  * Trimmer can take care of longer stray hairs here and there  * Little cleaning brush snaps on and off  * Batteries last quite a while  * Compact, easy to keep in the car or travel bag.    CONS:    * Obviously, uses batteries. I haven&#x27;t tried using rechargeables, though -- those might work.  * Trimmer is small. If you let your neck hair grow long, this trimmer is not going to easily and effectively take care of it, like the larger trimmers on more expensive shavers.    CONCLUSION:    * This is really quite a good shaver -- and not just for the price. It is billed as a \\&quot;travel shaver,\\&quot; but truth be told it would probably work just fine for most people as a primary shaver.</li>
    <li> I ditched my high price rechargeables for this Braun. I bought two of them: one for the car and one for home. This shaves every bit as well as any of my past gimmicky shavers.</li>
    <li> It is good for what I need...a quick touch up</li>
    <li> This product will never be a perfect substitute for a high-end electric razor in terms of closeness of shave, durability, and efficiency in shaving. That said, this product is probably a much better travel razor and costs significantly less than those same high-end razors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unlike the nicer (and more expensive) Braun shavers, the M90 has no charging stand and no need for an outlet. The shaver uses standard batteries (which come included) and will fit into a small bag for toiletries. If you prefer an electric razor over a manual blade you might get at a hotel or a local pharmacy store for under $10, then this is the way to go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One note for people who grow thick facial hair - stay away from this product or shave frequently. This shaver was clearly not designed for heavy duty work.</li>
    <li> I gave this shaver to my husband as a gift &amp; he is extremely pleased with it. He is using it all the time &amp; has stopped using his normal shaver.</li>
    <li> My wife gave me this for Christmas.  Okay, I gave her some pretty strong hints ahead of time.  I&#x27;ve always had good experiences with Braun products and the M90 is no exception.  My beard doesn&#x27;t place great demands on a razor, but I&#x27;ve still never found anything which can get as close as a blade.  Next closest is my antique Remington Triple Foil 100.  Still, it seems the price of a close shave is discomfort.  The M90 gives the best compromise between comfort and closeness I&#x27;ve found yet.  I use it almost every day.  I fear a really heavy beard might be a little much for it except on business trips and such.  A month later, I&#x27;m still using the batteries it came with and can detect no loss of power.  I like not having to bother with cords and chargers. The cover and the brush in the bottom are sheer genius.  The price was certainly right.  Great little razor!&lt;br /&gt;Addendum: It died after about a year. Braun makes good quality stuff. I think I just had bad luck. I bought an M60 to replace it. It was cheaper because it had no trimmer. The trimmer isn&#x27;t that great on the M90. It works, but it is small.</li>
    <li> For the price, this is pretty unbeatable. The sideburn trimmer is practically useless because of its location, length, etc.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t have very thick hair, so it works well for me - though it doesn&#x27;t really work well for the hairs on my neck.&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I&#x27;m happy with it - very compact, has lasted for years, the battery lasts a long time, very easy to travel with.</li>
    <li> I should give the caveat that I always have trouble with all methods of shaving having a coarse beard and sensitive skin.  I bought the braun mobile shaver based on the very high marks it received on an electric shaver review site, being 3rd overall in positive rankings behind only two much more expensive shavers.  I have now tried the mobile shaver with 48 hours growth in the shower which it could not handle.  After this I decided to try it 24 hours later dry.  It still did not give me anything close to a real shave leaving me with a 5 o clock shadow at best and stray longer hairs at wort.  Had to touch up with a razor.  I will continue testing with a wet shave on 1 day&#x27;s growth but I&#x27;m not very hopeful at this point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit: after several weeks it has improved somewhat (many people say they need an adjustment period for electrics) so I&#x27;ve added a star.  For the price the performance is acceptable but I still have to use a regular razor on the flat portions of my cheeks to get anything approaching an even shave.  I would guess that for people without very coarse beards this product would work very well.</li>
    <li> I bought this for the same reason many revieweres did - compact, travel, lightweight, battery operated. I used it perhaps a dozen times total, and it died. The motor would not work. And at $22, it&#x27;s not really worth sending back for repair.  When it DID work, it seemed to work as expected. My \\&quot;daily shaver\\&quot; is a Braun Syncro, it has the dual foils with the long hair cutter between the foils. That works well, and I shave my entire head with it on a daily basis.  This shaver took longer to do the same thing, which was expected (only one foil, after all), and it did seem to miss some hairs (again, expected, and dealt with by keeping a disposable handy). As far as screen life, I typically get 6 months or so of life out of my Syncro, and would expect similar from this.  Advantages include you can turn it off and when closed, there&#x27;s a positive lock on the switch, so it won&#x27;t turn on in your bag. (Ask me how I know this is an issue!). The flip-up protector is quite durable and isn&#x27;t prone to falling off. And it&#x27;s very compact.  If you get one that manages to function for some time, lucky you. However, as I got less than a dozen shaves out of mine, I can&#x27;t see me getting a replacement.</li>
    <li> On my second one after wore out the foil on the first--replacement foils cost almost as much whole new shavers--and I&#x27;ll keep getting new ones as long they keep making a version of it. One pair of AA batteries lasts me 2-3 months, if I make sure to soften my whiskers before each use. I have a few flush hairs that have to be tweezed because neither the shaver nor the trimmer can raise them enough to raze them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love that it can&#x27;t be turned on when the cover is closed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do wish the trimmer were a little larger and better placed.</li>
    <li> This shaver is not for Santa Clause. Those complaining that the shaver won&#x27;t shave their beard need to question why they&#x27;re waiting until they&#x27;re traveling to do so. If you want to shave your beard, do it at home with your permanent home shaver. The Braun M90 is a travel shaver. Travel shavers are used for perfecting or maintaining your facial hair. Stop buying shears to cut down a tree.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;QUALITY:&lt;br /&gt;The product is not heavy but has a good enough weight to convince me it&#x27;s a quality product. It&#x27;s not cheaply made.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FEATURES AND DESIGN&lt;br /&gt;The design and features are great! It comes with the sideburn trimmer and a cleaning brush which are both very well integrated into the body of the shaver itself. The silver part swivels around to expose or protect the foil. The size is large enough where it doesn&#x27;t feel delicate, but small enough that it can be hidden away easily. Some have reported keeping it in their car&#x27;s cup holder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;COLOR:&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s dark dark dark blue. Darker than navy blue. In certain light it may appear black. I&#x27;d probably prefer black, but the blue doesn&#x27;t bother me. It&#x27;s superdark with a hint of blue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WHY I GOT THIS:&lt;br /&gt;My current one also made by Braun no longer holds a charge (it&#x27;s been at least 15 years). I was in need of a travel shaver for a long 7-day trip where I won&#x27;t have power available. The fact that it runs on batteries is great. Like one of the other reviewers mentioned, Braun supplies Duracell batteries - not the cheapo stuff you see with other products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HOW I&#x27;M USING THIS:&lt;br /&gt;I plan to continue using this as my primary home shaver as well. When the batteries run out, I&#x27;ll just pop in rechargeables. I shave every two days or so to maintain a clean look. No beard. No mustache, no stub. Just clean cut.</li>
    <li> Excellent shaver, batteries last a long time and it&#x27;s easy and quick to clean. Can&#x27;t beat it for the price.</li>
    <li> Great for a young man beginning to shave. No worry about cuts, nicks and scrapes..&lt;br /&gt;He has been using this for about 3 years now and I will be purchasing another for his sibling.</li>
    <li> amazing travel shaver</li>
    <li> Much better than what I expected.  I had the Panasonic ES3831K and gave my brother Philips Norelco PQ208/40.  While they both did their job Braun M90 is the best in my opinion.  When I used the Panasonic my skin had a reaction to the foil, and I would tend to lose the little cleaner brush all the time.  With Braun the foil is easy on the skin, the cleaning brush can be stowed away on the shaving unit itself, and the machine feels much more powerful to boot!  In addition, M90 comes with a trimmer that made the job a lot easier for some stubble that grew too long.  Philips is quiet, but it is also very weak, unlike the M90 that makes you feel like you are mowing them down.  M90 just feels like a complete package with the rotating cover, powerful motor, quality foil, built-in cleaning brush, and a trimmer.  Not bad for a battery shaver.</li>
    <li> Considering this razor is battery operated (AA&#x27;s) it does a pretty good job. I&#x27;m Asian so I don&#x27;t have a lot of facial hair. But I wanted some portable and battery operated for travel. It does almost as good a job as my norelco at home.     Being Asian I don&#x27;t get a great deal of facial hair growth. It&#x27;s enough to be annoying after a couple of days so I still need to shave regularly. The growth is sparse but course. I found that it did a good job on some of the denser areas but sometimes missed the stray hairs. Just a little worse than the norelco I use at home.    I do wish that the sideburn trimmer was a little bigger and flat rather than rounded at the tip. But I&#x27;m very happy with his razor at 1/4 the cost of other name brand razors. It serves its purpose. Would ft again.</li>
    <li> Ideal portable shaver suitable for travel.  Does a very good job without any skin burns.  Sleek design to protect the shaving head and any accidental switch on.</li>
    <li> Thanks Amazon for promptly correcting and expediting shipping for me! This is a great little shaver! Good things come in small packages! I will buy one of these per year.  Please do not stop making them. I really like foil shavers. My main shaver!</li>
    <li> I use it as a travel shaver for international flights.  Designed well for carrying in my briefcase and, importantly, it does what it is supposed to do...gets rid of my stubby growth.  I am not into that &amp;#34;cool&amp;#34; look.</li>
    <li> Great everyday shaver.  Very easy to handle, convenient and packable. Invest in a bigger shaver though if you let your hair grow habitually every few days.  I&#x27;m not a very hairy person so this is perfect for me.</li>
    <li> The shaver is the right size for traveling and is very well put together with a built-in cleaning brush etc.  But the simple problem is that it doesn&#x27;t shave - I&#x27;ve tried it several times and it simple doesn&#x27;t cut my stubble at all.  Definitely would not recommend.</li>
    <li> I am about to make the highest endorsement possible. After purchasing an M90 for the office... 6 months later, I purchased another one for home and travel. This baby is great for when you are in a hurry and or simply don&#x27;t want to razor shave.</li>
    <li> Most of these reviews are right. It hurts when shaving thicker hair - my 17 year old had no problem with his upper lip, but freaked when shaving his chin. It burned and didn&#x27;t do a very good job shaving at all. I think this would be good for if you need something quickly and you don&#x27;t mind the burning and stinging sensation afterwards.</li>
    <li> It works great. I keep it in the car for the &amp;#34;Oh $%^ I forgot to shave&amp;#34;. It works as advertised. I got about 25 shaves out of one set of batteries.  It doesn&#x27;t do well against longer whiskers, I guess most shavers don&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> Amazing shaver!  I bought it for the price but found that it is a legitimate shaver.  I shave in the shower and start with a once over with a blade and fine tune with this electric.  My face is smooth as a baby&#x27;s butt when done without irritation.</li>
    <li> Size is the best thing about this shaver. I have a tough beard and it does not work very well, skipping over hairs that the even the tiny trimmer struggles to get. Probably good for people with lighter beards. I keep it handy in case of power failures.</li>
    <li> Got mine today; came with battery included.    Looks and feels reasonable for the price.  Definitely nice size for traveling, which I am buying it for.  Everything works as described; time will tell on longevity.  Just want to jot down a few notes on the design, before I forget.    The twisting-cap design is really cool; allowing the unit to be protected, but not requiring a case or a detached cover (only to be lost).  Again, this is great for traveling.    Still, two things could be improved:  - The trimmer slides out easily, but not so sliding back in.  This is because one would slide it by pressing it toward the body of the trimmer and slide it out (In the image shown, the trimmer is behind the body, and so it would be pressed out of the picture and toward the viewer).  Once in trimming position with its cutting head protruding (as shown in the picture), there is nothing behind it to hold it against the pressing finger.  So sliding it back is a delicate operation.  I am afraid I will break it off one day.  - The included little cleaning brush is a nice touch, but it&#x27;s not covered.  It snapped in place at the battery-end of the body, with the exposed bristles pointing *out*, right at the corner of the whole unit.  Inside a traveling bag with other toiletry stuffs, I think its bristles will get caught and the brush is either damaged or easily popped off and lost.  Will update this in the future if it turns out amazingly good or extremely bad.    Otherwise, my rating will stand as it is now, 4 stars.</li>
    <li> This is my 3rd Braun M90, can&#x27;t say enough good things about it... its as good as any electric razor on the market, and its totally portable.  Just use 2 rechargeable AA batteries and you are good to go, never have to buy batteries for this again.</li>
    <li> I bought mine for only 10 dollars at a supermarket. I figured, for the price how bad could it be? Let&#x27;s just say a razor is definitely better than this. I don&#x27;t have a lot of facial hair but if I let it grow out to anything more than just stubble you can pretty much forget using this thing. I am personally in the market for a better one even if it will be more expensive.</li>
    <li> Exactly what is advertised.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my hubby as he likes these shavers better than more expensive ones he&#x27;s tried.  Works well on face and head.</li>
    <li> Warning! I&#x27;ve only had this shaver for a little over 3 months and the shaving foil already failed! There is a small hole in it.&lt;br /&gt;I also have a previous model that I&#x27;ve had for a few **years** and the foil (a different design) has never failed.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s possible that the manufacturer \\&quot;made a mistake\\&quot; making the older model too durable...</li>
    <li> I love this shaver. it&#x27;s portable. It had travel me with to Europe, Asia and US.  Battery life is great. No charging required.</li>
    <li> Amazingly effective &amp; didn&#x27;t have to shell out a couple hundred dollars to get a similar result. I&#x27;m not one to review my purchases but I felt compelled to share my feedback on this rock-star product. Compact, powerful, water-resistant for use in the shower, battery operated, quiet. My skin is sensitive and before using this product used a razor because it provided a close shave. The razor got the job done when it came to the &#x27;smooth&#x27; feeling face but left a noticeable redness afterward. This product gets an amazingly close shave which I&#x27;d venture to say is as smooth as using a razor. Believe me, this is the electric razor you want - and for the price? Come on, it&#x27;s a steal! Can&#x27;t say enough great things, I actually look forward to shaving instead of dreading it. Buy &amp; enjoy guys.</li>
    <li> A great razor but does not cut thick hairs and long hairs. I recommend using the buzz cutter to trim the long hairs, and then using the razor to shave it off. If you have thick hair, I don&#x27;t recommend buying this as it rather irritates my skin because I have to go over the same place over and over again in order to cut the thick hair.</li>
    <li> My son-in-law really wanted one for that final swipe on his \\&quot;bald\\&quot; head before work. He exercises before work and then cleans up for his day as a physical therapist.</li>
    <li> Have always loved Braun but to have a portable razor that is inexpensive yet the same quality as my daily razor is great</li>
    <li> It does the job but the popout trimmer does not. Almost useless!  A previous model had a better design.</li>
    <li> My husband forgot his Braun regular shaver for our 3 week trip and for a variety of reasons no longer uses a blade so disposables for over 3 weeks was NOT the answer.  I ordered this and got it quickly to our son&#x27;s home in CA.  My husband loves it.  Size is great and will be a wonderful take along for travel</li>
    <li> This purchase was my second PocketGo shaver.  I bought my first one about four years ago and use it almost every day.  When I thought it might be close to time to get a knew screen and blade, I could not find any for sale.  But the price of a new shaver was less than a replacement screen and blade for most other shavers&#x27;.  Now I have the added convenience of keeping one in the bathroom and the other in my travel kit.  They both shave as well as any of the multiple other shavers I have tried.  At the price, they cannot be beat.  And they have a good trimmer which many other low-cost shavers do not.</li>
    <li> I bought this partly because of the glowing reviews here on Amazon.    On first impressions, this shaver looks like it would be a good shaver, and has a great swivel design for the cover for the foil, but looks can be deceiving. It requires several passes to shave at all and it is possible to hear it struggling against the hair.     The trimmer is about as big as a fingernail and comes out the side of the shaver. It is too small to be usable.    My experience is that the [[ASIN:B001CS2JEO Panasonic ES-3833]] and the model below [[ASIN:B001CS8BJ6 ES-3831K]] shave much better.     The Braun sounds like a crappy battery-operated shaver. The motor on the Panasonic has a better sound and it does not seem like it is struggling against the hair unlike the Braun.    The [[ASIN:B001CS2JEO ES-3833]] has a full size trimmer and comes with a hard carrying case (you can toss it into a bag without damaging it.) When removing the foil to clean the shaver, the inside of the two Panasonic shavers is flat unlike the Braun, making it easier to brush out the cuttings. The trimmer on the Panasonic is on an 90 degree angle. The cleaning brush is also better on the Panasonic than the Braun though it is rather small.    The Panasonic is curved making it easier to hold and fit well in the hand, compared to the Braun which can be awkward to hold when using it because it is elongated due to the position of the sliding cover.    I did not test any of the shavers and would not recommend them for more than a few days stubble. I also did not shave wet, although all three are waterproof; the Panasonic shaver says \\&quot;wet/dry\\&quot; and marketing pictures show a man shaving with foam, while the Braun shaver says \\&quot;washable,\\&quot; so only Panasonic is evident in recommending that it is possible to shave with foam and use it in the shower. However the instruction manual for all three shavers say that they can be used in the shower and with foam.    I recommend purchasing the [[ASIN:B001CS2JEO Panasonic ES-3833]] or[[ASIN:B001CS8BJ6 Panasonic ES3831K]] over the Braun. Even though the trimmer is an advantage of the Braun over the [[ASIN:B001CS8BJ6 ES3831K]], it has limited usability due to it&#x27;s size; the [[ASIN:B001CS2JEO ES-3833]] is not as readily available on Amazon as the [[ASIN:B001CS8BJ6 ES3831K]]. Not sure if the [[ASIN:B001CS2JEO ES-3833]] is sold in North America because it doesn&#x27;t appear on the Panasonic USA product page. You may be able to get the [[ASIN:B001CS2JEO ES-3833]] from other overseas online dealers.    UPDATE: I threw it in the garbage. Just like the title says. If it could actually shave without needing 4-5 passes it could be a nice shaver. I&#x27;ve noticed that the Panasonic ES3831K is cheaper than the Braun on Amazon. Don&#x27;t waste your money and buy some other brand.</li>
    <li> This arrived with only one AA battery of the two needed, so it wouldn&#x27;t break my heart if they sent a second battery as advertised, but the shaver is so good that I&#x27;ll give it 5 stars anyway.  Some of its features -- the swinging protector for the metal screen, on-off switch, and battery access -- are designed so well that they look like award winners, the overall construction is solid, and above all, it shaves great.  A real find.</li>
    <li> Works beautifully and if you use a lithium battery, it shaves for what seems to be forever</li>
    <li> I buy this one for travelling. Small,good product.</li>
    <li> I own the 7-series from Braun, and it is fantastic.  The foil setup on this portable unit is awful, though.  Don&#x27;t buy it.</li>
    <li> I got the product that I ordered on time. the quality was good and did what I wanted to do.  The screen or the blade got dull after a while and replacements are about the same price as shaver.</li>
    <li> I love this shaver. I had bought this shaver in 2003 and used it for 10 years before I broke it. So I bought another one in 2013</li>
    <li> I bought this as a travel razor. I also own a Braun 790cc and so maybe my expectations are high, but this razor is not very good. It is not effective on 3-day stubble. It takes me 4x as long to shave with the M90 as it does with my 790CC, and it leaves a ton of stray hairs, and leaves your skin feeling burned. You get what you pay for I guess.</li>
    <li> It shaves very well.  The batteries last a long time.  It does require daily wet or dry cleaning, per the instructions.  Wet cleaning requires the use of a light machine oil on the comb.  The trimmer works well, but, in some instances, can be awkward to use.</li>
    <li> A long time ago, I had used a Braun travel shaver which was black, 2AA battery driven, and excellent. The M90 has the modern design and very good shaving power almost same as the more expensive models. I have used Braun shavers over 25 years and I am satisfied. Thanks a lot.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product from Amazon to possibly replace an aging Norelco rotary portable, only to find that the older product still gives a Much better shave.</li>
    <li> Very functional. Does what it is suppose to do.  Simple, lightweight, and easy to clean and store.</li>
    <li> This is one of my very few, very rare reviews. I bought this because I travel every week and wanted to do my best to travel light. I gave this a fair shot and used it repeatedly. From the first use it ripped up my face and gave me the worst razor burn. Not sure what it is, but I just don&#x27;t think it is good enough. But then again what do you expect for something that runs on two \\&quot;AA\\&quot; batteries. Oh well, now I have to buy something for my ingrown hairs and razor burn that this left behind.</li>
    <li> I bought this razor for travel.  It is the best travel razor I&#x27;ve ever owned.  I was amazed at how closely it shaves.  It is well worth the price.</li>
    <li> Esta maquina es perfecta en tamaño y servicio para llevar en los viajes,es muy practica y lavable, una de las mejores compras que he hecho este año. Gracias a Amazon que lo hizo posible</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this shaver for years and it&#x27;s been perfect.  It&#x27;s great that it&#x27;s battery operated using 2 AA batteries, so, it&#x27;s perfect for traveling as well.  I would say that you should get an extra foil when ordering.  They are thin, which makes for a great shave, but over time, it may start to develop a hole and that can hurt.  Granted, I&#x27;ve been using mine for 5 years and the hole just developed.  For $22, you can&#x27;t go wrong with this shaver.</li>
    <li> As far as electric razors go, Braun seems to be at the upper end in quality and price, so when I saw this little shaver for less than $20, I was a bit skeptical.  I was buying something else from Amazon, so I figured I&#x27;d just throw this into the shopping cart; what the heck, it&#x27;s only $20.  What a surprise!  It is high quality and it shaves very close for a compact.  Cleaning is easy with the attached brush.  I like the fact that you can&#x27;t turn it on accidentally -- you have to flip the protective sleeve around to the end of the unit.  Not a big deal, I can do it with one hand.  Very satisfied.  I would recommend it to a friend.</li>
    <li> For as little as I paid for this, it&#x27;s been a nice shaver for use on the weekends and for travel. It&#x27;s a lot easier than carrying razors and shaving cream, and finding batteries was easy on my travels.  Electric razors don&#x27;t work as well for me as blades, but this is easier and goes through the checkpoints, too.</li>
    <li> For a $25 electric razor I wasn&#x27;t expecting much so I was definitely surprised how well this little nifty razor shaved a 5 day beard.  It runs in 2 AA batteries so no need for a recharge it cleans with water.  It&#x27;s a Braun so it&#x27;s going to be decent at least and it&#x27;s better than the $50 Norelco I bought the week before.</li>
    <li> I kee one in each car in case I have a late engagement and hve to touch up.  They re invaluable.</li>
    <li> I wanted to get the PocketGo P-70, but it seems like that is no longer manufactured. So, I picked up this little shaver. I tried it once so far, and it felt fantastic. My old shaver was defunct, and pulled hairs like a maniac, but this one glides so nice and easily, I could barely tell it was shaving at all. (Save for the high-pitched whirring noise).    I&#x27;m only giving it four stars right now because there was one stray hair on my cheek. I ran the shaver over it furiously several times to pick it off. It took a good 4-5 run overs, but once I found the proper angle, I was able to get it.    In short, it&#x27;s great, and I have no doubt it is as good as the P-70. Just make sure you give your chin a quick runover before stopping your shaving routine!</li>
    <li> I got this for my husband for our backpacking trip in the desolatioin wilderness as we were celebrating our 70th Birthdays hiking with our children and grandchildren. Worked great for dry camping also. I like the fact that you can rinse all the whiskers out of it.</li>
    <li> 2017-03-02: I upgraded the rating to 5 stars simply because I still have it and it is still cutting really short stubble, although it still cannot cut anything longer than 1/4 of an inch.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t buy this item. It doesn&#x27;t work and I don&#x27;t mean because it&#x27;s broken. It&#x27;s the engineering design itself. This is my first amazon bust-buy.</li>
    <li> this works for a quick shave in the truck on the way to work but it doesn&#x27;t get the hair on the neck very well. The head is not very ergonomic..</li>
    <li> The razor works \\&quot;almost great\\&quot;.  It give a shave typical of all electric razors, not as close as a blade gives and therefore doesn&#x27;t last as long.  It serves the purpose of giving a quick shave and it is very convenient and a good size.</li>
    <li> The other reviews sum it up with a 4 plus rating  . This is very well engineered IMHO for a $25 electronic item  . I have a really tough beard that doesnt grow even . I just received this and shaved two days growth off .Iit did help to have a mirror around otherwise its difficuilt to know what your accomplishing as it takes multiple passes its not a blade shave  .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Heres another  tip if its giving you trouble or snagging put it under a facuet and rinse out the stubble then use it wet and it will lubericate a tad . You dont need a case though I can see in time you might loose the brush without one . The foil protector when its closed  ,to protect ,keeps the units on off switch on - Off saving from a possible problem there . The sideburn mustache trimmer is pretty hard to use but it does work . All and all it is a backup shaver for the car or suitcase . This is perfect for touch up before a dinner date straight from the office or when you need something that can pass carry on requirements . I am very pleased . I will be using Sanyo Enuloop batteries too . I usually use a Mach 3 blade and I felt this was more work but did as good a job as long as I was near water . If I wasnt I just needed to be more patient and whipe my face clean with a hanky after using it . Dont be afraid to purchase it this is a quality piece the worst that will happen is you wont repurchase . I cant believe I showed up at meetings with stubble for years not having one .I would say its as good a shave as most medium priced ($30-$60)electric corded shavers .  Live and learn .</li>
    <li> Same price as buying a foil and a cutter.</li>
    <li> Quality shaver. Could easily use every day. Worked perfect on a couple of cruises. Goes a long way on batteries.</li>
    <li> This little shaver does a great job.</li>
    <li> I used this shaver and like it the only thing is the brush fell out and I cannot find it , it didn&#x27;t stay in the holder to firmly.</li>
    <li> My career involved travel.  I followed the rule:  travel shaver for travel, sturdy shaver at home.&lt;br /&gt;  Forced by age-related illness to retire, I found my sturdy shaver&#x27;s replacement comb-and-cutter sets more costly than the Braun Mobile Shavers.  So I bought two:  an M90 and a 2xAA.  I&#x27;m using the M90, and it shaves me at least as clean, as fast and as comfortably as any shaver I&#x27;ve ever had.  When it wears out, I&#x27;ll order another, and use the 2xAA until it arrives.</li>
    <li> I wish this shaver had a more substantial comb like another I owned. I do not believe a thin comb will last very long. I am just a bit disappointed at the shaving efficiency of this item. Costwise, it is a good deal.</li>
    <li> Simply the best travel shaver so far</li>
    <li> Great little shaver.  While I much prefer my regular shaver, this mobile shaver is great to take on weekend trips and even extended vacations.  It does a pretty decent job of shaving.  The batteries appear to last a long time, too.  Also, the shaver is very compact, and lightweight.</li>
    <li> Beautifully engineered, great feel in the hand and cuts close and fast.</li>
    <li> Good battery powered unit.  Great on Travel, and the cover really does a good job of protecting the screen.  Trimmer is handy too for those stray hairs around the sideburns and up over the ears between haircuts.</li>
    <li> Very inexpensive quality product it shaves very clean and smooth, it last for a long time and I would definitely buy this product again.</li>
    <li> The shaver does not get my beard very close.  Requires repeated shaving during the day and causes my face to get irritated.  PDMyers</li>
    <li> This travel shaver is a good buy for the price, but I wouldnt expect a very close shave.  I have found that a mirror is needed in order to get every last bit of scruff and even then you are going to work to find the right angles.      This is a near perfect razor to have in your glove box when you need a quick touch-up...but it is not going to equal the quality shave of a traditional razor.</li>
    <li> Ive had one of these for over two years the only reason I got another is because I wore mine out.</li>
    <li> The product arrived according to plan. I arrive in good condition because it was well packed. The packet size was perfect. I recommend this dealer. Very serious and especially according to the specifications llegun was on the page we. I congratulate the dealer for its seriousness.&lt;br /&gt;thank you very much</li>
    <li> works well fast shipping</li>
    <li> Best electric razor I have ever owned, and reasonably priced also.  I originally got this shaver to use for quick, evening &amp;#34;touch-up&amp;#34; shaves, or for days when I was in an extreme hurry and didn&#x27;t have time for a blade shave.  However, I was surprised to discover that this shaver actually shaves closer than my triple-blade razor does.  Therefore, I often use the Braun shaver instead of a blade, although sometimes I will shave with a blade and then use the Braun M90 afterwards to get an even closer shave, especially where it really matters.  I find that it is much easier to shave the part of my top lip that is under my nose with this Braun shaver than it is to shave it with the blade razor.  Some people have stated in reviews here that the shaving foil is not very durable, but I don&#x27;t find that at all.  Of course, if you drop it a lot with the protective cover off, then I&#x27;m sure that it could be easily damaged.  But then again, if someone were to drop YOU on your head with no helmet on, then I&#x27;m sure that you would be damaged also.  I really love that this razor runs on common AA batteries, rather than a rechargeable battery (since those old special rechargeable batteries wore out quickly and are difficult to find replacements for.)  I have been using this shaver a lot, for months now, and I still have not even had to replace the batteries yet.  I would highly recommend this shaver, especially to people who think that they won&#x27;t like an electric shaver.  By the way, you can also use this razor wet (and can clean it in water also, if you want to), but this is unnecessary, since it works really great as a dry shaver.  This shaver is also small and lightweight, so it is also great for travel or for shaving on the go (such as at work, or otherwise away from home.)  The handy sideburn trimmer that pops out of the side and the cleaning brush that pops out of the bottom of the unit are also great bonus features included with this model.</li>
    <li> Uses double A batteries which last for months.  I keep this in my car when i&#x27;m commuting to work.  Simple operation and great results.  No complaints.</li>
    <li> i must say i am very satisfied, clean up might not be the best, but this thing is great, you just gotta know how to angle it to remove your hair, excelent product</li>
    <li> Slick design with the built in hidden trimmer and brush, but did a poor job of shaving. If you have growth that is less than 12 hours, fine. Anything past a 5 o&#x27;clock shadow, it will leave strands of hair. The trimmer is useless in getting these stragglers; I don&#x27;t know if it is the puniness of it or I got a dud, but I could not get it to cut my stragglers. Unfortunately for me, I took it on a month long trip and now I cannot return it.</li>
    <li> I have a Braun Series 7 I use for most shaving.  I keep this razor in my desk for \\&quot;touch-ups.\\&quot;  It works great.  I wouldn&#x27;t use it as my only razor--it would go through AA batteries terribly.  In this particular type of use, however, it is invaluable.</li>
    <li> I had one of these about four years until a peice the foil broke off. It stayed in my truck and I would use it on the way to base (kept my image military).</li>
    <li> Let me qualify my review with one thing: my facial hair does not grow quickly or thickly.  So if you have a five-o-clock shadow at two o-clock, I can&#x27;t tell you much about how this product will perform for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me, though, this is the perfect razor.  It&#x27;s cheap, it&#x27;s portable, and it has the tiny clippers that pop out of the side to trim longer hairs, or even push back my goatee.  It has a beautiful design that flips around and protects the head when not in use and reminds me of the old art-deco designs of the 30&#x27;s, except it&#x27;s not made out of bakelite.  I like also that it can&#x27;t be turned on by accident when the razor head is covered--nice touch.  It has a little cleaning brush built into the battery compartment on bottom, which is also a nice touch, and it takes regular old AA&#x27;s, so it&#x27;s not hard to replace.  I use and recommend rechargeables, since we send enough of our toxic garbage to the landfills without needing to add more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me the batteries run down after about three or four uses, but again, I don&#x27;t have a heavy beard that I&#x27;m trying to clearcut like an old-growth forest, so your mileage may vary.  I am wary of the thin metal screen after reading the other reviews, but I&#x27;m not terribly worried, especially for this price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottom line is that it does the job and costs about the same as a decent razor and set of blades, but never needs to be replaced.  I&#x27;ll give an update at a year and see if I&#x27;m still singing its praises.</li>
    <li> Thus far, one week into usin it this has been worth the 20 bucks. Taking this with me traveling and seems like it will hold up. Never met a foil razor that was quite this powerful for being so small. Worth the small price. 4 star only b/c I would think they can do something with rechargeable capabilities that would make it better.</li>
    <li> Great price, cheaper than the older M60 version that is currently on shelves at military exchanges for some reason. Perfect for use out in the field. Sad that it&#x27;s cheaper to buy an entirely new shaver than a screen though.</li>
    <li> This shaver was received in a crushed box but still appears serviceable.  However, the quality of the razor is definitely less than the P-70 model shaver that I have been using over the past two years without a single problem, other than the blades have become dull. But the price of new blades plus a new screen (recommended) nearly equal the price of the new M-90 razor. Maybe this explains why the M-90 is so inexpensive.</li>
    <li> Super convenient and cuts extremely close.  The battery life is good and it is very compact and easy to pack.</li>
    <li> Received as a gift for Christmas 2014 and after 3 months using it daily, I really like it.  The biggest plus is I can use it wet or dry and find the shave is good either way.  I changed out the original batteries after 2 months, so pleased with how long they lasted.  When I completed each shave, I&#x27;ll wash the head and blades under some warm water for a couple seconds, then spray each with rubbing alcohol and let air dry.  I do that, figuring similar to using a regular wet blade, that helps keep the corrosion down.  The only reason I&#x27;m not giving it five stars is the trimmer is a bit small and a little funky being on the side.  Overall though, very pleased with this.</li>
    <li> Very handy for travel.  Replace one that I had previously.  It is a throw away shaver which is good and bad.</li>
    <li> This battery powered shaver performs as good as shavers costing many times more. It is a wonderful shaver to use while travelling due to its modest size and weight. I bought each of my two sons one for their use and they really like them. It is an excellent value.</li>
    <li> I see that this shaver is getting good reviews from some people and that is great.  But I bought one last year because I saw it on sale and I looked a little scruffy on my way to class.  I attempted to use it before going into school, thankfully it didn&#x27;t make me look any worse, but that is only because it cut maybe, and I stress the maybe, 10 percent of the hair on my face.  I figure although it is not right for me it might be right for some, but if you aren&#x27;t sure definitely wait till you can get this shaver on sale.</li>
    <li> I use this razor to get a little bit closer of a shave after using a blade.  It does the trick, and when it starts getting dull after about a year or so I just pick up a new one.  Can&#x27;t complain, especially with not having to pay $200 or more for a fancy one.</li>
    <li> I was weary of buying this shaver and should have listened to my gut and not buy it.    Pro:  -Battery operated    Cons:  -DOES NOT SHAVE!!!  -Loud  -Brush is useless    This shaver will not shave, plain and simple. A disposable razor and scissors will be much better than this.</li>
    <li> What a service! Order and delivery status was lightening fast. Delivery was quick and the shaver works great..... Better than my old Braun dual head shaver. This shaver is compact, light and great for traveling.</li>
    <li> The Braun M90 is well made, inexpensive, and does the job for light touch-ups.  Using this as an everyday shaver may get you by if you have a light beard.  For anything approaching more intensive needs, this is not what you want.  The M90 has excellent battery life and is easy to keep clean.  It is well worth the money as a good travel shaver for light to medium stubble.</li>
    <li> This is now my go to shaver. It won&#x27;t cut the longer strands, but it does 90% of the job. The rest, of course, you&#x27;ll just need to use a razor for a closer shave. But definitely worth every penny.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a perfect size for travel and yet it is a great shaver despite its small size.  I love it</li>
    <li> For the price this is OK. You get what you pay for. under that context I will rate this as a 3 star (its OK). Do not expect that you will get the performance of your regular $70- $100 shaver. This however is a good back-up or travel shaver because of its size and accepts a the readily available AA battery. I believe by design this low price shaver was really for 2nd shaver that can stay in your car glove box or overnight travel bag.</li>
    <li> I purchased your Braun M90 and was very disappointed that when I received it did not SHAVE period. It operated with the batteries but did not shave a single hair and it&#x27;s new. I messaged you and the answer was not what anyone would expect for a defective item you sold. I&#x27;m returning.</li>
    <li> We like this little shaver because it is simple to use, easy to clean. The storage/travel/shaver head protection are all accomplished by the attached swing-over cover. The foil shaving head is all one pattern of tiny holes. This makes for a lot safer shave than the fancy shavers with the central lift and clip blades that can pinch and clip sensitive skin areas, such as uoopr lip edges and corners of the mouth  This is a very fine everyday shaver. Little side trimmer works well, too. Only negative is the design of the clip-in storage area for the cleaning brush on the bottom of the shaver. The brush can easily come loose and get misplaced. Tape it on or store somewhere safe.</li>
    <li> My hubby had bad rashes after using this shaver!</li>
    <li> Hats off to Braun for designing such a nifty shaver.  But, as I eventually discovered, design isn&#x27;t everything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, the good part.  Upon first glance, This is an all-in-one shaver every man dreams about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Afraid of clippings falling out?  It&#x27;s got a built in cap.&lt;br /&gt;Need something compact to fit in a carry-on?  It&#x27;s small enough to fit!&lt;br /&gt;Afraid of a shaver turning on in your bag?  Won&#x27;t happen with this one because it&#x27;s got a locking &amp;#34;on&amp;#34; switch&lt;br /&gt;Need to trim a sideburn?  It&#x27;s got a pop out trimer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But it fails miserably when it actually has to shave.  Either the foil is too thick or the shaver is just not powerful enough.  It could not get close enough to get that last few millimeters of hair sticking out around my face.  It left a definite shadow.  So I turned on my regular shaver (a Panasonic) to get the rest of the stubble.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not to mention the fact that it took twice as long for me to shave because of how much hair this shaver kept missing.  Pass after pass, it could not get all of the hairs.  And the off-balanced motor vibration of the shaver left my entire hand numb post-shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I highly recommend staying away from this shaver.  I was hoping to bring this shaver on trips and leave my bulky regular shaver behind.  The design won me over, but its performance had me clicking &amp;#34;return item.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> The shaver performs as advertised.  Battery life (for my whisker growth) has lasted through twenty shaves and is still going strong.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my son to use during a three-week vacation when luggage space was at a premium. Nice price and a very convenient size and shape. I&#x27;d say just by looking that the shave was just as close and irritation-free as one from his preferred full-size shaver at home. He says he was happy with the shaver&#x27;s performance. After this short period I can&#x27;t really weigh in on durability, but I will revise my review if we have any issues down the line.</li>
    <li> Nice little shaver, had one for my 8 years of service in the army and beats the heck outta dry shaving.</li>
    <li> This shaver is ecellent for travelling - light, runs on batteries (which last many shaves), well built, includes hair trimmer. You can clean it under running water, and the way it is built, it can&#x27;t turn on by chance (while travelling, for example) once it is closed.&lt;br /&gt;My hair isn&#x27;t too hard, so maybe on rough hair it won&#x27;t be that good, but for me it is perfect.</li>
    <li> This is my second one of these little guys.  Perfect for traveling.</li>
    <li> terrible product.  i don&#x27;t have a whole lot of facial hair so i thought i&#x27;d give it a shot (since there are many reviews stating it doesn&#x27;t do a good job with thick hair).  but man this thing doesn&#x27;t even do a good job with light facial hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;maybe it&#x27;s because ive been used to razor cleanness so this product hasn&#x27;t been used.  it&#x27;s probably serviceable for a quick and dirty morning shave but don&#x27;t expect any meaningful cleanness.</li>
    <li> This is perfect for an on the go kind of guy!  It uses batteries which is super nice- you don&#x27;t have to worry if it has a \\&quot;charge\\&quot; just run to the drug store and get some batteries! Small and really easy to use!</li>
    <li> This product seems to cut facial hair well, but the battery life of the AA battery supply is fairly short.  I haven&#x27;t tallied the minutes used, though I think it would be acceptable if it were at least 50% better.</li>
    <li> This little shaver is very well constructed, powerful, shaves close and very portable.  I keep it in my car console for those quick shaves on the run or a touch up.  I gave them as Christmas gifts; got a lot of, \\&quot;this is COOL!\\&quot;.</li>
    <li> At first I though this would be smaller than my old (and still mostly working) Braun 4501.  It&#x27;s actually quite close in size.  The plus is this takes standard AA batteries (2) and has a built-in foil guard.  Perfect for touching up or when you get to work and realize you forgot to shave. (doh!)  I&#x27;ve been using it on and off for several weeks now and can&#x27;t find any real issues.  Realize it isn&#x27;t my daily shaver.</li>
    <li> Barely any power to this shaver.  Does not do a clean shave, dissapointed being it is a braun.  Will try another brand.</li>
    <li> The M90 as shown is in the locked position.  A silver plastic hood covers the foil and cutter.  It cannot be turned on in this position.  Batteries are accessed by twisting the bottom piece 90 degrees and pulling it and the base plate away from the shaver. There is a small brush that slides way from the base plate.  2 AA batteres power the razor.. These can be carried along or bought in drugstores or street stalls from LA to Moscow.To operate rotate the silver hood 90 degrees.  A 1.5 cm trimmer may help for side burns.  But if you shave your head you&#x27;ll need something else.  The parts are expensive.  If you need to replace the cutter block and head this is about $30.  It&#x27;s cheaper to buy a new razor.  This gives me a good shave and is especially good around the curve of my jaw.  If you&#x27;ve let your stubble go for 2-3 days you&#x27;ll have problems. This has many advantages like all travel razors.  these have been detailed in other reviews.</li>
    <li> Great for on the go shaving. I even used it as my primary razor for over a year. Bought another for work. Does a decent job if you shave every day. Any longer and its not worth your time.</li>
    <li> Convenient travel shaver. Not as close as shaving cream and a razor, but good for times when that is not available. Easy to clean. Worth the cost for the occasional shave.</li>
    <li> Great portable razor.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this thing for over 4 years and it still works great. I travel every week, so it gets tossed around a bit. Actually the foil is still good on it as well. Well worth it!</li>
    <li> My 8-year old Panasonic travel shaver died recently, and I discovered that the model with trimmer and travel case is no longer available.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Braun is about the same size and heft as the Panasonic, but does not need a protective case due to the clever rotating head guard. A small cleaning brush snaps into the base, another handy touch for the traveller. Whether because it is new, or because the foil is thinner, it seems to shave slightly more closely than the Panasonic. I have a beard, so I do not have a large amount of skin to shave, but it has worked well so far. At first I thought the trimmer was useless because it is so small, but in fact, it works quite well as an edger, not so well for shortening large expanses of beard hair. Too soon to tell if it will have durability problems, as reported by some other reviewers.</li>
    <li> Very easy to carry!  It&#x27;s waterproof!!!</li>
    <li> If you want rechargeable, try the Braun Series 1-150s Men&#x27;s Shaver 1 (on Amazon for about $30). But beware, it&#x27;s not rated as highly as this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used this so far for about 15 touchup shaves and still going strong. (Slows down eventually as batteries lose charge, but still cuts great.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, because you have to buy batteries, this will cost more in the long run. (I&#x27;ve tried rechargeable batteries, but they&#x27;re not long-lasting enough for me). Of course, vs. other cordless models, just pop in batteries and you&#x27;re fully charged instantly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And people say you&#x27;ll need to replace the foil more than you should. But search ebay for 5S Braun M90 Foil and you&#x27;ll find the foil can be had for as little as $5 with free shipping (last I checked, from user zorro_fang). On Amazon, head+foil is about $16: [[ASIN:B000MHT2WI Braun 9090103012ARI 5S Shaving Foil]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And the foil \\&quot;problem\\&quot; also seems to exist with many other less-expensive Braun models.</li>
    <li> Maybe it&#x27;s just me, but I have a hard time actually shaving the hair. I wanted it to be a quick shave before work.</li>
    <li> Superior for the money. Meets my need  for a good travel shaver. Future years expected to meet my shaving needs.</li>
    <li> good. Works well, convenient, efficient. Great little razor for a person like me who don&#x27;t have much facial hair and just needs a buzz now and then</li>
    <li> A handy portable device, that shaves and trims to perfection.</li>
    <li> Yes, this fills the bill exactly.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> I received this product fast. It&#x27;s a Xmas present so not sure about how it operates but for the price it can&#x27;t be that bad!!</li>
    <li> Purchased this razor for on the road use, and am more than quite pleased with the performance.  The foil is comfortable and the razor provides a very nice shave.  Very pleased with the purchase.</li>
    <li> I have a thick beard and i know this is a travel/kid size, so i&#x27;m not expecting much, but it&#x27;s not close at all. Added a star b/c it&#x27;s got great battery life.</li>
    <li> This is an incredibly cool machine. I love the design, I love using it, and I love the shaves I get with it. The trimming mechanism works very well. The little built-in brush is pretty cool too.</li>
    <li> very good product. Its better than I thought before I order it. Best price item under 20$ you don&#x27;t need buy expensive razor</li>
    <li> forget about all other models of Braun shavers! this product is just the BEST one.&lt;br /&gt;Very Handy, smooth shave, portable and I use it everyday</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the perfect shaver for travel.  Gives an impressive shave, especially for battery operated.  Even use it at home...highly recommended.</li>
    <li> This was a gift for my husband&#x27;s birthday.  He really likes it for it&#x27;s portability.  It almost didn&#x27;t make it in time because there was a delay in shipping.</li>
    <li> Perfect, good close shave, easy to clean , holds battery charge ..very pleased.</li>
    <li> Not as good as the old 5615. The screen isn&#x27;t as good and the trimmer is all but useless. Why do they have to mess with sucess?</li>
    <li> Perfect shaver to keep with me in the car and at the office.&lt;br /&gt;Does not shave as close as a $200 electric razor, or a blade, but shaves very well on the commute to the office.</li>
    <li> I do not have a thick beard but medium growth. I do travel a month at a time and space saving and weight are important. This is a nice, light weight and reliable shaver. For a light weight portable, it has given me many great shaves and very good durablity.</li>
    <li> Great shaver, used a previous model for many years before it wore out</li>
    <li> I traveled 90 days with this razor and found it very difficult to get a clean shave. The &amp;#34;foil&amp;#34; head that covered the cutting blade was very cheap. I dropped the razor and it tore a hole in the foil. I could not get a replacement. The rest of the razor seems well made, but the part that matters is a disappointment.</li>
    <li> This shaver is terrible if you have longer stubble.  The single foil just cannot cut longer hairs efficiently.  The result is that you have countless random hairs left and you have to pass over them an endless number of times with hopes of cutting them.  The build quality is great and the wet/dry feature is a nice.  However, using this shaver is too frustrating if you ever skip a day shaving.  I bought the Povos PS5302 instead and am much happier with it.</li>
    <li> Does an excellent job and is very reasonably priced.  I actually preferred an earlier version of Braun&#x27;s mobile shaver, but mine finally fell apart.  This one provides a close shave.  The trimmer is not as convenient as on their earlier model.</li>
    <li> works well but remember it&#x27;s just a shaver so use everyday or on short hair is works fine up until i let it get to thick k . i have to use the trimmer then first then the shaver  . i love the trimmer to .</li>
    <li> I bought this hoping that it would shave (no pun intended) time off my morning routine. As it turns out, my 1 day stubble is too tough for the shaver to cut well, especially my neck region. The extendable hair trimmer is a good add on though.</li>
    <li> Recently received and used twice, each time on two days&#x27; growth, though I&#x27;ll also be using it occasionally for 5:00 shadow cleanups. It did about as good and clean a job in about the same amount of time as my $125 regular razor and other mid-range shavers I&#x27;ve had in the past. Does not at all have the grinding, crunching, pulling of weak, dirt-cheap, full-sized, no-name razors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was dubious about the trimmer, which I need in an electric razor to hunt and straighten/cut stray hairs lying very flat or in odd directions or in hard-to-get-at spots. The trimmer dug those up and cut them just fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I continue to get a similar quality of shave for about a year out of this, I&#x27;ll be satisfied with the purchase. I loved the quality shaves and solidity of my Norelco travel shaver but lost it after two years, and with its price over $60 I&#x27;m perfectly happy to go through 3 of these for the same amount of money.</li>
    <li> This will not shave even my thinner facial hair if it has grown more then 1 day! However, I will keep it for touch ups. The other day I missed a spot shaving and the next morning I was able to hit the area within seconds. So for that its worth the sub twenty dollar price.</li>
    <li> My husband  ordered this since he is 84 and doesn&#x27;t need to shave every day.  Both he and I have a lot of difficulty turning it on and off - it is supposed to work with a push up.  It often takes us about 5 minutes  to get it turned on.  I&#x27;m not sure if this is due to lack of strength in our fingers/thumbs, but that&#x27;s the biggest complaint. The finished shave looks ok and the price from Amazon was right.  If someone knows a secret way to open it more easily, write a review!</li>
    <li> The roughest razor ever used, avoid particularly for your skin. Cheaply made and ineffective. Not even worth the postage to send.</li>
    <li> It is what it says it is. Small, quality, functional, great value. Excellent for both home and travel. Great buy.</li>
    <li> I bought this product in October 2012. I like this product because of its portability. It has performed well so far. TI had to change the battery once. Considering the price I would say this is a good purchase. I still have to see how long the cutter block and the foil will last. The trimmer is difficult to use.</li>
    <li> excellent for 5:00 shadows late in the day , or shaving on the run Sat and Sun morning kids football, soccer, dance etc</li>
    <li> Spot-on the best little travel shaver I&#x27;ve ever owned. Fact is, it compares favorably to expensive shavers so I use it every day.</li>
    <li> My husband loves this portable shaver. It is his second one, having accidentally left one at a daughter&#x27;s house after a trip there. It is small, lightweight and very easy on his skin. The shavings collect in a small reservoir and is easy to clean. We&#x27;ll retrieve the older one soon on another trip to same daughter&#x27;s house and it will become his &amp;#34;Travel&amp;#34; razor and this new one will remain at home. He is a fussy about his shaver and he has nothing but good things to say about this Braun razor.</li>
    <li> Very solid and reliable. Not power hungry, but shaving isn&#x27;t as good as full sized power razor. A compromise unless I see something else.</li>
    <li> I take blood-thinner Plavix and cannot use razor, lest I cut myself and blood fails to coagulate.&lt;br /&gt;The battery seems to last quite long and the blades provide pretty close shaves.</li>
    <li> I was surprised that a razor for this price works so well. It shaves close, is very compact and portable. Great travel razor.</li>
    <li> I use this every day.  It lasts about 2 years until the foil breaks.  Being inexpensive, I then go buy a new one.  (The foil replacement costs just as much as the whole shaver).</li>
    <li> Ok, not that sharpest razor, you will work hard on the shaving, but cheap!</li>
    <li> This is the second one I&#x27;ve purchased as the first one was in my car when the car was stolen and the buggers took my shaver.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not as good as some of the other electric razors I&#x27;ve used but its ideal to touch up when you didn&#x27;t get a chance to get home before you have a date or meeting. The wrap around design to keep the shaving head from damage is ingenious and the addition of the trimmer makes it even better.</li>
    <li> This is my third one.  It&#x27;s cheaper to buy a new one than to replace the cutter and screen.  Batteries last a long time.  Shave is as good as with my regular razor.  Lightweight and easy to pack in a toiletry kit.</li>
    <li> Great shaving battery powered razor.  Good enough for everyday usage.</li>
    <li> very very good. This is one to last you forever.</li>
    <li> Took absolutely no hair off of my face. Complete waste of money.</li>
    <li> I have another shaver, a Philips I think, that cost me over $150.  This cost be $20 and I use it all the time.  The small size means it can fit into all the nooks and crannies.  It comes with a little brush head that fits in the bottom, so cleaning it is easy.  It&#x27;s amazing.  You literally can&#x27;t go wrong for this price.  I would have paid $50 or more for this.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t really work at all. I definitely suggest getting a different razor and not this one. This did not meet my expectations.</li>
    <li> Product as advertised.  Would buy from this seller again.</li>
    <li> Power switch pretty stiff for the first couple of months, has loosened up to a good operation. Good battery life.&lt;br /&gt;Multiple gentile passes over an area work nicer than a single attempt to get all whiskers quickly.</li>
    <li> Batteries last a long time!  I own two of these, I have one in FL and one at home also.</li>
    <li> Repeat buyer (misplaced first one after a couple of years). And will treat myself to another soon for second car, or to leave at office.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work as expected. too painful to use.</li>
    <li> This is the version with a beard/sideburn trimmer.  Works fine.</li>
    <li> This shaver is perfect for traveling as it&#x27;s compact and has everything you need (including long-hair trimmer). The rotating cover is a nice touch as you don&#x27;t have to worry about losing a cover.</li>
    <li> Great, close shaves.  I think it was the tip I got from another review that really helped - don&#x27;t press too hard.  Never got such good results from an electric.  Have gotten lots of shaves from the first set of batteries.  This is really a travel item - small and compact - but I use it at home anyway.  Buy it!</li>
    <li> portable. easy to clean.  batteries last.</li>
    <li> So so -- I got this to cut back on water use but unfortunately I did not get a satisfactory shave and I have a fairly light beard. Had to go over same area many, many times. The trimmer works quite well. Will probably use as a travel razor.</li>
    <li> My 13 year old sprouted some peach fuzz on his face and action was required.  I didn&#x27;t want him messing with my razors in the shower or abusing my expensive electric shaver.  However, he looked a diseased peach and his mother demanded something be done.  This razor was the perfect answer.  Inexpensive but gets the job done!</li>
    <li> This is a replacement for an older one. It works great. The reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is that the trimmer is one third the width of the old one, so it takes significantly longer to use.</li>
    <li> I got this a few years ago in an effort to replace my rotary shaver, and it is still ticking.  I use rechargeable AAs most of the time, and I&#x27;m always comforted by the fact that I can just plop in some new batteries wherever I go if I run out of juice while on a trip.  Note, you do need to keep up with this type of shaver, and if you miss a day or two you will not get the same quality of shave you get when you keep at it.  When I go more than 2 days without shaving I simply use my beard trimmer to get it back down to short stubble and then use this, and it never disappoints.</li>
    <li> This is a great shaver, works well cuts a close shave and it is highly portable with its self enclosed cover. The screen IS thin, so I recommend just remembering it is inexpensive and use it carefully without pressing too hard and you should be fine I think.</li>
    <li> I love these little razors. I must have 6-8 and keep them all around the house and one in every car. Keep them clean and with fresh batteries and they do as good a job as my $150 Braun!</li>
    <li> I bought one of these 4 years ago. It works very well, and for the price, you can&#x27;t beat it. Shaves close, just a bit slower than my $150 rechargable shaver. The blades are not replaceable, so I&#x27;m buying another one. About $20 for 4 years of use - great deal. Portable, and uses standard batteries.</li>
    <li> I like Braun product and it&#x27;s cheap. Battery life is up to 2-3 weeks in a daily use basis.  You don&#x27;t even bother to replace the screen often because you can simply buy a new one just for the price of the screen of a conventional shaver.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s OK.  Does what it&#x27;s expected to do. But quite loud, and bigger than I thought. doesn&#x27;t feel refined.&lt;br /&gt;Hope it lasts longer.</li>
    <li> This is my second one of these M-90 shavers.  It works well; however, if someone lets me know of another brand and I try it and like it, I will definitely not be purchasing this shaver again.  The issues I have are these:  1)  The brush that comes with it to clean the shaver (which fits inside the bottom of the base of the shaver) is so cheap that in both shavers, the bristles have fallen out or the plastic piece holding the bristles has broken causing the bristles to fall out.  This happened within the first month of owning both shavers. 2)  The foil is incredibly cheap and very fragile causing it to break.  The cost of replacement is such that you might as well purchase another shaver. 3)  The trimmer on mine also stopped working after a while 4)  There are times I thought the shaver was broken because when I turned it on nothing happened.  I then had to shake it for it to work again.  I originally had the older version of this travel shaver and it lasted me forever and worked very well.  It looks like Braun&#x27;s quality has certainly declined.  Too bad because I used to think very highly of their products.  2)  The foil is extremely fragile.  If you bump it against anything it is prone to chip or bend and with the cost of the replacement part and the shipping, you might as well buy another razor all together.  The sad thing is I bought this razor because Braun&#x27;s predecessor model to this updated version was so good that it lasted me 10 years and though the bristles did fall out of the last one, it took five years to do so.  Also, the foil in the predecessor model must have been made of a better metal because it wasn&#x27;t even remotely as fragile as the current one.  Braun, if you&#x27;re reading this, please invest the couple of extra cents it takes for the better quality brush cleaner and foil and you will have the best shaver on the market.  If not, you will have lost me as a customer.  I will not buy this again.</li>
    <li> This works pretty well. Bought it for my husband to use while away from home. And he likes it a lot. Easy to use too!</li>
    <li> After 30 minutes still had so much stubble left I had to get out my trusty razor. Bought it due to surgery on right shoulder but soon learned I could shave with a razor with left hand only</li>
    <li> For a small razor that runs on batteries it rates a five. I used to trim my beard. The trimmer worked very well. It is compact and easy to use.</li>
    <li> This was purchased for military purposes and the quality of the shave is not good enough for the military.</li>
    <li> Useful, as long as you don&#x27;t expect too much.  At this price it&#x27;s got decent value so you can have one or two around as spares; it&#x27;s helpful that it takes common batteries (I use rechargeables).  Like a lot of electrics, it will leave stragglers, so you may have to go back over some areas again.</li>
    <li> the noise is too loudly!!!you should not buy it if you need quiet!!!&lt;br /&gt;you can buy 390C,it is the best for everyone!!!</li>
    <li> I use these &amp;#34;travel&amp;#34; razors as my main razor and have since I discovered them many years ago when I was taking a trip and wanted a small, light razor that didn&#x27;t take up much room.  To my surprise, they worked just as well if not better than my electric razor at home that I had paid over a hundred bucks for!  I&#x27;ll never use anything else but the Braum Mobile Shaver.</li>
    <li> This is a great shaver within it&#x27;s limitations.  It does a superb job with a close shave as long as your whiskers are not too long.  Since it does not have a cutter bar on the head like it&#x27;s big brothers, any long whiskers will get pushed over rather than enter the foil holes and get cut off.  This shouldn&#x27;t be a problem if you shave every day.  If you don&#x27;t, you will need to trim the whiskers shorter with some kind of clipper.  While this razor does have a clipper built in, it&#x27;s really puny - maybe 1\\&quot; wide.  You can see it sticking out to the side in the photos.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also has a neat cleaning brush that slides in and out of the base if you want to clean it without rinsing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as consumables go, Amazon carries foils for ~$12 as this is written.  They don&#x27;t carry new cutter heads, but they are available at other sites for ~$9.  While I don&#x27;t advocate creating more trash and in general deplore the mindset of the modern disposable society, I&#x27;d do the math and replace this one rather than buy the foil and cutterhead when this one stops shaving so well in ~ a year.  I&#x27;m used to replacing the foil/cutterhead on it&#x27;s big brother yearly.</li>
    <li> The reviews here might lead you to believe this shaver can be substituted for a regular full size electric shaver. It is not!&lt;br /&gt;This is just a light duty shaver at best. Anything more than just a *little* bit of a stubble and this shaver is practically ineffective or it will take thrice the time you could shave with a razor and shaving cream. I cant go more than one day without shaving and expect this to work, and I have light beard growth only, not heavy. If I can still return it I will.</li>
    <li> This little shaver is amazing!  Great to throw in your travel bag for the road.  The closeness of the shave is hard for me to believe.  The shaving head is rather small so it does take a while to shave with this thing.  For the money, you can&#x27;t beat it.</li>
    <li> Pros: Smooth and close shave. Just take your time and don&#x27;t push too hard. Cons: It&#x27;s pretty noisy and vibrates a lot in your hand.</li>
    <li> Great little shaver. Can&#x27;t beat it for the price. I have an earlier model that I accidentally dropped and damaged the foil. After shopping and pricing a replacement foil, I discovered it was about the same price as a new shaver. I will keep the older one and keep looking for a better price on a replacement foil, but so far I have not found it.</li>
    <li> Shaves everything without nicking, even my ears. The trimmer is perfect for around the ears and for cutting too-long-to-shave whiskers short enough to shave. In everyday use it runs for several weeks on two AA lithium&lt;br /&gt;flashlight batteries (https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004EFT2BU/ref&#x3D;oh_aui_search_detailpage?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;psc&#x3D;1) and lasts almost a year before the foil wears out. I wash mine after every shave, which doesn&#x27;t seem to hurt it.</li>
    <li> I have had my Braun for 3 years &amp; used it on trips or for camping. Worked OK on a light beard when new but now after 3 years it is getting tired, the batteries don&#x27;t seem to last as long probably because it is taking me longer to shave the fuzzies. Biggest problem area is my throat. Realistically you are not going to get a great easy shave out of a single foil razor, they just don&#x27;t work as well as rotary blade shavers. I found the battery cover very tight fitting &amp; it broke the flimsy tether strap. I would spend a little more money &amp; get a better product that will have a longer usable life.</li>
    <li> The shave quality is absolutely abysmal (both the trimmer and main part).  Do not purchase this.  I was enthralled by its overall design and details and bought it -- only to return it after two horrendous shaves.  It doesn&#x27;t cut hair well and requires an insane amount of repeat coverage.</li>
    <li> With all the positive reviews this shaver got I probably over hyped myself. Maybe that&#x27;s why I am so disappointed.Pulled my hair, takes a while to get a completely clean shave.</li>
    <li> I was looking for replacement heads for a once-in-a-while shaver I use and I no longer could find them.  I was considering buying a new shaver and came across this one.  It costs about what replacement heads would have cost me so I decided to get it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wow, am I impressed.  It runs great and does a great job.  This is not something I use often....just once in a while when at another location traveling.  It runs on two batteries and has a little clipper that pops out to get those pesky hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shave is good.  Don&#x27;t expect any fancy tricks here, but you won&#x27;t be disappointed if what you want is something smaller and reliable for traveling.</li>
    <li> This thing shaved nothing. I turned it on, it vibrates, it makes noise and does nothing else. I mean $22 dollars.. yeaa sure its cheap compared to others, however its not that cheap price wise considering it shaves nothing.. I should&#x27;ve gotten paid for wasting my time on this thing. I even tried shaving my downstairs and it wouldn&#x27;t even catch that. Piece of s*** but hey whatever I got took.. burn in hell ya pricks. I RECOMMEND THIS JUNK A** THING TO NOBODY</li>
    <li> This little gem is one of the best products fulfilling its intended purpose that I have ever purchase.  The quality is excellent, battery duration surprisingly long, and shaves quite close.  I do not have connection with this manufacturer and rarely can&#x27;t find something to be critical about, but this is truly economically priced and high quality.</li>
    <li> I bought this to replace a old similar unit no longer supported with parts. It is much improved and very reasonably priced. I have used on several trips. Great travel shaver</li>
    <li> Good shaver. very efficient on battery too. I love it! No razor bums afterwards. A little bit large though .</li>
    <li> The foil started peeling after second use badly enough it scratched my face in a number of places.. Since the foil costs about as much as the shaver it was a very bad deal. IN MY OPINION, DO NOT BUY THIS RAZOR!</li>
    <li> It works. I think I may have really thick hairs? Some hairs shave and other don&#x27;t? Either way, it leaves my face look blotchy. I guess for what it is it works. If you want a close, uniform, shave then go with a straight razor.</li>
    <li> The foil is not as effective as the prior version, but still a great product</li>
    <li> Peoduct came on time in good condition&lt;br /&gt;Gave 4* as I felt it is litte over priced it might be my opinion only but I did my shopping In hurry before a trip to give as gift when I came back felt it was litte over priced</li>
    <li> Came in a timely manner and was as indicated on order site. good experience!</li>
    <li> I bought this Braun to replace an older model that I have had for over 10 years.  I dropped it, tried to put it together with duct tape and found it was easier just to buy a new one.  This one is better than the old one I had.  It&#x27;s perfect for short trips, touch up in the afternoon, or vacations.  I would recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> This is my reserve &amp;#34;in-car&amp;#34; shaver.  It&#x27;s kept its charge, delivers a very respectable close shave, and is quiet.</li>
    <li> had the very expensive top of the line Braun.  found this works at 1/20 the price.  no VERY EXPENSIVE replacement cleaner cartridges.</li>
    <li> What can I say, this little Braun shaver works better then some of my more expensive shaver. I love how simple it works (protective cover) along with how easy it is to pack for traveling. But better then all that You want believe how close it shaves. I have a bald head and get a twin blade close shave.</li>
    <li> It will be great for extended traveling it gnu hyrr john big bd bg km o to to to from</li>
    <li> I love it - it gives a super close shave!</li>
    <li> I purchased this for him for father&#x27;s day, because he&#x27;s always on the go. He has a super thick, burly, full beard. In just 3-4 days without a trim, it&#x27;s too unruly for him to appear professional at work. He needed something that he could carry in his satchel every single day, that didn&#x27;t have to be plugged in, that shaved reliably and closely, and that could snag those stray long hairs that beards get every now and then. This does the trick!! His beard is groomed every morning, and it doesn&#x27;t matter if he wakes up too late to shave before he leaves the house - he just does a quick once over the non-hairy parts of his face in his car before he goes in. It&#x27;s washable too, so he can just run the blade under the tap when it needs a good cleaning. His hair is unbelievably thick, and this little razor has done a fabulous job getting a close shave. He says the little trimmer on the side even makes a solid cut. And at the price, if something were to go wrong somewhere down the road, we wouldn&#x27;t bat an eyelash at just ordering another one. He&#x27;s happy. I&#x27;m happy. A+++</li>
    <li> Fantastic battery operated shaver, I not only use it for travelling but everyday. Great close shave and the batteries last for weeks.</li>
    <li> Worked great for a couple weeks but now it shuts off or slows down during shaving. I bought the older model years ago and it was the best electric shaver I had ever owned, even better than a top of the line expensive one. It worked flawlessly for about 4 years! This one barely lasted a month. Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> EXCELLANT RAZOR TO HAVE WHEN YOUR TRAVELLING.GIVES A SMOOTH  SHAVE EVEN ON A TOUGH BEARD.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried many razors over the years and none are perfect. But as a travel type Braun razor this really is a great and convenient design for a basic shave. The swinging cover makes it feel like you&#x27;re instantly packing the razor away and protecting it every time you close it, which also locks the power button from turning on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got the Braun actually for daily use as I&#x27;m on a budget and wanted something in the meantime while I saved up for a nicer razor. But being waterproof I find that I&#x27;m happy with it. I use it in combination with a blade. This razor is not great for neck or soft hairs, (I&#x27;ve never found an electric that is), so in the shower I just quickly shave with blade, then follow up with the Braun. I&#x27;m currently working with the public every day and even though I can&#x27;t see very well without my glasses in the shower I&#x27;m able to get a great shave in a hurry and feel confident that I&#x27;m looking my best and didn&#x27;t miss anything :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t used the trimmer much but I would say if that feature is important this  is more of an emergency trimmer than something you&#x27;d want to use every day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line is it&#x27;s just a very nice sleek design at an affordable price.</li>
    <li> I had purchased one of these and the foil needed replacing after a few years. I bought the lesser model of this for half the price of the foil and found it to be less durable. It needed replacing within a year so I went back to the M90. It works great in the shower and for touch ups. It works better with a thinner shave cream as something thicker gums up the foil.</li>
    <li> Perfect for uh - oh missed in the morning shaving rituals.</li>
    <li> I purchased a Braun mobile shaver in Brussels about 6 years ago. Recently after dropping the unit and failing to operate, I  began searching for a replacement.  Fortunately, I located the M90 which is the latest Braun model and performs much better than my previous unit. I only use the M90 for touch up in the late afternoon or after a regular shave as needed. It&#x27;s an excellent unit with lots of power.  In addition, the trimmer works extremely well. I recommend this unit to anyone needing a razor for touchup or for regular daily shaving.</li>
    <li> For what it is, a battery powered travel or backup shaver, you can do no better IMO.  My usual razor is a Braun series 7, but when I need something for the car or suitcase, this shaver is perfect.  I get a very close shave without nicks, and being able to wash the head is a bonus. Every now and then I squirt on a little soft soap and give it a good rinse with hot water.  A steal at the GB price.</li>
    <li> This item is great for when you have that little bit of morning stubble.  It takes absolutely everything off and leaves a nice smooth feeling.  Cleaning is also easy, just rinse the entire head under running water while it is on and then remove cap and clean the row of razors with the small cleaning device that is attached on the bottom of it.  The entire shaver is very cool and sleek, great design!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only flaw is that if you wait too long to use this, and you get hairs that are more than 2mm long, that is where the shaver suffers.  It will only get a little more than half of those longer hairs.  You can use a regular razor for those hairs though and then go back to this shaver as they come back the next day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is also a small trimmer on the side of the shaver (see picture) that is great for cutting long hairs.  It is so small though that I&#x27;m afraid I might break it when I try to force it out of the side and back in when I am done with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT:&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s been over 3 years and I&#x27;m still using this as my main razor. The trimmer is great for getting long hairs short enough to easily trim with the main foil. I&#x27;ve been forced to shave with a Gillette razor a couple of times and I have to say that I hate it. After having this, the normal razor is just too messy and misses too much. I can get much closer and accurate with this razor, and it has lasted this entire time.&lt;br /&gt;The only bad thing is that a couple of month ago, a small piece of the foil chipped off. It was only a small hole in the foil and didn&#x27;t make the shaver unusable or anything, but it did make it rather uncomfortable whenever the part with the hole came in contact with my skin while shaving, like a scratchy feeling. To fix this myself I ordered the $15 blue shaver (the non-trimmer variant that you can find on Amazon) and I just swapped out foils. I will be using the blue shaver for parts if anything breaks.&lt;br /&gt;But hey, I didn&#x27;t expect a shaver this cheap to last this long. Even if it broke beyond repair I would not hesitate to buy another for $25.</li>
    <li> this is a great little razor with a really close shave.  My husband keeps it in his vehicle.  The battery is long lasting, too.</li>
    <li> bought this rather than getting replacement blades &amp; foil for my Old one !  cheaper than the parts ??</li>
    <li> i keep it in my car, very well designed, battery lasts forever and doesn&#x27;t spills small hair peaces all over. this is one of my best purchase. thank you Braun and Amazon.</li>
    <li> I bought a Panasonic ES38331K ($13.98), Braun M90 ($18.79) and Philips Norelco PQ208/40 ($14.97) to replace a broken travel shaver. I shaved half my face with each shaver, making three pairwise comparisons over three days.  The Panasonic had two advantages. It was the most energetic, sounding a lot more powerful. It also was the only wet/dry shaver of the three. But the shave on the Braun was smoother. The Braun also has a built-in trimmer that works well, and the cover is integrated into the design. The Norelco was too weak, not giving a good shave. It was so weak that I changed the batteries on it, thinking that maybe the batteries were depleted, but there was no improvement with fresh batteries.  Overall, I give the Braun M90 five stars, the Panasonic four stars and the Norelco one star. Either the Braun or the Panasonic will work well as a travel shaver. Don&#x27;t waste money on the Norelco.  Update: Two years and five months after buying this shaver, the foil tore and needed replacement. It was cheaper to just buy a new shaver, so I bought another Braun M90.</li>
    <li> I bought the M90 as a backup for an earlier model that has served me well for several years. A small single head is ideal for me and my beard and hard to find in general. There are no replacement heads and screens for these shavers, but the price for the entire shaver is under the price for new heads and screens for most other shavers. These shavers also run a long time on just two alkaline AA batteries.</li>
    <li> I really love this portable shaver, I take it with me were ever I go. I use rechargeable batteries that keep this boy going. Its a must have if you travel a lot.</li>
    <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;+Sturdy. You could drop it a few times and it&#x27;ll still work.&lt;br /&gt;+Comes with a trimmer at the side for long hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-The foil mesh is quite fine, preventing hairs longer than 1mm or so from properly receiving contact with the blades. Such hairs would require trimming with the attached trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;-Unable to get consistently close shaves without applying significant amount of force against the face, at which point the blades would be brushing against the epidermal layers of your skin, causing irritation.&lt;br /&gt;-The trimmer&#x27;s blade is only covered on one side (the side facing out from the back), which may injure unaware first time users. Exercise caution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this for close to a week or so now and I just find myself defaulting back to my Mach 3. Contrary to the product description, this shaver just can&#x27;t get rid of stubble consistently without irritating the skin on my face.</li>
    <li> GREAT SHAVER! NO MORE RAZOR BURNS!</li>
    <li> Would be great if it actually shaved whiskers .  Not sure if this is typical of electric foil shavers, but this thing is really bad.  Unless you are going for the managed stubble look like George Michaels, stick to a blade.  I hear people really like foil shavers, and I&#x27;ve had electric rotary shavers that got closer, but this thing is brutal.  I can go over and over and over the same spot and I swear I can feel the beard growing as I am shaving.</li>
    <li> Shaves about 90% as close as a blade, which seems really good to me.  It feels comfortable in my hand and is easy to use.  Reasonably small and portable.  I&#x27;ve used it near daily for about a month now and the two included AA batteries show no signs of wearing out.  The extra blade works reasonably well.  A great bonus is that it is really easy to clean.  You can safely and effectively run it under water to clear a lot of the debris, but to get everything out of the blade itself, you&#x27;ll need to use the little brush that is conveniently stored at the bottom of the unit.  That&#x27;s not very hard to do; which is great. It&#x27;s much easier to clean and smaller and more portable than my previous three rotating blade shaver. The extra trimmer blade pops out as pictured when needed, but is usually tucked flush into the base of the unit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one thing that would really put it over the top would be if it had a way to plug it in to recharge the batteries.  Once the included batteries run out, I&#x27;ll use AA rechargeable batteries with a separate external charger, which isn&#x27;t too much trouble.  For the price and overall function I&#x27;ll still give it 5 stars.</li>
    <li> works great,&lt;br /&gt;great for traveling</li>
    <li> Simple, compact, and does the job at a very affordable price.</li>
    <li> You&#x27;re buying a 20$ product, it amazing foebthe price, just be sure to take your time to shave and you are good.</li>
    <li> A backup shaver kept in the car.  Performs well on tough, dark, hair growth and takes up very little space</li>
    <li> Regrets!!! The only words that comes n mind thinking about the item.&lt;br /&gt;It does not cut as it should, the trimer part is not really existent…&lt;br /&gt;In short, it’s a disappointment</li>
    <li> It is well made shaver, the design is very good and it shaves very well and the price is right.</li>
    <li> This is the second one of this model that I have purchased.  It lasts very well. The original one I bought back in 2006 and is still running fine.&lt;br /&gt;Could not find a replacement cutter head online so purchased an additional model.</li>
    <li> I love it! it is battery operated and gives a smooth shave.</li>
    <li> again this is what I&#x27;ve been looking for I didn&#x27;t received it and I do like to have another one very soon</li>
    <li> trimmer is not nearly as good as previous model. If you want reviews do not predetermine length of comments!  Poor design.</li>
    <li> Batteries lasted two weeks, shave is pretty good, trimmer a bit awkward. Overall just what I needed for on the road.</li>
    <li> Salient Features: Lesser Noise, Closer shave&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: Makes a good travel shaver slips in nicely in to my travel pouch, Runs on battery for whole month for 3 mins of average use a day, Easy to clean&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Leaves hair under the chin close to neck.</li>
    <li> It really is just okay, compared to my full size 10 year old Braun, it is not that good. It doesn&#x27;t do well if you don&#x27;t shave everyday, once the stubble are a bit longer (2 days growth), it started to have trouble shaving cleanly, I have to make multiple passes in order to have a clean shave. I would just bring my full size Braun on my trips now, this shave is just too wimpy.</li>
    <li> i use it after shaving by razor and it works fine but the Toshiba is better to use . .</li>
    <li> Product does not work.  Ordered it before a cross-country trip and by the time I found out it didn&#x27;t work I was on the other side of the US.  By the time I got home, it was too late to return it!  Doesn&#x27;t work for face hair, leg hair, coarse hair or ffine hair.  It just doesn&#x27;t work.  Save your money.</li>
    <li> Does a great job on a daily shave.  If you don&#x27;t shave EVERY day this isn&#x27;t for you.  It will not shave whiskers much longer than a days growth.</li>
    <li> My third Braun mobile - still carry the second in my travel kit.  I bought the M90 for quick, last-minute home use.  Not quite the all-star of Braun mobile predecessors, but good. Went for three days without a shave while doing the stay at home, work around the house, recluse thing.  For the heck of it, I gave the M90 a go at the growth.  I have a light to moderate beard, but this was admittedly a bit of a test.  Too much of a test for the M90, but it&#x27;s quite ok for one-day beards.  Unlike Braun mobile predecessors, the pop up trimmer is too narrow for sideburns. And it&#x27;s not small enough for nostrils or ears.  This shaver doesn&#x27;t use much battery life.</li>
    <li> My husband says this is the best razor that he has ever had.  Believe me, he has tried them all.  Great product!!!!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my 16 yr old son and he loves it. It&#x27;s very easy to use and cleans up his facial hair perfectly. The little side part is good for side burns or possibly a mustache. Can&#x27;t beat the price the price either, I highly recommend this razor.</li>
    <li> purchased this for our vacation was best idea i&lt;br /&gt;have done worked great.and have recommended&lt;br /&gt;it to all my Friends&#x27; Great product at a awesome price&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for a great Item.</li>
    <li> Excellent German engineering, cheap at Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s almost as good as the Norelco triple head, which is saying a lot.</li>
    <li> I got this for traveling. I have not made any trips yet.So thats why i have not used it yet?</li>
    <li> The Braun Mobile Shaver works as expected.  Excellent!  Delivery was one week.  Worth the price.  Thanks!</li>
    <li> My previous Braun shaver lasted 20 years.  So when it finally died recently, I had to look for another Braun.  Here&#x27;s what I like about the M-90: (1) it&#x27;s relatively inexpensive, (2) it&#x27;s flat, compact and lightweight so that it packs well for travel, (3) it seems to be well-made and all of the parts work well together, (4) the two included AA alkaline batteries lasted four months of daily use, which was a pleasant surprise (still, I would recommend getting a set of low self-discharge batteries, such as the Sanyo Eneloop).    My only reservations are (1) the foil cannot capture the few stray hairs that have grown long or have curled over, though I suspect this is a common problem with the foil design (I just bring along a disposable shaver to tackle this problem) (2) the foil screen on my previous Braun cracked and had to be replaced every couple of years, so I&#x27;ll wait to see if Braun has made the screen more durable.    If you want a shaver for daily light trim and beard maintenance while traveling, then I would highly recommend the Braun M-90.  It&#x27;s a fine example of good design.    UPDATE: See my second reservation above.  The original foil screen cracked after about a year of daily use.  I&#x27;m not too surprised (still disappointing though), BUT a single replacement foil costs $13 including shipping.  That&#x27;s a third of the cost of the M-90.  Frankly, I&#x27;m tired of this problem in the wide foil design.  I wonder whether the floating head design would be more durable.</li>
    <li> Did not have high expectations for a battery powered shaver but when it was offered as a lightning deal I went for it. Loved that it came with batteries - the day it arrived I had skipped my morning shave and was in need of a shave before the parent-teacher meetings that evening.  The product is very solid and well designed. Looks like it will last a long while.</li>
    <li> Everything is nice about this electric razor.  Now if it would only actually give a clean shave. I go over and over my face and many whiskers remain unscathed. I wasted my money on this purchase!</li>
    <li> Braun Mobile Shaver was a ligh traver model, just the kind I was seeking for. When you travel light you don´t want to carry big and heavy shavers (or anything else big or heavy) with you. If it had a hair trimmer (as my old Mobile Braun had) I would have given full 5 stars.</li>
    <li> This is the perfect travel shaver.  Great close shave and clever design for traveling.</li>
    <li> Very good for what it is: a backup method of shaving for off-days or times, Can&#x27;t really handle more than a day&#x27;s growth. Within that limitation, it works well.</li>
    <li> I use this in my travel kit and it works great.</li>
    <li> Bought this as a gift for my brother, but I don&#x27;t know if he liked it or even uses it.  However, I bought it because my boyfriend bought one, and I&#x27;ll tell you what he thinks of his.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For reference, the boyfriend is decades past puberty and of Central European ancestry.  He&#x27;s neither baby-faced nor a bear.  He&#x27;s got a respectable moderate amount of facial hair.  That said, let us proceed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First off, he says that for a shaver that costs less than a modest lunch, it can&#x27;t be beat.  That, and he can go for almost two months on a single set of alkaline batteries.  It rests nicely in the palm, it travels well, and because the cover is attached, it never gets lost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He&#x27;s priced out replacement parts and it&#x27;s actually a few dollars cheaper to buy a new shaver than to fix it, if it should break.  I don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s a good thing or not.  He&#x27;s a tinkerer, so he sees that as a weird thing, at the very least.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But he is also quick to point out its down sides.  If you want to get the same close shave as your vintage Braun shaver, you&#x27;re going to have to work at it for a while.  Also, the trimmer is curved, so it&#x27;s going to require a little finessing to get a nice straight line (say, on your sideburns).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But for twenty bucks, it makes for a great travel shaver, or a shaver that you can use if you forgot to charge your usual one (just pull some batteries out of some other electronic device if you have to).</li>
    <li> I just returned from a year-long trip that took me around the jungles and beaches of Papua New Guinea, and this product was part of my pack.  I bought this hoping to not need to razor shave there, and ended up being unhappy with the shave it gave me.  Everything above the chin was shaved perfectly, but when I got under the chin to shave along the neck it just didn&#x27;t cut it.  I would finish shaving and still have a pretty rough feel of scruff along the neck.  I finally just decided to grow out a beard for the year and didn&#x27;t look back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nice try, but I don&#x27;t think it does a great job on the entire face.</li>
    <li> I liked mine so much when son was looking for another alternative, I purchased this one for him.  Its easy to use, clean and take with you.  Two AA batteries keep it going for a long while.  I only use mine once or twice a week and batteries can last up to 3 months or so.  Great shaver.</li>
    <li> Good shaver....some trouble with closing the case where the batteries go sometimes.</li>
    <li> Braun made a big mistake when they made the M90 Mobile Shaver......They made it too good.  For under $ 20.00 you get a shaver that is supper , compact and always ready to go.  When I first saw this shaver I couldn&#x27;t believe the price,,,because at that time they were selling&lt;br /&gt;for just  $ 12.00  What a deal !  Don&#x27;t miss this one.</li>
    <li> Revising my earlier positive review of the Braun M90: I cannot recommend these, I have been through two of these the past year or more, the trouble is, you cannot use this as an every-day shaver, especially if you have a tough beard or more than a day&#x27;s growth, forget it. I notice the foil on this is really delicate and I&#x27;ve had two of them start tearing pretty fast and then you have to replace the foil or chuck the whole thing. I ended up giving up, throwing the last one out, and I have a Philips Norelco shaver which I had thought died but didn&#x27;t recently, trouble is it&#x27;s not very good, so I ended up using it as a backup and got a better Braun wet/dry rechargeable shaver which ran me about  $115 but is so far, superior in every way to this, and of course more heavy-duty and seems a lot more durable, and cleaning is even a lot easier, being it&#x27;s a wet/dry shaver, etc. Upshot is it&#x27;s an ingenious design that might be ok for occasional travel usage but I would definitely not say this is a workhorse, everyday shaver, it&#x27;s not meant for such heavy use, and the foil is just small and delicate as can be.  No good for me.</li>
    <li> Have use Braun shavers before and I like it. It&#x27;s better than the previous different brand shaver I have.  No regret buying 2 Braun M90 Mobile Shaver. Now I have a smooth shave,it&#x27;s convenient,handy and is a top quality shaver. Highly Recommend.</li>
    <li> I have always used Brauns and this one is an excellent battery operated model which will be ideal for my planned trip to Everest Base Camp where it is too cold to shave normally and where electricity is a rare luxury!</li>
    <li> This razor is for men or women.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I, a woman, have used this razor for a year and it still smoothly shaves leg hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My friend in Ohio, a man, has been shaving with this razor for over a year and it continues to give him a smooth facial shave. He says this razor does a better job than a $150 one he use to own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Easy to travel with. Conveniently fits in cosmetic bag.</li>
    <li> Got this for my boyfriend works almost as good as his full-size Braun.  it&#x27;s perfect for touching up travel you name it great product</li>
    <li> This is a superb travel electric shaver.  It provides an excellent shave and is easy to maintain.  I received the product quickly and I have been very satisfied.</li>
    <li> Does not work well on 3-4 day facial scruff.  I have to go over at least 4-5 times and even still will not clip some strands.  Leaving me with a chin full of missed hairs.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m going back to carrying my full-size Braun</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve found and made the most awesome discoveries on the net, and this time was no exception!&lt;br /&gt;Trying to replace an older Panasonic razor!&lt;br /&gt;Was about to order another one when I decided to check out Braun and didn&#x27;t want to spend a lot, boy what a buy!!&lt;br /&gt;Works great! Awesome design! Simple use right out of the carton!&lt;br /&gt;Didn&#x27;t even read the instructions that came with it!&lt;br /&gt;I need to get more. Great Christmas gift!&lt;br /&gt;Best shave I&#x27;ve had in quite some time!&lt;br /&gt;Grab yourself one or two!&lt;br /&gt;Smooth shave,  you&#x27;ll love it!&lt;br /&gt;P.S. This shaver has an amazing little trimmer, and  a little brush neatly tucked away  under the bottom.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s like a Swiss Army knife design that really works no skin irritation either, it seems it was designed to only shave hair.&lt;br /&gt;I now look forward to shaving instead of dredging it!&lt;br /&gt;Amazing device! Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Exactly what I needed, arrived on time and in great condition! Small, compact, and neat. That is what was needed and that is what I got.</li>
    <li> Not as close of a shave but gets the job done. I have to go over the same area muliple times but still well worth it for a job/car backup when needed.</li>
    <li> The foil shaver component doesn&#x27;t cut effectively and the pop out trimmer is too small to be of much use.</li>
    <li> This was a disappointment. I have a small equivalent razor by Panasonic. This one bites me and burns my neck area. I relegated it to the storage drawer.</li>
    <li> Not bad at all for a small travel portable.</li>
    <li> cheap, last forever. Battery life is great.  Because the foil doesn&#x27;t like longer whiskers, this is better if you shave regularly and don&#x27;t let things grow out too long.  The mustache attachment can get the odd mutant hair and I use it for ears and nose as well. Easy to clean, compact and nice to throw in a suitcase.</li>
    <li> Works very well.  It is very easy to clean.  Wash off after removing the shaving top, clean with water.  Replace top and use an occasional drop or 2 of light machine oil and you are good to go.  I usually oil again after 5 or 6 uses.  Very smooth on the face. I do recommend this product.</li>
    <li> amazing power,  speed and efficiency, worth the price</li>
    <li> Myself and pretty much every infantry Marine use this razor in the field. It does a great job when you are in a hurry. Leaves a nice smooth shave and it is super easy to use and clean. Why spend crazy amounts of money when this is all you need?</li>
    <li> I got tired of having to pack my razor every time I traveled - so I got this one to keep in my toiletry bag (plus extra batteries).  I have been using this for a few months now and have not had to change the batteries yet.  It works well and gives a very close shave - almost as good as my Braun I use at home.  The side trimmer is not the best, but it does get the job done.</li>
    <li> great little shaver. i use a full size Braun with and this little guy shaves just as good. the price is right and it&#x27;s very well engineered for the traveler. And it&#x27;s washable under running water!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only wish is that it was even smaller.But the size is not bad at all.</li>
    <li> I got this little shaver to keep at my office for touch ups or to use if I missed the morning shave.  It works well for this and actually shaves closely.  I did NOT buy it as a primary daily shaver and I would not recommend it for that - especially for those wire-tough beards out there.  Priced well for what it designed for.  It will not replace the shaver designed for heavy every day use.  You get what you pay for!</li>
    <li> I use this shaver for my mustache. This one is the best shaver ive had in the last 10 years that does this to perfection and i have been using it for over 5 years now. It is the 2nd one i buy as the first one stopped working after 4 years.    I fully recommend this shaver and hope it does good for you as well.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had the same Braun 7526 razor for more than 15 years and love it.  I was recently looking at Amazon for a replacement screen/cutting head for my Braun and saw the M90 Mobile Shaver offered at a great price and decided to try it.  It is now the only shaver I will take when I travel - I leave my trusty Braun 7526 home to rest...    What I Like About the M90:  + weight is heavy enough to feel &#x27;solid&#x27; and light enough for a travel shaver  + powerful enough to shave through several day beard growth (I&#x27;d say I have average growth)  + the protective case swings around to become part of the base and expose the shaving head (my old Braun has a plastic sleeve that overlays the head and it sometimes pops off during travel)  + the razon can&#x27;t accidentally turn itself on due to the way the &#x27;swing case&#x27; mentioned above is positioned (my old one has turned itself on when the power switch is bumped during travel)  + appreciate the inclusion of a side trimmer and cleaning brush on such an inexpensive model  + the ability to clean the head with water (can&#x27;t do this with my old Bruan)  + battery life seems to be quite good (and it was very nice that Braun included two high end Duracell batteries with the product instead of some cheap batteries/or none at all)      What I Don&#x27;t Like About the M90:  - the plastic casing is a far cry from the metal parts of my older Braun, but it does seem to be sturdy enough (and for the price it seems very well made)  - the way the battery compartment opens up (it&#x27;s kind of a twist and flip method) seems to me that it may be quite easy to break off at some point in the future    Overall I think the Braun M90 is an excellent product for the price and would recommend if for anyone who travels frequently.</li>
    <li> I sent this shaver to my son in  Afghanistan.....he used it for a few months and it performed well....but then he broke the screen ....but then these were extreme circumstances....I found a replacement screen for 10 dollars but decided to order a new one instead .....he is still deployed and using it now.</li>
    <li> I bought this for travel, and to test a foil-type electric shaver before I invest big money. After six shaves on the road and three to four touch-ups at home, the foil breaks.  I found it close to useless on certain parts of my neck and face, and I would have to shave with a blade anyway.  I suppose it is okay for lighter beards (mine&#x27;s not that heavy), but it really didn&#x27;t stand up to even the limited use I gave it.</li>
    <li> I found this Braun M90 moobile shaver to be powerful and usable in quick situations.  It does not grab or nick your face, gives a decent smooth shave, good battery length and motor power, and handles a day&#x27;s beard growth well.  It fits into a car tray or briefcase well.  The battery compartment was redesigned (previously known as the P-70)to prevent it from opening and spilling out the batteries.  The side trimmer is OK, being short and at an odd angle, not like previous Braun shavers I boght a few years ago.  I recommend this item.    But... be careful who you buy it from.  There are secondary merchants who sell these items through Amazon.com, and while you may trust Amazon, you should not trust these secondary vendors!  These secondary vendors may offer a low-price, but that price may not get you a delivery of the right product!  Their idea of business is to make money to ship you what you did not order, and expect you to ship the wrong product back to them, while offering a 10% discount on a substitute product.  It seems that this kind of practice indicates one thing:  They are only in the business to make money by shipping the wrong products, if in fact they ship anything at all.  The verification that came from Amazon.com said the product was shipped, and my credit card was charged.  However, that was not the case.  The UPS number was false because the product was actually \\&quot;out of stock\\&quot; and never shipped.  But, false information was sent to Amazon by this vendor, and my credit card was charged.      Check the internet feedback to learn who these vendors are.  My advice to Amazon.com is:  \\&quot;Screen your vendors... or I will stop buying products from you.\\&quot;</li>
    <li> I tried two of the Braun M90s before I gave up, both wet and dry. If I just had a little stubble they cut (sort of), but any stray longer hairs were left uncut. I think the flip over cover is a great idea (instead of a flimsy plastic cap that will get knocked on the floor or falls off if you drop your razor), I just wished the razor worked better. Sigh.</li>
    <li> A little smaller than I expected, but not to small for my big hands. Maybe a little lighter than my old Braun rechargeable. I love it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always had one of these for travel &amp; touch up. Love it! It&#x27;s not an every day razor,I use it mainly after I use my electric,which isn&#x27;t very good. This gets in those places my razor doesn&#x27;t,like under my lip and pot holes.</li>
    <li> I like it. It shaves much better than my old Braun portable. This one has a trimmer that cuts well. I wear a Van Dyke and it shaves around it very well. I would buy it again.</li>
    <li> it works perfectly for me, I&#x27;m not hairy so battery last long for me.  I use it everyday for home and travel.  I like the screen guard built in b/c I knew I would loose if it is not attached.  my old cordless rechargeable died and I don&#x27;t know how to retrofit new battery or if they even sell replacement battery for it. so I toss a perfectly good shaver just because the battery stop holding charge.</li>
    <li> Good product - just wish it had a travel pouch with it.</li>
    <li> Not as small as I had hoped for Ina travel charger. Actually it is. 75% of a full size electric shaver. If you have a 5 o&#x27;clock shadow by lunch time this is not the product for you.  It does work but ever so slowly. The only positive is that it doesn&#x27;t irritate your skin. Otherwise I am underwhelmed.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t think it can get any better than this for a battery operated shaver. I carried this in Iraq for a year for when I had to shave (once in a while) and when I didn&#x27;t have the time or water to done a regular job of it. Very high quality for the price and the blade stayed sharp for a long time.</li>
    <li> My husband loves the shaver. This us the second one he has had .loves it</li>
    <li> I hated going through disposable razors on a weekly basis, so I began looking for an electric shaver. I bought a more expensive shaver at first, but when it was time to replace the foil, the new foil costed way too much. I bought this instead of a replacement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this every day. It&#x27;s much quicker and more convenient than disposable blades, so I&#x27;m more likely to use it and keep a clean shave. I had this for about a year before replacing the foil. The shave is great with a new foil, and as long as you don&#x27;t let your hair grow too long, it&#x27;s sufficient with an older foil. Like any inexpensive electric shaver, it&#x27;s not as precise as a disposable razor. However, it&#x27;s good enough that you only need to bring out the razor on special occasions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The replacement foil with shipping costs about as much as the shaver itself. However, if you&#x27;re up to purchasing foils in bulk, you can save on shipping.</li>
    <li> I have a braun 700 series for my at home shaver and really like it.  This little traveler works just fine for short periods of time.</li>
    <li> Got this for my boyfriend who was traveling for one month in South Korea.  He said it broke after the second use.  And he doesn&#x27;t have heavy duty facial hair!</li>
    <li> Nice size for travel.  Batteries seem to last adequate enough.  Only one small problem; It can&#x27;t do a clean shave, even after 20 minutes of trying.  I&#x27;ll try another brand, even tweezers would be better.</li>
    <li> Easy to use for beginner.</li>
    <li> This shaver works better than the standard 3 series razor! I have a tuff beard and the 300 leaves hair on my face that requires the use of a regular blade to remove. This one does the job on its own and has become my favorite. You cant beat the price or the quality for a inexpensive shaver.</li>
    <li> good travel shaver for boat or camping</li>
    <li> My first electric shaver I love it</li>
    <li> I have owned rotary shavers that are rechargeable.  The design of this unit is very well thought out.  The clover slides over the foil to protect it and it can not be turned on unless the cover is rotated to display the full foil.  There is a little brush that tucks nicely in to the bottom.  The two batteries are easy to replace and the entire unit has a good quality feel.  I bought three of them.  The batteries seem to last a long time and you get a good strong motor, unlike the motors that seem to lose power after several rechargings.  I keep it in the car for easy access when I arrive at the office and find that I missed a section while shaving with a disposable razor or just need a quick touchup before an evening meeting.  You could easily buy four of these for the price of one rechargeable rotary unit.</li>
    <li> Compact and easy to use for small hairs and travel</li>
    <li> Excellent shaver and trimmer.</li>
    <li> Heavier then I thought, but works great.</li>
    <li> Used to travel 4 days a week, every week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This thing was a lifesaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Used this for almost 3 years about 2-3 times per week and only had to change the batteries once or twice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still works almost as good as the day I got it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The beard trimmer leaves a bit to be desired as it is very narrow, but overall couldn&#x27;t ask for anything more.</li>
    <li> I like this shaver and when the foil head broke I wanted a new head.  But just the head was almost as expensive as  whole ne razor.  S0 I bought a new one.  Go figure. When this one breaks in 4 or 5 years, I will get another one oer its replacement model.</li>
    <li> This is the second M90 that I&#x27;ve owned over the last 10 years or so, and the only reason I got another was a small tear in the foil (not too shabby for a 9-year-old razor!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It gets into tight/difficult to reach spaces like under the nose, is shaped well to glide over the jawline and even between the eyes (for you monobrowers out there!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The little side pop-out trimmer works well on sideburns and longer hairs that the foil misses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The (2) AA batteries last me a few weeks (with a solid 2-3 minutes of actual shave time per day) and the included brush does a nice job of keeping it clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While its frustrating that the foil broke, I can&#x27;t really complain about an average of $2/yr for a powered shaver (plus battery costs).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, don&#x27;t be scared off by the price, it is solidly built, and if the foil goes in a few years, it still beats shelling out $100-200 for a full-size electric that you don&#x27;t really want to use in the car anyway...</li>
    <li> A good motto is if it ain&#x27;t broke, don&#x27;t fix it. I had the previous version for 9 years, it was perfect,  Didn&#x27;t use much power,&lt;br /&gt;always performed well. I only had to replace it because the foil finally  to thin and got a hole in it, no replacement (obsolete)&lt;br /&gt;  The side trimmer has been changed poorly, instead of a flip out with a square (flat) cutter, it now has a slide out (more&lt;br /&gt; vulnerable to damage) smaller and curved design which is much more difficult to manipulate. On the previous design, all&lt;br /&gt;you had to do was to flip up the side burn cutter and swipe, your burn were square. The shaver does work very well though.</li>
    <li> Do not waste your time and money on this used it once and I am probably going to return it.&lt;br /&gt; WHY? I tried it on stubble and it left patches and barely did anything.&lt;br /&gt;I would not tell anyone to try this out i would even tell them to stay away from it.</li>
    <li> I grew up using a single-foil Braun shaver that swiveled out, so I had the ancient version of this guy.  I lost the prior one and I&#x27;ve been using other shavers since - until I found this guy on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Braun Mobile M90 has a few new improvements, being sleeker, a bit smaller, more water resistant, and they moved the trimmer to slide out of the side.  The trimmer used to be down the middle and pop out, but the difference is no big deal.  The performance is decent, but it will miss some of the longer hairs.  Effectiveness really depends on how your beard grows out.  My hair is fairly uniform in direction so I use foil shavers.  If you&#x27;re used to the rotary floating blade shavers, this probably won&#x27;t be a good fit for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Comparison:Panasonic ES-series Wet/Dry vs Braun Series 3 System vs Braun Mobile M90&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Price: Braun Series 3 &amp;#62; Panasonic &amp;#62; Braun M90&lt;br /&gt;Overall shave: Panasonic &amp;#62; Series 3 &amp;#62; M90&lt;br /&gt;Stray hairs, slightly longer hairs: Series 3 &amp;#62; M90 &amp;#62; Panasonic&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So they each win at something.  The great thing about the M90 is that it&#x27;s somewhat compact (they could have made it way thinner over the years, what the heck guys?), so it works well for travel and the shave isn&#x27;t bad.  It&#x27;s just not going to be your best shaver either, but at the price and because it runs for a long time on 2 AA batteries, it&#x27;s perfect for travel and in the car.</li>
    <li> I have another model (M60) of this shaver that I use when I travel and I love it.  I bought this one to replace a full size electric shaver.  It costs half what I pay for replacement blades and does just as good a job.</li>
    <li> I have previously owned a similar model which had given excellent service for over 20 years.  There was difficulty in purchasing a replacement from the normal retail stores in New Zealand.  This is the first time I have used Amazon but will certainly use again.  Price was very good and the whole purchasing procedure was explained in detail.  The item arrived a couple of days earlier than forecast.  Well done.</li>
    <li> I bought this for travel, and as a backup for my more expensive shaver.  But, I found it does a better job than my regular shaver, so it is now primary, and the older one becomes the backup.</li>
    <li> Christmas present for my father, and he loves it.  He ended up buying another one for use at his office. Cant speak to the durability yet, but the cutting and usage so far has been top notch.</li>
    <li> best shaver I EVER HAD.  I HAVE HAD 3 OF THEM NOW.  WOULDN&#x27;N SWITCH.  LOW COST AND EASY TO USE AND CLEAN.</li>
    <li> Much noisier than the similar but much quieter M60 (model without side trimmer).</li>
    <li> It is very easy to use. Battery life is good</li>
    <li> Doe&#x27;s the job.as I expected it to do. I have one in each car if needed, so it gets used frequently.</li>
    <li> I bought this razor to replace an earlier model that I had and used for nearly 20 years.  Always a close shave.</li>
    <li> Pro&#x27;s: I usually shave with a razor, but I bought this little guy for use on short business trips. It&#x27;s great for overnight and possibly even weekend travel as it saves all the hassle and time of taking your razor and shaving cream etc.. It can be used wet or dry and is very small and light. The battery life is impressive. It&#x27;s not a super close cut, but it&#x27;s good enough.   Con&#x27;s: It struggles with thicker \\&quot;scruff\\&quot; (two days growth for me). I wouldn&#x27;t get it as your primary shaver.   For the price, it&#x27;s quite amazing.</li>
    <li> just rec&#x27;vd a week ago. Used it 3 times and it does a good job. I&#x27;m a blade shaver and haven&#x27;t had an electric in years, so it&#x27;s not going to get as close as a blade, but did a respectable job. It&#x27;s what I expected and I would buy or recommend for a travel shaver.</li>
    <li> 16 MONTH UPDATE:  After using this unit for the last 16 months I have decided that it is indeed a great item.  My initial imipressions as written below were correct.  I have had no problems whatsoever, the blades are still plenty sharp, and I changed the batteries twice.  I&#x27;ve decided to get one for my son in law for Christmas. Take my word for it you can&#x27;t go wrong with this item.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;INITIAL IMPRESSION:  I received this shaver several months ago and it has impressed me from the beginning.  It has a solid well made feel about it, and it never fails to give me a good close shave.  I would say that I have an average beard and frequently change between blade and electric shavers depending on where I am. I don&#x27;t always have access to hot water. I travel several times a year internationally and find this battery operated (2 AA&#x27;s) unit keeps things really simple since I don&#x27;t have to be concerned about different outlets and currents.  The foil is pretty thin (hence the close shave).  I suggest those of you who have a heavy/thick beard or tend to push hard against your skin while shaving to look elsewhere because the foil won&#x27;t take harsh or rough treatment of any kind. I would like to mention that there is a real genius to this design.  The top rotates 180 degrees to open and closes to provide great protection against any damage to the foil, and it takes up very little room when traveling. And the price is $22!!</li>
    <li> This shaver has a nice protective cover.  It fits my hand, not cumbersome. It shaves very close without pressing hard.  I would get another one for a good price.  I like it more than my Forever Free Everywhere Trimmer which is the first one I had ever bought.  I like that one too.</li>
    <li> Though I miss the old &amp;#34;cord&amp;#34; and powerful shavers, this is a good product. Batteries last more than a week,&lt;br /&gt;and definitely is a better product that the new &amp;#34;cordless&amp;#34; shavers that you need to plug in the wall.&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;Cord or cordless&amp;#34;  ? That&#x27;s is the question..!&lt;br /&gt;if you go cordless, go cordless seriously. (and for a fraction of the money)</li>
    <li> As a portable electric razor, this works perfectly well.  Plus it&#x27;s water proof.  It&#x27;s also easy on my skin, unlike other portable razors by the other very well know electric razor company.  Can&#x27;t complain.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t overrate how good this is!</li>
    <li> Tried cutting a thin beard with this and it would not cut, even tried thinner forearm hair as a test and it would not work. Disappointed.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem to cut my husband&#x27;s facial hair. If he wanted me to i&#x27;d return it. Not impressed at all.</li>
    <li> product is just as described.  It is a very nice travel shaver, and it is properly priced.  I have another Braun shaver, which is rechargeable, more expensive, and more sturdy.   I have always been happy with Braun shavers, including this one</li>
    <li> for home or on the go, this is perfect and works very good</li>
    <li> Great for overseas travel as well at home</li>
    <li> Works well for an emergency shave or as a backup. I keep it in the car just in case I forget to shave in the morning, but I definitely wouldn&#x27;t recommend using it every day.</li>
    <li> Maybe I got a dud. but inspecting the o-ring for the battery compartment, I saw no defects, but bad design. Evening after avoiding getting water on the rear of the razor where the batteries are loaded, moisture got in, the contacts corroded and the razor was trashed within a month. The razor itself does a poor job shaving - forget getting neck hairs, this thing can&#x27;t handle any contours. the long-hair trimmer is practically useless - it leaves hair too long for the foil portion to get. all in all a cheaply made product that is typical of braun: the design &#x27;looks&#x27; slick, but is only a cover for a badly made product.</li>
    <li> I bought this to replace a really expensive electrical shaver that had been stolen. It was over $100 cheaper and worksd just as good.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a backup to my manual. It is ok for use if you have 1-2 days growth. Past that it is not good. It is good for trimming at that point.</li>
    <li> The motor is acting weak and not consistant like it is going to die (batterys are new). I only ordered it because I needed a new blade for my old one. So I will just put the blade in my old one when this one dies.</li>
    <li> works better than expected</li>
    <li> I just returned from an 8-day motorcycle tour, during which I shaved daily with this unit.  It&#x27;s compact, well-made and shaves OK but not as well as my Braun Smart Control 190.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend trying to knock down heavy growth, but if you&#x27;re going to use it every day to keep things in check it&#x27;s fine.  The two brand-new AAs wore down to the point I had to change them at day 6.  Decent value.</li>
    <li> I have used Braun shavers before and still have a full sized one.  Very good shaves!  Bought this one for travel.  Good thing I decided to try it out before I packed.  It gave me a nasty scratch the first time I put it up against my face.  I could not see or feel anything with my hands that could have caused the scratch.  I decided not to risk another swipe and my face so I returned it.</li>
    <li> It sort of shaves, but it misses a lot. But this has always been typical of every electric shaver I&#x27;ve ever owned. I have a tough beard-period! Electric shavers don&#x27;t work on tough beards. It gets some whiskers, misses others. So I will go back to the old tried-and-true blade razors. They work! Even disposable razors are far better than the best electric I ever owned. That is just the way it is.</li>
    <li> I purchased this to replace the one I had that, unfortunately, I lost.  I have always gotten great results from this shaver and it is very easy to use and maintain.  Very reliable.</li>
    <li> Hardly shaves my facial hair at all.</li>
    <li> If you miss a whisker for a couple of days, you may have a hard time picking it up in the pores on the shaver head. Slotted heads are much better for this kind of stuff, but they always make my skin feel raw. This one gives the most comfortable shaves I have ever had, enough that this is my second one of this model. ANd I cant believe how long the batteries last.--a good 3 months.</li>
    <li> This is my second mobile shaver.  They are fantastic and great in a pinch especially when one is traveling</li>
    <li> Update 2014-02-16: I&#x27;ve been using this for a few months now. The batteries I purchased, [[ASIN:B009LU9150 eneloop XX 2500mAh Typical / 2400 mAh Minimum, High Capacity, 4 Pack AA Ni-MH Pre-Charged Rechargeable Batteries with 4 Position Charger]], have been working on a single charge for approximately three months now. Kudos to both the batteries and the shaver. Because the batteries are Ni-MH, they need to be run out as much as possible, so I keep pushing them. While occasionally I will notice a drop in the speed of the shaver, it has performed well and continues to do so. I expect the charge to go any day now, but I&#x27;ve been expecting that since December.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I&#x27;ve added a star and I&#x27;m finding the shaver to be excellent. I would also add, however, that the shaver works best if one remembers that one is not attempting to scrub off the hair, but to allow the shaver to cut it off. I have had much better performance once I realized I was pushing a bit too hard.&lt;br /&gt;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;end update&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am quite happy with the M90. I have not quite nailed down how long the batteries last, but I&#x27;d say for me it is lasting approximately 3-4 weeks. I picked up the eneloop XX 2500mAh rechargeable AA from Sanyo and they are working quite well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shaver cuts quite close for me and the quick clipper slides out easily to take care of that odd hair that was missed yesterday and got too long. Best of all is the low profile for packing. I am very serious about my low-profile packing and this fits in my kit nice and flat.</li>
    <li> It was a Christmas gift for my son. I know he uses it.</li>
    <li> My first shaver at 14 was this big, heavy corded Braun foil shaver that my dad bought me back in the mid-80s, and it did a great job.  After going though several different brands of razors and shavers ever since then, I&#x27;ve come back to using this particular Braun to see if the brand was as good as I remembered it.  And my feelings are mostly positive about this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This shaver will not eliminate most hairs all in one fell swoop as I thought it would; I&#x27;ve had other shaver brands that did a more efficient job on that first run.  But this shaver DID extricate and cut hairs a lot more finely and efficiently than any of them did.  The real strength of this shaver is when doing multiple passes, because it will find lots of hairs that would be otherwise missed by other shavers.  It doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;tug&amp;#34; painfully on the longer strands as some other shavers do; you can feel you&#x27;re getting a sharp, deeper and more precise shave with this product than with others.  And the handy side-clipper, though awkward to hand, does a fine job on small areas after some practice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note that for a &amp;#34;mobile&amp;#34; shaver this is larger than you might expect; these are not those small National-brand handy circular razors that you see businessmen pack in their briefcases.  But for the quality of the shaves, I think this one of the best razors I&#x27;ve had in a long time.</li>
    <li> These are great shavers.</li>
    <li> I must have a tough beard because it doesn&#x27;t really give a close shave, but otherwise the design is good and very convenient. it seems to be very easy on battery usage as well.  I travel a lot and the first set of batteries that came with it are still good 3 months later.</li>
    <li> The best value that I have ever bought.  I had a more expensive Braun shaver that I misplaced.  This one does as good a job for much less money.</li>
    <li> takes ages for shaving not a good choice! dont use this after couple of times! waste of money</li>
    <li> GREAT PRICE AND GREAT PRODUCT...FRIEND HAD ONE ON VACATION AND LET ME BARROW IT.. I HAD A NERELCO THAT WAS $250 AND THIS THING BLEW IT AWAY! GREAT PRODUCT</li>
    <li> The shaver is good for its price, infact i bought 2, one as a gift for my friend, but after a few shaves i realized it doesn&#x27;t work that good on neck, so I sent 1 back to amazon, thats the only reason for deducting 1 star... Otherwise very good for the price</li>
    <li> I have been using Braun electric razors for more years than I care to confess.  I have always find they give a close shave and are kind to my sensitive skin.  This latest purchase was made to provide a lightweight battery operated model for use in the car and for overseas travel.  Braun has not let me down and the M90 continues my appreciation of the Braun product.</li>
    <li> Close shave! And the twist type cover for the delicate shave head keeps it protected from damage! Had several others in the past with a clip on cover that seem to always be off every time I went to use it and not long after I ended up with a DAMAGED micro film head! Grrrr! I keep mine in my car and truck for a QUICK touch up, when I am on the RUN and out of time!!! Priced right too! I LIKEY!!!</li>
    <li> Bought this to use while camping because I wanted a razor that ran on batteries. This is a great razor. Shaves as good or better than my everyday rotary head. First time I&#x27;ve used a screen head but I am very pleased. Batteries have lasted nearly 3 weeks of long shaves every day.</li>
    <li> Nicely made, very comfortable.</li>
    <li> It arrived at my home the morning after I ordered it! Amazingggg!</li>
    <li> this my second in a row of this model, I wore out the first one. Great shaver.</li>
    <li> it sucks take my word</li>
    <li> It only works if you don&#x27;t need a shave.</li>
    <li> Shaver was better quality than I expected!</li>
    <li> People complain about battery life on this thing...I use AAs from Harbor Freight (see: cheap), use it to shave my not-so-full-beard 3-5 days/wk, trim my beard/sideburns once/wk, and the batteries last around 3-4 weeks.  This thing is also great for cutting down 3-4 day growth so that a safety razor can actually reach your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s cheap, reliable, small, easy to clean.  Buy it.</li>
    <li> When I ordered this product, I was very excited because Braun is a reputable name in Male Grooming, and the price was amazing. When the item finally came I was astounded by the effectiveness of the product and I was more than happy to tell my friends and family of its wondrous capabilities. However after a few days I fear that the cost efficiency of this product became more credible. Even after changing the batteries the product lost some spunk. A few weeks later the product stopped working completely. I am a bit upset because I expected more usage out of this product. I heard that this product has a warranty, so I&#x27;d be more than happy to chalk this up to a rare glitch, if my product was replaced and worked for more than a MONTH. I&#x27;d also seriously reconsider rewriting an unbiased review. Get back to me guys.</li>
    <li> Great value and \\&quot;IT WORKS\\&quot; very well. So handy when travelling. Unable to purchase in New Zealand as they do not carry this model.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The M90 was a replacement for another Braun mobile shaver which finally gave up after a long life of travelling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended.</li>
    <li> I bought this for dad, it can be washed directly under water and easy to take on to travel.</li>
    <li> (Made in China for Braun) This works great for travel, light weight. Since it is small, it takes a few more passes to shave, but that is to be expected. You can pick up batteries world-wide.  On/Off switch is locked out when cover is closed; no more buzzing baggage. Comes with batteries. Just remember to store with the batteries out.</li>
    <li> Well, the Proctor &amp; Gamble purchase of Gillette (who owned Braun) has finally had its impact on the quality of the product.  Should have known by the curiously low price.  It feels like the Chinese-built junk that it is.  I am surprised it survived past the first shave.  At least it wasn&#x27;t an expensive lesson to learn.  I will continue looking for a decent travel-sized razor.</li>
    <li> Used almost daily for a year now. Am on blood thinners for heart condition. When I shave with a razor it&#x27;s  inevitable  to get a nick. When I  get a nick, I  bleed for over an hour, had to go electric. Boy am I pleased and happy  with this little buzz razor!!! Does take a bit longer than with a blade, but with technique does just as good! Quality little appliance. Runs perfectly well after a year + of use. Have confidence it&#x27;ll  run manny more years. EDITED 22 MAY 2016 Have used several times weekly for going on 3 years. Still shaves, runs and looks like new, Verry pleased with this razor. I use rechargeable AA bateries that I charge in a C.Crane solar charger. So, I basically shave for free!</li>
    <li> TOO HEAVY, IT IRRITATES MY SKIN, POOR DESIGN, BATTERIES DONT LAST.</li>
    <li> Delivers a close shave and is light and convenient to use. Also the shaver does a good job in shaping-up or trimming facial hairs.</li>
    <li> for keeping in your car, this is the best... I run late a lot! runs for months on a set of batteries.</li>
    <li> The Shaver Did A Very Poor Job, The Razor Under The Screen Foil Cut Like It Was 20 Years Old.</li>
    <li> I saw many good reviews on this item and gave it a try. This thing does not shave well. It would leave a couple of hair on my face and would require me to go over it times and times in order to have a good clean shave. Going over and over my skin leave my irritations and is very troublesome. DO NOT recommend this for people who wants to have a clean close shave.&lt;br /&gt;EDIT*&lt;br /&gt;First I thought this item was trash because it wouldn&#x27;t shave off every single hair so I pressed it too hard and cut myself. Since its 20 dollars and i didn&#x27;t want to waste it so I gave it a second try. I run it slowly and take a few minutes going over my skin and now its fine. Its not bad if you don&#x27;t press it so hard. The con is you have to be patience and run it over a couple of times to get rid of some single hair otherwise its good.</li>
    <li> I got this shaver for use while on vacations. It seems to do a decent close shave, although I usually shave every other day and first use a travel Norelco rotory shaver first, being that micro screen shavers (for me) don&#x27;t do well for 2-days facial growth. But despite this, I find it to give a close and comfortable shave and would recommend this product!</li>
    <li> Great shaver for the  price and you don&#x27;t have to worry about the batteries running dead and not having your charger.  Just throw in a couple of &amp;#34;AA&amp;#34;s and your good to go.  Of course I have been using mine for a month now and the batteries are still good.  Shaving quality is not as good as my other shaver, but I guess for the price (mine cost 3 x as much) there are always trade offs.  Good little trimmer on the side as well.</li>
    <li> I used this shaver briefly, just to test it, and it worked well It is a replacement for another Braun portable that had the nerve to die after over ten years. I will use it, in my car, when I either forget to charge my regular also new Braun 7000 series, for touch ups, or when I don&#x27;t have time to shave at home. Unfortunately, I have been testing the new 7000 to see how long it will run before a re-charge, and it have been running for almost 3 weeks without running out of juice.</li>
    <li> I initially bought this for travel and used it on a 3 week trip. The batteries lasted for over a month. I switched to rechargeable batteries and now I use this shaver everyday. I even purchased a second one in case this model is ever unavailable or discontinued. I like it better than the standard electric shaver as the head of the shaver is smaller and easier to get into some areas on the face and neck. It&#x27;s also very easy to clean with the brush that is included. It&#x27;s also a real bargain at the Amazon price.</li>
    <li> For such a cheap shaver this thing actually works. It usually takes me 10 minutes to shave with this thing but even expensive shavers  have failed to shave me very quick.  Get it......you will like it.</li>
    <li> Have had this product before and it is performing as in the past.&lt;br /&gt;It is convenient for traveling...and will continue with this product.</li>
    <li> I love this Braun Travel Shaver - I have one for myself, and I have bought one for each of my sons!!</li>
    <li> Bought this as an emergency shaver for work - I had another shaver but the foil ripped, so I thought the protective cover on this one would be a boon. Wrong - the first time I dropped it, about 3 feet from my desk to a carpeted floor the &amp;#34;protective&amp;#34; cover broke, and the foil tore. Into the garbage with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was at best OK with my moderately coarse beard, didn&#x27;t cope well with hairs that were too &amp;#34;directional&amp;#34; and with it&#x27;s single foil took a few passes to complete the job. The shave was not as close as my previous foil shaver or with a blade. It did poorly at the edges of my goatee and sideburns. The trimmer was not useful, too small, and curved for some odd reason. I went through a set of batteries in about 10 shaves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I won&#x27;t buy another.</li>
    <li> For its size, its really great. I use it every time I am on the road. Good battery life too.</li>
    <li> works well for an inexpensive portable shaver.</li>
    <li> Must husband didn&#x27;t like it. He says it didn&#x27;t cut close enough :(</li>
    <li> Powerful battery operation. Works well.</li>
    <li> Keep this one in car but like it so much buying another</li>
    <li> Does a fair job on my face; but poor on my neck. I carry it on trips in case my good shaver runs out of charge and I have no time to recharge. I suppose its usefulness depends on your beard type.</li>
    <li> Whether you will like this nifty little razor really comes down to your own personal preference.  If you already use a foil razor, you will like this just fine.  If you&#x27;re a rotary razor kind of guy, then it may not work for you.  For normal day-to-day, I am a long time user of a 3-head rotary head razor.  I bought this because I wanted something more portable for travel.  I used it for 2 weeks straight during my vacation.  While I was able to make it work, it doesn&#x27;t do as well for me as the rotary razor.  Things I like:  * Very portable, full-function razor.  It was a substantial device even given its small size.  * AA battery operated (no charging cord required).  After 2 weeks, the batteries were still going.  * Mini beard trimmer works in a pinch for touch ups.  I wouldn&#x27;t rely on it for detailed manicuring or full on beard length trimming, though.  Things I didn&#x27;t  * Doesn&#x27;t do well when hairs curl/bend or are otherwise matted against your face.  Seemed to only handle short hairs that stick straight out.  This is where my rotary razor far exceeds this one.  * Couldn&#x27;t skip a day shaving due to the above issue.  Also, it took me 2 to 3 times longer to shave than I&#x27;m used to at home.  * No cover for razor head to contain shavings.  This will spill everywhere in your suitcase. You&#x27;ll want to keep this in a ziploc bag or similar.</li>
    <li> The Braun M90 Mobile Shaver is definitely a steal if you are only using it in order to do that afternoon overcut.    It&#x27;s obviously not meant to trim your hair, though the included trimmer works wonders literally on sideburns.    I give it 5 stars because I am in the military and use it in the afternoon in order to keep up appearances.</li>
    <li> I owned this model and will be giving two friends for their traveling needs, hope they will be satisfied too!</li>
    <li> After two or three days my beard is too long to go through the holes in the foil, it just bends over and the shaver passes over, only cutting some of it. It will get it all eventually, but it is faster to  wet shave with a razor. Would work well on 5 o&#x27;clock shadow.</li>
    <li> Piece of garbage.  Foil is thinner than tin foil.  It came apart with normal use.  Very disappointed in Braun these days.  Time to change brands!</li>
    <li> Love this razor, great to keep in the car for a quick clean up before meeting someone like a client</li>
    <li> Needed a battery powered model for my gym bag and this is it.  Works great, lots of features, even a trimmer.</li>
    <li> can&#x27;t find any other product for this price and using it every day like to have one in every home!!!</li>
    <li> This product works great and most of all feels very well made. It is designed to not turn on in the luggage via a turn-lock. Also, I used it in my carry-on and got no questions by security. A+!</li>
    <li> I use this shaver solely for the outside hairs on my ears (yeah, I&#x27;m getting old).  It works really well for this purpose.  Cuts close to the skin and doesn&#x27;t catch or nick my ears.  But I don&#x27;t use this to shave my face.  I have pretty thick facial hair and use a double-edged razor.  I tried this shaver on my face once or twice.  It doesn&#x27;t cut my facial hair that close to the skin, at least on my couple of attempts.  So, I highly recommend this shaver for cutting the outer hairs on your ears, not so much for facial hair.  I&#x27;ll add I do really like its design, especially the guard that slides over to protect the foil.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m sorry I purchased this razor. I spent approximately twenty minutes shaving  and  had difficulty  under the neck and chin area. The Braun was unable to give a satisfactory cut, no matter how hard I  ran it over my stubble. When I finally gave up, my face still felt rough with  stubble. I went back to using my razor for a clean shave.</li>
    <li> This is ok for using for the 5 o&#x27;clock shadow but not good on 2 day growth!!!</li>
    <li> Coarse, thick beards need not apply.</li>
    <li> Performs well but takes as long as a shave with a conventional razor.  Glad I bought it.</li>
    <li> The good news is that this shaver is compact and fits into a travel kit.  The bad news is that I still need to carry a disposable razor to touch up after using this shaver.</li>
    <li> I bought this model for quick shaves when I don&#x27;t have the time to use a regular razor. It cuts on a so-so basis, consistent with its low price, but doesn&#x27;t cut low angled hairs well.</li>
    <li> I keep a battery powered shaver in my car and have had one from a big box store for years. When it died, I tried this one. I love it ! much more quiet and compact. It has a protective cover that will keep it from damage in my car&#x27;s console.</li>
    <li> It works great everyone loves it, need to improve on the side cutter other-wiz it is great and priced rite</li>
    <li> not as good as expected, but easy for travel.</li>
    <li> Works very good for what I wanted, I use it for an evening touch-up. I do not use it every day.</li>
    <li> A MUST have Braun Razor, kept as a spare...&lt;br /&gt;This Razor works on only 2x AA batteries; this is a great feature, especially if you forgot to re-charge your regular Razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Note: This Razor actually shaves pretty good.&lt;br /&gt;- Also noticed that the &amp;#34;foil&amp;#34; is made of a substance that &amp;#34;slides&amp;#34; easily over the skin, even without Electric Shave Lotion. But... without the Electric Shave Lotion, you can only go over any area of skin a few times before the skin starts to get raw. Always best to use the Lotion for total comfort.&lt;br /&gt;- At the price of this Razor (around $25), I would even recommend a person purchase 2 or 3 of these Braun razors. And... you can use the re-chargeable AA batteries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nailbreak, in Irvine, California</li>
    <li> I just love this shaver, it is the second one I bought. Gave out the first to my father in law and he loves it. Easy to use and affordable!</li>
    <li> This is the second one I use . The shaving is always under your control and no surprise . You will be looking good with the use of it and enjoy the soft and easy of shaving on the roads and at home</li>
    <li> Bought one at a yard sale for a buck. I liked it so much, that I bought Another one. Put two rechargeable batteries in both of them and they run for ever.  I am compete satisfied with how they shave me.</li>
    <li> The perfect update to my old M series. Buy a new &amp; updated M90 vs replacement parts for an older unit - You&#x27;ll save $$$ &amp; be glad you did!</li>
    <li> Works OK, battery lasts a long time. Won&#x27;t replace your razor but will get you by for a day or so.</li>
    <li> Excelente producto, funciona muy bien y facil de llevar al trabajo, llego rapido y ademas incluye pilas gratis.&lt;br /&gt;Facil de usarlo</li>
    <li> Use this shaver every day and it is great... Have it&#x27;s big brother at home however I need to shave by 3 everyday so this is a winner.</li>
    <li> A soldi battery powered razor.  Well designed; gives a close shave.  Easy to clean; battery life better than expected.  A good camping razor</li>
    <li> Elegant, beautiful. This watch offer good advantages to low price. It quality is good and I recommend the product. .</li>
    <li> Great product. I bought a different first. I wished I had bought this one. Perfect for the car.</li>
    <li> The Braun M-90 has a serious defect: It always misses a few hairs.  These hairs get longer day by day, until they have to be cut with another razor!</li>
    <li> This is a great little shaver for everyday use, especially if you have sensitive skin. Rechargeable batteries last for a couple of weeks without trouble, even with longer shaving times.</li>
    <li> I recently had surgery on my right shoulder.  Because of being unable to use my usual blade razor for at least a month, I purchased this little electric razor.  It has worked beautifully, producing a reasonably close shave, is small and comfortable to use, and I&#x27;m able to get about 30 shaves per set of AA batteries.  And all that for a great price.</li>
    <li> Had this product before.  For a battery operated shaver, you can&#x27;t beat the Braun.  Haven&#x27;t tried it in the shower, but I didn&#x27;t buy it for that reason anyway.  Great product, priced very good.</li>
    <li> Great value. I dry shave with it and it get&#x27;s probably 90% of my face on the first pass, then 95% on the second. Has trouble getting the softer hair on the neck but it&#x27;s a compromise I&#x27;ll take since I never get any more in-grown hairs or razor burn.</li>
    <li> UPDATE: 04 27 2013 ( The seller Braun recently had grossly impugned my privacy in violating Amazon&#x27;s seller agreements, personally contacting me in reference to my previous review. After Amazon refunded me for a defective Braun Mobile Shaver to which I returned and replaced with a new mobile shaver. They (Braun) contacted my private home phone line leaving two \\&quot;urgent\\&quot; voicemails of in turn to reply.  First they did not call from a business or corporate line I was left a personal cell phone to reply and call back.  Second they tried to bribe me with a gift card to remove my previous review said to be most unflattering and detrimental to their sales of this product and company.  I intended to comply and I was supposed to receive and email in ten minutes and it has now been two days, either way this was most unprofessional, discourteous, and in poor taste as a means to a resolution. received it today 04 18 2013 was defected, Amazon did refund me for the first one so today 04 20 2013 received 2nd one and was very please that I did buy another one and would highly recommend razor to anyone who would like to buy it. 100% please!!!!!</li>
    <li> I just received the new Braun Mobile Shaver M-90. Too soon to evaluate. I will be reporting again indue time.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great if you don&#x27;t grow a lot of facial hair.  I don&#x27;t and as long as I use it every day or so it works well.  I used this when I was away from an outlet for a month and the batteries lasted the entire time, even with me shaving every day.</li>
    <li> And now my son, nephews and every teenager that needs to shave and has breakouts. Very easy on the face.</li>
    <li> Like shaving with a rabid wolverine. It took about an hour of shaving in rush hour traffick to get a result of irritated red skin and patchy beard spots.</li>
    <li> My son &amp; husband both love this compact shaver.</li>
    <li> This is my second Mobile shaver from Braun and very happy with it. I bought 2 more for gifts!</li>
    <li> I planned to use this only while camping but it performs so well I use it daily.  I have ordered a second one for when the foil and blades need replacing.</li>
    <li> This was a Christmas gift for my husband.  We&#x27;d selected it after reading reviews for several mobile shavers, and this Braun model seemed to have a lot of reviews, with a good:bad balance equal or slightly better than the others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My husband&#x27;s beard is probably average (maybe a little light in some areas) and his skin isn&#x27;t especially sensitive.  He&#x27;d used an electric shaver more than 10 years ago, and he was pretty happy with typical shavers back then. (He recalls them as single-foil or single-blade shavers.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since then, he&#x27;s used a razor, but he wasn&#x27;t expecting this Braun shaver to come even close to that.  Mostly, he wanted the Braun for touch-ups, between razor shaves, especially when we&#x27;re on the road.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This razor worked fine in some areas on his face (such as his chin), but in other areas (such as his cheek), the Braun -- even with three or four passes -- didn&#x27;t seem to do much, if anything at all.  So, for someone who&#x27;s aiming for the slightly unkempt look, this might be adequate or even ideal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We&#x27;re returning the razor with some disappointment.  We&#x27;d read the good and lukewarm reviews for this razor, and we&#x27;d hoped my husband&#x27;s experience would be like the more favorable reviews. Unfortunately, our review matches many of the low-star comments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The razor isn&#x27;t completely useless, but -- for my husband -- it wasn&#x27;t good enough to add to his suitcase when we travel, not even for touch-ups.</li>
    <li> I have pretty course/thick hair so my stubble can get pretty feisty. With that said, the Braun M90 does an adequate job, but I&#x27;m starting to miss my Panasonic shaver that I recently laid to rest. It takes a few goes for me to get a clean shave and even with that, I&#x27;ll have some straggling hairs that I need to focus on and hold the shaver at exactly the right angle to get at.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was hoping the trimmer on the side would take care of those harder to get spots, but it&#x27;s definitely lacking in power. It barely cuts. I end up half cutting/half tugging, which isn&#x27;t a very pleasant experience. I&#x27;ve pretty much given up on the trimmer altogether since now I get all anxious that it&#x27;ll just keep tugging at my hair whenever I use it hah.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s definitely no high end shaver, more like a Civic or maybe even a Yaris. Oh well, I guess it was cheap.</li>
    <li> My husband uses this on our travels. It&#x27;s well made and works well.</li>
    <li> The Braun M90 Mobile Shaver is one of the best products I have ever used!  The last time I purchased the item was 2 years ago.  It was available at a retailer, but they no longer carried it.  The battery operated razor gives you a clean, comfortable shave. This is a must have device for men on the go. The seller was outstanding!</li>
    <li> received product fast great product</li>
    <li> This works great, but the trimmer is curved so it&#x27;s almost useless for getting a straight side burn.  The shaver works great for touching up under my nose and other areas after shaving with a Schick Quatro in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it while traveling because there is nothing better for the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also like that it uses batteries.  I prefer the reliability of carrying tiny spare batteries over having to be sure something is charged. (Wish they would go back and make the older basic model from 25 years ago that had a straight pop up trimmer in a battery model instead of rechargeable.)</li>
    <li> As a grandpa, I am fully aware that when I turned 55, I now need to shave my outer ear. Hair grows like crazy even overnight. So for years I would try to use my razor, no good, blood everywhere.&lt;br /&gt;  Now this shaver is perfect...I only use it on my ears...no more cuts...two AA alkaline batteries included last forever.</li>
    <li> great product and service</li>
    <li> I use to have a old Braun single foil shaver. I used it till the foil had worn thru. I have bought several brands since then none really doing the quick easy job that old Braun did. I never spent alot thou maybe $60 max. I saw this Braun for $18 so ok. It works great. has that roll up guard so it doesn&#x27;t get the foil damaged, battery life is great. You don&#x27;t have to charge, fool around, etc. just a quick shave.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work well, misses a lot of hair on both face and body</li>
    <li> Nice little travel razor. Trimmer is nice feature. I owned the model without trimmer previously.  Good for two or three days on road. Excellent value.</li>
    <li> TERRIBLE. I bought this for my boyfriend 6 months ago because he&#x27;s always on the go and forgetting to shave before work. It tore up his face, irritated his skin, and gave him razor burn that lasted a couple of days. He&#x27;s tried it different ways since then, thinking he just had to &amp;#34;get the hang of using an electric razor&amp;#34; -- he&#x27;s tried shaving wet, dry, with cream, trimming first (which, FYI, took forever with the tiny, 1 length trimmer on the side), shaving when he had very little growth. Every time it irritates his skin.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m pleasantly surprised by this electric shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hadn&#x27;t owned or used an electric shaver since my teens in the late &#x27;90s or early 2000&#x27;s. When I took to shaving my head with disposable razors, it just never made sense to keep an electric razor for my face. And when I took to simply allowing my facial hair to grow out (either as a crazy beard or as reasonably maintained stubble), I never had a need for a razor that would give me a clean-shave,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I bought this shaver on a whim (perhaps thinking I should try the clean-shaven look to create the appearance that I&#x27;m putting in some amount of effort). Given the price, and given that I&#x27;ve strictly used disposable razors for the better part of my adult life, I wasn&#x27;t expecting much from this shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But it does the job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I took some old hair clippers (meant to be used on the head) and gave my facial hair a quick buzz without any attachments, just to get the hair as short as possible in preparation for this little shaver. And I found that it gave me a pretty smooth shave. It took longer than I would have expected (perhaps because I have poor technique or an oddly shaped face, or perhaps I just had unreasonable expectations because it&#x27;s been so long since I shaved with an electric shaver).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And my skin felt irritated in a handful of spots. Though, as I explained, I&#x27;ve been in the habit of never really sporting a clean-shave look... so it makes sense that my skin was unaccustomed to such a close shave after so long with a beard or with scruff of some kind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still, I am pleased with the results. With some more attention paid to my technique, and with some more attention paid to my skin (pre- and after-shave skin products of some kind, I imagine), I feel like I would be able to produce a very close shave with minimal effort, time, or discomfort.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s amazing.  The gray thing is just a cover while you&#x27;re not using the shaver.  It works on just two double A batteries, and works well.  It has a little tiny brush that you won&#x27;t lose because it has a spot near the bottom of the shaver that it snaps into.  Also, the little silver thing sticking out the side in the image is a trimmer. I&#x27;ve had a little water on it and it didn&#x27;t stop working.  The foil over the razor comes off so you can brush the hairs out and empty it.  10/10</li>
    <li> small and compact. head cover and brush stay with the razor. Does a big razor job with a little work. batteries were still going after 10 days.</li>
    <li> Shaves better than $300 shavers! Sounds too good to be true, but this is one of those few, rare, products that actually does what it says and then some. At 20 BUCKS a pop you could shave over 10 years for less than the cost if one suposedly great, and very expensive mistake. Yes all foils wear out but so what? It&#x27;s fantastic!</li>
    <li> For what it is and for what it&#x27;s supposed to do, this is a definite buy!  Is it a great razor?  No way!  However it is perfect for what it&#x27;s designed and intended for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I keep the M90 in my car or backpack, and if I forget to shave, or need a quick clean-up, it&#x27;s always there.  It seems to last forever on the 2 AA batteries.  I would say I might use it four times a month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the shaving experience...it does take a longer time than my sweet Braun Series 5 that I use for home and travel.  But heck, this is $20.  Is the foil as durable?  No!  But I don&#x27;t expect that.  I&#x27;ve had this razor now for about 3 years and it always works.  Plus the pivoting head protector is a pretty nice piece of design.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So don&#x27;t go in expecting a Braun or Panasonic home razor experience.  What you get is a small, light and inexpensive take anywhere razor that will last.</li>
    <li> Great shaver&lt;br /&gt;I own about 3 of these and each time it die (drop it on the floor or just die off use)&lt;br /&gt;I have to buy a new one since the foild are so hard to find or so expencive&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But this is a good shaver it works good and last a long time&lt;br /&gt;I have one in my house, car, and office for a quick shave when i need it</li>
    <li> Boy, for a portable, battery-powered shaver--this delivers.  Can be used wet or dry--I usually use it wet, though I have used it dry. NEVER once have I gotten razor burn--which has been a problem for me in the past with more expensive electric razors.  I use it every couple of days when I don&#x27;t feel like using a razor blade.  Gives a close enough shave that makes you presentable.  Originally purchased my first one when I was undergoing some serious chemo for lengthy periods of time and had no platelets and I couldn&#x27;t afford the occasion cut or nick from a razor blade.  My beard growth is slow, probably need to shave every day and a half to two days; beard is coarse.</li>
    <li> I bought this shaver to replace a similar product from Braun, which I have used with pleasure for several years. The old one finally started to slow down, hence the latest purchase ... it&#x27;s better in every way than the one I am replacing, with a powerful motor and ease of use ... my previous one was the best travel razor I&#x27;ve owned, this one is better ... worth every cent ...</li>
    <li> I had hopes on this but it didn&#x27;t work well for me. It just doesn&#x27;t shave well for me. Tried several times with different methods, using with or without shaving gel. It always leave with like 1/3 inches left of hair on face, afterwards it would give me skin irritation with some burning sensation. Tried to press harder to make it shave deeper but ended up making me bleed. I don&#x27;t understand how it works for most people but not a select few unless my shaver is semi broken before i purchased it. I guess i&#x27;ll stick back to regular old non electronic shaver again.</li>
    <li> Given my previous experiences with other mobile shavers I wasn&#x27;t expecting much when I bought this. It was a very pleasant surprise! Now there is no issue with being a little short on time in the morning; I almost look forward to using this and shaving in the car. Cuts smooth and clean.</li>
    <li> This shaver is exactly what it is advertised as. Is it the best shaver ever? No. But for the money and convenience it is.  It is light, easy to clean and easy to use. I like using it for those days when I&#x27;m too busy to use my razor and for that it works great.</li>
    <li> Bought this shaver to use after shoulder surgery when I could not use my dominant are with a lather shave. It is great!!! As smooth or smoother than a an old fashioned with shaving cream. Will probably continue using it after recovery</li>
    <li> This is a great portable shaver I&#x27;ve used this for many years with no problems.The blades stay sharp for many years,easy to clean and easy top find and replace batteries.I do highly recommend this portable shaver.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t say enough about this feat of engineering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS&lt;br /&gt;This razor is:&lt;br /&gt;Super Light&lt;br /&gt;One Piece Complete - Batteries, brush, cover all fit perfectly together. The cover is amazing, just flip and throw into glove-box to protect the foil.&lt;br /&gt;Batteries - 2 AAs last a long time, much longer than I thought. 5-6 days shaving in car 2 times per day (in and outbound)&lt;br /&gt;I use Eneloop rechargeables from Costco&lt;br /&gt;Shaves very well if you are working with 1 day growth/stubble&lt;br /&gt;You have to go laterally and at different angles to get the tough spots under jawbone etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS&lt;br /&gt;The only con that has been remarked on here is that if you have anything longer than stubble, it can&#x27;t get it.&lt;br /&gt;Longer hairs or very soft hairs just fold over and don&#x27;t get clipped.&lt;br /&gt;The edger blade is so small you can&#x27;t really use it except for the most basic of trim jobs. So you&#x27;ll have to get out your double edged razor or clippers to take care of the heavier growth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall highly recommend. I got TWO! One in my bathroom and one in car.</li>
    <li> Great razor!  Love it!  Does it work as good as my big home razor? No. Does it work great near the end of the day to freshen up before an evening outing?  YES.  Would highly recommend!!</li>
    <li> For me this small travel shaver worked well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Good Shave&lt;br /&gt;- Built in foil cover so there is no separate foil cover/shield to loose&lt;br /&gt;-  Uses AA Batteries available anywhere, no need to bring a power cord (saves space)&lt;br /&gt;- Compact and easy to travel with&lt;br /&gt;- Low price, especially when compared to high end home shavers</li>
    <li> cheap alternative to blades</li>
    <li> This is my only shaver.  Works perfectly at home and easy to carry when away.</li>
    <li> 2016 update: I wish they had a rechargeable model like this one (I think it used to be the 1 series). I use this as my primary daily shaver. Not quite as close shave as a few others, but does a great job and cleans easily. The thick screen means longevity, as some models (varying brands) have problems with quick screen wear-out. I don&#x27;t use the integral trimmer, I have a dedicated trimmer for that. Latest one is not quite as good at shaving as 2014 model, takes a few more passes. No shaver will shave as close as a razor FYI. My other was 2yrs old and didn&#x27;t seem to shave as fast as it used to, but the new one isn&#x27;t much better. Still much better than the other Braun models AFAICT.</li>
    <li> Highly recommendable...</li>
    <li> This little beauty does an amazing job as a daily shaver. I keep it in my drawer at work. It&#x27;s perfect for mowing that five o&#x27;clock shadow. It&#x27;s quick, close, and even picks up those difficult flat-growing hairs on the neck. I&#x27;m not sure how it would work with more than a day&#x27;s growth, which I&#x27;ve found problematic with every electric shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This shaver cuts extremely close, outperforming even my Braun 5770. I surmise this is due to the thinness of the foil, which also would explain the short lifetime mentioned in many of the reviews.</li>
    <li> My husband needed a good but gentle shaver - would not be able to use his regular shaver while at the hospital. This did it! And it was delivered promptly.</li>
    <li> It is a classic braun product. Simple design, light and durable&lt;br /&gt;Perfect for light hair/mustache&lt;br /&gt;  B R A U N</li>
    <li> I forgot to close the protective cover on my first one and ruined the foil.. which is not only difficult to find but very expensive too (costs more than the shaver itself!).. this shaver is superb.. light, handy and effective.. would buy again</li>
    <li> Great design and ease ou use and cleaning!! Batteries last well with this product.  Side trimmer is a nice touch.</li>
    <li> Bought this unit to replace my old one that was stolen at the Lakeland Regional Medical Center. Taking Heprin and multiple blood thinners for Angina, I&#x27;m careful about shaving with a blade. This unit works well and makes me feel safer  than a blade, even a safety(?) razor.</li>
    <li> Very good product when it comes to travel, gives good shave, recommended for those who likes to be shaved while camping or in a trip...</li>
    <li> Have shaved for 6 weeks using the same set of batteries. These are not rechargeable just AA. I probably use it 3 times a week and a blade the rest of the time.</li>
    <li> I need to have an electric shaver for travelling without those awkward charger. This one fit my need perfectly. The battery can be lasting for more than two months if used daily.</li>
    <li> An okay shaver, ok for short cuts like back to back days but dont even try putting this on your face after a 3 day mark, the face of the blade sucks at getting hair pulls and leaves spots.. I switched back to buying disposables and cream not really worth it thinking about it now..</li>
    <li> I previously own a M-30 MobileShave, It was the same in terms of looks and stuff.&lt;br /&gt;Since i can&#x27;t get the replacement for the top piece.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  I decided to order this one this, Since it does the same thing, except this comes with a side trimmer which i have no idea how it works for that, but oh well.&lt;br /&gt;  In terms of quality built and all, this is still my favorite as i always bring this around, as I&#x27;m in the military, This has been convenient and easy to bring around in training grounds and such.</li>
    <li> When you buy a travel shaver razor it assumes a few things, the first is that you need a quick, decent shave outside your normal shaving \\&quot;environment\\&quot; and the second is that you have some way or something that does a better job at home.  There are too many reviews here comparing this travel shaver to high end, full size, rotary and foil shavers.  Can you really compare the two classes?  This is a travel size, battery powered, foil shaver and it is good at what it does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For me, a rotary shaver works better than a foil version and let&#x27;s be honest, nothing beats a proper razor. However, before I purchased this product I already knew that a foil shaver wouldn&#x27;t work as well for me based on the way the hair grows in on my face and the thickness of my beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still, I bought this shaver for times when I am away and needed something:&lt;br /&gt;-that I could use in between blade and cream shaves&lt;br /&gt;-that would do the job quickly&lt;br /&gt;-that was small&lt;br /&gt;-that was easy to pack&lt;br /&gt;-AND if it were lost, stolen or broken, I wouldn&#x27;t be out a lot of cash&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The integrated stubble brush, all-in-one foil guard and waterproof casing are perfect.  What a great design!  Having the shaver run with AA batteries means you can always find replacements and two AA&#x27;s lasted a 10 day trip with two light shaves a day (8 o&#x27;clock and 5 o&#x27;clock).  The foil shave was good enough and when I wanted something more, I turned to the mighty blades. To each his own, but several light passes in different directions ended up being very effective!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So review and rate this travel shaver for what it is, a good, well designed shaver for those times when you are away from home!</li>
    <li> I have purchased several of these. I have one at home, work, my SUV and spouse car.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What else can I say....Fantastic producthttp://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002TQ4AO0/ref&#x3D;cm_cr_rev_prod_img</li>
    <li> No issues. Not the quietest shaver, but none truly are. Batteries seem to be holding up. Provides a smooth shave, similar I feel to most higher priced shavers.</li>
    <li> At this point I&#x27;ve bought 3 and to my knowledge all are working fine (bought 1 for myself and the other 2 as gifts)</li>
    <li> ok - my husband has purchased 5 of these already - office, home, travel bag, vacation house, car. he can spent whatever he wants on a razor, but thinks this is the best. he likes that side little trimmer, too, on the new models. he has also given them as gifts to our sons-in-law. he loves it when he can find a great item at not a great expense! this is worth trying!</li>
    <li> Nice heavy duty feel.  Good product with plenty of power and a close shaver!</li>
    <li> Does the job well , very convenient to use and carry, and economically priced.  I have bought 3 so far, for gift and a spare.  Haven&#x27;t had to use the spare  yet, but am prepared in case the fragile foil problem occurs that others have reported.</li>
    <li> This is my second Braun Mobile Shaver, the first one still works great but the foil cracked. It has lasted me about five years. Tried to order a replacement foil but the cost was around $13 with shipping from an online seller, where I bought a brand new shaver here for $19. Works great and lasts. Great product for a great price.</li>
    <li> This is one of the best tracel shavers out there. The battery lasts a long time, the shave is very close and makes a great travel shaver.</li>
    <li> Perfect for a travel shaver.  Does a very good job.  Easy to use, lightweight.  It does what you would expect.</li>
    <li> Bought this for business travel. This is a great little razor, and the batteries last forever in it. Would definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Great travel shaver. You cannot turn it on accidentally, and that is important. In the past I gotten to the hotel only to find that the shaver was shaving during the trip and the batteries were dead. It also provides a reasonably close shave. I have a couple of other Braun shavers, and this one is just as good as the others.</li>
    <li> Very happy with the braun razor</li>
    <li> I like these shavers so much that I now have four of them and leave them in different rooms and in my cars.  They are so handy, compleatly portable, and cut my wiskers very well.  They are also great for a late-in-the-day touch up.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s exactly what I wanted! This kind of electric razor is hard to find.Glad it is made by such a reputable company.</li>
    <li> My prior version of Braun travel shaver had the foil crack when I dropped it on the floor, so I bought a new one.  The old one was 4 years old and although they looked exactly the same, they had a slightly different model number.  I&#x27;ve been using a Braun electric travel shaver for over 10 years straight.  I&#x27;m not extremely hairy and do not have a tough beard.</li>
    <li> This works as well as my large Braun and is as cheap as a replacement head. Using NiMH batteries, it goes longer between charges.</li>
    <li> Works perfect, great for travel. Don&#x27;t think it would hold up as an everyday shave but it is sturdy and def a great travel buzzer.</li>
    <li> Dear fellow Amazon customer:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Braun Silver M90 Mobile/Travel Shaver impressed my budget.  The first one cost me a bit over $25.00, delivered to my door.  Using the unit meant ease of operation as the simplicity met my personal choice.  The battery ‘AA’ powered unit boasted water resistance; seemingly a fine purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Today is January 25, 2014.  I purchased the unit on June 4, 2013 taking receipt within a week or two.  The shaver performed as well as I could request.  However, this week, the unit is failing. I have used it every day.  Usually, I quickly shave in the shower with a twin blade, and since trimming the hair line requires a mirror, I touch up these areas as well as reinforce the full shave closeness of the entire face with this unit.  The shaver performed to my expectation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The week of January 25, 2014, the Braun Silver M90 Mobile/Travel Shaver has begun to start-stop for no apparent reason.  Today, the saver discontinued functioning at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I own a second that I keep in my travel bag.  I will use it under the same conditions and discover if the unit is designed to fail after such short lifespan of usage.  I share this as this failure is a quality circumstance whether the second shaver operates effectively or not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pursuit for reimbursement is not reasonable, as the cost is quite low.  I dislike throwaways as I feel we are all likely to live into futurity where our own waste stream-vomit overcomes personal health.  I want others to have an opportunity to share in my personal experience concerning the usage of a national brand product.  There seems to be no work and the only budgetary activity we can perform is sharing data that may support more effective personal spending.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We share as we observe the continuance of our wage-labor valued union representation crushed while the owners of production continue the great income earning opportunity from investment, apparently centered upon electronics and petroleum based products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does Amazon sell condoms?  Too many consumers; let the environment degradation become the depopulating war replacement.  Let the capitalist class weaken the value of the labor…timely!?!  Watch us share data as we continue to observe our wage-labor valued union representation crushed via the means of production.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I attend regular major political party participation in hope of developing labor representation.  Become involved in your children’s education.  Do not let the corporations take the objective nature of schooling out of the social structure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This first of two Braun shavers were not worth $25.00, in my consumer minded opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Donald T. Coughlntronics and petroleum based products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does Amazon sell condoms?  Too many consumers; let the environment degradation become the depopulating war replacement.

Coughln</li>
    <li> Handy and no &amp;#34;burn sensation.&amp;#34; I tried all the other brands, but none came close, and the price was the kicker.</li>
    <li> Purchased to replace an old dead rechargeable travel shaver. Pros. Good shave for travel or touch ups at work. I like the side trimmer (M60 doesn&#x27;t have it). Uses replaceable batteries, not battery that can&#x27;t be replaced (like the rechargeable). Switch can&#x27;t accidentally turn on and buzz in airport line (like the old one) Cons. Heavier and bigger than the old one (one star off for weight).</li>
    <li> bought this as a gift for my dad, he always used to have a &amp;#34;cheap&amp;#34; shaver in his truck that recently broke, and he loved that shaver, so I looked around and found this one. He really likes it, I may end up buying myself one as well</li>
    <li> I have been using Braun shavers for years. I replace them only when the plastic catches break apart or when the motor electrical contacts corrode so badly until the motor can&#x27;t spin.  When the latter happens, I had to press the body hard for the motor to spin.  Taking the shaver apart to clean the corrosion extends its life by another few months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using this is safer than using razor blades!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I chose this particular model as it had a very useful hair trimmer at the side.  There are slightly cheaper models without the hair trimmer ...  It also comes with a very handy stiff brush to clean off the moustache/beard dust from the cutters.</li>
    <li> Every bit as good a shave as the high-dollar rechargeable Braun shavers at a fraction of the cost. If you use the Sanyo Eneloop high-perf rechargeable AA cells you have what amounts to a rechargeable Braun with the added advantage of being able replace the batt pack when it wears our, rather than having to pay to have the pack replaced in a $75+ unit.</li>
    <li> Works ok. Just don&#x27;t let your beard get entrenched! It just takes longer then a multi head.</li>
    <li> Thanks. It was exactly what he was looking for.  Made a perfect gift. And was much cheaper than at the stores.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time and works good.</li>
    <li> I travel a lot and this is an indispensable piece of gear.  The 2 AAs last a long time, it shaves close, and is great quality.  Now, it&#x27;s even better as it&#x27;s waterproof.  This allows you to clean the blades under the faucet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best feature for travel is the flip style cover.  This prevents it from being accidentally turned on when it gets jostled in your bag.  This was a problem with another style shaver I once had.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t say enough good things about it.  I don&#x27;t believe there is any better travel shaver out there.</li>
    <li> My husband had one for years that finally gave out and he loves this style for travelling.  Good shaver too.</li>
    <li> Not a close shave at all.</li>
    <li> This cheap little razor, battery operated, performs as good or better than the most expensive ones.  It&#x27;s my husband&#x27;s second and was cheaper to re-buy than replace the worn out screen in his old one.</li>
    <li> This really works well for traveling. Much nicer than the old model I had been using for like 20 years....ordered another to keep in my car!</li>
    <li> quality is fine enough for this price, the commodity itself is ok. But there should be more information about the razor on the website page.</li>
    <li> I had the previous P70 model. The screen finally gave out and it was almost as cheap to get this new one as it is to buy a screen. If this one works as well as the P70 I will be happy. The P70 still works fine if I can find a screen that isn&#x27;t so expensive.</li>
    <li> Handy dandy. Works well. Easy to clean</li>
    <li> Piece of crap, does nothing to trim your hair. Last time I act like a fool and trust what some site says the &amp;#34;top five cheap razors&amp;#34; or whatever are.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s really depressing to think that people make things to not work on purpose (and then go straight to some landfill) and even moreso that they pass some kind of quality check for the leading countries of the world.</li>
    <li> This little puppy is FANTASTIC!! So much better than my Remington &amp;#34;full size&amp;#34; (which broke after two weeks -- and the broken piece was going to cost almost as much as the razor&#x27;s purchase price!!).&lt;br /&gt;BUY THIS SHAVER!!</li>
    <li> Good razor. This is now my third one. Delivered on time. Good packaging. I like this razor for use with rechargeable batteries. And I like the small trimmer attached. My first one had that and my second one did not and I missed it.</li>
    <li> This is an absolutely great, compact, light, brilliantly designed, self contained, razor.  It runs great on eneloop rechargeables and even has a trimmer--for the low price, I&#x27;ll probably buy another just to have in the car!</li>
    <li> I aready had the same shaver without the side trimmer. I was really looking forward to not having to carry around an trimmer wand too but the trimmer is just not as affective as the small stick ones available in every drug store and Walmart. I still carry both with me. Still love the moblie shavers but I regret buying this special trimmer verison for a higher price then their cheaper blue regular ones available at Walmart.</li>
    <li> Good product but rather flimsy.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had one of these for over 20 years, having bought the first one to stash in my field gear when I was a Marine.  It&#x27;s old school tech may not get as tight a shave as newer units, but it&#x27;s reliable, water proof and absolutely tough as a nails.  At home, I use a razor.  On the road, this is always in my bag and ready to go!</li>
    <li> This shaver was purchased to replace a similar but older model with a bad “foil”. It is used for trimming only and I suspect that it would be nominal for a man&#x27;s overall shaving because of the shaving head size. Fair pricing and timely delivery.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately, mine will not turn on despite having changed the batteries, so this is a go-back.</li>
    <li> Very nice compact little shaver with a clever design that avoids need for a separate case and prevents accidental switching on while traveling. The built in trimmer is neat. Not as smooth a shave as with the full-size Braun, but great for travel.</li>
    <li> One of the best shavers I&#x27;ve had. Just have some loose hairs that I need to go over multiple times. Then theres also little hairs/shavings that fall off as well. Unsure what that is about.. Kinda worth the money. Broke down on me once so I had to reinstall the batteries.</li>
    <li> Yep, Its a cordless portable shaver...  It works and does the job pretty well and can&#x27;t be beat for the money.  It&#x27;s not a super quick shave however.  Also they have upgraded the razor foil to a thicker longer lasting foil, but by durability comes a thicker foil. As you wear in the foil, the shave becomes closer and smoother over time.  The good news, it is very light, very portable and is powered by two AA batteries.  On average, shaving daily or mostly daily, the batteries last about a month or more and can be stretched for another week if you aren&#x27;t in a hurry.&lt;br /&gt;It also sports a small pop-out hair trimmer, ideal for removing that pesky mustache or beard (hair over 1/4 inch) prior to shaving. and great for touchups on sideburns.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve owned and older version of this shaver for over two years now and short of the foil (shave screen) wearing out after a year or so, these $20 shavers are pretty durable.  I love mine.</li>
    <li> Good for the price, would be better if it was rechargeable, we will see how well it will hold up.</li>
    <li> Nice, compact shaver, but did not cut white hairs on cheek and neck. Another compact shaver I have also has a problem with these hairs</li>
    <li> The product is working well as described.</li>
    <li> This was purchased to replace an older model Braun shaver. Love it especially for the fact that the cleaning brush fits securely in the bottom of the shaver and the protective cap cannot get lost.</li>
    <li> Definitely happy with this product, fast shipment, and the razor was as expected and works excellently.</li>
    <li> Have to say Braun make good products.  This unit is excellent for travelling, easy to use and clean.  Batter life appears good also.  No complaints yet and am pleased with value for money.</li>
    <li> Have the same model that is 3-4 years old and is running well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Purchased this one to keep in the office.  It came pack in a paper box instead of hard plastic shrink wrapped.  Trims just as well as the old one but motor noticeably noisier.</li>
    <li> I love this shaver.  It is very slim, easy to hold and gives a close shave.  I purchased it planning to use it for travel but like it so much I use it everyday.</li>
    <li> Excellent travel shaver. Very small and light. Pretty close shave. Uses regular batteries so its less expensive to maintain. The trimmer doesn&#x27;t do much at all. Worth the price nevertheless.</li>
    <li> Good design and efficiency. Very  easy to carry and store. The use of cells make this shaver a &amp;#34;best friend&amp;#34; for all hours. It was a great acquisition.</li>
    <li> Super razor at a really good price .Gad I got mine!</li>
    <li> Admittedly I&#x27;m not the right person reviewing the shaver, having had a full beard all my life, I purchased the shaver just for trimming purposes, but it seams well made and does what I expected - cant go wrong for a shaver under $20</li>
    <li> I had an older Remington travel razor that I have used for years. Due to some oversight I left some sunscreen in my travel bag that leaked. I started looking for a replacement on Amazon. I have a rechargeable Braun that I keep at home that is okay, but I&#x27;m not fond of the screen. I have to go over and over my beard with it. When this travel razor arrived I tried it the next morning. It worked great. I actually like this screen more than my everyday razor. I highly recommend it. The trimmer is not the best but is a welcomed feature.</li>
    <li> My son is incarcerated and a battery operated razor is all he is allowed.  He had one earlier but it went missing and I asked that I be allowed to have another one sent to him.  He was lost without his little &amp;#34;Braun&amp;#34;.  Thanks, mom</li>
    <li> Latest edition in their line of small powerful travel or home shavers. Runs long time on 2AA batteries ...superb engineering ...even water cleanable. Retractable trimmer and rotating protective cover!</li>
    <li> Had a rechargeable Braun that just wouldn&#x27;t quit and then it finally did (after about 10 years).  Came across this little battery-powered beauty and couldn&#x27;t believe the price.  Wouldn&#x27;t have believed it if I didn&#x27;t know first hand how great Braun quality is.  I&#x27;m so impressed with this little thing.  It&#x27;s as good as any electric shaver I&#x27;ve ever had and much better than most.  Perfect for travel.  Nice features.  Very well engineered.  Buy it, you&#x27;ll love it!</li>
    <li> This is great, I have another model of a Braun Shaver at home, but since I work late at times, this is great for a touch up at work.  Keeps me looking professional.</li>
    <li> I have had several of the higher end models and I can get just as close shave!  May take a little longer because of the head size but you can&#x27;t beat it for the price.</li>
    <li> have used this product for years with nice close shave and easy to maintain in my car. no need to remember to charge it, just keep a few batteries in the glove compartment.</li>
    <li> I got this to shave under my nose, where my $300 Panasonic has some problems. And also as a backup shaver for the car - for quick touch-ups. But it works so well sometimes it&#x27;s the only shaver I bother to use. I don&#x27;t think you can go wrong with this puppy.</li>
    <li> Terrific bang-for-the-buck purchase. The travel version lacks the &#x27;brawn&#x27; (pun intended) of the everyday shaver but is more than adequate as a backup for roadtrips etc.</li>
    <li> A super razor, works for weeks on 2 AAA batteries, gives a great shave. Travels extremely well.</li>
    <li> This is the best battery powered shaver money can buy!  My first one cost $9.00 in the eighties and lasted for 20 years.  This one cost $15 and is even better since it can be cleaned in running water.  The shave is good and it handles well with good grip and surfaces.  Battery lasts quite a while depending, of course, on amount of use,  Highly recommend this shaver for a quick shave.</li>
    <li> I also use this as a travel shaver and is very usefull for on the road and even here at home for a quick shave.&lt;br /&gt;TX&amp;#60; bookworm</li>
    <li> For the price it can&#x27;t be beat.  It shaves nice and close and feels good when finished.&lt;br /&gt;The batteries last a long time.</li>
    <li> This is  a great battery operated shaver. It is small but handles most lengths of beard.The trimmer works well also.  I recommend it</li>
    <li> I collect compact automatic razors, both antique and modern, and this is a great product, particularly if you have a mustache, because it has a trimmer, and the trimmer works very well.  You can also use the trimmer on your sideburns, which means this is a great razor for longer trips when your sideburns might start getting a little ratty.  The shave seems to be just about as close as the Philips Norelco HQ40/33, which I might prefer for a one or two night trip because it does not miss stray hairs.  The M90 will miss a hair occasionally... but, since you have the trimmer, if you notice a stray hair on the third day of a trip, you can then trim that hair low enough to catch it with the foil.  (The Braun M60 has no trimmer, so if you have a choice between the M90 and the M60, definitely get the M90.)  The Sanyo SV M730 is another option-- it also misses hairs, but more rarely, and it&#x27;s even smaller and comes with a hard case, but it has no trimmer, so I think the M90 may be a better choice all-around.  The M90s case is nicely designed to protect the foil and keep the razor from turning on in your bag, it&#x27;s got a good weight to it, and it looks kind of sleek.  The fact that you can do a basic cleaning just by running water over it is very convenient as well (you will want to open it up and do a full cleaning and oiling occasionally, of course.)  If you have a beard or particularly a mustache, and you want to buy one compact travel razor, this is the unit to get, particularly for longer trips.  Probably the most versatile automatic razor I own.</li>
    <li> I would recommend this shaver to anyone who needs to shave and finds the time and place inconvenient.&lt;br /&gt;This is simply the best device of its kind.  Discreet. Effective. Affordable.  In a word: Fabulous!&lt;br /&gt;Get one.</li>
    <li> Love this shaver! Im repurchasing this shaver after having the same one for 5 YEARS! Old one finally sputtered out. I HAVE found it for $10 at RiteAid type stores, but cant easily find it now, and $20 is well worth this great product by Braun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very CLOSE shave, Waterproof for easy rinse or shower shaving, and the side trimmer, is great iff you want a little stubble.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**I dont have very thick facial hair. AND can only grow a goatie.</li>
    <li> great shaver and I like the beard/neck hair/body hair trimmer included.  its small but works anywhere on the body you need it.</li>
    <li> Especially ineffective and very slow with longer beard (couple of days). Rotary shavers work much better for me . .</li>
    <li> Got this to replace the one my boyfriend had. He was surprised to see I found one at a great price.</li>
    <li> It does the job as competently as it can for the size.  The clean is tricky and the screen issue many complain about would be lessened using a light touch.</li>
    <li> Great razor for on the go people. Have two one for home and other in car.</li>
    <li> A well-made shaver at a reasonable price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Prior to this purchase, I hadn&#x27;t owned an electric shaver in the past 30 years, so I don&#x27;t have much basis for comparison with competing shavers, but I am happy with my purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I switched from blade shaving because blades were irritating my face and because I wanted to be able to easily shave without water while camping.  This will work nicely for those purposes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find it very easy to clean as well.  Rather than using the handy, attached brush, though, I remove the screen and tap the bottom of the screen housing against the sink to dislodge debris.  Then I blow the debris out of the shaver and replace the screen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do find myself feeling a need to shave twice a day, and I take that as an indicator that perhaps this doesn&#x27;t shave as close as a blade, but it&#x27;s close enough.  This has made shaving simple, convenient, and painless.</li>
    <li> This is a good travel razor.  I owned Braun&#x27;s previous model as well. It is also good to keep in the car for needed touch-ups.  This newer model changed the sideburn trimmer. The new trimmer is not as good for sideburns, but might be better for mustaches.</li>
    <li> Not as close a shave as the old micro this foil Braun but good as it doesn&#x27;t break like the micro thin head.</li>
    <li> Bought this based on the pretty good reviews.  Was very disappointed. It did not shave well at all.  Went over my face multiple times and it missed a ton of hairs.  I use electric shavers all the time, so it is not about getting used to electric shavers or anything.  It also hasa very strong vibration which is quite annoying.  I would not recommend</li>
    <li> First shaver for my teen-aged son. He likes it and it sure gets rid of his peach fuzz and mustache shadow well. Not sure how it will work as his beard gets stronger but for now it does the job.</li>
    <li> I bought this to replace an older model Braun 370 cordless shaver.  It&#x27;s amazing but this seems to be an exact duplicate of the 370 model which I used successfully for many years until the foil finally disintegrated from use and age. Even the instructions are exactly the same. I kept the model 370 in my glove compartment for quick shaves before going into work, or before meeting my significant other on a date.  I used this shaver twice since receiving it and it is every bit as good as my last Braun.  I guess Braun figured if (the design) ain&#x27;t broke, why fix it? I hope to have and use this shaver for at least four more years, but now that I am retired and will take better care of it,  maybe it can last me even longer.</li>
    <li> these are great, perfect travel or secondary shaver.</li>
    <li> Great value; I have gone through a few of these, using them daily.  Batteries last a good chunk of time.  The shape of the holes in the screen have been altered, and I think the design is even better now.</li>
    <li> My husband liked it very much.</li>
    <li> Excellent little shaver. Batteries last a long time. The side trimmer is not very useful.</li>
    <li> I thought ordered a brand new product...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It comes in a zipper bag... with no box, manual, no included battery.... and dust on the product...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I strongly doubt this was a new product...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I give two star because the product arrived quicker than I anticipated...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thinking of returning this now. :(</li>
    <li> This shaver has some compelling points to it such as the rotating cover to prevent damage to the top foil. Batteries are easy to insert and the device has a nice large on/off button in the center of the silver rotating shield. The shaver shaves close and glides without pulling or tearing facial hair. The width of the shaver fits comfortably within my hand and the overall device appears to be solidly built. I would recommend this to others.</li>
    <li> Perfect for international travel. Works great.</li>
    <li> I have a fairly light beard.  This works well for me and I love the fact that I can use standard batteries.  I have used this now for over three months on the first set of double a batteries.  It will not work if its really cold I&#x27;d say below 20 F.  Otherwise it runs very well.  I have used it with shave gel and rinsed it in the sink with no adverse effects.  The slide out clipper is small but works well. Overall and excellent product.</li>
    <li> This little shaver is the best of all Ive used in the price range it sells for.  The shaver is great for the quick clean up shave just before you need to meet someone or have an important appointment where you need to have a clean shave.  Highly recommended</li>
    <li> Great to have a movile shaver that runs on batteries. easy to use and great to have around for afternoon touch ups</li>
    <li> Not bad given the price and the mobility it gives. really sturdy and good quality for the small built. recommended!</li>
    <li> Honestly, the thing barely cuts anything. It&#x27;s great if you always wants a 3 o&#x27;clock shadow.</li>
    <li> good value for product</li>
    <li> Was looking for a good travel unit. Got tired of taking my larger Braun electric shaver with me when I travel. I have had this unit about a year now and could not be happier. The batteries seem to last quite a long time. Cleans pretty easy. Will need a replacement foil now and again - but all razors need that. Built quite nice. Was impressed when I got it.</li>
    <li> One of the better portable electric razors.</li>
    <li> this is my second one,  i bought the same more than 4 years ago, while it did last till the side trimmer stopped working ...thought of buying a new one with same mode,  but  ehh  good things never stay the same in production !  it has louder noise than the previous one i had, and u feel the heat from the inner machine on ur skin , if u kept it some time on ur skin , u can feel the burn ....&lt;br /&gt;not as good quality from braun as it used to be</li>
    <li> Good value and works well.</li>
    <li> Works Ok. The trimmer is what I use most often.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve shaved with blades/shaving cream my whole life.  But I&#x27;m getting tired of the routine.  So I got to looking for a mobile solution I could do in the car.  My requirement for a mobile shaver was to be powered by external batteries because I don&#x27;t want to have to continually charge it and be moving it around where I may forget it.  So these were my two options for a battery powered shaver.  I like that I had a choice between a foil and a rotary.  Tried this and the Norelco PQ208 battery powered rotary shaver.  I must say I prefer this one by far.  It is a little more efficient.  I can see how some others may have broken the shaving plate, it does &amp;#34;give&amp;#34; just a little, it&#x27;s flexible for a reason, to provide a closer shave.  It&#x27;s not overly flexible, but if you press hard enough, it gives a little.  I can imagine pressing too hard in a small spot could compromise the shaving plate, but I don&#x27;t think that is normal use.  No one should press that hard for a close shave.  My beard comes in very thick.  With daily or every other day use, it performs admirably.  It takes repeated strokes to shave, like any electric shaver I&#x27;ve ever had, but not as many as a rotary.  One stop light, and I&#x27;m pretty much done.  I keep a disposable razor in the car with me for those occasional stubborn spots.  Typically I don&#x27;t have to use it, but I have it in case.  I wondered if the foil would get tight places, like under the nose... it does.  The design allows to cover the foil when not in use, and I like this a lot since it&#x27;s in my vehicle.  It seems very durable also, very well made.  It&#x27;s easy to clean, easy to handle, and works for me perfectly.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m cool with this guy.. I have no luck shaving. My skin just hates it, so for the price, I&#x27;m getting a lot because it doesn&#x27;t really tear up my face too much. It&#x27;s neat and portable which is handy. You just replace the batteries when it starts to run slow and boom. No chords. No problems.</li>
    <li> When I first bought one of these shavers twenty years, the quality was much better, compared to this one. It works but not as good as it should. Why are they making things so cheaply these days?</li>
    <li> Have had several electric razors over the years, but this inexpensive model outshaves them all (including some much pricier Brauns).  Easy to clean, and uses two AA batteries (a good use for Eneloops).  The rotating cover and nesting cleaning brush are slick design features, and it feels like a quality solid item when you use it.  Not quite blade close, but as good a shave as I&#x27;ve ever gotten from an electric.  Have one for home and one in my travel toiletry bag.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> It gives a horrible shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have fairly fine, slow growing, facial hair...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It will not remove 2 day stubble, at all.....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It takes 20 minutes to shave 1 day stubble...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great travel-design; horrible implementation..</li>
    <li> I needed a shaver after forgetting to bring the charging cord with my Series 5 while traveling for five months (the replacement cord is impossible to find). I got this in spite of the various negative reviews, and I must say, it works better than I was expecting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As many people have said, it won&#x27;t do very well with two or three days&#x27; growth, but if I use it every day, and occasionally finish with a disposable blade, it&#x27;s good enough. It takes a little longer than the Series 5 to get the job done, which can be inconvenient, but it&#x27;s a good solution to my problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using it for about three weeks, and I&#x27;m careful not to damage the foil, which has so far held up. If it lasts for the five months that I need it, it will have been a bargain. Honestly, how much of a shaver can you expect for the $18.79 that I paid? It&#x27;s much better than I expected.</li>
    <li> The shaver per se is O.K., but the trimmer is located where it&#x27;s almost impossible to use, and does not trim well at all. I have a Braun battery portable already, and was looking for one with a trimmer, but this one does not fit the bill.</li>
    <li> I had one of the older versions of this Braun 30 years ago and really liked the convenience.  When it wore out or was lost (i can&#x27;t remember), I couldn&#x27;t find a replacement.  Perhaps Braun discontinued the razor for awhile.  In any case, I replaced it with an acceptable Panasonic that was too large for the dopp kit - and it also had a recharging cube for the wall outlet that was too large to be convenient.  When the Panasonic got dropped on a hotel floor a while back, Amazon produced this M90 - which i s what I&#x27;ve wanted all along.  Now I&#x27;m back to a convenient, small, battery powered Braun like the one i had all those years ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like this for the convenience - the size does not challenge the space in the dopp kit.  The battery lasts quite awhile (many dozens of my shaves).  it cleans up easily under the faucet.  the shave is relatively close and acceptable.  it also has a head-cover that prevents the foil and blades from being damaged when knocked around.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this as a travel razor not a primary razor - for the latter i still prefer the bulky Norelco 3-head that provides a great shave but i certainly wouldn&#x27;t want to try to lug it around while travelling.  This is not the best razor you can get, but it is certainly a contender for best and most convenient travel razor. The price is also an advantage - my Panasonic was 4 times the price, bulky, but no better for the shaves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For a travel razor this is terrific.</li>
    <li> Perfect for on the go. Just what I need. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I purchased to replace an older mobile Braun shaver I&#x27;ve lost. Uses two AA batteries. Unit has a nice easy to use trimmer. Foil razor head gives a good comfortable shave. Travel cover just swings out of the way and cannot be lost. Perfect for my travel kit as no charger is needed.</li>
    <li> History:&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve started using electric shavers a long time ago. The first one was a wired Philips Philishave with three heads (gift from my dad to a teenage pimple face). It always worked fine, it was bought about 15 years ago and it is still working pretty well. My problem with it was always that it made my neck irritated and red as hell. Since it was not prepared for wet use, I&#x27;ve tried to use it with talc (as a lubricator) in my face what has improved the irritated skin condition a lot. That time I was using this shaver once or twice a week, because I was a student and my face hair was not that dense/thick.&lt;br /&gt;After that I&#x27;ve decided to buy a new one which could be used in the shower. So I bought a new rechargeable Philips Philishave triple head with the pull-and-cut action (similar to the PowerTouch). I can say that this shaver is great. I still use it as my main shaver to keep in my house. Unfortunatelly, even with the ability to be used in the shower (wet), it still makes my neck red and irritated. It does a shave as close as a razor, but has this problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Braun M90:&lt;br /&gt;This shaver is the best. It shaves as close as the razor, and leaves my neck MUCH LESS irritated and red. Now I&#x27;m planning to buy a main one from Braun to keep in my house. Let&#x27;s see how much the cutting head will last, since this is a concern among the users.</li>
    <li> I had very High Expectations very disappointment, this is not better than another electric razor in this price range.It did not work on my i have a normal beard and does not wok.</li>
    <li> I have a big Braun with cleaning system at home, but I often take one or two-day trips and wanted something very light and compact for my carry on. This cuts as good as my main shaver and is pretty easy on batteries. Love the self contained, compact nature of this. Definitely recommend for the frequent traveler.</li>
    <li> This shaver is not worth owning. I have a very light beard and it has trouble cutting it. Pulls more out than cuts.&lt;br /&gt;May take  for longer camping trips, but otherwise, would never use it.</li>
    <li> Excellent shaver for on the go! Works wonderful and is easy to use. Like the protective shield that covers the blades!</li>
    <li> I have been using the Braun mobile for the past 10 years.....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a very tough beard and I use it after I shave to get the spots that I have missed.....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And it is great in a pinch when traveling.....</li>
    <li> Husband loves it for travel</li>
    <li> I had one of these before and after a few years it broke. So I replaced it with a new one. Still made to the same standard as the older unit.</li>
    <li> This shaver is used for traveling--but it doesn&#x27;t shave as close as I wanted or expected.  It is very convenient.</li>
    <li> This is not a great shaver.  It is great in the fact it runs on batteries but doesn&#x27;t give you a great shave.</li>
    <li> Great shaver for travel. Built solid and shaves well. Leave it to Braun to come up with a clever design. Great value for the price.</li>
    <li> Terrific travel shaver.  Nice close shave.  Good size and excellent design.</li>
    <li> cheap, works well, portable!!! highly recommended.</li>
    <li> OKay.  This costs under $20.00 US.  It uses AA batteries.  The first week of shaving it was so-so, then as it broke in, it started shaving well.  I&#x27;ve been shaving with it ever since I got it. It shaves well and it shaves close.  Cleaning is simple, just wash it under running water and shake dry.&lt;br /&gt;This is as good a shave as the one I get with a $150.00 + shaver.  It works and the trimmer actually trims.  When the cutter gets dull, I&#x27;ll just order another one.  It works well, shaves clean, and is easy to maintain; all for under twenty dollars.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m sold.</li>
    <li> Braun is simply the best electric shaver company in the world. Even this travel model that I carry in my glove compartment has never disappointed.</li>
    <li> I bought a very similar Braun Mobile Shaver some years back in a panic. That being that I was scheduled to lecture in about an hour but I was straight off a plane and a ten hour flight from Europe. Also they&#x27;d \\&quot;misplaced\\&quot; my luggage. There&#x27;s only so much \\&quot;clean\\&quot; you can achieve in a lavatory, even in first class, on a plane. Of course, I have a beard that could easily stand a twice a day shaving. In the gift shop they had this razor, somewhat less expensive then now, on offer and, thinking, what the hell? If it works, terrific, if not I can explain about a plane, no razor-I believe I would have thrown in a rough crossing which kept everyone belted in and got on with my remarks. Understand, I was in a city I did not know at all, in a rented car, stripped to my undershirt-being very, very grateful that batteries were included, trying to steer, follow a sheet of printed directions, coat my underarms with deodorant - also courtesy the gift shp - and shave. This is a piece that is easy to turn on and off and if you can hold it-with the foil side pointed toward your skin and I add that as I once saw someone trying to use the other end....-and as I careened down an expressway, one hand on the wheel, another operating an aerosol can  (yes, I sprayed my face) and then clutching this, this toy to my face. Subsequently after my speech, several of the professors who knew how briefly I&#x27;d arrived, complimented me on how  fresh I looked. I mentally thanked Braun and American Gillette who owns them as well as Gillette for their deodorant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Was it as good as a shave I give myself with my own hand whipped foam and straight razor? No, but then it&#x27;s not supposed to be. This is a salvation on the hoof for any man trapped between looking like a total slob and looking a bit disheveled but tidy. As others have said, it&#x27;s hopeless on long hairs but...if you&#x27;ve got facial air that long, this isn&#x27;t the razor you should be using. It&#x27;s practical, takes up little space, works to the degree possible and is easy on batteries. Although a bit more expensive than it once was, you&#x27;re in for years of service-one thing to remember is to take the batteries out if there&#x27;s to be a long period without usage. (but you do that on anything that&#x27;s battery operated) I&#x27;m more than happy, I&#x27;m content knowing that when I need it, it will be there. Oh, and as the one I bought years ago? Still serviceable, in a drawer by my phone where, when turned on, I can claim I&#x27;m in the bathroom shaving and might I call whoever is at the other end when I&#x27;m finished? Don&#x27;t laugh, this is a very viable excuse....and you needn&#x27;t be in the bathroom to use it.</li>
    <li> JUNK MIGHT SHAVE HAIR OF MY ARM, BUT OFF MY FACE, FORGET IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> For only $20 it deserves five stars. Although the shave may not be as comfortable as some higher priced floating or foil head shavers, it shaves closer than most, including my $150+ Braun. Battery life is great. I keep it in my car console. If it quit working or I lost it, I would buy another one.</li>
    <li> Love it close cut, leave in truck and then travel with easy change batteries, need to get another to keep in travel bag...</li>
    <li> The shaver is very good at removing tiny moustache hair at the side of the lips. It gave a clean shave when it go round the area that I place it to. The shave protector can be easily remove for the rotating blade to be flash clean. I found the motor vibration rather strong when switch on but overall it is very good product compare to other electric shavers I use before</li>
    <li> This shaver does exactly what I wanted it to do.  I wanted a battery powered electric shaver to use for occasional international travel.  The Braun Mobile Shaver is conveniently sized, uses batteries that are easily available virtually anywhere in the world, and is well protected by its built-in housing.  I have taken this on several trips in the year I have owned it, and have not yet had to change the batteries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Though it is perfect for my uses, I only give it four stars because the quality of the shave is no better than you would expect with a foil design.  It takes several slow passes to do an adequate job, and you never really get a completely smooth face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, this is a great product for occasional travel. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> He does not leave home without it.</li>
    <li> Great when you travel.</li>
    <li> It is great! I tried lots of shavers but I still prefer this one. Great feeling and no even a bit hurting your skin.</li>
    <li> Best portible shaver ever</li>
    <li> this thing is dynamite!!!!!  I use it to shave my head and works great!!!  I can&#x27;t believe how long the battery seems to last---well worth the money!!!  Want a bigger one but none of them seem to work plugged in, and pretty expensive not to be able to use one once the battery dies!!!</li>
    <li> Dollar for dollar, this is a GREAT little battery-operated shaver.  It shaves as well as my old Series 3 Braun, is waterproof (OK, resistant), cleans easily and the batteries test almost brand new after using every day for 2 months.  Easy to travel with, convenient (try sharing a hotel bathroom with your gal lately?)  What&#x27;s not to like?  I may not go back to my old Braun.</li>
    <li> Owned it for a year as a most days shaver. No longer cuts well. Recently bought and much prefer the Philips Norelco PQ208/40 Travel Electric Razor. It&#x27;s quieter and cuts much closer with less irritation.</li>
    <li> Excellent device for a very reasonable price.  I used in the car when I am too late to shave at home.  will shop again.</li>
    <li> Performs beyond expectation and great value for money. Good battery life, lovely design and an overall quality product. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> This did not cut one hair on my face. The slide out trimmer worked but that is all that worked. Very disappointed in Braun.</li>
    <li> Wanted an inexpensive shaver to keep in the center console of my car. Bought this thinking it would be OK, turns out it gives a great shave. Great razor!</li>
    <li> Great product. Easy to use and carry around with you. I&#x27;m Asian and don&#x27;t have that much facial hair and this great!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this shaver.  I do not use it for my daily shave except when traveling.  I often use it to touch up on the evening or when I am in a rush.  It generally does an excellent job and has held up over the last 3 years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Compact design with a nice integrated protective cover&lt;br /&gt;Very close shave&lt;br /&gt;Does not chew my skin up as much as rotary shavers&lt;br /&gt;Has a little pop out trimmer for sideburns, etc.&lt;br /&gt;Takes widely available AA batteries that last a long time&lt;br /&gt;Durable (3 years so far and still going)&lt;br /&gt;Easy to clean&lt;br /&gt;Inexpensive&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Often misses longer or curled hairs.  Best for short growth.</li>
    <li> - Provide a great shave and does not pull on hairs &#x3D; no irritation&lt;br /&gt;- Mobile&lt;br /&gt;- Battery provide 3+ weeks of regular daily shaving&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used several more expensive shavers over the years. This product by no means is inferior to those. I&#x27;ve been using it for over 2 years. Blade still sharp and working as new. Purchased a few more for families.</li>
    <li> I have been using one of these style Braun shavers for over twenty years.  Each lasted about ten years!!!  I don&#x27;t know that you can get a cheaper and quicker shave by any other means!  Great to give as gifts!</li>
    <li> This razor gives close, comfortable shaves.&lt;br /&gt;Battery life is far better than advertised.&lt;br /&gt;For the price, it is a best buy.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m right handed and recently had to have my right shoulder rotator cuff sewn back together. My cousin had the same operation several months before me, so I pumped him for advice. When it came to shaving, he said I would still be able to shave, but I should be prepared to lose a lot of blood.&lt;br /&gt;That was enough to set me looking for an alternative to the standard blade razor. I settled on the Braun Mobile M90 and am glad I did. It works reasonably well. It is light weight, cordless, runs 3 to 6 weeks on two AA cell batteries, and includes a trimmer that I consider essential. The reason the trimmer is essential is that it is difficult to get every last whisker every time one shaves with a shaver that requires you to get the whiskers up through little tiny holes in a screen. And if you miss one or a few for more than one day it is likely that the reason is they are laying down against your skin and you will never be able to get them as they grow longer and longer. But with the handy little extendable trimmer on the M90, it is easy to catch such strays and bring their length back down so the main shaver can perform. I call this a great job of engineering and will hang onto it for future travel, where I can&#x27;t always count on access to the large handy mirrors and good lighting that I have in my home.</li>
    <li> Xmass gift.  Thanks. David A</li>
    <li> Exceeded my expectations in quality and performance. I get a very close shave and the AA rechargeable batteries that I use (Sanyo Eneloops) last me more than a month between charges.&lt;br /&gt;The unit is waterproof and can be cleaned with soap and water or used in the shower (never tried that).</li>
    <li> this shaver is great, perfect for the car on the way to work while in traffic, easy to use, clean and change batteries.</li>
    <li> This is a great product. Lighter than a regular Braun shaver and great for short business trips. I bought one for my husband and he loved using it but unfortunately left his wash bag in a hotel. So he asked if I could get another, which I did.</li>
    <li> After owning my 1st one for about a month, I dropped it and the foil cracked. Luckily the crack was at one of the ends of the foil so I was able to put tape over the crack and still use the shaver.  Since I only used the shaver when I travel it wasn&#x27;t an issue. Meanwhile I searched online for a new foil but found it is about 1/2 the cost of a new shaver. Over a year later I eventually bought another one. I&#x27;ve read about this foil being on the weaker side and wonder if my situation was because of a weaker foil or because I dropped it. Likely it&#x27;s probably both.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the performance of the shaver, it seems to do the job. It has all the basics: a trimmer, a built in brush, and the main shaver. It works just fine for travelling.</li>
    <li> I have a Braun Series 7 that I use on a regular basis but I bought this to throw in my travel bag or take with me when I might have an occasion for a later afternoon shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It take a little longer than the Series 7 but that&#x27;s to be expected just because of the difference in design.  Definitely a good backup shaver and priced right!</li>
    <li> This shaver exceeded expectations. I bought it to use on an international trip because of its small size. It worked admirably!</li>
    <li> The Braun M90 is a most amazing shaver. I have used this style of Braun shaver now for a number of years. At first I purchased one for travel only, but then started to use it as my daily shaver. I have a rather heavy beard, too - and this little shaver seems to have no trouble giving me a good, close shave. The small integrated hair trimmer also works well. A set of regular AA batteries last over a month. Rechargeable batteries (Eneloop) last about two weeks. Since these shavers are so inexpensive, I keep one in my travel pack and one at home. When the screen wears out, I just toss the whole shaver into the electronic recycle bin and buy a whole new shaver. I realize that is not so great ecologically, but the screens seem to last quite a long time - minimizing the frequency of shaver replacement.</li>
    <li> My boyfriend loves this shaver</li>
    <li> I have had 5 or 6 of these over the past years - All have worked in an excellent manner in the field or back at home - The foil will wear and crack or pit but this is normal wear and tear - The replacement foil goes for about $11.00 and with shipping it places the cost of getting a replacement almost at the price of a new razor - So I just buy a new one every two years or so...</li>
    <li> Best little shaver i have. Cuts better than my more expensive rotary shaver. Great little shaver for on the go shaving or just everyday shaving.</li>
    <li> Pro: The razor works incredibly fast and takes no time to shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con: The razor does not cut that deep, so there are still very small stubbles remaining, but only noticeable to touch.</li>
    <li> I bought this along with several Remington MSC-140 shavers. The Remingtons cost half as much, shave twice as fast and much closer and only drawback was that the foils came loose after extended usage.The M90 is a neat design but it&#x27;s like having a great looking car that doesn&#x27;t run. Shaving time was much longer and then it failed completely because of an internal problem with on/off after very limited use. i strongly recommend against buying this product.</li>
    <li> Gave this to my dad and he thinks it&#x27;s wonderful. Great for on the run shaving in the car if you have thin whiskers or a young beard. It runs on 2 AA batteries (not rechargeable) so when power is turned on it doesn&#x27;t sound very strong, but cleaning is a breeze</li>
    <li> Great compact product. Allows me to travel and continue using an electric shaver. Blades are fine, but too much is involved when you need water and shaving cream. This product simplifies your life.  I just wished it were lighter.</li>
    <li> This item is worthless!!!  Bought it because I had surgery on a hand and am not able to shave one handed with my usual razor. I figured the electric would be manageable with one hand. It might be possible with a razor that works. This one just does not shave much of anything and I do not have a very thick beard. I have owned Braun razors in the past that worked just fine. With this one I end up having to re-do with my regular razor anyway, as hard as it is with one hand which now takes 3 times as long. Think I&#x27;ll just let the beard grow!!!</li>
    <li> powerful feel with great clean cuts. highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using it everyday for over a month now; works pretty well for clean daily shaves. The batteries last around a month which isn&#x27;t too bad. I really like the cover and the brush storage at the bottom. Definitely recommended!</li>
    <li> This is a great improvement over the older model I had previously. Shave is as good as the full-size rechargeable I use normally.</li>
    <li> Works fine. Not much point in buying replacement foils though, they cost almost as much as a new shaver would.</li>
    <li> The shaver does not work well, and did not leave my face with a clean shave. I didn&#x27;t give it a one, since it is pretty cheap and is nice and portable.</li>
    <li> Best electric travel shaver I have ever had!  Just what I expected as I have had one before.  Great for travel or home use.</li>
    <li> So far so good, although it is a bit larger than I&#x27;d anticipated.  Still smaller than my everyday Braun shaver.</li>
    <li> Since I travel to places that don&#x27;t always have electrical outlets and hot water in the bathroom, I wanted a battery powered razor. This one works great. I would recommend it to anyone who wants or needs a good travel razor.</li>
    <li> For the price I paid, this shaver is awesome.  It does not cause any reddness or itching after each shave.  Batteries seem to go for a long time.  I use this for both home and traveling.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a travel-friendly shaver and noticed the mixed reviews about the mobile shaver.  My primary purchasing requirement was the use of AA or AAA batteries during my vacation to another state.  I have previously used electric shavers and use them exclusively because razor blades cause an allergic reaction to my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My first shaving experience with the device was very poor:  it did not cut the hairs.  Although hesitate, I decided to keep it since it was much more convenient to use battery power for a quick shave.  On my second trial, I used the long hair trimmer on the side and held it over my facial hair (not against it).  The results were much better and improved with multiple passes.  You have to be patient with this shaver!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mobile shaver is compact, easy to use and feels like a durable, high-quality product.  A \\&quot;nice to have\\&quot; feature would be rubberized grip for the body which can be slippery sometimes.  The device might be too large for some people (think of a large soap bar).  Most of the flaws are common to many electric shavers: not a close shave, foil that does not cut facial hair, loud buzzing noise, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note:  I did not take it through airport security because I was not sure if the TSA would allow it.  I try to avoid any flight delays.</li>
    <li> The best razor my husband has ever used. I plan to order two more.</li>
    <li> Low quality product-- poor cutting ability</li>
    <li> I use to have a Shaveman that I got from Walmart, and that lasted me 6+ years.  I went looking for it again and didn&#x27;t see it at Walmart.  Rather than shop around online I decided to see what Walmart options I could find.  At first I considered shelling out for a 50-60 dollar Norelco or Wahl.  But I saw this little Braun mobile and looked it up on amazon reviews.  Pretty good so I pulled the trigger and bought it.  $15 out the door.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- cuts smoothly/softly&lt;br /&gt;- has a buffer zone that makes it comfortable to shave&lt;br /&gt;- comes with a little brush accessory to clean the cover and near the blade&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- doesn&#x27;t get the closest shave.  I think this is in part from the thick mesh that makes it comfortable unfortunately causes it to not get the absolute closest shave.  Its still good but Im sure to a closer one but I avoid the burns.&lt;br /&gt;- doesn&#x27;t have a trimmer to cut longer hair.  Im use to having this with my shave man and it helped for the times I forget to shave and my facial hair gets longer than 1 cm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Again minor complaints.  For the price and the potential risk of shelling out +$60 on something that doesn&#x27;t work down the road, this is certainly worth every penny.  I have had it for a couple weeks so I don&#x27;t know if it will last more than that but I don&#x27;t anticipate it dying.  Usually the mesh screen goes first but considering the thickness of this screen and fortification of the attachment I for some reason doubt it.  If something does happen I&#x27;ll update.</li>
    <li> It is typical good German design and construction. Good size and operation. It handles very smoothly. You can not go wrong with this item</li>
    <li> Bought this for my father since he constantly travels and he loves it!</li>
    <li> I bought this for camping trips with my sons&#x27; scout troop. Not quite as close a shave as I get from a blade at home, but it gets the job done quickly without the need for hot water. Heavy for a long backpack trip, but fine for a weekend outing.</li>
    <li> Portable and reliable. This was a duplication of an old shaver for my second home. I still have one I bought years ago.&lt;br /&gt;Glad to find it again.</li>
    <li> This product isn&#x27;t as great as I thought it&#x27;d be. Waste in money. Don&#x27;t bother.</li>
    <li> Closet electric shave I ever had</li>
    <li> UnfortunateIy, I dropped and broke the previous version of this shaver.  The earlier version had a different design for the trimmer which is better than the trimmer in this product.  This trimmer can nick you, drawing blood.  It takes 2 ordinary AA batteries, a better  system, than products with rechargeable cells.</li>
    <li> This was my first foil shaver. It worked really well. I didn&#x27;t realize how delicate the foil was or how badly it would hurt my face when I dragged the ruined foil over my chin. I&#x27;ve had 2 foil shavers since then and they both kind of suck. I&#x27;m about to buy a new Braun M90. This time I&#x27;ll be more careful top keep the foil protected.</li>
    <li> Great portable shaver for travel, and for at home.  Always loved how it shaves.  It has great power, it is portable, functional, and priced well. I would definitely purchase again.</li>
    <li> Great unit  I have had it for over a month now on the same batterys. Close smooth shave</li>
    <li> I use this while travelling internationally while freshening up in major airport hubs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good points:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Uses AA batteries (I use rechargeables in it), I got this for travel and it&#x27;s replacing a previous model I have had for 5 years in the same series. Having AA&#x27;s means you can grab any batteries in an emergency if it goes flat on the road.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No electric shaver does anywhere near the job a good razor and shaving cream does BUT for $30 ish, this IS as good as any expensive shaver I have used (Philips SensoTouch @ $190). So in that context this shaver &#x3D; WIN!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bad points:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;More difficult to clean than the previous model. What were your designers thinking Braun, why the recessed lip around the shaver mechanism?</li>
    <li> Cheap, efficent, good finish</li>
    <li> Low cost shaver, poor design, takes 3 times as long to shave as my Norelco and even then it was a lousy shave.  Used it less than a dozen times and the battery release tab broke making it useless.  Don&#x27;t waste your money...</li>
    <li> I just switched this past year to the braun foil shaver.  I really like it and will not be going back to the rotary one I used.  Going on a quick trip and instead of bringing the 3 foil shaver, I took a look at this travel one.  Plus -small for travel -battery driven -washable  Negatives -single foil takes hours to shave face.  Dont even get me talking about the neck.  Since I shave my head took almost two hours. -took ten to twenty passes to get even close to being presentable -battery driven; only last two times.  Went thru 6 AAs for five days.  Understandable as I shave my head, but six?  Did I mention that it is nice sized.  Really only positive in my review.  As I switched from the rotary shavers I used for twenty years to the foil year ago I was hoping for at least a presentable shave while on vacation.  Going to the electronic recycling/garage sale as I will find a better solution.</li>
    <li> I have a rather heavy beard and have tried many electric razors, most of which disappointed me. But the M90 does a pretty nice job, especially for an inexpensive battery-operated razor. I get a pretty good shave with no irritation. It&#x27;s not great on long hairs, especially at the neck line. But an extra pass or two does the trick. The razor is comfortable in the hand. On a recent two week vacation, two alkaline batteries lasted the whole trip and then some. Easy to clean, and the built-in brush is handy. I also like the flip open/close cover. BTW, I also tried using rechargeable batteries and they worked very well. though they have to be changed sooner than a pair fresh alkalines.</li>
    <li> About as expected - a decent touch-up shave.&lt;br /&gt;Pro&#x27;s: good protection for the foil; has trimmer&lt;br /&gt;Con&#x27;s: not the best choice for full shave w. heavy beard, but that should be expected; rather loud</li>
    <li> This great shaver has taken my husband through weeks of travel.  Especially great when in a foreigh country because all you do is take your own batteries.</li>
    <li> Men and shaving... A history of frustrating choices.&lt;br /&gt;  Exposed sharp edges (rocks, razors, blades, etc.) causing pain and bloodshed even in todays refined form led to the popularity of the convenient and gentle electric razor.  While equally effective for most users, electric razors are often expensive, and do wear out (the shield, the blade assembly sharpness, and the battery or motor mechanism).  In my life I&#x27;ve needed to travel internationally and domestically frequently and for a lengthy stay at times, so the convenience of the electric razor was offset by its bulk, its damage in travel, and its power/plug requirements.&lt;br /&gt;  Enter the smaller, lighter, shave-anywhere battery operated electric shaver! Found my first one while in Japan in the 80&#x27;s, discovered Braun also made one while in Germany a few years later; never used anything else from then on. Used these little gems for well over a decade before their wearing out prompted me to find Braun sold the model 370 here in the US... recently that model disappeared. Now here is the 370&#x27;s replacement in an improved design, the Model M90 (M60 without a trimmer). The M90 is more attractive, protects the battery compartment better, has a more effective positioning of the trimmer, and has a better designed shaving head screen than its Model 370 predecessor; the M90 and M60 are also designed to be washable for cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;  These lightweight, take-with-you shavers are powered by two standard AA cells of any sort. If you take 5 minutes to carefully shave, you will get at least two weeks of operation from most batteries.  I use 1300 mAH NiMH rechargeable AA cells, and that is my experience; good Alkaline AA&#x27;s or higher capacity NiMH AA&#x27;s will run another week longer.&lt;br /&gt;  The M90 is well protected for travel in your kit with its swing about cover. Batteries for it can be found everywhere.  It gives a good shave (mileage may vary for men with very heavy beards). It&#x27;s easily cleaned... What&#x27;s not to love?&lt;br /&gt;  And it&#x27;s economical - so when the shave head foil fails (I&#x27;ve worn out 3 model 370&#x27;s over the last 20 years) or the blade seems too dull, just be sure you have a backup replacement M90 stuffed away in your dresser drawer.  (Don&#x27;t bother hunting for a replacement shave head or blade assembly.)&lt;br /&gt;  So Why not buy one to keep in the car to freshen up?  Why not permanently have one in your toiletries travel kit if you&#x27;re a frequent traveler?  A mix of three M90&#x27;s and M60&#x27;s will cost less than one of the most popular cordless or even corded electric shavers... and the M90/M60 will in many cases last just as long if not longer, given equal treatment of the shave head... and replacing just the head assembly on an electric will cost more than a new M90 or M60!&lt;br /&gt;  Panasonic sell a similarly sized Model ES3831 wet/dry 2-AA cell powered mobile shaver. The Braun protects the shaving head better in travel with its swing cover versus the Panasonic&#x27;s plastic snap-on/off cover. The Braun M90 has a trimmer and attached cleaning brush. And the Braun (in my opinion) gives a closer shave.And it&#x27;s economical - so when the shave head foil fails (I&#x27;ve worn out 3 model 370&#x27;s over the last 20 years) or the blade seems too dull, just be sure you have a backup replacement M90 stuffed away in your dresser drawer.

    <li> This shaver is AWESOME! Ive had it about 6 months and it works great wet or dry. It makes a very close shave and works fantastic as long as you follow one rule, YOU HAIR MUST BE LESS THAN A QUARTER OF AN INCH FOR IT TO CUT. This shaver is great if you intend to use it every day, if you go 3 or even 2 days without shaving it has a hard time cutting hair because of the foil. If you use the shaver every day you will not have a problem. Also this shaver is great for those with sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I have lightweight, medium density whiskers, so I can&#x27;t attest to those with heavier beards.  I bought one of these mobile Brauns years ago and thought it worked as well as the more expensive Braun that had just died on me.  I would still be using it if I could find replacement cutter and foil that doesn&#x27;t cost what the M90 does now.  At that time the price online was $13 plus shipping.  The M90 price was double but still well worth it, compared to the insane prices Braun charges now for the high end units.  You get alot of shaves with the two AA batteries and I would invest in some quality rechargeables as you should get alot of use out of this shaver.  Letting whiskers get too long, some touch up with a blade was necessary for me, but regular morning shaves yielded excellent results.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been shaving with Braun products most of my adult life.  This is the first and only battery powered shaver I&#x27;ve encountered.  The Braun engineers have outdone themselves; the way they packed all that service into that little fellow is very ingenious.  It was so inexpensive I could justify the purchase just to satisfy my curiosity.  But I had an additional rationalization; to acquire the capability to shave without bloodshed during an extended power outage.&lt;br /&gt;  I put this shaver right to the test; I took it with me on a ten-day trip to California.  I shaved about every other day, at about ten minutes per shave.  It did the job just fine.  The paperwork says to expect about 60 minutes shaving time per two AA batteries. I shaved once more after I returned home; it seems the batteries have more shaves in them.  The next frontier is to see how it functions with rechargeable batteries.&lt;br /&gt;  Like its corded big brothers, it gave a really close shave without the slightest injury to my sensitive skin.  The screen seems a bit more delicate than those of its big brothers; so I took it easy but still made good progress with shaving.  This is an astonishingly effective and well designed shaver for less than $25.00.&lt;br /&gt;  Even if you don&#x27;t shave, I recommend you buy one just to admire the ingenious, compact design!  The only thing it lacks are booster rockets to put it into earth orbit, but I suppose that would be expecting too much of a couple of AA batteries.</li>
    <li> I bought this Braun as my primary shaver on foreign travels partly with confidence from several years good service from a full-size Braun. It saves about 50% in size and weight in your luggage. The shaver performed admirably during its recent overseas inaugural test with only two exceptions:  1) it doesn&#x27;t pick up longer, finer hair that grows around your neck, and 2) while it does get the job done, it takes about double the time for the same results as a full-size shaver. Still, the weight and space savings are worth these trade-offs and this is now my travel shaver for the ages. One unexpected bright spot was the battery life, despite the extended shaving events. I got over two weeks on the original Kirkland (Costco) batteries I installed before the trip. I also fee that the shaver was well-designed and solidly-constructed for its purpose and should last many years. For the money, it appears a durable, high-quality item for not much money. Maybe it should be 5-stars but, well, there&#x27;s those neck hairs . . .</li>
    <li> I travel every week and just tossed this shaver in my backpack.  The swiveling cover is awesome since it isn&#x27;t a cover that can easily fall off in my bag.  The batteries have lasted for at least 10 shaves.  I&#x27;m not the hairiest guy by any means but I do get the little dirty &#x27;stache if I don&#x27;t shave every day.  It&#x27;s not like this thing is $50 or even $100.  I actually like it as much or maybe even slightly better than my $200+ Norelco that I use at home.</li>
    <li> I have owned a Braun Shaver for MANY years.  I have one in my car, one in my office and one at home.  Great shaver at a great price...</li>
    <li> Very close shave and comfortable to use. It feels just the right weight when held in the hand, and the size of it is perfect. The only problem for me is that its quite loud. However I have not used any other electric shavers before to make a comparrison.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall excellent performance</li>
    <li> Easy to use and meets all aspects if it&#x27;s listing description!</li>
    <li> Great travel shaver Keep it in the desk for when you forget to shave. Works well on stubble, does not work so well on longer hair because it feels like it starts pulling your chin off. But with short stubble works great</li>
    <li> not bad. much better than old model. the trim is a plus. The foil screen broke today life time Sep 2014- Mar 2016</li>
    <li> Nice and light doesn&#x27;t shave closely. Takes many passes.</li>
    <li> It is cheap but it works. Just the product I wanted... not so fancy because I always replace my electric shaver and this one works to my expectation.</li>
    <li> This has become my default travel shaver.  Anything Braun will be well made.  This is no exception!</li>
    <li> This little unit exceeded my expectations.  I&#x27;m a 5o&#x27;clock shadow guy, so I have always kept a razor in my car to prepare for those evening meetings. I&#x27;ve used a full size Braun for many years, and prior to that a Norelco.  I&#x27;ve always preferred the Braun, but both are bulky to put into a briefcase.  When I saw this little guy I thought, for the price it&#x27;s worth a try and I am amazed!  It does everything the Big Braun does, just not quite as fast.  Good close shave - you just have to take a little more time.  And the batteries seem to last a long time - longer than a typical charge for the Big Braun.</li>
    <li> Good little shaver. Well worth the price. Feels solid and well made, even though it&#x27;s made in China. I wouldn&#x27;t use it as a daily shaver. It doesn&#x27;t shave close enough for me. I will be using it at work to clean up a little if I didn&#x27;t shave before leaving the house. I enjoy the closeness of a blade razor but hate the cuts and razor burn. That&#x27;s why I skip shaving for a couple of days sometimes. But now that I have this handy little M90, I can still look clean in between blade shaves.</li>
    <li> I generally use a DE razor but this is great for touch ups and when on the road.  I&#x27;m not crazy about electric shavers but this is about as good as a 20 buck one gets.</li>
    <li> This is a very good travel shaver. It works very well and gives a smooth shave.  I, however, would not recommend this for long-term travel.  I took it with me for a four day trip and it worked very well.  I would not take it if were to travel for longer than week.</li>
    <li> Was super excited about this product. Bought one two months ago. Great price, pretty great shave. At first. Soon I discovered that if my beard grows out for 1.5+ days it can&#x27;t handle the length of the whiskers. At this point I would&#x27;ve given it 3.5-4 stars. Then the deal breaker happened that prompted me to write this review. The foil cover broke on the side mid-shave, and began to cut my neck. I have taken very good care of the shaver and haven&#x27;t dropped it. The foil cover is thin and flimsy, and broke after 2 months. Worse yet, a replacement foil is $16 (I paid $22 for the Shaver!). Forget it! This thing is going in the trash!</li>
    <li> Easy to clean and very convenient with regular batteries. Does not shave very close. Here are some more more words.</li>
    <li> I am so happy I made this choice. The mobile shaver works so perfect.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this shaver.&lt;br /&gt;I have a fairly medium beard but the&lt;br /&gt;blades on this product, were useless.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this shaver for several weeks now, not daily as my main shave, but as a touch-up and keep-up device. Used as I do it does a decent job, not blade close but I didn&#x27;t expect it to be. It&#x27;s not as sturdy feeling and doesn&#x27;t get as close as the single battery pocket model I bought in Germany 25 years ago, but, nothing&#x27;s like it used to be I guess. My only real complaint is with the slide out trimmer; the cutter end is curved where I would prefer it straight. Still works well, just harder to get my moustache even with it. All-in-all a pretty decent shaver and I&#x27;m still on the first set of batteries.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using BRAUN shavers for over 25 years now and never had a complaint. I bought this one for traveling because I don&#x27;t want to carry my BRAUN Series 7 around in my luggage due to its size. Long story short: I&#x27;ve been using it now for a total of 3 months, 3 times a week and this week the foil cracked at two places, resulting in me having to attend a client meeting unshaven. Absolutely ridiculous - BRAUN&#x27;s name should not be on tihs terrible product.</li>
    <li> I have been shaving with this machine for the last few months. And it&#x27;s going well. I strongly recommend buying this product.</li>
    <li> Great shave...long lasting batteries and really is small to allow for easy travel. Highly recommended and long lasting. I use rechargeable batteries which greatly enhances the product.</li>
    <li> This is a great little product. I&#x27;ve used these multiple times throughout the years, starting with when I was in the military. I used it almost everyday when I was deployed overseas and every time we went to do training in the field. It is very durable and reliable. It&#x27;s also very easy to clean and it works very well... All in all this is a great product. I HIGHLY recommend this.</li>
    <li> It was a gift for my nephew. He is young, new to shaving, doesn&#x27;t shave daily.&lt;br /&gt;He seemed pleased with it. He is young, new to shaving, doesn&#x27;t shave daily.</li>
    <li> The shaver section works well enough; given the price range, the shaver is very good and I would take this shaver over my good one on any trip of less than a couple of weeks.  This one (the M90) and it&#x27;s cheaper, no-trimmer little brother (the M60) both do a good job on my face, including a mix of gray and thick black hair.  It doesn&#x27;t pull at all, and cleanup is easy.  My expensive shaver is faster, but not twice as fast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The flip-around blade guard is great - you close the razor up and KNOW it will not get turned on in your luggage.  The power source is two common AA batteries (available anywhere in civilization) and they last for months.  When I&#x27;m waiting on parts to fix my expensive shaver (or it&#x27;s charging) this shaver or the M60 is the shaver I use (I have both the M90 and the M60).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s a self-stowed cleaning brush and you can rinse the heads under water to clean them (i.e. \\&quot;washable\\&quot;).  I haven&#x27;t tried shaving in the shower with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only disappointment is the slide-out trimmer.  Its very slow and not very precise; I&#x27;d consider it as an \\&quot;emergency backup\\&quot; system only, but it adds a couple bucks cost, no volume and almost no weight compared to the trimmer-less M60, so it&#x27;s really&lt;br /&gt;a matter of preference - if you don&#x27;t have a beard/mustache/sideburns then go with the M60, otherwise get the M90.</li>
    <li> I recently bought 2 more of these wonderful devices, because my younger brother and cousin are coming of age where they are needing to shave on a daily basis. They are great on the go or whenever you need to give yourself a good shape-up. The foil it very easy on your skin, and allows for a VERY close shave. The side trimmer is a bit lacking in power, but it still gets the job done. I wouldn&#x27;t buy anything else at this point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cleaning it is a breeze. Take the foil top off, and use the small brush that comes with it on the bottom of the unit and use that to clean out the gunk between the coils. Smack it a few times and then if you want, run it under some water to give it a good clean. I tend to use a q-tip and wipe it up with some alcohol (which doesn&#x27;t corrode the screws inside as much as water). You can also rinse it off with some vinegar, but alcohol works fine (to avoid bad odor).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have owned mine for over 4 years, almost 5 and still going strong. I use it just about every day and keep it in my car. Just change the batteries whenever you need to. I have bought other wet/dry shavers and always came back to this one. About a year ago, I bought a Norelco that cost me $75 and I don&#x27;t even use it anymore. I prefer this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This shaver is ultra portable. There have been days that I had to do business on the run, and I didn&#x27;t have time to shave. I put it in my pocket and shave on the way up to see someone in their office. It&#x27;s so compact that it fits into almost any normal-sized pocket.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this shaver for anyone that is sick and tired of having other shavers that are too hard, or didn&#x27;t get the coarse hair, or didn&#x27;t get hair that was too soft. It&#x27;s a great shaver and very useful in multiple situations.</li>
    <li> This product is really not as good as the big Braun that I have but for travel it is really easy and does the job.  It covers up well and seems to be well built.</li>
    <li> Works well as a basic shaver. No problems with basic use for shaving.Small trimmer useful.Bought it for my husband&#x27;s use  while he was hospitalized and unable to use his regular razor.</li>
    <li> This a great ítem, cheap and nice so i buy twice and the first was four years ago so i do it again now!!!!</li>
    <li> I already bought onem90 shaver,but I can find a replacement foil, that why I order another one, can I get a replacement foil for this product?</li>
    <li> Small size, inexpensive, great design, batteries easy to replace, adequate shaving ability: what&#x27;s not to like?  I use it for touch up shaves between shaving with a blade.  It&#x27;s perfect.  Fits easily in my toilet kit for travel.  I would buy this again and recommend it to others.  Probably not useful for everyday shaving; it&#x27;s not designed for that.</li>
    <li> i tell u the truthhhhhh the side shaver work goooddddddddddd the front piece a shitttttttttt but its ok for 20 dolllrrr</li>
    <li> excellent results from a quick shave</li>
    <li> Good Shaver to use after the regular shave!&lt;br /&gt;I use it Every Day to be Well Shaved after I use MY match 3</li>
    <li> can&#x27;t believe all the power in this shaver... went to Ireland with us for a week, we did not have to try to recharge and it was still going strong.. great product... thanks</li>
    <li> Bought this for travel and it has performed very well. Almost as close a shave as my &amp;#34;big&amp;#34; Braun at home.</li>
