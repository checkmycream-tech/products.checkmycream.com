      <li>My skin does look noticeably brighter and more even toned.  </li>

      <li>It smells OK.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s just okay.</li>
      <li>You&#x27;ll find that the texture/viscosity is more liquid - so make sure you shake the container well before each use because you may experience some in consistency if you don&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I am sure over time this can even out skin tone and perhaps brighten skin tone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>My wife and picked this up to give a try and we&#x27;re pleased with the results.  </li>
      <li>I love this toner.  </li>
      <li>This is good, I&#x27;m a male but one who is into taking good care of my skin.  </li>
      <li>The tonic has a really nice fresh scent which is an added bonus.  </li>
      <li>this being said, the Refining Tonic feels nice upon application, is pleasant smelling, and sports a solid texture.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this!</li>
      <li>/&gt;The tonic is refreshing, and leaves my skin feeling clean, with no residue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s an overall great way to maintain healthy looking skin -</li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall, I don&#x27;t feel particularly strongly about the product.</li>
      <li>it is strong for me and burn my fact</li>
      <li>I like Burt&#x27;s Bees products and while they cost a bit more than other products, they are usually very good quality and work well.</li>
      <li>It has a mild citrus scent, which I found much more pleasant than the scents used in many similar products.&lt;br</li>
      <li>/&gt;This feels like a gentle cleansing tonic that isn&#x27;t too strong with a nice citrus scent.</li>
      <li>It has a light, pleasing smell to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>My face is left looking not too great.</li>
      <li>skin has never felt oily after use - and it feels smooth after wiping off the tonic.</li>
      <li>Part of the allure of the Burt&#x27;s Bees product line is the peace of mind to be free of excess ingredients.</li>
      <li>When this became available to me, I literally jumped at the chance to order it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This is a good sensitive skin toner, not drying and because there is no additional perfumes added a lower chance for allergic reactions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>and you&#x27;ll see results the first time you use it - because this refining tonic does such a good job clarifying your skin!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m really familiar with this product</li>
      <li>so I was excited to try this toner/tonic out.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I have not noticed any brightening, however, it does clean my face thoroughly without over drying.  </li>
      <li>After using, my face feels clean and not stripped.</li>
      <li>It does not feel invigorating and does not seem to clean (or stimulate) skin as well as Sea Breeze.  </li>
      <li>After a couple of days, I told her she looked even more beautiful than usual.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not really crazy about strong perfumed smells.</li>
      <li>After a few weeks, the change is even more remarkable.</li>
      <li>This product is a mild astringent that works well to clean my face.</li>
      <li>As a regular toner it&#x27;s good but the scent is not that desirable.</li>
      <li>They are probably fine if you have oily, resistant skin, but for more sensitive types, you&#x27;ll probably find this to be a bit too</li>
      <li>I have used Burt&#x27;s Bees products in the past and always with very good results.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall I am very pleased with this facial toner/tonic.  </li>
      <li>This toner is mostly botanical extracts heavy on the daisy, which the bottle warns many not be a good natural scent for everyone, but I found it unoffensive and alcohol.</li>
      <li>I have always enjoyed using Burt’s Bees products as I have very sensitive skin.  </li>
      <li>Great product, I have very sensitive skin and this as well as the BB&#x27;s wipes are the ONLY products that keep me breaking out.</li>
      <li>Bees Brightening Tonic makes my skin feel invigorated and fresh.  </li>
      <li>Thus, for those with non-temperamental skin, it may be worth giving Burt&#x27;s Bees offering a shot.</li>
      <li>it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can also put it onto a makeup pad and wipe your face with it - think acne pads, that same kind of motion and process all over your face and your neck.</li>
      <li>However I am able to clean very close to my eyes without them burning (I have used some toners/makeup removers that make my eyes burn even if I am not using it near my eyes).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I love the fact that this product does not contain many of the impurities that are found in other cosmetics/toiletries.  </li>
      <li>All around, my skin tone is more even, not so many dark spots.</li>
      <li>After using the product a few times, I noticed that my skin was remarkably softer and healthier.  </li>
      <li>I would definitely recommend to those with sensitive skin who are looking for a good toner and/or makeup remover.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>My wife and daughter both used it and liked it almost as much as their standard: Alba Hawaiian.  </li>
      <li>This has a pleasant scent and doesn&#x27;t feel harsh going on skin.</li>
      <li>The arrived very fast also</li>
      <li>Very gentle -</li>
      <li>I rate this one very highly!</li>
      <li>Overall this is helping my skin look nice with no unpleasant side effects even with my rosacea-prone sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t use a lot of facial products, but this is replacing a more chemically toner.</li>
      <li>fragrance gets you first</li>
      <li>It leaves my skin feeling baby soft and smooth - soothes any redness and sleep creases -</li>
      <li>That&#x27;s the first way to use</li>
      <li>although for me it&#x27;s more about regular blemish management than needing to look like I&#x27;m glowing ;</li>
      <li>This way you can target spots that might need more attention - especially if you have a need to wear makeup for any reason.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>/&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- Tingling/burning sensation when first applied to skin</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t tell yet if it&#x27;s brightening exactly though I noticed that even after washing my makeup off with soap and water and a wash cloth, when I look at the cotton pad after running it over my face, there is some color on it</li>
      <li>I can say that this is a excellent cleanser if you like the scent.is derived from natural ingredients and may vary.&amp;#34; I had to review this before four weeks and without the other product, so I can&#x27;t state whether this actually occurs.</li>
      <li>Right now I use straight witch hazel as a toner but it can be a bit drying at times</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I love this toner.  I purchased a bottle a year ago and never really noticed any difference.  Then, when I ran out, I bought a brightening toner from another brand, and THEN I realized how much this Burt&#x27;s Bees toner was doing for me.  It really helps even out my skin tone and it isn&#x27;t drying at all.  I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this!</li>
    <li> Leaves the skin feeling great, not drying.</li>
    <li> Smells a bit weird but the toner feels like its brightening up my face.</li>
    <li> Great product, I have very sensitive skin and this as well as the BB&#x27;s wipes are the ONLY products that keep me breaking out. The arrived very fast also</li>
    <li> do not like the smell, but it seems like natural</li>
    <li> I really believe this product works. I&#x27;m using it with the brightening even-tone moisturizing cream, eye cream.  I brought it because my skin was looking so &#x27;dull&#x27;.  I have been very pleased with the results and will continue to use it!</li>
    <li> Great product! Gave it as gifts to family members and they love it.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t believe I&#x27;ve used a toner on my face since probably high school because at that time, toners burned, took my breath away and made my eyes water so I quit trying to use them, even witch hazel is a bit much for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This tonic is NOT like the toner&#x27;s I tried in the past. No burning, no watery eyes just a pleasant lemony sort of scent with a cooling sensation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used this for 4 days in the evenings after I remove my makeup. After using my face feels soft, not tight. I can&#x27;t tell yet if it&#x27;s brightening exactly though I noticed that even after washing my makeup off with soap and water and a wash cloth, when I look at the cotton pad after running it over my face, there is some color on it like it&#x27;s getting my face even cleaner than soap and water does so I think that will eventually brighten my complexion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had no idea that a toner could clean/refresh/brighten and not burn or stink like alcohol. I really like this stuff and am definitely adding it to my beauty routine. I have oily skin and this cleans without stripping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you to Amazon and the Maker/Vendor for letting me give it a try.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been satisfied with other Burt&#x27;s Bees products I have tried in the past so I was happy to give this &amp;#34;tonic&amp;#34; a try.  It is basically a good astringent style cleanser and I am guessing that  getting your face clean of all makeup and other products  provides a lot of the touted brightening effect.  It reminded me in both results and the feel on my skin as what I get from  using witch hazel with the addition of a pleasantly flowery scent.  Since in middle age I have developed adult acne/rosacea  I tend to judge all skin products in regards to whether they cause flares and thankfully this product does not.  I&#x27;ve been using it for the last few days in the morning and in the evening and my skin looks healthy and blemish free.  Supposedly it takes four weeks to see the total brightening effect and I&#x27;ll update this review if I see any major changes in that time period.</li>
    <li> Now that I&#x27;ve hit the 30 year mark, I&#x27;ve been trying a lot of different face products.  I have gotten a few really expensive things and not seen any difference, but I can really see a difference with this one.  My skin does look noticeably brighter and more even toned.  I&#x27;ve only been using it about 2 weeks, but I like what I&#x27;m seeing so far!  I like the smell and I already like the Burt&#x27;s Bees line, so it&#x27;s a win win for me!</li>
    <li> I like Burt&#x27;s Bees products but this is just ok for me. It does removes residual dirt and makeup left behind pretty wel but I haven&#x27;t noticed any brightening or more even skin tone. As a regular toner it&#x27;s good but the scent is not that desirable. The yellow color is a little bit of a turn off too. But it does its job and yes my skin does feel cleaner after using it.</li>
    <li> I was anxious to try Burt&#x27;s Bees Brightening Refining Tonic since I like Burt&#x27;s Bees brand chap stick and hand lotion. I was disappointed in this tonic.  It does not feel invigorating and does not seem to clean (or stimulate) skin as well as Sea Breeze.  Further, Burt&#x27;s Bees Refining Tonic has a slightly unpleasant odor.  Initially it smells citrusy, like oranges, with slightly floral overtones, but afterwards the odor that lingers is somewhat unpleasant and a bit strong.  You may find it to your liking, but it is not a product that I will buy in the future.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t normally use a tonic but I like the matching eye cream so well I thought I would give this a try too. My skin gets dirty and greasy during the day, especially when I have been using sunblock during the day, but I don&#x27;t want to was my face too much since that dries my skin out horribly. Other tonics or facial wipes I have used sometimes dry my skin, or even worse leave it red and pebbly. This one cleans dirt and oil without either of these problems. I do have a dark spot from pregnancy at my hairline which I am hoping will fade as I continue to use the toner. Overall this is helping my skin look nice with no unpleasant side effects even with my rosacea-prone sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> Wonder toner - I use this every evening and morning and it refreshes and helps to prepare my skin for other necessary products.  It leaves my skin feeling baby soft and smooth - soothes any redness and sleep creases - I love it!</li>
    <li> I usually like Burt&#x27;s Bees products and find that they work well on my sensitive skin, but this toner is just too harsh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before ordering it from the Vine program, I didn&#x27;t take a look at the ingredients list (which is posted in the product description area), and it contains several ingredients that are problematic for sensitive skin.  The peppermint extract and citrus oils seem to be the culprits that made my skin turn red and peel a bit. They are probably fine if you have oily, resistant skin, but for more sensitive types, you&#x27;ll probably find this to be a bit too drying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pluses are that it&#x27;s very effective at removing the last bits of makeup that your cleanser might have left behind, and it has a nice, mild scent to it. If it were more soothing, I&#x27;d really like it, but it just aggravated my skin too much, so you may want to order a different product if you have sensitive skin. (I&#x27;ve been using a Paula&#x27;s Choice toner for a couple of years that works really well and doesn&#x27;t cause any redness, flaking, or dryness.)</li>
    <li> The Burt&#x27;s Bees refining tonic does a good job of removing dirt and oil from my skin. It has a pleasant, mild citric scent. It goes on the skin gently without the drying sensation of alcohol or feeling dry and tight afterwards. After a thorough cleansing, I moistened a cotton pad with the tonic and applied it to face, and could see traces of dirt on it (although it&#x27;s hard to see because of the yellowish color of the tonic derived from its natural ingredients). So, the tonic did remove dirt that my regular cleansing routine apparently still left behind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tonic is 98.9% natural. The ingredients consist of a long list of botanical extracts, with daisy extract being the main focus, and some typical chemicals. It says it helps visibly even skin tone in as little as 4 weeks when used as part of a regimen with other Burt&#x27;s Bees skin products. I haven&#x27;t noticed that yet though. For cleansing purposes, the tonic is quite effective. Good product.</li>
    <li> Burt&#x27;s Bees Brightening Refining Tonic cleans the dirt and oil from your skin effectively. I use it on my face and neck and just apply a little to a cotton ball. I give this product 4/5 stars.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not really sure what the &amp;#34;Burt&#x27;s Bees Brightening Refining Tonic&amp;#34; is supposed to do, but it seems to be a very mild astringent. It is refreshing to apply to the skin in the evening, and my wife indicates that it is effective at removing some remaining traces of makeup or other cosmetics after they are removed by washing or other methods. The tonic does not leave the skin feeling dried-out.</li>
    <li> My wife and picked this up to give a try and we&#x27;re pleased with the results.  It easily cleans your face and skin without any stinging or burning associated with other facial products.  It has a light, pleasing smell to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We&#x27;ll definitely be using this again once this bottle runs out.</li>
    <li> After using Burt&#x27;s Bees Brightening Refining Tonic for three days, here are my observations:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. I don&#x27;t like the scent. It&#x27;s fruity and outdoorsy in scent, and I don&#x27;t like that smell on my face. That&#x27;s just a personal preference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. It cleans very well. It deep cleans and actually removed old makeup and dirt that my other cleanser left behind. I was impressed with that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. Although the name suggests that this is a totally organic, natural product, this is not the case. It has natural ingredients, true; but there are quite a few chemicals as well. Here is the complete list of ingredients: Ingredients: aqua (water, eau), aloe barbadensis leaf juice, glycerin, bellis perennis (daisy) flower extract, malva sylvestris (mallow) leaf extract, mentha piperita (peppermint) leaf extract, primula veris extract, veronica officinalis extract, melissa officinalis leaf extract, achillea millefolium extract, vaccinium myrtillus fruit extract, citrus medica limonum (lemon) fruit extract, citrus aurantium dulcis (orange) fruit extract, saccharum officinarum (sugar cane, extrait de canne &amp;aacute; sucre) extract, acer saccharum (sugar maple) extract, quillaja saponaria bark extract, alchemilla vulgaris extract, salix nigra (willow) bark extract, aloe barbadensis leaf extract, caprylyl/capryl wheat bran/straw glycosides, fusel wheat bran/straw glycosides, maltodextrin, arginine, alcohol denat., alcohol, phenethyl alcohol, parfum (fragrance)*, polyglyceryl-5 oleate, sodium cocoyl glutamate, glyceryl caprylate, sodium benzoate, potassium sorbate, phenoxyethanol, citral, geraniol, limonene, linalool *natural fragrance&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. Does it do what it says? The website says that this product will brighten and even out your complexion in as few as four weeks, however, it also adds that it must be, &amp;#34; used as part of a regimen with Brightening Facial Cleanser, Refining Tonic, Eye Treatment, Dark Spot Corrector and Even-Tone Moisturizing Cream. Product’s color is derived from natural ingredients and may vary.&amp;#34; I had to review this before four weeks and without the other product, so I can&#x27;t state whether this actually occurs. The list price of this regimen is $82 for all five products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: If you like Burt&#x27;s Bees and want to spend the money to buy the complete line of products that are required to &amp;#34;brighten and even out your complexion,&amp;#34; this may or may not work. Someone else will have to attest to that. Personally, I wouldn&#x27;t want to have to spend the $82 that is required to do this. I can say that this is a excellent cleanser if you like the scent.is derived from natural ingredients and may vary.&amp;#34; I had to review this before four weeks and without the other product, so I can&#x27;t state whether this actually occurs.

    <li> This is good, I&#x27;m a male but one who is into taking good care of my skin.  I&#x27;m not into cotton pad uses as the advised directions, however I use after cleanser.  I would as the label suggest using this Brightening Refining Tonic in conjunction with BB other products such as facial cleanser, eye treatment, and moisturizing cream.</li>
    <li> 98.9% natural. This toner is mostly botanical extracts heavy on the daisy, which the bottle warns many not be a good natural scent for everyone, but I found it unoffensive and alcohol. This is a good sensitive skin toner, not drying and because there is no additional perfumes added a lower chance for allergic reactions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only caveat, I would like some Witch Hazel in there.</li>
    <li> Part of the allure of the Burt&#x27;s Bees product line is the peace of mind to be free of excess ingredients. For those with sensitive skin, this is an arguable must. Unfortunately, the Brightening Refining Tonic falls short in this area, with literally dozens of chemicals...and plenty of them alcohol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With this being said, the Refining Tonic feels nice upon application, is pleasant smelling, and sports a solid texture. Still, the commitment to alcohol - perhaps needed to properly remove makeup - dries out while doing so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Being pragmatic, however, it&#x27;s nearly impossible to find a good toner at this price. Ahava&#x27;s stellar product clocks in at nearly 3x the price...and the comparable Jason&#x27;s likewise sports additional chemicals. Thus, for those with non-temperamental skin, it may be worth giving Burt&#x27;s Bees offering a shot.</li>
    <li> I have erratically used cleansers and moisturizers in the past, but I&#x27;ve only rarely used toners. So no comparative value here. What I can tell you is that the Burt&#x27;s Bees Refining Tonic leaves the skin feeling fresh and only mildly astringent. I have a beard, and the whole routine of cleanser, toner, and moisturizer left my whiskers feeling soft and supple.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Burt&#x27;s Bees Tonic has a distinctive odor. I find it pleasant but my wife compared to a daisy, and not positively.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other note about the Burt&#x27;s Bees Tonic is that it is light on the alcohol and didn&#x27;t leave my face feeling dried out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I don&#x27;t feel particularly strongly about the product. It did not convert me to a routine of cleansing, toning and moisturizing. I&#x27;ll probably just stick to splashing water on my face from time to time. But, neither was it at all offensive or off-putting to me.</li>
    <li> I gave this product to my wife to try. After a couple of days, I told her she looked even more beautiful than usual. She said this product makes husbands blind. Then I asked her if she&#x27;s happier. She said, &amp;#34;I&#x27;m not happier, I just have less to complain about.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m giving it five stars.</li>
    <li> Very gentle - and you&#x27;ll see results the first time you use it - because this refining tonic does such a good job clarifying your skin! After a few weeks, the change is even more remarkable.</li>
    <li> I love it and will be purchasing more!</li>
    <li> I have always enjoyed using Burt’s Bees products as I have very sensitive skin.  Many facial products irritate my skin and cause my face to turn red or cause a rash on my face.  Therefore, I am always a little hesitant before trying a new product.  However, this product did not aggravate my skin at all and the tonic never dried my skin out.  I used this product specifically to remove makeup at the end of the day.  However, I could envision using the product as a toner before applying moisturizer at the beginning of the day.  After using the product a few times, I noticed that my skin was remarkably softer and healthier.  I have not noticed any brightening of the skin, but my skin tone does look more even. The tonic has a really nice fresh scent which is an added bonus.  I would recommend this product to someone looking for a dependable makeup remover.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a long-time fan of the Burt&#x27;s Bees products, and a regular user of the blemish stick, lip balm, and have also used the rescue ointment on camping trips. Every single product has lived up to expectations and the tonic is no different.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product isn&#x27;t a cream like some of the other facial products from BB&#x27;s. You&#x27;ll find that the texture/viscosity is more liquid - so make sure you shake the container well before each use because you may experience some in consistency if you don&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fragrance gets you first and it&#x27;s really pleasant. There&#x27;s a floral hint - and likely from the &amp;#34;daisy extract&amp;#34; - however, I don&#x27;t really know if it smells exactly like a daisy. The tonic goes on very easily. I generally use this after the shower after patting my face dry. It easily pours into your palm then rub it with your hands and get it all over your face, ears, neck, and don&#x27;t forget the back of your neck too. Then just wipe with a washcloth. That&#x27;s the first way to use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can also put it onto a makeup pad and wipe your face with it - think acne pads, that same kind of motion and process all over your face and your neck. This way you can target spots that might need more attention - especially if you have a need to wear makeup for any reason.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My skin has never felt oily after use - and it feels smooth after wiping off the tonic. You might want to pay attention to the fragrance if that&#x27;s not your thing - this is not an unscented product so just be aware.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this product on a regular basis along with the blemish stick, acne lotion/cream. It&#x27;s an overall great way to maintain healthy looking skin - although for me it&#x27;s more about regular blemish management than needing to look like I&#x27;m glowing ;-).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy this solid 4 star product from Burt&#x27;s Bees!</li>
    <li> it is strong for me and burn my fact</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t use a lot of facial products, but this is replacing a more chemically toner. Same fresh feeling and so far the same clarity of skin I&#x27;ve been experiencing. That said, minus one star for the overly pungent oder that&#x27;s simply not for me.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t usually use a toner, but I tried it and thought it was fine... My wife and daughter both used it and liked it almost as much as their standard: Alba Hawaiian.  Overall, I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s a viable option ... personal preference matters a lot.</li>
    <li> Eh, it&#x27;s okay.  Face feels sticky after use. Not drying and does not fight acne or clogged pores. Will be good for winter time use, but not summer.</li>
    <li> Great smell (NOT too strong, and I am picky about that kind of thing!) and leaves my skin feeling squeaky clean but not too dry. The color is slightly yellowish, so if you&#x27;re putting it on a cotton ball and hoping to see the last bits of makeup and gunk show up on that after, you&#x27;ll be a little bit disappointed because it&#x27;s hard to tell.</li>
    <li> I got this toner to review through the Amazon vine program.  Right now I use straight witch hazel as a toner but it can be a bit drying at times so I was excited to try this toner/tonic out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tonic has a refreshing citrus/lemon scent that I liked.  It&#x27;s a little bit thicker than straight witch haze and has a light yellow/orange color to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I put it on my face it makes it tingle/burn slightly, but that fades quickly.  It does sting some if you accidentally get it in your eyes (but then so does witch hazel).  However I am able to clean very close to my eyes without them burning (I have used some toners/makeup removers that make my eyes burn even if I am not using it near my eyes).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This tonic/toner does an excellent job at removing makeup and dirt.  I also like to use it as a toner when I get up in the morning and before I put my makeup on.  It does and excellent job at removing oil from my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have noticed some improvement in skin quality as well.  Not really any brightening, but just general better skin tone uniformity. This isn&#x27;t as drying as straight witch hazel and it doesn&#x27;t make my face breakout at all.  I have very sensitive skin that breaks out easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I am very pleased with this facial toner/tonic.  I would definitely recommend to those with sensitive skin who are looking for a good toner and/or makeup remover.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- Smells nice&lt;br /&gt;- Does a good job of removing makeup&lt;br /&gt;- Improves skin quality/not as drying as straight witch hazel&lt;br /&gt;- Doesn&#x27;t cause break-outs, works well on my sensitive skin&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- Tingling/burning sensation when first applied to skin&lt;br /&gt;- Stings eyes if you get it in your eyes.&lt;br /&gt;- Expensive for what it is, I can get witch hazel for $1.99</li>
    <li> My wife actually picked this up for me to brighten my skin after shaving. I&#x27;m really familiar with this product and I love it! It smells OK. I&#x27;m not really crazy about strong perfumed smells. This is just strong enough that it kinda wakes me up if I feel sluggish in the morning. I use this after I shave. After shaving, I have deep red blotches left on my skin. I have a very thick beard and it takes a while for me to shave, extra passes with the razor. My face is left looking not too great. This really gets rid of all the redness left behind from shaving. And it really has brightened the skin on my neck, my wife noticed before I did. It does sting, this does have alcohol in it. But that works for me too. If I nick myself this acts like an antiseptic. I even use this if I&#x27;m lazy and don&#x27;t want to wash my face when I get home from work.</li>
    <li> Burt&#x27;s Bees Tonic really helps to remove dirt and oil from your face. This has a pleasant scent and doesn&#x27;t feel harsh going on skin. This product has a lot of natural ingredients including Daisy extract, peppermint, Melissa, lemon and a lot more-though it does contain some alcohol it doesn&#x27;t dry out my face. After using, my face feels clean and not stripped. I am sure over time this can even out skin tone and perhaps brighten skin tone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This feels like a gentle cleansing tonic that isn&#x27;t too strong with a nice citrus scent. It really cleans off make up and your skin feels refreshed after use. A little goes a long way too so this 6 ounce bottle will last quite a while. I like Burt&#x27;s Bees products and while they cost a bit more than other products, they are usually very good quality and work well. I have sensitive skin and have no problems with this refining tonic.</li>
    <li> I have used Burt&#x27;s Bees products in the past and always with very good results.  When this became available to me, I literally jumped at the chance to order it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Burt&#x27;s Bees Brightening Tonic makes my skin feel invigorated and fresh.  I recommend that one uses a cotton ball to remove any residue of makeup for those who wear makeup.  You will be surprised at how much will come off that you thought you had initially washed off!  In the past, I have noticed skin brightening and I have no doubt that this product will deliver on that as well.  I love the fact that this product does not contain many of the impurities that are found in other cosmetics/toiletries.  Even so, it does contain alcohol which may account for the slight tingling sensation your skin will feel after an application.  I rate this one very highly!</li>
    <li> This product is a mild astringent that works well to clean my face. It has a mild citrus scent, which I found much more pleasant than the scents used in many similar products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tonic is refreshing, and leaves my skin feeling clean, with no residue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is recommended that you use this as part of a &amp;#34;system.&amp;#34; I am not a fan of buying multiple products and having a complicated regimen, however, I liked using this tonic after washing my face at night. It removed any makeup or dirt that washing didn&#x27;t get.</li>
    <li> I like this product and  joins a long line of products that tout the same claims.  I have not noticed any brightening, however, it does clean my face thoroughly without over drying.  One thing that I have noticed is a few pimples popping up.  It happens when I stray from the product  that I have been using for years. However, the smell is pleasant and it does a good job of removing traces of dirt and makeup.</li>
    <li> I bought the whole Brightening kit and it worked great!&lt;br /&gt;I have less acne, it has a nice natural scent, highly recommend these products.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this tonic for about a month now, and I&#x27;ve definitely noticed a difference in my skin tone. My face is brighter, my cheeks aren&#x27;t as red, and it seems to glow. All around, my skin tone is more even, not so many dark spots.</li>
    <li> I have dry, sensitive skin. While I LOVE the lemony-citrusy scent, no matter how little I put on my cotton pad, my skin felt sticky for hours. I noticed the sticky-ness more at night because I don&#x27;t use any creams after; didn&#x27;t notice the sticky feeling during the daytime when I put sunscreen over this. As far as brightening my skin, too soon to tell if there&#x27;s been any difference. Unless I see drastic changes, I probably won&#x27;t be buying this after the bottle is used up.</li>
    <li> It works.  It works.  IT WORKS!  Love this stuff, I use the entire line, the Wash, Tonic, and Facial Creme.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s just okay. It is not an impressive or disappointing product.</li>
    <li> I was excited when I got this product, but even after 5 weeks of use I did not see anybrightening of my skin, which is the only reason why I bought it, so that&#x27;s why I only gave it one star.</li>
