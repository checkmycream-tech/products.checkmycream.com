<li> This mask draws your face so tight that when it is dry you can barely open your mouth.  </li>
<li> a sensitive one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You must have an oily skin to use this Green clay mask, you should definitely have enlarged pore and excessive sebum secretion.</li>
<li> The only thing is that this product can be a little drying, person who is looking at the reviews, but mixing it with a bit of aloe or olive oil fixes that.</li>
<li> I use this product thrice/twice times a week,mix it with few drops of lemon or sometimes just mixed with tap water.</li>
<li> not extra drying either, after using the mask if you leave your skin the way it is, you will feel softness after a few hours and the dryness is temporary.</li>
<li> I mixed it with a little dead sea mud and Apple cider vinegar.</li>
<li> I am using it to treat a serious open wound.  </li>
<li> When it drys and you pop it off, it takes all the infectious bacteria with it and sometimes a little skin.  </li>
<li> I will be buying this green clay powder again.</li>
<li> I use this clay as a green colorant in my cp soap.</li>
<li> Packaging for the clay was not secure and the bag was covered in clay dust.</li>
<li> particulary ordered this green clay for easing my stiff shoulders.&lt;br /&gt;At</li>
<li> I am 22 years old and have used cleansers from expensive companies as well as creams and toners to refine my pores and reduce excessive oil but nothing worked!!!&lt;br /&gt;Now</li>
<li> least twice a week, after shower,  I applied it from my neck to shoulders and arms.&lt;br /&gt;Feel</li>

    <li> Great product and I even liked how the seller took extra steps to ensure product would arrive in one piece (no spillage). It takes a bit to get to the US but its well worth the wait, will keep buying from this seller. I am very happy.</li>
    <li> I use this clay as a green colorant in my cp soap. I also use it with goat&#x27;s milk as a mask on my face.</li>
    <li> Makes a wonderful face mask and takes such a small amount to mix into creamy mud with addition of your favorite liquid ingredient (s.)&lt;br /&gt;Takes a little time to arrive from Portugal but worth the wait.</li>

I make it in tap water and few drops of lemon and works fine for me and sometimes alone!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have never used masks like these so it met up my expectation and was delivered on time as I reside in Pakistan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So overall the best  experience shopping online!!!! :)</li>
    <li> Great stuff! Timely delivery and good quality.</li>
    <li> i got it in earlier than it was supposed to come in which was awesome but its not the same as the picture and since it is in a different language i cant tell if im actually putting green clay on my face</li>
    <li> A bit drying, but I like the product overall.  I think the &amp;#34;pulsing&amp;#34; is just the clay drying and thus, pulling at your skin. People.. don&#x27;t be so incredulous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;lol.. anyway.  Still a good product and a good value.</li>
    <li> Love this mask.  It took awhile to arrive but it was worth the wait.  This mask draws your face so tight that when it is dry you can barely open your mouth.  When it is washed off your skin is really so soft.  Love it!</li>
    <li> Very happy with this clay. Really nice. But keep in mind... it will take a looooong time to receive it.</li>
    <li> Nice and soft, good color, works great in facial masks. I&#x27;m really happy with the purchase, definitely worth the wait!</li>
    <li> I will be buying this green clay powder again. I am very happy with it and will continue to buy it as I need it. Have been using it for a wrap I read about. The price was fair and the powder is what I was expecting. The seller is very helpful and I am Happy.</li>
    <li> This is a good product, very fine in texture.  I am taking 1 star off because although it was packaged well, it took forever to receive....I&#x27;m talking weeks.</li>
    <li> This is the best stuff I&#x27;ve ever used. My skin was so very very soft after making an herbal facial mask.  My daughter felt my skin and immediately wanted me to do a mask for her as well and she was very happy with the result.  The clay is an extremely fine powder and easily mixed with water.  Great for oily skin!</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful product! You can use it to clean and tone your skin in total confidence. The seller delivered exactly as promissed, and quickly considering the distance.</li>
    <li> I love this. I took a while to arrive because it came from Spain. It works really well, and there are few instructions for use. Mix it with water, or almost anything else and slap it on your face or body. When dry, wash off.</li>
    <li> This is a very fine powder and it works very well! I highly recommend purchasing this. I also like the art work on the bag and I now have some Portuguese newspaper that the product was wrapped in, that I will keep for souvenir.</li>
    <li> I love this product!  I mix pure honey and green tea to make a paste and use it as a facial mask twice a week!</li>
    <li> Good service good product</li>
    <li> This is my first time to purchase this Illite Green Clay. I know I&#x27;m going to love it after reading all the reviews.</li>
    <li> Wonderful! I love this clay!!!</li>
    <li> By now I have had time to use this clay.  I am using it to treat a serious open wound.  It is healing rapidly as the clay draws blood to the area.  It seems to have a attraction to human flesh.  It sticks like glue.  It takes all the infection out of the wound within the first 24 hours.  When it drys and you pop it off, it takes all the infectious bacteria with it and sometimes a little skin.  You have to repeat the process about every 4-6 hours.  I will definitely be keeping this illite clay in my medicines.  I tried sodium montmorillonite clay but it didn&#x27;t work as well for infections but works really well for sucking out venom.  I was bitten by a brown recluse and it blew out a 7&amp;#34; hole in my side all the way to the muscle.&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t have the montmorillonite clay at the time to suck out the venom but have been bitten since then and it sucked out the poison in a couple minutes and stopped the decay of my flesh from my current wound.  I was using calcium montmorillonite to heal it but it got infected with flesh eating bacteria and it wouldn&#x27;t remove the bacteria and I started losing flesh again.  Now the illite has removed the bacteria and I am healing again.  It was worth the wait.</li>
    <li> Good product I bought this for a cellulite scrub</li>
    <li> This is a great product &amp; affordably priced for what it is. Works great as a powdered make-up base &amp; as a deep cleaning mask. About to try my hand at using it as a concealer with some tints &amp; glycerin.</li>
    <li> It took a while to get here (from Spain!) but was worth the wait! I made gift baskets for Christmas, with homemade beauty products, for the ladies in my family. Included was a face mask from this clay, they all said this was their favorite item. Very nice clay, I feel like it&#x27;s better quality than the pre-mixed masks you find at the drug store here.</li>
    <li> I love the natural way to smooth my skin.&lt;br /&gt;I particulary ordered this green clay for easing my stiff shoulders.&lt;br /&gt;At least twice a week, after shower,  I applied it from my neck to shoulders and arms.&lt;br /&gt;Feel great!</li>
    <li> This product is excellent! The first time I used it was, I was pleasantly surprised. My face felt like it just came out of a snowy alpine forest. My skin was quite refreshed. The next day it was bright and glowing as well as very clear. I have begun to use it once a week. The only thing is that this product can be a little drying, person who is looking at the reviews, but mixing it with a bit of aloe or olive oil fixes that. I would highly recommend this product to anyone who has a very oily face which they wish to remedy, but it works for other skin types as well.</li>
    <li> Watch how much water you add to the green clay. I over did it.</li>
    <li> This product is wonderful! It&#x27;s very nice fine clay helps clear your face really well. The seller seems to take great pride and care in his product and is very easy to contact. You&#x27;re also su</li>
    <li> I am extremely satisfied with the product itself.Packaging for the clay was not secure and the bag was covered in clay dust. It arrived within the delivery window as promised.</li>
    <li> Francisco I love the clay. I mixed it with a little dead sea mud and Apple cider vinegar. It works great for hair and face mask. Thank you so much and I Will be ordering more.</li>
    <li> Good purchase for the price!</li>
    <li> It is not a very large bag but it has so many uses and you don&#x27;t need much for any of it. It is awesome!</li>
