      <li>This silky powder has no talc and has a wonderful sexy fragrance.</li>
      <li>I also would love to use this to scent my sheets, but again, cocoa butter and cloth is not the greatest combo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

      <li>, I have had nonstop compliments on how good I smell.  </li>
      <li>the can has an expiration date on it, good for about 2 months.  </li>
      <li>and the wife kept asking me what in my bathroom smells so good.  </li>

      <li>Almost every reviewer says what a nice, pleasant smell this has..</li>
      <li>I love it!</li>
      <li>i love this powder!</li>
      <li>I love this scent!  </li>
      <li>I love this item!</li>
      <li>This dusting powder is amazing.</li>
      <li>This dusting powder smells great and leaves your skin silky smooth.  </li>
      <li>smell is nice</li>
      <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s extremely nice after a shower or bath.  </li>
      <li>(a popular one is polyacrylamide and it&#x27;s derivatives  ---</li>
      <li>/&gt;It isn&#x27;t drying, in fact on a warm day</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s kind of cocoa like, but not like your kids</li>
      <li>has a really nice, silky feel on the skin.</li>
      <li>best lush product ever is the Buffy.  </li>
      <li>There is a lid on top that turns to fully opened or sprinkles (kind of like a McCormick spice container).</li>
      <li>Perfect for Summertime, which is quite long in Florida, or just getting out of the shower, or anytime you want to feel pampered and sexy!</li>
      <li>Perhaps it doesn&#x27;t mix well with MY body chemistry, because the lovely scent changed on my skin.</li>
      <li>This product smells really nice and feels really lovely and smooth.</li>
      <li>i love the smell what do you do to use it in your laundry</li>
      <li>the cocoa butter is moisturizing and lovely.</li>
      <li>This is the most heavenly skin product I have ever used.  </li>
      <li>but it still could be made better.</li>
      <li>It smells great and is very silky in texture.</li>
      <li>This powder is sexy.  </li>
      <li>Makes warm months more comfortable.</li>
      <li>Any talc product is supposed to absorb moisture, and there are a lot of powders on the market that smell better than this.  </li>
      <li>Thought it would smell better than it did.  </li>
      <li>not any better than baby powder.</li>
      <li>Glad I bought 2.</li>
      <li>It smells absolutely lovely.</li>
      <li>this is a GREAT product, and I&#x27;m VERY picky, so I&#x27;ll bet you&#x27;ll love it.</li>
      <li>So don&#x27;t buy too many as you stock up</li>
      <li>you will LOVE the buffy :)</li>
      <li>I really love the scent of this -</li>
      <li>love to put it on and then wear satin pajamas.</li>
      <li>Interesting note:  </li>
      <li>also love a sprinkle inbetween my bedsheets whenever I change them to layer the fragance as well.</li>
      <li>This is a very nice dusting powder with a pleasant light smell, but having used other LUSH products and being extremely impressed with those, I guess I was expecting more.  </li>
      <li>Not too overpowering but a nice, sweet smell that lasts throughout the day.</li>
      <li>I put it on with a huge powderpuff after my lotion has settled, on top of my lotion...</li>
      <li>product is particularly nice in the summer or in warmer climates, as it absorbs small amounts of excess body oil (and has the added bonus of smelling great!).  </li>
      <li>The dusting powder leaves your skin very smooth and is deliciously cooling to use in the summer as sometimes lotion is too heavy while you&#x27;re all sweaty :) It&#x27;s also one of the softest dusting powders by LUSH and goes on your skin very nice and silky.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>But not to happy although it does feel soft on the skin.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve read a lot of reviews (on the LUSH site), saying how great of a product this is.  </li>
      <li>Fabulous, smells wonderful, soft and perfect, but container is really small.</li>
      <li>its lush lol.</li>
      <li>the scent is so good, and lingers well on the skin, so you will likely forgive the sins of the cocoa butter as I have, to enjoy this warm and sophisticated scent.</li>
      <li>When I first tried this product, I was in love!</li>
      <li>so I was looking for a good light powder that doesn&#x27;t cake and is silky light to help in the hot months here.  </li>
      <li>Also, it felt nice going on, but don&#x27;t expect much softness or moisture to come of this - which I thought I&#x27;d see more of because of the cocoa butter.  </li>
      <li>The scent isn&#x27;t so strong after you put it all over your body.  </li>
      <li>When I first purchased Silky Underwear after reading rave reviews, I wasn&#x27;t particularly impressed with the scent, but after a couple of days of using it, it totally grew on me!</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t had much of a problem with the packaging, and I love that they personalize your product with a sticker of the person who made it for you!  </li>
      <li>but I didn&#x27;t really find anything so spectacular about this powder.</li>
      <li>It has this light musty jasmine scent.</li>
      <li>Silky Underwear Dusting Powder is amazingly light</li>
      <li>I just use a light dusting of the powder and</li>
      <li>I now look forward to a light dusting of this powder before I dress in the morning.</li>
      <li>The scent reminds me of the cheap, weird-smelling baby wipes my mother used to buy for my nephews.</li>
      <li>Maybe if there&#x27;s another scent available, I&#x27;d try that.</li>
      <li>However, I appreciate the light scent -</li>
      <li>We try to use brands like Lush, that use natural products...and I especially love the fact that this has no talc.  </li>
      <li>I love using this right out of the shower.  </li>
      <li>When I first received this product, I wasn&#x27;t sure about it.  </li>
      <li>It works so wonderfully in my morning routine, although heavily rushed!  </li>
      <li>it is not made of heavier talcum like many dusting powders, but is much finer and softer, and it has moisturizing particles that leave the skin smooth and lightly scented with a hint of jasmine.   </li>
      <li>It has this very clean smell that really is FEMME!  </li>
      <li>i guess its just cool cause</li>
      <li>fun to put on, and great to wear all day long!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s silky smooth on my skin and contains the smallest bits or cocoa butter that blend right in like silk.</li>
      <li>For the amount of money you spend on Lush products, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s too much to ask for good product packaging.</li>
      <li>That was such a nice touch, as was the free sample soap.</li>
      <li>smells better than normal baby powder.  </li>
      <li>Imagine my surprise when, after getting dressed and heading off to work, I realized that the sweet smell had changed to a much warmer, lush, sexy smell!  </li>
      <li>Normally I love lush products, but this powder is really too fine and just dusts everything instead of your body.  </li>
      <li>I *love* the scent of this powder, and I use it a few times a week for that amazing scent - floral but richer and deeper, not cloying or old-ladyish.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I ordered this powder because I live in a very hot climate and the summers are intolerably hot so I was looking for a good light powder that doesn&#x27;t cake and is silky light to help in the hot months here.  Well, look no longer!  Silky Underwear Dusting Powder is amazingly light and I just can&#x27;t get enough of the scent!  It smells so warm and sweet but not at all heavy.  I can smell the powder after wearing it all day long, it&#x27;s light enough you keep trying to capture a whiff of yourself...  I plan to buy more when my can is empty.  Interesting note:  the can has an expiration date on it, good for about 2 months.  So don&#x27;t buy too many as you stock up, they might go bad before you&#x27;ve used them all.       5 stars!</li>
    <li> I LOVE Lush, but was not totally in love with the smell of this product.  Thought it would smell better than it did.  It does what it&#x27;s supposed to and gets my skin very soft, but I&#x27;m not wild about the scent.      I still love Lush and their other products though &#x3D;]</li>
    <li> This powder has a lovely scent- soft jasmine with a hint of vanilla.  There are little bits of cocoa butter in the powder, which help moisturize your skin.  The texture is not as soft as other Lush dusting powders, it has a slightly gritty feel to it, which is why I left off one star.  It does eventually sink in and leave your skin soft and nicely scented, I like to put it on at night before I hop into bed, and I smell yummy even the next day!</li>
    <li> This dusting powder wasn&#x27;t everything I expected it to be. It smelled rather \\&quot;grandmotherish\\&quot;. But after using it a few times the scent is growing on me and I&#x27;m using it more. I&#x27;m actually starting to like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:  I have been using this for a while now and I have had SUCH a change of heart!  I love this scent!  I just recently bought the All That Jasmine bath bomb which has the same Jasmine scent and it left my bathroom smelling delicious for days!  I had company visit me for a week and the wife kept asking me what in my bathroom smells so good.  She kept saying she could spend all of her time in there and wants her bathroom to smell like that.  It really does smell so good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Silky Underwear after the All That Jasmine bath bomb will leave you smelling great for hours.  I only wish LUSH made a body cream or lotion in this scent.</li>
    <li> i love the smell what do you do to use it in your laundry i dont get it?also i want to use it after shower is it instead of moisturiser do you get dry first or put it on wet skin like baby oil.i know i sound stupid sorry x</li>
    <li> Like many other reviewers of this product I do not routinely use body powder.  However, Silky Underwear is not your average powder or your average beauty product...it is not made of heavier talcum like many dusting powders, but is much finer and softer, and it has moisturizing particles that leave the skin smooth and lightly scented with a hint of jasmine.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;This product is particularly nice in the summer or in warmer climates, as it absorbs small amounts of excess body oil (and has the added bonus of smelling great!).  My only warning/complaint is that the container is prone to spills, and is best left on a level, stationary surface such as a bathroom countertop.  I eventually got sick of the packaging and began applying it with my own puff, which does the job much more effectively. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Another interesting product from LUSH...fun to put on, and great to wear all day long!</li>
    <li> I bought this product based on the reviews here, and I am extremely happy to say that I was not misled.  This dusting powder is amazing. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve never used a dusting powder before, so I didn&#x27;t realize how silky it could make your skin feel.  I haven&#x27;t had much of a problem with the packaging, and I love that they personalize your product with a sticker of the person who made it for you!  That was such a nice touch, as was the free sample soap. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;When I first opened the powder, I thought it smelled a little sweet and maybe cloying, but I dusted some on and my skin felt silky soft.  It didn&#x27;t make a mess or even feel gritty, which I would have expected out of a talc.  It still smelled a little sweet, but I didn&#x27;t really think about it.  Imagine my surprise when, after getting dressed and heading off to work, I realized that the sweet smell had changed to a much warmer, lush, sexy smell!  Other drivers must have laughed at me because I kept sniffing down the front of my shirt, it smells so good. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Not only did it keep me from feeling all hot and sticky in the Georgia humidity, I have had nonstop compliments on how good I smell.  Is it possible to order this by the case? &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Also, the product was packaged very well for shipping, and Lush kept me updated on the status of my order every day.  That alone is enough to make me trade with them again.</li>
    <li> I really like the fragrance (which is like sweet cocoa butter) but I didn&#x27;t really find anything so spectacular about this powder. It&#x27;s just like any other. I didn&#x27;t notice any glitter or anything to differentiate it from other powders.&lt;br /&gt;And it is over priced. The canister is about 2 1/2 inches tall and 3 inches wide. The shipping cost almost as much as the product.&lt;br /&gt;I gave it 4 stars based on fragrance alone, but I won&#x27;t be plunking down more cash on anymore of this powder when I can find other fragrances I like in stores.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite Lush product - and I&#x27;ve tried pretty much all of them.  It is soft and lovely on the skin, and its great-smelling fragrance blends nicely with other Lush smells (both sweet ones and earthy ones.)</li>
    <li> The dusting powder leaves your skin very smooth and is deliciously cooling to use in the summer as sometimes lotion is too heavy while you&#x27;re all sweaty :) It&#x27;s also one of the softest dusting powders by LUSH and goes on your skin very nice and silky.&lt;br /&gt;I also love a sprinkle inbetween my bedsheets whenever I change them to layer the fragance as well.</li>
    <li> I love using this right out of the shower.  You know how right after you shave your legs, lotion can sting?  I use this instead and it soothes and softens.  This is one of the first Lush products that I used, and it got me hooked.  A container also lasts a really long time.</li>
    <li> I usually do not like powder... it feels too dry and chalky. This powder is different, It actually feels slightly moisturizing. Great after a bath. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I love to put it on and then wear satin pajamas. I feel pampered!</li>
    <li> This silky powder has no talc and has a wonderful sexy fragrance. It leaves your skin very soft. You can sprinkle it on your clothes, on your sheets, on your body or you can even sprinkle it into your bathwater for a delicious scent. I used to like Lush&#x27;s Icon Powder, which has been discontinued. This powder is a nice summer treat, keeping me dry as well as scented. The scent is natural and doesn&#x27;t irritate me like some perfumes do.</li>
    <li> Finally found a powder without an overpowering scent.  It&#x27;s wonderful!  It absorbs perspiration without making you smell like a 85 year old gramma.  I&#x27;m going to stock up on this stuff!</li>
    <li> I live in Hawaii, a very humid and sticky place.  I love using lotion after I step out of the shower, but I HATE the sticky feeling it leaves behind. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Enter LUSH&#x27;s Silky Underwear Dusting Powder!!  I just use a light dusting of the powder and the lotion and my skin feel amazing!!  Silky Underwear absorbs any and all moisture on the skin, leaving it feeling fresh and it also leaves a light scent behind.  Because Silky Underwear contains cocoa butter pieces, I don&#x27;t need to apply lotion all the time and my skin still feels great. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I love this product and a littly goes a long way.</li>
    <li> When I first received this product, I wasn&#x27;t sure about it.  But after using it everyday since I&#x27;ve opened the package, I&#x27;m in love!  It works so wonderfully in my morning routine, although heavily rushed!  I love the gentle aroma it leaves on my skin, not to mention the extra silkiness it adds.  I put it on with a huge powderpuff after my lotion has settled, on top of my lotion... and I&#x27;m luxurious for the rest of the day!!</li>
    <li> This is not worth $15 (cost plus ship).  Did not produce exciting results, just an ordinary powder.  Will not order again.</li>
    <li> I rarely used dusting powder until I was introduced to Silky Underwear and I have used it for the last five-plus years after I stumbled into my first Lush shop in Canada! It has the best smell. Not too overpowering but a nice, sweet smell that lasts throughout the day. I really love wearing this on hotter summer days because it keeps me dry and silky smooth. It is really like wearing silky underwear! The only downside to the product is the plastic top, which often leaks powder and makes it difficult to travel with. Overall, though, you won&#x27;t be disappointed by this product!</li>
    <li> Smells like butter and sugar and jasmine. Yummy divine fragrance. Not the absolute silkiest bath powder i&#x27;ve ever used, (about 4 out of 5) but the fragrance and the fact that it does not cake up and show on your skin gets it all 5 stars. I love it! Definitely a luxurious treat. The cocoa butter nibs in the dusting powder are supposed to moisturize your skin, and the powder isn&#x27;t as drying as some I&#x27;ve tried... but if you&#x27;re wanting something that moisturizes, try one of Lush&#x27;s body butter bars like King of Skin instead.</li>
    <li> I typically don&#x27;t use body powders but this one is an exception.  It is smooth, great smelling, and leaves skin feeling wonderful.  Makes warm months more comfortable.</li>
    <li> I really don&#x27;t like powder all that much -- it makes me think of my grandmother.  But this powder?  This powder is sexy.  Use of this powder is not incompatible with the wearing of four-inch stiletto heels. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s extremely nice after a shower or bath.  And unlike many lotions, which can be pretty overwhelming scent-wise if you put them on your entire body, it leaves only a nice smooth feeling and a very subtle scent to remind you of its presence. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The reason I gave it four and not five stars is that I was very disappointed that it didn&#x27;t come with a powder-puff.  It&#x27;s not terribly difficult to apply with your hands, but a puff would make things much easier.</li>
    <li> When I first tried this product, I was in love! It smelled great. But the next morning, when I put it on before going to work...it smelled really odd. Perhaps it doesn&#x27;t mix well with MY body chemistry, because the lovely scent changed on my skin. I ended up washing my arms off in the bathroom at work. It smells really odd on me. The scent reminds me of the cheap, weird-smelling baby wipes my mother used to buy for my nephews. I really don&#x27;t want to smell like &#x27;butt wipes&#x27;! I might try just sprinkling it on my clothes (and rubbing it in so you can&#x27;t see it, obviously!).    Also, the container leaks pretty easily if you&#x27;re not careful handling it.</li>
    <li> I *love* the scent of this powder, and I use it a few times a week for that amazing scent - floral but richer and deeper, not cloying or old-ladyish. It smells like it is deepened by vanilla. It smells almost exactly like Fairy Jasmine and Alkmaar to my nose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It isn&#x27;t drying, in fact on a warm day the cocoa butter is moisturizing and lovely. But I wish the cocoa butter bits weren&#x27;t in this because I live in a cool climate and during the coolest half of the year the teensy cocoa butter bits are nearly impossible to melt in my skin and end up on the floor. I also would love to use this to scent my sheets, but again, cocoa butter and cloth is not the greatest combo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the scent is so good, and lingers well on the skin, so you will likely forgive the sins of the cocoa butter as I have, to enjoy this warm and sophisticated scent.</li>
    <li> Perfect for Summertime, which is quite long in Florida, or just getting out of the shower, or anytime you want to feel pampered and sexy!</li>
    <li> When I first purchased Silky Underwear after reading rave reviews, I wasn&#x27;t particularly impressed with the scent, but after a couple of days of using it, it totally grew on me! I now look forward to a light dusting of this powder before I dress in the morning. It&#x27;s not as drying as drug store products such as Shower to Shower, and I do think it&#x27;s equally absorbent. The major negative is the very poor packaging. There is a lid on top that turns to fully opened or sprinkles (kind of like a McCormick spice container). Either way, I find it unusable. I purchased a $2 powder puff in a little container at Target, and I sprinkle my Silky Underwear into this little container and the use it from there.</li>
    <li> Smells really soft and feminine.  It&#x27;s great in the summer for people like me who have dry skin and don&#x27;t wish to make it drier with talc products but don&#x27;t want to be \\&quot;sweaty\\&quot; smelling after a work out or a long walk outside.  It&#x27;s soft enough as well to wear one of the lite summer perfumes such as Valintino&#x27;s new one.  Fiancee/future hubby loves it. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Also, kudos to Lush for using the least number of preservatives and ditching unnecessary chemicals!  Sometimes I read the ingredient lists off of drug-store items or department store brands as well and recognize chemical carcinogens that we use in the lab with special precautions such as gloves, face mask, and lab-coat!!!! (a popular one is polyacrylamide and it&#x27;s derivatives  --- it&#x27;s used to \\&quot;glue\\&quot; away wrinkles)...Not so with the Lush products I&#x27;ve looked at.  Believe it or not chemical exposure over time does build up and is thought by some scientists to contribute to increased cancer risk.  Research remains to be done in this area, but in the mean time, why chance it?  We try to use brands like Lush, that use natural products...and I especially love the fact that this has no talc.  Talc is very similar chemically to asbestos, and thus talc free powders are a plus.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;In sum:  this is a GREAT product, and I&#x27;m VERY picky, so I&#x27;ll bet you&#x27;ll love it.</li>
    <li> First, its is not silky- it is a tad gritty. And second, once applied to the body, there is chalk  residue on my hands. Like I just used the black board.  &lt;br /&gt;The smell is nice and so is the hint of glitter.  Maybe my 12 yo neice will like it. &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> This is a very nice dusting powder with a pleasant light smell, but having used other LUSH products and being extremely impressed with those, I guess I was expecting more.  It doesn&#x27;t leave my skin as soft as I thought it would.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve read a lot of reviews (on the LUSH site), saying how great of a product this is.  To me, it&#x27;s not at all what I expected or wanted.  Almost every reviewer says what a nice, pleasant smell this has.. well they must have goofed on my batch because it smells nasty!  I very faintly smell jasmine, but there&#x27;s this weird medicinal, musty-type smell that&#x27;s so potent, it squashes the pretty floral part of it.  Also, it felt nice going on, but don&#x27;t expect much softness or moisture to come of this - which I thought I&#x27;d see more of because of the cocoa butter.  This was one of those things that you have to try because you&#x27;re curious but end up regretting afterwards (at least for me!).  Oh well!</li>
    <li> Fabulous, smells wonderful, soft and perfect, but container is really small.</li>
    <li> I just got my Lush package in the mail today.  After reading the reviews of this product, I questioned whether I would like it or not.  &amp; I do!!!  Silky Underwear is a very fine powder with a slight jasmine scent.  Some reviews said this was gritty, but i didn&#x27;t think so at all.  The scent isn&#x27;t so strong after you put it all over your body.  When you dump it into your hand, it might smell a little strong.  The powder left a nice soft coating on my hands, which tend to get dry alot.  I am going to be using this all the time, I can tell already...and it&#x27;s definately going in my sheets!</li>
    <li> IT&#x27;S HARD TO DESCRIBE BUT THE FRAGRANCE IS NOT PLEASING...TRY ONE OF LUSH&#x27;S OTHER GREAT PRODUCTS.</li>
    <li> not any better than baby powder. Smells good though.</li>
    <li> I love this item! It smells great and is very silky in texture. Would buy again and will! The only issue I have with it is that the holes on the can are too big for such super-fine powder. I would recommend that they be made smaller so not so much comes out at once. I have it turned to just a couple of holes but it still could be made better.</li>
    <li> This is the most heavenly skin product I have ever used.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I started using this product a few weeks ago and absolutely love the way it makes my skin feel. It has this light musty jasmine scent. You may not love the smell at first, but honestly it grows on you. I generally put this on after a shower and it feels like it rolls over my skin. Hours later my skin still smells lovely and so smooth.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The great thing about this too is that a very little goes a long way. I keep it in my underwear drawer, but I plan on using this in my laundry and my bedsheets as well.  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;A note about opening this product: BE VERY CAREFUL. The canister requires you to push in a tab that, if just popped in, will cause powder to get everywear. I take a knife and pry it upward very slowly so I can grab it and pull it out instead of losing it inside the can. Then, I actually keep the top closed when I pour, as sufficent poweder comes out. The holes let out just too much powder.</li>
    <li> This container lasts quite a long time and even then I use it like crazy.. It&#x27;s silky smooth on my skin and contains the smallest bits or cocoa butter that blend right in like silk.</li>
    <li> Got product in a timely matter and very happy with it</li>
    <li> hard to apply.  smells better than normal baby powder.  not reall sure if it does anything different.  no one has every mentioned the scent of it.  i guess its just cool cause its lush lol. best lush product ever is the Buffy.  you will LOVE the buffy :)</li>
    <li> My gram loves this stuff! It&#x27;s soft and silky.  The smell is wonderful.  It is a bit pricey but you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> This dusting powder smells great and leaves your skin silky smooth.  My boyfriend loves the way it smells on my skin.</li>
    <li> I want to love Lush products but I have yet to find one that I even like. Like all of Lush&#x27;s products, this one has a funky smell to it, although I will admit, it&#x27;s not as bad as most of their products.  Any talc product is supposed to absorb moisture, and there are a lot of powders on the market that smell better than this.  The package design on Lush&#x27;s powders are terrible.  It is very difficult to not have powder go everywhere.  I ended up buying another container to put the powder in.  For the amount of money you spend on Lush products, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s too much to ask for good product packaging.</li>
    <li> This product smells really nice and feels really lovely and smooth. However, it does not really have staying power.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t like the smell at all but the formula itself is wonderfully soothing for my skin. If it weren&#x27;t for the grandma stank of it, I would give 5 stars. Maybe if there&#x27;s another scent available, I&#x27;d try that.</li>
    <li> Normally I love lush products, but this powder is really too fine and just dusts everything instead of your body.  It really is hard to get on, (maybe that&#x27;s why they put it in a sprinkle cannister instead of using a puff) and just goes everywhere.  Scent is a bit cloying too.  I&#x27;ll keep buying Lush because I love it, but stay away from the powder.</li>
    <li> Wow .. I LOVE this stuff.  Be aware that if you use it you&#x27;ll smell like coconut souffle but omg it feels great and smells good if you like the fragrance!</li>
    <li> i love this powder! It&#x27;s very light and wonderfully fragrant. It has this very clean smell that really is FEMME!  Glad I bought 2.</li>
    <li> I read the reviews and made my choice by them. But not to happy although it does feel soft on the skin. I DO NOT like the scent. I was hoping it would smell nicer. SO I will use it on my feet. (lol)</li>
    <li> I admittedly have never used powders of any kind of a regular basis (I am trying to figure out how a dry powder moisturizes skin). However, I appreciate the light scent - it&#x27;s kind of cocoa like, but not like your kids chocolate flavored lip gloss. I&#x27;ve been using it under my arms during the winter months.</li>
    <li> has a really nice, silky feel on the skin. i like the scent, but it may not be for everyone. i&#x27;ll buy it again</li>
    <li> This item is soooo much better than the average drug store equivalent - try it!</li>
    <li> The powder definitely has a silky, fine texture.  However, this scent was not as appealing to me as another from the Lush line.  It really is an unusual fragance.  I used it twice.  I&#x27;ll give it to my niece to try.  But, I won&#x27;t purchase this one again.</li>
    <li> thnk you for you the order is very good as what I whant and it nice to use thank agen to you</li>
    <li> I really love the scent of this - I used to use baby powder but this is much more delightful. It smells absolutely lovely.</li>
