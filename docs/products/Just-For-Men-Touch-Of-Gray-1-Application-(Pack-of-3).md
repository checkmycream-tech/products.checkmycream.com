<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> At least that is what everyone else thinks. Even my wife has not noticed that I an noticeably less grey than I was. I like grey, just not that much of it!</li>
    <li> The price is almost the same as buying it from Walgreen&#x27;s.  It would be nice if this was a bit more cheaper.  The container can be used about 3 or 4 times if you don&#x27;t have to much hair.</li>
    <li> It the best at home coloring I&#x27;ve found that looks natural.  By leaving some grey and my sideburns white i look very much like I did 15 years ago.  The only problems relate to care in using it.  I put Vaseline on my temples so I don&#x27;t stain the skin.  And I also get all fabrics out of the way when applying because if stained, it won&#x27;t come out</li>
    <li> Works great. People don&#x27;t know that I&#x27;m coloring my hair. I&#x27;d give it 5 stars if it wasn&#x27;t that expensive. It should be less expensive and the tubes should be a bit larger because many times I end up opening a second tube to cover all my hair(I have fairly short hair).</li>
    <li> Very Easy To Apply, For My First Time, I Was Pleasently Supprised , The Comb Applicator And Gel, Very Easy To Use, Allows me to Control How Much Gray Stays Or Goes, I Give This product Thumbs UP....</li>
    <li> Since you&#x27;re reading this, I assume you&#x27;ve started to notice that your greys are overtaking your natural color.&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re like me, you&#x27;re apprehensive about friends and co-workers noticing that your hair has suddenly gone from grey to anthracite black.  That&#x27;s not going to happen with this product.&lt;br /&gt;A comb attaches to the tube and you comb it through, nice coverage, and wash it out after about five minutes.  No one noticed but me.  Definitely eases that &amp;#34;who the hell is that looking at me in the mirror?&amp;#34; sensation.</li>
    <li> My hair came out looking like it was navy blue! On the box, it has three different types of tones that get darker based on how many times you apply it. Mine had looked like I had applied it three times. I&#x27;m sure that this product fades (at least I hope so).</li>
    <li> Dear friends,&lt;br /&gt;I would like to thank you very much for sending my order soon.&lt;br /&gt;I found it as I expected , and I will be back to place my second order.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you again.&lt;br /&gt;Regards,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ali Khalifa&lt;br /&gt;Bahrain</li>
