<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I already use Arbonne products.  I had ordered this direct but it was backordered.  So glad to see there are other Arbonne products as well.</li>
    <li> This is the best skin softening, anti-wrinkle cream I have ever used. And it contains pure, organic ingredients. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Outside of Clinique&#x27;s Moisture Surge this is the best under makeup cream I have found yet for very dry skin.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t usually go for products of this nature, but first of all, I took one whiff and I was hooked.  It has a lovely orangey non-perfumey fragrance which is quite subtle.  I can&#x27;t tolerate stronge perfume, but this is perfect .  The texture is perfect.  And most importantly, I do believe it works.</li>
    <li> My favorite night cream. I&#x27;m well over 50 and my skin is exposed to harsh elements: winter and summer</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing!  It took me at least 2-3 nights to figure out I only needed a tiny bit to cover my whole face.  It feels great on my skin, and it&#x27;s not oily.  I will definitely buy this again and again.</li>
    <li> I love this night cream, its what I look forward to at night after brushing my teeth and cleansing my face. A yucky fact, I wake up looking more alert and rested, but my impurities turn into little rocks. I literally smooth off any blackheads and white heads. No need for pinching my face. I get more compliments now on my face glowing than ever. 31 and constantly getting confused for 25. Yea buddy my creams are doing work. I use the re9 cleanser, re9 eye cream and this re9 cream. Your never to young to start taking care of your face.</li>
    <li> I have worn this product now for almost a year and it really does work.  In The past, I purchased this particular at home demonstrations at a much more expensive price.  The cream is rich, with just a mild citrus smell. Does not cake or clump and a little bit goes a long way.</li>
    <li> I love this product. This is the second time I have purchased it. I am 53 years old and my skin looks fantastic. I also love the fact that Arbonne products do not do any animal testing. Way to go Arbonne!</li>
    <li> Every morning after using this night cream, your face will feel so soft and smooth.  It&#x27;s a great product!</li>
    <li> Arbonne RE9 Advanced Night Repair is the best.  I use it every night and can see visible improvement in my skin.</li>
    <li> I just love this night creme. This is the only thing that works on my face! I&#x27;ve tried everything else, and nothing out there is better.</li>
    <li> I have always been an Arbonne fan.  This product is amazing and worth every penny.  You do not need very much of it, so it will last you a long time.  It is very hydrating and gives your skin a healthy glow.  It was a lot less money to buy it through Amazon than to buy it with a retailer who sells it from their home.  The supplier listed on Amazon for this product was very speedy in getting it delivered.</li>
    <li> I hope I see some results soon.  All arbonne products are heavenly and I really like the way this creme feels.  I only gave 4 stars because even though amazon offered this cream at a lower price than the arbonne website it is still toooooo expensive for the small jar of cream.  It doesn&#x27;t make me break out like most other cream&#x27;s so I&#x27;m happy with the purchase.</li>
    <li> I use this product morning. I especially like to use it after a shower, when my face pores are open. To make it go a little farther, I use it on a damp face. After the Moore May 20, 2013 tornado, I had to replace all my skin care and my makeup. Our house was damanaged this time, and not destroyed like it was in May 1999.  At thee relief center, Arbonne had given a lot of samples, and people were mostly wanting a full size product. So the worker gave me a huge handful. I used it everyday, and used other samples of Arbonne at the same time. When my sister came down to help me with the house in June, she said she expected to see me looking like death warmed over, because of the long hot hours I was putting in to fix my house.  Instead  she said she found me looking younger and fresher. I hadn&#x27;t told her what  was using, just because I wanted to know if it was working. She loved the results so much, we had to find an Arbonne Dealer before she left so she could buy the products.  For her birthday, I found Arbonne on Amazon and ordered her some. I know I have reviewed many face care products and each time the next one is better than the last... However, when we went to get my sister&#x27;s products from an Arbonne dealer, a lady there told us she had been using these products for 25 years. She was 80 years old, and looked 50!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I begin each morning and evening routine the same way. I wash my face with Arbonne  FC5 Cleanser and toner.I love the fresh clean smell. Next I put on the Revelage Concentrated Age Spot Minimzer on a damp, not wet face. Morning I use the Restorative Day Creme and the Corrective Eye  Creme. Night I use the Intensive Night Serum and the Night Repair Creme. They all smell so fresh and clean and my skin feels soft and supple.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had some really deep wrinkles, and the samples I had were the FC5 series.  That series made a huge difference. Because I am 56 years old, I replace the samples with the RE9 Series.  I don&#x27;t know if I can tell a difference between the two... so I am doing an experiment. One side of my face I am using the RE9 and the other side I am using Revelage and FC5 series. When I see my sister in December, I am going to ask her which side looks the best and I will update this review.</li>
    <li> I am so excited to have found this product line on Amazon--much cheaper than going through a family member that is an Arbonne rep!</li>
    <li> The ads for this cream were very specific, but i have to say it does everything the ads says it will.</li>
    <li> In the last 9 months I have been in the hospital 4 1/2 months. The ravages of medication, anesthesia and illness has taken a toll on my skin...my daughter suggested I try this cream! WOW!!! It works and I have even had people ask if I had a face lift while I was in the hospital!&lt;br /&gt;Love it!!</li>
    <li> Arbonne products are not to be sold on AMAZON!! It is not compliant within the Arbonne policies. If you purchase you DO NOT know what you are getting and how old it is or if it has been used!! Find an Arbonne consultant in your area and support them and their business instead of this illegal platform of sellng these products!!!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for approx. 8-10 days and have not noticed results. I am patient so I will wait until it is complete to give it a chance.</li>
    <li> I have been using this night creme for the past two years.  I LOVE IT.  My skin is overly dry in the fall and winter months and this creme helps me from drying out to much.</li>
    <li> This is a great product and I was sure happy to find it at Amazon&#x27;s lower price! It arrived quickly and the entire process was efficient. Thanks!</li>
    <li> Another very expensive item that is more affordable here than arbonne! So glad i was able to get it here because this stuff is the best!</li>
    <li> This actually does make a wonderful difference in my skin on my face and neck. I dilute it with a little water and use it as a day cream as well as overnight.</li>
    <li> Love Arbonne products&lt;br /&gt;I give this product a 5 star because it works&lt;br /&gt;Keeps you looking young and beautiful  love it</li>
    <li> THIS IS THE BEST PRODUCT</li>
    <li> I had run out completely before I received the new jar.  Amazing the difference in how my face feels now.</li>
    <li> Have my doubts about the authenticity of this product. I&#x27;ve used the Arbonne night cream before and it never felt so sticky on my face... Would not buy from this seller again. Will probably get from a Arbonne rep and pay the extra $20.</li>
    <li> I have roseca and all the Arbonne products have completely cleared it for me and work beautifully. I use the entire Re9 line.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for almost 10 years now.  They did change the formula a long while back and I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s quite as potent, but still the best I&#x27;ve found-- better than Garnier Ultra-Lift (which made me break out), better than L&#x27;Oreal Revistalift Night (couldn&#x27;t see results), and better than Olay Professional PROX eye (also couldn&#x27;t see results or evenly apply make-up overtop).  Since it&#x27;s pricey, I use the night cream, actually, just in my wrinkle/fine line-prone areas (for me, under eyes, laugh lines, and between eye brows)-- I also use more during the day (because I use Alpha Hydrox Souffle-- best stuff too-- at night). To be honest (not very HUMBLY honest), I think this stuff has made my skin look YOUNGER than it did the almost-10 years I&#x27;ve been using it (now if there were just some solution to counteract gravity). Seriously, worth the money.</li>
    <li> I WAS CAUTIOUS IN ORDERING THIS PRODUCT AS SO MANY PRODUCTS TELL YOU THEY ARE MIRACLE WORKERS. I HAVE ALWAYS USED GOOD PRODUCTS, BUT THOUGHT THIS LOOKED INTERESTNG. I TRIED IT AND WAS BLOWN&lt;br /&gt;OUT OF THE WATER WITH THE RESULTS. MAGNIFICIENT!  TRY IT YOU WILL LOVE IT.&lt;br /&gt;J TOMLINSON</li>
    <li> Exactly what I was looking for for a good price</li>
    <li> Use this brand of products they work very well for my skin type and they are priced reasonably.</li>
    <li> Very Important - Arbonne uses very little preservative and the FDA allows that because it&#x27;s never stored in a warehouse.  You risk using a product that has mold and spores in it because it&#x27;s been sitting with this seller for who knows how long!  Get your savings directly from the company with their Preferred Client Program and be safe!!</li>
    <li> Quick delivery. Disappointed how small container was for cost.</li>
    <li> Arbonne has an expiration date!! There is about a two year expiration date per product. They do not list the expiration date, plus you have no idea if you&#x27;re getting Arbonne in these containers.</li>
    <li> Great product.  Expensive but its worth the price as it kept my face feeling moist and I noticed less wrinkles after a few days of use. You only need to use a little bit.  Ive tried many top rated department store and drugstore creams and this one is on top for providing moisture! My skin loves Arbonne Night Repair Cream!! Ive finally found my night cream after years and years of looking!!</li>
    <li> RE9 - Makes my skin look healthy.  At my age, I appreciate having a product I can depend on to continue working without causing areas of irritation.</li>
    <li> I own most of the RE9 Advanced Products but the Night Repair Creme is my favorite.   When I started using this product I was surprised and delighted. I would put it on before I went to sleep and when I woke up my skin tone was more even and any blemishes I had were gone, or noticeably healed and smaller. Absolutely love this product! Whenever I have breakouts I use this, and the next day there is a serious difference.  Also, this works well on multiple generations of women. My mother uses this product also (she&#x27;s the one that introduced me to it), and she&#x27;s in her 50&#x27;s while I&#x27;m in my 20&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cream for several years, and am completely happy with it. Although it&#x27;s quite a bit more expensive that some other creams of this type, I find it very nourishing and emollient as a night time treatment. Amazon purchase was much cheaper than retail Thanks!</li>
    <li> The size of this item is much smaller than comparable prices other sites.  Very surprised at the small amount. Not good.</li>
    <li> A must have for nightly routine.</li>
    <li> I get this product for my mom.  She has extremely dry skin.  She uses it as a daily moisturizer.  The last time I ordered it, the container was much larger and the same price.  So that was disappointing when it arrived.  I got less product for the same amount of money.  No bueno.</li>
    <li> This product is fabulous!  ...when used in conjunction with the series.  I have used probably close to 100+ products and prescriptions on my face and skin for acne, dryness, uneven tone and this helps take care of it all!  Not only do pimples rarely pop up, but when they do, they never come to a head and recede within a day or two leaving my skin un-scarred.  Amazing product!  I know it&#x27;s expensive but it is definitely worth it!</li>
    <li> I am 29 years old and I just ordered another one of these creams. I really love this cream because it&#x27;s not greasy, it smells great it absorbs quickly but most importantly it makes my skin look healthier and it does it&#x27;s job. With most other creams I saw very little difference but with this one I can&#x27;t wait to put it on at night. The bottle lased me about 6 months and I just ordered another one. There are two different bottles one is glass one is plastic , but it seams like the product is the same and they are both 30 ml.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 27 n started to notice summ forehead wrinkles n decided it was time for a new step .i had the sample there n placed it on one night and by early morning I felt my skin so supple and refresh I was amazed do for that I give 4 stars because the price totally kills it too much 💰</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried several face cremes and this one has been the best for my sensitive skin. The product is offered at a great price and arrived on time. I&#x27;d definitely recommend to others and will purchase again!</li>
    <li> This was nice night cream. Made my face feel soft and helped diminish fine lines alittle. Used it for 2 months straight and didnt notice any dramatic improvements to buy again for this high price. I notice the same results from Avon products, at half the cost.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this half way so far.  Really not seeing anything different for the more inexpensive creme products.  I will not buy it again.</li>
    <li> The cream was unsealed and has a different feel from the night repair cream I just finished, not sure it is the real product.</li>
    <li> received package on time.. excellent.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Arbonne night creme as a day creme because I live in such a dry climate.  It works great and I would definitely  recommend it.</li>
    <li> This was a decent price. Cheaper than the Arbonne site. The item arrived quickly and the description was accurate. I like the way it makes my skin look and feel.</li>
    <li> Love the night cream!,, makes my skin feel really good! I would recommend it to anyone! Love it love it!</li>
    <li> RE 9 is excellent for removing frown lines on the forehead and puffiness under the eyes. This product works wonders.</li>
    <li> I do like this night cream, though I wish the container were larger for the price. Not greasy and very hydrating. I even use it in the daytime as it is aborbed into my skin very nicely with no residue. Also, I have very sensitive skin (no idea what I&#x27;m allergic to) and this does not make my face break out (very few products I can say this about). Considering purchasing it again if I can&#x27;t find an equivalent product with more for your money.</li>
    <li> I have used this night cream for years and love it.  This was a gift for my daughter.  Thanks for your quick shipping.</li>
    <li> This does not feel like the RE-9. Feels hard and sticky. It did not come in a box and was in the outdated jar. I would NEVER buy this product from this seller again!!</li>
    <li> Exactly what I ordered.  Prompt delivery.  Excellent product for people with sensitive skin.  I use it for day and night.</li>
    <li> Arbonne does not authorize the sell of their products on Amazon. You may not be dealing with a very honest seller, who may not be selling you the original Arbonne product. That is too high a risk for this kind of money and on a product you will be applying to your face. If you wish to continue to save a few bucks, I caution you to reconsider.</li>
    <li> Everything arbonne has is great anyway.  Just put this cream on your face night and day and you will have much better skin almost immediately. The cream feels so cool and has a very tiny citrus smell.  I absolutely love it.</li>
    <li> Recommended to me by a friend -- Yes, I have recommended this item to friends.  Very easy to apply, absorbs completely with a feeling of smoothness.  Very satisfied.</li>
    <li> great product...does what it says...corrects severely dry skin and protects against further damage...plus it is organic and absorbs well yeah</li>
    <li> My daughter-in-law introduced me to this product and I swear by it&#x27;s powers to minimize discoloration and resist wrinkles. Although I don&#x27;t use the other products in this line, I use it along with my Mary Kay cleanser every night.</li>
    <li> I started purchasing the RE9 Arbonne products a few years ago. Love this product!  I&#x27;m actually ordering another jar of the Night Repair Creme today!</li>
    <li> LOVE this cream, the best!</li>
    <li> Love this night cream!  It is the only one I use and can not find one better!  So happy it us available on Amazon so I can get a good deal!</li>
    <li> I love it, but this will not last long!</li>
