      <li>&amp; I&#x27;ll give you my best answer.</li>
      <li>Let me start off by saying I am very impressed with the Panasonic Beauty Line.</li>
      <li>--it works, it&#x27;s portable, and it&#x27;s  so cute!!!</li>
      <li>and it still wasn&#x27;t very good.  </li>
      <li>The easy-to-change batteries are great, as is the ability to rinse under running water.</li>
      <li>The shaver didn&#x27;t do a great job in the bikini area.  </li>
      <li>my daughter and I experienced no issues with the head</li>
      <li>The shaver didn&#x27;t do a great job in the bikini area.  </li>

    <li> I looked at this and thought, I wasted my money. To my surprise this little blade is fantastic. It trims the hair, the skin feel smooth. The rotating head makes it easy to access places that you cannot get to with an ordinary shaver.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s compact size makes it perfect for travelling taking up little to know room in your travelling bad. It is battery operated but powerful enough to do a smooth shave.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this shaver. There is only one con the blade is not replaceable. I recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I purchased this along with two other Panasonic women products. It was for my gf&#x27;s birthday and she loves stuff like this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At a first glance she loved the stylish look the shaver had to it. After a week, she told me how useful the shaver is. She tells me how she takes it with her everywhere she goes. She loves the fact that it has yet to cut/irritate her unlike other shavers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyways it comes in a sleek case, so its virtually undetectable as a shaver which is why i thought she&#x27;d like it. The case looks like a lipgloss or a mascara so no1 would even guess what it really is. I always hear her complain how it costs like $20 for 4 replacement blades for her regular shaver AND they would only last a few months. The blade on this shaver lasts up to 5 years! It&#x27;s only been a week or so but so far so good!</li>
    <li> This is a \\&quot;to-go\\&quot; shaver with a neat little carrying case about the size of a Mini-Maglite. The only thing the shaver is really good for is to catch those spots you might have missed while shaving in the shower. For me that&#x27;s usually around the ankles and knees. This unit is for dry shaving only, although the blade can be run under water to clean it. It also comes with a very tiny brush to get the hairs out of the blade, but there&#x27;s nowhere to fit the brush inside the carrying case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not impressed with the results from this shaver. I fail to see how mechanization improves performance. Sure, it vibrates while you&#x27;re using it, but that doesn&#x27;t make for better hair removal. If I have to buy AAA batteries to use a razor, I want it to be worth the money. This shaver doesn&#x27;t shave as well as my plain old razor with twin-blade razor heads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I ordered this shaver, the Amazon product page indicated that the blade would last 5 years. This is incorrect. The box says the blade gives \\&quot;up to 2 years of usage,\\&quot; and \\&quot;replacement blades are not available for this product.\\&quot;</li>
    <li> The Panasonic Beauty Line Ladies Precision Body Shaver comes in a pretty hot pink case with matching lid &amp; a small cleaning brush.  It requires one triple A battery, which is not included.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This unit is used on clean, dry skin.  You can pivot the head so it&#x27;s in an \\&quot;I\\&quot; shape, or keep it in a standard \\&quot;T\\&quot; shape.  Cute as it is, the item just doesn&#x27;t give me a close shave like I get with disposable razors.  I tried it at different angles, on different areas of body hair, with and without slight pressure, pulling the skin taut as recommended in the instructions, and while hair was cut off, it wasn&#x27;t a close shave at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The good news is that you use this shaver on dry skin and there is no irritation from the blade.  The bad news is that it doesn&#x27;t give a close shave.  I would recommend this for someone that can&#x27;t safely use a razor with a sharp blade, or for a young girl, as her first razor.  For me, I will continue to use disposable razors, as I prefer a close shave.</li>
    <li> I got this to use on my face for touch-ups between waxing, as well as missing hair on legs/underarms etc.  It does pull your hair a bit, not extremely painful but if you were expecting a razor-like feeling, you will have to adjust.  I like that you can rotate the head of the razor, but it is a bit flimsy and will slide around some.  I didn&#x27;t get this expecting it to replace my regular razor...just for touch-up jobs and it will work fine for that.  It states the blade will last 5 years so that will be interesting to see, but no dulling issues so far.</li>
    <li> Who would think that something that looks like a tube of mascara is actually an \\&quot;electric\\&quot; razor?  It&#x27;s intended for DRY use (NOT with shaving cream and water), and much to my surprise, it works great dry and doesn&#x27;t leave any razor rash; I&#x27;ve used it on my legs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Powered by a single AAA battery (the small ones), it has a pivoting head that easily rotates into place once you take the top off.  The head also \\&quot;pivots\\&quot; back and forth as needed to get a close shave &amp; the instructions say the blade will last up to five years. It looks like it will.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s portable, practical, and gives as close a shave as a conventional ladies&#x27; razor; highly recommended!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have a question about any features, just leave a comment &amp; I&#x27;ll give you my best answer.</li>
    <li> This shaver has proved to be good tool for the removal of those fine hairs that seem to cover your back and arms.</li>
    <li> I had a more powerful Remington before I bought this shaver. It was ok at first.  Took longer than usual to shave but did an OK job. Trimming wasn&#x27;t as tight as before. Then after using about two or three dozen times its batteries were worn out. The Remington that I had before lasted 1-2 years.</li>
    <li> Not bad, not great, this is fine if you&#x27;re not expecting too much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, you need to buy 2 AAA batteries. Second it shaves dry--so good on the go. It is not a great close shave but it is definitely a convenience for an easy touch up when you&#x27;re away from home.</li>
    <li> This shaver is OK for a quick touch up but it doesn&#x27;t seem to have a lot of cutting power. This biggest problem with it is that the head doesn&#x27;t securely fasten into the position it is set in. This causes it to rotate sometimes when you are using it and that is a problem. I can&#x27;t say I would recommend this shaver due to this problem alone.</li>
    <li> Panasonic has made some really excellent products over the years, but when it has came down their electronic devices, I have been very skeptical to know whether they can actually deliver. They have had few shavers that have been worth their while. This one though works well for ladies with their Percision Body Shaver. It works very well with the touch of the blade and the body in a instant. The AAA battery life handles very well with each and every shave. My only gripe though is that I wish it could&#x27;ve had a longer battery life that runs true to its word. Also, I do wish they could have made it more everlasting, by having you purchase interchanging blades that could replace the original one. Nevertheless, it works well, and is definitely worth the money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Price: B-&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Comfort: B-&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall: B-</li>
    <li> I had much the same experience as other reviewers... this is nice as a dry razor for touch ups. Which isn&#x27;t something I particularly need. It works well for that one purpose, but I can&#x27;t bring myself to give 5 stars to s product I find so superfluous. But I&#x27;ll give it four stars for working well within its scope, but caution buyers that it&#x27;s probably unnecessary.</li>
    <li> Let me start off by saying I am very impressed with the Panasonic Beauty Line. The product looks and works amazing. I am able to keep a shaver in my make-up bag without any knowing what it is! I am always on the go with business trips and going to the gym and now I can get rid of unwanted hair where ever and whenever I need to. The shaver is not electric and it runs on just one triple A battery. I have had mines for a month and it still runs fast and strong.  I love how you can flip the shaver for horizontal use to vertical use. This is great for those stubborn hairs that has different directions. My result is smooth, soft, and hair-free skin. I have sensitive skin and I must admit that this blade does not irritate my skin like most blades. Before this product, I would never even imagine using a shaver dry. Now I can without itchy dry skin. Like I said, I am always on the move and sometimes you know body hairs can grow in overnight but what this product, I don&#x27;t have to embarrass myself during my cardio classes anymore. I honestly recommend this product because it is very convenient. It is perfect for busy moms, business woman, people who love to work out, college students, and just about anyone who wants to be hair-free !</li>
    <li> This razor works as it should. Shaving is fast and smooth. Like many other reviewers indicate, it shaves dry, so I think it&#x27;s quite convenient. However, there are three major drawbacks. First, the blade can&#x27;t be replaced. So when it&#x27;s blunt, it&#x27;s gone. Secondly, it needs batteries. Personally, that&#x27;s quite inconvenient. Lastly, it&#x27;s expensive for a razor. So I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this. If you need a razor, then get a regular one for only a few bucks.</li>
    <li> The body shaver is a sleek little device that comes with a cap and a little brush. (where does the brush go?) Unfortunately, it didn&#x27;t work very well for me. It is a \\&quot;dry\\&quot; shaver. I tried it on my legs and although it did shave some hair, my legs felt nubby-not smooth. The device is loud-which is also annoying. I&#x27;d rather use a traditional razor with better results.</li>
    <li> Easy to use, practical and aesthetically pleasing. Nicely wrapped so it makes a great gift. What more could one want? Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Ok product, pulls the hairs a little, but maybe I&#x27;m using it incorrectly</li>
    <li> My two issues with the Panasonic Beauty Line Ladies Precision Body Shaver - uncomfortable grip and a rough shave - may be related.  The straight handle and perpendicular razor holder simply do not allow me to hold the razor comfortably, securely, or effectively.  Consequently, I am not able to get a good clean swipe, and have to go over the same area several times.  I prefer the accomodating feel of a curved handle provided by plastic disposables.  I feel bad for adding to landfills, but I discovered how nearly impossible it is to find a ladies electric razors when my 15-year old electric died.</li>
    <li> I noticed this shaver when I ordered the matching Panasonic eyelash curler (which I love!) This shaver has the same cap and design as the eyelash curler, so it caught my attention.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This isn&#x27;t the type of thing that I normally buy online, but when I saw the price and the line that said there is a long-lasting blade, I figured it would be worth a try. I&#x27;m really glad I bought it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I usually rush while shaving in the shower and miss spots on my legs, typically near my ankles.  Of course, I never notice this until I&#x27;m on the train or already at work. I keep this shaver in my bag and whip it out whenever I realize that I&#x27;ve missed a spot.  It&#x27;s a perfect touch-up shaver - especially because you can&#x27;t cut yourself with the blade, like you can with a razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read on the packaging that it works best dry, so I strictly use it when I need a quick touch-up.  I still have my disposable shaver at home which I use for everyday shaving in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I give this shaver a 10 out of 10! Be sure to use it correctly - as a dry, touch-up shaver - and you&#x27;ll be very glad you purchased!</li>
    <li> I pretty much shave my legs every other day in the summer and every three to four in winter. And since I can&#x27;t wear my glasses in the shower, I often miss a lot of hair. This shaver works only in dry conditions, so it&#x27;s ideal for those missed zones you discover when putting on your panty hose. The shave is not as close as a traditional throw away razor, but it&#x27;s definitely better than stubble stripes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find the shaver quite handy to keep in the bathroom cupboard for touch-ups.</li>
    <li> I tried this on my legs, on my neckline, on the \\&quot;sideburns\\&quot; of my haircut by my ears. All of these hairs were short or medium-length and not dense. But...this shaver simply did nothing. (I verified this by holding a piece of paper underneath to see the \\&quot;shavings\\&quot; and there were none. When I tapped the razor, nothing fell out or off. It didn&#x27;t even perform as a touch-up.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was a huge disappointment as I loved its clever design and portability, which would make it perfect for travel. (The closed case is just a bit shy of six inches and the circumference of the top/bottom cap is about a half inch or so. And very lightweight.) And it uses only one AAA battery, not those odd-sized and expensive batteries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, none of that matters if the basic shaving component does not work and it does not work.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not that it didn&#x27;t shave close. It didn&#x27;t shave at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FYI: It says it comes with a cleaning brush. There was no such brush in the package this came in. Which leads me to believe that perhaps this was a refurbed model or the equivalent of a \\&quot;second\\&quot; model. Or, simply defective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shaving head is a nice size and it flips so you can use it vertically or horizontally, which makes it easy to reach various parts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, again, none of this matters if the item does not perform the basic function of shaving.</li>
    <li> Instead of the body shaver, I was sent a battery-operated lash-curler. I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s a good lash-curler but a) I don&#x27;t need it and have absolutely no use for it and b) I still want the Panasonic Body Shaver. I heard it was a great product from a few people and really wanted to try it out for myself.</li>
    <li> I am always on the lookout for new shavers as I have fairly sensitive skin and this shaver is (or at least can be) easier on your skin than the regular disposable shavers I use in the shower.  The trouble is that this shaver is really mostly for touch-ups.  It won&#x27;t give you the close shave you want but if you miss a spot or are out camping or something, it works well enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend you follow the manufacturer&#x27;s instructions should you buy this shaver as there are no replacement blades available for it.  And, since you will be spending over $20 for this, that might be a consideration.  Another possible consideration is that you need one AAA battery.  For me, that was a bit of a pain as while our charger does AAA batteries, it does four at a time so needing just the one was a hassle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still, as someone who is always missing spots when I shave, I think this is a great idea and, for that, am giving this (somewhat expensive) shaver four rather than three stars.</li>
    <li> I got this Panasonic Beauty Line Ladies Precision Body Shaver for my stepdaughter.  She is an active, working, single mom, and I thought she might find this shaver to be a useful time saver.  Her comments: \\&quot;The Panasonic shaver is asthetically pleasing, convenient, and easy to use with clear directions.  It&#x27;s great for touch-up shaving, however I would not recommend it for heavy hair removal as it can pull uncomfortably.  On a scale from 1-10 I give it an 8.\\&quot;  She went on to add this shaver would be most useful in the summertime for touch-up shaving prior to wearing bathing suits but would not be useful for routine usage.  She really liked the styling of the shaver, though, and thought its compactness was handy for purse carry.</li>
    <li> I normally use a manual razor, so I had a bit of trepidation about shaving my legs dry with this razor. I was worried about nicks, discomfort, etc. The good news is that none of those problems occurred. The bad news is that the reason for the lack of problems is that this razor doesn&#x27;t provide a close shave at all. I went over the same spot three times and still felt stubble. And I don&#x27;t have really course hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This razor will probably just end up in the garbage (or in my junk drawer until my guilt at throwing a new razor away subsides enough for me to transfer it to the garbage).</li>
    <li> Panasonic has created a new line of battery-powered slimline products for women. I tried this out with mixed results. The unit is small and self-contained. The enclosed brush can be stored inside the cap if need be. It does not come with the AAA battery required for operation, so be sure to have one on hand when you are ready to use it. The razor has an adjustable head that will flip and lock into a horizontal or a vertical position. I mainly used the horizontal mode and was able to remove all the targeted hair. The length of the hair to cut might require that you go over the area a second or third time. In order to shave the hair, you must have the blade FLAT and at the right angle to the area being shaved or it won&#x27;t cut close enough. The shave isn&#x27;t that \\&quot;close\\&quot; and I can still feel a little stubble even after repeated passes over the area. Hair collects on the head and you must use the brush to clean it off into some sort of receptacle and I imagine that other debris simply falls in the area. You can also clean it under running water but you can&#x27;t use this unit in the shower as it works best when shaving dry. The blade sort of pivots up and down. I don&#x27;t know yet how long the battery will last or how long the blade will remain sharp. It is a product that would be good when traveling for touch ups. I&#x27;m satisfied to a degree with its performance.</li>
    <li> very light weight, did not work after 2 minutes. and retail vendor did not honor return.  Had to return shaver to Panasonic in the Tex returns office and had to pay return shipping of $4 on a item casting $23. No idea on how long it will take to get credit.  Not happy at all with Retailer, Amazon or Panasonic.</li>
    <li> Ok... I know I got to try this for free, but please do not buy this product.  It&#x27;s pure junk.  Leaves stubble and very uncomfortable to use.  It also does not lock in place as advertised, the head just spins around, who tested this thing?    I use another Panasonic shaver - [[ASIN:B0009DT39C Panasonic ES2113PC Pivoting Head Facial Trimmer, Pink]].  I bought mine in 2007 on amazon, and it still works great, and I love it to pieces.  Just an amazing product every woman should own.</li>
    <li> Update:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This shaver is cute with a head that pivots into a compact design that is roughly the size of mascara. It&#x27;s embedded in a stunning bright pink case. Unfortunately the lock on the blade never worked, but it didn&#x27;t matter-my daughter and I experienced no issues with the head moving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This takes a AAA battery inserted in the base. You simply flick on a metal switch at the side to turn on. The shaver comes with a tiny brush that I wish could be stored somewhere within the unit, so it&#x27;s already lost...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We have med.-fine hair that blends with our skin tone, so getting the closest shave isn&#x27;t imperative for us. Still, this cuts well going against the direction of hair growth.  I love that we can quickly shave without fear of nicks/cuts whatsoever. For this reason, I definitely recommend The Travel Precision Body Shaver for young, first-time shavers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*The manufacturer recommends dry shaving for best results. Also, the back of the box as well as manual gives warnings that there are no replacement blades available for this product. That&#x27;s disappointing for us, since we really don&#x27;t need more than this. Fortunately, this \\&quot;long lasting micro blade\\&quot; is supposed to be good for UP TO 2 years of usage (particularly when used for dry shaving). They do recommend rinsing the blade with water to clean after brushing it off, but AVOID SOAP.</li>
    <li> I love the design and it is a great idea.  I love the convenient case and I wish all shavers could rotate.  The problem that I with it is the actual shaving.  It is isn&#x27;t very effective.  The shave is not close, so you will have the feeling of stubble and it isn&#x27;t very powerful.  I used a new battery and it still wasn&#x27;t very good.  It isn&#x27;t designed for thick or dense hair.  I have coarse hair, so that may have been a reason why it didn&#x27;t work for me.  You won&#x27;t get cuts from this and it is convenient and portable, but it isn&#x27;t as effective as a regular razor.  I would recommend the Panasonic ES2207P Close Curves Wet/Dry Ladies Shaver. It isn&#x27;t as small and cute, but it does a great job.  My husband even uses it!  I have had it for over two years and I haven&#x27;t had any problems with it.</li>
    <li> What you need to know first is that this is a touchup device. It is not for shaving. The idea is that if you notice you&#x27;ve missed a spot, you can pull this little thing out of your purse and take care of it. If you can&#x27;t immediately think of a time and place you&#x27;d use it, you probably don&#x27;t need it. If you can, this could be a very easy solution for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The razor comes with a cap, so it looks like a long, thick tube of lipstick, and probably wouldn&#x27;t take up much space in your purse or bag. The head turns so you can use it horizontal or vertical. It takes a battery, and once you figure out how to open the battery compartment, it&#x27;s easy to get it working. (It comes with instructions, but they were pretty useless.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My main problems with this device:&lt;br /&gt;- It&#x27;s not very strong. That is, you can kind of clean up a spot, but it&#x27;s like a temporary can&#x27;t-do-better fix. (So really, if you&#x27;re taking it on a trip, you&#x27;d better have a real razor too.) It works ok on the legs. I tried the underarm, and couldn&#x27;t get it to work at all.&lt;br /&gt;- It doesn&#x27;t work at all without the battery (AAA). So if you are traveling, and don&#x27;t have a razor, you have an extra battery on you, right?&lt;br /&gt;- It only works dry. Supposedly (I read or heard somewhere) it works wet and dry, but good luck getting it to work in the shower. (It only really makes sense to use dry anyway, but it should do what it&#x27;s supposed to do.)&lt;br /&gt;- Expensive? It&#x27;s rather stylish, and if it worked just a bit better, I could see it being useful. But. A cheap disposable razor could do as much.&lt;br /&gt;- There is no place for the brush. I repeat, no place for the brush. It comes with a tiny, tiny, tiny little brush for cleaning the blade, and just leaving the thing on the counter I know it&#x27;s going to get lost. A design that allowed for the brush to stay with the razor would make more sense.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, as for many other reviewers here, this razor fails to impress me.</li>
    <li> After using this Panasonic shaver, I got rid of my electric razor!  I just love this--it works, it&#x27;s portable, and it&#x27;s  so cute!!!</li>
    <li> Sorry women. If you want a good body shaver, you are better off buying a men&#x27;s face shaver! This product&#x27;s blades simply aren&#x27;t sharp enough to leave a close shave that women want. The easy-to-change batteries are great, as is the ability to rinse under running water. Battery changing is easy. But none of these advantages make up for the fact that the product just doesn&#x27;t work well at shaving.</li>
    <li> This shaver is so lightweight and comes in its own carrying case which makes it really nice to take along anywhere I go.  It works great shaving the fine hairs on the back of my neck and the blade stays sharp.  To clean the shaver I simply brush the blade and shaving head with the brush that was included and turn the water faucet on and rinse the shaver off. Then I shake it really good, fold the head down, and put the carrying case top on.  This is a great little shaver for at home, travel, anywhere I want to go!</li>
    <li> I dont like the above Item. Does not do what they said. Very disappointed with purchase. Dont recommend it.  Wished I had returned it.</li>
    <li> I have coarse hair and this product didn&#x27;t work well for me.  It is definitely an attractive unit and it was a good thought to create a unit that could last a couple years with moderate use.  However, the reason it might last two years is that it just doesn&#x27;t provide a close shave.  I think it may work better for those with baby fine hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;1) No water required - If you are on the go and don&#x27;t have a sink or shower nearby, then you can whip out this little shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) No irritation - I&#x27;m very sensitive to shaving.  I usually have to use a shaving cream but the product indicates that for best results the shaver should be used on dry skin and moisturizers should not be used.  This razor does not irritate the skin.  However, as noted as a con below, I think this is because the closeness of the shave is pretty bad.  The head just doesn&#x27;t get close enough to irritate the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3) Attractive package - If you had this shaver in a purse, it wouldn&#x27;t be immediately obvious what the shell of the unit held.  The unit is sleek and attractive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;1) Does not provide a close shave:  This shaver left a lot of stubble.  I was disappointed with the closeness of the shave.  I would only turn to this device as a last resort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) Touch up shaver only - If you were hoping to take this on a long trip and use this as a substitute for a regular shaver, you may not be too happy.  I&#x27;d definitely test it out before throwing it in the suit case in place of your regular shaver. It lacks power, a close cut, and doesn&#x27;t do a great job on certain hair types.  I would never use this device to shave all of my legs -- only areas like the ankles where people won&#x27;t be looking closely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3) One blade and the product is done - If for some reason you fall in love with this product, there is no ability to purchase additional blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4) Not for all hair types: I have coarse hair.  This device was useless on armpit hair; I couldn&#x27;t get it to remove any hair there. The shaver didn&#x27;t do a great job in the bikini area.  On legs, it is somewhat useful, but as noted, there is still stubble.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other notes:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) According to product packaging, the blades are can last up to two years depending on frequency of use and hair type.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) Batteries are not included with the product.  It requires one AAA battery.  The manual estimates that one battery will provide one month of use when the product is used twice a week for five minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have baby fine hair, this product may be useful.  Certainly, it is always nice to have an emergency shaver but the emergency shaver may be useless if you have coarse hair.  For me, this product was not a winner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Made in China.r; I couldn&#x27;t get it to remove any hair there. The shaver didn&#x27;t do a great job in the bikini area.

    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this Precision Body Shaver on areas I needed to touch up  (basically areas that I may have missed while shaving).  It does an okay job, but I find that I have to go over the area several times before the hair is truly removed. Also, this product feels *really* cheap and flimsy, so I don&#x27;t expect it to last long. I love the fact that it folds down - which makes it perfect for traveling - but again, since it seems so flimsy, I&#x27;m afraid it is going to break sometime soon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think [[ASIN:B00141DEAC Cleancut PS335 T-Shape Personal Shaver]] is a better product for your money.</li>
