    <li> This is the best nailcolor I have ever purchased (and I have upwards of 100).  Essie really nailed it on this one. The color is bright and vibrant but not neon.  This is a one or two coater at most, and it dries quickly and with a shiny finish (although I always use a top coat as well, out the door is my favorite). Perfect summer polish, I can&#x27;t recommend it enough!</li>
    <li> This is a gorgeous deep coral tone that is perfect for summertime.  I like it on hands &amp; feet and think it will be one of my go-to color&#x27;s this year!  It&#x27;s very opaque and only takes one to two coats to look perfect.</li>
    <li> I was told by my nail tech that the Essie brand of nail polish is much kinder to natural nails. I had naturally long and strong nails, don&#x27;t hit me. Actually it can be a curse as they grow super quick. I love the Essie brand of polish, it stays on well and does not discolor my nails! Bonus****the seller I purchased it from on here is awesome ;)</li>
    <li> It is a beautiful, bright orangy-pink that is great for summer! It isn&#x27;t as much as a coral color as I expected, but I&#x27;m happy about it! New favorite color!</li>
    <li> Found this nail polish so much cheaper than in the retail stores so I had to take a chance.  It is a great color. You can not go wrong with Essie.</li>
    <li> I love this nail polish! The color is great! I will purchase this product again when I use all of mine!</li>
    <li> What I received is NOT the color in picture - mine is a bright pink and not at all what I wanted. This seller is clearly not sending out the actual product - don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> When this polish came, my 1st thought was that it reminded me of the poppies in my grandma&#x27;s garden. I love it!! It is bright without being too bright, and it is a warm red that I think would work for any skin tone. Every time I wear it, it draws compliments. I&#x27;ve worn this polish more than any other one this summer, and is currently on my toes right now. :) It&#x27;s very opaque too! I can totally get away with one coat, which is awesome when I&#x27;m in a hurry. I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I loved this nail polish! The only thing I didn&#x27;t like was that the some of the bristle brush are sticking out. Other than that everything was fine.</li>
    <li> Love the color. Thank you for fast shipping.</li>
    <li> I like this color.  It&#x27;s a good transition from winter to spring color.  It&#x27;s more red than I would have liked.  I was hoping for more of a coral.</li>
    <li> Love this color, wearing it right now. It&#x27;s like a dark red orange color. Great for summer.</li>
    <li> Come Here is lovely.  It is really similar to a couple other colors (like Ole Caliente) but it is a nice pinkish-red.  It is a great summer color and I use it more than most colors.</li>
    <li> This such a xute nail polish love it. Peachy/pink summer color great for summer. I recommend buying this best nail polish Essie</li>
    <li> Love the color!! Ideal for summer, looks great on toes also!!</li>
    <li> This is a must have!  I have received numerous compliments on this gorgeous shade!  The color goes on evenly and only requires 2 coats to look opaque.</li>
    <li> This is my first time wear Essie nail polish. The nail salon I go to have Essie products. I decided to try bec I didn&#x27;t have to pay $10 for a bottIe. I thought Essie was over rated. I must say I am very pleased with the quality and color selection. My nails are still shiny after a few days( I wear gloves for household chores). Come here is a lovely coral color. I get compliments. I luv looking at my nails and showing them off. Btw, I have stiletto nails. So the shape and color stands out.</li>
    <li> I love this color! It&#x27;s a perfect bright red-coral for summer. It definitely goes more on the red side than a pink or orange. Application is great as expected from Essie.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s JUST nail polish, right? That&#x27;s what I thought...but, everyone seemed to make a big fuss over the Essie brand, so I figured I&#x27;d give it a shot. The color is beautiful...I love, love, love the color...I really do. However, the application of this stuff is TERRIBLE. It&#x27;s CLUMPY as can be. I&#x27;m a nail-polish obsessive, so, I love nail-polish 95% of the time...but I tried applying this stuff about 4 times, and had to remove with nail polish remover each time because it was so clumpy. Tried shaking it to death, even tried the ol&#x27; putting-a-little-nail-polish-remover in it to thin it out and hopefully make it less clumpy, but nope. If I&#x27;m gonna pay mid-range for a nail polish, I&#x27;ll stick with OPI.</li>
    <li> Very pretty shade of a slightly pink coral. Used three coats and was streak free. Perfect for summer. Essie makes very high quality polishes.</li>
    <li> love this color. great addition and I am an Essie addict. it is the only polish I use- great quality. lasted my 2 weeks .</li>
    <li> I got this for a friend because the color just looked so bright and happy. She loved it and offered nothing but the best comments. I&#x27;ve seen it on her and expect to buy one for myself.</li>
    <li> Perfect color for spring/summer nails! The color is exactly as it looks in the picture. I love it and wear it all the time!</li>
