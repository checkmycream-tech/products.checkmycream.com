<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Sharp double edge blades. Not my favorite blade but in my rotation as they do give a good smooth shave. Hard to beat the price at 7.5 cents a piece. I get 3-4 good shaves from a blade.</li>
    <li> I have nothing to compare this to besides those cartrige style razor blades with 3 or 5 in one. For my first blades of this style I have no complaints. Sometimes I can get 3 shaves per blade, other times 7 or 8.</li>
    <li> Of all the inexpensive blades I&#x27;ve tried I like these the best. I can&#x27;t give them 5 stars because I like them but I don&#x27;t love them. I go through blades fast in my barber shop so I need something that isn&#x27;t too cheap to begin with. These seem to fit the bill. I break them in half to use in a shavette straight edge razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The company really should work on their packaging because you get 20 dispensers with 5 blades each rather than a box of blades.&lt;br /&gt;So with this order I will end up throwing away 40 plastic dispensers just to get 200 blades. This seems to be their only option.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I couldn&#x27;t believe how long it took for them to get here. It took 10 days to get these blades so if you need &#x27;em right away you might run out before you get &#x27;em.</li>
    <li> Of all the blades I have purchased, these are the ones that work for me. Very sharp but not overly. I can shave without tearing up my face as is with other forign blades. They hold up well. I can get well over two weeks shaving on one blade, shaving every other day. This 200 count should last well over five years. Can&#x27;t beat the price and quality of this blade. Delivery was very good and on time. Would highly recommend this blade.</li>
    <li> New to pleasures of shaving with safety razors just  this last month, I have tried Feather. CBS, Shark, and Derby.&lt;br /&gt;At this point, liked Feather best, but Derby also does the job, and at a&lt;br /&gt; great price.</li>
    <li> I was using Shark half blades and compared to those the Wilkinson Sword double razor blades, I love these. I even gave my barber a few packs and he and his partner LOVEE them. I feel like it cuts more smoothly and closer than both. Only con in my mind is that having to break them in half, otherwise they&#x27;re great!!&lt;br /&gt;These are PERFECT for trips and traveling because this box comes in blade packs.&lt;br /&gt;These are little more expensive but its only a few dollars and totally worth it because of the feeling of the blade.&lt;br /&gt;Let me know if you have questions.</li>
    <li> I bought this huge pack of blades for my husband after he received Derby blades with his Edwin Jagger razor and said he really liked them.  After all, buying in bulk saves a ton of money, and I didn&#x27;t have to worry about him running out and forgetting to tell me about it.    After my husband got used to wet shaving, I did buy my some Feather blades to try, but he likes Derby better.  The shave with the Derby blades are smooth and close, but not aggressive.  The only reason he gave these 4 stars is because he doesn&#x27;t have any other brand to compare these to besides Feather.  After he has the opportunity to compare these to other brands, I&#x27;ll upgrade the rating if these are still his favorite.</li>
    <li> I purchased this Item in March of 2014 the razors are great, I have thin facial hair so the blade was great at cutting them without issues. They are individually wrapped in 5 pieces per box and have a little storage for used razors. It&#x27;s been 9 months and I only used 2 boxes so I get about a month or so for each razor, you might get to last longer if you take care of it better than I do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely buy these again it&#x27;s a great product.</li>
    <li> Good for starter blades and/or general daily use. I really prefer Astra&#x27;s for a one pass, sharper shave. Then again, maybe I just got a dull batch.</li>
    <li> Love these blades I recently switched after over 25 years of being a Gillette person always buying the latest razor and the blades.  I got tired of the high prices almost $20 for just 4 blades.  These are awesome bought a high end safety razor and loving it :)</li>
    <li> Good blades, but don&#x27;t hold a sharp edge for more than a couple of uses each.</li>
    <li> These are really nice blades, and the price is unbeatable. I got a 5 pack included with my Edwin Jagger DE86bl razor, and they make a great combo. They give a very close comfortable shave with no irratation at all. The blades have a wax coating or something that leaves your face feeling very nice after the shave, and they are very forgiving of imperfect technique. That makes them good for the novice wetshaver, or the experienced guy who gets in a hurry sometimes. As with all razor/blade combinations, try a 5 pack before going all in as &amp;#34;your mileage may vary&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> Dollar shave club is a joke - this brings your average cost per shave to .017 cents.</li>
    <li> I have bought these blades before and not been disappointed.  The vender fulfilled all my expectations.  Keep up the good work!</li>
    <li> A decent midrange blade.  It is medium sharp but smooth.  Are there better blades out there ?  Yes.  But at this price this is a great buy.</li>
    <li> As a Barber I&#x27;ve never had a blade skip on me  These are very dissapointing.  I had a coworker try them same thing.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t make my mistake!</li>
    <li> Great blades if once preps before using them.  Good for about three uses max.</li>
    <li> These are the most comfortable blades I&#x27;ve found. Plus, they are extremely inexpensive, so I can use a new one each time I shave!</li>
    <li> Cut my face every time I used them and did not get a good shave either. Switched to Gilette and gave the Derby&#x27;s away to a coworker.</li>
    <li> Thought I would try these blades in my Edwin Jagger safety razor.  Very smooth, no pulling, no nicking, perfect for my De89 razor.  Very happy, lots better than the not-very-cheap-anymore disposable razors.  Very affordable price!  And I have blades for the next few years.</li>
    <li> the blades are easy to load and use, and the mini packs enclosed in the box are easy to store in a drawer or dopp kit.</li>
    <li> In my opinion, the best value and blade for DE razors.  Smooth shaves, sharp, no pulling or tugging.  For the money, extremely hard to beat.</li>
    <li> For the cost, Derby DE razor blades are excellent for my use.  There are better blades on the market, but they&#x27;re much more costly.  I only get 1-2 shaves per blade, but a blade costs less than 10 cents.  This works well for me.</li>
    <li> Derby Extra blades have always been my favourite. Not too sharp like Feather blades, and it cuts through all the necessary hairs. This 200 pack was hard to ignore. I never have to buy a refill pack for the next couple years.</li>
    <li> These are great razors</li>
    <li> Good sharpness, rare &amp;#34;dud&#x27; blade but overall a cheap and effective shaving solution.</li>
    <li> The price is great and they are really sharp</li>
    <li> I have used these blades for several years and I&#x27;m on my 3rd sleeve. They are very good blades, especially considering the price. Sure, you can find better, but you will pay more. I don&#x27;t have a heavy beard, so I can push these blades out to 7 shaves, although I usually change them out after 4 or 5 shaves. Rarely, I do get a blade that does not feel quite right. Flipping it over in the razor usually fixes it.</li>
    <li> so far so good. beats paying $$$ for the mach 3,4 etc. also has numbers on the blade so you can rotate.</li>
    <li> I have tried many types of blades since i recently started using a DE Razor.  These seem to treat me the best and they are the best deal I have found.  I have used Mercel, feather light, and a couple of other off brands.</li>
    <li> Works perfectly with the Merkur razors it&#x27;s awesome and for the price you don&#x27;t feel bad for changing it often</li>
    <li> The Derby&#x27;s are a very good value in blades. I have used them for years. I get about 3 to 4 days a blade from them,  yes that is not stellar,  but when the price is considered it turns quite easy on the pocket. Guys with milder beards will probably get more days. To sum up,  they are slightly above average blades at a very economical price.</li>
    <li> Kind of inconsistent sharpness.</li>
    <li> Having given up the disposables a while ago because they were getting ridiculously expensive, I switched to DE. I have tried sampler packs with about 10 different types of blades, so I&#x27;m familiar with most of the popular brands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While no one is the same, and I think it&#x27;s more trial and error until you find the right one for you, I find that the Derby&#x27;s are consistently sharp (for me), and are more forgiving than the Feathers, which are probably the sharpest blade ever. The Derby&#x27;s are smooth, don&#x27;t nick, and make shaving a pleasure again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price is certainly right, at 7½ cents each, compared to about $3 EACH for Gillette Cartridges. I know that Derby&#x27;s have been getting a loyal following, and I am pleased to add my name to that list.</li>
    <li> I have just switched from multi-blade razors, and was approaching the transition with some trepidation...but these Derby blades made the transition...what else...smooth as silk. As a newcomer to the DE world, I noticed that if I found a week-old blade feeling a tad rough, the tightening of the razor handle made it smooth (...as silk!) again. They easily last me two weeks, and that comes to about half a cent per day compared to the multi-blades&#x27; dollar a day. I plan to add the savings to my 401K. I am not going back to Gillette proglide!</li>
    <li> I admit, these Derby blades are not the absolute best you can find, but at the price, you cannot argue with the high quality of shave you will get!  These are my daily or near daily blades, and I save the more expensive blades like the Feather brand for more special occasions.  At less than a dime per blade, you could afford to throw them away after each shave, and even with a pretty coarse beard, I get several good shaves per blade.  I keep quite a stock of these myself.</li>
    <li> I got to try these blades when I received my Edwin Jagger 89lbl safety razor.  Even though they are not the sharpest blades around, they do an excellent job.  I especially like how forgiving they are and despite that they provide an excellent shave.  At $15 for 200 blades you can&#x27;t go wrong!</li>
    <li> these are sharp cheap and readily available here on amazon. come on for 0.08 a blade might as well use a new blade every time. but definitely you can get 3-4 shaves/blade.</li>
    <li> Great blades at a great price.</li>
    <li> These are the type of blades that come with my razor originally and they have been spectacular. I ordered what will be a 3 year supply for less than 5 cartridges for my old razor! Arrived very quickly too!</li>
    <li> Derby blades are a good mid-range blade.  There are slightly better blades out there but they all cost at least 2 to 3 times the price per blade of the Derby.  I can get a week of shaving out of a Derby blade, which averages out to a whopping 4 to 5 cents per blade!  The shave is always consistent and close and I have yet to experience a nick or cut with a Derby blade.</li>
    <li> Safety razors are a great cost saving razor, as cartridge system replacements are very expensive.  I won&#x27;t have to buy replacements for ages with this purchase...</li>
    <li> What is good is that you get a real good supply of these razors and for a good price.  Saves you money and you get a good product.</li>
    <li> Blades are great. I had almost forgot what it was like to shave with these blades. Will definitely save a lot of money.</li>
    <li> I bought these blades because of the reviews said, plus I could save money on shaving.&lt;br /&gt;Sharp enough to shave close with only a couple nicks. I think they&#x27;re great.&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t even noticed I nicked myself til later.</li>
    <li> How can you go wrong with these? Well I suppose if Derby&#x27;s don&#x27;t work for your face, but they work for me and the price per shave is hard to beat. For the price of 3 cartridge razors you get more than a year&#x27;s supply of razors. And you get a closer shave too!</li>
    <li> I am new to safety razor shaving, like a few weeks. But have been shaving for 30 years. I tried a sample pack from Amazon (Wilkonson Sword, Feather and Derby). Had a few nicks with the Feather, they are reviewed as the sharpest out there. Didn&#x27;t get a chance to try the Wilkinson&#x27;s yet, I was sold on Derby first time using them. Reviewers said they were forgiving and they are. I shave both with the grain and against the grain, even on my neck and no nicks or irritation at all with the Derby, very forgiving. I ordered 200 for $15 on Amazon and that should last me 5 years. Safety razor shaving sure is a money saver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: I have been using these Derby blades for a month and love them. Always a great shave and VERY forgiving. I have been getting 6-7 days out of one side of the blade for a total of 2 weeks for a single blade. I ordered 200 blades so I&#x27;m looking at like 4 years or so without having to spend anymore $$ on blades.</li>
    <li> While I have not sampled a wide variety of the double edge safety razors available through Amazon; I will say that of those I have used, these blades have been the most consistent and satisfying blades I have used. Combined with the Taylor of old bond street eton college creme, makes for a wonderful shave and lightens the day ahead.</li>
    <li> Cuts very well! I&#x27;m still on my first blade, but I don&#x27;t shave daily. My beard is pretty thick, and I used one of these blades to cut it off after about 1 inch of growth. I would recommend using a shave soap with some aloe, or something natural, because using this with Gillette blue gel doesn&#x27;t feel too great on my skin afterwards. I imagine this 200 count will last somewhere around 4 years of shaves, which is spectacular. Just be careful, they are very sharp.</li>
    <li> Very good for the price.&lt;br /&gt;Not the sharpest but still delivers a smooth shave.&lt;br /&gt;I would go for Astra over these for the same price.&lt;br /&gt;Described as the &amp;#34;chevy&amp;#34; of blades.</li>
    <li> Tried many different blades in sampler pack and the Derby was my favorite.  Gives me an incredibly close shave and especially with no nicks.  I am very pleased.  I stocked up on the 200 pack which should last me over two years.  No reason to try different blades I am sold.</li>
    <li> When I first got into wet shaving, I purchased an Edwin Jagger DE89 and it came with a Derby Extra RB and I LOVED IT. My first shave was the best smoothest shave ever thanks to this combination. But now,I don&#x27;t know if its my pre prep that&#x27;s gone south or my technique but I have never had it as good as the first (isn&#x27;t that the common cliche). I read a similar post expressing the same concern (i think it was for the 100 count). It doesn&#x27;t make sense to me... how could an over use of a certain metal to your face suddenly lose its touch of smooth flawlessness?! I&#x27;m not gonna give up on these yet... I can&#x27;t, I still have 185 blades left!</li>
    <li> This was a bargain buy. 5 cents a piece? Incredible.&lt;br /&gt;I get a great shave for pennies on the dollar.&lt;br /&gt;If you use a DE safety razor but don&#x27;t want to pay 50 cents a blade, go with Derby.</li>
    <li> I switched from all the current trendy razors to a traditional using single blades and have started saving a lot of money.  I get just as good a shave as I did with the triple and double blades I was using before.  I normally switch blades about 8-10 days and I shave each day.</li>
    <li> For me these blades work, but they re not my favorite.  I eventually sold off the bulk of them after I found a few other blades that worked better.  I recommend getting the 5 blade packs in a sampler set to experiment for a while to find what works best for your skin and razor before you buy in bulk.  Check out Maggard Razors for the samplers.</li>
    <li> The second closest shave at 1/10th to 1/7th the price of Feather Razors. I might keep some Feathers around for that difficult shave after skipping a couple days, but these Derby are excellent for the every day.</li>
    <li> There are 1 or 2 blades per 5pack that have burrs on them and make shaving very uncomfortable. When the blade is good, the shave is great. I would have given 5 stars but my wife and I have experienced too many bad blades with these.</li>
    <li> Only Feather blades are sharper, but those are extremely sharp.  These blades are for beginners/intermidiates DE (double edge) shavers.The packaging take older used blades for safe storage. Swedish steel from Turkey!  The Japanese Feather&#x27;s are the best for me so far.  I still like and use a fresh Derby blade for a close clean shave!</li>
    <li> I have been shaving with a safety razor for about a year and half and have tried several different brands. Feather brand blades are rated highly and I wanted to like them.  After several tries with the Feather blades and other top rated brands I keep going back to the Derby blades. They are very forgiving and give a great shave. Sure beats $45.00 cartridge blades.</li>
    <li> Great beginner blade. That said, I have moved on to feathers, as I want more sharp!</li>
    <li> Best deal I&#x27;ve found. Cut perfectly.</li>
    <li> These are my go to every day blades.  Sharp enough to get the job done without slicing you up.  The small sealed 5 packs are nice for travel.</li>
    <li> Can last you a full year basically and for $0.08 a blade really great deal</li>
    <li> Great price for 200 razors will last me a lifetime!</li>
    <li> These work great in my DE safety razor that I use when I&#x27;m in a hurry and get a good shave with them.</li>
    <li> Derbeys are good to line up someone 1,2,3 shaving dorco feathers it all depends i shave customers with derbeys its all about what shaving gel or cream you have i have ezblade so shaving always been really good on clients</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had these for months now and I have only used about two of the cartridges. This thing is going to last me forever!!! My face is very sensitive and my facial hair is very thick and coarse but these blades can tackle it, no problem! If you are good with safety razors I recommend these blades. Effective and economical as well. I&#x27;ve already pocketed about three times the amount I spent on this order and as stated above, I&#x27;ve got a whole lot more to go!</li>
    <li> I actually received a five pack with the razor I bought. It came with one Merkur and five Derby&#x27;s. It took a month to eventually use the Merkur and it was still good when I replaced it just to try these critters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I cannot tell much difference. However I had to remember in what position I placed the Merkur in the razor. The Derby has numbers on each corner of each side of the blade to help me remember how it is placed in the razor. The packaging allows for more than one blade to be dispensed at a time. I save the original wrapping for disposal as I have curious cats.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I guess I am not sensitive enough to tell a difference in the blades. I can tell without a doubt that double edge safety blades outperform cartridges. It looks like it is going to be about a while before I can really compare blades so I bought some other brands based on recommendations. However if I was on a desert island these blades would be just fine.</li>
    <li> Good moderate sharpness blade. Feathers are too sharp for me, and a bunch of the bottom barrel cheapos aren&#x27;t sharp enough. These do me well, as do Israeli Personnas.</li>
    <li> I have been using these in my Edwin Jagger razor for over a year. They were what I liked the best from some sampler packs. Last long enough and give a great shave and the price is great! What more can you ask for.</li>
    <li> Nice and sharp, I can get 5 shaves out of them easily. Probably more, but I change every Monday, don&#x27;t shave the weekends. So 200 weeks of shaving. take that Dollar club!</li>
    <li> I love these derby extra blades.  I also love astra and crystal &amp;#34; Israeli reds&amp;#34;  I use Testo shave soap for a smoothe gliding shave.  I wet my face with hot water.  Perfecto badger brush , lather up and shave.  Very very smoothe !!!!</li>
    <li> plenty sharp, numbered sides help in when to change blades.</li>
    <li> I do get multiple shaves from one blade and for the cost, even if you could not get more than one shave, they are worth buying. I do prefer another brand over Derbys, but...</li>
    <li> Best value on Amazon so far. 200 great razor blades for just a few bucks. If you use a DE razor, these are great.....</li>
    <li> Worst blade ever! Cut my husband&#x27;s face so bad with the first blade out of the package. But Amazon, great as ever, refunding me in full. Thanks Amazon.</li>
    <li> I have been using these razors for appox five years, I love them. These are plenty sharp for me. I get usually four shavings out of each blade, but that&#x27;s individual tast I&#x27;d say. There real quality blades.</li>
    <li> This blade cuts great but it&#x27;s personal preference&lt;br /&gt;I get a great shave with these blades two good one per blade , depends on the thickness of&lt;br /&gt;Your beard if it thin more I personally don&#x27;t like more than two I don&#x27;t want dull nicks cuts for the price can&#x27;t beat it with ten sticks....lol</li>
    <li> I purchased a sampler pack of razor blades, and was so happy with this brand. Upon looking up the price for a bulk quantity of these razors, I was even more surprised to find that the price is one of the best on the internet! What a pleasant surprise!</li>
    <li> Just like it says on the box.</li>
    <li> Quality control has bit the dust, used to eat a good blade, they only last one shave now on light blonde skinned beard.  I would not waste your time, their are better blades that last me 7 days before changing.</li>
    <li> While not as sharp or consistent as the Feathers, these are great razor blades for razors that you don&#x27;t want to use a Feather in. All razors have their own shaving characteristics, and sometimes the super sharp Feather is just too much. The Derby&#x27;s provide a comfortable, clean shave without the &amp;#34;bite&amp;#34; that some of the other blades have. Why did I give them 4 stars? Well, I&#x27;ve found that maybe 1 or 2 blades in 20 have too much bite or tug somehow. Not that they&#x27;ll tear your face up or anything, just not as comfortable. But when you consider how great these shave, coupled with a cost of under 10 cents a blade, you just can&#x27;t lose.</li>
    <li> Bought the big box cause these are my favorites. I went through several sampler packs before I decided on these. They hold their edge for up to two weeks with daily shaving. So with the price for the quantity, I&#x27;m set for awhile, and saved a small fortune compared to multi bladed razors. I would recommend trying a few samplers till you find what you like, but you really can&#x27;t go wrong with these</li>
    <li> Got a sampler pack with most of the top brands of blades. I tried them all except for Astra and Derby and was not loving any of them. I tried the Astra blades next and loved it, so I ordered a box of 100 Astra blades. Later I tried the Derby blades, and wow they gave a better shave than the Astra blades, and I didn&#x27;t think that could happen! I ordered this pack of 200 Derby blades and it was even a better deal than the Astra blades. I love the Derby blades and I am very happy with my purchase!</li>
    <li> After trying several blades of different manufacture through sampler packs, I have found that Derby Extra Double Razor Blades are the ones that work the best for me with the safety razors I use. One blade lasts a week which I think is outstanding. I utilize a Parker butterfly open safety razor as well as my mainstay Merkur two piece safety razor. both of which perform splendidly with the Derby Extra blades.</li>
    <li> Burned and pulled skin. Not at all for sensitive skin</li>
    <li> These are great blades. One technique i figured out is &amp;#34;go by the numbers&amp;#34;. When you put the blades on, start with positioning 1 on the safety razor and use it the first day, then rotate it to 2, then flip it to 3, then 4. This will give you 4x the life of one razor. And they are just the right amount of sharpness.</li>
    <li> A great mild blade for those with sensitive skin . Got a pack of 5 with my EJ DE 89 and have stayed with them . The Gillette 7 o&#x27;clock s are great as well for those sensitive skin DE wet shavers .</li>
    <li> Perfect for the safety razor I just purchased and I love that they are broken down into bundles of 5 blades.  Makes it so easy to travel with them!</li>
    <li> These blades work, but I should have shopped around. I really liked the Feather blades that shipped with my safety razor, but I hastily ordered these at the same time. Buy a variety pack of different brands, it&#x27;s worth knowing.</li>
    <li> These blades are very forgiving because they aren&#x27;t the sharpest DE blades out there. These are the blades I started with and I still use them in my rotation. They are very smooth, which is what I like. I don&#x27;t really need a super sharp blade. The best part of these blades is that they are so cheap! If you don&#x27;t need a sharp blade these may be the best value for you. If you need something sharper try Personna, Astra, or Feather (sharpest).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please note that everyone&#x27;s skin and hair is different so what may work for me may not work for you. Try out some other blades to find your best fit. I am rating this blade on its quality and value, which is 5 stars, its performance is dependent on the person and many other factors.</li>
    <li> Great razor blade! For me, they&#x27;re a single use just cause I&#x27;m afraid of using a used blade and hacking my face to bits.  Damn good price on a damn good blade!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Derby Extra double edged razor blades for about 5-6 years now, since first discovering safety razors. I tried a variety of other brands, but the Derby Extra consistently provide a smooth, comfortable shave when used with a good shaving soap/cream, although I find 2 passes are usually required (as is usually the case with safety razors).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The value is outstanding, 200 of any of the mainstream/heavily advertised cartridge razor blades would cost significantly more. Each blade will last 5-7 days which would be comparable to the cartridge razors.</li>
    <li> very nice. maybe could last longer but for the money it&#x27;s no problem . great shave with my merkur short handle safety razor</li>
    <li> Great product and great price. Will buy again, but this purchase should last me a long time. Allot better than buying those overpriced disposable razors, plus give you a better shave once you get the hang of it.</li>
    <li> I picked these up in a sampler pack when I started out with a double edge. After cycling through some brands, these have been my favourites. They get the job done but are not quite as sharp as some other brands (i.e. feathers). What this means for me is that I can get a nice shave without being able to play connect the dots on my face when I&#x27;m done. As for the longevity, I find I get 2-3 good shaves out of a blade depending on how much I let my hair grow out in between.</li>
    <li> I switched over the double edge blades recently after many years with electric. I tried three highly recommended blades. My choice was Feather with Derby second and Wilkinson third. The Derby blades give close shaves on a light beard for the first two shaves. By the third shave the blade shows evidence of wear and if you tried it for four shaves, as I did, it is disappointing.</li>
    <li> I like Derby blades. For the price paid, they are an excellent bargain for me.</li>
    <li> They are good blades... Not the best and absolutely not the worst.... good blade for a very good price.</li>
    <li> a spanking good deal on razor blades - some folks don&#x27;t like these, but honestly, unless they&#x27;re totally blunt or corroded, you&#x27;ll still get a shave or two - and at this price, they&#x27;re one-offs for the tonsorials! however, here&#x27;s how to save *even more* money with these blades: when you put the blade in your razor, note the number printed on each side of each blade - start with 1, then with the next shave, use 2, then flip the blade and use 3, then 4 (obviously cleaning the blade between shaves) - you&#x27;ll get at least four decent shaves!</li>
    <li> I am a newly-converted DE shaver and Derby blades are the only ones that I have used. They are very smooth and have been great for this newbie. I only wish the packaging  had a blade disposal slot on each set of razors, but it wasn&#x27;t that big of a deal to come up with my own disposal solution.</li>
    <li> Great product! Great price! Fast shipping!</li>
    <li> If you are tired of the cost of razor blades. Get an old safety razor at an antique shop... clean it up, get these blades and I think you&#x27;ll love the difference. It&#x27;s the closest shave I&#x27;ve had in my adult life. There are better and more expensive blades but for the cost these are the best bang for your buck. I use a blade a week... some times two... so these will last me for a long while.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Derby Extra Double Razor Blades for years.  I use them in a safety razor to shave down calluses on my feet.  These razor blades are very sharp, and they&#x27;re packaged so that there&#x27;s very minimal risk of cutting yourself.  I&#x27;ve never cut myself while unwrapping the blades.  Buying a package of 200 razor blades, wasn&#x27;t much more expensive than a package of 100, so this was a great deal.  I&#x27;d recommend these for anyone who needs double sided razor blades.</li>
    <li> Great product! The blades are numbers 1 - 4 so you can use 1 edge per-shave. That&#x27;s $.02 a shave. You can&#x27;t beat that!</li>
    <li> Just right for medium beards, just use plenty of water to avoid burn/ nicks.Not as sharp as feather, sharper than trig.</li>
    <li> Derby is one of my most favorite blades.  I can shave about 4-5 times with one of these blades, and I have a coarse beard.  Use a good shaving soap to minimize skin irritation.</li>
    <li> Very nice blades.  Not too aggressive but close enough for a beginner.  I will repurchase when the time comes (about a 2 year supply).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;update:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just tried Astra SP.  Definitely a step up from Derbys.  If you want a sharper blade, and a smoother shave, go with Astras.  Still, I do not regret the Derbys.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jagger DE89&lt;br /&gt;Plisson Synthetic Brush (face lather)&lt;br /&gt;Art of Shaving pre-shave oil&lt;br /&gt;Razorocks/Jagger/Proraso/Cade/C&amp;E/ArtofShaving soaps and creams&lt;br /&gt;Artofshaving/Nivea/Neutrogena/cade post shave</li>
    <li> I have been using these blades for about two years.  I got really tired of paying two or three dollars per blade for the brand-name multi-edge cartridges, so I switched back to a safety razor.  The price I&#x27;m paying for these blades, I could use a new one every day and not come anywhere near the expense of the cartridges!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The blades are well-oiled and individually wrapped, so there is no danger of corrosion during long-term storage.  They are sharp and consistent, and deal very well with my tougher-than-average beard.  Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been shaving with a safety razor for about two years now. I&#x27;ve tried Wilkinsons, Personas, Feathers, and a few other blades but keep coming back to Derby Extras. I get the best shave with these in my 1950s butterfly-style Gillette and they&#x27;re super affordable. I get 4-5 good full-face shaves with each blade on a medium coarse beard. Even after a week or two without shaving I can get a clean shave in 2-3 passes without irritation.</li>
    <li> Very pleased with purchase. Won&#x27;t have to buy blades for years:)</li>
    <li> This is the stuff of close shaves without the burn.</li>
    <li> After buying a sample pack of many different brands and styles of blades, I ended up choosing this blade as my favorite. After years of buying &amp;#34;supersonic&amp;#34; blades, I can&#x27;t believe how good and low cost these blades are! Never again will I waste money on gimmicky multi-blades again.</li>
    <li> Good price and quality</li>
    <li> Bought through recommendations and was not disappointed. Close shave for 3 shaves. Not too aggressive and the price was right.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t let the low price worry you.  These blades are better than your drugstore brands and can keep up with the pricer ones (feather) too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great blade.&lt;br /&gt;Awesome value.&lt;br /&gt;Cant go wrong with theses!</li>
    <li> Great deal, can&#x27;t beat the price. I change mine after two shaves (which is more often than maybe I should), but that still leaves 400 shaves per order.</li>
    <li> Bought these after receiving a pack with my safety razor! High quality blades and the price was to good to pass up on!</li>
    <li> These double edged blades are great for use in a double edged razor, they&#x27;re quite sharp, last a long time, and every pack of five individually wrapped blades comes with a &#x27;blade bank&#x27; for proper disposal without worry.&lt;br /&gt;  This was an incredibly cheap price, and if you find out these blades are a good combination for your facial / body hair (YMMV, not everyone&#x27;s hair is the same) you absolutely cannot beat the price. I have incredibly tough facial hair, and these work very well with it. I will not be needing to buy new blades for quite a while.&lt;br /&gt;  If you&#x27;re not sure how they will work for you, you may be better served buying a blade sampler till you find the particular blade that shaves best / injures least for you, but for my money, it was a great value, and well worth it.</li>
    <li> I have a tough beard but these blades seem to suit it.  I tried Astra&#x27;s before these but I was always wishing for a new blade on the 3rd day of use.  The Derby&#x27;s are consistently lasting for 5 days and give me a nice shave with very few nicks and no rash.  Another plus is that these are a real bargain in the 200 count size.</li>
    <li> 200 fantastic blades for $15!&lt;br /&gt;Need I say more?</li>
    <li> Double blades are cheap, but these are next level cheap!</li>
    <li> wasn&#x27;t sure about these blades at first but they have been great . Also has to do with beard prep., soap and cream, and technique. the price is insane. I stocked up on 700 of them. I HAVE ENOUGH BLADES FOR TEN YEARS OR MORE !</li>
    <li> These are the cheapest bulk razors money can buy, but they don&#x27;t perform like the cheapest. They are actually good blades. They&#x27;re not the sharpest I&#x27;ve used, nor the smoothest, they don&#x27;t even last the longest either...but they don&#x27;t perform poorly in those categories either.&lt;br /&gt;Derby&#x27;s for me, work very nicely. I can get 3 shaves out of a blade comfortably, and sometimes more. I could stretch the blade to last longer, but at this price, why bother? Because they are so inexpensive, you can toss one out after a couple of shaves and not feel guilty about it.&lt;br /&gt;Everybody has a different experience with razors, but they work well for me, and the price can&#x27;t be beat.&lt;br /&gt;I bought this 200 count so that I could give them to some friends and family to try out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This order came as 2 boxes, containing 20 smaller individually wrapped blade boxes of 5 blades each. Each blade is neatly wrapped in wax paper, and each small box of 5 has it&#x27;s own disposable blade bank.</li>
    <li> I have been DS shaving for about 6 months now, and found these are the blades that work best for me.  I was ordering 5-packs of various blades from a few different sources on the internet, but then found these, 200 blades, cheaper than what the other guy was selling a 100 pack for.</li>
    <li> After 2 years of shaving, I was running out of these guys after giving my dad maybe a 50 count of these the last time I bought an 100 pack. I went to a mall&#x27;s Art of Shaving and saw they were selling Merkur safety blades at $14 per 8 count.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOPE. NOPE. NOPE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These were the biggest pack I found on Amazon. I paid $15 for 200, and used Subscribe and Save ($12.75 after promotions and having 5 subscribe and save products), quite a big savings from Art of Shaving. The packs I got were from Turkey, and seem to be even sharper than my older Derby blades based on the number of times I get cut on the first use of a new blade (and I&#x27;m going real slow and soft!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I shave ~3x/week (MWF), and go through one blade once every 2 weeks. Going to be about 8 years before I run out.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m about 3 dozen blades in to this 200 pack and the only bad thing I can say about them is that they&#x27;re not Feathers or Merkurs. For the money you will not find a better blade. Anything better and you&#x27;ll have to pay more. They&#x27;re not as sharp, don&#x27;t last as long, and aren&#x27;t as expensive as the Feathers and Merkurs but they do just fine. I use mine in a vintage gillette slim adjustable and they do well.    I calculated the cost per blade at seven and a half cents per blade for these. I think the cheapest I found Feathers on here was 25-30 cents a piece. When you consider how much Mach III blades cost that&#x27;s really not any money at all. Highly recommend these if you want to stock up and don&#x27;t need the best shave ever.     I find myself wanting a pack of Feathers lying around for when I want a really close shave without making an extra pass. With these I can get a really nice shave but my skin gets a little irritated when I shave against the grain. The Feathers are just sharper so you don&#x27;t get that so much.    One thing to remember is that if you&#x27;re going to shave with a double-edge razor you should really be taking care of your skin. That is, if your complexion is bumpy because your skin is all dried out you don&#x27;t get a very comfortable shave. Drink lots of water, wash your face with a mild soap like Cetaphil face wash, and don&#x27;t eat a lot of trash. Your face will thank you for it. Also, don&#x27;t be afraid to splash on some witch hazel when you&#x27;re done and then a lightweight lotion.</li>
    <li> good blades but i prefer treet razor blades. inconsistent with edge quality. some are great and others pull and irritate. overall a good razor.</li>
    <li> I purchased 200 blades a year ago and have only used about 20% of them. The blades give me a week of good shaves so the cost per shave is pennies. My shave has been ever bit as close as with the previous products I used, maybe even better, but for substantially less cost. I enjoy shaving now, these blades give me a close shave, are easy to care for, and very cost effective.</li>
    <li> These worked great in my Shavette razor for a first timer. Also work great in the double edge razors as well.&lt;br /&gt;Always trying new brands, but I am a Gillette guy through and through.</li>
    <li> They do not shave as close as liked and not very smooth.&lt;br /&gt;Was good price for  the product and it came quickly.</li>
    <li> Really good quality blades!!! :)</li>
    <li> Sweeeeettt shave!!! My face is smoother than a spanked baby&#x27;s butt. 200 of these blades will keep me styling for the next couple of years.</li>
    <li> When I first got into traditional wet shaving, these were the first blades I tried because they came with my Edwin Jagger de89L. I quickly started trying all the other brands of blades, soaps and razors, for isn&#x27;t that 1/2 the fun of this adventure? After acquiring nearly 12 brands of blades, I thought I would never return to Derby Extra due to shaper cutters and cult followings. Furthermore my shaving technique improved to where I am now able to get outstandingly smooth shaves with almost any blade or razor. Even though Astra Superior Stainless are my all-time favorite blade, stocking up on 700 blades at the moment, I thought I would revist my beginnings with Derby. Here&#x27;s my findings: I place them in the middle of the pack in terms of sharpness. They do tug slightly more. However, they gave an OUTSTANDING shave to my style of shaving, glassy smooth bbs. Here&#x27;s what I mean. My first pass is WTG, followed by 2-3 passes ATG. Because these blades are not the sharpest out there, like a Feather, I can hit ATG with buffing until my face is as smooth as glass without irritation or weepers, especially on my neck where it&#x27;s the most sensitive to over shaving. I liked them so much that I just bought 200 Derby Extra blades to add to my Astra stash. Remember, shaper isn&#x27;t always better; it&#x27;s more about how you shave than what you shave with.</li>
    <li> 200 for 15 bucks?! Can&#x27;t beat that price with a stick! sharp but forgiving!</li>
    <li> Great blade, great value. Has the perfect box to put the old blades in the back. Highly recommend, I like feather also</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good deal. The blades aren&#x27;t overly sharp but they do a decent enough job. They are pretty good about rust resistance. The packaging is easy to manage in the shower, the blades are individually wrapped in wax paper. I&#x27;ve into my second 200 blade pack.</li>
    <li> I think I will have blades for this lifetime and maybe into the next lifetime. All around good blades for safety razors</li>
    <li> These are plenty sharp for me, but still a very smooth shave ... and cheap!  I use them in my 1962 Gillette Slim on setting 6, and in my Parker SE1 (snapped in half).  They don&#x27;t give me nicks or razor burn.  I shave daily and change these blades weekly.</li>
    <li> Not as sharp as Feather blades, but they hold their edge much longer. Great for daily shaves, but I still use the Feathers for occasions that require a really smooth shave.</li>
    <li> These were the very first blades I purchased as a new safety razor user, and they didn&#x27;t disappoint.  Very very forgiving right out of the chute.  Over the first month, I had One or two very minor nicks that were barely noticeable.  I use them for two very comfortable two-pass shaves and then toss them.  I&#x27;m sure I could get more shaves, but at .09 per blade, why chance it??</li>
    <li> Sharp, but not so sharp my face bleeds. My favorite blades.</li>
    <li> so cheap I use a fresh blade for each shave. You can buy sharper blades if needed, but these work fine for me.</li>
    <li> These blades aren&#x27;t that sharp.  I have to apply a lot more pressure than with blades like the Feathers.  However, they are WAY more forgiving.  Every mistake using Feather blades &#x3D; nick/cut.  Not so with the Derby&#x27;s.  You still get a decent shave, but it takes a bit more effort.</li>
    <li> Plenty of blades. You get two packages, they have that opening at the bottom so you can hang it up on your wall and keep taking out the blades...blades aren&#x27;t as good as feather, however, they are actually good quality blades. You can use them and throw them out more often than any other blade because they are cheap and keep using them at their sharpest.</li>
    <li> Update:  Second shave on the same blade was much better.. An i tried another blade and everything ok, maybe was my prep, angle don&#x27;t know but now im happy with these.</li>
    <li> These are great consistent blades.  The change from shave-to-shave is pretty subtle, and they are very smooth and not prone to razor burn at all in my experience.  I can get 3 or 4 shaves from them and the price is great.  My beard has dense and thin parts, and paired with a heavy razor like  Edwin Jagger DE89, it can work for all of it.</li>
    <li> Nice product, quick shipping thanks!</li>
    <li> I have tried Derbys, Feathers, Merkurs, Sharks and CVS brandless and I like them all but I am piling up on Derbys. Inexpensive and smooth.</li>
    <li> Switched to DE razors.  There was a learning curve, but once you learn not to kill your skin, it and you will both appreciate DE.  You&#x27;re wallet will also.  I only shave my neck as I wear a beard, beautiful one at that.  However, I would get a couple bumps and some in growns before.  At first, I cut myself quite a bit, but after I got the hang of it, I won&#x27;t go back.  No more in growns and bumps, and smoother.  I do 3 passes, 1 vertical, one outside to inside, and one more vertical.  Again, this is only my neck.</li>
    <li> Excellent blade for the price. Great daily blade.</li>
    <li> I like these blades just fine.  I&#x27;ve gone through a couple of packs and no issues.  If I do come across a bad blade I&#x27;ll replace it and modify this review, but for now, they are great.  I really think it is a matter of your face and your beard.  I don&#x27;t have a very thick beard, but I do have sensitive skin.  I prep very well, so maybe that is what has helped with these blades.  But, at $.075 per blade, this is a tough deal to beat.</li>
    <li> Good product, I would buy again.</li>
    <li> Yes, they&#x27;re a great deal, but if you haven&#x27;t tried several different brands, don&#x27;t go buying a hundred+ razors. Get a variety pack first. Some swear by Derbys, but they leave me irritated. I think it&#x27;s because they&#x27;re not sharp enough for me. Still, it&#x27;s better than shaving with a cartridge razor.</li>
    <li> These were my first blades I got when I started shaving with my Merkur 34C HD. I liked them at first, then they became really inconsistent. Every few blades would not feel the same. They felt dull and would yield consistent results. I thought it was just a learning curve with going from cartridge style shaving to DE style shaving, but then I saw another review online for Personna Lab blue razors. Tried those and there was a world of difference in quality of blade. More money, but worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These might be ok for you, I didn&#x27;t like them once compared to other blades.</li>
