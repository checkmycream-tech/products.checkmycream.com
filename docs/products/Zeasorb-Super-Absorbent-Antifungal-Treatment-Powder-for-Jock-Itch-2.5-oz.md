      <li>I shower and stay clean</li>
      <li>i can&#x27;t say enough good things about this powder.  </li>
      <li>A bold banner displaying &amp;#34;for Jock Itch&amp;#34;.  </li>
      <li>highly recommend it for light or very localized irritation - in cases of more severe infections, a physician should be consulted.</li>
      <li>the first thing they say every time.. &amp;#34;MMMMMM... Is that Zeasorb?&amp;#34;  You betcha!</li>
      <li>this is worth the price</li>
      <li>Cleared my problem right up.</li>
      <li>Not sure what more I can say about this kind of product.  </li>
      <li>Best powder for those tight spots that perspire and don&#x27;t get enough air.</li>
      <li>The good thing about the powder is the cost is much less.</li>
      <li>BTW, some snarky reviewer made fun of someone who couldn&#x27;t figure out how to open it -- you just pull the paper tab off the top.  </li>
      <li>Works just as well, nice small bottle that is easy to carry, and it keeps the itch away.  </li>
      <li>I like it very much.</li>

      <li>But this site charged me to much!</li>

      <li>After all this, making sure the area is completely dry, sprinkle on the powder.  </li>
      <li>This is a fine product, but never again will I make the mistake of paying extra for nothing.&lt;br /&gt;Ekay</li>
      <li>I had a yeast infection on skin under breast this powder worked fast</li>
      <li>but it was worth it to clear things up</li>
      <li>A combination of Antifungal Soap (Northwest) , drying out using a hair dryer, and Zeasorb is really working well to resolve the problem.</li>
      <li>For some reason, this product isn&#x27;t available in drug stores, so this seems the only place to get it.</li>
      <li>If this problem resurfaces, I can use this unique powder because it has something in it that also treats the external yeast.</li>
      <li>Dry and easy to use.</li>
      <li>Pretty much the only thing that works, keeps you dry and itch free!  </li>
      <li>It wasn&#x27;t clear to me the first time, either.</li>
      <li>I would highly recommend this product to anyone suffering from jock itch.</li>
      <li>As a female, I was having an issue with an external rash that the most powerful topical steroids wasn&#x27;t healing.</li>
      <li>Highly recomended</li>
      <li>I have found it effective not only by keeping the usually moist body areas dry, but also by suppressing  fungus in milder and more localized infestations.  </li>
      <li>and it doesn&#x27;t have any of the side effects that seriously powerful, prescription topical steroids cause.</li>
      <li>but I did not like the new packaging.  </li>
      <li>I live in Florida and I am always sweating because of the heat.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried different stuff but as a large guy I needed something to WORK!</li>
      <li>OMG after about five days of diligent cleaning and application of the Zeasorb, it&#x27;s completely cleared up!</li>
      <li>I have tried the other products containing the same ingredients but Zeasorb works better than all of them.  </li>
      <li>Please note that the Zeasorb antifungal foot powder is the exact same formula, and sometimes you can find it cheaper.</li>
      <li>(I wonder if she realizes how expensive it is) for a recurring fungal infection under my belly to try and absorb some of the excess moisture which forms and creates the perfect growing environment (heat, dark and moist).  </li>
      <li>I have used this and the yellow labeled Zeabsorb products, all work well, this product seems to clog the dispensing holes, a quick tap on the table and it is back in action.</li>
      <li>To early to tell if it will get rid of the jock itch</li>
      <li>The only real difference is the printing on the label.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Zeasorb is an excellent anti-fungal and anti-yeast product.  Many dermatologists tell their patients to use it.</li>
    <li> I purchased this powder to use under my old, not perky boobies. I was told by a nurse to use an antifungal powder.  This would help keep area  dry and no bacteria would have a chance.  It works, but so does baby powder with zinc.  I will try anything in this miserable summer heat and humidity.</li>
    <li> The product is great but I did not like the new packaging.  A bold banner displaying &amp;#34;for Jock Itch&amp;#34;.  Maybe so but that&#x27;s not what I use it for!!!!</li>
    <li> This has kept my itch under control for the last month. I plan to continue using it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a &#x27;candida&#x27; type yeast infection because it was recommended by a dermatologist.  It does great at practically wicking the moisture away.  The powder does not seem to &#x27;clump&#x27; like a lot of powders will do but I&#x27;m assuming that&#x27;s because it&#x27;s a different make up than things like baby powder.  (just an fyi: this powder is great on yeast type infections because the base of it being the anti-fungal whereas baby powder and other powders do not have the anti-fungal which actually causes the yeast to breed. I learned that the hard way!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, if you&#x27;re looking for an anti-fungal powder this is the best one I&#x27;ve found!!</li>
    <li> Works better than anything else. If you can only afford one product, make it this one.</li>
    <li> Good product well worth the money.</li>
    <li> Have been using it for years and works great</li>
    <li> This is a great product. Amazon.com is one of only a few sites where the powder can be found. It works for women as well as men even if the container only mentions men&#x27;s conditions.</li>
    <li> Perfect for Jock itch!  I was able to knock out a bad case of it with REPARA Antifungal Cream however this helped with maintaining the comfort throughout the day. With these two I have not had a recurrence in months!</li>
    <li> Stuff works well and is easy to use. I have bought it before and knew the product.  No more words.</li>
    <li> i could not hardly get it out of the little bottle the powder</li>
    <li> My dermatologist recommended this and it works as well as anything I&#x27;ve tried, including Rx.  It being powder rather than cream is a big plus, as is the low cost.  BTW, some snarky reviewer made fun of someone who couldn&#x27;t figure out how to open it -- you just pull the paper tab off the top.  It wasn&#x27;t clear to me the first time, either.</li>
    <li> Excellent product.. Last longer than the sprays but just as easy to use. I recently had a spat of jock itch and tried several different medications. The sprays where great but I was using an entire can every three or four days! Sprays, just like sunscreen sprays and other sprays are convenient but wasteful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the same ingredient, but in powder form! Been using my bottle for a week and a half and have 50% left.. Works just as well, nice small bottle that is easy to carry, and it keeps the itch away.  My jock it continued to heal and now I am just on my one week maintenance treatment so that it doesn&#x27;t return..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend this product! Works great and last a while!</li>
    <li> The Zeasorb powder which I order says for &amp;#34;jock itch&amp;#34; on the front.  I received the one for athletes foot.  This was not what I wanted but was told that I would have to contact the manufacture.</li>
    <li> Works great, no complaints.</li>
    <li> This works great. I&#x27;ve recently started to have some itching due to longer workouts. A combination of Antifungal Soap (Northwest) , drying out using a hair dryer, and Zeasorb is really working well to resolve the problem. I plan to switch to something like Monkey Butt soon.</li>
    <li> This is very good as a preventative for jock itch.  Put on after shower, after you dry off.  I use in combination with anti-fungal cream if I actually have jock itch/fungal rash.</li>
    <li> I have used this medicated powder for the treatment of occasional fungal irritations in the crotch area  for about 15 years following my doctor&#x27;s recommendation.  I have found it effective not only by keeping the usually moist body areas dry, but also by suppressing  fungus in milder and more localized infestations.  It is not effective in case of severe infestation,  in which case a special prescription strength ointment and a stricter regimen of application is necessary.&lt;br /&gt;Oftentimes, irritation can be caused by prolonged perspiration,  tight, more restrictive and binding clothing - without the presence of a fungus infection. In such situations, which my occur more frequently than the fungus type, Zeasorb does an excellent job. As always,  instructions and cautions  should be read and followed.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend it for light or very localized irritation - in cases of more severe infections, a physician should be consulted.</li>
    <li> It takes care of what I want it to take care it.  It is very effective.  I like it very much.</li>
    <li> Got this for my jock itch problem. It might be good as a preventative powder but when I applied it to an existing outbreak, it burned. Don&#x27;t think I will be buying more. Wish I knew why that happened.</li>
    <li> A useful and effective product</li>
    <li> My dermatologist prescribed this and it works. I am an active guy who walks a lot and takes yoga class four times a week. I tend to get jock-itch. With daily use, this keeps outbreaks down. During an outbreak I need a prescription med plus this. For some reason, this product isn&#x27;t available in drug stores, so this seems the only place to get it.</li>
    <li> This is all my husband uses. It is a little pricey but works wonders and keeps him dry all day</li>
    <li> Well, the ten or so guys who have reviewed this product are admitting having jock itch!  I find that amusing but that&#x27;s how it is.  Jock itch is tough to eradicate.  My physician all but told me that it is impossible to eliminate for most guys; all we can expect is to keep it under control.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish this worked better but the creams and sprays do better.  Powder is more comfortable, etc., but it just doesn&#x27;t do that much in the end.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In contrast with some of the other anti-fungal powders on the market that have little odor, this stuff has some moderate perfume in it that I don&#x27;t like.  When this runs out I&#x27;m moving on.</li>
    <li> I have been using it for years. It is a good product.</li>
    <li> It works. I use it very sparingly for other parts as well....</li>
    <li> I had been using Lotrimin AF on some athlete&#x27;s foot but failed to kill it completely. When this happens the fungus generally comes back stronger and resistant to the medication, so I needed to switch up the active ingredient. This works really well and keeps the area dry.</li>
    <li> I have ,in the past, used another Zeasorb product that went on as a lotion. It worked in 3 days had eradicated all problems. I figured that the powder would work as well. The good thing about the powder is the cost is much less. But,that is inconsequential&lt;br /&gt;if it doesn&#x27;t work. Will have to find the lotion if I have another flareup and bite the bullet and pay the price.</li>
    <li> Best stuff to prevent rashes especially when you are sweating</li>
    <li> best powder ever for any part of the body.. bought it for 82 yr old dad who is immobile... this powder keeps away everything.. rashes... bedsores... pimples... everything...anywhere.. i put this on my dad before diapering every single day and he hasnt had any issues ever since.  The one time that someone esle cleaned him and didnt use it he had a big rash ..it cleared up practically overnight once i cleaned and applied this powder.  We used to get a much more expensive powder in a white container with green writing on it and it was double the price and has the same active ingredient in it.  this is worth the price..works out best when i buy the 3 pack.  i can&#x27;t say enough good things about this powder.  its good for everyone.</li>
    <li> very good product/ good price prompt service</li>
    <li> Very tiny bottle. As far as the powder its a go0d one. But this site charged me to much!</li>
    <li> this  is the  better  power  I  bay  is cheap  in  here  is  working  very  good  for  every  thing</li>
    <li> This is good for folds of skin that tend to get damp and stay damp in hot, humid weather. It&#x27;s scratchier than cornstarch but somewhat more effective too. I also put it in my shoes after wearing them all day.</li>
    <li> Best powder for those tight spots that perspire and don&#x27;t get enough air. Please note that the Zeasorb antifungal foot powder is the exact same formula, and sometimes you can find it cheaper.</li>
    <li> I read a review from another customer. As a female, I was having an issue with an external rash that the most powerful topical steroids wasn&#x27;t healing. I tried this product and it honestly works great. The area was biopsied and showed yeast. The other reviewers testimony was terrific! If this problem resurfaces, I can use this unique powder because it has something in it that also treats the external yeast. It has literally been a life changer. I don&#x27;t know of any other product that works nearly as well and it doesn&#x27;t have any of the side effects that seriously powerful, prescription topical steroids cause.</li>
    <li> This worked but only in conjunction with a medicine that the doctor gave me for another skin issue.  The name of the other ointment is Desoxitomysone (sp).  This combo got rid of the problem in less than week after it was an issue for nearly a year. What a relief!</li>
    <li> Have used for quite a number of years. Very pleased with results</li>
    <li> This has become a staple product for our bathroom cupboard. It has provided relief from skin irritations due to heat. Thank you for your great service.</li>
    <li> Zeasorb treatment for JOCK ITCH (Amazon Price $9.17) is IDENTICAL to ZEASORB treatment for ATHLETE&#x27;S FOOT (Amazon price 2 for $11.18).  The only real difference is the printing on the label.  This is a fine product, but never again will I make the mistake of paying extra for nothing.&lt;br /&gt;Ekay</li>
    <li> I have used this and the yellow labeled Zeabsorb products, all work well, this product seems to clog the dispensing holes, a quick tap on the table and it is back in action.</li>
    <li> is a great product for any minor skin ailment and athletes foot prevention. It out performs the competition for the value.</li>
    <li> Works better than creams.</li>
    <li> Definitely helped.Cleared my problem right up.</li>
    <li> This product works great for people who perspire a lot.</li>
    <li> I had developed Intertrigo between my thigh/groin area and it was painful and resistant to treatment. As a temporary measure I resorted to using Triple Paste, but the messiness of that &amp;#34;solution&amp;#34; wasn&#x27;t a viable long-term strategy. And then I found this powder…OMG after about five days of diligent cleaning and application of the Zeasorb, it&#x27;s completely cleared up! And I had resigned myself to thinking that nothing would ever permanently work. I still use it preventatively and it&#x27;s a miracle worker!!!</li>
    <li> It is really absorbent and the best thing it is antifungal and you can use it in many different ways, you will be surprise, it is helping my son with skin problems due to his medical condition.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried different stuff but as a large guy I needed something to WORK! I shower and stay clean but I guess it&#x27;s something for overweight people. I was itching and burning so bad it was miserable and I found instant relief and have only used it a few times over the last 4 weeks as needed. It also didn&#x27;t change me colors like other products have made me darker down there, so I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Best thing on the market for jock itch treatment or prevention. Better than prescription meds! A little goes a long way. Super absorbent indeed!</li>
    <li> Did not have jock itch, but was having itchy feeling in groin areas, thought it to be an early symptom of jock itch or other fungal infection and got this product. With less than a week&#x27;s use everything was back to normal.</li>
    <li> Provided temporary relief for yeast infection. Dry and easy to use.</li>
    <li> Not a five star (a magical cure for jock itch would get that) but it gets a four star for keeping you dry and managing the situation if you know what I mean.</li>
    <li> I feel a little strange being the one to recommend this product, but heck, I did buy it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought it on recommendation from my son&#x27;s dermatologist.  My son&#x27;s in a wheelchair all day - so hence, the need to combat moisture accumulation in the groin area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The dermatologist said to wash the groin area, towel-dry, THEN use a hair dryer on a low setting (this was news to me). After all this, making sure the area is completely dry, sprinkle on the powder.  This is now my son&#x27;s daily regime.  And it works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, there you have it - advice, free of charge, from me and our dermatologist! :)</li>
    <li> Best stuff on the market. Also use it every time I get out of shower or dressed as a preventative. Tried all the rest and have not looked back in years.</li>
    <li> My dermatologist recommended and does the job.  Sprinkle daily once or twice and relieve the Itch.</li>
    <li> GREAT PRODUCT!!!!!  I Have a Horrible Foot Rash...and the Derm DOC Recommended this Powder for , feet, crotch n underarms...seems to help!  Thanx, n will be ordereing more soon!  PS,  I,m ?? exposed to Agent Orange per the VA!  So Will play b,ear!  thanx,OlSarge!</li>
    <li> I have been using this stuff for a couple years.  It allows me to go days without showering or changing my boxer shorts.  Girls love it!  When they get freaky with me  the first thing they say every time.. &amp;#34;MMMMMM... Is that Zeasorb?&amp;#34;  You betcha!</li>
    <li> Stops itch for about 12 hours only.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work for me at all ...I read that I can put listerine on my jock itch instead of this product it worked great my itch went away I recommend to buy this product after trying  Listerine I hope it helps</li>
    <li> I had a yeast infection on skin under breast this powder worked fast I applied it with cotton pad twice a day.</li>
    <li> For bike riders fighting jock itch, this is a God-send. Use it along with spraying bragg&#x27;s cider vinegar that is allowed to air dry.</li>
    <li> this stuff worked for me, when others did not,i used it as ordered, and very happy with results jock icth is no fun, it took a week and 1/2 but it was worth it to clear things up</li>
    <li> To early to tell if it will get rid of the jock itch but it is helping</li>
    <li> Pretty much the only thing that works, keeps you dry and itch free!  Highly recomended</li>
    <li> I tried different creams and powders, with little to no success, and this product eliminated the problem. I would highly recommend this product to anyone suffering from jock itch.</li>
    <li> I live in Florida and I am always sweating because of the heat.  This power keeps me dry and prevents heat rash.</li>
    <li> This is a waste of money. Gets clumpy.</li>
    <li> I have tried the other products containing the same ingredients but Zeasorb works better than all of them.  It keeps the area dry, coats the area well and solves the problem in a couple of weeks.  It really is the best for jock itch and athlete&#x27;s foot.  Will definitely continue buying.</li>
    <li> My Dermatologist recommended this for me (I wonder if she realizes how expensive it is) for a recurring fungal infection under my belly to try and absorb some of the excess moisture which forms and creates the perfect growing environment (heat, dark and moist).  It did not work for me; it clumped and made me itch (which it&#x27;s supposed to prevent) and really dried my skin out (not the desired conclusion I was hoping for).</li>
    <li> It worked, a little on the expensive side for how small it is but I honestly can&#x27;t put a price on comfort.  Not sure what more I can say about this kind of product.  Applied it straight out of the shower for a few days and all my problems were gone.</li>
    <li> Works better than gold bond.</li>
    <li> I have tried everything to help my son and this is the only product that worked.  He had constant itchy and pain.</li>
    <li> Great powder. Great price.</li>
