### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>They are perfectly shaped for my brows.</li>
      <li>These strips are awesome.</li>
      <li>The shaping is great.</li>
      <li>Great for saving money on salon costs.</li>
      <li>Then begin &amp; you will be happy with results.</li>
      <li>They are easy to apply and work great.</li>
      <li>Just make sure you follow the instructions on when to use them and when NOT to use them to give them a fair chance</li>
      <li>&#x27;s kind that has worked for me.  </li>
      <li>And yes, I know all the tricks to working with wax strips, I have been doing my own brows with wax for years.</li>
      <li>Rub your hands over the strips that you will use (to warm them up a bit)  3.</li>
      <li>Probably good for light haired women, but I tend to have tougher one in places that still need tweezing.</li>
      <li>I have to use so many of the strips to get my eyebrows how I want them and after that I have to plug them still...</li>
      <li>I hope that makes sense :)&lt;</li>
      <li>I buy them again and again now and love that I no longer am tweezing.  </li>
      <li>On each sheet there are 7 strips for the top of the brow and 7 for the bottom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I love these strips.  </li>
      <li>I LOVE IT.  </li>
      <li>but these are definitely my favorite.</li>
      <li>don&#x27;t have to wax more than every 3 weeks to a month</li>
      <li>so I don&#x27;t mind having to use so many strips;</li>
      <li>wth tweezers to make sure it&#x27;s all even.</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s understandable that anyone with wilder brows would probably not be in love with this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>While this, in of itself is easy, I figured the Surgi Wax brow shapers would be even easier.</li>
      <li>Using them is virtually painless, and the sizes of the strips make them easy to use.  </li>
      <li>The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it a 5 was that I would have liked it better if I could have cut the stuff for the shape of my own brow,  </li>
      <li>They give a nice arch but not a fake looking one.</li>
      <li>description claims they are shaped for most brow shapes, which is true they do have some curve to them.</li>
      <li>I typically buy mine from Sally Beauty supply and these are the best ones I have found.</li>
      <li>Clean your face with alcohol (I use 99%)  2.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Secondly, my eyebrow hair is pretty fine, so fine</li>
      <li>So finding wax strips that work well for me is pretty easy</li>
      <li>I was blessed with very blonde, very fine hair.</li>
      <li>Thanks!</li>
      <li>Woo HOO; not so much plucking!</li>
      <li>Tried this product several times and I wasn&#x27;t able to remove the hair..</li>
      <li>I just want to say that I like this product, it doesn&#x27;t get ALL the hair, but it is really helpful!</li>
      <li>I know this product does not work well for some, but this is the first product of it</li>
      <li>This product is nice because it&#x27;s not hot wax, it&#x27;s more like heavy duty transparent tape that sticks very well to the tiny hairs that come out quite easily with one quick pull of the tape.  </li>
      <li>(Nad&#x27;s works well for me also), until a company comes out with a decent pre-cut wax strip for brows.</li>
      <li>I bought mine from a local beauty supply store but they&#x27;re MUCH cheaper on amazon.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I prefer to go get them professionally done or buy another ones..</li>
      <li>First problem with the brow Shapers is the cut and shape of the strip, it is almost like an even, flat bell, with equal &amp;#34;tails&amp;#34; on each side.</li>
      <li>press and hard and all will be fine.</li>

<li> press and hard and all will be fine.</li>
<li> Nothing works well on oily or damp brow hairs, so clean and dry the area well before applying the strips, and shape them with a small pair of scissors and hold the brown out of the way while applying the strips and, Walla!  </li>
<li> I had little fine hairs that made my eyebrows look thick ...</li>
<li> upwards of 5-7 times as much on one waxing, when this will last at least 4 waxings at home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> they dont work hardly even sticky it took a whole sheet of redoing one sppot to get it all</li>
<li> Currently I have been using Sally Hansen wax strips for the face, and cutting them free hand into an arch shape.</li>
<li> One caution, always wash the area with soap and water and dry it well.  </li>
<li> You might have a few stubborn hairs left...</li>
<li> Takes only a few minutes, and I am done!</li>
<li> but you have to be very careful or you can cut youself up.i</li>
<li> Unfortunately due to the generic curve I had to use at least 6 strips to get my brows into the shape I like.</li>
<li> I could see these working well for thin brows and normal shaped eyebrows, they did not work for me, 2 sheets of strips later I still had to do 20 minutes of plucking, IF YOU HAVE THICK OR DARK EYEBROWS, DON&#x27;T WASTE 5$ ON THIS PRODUCT.</li>
<li> It may take a few strip to remove all the hair from an area of the brow</li>
<li> At least I didn&#x27;t do the multi-pack order.</li>
<li> I have to fill them in with powder, but this wax is so weak, it hardly removes anything!</li>
<li> horrible! removes hair just as much as scotch tape...</li>
<li> If you rush it, you may be one of the unhappy reviewers.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This is the only brand I buy for eyebrows. The shaping is great. They can be placed to give you just about any shape you want.</li>
    <li> I was blessed with very blonde, very fine hair. So finding wax strips that work well for me is pretty easy but these are definitely my favorite. I bought mine from a local beauty supply store but they&#x27;re MUCH cheaper on amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The box comes with two sheets of strips, each containing 14 individual strips. On each sheet there are 7 strips for the top of the brow and 7 for the bottom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The description claims they are shaped for most brow shapes, which is true they do have some curve to them. Unfortunately due to the generic curve I had to use at least 6 strips to get my brows into the shape I like. So anyone with thicker hair should expect to probably use more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t have to wax more than every 3 weeks to a month so I don&#x27;t mind having to use so many strips; but it&#x27;s understandable that anyone with wilder brows would probably not be in love with this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At this price it&#x27;s no question that I&#x27;d choose these over going to a salon and spending upwards of 5-7 times as much on one waxing, when this will last at least 4 waxings at home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This brand is reliable when it comes to waxing and these eyebrow \\&quot;shapers\\&quot; strips are my go-to for eyebrow waxing.&lt;br /&gt;I would 100% recommend this product.</li>
    <li> These strips are awesome. I read the reviews before purchasing so I felt as if I had a bit of upper hand.  1. Clean your face with alcohol (I use 99%)  2. Rub your hands over the strips that you will use (to warm them up a bit)  3. Brush your eyebrows up  4. Peel the strip from the end (no wax there!)  5. Look in the mirror while holding the strip in front of where you want it to go  6. Place the strip on the area of hair that you want to remove  7. Hold the skin taught, take a deep breath, and rip the strip against the grain of growth  You might have a few stubborn hairs left...at this price you can definitely do use another strip or you can tweeze them.</li>
    <li> horrible! removes hair just as much as scotch tape...</li>
    <li> I just want to say that I like this product, it doesn&#x27;t get ALL the hair, but it is really helpful! Takes only a few minutes, and I am done! Thanks!</li>
    <li> I typically buy mine from Sally Beauty supply and these are the best ones I have found. They are easy to apply and work great. It may take a few strip to remove all the hair from an area of the brow but I usually go back over it wth tweezers to make sure it&#x27;s all even. They are perfectly shaped for my brows. They give a nice arch but not a fake looking one.</li>
    <li> Currently I have been using Sally Hansen wax strips for the face, and cutting them free hand into an arch shape. While this, in of itself is easy, I figured the Surgi Wax brow shapers would be even easier. First problem with the brow Shapers is the cut and shape of the strip, it is almost like an even, flat bell, with equal &amp;#34;tails&amp;#34; on each side. So I still had to cut them on one side, the side that will fall closest to the nose. I hope that makes sense :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Secondly, my eyebrow hair is pretty fine, so fine I have to fill them in with powder, but this wax is so weak, it hardly removes anything! And yes, I know all the tricks to working with wax strips, I have been doing my own brows with wax for years. If it wasn&#x27;t for the fact I waited 2 months after buying them to try them, I would have returned this junk. At least I didn&#x27;t do the multi-pack order. I&#x27;ll be sticking with Sally Hansen for now, (Nad&#x27;s works well for me also), until a company comes out with a decent pre-cut wax strip for brows.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s work o.k. but you have to be very careful or you can cut youself up.i would recommend something else.</li>
    <li> I know this product does not work well for some, but this is the first product of it&#x27;s kind that has worked for me.  I LOVE IT.  Just make sure you follow the instructions on when to use them and when NOT to use them to give them a fair chance, i.e., you are not supposed to use them if you&#x27;re just out the shower.  I buy them again and again now and love that I no longer am tweezing.  OUCH!</li>
    <li> These things saved me!!!! I had little fine hairs that made my eyebrows look thick ... press and hard and all will be fine.</li>
    <li> I have to use so many of the strips to get my eyebrows how I want them and after that I have to plug them still... I prefer to go get them professionally done or buy another ones.. I didn&#x27;t like the results</li>
    <li> Probably good for light haired women, but I tend to have tougher one in places that still need tweezing.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll probably have to keep this on my &#x27;shopping list&#x27; because it WORKS!  Woo HOO; not so much plucking!</li>
    <li> Wanted speed and convenience, a product that works and a low price.  That&#x27;s what I got.  The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it a 5 was that I would have liked it better if I could have cut the stuff for the shape of my own brow,  which i wind up doing anyway.  This product is nice because it&#x27;s not hot wax, it&#x27;s more like heavy duty transparent tape that sticks very well to the tiny hairs that come out quite easily with one quick pull of the tape.  One caution, always wash the area with soap and water and dry it well.  Nothing works well on oily or damp brow hairs, so clean and dry the area well before applying the strips, and shape them with a small pair of scissors and hold the brown out of the way while applying the strips and, Walla!  The fastest eyebrow shaping you&#x27;ve ever seen.</li>
    <li> I love these strips.  Using them is virtually painless, and the sizes of the strips make them easy to use.  Great for saving money on salon costs.</li>
    <li> Block out time for yourself to take your time when using. Read directions fully &amp; set up B4 starting. Then begin &amp; you will be happy with results. If you rush it, you may be one of the unhappy reviewers.</li>
    <li> I could see these working well for thin brows and normal shaped eyebrows, they did not work for me, 2 sheets of strips later I still had to do 20 minutes of plucking, IF YOU HAVE THICK OR DARK EYEBROWS, DON&#x27;T WASTE 5$ ON THIS PRODUCT.</li>
    <li> these things area  JOKE they dont work hardly even sticky it took a whole sheet of redoing one sppot to get it all and i still had to tweeze... never buying them again!</li>
    <li> Tried this product several times and I wasn&#x27;t able to remove the hair..</li>
