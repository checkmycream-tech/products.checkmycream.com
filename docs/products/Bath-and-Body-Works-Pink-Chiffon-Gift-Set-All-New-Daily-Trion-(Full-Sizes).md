    <li> I did not expect to see full size bottles! great gift!</li>
    <li> This was a Christmas gift that my niece loved. Would rate 5 stars if the package it came with was more presentable. But, over all a great product.</li>
    <li> Gift for my sister in law she loves this. That being said when it arrived the body wash was leaking all over the place</li>
    <li> I Love love love the scent of the Pink Chiffon line!!! It leaves a fantastic aroma in the room when you finish using the products. The products aren&#x27;t harsh on the skin at all. It&#x27;s definitely my fav from bath and body.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my husbands granddaughter who is turning 11.  It is a sweet soft smell to it.  Ideal for that age group... Natural</li>
    <li> My mom and sis loved it</li>

    <li> I purchase the full Pink Chiffon line when my boyfriend told me he liked the smell on a trip to the moll (that I forced him to go with me on).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This smell is super girl, it reminds me of a Ballerina. It smells like potpourri made from roses, summer petals, and vanilla sugar. Honestly, I like fruity or baked sweets more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this to a friend, or give it to them as gift. My friends and I love girly items and luxury items - but if you don&#x27;t like super sweet floral smells don&#x27;t try this one. I wouldn&#x27;t use it again, simply because I like to try new things and I&#x27;ve already done this one now.</li>
    <li> Bought this again and am still pleased as I was the first time. Thank you so much</li>
    <li> Perfect gift for my daughter s birthday. .</li>
