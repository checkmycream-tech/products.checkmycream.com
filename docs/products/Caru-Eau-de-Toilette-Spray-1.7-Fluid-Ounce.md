      <li>This has a very pleasant scent and seems to last quite some time.</li>
      <li>It is not too strong but gives you a clean sophisticated smell</li>
      <li>I WAS EXPECTING A MUCH MORE RICH AND POWERFUL SCENT FOR LACK OF BETTER WORDS</li>
      <li>It has a lovely fresh fragrance, but isn&#x27;t too overpowering or strong.  </li>
      <li>This was a fantastic bargain.</li>
      <li>Scent lingers lightly all day.  </li>

      <li>A  RICH WOODSY FALL SCENT</li>
      <li>I originally bought this when I was traveling to Ireland</li>
      <li>I think it&#x27;s unique.</li>
      <li>It is warm and spicy, and I love getting in touch with my Irish heritage by buying something made in Ireland.  </li>
      <li>I love it and would highly recommend it!</li>
      <li>My absolute favorite.</li>
      <li>I remember he used to sniff my scarf deeply because he loved the smell.</li>
      <li>Nice soft floral, smells like your on a island full of tropical flowers.</li>
      <li>It was shipped quickly and without any problems.</li>
      <li>IT IS A VERY PRETTY SCENT</li>
      <li>Haven&#x27;t met a single person that hasn&#x27;t loved it.</li>
      <li>Scent is wonderful and very long lasting!</li>
      <li>But spicy musky scents can come off a lot more masculine than I prefer.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a distinct smell, but not overpowering or offensive.  </li>
      <li>I ALWAYS get compliments on how nice I smell (just had two individual compliments this weekend)!</li>
      <li>VERY MUCH</li>
      <li>For a very long time I almost always wore the male configuration of the most popular scents, but</li>
      <li>Makes my sweetheart smell pretty</li>
      <li>I first bought this perfume in an Irish shop in my area and fell in love with it.</li>
      <li>This is not the first time I have purchased this fragrance.  </li>
      <li>I AM PARTIAL TO INIS OF THE SEA STILL.. WOULD BE NICE TO HAVE THE NAME ON THE BOTTLE</li>
      <li>I make sure to hit my collar and sleeves for extra staying power.</li>
      <li>Haha!</li>
      <li>still smells lovely a YEAR later...</li>
      <li>When I found Caru (oddly enough at my local County Fair)</li>
      <li>It has a truly rich and luxorious smell that just makes you feel so warm and expensive, truly special.</li>
      <li>IT FADES MUCH TOO</li>
      <li>the whole smelling like a guy thing didn&#x27;t work for me....</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
      <li>It is a bit spicy and very feminine.  </li>
      <li>Due to my bodies chemistry I carry a spicy scent a lot longer than most florals.</li>
      <li>It is more mature than youthful, but it is not old fashioned.</li>
      <li>I tried to find a Caru perfume (as differs from a cologne) but no luck, thus, my title: short but sweet.</li>
      <li>THIS is my new favortie perfume!</li>
      <li>I would highly recommend this perfume.  </li>
      <li>Since I discovered Caru a few years ago it has become one of my top 5 fragrances.  </li>
      <li>It was ok smelling, But it doesn&#x27;t last or linger long on your skin.</li>
      <li>I found my first bottle of Caru while on a business trip totally by accident!  </li>
      <li>I got it the last Christmas my Dad was alive so now</li>

<li> I only use a bit at a time because the scent lasts all day and a little goes a long way.  </li>
<li> A little spritz lasts a long while rather than fading minutes after application.</li>
<li> Reminds me of a late summer day when the still air is redolent with a mixture of leaves, grapes, sunflowers and the last of the summer roses.</li>
<li> Not quite what I had expected from the description.&lt;br /&gt;I do not detect any fruits, flowers or green notes - just amber &amp; woods.&lt;br</li>
<li> I don&#x27;t wear any other perfume!</li>
<li> so good,,,,its earthy and slightly spicy.  </li>
<li> Bought this one for my sister, she is Obsessed with Irish anything.  </li>

    <li> Perfect! A+A+A+A+A+A+</li>
    <li> This is not the first time I have purchased this fragrance.  I absolutely love it!  I even requested it for Christmas.  It is warm and spicy, and I love getting in touch with my Irish heritage by buying something made in Ireland.  It is great!</li>

    <li> My wife has used this product for many years and is as always, awesome! Will continue to purchase on Amazon as it is no longer stocked locally.</li>

    <li> The best scent. Haven&#x27;t met a single person that hasn&#x27;t loved it. Tragically I broke a bottle of it visiting my dad and the guest room still smells lovely a YEAR later...all of his guests want to know what the smell is! Haha!</li>
    <li> THIS is my new favortie perfume! It has a truly rich and luxorious smell that just makes you feel so warm and expensive, truly special.</li>
    <li> Makes my sweetheart smell pretty</li>

    <li> LOVE this perfume!!!! I ALWAYS get compliments on how nice I smell (just had two individual compliments this weekend)! I originally bought this when I was traveling to Ireland and I&#x27;ve been a converted user for years now. I don&#x27;t wear any other perfume!</li>
    <li> I found my first bottle of Caru while on a business trip totally by accident!  I went through the bottle in no time and was worried I&#x27;d never find it!  Voila, available on Amazon!  Caru is a very lovely fresh scent, not overpowering or overwhelming as some perfumes can be.  It&#x27;s a mix of wildflowers and woodsy.  Give it a try!!</li>
    <li> It was ok smelling, But it doesn&#x27;t last or linger long on your skin. I had to keep Re-applying.</li>
    <li> Not quite what I had expected from the description.&lt;br /&gt;I do not detect any fruits, flowers or green notes - just amber &amp; woods.&lt;br /&gt;(Customer service was great, however!)</li>
    <li> I looked for a scent that I loved for about a Year. When I found Caru (oddly enough at my local County Fair) I was thrilled.  It is a lovely scent but way too short lived. I bought 4 because I have to keep reapplying it.  I tried to find a Caru perfume (as differs from a cologne) but no luck, thus, my title: short but sweet.</li>
    <li> I first bought this perfume in an Irish shop in my area and fell in love with it. It was fall and I started talking in a more-than-friends-way and dating my boyfriend all while wearing this perfume. I remember he used to sniff my scarf deeply because he loved the smell. It&#x27;s so sophisticated and autumnesque! I had to repurchase it for this fall to reminisce those times. I highly recommend this product! It was shipped quickly and without any problems.</li>
    <li> IT IS A VERY PRETTY SCENT AND I LIKE IT VERY MUCH HOWEVER I DOUBT I WOULD ORDER IT AGAIN BECAUSE THE&lt;br /&gt;SCENT DOES NOT LAST/WEAR LONG AT ALL EVEN IF YOU SPRAY A LOT IT FADES MUCH TOO QUICKLY.&lt;br /&gt;  I WAS EXPECTING A MUCH MORE RICH AND POWERFUL SCENT FOR LACK OF BETTER WORDS I WAS EXPECTING MORE&lt;br /&gt;OF A  RICH WOODSY FALL SCENT SOMETHING MORE UNIQUE.&lt;br /&gt;  I STILL THINK THE SCENT IS WONDERFUL THOUGH NOT WHAT I WAS HOPING FOR. IF THE SCENT LASTED LONGER&lt;br /&gt;I WOULD ORDER IT AGAIN.</li>
    <li> I just love this perfume.  It has a lovely fresh fragrance, but isn&#x27;t too overpowering or strong.  My husband is from Ireland and it does remind me of  Ireland when I wear it.  I would highly recommend this perfume.  It is quite nice!</li>
    <li> What can I say about Caru! But it&#x27;s a happy scent! Nice soft floral, smells like your on a island full of tropical flowers. This perfume makes me Happy!! Another compliment, perfume.. Stays on all day! Buy it lady&#x27;s!!&lt;br /&gt;Happy Customer!!&lt;br /&gt;Tamara</li>
    <li> Love this scent. Even more I love that not everyone and her sister is using it because it isn&#x27;t sold in every dept.store or drugstore along side all the celebrity hyped crap!</li>
    <li> A lovely warm scent, doesn&#x27;t overwhelm.  Made me wish I was back in Ireland.</li>
    <li> wonderful scent and fantastic service, I am a repeat customer of theirs already  love the product</li>
    <li> Reminds me of a late summer day when the still air is redolent with a mixture of leaves, grapes, sunflowers and the last of the summer roses.</li>
    <li> Bought a bottle of this in Dublin. Bought it again to remind me of a wonderful trip and country. Its a \\&quot;warm\\&quot; scent makes you want to cuddle and snuggle into it. It also has a \\&quot;sweetness\\&quot; to it, but it isn&#x27;t candy or bubble gummish. It is more mature than youthful, but it is not old fashioned. I do spray it on my skin generously to smell it all day. I make sure to hit my collar and sleeves for extra staying power. Doesn&#x27;t last ALL day, but lasts well in to the day. I&#x27;d say you can get a good 6-8 hours out of it. It&#x27;s a distinct smell, but not overpowering or offensive.  I think it&#x27;s unique. Love it. Will keep buying it.  If it came as a parfum I&#x27;d give it 5 stars. My rating lacks 1 star only because its scent life is short.</li>
    <li> My absolute favorite. Scent is wonderful and very long lasting! I got it the last Christmas my Dad was alive so now I think of him when I wear it!</li>
    <li> This has a very pleasant scent and seems to last quite some time. I would recommend it if you like a light pleasant fragrance.</li>
    <li> Due to my bodies chemistry I carry a spicy scent a lot longer than most florals. But spicy musky scents can come off a lot more masculine than I prefer. For a very long time I almost always wore the male configuration of the most popular scents, but the whole smelling like a guy thing didn&#x27;t work for me....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Caru however is a warm and beautiful combination of both floral and spice that sticks to my skin well but doesn&#x27;t come off as manly in any way. My husbands loves the scent (actually all of the Fragrances of Ireland are his favs) and says to him it smells like &amp;#34;fall&amp;#34;. This was an awesome choice to round out my perfume collection for the coming winter.</li>
    <li> like the smell of this fragrance</li>
