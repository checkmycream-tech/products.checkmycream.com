<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Love the product but unfortunately the pump stopped working and there is no way to open the container to use the product.  Now it just slowly oozes out a small whole in the bottom. What a waste and disappointment.</li>
    <li> Works okay... It can weigh hair down but it does add wonderful moisture to my treated, dry and damaged hair. I&#x27;ve gotten an Argon oil mask that works a kinda better and about half the price. Something to consider. That being said, there is an It&#x27;s a 10 Miracle spray that is AHHHmazing. I&#x27;d recommend that over this, tbh. (Ulta has a small sample-size-ish for a quick try)</li>
    <li> Every gal/guy needs this product in their shower - great deep conditioning and smells great too! Worth the $$$ for sure</li>
    <li> I thought I was going to have to cut my hair, it was so damaged. I used this and my hair is soft and shiney. Don&#x27;t use much. And rinse, rinse, rinse or it will weigh down your hair. I also have to wash my hair twice to get it out. But I can go 4 days without washing my hair. I also recommend using a silk pillow case. That way your hair stays neat, and the lotion that you put on your faces stays on instead of soaking into the cotton pillow case Just a little fyi.</li>
    <li> this stuff is awesome. its my every day must have. straight out of shower I spray in and brush and I have great manageable hair. it doesn&#x27;t leave my fine hair limp and gross like almost every other product on the market. its a 10 for me!</li>
    <li> This conditioner works wonders on my dry, curly hair.  The scent is light and even though this hair mask is heavy it doesn&#x27;t seem to leave a greasy build up.  Highly recommended for anyone with curly/dry hair!</li>
    <li> I love how it&#x27;s a 10 leaves my hair soft.</li>
    <li> I use this all the time.  It can make your hair limp because it conditions so well so be prepared to use extra hair product if you want volume.  Or just put it on the ends of your hair.  Shipped very quickly.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been a loyal customer to this product for 3 years now. I&#x27;ve tried other masks and treatments  bUT nothing has been as effective at repairing my hair without weighin my hair down( Other brands include Sexy Healthy Hair, Paul Mitchell Moisture and Awapuhi Wild Ginger, Macadamia Oil, and a few others). My hair is light, shiny, soft and free of dry split ends when I&#x27;m done with it. I use it once weekly.</li>
    <li> I love this hair mask.  The longer you let it stay in your hair the better results in texture and appearance of your hair.</li>
    <li> Not The legit product! Bottle looked damage, like pried open and does not smell like the real product or does not work like the real product! Tried to give the benefit of the doubt, now it&#x27;s too late to return. Wash of money!</li>
    <li> Anything that keeps my naturally frizzy, wavy hair looking smooth and silky during an August vacation to Florida is nothing short of a miracle!  Left it on my hair for 5 mins in the shower each day and had beautiful hair all day. Have used this and the leave-in spray for months and my hair&#x27;s never looked better in the summer.  Product arrived quiclky and in perfect condition. Definitely would recommend.</li>
    <li> This brand is somewhat expensive..But it works really well. I use it everyday and I&#x27;ve noticed a difference in my hair..I don&#x27;t get split ends as much as I used to..and it makes your hair feel really good after a shower.</li>
    <li> I love all of these products! A little pricey but worth it. I have frizzy hair and this has helped my frizz become beautiful curls.</li>
    <li> I bought this after it was recommended by my stylist, and am so happy I bought it. I have curly hair and it is super dry esp in the winter. I do a light wash on my hair or if I don&#x27;t have any product in it I just do a nice long rinse. Then I get a small golf ball size ( I have really long hair) and apply it to my ends and spread through out. A lil bit does go a long way with this but it will work wonders for you. I leave it for about ten minutes and do a slightly warm/cool water rinse. My hair is so soft and easy to comb and style after. Its my saving grace. The fact my husband loves it doesn&#x27;t hurt either.</li>
    <li> I have have dyed my hair any and every color I could get my hands on since the tender age of 14.  For the past year I&#x27;ve been trying to recover from bleaching my hair white from black hair. Chunks of hair would fall out or break whenever I would try and brush it, my hair was so stringy and porous it would practically turn into a mushy and unshapoo-able mess, and I tried everything from apogee&#x27;s \\&quot;protein treatment\\&quot; to redkin&#x27;s \\&quot;leave in anti-snap\\&quot; product.  Every night I would leave in conditioning masks and olive oil, but noting made my hair regain some of it&#x27;s original strength or shine. Even my go-to queen helene&#x27;s cholesterol hair mask wasn&#x27;t getting the job done!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My neighbor, who was a hairdresser back in her day, offered me the \\&quot;it&#x27;s a 10 miracle hair mask\\&quot; and I accepted it without thinking it would actually do anything.  Even after the first few tries, I saw a difference! This conditioner by no means revived my mess of a mane, but it did help more than any other product has! It smells delicious, it keeps my hair agreeably manageable, and i can see my ends getting progressively better.  I was surprised about the hair mask working because overly damaged hair is usually in dire need of keratin in products to fill in the broken shaft of the hair, and this mask is not a keratin or protein rich mask.  I did notice though that using the hair mask and it&#x27;s a 10 protein leave in spray together brought on the best results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was very tempted to try their shampoo and conditioners, but i&#x27;ve only recently discovered \\&quot;say yes to carrots\\&quot; shampoo set.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;anyways! SUMMERY: get this mask, it works! it smells amazing! it&#x27;s sulfate free!!! totally worth the price  :]</li>
    <li> I originally bought this for an outrageous price at the beauty salon.  I love, love, love it.  I have thick coarse hair with a mind of its own.  I don&#x27;t like to spend much time on my hair.  Using this once a week makes my hair much smoother and easy to manage.  I highly recommend as a weekly deep conditioner and, if your hair has gotten particularly damaged/out of hand, apply to dry hair to all but roots, wrap up in towel, and rinse out in 30 minutes.</li>
    <li> Love this product! Use it every time I shampoo!  It&#x27;s like crack for the hair..very addicting! Can use anything else to condition my hair after shampooing.</li>
    <li> For the price do not worth it. Works the same as any other conditioner.</li>
    <li> I spent a lot on this and have had better rsults with just using my sebastian penetraitt conditioner. I have straight, bleached blonde hair and this product made it a little shinier but left it heavy, flat and a tad greasy. my sister who has natural hair and a perm used it and it worked wonders. i think it works better for curly haired people in general. will not repurchase. miracle 7 leave in mist with my sebastian penetraitt conditioner works much better than this masque.</li>
    <li> Best conditioner out there, and this Seller has the lowest price anywhere!</li>
    <li> I really like the its a 10 products.  This one is as good as the reviews said.  It only takes a small amount and makes your hair soft.</li>
    <li> Pump ceased to work and began leaking from a hole in the bottom of the container wasting a lot of product.</li>
    <li> Awesome product - I use it every 3-4 days, lightly rinse and try to leave some on because my colored hair is so dry. Great on time delivery too.</li>
    <li> Leaves hair feeling gorgeous and touchable. I have naturally curly hair, often dry, and chemically enhanced.  No more knots, tangles, and dry ends when using It&#x27;s a 10 Miracle Hair Mask after shampooing with it&#x27;s mate 10 shampoo. Does not weigh hair down. Not greasy.  Silky and luxurious mane of long hair.  Should work well on straight hair as well. Feels so good to the touch.  Enhances color of treated hair. Sexy stuff in a bottle.  Don&#x27;t forget the 10 shampoo.  Beautiful combo.</li>
    <li> My daughter has very long hair and uses this product every day.  Needless to say, we are purchasing this pricey product often.  This hair mask is the only product that provided the results my daughter wanted.  It tames the frizzies and makes long hair look silky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was thrilled to discover the larger container on amazon at a price per ounce much less than anywhere else.</li>
    <li> Seems to just dry out my hair. Probably from the all the alcohol that is in the ingredients.</li>
    <li> Pair this with the It&#x27;s a 10 Miracle leave in product with keratin and your damaged, frizzy hair will feel just like SILK!!!</li>
    <li> I have chemically damaged hair from bleaching and this is the best hair mask I&#x27;ve ever used and has softened and strengthened my hair in a few months! I usually use it once a week as a mask- wash and towel dry hair, apply a generous amount of product and comb through, put on a clear shower cap and leave it on while I do chores around the house for about 30min to an hour, rinse and have the softest hair ever!</li>
    <li> My wifes favorite hair product and its comes in a bulk size for a great price. Much cheaper than anywhere else i found.</li>
    <li> I have been using the product for about 3 weeks and I loved it. This product is a real help, my hair is soft, shiny and stronger now.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  In a short period my hair has transformed to a very healthy texture and appearance.  I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> I saw the good ratings on here and hoped that there would finally be an amazing product that would help my severely dry, damaged hair. I have used so many different hair products in the past that have claimed to repair my hair. So far all have failed. I started using \\&quot;it&#x27;s a 10\\&quot; about two months ago, applying it every other day leaving it to saturate in my hair for 20 min. (Note: I haven&#x27;t used ANY heat products for the past 5 months)  Since I&#x27;ve been using it, I don&#x27;t see much of a change in my hair from this product. Even when I got out of the shower directly after using it my hair wasn&#x27;t noticeably soft, nourished, or shiny. It&#x27;s a 6.</li>
    <li> Expensive, I found that aussie 3 minute miracle works better, and it a lot cheaper, I would not recommend this product</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing! Great smell and it&#x27;s helping my dry hair.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this hair product. Makes my hair feel healthy and soft. I Definitely recommend it for color treated hair!</li>
    <li> this product is really good for my hair, helps my hair smoothly. love it and decide to keep using it.</li>
    <li> I received a container of this for Christmas one year, and used it...  I liked it just fine, but didn&#x27;t want to pay the price for it once it was gone.  For two or three weeks I went back to my old favorite and could not believe the difference!  My hair was so much softer, less tangled and easier to deal with all the way around with the \\&quot;It&#x27;s a 10 miracle hair mask\\&quot;!  I constantly felt like my hair was still dirty, or static-y or harder to brush and just wouldn&#x27;t lay right for those few weeks when I wasn&#x27;t using it.  I still don&#x27;t like paying the price, which is why I buy it on Amazon!  But, until it&#x27;s discontinued I will use nothing else anymore.  I buy the 17.5 ounce pumps and they last me about 6 months because you don&#x27;t need to use very much.  I guess overall that&#x27;s not so bad, when you look at it that way - my other conditioner wasn&#x27;t exactly cheap and the bottles would only last me about 6 weeks because I had to use more!&lt;br /&gt;Anyway - I recommend the product fully, I love it - it&#x27;s great!&lt;br /&gt;:o)</li>
    <li> Great conditioner.  Leaves hair silky smooth.  If you have fine hair don&#x27;t use too much.  Could leave your hair too limp.</li>
    <li> My hair is 4 feet long (no exaggeration) and I&#x27;ve have tried lots of products. When I started using this (first day) I even had a person ask me what I used in my hair. I ran out and that same person said &amp;#34;have you stopped using that conditioner?&amp;#34; The results are immediately noticeable and fantastic. Makes my hair so soft and shiny. I&#x27;ll never go without this again!</li>
    <li> it was recommended to me by a friend, it definitely has worked miracles on my hair and its a good bargain compared to what you can find at the stores, will buy again!!</li>
    <li> My hair is so beyond damaged, I bleached it at home 3 times myself, lucky it didn&#x27;t all break off. I found this and left it on for 5-10 minutes and it helped until my next wash. My hair wasn&#x27;t so frizzy and tangled. But then I learned to leave it on for 30 minutes after a shower, then rinse it off. The results last much longer if you do that. I do this every other week, generally I rotate with an argan oil &amp;#34;mask&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the only thing keeping my hair on my head until the damage grows out. It really is a miracle and worth the price of the big bottle. The only issue I had with the big size is that this stuff is thick and it takes a lot of work to get it into the pump straw and out the spout.</li>
    <li> Hands down, the best deep conditioner I have ever used. I leave it in for 5-10 minutes while I shower/shave my legs/etc and my hair is so silky smooth after I rinse. I recommend deep conditioning weekly! So happy with the improvements I have seen with my hair since using this product. After a couple months of use, I can now let my hair air-dry without it looking like a frizzy nightmare! An added bonus is that this company is cruelty free and doesn&#x27;t test on animals :D</li>
    <li> I will always make sure I have this on hand. This stuff makes my coarse hair SO soft and detangled.</li>
    <li> LOVE this conditioner!!  Leaving it on for 15-20 minutes once a week has done amazing things for my over processed  hair.  My hair went from being crunchy and breaking every time I tried to blow dry it to being soft and shiny again.  I will never be without this stuff again!!</li>
    <li> I loved it! Made my hair super soft and I saw good result!!</li>
    <li> My hair is very dry and with this product I use it as a leave in conditioner in the ends of my hair before styling. My hair is soft and manageable. It&#x27;s a good price to.</li>
    <li> This mask is amazing! Here&#x27;s my story: I had decided to dye my hair red after so long. However, I had dyed by hair black months before. Therefore the stylist said that it needed to be bleached before in order for the red to show. The bleaching was carried out as if adding in a huge amount of highlights. Unfortunately after the bleaching, the red dye did not grasp on to my hair properly.  Some parts would look great while others with the hint of blonde. I did not like it so I decided to go back a week later and re dye it again red to cover up the blonde spots throughout the hair. In addition to this, the ends of my hair did not look as red as the roots. Therefore, the stylist added a higher volume for the red dye to that bottom half of my hair due to the whole previously black hair dye I had in. After this second hair dye, my hair started breaking drastically! It would literally break pieces by pieces! I didn&#x27;t have to do anything &amp; it would just break. My hair felt sooooo hard and after the second day of the re-dying, I was not able to pass a comb/brush through my hair! It was un-combable no matter what I did. I bought the aphogee treatments for my hair (shampoo, keratin, protein, pro-vitamin leave in conditioner). I tried it for about a month and a half. I did the protein treatment first. I think it helped a little because I did not see as much breakage but it broke. The following weeks I used the shampoo and keratin and pro-vitamin leave in conditioner. I did not see much improvements in using these. All that it did was to make my hair comb-able right after showering due to the pro-vitamin leave in conditioner. When my hair dried, I didn&#x27;t dare brush it, especially not on the second/third day. I got worried that I would never be able to have manageable here again. Therefore, I went online and did some more research and found these products. I decided to give them a try. Guess what? They are the best ever! After just ONE use, it made my hair feel soooo great! It was as if I had never dyed my hair! It&#x27;s the third day since first usage and it still feels so soft that I don&#x27;t even need to brush it! Silky smooth! I use this in combination with the 10 mirable leavin-in plus keratin spray. I will most def continue using these 2 products! They work wonders! You will not regret purchasing! Wish they sold them in my country (Belize) but sadly they don&#x27;t so as soon as a friend travels to the US again, I am re-stocking!</li>
    <li> This product has always been 100% for me and I couldn&#x27;t live with out it. Then I got this one bottle&amp; is nothing like I have always used it was already opened and it doesn&#x27;t smell the same either its just like normal ol&#x27; conditioner.  Very unhappy I will buy it from another company.</li>
    <li> Keeps hair soft, manageable and helps so much with split ends. The price was excellent as well. The product itself is great - just one bit of advice, use it maybe twice a week no more, it tends to do the opposite if you use it daily.</li>
    <li> product overall is great but lost bout 1oz in shipping</li>
    <li> Very pleased with the product. I will recommended to anyone thank you very much. I will be glad to buy it again</li>
    <li> The woman who washes my hair, uses this product.  It make my hair feel so soft. I decided to by some to use at home.  This is my third order of this product.  This time, i bought the bigger size.  You just use a little bit of the product each time you wash your hair.</li>
    <li> I love the product , was exactly what i  thought  smell&#x27;s amazing .Makes my hair soooo soft. Shipping was very fast also.&lt;br /&gt;Thank u soo much;).</li>
    <li> Love this stuff.  Use it every time I shampoo.  Havent found anything better.</li>
    <li> I have very curly hair.  this was OK.  I liked it but I stopped using it. It was heavy in my hair.  I found something better and started using that. I also didn&#x27;t like what it was made out of.  My friend uses it and her hair looks nice.  Hair products are so personal, everyone needs to try different ones and see what works for them.</li>
    <li> Great stuff. Expensive but worth it.</li>
    <li> Love love love it!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> My hair has been bleached on 4 separate occasions, and it got to the point where my super long hair was breaking off into short shoulder-length pieces, a total nightmare. This product has saved my overly processed hair and my stylist is amazed as well. Every time I use this my hair feels better and better and is reverting back into its natural texture. Smells amazing too!</li>
    <li> I love this product, been using it for some time, now, HOWEVER, this product came to me with a hole in the bottom requiring I pound out the conditioner from the bottom in order to use it. I don&#x27;t understand what happened here? It was as if there was a deliberate hole drilled into the bottom or something?</li>
    <li> Omgoodness!!!!  My hair was soooooo soft and super full after one use!  I plan on buying their other products. I hope they&#x27;re just as good!</li>
    <li> My hair was damaged from chemotherapy, but after using It&#x27;s A 10 Miracle products, it is healthier than ever before.  A friend told me to try it, because my curls were frizzy.  She said it is a little expensive, but a little goes a long way.  I had tried SOOO many products, so I figured I would try one more, before accepting that my hair was permanently damaged and I would just have to accept that I had cancer, so it&#x27;s par for the course.  I bought the shampoo, conditioner, leave in conditioner, and mask, and after ONE use, I could instantly see and feel a difference!  I like the scent of the keratin shampoo, conditioner, and mask more than the leave in scent.  It doesn&#x27;t smell bad, it just doesn&#x27;t smell as wonderful as the others.  If I am in a hurry, I will just shampoo my hair, towel dry, and put some mask product in my hair, comb it through and go.  My hair is so much softer and shinier too!  It will take a MIRACLE to get me to change from these products! No pun intended :)</li>
    <li> This hair mask saved my hair. I use it as a conditioner. I bleach my hair and my hair is now strong and very long. My stylist said there is no way my hair would be as nice as it is without using high quality products like this (I don&#x27;t buy my products from her). My best friend wanted to know what products I use in my hair and she went out and bought this stuff and loved it too. I do think this product is the reason for my beautiful hair. I&#x27;ve been using this hair mask for over two years.</li>
    <li> I ran out of this yesterday and I&#x27;m sooo sad because I had some unexpected expenses this month and I can&#x27;t afford to buy it again right now.  I love the smell, I love how it makes my hair feel while I&#x27;m letting it set in the shower.. it gets rid of most tangles and makes my hair really smooth.  I wish I could find a cheaper version of this amazing conditioner.</li>
    <li> GREAT product. Keeps my curls totally moisturized without weighing down my fine hair. Lasts forever, I&#x27;ve had it for over two years and I use at least every other time I wash my hair - still going.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve gotten so many compliments on my hair since I started using it; it&#x27;s shiny and feels amazing. Helps to smooth and straighten my naturally curly and frizzy hair.</li>
    <li> this is always good stuff but the price varies greatly. Shop around before you buy and save yourself some money</li>
    <li> I use this once a week for 30 minutes. I saturate my hair, stick it in a shower cap, and do what I need to do around the house. When the timers up, I rinse it out and go about my day. It helps with my permed hair. I wish it came in a bigger bottle!!</li>
    <li> I like the creamy feeling of it. The smell is very nice too. Huge size, it will last forever :-). Easy to comb my out-of-control, frizzy, wavy hair. The expectations are succeeded.</li>
    <li> I use this about once every other week instead of condition, makes my hair noticeably softer, also keeps works to keep and scalp moisturized.  It&#x27;s expensive, but since I only use it occasionally, it lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> I love this product....its the only hair conditioner that I would even write a review about....just try it and you can see for yourself. I use the hair mask as a conditioner and once a week I deep condition as a mask. It is worth every penny.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing. My daughter&#x27;s har gets so dry.  I use this once a week and use the leave-in spray for the inbetween days.  Much cheaper on here than in the store</li>
    <li> I love this stuff!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this product for about eight years now!</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t tell you how many brands of shampoos and conditioners I&#x27;ve tried over the years. This is the BEST CONDITIONER EVER. My hair never feels silkier or more manageable than after having used this as a deep treatment (leaving it on for more than 10 minutes.)</li>
    <li> I had my hair platinum blonde for a year. After coloring it back to brown I could really feel the damage and frizz the blonde had cause. This conditioner is a lifesaver and I can preform deep conditions at home with it without going to the salon and paying bank. We&#x27;ll worth the money for this product!</li>
    <li> This product smells so nice makes you hair smell good and it is really good for it. I highly recmoned this product for your hair, the smell is just a bonus, it also helps strengthen your hair.</li>
    <li> This mask goes on well on the hair without offensive odor. I love how my hair felt after only one treatment.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m glad the reviews reflected 5 star rating. It does hydrate your hair,  feels soft, less frizzy and much more manageble.</li>
    <li> Either I got a bad bottle or i don&#x27;t see the hype in this product. My pantine is more moisturizing and smells just as great as this product.  Nothing special</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work quite as well as I was hoping (I have used other It&#x27;s a 10 products in the past) but it still worked well. I like using it for a leave in.</li>
    <li> Amazing for dry thick hair</li>
    <li> i&#x27;m a skeptic. and i was desperate. i&#x27;m asian, i was born with only one hair color option; black. but i dreamed of being blonde, if only for one day. i just wanted to try something different. so i did it. i went blonde. and after 5 intense bleaching treatments my hair was sad. sad and sick and dying. it felt dead. like the fake hair on the head of an old, dirty abused barbie doll. it crunched when i grasped it. i couldn&#x27;t brush through it without running into several rats&#x27; nests. and the luster and softness that comes with healthy hair was nowhere to be found. then THIS happened. this miracle elixir from the gods has saved my hair. it went from cheap wig hair to shiny, soft, silky, brushable blonde hair. i can&#x27;t rave about this enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;long story short: after just one use i went from having dead barbie doll hair to shiny, soft, silky, human goddess hair. and you can too!!!!</li>
    <li> I love love love this conditioner!!!  my daughter and I both have long hair, but this container will last us several months!!  Leave her hair easy to comb out and actually appears to have repaired the clhorine damage from last summer&#x27;s swim season.</li>
    <li> I have naturally curly hair, italian curl ringlets, which is bleached blonde and goes through a lot of heat styling. I use this deep conditioner once a week after regular shampoo and conditioning. I leave this on for 5-25 minute depending on if my hair feels strawlike or not. I rinse with coolwater. Leaves my hair healthy and infused with moisture.  I love it. Only con is that the bottle uses air pump technology. Product wont come out and the top cant be screwed off or taken off at all. Hence a refund and return to amazon. Booo</li>
    <li> I always use the Miracle Mask by Its A 10, this  bottle is the best! Its a great splurge the standard size is so much smaller I was amazed to find this jumbo sized product</li>
    <li> I had very hight hopes for this product, I was really hoping it would do the &amp;#34;miracle&amp;#34; for my hair, especially after reading so many positive reviews. It didn&#x27;t. But to be fair, my hair is dead, not just dry or damaged, it&#x27;s dead. It happened after a failed attempt to get ombre hair at a salon, just to end up with my beautiful long to the waist natural blonde hair destroyed a couple of inches away from the scalp. So... you can imagine my desperation. I bought the whole line of products: the shampoo, the mask, the leave in and the oil. For a month I used the mask every other day for 20 minutes. And then I got bored and used it (my second bottle) as a regular conditioner, only 5 minutes. I don&#x27;t want to give it less stars because it probably does work on simply dry hair, my roots are actually very healthy now, and even though it didn&#x27;t do the &amp;#34;miracle&amp;#34; for me, the consistent use of all the products have helped my hair to look and feel better. I just have to wait while it grows back because the lesson here is that dead hair won&#x27;t come back to life no matter what you do.</li>
    <li> absolutely  awesome my new favourite smells crazy yummy... huge bottle &amp; a little goes a long way......i recommend to EVERYONE...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;many thanks☆☆☆☆</li>
    <li> With this product you see results immediately. It really made a difference for my hair it made it soft and silky. Highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years- love it!  This is my first time to buy such a large container... GREAT deal-  THANKS</li>
    <li> I bought this for my mom for her birthday about a month ago. I&#x27;m giving it a 5 star review on her behalf because she is crazy about this product. She has 100% gray, naturally curly hair which she color treats and flat irons almost daily. She is always complaining about it being dry &amp; brittle so I treated her with this product based on other reviews. She is very happy with it. She says it leaves her hair feeling soft &amp; silky all day long. She insisted I try it, but it didn&#x27;t do much for my very curly color treated hair. It just seemed like any other conditioner I use (Aussie, Loreal, etc.). My hair isn&#x27;t damaged though and I never flat iron it, so maybe I just couldn&#x27;t tell if there was a difference. The next morning my hair was as dry as ever though, so there wasn&#x27;t any lasting effects for me. But, like I said, my mom is really crazy about this product and I&#x27;ve noticed a lot of other positive reviews from women who have gray/color treated hair who use flat irons.</li>
    <li> Best conditioner ever!!! For people who dye their hair a lot (ombre, blonde, etc), this is the best thing you can do to make it up for your hair! Trust me i have tried every conditioner there is on the counter and beyond. This thing rocks and is worth every penny (more expensive than other conditioners including a very good one from Costco/Kirtland)</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a 10 really is a 10. A superior product.</li>
    <li> You have fine, but otherwise unruly hair that friezes easily in humidity or has curl to it. You have thick curly or ethnic curly hair, my best friend is of Jewish descent with very dry curly hair this tames the curl!  Chemically damaged hair from products or chlorine.  It&#x27;s just magic to sit it on your hair under a throw a way shower cap while you shower or let the heat let it do its work or blow dry it in and wash it out.  The scent is tolerable as long as I don&#x27;t try to sleep with it and I rinse well (I&#x27;m prone to migraine and must be very careful).  Rinse with warm water then some cold and it gives you lovely shine and softness.  It has worked wonders on my hair that took a beating from medicines.</li>
    <li> This is so much more than just conditioner! It is like a hair mask. I use it on days where my hair needs some extra softness, but I also use it as a conditioning treatment/mask when my hair has been dried out by weather, styling and/or other circumstances. I wash my hair, put on the conditioner, put on a bath cap and leave it on for at least 20 minutes. You will not believe how soft, supple and manageable your hair will be. My husband loves touching it after I do it!</li>
    <li> This is a MUST HAVE in the summer. Between the heat, the sun, the pool and all the extra hair washes summer requires, Perfect 10 repairs my hair and leaves it as soft as ever!</li>
    <li> I started purchasing  this product a few years ago when it was recommended by my stylist. It leaves even stressed heir shiny, soft, and smooth. It reduces breakage in my hair, even after bleaching. I consider it a necessity for both myself and my 8 year old daughter who has very thick hair with long curls. She swims a lot and chlorine dries and damages her hair. Like the label says, the It&#x27;s a ten repairs her hair within a few washes, like a miracle. It&#x27;s a great product.</li>
    <li> i love this deep conditioner. leaves hair really soft and easy to brush...LOVE..LOVE</li>
    <li> My hair gets treated with hair coloring about every 2 months so it gets damaged a lot. This product has made it significantly softer and I can brush through my hair without tangles. My hair feels a little thinner though and it gets staticy but that could be due to it being winter so I don&#x27;t know.</li>
    <li> amazing! I have a skin condition that makes my hair VERY brittle and VERY dry. It has been compared to wire! This product has got me as a loyal consumer it just flat out works! I have soft hair for the first time in my life I have people asking me what I did to my hair and if I could recommend the stylist! no hair cut just a great product! many compliments! this is awesome! This side by side with my Paul Mitchel forever blond products has finally got my hair to perfection.</li>
    <li> Product was as advertised.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite conditioner! I use this product at least 2 times per month and it&#x27;s helped to restore health to my dry, relaxed hair and my daughter&#x27;s thick, dry, natural hair recently damaged from over-using the blow dryer and flat iron. After washing with a gentle shampoo, I apply the mask generously, work it through in sections &amp; gently comb with a wide-tooth comb starting with the ends. If I have time, I&#x27;ll sit under a heating cap for 30 - 45 minutes (otherwise I&#x27;ll put a plastic cap on while I&#x27;m in the shower and keep it in for 15 minutes). After rinsing, I remove the excess water and follow up with Miracle 10 Keratin Leave In spray. This mask is the perfect detangler and leaves our hair soft, strong, completely detangled &amp; very shiny. It&#x27;s replaced my Wen products. I would have given it 5 stars but I bought the larger size and the pump stops working after a few uses and since the top isn&#x27;t removable - I wasn&#x27;t able to use all of the product (this has happened a few times now so I only buy the 8-oz.).  Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> This conditioner is the best! With other condititoners I use, I never rinse my hair fully so there&#x27;s a little product left and it will keep my hair feeling soft. With this one, I can rinse it all out and it feels like butter. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s this or the It&#x27;s a 10 Miracle Leave-In Plus Keratin, but my hair is softer and healthier looking than ever. I have curly hair, and when I straighten it, it usually looks dry &amp; fried, but this time around it was very soft and shiny.</li>
    <li> This is not the same as what you can buy from a salon... It is no good whatsoever..</li>
    <li> This is honestly the first hair conditioner that I&#x27;ve used that truly makes my hair softer and shinier and feels so much healthier!!!  I&#x27;ve just bought the shampoo also since I now trust that the Miracle 10 people really have the answer to dry hair!</li>
    <li> Its a 10 Hair Mask made my colored, dry, frizzy hair soft, shiny and healthy looking again. I also use the Its a 10 Leave In product with keratin and it allows me to defy the rain and humidity with just a few spritzes before blow drying. I&#x27;ve tried a lot of disappointing hair products, but these two I recommend to friends and family. Nice to find something that really works when so few products actually do what they claim.  It really is a \\&quot;10\\&quot;.</li>
    <li> I love this hair mask, I actually mix a small amount in with the conditioner and leave it on in the shower for a few minutes before rinsing.  It has made my hair look and feel softer, with a nice luster.</li>
    <li> I have no idea what this is but my girlfriend buys a ton of it</li>
    <li> last year all I did was dye my hair red, eventually my hair was so damaged that the red wouldn&#x27;t hold for longer than a week and it would immediately fade to this drab, unflattering brown... so I went to get my hair bleached so that I could leave it alone for a bit and let it grow out naturally, since I&#x27;m a natural blonde. I really wish I had known about this product back then. I wound up caving and dying my already damaged hair red again (I cant help it lol) and I wouldn&#x27;t be able to keep the color and keep my hair as healthy looking as it&#x27;s been lately if it weren&#x27;t for this hair mask!! Even if your hair is brittle, dry and damaged ends from overdying, crunchy, out of control, whatever, this stuff puts back in what you&#x27;ve taken out of your hair. I&#x27;m not sure if its the hydrolyzed collagen or what, but there&#x27;s plenty of nourishing natural oils, its great to use as an extra strong conditioner by itself, or after your own conditioner, I like to use it as a leave in treatment sometimes :) I really want to try more of their products, because this one has blown my mind. And it smells soo yummy! :D</li>
    <li> Unfortunately, after using this product, with using no straightening irons or damaging heat styling tools, my hair had more breakage and dryness than it did originally.It was reducing my natural curls and causing scalp and facial skin irritation at times. Not so happy about this, I decided to check out the ingredients and here is what I found:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Butylphenyl : Synthetic fragrance. A skin irritant, its use is RESTRICTED in both leave-on and wash-off products because of its powerful sensitisation potential. In animals, skin applications at high concentrations caused sperm damage and CNS effects such as drowsiness and breathing difficulties?!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;to add to my not wanting to use it, it contains: Methylparaben AND Butylparaben: Any parabens are oestrogen mimics, and excess oestrogen is a trigger for oestrogen-dependent cancers of the breast, ovary, uterus and testicles, and may even affect fetal development. Scientists analysing breast-cancer tissues have found accumulated parabens in every sample.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Basically - NO THANKS! :(</li>
    <li> This brand is a real miracle for me.  I have naturally thick, dark brown hair -- that being said, I&#x27;ve colored/bleached/stripped my hair so much, it&#x27;s crazy I still have any left. About 1 year ago, I was in the military, when I decided to color my hair for the first time since I had joined. Like a lot of \\&quot;office\\&quot; jobs out there - the military has a strict hair code for both men and women. I went to a salon I have never been to, and have my hair lightened, so that I may turn into a blonde. Unfortunately, the colorist doing my hair used a solution that made my hair turn more orange that say, red or a light brown (like she said it would). Normally, I wouldn&#x27;t have overreacted, seeing as how I know how bleach and lightening agents work, but my hair looked so awful -- and it was orange! I went into work the following day, got reprimanded for the unnatural color (a definite no-no), and was told to have it normal by the next day. I went back to my old salon, and told them what happened, and they were able to salvage my color, and give me a more natural color, though the damage was done. My hair was brittle, thinner, and so unhealthy. I had spend hundreds of dollars getting this done, and had depleted my account trying to get this fixed. Needless to say, I couldn&#x27;t afford proper hair care treatments to help get my beautiful hair back.  Since that incident, I have finished my term in the military, and my hair has grown significantly, my roots showing my natural color -- but the lengths and ends of my hair still held damage. I couldn&#x27;t cut my hair without going against the hair code, so I simply had to trim as much as I could without having it too short or too long. I tried to research products that would help, hoping maybe I could fix the leftover hurt hair I had, without spending so much at ANOTHER salon. I found \\&quot;It&#x27;s a 10 Miracle\\&quot;, and bought the hair mask, as well as a purple shampoo for colored hair. THIS MIXTURE WORKED MIRACLES, GUYS. Oh my god, my hair, I had resultsshow after one use - just one. As I continued to shampoo one every 2-3 days, and used the hair mask every day. It&#x27;s been 4 months, and my hair has returned. The damage - gone. I have shine, hardly any frizz (weather permitting, mind you!), hardly any tangles, my hair is so soft, and I have BODY! It&#x27;s fantastic.  I then decided to bleach my hair completely. By myself, at home.  My blonde hair is ABSOLUTELY GORGEOUS. And guess what?! I continued to use the same regimen of shampoo and hair mask - and the results have been the same. I&#x27;m a beautiful blonde, and my hair feels so healthy. Though I know bleach can ruin hair - it feels as though it&#x27;s natural - and not damaged.  I will never, ever, use any different conditioner ever. I&#x27;m about to try the daily conditioner - seeing as how I can&#x27;t keep using my hair mask, or I&#x27;ll run out soon (haha) - but I will never, ever, ever, EVER use any different conditioner. Thank you Miracle 10.</li>
    <li> I love It&#x27;s a 10.  I use all of their products.  The only thing wrong is this big bottle.  It;s hard to hold and pump out product at the same time.  The product I used before this was in a big jar which was easy to handle.  I wish I could take the top off so I could put it a different container.</li>
    <li> I need to tell people about It&#x27;s a 10 shampoo, daily conditioner, and mask also the leave in product.  I have been coloring my hair since i was 23 I&#x27;m 51 now and my hair is extreamly long like 40 inches. It has been very hard to find products that will allow me to comb through my hair wet or dry.  This is the best so far It doesn&#x27;t suds up too much but cleans just fine and doesn&#x27;t strip away and make your hair squeeky dry.  I don&#x27;t have to use much so the cost is about the same, I have tried many many products and the thicker ones don&#x27;t help any more. Salon product too.  My hair is Not blow dried and it dries soft and silky and combs out wet and brushes out dry just fine.  If you have long hair Please try this one it isn&#x27;t real thick but something about it works so well. By the way I have my hair colored once a month roots only by a salon profesioal and always have.</li>
    <li> Great for color treated hair, however, you should leave it on for about 10 mins to see the difference. 3-5 mins won&#x27;t do much</li>
    <li> I love its a 10&#x27;s mask and have always bought it in the smaller flip top container at the salons, so I was SO EXCITED to find it in a larger pump version on amazon, however this has turned out to be the worst purchase I&#x27;ve ever made on amazon. It will no pump product out whatever you do, so I figured annoying but I&#x27;ll just unscrew the top to get to the product. Nope. This not a regular unscrew top. Its locked on there. When I tried dismanting the bottle from the top, I got the pump off. To my dismay there was no tube for the product to go up and get out of the pump like normal pump bottles. Long story short we eneded up having to take flat head screwdriver to get the top off...what a mess and totally not worth it.</li>
    <li> love it my hair is so soft</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this for several years....it is a great product!!!  Makes your hair feel great and I love the 17.5 oz bottle.</li>
    <li> I do not write reviews however this has been such a wonderful product I just have to say it has made my damaged hair very soft and shiny.</li>
    <li> This was recommended to me by a stylist and I&#x27;ve been using it ever since. Most of the time I use the cream &#x27;mask&#x27; in the shower after I wash my hair, but I love this spray in conditioner too. Makes your hair soft and silky and tangle free.</li>
    <li> Great treatment for dry or damaged hair! Recommended by my hairdresser. I plan on trying their other products.  Great for price. Pump is a little difficult to dispense product.</li>
    <li> i think it works well with damaged hair. it smells good also. after using this my hair is become really soft</li>
    <li> very expensive and did not detangle my hair</li>
    <li> Truly likes the way this product leaves my hair.  Love it.</li>
    <li> YES IT&#x27;S A MIRACLE!!!!&lt;br /&gt;the first bottle was very very effective. now i&#x27;m on 4th bottle and it doesn&#x27;t make huge difference...&lt;br /&gt;I am switching to sebastian line after this bottle. but so far, it&#x27;s doing me GOOOOOOOOOOOOD.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t had a haircut in over 5 months, and it&#x27;s because of this product. I kept getting dry hair and split ends here in San Antonio, even though we have a water softener. I couldn&#x27;t take it, I&#x27;ve always had healthy hair and I like having long hair! I started using this product about 6 mos ago, and as I said, I don&#x27;t have split ends or dry hair yet...in fact, I only thought about getting a haircut the other day because my hair is getting too long, it is bumping my elbows when it&#x27;s braided when I run, so I&#x27;m sold on this conditioner.</li>
    <li> I am pretty sure this is not the real product. It does not work as well as the one I bought from a salon.</li>
    <li> This is a great product but the pump doesn&#x27;t work. So I tried to open and had to use my husbands tools...</li>
    <li> I love this conditioner. It&#x27;s the only thing that works on my crazy knots. My hair is a mess so this is a lifesaver. Very thick conditioner that detangled and leaves the hair very soft.</li>
    <li> I have thick wavy hair and I live in a humid climate.  I use this as a leave in whether I let my hair dry naturally or decide to blow dry it straight.  Even though it is thick it doesn&#x27;t way my hair down and it keeps it soft and tames the frizz better than products I&#x27;ve tried specifically designed for that purpose. I use it everyday wet or dry and never let myself run out so the large size is perfect.</li>
    <li> It is a real 10 I would say plus an A+ they are good products. Expensive but worth it.</li>
    <li> If used infrequently, this product will give you great results but don&#x27;t use it often or it can make your hair very brittle.</li>
    <li> This is the best conditioner I have tried to date.  It makes my hair feel like silk.  Not the cheapest on the market but if you&#x27;ve tried others and haven&#x27;t gotten the results you&#x27;re after, this one is definitely worth a try.  I rarely give reviews but this one was worth my time!</li>
    <li> I have not been able to find a product to handle my thick long and curly hair. Best thing is that it works on all hair types. This is a product u don&#x27;t rinse right out, but u will need a plastic cap. For best results you should use heat and massage into scalp well. Great value, awesome product.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent conditioner for dry fly away hair.  I use it about once per week &amp; leave it in for about 5 minutes.  If I have the time, I&#x27;ll use it on my dry hair &amp; then wrap my hair in a shower cap.  Leave it on for about 1.5 to 2 hours &amp; then rinse.  It really makes my hair shine.  Love it!!</li>
    <li> My hair is dyed to cover up gray and also highlighted. I use a straightener on it also. My hair is pretty damaged but this product is truly a miracle. Just a little bit each time I wash my hair refurbishes my hair to make it feel so smooth and healthy again. The spray is also fabulous. Gets out every tangle without pulling out my hair. I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> I have been using this conditioner for about a year now and it keeps my hair healthy and strong.  My daughter who swims a lot during the summer also uses it and it works great to restore / protect her hair from the chlorine.</li>
    <li> I use it with the 10 conditioner.  It makes my dry, colored hair look good again.  I can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
    <li> This is a great value!  I prefer the pump version to the jar. I use it in the shower and sometimes before I blow dry.</li>
    <li> I have dry color-treated curly hair. This product is really a miracle for me. I used to have good success with other products, sitting 20 minutes with a shower cap under heat--but I never seem to find time for that anymore. This I put on about generously about once a week after shampooing, leave it on under a shower cap for anything from 20 minutes to an hour, and rinse out. Makes a big difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the Amazon price is fantastic when Amazon has it in the 17.5 fl oz containers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 17.5 fl oz container deserves a design award. Wonderfully easy to use pump, no mess. And it has a spring thing inside, so it literally pumps out every last bit of what&#x27;s in there, and when it&#x27;s used up, the pump stops. You can take the lid off, but there&#x27;s nothing left inside to get out. (May this design propagate to other products...)</li>
    <li> AMAZING! I love this conditioner. Not only that- but if you buy it at Target or a Salon, for the same price you&#x27;ll get a tiny little tub that lasts maybe a month. This stuff makes the driest, brittle hair soft- and I would know. Im a natural dark brunnette that keeps my hair baby blonde. Needless to say, its dry. And this conditioner makes it super soft, and like fresh uncolored hair again. I cant live without this conditioner! Usually I have to use two conditioners, leave them on ten minutes- and the results arent as good as just this one, for a minute. If you&#x27;re a color treated blonde, you MUST buy this!</li>
    <li> The product itself is great!  The container however leaves alot to be desired....  Overnight, over half of the conditioner leaked out in the shower.  Needs a better design.  I will buy it again and put it in another bottle!</li>
    <li> My hair is mixed brown/gray more gray than brown and has the fuzzy gray that you get.  This is the first product that calmed my grays!  I love it.  I bought it at Target first on sale based on reviews on here.  It really does work.  I don&#x27;t use it every day I use it every 4 days.  I wash my hair every other day and every other washing I use this.  I don&#x27;t use much and I leave it on for 10 minutes while I shower.  The first time I used it I did put it on for a half hour and wrapped it in plastic but I haven&#x27;t done that since.  It works great!</li>
    <li> I was first introduced to this product at a beauty salon. She used it after shampooing my hair, put a shower cap over my damp hair, and then set me under the dryer for 30 minutes. Back story: I had over-bleached and over-processed my hair to the point of having stretchy hair. I am a natural dark brunette, and had managed to get my hair to a platinum blonde color. I loved the color, but my hair health was down the drain. After using this product twice in a week, my hair felt wonderful and almost back to healthy! I had to purchase this product, even though it seems fairly expensive compared to what I normally buy - it is totally worth it!</li>
    <li> I have tried everything out there and this is by far my favorite! I have thick hair down to bottom and everytime I use this stuff I get so many compliments on it. I would recommend this to anyone I know! Definetely worth the extra money.</li>
    <li> by reading the reviews i can see that a lot of people love this stuff but it doesn&#x27;t work for my hair.  i have thick, coarse, wavy hair and this gives my hair too much body, makes it too poofy despite using a flat iron, and overall it&#x27;s just less manageable.  i prefer their deep conditioner with Keratin.</li>
    <li> My hair dresser uses this product line on me and I absolutely love it. I bought this along with some other products from It&#x27;s a 10 and my hair is so shiny and soft. It smells really good also and lasts a long time. I got this particular product for some of the ladies in my family who are blonde (not necessarily naturally so) and it really helps with the harsh treatments their hair goes through.</li>
    <li> HAPPY WITH THIS PRODUCT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I would recommend any of It&#x27;s a 10 products.  They are great for your hair, really makes it soft and smooth.</li>
    <li> Is not an authentic product.</li>
    <li> My hair got very badly damage since I did a Japanese straightening in a place that completely mess up my hair.&lt;br /&gt;The end were totally dry and frizzy, I tried many products to make my hair look better and to try to fix the damage.&lt;br /&gt;I stay with its a 10 miracle hair mask, I tried also the leave-I&#x27;m conditioner, but I think the hair mask has better results. Totally recommended for damaged hair.</li>
    <li> It works well but is very very hard to pump with wet hands in the shower.  The bottle is a hard plastic and is very slippery.  They should come up with a better delivery system for such a good product.</li>
    <li> Everyone is telling the truth, this really is one of the best hair products you can buy.  I use it once a week and it really adds some thickness back to your hair. Great if you have thinning hair and would like it to be less &amp;#34;whispy&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Highly recommended. Very well worth your money. Your hair will love it. And you my friend will not regret it.</li>
    <li> This mask is amazing&lt;br /&gt;I mean really really amazing after I washed my hair with it it gaves my hair a smooth touch and nice felling I recommend it certainly</li>
    <li> I have enough hair for about 4 people and it is coarse and frizzy.  This product helps make my hair lay flat and be shiny.  Great product.</li>
    <li> Best hair mask I&#x27;ve ever used! Larger size bottle is great for using in the shower too, much more convienient!</li>
    <li> this is better than the products that cost WAY more!! better than kerastase, any of that crap. this was recommended to me by a hairdresser and ive never looekd back</li>
    <li> The texture seems a little off (I use this product regularly so can tell when it&#x27;s different). Also there was NO PUMP TUBE inside the bottle so I had to take the bottle apart and store the conditioner in containers in order to use it.</li>
    <li> I received the shipment quick!  It was a great buy vs. shopping at Ulta and other beauty stores.  Would highly recommend!</li>
    <li> This product helps to repair my damaged hair drastically. My hair feels so soft and shiny right now. Big bottle saves a lot of money and can use for a year!</li>
    <li> its okay but definitely not the best hair mask ive used. Enjoy is a million times better, but its also more expensive. I find myself using more product to get it to work on my long hair compared to enjoy. It isnt bad, its just not wonderful.</li>
    <li> Moisturizes effectively &amp; smells great! I even use it on my 6-yr old daughter&#x27;s hair. A little pricey which is why i&#x27;m giving it 4-stars vs 5-stars.</li>
    <li> I am absolutely in love with this product.&lt;br /&gt;First of all- the pump is just the height of comfort, which says a lot, since this is one of the few hair masks/treatments that come this way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second- the scent is so nice, not too sweet, not too anything, and very delicate. Very relaxing, even.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Third- The most important thing of all: the actual hair treatment-&lt;br /&gt;Absolutely amazing. My hair is as soft as it is when I come back from the hair salon, after using this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> This was my main conditioner until I decided that highlights weren&#x27;t enough - I am going to bleach my own hair! What was I thinking? Once I did that, this conditioner was completely useless. I felt like crying...My hair must be REALLY damaged! I am now using products such as a recontructor designed for blonde hair, etc. My bleached hair has gotten better through treating the hair with multiple deep conditioning/leave-ins, along with salon keratin treatments. None of my home conditioners or shampoos are &#x27;its a 10&#x27; products right now - they did not work unfortunately.</li>
    <li> I purchased the deep conditioner previously and wanted to try the hair mask and scalp treatment.  As expected, another great 10 product!  Makes a noticeable difference to my hair and makes a sheen that my hair never had before.  It also doesn&#x27;t have any heavy perfume smells that other hair products have, but certainly makes a difference when used regularly.</li>
    <li> I just love the 10 miracle products they&#x27;re amazing the mask is no different!</li>
    <li> Great product. Not a fan of the pump, which clogs often due to the thickness of the conditioner. Gets through the tangles and leaves my coarse, curly hair feeling nourished.</li>
    <li> I have just purchased this product recently and used it three times so far, what can I say? I am stunned at the results! I have curly hair and if I let my hair air dry OH MY say Hellooo to Einstein&#x27;s sister! this product has totally eliminated the frizz and gave my hair silky smooth definition. Just like with other deep conditioners I usually leave a little bit on my ends but this one did wonders and the smell is Super!!!</li>
    <li> I usually used VO5 hot oil.  Then I switched to OPTIMUM deep conditioning masque.  My hair could look good for one or two days.  Now my hair can be easy to manage for DAYS after one use of this Miracle 10.  Plus, there is no hassle to use Miracle 10 vs. VO5 hot oil.  The pump bottle is a great design.</li>
    <li> Its really a miracle!</li>
    <li> I LOVE IT&#x27;S A 10!!!  HADN&#x27;T TRIED THIS PARTICULAR PRODUCT YET BUT I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS MASK!!!  HAIR FEELS AMAZING</li>
    <li> I love this 10 Hair Mask. It&#x27;s the best conditioning product I have found for my hair.</li>
    <li> Great product. Doesn&#x27;t weigh my wavy hair down, just gives great conditioning.</li>
    <li> Hands down the best product i have ever tried! I wish the price was lower, but you definitely get what you pay for.  I straighten my hair daily, and have very processed hair, and just leaving this product in my hair while i shower makes it silky smooth and the smell is enticing too. Anyone considering buying this and isn&#x27;t sure, NEEDS to stop thinking and just add it to your cart. definitely a miracle worker. will forever buy</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! Makes my hair so silky smooth and manageable. I really like it&#x27;s a 10 products! Good stuff!</li>
    <li> I have tried every product for my dry, thick, curly course hair. I have also gone to expensive salons for special treatments for my hair. Nothing has ever worked until I found Its a 10 products. I also use the shampoo and conditioner with keratin, the keratin moisturizer and serum. Now I am using this as another notch up 3 times a week. My hair has never felt so soft, and smooth. It shines, looks so healthy. No more dry damaged looking hair. I love this product. Its worth the price.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff and use a touch of it every time I wash my hair.  Hope they don&#x27;t ever stop making it!</li>
    <li> To rectify the poor hair dicisions I&#x27;ve recently made,  I have spent so much money on professional treatments and it was a waste! THIS, however, actually works. I use it up to 3-4 times a week (my hair is severely damaged up to the roots) and leave it in the 45 minutes......And it is so much cheaper on Amazon so don&#x27;t buy it at a store!</li>
    <li> I have been thru lots and lots of conditioners. I use heat to style my hair and it gets dried out by the hot summer sun. This product makes my hair easy to comb thru after I shower and makes it super soft. Although I can buy cheaper salon conditioners, I&#x27;m going to stick to this one because I love how it makes my fine hair feel without weighing it down.</li>
