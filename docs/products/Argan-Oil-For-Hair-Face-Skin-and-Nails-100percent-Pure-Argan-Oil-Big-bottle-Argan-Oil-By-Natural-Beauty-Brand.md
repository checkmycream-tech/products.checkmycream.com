<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This is a very nice, smooth product! My wavy hair is long and thick, and it tends to get a little frizzy, especially when it’s humid outside. The Argan Oil has done wonders—in just a week—with smoothing out my fly-aways and adding shine to my hair. I’m confident it will be the answer to my prayers in the upcoming summer heat!&lt;br /&gt;After reading some of the other reviews, I realized this product would be good for my face and skin as well. I’m now using it as a night-time moisturizer and even though it’s an oil, it doesn’t feel slick or greasy. I wake up with my face feeling soft, hydrated, and nourished.&lt;br /&gt;In addition to the beauty benefits, another great thing about the Argan Oil is that you won’t have to worry about what’s in it—as far as chemicals or potential allergens—because it’s an all-natural product. So if you’re looking for an excellent organic oil with multiple uses, this one is for you.</li>
    <li> Have been testing out this product for about 2 + weeks. Have used it on hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;really replenishes your hair &amp; moisturizes it. No greasy feel. I read other people saying they didn&#x27;t like the smell of this. But I personally do not smell anything and feel like it is odor free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried it on my face a couple of times and it really feels smooth and absorbs quickly. I read it is also good for eczema.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also like that it is 100% natural. Natural Beauty argan oil is pure and not diluted in anyway. So a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m pleased with this Argan Oil.  I used it to moisturize my hands and noticed that it was non-greasy and absorbed in quickly.  It does have a scent similar to olive oil.  I&#x27;m looking forward to trying it on my hair, as other reviewers have commented.</li>
    <li> Love this oil.  it&#x27;s a great moisturizer.  i use it all over as well as for problem areas.  i will purchase this item again</li>
    <li> Love this! I got this as a free promotional product, and I&#x27;m so glad I was invited to receive it.</li>
    <li> I ordered Argan Oil for the first time after hearing great things about it. I recieved the item quickly after I placed my order. I have used on my hair and it has made it a lot softer.  I have also used it as a moisturizer and can already see a difference. --Michele C</li>
    <li> This Argan oil is wonderful.  I&#x27;ve only been using it for a few days but I&#x27;m already in love.  I add a little bit to my to my body butter and it takes it up to another level.  Try it, you won&#x27;t regret it</li>
    <li> Just got my bottle today. I used a little on the ends of my hair.  I love the way it feels!  I was impressed at the speedy delivery. Ordered on Saturday - received on Tuesday.</li>
    <li> I have been a hair/skin product fanatic for as long as I can remember, so it was no surprise that argan oil was a must-have on my to-do list. I tend to lean more toward natural products as they seem to work better for me so Natural Beauty’s Organic Argan Oil sounded ideal. Three years back, I decided it’d be a good idea to dye my hair blonde...with hydrogen peroxide and a lot of heat. I also straightened my hair every day. Needless to say, it’s still damaged and dry. I’ve tried every strengthening hair product in the book, but have found that very few seem to have any effect at all. As I had mentioned before, I am a strong believer that natural products are more effective than chemical-based products, so I had high expectations for the argan oil. The directions read, “Appy 1-2 pumps to hand and massage into where you need to apply.” I applied two pumps to the ends of my hair (as I have terrible split ends) and noticed it looked very greasy. Fortunately, after a few minutes, my hair soaked the oil right up. If you don’t have dry hair I suggest only using one pump. Of course, this varies to suit each person’s hair length, volume, etc. (I have thin, mid-length hair and am basing my review off of that.) Argan oil is also supposedly very beneficial for your skin. Well, consider this myth busted! It serves as an excellent moisturizer- certainly better than any store-bought one. But along with any other oil, there is a slightly greasy residue. I don’t typically face any issues with dry hands so that may be the reason behind that (so those of you who do, you may be in luck). However, I do face issues with chapped lips and dry facial skin. I have yet to test the oil out on my face, but it works wonders as a chap stick (or chap oil in this case?). I’ve seen reviews regarding the smell of the oil and figured I’d add my input on that as well. Personally, I didn’t expect the oil to smell like flowers- it’s oil. Some people seem surprised by this. It smells a bit musky when it’s in the bottle, but as soon as you put it on your skin or in your hair, the smell disappears. Another pro of the oil is that a small amount goes a long way. Now, this could be good or bad, depending upon how it is used. Naturally, if you drench your hair in oil, it will be greasy. Luckily, all you need is a dime sized drop or two and you’re set! Overall, this is a must-have product, just as I had expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: My face has been very dry as of lately, and the oil works wonders on it! Better than any facial moisturizer I&#x27;ve ever bought.lls a bit musky when it’s in the bottle, but as soon as you put it on your skin or in your hair, the smell disappears.

    <li> I have very long and very thick wavy hair that needs TLC. After this harsh winter it had become hay like, dry and brittle and with splitting ends. In the process of searching for coconut oil on amazon, I came across organic argan oil. Having used to coconut oil for years as a before shower massage oil and after shower leave in conditioner, the reviews here and various other sites tempted me to try this product. I saw the results faster than anticipated (compared to my usual coconut oil). It is no longer lifeless and I let down my hair instead of tying it up to hide it.&lt;br /&gt;I also have very dry skin so I used it on my legs as a tester. The skin did not flak even after wearing skinny jeans for 7 hours. I needed a reapplication before bed. I have never got a &amp;#34;no flakes with skinny jeans&amp;#34; result with any moisturizers for very dry skin so far. So this is promising.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-Only few drops are needed. I use just enough quantity till my skin absorbs it and hair gets the slightest shine and detangles. This way I don&#x27;t look &amp;#34;oiled&amp;#34; at work.&lt;br /&gt;-Visible changes on my hair and skin after short term use. This could be because of the harsh winter and my very dry hair and skin. I hope it reduces the frizz in summer too.&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-I wish it was odorless. But it is an oil and I do not want them to add any additives to it either.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve read about argan oil for ages and final jumped in and bought some to use on my skin. I&#x27;ve been chemical free for make-up/hair/etc for about a year now but miss having a lightweight serum to use at night and in the mornings. This oil is lovely. It absorbed into my face and neck quickly and didn&#x27;t leave me feeling oily. There is a bit of scent when you sniff the bottle, but that odor does not carry over when you apply it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only use a few drops, maybe a total of half a dropper full (but not all at once!) and rub it in, so this bottle will last a while. I rub the excess into my hands. I&#x27;m a gardener/pruner/chicken keeper and work with my hands in gloves and dirt most of the day, my hands are typically chapped and rough from the dirt and scrubbing. A couple days of applying the oil to my face and rubbing the extra into my hands and my hands are softening up and becoming much smoother.</li>
    <li> Awesome product!!! I love it I been using it for a week now and it doesn&#x27;t weight my hair down or leave it all greasy!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d been curious about Argan oil for some time &amp; finally decided to order a bottle.  It arrived quickly, the bottle is huge and the scent was more subtle than what I was expecting based on reviews of other products.  I mixed some up with essential oils to use for face cleansing &amp; moisturizing on a trip.  I love this stuff!  My skin is so soft &amp; I&#x27;ll be looking for more ways to use this great product!</li>
    <li> I used the link for my free 4 oz bottle of Argan Oil, and wasn&#x27;t expecting a &amp;#34;good&amp;#34; quality of oil.  I was WRONG!  The oil is very nice and the quality high.  I use it on my hair ends, and on my face and neck.  It&#x27;s wonderful!</li>
    <li> I received a complimentary offer of this oil but it is one that I had been reading about for sometime so I was familiar with this oil. There are certain raw materials that one can implement that really can make a difference in skin care. The choice of carrier oil for the face is one that I am rather finicky about and argan oil is a superior choice for this application. I have not been using it long enough to do a proper review but I can speak on several points. First off is the offer, this is clever marketing and valuable to not only the company but to the participants. A complimentary introduction to a product that might be otherwise overlooked is genius, I am certainly grateful for the opportunity to try this exciting product. Communication with the company has been very timely and thorough, instructions have been clear and concise, and follow through was explemplary.  My package shipped and arrived at my door within three days. The product is a generous 4 fl ounces with a dropper applicator making it easy to dispense. The labeling is well thought out and for the most part consumer friendly. The oil is clear amber with a slight fruity nutty odor that fades quickly upon application to the skin. The oil itself is non-greasy and soaks readily into the skin making it ideal for facial applications where makeup and foundation will be applied after use of the oil. In fact the oil tends to smooth out the skin naturally allowing for a beautiful, free-flowing base upon which to apply make up.  I am also using it for my nails and cuticle care. As a gardener my hands suffer from being in the dirt and dryness to the cuticles is always a concern. After three days use there are signs of improvement to the skin condition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now for some critique: I would like to see the official certification for the organic certification listed on the product and your website. I would also like to see your website show more about the extraction process; perhaps a few more photographs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, that&#x27;s about it. Thanks for the complimentary and generous sample. I am enjoying it very much and wish your company all the best as you move forward with this wonderful product.</li>
    <li> Just what I needed.  Will be coming back with a better review after I&#x27;ve been able to use it more.</li>
    <li> I love the oil for my face. I can tell that is helping with wrinkles by moisturizing my face. Thanks for the opportunity to try this great oil….Connie S</li>
    <li> I love the Aryan Oil.  I use it on my face and it makes my face very soft and moisturized.  I also use it on my hands and love how it makes them feel.</li>
    <li> Rubbed a few drops into my hands they were soft and smooth even the next day. Very nice, no scent.</li>
    <li> My wife loves it! Great product! Will definitely buy again! Easy to use and no scent, happy camper here! Yay</li>
    <li> I have spent so much on various skin and hair products and will never do that again! I found everything I need in this ONE Fantastic Oil! Just a couple drops after a shampoo makes my hair tangle free, silky and shiny! I use a drop on my face as a moisturizer and it actually also helped get rid of my blemishes. I love it! It is organic so I don&#x27;t need to worry about harmful chemicals penetrating my skin. And There is a LOT in this bottle. The bottle is HUGE! You only need a few drops for a thick head of hair and only one drop for your face! I will never use anything else now that I have found this! Great Seller and Great Product!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using it on my hair for a week now. I&#x27;ve noticed a change in the texture of my hair, but nothing outstanding. Also, I hardly use much of it, and it still leave my hair quite oily. It doesn&#x27;t absorb the hair like others stated. Maybe I&#x27;m doing something wrong.... Not sure. I&#x27;ll update later if anything changes. One things for sure though, my hair doesn&#x27;t frizz much anymore.</li>
    <li> I received a complimentary bottle to try and review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; First the negative:I didn&#x27;t know much about the product and how to use it so I decided to check out the website that is printed on the bottle. No luck, the search got me nowhere, so I did a Google search of the company and still came up empty. But, I&#x27;m a risk taker so I proceeded to use the product anyway. A separate Google search gave me some good ideas on how to use the Argan oil on my face, skin and hair. This brings me to negative number 2: If you have thin, fine hair like I do, do not try to use this product as a &amp;#34;shine enhancer&amp;#34;. I rubbed a small bit into my freshly washed, dry hair and the result was a disgusting mess. It looked like I washed my hair in an oil slick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, by now you&#x27;re probably wondering why the four-star review. Here&#x27;s why: Every other test I put the product through was fabulous. I have very dry, cracked heels. After one application I saw a noticeable difference in the softness of my feet. I also rubbed some oil into my hands. Not only were the palms of my hands soft, it drastically reduced the occurrences of hang nails. Generally I get contend with tons of hang nails in between manicures so this was a nice change. I also tried the product on my face. The result was fantastic. It made the skin on my face soft without feeling oily. I actually felt like I had a dewy glow. The only real downside of putting it on my face is that I had to wait awhile before applying makeup or it would be streaky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My next test of the product is going to be as a lip balm. I found a great recipe that combines brown sugar, vanilla and the Argan oil. I can&#x27;t wait to see how it works!</li>
    <li> I received this bottle of 100% organic Argan oil as a free promotion, in the interest of disclosure. I&#x27;ve only had the bottle for three days, but I love it so far.  I have the world&#x27;s worst cracked, peeling heels, and despite conscientious use of other products designed for use with this problem have only had so-so results.  After three days of using the Argan oil on my heels the difference is surprisingly noticeable!  I also have used it on dry skin on my arms and legs and it absorbs well, with little greasy feeling afterwards. I used it in my hair as a conditioner--I normally have an oily scalp but the dry indoor heat this winter has made my hair feel coarse and brittle.  Having read some other reviews which said it left their hair greasy, I used only a tiny amount and after rinsing, my hair had a noticeably nicer feel to it with a bit of shine.  I plan to incorporate this oil into my facial regime and will report back after I&#x27;ve had it longer.  Finally, there was excellent customer service contact and response.  Very pleased with product so far.</li>
    <li> Thank you for this free offer.  The oil feels wonderful on my skin.  I cannot wait to try it in my bath and beauty products.</li>
    <li> From the photo I didn&#x27;t realize just how BIG this bottle is!  I have already used this as a carrier oil for my essential oils, as a moisturizer for my face, and a smoothing agent for my hair, and on freshly shaved legs!  It has a very mild scent, a little goes a long long way.  I am very impressed!  I have recommended to my friends and can&#x27;t wait to find even more uses for it!</li>
    <li> Received my bottle 3 days ago and I just love the quality of this oil. I only need a couple of drops for my skin and it leaves it feeling really nice and soft. I will be using it in a face serum ... Can&#x27;t wait to get it mixed :)</li>
    <li> I received my oil and used it the first day on my neck and was amazed at how good it works. In just one application my skin felt softer and the effects were still felt the next day, and no greasy feeling like you can get with some products. I can&#x27;t wait to see the improvement after I have used it for a couple of weeks. Love the fact that it is a natural oil. Will update this review again. This product is a five star all the way!</li>
    <li> I took advantage of this great offer and received my free bottle of Argan oil. It is lovely on my face, as a treatment for my hair, and wonderful as a boost to my moisturizer. I am very impressed, and will continue to purchase from now on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for the great opportunity to try it!</li>
    <li> I received this Argan oil as a free promotion. First of all my order was received two days after my order was placed. I&#x27;m currently using this product on my face at night time and I really love it. Very light, not greasy at all. I think this will work great in a facial cream, so I&#x27;ll be formulating one. That you, very much for the invitation. This is a luxurious skin-loving oil.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting to much from a free bottle, but what the heck it was free and I was going to try it. Turns out this is a great product, it absorbs into skin quickly and does not leave a greasy feeling. My skin feels much softer for using this.</li>
    <li> I wanted this argan oil to use as a carrier for my essential oils but have only used it for eczema so far.&lt;br /&gt;It works wonders! I&#x27;ve never had a product work so well after applying only 3 times (before bed, when I woke up, after washing dishes). I&#x27;m confident that this outbreak will be cleared up in no time with this oil, it certainly has worked better than dermatologist prescribed treatments. As a bonus, my hands are silky smooth.</li>
    <li> I received this a few days ago and used some on my hands. It soaked in well and left my hands feeling very soft. I will be using this in some lotion that I will make soon. Great product!</li>
    <li> I love this Argon oil! I color my hair frequently so Im constantly fighting damage. The first time I used this oil, i used about 7 drops on my hair while it was wet. When my hair dried, it looked shinier and healthier! I wish I would have tried it sooner!</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t beat that it&#x27;s organic and natural.  Very light and non-greasy.  Great absorption.  Light nutty aroma.  I&#x27;m always impressed to see detailed labels that go above and beyond industry standards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s FREE of paraben, fragrance, colorant, and alcohol.  No animal ingredients.  No preservatives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great customer service and communication.  I&#x27;ll be back.</li>
    <li> Helps with  brittle nails and hair.Just apply a small amount straight from the bottle and rub in. So easy to use.</li>
    <li> First, when I was told I would get a free sample, I expected something like a 15 ml bottle.  Noooo!!!  I got a 4 ounce bottle!  And when I tried the Argan Oil, it was the best I had ever used (and I have used Argan Oil from 4 or more companies).  I highly recommend Natural Beauty Brand Incorporated&#x27;s 100% Pure Argan Oil.  You will NOT be disappointed!  Worried about price?  Trust me, you get what you pay for!  This is the best Argan Oil I have ever used!</li>
    <li> I received this argan oil so that I could review it. Even so, I am pleased with this product. Before this product I&#x27;d never tried 100% just mixed products. This product feels great on the skin and sinks in beautifully. I plan to try this also in some of my hair products very soon. Give it a try. Its definitely worth the money.</li>
    <li> I received a free bottle of this argan oil for a promotion and first I want to say the bottle is HUGE. It will last forever! Secondly, it&#x27;s not greasy or oily at all. I&#x27;ve done a bit of research on just how many uses there are for argan oil and it seems endless. Hair, face, cuticles, dry skin, stretch marks, etc.! I use it mostly for my heat damaged hair and stretch marks and with what&#x27;s left on my hands, I massage into my cuticles. It&#x27;s been great so far. The entire bottle and dropper inside are GLASS so you have to be careful.</li>
    <li> I used to live in Morroco for 5 years on a business venture and I used argan oil locally all the time.&lt;br /&gt;This is not real argan oil. It is mixed with another oil or extremely diluted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t be fooled by the cheap price. You get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> Pleasant product. Made my hair feel smooth and soft when applied. Did soften my cuticles. All in all it was an ok product.</li>
    <li> Straight out of the bottle this felt wonderful on my face. Non greasy &amp; soaked in to my skin immediately.&lt;br /&gt;Made a facial lotion &amp; testing now. First impression is that the lotion is super moisturizing with a non greasy feel.&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t wait to try in a hair serum</li>
    <li> I love it !! I used it on my daughters and my hair and it&#x27;s wonderful. It&#x27;s light and free</li>
    <li> I was not very familiar with Argan Oil before I received this.  I am an RN - which means we clean our hands frequently (before and after each patient contact). I had just worked 3 12-hour shifts and my hands were dry - especially around the cuticles  - with dry pieces of skin below the nails.  I put one small drop onto my hands, rubbed into the nail beds and the remaing oil all over my hands.  that was all that was needed - the dryness went away immediately - I haven&#x27;t needed to re-apply any thing else - no hand lotions, oils or creams - at all!  my hands are dry skin free with shiny nails (I don&#x27;t use nail polish).  I have also used this oil (just one drop) on my hair to smooth it and add shine - it works wonderfully!!I received this product in exchange for an unbiased review.</li>
    <li> I received a complimentary bottle to review. Shelf life says 3 years. I just bought a second bottle.    I am so tired of these reviews that say \\&quot;best product ever\\&quot; bla bla bla.  Not helpful. WHY is it the best brand ever?  I&#x27;m old, cynical, &amp; cheap...  If there were argan trees in my area, you bet I would hike up the mountain to harvest that stuff myself rather than buy it.  Both ways in the snow, hail, sandstorm,  errr...  I&#x27;m in California, so that would be... sandstorms, fires, mountain lions, tigers and bears...    1. BIG bottle: So many of these products look big in the photos, but the reviews all say that the actual product was some chintzy little bottle.  Not this one. This is a 4 oz bottle. A full 4 oz bottle.    2. Aroma: I can&#x27;t smell anything. Ok, like really faint olive oil. Granted, I like patchouli, blue cheese, natto, and generous portions of curry powder, so subtle scents don&#x27;t stand out.    3. Mixability: Excellent. I added a few drops of the Argan Oil on a plate, then added my custom EO blend. Sometimes, when you add EO to another oil or lotion, it changes for the worse. The Argan Oil worked well with several blends - earthy stuff, and foo foo flowery stuff too.    4. Application Device: Glass dropper. No different that the plastic droppers.    5. Use:  Makeup remover/moisturizer. Frizzy hair tamer. Extender of essential oils.    6. Oiliness: Medium. Baby oil is just greasy, and those dry oils disappear in a few minutes. This is in the middle, toward the dry end. It soaks it to your skin. You can still see the sheen, but it doesn&#x27;t come back out and stain your clothes.    7. Compared to other Argan oil brands: Waaaay better. 1 smelled burnt. 1 smelled like castor oil. 1 had the texture of apricot oil.  Did I do extensive research as to where these are harvested, how they are processed? No. I&#x27;ve had a few small bottles of Argan oil in the past 2 years. Was not impressed.  However, this time, this brand, it works.    8. Sometimes, Amazon reviews getmixed up. This is for a 4 oz bottle.  [...]</li>
    <li> I received my free bottle of Argan Oil and love the way it is non-greasy and will be using it with the products I will be making with my essential Oils</li>
    <li> Hey guys who ever buys this just remember this that it won&#x27;t work at all it is just the worst product ever I have seen</li>
    <li> I got my free trial of Argan Oil, two weeks ago. I love this product. I use it after showering to moisturize skin, the best thing is that it does not leave a nasty residue like other products I have used.</li>
    <li> Im an African American woman with type 4abc natural hair. Its a coarser texture so its dificult to maintain a shine. This product has changed that! It has such an eye striking shine its unbelievable,  I&#x27;ve never seen anything like it.  I use it to seal my hair after co washing and as a heat protectant before blow drying. Works great both ways.  The dropper gjves maximum control and dosent leak. I try to only put natural products in my hair and this 100% Argan Oil is the truth...no carrier or essential oils sneaked in....just 100% pure Argan Oil.</li>
    <li> This was my first experience with argan oil and I was very impressed!  For years, I&#x27;ve only used natural oils and butters to moisturize my skin, and while I was thankful to know my skin wasn&#x27;t absorbing artificial chemicals and preservatives, most oils would leave my skin, well...oily.  I accepted this as just part of using oils as moisturizers, but was pleasantly surprised when I tried argan oil.  It still did leave a bit of oiliness, but it was much less than all the other oils I&#x27;ve tried.  Also, the dropper inside made it much easier to not get too much.  Definitely a great product!</li>
    <li> I have been using Josie Maran&#x27;s argon oil for quite some time now.  Her&#x27;s is organic and free of chemicals. But it&#x27;s also very expensive and comes in a smaller bottle.  I found this Natural Beauty product on a facebook offer and decided to try it.  It was a bigger bottle than what I was used to but it was also a lot cheaper.  Being on a one income basis, that was music to my ears.  I have tried it and I love it.  It feels great on my skin.  Definitely purchasing again once this bottle is gone.  I now can enjoy my favorite oil and not worry so much about the expense.</li>
    <li> I love the lightness of the oil and the way it seems to soak into my skin immediately.  After a few minutes I had forgotten about it.  Later I felt of my hand and it felt very smooth where I had applied it.  I will be using this as a nice facial oil at night for lines and wrinkles.  Thank you for letting me test this product and finding out how good it really is!</li>
    <li> This oil is wonderful! We make many skin care products at our Natural soap company, Natures Art, and we tested this in our cuticle oil, hair oil, handmade lotions and even in some of our soap blends. Performed beautifully! We highly recommend this for all your skin care needs!</li>
    <li> I recieved the oil yesterday..tried it today and i Love it!!!!  thank you so much for this wonderful offer !!!!</li>
    <li> i have only used the product once, as i just recieved it yesterday, but my skin felt amazingly soft after just a few drops. It seems to be a good product  but what I am even more impressed with is the company&#x27;s public relations. I would buy products from them based on that alone.</li>
    <li> Been using it for over a month now. I use it on my hair and face. I found that a little bit goes a long way. Just a drop or two to moisturise my face and about a teaspoon full for my hair. I use it on my hair right after I wash it and it&#x27;s still wet, then let it air dry. I&#x27;ve noticed that my hair has a lot more volume and it&#x27;s not as dry as it use to be. Absolutely love it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve suffered from severe spring allergies this year and have a raw nose and chapped face because of it.  I carry this oil in my purse and use it for instant relief.  Day and night use has brought mega healing to my sensitive skin.  Fantastic product!</li>
    <li> The first thing I used this for...my ultimate test...was on my dry heels. Applied a thin coat and put on socks. It absorbed easily and really conditioned them! First application! I make my own lotion that does a pretty good job, but the Argan oil does an even better job! Elbows, cuticles...same thing. I haven&#x27;t yet used it on my hair because my hair isn&#x27;t dry.&lt;br /&gt;I think I may even add it to my personal lotion formula.&lt;br /&gt;Try this fabulous oil and you will see the difference.</li>
    <li> I was addicted to this stuff from hello!  It is definitely an anti-ager; my face looked years younger with the first application; not just because of dryness but also helped the firmness and lines.  It&#x27;s a very nice, soothing oil for all over the body, even if you have skin issues as I do (psoriasis and sensitive skin).&lt;br /&gt;It is a nice big bottle, but already I am running low after a few weeks.  That&#x27;s because I use it all the time, but it can be mixed with your favorite lotion for all over your body, which will conserve your supply a little.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t really use it on my hair, although I know a lot of people do.  It&#x27;s good to work this into your nails and nailbeds also, a very nice conditioner for nails.</li>
    <li> Typically, I apply Argan oil immediately to the scalp of my daughters&#x27; hair after washing. I then brush, comb, and style as normal. About midweek I reapply a little of the oil as I redo their hair and brush it up into a style. A little bit of the oil seems to goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The oil works great on our skin too, the dry patches that we used to have are no longer there. The oil is light and not greasy. The best part of the oil is that is only has one ingredient: pure organic argan oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A complete review of this product was originally published on CleverlyChanging (dot) com.</li>
    <li> I and my girlfriend have been putting this on everything from paper cuts to razor burn to odd injuries alike and it&#x27;s been amazing at healing! Even with the intended uses, moisturizer and protectant, it&#x27;s amazing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would, honestly, recommend this product to everyone. It&#x27;s a heal-all and put on everything oil that makes whatever its on better.</li>
    <li> I was surprised to see that someone would be offering a product free of charge for a promotional tool and doubted I would actually receive.  Not only did I receive it but I was very happy with the packaging and the product.  I have only used it on my hands so far but I am very much looking forward to including it a soap recipe.</li>
    <li> I am really enjoying this oil as a skin and hair conditioner. I have extremely long, thick hair, and have been shampoo- and \\&quot;bottle\\&quot; conditioner-free for seven or eight years. Generally I use coconut or olive oil to keep the length and ends conditioned.&lt;br /&gt;I received a bottle of this lovely stuff as a gift. I had not heard of it before, but my sister highly recommended it. I tried it for the first time today-- it has an almost olive-like smell, somehow both mild and rich at the same time. I bet it would be a wonderful carrier for sandalwood. It was heavier than I expected in terms of viscosity, but that&#x27;s not a bad thing. Like coconut oil, it warms and thins when you put a few drops in your palm and rub them briskly together. It feels great on my skin, too; not at all greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re new to oiling your hair, try skipping the conditioner in the shower. Instead, warm a few drops of argan oil, rubbed in your palms, and first run your hands over the bottom few inches of your hair. Move up, continuing to smooth your palms over and through your hair, keeping your hands and hair moving so you don&#x27;t get too much oil in one spot. Lastly, when you think there&#x27;s almost no oil left on your palms, smooth your scalp. Then comb as normally, finishing with a soft bristle brush. I&#x27;ve only been using this oil a few days, but I really am surprised at how satiny my hair feels. I didn&#x27;t have any complaints with the coconut or olive oil, and to be honest, didn&#x27;t expect much difference. It really is great stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, evidently Argan trees are UNESCO protected. I hope the high per-ounce cost of Argan oil is reflective of fair trade practices and support for the small biosphere which grows these trees. If so, it&#x27;s worth every penny!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thumbs up, I really love this stuff!</li>
    <li> For complete disclosure I received this product for free. However with that being said I love this product!  It is basically odorless. Some lower quality argan oil has a bad scent which is not normal and is a sign of low quality. This oil is very light and quickly absorbs in completely within seconds!  I use it straight up on my face and there is no oily residue. I also have been using this in my hair blended with emu oil for my very dry natural curly hair but it could be used straight up for people with normal or less dry hair without weighing it down. I would have given this product 5 stars except for the packaging. It is a glass bottle which is fine because it is amber which helps keep the oil protected and is sturdy. However it also includes a glass dropper which I love because you only need drops of it. But the dropper leaks oil. Mine dropper doesn&#x27;t seem to have a good seal in it and I haven&#x27;t been able to fix it. When I pull some oil up into the dropper it will leak drops without me squeezing.  For this reason I have it 4 stars. Overall the oil is amazing and very quality!  Can&#x27;t wait to make a facial serum with it and maybe a face soap!</li>
    <li> My Argan Oil arrived today and I was very satisfied with the size of the bottle I received.  I immediately opened it and sampled it on my skin.  It left my hands and legs feeling extremely smoothe without being oily and that&#x27;s what I love.  My main use for this product will be for my hair as I have extreme frizz and other reviews state this Argan Oil helps to combat that.  Thank You for supplying me with this free AMPLE sample of your product.</li>
    <li> This oil is awesome. I noticed my face glowing when I use it the previous night. Just 2 drops not more. My little one calls it the glow oil ! I also use it on hair after blow drying. Doesn&#x27;t grease the hair.</li>
    <li> I have used Argan  Oil before and I love it. I use it on my face, hands and hair, and this one was as great as I expected to be. The price was good too. Happy buy</li>
    <li> This oil is not 100% argan oil as described.  Dried out my hair and left it feeling damaged.  Maybe I will just use it on my skin...</li>
    <li> Let me state up front that I received a complimentary bottle to review, and I&#x27;ve liked the argan oil. I&#x27;ve been using it for a little over a week now, and have several thoughts on the whole product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-It doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy residue behind, which is my biggest peeve about most oils and lotions. My hands get chapped and dry to the point of bloodiness during dry months, but I avoid most traditional lotions because of their residue. I was able to use three drops of this oil and rub it in without feeling greasy or unable to grip things without leaving a mess, yet I could immediately see a difference in my skin. It&#x27;s been a relief to have found a non-greasy moisturizer that helps my hands feel better.&lt;br /&gt;-The bottle itself comes with a dropper, which minimizes the mess of oil from having to pour. With this, you just lift the dropper out, use a few drops of oil, and put the dropper back in--all without oil getting everywhere. It&#x27;s nice and contained, keeping the bottle clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-I saw that other reviewers commented on the smell (one said it had a slightly sweet smell), and I was actually surprised by the smell. As soon as I sniffed it (because, let&#x27;s face it, who doesn&#x27;t smell their lotions or oils first?), I recoiled a little because the intial whiff was a bit stinky. It&#x27;s not terrible, or even really bad, but it&#x27;s just a mild unpleasant smell, I thought. However, it goes away almost immediately after you rub it into your skin. It wouldn&#x27;t detract me from using the oil, but it was something I noticed enough that I think it important to mention here.&lt;br /&gt;-The dropper is glass, which makes me afraid to break it by not putting it back into the bottle carefully enough. I don&#x27;t know that a plastic or rubber dropper would be better, though, as I don&#x27;t know how the texture would interact with the oil and I do know that the glass will clean easily, but I still worry about breaking the glass.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the whole, I&#x27;m satisfied with this product and will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve actually known about argan oil for several years and this is the third brand that I&#x27;ve purchased.  I&#x27;m happiest with my argan oil from  this brand for a variety of reasons.  First of all, you get a huge bottle for your money.  A tiny drop goes a long way.  I feel like this bottle is going to last me just about forever!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also I find that this particular argan oil is very high quality. It goes on very smoothly and I can see the moisturizing effect on my face right away. I also found that it immediately helped with chapped lips. I definitely appreciate the anti-aging effects of this product. I so prefer it over regular moisturizer as it has no annoying scent and is free of chemicals found it almost every other anti-aging oil that I would use on my face.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product on my daughter&#x27;s scalp. She has seborrhea, which is an aggressive and moist form of dandruff. I have found products that dry it out but those products dried it out too much causing damage to her scalp, as well as severe hair loss. I have gotten her hair to grow back over time and started using the Argan Oil on her scalp. This oil moisturizes properly without being too oily and without feeding the dandruff. She has reported less itching and less scalp pain. I love this product. It makes her hair soft and easy to manage and it has helped make her more comfortable. I would recommend this product for hair and skin. It is a remarkably oil-free oil.</li>
    <li> Used in a facial serum...so light and non-greasy. For the AMAZING price, I can use just a bit more, though it&#x27;s so effective I don&#x27;t need to! Look forward to ordering more. Love the convenience of the dropper lid.</li>
    <li> I put just a few drops on each hand, didn&#x27;t feel greasy at all and left my hands feeling very soft and not at all greasy...I&#x27;m looking forward to seeing how this feels on my face!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for the free sample,&lt;br /&gt;This very good quality!!</li>
    <li> Thank you for the free argon oil. I haven&#x27;t used it much yet but I&#x27;m sure I will find a lot of ways to use it.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with this product. I have very thick frizzy hair, and am always looking for something to tame the mane.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From the moment the oil touches your hand, it&#x27;s obvious this product is different.  It lacks the silicone, slippery feel of most &amp;#34;argan&amp;#34; oils.&lt;br /&gt;This oil grips and coats the hair shaft. A little really does go along way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To give this an honest try I used it after my normal shower routine, with no added conditioners or treatments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was amazed. Typically require a silicone solution and a heavy hold hairspray to keep my frizz under control.&lt;br /&gt;This product did it all!&lt;br /&gt;You have to beware not to use too much as it can make the hair look greasy,  but oone a person gets used to using less product than normal, this isn&#x27;t an issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also tried it on my very dry legs. At first I was unimpressed.... that is until the next day! My legs were so silky and smooth I was proud to have people touch them! For me it seems to work best for me to put it on at night and really let it do its magic as I sleep.</li>
    <li> I have never used Argan oil before so I have no comparison.  However,  I am a soapmaker and have used numerous oils and butter. This is definitely an oil that I will incorporate into my formulations. I did not notice any odor and the oil quickly absorbed into my skin. The end feeling was very soft and silky. I cant wait to try it in facial soaps. I must also include that I was provided a coupon code so I received this product for free. While I think this is a great product, as a soap and skincare manufacturer, I would never pay this much for a 4oz bottle of argan oil. So great prduct, but not so much at a great value.</li>
    <li> Bottle&#x27;s plastic cap was cracked upon receipt. Some product had spilled into the completely inadequate paper bubble mailer. Oil is good. lightweight, easily absorbed, low odor. I have been using Macadamia Oil hair products and will continue to do so since the Argan oil hasn&#x27;t helped my hair as much as Macadamia, but it does well for my face and skin overall so I will continue to use for this purpose.</li>
    <li> I have been using Argan Oil on my face for a while now.  I just tried this brand.  I like that it is organic as I try to use as many organic products as possible.  It feels really soothing on my skin.  It soaks in quickly so it doesn&#x27;t interfere with putting on makeup.  In reading the reviews, I will try on my nails and my hair as both could use some help. I&#x27;ll add some essential oils for a serum for my dry hands and feet.  Overall a great product.  I would buy it again.</li>
    <li> I put a few drops in my hands and apply it to my wet hair and then blow dry it, but it leaves your hair feeling heavy and looks like it hasn&#x27;t been washed for a few days/weeks. I really don&#x27;t see any shine to it, it just look like I haven&#x27;t washed my hair for days.</li>
    <li> I just got my argan oil yesterday and I love how little I have to use to actually moisturize my hands!  It&#x27;s great that it only has one ingredient (argania spinosa kernel oil), and they&#x27;re right… a little really does go a long way.  The directions tell you to use 1 to 2 pumps, but I just use 3 tiny drops to rub into my hands and I&#x27;m liking how my skin feels.  If I use more than that, I end up having to rinse the excess off my hands, so I just stick with my few drops and am going to be working my way through this bottle for quite a while I&#x27;m sure. I&#x27;m glad it has a shelf life of 3 years, otherwise it might go bad before I use it all haha.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does absorb pretty quickly and, if you find out the right amount for you, you won&#x27;t notice any greasiness left behind.  In fact, I just rubbed 3 drops into my hands about a minute before I started typing this, and I feel no grease on my fingertips as I&#x27;m typing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And it does say that it&#x27;s fragrance-free, but obviously argan oil has its own natural scent because I smell a mild sweetness when I use it.  It&#x27;s not a girly smell, but it definitely has that natural, organic smell to it… like you&#x27;re walking through an aisle in Whole Foods or something.  I&#x27;m liking it so far though… the more natural products I use the better!</li>
    <li> I moved to OK from CA and ever since I have, my skin has been&lt;br /&gt;incredibly dry. It was ridiculous. None of the lotions I tried had any effect. But I applied the argan oil, just a tiny amount, and instantly my skin felt baby smooth. And what&#x27;s more, is that it was still smooth a week later, without me even using it again. It&#x27;s amazing! But now, after reading the other reviews, I&#x27;m thinking I might go ahead and try other uses. Next step, let&#x27;s see how it&#x27;ll work mixed with my shampoo...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Awesome product, I love it!</li>
    <li> This oil is great for making natural soap and lotions! Thanks for letting me try it free!! The long lasting results are awesome!</li>
    <li> This stuff is a miracle oil. My dry, split ends have become soft again. My skin has an amazing glow to it and neither feel oily in the slightest. I will be buying this product over and over again.</li>
    <li> Honestly like others have said I was too shocked how big the bottle was when it arrived. But my wife loves this product</li>
    <li> I first became aware of Argan oil 3 years ago at an Emmy event. In my gift bag was a bottle of Argan oil.  I noticed upon first use how easily it absorbed into my skin and how soft it made my skin feel. Since then I have bought Argan oil from different suppliers with mixed results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recently received a well packaged amber bottle of the Organic Argan oil by Nature Beauty Brand. I gave it the first test right away by washing my face with a bar of my own handcrafted soap followed by a few drops of this organic Argan oil rubbed into my hands and gently massaged on my fresh clean face. The oil was very easily applied and soaked into my skin quickly. My face felt like I had sat for a expensive facial. My skin felt like 10,000 watts of beauty!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am an actress and get such a kick when I&#x27;m sitting in the hair &amp; make up chair on set and the person doing my make up comments on how nice my skin is.  I smile and say thank you to them....and a little silent thank you to my amber glass bottle of organic argan oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recently took my first ever headshot without makeup. My face for the photo session was fresh and clean with only a little argan oil applied. The shots are some of the best I&#x27;ve ever taken. No hiding behind cosmetics no enhancing.  Showing the real woman. Showing THIS IS ME.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This organic argan oil is my secret beauty tool. With it I am loving the skin I&#x27;m in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you very much,&lt;br /&gt;K. Chappell</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll be honest, never heard of this before last week when my friend recommended it! She told me all about it and I decided to give it a shot! I am so glad I did! I love it and will definitely buy again! My skin is so smooth and my hair is soft. Hoping after a few weeks my wrinkles will hit the road haha! I would recommend this to everyone!</li>
    <li> I received a free bottle of this argan oil to review, and while it does feel like a good, non-greasy moisturizer on my face, I can&#x27;t get past the smell. I asked my husband what he thought it smelled like and we both agreed; it reminds one of diapers. I&#x27;m going to stick with coconut oil.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s not unscented, it has a natural smell&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;which i don&#x27;t like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;will look for an unscented oil instead of this.</li>
    <li> Says its organic but docent have USDA organic label. Does have Expiration dates and manufacturing lot numbers so thats good. Smells like other legit Argan oils I have used.</li>
    <li> The Argan oil is great quality, just like the other reviews state and its smell is nice. Thanks for a great product.</li>
    <li> I have occasional eczema on my hands, and am trying Argan oil for it&#x27;s moisturizing and restorative properties.  It seems to be doing wonders for my hands.  I have read through some of the reviews here and am going to try it as well as a leave in hair conditioning agent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Natural Beauty Brand Argan oil has a light, nutty scent and appears to be an extremely high quality product.</li>
    <li> Just received today. Love it so far. Cuticle miracle! Thanks for the oil. Can&#x27;t wait to try more free products</li>
    <li> This oil and this company rocks!!  I was very skeptical when I received my invite to try this oil free, but wow...it was true, also the shipping.  I got it within two or three days and I love this stuff!!  I&#x27;ve been using pure/organic products on my skin for years, but this is really awesome because it takes just a few drops and goes so far!!  When you put it on, you expect it will be greasy for awhile, but then it just &amp;#34;disappears&amp;#34;, which is what a good, organic oil SHOULD do.  I gave some to my friend tonight to try on this weird little wrinkle she has under just one eye.  She has instructions to give me a play-by-play report, lol.  Also, I&#x27;ve been dealing with a horrible case of shingles for the past year or so, and when I get a really bad break-out most things burn, but this soothes it and doesn&#x27;t burn at all.  I&#x27;m sold!!!</li>
    <li> Try it! For me worked wonderfully. I love it. It&#x27;s the best product that I have bought for my hair.</li>
