      <li>Love it, and will purchase again!</li>
      <li>I love this product!</li>
      <li>The product is nice, it is a gel that absorbs into your skin well, never greasy.  </li>
      <li>that really does do a great job in reducing the bags under my eyes!  </li>
      <li>I do not get that kind of relief, but the product does seem to get rid of puffiness and tightens the eye area.</li>
      <li>Found it on Amazon and was thrilled.  </li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s really nice</li>
      <li>This is far &amp; away the best eye gel I have ever used.  </li>
      <li>It has a nice refreshing feeling and does not over-moisturize my eyes in the morning.  </li>
      <li>i&#x27;ve tried a lot of eye products, and this is the best so far....</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used clinique&#x27;s eye cream which works BETTER but stings my eyes.</li>
      <li>I love this eye gel.</li>
      <li>it can moisturize skin around eyes, but if you want it to do more I don&#x27;t think it can work.</li>
      <li>It really reduces puffiness and has a great, cooling feeling.  </li>
      <li>Mostly I like that this eye gel is safe for use during pregnancy.</li>
      <li>If anyone has a better idea to get rid of the bags under the eyes, please let me know.</li>
      <li>This product worked okay.</li>
      <li>eyes stay puffy through most of the morning.</li>
      <li>This one isn&#x27;t a miracle worker by any means but it is refreshing and soothing, and makes your eyes look</li>
      <li>This is the best thing (next to preparation H) that I&#x27;ve found for my under eyes.</li>
      <li>I also love the fact the company does not do animal testing on any of their products.</li>
      <li>I love my eye cram</li>
      <li>So this product is pretty good, but I&#x27;m not raving about it.  </li>
      <li>I like to put it in the refrigerator so that it is nice and cool.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a nice, light eye gel, but nothing to get too excited about.</li>
      <li>, it is very cool and calming.</li>
      <li>Very cool cream.</li>
      <li>Not only did this product do NOTHING good for my skin, but it also burned my eyes!  </li>
      <li>It is easy to rub on</li>
      <li>My 2nd order ,great product ,makes your eye feel alive ,i keep it stored in the fridge ,just feels great .</li>
      <li>Love the soothing cool sensation when applied under the eyes.</li>
      <li>this cool, refreshing feeling gel at night, then cover with my mask which I kept in the fridge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Feels cool and refreshing.</li>
      <li>COOL AND REFRESHING.  </li>
      <li>However, I do not see any fine line reduction underneath my eyes.</li>
      <li>I would use it for normal days, but probably not for special work days where I must be really really ridiculously good looking.</li>
      <li>salt - I wake up with these huge balloons under my eyes - it&#x27;s horrible!&lt;br</li>
      <li>and I have noticed a huge improvement to the bags under my eyes.</li>
      <li>This product is fabulous.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s nice and cooling but it doesn&#x27;t really help with the puffyness.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Liked this eye gel so much I ordered another one</li>
      <li>A fantastic way to apply this eye gel is to store it in the refrigerator...</li>
      <li>The legendary reputation of the product , with a cool moist skin after eye on the black eye effect , it is like it</li>
      <li>It is SO much more convenient and more pleasant than the other remedies!</li>
      <li>I am very pleased with my new eye cream.  </li>
      <li>I originally bought this product to get rid of the bags under my eyes.</li>
      <li>and I am happy so far I can&#x27;t waite until the end of this month to see how much the cream has rid my circles..</li>
      <li>Now I came back early to give my update because this eye cream is best for me</li>
      <li>It is very soft and nice.</li>
      <li>It feels so soothing and cool.  </li>
      <li>and as always Amazon.com was fast and reliable :)</li>
      <li>It gets two stars for having a cooling sensation which is nice and it leaves my eye area soft, but it doesn&#x27;t do squat for bags.</li>
      <li>I have being using it every morning for over a year and really gives my eyes a refreshing cooling feel</li>
      <li>but I did not experience any allergic reactions or redness, which I have experienced with other products.  </li>
      <li>I used many different products for puffy eyes and nothing seemed to work better.</li>
      <li>This eye gel is so refreshing to my eye area - highly recommend for those with morning puffiness, etc.  </li>
      <li>Basq products seem to only be advertised as maternity skin care, however, I have NEVER used a better eye gel than theirs!</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t exacerbate my rosacea and really helps with fine lines.</li>
      <li>It leaves a fresh and cooling feeling after application.</li>
      <li>The muscle under the eyes feel fresh after application.</li>
      <li>But so far the thing I like most about this product after one use is the tightning feeling under my eyes and the cooling sensation...</li>
      <li>I have sensitive skin, wear contacts and want something that is safe around my eyes.  </li>
      <li>noticed a difference the very first time, not a lot, but I knew I was really on to something.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Every morning after using an oil free eye makeup remover to clean around my eyes, I rinse my eyes out with a generic brand eye wash which I keep refrigerated...</li>
      <li>Great stuff, moist without thick smelling</li>
      <li>A real treat for your eyes!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> great product for under eyes at bedtime.  i feel like its nourishing and moisturizing the delicate skin under the eyes</li>
    <li> I love using this eye gel! I can immediately feel the difference after putting it on. Feels cool and refreshing.</li>
    <li> Pretty decent I had some moderate success it does seem to cool the area.&lt;br /&gt;I think I would recommend this product</li>
    <li> Very cool cream.But haven&#x27;t valid date.</li>
    <li> it is refreshing,not oily,but I have run out of it in two months</li>
    <li> Basq products seem to only be advertised as maternity skin care, however, I have NEVER used a better eye gel than theirs! It is absolutely wonderful! It doesn&#x27;t exacerbate my rosacea and really helps with fine lines.</li>
    <li> Best eye gel I&#x27;ve ever use. It make a noticable difference.</li>
    <li> It takes away the puffiness in the morning and mid afternoon. I use this in addition to my eye moisturizer eye cream.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work, a waste of money.  I wanted to use it to moisturize and soften my eyes up.  I have puffy eyes, but not that puffy.  I&#x27;ve used other products that work fine, I just wanted to try this one out and it was a waste.</li>
    <li> Happy 2014 to all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have had very itchy,  dry skin under my eyes, from an allergy all of  sudden, puffy and swollen eyes from old age, LOL not all of a sudden, and from the heat in my apartment after all this time living here since 1986.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the past 4 months, I have used cortisone cream, benedryl tablets, benedryl cream, baby oil, vasoline,  you name it, I bought it. I have rubbed my eyes so much I am walking around with 2 black eyes, embarrassed to go out. I broke all my blood vessels.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product which I received in no time flat has fixed all the above, well of course not the black eyes which have to heal on there own!! It is so cooling, stopped my itch and stopped me from rubbing my eyes immediately and  I woke up without the puffy eyes,&lt;br /&gt;And that only after one application!!! Unreal....Thanx Amazon!!!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if this is helping or not.  I&#x27;m not sure how to tell!  I will use all of it to see if it makes a difference.</li>
    <li> This eye gel is difficult to find, so when I saw Amazon offering it I was very pleased and relieved. Having tried MANY high end eye creams, not only does this one totally reduce puffiness and smooth It prevents familia(tiny white bumps) from forming under your eye which most other eye creams tend to do. Won&#x27;t be without! Thanks Amazon.</li>
    <li> I love this eye gel. I have insomnia and am allergic to our 2 dogs so I have bad bags under my eyes in the morning.  This is the first gel (I&#x27;ve tried quite a few!) that really does do a great job in reducing the bags under my eyes!  It is easy to rub on and I have no problem putting my make-up on over it.  I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s in gel texture, so it is not greasy. However, I do not see any fine line reduction underneath my eyes. I will not purchase it next time.</li>
    <li> COOL AND REFRESHING.  I EVEN USE IT ON MY LIPS IN THE WINTER TO EASE THE DRYING EFFECT FROM HEATERS.</li>
    <li> This is far &amp; away the best eye gel I have ever used.  It really reduces puffiness and has a great, cooling feeling.  I give it my highest recommendation to anyone</li>
    <li> Mostly I like that this eye gel is safe for use during pregnancy. I like the gel texture, it is very cool and calming. I would purchase this again.</li>
    <li> Small jar and pricey for what it does. Compare to St Ives Cucumber eye gel for fraction&lt;br /&gt;Of the price</li>
    <li> Love it! So refreshing!</li>
    <li> I just received the product, and started using it. It is a bit early to say how it performs. So, I must reserve judgment for a while.</li>
    <li> I heard this was great for bags under eyes or relief of dryness and it may very well work for some, but my issue was how it seemed to dry my already very dry eyes.  I could not continue using it.  If you have dry eyes, this might not be for you.</li>
    <li> I am 33, male, so may be its not for me, but the dark circles did not go away at all. did not see any kind of diff, makes you think if the previous reviews were fake, the size of the bottle is so tiny, i thought Amazon forgot to ship it.</li>
    <li> I used many different products for puffy eyes and nothing seemed to work better. I normaly keep it in the fridge and it&#x27;s really nice when I use it in the morning.</li>
    <li> I like it. I&#x27;ve used clinique&#x27;s eye cream which works BETTER but stings my eyes. This one isn&#x27;t a miracle worker by any means but it is refreshing and soothing, and makes your eyes look a bit less bag-gy. I would use it for normal days, but probably not for special work days where I must be really really ridiculously good looking.</li>
    <li> Not only did this product do NOTHING good for my skin, but it also burned my eyes!  There&#x27;s MENTHOL in this product, which is, yes, minty!  And it stings the eyes.  It is NOT refreshing.  It is also DRYING.  DO NOT get this product!!!</li>
    <li> I bought it for summer, but I really think it too thin to protect the skin, and no smell of anything. maybe it&#x27;s good, but i can&#x27;t tell.</li>
    <li> It does help eliminate puffiness but I used to use St. Ives Eye Stress Gel with cucumber and elastin that came in a 4 oz. bottle and was less expensive and worked much better.  Unfortunately the St. Ives product has been discontinued.</li>
    <li> Save your money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;keep your money. I use it for a month, no change observed.  I not recommend. no no</li>
    <li> Did nothing got me, did not work at all I am very disappointed in this product and I was so looking forward to it for help</li>
    <li> Very cooling, but does not reduce puffiness or dark circles. However, the coolness is soothing if that is what you are looking for.</li>
    <li> Liked this eye gel so much I ordered another one so I could have one for travel and one for at home. Love the soothing cool sensation when applied under the eyes. Great product and have already noticed it helping my puffiness in the morning hours.</li>
    <li> I love this product! It feels good, works for puffiness, and you have to use only a small amount, so it lasts long! I have really sensitive skin and it helps with its redness and puffiness..</li>
    <li> I have always had issues with puffy bags under my eyes when I haven&#x27;t had enough sleep or have consumed too much sodium. Most of the time, I have had success with the usual remedies - cold water/ice cubes, eye massage, tea bags, and cucumbers. But they&#x27;re all a time-consuming and sometimes messy PITA to do. And for the last several months, my bags have become progressively worse, even when I&#x27;ve had enough sleep and avoided salt - I wake up with these huge balloons under my eyes - it&#x27;s horrible!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bags were so bad that I had little hope for this gel to work. The first time I used it, there was a noticeable difference, but the bags were not completely removed - I think they were just too severe. But I could tell it was at least partially working. I then tried the suggestion (on the label) to put a generous amount on at night before going to bed, and reapply in the morning. The next morning, there was further improvement. After a week of doing the night/morning routine, as well as about 30 seconds of eye massage with my fingers, my bags are 90% gone. It is SO much more convenient and more pleasant than the other remedies! I am also happy with how long it is lasting, considering it is such a small container. I am way happy with this product and will be ordering it again.</li>
    <li> We love it and are hooked!  A fantastic way to apply this eye gel is to store it in the refrigerator...extra cooling and soothing!  A go to for both my husband and I in the morning.  This product is good for all eyes and both men and women!  It feels amazing and you can feel and see it work!</li>
    <li> I had high hopes for this product but after continued use for 4 weeks, I haven&#x27;t noticed any improvements.  I&#x27;ve kept it in the refrigerator and found that its coolness was soothing… but the product did nothing to reduce inflammation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had much better success applying cold cucumbers and cold, wet packs of green tea.</li>
    <li> the product is very good as a gift, my friend likes it a lot. I am very satisfied with this purchase.</li>
    <li> The legendary reputation of the product , with a cool moist skin after eye on the black eye effect , it is like it</li>
    <li> I was disappointed with this product.  Haven&#x27;t noticed any difference in the puffiness under my eyes.  It is soothing and cooling but that&#x27;s about it.  Not worth the money, doesn&#x27;t do what it says it does. Would not recommend.</li>
    <li> I put this on during the night and it really does make my eyes look like tired in the morning and helps the puffyness and the bags under my eyes look smaller. I am a 22 college guy who needs this time to time when i stay up studying late at night</li>
    <li> I just started to use this difference but have noticed as long as use every day I have noticed a difference in the bags under my eyes!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s nice and cooling but it doesn&#x27;t really help with the puffyness.&lt;br /&gt;My eyes stay puffy through most of the morning.</li>
    <li> This probably works for some people and not for others.  I didn&#x27;t see much happening for me and tried something else.</li>
    <li> The seller was great and the order came on time. I originally bought this product to get rid of the bags under my eyes. I like the feel and smell of the product and have been using it for several weeks so far, but I am not sure it does what it said.  I used it twice a day religiously; in the morning and before bed time.  Nothing changed so far. The bags are still there and have not even reduced. I will continue using it and see what happens. If anyone has a better idea to get rid of the bags under the eyes, please let me know.</li>
    <li> This gel actually works, unlike a lot of eye creams that claim they do.  Within a couple of minutes, dark circles and puffiness are gone.  Can be a little drying under your eyes, so I put on eye cream over it after I put it on, then my makeup after everything has cleared up, but overall the best dark circle and puffiness-reducing cream I&#x27;ve ever used.  I had a hard time finding it and I&#x27;m glad I did!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! If I wake up and my eyes are tired or puffy this takes care of it. It feels cool and refreshing everyday. Love it!</li>
    <li> Great stuff, moist without thick smelling</li>
    <li> It leaves a fresh and cooling feeling after application. I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone and everyone! I&#x27;ve been using it for months.</li>
    <li> it can moisturize skin around eyes, but if you want it to do more I don&#x27;t think it can work.</li>
    <li> This gel really helps with the puffiness around the eyes.  I&#x27;ve been using it for about 6 months now and haven&#x27;t found anything else that helps as much as this.</li>
    <li> very good eye gel!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I used this product and I did not see a big difference in my dark circles and bags. Trying something else.</li>
    <li> Okay, I&#x27;m a guy, and dont normally buy stuff like this, but have lived most of my adult&lt;br /&gt;life with bags and dark rings under my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;It had started to make me a bit self conscience since I am in my 50&#x27;s, and work with all&lt;br /&gt;young people.&lt;br /&gt;Stupid bags made me feel and look old!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bought some of this stuff, open the package and tried it right away!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I noticed a difference the very first time, not a lot, but I knew I was really on to something.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Applied a thick coat at night, and in the morning, washed my face with cool water, applied a very&lt;br /&gt;thin coat, and went to work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I got to my desk, I dunked some paper towels in cold water and placed them under each eye for&lt;br /&gt;only a minute.&lt;br /&gt;I could see a bigger difference, my bags and dark rings were reduced by more then half.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I then started this routeen every day, in combination with the cold gel mask, I apply a heavy layer&lt;br /&gt;of this cool, refreshing feeling gel at night, then cover with my mask which I kept in the fridge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let that sit while I relax and watch TV maybe 30 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;Take mask off and go to sleep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Morning, rinse, thin layer, another cold rinse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After 1 week, the bags and dark rings are completly gone.&lt;br /&gt;It takes several days for the skin under the eyes to get used to NOT being puffy and swollen, and the skin&lt;br /&gt;there will slowly start to shrink and go back to normal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you can still see parts of the dark ring, there are cover-up makeup options which will make them dissapear&lt;br /&gt;completly.&lt;br /&gt;Read my other review on the under eye cover-up, and the cold gel mask and learn how a 50+ year old man who&lt;br /&gt;had bags and rings for 30+ years made them go away forever!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, and as always Amazon.com was fast and reliable :)</li>
    <li> The gel is cooling when I apply it under my eyes but it feels sticky. I sneezed once when I put it on and it gunked up under my eyes and I had to scrape it off and reapply it. Besides that I haven&#x27;t seen a big improvement yet but the darkness under my eyes does seem a bit lighter.</li>
    <li> This eye gel is so refreshing to my eye area - highly recommend for those with morning puffiness, etc.  A real treat for your eyes!</li>
    <li> This soothing eye gel is wonderful! It keeps the puffiness down on my under eye area very well. I love the simple and few ingredients too!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t notice any difference. I bought this to decrease the inflammation under my eyes (bags). It&#x27;s sticky and the price is too high in my opinion.</li>
    <li> Put in the fridge before use after a late night.  Cooling to under eye area but if genetics has given you puffy eyes, do not bother to spend the money.</li>
    <li> The first couple of days I used this product I could see the puffiness go down. But now, after about 4 weeks I don&#x27;t see as drastic change as before</li>
    <li> For the past 2 weeks I have been experiencing super puffy eyes on my lids and great big bags under my eyes. I tried burts bees radiance eye cream and a clinique eye cream also. Both creams failed to produce results so I decided to give this a shot. I put it in the fridge ad put a nice thick layer on my lids and bags before I went to bed and withhin 5 minutes all the puffiness and bags were completely gone! Wow! I even woke up with no puffiness and bags. i don&#x27;t know what they put in this gel but it works wonders for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ok I had to go back in and take off 2 stars because after using this for about 5 days my lids became super dry and started to burn. I stopped using it and applied some vaseline on my lids until the dryness and burning went away. I think I will use it just to get instant results but it&#x27;s not good for long term use.</li>
    <li> I guess ill have to come back in a week or two and give my final opinion on this product. I have only used this product for one day and I see a slight change so far..it feels as though my undereyes are tightning(which is a good thing for me) and there is slight change of color under my eyes and the lines are slightly gone. But so far the thing I like most about this product after one use is the tightning feeling under my eyes and the cooling sensation...it&#x27;s doing good so far..can&#x27;t recommend this product right now though, ill have to do an update.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ok now for the update: This is a good eye cream so far I see results small to medium results but I am happy I see results..Iam using this cream to get rid of my under eye circles and just keep me from getting bags period. Now I came back early to give my update because this eye cream is best for me and I am happy so far I can&#x27;t waite until the end of this month to see how much the cream has rid my circles..I do have to say I have to put alot on to see maximum results but even though the jar is so little there is still so much product left.</li>
    <li> I like the gel because it is not thick or greasy, but my eyes are still puffy in the morning after putting this on the night before. That was the reason I bought this particular product.  Unfortunately I will keep searching for something that does not cause me to wake up with puffy eyes in the morning.</li>
    <li> I have been using this gel for about 10 days now and I have noticed a huge improvement to the bags under my eyes. I had a deep groove and bags when I began using the gel and in 10 days it seems to have decreased the grooves under my eyes by about 30% and the bags about 50%. I only use it in the mornings, and am thinking to start using it at night too, as I read in the reviews. I highly recommend based on my usage so far!</li>
    <li> Wow!  It really works.</li>
    <li> ok, I&#x27;m almost afraid to say this because I don&#x27;t want the price to get jacked up or the person that sells this to run out of them! haha (but seriously!) This is the best thing (next to preparation H) that I&#x27;ve found for my under eyes.It is a gel and it does shrink the under eye eggs and just really smoothes and tightens it out pretty well (for me). I have fairly bad under eyes, so I have been well pleased with this.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good eye cream, but I didn&#x27;t notice any miracles.  If you put it on a little heavy, it will become a bit sticky and make a funny texture under you concealer.</li>
    <li> This is just what I need for tired, puffy eyes.  It feels so soothing and cool.  Love it, and will purchase again!</li>
    <li> i saw zero change in thedark rings, or bags using this item. it does cool the area off, but other than that....zip</li>
    <li> After many years and $&#x27;s spent on products that did nothing to relieve severe puffiness under and around my eyes, this gel really works. Unlike the eye creams which only make the swelling worse because of the oils in them, this gel has no oils that will plump up and stretch the delicate skin beneath the eyes. I have inherited puffiness and also suffer from seasonal allergies which make the swelling worse. I take an OVTC allergy medication and use a saline nasal spray which help. Every morning after using an oil free eye makeup remover to clean around my eyes, I rinse my eyes out with a generic brand eye wash which I keep refrigerated... then I apply the Cucumber Tea gel which I also keep in the fridge. This is a product that does what it says for a fraction of the cost.</li>
    <li> been using for three weeks still waiting on little result, maybe after a month or two, still not convince yet</li>
    <li> this product is truly a waste of money as it does not do anything for the puffiness of the eyes.</li>
    <li> It is very soft and nice. I try it evry night . I hope it can work ! Good job</li>
    <li> I bought this gel for my puffy eye and I used it since 30 days and the same problem no any change just cold gel in your eyes , don&#x27;t waste your money ,iam looking now for another one</li>
    <li> I used as directed and it didn&#x27;t really do anything for me.</li>
    <li> This product worked okay. I used it more for waking up my tired eyes in the morning. I like to put it in the refrigerator so that it is nice and cool. Doesn&#x27;t really help with under eye circles though, at least not mine</li>
    <li> just gel....doesn&#x27;t do anything for me.  MAN I MISS St. Ives Cucumber GEL....NEED TO BE BACK IN PRODUCTION!!!!!</li>
    <li> This stuff works the best for the puffiness under my eye, the only reason I didn&#x27;t give 5 stars is due to the fact it doesn&#x27;t last very long. About a month using twice a day with just a dab under each eye.</li>
    <li> I read some gels could replace eye cream. Not this one. Only thing it does is a refresh some on the eye area like a cooling effect, not much more for me.</li>
    <li> I love my eye cram im always going to have on my dayly ruting</li>
    <li> My 2nd order ,great product ,makes your eye feel alive ,i keep it stored in the fridge ,just feels great .</li>
    <li> I have been using it for a week and it has absolutely no effect. It actually enhances the wrinkes if you use a little bit more of it.</li>
    <li> I have really bad eye bags......my mom did too! Im 52 and this helps a lot.....Not a miracle but I do think it is a good product.I keep it in the fridge and the coldness helps!</li>
    <li> The product is nice, it is a gel that absorbs into your skin well, never greasy.  I bought it for puffiness under my eyes and I did not see any improvement in that condition but I did not experience any allergic reactions or redness, which I have experienced with other products.  I wouldn&#x27;t necessarily buy it again because I am trying to solve a particular problem, but it may work better for others.</li>
    <li> I bought this eye gel based on other reviews here. I have hereditary bags probably due to allergies or so I was told by a plastic surgeon during a consultation. I decided I didn&#x27;t want to go the route of surgery and so then sought out products that seemed promising. None have worked, including this one. Don&#x27;t waste your money. It gets two stars for having a cooling sensation which is nice and it leaves my eye area soft, but it doesn&#x27;t do squat for bags. If you&#x27;re like me and are just looking for something that will make you look you&#x27;re &amp;#34;awake&amp;#34;, and you buy a lot of products trying to achieve that look, then take it from me and don&#x27;t bother with this product.</li>
    <li> Nice, probably tightens up the eye area, but I was hoping for a more cooling/soothing effect on my tired eyes.  I do not get that kind of relief, but the product does seem to get rid of puffiness and tightens the eye area.</li>
    <li> I just tried this product for the &amp;#34;cucumber tea&amp;#34; name. It turned out to be a good product as an eye gel. The muscle under the eyes feel fresh after application. Will buy again.</li>
    <li> its 2 weeks for me and i feel good. will wait for the result.</li>
    <li> it cools my eyes after a long day but it does not work to reduce puffiness or dark circles and i tried it for a month....</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this for a few weeks without any real difference in dark circles or puffiness. As far as lines go, I see no change at all. It&#x27;s a nice, light eye gel, but nothing to get too excited about.</li>
    <li> i&#x27;ve tried a lot of eye products, and this is the best so far.... i actually feel the tightening up of my skin around my puffy eyes.  i&#x27;ve been using it for about a month - and i can see the results.</li>
    <li> It has a nice refreshing feeling and does not over-moisturize my eyes in the morning.  Some other eye moisturizers are a little to greasy, making eye makeup application more difficult.  So this product is pretty good, but I&#x27;m not raving about it.  Does nothing to reduce appearance of dark circles.</li>
    <li> This product lives up to its advertised uses quite well. It noticeably reduces puffiness both below the eyes and of the eyelids. It doesn&#x27;t reduce the appearance of my dark circles, however. It&#x27;s much easier to cover them up without puffy eyes though! I will definitely purchase again.</li>
    <li> I have real live eyebags, not just a little puff, and this product works...to a degree. It feels cool after a few seconds of applying, and it continues cooling the eye area for several minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As it dries around the eyes, it draws in and tightens the skin. My eyes look a little brighter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It hydrates a little too much for me. As skin becomes hydrated, it plumps up, so eyes can actually be puffier. This is why I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars.</li>
    <li> This stuff felt great going on as it was nice and soothing but I bought it to help with my husbands bags and dark under eye circles and after almost two weeks of use we noticed no change at all (we even put it in the fridge as recommended). If you want something that is merely soothing I would recommend this but if you need it for anything else or have serious bags you want to minimize I&#x27;d shop elsewhere.</li>
    <li> I do not see or feel any effect of this gel. It didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
    <li> I use to get this on QVC but they stopped stocking it.  Found it on Amazon and was thrilled.  I have sensitive skin, wear contacts and want something that is safe around my eyes.  This product is fabulous.  It&#x27;s also GREAT if when you get your eyebrows waxed to come home and put this over your eyebrow area.  It takes the red away and calms the skin quickly.  It&#x27;s a must have for me.</li>
    <li> I absolutely loved this product. I have being using it every morning for over a year and really gives my eyes a refreshing cooling feel and I saw a difference in my under eye area skin tone within a few weeks. The jar is compact and great to travel with as well. I also love the fact the company does not do animal testing on any of their products. I would absolutely recommend this product to others.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with my new eye cream.  It takes the puffiness from my eyelids and reduces the&lt;br /&gt;fine lines around my eyes.</li>
    <li> This is expensive and it was used daily until gone and I could see no improvement in the dark areas under my eyes or reduction in the wrinkles</li>
