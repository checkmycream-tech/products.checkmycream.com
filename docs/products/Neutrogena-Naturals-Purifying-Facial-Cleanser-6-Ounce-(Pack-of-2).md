      <li>My skin feels very smooth and it didn&#x27;t strip the moisture from my skin.</li>
      <li>Although it seems to be getting better</li>
      <li>It also has a nice, light fragrance and a gel consistency.</li>
      <li>healthy..</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I bought this stuff and the first time I used it my skin was glowing and looked great. It did a great job and didn&#x27;t dry out my skin. But within the next week I had a huge rash all over my forehead and cheeks. I would say just test this stuff out (maybe on your arm or other out of sight area) before you actually use it. It might do a good job for some people but be careful with new products like this.</li>
    <li> I have used Neutrogena products for years and always enjoy using them.  This is a very good facial cleanser that will not dry out your skin.</li>
    <li> As your typical guy would, I just use ordinary soap, so I gave my sample of this cleanser to my wife to try. The report turned up positive. This cleanser does a thorough job, without being harsh. It has a mild, fresh scent. As you would expect from a purifying cleanser, it does not moisturize. She reports that it also makes a nice shower gel. All in all, this is a nice product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always liked the Neutrogena items I&#x27;ve tried. This cleanser is no exception. It&#x27;s a clear, thick liquid which pumps out nicely, no clogging. It has a nice, fresh scent and my face feels clean afterward. It contains a form of salicylic acid, but I didn&#x27;t notice my skin being appreciably clearer. My only complaint would be that in the colder months it&#x27;s a bit drying, but during the summer it&#x27;s a good choice.</li>
    <li> I appreciated how clean this got my skin, but found the tight feeling of dry skin uncomfortable and discovered if I use it every day my face gets overly dry and will start to flake some of the skin.  Now I use it a couple of times a week for great results.</li>
    <li> Soap is thin and slippery and doesn&#x27;t lather well.  Even when all the soap is rinsed off it leaves my skin feeling tight in some places and oily in others and stings a bit.  :(</li>
    <li> I have adult acne (I know, join the club).  I&#x27;ve tried other Neutrogena products made specifically for acne, as well as some products made by other companies.  A lot of them tended to make me break out more, or didn&#x27;t prevent break out episodes.  I saw some ads about the new Neutrogen naturals line.  Although not advertised specifically as an acne treatment, the product description mentions that it is suitable for those with acne.  I&#x27;ve been using the purifying facial cleanser for about 6 weeks now, and found that this is the best product I&#x27;ve found for me and my adult acne. I like the fragrance, and do not find that this dries my face out.  After using it regularly, I have had almost no breakouts.  I&#x27;ve dealt with the two or three small pimples during this time period by using the Neutrogena spot treatment.  I plan on sticking with Neutrogena Naturals.    Unfortunately, I&#x27;ve also learned that everyone has to try these types of products for themselves.  Many other products I&#x27;ve tried that did not work for me had lots of good reviews.  All I can say is give this one a try if you&#x27;re on your search for a good facial cleanser.</li>
    <li> I wasnt expecting this facial wash to be so great, I am completely impressed with it, looking forward to trying out more of the line. I like the idea of not putting chemicals and such on my skin.  This works very similar to a salicylic acid facial wash I bought at Sephora but less intense and much better smelling.</li>
    <li> Feels a lot nicer than my regular clean &amp; clear product.  I like that it is more natural, and there aren&#x27;t any abrasive beads.  Pumper seems to dispense exactly the amount I need to wash my face.  Lathers nice.  Rinses clean.  Love it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used several different Neutrogena face washes over the years and this one is the most unique because it is branded as being natural/earth friendly. The consistency is thinner, more watery and basic as opposed to creamy, yet it still lathers nicely. It has an awesome, refreshing scent (it would make a nice body wash!), but if your skin is sensitive to scents you may find this bothersome. It works well to wash off make-up, even eye make-up, without leaving your face feeling dried out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing I wasn&#x27;t so pleased with regarding the consistency is it feels like I have to rinse my face a dozen times to get it all off. However, afterwards my face feels clean and refreshed. Overall, I think this is a nice face wash and worth trying if you want to try something more \\&quot;natural,\\&quot; if you like to experiment with different products or if you&#x27;re already partial to Neutrogena.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in my early 30s, but my skin doesn&#x27;t seem to realize that, and I still get minor breakouts from time to time. Lucky for me (or not), I had one of these breakouts right when this product arrived.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m happy to report that washing each night with Neutrogena Naturals helped my skin calm down and got rid of the pimples within a couple of days. However, I do have sensitive skin that tends toward dryness even in the places where I break out, and I had to slather on an oil-free moisturizer after washing with this. It dried my skin out pretty effectively.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also has a pretty strong scent, and while it&#x27;s not stinky, it&#x27;s also not exactly pleasant. It&#x27;s a bit medicinal and herbal (and not in a good way). I typically use fragrance-free face washes, so maybe I was just too sensitive to the scent, but I didn&#x27;t care for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it&#x27;s good for breakouts, and I&#x27;m guessing it would be very good for oily skin. Personally, I&#x27;ll save it for when my skin decides to have flashbacks to my teenage years.</li>
    <li> This neutrogena cleanser works well without stripping your skin. The packaging is attractive and the pump on the bottle works well. I will  buy this again and again.</li>
    <li> Neutrogena \\&quot;Naturals\\&quot; facial cleanser is a light, fresh scented cleanser.  The product is packaged perfectly, with a pump for easy use.  The pump gives a perfect amount of soap for each cleansing without making you feel as though you are wasting product.  The cleanser \\&quot;suds\\&quot; just enough to give a \\&quot;soapy/clean\\&quot; feel.  Overall, a good product!  The product was used for about 2 weeks before I decided to write the review to see how well the product worked.  The product did not leave my skin any oilier or dryer than my other cleanser.  The product did not appear to make my face any more or less prone to breakouts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(As a side note for someone who has tried many facial cleansers.  I did not give this 5 stars because although this was a fine cleanser I did feel as though I wanted to go back to my normal cleanser. I feel as though the reason is because my daily cleanser an exfoliating scrub.  Because this product did not make me want to switch cleansers I could not give it a 5 star rating.)</li>
    <li> My wife used this product and reported back. Her comments were brief but she noted the following:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* The product is easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* The product is comfortable-- no irritation, burning, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* The product cleans deeply and leaves a clean feeling without a lot of effort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* The most important feature is that the product does not causes skin dryness or a feeling of dryness, which apparently is a problem with other similar products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Based on her feedback, which was 100% positive and provided specific details of why she likes the product, it&#x27;s easy to recommend it with a 5-star rating. Perhaps most telling of all is that she&#x27;s added it to her shopping list.</li>
    <li> I do not have sensitive skin, so when my husband brought this home for me to try, I was not hesitant.  BIG MISTAKE. After a few days, my eyelids became so red, swollen and itchy, I had to use benadryl to stop the itching&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It took me a while to figure out that the only change was this product.  I also have a huge rash in my neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you really want this product, spot test first.</li>
    <li> I have not been using this cleanser very long, but I must say it stings my face and eyes. I will continue to use it since I am not much of a fan of wasting, but please be aware it may not be for sensitive acne prone skin.</li>
    <li> i always use a face wash when i take a shower and i have been using this one for about 3 months now. i have slightly oily skin(around the nose) and i do get blackheads(TMI?) but this cleanser has been as good as the more expensive ones i&#x27;ve purchased in the past(usually at bath and body works). it leaves my skin feeling soft, yet a little bit tight. its nice knowing it&#x27;s \\&quot;natural\\&quot; and doesn&#x27;t have a lot of the hard to pronounce chemicals that are in most other cleansers. i also prefer face washes that are more of a gel, rather than white paste, i feel like they make my skin feel nicer. so far im very happy with it, and one bottle lasts awhile. i use it once a day, everyday, and i still have half a bottle full. i think the price at what amazon offers it for is very reasonable. you&#x27;re going to pay the same if not more at the stores for something similar.</li>
    <li> It cleans my skin and it is visibly clearer after only a few days of use, but even when I dropped down from twice a day to once a day, it still stings and leaves my face bright red for about 15 minutes after washing.  I don&#x27;t know why that is, and it&#x27;s annoying since I&#x27;ve never had particularly sensitive skin, despite being a redhead.  Unless this stuff works spectacularly over the next week or two, I think I&#x27;m going back to my homemade olive oil/apple cider vinegar/honey/tea tree oil concoction :-\</li>
    <li> I love this face wash.  I&#x27;ve used it for four days now, so not terribly long for a review, but it DOES remove makeup extremely well, smells amazing, and seems to clean well as well.  Absolutely fantastic and happy with this product.</li>
    <li> I just recently got the memo that washing your make-up off with hand-soap is not good, so I searched for a product with good reviews and found this one. Obviously I ended up buying it, and I really really like using it. It smells delicious and makes my skin feel nice without drying it. I can&#x27;t compare this to any other make-up removers/face cleansers, being that this is the first and only one I have ever used, BUT it takes my make-up off so easily and smoothly and really leaves my face feeling nice. If this isn&#x27;t a good product then I can&#x27;t imagine what a good one would be. I probably will be using this for a very long time! Only reason I gave it 4 stars is because I have never tried any other products like this, so I don&#x27;t have much to go by... Also, I usually like using soaps with those little tiny exfoliating beads, and this doesn&#x27;t have those. However, that&#x27;s not a huge issue as this product is very very smooth on the skin, which is also nice!!</li>
    <li> When I first heard about it, I thought it sounded great for being natural and with no harsh chemicals. I&#x27;ve always had pretty good skin, but I wanted to try something that would just clean it. I used it and it felt great the first day and then the next day my face started to break out!!!! I thought maybe it was happening because my skins wasn&#x27;t used to it, so I continued to use it for the next week to see if it would get better. IT DID NOT! It kept getting worse. I don&#x27;t know if i&#x27;m allergic to something in it, but it DID NOT work for me! WASTE OF MY MONEY!</li>
    <li> This cleanser is very smooth and silky!  It cleanses my pores after I apply a bit, add some water to make it sudsy, and then rinse with a hot, wet facecloth.  I intend t buy this product again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a very nice scent, reminiscent of dried flowers or herbs.  I have no allergies to this cleanser.  My skin is left moist after washing, not dried out.  It feels almost like it has emollients in it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product</li>
    <li> Neutrogena Naturals Facial Cleanser is an all-natural product that actually delivers what it promises. I find that while many natural skincare products claim to be better for your skin, they don&#x27;t actually do as good of a job as their chemically-enhanced counterparts. This cleanser is the exception. It does a great job or removing dirt, oil, and even makeup from the skin. It also leaves behind a nice scent that isn&#x27;t overpowering, but is quite refreshing. I prefer foaming cleansers myself and wish this product could be worked into a thicker lather, but that&#x27;s really my only complaint. Those people seeking a quality natural cleaner should give this one a try.</li>
    <li> In short, this facial cleanser does a good job of getting my skin clean and seems to help prevent breakouts. I typically use a mildly medicated cleanser like this, and Neutrogena Naturals is about what I expect and hope for. It smells light and fresh, my skin feels clean but not too stripped after washing, and I noticed no irritation. My skincare routine had been doing a good job of preventing breakouts, and that didn&#x27;t change when I swapped this for the product I&#x27;d been using previously. Neutrogena Naturals does produce fewer suds than what I&#x27;m used to, but that&#x27;s not a real problem.    One comment is that the willowbark does mean that this product contains salicylic acid, like many similar cleansers. So if you know salicylic acid works for you, then this probably will. But it is an ingredient my doctor had advised me to avoid during pregnancy. Of course that&#x27;s a non-issue for most potential users, but a reminder that natural doesn&#x27;t mean 100% safe in every circumstance.     For me, my four star rating means I&#x27;d be happy to continue using this product - or that next time I shop I might try another wash if it was significantly cheaper. But if you&#x27;re particularly interested in this because it&#x27;s more natural than others, then I recommend it as something that works the way I hope.</li>
    <li> I have tried just about every blemish control facial cleaner known to man and this one ranks as one of the best!  I liked the fresh scent because it wasn&#x27;t too perfume-like and it left my skin clean but not tight.  The one downside was that it lathers excessively and takes quite a few splashes of water to rinse the product from your face.  I haven&#x27;t had any blemishes to worry about while using the product which is a plus and I also like that the product is 100 percent natural.  I feel that Neutrogena Naturals Purifying Facial Cleanser is definitely worth a try if you have &#x27;difficult&#x27; skin like I do.</li>
    <li> I have no doubt my face is clean after using this product.  I am happy it has a mild, pleasant scent and it only takes a small amount to suds up nicely.</li>
    <li> I have a teen daughter and as most of us know this is a tough time of life to keep the breakouts to a minimum.  I was going to use this myself, but my daughter confiscated it from me and has been hooked ever since.  She says she likes how her skin feels after using the product and with summer fast approaching she still hasn&#x27;t shown any signs of major breakouts.  I would recommend this to anyone looking for a quality facial cleanser.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin, but when I lather this on my face and let it sit on my skin for a few minutes in the shower, it burns afterwards.  Seems like there&#x27;s a definite trend here among reviewers....  If I apply a little, rub gently, and rinse it off very quickly, I&#x27;m fine.  I think that&#x27;s the key to using this stuff.  Beware of the willowbark.. it&#x27;ll getchu suckas!</li>
    <li> I was really excited to try this product but it disappointed me.  The first thing I disliked was the intense fragrance.  I couldn&#x27;t rinse enough to get the fragrance off my face.  The product was also irritating to my skin (I have sensitive skin and rosacea). The redness flared up badly, and it lasted for four days although I stopped using this product right away.  I&#x27;m no longer drawn in by the \\&quot;natural\\&quot; claim on products - what does that word really mean in this context?  It&#x27;s not defined by the FDA or any scientific source; it can mean whatever the manufacturer wants it to mean -- and just because something occurs in nature that doesn&#x27;t make it safe or desirable to put on your skin (poison ivy for example!).  Also \\&quot;not tested on animals\\&quot; makes me wonder - maybe this product was never animal-tested, but some of the ingredients have been (I&#x27;m a chemist and I research ingredients).  I wanted to like it, but for my sensitive skin it wasn&#x27;t a good choice.</li>
    <li> I have gone through several bottles of Neutrogena Naturals Purifying Facial Cleanser over the years. The last time I ran out, I thought I&#x27;d try another brand that was rated highly and produced amazing results for many people. So far, the &amp;#34;other brand&amp;#34; is not working out as great for me.  When I need to reorder, I will switch back to the Neutrogena cleanser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;- Gentle, yet effective in cleaning the T-zone.&lt;br /&gt;- Reasonably priced&lt;br /&gt;- Nice fragrance&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;- None</li>
    <li> One thing I DID NOT notice when I bought my first bottle in the store was that this product contains Salicylic Acid. Usually Salicylic Acid content is something cleansers try to brag about, and put in big letters on the label. I skimmed the back and didn&#x27;t see the usual \\&quot;SALICYCLIC ACID 0.3%\\&quot;, so I figured it didn&#x27;t have any.  What I missed was:  \\&quot;This face wash contains natural salicylic acid found in Willowbark bionutrients to penetrate...\\&quot;  If you&#x27;re looking for an SA cleanser, look no further. But, while SA may work for a lot of people, there&#x27;s an equal number out there where it usually has the opposite effect, and I&#x27;m one of them. After bad experiences with a number of different SA-based cleansers I&#x27;d sworn it off, until purchasing this cleanser without realizing it contained the acid.  Truth is, I&#x27;ve been happy with it, so I&#x27;m going to keep going. Maybe the SA content is extremely low, or perhaps the naturally-derived variant of SA isn&#x27;t as bad, but either way I can&#x27;t argue with the results, which have been generally positive. This is gentle enough to use twice a day, has a fairly mild fragrance (though I wish it didn&#x27;t have any at all), contains no oils, and has a short list of ingredients. That&#x27;s all I want out of a cleanser, so it gets 4 stars from me.</li>
    <li> This cleanser is nice and light, doesn&#x27;t foam up too much but you don&#x27;t have to use a lot, one pump is all you need. It smells nice and doesn&#x27;t burn your face when you use it like some cleansers do.</li>
    <li> I am typically very weary about picking a new cleanser. I ran out of my last one and decided to buy a different one because the one I had been using was too drying for use in colder weather. I saw this in a flashy display, bought it on a whim, and I am so glad I did. It is supposed to \\&quot;gently\\&quot; cleanse for \\&quot;fresh, clear skin,\\&quot; and that is exactly what it does. My skin feels very smooth and it didn&#x27;t strip the moisture from my skin. It foams very nicely without feeling like a soap, has a very pleasant scent and rinses away without leaving a residue. The best thing about it is the simple ingredient list; the back of the bottle says it is 90% natural, which is more than I can say about previous cleansers I have used. I will definitely purchase it again and perhaps try other products in this line as well.</li>
    <li> I liked this product when I first used it. It smells pretty nice and my face felt really clean and tight after and not overly dry. After the first day, my skin would sting while I used it. I used it for one week, and it stung almost every time. Since using this product, I&#x27;ve had one pimple, which is not a big deal because I break out occasionally no matter what product I use, but the thing that&#x27;s more concerning is that I started to get some red spots on my face. I don&#x27;t have overly sensitive skin. I live in New York and my skin has always been fine under city conditions. Clearly not the stuff for me!</li>
    <li> This new product from Neutrogena that purports to be natural is certainly as good as other products offered by the company, and if it uses more green-friendly components, so much the better.  I can verify that it is pleasant and effective, besides being non-irritating to the tender skin of redheads.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s nice when you use an unknown product and it performs better than expected.&lt;br /&gt;Neutrogena Naturals Facial Cleanser is a winner.&lt;br /&gt;You can honestly recommend it to friends.&lt;br /&gt;My wife is absolutely thrilled, which is what counts.</li>
    <li> I was excited to get this product to review because I&#x27;ve been using Neutrogena for about 20 years (or more).  For the last 15 years at least, I have been using Neutrogena Deep Clean.  I&#x27;ve used this product for three weeks now and it seems to work just as well.  It has a pleasant green apple-ish scent.  It is much thinner than the Deep Clean but lathers up nicely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t say whether the natural ingredients make any difference or not, I just know it cleans well and smells nice.  I didn&#x27;t notice any tightness to my skin or breakouts.  It did not dry out my skin.  The price seems comparable to the Deep Clean I&#x27;ve been buying for years.  I&#x27;d recommend this to friends.</li>
    <li> We are enjoying using the Neutrogena Naturals Purifying Cleanser. It does a good job cleaning and leaves the face feeling very fresh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We were disappointed that the dispenser spout was broken, but certainly easy to work around this. Harder to control the volume used without the spout though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over all would give this product a good rating. We have always enjoyed Neutrogena products.</li>
    <li> I bought this a store as I was looking for a more natural alternative. I&#x27;m a guy so I don&#x27;t make a huge fuss about these stuff but when you suffer from acne you kinda have to right? well the description says that this is suggested for those who have acne so I thought hey, it&#x27;s made from natural ingredients, I won&#x27;t feel bad putting artificial stuff on my face and it&#x27;ll help with my acne too.     The first time I tried it, it has a slight stinging sensation and the next day more pimples popped out. I was mad but over time the acne come and go but I wash with this stuff less often or dilute it with water to less the harshness.     I like the concept but I think they need to refine it a bit more.</li>
    <li> For the first day or two I was really happy with the product.  My skin felt very clean and not to dry.  After a few more days though I noticed my skin becoming more and more sensitive and irritated.  I have broken out worse than i have in a really long time and my skin is dry flaky red and sometimes painful.  I went out and bought an Olay cleanser today because I couldn&#x27;t stand another day with this product.  I guess \\&quot;Natural\\&quot; doesn&#x27;t mean gentle.</li>
    <li> I really liked the cleanser. I don&#x27;t know how hard these other users are scrubbing their faces, but it seemed gentle enough for me. It also has a nice, apple scent coming out of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cleanser, however, tends to use more water to cleanse your face.</li>
    <li> I love when I find products that are made from natural ingredients.  This product, Neutrogena Naturals Purifying Facial Cleanser, has \\&quot;No harsh chemical sulfates, parabens, petrochemicals, dyes, or phthalates.\\&quot; Naturally derived ingredients are very attractive to me. Sounded like a winner and I hoped it was, but my results were not as great as I had hoped.  The gel-like soup smelled very nice with a mild scent.  It lathered up on my face well and felt like it was doing its job.  After washing my face it felt very dry and tight, like when I use regular soap on an emergency basis.  I had to use twice as much moisturizer to have my face feel softer.  This was a bummer, but I continued to use it for a couple weeks thinking my skin would get used to it, or to just give the product a chance.  It still drys out my face after continued use so I will not buy it again.  I think the product is a step in the right direction and I hope they reformulate it to be gentle as well as natural.  3 stars for a natural product attempt and the nice scent.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been trying to find a replacement for another face wash. But the fragrance in this makes me sneeze and it makes my eyes itch and water.</li>
    <li> SKIP THESE TWO PARAGRAPHS IF YOU DONT WANT TO BOTHER WITH INTRODUCTION.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using many different face washes to help control my acne and oily prone skin since I was a teenager. I&#x27;ve recently come to understand that brands marketed purely for acne treatment with salicylic acid and benzoin and sulfer have little to no effect because, as a face wash, they do not stay on the skin long enough to serve a purpose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With that said, my saving grace for the past two years has been either Cetephil for normal skin, or Purpose. Both are free of fregrance and non-irritating with NO ALCOHOL, unlike most of the products on the market. Most of these things are skin irritants and only serve to worsen your condition. A big hint is, if you aren&#x27;t noticing a dramatic improvement in acne reduction withing 3 months, the current skin regimen is not working and you should try a different product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BEGINNING OF REVIEW&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, I follow a lot of tips from Paula, who runs the beautypedia site. I&#x27;ve been using Cetephil to wash my cleanser, The Body Shop&#x27;s gentle aloe no alcohol toner, and persa-gel 10 for my acne regimen, day and night, and it has been keeping my skin clear except during monthly visits from Aunt Flo (cant control those hormones). She gave this product a good review for an all natural face wash with low amounts of irritants, so i was really excited to try it. I bought mine at CVS on a BOGO sale for $10ish for two. I suppose using cetephil has just spoiled me or something, but I really dislike this face wash for numerous reasons. The first is the smell. Cetephil has a light odor that was off-putting to me at first, but I grew to like it and it reminds me of a more chemical baby powder. THIS product, however, smells bitter and vinegar-y, like a pithy apple that isn&#x27;t ripe yet mixed with beer. And as far as i can tell, thats also exactly how it feels when Im washing with it. If you have ANY broken skin, chapped lips, a sore nose,a popped pimple, or if you just waxed somewhere on your face, THIS STUFF is going to make you wish you didn&#x27;t. Almost every time I wash my face with this stuff, it stings. Mostly on my lips though. I had a runny nose once and it was sore for blowing my nose and DEAR GOD THIS FACE WASH MADE IT FEEL LIKE I PUT BLEACH ON MY SKIN.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SUMMARY:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-All natural,&lt;br /&gt;-nice packaging,&lt;br /&gt;-green product&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-$$ (medium priced for quantity. Between $6 and $7 at it&#x27;s cheapest.&lt;br /&gt;-No knockoff brands. CVS and some other stores have generic Cetephil knockoffs for between $4 and $6 for nearly twice the quantity.&lt;br /&gt;-STINGY, NOT FOR SENSITIVE SKIN,&lt;br /&gt;-VERY pungent smelling! (Might be a plus if you like sour/bitter/vinegar smells)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, i really REALLY wanted to like this product and i had bought two in faith that I would. I really feel bad about telling the person at the counter to go ahead and buy it for themselves before I tried it, thinking it was good advice. Next time I see him, I will make sure to tell him I was overconfident and tell him this product should be passed on for effective classics like Purpose and Cetephil (seriously, if you guys havent tried those yet, you&#x27;re missing out. They might not be fancy, but they are effective, especially if you have sensitive, acne-prone skin, and redness).</li>
    <li> I bought this because it said \\&quot;naturals\\&quot;...but this smells more like bathroom cleaner than facial cleanser!  And if you happen to get in your mouth or on your lips, it&#x27;s really bitter!  I won&#x27;t buy it again, very disappointed for a Neutrogena product.  I&#x27;m going back to my old facial cleanser.</li>
    <li> I didnt expect Neutrogena to be this good.I accually love this face wash it smells great and it doesnt dry out my skin.Leaves my face feeling soft and lucious*</li>
    <li> I have sensitive acne prone skin to begin with so I tried this product thinking their were less harsh chemicals in it and it might be better for my skin. Wrong After using it once I had a new zit, I thought my skin needed time to adjust to it so I kept using it for 2 weeks and it just got worse and worse. Finally I decided to go back to cetaphil even though there are parabens in it. I&#x27;m 22 years old and going out with pizza face in not acceptable. I gave this product a real try though.</li>
    <li> I bought this product at Target, figuring I would try it out. As I&#x27;ve grown out of my teen years I find that I don&#x27;t break out as bad or as often with acne and decided to try a face wash that wasn&#x27;t specifically for acne treatment. The first few days I really liked it. I do think a moisturizer would have been a good idea as it did seem to dry out my skin a bit. I really did like the product, as it smells nice and it does clean really well. However, about 4 days after I started using it (and I was only using it once a day) I noticed a rash on my face that was dry and red. It got worse the next day so I was sure it was the face wash. I stopped using it and the rash went away and hasn&#x27;t come back.&lt;br /&gt;I really wish I wasn&#x27;t allergic to this product, I really do like the scent and the way it made my face feel but I can&#x27;t use something that I&#x27;m allergic to. I would give this product a try but do so in a non-conspicuous place or during a time when you don&#x27;t have any major events for a bit, just in case.</li>
    <li> I am 49 and going through perimenopause, which is causing the worst acne of my life! I was plagued with deep, cystic, painful acne. I found the problem worse during the warmer, more humid months. I started using this cleanser, plus an over the counter acne treatment (also containing salicylic acid) twice a day and my skin is doing so much better. This product does not bother my sensitive skin. The dark acne scars are even starting to fade. I wash for at least 1 to 2 minutes twice a day. I just make sure to follow with a good moisturizer, as is usual after washing. Women of a certain age, there IS hope!</li>
    <li> I was running out of my normal cleanser so I picked this up at the store along with the matching moisturize. BIG MISTAKE! I don&#x27;t have super sensitive skin so I was very shocked when I woke up the next morning after using them completely broken out w/ hives and pimples all over my face. I am completely blotchy and red. I have never had a reaction to anything like this. Some may like this, but it is a NEVER AGAIN and IN THE TRASH from me.</li>
    <li> If I worked at an old hospital and got used to the smell first maybe this would be okay.  It smells horrible!  I got it on half my face and felt sick so I washed it off and still smelled it on myself all day.  I don&#x27;t care if it worked, I had to throw out the bottle because I can&#x27;t use something that smells this bad.  If you have no olfactory senses, you might want to give this a try!</li>
    <li> I was SO HAPPY when I discovered this in the isles of Walmart. A natural face cleanser with the Neutrogena name? Brilliant. I checked out the ingredient list of course, and then impulsively purchased it. All the ingredients are plant-derived except for one (I think. I don&#x27;t have the bottle with me). It has a liquid (more on the gel side than the water-y side) consistency and a weird smell - not bad, but definitely shouldn&#x27;t be made into a perfume anytime soon. Some days, I would dilute it a bit with water and some days, I wouldn&#x27;t but I always got the same results in the shower: stinging and after the shower: not that great.     It wasn&#x27;t a horrible cleanser (my face did feel clean), but it didn&#x27;t give me results that I wanted. It made my combination skin quite flaky and greasy...not oily, but greasy and while it cleared some whiteheads on the sides of my face, it gave me acne on my neck...It was weird. I don&#x27;t like it, but I will have to try the other products before I can completely discard this one as I really liked that the packaging was \\&quot;green\\&quot; (the ink was printed onto the bottle and not paper on top of the bottle). And if I remember right, the ink was made of soy. But I could be wrong. Overall, it was just a weird experience.</li>
    <li> Ok, this cleanser works well enough for me (I have combination to oily skin that tends to be on the sensitive side, just for reference), but the &amp;#34;how well this product works for me&amp;#34; department is not where my issue lies. What I truly have a problem with is the immensely poor packaging. You probably know how normal pump dispensed products work, you just push down and twist a little, and you&#x27;re good to go, right? Well, that was certainly not the case here. I tried twisting, I tried pressing down, pulling up, and endless combinations of the three, but to no avail. I just could not unlock this pump, so I decided to seek help elsewhere, by enlisting the assistance of my brother. After maybe five minutes of using the techniques I had already failed with, he pressed down really hard, so hard that both he and I thought he would break the bottle, and the pump finally gave way. Needless to say, cleanser exploded everywhere, much to my brother&#x27;s displeasure. So, like I said before, it is a good cleanser, but after that whole pump fiasco, I doubt I will be so quick to recommend it.</li>
    <li> I am 48, but I still have very oily skin and occasional acne. My daughter is in the acne-prone teen years and we both LOVE this cleanser. I started buying it for myself and she started using too. Her skin has never been clearer. We both really like it and I only wish I could get it on subscribe &amp; save. I don&#x27;t understand the comments about the smell. I don&#x27;t even notice a smell. And my skin can be sensitive and I have had no problem with this cleanser.</li>
    <li> I have always been a fan of most Neutrogena products, especially when I am not able to purchase the more expensive brands such as Kiehls.  There is no obnoxious scent or perfume odor.  Just a neutral facial cleanser that works up into a nice lather.  The lather easily cleanses the face as it claims, at least mine, and I get that nice clean feeling afterwards.  There is only a hit of firming effects, but I am not at an age, where that is a concern for me so all the better.  Nothing worse, than having an over the top tight feeling that accompanies many facial cleaners.  Good choice</li>
    <li> This is the first Natural face soap I have ever tried so I was not sure what to expect- but I was amazed- it cleaned my face a lot better than most of the non-natural brands out there! I don&#x27;t get a lot of pimples- but I do get a few every so often and have seen my fair share of blackheads and this soap was very good and cleaning them right up. My skin tends to be more oily than dry so unlike some of the reviewers on here I did not notice my skin getting dried out. There were a couple of issues with the soap but generally here is how I see it:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;- Cleans thoroughly&lt;br /&gt;- Removes most blackheads and helps clear up white heads&lt;br /&gt;- lathers nicely&lt;br /&gt;- smells ok&lt;br /&gt;- 90% Natural ingredients&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;- No directions for use&lt;br /&gt;- Face turns red after using (this does go away within an hour or so)&lt;br /&gt;- Soap consistency is kind of watery and a little sticky&lt;br /&gt;- Feels like it is a little hard to rinse off&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As sort of an allergy note- I live with someone who has a lot of allergies and I have to be careful with this soap (aka: don&#x27;t spill it and let them touch the residue) because there are Coconut (which is something they are allergic to) Derived ingredients in it. Just because it is Neutragena does not mean it is Hypoallergenic (it does not say it is on the bottle, but a lot of people assume).</li>
    <li> Let me say upfront that I&#x27;m past the zit age.  Well past it.  And even when I was a teenager, they were few and far between.  So when I tell you that the morning after I first used this cleanser I woke up with a huge zit on my cheek, you will understand why my first thought was \\&quot;Great Godfrey Daniels, what did that stuff do to me?\\&quot; Possibly I was just experiencing some kind of deep cleansing action... bringing problems to the surface... whatever.  It hasn&#x27;t happened again -- for which I remain grateful -- and my skin looks and feels good, so that&#x27;s really what counts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I like about it is that it doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out and it doesn&#x27;t smell like cheap perfume.  What I don&#x27;t like is that it doesn&#x27;t really lather very well, and it does leave some dirt, which a quick swipe with toner and a cotton ball will show.  Both of these issues are minor compared to the fact that it contains no parabens, pthalates or any other icky and potentially dangerous chemicals.  Whether all the added vitamins and botanicals help my skin... well that&#x27;s hard to judge.  All I can say for sure is that I don&#x27;t mind using it, and my skin says \\&quot;thanks\\&quot; when I do.  That&#x27;s good enough for me.</li>
    <li> Bought this last week when I got contact dermatitis or some internal reaction from neem usage.  It was a lot gentler than I expected.  My pimples and some ingrown hairs had calmed down.  I felt better.  My mistake was using this in conjunction with Zinc for Acne - the B6 probably made my facial hair and spots worse.  I like natural products, which is why I gave real natural black soap a try for a few months (my face improved after I stopped).  This isn&#x27;t the most organic as it still has \\&quot;fragrance\\&quot; (unnecessary as it doesn&#x27;t make it smell that great to be honest... still too chemical).  The lathering is a minor issue, and it takes a few seconds longer to wash off that \\&quot;film\\&quot; people complained about.  Still, if it&#x27;s working for the most part, I&#x27;ll stick by it.  Neutrogena can just remove the fragrance, and the Sodium Lauroyl Sarcosinate concerns me a bit (it&#x27;s not the usual SLS, though).  I hope my skin doesn&#x27;t become immune.  I also use witch hazel and organic shea butter as a moisturizer and mark treatment.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. It&#x27;s very gentle and it smells pretty good. It gets all of my makeup off and doesn&#x27;t dry out my face too much or cause me to break out. Pair this with a decent moisturizer, and it&#x27;s all the skin care you need. I switched to this stuff from Cetaphil and will probably never go back. This two pack was a pretty good deal when I bought it for $13 back in May, but now that it&#x27;s $17 I will probably buy it somewhere else. If it were still the original price that I paid, I would probably buy this again.</li>
    <li> I bought this product at Target, it was on sale and I was trying to save money. Big mistake. I used it for 3 days and I&#x27;ve broken out in a rash on my forehead and my nose, and it&#x27;s made my rosacia  worse! I haven&#x27;t changed anything else about my skin care routine except for this product so I&#x27;m sure this is what caused it. And reading the other reviews from people who had the same reaction, I&#x27;ve tossed this in the trash and bought a higher quality facial cleanser. I&#x27;ll save money somewhere else. It&#x27;s not worth the stinging itchy burn that this product left me with.</li>
    <li> I would be careful about using this product. I normally stick to the same kind but it was on sale so I thought I&#x27;d try something new. Big Mistake! It might just be that I&#x27;m allergic to something in it, but it made my face break out in a horrible red rash and it burned like crazy! I do have sensitive skin. So I would just look out before you buy it!</li>
    <li> Swollen, red, itchy, streaks of rash across my face for many many hours. I thought at first that the redness was a hot shower effect or sunburning though the redness looked like extreme sunburning and hurt so bad. I used it each day for a week and the conditions got progressively worse. I will never use another Neutrogena product again. I don&#x27;t have particularly sensitive skin, maybe a bit dry, fairly normal otherwise. I purchased this as I prefer to be able to pronounce what ingredients are going onto my face and have been really disappointed to see the company trying to deceive buyers by using the tagline &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34;. Not okay Neutrogena! Living in Australia now, and given they have stricter laws generally on this sort of thing I was shocked to see the product line to be allowed to be released here. If you have purchased this product and your face is currently burning an antihistamine along with cool water to cleanse off any additional residue followed by an actually natural face cream should take care of most symptoms, at least it did in my case.</li>
    <li> the most refreshing cleaning face wash i&#x27;ve ever had. feels like its not only cleaning, but nourishing my sensitive skin!</li>
    <li> I tried this product while visiting my family over the holidays. It cleared up my skin. It can leave your skin dry. If you use a light nightly moisturizer it seems to be the right balance and corrects this. I also noticed if I start to break out the break outs heal quicker sometimes overnight! It really works like a natural salicylic. Everyone has different skin types and I have read the conflicting reviews.If you are prone to break outs give this product a try and stick with it for at least a few weeks. I have had great results.</li>
    <li> It is convenient for me to order basics online as I don&#x27;t have a lot of time to get to the store. Having a 2 pack is even better! This is a nice, gentle face wash that foams when you add water to it. It shipped quickly and is a great product!</li>
    <li> This is my favorite face cleanser. It rinses clean without overdrying and doesn&#x27;t leave a film behind like some other cleansers.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had seb.-derm. for decades (facial/scalp skin oils especially susceptable to dandruff-causing yeast) and have used prescription topical applications for as long, with so-so satisfaction, and I&#x27;ve most recently been using rather expensive Ketoconazole products with much better results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But it occurred to me that if I could significantly reduce the facial-scalp oils a couple of times/day, that would \\&quot;starve\\&quot; the yeasts and pretty much end the symptoms (greasy flakes, redness). Some research online led me to try this Neutrogenia product (bought at a local supermarket). TWO applications/washes in one day suggested I was on the right track, a couple more days told me I&#x27;d found \\&quot;medical Nirvana.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As someone else stated, I now also have one bottle on the vanity and one in the shower, and I&#x27;ve just begun to use the facial cleanser as a shampoo follow-up with equally-better scalp results to accompany my facial results...</li>
    <li> Great product does not dry my face or leave it feeling unclean it smells wonderful leaves your face honestly clean not striped clean</li>
    <li> I used this product for about a month and didn&#x27;t really see any benefits from it with my acne, and I actually noticed my skin becoming more oily. After that I stopped using it for a while. I used it this evening and I put it on my skin and then let it sit for a minute while I used the restroom. While it was on my skin I felt a mild irritation and I washed it off to discover a chemical burn on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;I already have a red skintone, and my skin is sensitive, but this is just unacceptable.</li>
    <li> So this review is going to be slightly gross, so reader beware!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I have gotten pregnant I keep hearing about how my skin care would have to change. So I asked my Doctor and he confirmed my fears. I could no longer use my normal acne wash on my extremely acne prone skin. After doing some research I decided to give the Neutrogena Naturals line a try since most people seem to be having luck with it. To be honest this morning was only my second time trying it, and I think i&#x27;ll continue to try it just more carefully. Ok, so the incident: With my pregnancy i have been battling major morning sickness. I&#x27;m 13 weeks and still throwing up every morning and usually at the most inopportune times, for example: when I&#x27;m washing my face in the shower. So I slather the cleanser on my face and grab my Mia and start cleaning. Well then I start gagging. I don&#x27;t have time to rinse my face while i&#x27;m throwing up bile and I start to get a burning sensation on my cheek, but i&#x27;m a little busy so I don&#x27;t think anything of it. I finish throwing up and continue to wash and rinse my face and finish my shower. When I got out of the shower and looked in the mirror my face was RED. It hurt to the touch and was slightly swollen. It&#x27;s been about 3 hours since my shower and the reaction seems to have gone away. I think i&#x27;ll still use the product, i&#x27;ll just have to be more careful about how long it&#x27;s on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do like it. It dries out my skin just enough and the moisturizer feels wonderful. So hopefully there aren&#x27;t any further reactions.</li>
    <li> I am very much into using products without parabens, sulfates and other harmful chemicals. I checked the back of the packaging and all the ingredients seemed safe, none stood out to me as having had come up in my research of harmful ingredients to look out for. After the first time using it i had a MAJOR reaction of puffy, red, itchy eyes and skin all over my face, which resulted in not being able to wear makeup, wash my face with any product r even moisturise for days without intense burning and irritation!!&lt;br /&gt;I would just like to add that I used many average, cheap skincare products for years before swapping to a more natural range, and have never even had a reaction from those. I will not buy this again, or anything else from their naturals range which im sure is NOT natural if this reaction was caused. Whatever they&#x27;re using instead of parabens and chemicals is far worse in my opinion!</li>
    <li> Ive always used Neutrogena and never had any problems with my skin. I rarely ever had a pimple or any sort of blemish. From the first day i started using this i broke out... I tried it again the next day and had more acne. For someone who never has acne i sure broke out a lot with this stuff :\</li>
    <li> I had bought this product at the store, hoping to help my redness and small blackhead problem areas. I had put it in on the shower and rinsed off my hair so it could soak into my skin for a few minutes. Worst idea. My skin burned in less than a minute and I was in so much pain. I took a look when I got out and my face was completely puffy and red! Unfortunately I am out of benedryl so Tylenol had to suffice. The swelling has gone down a little with the help of cold water. I went online and I&#x27;ve read 100&#x27;s of people also had the same reaction to many different neutrogena products! Although it seems to be getting better I am mortified! It is terrifying that I could be in that much pain over a face was that was on for 1 minute. I&#x27;m not prone to allergies and by no means have sensitive skin. It worries me that I could wake up with even worse symptoms! Please don&#x27;t waste your money on this brand! There are some people who&#x27;ve had luck with it but it&#x27;s not worth the risk of having a severely painful reaction that many, including me, have had. Really disappointed with this.</li>
    <li> Very nice. Easy rinse! I hate when it&#x27;s late and I&#x27;m getting ready for bed and the soap won&#x27;t come off my face in the sink. By the time I feel rinsed the floor is full of water. Now I have to clean the floor. Now I&#x27;m wide awake. Not this product. Cleans well, and rinses clean also.</li>
    <li> [UPDATE] When I 1st wrote this review the ingredients weren&#x27;t shown on this amazon page... atleast my review made them man up and finally list the ingredients. But now you can see they&#x27;re lying about it being natural because everybdy can see that sodium bezoate and fragrances are in it. They use chemicals in fragrances so the \\&quot;no chemical\\&quot; claim they&#x27;ve got up for this soap is a lie. The frangrances in it are why people on here are complaining about the stinging and breaking out in rashes with this soap. Buy a lot better facial cleanser that&#x27;s ACTUALLY NATURAL on here called C. Booth Derma C 24 Daily Vitamins Healthy Skin Facial Cleanser. Now that soap actually does what this soap wish it did without hurting your skin. See my review on it on my review page&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[1ST REVIEW] I&#x27;m checking ths product out to see if its good enough to buy and like a crapload of other so called \\&quot;natural\\&quot; products I can&#x27;t find the list of ingredients in it. The fact that they&#x27;re not listed anywhere on the neutrogena natural website or anywhere on here or the reviews makes this product lose a bunch of stars. Common sense, if you make a natural product with natural ingredients List - Them - In - The - Ad. People who buy natural products wanna know exactly what they&#x27;re buying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*ADDED* This is a perfect example and the exact reason why the company chose NOT TO just easily list the so called \\&quot;natural\\&quot; ingredients on the front page of this soap&#x27;s ad and why I dont trust companies like this who claim their products are \\&quot;natural\\&quot; and then don&#x27;t list the ingredients anywhere in the ad. This product IS NOT NATURAL. Whoever finally hunted down the list of ingredients hiding somewhere on the site, and then listed them in the comments under this post, just listed the non natural chemicals that are in it. The ingredients in an actual Natural product should be easy to find on the front page of the ad or atleast in an ingredients section somewhere in the ad. This only happens when the companys not trying to hide something.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The list of ingredients for this soap (someone claimed they found on the webiste somewhere) says it has Sodium Benzoate and (chemical) Fragrances. Both which are either cancer causing or can harm your skin (allergic reactions [fragrance] or damage to DNA [sodium benzoate]. And aren&#x27;t natural (the fragrance anyway - sodium bezoate is not a chemical but has shown to be cancer causing mixed with other things and has damaged DNA ). They&#x27;ve even got asteriks (**) sitting next to them because they know they COULD be harmful. Just check out the review someone else left for this soap titled \\&quot;Cleans well but not nearly as gentle as it says it is\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;by Kithi Prem-on. That person said the soap stung their skin. Why would anyone have a problem with a \\&quot;natural\\&quot; soap stinging their skin if its really natural?. Because of the chemical fragrances and sodium benzoate they put in it. I know for a fact you have to watch out for companies like these who market \\&quot;natural\\&quot; products to make sure the product is really made from all natural ingredients. Half of the time they&#x27;re not. Because \\&quot;natural\\&quot; products aren&#x27;t checked or regulated by the government like organic products are. That&#x27;s all I needed to know to know not to buy this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(UPDATE AUGUST 24 2011) I finally found a realllly good facial cleanser on here thats actually really ALL NATURAL plus it has vitamins in it.. its called C. Booth Derma C 24 Daily Vitamins Healthy Skin Facial Cleanser. [[[[This is a perfect example of an ACTUAL REAL NATURAL PRODUCT having no problem showing all the natural ingredients that are in it on the amazon page]]].  My skin is so sensitive to everything with chemicals and natural that Ill break out in either pimples and one time a rash from a fake \\&quot;natural\\&quot; indian soap I got on here called Medix. That one had green dye and fragrance added to it and now I know is why I broke out. The rash left bad milia bumps 5 months later that I&#x27;m just nowgetting rid of after using witch hazel a couple other products and that C.

    <li> I use this product every night...I work in a post office and would get skin blemishes on my face from all the dirt. It&#x27;s basically Oxy pads without the chemicals and the rough pad. It does its job and I was amazed at how well it cleans my face. I also use it on my neck and hands with some good results...it&#x27;s not too harsh and has helped allieviate my dry hands. But I will say...avoid this product if you are sensitive to the Salicylic acid in Oxy pads, the Willowbark might be too strong. Just keep that in mind. Otherwise...for a natural product...I&#x27;m very excited about this one! Thanks Neutrogena!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this Neutrogena Naturals face wash for a few weeks now, and I think it works well as a make-up remover. It takes off my water-proof mascara better than the stuff I was using before. However, I don&#x27;t like it as just a face-wash. It doesn&#x27;t really help with my acne, so I use another product for that. This can dry your skin out a little, but I already use a moisturizer, which seems to prevent that. I suggest using this as a face-wash with another product if you have acne.</li>
    <li> I tried this after using the Neutrogena Naturals Fresh Cleansing + Makeup Remover.  I had initially wanted to try this product, but my local store was sold out so I went with the closest thing.  The Fresh Cleansing + Makeup Remover was really great.  When I saw that this product was finally in stock, I decided to try it since I don&#x27;t wear makeup and didn&#x27;t know how much I really needed a cleanser that doubled as a makeup remover.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was let down by this purifying facial cleanser, though.  It&#x27;s still a good cleanser and does a good job on my sensitive and oily skin.  I have no complaints there.  My main gripe was that this cleanser is very runny.  I found myself using more of it to get the same coverage and clean feeling that I did with the Fresh Cleansing + Makeup Remover.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent on this product is light and, like the other Naturals products I&#x27;ve used, very pleasant and not at all heavy or overbearing.  Overall, I liked this product but enjoy the thicker, creamier cleanser that Neutrogena makes.  I also use their purifying scrub every other day to get a little exfoliation.  (I can&#x27;t use it every day since my skin doesn&#x27;t respond well to daily exfoliation, regardless of the scrub I&#x27;m using.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B004D248U4 Neutrogena Naturals Fresh Cleansing + Makeup Remover, 6-Ounces  (Pack of 2)]]</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d been looking for a new face cleanswer and wanted to give this a try.  At 44, I have older skin more in need of renewal than strong cleansing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My first impression wasn&#x27;t great for a side reason: the top wouldn&#x27;t open no matter how long I twisted.  I really despise those twist open pump dispensers and this one irritates me to no end.  I had to throw away the top and because it isn&#x27;t viscous, I end up putting too much on my hands.  It&#x27;s far too expensive to waste that way.  I wish it came with a very narrow cap and spout instead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the product inside, it does feel gentle and I don&#x27;t have dry harsh skin after use.  It has a very light and refreshing smell - more of a botanical green than anything flowerly, which is nice.  But as others have noted, it does seem to stay on the skin in a thin film and sometimes I can taste it later in the day. The taste doesn&#x27;t bother me really - but I would like the feeling that I am actually washing the product off my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would I get it again?  Yes, definitely, I will.  It really does work softly yet cleanly and I can share it with my husband and daughter as well.  It&#x27;s a great product for an entire family to use - rather than solely targeting women of a certain age or teens with skin problems.  To have only one bottle of face cleanser instead of 3 is a plus for us.</li>
    <li> I gave this product to my wife and she loves it! It will be a staple on her bathroom counter. We use several neutrogena products - all of them are top notch.</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin, and this soap does not irritate my skin or dry it out unduly.  I use it with the facial moisturizer.  I didn&#x27;t realize how much this helped keep down the red in my skin until I ran out and had to switch, temporarily, to something else.  Not planning to run out again!</li>
    <li> It worked for me for a few days, but then I started to notice my face becoming red and hot after I used it (which other reviewers had a problem with as well I noticed!). I do have fairly sensitive skin, but I have used nearly ever other kind of Neutrogena face wash and cleanser without having any type of allergic reaction. Sadly, I threw this out and am going back to what I used before.</li>
    <li> I really wanted to like this cleanser, but it gave me the WORST acne. I used it for 4 weeks thinking it would \\&quot;clear up\\&quot;, but it just kept getting worse. I finally switched to by old stand-by and w/in two weeks everything was cleared up and life continued! However, I wished I had never even tried -- what a bad month!!</li>
    <li> I am a diehard Aveda user but their products are changing and of course very expensive so I&#x27;ve been wanting a comparable product.  I think I have found it!  Altho, it&#x27;s only been 2 days I am extremely happy.  I would have like to have it more like a cold cream so no water is needed.  But with a moist washcloth it comes off and cleans very easily.  I did read one review saying something about Salicylic Acid and I don&#x27;t do well with that but so far I&#x27;ve been ok.  I paid less than $7 at Walgreens and I&#x27;m thrilled.  So is my wallet! Watch out Aveda...</li>
    <li> Face washes should always be the cheapest products in your repertoire because they stay on the face the least amount of time so dont really need fancy ingredients. However finding a face wash that doesn&#x27;t use harsh surfectants/cleansers but still has something to help with oil production is beyond difficult.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i suffer from a crap load of blackheads and the occasional pimple and oily skin. However i also use retinoids/salicylic acid in combination with chemical peels in cycles to treat my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;brands tend to forget that acneic skin can also be sensitive skin due to medicated treatments more often than not used to treat the issues. So what ends up happening is you have salicylic acid in your cleanser, in your toner, in your moisturizer and then at night you&#x27;re using retinoids/Benzyl Peroxide or antibiotics etc etc&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;and you over strip your skin which thus causes you to produce more and more oil throughout the day. As well your skin gets so irritated by stripping face washes ( and all the other stuff) that you can be less likely to sustain the medicated treatments as well they can damage your barrier, mess with your ph levels and just be mighty unfriendly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;however i wear sunscreen and makeup everyday so it is still important that the cleanser be effective in removing debris/makeup but that does not mean it should leave my face squeaky clean..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FYI squeaky clean after a cleanser?? is NOT GOOD. you&#x27;ve stripped the natural lipids that protect your skin and thus ur skin will overcompensate and make more later and leave ur skin tight and uncomfortable after cleansing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So my theory is now the following:&lt;br /&gt;1. find a cheap face wash that uses mild surfactants to cleanse for less irritation and avoid pore clogging ingredients ie oils etc&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And i think Neutrogena has finally made me a happy camper. :D&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Previous to this i was using La roche posay effaclar H mousse fro 17-18 bucks .. i picked up Neutrogena naturals for 9.97 at walmart so i was more than happy&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product does not strip my skin ( ie no squeaky clean.. but leaves it soft and smooth)&lt;br /&gt;-dissolves my makeup/debris while leaving my skin soft&lt;br /&gt;-lathers moderately ( it uses a milder SLS derivative which is 6th on the ingredient list so there&#x27;s not a large  percentage and likely used primarily to boost the lather.. this is a well formulated cleanser in that glycerin ( a water attractor) is listed prior making the SLS deriv unlikely to irritate the skin, damage your barrier function or cause redness)&lt;br /&gt;-contains willowbark ( for those with acneic skin this is a nice additive as it has antimicrobial properties like standardized salicylic acid however being so low on the ingredient list i&#x27;m not sure how much it&#x27;s standardized to . i&#x27;m going to guess something like 0.2 to 0.3% at most so if u have acne u need a leave on treatment .. which is how it should be anyway)&lt;br /&gt;-glycerin ( as i mentioned above . this is a great product in face washes especially formulated this way..it&#x27;s a humectant and draws water to the skin but doesn&#x27;t clog pores despite common belief)&lt;br /&gt;- the fragrance ( okay so no issue for me but i do agree this could have been an A++++ formulation with no fragrance if not a lot less .. i actually think it smells great but it is powerful and may not be friendly to those with very sensitive skin)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this with Clearasil daily pore cleansing pad w/ 2% salicylic acid  ( these pads are amazing btww!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway it&#x27;s a great product whether you&#x27;re using other medicated products or not and I recommend for normal to oily skin types...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy!eutrogena naturals for 9.97 at walmart so i was more than happy&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product does not strip my skin ( ie no squeaky clean.. but leaves it soft and smooth)&lt;br /&gt;-dissolves my makeup/debris while leaving my skin soft&lt;br /&gt;-lathers moderately ( it uses a milder SLS derivative which is 6th on the ingredient list so there&#x27;s not a large  percentage and likely used primarily to boost the lather.. this is a well formulated cleanser in that glycerin ( a water attractor) is listed prior making the SLS deriv unlikely to irritate the skin, damage your barrier function or cause redness)&lt;br /&gt;-contains willowbark ( for those with acneic skin this is a nice additive as it has antimicrobial properties like standardized salicylic acid however being so low on the ingredient list i&#x27;m not sure how much it&#x27;s standardized to . i&#x27;m going to guess something like 0.2 to 0.3% at most so if u have acne u need a leave on treatment .. which is how it should be anyway)&lt;br /&gt;-glycerin ( as i mentioned above . this is a great product in face washes especially formulated this way..it&#x27;s a humectant and draws water to the skin but doesn&#x27;t clog pores despite common belief)&lt;br /&gt;- the fragrance ( okay so no issue for me but i do agree this could have been an A++++ formulation with no fragrance if not a lot less .. i actually think it smells great but it is powerful and may not be friendly to those with very sensitive skin)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this with Clearasil daily pore cleansing pad w/ 2% salicylic acid  ( these pads are amazing btww!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway it&#x27;s a great product whether you&#x27;re using other medicated products or not and I recommend for normal to oily skin types...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enjoy!</li>
    <li> Loving the new Neutrogena naturals facial cleanser. The size of the product with pump top&lt;br /&gt;Is a great value. Skin feels really clean after the gym or working in the garden. But skin doesn&#x27;t&lt;br /&gt;get  that \\&quot; tight\\&quot; feeling which is great.</li>
    <li> This seems to be helping with what little acne my daughter is showing.  Uses every night to wash face before bed.  She is pretty happy with the outcome.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this product.  I&#x27;ve slowly made a strong move to replace all of my older \\&quot;toxic\\&quot; skin/hair care products to natural ones.  I don&#x27;t use products containing parabends, phthalates, sodium laureth sulfate, etc.  Nobody knows the long term effects of these checmicals, and I&#x27;d rather not find out.  The problem with \\&quot;going natural\\&quot; is the extreme cost of most products.  Very expensive.  This cleanser however is very modestly priced, has s a nice mild smell, and does the job.  It doesn&#x27;t break the bank either.  I&#x27;ll never stop buying this, so I hope Neutrogena doesn&#x27;t stop making it.  Other companies charge $28 for a similar size of their \\&quot;natural\\&quot; face cleanser.  Keep it up Neutrogena, and introduce a natural face moisturizer too!</li>
    <li> Best I&#x27;ve ever tried !!!cleans deep.. little goes long way and you can leave on face for a few minutes  for mask effect.. Caution not to long ...can and will peel skin ... Prices here not so great... get it in store..</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used very expensive skin care products and very cheap ones, and in at least 10 years of actively trying to find the right one for my face, this is the first I&#x27;ve found that actually works. I was actually using a very expensive new product line by Rodan &amp; Fields (the makers of Proactiv) before I tried this...it worked great for a few weeks and then I was back to the same old blocked pores and acne, which is what seemed to happen with all the products I tried. I tried this on a whim, and couldn&#x27;t believe my luck. If they ever stop making it, I&#x27;m screwed. Light scent, just the right amount of lather, and my skin was clearer after the first 2 uses. No more blackheads, and my breakouts have diminished drastically. The most amazing thing about this product is what it&#x27;s done for my pores, which have always been large and noticeable...I can hardly see them anymore. It feels as if my skin is so clean that my pores are actually closing up. People starting noticing the difference in my skin after about a week and asking me if I was using a different makeup or something. I have a bottle on my sink, and one in the shower. I LOVE it. Please Neutrogena, never stop making this stuff. Clearly, from the reviews, lots of people are having the same experience, so we&#x27;d all be devastated!</li>
    <li> I love this product. I have the most crazy sensitive skin and cannot use much of anything without having a reaction. This gently removes my makeup completely and leaves my skin very soft. Has a natural light scent</li>
    <li> Removed my pipples in few days, NICE</li>
    <li> WORKS WELL WITHIN TWO TO THREE DAYS. YOU HAVE TO CONTINUE USING IT FOR WHAT IT WORTH</li>
    <li> I was looking to buy a cheap cleanser in the drugstore to replace the Naive foam I&#x27;d run out of. This was what I picked after some deliberation in CVS, and I&#x27;m still not sure if I&#x27;m impressed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first time I used it, I was really impressed by how fresh and clean it made my skin feel. Another heads up for all the girls and guys with blackheads out there, this is a minor miracle for them. All of my blackheads disappeared with the use of this product, which is a huge plus in my book. It also has a nice, light fragrance and a gel consistency. It leaves your face feeling soft and thoroughly cleansed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing about this cleanser I wish I could change is how drying it is. It&#x27;s a huge deal to me when a product is drying, because I have naturally dry skin as is - I don&#x27;t need to aggravate it further. Unfortunately, this cleanser dried up my skin pretty badly, with my face feeling itchy and stinging with its lack of moisture. I tried to remedy this by attacking my face with Hada Labo several times a day, and that really did help, but seeing as it was winter it could only do so much. I guess that&#x27;s another plus for acne-prone an oily-skinned folks, though, so I highly recommend this to them! I still use this cleanser to purify my face(purging blackheads and such) but I don&#x27;t think I can use it for everyday cleansing.</li>
    <li> Well this stuff is not worth the suffering. It has a terrible smell and taste (I know but it just happens). I never noticed any changes over the month or so that I used it. Move on...nothing to see here.</li>
    <li> I really wanted to like this! My age-sensitive skin needs delicate care, but it also needs a good cleaning. I thought this would be a great product, so I bought a bottle and tried it. Never have I had my face break out and flare like this before!! Every square inch of my face is red and tight feeling. It feels like I&#x27;ve gotten a bad sunscreen, and I had to re-clean my face just to clean the product off of me. It&#x27;s going back tomorrow and I&#x27;m going to buy Simple or Olay regenerist, like I should have done in the first place. I&#x27;m going to use my Tarte BB moisturizer to help cover the effects for now.</li>
    <li> I usually use Bare Minerals face wash but I didn&#x27;t have time to drive out of town for face wash so I ran to my local pharmacy and picked up the \\&quot;natural\\&quot; face wash. I&#x27;m sorry, but anything that smells like that is not natural. I thought it would be gentle on my sensitive skin and I was so wrong. My face started burning immediately and tears sprung to my eyes due to the pain. I couldn&#x27;t rinse it off fast enough. I thought it might have just been me but my sister used it right after me and had the same thing happen to her! Both of our faces were red and splotchy! And now my face is flaking. By the way, I am a 24 year old woman and I have clear even skin(before using this, anyway.)This is by far the worst face wash I have ever used. You have now been warned.</li>
    <li> Stuff like this has hippy PETA vegan pseudoscientists backing it.  If you don&#x27;t mind leaving a coating of mysterious \\&quot;natural\\&quot; unpurified compounds all over your face, then this is for you.</li>
    <li> The light smell plus the light fresh feeling I get after washing my face with this is just wonderful. At night I wash with this product, then use olay regenerist night elixir which has glycolic acid. When I wake up in the morning my face feels amazing.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about a year now and I love it! My skin is finally clear, of course with a few breakouts here and there when I get really stress, and I couldn&#x27;t be happier. Plus now that I know I can get it in a 2 pack for such a low price I will definiately buy it from here again.</li>
    <li> I give this product negative 5 stars.I bought this product on Friday and used it that night. Thought why not says gentle if nothing else it wouldn&#x27;t do anything. Well that&#x27;s not what happened at all Saturday woke up face was swollen so I just iced it off and on that night little bumps started to show up on my chin and around my nose. Did not use anything on my face since this product, and Sunday I woke up and just about screamed but my face was so swollen I couldn&#x27;t. It looks like 10,000 little white heads on my face along with swollen and oozy I look like Toxic Avenger meets poison oak. So I rush to the ER they said it had to been what I used and this product was the only new thing I used in a long time. I&#x27;m on 5 different meds, a steroid, pain, itchy and burning, antibiotics, and something to keep them down. I guess I&#x27;m going to feel like $%!* the next two weeks I can&#x27;t go outside, work, if I play with my kid my face starts pounding. WHO&#x27;S UP FOR A CLASS ACTION LAW SUIT? I&#x27;ve read many thing about this product after this happened and I hear a lot of the same thing and they need to find out what causing these reactions and RECALL THIS PRODUCT so no one else goes though this, wouldn&#x27;t wish it on anyone. If interested in this product don&#x27;t just go for it DO A TEST PATCH FIRST behind your ear or something and wait 48 hours..STILL DO NOT RECOMMEND this product</li>
    <li> Love they way this makes my face feel.  I have been virtually break out free since I began using this (about 2 years now).</li>
    <li> Great for sensitive skin, came in a two pack for a great price.  Not a lot of suds and keeps the face clean and clear of acne,</li>
    <li> Had been looking for a natural skin care line. I love this product and have been very pleased. Cleans my skin gently and no residue or harsh chemicals. No long list of unknowable ingredients.</li>
    <li> Feels great, doesn&#x27;t overdry- I love the scent.  The ingredients list is as minimal as you can find in the mainstream brands.  Recommended if you are looking for a less chemical alternative.</li>
    <li> I only use sulfate free products for my facial and body cleaners. This cleanser fits that bill as well as cleaning effectively. A good purchase.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin but this made my skin burn and break out in a rash all over my face for a half hour.  I normally use the regular neutrogena face wash but its been out of stock at my local target &amp; walmart the last couple of times I went by so I decided to use this in the meantime.  It stung a little the first few times I used it but by the 5th time I had to throw it away because it looked like I had been badly sunburned. Eventually the little blisters went away without leaving marks. I found the regular neutrogena at double the price at a local pharmacy but it I gladly paid it since it has never harmed my skin.</li>
    <li> False advertising for dual pack I repeat false advertisement customize the order without integrity woe beware it&#x27;s not too much trouble</li>
    <li> I have to say that this is the best product I have put on my face. Every other item makes me instantly red. I was shocked when I tried this and had no reaction. I have been getting laser treatements for a while to get rid of the rosacea and red veins in my cheeks. The treatments have worked but still every time I wash my face I go bright red. This didn&#x27;t do that, the only product that I have ever used that gives me zero reaction. I have spent a fortune on other products and all along this has been in drugstore. I have ultra sensitive skin and bam not even a minor reaction. I saw another review on here from a rosacea patient and she said it didn&#x27;t work well with her skin. Quite frankly i&#x27;m beyond shocked since five minutes of sun turns me in to a red mess. If you have extremely dry sensitive skin and rosacea give this is a try! I&#x27;m just amazed</li>
    <li> OMG!!! I always had a problem with break outs but this is by far the worst break out I had, had. I used this product hoping it would work better than any of my other products. To my dismay, I was so very very wrong. It first started with my forehead. I didn&#x27;t get little tiny whiteheads, I got huge cyst like looking things on my head. They hurt so bad. It looked like horns were trying to grow out of my head. Then my cheeks started to break out, then around my mouth. OMG this product should be discarded right away. It&#x27;s horrible and I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this for anyone. If your thinking about trying something more \\&quot;natural\\&quot; go to a dermatologist and have them refer you to a product that is suitable for your skin. Neutrogena defiantly does not have a \\&quot;natural\\&quot; product. Benzoyl peroxide and salicyic acid worked way better for my face than this bullsh*t! Don&#x27;t buy this! I promise you, you will regret it!</li>
    <li> I love this facial wash.&lt;br /&gt;It keeps my skin feeling clean &amp; purified!  I do think my complexion has improved with continuous use.&lt;br /&gt;I have acne-prone, oily skin, and I&#x27;ve finally gotten a hold of my breakouts.  I still get 2-3 bumps/pimples/zits (what have you) here and there, but nothing like before!&lt;br /&gt;(I&#x27;ve also improved my diet, so that&#x27;s a big factor)&lt;br /&gt;Anyway!  The only con I&#x27;d say is that the bottle runs out too quickly.  Maybe I just use too much.  I&#x27;m on my 3rd bottle now.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m happy to have found this, and I&#x27;ll continue to use!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--Greatly recommended!</li>
    <li> Neutrogena products have always been great for sensitive skin and this is no exception.  My face feels clean and not dried out.&lt;br /&gt;Great product.  I recommend for all skin types.</li>
    <li> Have been trying for years to make my combination skin cooperate. Despite buying a new brand of face wash nearly every bottle for the past 8 years (since I decided St Ives wasn&#x27;t working as well as it once did), I&#x27;ve found nothing that works for acne/dry/oily skin. Until now. The face wash is a little drying, but I use the matching moisturizer, and I am no longer doomed to a teenager&#x27;s complexion! My pores even looks smaller. I&#x27;ve been wanting a more chemical free natural product for years, but they never work for me. I hate wearing makeup, and have even skipped foundation a couple of times I&#x27;ve had to wear it. No more allergic acne breakouts, no more itchy dry skin, no more oily film. Better pores, smoother skin. If only they had an SPF moisturizer!</li>
    <li> I bought this on a whim while losing my stand by wash on vacation. I have used it for about a week and will be discontinuing use. I noticed that I have developed a stinging, itchy, red rash after using the product. I have not changed any other products in my routine. Wish I would have read the reviews first!</li>
    <li> I was excited about purchasing this product, for I was hoping that I found a cleanser that would effectively clean my skin with no hassle. Much to my dismay, this was not the product for me. After a few weeks of using it, I noticed I had several pimples on my forehead and on my cheeks. My skin became more oily. I am very upset, because my acne has never been this bad. If you have acne prone skin, beware- this product will make your skin oily and cause you to break out.</li>
    <li> Purchased elsewhere and came here seeking reviews.  Been using it whilst waiting on my regular cleanser to arrive.  Big mistake.&lt;br /&gt;Completely dried out my skin, turned it red &amp; blotchy and a few days later I got some itchy hive-like bumps.  I&#x27;m gonna have to get a facial to remove the dead skin this stuff left behind.  At least I now know I&#x27;m allergic to willow bark.&lt;br /&gt;I do have very sensitive skin but have not reacted to other Neutrogena Naturals this way.</li>
    <li> This has a really strong fragrance which tends to linger.  It dries me out more than the Neutrogena Ultra Gentle Cleanser, which I prefer.  I won&#x27;t repurchase this.</li>
    <li> I still have all the products siting in my bathroom worst 20 dollars I have ever spent it burns ur face try the Clinique acne kit</li>
    <li> After reading the negative reviews of this product I was nearly scared away from buying it. In the end, $7 was an amount I was willing to spend to give it a shot. I&#x27;m glad I did. The cleanser works great for me. I don&#x27;t wear a lot of makeup (foundation and mascara mainly) and it removes the makeup without a lot of scrubbing, and leaves my face feeling clean but not overly tight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using the cleanser for about three months now. Some users noticed an uptake in acne when they started using it, but I did not experience this. In fact, this product paired with [[ASIN:B004NA3FJ6 Origins Brighter By Nature(tm) High-Potency Brightening Peel with Fruit Acids 40 Pads]] has kept my modest breakouts in check. The cleanser is not overly drying and has a unique but not unpleasant smell. (The taste is horrible so work hard to not get any in your mouth. Blech.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: For those who prefer a product with a lot of lather, this will not satisfy your need for cleansing bubbles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been very happy with this product and the way it works on my skin. And I am very happy that I found a cleanser for less than $10. I used to hit Sephora a couple times a year and spend a great deal more on products I usually ended up feeling less than enthused about.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for over a year and have been very pleased with it.  I have very dry skin on my face and this doesn&#x27;t dry it out too much like other facial cleansers I&#x27;ve used.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a new facial cleanser with natural ingredients and I was pleased to find neutrogena had this one! However, like many of the other reviewers, I also have now developed a horrible, itchy, red rash all over my face. It&#x27;s terrible and uncomfortable!! It also made my skin so dry it is flaky! I do have sensitive skin, but that was the whole reason I was looking for something without harsh chemicals....</li>
    <li> This cleanser is one of the best I&#x27;ve ever used, which includes my decade-plus of acne issues. Great price point, helps clear my skin, washes away makeup. No complaints.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m shocked to read some reviews.  Everything I&#x27;ve tried in the past has only hurt, striped, or irritated my skin.  FINALLY, I found a great cleanser and I&#x27;m amazed that others had bad reactions.  This product by far is the best for ME.  I thought cleaning my face meant dryness, tightness, and irritation - for years, for decades!  When I saw this more &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; approach, I was skeptical.  I thought it wouldn&#x27;t clean.  This stuff is GREAT!  It cleans and leaves my face feeling great.  I don&#x27;t have an immediate feeling to smear on moisturizer after cleansing.  I use Aveeno ultra calming SPF 15 daily moisturizer.  I do have sensitive, dry skin, and I found this combination of cleansing and moisturizing to be the BEST!</li>
    <li> Unfortunately this product did not work out for me. After using the product for several days, I noticed the facewash would turn my face bright red and it would feel hot to the touch. Perhaps my skin is more sensitive than I realized however I don&#x27;t usually have a problem with this. If you are prone to sensitive skin, even in the slightest, I would not consider this product!</li>
    <li> Smells great and removes makeup but it is so irritating to my skin, I don&#x27;t know why. I bought this thinking that &#x27;natural&#x27; would mean &#x27;gentle&#x27; but I guess not. My skin turns bright red and blotchy after washing my face with it (using just my fingers, not a clarasonic or anything like that). I never broke out from it but the irritation wasn&#x27;t doing me any favors.</li>
    <li> I love Neutrogena products.  I&#x27;ve been a longtime user of the Neutrogena Men&#x27;s line.  That line however, is unfortunately riddled with parabens and as a result, I&#x27;ve recently transitioned to using there Naturals product line.  I REALLY wanted to like this product.  The ingredients really are what drew me in.  I loved that it was naturally-derived and paraben free.  But after using it consistently for over a week now, I can tell you my once normal, never dry skin has totally gone into shock.  I&#x27;ve seen many other reviewers complaining of the same results.  The Willowbark extract in this product (which is there alternative to SA) is incredibly harsh.  I mean, I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin at all and this stuff just irritated it beyond belief.  It immediately burns after using it.  Like really bad ... and my skin is accustomed to industrial strength acids, so this willowbark stuff is not for the faint of heart.  Bottom line, the product didn&#x27;t work for me and I want to make sure that others considering this product know what they&#x27;re \\&quot;potentially\\&quot; in for.  I disregarded all the reviews before buying this product believing those individuals to having just overly-sensitive skin, when in fact, this product is fundamentally flawed in it&#x27;s ingredients (in my opinion).  Also, it smells horrible.  The fake, fruity smell fragrance added to this product is just frankly insulting.</li>
    <li> This is what I use to wash my face and it is gentle on my skin which I love.  It doesn&#x27;t overly dry my skin and is free of a lot of the harsh chemicals I want to avoid, a fact I love.</li>
    <li> I love this company I have particularly sensitive skin and this product actually cleans my face without irritation the natural ingredients make the product even better to me so I don&#x27;t have to worry about harsh chemicals</li>
    <li> It was featured on tv..I like getting my skin really clean and it seems to do the job.  Smells good too.</li>
