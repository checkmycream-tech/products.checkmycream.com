      <li>and this wasn&#x27;t at all fit for 3/32&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>felt cheap and light.</li>
      <li>Great carbide bit - go gently as you grind, especially if you haven&#x27;t used carbide bits before --- they are &amp;#34;mighty&amp;#34; efficient and effective.</li>
      <li>This is one powerful bit!</li>
      <li>Many companies advertise their bits as \\&quot;coarse\\&quot; but this company really means it!</li>

      <li>Just don&#x27;t use it on natural nails only on acrylic and gel</li>
      <li>It is definitely a sharp and very aggressive tool.</li>

    <li> This is one powerful bit! Really need to use caution when using this I cut myself a few times with it but it cuts down the job if you have a lot of filing to do.</li>
    <li> Nice size &amp; sharp. Much better than the cheap ones (this one actually works)</li>
    <li> I ordered this item before I never received it. So I ordered again. I was able to use it in my electric nail file I have and it&#x27;s very effective.  It grinds faster than the sand paper bit. Lovee!</li>
    <li> this one does not even stay in the drill at all. the shaft on these two bits must be slightly slimmer than they should be??</li>
    <li> This product is very nice and arrived just as it should have and was well worth the price I paid and would order again!</li>
    <li> I have used,, and used, and used this. It and it is still just as &amp;#34;sharp&amp;#34;as the day I got it. I am extremely please sinnce I was leary with such an inexpensive price</li>
    <li> Excellent carbide file. I would suggest this item to all.</li>
    <li> I recommend it. Make my life easier. Now I can do my nails in only 25 minutes. For beginners like me it only takes 5 minutes to learn how to use it. Just don&#x27;t use it on natural nails only on acrylic and gel</li>
    <li> this little bit works like a charm.</li>
    <li> I bought this bit to use on my acrylic nails. It is definitely a sharp and very aggressive tool. If you are a beginner, this is not the bit to use. Many companies advertise their bits as \\&quot;coarse\\&quot; but this company really means it!</li>
    <li> I am learning to do my own nails, helps me get a more professional look, when I use it. Yes</li>
    <li> I got this drill bit because of the price but when I tried to use it the bit didn&#x27;t fit into the drill at all. This isn&#x27;t my first time buying a bit so I know bout drill sizing and this wasn&#x27;t at all fit for 3/32&amp;#34;..... All around a very unpleasant experience will not purchase from this seller ever again</li>
    <li> Large barrel, indeed! Better for feet than hands, perhaps? Great carbide bit - go gently as you grind, especially if you haven&#x27;t used carbide bits before --- they are &amp;#34;mighty&amp;#34; efficient and effective. Start with slower speed on your grinder if necessary, too. Both suggestions helped me a lot!</li>
    <li> felt cheap and light. Dont recommend this bit</li>
    <li> works great defiantly a big difference between using a sanding bit. This works fast and I can be cleaned</li>
