      <li>I have fine, wavey hair that curls much more in the summer humid months.  </li>
      <li>Great for naturally wavy/curly hair.  </li>
      <li>I used to use Paul Mitchell super sculpt which is much better....</li>
      <li>The \\&quot;Flex\\&quot; in the name is actually true in this case.</li>
      <li>Excellent product I expected and arrived 2 days early.</li>
      <li>it holds the curls and the hair is soft to the touch which to me was very important.</li>
      <li>It has a consistency closer to water but has incredible hold without giving me hard, crusty curls like those goopier gels.</li>

      <li>Thanks!</li>
      <li>I love this product for my curly hair, but the two bottles from this order seemed much more watery and did not seem to be work as well to control my curls and frizz as it usually does.  </li>
      <li>Paul Mitchell products are very good, even when you buy them at the major Department store, the big red Bulls eye.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for more than a decade on my long curly locks.</li>
      <li>It does a wonderful job of providing soft, shiny curls without leaving my hair feeling heavy, dry, greasy, or sticky.</li>
      <li>thanks.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Through years of use, I know the consistency very well</li>
      <li>I like this product because it really helps my curl hold.</li>
      <li>price was reasonable.</li>
      <li>Be sure to place what you need in the palm of your hand, not any higher because it will completely slip through your fingers and make a mess.</li>
      <li>I am actually running low and need to order more.</li>
      <li>This product I found many years by trial and error, my hair is naturally curly other products leave curls</li>
      <li>Couldn&#x27;t live without it.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t make your hair too stiff but gives enough control to get a nice style when blow drying.</li>
      <li>smells better and is slightly thicker so you can actually get it on your hands without wasting a bunch.</li>
      <li>I was surprised when I poured some onto my palm</li>
      <li>I rated it down a star because the price is too high.</li>

    <li> Excellent Seller&lt;br /&gt;Much thanks.</li>
    <li> product smells bad and has the consistency of water.  I used to use Paul Mitchell super sculpt which is much better.... smells better and is slightly thicker so you can actually get it on your hands without wasting a bunch.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for years for my curls; love it and can&#x27;t be without. I have bought at Beauty shops and online at Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;With this July 23rd delivery, the product came somewhat diluted. I was surprised when I poured some onto my palm and it was almost like water.&lt;br /&gt;The liquid felt like it does, when I dilute it myself, to get the last drops out.&lt;br /&gt;Through years of use, I know the consistency very well and it&#x27;s thicker than what I received.&lt;br /&gt;This was sold by Amazon, so don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s up with this, but I felt robbed. The stuff&#x27;s not cheap.</li>
    <li> I have naturally curly, thick and coarse hair. This product works well with style and frizz control, especially on days I don&#x27;t shampoo. No residue or crunch. The \\&quot;Flex\\&quot; in the name is actually true in this case. I rated it down a star because the price is too high.</li>
    <li> Great Product ! Will be purchasing another.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for more than a decade on my long curly locks. It has a consistency closer to water but has incredible hold without giving me hard, crusty curls like those goopier gels.</li>
    <li> Excellent product I expected and arrived 2 days early. Great experence.</li>
    <li> This product I found many years by trial and error, my hair is naturally curly other products leave curls but the hair is hard, this product if you let the hair dry naturally no blow drier it holds the curls and the hair is soft to the touch which to me was very important. I am actually running low and need to order more. I love you Paul Mitchell your products are magnificent!</li>
    <li> I have only one bottle left.  Will have to order more soon.  Thanks!</li>
    <li> Great for naturally wavy/curly hair.  It is a pourable liquid and doesn&#x27;t leave your hair sticjy.  This product has been around forever.</li>
    <li> I love this product for my curly hair, but the two bottles from this order seemed much more watery and did not seem to be work as well to control my curls and frizz as it usually does.  I&#x27;d bet this was watered down.</li>
    <li> I bought this product along with the volume product and they both work well separately and together.  I purchased these products several months ago and still have product left.</li>
    <li> This is my go-to product to apply before drying.  Lets the shine come through.  Doesn&#x27;t weigh down hair or have any &amp;#34;feel&amp;#34; to it.  My forever product for styling prep.</li>
    <li> This lotion isn&#x27;t too heavy and still does the job. It doesn&#x27;t make your hair too stiff but gives enough control to get a nice style when blow drying.</li>
    <li> Delighted to have found this product again without having to go to a salon to purchase it.  Great, flexible styling product that holds your style without any sticky residue.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great for curly hair. I use to use hair gel to lock my curls in place, but this product is made from a liquid substance that looks and feels like water. I put it on when my hair is still wet in the shower, use my fingers to work it from my scalp to my hair ends, and let it either air dry or use a heat cap. That&#x27;s my method. I have been using this stuff since my hairdresser introduced it to me. It&#x27;s been the best product I&#x27;ve used so far (in decades) - and the best part is doesn&#x27;t leave your hair feeling crunchy. It&#x27;s definitely worth a try. Good luck.</li>
    <li> ordered as gift for my son who loves it and has been using it for years</li>
    <li> Love this stuff.  price was reasonable. saved me time running around the different stores looking for it!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love what it does for my hair, but it is runny!! Be sure to place what you need in the palm of your hand, not any higher because it will completely slip through your fingers and make a mess. Using a small amount at a time is recommended until you reach your desired amount.</li>
    <li> Works great, gives my hair a lot of body.</li>
    <li> I like it but, it does get hard.  Your hair doesn&#x27;t look hard but, it feels hard.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years and just love it.  I&#x27;m having trouble finding it locally so I bought it online.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a wonderful styling tool and I don&#x27;t know what I would do without it.</li>
    <li> Not what I was looking for...</li>
    <li> I like this product because it really helps my curl hold. However it leaves your hair a little crunchy so not sure how to avoid that.</li>
    <li> Couldn&#x27;t live without it. Curly-haired girls need humidity control!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for many years now.  I have fine, wavey hair that curls much more in the summer humid months.  I put this on damp and/or dry hair and scrunch in the curls.  It does a wonderful job of providing soft, shiny curls without leaving my hair feeling heavy, dry, greasy, or sticky. I cannot see myself going without this using this product.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for over 20 years and LOVE it!  BUT This sellers Product is watered down- -I have just opened the bottle of sculpting lotion and the product is extremely watery. I have never had an issue with Paul Mitchell sculpting lotion being watery, I&#x27;ve use this product for over 20 years. Unfortunately it was past 30 days from the original purchase even thought I just opened it the seller refused to refund. DON&#x27;T BUY~~ Unless you want watered down product. This is an unfortunate instance. Paul Mitchell products are very good, even when you buy them at the major Department store, the big red Bulls eye. A few other reviewers are saying the same thing about this product from this seller.</li>
    <li> Wife says it works great.  Has been buying this stuff for as long as it has been on the market.</li>
