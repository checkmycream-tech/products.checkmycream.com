      <li>Great product...</li>
      <li>Smells amazing!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve always loved the Moroccanoil hair products, so i decided to give this a try.</li>
      <li>This is an incredible cream, I love it.  </li>
      <li>This smells so wonderful and you will feel special when you put in on.  </li>
      <li>LOVE this product!</li>
      <li>Love it!</li>
      <li>I absolutely love it!  </li>
      <li>Smells beyond amazing.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a woman who loves really nice fragrances.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Despite the lotion texture, it is a nice product for hands, arms and legs.  </li>
      <li>Absolutely the best lotion out on the market.</li>
      <li>smells so great and is so rich and moisturizing.</li>
      <li>It is a bit pricey but worth it!!!  </li>
      <li>Feels great, has a wonderful scent and has done wonders for my dry skin.</li>
      <li>Very light on the skin (a must in arid climates), smells unusual and delicious.</li>
      <li>It has a beautiful fragrance, not too strong or perfumy, just rich and warm.  </li>
      <li>Love what it does for my skin and the fragrance is really nice like the shampoo and conditioners.  </li>
      <li>love love love!</li>
      <li>Nice and light</li>
      <li>The texture is more like suntan lotion instead of body soufle</li>
      <li>I am so glad I splurged and bought it.  </li>
      <li>However; since it seems so many people out there claim that they prefer unscented versions of so many products, I&#x27;m guessing that this product was manufactured with a lighter fragrance to appeal to a wider number of consumers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Love the smell and feel of this product.</li>
      <li>I really love MoroccanOil products and couldn&#x27;t wait to try out this one.</li>
      <li>I love the scent and the feel.  </li>
      <li>It got on the things under it, but I was able to retrieve most of what escaped.  </li>
      <li>Love this scent.  </li>
      <li>Love this product.</li>
      <li>I do love this stuff.</li>
      <li>I had just hoped to be able to carry the Moroccan Oil smell around with me all day and that did not happen.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I LOVE this product, but it almost seems to evaporate in the jar.  </li>
      <li>FF is more of a &amp;#34;butter&amp;#34; and the MO is more of a &amp;#</li>
      <li>Love how it is not greasy at all and soaks in immediately.</li>
      <li>I love the Moroccanoil scent and most of their products.  </li>
      <li>I was very excited to buy this.</li>
      <li>If you need higher moisturization, though, for parts of your body (like your feet before putting on socks), use a really good CREAM.</li>
      <li>This body soufflé is super moisturizing and smells absolutely amazing.  </li>
      <li>I also love the light scent.  </li>
      <li>Great seller; love the product; quick ship; highly recommend product &amp; seller.</li>
      <li>What a special treat!  </li>
      <li>Hot- love this stuff!</li>
      <li>For example, do not put the jar on your bed (since it is an unstable surface and the jar can easily tip over) as you are putting the product on your body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>i would recommend if you don&#x27;t mind the price or the strong smell.</li>
      <li>I love Moroccanoil hair products, so I was excited to discover the same great smell in body products.  </li>
      <li>It is light and creamy with a very light fragrance and absorbs into the hands and body quickly with no sticky residue.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s fine everywhere else though; I use it on my arms.</li>
      <li>Light frangrance but</li>
      <li>, if you do not like the smell of the original Moroccan oil then do not buy this.</li>
      <li>but you&#x27;re worth it!</li>
      <li>I prefer a clean smell</li>
      <li>Smells great and soothes my dry skin.</li>
      <li>Frankly, the container is lovely - I think that contributes to the high price!</li>
      <li>does go away fairly fast!!</li>
      <li>Very runny when I opened it!!</li>
      <li>but well worth it.  </li>
      <li>This cream is totally worth the price.  </li>
      <li>i have no problem spending a sizable amount on products if i feel they are worth it.</li>
      <li>Had I purchased a fresh product, directly from the manufacturer, I would have had better luck.</li>
      <li>A bit pricey but worth it for this reason alone.</li>
      <li>I like this souffle as it does make my skin feel soft and the scent is wonderful,  although the scent does not last long on my skin.</li>
      <li>It shipped very fast, received it within a couple of days.  </li>
      <li>Fragrance is very, very light and does not last.  </li>
      <li>i bought my first jar of the soufflé two months ago.</li>
      <li>This particular whipped oil absorbs quickly, leaving my skin feeling like silk.</li>
      <li>I love all the Moroccan Oil products... and use them head-to-toe, from shampoo and conditioner to various body oils.</li>
      <li>I first used this product on a trip to Las Vegas.</li>
      <li>delicate smell, great texture</li>
      <li>Normally I don&#x27;t like applying lotions or creams during the day...particularly on hot summer days!  </li>
      <li>It makes my skin feel so soft with a lasting soft smell that i really love!</li>
      <li>Very dissapointed for the price.  </li>
      <li>This absorbs very well, too.  </li>
      <li>It smelled divine and moisturized really well.</li>
      <li>When I opened this jar (having kept it upright since I purchased it), a few teaspoons or so spilled out on its own.  </li>
      <li>And it is definitely pricey, but SO worth it if you can swing for the indulgence!  </li>
      <li>the FF is much denser and the MO is much lighter - both live up to their names.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend pre de provence body butter</li>
      <li>I was a little leery of using it back home in the humidity, but it is just as wonderful, not too heavy at all.  </li>
      <li>So I thought mine was old and asked for a replacement from DBA Fragrance who was very accomodating.  </li>
      <li>This lotion is not heavy or greasy, but it seems more nourishing and enriching than average hand or body lotions.</li>
      <li>When used with the body buff, you will feel like you grew a whole new soft skin.</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t buy this if you have very sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>It did eventually soften up some, but I was not opposed to the texture as I was searching for a rich, creamy moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;The two start rating is due to the smell.</li>
      <li>I tend to have sensitive skin, but have not seen any reaction to this product!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a french found in all the french pharmacies but is super</li>
      <li>it has the same smell (which i like but not everyday) and it&#x27;s very strong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Keeps skin moisturized and soft all day.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Good moisturizer!! Personally I don&#x27;t care for the smell. I prefer a clean smell</li>
    <li> Expensive but worth the price.</li>
    <li> This is an incredible cream, I love it.  It is expensive but definitely worth it.</li>
    <li> Hot- love this stuff!</li>
    <li> I like this souffle as it does make my skin feel soft and the scent is wonderful,  although the scent does not last long on my skin. Not sure if I will purchase again because I want the scent to linger longer</li>
    <li> Expensive but well worth it.  When used with the body buff, you will feel like you grew a whole new soft skin.</li>
    <li> This cream is totally worth the price.  Put this on and your skin is immediately hydrated - just like the oil does for your hair. And it lasts.  I would recommend this product as I would with the entire Moroccan line.</li>
    <li> Great seller; love the product; quick ship; highly recommend product &amp; seller. Five Stars!!!!! A+++++!</li>
    <li> I LOVE this product, but it almost seems to evaporate in the jar.  I will buy it, but I think there must be something in the chemistry that makes it evaporate.  But, it is divine!</li>
    <li> Will continue to use this product. Feels great, has a wonderful scent and has done wonders for my dry skin.</li>
    <li> Smells delicious, just like the hair oil does. Love how it is not greasy at all and soaks in immediately.</li>
    <li> I bought this product at my beauty salon.  I love the Moroccanoil scent and most of their products.  When I opened this jar (having kept it upright since I purchased it), a few teaspoons or so spilled out on its own.  It got on the things under it, but I was able to retrieve most of what escaped.  But as I stated in my subject line, I was so surprised to see that the texture is not a light whipped product as you would think a souffle texture would be.  It is a LOTION, not a cream.  It is not viscious enough to be labeled a body souffle.  This is a lotion that should be in a bottle.  I am now having to be extra careful in opening and just using the product since the product is so runny to be packaged in a jar.  For example, do not put the jar on your bed (since it is an unstable surface and the jar can easily tip over) as you are putting the product on your body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product does have that wonderful Moroccanoil scent, although I wish that it was stronger.  I&#x27;m a woman who loves really nice fragrances.  However; since it seems so many people out there claim that they prefer unscented versions of so many products, I&#x27;m guessing that this product was manufactured with a lighter fragrance to appeal to a wider number of consumers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite the lotion texture, it is a nice product for hands, arms and legs.  Your skin will be like a baby&#x27;s.  This absorbs very well, too.  If you need higher moisturization, though, for parts of your body (like your feet before putting on socks), use a really good CREAM.</li>
    <li> I like the quality of this body cream.  But it&#x27;s too expensive for body cream.  It last less than a month which I put on my leg and arm.  It you can afford than you should try it.</li>
    <li> Fragrance is very, very light and does not last.  After applying, it has a &amp;#34;plasticy bottle&amp;#34; smell....similar to a lotion you forgot about and used a long time after purchasing - so there is no real scent left.  It is difficult to explain.  So I thought mine was old and asked for a replacement from DBA Fragrance who was very accomodating.  However, the second container smelled exactly the same.  Very dissapointed for the price.  Frankly, the container is lovely - I think that contributes to the high price!</li>
    <li> Its a wonderful product. Not greasy but it melts into the skin. Smells beyond amazing.</li>
    <li> What a special treat!  LOVE this product!</li>
    <li> Absolutely the best lotion out on the market. One container will last me a month. Extremely moisturizing, I put it on after I get showered in the morning. By the next morning my skin still feel soft. I don&#x27;t need to constantly reapply lotion to my body. It&#x27;s not overly fragrant and has a soft subtle scent.</li>
    <li> Smells amazing! I&#x27;ve always loved the Moroccanoil hair products, so i decided to give this a try. It makes my skin feel so soft with a lasting soft smell that i really love! I tend to have sensitive skin, but have not seen any reaction to this product! I think i have finally found a lotion that i will be sticking with!</li>
    <li> My wife loves this cream and I score big points every few months with it&#x27;s purchase.  A bit pricey but worth it for this reason alone.</li>
    <li> Great product...Great merchant...Very happy</li>
    <li> I do love this stuff. Very light on the skin (a must in arid climates), smells unusual and delicious. It&#x27;s getting hard to find since the company seems to be switching to hair care vs. body care. It is over-priced but I continue to use it.</li>
    <li> I love the scent and the feel.  Given it as gifts to several people.</li>
    <li> greasy feeling lotion</li>
    <li> This smells so wonderful and you will feel special when you put in on.  Light frangrance but richand creamy.  Yummy!</li>
    <li> I really love MoroccanOil products and couldn&#x27;t wait to try out this one. It smelled divine and moisturized really well. Much to my dismay, a few minutes later, it broke my legs out in itchy, red bumps. It&#x27;s fine everywhere else though; I use it on my arms. Don&#x27;t buy this if you have very sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> i do like this product over all but it&#x27;s quite pricey. i have no problem spending a sizable amount on products if i feel they are worth it. i bought my first jar of the soufflé two months ago. i use it in rotation with 2 to 3 other body lotions and body butters so if i was to use it daily i think i would be buying it every 2 - 3 weeks. where as one jar of my Frederic Fekkai body butter (which it looks like they have discontinued :( was about the same price (if memory serves) and lasts about 3-5 months! quite a difference. however they are much different textures. the FF is much denser and the MO is much lighter - both live up to their names. FF is more of a &amp;#34;butter&amp;#34; and the MO is more of a &amp;#34;soufflé.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;also, if you do not like the smell of the original Moroccan oil then do not buy this. it has the same smell (which i like but not everyday) and it&#x27;s very strong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;so i would recommend if you don&#x27;t mind the price or the strong smell. as far as a body lotion it does the trick on my dry skin!</li>
    <li> I am becoming increasingly obsessed with argan oil products, and the Moroccan Oil Body Soufflé has only reinforced my obsession!  This particular whipped oil absorbs quickly, leaving my skin feeling like silk. Normally I don&#x27;t like applying lotions or creams during the day...particularly on hot summer days!  But with this product, I don&#x27;t feel like a sweaty grease ball after application. It has a relatively heavy and sweet scent but not offensive. And it is definitely pricey, but SO worth it if you can swing for the indulgence!  Can&#x27;t wait to try the body scrub!</li>
    <li> Awesome! Nice and light</li>
    <li> Love the smell and feel of this product. Pricey but worth it, treat yourself, you won&#x27;t be disappointed .. :)</li>
    <li> love love love! smells so great and is so rich and moisturizing.</li>
    <li> Smells just like the hair product! A little goes a long way, don&#x27;t glob a lot on, you still get the moisturing effect and the great smell by just a small amount.</li>
    <li> This is moisturizing and smells like the moroccan oil shampoo and oil. I wish the smell lasted longer.... I would buy again.</li>
    <li> Not worth the money !! Product smells like morrocan oil but scent does go away fairly fast!! Very runny when I opened it!! The texture is more like suntan lotion instead of body soufle it moisturizes yes but nothing out of the ordinary !! The price is way excessive and a waste. !! I highly recommend pre de provence body butter 15 dollars it&#x27;s smells divine and mosturizes to the maximum!!  Can be found everywhere even walgreens !! It&#x27;s a french found in all the french pharmacies but is super</li>
    <li> Purchased the Moroccan Oil Body Souffle.  It shipped very fast, received it within a couple of days.  Love what it does for my skin and the fragrance is really nice like the shampoo and conditioners.  My biggest problem with this product is the scent does not last long on the skin.</li>
    <li> I like the smell and consistency of the product..however, after I used the product..I found the expiration date on the bottom of the jar and the product had expired April of 2014.  I bought the product in Dec. 2014.</li>
    <li> I am very disappointed in this. I am OBSESSED with smell of the shampoo and conditioner and when I read that this had the “signature smell” I was very excited to buy this. Mine arrived and was almost frozen solid. It WAS December, so no big deal. It was the texture of a cold stick of butter and went on in the same way. It did eventually soften up some, but I was not opposed to the texture as I was searching for a rich, creamy moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;The two start rating is due to the smell. I could BARELY smell the Moroccan Oil fragrance and what I COULD smell smelled like old oil. The product in general smelled like it had been sitting so long that the fragrance had just worn out and what was left was the oil base it was made with. The moisturizing quality is wonderful and it does not leave you feeling greasy. I had just hoped to be able to carry the Moroccan Oil smell around with me all day and that did not happen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Based on the other reviews I am reading, I think I just got a bad jar. Had I purchased a fresh product, directly from the manufacturer, I would have had better luck. I do not think the product itself is bad. Lesson learned.</li>
    <li> I love Moroccanoil hair products, so I was excited to discover the same great smell in body products.  This body soufflé is super moisturizing and smells absolutely amazing.  You only need a little bit to make your skin soft and silky.</li>
    <li> I love all the Moroccan Oil products... and use them head-to-toe, from shampoo and conditioner to various body oils. This lotion is not heavy or greasy, but it seems more nourishing and enriching than average hand or body lotions. It&#x27;s thick and creamy but melts into the skin quickly without leaving a residue. And the aroma is intoxicating, as always!</li>
    <li> This was recommended to me by a cousin.  It is light and creamy with a very light fragrance and absorbs into the hands and body quickly with no sticky residue.</li>
    <li> Love this product. Works great &amp; smells wonderful.</li>
    <li> This is the best lotion I have found. I absolutely love it!  Keeps skin moisturized and soft all day.</li>
    <li> Love this scent.  Always get compliments.</li>

    <li> MoroccanOil Body Souffle is the best body moisturizer I have ever used.  I have extremely sensitive skin and have had no problems with it whatsoever.  I have been using it for about 6 months now.  It makes you skin like silk and continued use keeps your skin beautiful.  I also love the light scent.  It is a bit pricey but worth it!!!  Best product ever.</li>
    <li> delicate smell, great texture</li>
    <li> Really great texture and moisture.  A little pricey for everyday use but you&#x27;re worth it!</li>
    <li> I first used this product on a trip to Las Vegas. I am from a humid climate and my regular body lotion just wouldn&#x27;t cut it in the desert.  I bought some at the resort, it was a bit pricey but I was desperate!  I am so glad I splurged and bought it.  It seemed to moisturize my skin even after being at the pool all day.  I was a little leery of using it back home in the humidity, but it is just as wonderful, not too heavy at all.  It has a beautiful fragrance, not too strong or perfumy, just rich and warm.  Love it!</li>
