      <li>Okay, first off let me start out saying that this is the best product.</li>

      <li>I would recommend :)</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad I did.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d suggest lightly dabbing your finger in it, rub it on your palms, and then run your fingers through your hair--</li>
      <li>The Dark and Lovely relaxer that I applied first was the best I had ever used before!</li>
      <li>It is a light creme with almost no scent.</li>
      <li>great for dry, unmanageable hair.</li>
      <li>nice soft shine.</li>
      <li>Since that&#x27;s not the case, I have to pass on future purchases and can&#x27;t in good faith recommend it to others.</li>
      <li>Not bad for the price.</li>
      <li>decided to try a dark and lovely perm, loved it.</li>
      <li>Ok, so this product pretty much lives up to how it&#x27;s described</li>
      <li>This is worth the price to get a softness to the hair after shampooing.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s an oil based product so those of you who do not like the feeling of oil being in your hair probably won&#x27;t like the texture of the product; however, I&#x27;m telling you that it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
      <li>i rock a short hair style and am loving this hair products .</li>
      <li>I was able to comb my hair and barely any hair was on the comb</li>
      <li>This hair cream has plenty oils to keep your hair soft &amp; healthy looking, but you REALLY have to apply is sparingly.</li>
      <li>I will be a continuing satisfied customer of Dark and Lovely Healthy Gloss 5 Hair Creme, as well as the Dark and Lovely Shampoo and Dark and Lovely conditioner.</li>
      <li>I only was able to get this in the boxed perms but</li>
      <li>I recommend this product to any first time users..</li>
      <li>It really puts a shine on my hair, and moisturizes but doesn&#x27;t frizz it up at all!</li>
      <li>I like this hair creme; it&#x27;s the first time I used it.  </li>
      <li>Works really good with my hair , not To heavy on your hair.</li>
      <li>My hair was soft, even when it looked and felt dry, it was still surprisingly soft.&lt;br</li>
      <li>This hair creme is not easy to find and it works every good for my hair.</li>
      <li>Find what&#x27;s right for you, and dark and lovely was right for me.</li>
      <li>Thanks so much!</li>
      <li>This hair creme is hands down amazing.</li>
      <li>,but for a quick shine its ok on dry hair also., not heavy or greasy....overpriced though.</li>
      <li>keep my hair very silky</li>
      <li>It worked very well for me.</li>
      <li>I really didn&#x27;t like this product.  </li>
      <li>I love this product...best on wet hair.</li>
      <li>My relaxed hair stays moisturized for the whole week</li>
      <li>My hair shedded (had breakage) just as much with it as it does without it.  </li>
      <li>I use it in conjunction with the Dark and Lovely</li>
      <li>(of course I only use it to flat iron, I&#x27;m sure if you used it a lot after it might make your hair feel really greasy).</li>
      <li>I achieved very shiny, very bouncy and soft results.</li>
      <li>highly recommend this product.</li>
      <li>It protects your hair from the high heat and it gives the finished hair a sleek shiney look.</li>
      <li>and I have not applied any other oils or moisturizers since I first styled my  hair on Sunday evening, yet my hair is still shiny, smooth, bouncy, and soft.</li>
      <li>Also, it says its light enough for daily use, but I think using this too often could clog your hair follicles.  </li>
      <li>I wouldn&#x27;t recommend using a flat iron right after application as the product needs time to soak in.</li>
      <li>Also, you hair feels very soft.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s more than difficult to find a product that will not only moisturize African-American hair, but also leaves it feeling soft and strong.</li>
      <li>Hard to find, love to use.</li>
      <li>really compliment my coarse hair texture.</li>
      <li>No breakage, hair feels extremely soft, manageable, and stronger than before.</li>
      <li>this leaves it soft to touch with no freez she loves it</li>
      <li>I also use the Soft Sheen relaxer and shampoo and conditioner.  </li>
      <li>I guess if all I wanted to do is slick my hair back into a ponytail everyday, it would be great for that.  </li>
      <li>I purchased the full size product at Walgreens where it was priced a little over $5.00, but I received $1.50 off with an instant manufacturer&#x27;s coupon.</li>
      <li>This is a very light-weight creme that doesn&#x27;t leave your hair weighed down.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s gentle enough to use everyday but creamy enough to leave your hair soft and not frizzy.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not sure I will use as much the next time I style my hair, but I must say that for my thin and fine hair, it really didn&#x27;t weigh it down</li>

<li> If you have thick, natural curly, frizzy hair</li>

<li> This product is way too heavy for that.  </li>
<li> , I don&#x27;t have to use the products everyday.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> This hair creme is hands down amazing. It&#x27;s more than difficult to find a product that will not only moisturize African-American hair, but also leaves it feeling soft and strong. It&#x27;s wonderful to be able to say that this product does both. It&#x27;s gentle enough to use everyday but creamy enough to leave your hair soft and not frizzy. It&#x27;s an oil based product so those of you who do not like the feeling of oil being in your hair probably won&#x27;t like the texture of the product; however, I&#x27;m telling you that it&#x27;s worth it. If you can stand having an oil based substance in your hair, I say that you should definitely try this creme.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5 stars!</li>
    <li> I really didn&#x27;t like this product.  Typically, I give a product a &#x27;3&#x27; if it doesn&#x27;t do any damage, but I just couldn&#x27;t bring myself to do it this time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First off, let me tell you some of the ingredients.  This product contains petrolatum, alcohol, dimethicone and a couple of parabens (methyl and ethyl).  I honestly don&#x27;t know of any of these ingredients are inherently evil; however, I know on hair care forums they tend to be frowned upon.  This is just an FYI so you&#x27;ll know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let me next say that I expected, probably unreasonably, a LOT from this moisturizer.  It promises to provide five things:  moisture, shine, strength, softness and body.  Unfortunately, it did not deliver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) It didn&#x27;t provide my hair enough moisture.  My hair felt/looked extremely dry just a day after application.  I feel my hair was &amp;#34;coated&amp;#34; after the creme was applied but not moisturized.&lt;br /&gt;2) It did provide shine.  Very good shine.  But again, it only lasted about a day.&lt;br /&gt;3) There was no strength provided.  My hair shedded (had breakage) just as much with it as it does without it.  There was no change.&lt;br /&gt;4) My hair was soft, even when it looked and felt dry, it was still surprisingly soft.&lt;br /&gt;5) My hair had no body.  This product is way too heavy for that.  If anything, it weighed my hair down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Basically this product gave me temporary shine and lasting softness.  I guess if all I wanted to do is slick my hair back into a ponytail everyday, it would be great for that.  Since that&#x27;s not the case, I have to pass on future purchases and can&#x27;t in good faith recommend it to others.</li>
    <li> I only was able to get this in the boxed perms but good ole faithful Amazon had &amp; I&#x27;m so thankful. The beauty supply store didn&#x27;t even have it. I am definitely going to order this again when. The shipping was absolutely awesome as well. I received before the time they specified. Excellent!!</li>
    <li> This product works excellent for me. I recommend this product to any first time users.. I have tried others to see how my hair would take it. It didnt work. I will be a continuing satisfied customer of Dark and Lovely Healthy Gloss 5 Hair Creme, as well as the Dark and Lovely Shampoo and Dark and Lovely conditioner. Cosmetic Solutions is a reliable company for me hands down in all the aspects as a customer dealing with the company.</li>
    <li> I must say this is the best hair moisturizer I have come across that delivers excellent results. My relaxed hair stays moisturized for the whole week, I don&#x27;t have to use the products everyday. No breakage, hair feels extremely soft, manageable, and stronger than before. It&#x27;s an excellent heat-protectant too. Has a great smell. I use it in conjunction with the Dark and Lovely Leave-In Treatment which I use when my hair is wet. That product is also good.</li>
    <li> Great stuff! It really puts a shine on my hair, and moisturizes but doesn&#x27;t frizz it up at all! The Dark and Lovely relaxer that I applied first was the best I had ever used before! They are great together!</li>
    <li> Works really good with my hair , not To heavy on your hair. Holds a very nice sheen with out losing body.</li>
    <li> There is a shine to your hair and will fly away,  What norw can I say?  You will love it or leave it.</li>
    <li> great for dry, unmanageable hair. it keeps hair moisturized.</li>
    <li> This is a very light-weight creme that doesn&#x27;t leave your hair weighed down. I also like the scent. I got a sample of this in a relaxer that I bought and that little sample package was enough to convince me to try it out. I&#x27;m glad I did. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend using a flat iron right after application as the product needs time to soak in. I will be buying this item again.</li>
    <li> I like this creme.  The only problem is that it makes your hair feel heavy and a little bit oily.  It gives you a great shine and makes the hair look healthy.  Also, you hair feels very soft.  Not bad for the price.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m sold on this product line!! I&#x27;ve been using since the summer and it is wonderful! Smells nice as well!</li>
    <li> nice soft shine. use it weekly.</li>
    <li> Okay, first off let me start out saying that this is the best product. I am an African American woman, who has really dry brittle hair. I have tried everything from \\&quot;It&#x27;s a 10\\&quot;, \\&quot;Mane n&#x27; Tale\\&quot;, \\&quot;Dr Miracles\\&quot;, \\&quot;Optimum\\&quot;, and \\&quot;Doo Gro\\&quot;. All of which did nothing for my breakage, actually I think it made it worse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to try a dark and lovely perm, loved it. I purchased the shampoo and leave in conditioner, and boy was I impressed. I was able to comb my hair and barely any hair was on the comb afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product. One thing that works for one person may not necessarily work for the next. Find what&#x27;s right for you, and dark and lovely was right for me. Oh and also it&#x27;s inexpensive for what you get.</li>
    <li> Wife has very long curly hair this leaves it soft to touch with no freez she loves it and i love it</li>
    <li> The item is excellent.  Thanks so much!</li>
    <li> If you have thick, natural curly, frizzy hair this hair creme is the best to use prior to straightening your hair by blow dryer and Straightening Iron. It protects your hair from the high heat and it gives the finished hair a sleek shiney look. A little bit at a time is all you will need.</li>
    <li> This hair creme is not easy to find and it works every good for my hair. it keeps my hair sofe and it last all day</li>
    <li> i rock a short hair style and am loving this hair products . keep my hair very silky</li>
    <li> This product was over priced.i found it at Walmart for a lot cheaper I wish I could sent it back</li>
    <li> I used this product after relaxing my hair this past weekend. I applied it in sections before I curled my hair with a ceramic iron. I achieved very shiny, very bouncy and soft results. It&#x27;s now Thursday evening and I have not applied any other oils or moisturizers since I first styled my  hair on Sunday evening, yet my hair is still shiny, smooth, bouncy, and soft. I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s the relaxer itself and the keratin treatment included with it, or the hair cream, or the ceramic iron, or a combination, but it worked. I purchased the full size product at Walgreens where it was priced a little over $5.00, but I received $1.50 off with an instant manufacturer&#x27;s coupon. I&#x27;m not sure I will use as much the next time I style my hair, but I must say that for my thin and fine hair, it really didn&#x27;t weigh it down and it didn&#x27;t feel greasy. As I said, I sectioned my hair and put a tiny bit on each length of hair before I applied the curling iron. It worked very well for me.</li>
    <li> Ok, so this product pretty much lives up to how it&#x27;s described but I&#x27;d caution you that it&#x27;s not as \\&quot;light\\&quot; of a product as they claim. This hair cream has plenty oils to keep your hair soft &amp; healthy looking, but you REALLY have to apply is sparingly. I&#x27;d suggest lightly dabbing your finger in it, rub it on your palms, and then run your fingers through your hair--that way, you won&#x27;t take away movement from your hair because the strands are stuck together. Also, it says its light enough for daily use, but I think using this too often could clog your hair follicles.  Maybe this should be used every other day or put it on at night, so it has time to absorb and not make your hair look like you dipped it in oil sheen in the morning.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. I use it @ night when wrapping my hair. It leaves my hair soft with added moisture without weighing it down</li>
    <li> This is the only product I have found to nourish my relaxed hair.  I also use the Soft Sheen relaxer and shampoo and conditioner.  It&#x27;s consistency and ingredients really compliment my coarse hair texture.</li>
    <li> This is worth the price to get a softness to the hair after shampooing. It&#x27;s not heavy and you can leave it in rather than rinsing and it won&#x27;t feel heavy on the hair.</li>
    <li> I have relaxed hair, and I just put this in my hair after I blow dry it and before I flat iron it. Makes my hair really soft and not super heavy (of course I only use it to flat iron, I&#x27;m sure if you used it a lot after it might make your hair feel really greasy). I would recommend :) Seals my ends really nicely too.</li>
    <li> Hard to find, love to use.</li>
    <li> Sucked, worked best first time then made my hair feel waxy after each additional use. I will never order this product again😕</li>
    <li> I love this product...best on wet hair.,but for a quick shine its ok on dry hair also., not heavy or greasy....overpriced though.,at Walmart for $4.95</li>
    <li> I like this hair creme; it&#x27;s the first time I used it.  It is a light creme with almost no scent.</li>
