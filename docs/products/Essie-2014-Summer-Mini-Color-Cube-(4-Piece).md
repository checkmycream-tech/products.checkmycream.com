      <li>This product is nice my girlfriend use this prduct</li>
      <li>Cute cute!  </li>
      <li>at first i was not that excited about this collection, but the colors in this cube are great!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s the perfect spring red and the formula is amazing.  </li>
      <li>i love the colors in here.</li>
      <li>I Love the Essie Mini Cubes, I have purchased them many times and simply LOVE them.  </li>
      <li>The formula is nice and smooth.</li>
      <li>Perfect for a non-gender specific party as there were two shades of pinks/reds and two blues/greens.</li>
      <li>(there&#x27;s a plastic part on top</li>
      <li>She is very happy with the red</li>
      <li>I love the colors here.</li>
      <li>It chipped so easily.  </li>
      <li>but the nail polish itself seems more runny than the full size essie nail polish.</li>
      <li>This is great if you want to try out colors, without having to spend a ton on larger bottles of color that you may not like.  </li>
      <li>It went on super easy and lasted 6 days without chipping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Worth every cent!</li>
      <li>My daughter absolutely loved these hot new colors.</li>
      <li>Purchasing the current season&#x27;s colors in miniature form and in 4 of the 6 colors is, to me, a wise choice.</li>
      <li>and she say like the colors and more thanks for all</li>
      <li>I just wish they were the full sized bottles.</li>
      <li>I like Essie polishes, but these were a bit streaky and required several coates before I had good coverage.  </li>
      <li>so it was nice to get kind of a muted green</li>
      <li>Quality of polish was not as expected, and not as good as Essie&#x27;s full size polishes.</li>
      <li>I feel like many of the shades could suit different types of skin easily.</li>
      <li>The color cube is nice because it lets you try four smaller bottles rather than committing to one color.</li>
      <li>Got my shipment quickly, colors were fabulous and was surprised at how well they matched my skin tone.</li>
      <li>colors are so cute and not sheer at all!</li>
      <li>I like it very much.i</li>
      <li>so you are not committed to a whole bottle that just ends up at the bottom of your drawer.</li>
      <li>Got these nail Polish real early!</li>
      <li>formular to thick to apply smoothly... get chipped easily...  </li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t get me wrong, they are still beautiful colors to try.</li>
      <li>Gets a little clumpy towards the bottom of the bottle, but that&#x27;s most polishes that I&#x27;ve seen.</li>
      <li>When I couldn&#x27;t find this new Essie 2014 collection in the stores in my area, I ordered it online.  </li>
      <li>I could get twice as many from other brands in a larger size for this price.  </li>
      <li>This is my first time buying from essie and definitely my last time.</li>
      <li>I only needed 2 coats for the colors to be vibrant.</li>
      <li>For those of us that don&#x27;t pay attention to all the little details these four packs are not four full sized polishes.  </li>
      <li>Now if only Mother Nature will co-operate, Spring will chase away Old Man Winter…</li>
      <li>I usually like essie nail polish but these smaller bottles seem to be a different formula and do not go on as smoothly.</li>

<li> I usually like essie nail polish but these smaller bottles seem to be a different formula and do not go on as smoothly.</li>
<li> These colors are nice, but the light pink color was terrible quality.  </li>
<li> My girlfriend has use the red and the green so far.  </li>
<li> usually I&#x27;m not one for super crazy colors</li>
<li> but all I could see was the date that it was delivered to USPS and one update that it had simply been scanned in at a postal facility but nothing else from USPS about an expected delivery date.  </li>
<li> so it&#x27;s not too messy), screw it back on and then off again.</li>
<li> Received when expected.</li>
<li> You are saving some money but not much.</li>
<li> the packaging was crushed so I had to pull them out before I gave them as a gift.  </li>
<li> will probably order other colours too</li>
<li> Need at least 3 coats to become opague or you can layer over white.</li>
<li> Not worth the price for all 4 colors.  </li>
<li> I like the other three colors!</li>
<li> This mini cube includes 4 spring &#x27;14 polishes - Style Hunter(crimson), Fashion Playground(mint green), Romper Room(pink) and Hide&amp;Go Chic(blue).  </li>
<li> and she said the green goes on thicker than they usually do...  </li>
<li> I am a big fan of the Essie polish line but this blue was just plain ugly with my olive skin tone.  </li>
<li> The colors are in fashion, they are small in size</li>
<li> Some bottles are thick and goopy.  </li>
<li> They were fairly thick and provided meh coverage.  </li>
<li> I was not happy how the seller shipped them</li>
<li> Not impressed in the least.</li>
<li> I don&#x27;t know if it was a bad batch or what, but it sucked.</li>

    <li> the size is so cute! and a great deal for the beloved essie!</li>
    <li> formular to thick to apply smoothly... get chipped easily...  this never happens to my OPI, china glaze nail polishes. This is my first time buying from essie and definitely my last time.</li>
    <li> at first i was not that excited about this collection, but the colors in this cube are great! Received when expected.</li>
    <li> This is great if you want to try out colors, without having to spend a ton on larger bottles of color that you may not like.  These colors are nice, but the light pink color was terrible quality.  It chipped so easily.  If you know the Essie brand, that is NOT one of their trademarks.  I don&#x27;t know if it was a bad batch or what, but it sucked.</li>
    <li> This product is nice my girlfriend use this prduct and she say like the colors and more thanks for all</li>
    <li> This mini cube includes 4 spring &#x27;14 polishes - Style Hunter(crimson), Fashion Playground(mint green), Romper Room(pink) and Hide&amp;Go Chic(blue).  The winner for me is Style Hunter.  It&#x27;s the perfect spring red and the formula is amazing.  It went on super easy and lasted 6 days without chipping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fashion Playground and Romper Room are very sheer.  Need at least 3 coats to become opague or you can layer over white.</li>
    <li> colors are so cute and not sheer at all! they are .16 fl oz. the names are adorable! came moderately quick.&lt;br /&gt;I would definetly buy again</li>
    <li> I like Essie polishes, but these were a bit streaky and required several coates before I had good coverage.  Not the best by Essie in my opinion.  The price was great, though.</li>
    <li> essie is always awesome and this set doesn&#x27;t disappoint. LOVE these colors!!</li>
    <li> Best colors ever! Worth every cent!</li>
    <li> Bought these as baby shower favors.  Cute cute!  Perfect for a non-gender specific party as there were two shades of pinks/reds and two blues/greens. I was so happy when they arrived towards the beginning of the stated delivery range as the shower was scheduled for just the day after they arrived!  I did try to track the package with the number that ASAP Beauty gave me but all I could see was the date that it was delivered to USPS and one update that it had simply been scanned in at a postal facility but nothing else from USPS about an expected delivery date.  I don&#x27;t attribute that complication to ASAP Beauty, however.</li>
    <li> My daughter absolutely loved these hot new colors.</li>
    <li> I am a big fan of the Essie polish line but this blue was just plain ugly with my olive skin tone.  I like the other three colors!</li>
    <li> Got these nail Polish real early! Three days then it came. The best nail Polish in the world.</li>
    <li> I Love the Essie Mini Cubes, I have purchased them many times and simply LOVE them.  The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is that I was not fond of one of the colors.  But the service was great and everything is as described............just a personal preference thing with the color I guess</li>
    <li> Got my shipment quickly, colors were fabulous and was surprised at how well they matched my skin tone. I feel like many of the shades could suit different types of skin easily.</li>
    <li> Only used one color - the Blue!  So many complements on the color!</li>
    <li> i love the colors in here. usually I&#x27;m not one for super crazy colors so it was nice to get kind of a muted green</li>
    <li> Quality of polish was not as expected, and not as good as Essie&#x27;s full size polishes.</li>
    <li> I love these colors! I just wish they were the full sized bottles. The formula is nice and smooth. I only needed 2 coats for the colors to be vibrant.</li>
    <li> This set includes four beautiful, must-have colors at an affordable price. These are staple colors to be added to every gal&#x27;s beauty collection!</li>
    <li> I was not happy how the seller shipped them the packaging was crushed so I had to pull them out before I gave them as a gift.  My girlfriend has use the red and the green so far.  She is very happy with the red and she said the green goes on thicker than they usually do...  For those of us that don&#x27;t pay attention to all the little details these four packs are not four full sized polishes.  You are saving some money but not much.</li>
    <li> Cute colors! Lots of compliments! Gets a little clumpy towards the bottom of the bottle, but that&#x27;s most polishes that I&#x27;ve seen.</li>
    <li> When I couldn&#x27;t find this new Essie 2014 collection in the stores in my area, I ordered it online.  It arrived in perfect condition .  Now if only Mother Nature will co-operate, Spring will chase away Old Man Winter………...</li>
    <li> I love the colors here. I recommend this to anyone wanting to sample the colors out!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Issues: When I opened some of the bottles, the brush detached. I had to pull it out (there&#x27;s a plastic part on top so it&#x27;s not too messy), screw it back on and then off again.</li>
    <li> I really love these colors! The color cube is nice because it lets you try four smaller bottles rather than committing to one color. I would definitely recommend this!</li>
    <li> These are great colors for a great price! However, I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s just the batch I received but the nail polish itself seems more runny than the full size essie nail polish.</li>
    <li> Purchasing the current season&#x27;s colors in miniature form and in 4 of the 6 colors is, to me, a wise choice. The colors are in fashion, they are small in size so you are not committed to a whole bottle that just ends up at the bottom of your drawer. I just wish they would miniaturize all the colors instead of just 4/6.</li>
    <li> Some bottles are thick and goopy.  Will not go on nail nicely.</li>
    <li> Very nice colors. It is a very Good quality. I like it very much.i will probably order other colours too</li>
    <li> I usually like essie nail polish but these smaller bottles seem to be a different formula and do not go on as smoothly.</li>
    <li> Meh.  Not worth the price for all 4 colors.  They were fairly thick and provided meh coverage.  I could get twice as many from other brands in a larger size for this price.  Not impressed in the least.</li>
    <li> So much smaller than they appear. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, they are still beautiful colors to try.</li>
