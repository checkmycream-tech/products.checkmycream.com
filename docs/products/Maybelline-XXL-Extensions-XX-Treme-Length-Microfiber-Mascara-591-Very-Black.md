### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Maybelline makes the best mascara</li>
      <li>I was taken in by the good deal!!  </li>
      <li>I dont even use an eyelash curler and my lashes looked great.</li>
      <li>IT WORKS GREAT</li>
      <li>I was not at all happy with that.</li>
      <li>It wasn&#x27;t as great as I had expexted but it&#x27;ll do.</li>
      <li>but it still works good</li>
      <li>But the good thing about it is that it doesn&#x27;t clump at all.</li>
      <li>recomendo good purchase ....</li>
      <li>I was hoping it would be as good as The Falsies</li>
      <li>Works good</li>
      <li>but this is good and id recommend it.</li>
      <li>ALWAYS LOVED THIS MASCARA</li>
      <li>The seller of this product was awesome also, I even got a free lil gift with my purchase (not saying this is the case in every shipment, but I was super impressed)!</li>
      <li>I love it!</li>
      <li>Will purchase from this seller again for sure!</li>
      <li>I love it!</li>
      <li>, I gives nice definition and length with no flaking.</li>
      <li>And the best part about this mascara is it stays put very well.</li>
      <li>I recommend just going very lightly over your lashes with the brush, and make sure to scrape off the excess on opening to the tube.</li>
      <li>it made my lashes huge!  </li>
      <li>I have about 20 different mascaras from trying to find the perfect one.</li>
      <li>I love this</li>
      <li>ok</li>
      <li>In order to cover up the primer fully, it requires more coats, which makes the lashes clump together.</li>
      <li>Many \\&quot;two step mascaras\\&quot; have the clumping issue, so I should&#x27;ve seen it coming.    </li>
      <li>This mascara does not do anything magical.</li>
      <li>LOVE THIS STUFF</li>
      <li>Not my favorite</li>
      <li>I LOVE THIS.</li>
      <li>The mascara comes off easily</li>
      <li>After reading many mascara \\&quot;top 10 lists\\&quot; with this at, or near the top, I decided to try it.</li>
      <li>The mascara, along with the primer goes on so smooth and clump free.</li>
      <li>This is fantastic.  </li>
      <li>GREAT PRODUCT, EASY TO USE, CONVENIENT, LONG LASHES.</li>
      <li>I think I will stick to colossal lash!</li>
      <li>I bought this from walmart yesterday and I was so excited about it.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s an okay product, it doesn&#x27;t really make a huge difference to me.</li>
      <li>It was my absolute favorite.  </li>
      <li>So I took a look at the bottom of the tube and the color was brown, which pissed me off a bit, but luckily I like the performance of this product.</li>
      <li>but if you like super clumpy with super length, then this might be your thing.</li>
      <li>I have been using Maybelline XXL mascara for about 5 years now and this one is by far my favorite.</li>
      <li>PRICE RIGHT.</li>
      <li>then the #2 side is a &amp;#34;color&amp;#34; you pick that covers the white fibers and adds some more creating the look of fuller and longer lashes.</li>
      <li>This wasnt my first time using the product</li>
      <li>make sure there&#x27;s no white areas showing.</li>
      <li>Therefore just a side note for the sellers double check the product because you might not come across a customer a pleased as me.</li>
      <li>First of all step one makes your eye lashes feel like you have just put glue on them.</li>
      <li>it has a good, small brush.</li>
      <li>lashes\\&quot; look, but in a natural sense, not the super glam look.</li>
      <li>and this mascara really makes them look longer and</li>
      <li>It made lashes appear much fuller</li>
      <li>didn&#x27;t really like that</li>
      <li>however... i really miss the product that came befor this....</li>
      <li>As much as it made my eyelashes longer, it did clump up quite a lot.</li>
      <li>I like the maybelline line of masacras just not this particular product I received.</li>
      <li>I usually love this mascara but when I received it, it was dried up.</li>
      <li>I gave three stars -- because -- even though it clumps with too many coats and the primer is difficult/time-consuming/a waste</li>
      <li>Of the few from this line that I&#x27;ve tried, this one is my favorite.</li>
      <li>It didn&#x27;t clump each lash up way fatter than normal though</li>
      <li>This mascara doesn&#x27;t run; it&#x27;s as black as night; and washes off easily at the end of the day.</li>
      <li>I have tried a few mascaras over a couple of years and so far this is the one I like the most.</li>
      <li>Well, this is a first impression, I&#x27;ve only had it about an hour or so, but I will update if I find something to be impessed with.</li>
      <li>Normally my eyelashes are completely invisible.</li>
      <li>I do tend to have sensitive skin/hair/everything though.</li>
      <li>The actual mascara is okay, but the brush is not very good.</li>
      <li>It comes with this sweet primer stuff on one end and the actual mascara on the other.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t last long at all and dries up fast.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve always been a little wary of the idea of a lash primer, I didn&#x27;t realize how much it can help, but once I tried out a few form the Maybelline XXL collection that came with primer, I realized how good it really is!</li>
      <li>No clumping unless it gets a lil old and even then it&#x27;s minimal but by then obviously you need a new one.</li>
      <li>The super heavy double layers of cream + mascara actually made patches of my eyelashes fall out!</li>
      <li>so I can only imagine it was due to having so much product on.</li>
      <li>I was not blessed with long lush eye lashes.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s white, and goes on nice enough, but it becomes difficult to cover it up with step 2, the actual mascara.</li>

<li> I wear contacts and anyone who does knows that it&#x27;s hard to find mascara that really stays put with your lenses in, this stuff does!</li>
<li> The cream isn&#x27;t exactly thin and it kind of makes your eyelashes a little heavy, but I guess that gives them volume.</li>
<li> AS LONG AS I CAN GET IT.</li>
<li> The masacra was dry when I opened it.  </li>
<li> The tame control part of this mascara tends to clump up into the brush making it difficult to place it smoothly onto the lashes, however by taking some extra time, it does help in lengthening and volumnizing the lashes.</li>
<li> You get one small amount of cream stuff and a small amount of actual mascara.</li>
<li> Anyway, before trying the cream/primer side, I did wear just the black mascara</li>
<li> My first disappointment: the primer.</li>
<li> I have long and thick eyelashes, and this mascara seems to want to turn them into just 3 tangled lashes.    </li>
<li> it had a football shape and the tiniest little brush you ever saw....</li>
<li> I received the product dried.</li>
<li> its not too expensive as far as mascaras go, either</li>
<li> I have short thin eye lashes, so I thought I&#x27;d give this a try.</li>
<li> Really not as good as any of their other products and definitely not worth losing some eye lashes.</li>
<li> I noticed it was a browish tint, but the package said Very Black.</li>
<li> It made my lashes look dark and thick, but also well separated.</li>
<li> This is the mascara I&#x27;ve used for several years and have been unable to find it anywhere in a store to buy.</li>
<li> One end has a small amount of cream colored something that you put on your lashes before the mascara</li>
<li> I use this product &amp; it is not readily available in my area!</li>
<li> Maybe my expectations were too high, but I was disappointed.    </li>
<li> And that leads into my next disappointment:</li>
<li> The primer helps make lashes thick and receptive to the mascara.</li>
<li> I have thin eyelashes</li>
<li> It gives what I would describe as a \\&quot;false</li>
<li> This one wasn&#x27;t it unfortunately.</li>
<li> and I&#x27;ve tried all the expensive name brands.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> GREAT PRODUCT, EASY TO USE, CONVENIENT, LONG LASHES. PRICE RIGHT. NO CLUMBING OF BALKIE MASCARA OR GUMMY MASCARA. I WILL BUY AGAIN.</li>
    <li> I have very short eyelashes and this mascara really makes them look longer and even at work I have been asked what mascara am I using.</li>
    <li> This mascara does not do anything magical. One end has a small amount of cream colored something that you put on your lashes before the mascara (I think this is supposed to help make your lashes appear longer or something once you put the actual mascara on afterwards.) I believe this is Maybelline&#x27;s way of ripping people off. You get one small amount of cream stuff and a small amount of actual mascara. It doesn&#x27;t last long at all and dries up fast. Doesn&#x27;t even make your lashes look longer as advertized.</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS. Normally my eyelashes are completely invisible. It comes with this sweet primer stuff on one end and the actual mascara on the other. It works wonders. Five stars!</li>
    <li> The super heavy double layers of cream + mascara actually made patches of my eyelashes fall out! I have never had this problem before so I can only imagine it was due to having so much product on. I do tend to have sensitive skin/hair/everything though. Anyway, before trying the cream/primer side, I did wear just the black mascara and it began smudging after about 3 hours. Imagine my surprise, when I went for a break at work and saw raccoon eyes after just 3 hours! I think I will stick to colossal lash!</li>
    <li> I have tried a few mascaras over a couple of years and so far this is the one I like the most.</li>
    <li> Ordered 2 blacks and got browns</li>
    <li> i like it, i use it alot. it has a good, small brush. however... i really miss the product that came befor this.... it had a football shape and the tiniest little brush you ever saw.... it made my lashes huge!  but this is good and id recommend it. its not too expensive as far as mascaras go, either</li>
    <li> I got this mascara today. It wasn&#x27;t as great as I had expexted but it&#x27;ll do. I was hoping it would be as good as The Falsies but it is not. Tested it out on my sister as well, didn&#x27;t work well either. Well, this is a first impression, I&#x27;ve only had it about an hour or so, but I will update if I find something to be impessed with.</li>
    <li> After reading many mascara \\&quot;top 10 lists\\&quot; with this at, or near the top, I decided to try it. Maybe my expectations were too high, but I was disappointed.    My first disappointment: the primer. It&#x27;s white, and goes on nice enough, but it becomes difficult to cover it up with step 2, the actual mascara. I have to do 3 coats make sure there&#x27;s no white areas showing. And that leads into my next disappointment: clumping. In order to cover up the primer fully, it requires more coats, which makes the lashes clump together. I have long and thick eyelashes, and this mascara seems to want to turn them into just 3 tangled lashes.    I do not use the primer anymore. It works just the same except without all the clumping. I recommend just going very lightly over your lashes with the brush, and make sure to scrape off the excess on opening to the tube. Many \\&quot;two step mascaras\\&quot; have the clumping issue, so I should&#x27;ve seen it coming.    I gave three stars -- because -- even though it clumps with too many coats and the primer is difficult/time-consuming/a waste, I gives nice definition and length with no flaking.</li>
    <li> I was not blessed with long lush eye lashes. This mascara makes them look a lot thicker and darker. Thank you.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s an okay product, it doesn&#x27;t really make a huge difference to me. But the good thing about it is that it doesn&#x27;t clump at all.</li>
    <li> I was taken in by the good deal!!  NOT Amazon&#x27;s fault.  I have used Maybelline mascara for years and probably tried every one.  This one is so bad because it smears at the blink of an eye!!  Raccoon eyes are what you get almost before you get out the door.</li>
    <li> LOVE THIS STUFF IT WORKS GREAT</li>
    <li> I received the product dried. I would just recommend going to your nearest drug store and purchasing it from there. I like the maybelline line of masacras just not this particular product I received. The masacra was dry when I opened it.  Never again</li>
    <li> Why Maybelline quit making this is beyond me!!  It was my absolute favorite.  It made lashes appear much fuller and it did not &amp;#34;run.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I was so dissapointed to hear that this mascara was discontinued. I have thin eyelashes and I adore the 2 step process. The #1 side is a white conditioner with fibers that attach to your eyelashes and make them look fuller and longer. then the #2 side is a &amp;#34;color&amp;#34; you pick that covers the white fibers and adds some more creating the look of fuller and longer lashes. The mascara comes off easily I use Walmart eye makeup remover.</li>
    <li> The cream isn&#x27;t exactly thin and it kind of makes your eyelashes a little heavy, but I guess that gives them volume. The actual mascara is okay, but the brush is not very good.</li>
    <li> Thanx to Amazon-I don&#x27;t have to search thru all the stores TRYING to find this!!! I use this product &amp; it is not readily available in my area!</li>
    <li> The tame control part of this mascara tends to clump up into the brush making it difficult to place it smoothly onto the lashes, however by taking some extra time, it does help in lengthening and volumnizing the lashes.</li>
    <li> Works good I didn&#x27;t know it had 2 parts to it , didn&#x27;t really like that but it still works good</li>
    <li> As much as it made my eyelashes longer, it did clump up quite a lot. Not my favorite but if you like super clumpy with super length, then this might be your thing. I think I only used it probably once or twice and went into my mascara collection. I have about 20 different mascaras from trying to find the perfect one. This one wasn&#x27;t it unfortunately.</li>
    <li> I have been using Maybelline XXL mascara for about 5 years now and this one is by far my favorite. No clumping unless it gets a lil old and even then it&#x27;s minimal but by then obviously you need a new one. I dont even use an eyelash curler and my lashes looked great. The seller of this product was awesome also, I even got a free lil gift with my purchase (not saying this is the case in every shipment, but I was super impressed)! Will purchase from this seller again for sure!</li>
    <li> muy bueno todo ,envio rapido  buen precio buena cualidad recibido mas o menos en el tiempo previsto&lt;br /&gt;los recomendo good purchase ....ok</li>
    <li> I usually love this mascara but when I received it, it was dried up. I was not at all happy with that.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always been a little wary of the idea of a lash primer, I didn&#x27;t realize how much it can help, but once I tried out a few form the Maybelline XXL collection that came with primer, I realized how good it really is! Of the few from this line that I&#x27;ve tried, this one is my favorite. The mascara, along with the primer goes on so smooth and clump free. It gives what I would describe as a \\&quot;false lashes\\&quot; look, but in a natural sense, not the super glam look. It made my lashes look dark and thick, but also well separated. It didn&#x27;t clump each lash up way fatter than normal though, I guess it all depends on the look you&#x27;re going for. And the best part about this mascara is it stays put very well. I wear contacts and anyone who does knows that it&#x27;s hard to find mascara that really stays put with your lenses in, this stuff does!</li>
    <li> I love it! This wasnt my first time using the product so I knew what to expect. However when I did recieve my mascara it was the incorrect color of what was offered and of the color in which I ordered. So when I applied the mascara to my eyelashes I noticed it was a browish tint, but the package said Very Black. So I took a look at the bottom of the tube and the color was brown, which pissed me off a bit, but luckily I like the performance of this product. Therefore just a side note for the sellers double check the product because you might not come across a customer a pleased as me.</li>
    <li> This is fantastic.  Maybelline makes the best mascara and I&#x27;ve tried all the expensive name brands.  Sometimes use just the base &amp; then usse another mascara, but always buy this mascara for the base.</li>
    <li> I bought this from walmart yesterday and I was so excited about it. First of all step one makes your eye lashes feel like you have just put glue on them. Then step 2 makes your eye lashes clump together. Really not as good as any of their other products and definitely not worth losing some eye lashes.</li>
    <li> recomiendo este producto para todas las  mujeres que quieren resaltar sus pestañas, los ojos se ven mas expresivos y es muy buena para las personas que usan lentes de contacto.</li>
    <li> I have short thin eye lashes, so I thought I&#x27;d give this a try. I love it!</li>
    <li> This is the mascara I&#x27;ve used for several years and have been unable to find it anywhere in a store to buy.</li>
    <li> This mascara doesn&#x27;t run; it&#x27;s as black as night; and washes off easily at the end of the day. The primer helps make lashes thick and receptive to the mascara. I love this</li>
    <li> ALWAYS LOVED THIS MASCARA AND I DONT UNDERSTAND WHY IT WAS DISCONTINUED IN THE STORES. I WILL CONTINUE TO ORDER IT ON HERE AS LONG AS I CAN GET IT.</li>
