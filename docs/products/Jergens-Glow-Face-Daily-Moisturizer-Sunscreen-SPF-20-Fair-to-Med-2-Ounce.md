      <li>used this once/day every day for about 4 weeks and didn&#x27;t see much of a change to my very fair skin.</li>

      <li>Easy to apply and smells nice, and it&#x27;s probably a nice companion to the GLOW body lotion, but within 30 minutes of application I felt burning patches on my face and I had an allergic reaction.</li>
      <li>No streaking , super easy to apply and great results.</li>
      <li>One of my favorite things about the Jergens Glow face moisturizer is that it&#x27;s very light</li>
      <li>that&#x27;s maybe 3 shades darker than my natural tone (which, again, is very fair).</li>
      <li>Be sure to wash your hands with soap and water promptly after application.</li>

      <li>I love this stuff.</li>
      <li>Love this product.  </li>

      <li>I have tried SO MANY self-tanners and they always stink.</li>
      <li>Love this product.</li>
      <li>I will be buying more of this product.</li>

      <li>Love this product.</li>
      <li>I am glad I tried it out a couple of months ahead of time.</li>
      <li>I am really enjoying using this product.  </li>

      <li>My face does get more color in it by using this,when I use it.</li>
      <li>I love this as a face moisturizer.</li>
      <li>I hope they or someone else can come thru with a better product.</li>

      <li>This is a good product and gives a nice color, especially for someone with my fair complexion.</li>

      <li>Good self-tanning moisturizer at a reasonable price.  </li>
      <li>The lotion has a good consistency, goes on really well and never any problems with streaks or lines.</li>
      <li>Arrived very quickly, thank you, have used this product before and continue to like the effects, does not turn my skin orange.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t experience any orangeness that others have and because this is a gradual tan product, its really easy to use without over doing it.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I wanted something to help me not look so pale in the winter and tried this and wasn&#x27;t happy.  I didn&#x27;t like the smell of it and I felt like it didn&#x27;t really apply evenly.  I didn&#x27;t use it for very long so it might have worked better if I gave it more of a chance.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it but it could work for you.</li>
    <li> Great product. Smaller then reg cdn sizes</li>
    <li> Most people use this, but it really starts to smell as the day goes by.</li>
    <li> I found Jergans Glow to be as advertised. A suddle change and no oder that I could smell. I liked the way I looked after just two days.</li>
    <li> This product lightly bronzes your skin after about a week of usage.  Continued use is necessary to retain the color, but it doesn&#x27;t darken further.  This size, if only used on the face, should last at least a month, maybe two.</li>
    <li> It was light, not think like many lotions, also I tend to break out with sunscreens/lotions-had no problems with it.</li>
    <li> I wear this stuff day and night - no joke. I can&#x27;t stand looking pasty; this lotion gives you a slight glow and not a \\&quot;fake tan\\&quot;. I used to purchase a pricey self-tanner for face lotion at the beauty supply, but it was costing me and arm and a leg, and did not have SPF in it. The lotion is thin and not sticky and if you need a little extra moisture (I often do), you can layer it under another moisturizer or even additional sunscreen (if I&#x27;m going to be in direct sunlight). My only wish is that they made this stuff in a larger size. I go through one per month it seems.</li>
    <li> Jergens Natural Glow Healthy Complexion Daily Facial Moisturizer has been a very positive boost to my skincare regime.  I have vitiligo which causes the skin to lose its pigmentation so I have large areas on my face that have absolutely no color.  I try not to let it get to me but particularly in the summer months when I tan in some areas and then have these huge blotches it really does bother me.  I have tried different self-tanners and so far they have either been prohibitely expensive, cause me to break out, or they turned my skin orange, not tan.  Jergens Natural Glow has been the nicest surprise and totally unexpected as I just grabbed it initially off a Walmart shelf without really expecting any results.  The product works beautifully, looks very natural, lasts so I don&#x27;t have to apply it every day (and I am in the pool year round!), and is INEXPENSIVE.  Thanks to Jergens for this fantastic product!  I don&#x27;t want to suggest that it will work for everyone but if you have vitiligo you may want to give this one a try.</li>
    <li> This causes cysts on my chin.  I have cystic acne and I bougt the moisturizer since it waslabeled as oil free, sun screen, and tanner.  Smell and colorizer OK but can&#x27;t deal with huge cysts it causes.  I hope they or someone else can come thru with a better product.</li>
    <li> I believe I used this item before and stopped for a reason. over the last few months of using this, I developed a large cyst near my cheek. Never had one before. I blame it on the self tanner, we will see if I get anymore since I stopped using it</li>
    <li> Non-greasy, natural looking color and gradually tans. Have used for a few years</li>
    <li> I just bought this product YESTERDAY, but I had to write a review on it today because it is so incredible! I have naturally fair skin with an orangish undertone and slight acne. It states on the back if results aren&#x27;t as noticeable as desired, to reapply it more frequently. So of course little-impatient-me reapplied it around 5-6 times that day. The affects were noticeable by doing so, and they are incredible!   *I took a long shower and washed my face twice and the color didn&#x27;t wash off (*hint hint* swimming? :D).   *In the same light which previously made me look like a zombie, I look healthy and in the same light which made me look healthy, I look radiant.   My acne is less noticeable  and I can continue using this product since it is NON-COMEDOGENIC (doesn&#x27;t cause acne). It is also oil-free, dermatologist-tested, and lightweight.   *I can ditch coverup (which always made me look even MORE unhealthy!) and wear glittery white eyeliner and not look tacky :D   *This product smells better than my designer perfumes! I live in California, and this definitely has a sweet, beachy smell (but not like seaweed haha), but more like a boardwalk smell on a nice, relaxing, summer day!  *They have a matching body-lotion which smells even better and has light specks of glitter in it :D   I had tried fake-tanner before and looked so unnatural, but this product gave my skin such a natural sun-kissed look I had never seen on myself before. I can go to the beach now, still wearing my sunblock, AND have a nice, sun-kissed, glow!  This is one of the best beauty products I have found in a long while!   I highly recommend this product if you are looking for a slight boost in color, but not a strong tan :D</li>
    <li> I have pale skin, and I was trying to work up a gradual tan on my face and body or this summer, so I purchased this product.  Unfortunately, though I applied it twice daily, my face is still as white as ever, and now it&#x27;s beginning to contrast with my bronzed... chest and rest of body because the other product at least worked.  I don&#x27;t know whether it&#x27;s because I wash my face twice a day or if it was the wrong skin bronzer (but I&#x27;m REALLY pale!!!!)... It failed to make a difference in the color on my face.  This lotion does not work... So I have to continue my search for a face bronzer that can get the job done...  :(</li>
    <li> for the price its pretty good.... the only thing i didnt like is that it makes my skin pretty dry.. but other than that i would def buy it!</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this stuff!  Have been using it once a day for five days and my skin looks radiant, tan, and natural!  It is also non comedogenic (won&#x27;t clog pores), and therefore my acne hasn&#x27;t flared up and I also use less makeup!  Would recommend to anyone looking for a light, natural, tan look quickly without damaging your skin in the sun.</li>
    <li> I would definitely recommend this product to anybody even considering buying this. You will see a positive noticeable change in your complexion within just a few days. The only thing that you must watch out for is using it more than once a day, because that will most likely cause your face to get an unwanted orange tint. The glycerin in this product works really well for anybody who has slight to moderate acne.</li>
    <li> Easy to apply.  Not much of a smell.  Gradual color.</li>
    <li> My hair stylist recommended this product to me. I have fair skin but after about 3 weeks of daily use, I can see a very nice tan on my unexposed areas. The parts that get some sun ( arms and face), darkened a bit faster. I always try to buy hypoallergenic products if I can. I haven&#x27;t had any reaction like a rash or itching with this lotion, so it&#x27;s all good. When I&#x27;m able to wear summer clothing then I&#x27;ll just use a good quality sunscreen.  I made a mistake by posting this review, which I wrought  for the body lotion, but the result is the same for both Jergen&#x27;s self tanning products.</li>
    <li> I used this product as instructed and it just ended up turning my face an unnatural shade of orange/brown.</li>
    <li> im a cheater. i like to look tan before i step out in the sun. i use the all over body foam with much success and i wanted to try this for my face. after 5 applications over a 2 day period my face is darker. im afraid to keep applying &#x3D;). looks natural. recommended for sure!</li>
    <li> I used to abuse my skin by lounging lizard-like in the Arizona sun and coupling that with tanning booth time at the gym. After a few less than favorable dermatologist lectures, I gave it all up and let my skin return to it&#x27;s normal Wednesday Addams hue. With both melasma and rosacea, this was not the most attractive look, particularly to a former fake and baker.     I picked up Jergens Natural Glow facial moisturizer, fair to medium, on a whim and have been pleasantly surprised. I&#x27;ve been applying in the morning in place of my previous SPF lotion. I noticed the start of a glow that day. By day 2, I was getting compliments. After a week away due to business trips, the trainer at the gym asked what I&#x27;d been up to. The color is natural and looks like I&#x27;ve spent some time out in the sun. I make a concerted effort to massage the lotion into the hairline, around the neck and up onto the earlobes, but haven&#x27;t noticed any streaking. For me, it helps even out my skin tone and has meant that I&#x27;m wearing less makeup. I haven&#x27;t seen an increase in anything pimple-like nor have I noticed any dryness (worth noting is that I&#x27;m on airplanes almost weekly and live in an extremely dry climate). For whatever it might indicate, I liked it enough to go back and purchase the body lotion version of the same product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years. Works as advertised. Great product!</li>
    <li> I have tried SO MANY self-tanners and they always stink. I just can&#x27;t stand the smell. This one doesn&#x27;t AT ALL. I&#x27;ve been using it for a few weeks now and my face has a nice, subtle natural glow. It feels good on my skin. With the sunscreen, it&#x27;s a win-win.</li>
    <li> Great for a natural facial glow without the damaging effects of the tanning booth, i will definitely be ordering more!</li>
    <li> Works great.  Looks natural,smells nice.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for less than one week and my face already has that &amp;#34;been in the sun&amp;#34; look.</li>
    <li> Looks great but after a few days, can&#x27;t get color off your face.</li>
    <li> Good aw a sunscreen and adds just the right amount of tan.</li>
    <li> It works as a sunscreen great. It is good as a moisturizer. I have not been overly impressed with it as a color enhancer.</li>
    <li> +gradual color for someone with fair skin, works fine for me as daily moisturizer -a bit of a smell, but I don&#x27;t notice it much after application.  Best gradual tanner for fair skin, face, that I&#x27;ve found.  I buy it frequently, I would recommend it to a friend.</li>
    <li> Goes on nicely, adds just a bit of color to my fair skin and doesn&#x27;t smell bad.  Protects against the sun with SPF.  All around great moisturizer.</li>
    <li> This is a very nice-feeling moisturizer with buildable color.  I don&#x27;t like the sun on my face, so this product &amp;#34;matches&amp;#34; my face with the rest of me during tanning season.  You don&#x27;t need it every day, just a couple of days per week, depending on how often you are outdoors. I would recommend this product to fair skinned individuals who are trying to protect their faces from the aging effects of sun exposure.</li>
    <li> This goes on smooth and I don&#x27;t have any noticeable splotchy tan. It has a pleasant smell as opposed to some other self tanning lotion I&#x27;ve used in the past. My face does not feel oily afterward, but it is moisturized sufficiently. I&#x27;m happy to know my skin is protected from the sun while getting a little glow.</li>
    <li> Can burn if your face is sensitive not to mention my grocery store has these travel sized for $2</li>
    <li> I did not like this product because it contained too much perfume.  I would not recommend this to anyone and would not buy it again.</li>
    <li> I always make sure to use a moisturizer with sunscreen and had high hopes for this product after reading the other reviews. Previous experience with self tanners had not been good but I thought I would give this a try. Unfortunately this product gave my face a definite orange tinge. I&#x27;m not sure but it could be because my skin has a yellow undertone. I will not be buying this product again.</li>
    <li> I have acne prone skin that I&#x27;m able to keep clear with a strict topical regimen. The first time I used this product, my clear skin broke out with several pimples within 24 hours. Up until this point I had never encountered a product that made me break out so quickly, my understanding of acne was that if you use a product on your face that is going to break you out, your skin would react to it in 2-4 days. Because of this I didn&#x27;t want to conclusively contribute my breakout to this moisturizer, and wanted to give it another shot. I used the product three more times, each time several weeks apart, and every time without fail the results were the same--within 24 hours I broke out with anywhere between 3-6 pimples, sometimes in places on my face where I&#x27;ve never gotten pimples before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I rarely give a product a one-star review, but if my rating is to reflect my personal experience, this product is completely unusable for me. I don&#x27;t mean for this to scare anyone away from trying this, as it seems so many others are able to use this without issue. But if you have acne prone skin like me, I recommend you approach this product with caution. Feel free to try it out, since it is so cheap, but consider taking it slow with your applications and keeping an eye on your skin to see how it reacts.</li>
    <li> Great product. No heavy scent. Works well. I would purchase this item again. Arrived on time. Happy with this seller.</li>
    <li> worked well, just dont over apply!</li>
    <li> Easy to apply and smells nice, and it&#x27;s probably a nice companion to the GLOW body lotion, but within 30 minutes of application I felt burning patches on my face and I had an allergic reaction.</li>
    <li> Works great! Especially during the cold Midwest winters! You still keep a tan and do not turn orange. Will work/use during the summer months as well since it also has sunscreen added!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my wife since she was looking for something like this.  She has fair to medium toned complexion and this works fine.  It moisturizes her skin and allows her to spend the day outdoors.  The SPF is 20 so she doesn&#x27;t get a burn and there is some slight tanning effect.</li>
    <li> Comes out rather dark. But pretty even compared to the body lotion.</li>
    <li> My rating is not based on the seller but on the product itself.  Natural glow myself. I followed the product directions and it gave me an orange jaundice look. Thank god it started wearing off once I quit using it for several days. Very misleading stating results within a week</li>
    <li> Great moisturizer sunscreen and it gives you a light gradual tan that does not look fake.</li>
    <li> Not impressed.  Does not work like others I&#x27;ve used...cannot even see it.  I use it generously, but still tan look does not show.</li>
    <li> I have used this product every day for 4+ years. I am naturally tan and dont want to get any darker especially in the summer time so this one helps me maintain my natural color. It helps keep my skin moisturized all seasons long. I ussually get my skin really ashy especially on the cold season but this helps me a lot Also, it doesn&#x27;t have a greasy feel to it, which is perfect. I will absolutely recommend.</li>
    <li> THIS IS A GREAT RODUCT AND A GREAT PRICE! I WOULD DEFINITELY RECOMMEND!!!</li>
    <li> Make sure you wash your hands after you use this, or they will turn a slight orange...at least mine did. But I am VERY fair skinned. But for my face, it is perfect! It not only moisturizes my face and gives me a little more color for the winter time, it gives me a slight glow too. I love it; it does exactly what I wanted it to! Will buy again!</li>
    <li> As expected and fast delivery!</li>
    <li> Light, and doesn&#x27;t over-tan. Not orangey. I get acne from stress, hormones etc but this hasn&#x27;t made me break out yet. Doesn&#x27;t smell too bad for a tanner.</li>
    <li> I have dry skin,so I tried this.It is a good moisturizer.My skin peels on my nose and around my eyebrows.I am 57 years old.My face does get more color in it by using this,when I use it.I just don&#x27;t use it every day.It is a good product.</li>
    <li> This is just too oily for me and too hard to get the right lines with the color around the face. I also got some concentrated color where I wore sunglasses for the day.</li>
    <li> Arrived very quickly, thank you, have used this product before and continue to like the effects, does not turn my skin orange.</li>
    <li> Overall it was a little greasy feeling and made me concerned my skin would break out, so I probably wasn&#x27;t using it often enough. I never saw any results as far as darkening. The scent is still kind of strange, and on your face scent definitely matters. Not thrilled with it at all.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. I&#x27;m very tan with oily/acne prone skin and as a moisturizer this is a great product for me. It hydrates without making me oily and doesn&#x27;t make me break out like some tanning products do. I didn&#x27;t experience any orangeness that others have and because this is a gradual tan product, its really easy to use without over doing it.</li>
    <li> Disclaimer - I use an AHA cream cleanser in the morning, and a BHA gel cleanser in the evening.  I think because they are formulated to help with discoloration, they may hinder the tanning process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used this once/day every day for about 4 weeks and didn&#x27;t see much of a change to my very fair skin. (see disclaimer above).  However, I liked the smell, it moisturized without making my combo skin oily, and didn&#x27;t cause any more breakouts to my already acne-prone skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I apply a very small amount of this product (don&#x27;t forget to wash hands after, as with any self tanner... it&#x27;s easy to forget because this doesn&#x27;t feel like one.)  to my face, blending down my jaw/neck.  I like that you don&#x27;t have to use a sponge or mitt or anything; just your hands.  I let it sit for about a minute or so while combing my hair, etc., and then apply Too Faced BB Cream in vanilla glow.  After using cream blush, I follow up with Bare Minerals Loose Foundation in Matte, fairly medium.  The ending result is a radiant glow that I have not found alone by using just the BB cream &amp; foundation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Again, I think I may see more results if I didn&#x27;t use the AHA/BHA, but I do like this product anyhow.</li>
    <li> I use this about 3 days a week--I find if I use it more than that it gets too dark</li>
    <li> One of my favorite summer and winter beauty products!! I have a skin condition and this takes care of that.</li>
    <li> I have VERY pale pasty skin. My natural color is that of a dying cancer patient. But my dermatologist friends very strongly recommned using a decent spf at least on my face every day so after a summer in the sun but my face being constantly covered with a hat and 35spf sunscreen my face color is very out of porportion with my body. So I tried this product very worried with my face being soo pale that this stuff would be streaky and too dark. I can barely tell a difference after a week. I guess it&#x27;s good. I think theres a little more color to my face but not too much but I am so pale that too much color would look wierd. It goes on smooth and has a light scent that goes away quickly. In my case I think it&#x27;s good it does not work TOO well. I just need a little someting so I don&#x27;t look like I am dying.</li>
    <li> Maybe I don&#x27;t use it enough, but I don&#x27;t really notice my face being any darker.  I will probably stick with my regular moisturizer once this is gone.</li>
    <li> This is very good for facial use.  Comes on gradually and is mild for your skin as well as containing sunscreen.</li>
    <li> I noticed results by the end of the first day, though as a rather pale person it was easy to get results quickly.  I have lots of freckles and some hormone-related splotchiness on my face, so this has really helped even it out.  I was careful blending it in around my hairline and down into my neck, so it looks really natural.  Very happy with it...a golden tan without adding to my freckling and sun damage!</li>
    <li> I am a very fair skinned man, and this stuff brings a very subtle and natural color to the skin, on top of being a good moisturizer with a sun block as well.</li>
    <li> Dont know what happened, i cleaned my face &amp; applied this, but nothing happened! So i put Alot in my arms &amp; got some color. Yellowish though.</li>
    <li> I received a sample and instead of my very pale skin, I suddenly had a tan. Then I saw it in the sunlight and although it did look like a tan, it was way too dark for me and I saw a demarcation line. I want it off! I used a scrub and now will wait a few days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want your legs to look tan, use it very carefully and blend it well, being sure to blend out rather than come to an abrupt halt. I assume that&#x27;d look good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would never use it or anything like it again. Back to self-acceptance!</li>
    <li> I like the jergens for legs product, but this was ORANGE. Can&#x27;t believe the difference. I expected it to have more gradual color increase than the body product, but it was stronger and ORANGE. Thank God it was the weekend. By the way, did I mention the orange?</li>
    <li> I love this as a face moisturizer. However, I have seen little to no additional tanness in my face. I only put a small amount on daily, enough to moisturize my face after a shower.</li>
    <li> It is a nice moisturizer and it works really well to give you a light tan that looks natural. I&#x27;m not a big fan of the smell though.</li>
    <li> I was kind of sceptical at first with this product because their were not very many reviews on it. I needed something to even out my face color with my neck. I do not wear powder or foundation on my face because it makes me break out so much. This is what I chose to try. This product is one of the best things I have ever used on my face. It really does even out my skin tones and it does look healthy. The first week I started using it, I put it on every night. It only took one week to get to the color I wanted. Now I only put it on every other day. I would recommend this product to anyone that had the same problem as I have had for so long.</li>
    <li> use as a daily moisturizer and sunscreen, no heavy feeling or fragrance.  This is a good product and gives a nice color, especially for someone with my fair complexion.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not real sure that it&#x27;s working for color?</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a big fan of both the face and body Daily Glow products from Jergens. I&#x27;m pretty fair (burn easily, have a hard time EVER getting an actual tan), and this stuff helps me get a nice even color on my face. I use it almost every day, which helps me maintain a color on my face that&#x27;s maybe 3 shades darker than my natural tone (which, again, is very fair). During the summer I use it a bit more often, and I use the body lotion as well, to give me a warmer summertime look. It has never, I repeat NEVER, given me streaks of any sort on my face or neck. This is the #1 reason this stuff is the best. The other thing I love about this stuff is that it doesn&#x27;t take much at all to get color. I typically mix it with my regular Olay facial moisturizer, in a roughly 1-1 ratio; this way, I can use it every day and just maintain, rather than continually build, my color. I&#x27;ve tried doing this with other sunless tanners and they sometimes get diluted and don&#x27;t really build color (the Olay I use has lots of SPF in it, and it&#x27;s almost as if the Olay cancels out the tanner&#x27;s color-building properties). Don&#x27;t know why this one always works so much better, but it does! The ONLY complaint that I have is that it does have a bit of that self-tanner smell. I&#x27;m not sure there&#x27;s any getting around this, though. They all have it.</li>
    <li> Despite my liking of Jergen&#x27;s body self-tanning lotion, this product is mediocre to bad. I like the price and the fact that it has SPF in it.  However, I am very fair skinned and have sensitive/break out prone skin.  It has caused breakouts and turned my skin a yellow/orange color.  Will be trying a new product.</li>
    <li> This product might be great, but I will never know- I was sent a tube that EXPIRED SIX MONTHS AGO!  Was bad enough when I realized it was the &amp;#34; bait and switch&amp;#34; other reviewers warned about ( not the &amp;#34;new and improved&amp;#34; version pictured) but then I got to wondering how old the product might be and I&#x27;ll be darned if the thing didn&#x27;t expire in October of last year. Don&#x27;t trust this seller!</li>
    <li> Why bother with an SPF if you have to reapply every 2 hours. I have fair skin and use this every other day. Works beautifully as a sunless tanner. No streaks and not orange, just a shade darker.</li>
    <li> This is my go to lotion, use it every day.  Enough tint to make me glow.  Not enough color to make me look like a pumpkin.  This is not a foundation, it is a lotion.</li>
    <li> I have very fair skin and wanted to add a bit of color for my wedding. I am glad I tried it out a couple of months ahead of time. After only two uses, it began to turn my face a nice jaundiced looking yellow/orange. I would not recommend this for anyone with a fair complexion.</li>
    <li> tried for first time today and this evening as I washed my face I could see a light tan color on my face, on the first use!! I have high hopes for this moisturizer, only takes a little bit and spread it to hairline and neck. There is no chemical smell like self tanners I have used previously sold on the major shopping channels, and the cost is MUCH lower. I will try the body cream and give further progress reports. Price. Is even cheaper than walmart.Thanks Amazon</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t see the results suggested on box, smell was terrible and the thick cream clogged pores. I will not purchase this item again, plus it is old version being sold... Which in my mind the older one should be discontinued for purchase if there was a reason to update with newer version. Clearly something was unsatisfactory to previous product version</li>
    <li> Jergens has reformulated this product, and has non of the normal tanner smell! The lotion has a good consistency, goes on really well and never any problems with streaks or lines. I use it daily and I find it works great as a daily moisturizer.</li>
    <li> My face has a beautiful shining color and gradually I looked like I had been on the beach for a long time.  Of course with no harm done!</li>
    <li> I have fair to medium skin.&lt;br /&gt;This product did very little.&lt;br /&gt;Furthermore, it gave me mild breakouts. Not a fan.&lt;br /&gt;The results were mild&lt;br /&gt;If you want a slight glow, then this product may be for you.&lt;br /&gt;However, do not expect anything drastic.</li>
    <li> This stuff is nice. It smells good which was a pleasant surprise. Its very subtle and good for me since I am so pale.</li>
    <li> I can never find this great product anywhere except here at Amazon. It gives me just enough color on my face without looking overdone. It has never made my face appear yellow or orange, like some other products. Be sure to wash your hands with soap and water promptly after application.</li>
    <li> I have used this product every day for 5+ years. It keeps me from getting scarily pale during the winter. People often comment that I am naturally tan, and I do not mention the fact that I always use this! Helps keep my skin moisturized as well. Also, it doesn&#x27;t have a greasy feel to it, which is great.</li>
    <li> This is a good moisturizer and I guess it adds some color but not much.  I like it and the smell is fine.</li>
    <li> It works, but the expiration date was in one month.  I think they sent old inventory.</li>
    <li> I am a very pale person so this gives my face an amazing natural glow. I also have very bad acne so a main concern I had for tihs product was will it make my acne worst and clog my pours. I feel that it moisturized my face without cloging my pours. I use this as a daily moisturizor and even bought Jergens firming natural glow after trying this product. I love them both, use them daily, and plan to keep using them daily.</li>
    <li> Really does give your face a slight glowing effect. If you squirt some on the counter/table/whatever and just let it sit there, you can see it change color from white to brown. It&#x27;s kind of weird, but It gives you a nice healthy look</li>
    <li> Good self-tanning moisturizer at a reasonable price.  Unlike other self-tanning moisturizers, this one does not smell.  Only complaint/reservation is it would be nice if the sun protection element were at a  higher level.</li>
    <li> Jergens has hit a home run with this NEW formula.  It left my skin moisturized and Glowing, and they got rid of the smell that I never cared for.  Also, living in Colorado I love the SPF 20 in the product.  You Glow Jergens!!!!</li>
    <li> The new version of this moisturizer and self tanner for the face is just wonderful!  This is the first one I&#x27;ve tried that doesn&#x27;t have that bad self tanner smell.  This self tanner is easy to use and works well.  I really like the color.  It looks very natural and the fair to medium works well on porcelain, very fair people.  It never gets very dark on me, but I think that would look very fake on a very pale person.  I think it&#x27;s just perfect for my complexion.  I prefer this to other very expensive self tanners I have tried.</li>
    <li> I really didn&#x27;t see the difference on my face like I did with the body lotion</li>
    <li> ALL I CAN SAY IS I LOVE IT</li>
    <li> My first review was incorrect. I thought that I was reviewing another product that I had bought. Sorry about that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one thing I must warn of ... if you are older and starting to get \\&quot;age spots,\\&quot; this product will darken those age spots (does not look good). So, that&#x27;s one thing you have to keep in mind. I&#x27;m 54 years old, and although it did give me a nice looking tanned look, the age spot looked terrible. So, I discontinued using the product. As soon as I quit using it, the age spot went away. It sort of scared me because I thought it was going to be permanent.</li>
    <li> The smell is great, but haven&#x27;t noticed a color change.</li>
    <li> Love this product. Easy to apply, pleasant scent, and includes an SPF. Just watch out for it getting caught in your eyebrows and unnatrually tinting them!</li>
    <li> One of my favorite things about the Jergens Glow face moisturizer is that it&#x27;s very light and you can&#x27;t tell that you have anything on your face. And I think because of that it doesn&#x27;t give much color, even after a week of regular use. What it does do is keep your skin looking radiant and definitely evens out your skin tone after a few days. If you&#x27;re looking for a fresh out of the sun look, you won&#x27;t get it here though.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great , I have super pale skin and freckles , this is the first product that I have used that really works with my skin tone. No streaking , super easy to apply and great results. I apply it everyday and I have an awesome healthy glow. Highly recommend!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this for a few years now. It gives an nice glow without being fake looking. you just have to blend it really well and avoid the eyebrows and hair line.</li>
    <li> I saw no difference in my color of my face after using it regularly for 2 weeks.  Don&#x27;t waste your money!!</li>
    <li> I am a huge fan of the new Jergens formula because it works amazing and doesn&#x27;t smell. From what I understand they worked on the formula for 7 years to get it to where it doesn&#x27;t smell. I was actually nervous to order this because of the great price but I compared the package in the photo to my bottle and they were the same. Sadly after waiting over a week to get my package I quickly realized that they sent me the old version which has a different box and bottle as the one shown here and smells horrible. Such a waste of my time and money. I&#x27;m sending back so I can order the new formula again.</li>
    <li> This product came with the top awkwardly cut off which seems like it was done intentionally to remove the expiration date.</li>
    <li> Works extremely well and quickly after only the initial application and a follow-up</li>
    <li> I love the body lotion of this product, but the face lotion and I don&#x27;t get along. It made me break-out bad.  If you have sensitive skin I would not use this product (just use bronser instead:)</li>
    <li> Love this product.  I have used it for years.  I am very pale &amp; this gives me just the right glow!!!</li>
    <li> I have been using this for the past month along with the regular Jergens 3 Days to Natural Glow lotion for the rest of my body  (Don&#x27;t use the regular body foam stuff as my daughter and I find it leave streak marks). The Glow Face is more subtle and colors more evenly than using the regular lotion for your face. I put it on 2 or 3 times a week to get ready for our trip to the Bahamas. It&#x27;s a little pricey, but it works. Despite the claims of no odor, there is a faint sun tanning product or lotion smell. It is barely noticeable and is not offensive in any way. I will be buying more of this product. My only regret is that it does not come in a larger, more economical size. Also, be sure to rub it in well and wash your hands well after applying (especially at the edge of your palms). Pleasantly surprised that this product actually does what it says!</li>
    <li> I thought this would help me get a nice soft tan, but at the end of the day it left me orange. Inside it looked fine, but when I went outside you could really tell - and I felt so embarrassed.</li>
    <li> Jergens really is un-matched when it comes to sunless tanning. It delivers gorgeous, never orangey, sun-kissed &amp;#34;tan&amp;#34; skin at an amazingly low price. You cannot beat that!&lt;br /&gt;The reason I only gave it 4 stars? I&#x27;ve used these products for nine years, and have never gotten any moisturizing benefits at all, my face actually feels a bit drier when I use it at night and wake up the next morning.  If this didn&#x27;t have &amp;#34;moisturizer&amp;#34; in the title and just talked about color, 5 stars.  So if you have a fave moisturizer already? Just keep using it. Buy the Jergens for the great color!</li>
    <li> it gave a yellowish orangey color, so i dont advise to take from fair to medium yet medium to dark.</li>
    <li> I use this sparingly and lately have had a number of compliments on the improved color of my skin.  I have fair skin and if I use it too frequently I look a little bit unnatural - every 3 or 4 days seems just about right.</li>
    <li> This is a good basic face moisturizer and it gives you a bit of color as well. The SPF 20 is an added benefit.</li>
    <li> This is a great product, Nice subtle color and spf for summer.</li>
    <li> I love this face lotion! Finally something I can put on my face and not break out in red bumps. Yet it gives me just the right amount of color so that I don&#x27;t even need make up.</li>
    <li> Love this product. This is a very slow growing color, so it&#x27;s perfect for the face. Don&#x27;t expect a &amp;#34;tan&amp;#34;, but a gentle color.</li>
    <li> I an quite fair skinned so avoid the sun, and use this fair-medium tanner/sunscreen.  If you don&#x27;t get too impatient and overdo the application, it gives a healthy glow. Apply in circular motion, not in streaks. Follow instructions and you should be pleased, It can stain your clothing so be careful, it WILL satin your fingernails, I use a glove when applying.</li>
    <li> I am really enjoying using this product.  I gives me just a little color and since I can&#x27;t go in the sun anymore it is a nice alternative to white and pasty.</li>
    <li> I had hoped that this product would add a bit of color to my face. I didn&#x27;t notice that after 3 weeks use. It does, however have other benefits for me. It makes my skin smooth, yet not greasy. And my sometimes sensitive skin hasn&#x27;t broke out from this. So I use it for moisturizing benefits, even if I didn&#x27;t see the slight bit of color I was hoping for.</li>
    <li> Use it routinely and it looks great</li>
    <li> bought this for my daughter. she likes the hint of color it gives her without looking like a bronzer</li>
    <li> It was here in plenty of time,and it works really well. For the price, I&#x27;m extrememly happy!! I would order it again.</li>
    <li> My skin is white as heck! I used this every day for 7 days. Applied it twice a day and it gave me a bit of color. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Hated it.  Made my face look dirty.  Threw it away after 2-3 uses.</li>
</ol>
