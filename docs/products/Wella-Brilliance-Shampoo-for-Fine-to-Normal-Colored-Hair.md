<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I had a different experience than the other reviewers. My hair just didn&#x27;t feel clean after using this shampoo. (I also used the companion Wella conditioner.) There was some kind of residual left on my hair that made it hang in clumps. I also found the scent of the shampoo to be unpleasantly overpowering. I used Graham Webb Vivid Color Shampoo for years and loved it. Unfortunately, the Graham Webb products have been discontinued, and the Wella product just doesn&#x27;t compare.</li>
    <li> I just received a free travel kit in the mail and I have to say...I love this product.  I have oily hair that is color treated and have tried so many products and nothing works like this. My hair is so shiny and manageable after using it... I actually went to the salon and had my hair cut when leaving i was given a free sample of their salon shampoo and conditioner to try...I hate to say this..but it did not give me the results that Wella did.... I am so hooked on it that I plan on purchasing both shampoo and conditioner for myself.</li>
    <li> I would recommend this shampoo to anyone with fine hair. It&#x27;s great. It came on time and I had no problems.</li>
    <li> I have used this shampoo (and the conditioner) for almost a year so I felt like I could give a good review on this for anybody looking to buy a conditioner and shampoo.  When I first bought this I had dyed my hair red that day.  Since I was doing swimming at the time (Yes, yes I know) I though that the smell had to do with the swimming so I didn&#x27;t mind it.  But as I continued to use it after swimming I noticed that the smell lingered.  I only wash my hair every 5-7 days (if we&#x27;re on vacation or I don&#x27;t need to go anywhere) because I want to save the color.  After the 2nd or 3rd day my hair always started to smell.  The smell was the exact same as the shampoo and conditioner.  Also after a few months (This shampoo and conditioner will last you for 4-6 months just saying) my hair started to get more and more oily.  The last time I washed my hair with this stuff it didn&#x27;t clean it at all, the oil was still in my hair!  I would recommend getting this shampoo if you don&#x27;t mind the smell of... well dirty socks or something along the lines of that.  The shampoo (aside from the smell) is still great because it does work as a color saver and reduces the dye washing out in the shower but even with how great it was I still wouldn&#x27;t go buy another.  Also do keep in mind that I bought this shampoo mid May last year and it has lasted me till now (I did stop coloring my hair for 2 months).  Good shampoo but the smell is the thing that puts me off.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff! Makes my hair light and soft and so shiny! I will continue to use! My hairdresser even uses this so I know it is good!</li>
    <li> The shampoo is OK. I bought it because it&#x27;s color safe. The smell is very nice. I don&#x27;t know if I would order it again. There are so many products to try. I ordered it from The Brow Art and I would order from them again the shipping was really fast. Thank you for the great service.</li>
    <li> Another wonderful product from Wella !!! Thank you for such great service &amp; fast delivery on all the products I purchased from you. A+A+A+</li>
    <li> I really like Wella products in general. I have fine hair  that is colored treated so I had to try this shampoo when it came out. My problem is, I have oily scalp, which tends to be an issue unless I use a shampoo specifically for oily scalp. Well this shampoo pleasantly surprised me. My oil is a non issue with this shampoo. It leaves my hair shiny, but I don&#x27;t experience oil build up like I usually do. I am very happy with this product.</li>
    <li> Great, smells good too!</li>
    <li> This product works better than most drug store-type shampoos, but I think I&#x27;m spoiled with Alterna products. Would definitely use if I had to do without Alterna.</li>
    <li> Too expensive for results. Can achieve similar results with store products. On the plus side, a little goes a long way and leaves a nice shine.</li>
    <li> It is a good shampoo for fine colored hair, it leaves it soft and shiny, the smell is very pleasant, it leaves the hair silky and looking healthy. It is a very good product.</li>
    <li> I always have to have this shampoo.  I have Blond Highlights and this shampoo makes them look brighter - kind of glisten!  It is my &amp;#34;have to have&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> Works very well on my hair.  Color doesn&#x27;t seem to fade quite as rapidly as with some other shampoos.  Leaves my hair smooth and shiny.</li>
    <li> I am very disappointed  I&#x27;ve used this product before.  I think that this shipment of the product is old.  It doesn&#x27;t have the nice, fresr apple fragrance.  I&#x27;m very unhappy.</li>
    <li> Shampoo is awesome. and the delivery services was great.</li>
    <li> it has become my new go-to shampoo for my color treated hair!</li>
    <li> I purchased this shampoo based on its reputation for being a quality product.  The problem I had was the bottle.  Every time I squeezed out some shampoo the flip tab on the lid falls off onto the floor. The shampoo gets all over the inner lid. It&#x27;s just messy and unacceptable for what I payed for this item. I&#x27;m just disappointed and wouldn&#x27;t buy this again. Just too cheap of a bottle for me.</li>
    <li> Got this as a sample from my hairdresser to try I liked it so much bought it. My hair really shines with this.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried a lot of different hair care brands, from the regular drug store ones (eck) to the very expensive ones.  I can honestly say that Wella beats the competition by a mile.  I&#x27;ve done a lot of damage to my hair over the past few years: bleaching, highlighting, dying, getting the Japanese straightening which *kills* your hair, getting a perm, swimming in swimming pools, and skiing in dry, cold mountain air.  One can imagine how brittle, coarse, and damaged my hair was.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using Wella for about a few months, it seems as if that damage was almost completely reversed!  I use both the shampoo and companion conditioner, so I can&#x27;t tell which is making my hair so soft and silky.  But I know my hair is much healthier because of these two products, as I did not undergo any significant hair treatments and used only Wella.  Plus, this shampoo has helped me maintain the color of my highlights longer than any other shampoo that I&#x27;ve used.  The best part is, you don&#x27;t have to use a huge amount of product to get a good lather in the shower.  My boyfriend and I use this brand together, and the bottle lasts out the two of us for at least two and a half months.  Mind that I have a lot of hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I highly recommend this product to anyone who is looking for a gentle, everday shampoo that will keep hair soft and silky.  I will mostly likely explore other brands in the far future, but at least for now, I&#x27;m going to stick with Wella.</li>
    <li> Smells Great!  Fruity, sweet.  It is a rich creamy shampoo, makes my hair so clean, does not tangle my hair all up like some others do.  It definitely makes my hair soft, shiny and cooperative!  I&#x27;m using the bumble and bumble curl conscious conditioner with this, and the 2 together work well.  I want to try the Wella conditioner now though, b/c I&#x27;m hooked on this shampoo!  And doesn&#x27;t leave my scalp oily the second day..! :)</li>
    <li> Wonderful stuff..............Leaves my hair with the just left the salon feel. I will be ordering more of this product when mine runs out.  Ordering was easy and came on time as promised.</li>
    <li> It is bigger than normal, and these wella products are the best for colored hairs. Just don&#x27;t waste time and money testing other products-</li>
    <li> I bought my first bottle from a hair care professional and loved it.  I hope they don&#x27;t stop making this product, because it is perfect for fine hair.  It is light in texture with a mild (almost no) fragrance.  I have no fly-away or frizz problems after shampooing and drying.  The price is very reasonable.</li>
    <li> So much more reasonable than at the hairdressers!</li>
    <li> This shampoo is fabulous! My hair feels clean but not stripped. It leaves my hair smooth, very shiney, frizz and static free.</li>
    <li> I have fine hair that is also highlighted.  This shampoo does not dry out my hair.  It leaves my hair silky and looking healthy.  In addition, the smell is wonderful.  I have been using this product for over a year and will continue.</li>
    <li> I keep an extra of this on hand! The product that I have been using for years is no longer available. This product is now my fave! It leaves my hair soft, silky, and shiny!</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo and conditioner, it makes my hair shiny and soft. Am picky on hair products since i color my hair every 4 weeks, i used to use KERATASE which i loved for years (quite expensive though ..) until i found Briliance by Wella .. This shampoo gives the same result, same feel as Keratase for a lot cheaper price.. if you love soft creamy shampoo &amp; conditioner which was only found on good ones ... this is the product for you ...</li>
    <li> So recently I discovered something that I thought to share with everyone. I have used Wella off and on since last years when the new product came out. I liked it overall. Good product. I have colored hair and want it to last as long as possible. But I am on a budget and do try to save money as much as I can. You have to purchase Wella from a salon type store mostly. So on that, it can cost a little more from a salon type store. So recently when the new Vidal Sassoon Pro hair care products care out, I said I would try them. I had tried VS in past years and it was good.  So when I recently bought VS to try I noticed that the formula and the smell and color and so on looked real similar to the Wella I had there also in the shower. I compared the two and also did a little checking on the web about the two products. Wella was a few years back bought out by Proctor &amp; Gamble (P&amp;G) and also VS is owned by P&amp;G. I noticed that many of the hair care products packaging looked similar with just different labels, size, and so on. I new in the past that some major companies do many times have the same product but just put it in a different bottle and market it differently. So I e-mailed customer service at P&amp;G to ask if this was the same formula and product just marketed differently. WOW was I surprised. They replied back by listing the ingredients in the two products and said that in most part it is the same except the Diamond Dust that is in Well for the shine. I was pleasantly surprised. The two, Wella and Vidal Sassoon Pro hair products, cost a lot different. Wella is only available by a salon store and VS can be purchased a lot cheaper at a mass merchant. Wella is 2x or more expensive then VS. I like Wella products don&#x27;t get me wrong but, If I can get almost the same stuff a lot cheaper, You know where I will shop.  Hope this little info I found out helps.  But you can purchase anything you like too, this is a free country.  Enjoy.</li>
    <li> THIS IS SHAMPOO FULL OF CHEMICAL WHICH DENGEROUS FO THE HEALTH &amp; IRRITATE SCALP. WILL RESEARCH NATURAL PRODUCT FOR BETTER QUILITY.</li>
    <li> Great formula for color-treated hair - helped keep my &amp;#34;enhanced&amp;#34; red locks looking gorgeous all the way up to my next color treatment!  I highly recommend!!</li>
    <li> This is a nice shampoo for colored hair. Love that I can get it without leaving my house! Nice shampoo</li>
    <li> Works very well and is a nice quality shampoo. My red stays vibrant much longer.  Will buy product again and soon.</li>
    <li> Good shampoo. Color faded-but looked good while using.</li>
    <li> I bought this shampoo at the recommendation of my brilliant hair stylist and absolutely love it. It smells terrific and makes my hair so soft and manageable...</li>
