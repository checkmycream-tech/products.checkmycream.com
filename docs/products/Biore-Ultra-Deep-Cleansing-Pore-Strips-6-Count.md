      <li>It&#x27;s amazing</li>
      <li>This product is amazing.</li>
      <li>kind of gets it out</li>
      <li>It brought some pimples to the surface, and I&#x27;m just going to take it as a good thing because I would be able to deal with them if they didn&#x27;t surface.</li>
      <li>I kind of like</li>
      <li>Amazing with the srtrip, my nose feels smooth and great.</li>
      <li>product, works effectively.</li>
      <li>These strips worked OKAY at best the first time I used them.</li>
      <li>Works pretty well, although I didn&#x27;t find it absolutely incredible.</li>
      <li>This new product is excellent.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure most people don&#x27;t notice them (my Indian skin hides them well), but I know they&#x27;re there!</li>
      <li>The first time I tried this product was in 1998, came in the welcome to the dorm goodybag at OSU.  </li>
      <li>I would love to see if they have strips like this made for chin or forehead.</li>
      <li>and I have been pleased with the result.  </li>
      <li>You can probably get more out just by squeezing your nose, but it helps to have these strips get some of the stuff out for you.</li>
      <li>Each time it pulls out more and more blackheads.</li>
      <li>on amazon. :)</li>
      <li>(many, many years ago)...</li>
      <li>Make sure to wash your face after to remove any residue.  </li>
      <li>Works ok to remove blackheads.</li>
      <li>They&#x27;re okay.</li>
      <li>I thought would work better.</li>
      <li>Make sure you wash your nose after you take it off, or it could get itchy too.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>They seem to stick better when your face is softer from a wash.</li>
      <li>Your skin will be much more pliable than after just washing it, kinda like trimming your nails.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Would recomend this item and will buy more myself in time.</li>
      <li>I use these regularly and find their effectiveness excellent.</li>
      <li>We love how this helps with cleaning out pores.  </li>
      <li>Never has looking at oily dirt been so satisfying.</li>
      <li>Make sure to remove all of your makeup before or during your shower.</li>
      <li>I have used these for about 10 years and love how it extracts the dirt and oil from from your skin.  </li>
      <li>I love this product.</li>
      <li>so make sure to do it just once a week or so...very satisfying to peel all the gunk out :)</li>
      <li>so they are just sitting on top of my skin now.</li>
      <li>and they definitely do a better job.  </li>
      <li>OK...</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not like it&#x27;ll remove ALL your blackheads, but it will remove many, and keep your skin looking clearer.</li>
      <li>Very powerful!  </li>
      <li>but this one is pretty much the best one out of them all.</li>
      <li>Use a warm bar of soap on your face so that it is completely clean and makeup</li>
      <li>and they work great too, easy peesy...plus much cheaper than Biore.</li>
      <li>I normally use the Walgreens brand nose strips and they work great.</li>
      <li>I think this is a pretty good product.</li>
      <li>the result is surprisingly bad!&lt;br /&gt;i always use it after a hot shower, when my pores are at its largest.&lt;br /&gt;i even tried using baking soda with water on my nose that everyone on the internet suggest.&lt;br /&gt;and</li>
      <li>, I know it says not for that long, but it works the best at that length of time.</li>
      <li>That did it-lots of clean pores!  </li>
      <li>addition, unlike the original strips, these strips contain tea tree oil, so you can feel a refreshing, cool tingle on your skin... and if you&#x27;ve ever used tea tree oil, it works wonders on your skin and works as an antiseptic, which is a nice plus.&lt;br</li>
      <li>The pores on my nose are gradually becoming smaller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used the other Biore strips, as well as those made by Boscia and I didn&#x27;t find either very impressive.</li>
      <li>Original strips works better.</li>
      <li>It was easy to use and easy to follow the directions.  </li>
      <li>Easy to use.</li>
      <li>I used these for the first time and while I was happy at how much gunk they got out, OUCH!</li>
      <li>The scent of the oils is a strong one, but invigorating nonetheless.  </li>
      <li>This product works wonders, but is awfully strong.</li>
      <li>I had heard good things about these, so I guess I had high expectations.</li>
      <li>I love how smooth and clean my nose feels after I use them.</li>
      <li>These cleansing strips are something I absolutely needed for my nose, and when I received the product - on time and intact - I was fairly eager to use them right away!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Did it clean my pores? YES! The major BUT......Peeling the strips off was a bit painful. I thought some of my skin was coming off with it.</li>
    <li> I used these for the first time and while I was happy at how much gunk they got out, OUCH! It was SUPER painful to pull off and I really started to worry that it was going to pull off my skin along with all the dirt. My eyes were tearing and my skin was bright red afterward. However, the redness went away fully and my skin looks much clearer, and my pores look smaller. No pain no gain, I guess? If I could give them 3.5 stars I would.</li>
    <li> Ehhhh....I honestly can&#x27;t tell much of a difference in the Ultra Deep pore cleansing strips and the Original Pore cleansing strips.  I didn&#x27;t notice these cleansing any deeper than the original.  That being said, every time I use pore cleansing strips, I definitely notice a few blackheads that come out on the strip.</li>
    <li> I am starting to wonder if pore strips actually work.  I used these as directed and the strip was full of stuff when i took it off my nose.  However, I didn&#x27;t really see a visual difference.</li>
    <li> The outside of my nose has been a problem area for me since junior high, as there was always an annoying amount of tiny black dots and little black hairs growing out of it. I&#x27;m sure most people don&#x27;t notice them (my Indian skin hides them well), but I know they&#x27;re there! Up until now, I&#x27;d handled them through daily washing and fingernail extraction (I&#x27;ve still got some scars from my early attempts...). Now that I&#x27;m doing better financially, I decided to \\&quot;splurge\\&quot; and \\&quot;treat myself\\&quot; to these strips. $15 for 6 strips sounds excessive, but I&#x27;m only really going to use them for big occasions, so I figured I&#x27;d try some before a Saturday event.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The directions are fairly easy: wash your face and pat dry, then sprinkle some water on your nose, dry your hands, and separate the strip from the plastic. Spread the smooth part across your nose, and gently rub it for a bit before waiting for around 15 minutes for it to dry. Then gently strip it off your nose from the edges inward.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s the only painful part of the process, as the strip ripped a lot of the hair off of my nostrils. I do have to admit though, that the results were obvious: a LOT of tiny black shards of hair (and other stuff) were left on the strip, and a much cleaner, healthier looking nose was the result. I had to wash my nose off again and then put a bit of aloe vera gel on it, but today (Saturday, after the event) it looks much healthier and fresher. The pores look a lot smoother, and the skin is softer to the touch!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why four stars? Well, it missed some of the blackheads, and a good amount of the hair is still there. For all the stinging pain of the process, I would&#x27;ve thought everything would have been taken off, but it&#x27;s still enough to make a noticeable difference.</li>
    <li> I used another Biore Pore Strip before. It was black color, only for nose and worked better than this one. I am not sure if the black color made me feel that (and that one was thicker than this) or it worked really better. In summary, it worked, but not best.</li>
    <li> Cool product. You put on wet and when it dries it pulls off like a mask. I tried one but ordered it for my near teen son to try out.</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE these! I hadn&#x27;t used these Biore strips since I was a freshman in college (many, many years ago)...and for some reason they aren&#x27;t all the rage anymore. I was relieved to have great results after using these.</li>
    <li> I ordered these strips from Amazon because there was a coupon and combined with the current price they were much cheaper than at my local stores. I haven&#x27;t used biore strips in some years, but I have been spending more time and money on my skin lately, and thought I would try them again.&lt;br /&gt;First of all, i don&#x27;t like the menthol and tea tree in them. These are very minty which kind of burns my sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;The other posts that say to use these after a shower are correct. Your skin will be much more pliable than after just washing it, kinda like trimming your nails.&lt;br /&gt;I have been using BHA, AHA and vitamin C regularly, so I think my pores are looking better, but the BHA really brings up blackheads so they are just sitting on top of my skin now. I thought they needed some help finally getting completely removed so I tried this and it helped.&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely suggest using a BHA liquid daily in addition to these. The BHA will bring all the gunk up, and then keep the pores clean after this treatment.&lt;br /&gt;I think they work, but I am not sure if they are as effective as they used to be. It didn&#x27;t pull out as much hard sebum as I remember, but I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s because my pores are better from the exfoliants I have been using, or if these are different now.&lt;br /&gt;Biores strips have torn my skin before, so I am super careful peeling these off now. I get these really wet, and then dab the strip with toilet paper after its on to suck up the extra water so they dry faster.Then I peel them very carefully before they are too too dry, just right when they get hard. I think leaving them on too long is not good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So minus one star for the menthol and minus one for them not working as I remember, and being possibly damaging, but still they are worth a try.</li>
    <li> Posting a review for something that removes blackheads seems so…I dunno...eeeooowww. Right? I mean, how does one describe the action of these things before getting to…eeeooowww?&lt;br /&gt;Let me try:&lt;br /&gt;I put one of these things on my nose, let it dry, then as I peeled it off, I examined the inner surface, and noticed… EEEOOOWWW!!! See what I mean??</li>
    <li> All I can say that (For Me) these worked wonders, I saw a big difference! Biore will always have my dollar for this product! Try it out!</li>
    <li> the ultra deep cleaning seemed to be more effective pulling the stuff out, the packaging is very similar to the deep cleaning ones, so just be careful to select the right one. I would love to see if they have strips like this made for chin or forehead.</li>
    <li> Works well at removing dirt. I am always amazed at how much dirt it seems to pull out even after i&#x27;ve exfoliated.</li>
    <li> I just recently started using these strips and so far they have removed some of the blackheads on my nose. The disappointing part was that the only way I could tell was the fact that I could see them on the strip. My nose really didn&#x27;t look much different at all.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m hoping that after I use all 8 strips that I&#x27;ll be able to notice a considerable difference.&lt;br /&gt;Crossing my fingers.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s certainly not an instant form of elimination(not that I really expected such a miracle).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Word of advice: It helps to put an extremely hot cloth over your nose to open your pores before you put on the strip. Makes a difference compared to just quickly wetting your nose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d say this product is worth a shot if you have the money. In my opinon 5 less blackheads are better than none.</li>
    <li> This is the only product that truly works for my son. He has trouble around and on his nose with black heads. He uses this as directed and I can see a difference. He&lt;br /&gt;loves this stuff. Can&#x27;t say it works on everyone but my son swears by it.</li>
    <li> Work well, better than regular ones.</li>
    <li> Not a fan at all.&lt;br /&gt;Didn&#x27;t do a damn thing.</li>
    <li> let me first off say that i had use biore strip before, purchased from local pharmacy stores.&lt;br /&gt;it is a difference packaging (with a cartoon girl/man on the box and words are written in japanese).&lt;br /&gt;those work excellent on my nose, and able to get rid of 90% of the black head &amp; white hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;since amazon is selling it for a even cheaper price, i decide to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;and the result is surprisingly bad!&lt;br /&gt;i always use it after a hot shower, when my pores are at its largest.&lt;br /&gt;i even tried using baking soda with water on my nose that everyone on the internet suggest.&lt;br /&gt;and every time i peel off the strip, about 15% of the blackheads are out, while the remaining are stuck in between my skin.&lt;br /&gt;so after i use the strip, i still need to manually scratch off the in between with my finger nail...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;since it is getting a good review here, i am not sure if i am the only one that&#x27;s having trouble with it.&lt;br /&gt;2 stars for it, and don&#x27;t get me wrong, i like biore strip, but just not this one.</li>
    <li> My blackheads are super stubborn.When I had the \\&quot;original\\&quot; biore strips, sebum, dirt, and blackhead rarely came out. If they did maybe 1 or 3. But this one, if you use after you steam and exfoliate dead skin cells, than it picks out 10~20. The regular ones, although it is cheap or contains more strips, this is very much more worth that the others.But the smell is disgusting. I think its the witch hazel. Also it is better, it doesn&#x27;t take out the whole mess and gunk in there so don&#x27;t hope that in one use, your blackhead problems will be gone.</li>
    <li> I received the package of cleansing strips and noticed the package felt light... I opened up the package and it was EMPTY.  Nothing was in it, no instructions, no product.</li>
    <li> I bought this only because it was on sale.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Holly cow!  I was blown away by what came out and stuck to the strip!  Makes me wonder if it was normal.  Hey!  If you buy this.  let me know if you were blown away too!</li>
    <li> ***ORIGINAL REVIEW:&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used the original pore strips and they do a decent job, but they aren&#x27;t amazing.  If you have a lot of small blackheads on your nose, the original ones really only pulled out one or two, and the rest were just a bunch of fine hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave these ultra pore strips a try and they definitely do a better job.  I had much more effective extraction of all those pesky tiny blackheads on my nose/tip of my nose.  I&#x27;ve tried masks, manual extraction, exfoliation and nothing would do a great job clearing all those dots.  After one use of these ultra strips, the tip of my nose looks MUCH clearer and the pores look noticeably smaller -- I was skeptical at first but I was really pleasantly surprised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition, unlike the original strips, these strips contain tea tree oil, so you can feel a refreshing, cool tingle on your skin... and if you&#x27;ve ever used tea tree oil, it works wonders on your skin and works as an antiseptic, which is a nice plus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***UPDATE, MAY 2011: I&#x27;ve been using these for about 2 years now, off and on, and noticed a couple things: if you use them following a hot shower, it makes a noticeable difference in the effectiveness, rather than after simply washing your face with warm water -- the skin is just a lot more receptive. Also, I love using them on other parts of my face. I cut one strip in half and use each half on my chin, forehead or the areas my nose doesn&#x27;t cover. I almost get better and more satisfying results on these areas and find it&#x27;s refreshing to attack other problem areas along my t-zone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, you can buy them at Target for about $5.50-$6.50 a box, which is usually cheaper than the Amazon price.</li>
    <li> I use these mainly on my nose and love the results. My pores as I&#x27;ve gotten older have gotten larger and that has resulted in more blackheads. These work best when your face is freshly washed in very warm water (shower or a good soaking when washing your face). They seem to stick better when your face is softer from a wash. My one issue using them is sometimes they stick too well. Once I actually took some skin off without realizing it. I learned quickly to rewet them if it is hard to get them off. This is the best product I&#x27;ve found for getting blackheads removed in quantity.</li>
    <li> There is little to say other than I can tell little or no results from using these strips. I&#x27;ve followed the instructions and reccomendations. I would not waste your money.</li>
    <li> works as expected and great price.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used the product 3 times in the past 2 weeks. Each time it pulls out more and more blackheads. The first time I used it, I was amazed at everything it removed. The pores on my nose are gradually becoming smaller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one downside is that it&#x27;s a bit uncomfortable to remove the strip. Imagine peeling off duct tape from your nose. But it&#x27;s worth it for the results.</li>
    <li> DID NOT WORK! Useless and a waste of money!</li>
    <li> Just be careful it can rip the skin off if you aren&#x27;t careful skin so fresh it bleeds lol</li>
    <li> I have HUGE pores with deep dirt. I found out I actually need to use a facial steamer, but this has done better than any other scrub or cleanser out there for me. I do notice that if I don&#x27;t use it for a week or so, my pores look worse, but if you have small pores with only little cleaning to do, I think you&#x27;ll like it.</li>
    <li> I use these about once every week or two and they take the blackheads out of my nose.. Only complaint i&#x27;d have is the strip should be about 1/2 inch wider so i&#x27;m not choosing between my upper bridge of nose and lower nose.. My nose isn&#x27;t large.. Other than that it&#x27;s awesome!</li>
    <li> eeeewwwwww dont look at the strip after youve peeled it off, so nasty cant believe that crap was in my skin!</li>
    <li> These pore strips work great to get those small blackheads (more like whitish) from your nose, it won&#x27;t get the big noticeable ones out (maybe 1 or 2), but at least it will clean the rest of the nose. Easy to use.</li>
    <li> Work about the same as other pore strips.</li>
    <li> It is useful as it described.</li>
    <li> These cleansing strips are something I absolutely needed for my nose, and when I received the product - on time and intact - I was fairly eager to use them right away! I wasn&#x27;t disappointed with them either. I read through some reviews before purchasing and tried what others recommended, putting a hot towel over my nose to open the pores and there has always been a significant difference each time I use it. The strip picks up more black heads and works so well, my nose area is less spotted and more clean. I highly recommend this product. When used regularly(I use it once a week) and correctly, it creates a great-looking nose. Very happy with my results and will be purchasing again!</li>
    <li> Expected this to work a lot better than it did. I have very fair skin and very small pores, and the strips only got out a few of the several blackheads on the sides of my nose. As for the top of my nose, where the pores are slightly bigger, the strips removed absolutely nothing. I followed the directions perfectly and was sadly disappointed!</li>
    <li> I have like a million tiny black heads all over my nose.  I had tried everything from masks, facials, extractions, etc.  And then I decided to give these strips a try, and they really do rip those darn things right off your nose (they even pull out the tiny hairs off my nose....LOL).  I love this stuff!</li>
    <li> Not sure if this works... or perhaps I&#x27;m using it wrong.. it didn&#x27;t help or clean my pores.</li>
    <li> Works ok to remove blackheads. Just be careful if it gets too hard, it will really pull your skin.</li>
    <li> I think this is a pretty good product. No you won&#x27;t see results after the first time you use it, obviously, but after doing it a couple times I did see some pretty good results. I would purchase this again.</li>
    <li> I have been using Biore nose strips for as long as they have been on the market.  This new product is excellent.  I use it all over my face once per week after a mud mask.  If you have black/white heads.  Get this product you will not be sorry.</li>
    <li> I was well pleases with the Biore product.  It did what it said it would do.  it pulled out all the dirt and grime out of my pores and they felt very clean and soft afterwards.  Thanks you</li>
    <li> I use these regularly and find their effectiveness excellent. They remove blackheads. Period. I don&#x27;t find the removal part painful if you do slowly. No allergic reactions and love it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used 3 of these now, and while two were great and did the job, the third somehow got adhesive all over my nose which I had to peel off! Might be user error though!</li>
    <li> Works great doesn&#x27;t get them all out but gets most of them out and this is the best one I&#x27;ve used yet</li>
    <li> I got a sample of this in the mail recently and decided to try it out. I left it on for 15 minutes as suggested. Didn&#x27;t hurt as much as I thought it would to peel off, but it left a lot of white gunk behind that I then had to wash off. Nothing came off onto the strip and my skin didn&#x27;t look or feel any differently than if I had yanked a band-aid off. Either my pores were already clear, or this product doesn&#x27;t work very well.</li>
    <li> I have always had an issue with blackheads, especially on my nose. Prior to this product, I tried every scrub, wash, or strip out on the market and had little to no change on my face. After buying this product, I was skeptical- I&#x27;ve tried similar products before! This strip is awesome. After washing my face with my face wash, I used the strip on my nose for about fifteen minutes. After I peeled the strip off of my face, I couldn&#x27;t believe it worked so well. I could actually see the blackheads on the strip and my nose was CLEAR! This product works wonders, but is awfully strong. I only use this product once a week so that my face doesn&#x27;t become severely over dried. With minimal use, this product really does work! A+</li>
    <li> First experience with this product.  Will let you know how it works once I have some time to devote to it.</li>
    <li> I use face cleansers and even right after shower and deep cleaning i put one of these and i cant believe how much more little blackheads left on my nose. These strips are only good for the nose and you need to follow the instructions and even after couple of days later you will notice the little small tiny heads stuck on the strips. Worth trying. But do not overkill yourself trying to have a smooth skin. everyone is different. These strips are a little expensive for their purpose and usage. If you dont wash up right after you use it than you will have a sticky nose. deep cleansing needs cleaning after usage.</li>
    <li> Not sure why I have never tried pore strips before, but bought a box on whim, and really like how they work.&lt;br /&gt;So for starters, I do have large pores on my nose, which I know are genetic and don&#x27;t expect over the counter products to cure me of.  I decided to try these to see what type of difference, if any, they would make.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To help out the product, I first cleansed my face as I always do, I then gave my face a 4 min steam bath to open up my pores and make gunk removal easier. I then applied strip as directed and waited. Once time was up, I began pulling gently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes they are strong hold, so you want to peel back gently, but it does great in lifting out all the gunk that gets stuck in your pores.&lt;br /&gt;after I finished, I applied toner, acne medicine, and moisturized as usual.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can definitely see myself using this product more often. The price is steep, so I think I will alternate with using the original versions with the ultra version. I think a maintenance plan of 2x  a week will work nicely, but I think key is steaming and/or exfoliating area before is key to get the most out of the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t think there was immediate visual difference to anyone besides myself, but maybe through time it will help shrink a bit</li>
    <li> Exactly as described. Excellent quality. Been using them for years and they leave my nose smooth.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t really work, maybe one or two blackheads. I looked online for the best way to do it but it still didn&#x27;t work out. It brought some pimples to the surface, and I&#x27;m just going to take it as a good thing because I would be able to deal with them if they didn&#x27;t surface.</li>
    <li> Ok. I normally use the Walgreens brand nose strips and they work great. I tried Biore nose strips like 10 years ago and never went back. They made my nose pink irritated after I used them. The Walgreens brand doesn&#x27;t do that to me. I was at Wal-Mart yesterday looking for generic nose strips and couldn&#x27;t find any, so I bought Biore thinking they might have gotten better. I cleaned my nose and put on the strip. My nose started feeling minty immediately....then a few minutes later it feels almost burning. Now it is going up my nose. I DON&#x27;T NEED MINTY ON MY NOSE!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I have the strip on as I am typing this review. I hate you Biore...with LOVE! Seems to take longer to dry too then the walgreens brand. I even took a blow dryer to it and it is still not dry. I remember this now about Biore...they did take long to dry or they would dry uneven and I would peel them too early. Walgreens brand is super fast drying and they work great too, easy peesy...plus much cheaper than Biore. OK...I just peeled it off. It tore during the peeling. It pulled out the junk from my pores, but I really it isn&#x27;t any better or ULTRA. My nose feels good though and not irritated.</li>
    <li> I had heard good things about these, so I guess I had high expectations. My pores aren&#x27;t as bad as some, but I&#x27;ve used these twice and they still don&#x27;t seem to be doing the trick for me. The first time I followed package instructions, and they did get some of the stuff off the side of my nose, but not the top. The second time I used them directly after a shower and they did basically nothing, considering they had taken a lot of the things off the sides the first time. From what I had heard I was hoping they would be the Holy Grail of pore products, but I guess I&#x27;ll have to keep looking.</li>
    <li> This is a product that might work well for some but after my use it simply did not remove by blackheads from my nose. The product was applied to a wet nose, as directions state, and let on until it was a firm papermache feel. It was pull off slowly at a slight angle (which it does feel a bit weird pulling off) and removed some areas of concern; however, a majority still remained. The nose was slight pink after. On the bright side though is after the product use, it was easier to self remove the blackheads with light pressure on the nose, but the strip alone simply did not work the magic. Maybe next time I will try two strips back to back to see if that helps but that makes it even more expensive then it already is.</li>
    <li> Who doesn&#x27;t like using pore strips? They are a true guilty pleasure. I love how smooth and clean my nose feels after I use them. I&#x27;ve read that they make your pores bigger, but I really find this to be conjecture. I will continue to use them!</li>
    <li> I love this product. While most imitation brands are basically the same (i.e. Walgreens), Biore is the way to go because I find it to be the most effective. This is the best way to prepare your face for pore strips and the results are great:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) Take a hot, steamy shower. Make sure to remove all of your makeup before or during your shower. Use a warm bar of soap on your face so that it is completely clean and makeup free.&lt;br /&gt;2) (Skip this step if you have extremely sensitive or damaged skin.) After the shower, combine a small amount of baking soda with water. It should have that \\&quot;wet sand\\&quot; feel. Use this to exfoliate your skin and clean your pores. Do NOT scrub it on your skin. Gently rub this on your face in circular motions for about 30 seconds. Be sure to fully rinse the baking soda off of your face with cold water. I usually stand over the sink and gently rub it off while I splash the cold water onto my face.&lt;br /&gt;3) When you have completely rinsed off the baking soda, make sure your face is still fairly wet from the cold water and place the pore strips on. Keep them on until they are stiff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This works for me every time. It&#x27;s pretty amazing how much the pore strips pick up. I do this about once every week or two. I&#x27;d love to hear if it works for you, so please let me know!</li>
    <li> These SERIOUSLY clean your pores, they are all I use now.&lt;br /&gt;Simply dampen your nose, don&#x27;t soak it (or it won&#x27;t stick as well).&lt;br /&gt;Place it on, after dampening, and leave it on for 10 to 15 minutes, I know it says not for that long, but it works the best at that length of time. After doing so, take it off at the same time from each side of your nose, and watch the towers of grossness leave your face. It will feel extremely smooth after. Love it. Make sure you wash your nose after you take it off, or it could get itchy too.&lt;br /&gt;Again, if you don&#x27;t do it just right, it doesn&#x27;t stick how you want.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried these and the regular non-&#x27;ultra&#x27; strips, and these are a better product by far. It actually pulls the dirt out of my pores. My skin still isn&#x27;t perfect but I do like these quite a bit. The witch hazel could be irritating to some people with sensitive skin, however.</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re okay. The reason I give three stars is that they only get about half the pores on my nose.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing.</li>
    <li> These strips worked OKAY at best the first time I used them. It got a pretty decent amount of blackheads out. After using them the first time though I still noticed a lot of blackheads left behind so I went for a second application and had no success. This won&#x27;t solve the blackhead problem, but will take a few out. I don&#x27;t know about anyone else but I&#x27;m not looking to take a few out, I&#x27;m looking to eliminate the problem altogether, so I will be looking at other options now.</li>
    <li> These pore cleansers don&#x27;t work. Period. I started using them in middle school about once a month, and they were fantastic. They&#x27;ve changed so drastically since. They remove nothing from my nose, take 20 minutes to &amp;#34;harden,&amp;#34; and they don&#x27;t even harden anymore. They use to become a paper mache consistency in just a couple minutes, leaving no residue. Now, they take for ever to dry, and are flimsy, leaving sticky residue on your skin, and of course, DON&#x27;T CLEAN YOUR PORES. Extremely disappointed.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d suggest that you take my advice and try a different brand (which is what I&#x27;m going to do now too) because these strips don&#x27;t work. I&#x27;ve used all 6 and there&#x27;s no difference. They don&#x27;t get rid of blackheads at all. What a waste. I&#x27;m extremely dissatisfied and disappointed with this product.</li>
    <li> I have ordered these over and over and over! I must have them and use them twice to three times a week. Work well... Just let them dry all the way for 15 minutes.</li>
    <li> These work really well to remove some of the gunk from your pores. It&#x27;s really gross when you take it off, which proves its effectiveness. Whatever you see on the strip isn&#x27;t on your nose anymore!</li>
    <li> Not that much of cleaning even after scrubbing</li>
    <li> These things have to be the best thing that&#x27;s happened to my face in a lot time! its the best way to get dirt out of pores, and customer service by biroe is great! once I bought strips that had missing one inside the box and they replaced them. :) the best! using them weekly I no longer have blackheads on my nose or chin, I only need to use them once a month now</li>
    <li> They work and definitely take the junk out.</li>
    <li> I use it once a week to get a nice deep cleaning in my pores. I took off one star because it does not get *everything* out, I know that, but I kind of expected more to come out. You can probably get more out just by squeezing your nose, but it helps to have these strips get some of the stuff out for you. These are kind of expensive. I recommend it for if you REALLY need all the help you can get for clearing your pores. If you have pretty clean pores, no need for these.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s amazing how well it works, really. It&#x27;s completely pain-free, something I didn&#x27;t expect. It&#x27;s literally like ripping scotch tape off your face. Afterward you can see all the little tiny blackheads it pulls out. This product is something I already recommended to other friends, and I would buy again, but I don&#x27;t really need to... It already freed up all my blackheads after 3 strips! It does take more than one strip for most people, and you can only put it on once every three days however.</li>
    <li> this is ok but nothing great. i dont really have a lot of black heads on my nose. my pores fill with stuff on my nose and thsi kind of gets it out but like i said, nothing great</li>
    <li> took a star away because they are expensive for what they are, but i love them and buy them when i can. they work well when you steam your face beforehand, especially if you use mario badescu&#x27;s silver powder before. awesomeness.</li>
    <li> These strips work for me about 4 out of 5 times. Sometimes they just don&#x27;t adhere right or dry right or whatever, and not much gets pulled out. Then it&#x27;s a waste. I&#x27;ve been using them for years and no matter how much I practice, there is a still a chance that they won&#x27;t apply right and won&#x27;t work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When they do work, they&#x27;re wonderful! I love seeing all the gunk that comes out of my pores that sometimes I go too long without tending. It&#x27;s like looking at a little mini-city of gunk. If you use the warming cleanser, you can reduce the frequency of these strips. But I&#x27;d still always have these around. Remember these if you know you have close-up pictures coming up and need to un-clog quickly.</li>
    <li> these are awesome you can actually see them pull all that junk out of your pores</li>
    <li> I tend to have dry skin, and have never had problems with acne or anything.  But even so, every so often I notice that the pores on my nose are a little plugged.  (Gross).  I bought this box of strips, which arrived quickly.  One strip ripped the junk right from my pores.  I kind of like that you can see right on the strip what came out, so you know that it did the job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I definitely recommend.  Just make sure to follow the directions:  your nose needs to be very wet when you apply the strip, and then you need to wait about 10 minutes or so, to make sure the strip has completely dried.  Ripping it off is painful, but worth it.</li>
    <li> It is just okey. I thought would work better. The cleaning is not as deeper as it states, but still works</li>
    <li> Definitely not as great as I thought they&#x27;d be, they really didn&#x27;t get a lot of gunk out of my pores at all like I was hoping, but I wouldn&#x27;t say it was a total waste. They definitely are kinda fun, but I would only recommend if you have very big blackheads.</li>
    <li> I got an Assassin&#x27;s Creed 3 Beta Key from [...]&lt;br /&gt;Nice product, works effectively. I use them twice a week, and I have seen an unbelievable disappearance of my whiteheads.</li>
    <li> Original strips works better.</li>
    <li> Whoever invented this product deserves a big fat check and early retirement.  I&#x27;ve been using this product for over a decade and it works great.  The &amp;#34;Ultra&amp;#34; version is noticeably better and more effective than the normal version, so it&#x27;s worth the added cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best time to use this is right when you get out of a hot shower and your face is wet and there is a lot of humidity around.  The strip clings to the skin very nicely and is dry within 15 minutes.  You&#x27;ll need to smooth out the strip a couple of times during its drying period as it does like to form pleats.</li>
    <li> I have had terrible blackheads on my nose for a few years now.  So I decided to try these and I have been pleased with the result.  The scent of the oils is a strong one, but invigorating nonetheless.  I don&#x27;t really see a lot of dirt or anything like that when I pull the strip off, but my nose has been clearing up so they do work.  I plan on continuing with these since I haven&#x27;t had luck with anything else and these do clear up my nose.</li>
    <li> The product does not pull all the black heads and even after using 2-3 strips did not get desired results..</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used the other Biore strips, as well as those made by Boscia and I didn&#x27;t find either very impressive. This time, I took a hot shower, used an exfoliating mask, then applied one of these. That did it-lots of clean pores!  These get rid of more blackheads than a facial.</li>
    <li> Maybe my pores are super deep and/or impossible... but it seems like none of these pore strips (ultra deep or regular) have ever worked for me. They only get a couple blackheads out and the rest stay put. I have more success painstakingly squeezing my pores on my nose, which sucks... so it doesn&#x27;t happen. I wish there were something guaranteed to work for anyone! Ugh.</li>
    <li> Great pore strip! It pulls all the dirt and sebum out of your nose and then some! very strong for my sensitive skin but I don&#x27;t seem to mind. I tend to cut these up and use them on other places on my face where I get black heads. I have pretty clear skin but these still work wonders! Will definitely be repurchasing.</li>
    <li> I read all the reviews on amazon and decided to give the ultra deep cleansing pore strips a try...The instructions were simple enough to follow, and I allowed the strip to dry for 10 minutes (or till it becomes stiff, whichever is earlier)...then gently peeled it off from the outside in...And I am not kidding but it took off every single blackhead! ...I have tried removing them using home remedies but they never worked....&lt;br /&gt;Just some pointers would be to use it after a hot shower, not to pull the strip off too hard and to not let the strip dry for too long (specially important if you have sensitive skin)...I used ice to close the pores afterwards, and then applied a mild moisturizer which has antiseptic...</li>
    <li> These strips are so harsh that they rip your skin off and do not pull out the gunk.&lt;br /&gt;They&#x27;re painful to remove.&lt;br /&gt;I will only purchase the regular ones from now on.</li>
    <li> These work well. Not a 100% solution to clean pores on my nose, but they remove a fair amount of gunk and work well within a regular cleansing routine.</li>
    <li> Have waited a decade to try this.  Super excited, but it let me down.  Maybe I already have super clean pores since I use a retinal product, but this barely pulled anything out of them.  It&#x27;s so strong/sticky yet seemingly useless that I am not sure I even want to use the remaining strips.  I&#x27;m afraid it might do more harm than good. Will try once more before final verdict, but so far, unimpressed.</li>
    <li> I used these years ago when they first came out and they did get the blackheads off my nose.  I don&#x27;t have many but one is to much for me.</li>
    <li> These are exactly the same boxes I used to find at the store. You wet your nose, dry your hands, apply the strip, and let it dry for about ten minutes. Works fairly well. It&#x27;s not like it&#x27;ll remove ALL your blackheads, but it will remove many, and keep your skin looking clearer.</li>
    <li> This item is great. I have been using it for over 5&lt;br /&gt;Yrs and I have nothing negative to say about it. Great purchase and&lt;br /&gt;Price on amazon. :)</li>
    <li> We love how this helps with cleaning out pores.  Use it all the time.</li>
    <li> I do like these, although I feel that they do not remove blackheads as well as I feel they should. Maybe it is because I use it too often? My boyfriend did try it for the first time and had better results. All in all, I will keep using them being that I feel like other options are limited.</li>
    <li> These simply work.  Enough said.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used these once.  It was easy to use and easy to follow the directions.  I would not buy these again.  They don&#x27;t seem to do much besides dry your skin out.  There was a bit of dirt that showed up, but overall I didn&#x27;t like this product.</li>
    <li> I have only used the strips twice, but will keep at it.  I read lots of reviews, so I made sure the site was wet.  On the first try, the strip sucked up all the water and fell off.  I found out it was a good idea to also wet the strip.  I got some dirt out, but not the ribbon of dirt as described in the reviews.  I will keep at it, but I only have one blackhead on my neck to work on.</li>
    <li> they did take all that nasty stuff and my nose looked more clear and clean, so I was happy, I just wish they were more cheaper, still clear face and cleaner is better.</li>
    <li> Works pretty well, although I didn&#x27;t find it absolutely incredible. It was certainly worth the price, and I&#x27;ll certainly buy more soon.</li>
    <li> The first time I tried this product was in 1998, came in the welcome to the dorm goodybag at OSU.  Do I use it all the time [no], but for emergencies it is great.  They say not to use it on blemishes, but I use it for emergency \\&quot;white-head on the nose\\&quot; removal surgery.  It works great.  The blackheads come off on the strip as well as one gigantic white-head plug.  What usually follows is a little oozing of pus, but by the next day, your nose is saved, and the chicks won&#x27;t shun you like a leper.  But as far as acne treatment goes, this stuff is expensive, and honestly not worth using every three days (unless of course you are a girl).</li>
    <li> Ok so they do what they are supposed to unfortunately I get pimple in a different part of my face after I use these in a few days.  Its not a coincidence, I don&#x27;t get pimples, and I use these not often because of it.  But every single time I use it, a pimple comes out.  I do like seeing blackheads out of my nose but don&#x27;t like the pimples.</li>
    <li> I like to use these like once a month and for what I&#x27;m looking for they&#x27;re great. . . .</li>
    <li> pulls the blackheads efficiently.</li>
    <li> I put one on right out of the shower and leave it in for about 15 minutes like the directions suggests and when I did remove it, it gives little to no results. I can clearly see that I do still have blackheads, maybe not the right one for me. I tried it again 2 weeks later same results sadly.</li>
    <li> Very powerful!  Does the job for me!</li>
    <li> My skin looks no different before and after using this...even though seems like it&#x27;s removing something! was quite useless for me...</li>
    <li> Gets the job done! Rough on your nose so make sure to do it just once a week or so...very satisfying to peel all the gunk out :)</li>
    <li> The price is kinda high for these, but they&#x27;re almost worth it. You can get the discount non name brand ones and they work just as well, but I&#x27;ve always liked these better!</li>
    <li> I was looking forward to using this product because I have large irritating blackheads where my nose meets the rest of my face and couldn&#x27;t pop them myself. This product didn&#x27;t remove anything at all and was a complete disappointment and waste of money.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve bene trying to find a magic black head remover for years, to avoid the urge of popping them with my fingers.  These pore strips do work, but I would not go so far as to call them magical.  They will pull out some, but not all; and sometimes they&#x27;ll barely pull out anything.  Although it feels good knowing that some were removed, these strips definitely wouldn&#x27;t make a noticeable difference if someone looked at my face.  Better than other blackhead removers, but not magical.</li>
    <li> Arrived intact and on time. Works as indicated. Would buy again.</li>
    <li> They are good. However be careful if your skin is sensitive, you will get very dry, so be sure to have some moisturizer to put on.</li>
    <li> Not any visible result after regular usage. Didn&#x27;t work for my nose&#x27;s black heads at all. Won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
    <li> they do clean your pores.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using these strips for awhile and have used other brands but this one is pretty much the best one out of them all. The thing I dont like about it is that it leaves a residue on my nose after I peel it off so I would have to go wash it off and sometimes when I look at my nose after, I feel like it didn&#x27;t grab as much as I would have wanted it to. The strips are still super effective and pulling out blackheads and will always be my go to strips, I just wish that it was a little less pricier and I always try to restock when the price drops.</li>
    <li> Maybe there is something wrong from the package i got or they are all like this But this doesn&#x27;t seem to unclog my pores at all. The sticky stuff just peels onto my nose after it dries.</li>
    <li> These used to work really, really well. I&#x27;m not sure what changed. Now they&#x27;re expensive pieces of paper mâch&amp;eacute; for your face.</li>
    <li> Nothing to complain about, they work great. Just be sue to use these in moderation as they can enlarge your pores!</li>
    <li> annndddddd i&#x27;m freaked...this is in my nose!?!?!</li>
    <li> I use these every week or so, amazing (and disgusting) how much stuff this pulls out.</li>
    <li> Works well. Amazing with the srtrip, my nose feels smooth and great.</li>
    <li> Never has looking at oily dirt been so satisfying. I&#x27;ve been using these for years. Nothing beats the Ultra.&lt;br /&gt;Amazon price is better than Walmart - but STILL I wish they were a little cheaper.</li>
    <li> They did pull out some of the stuff from my pores but i will need to do it a few times to clear them all. Would recomend this item and will buy more myself in time.</li>
    <li> These strip definitely got something out of my nose. I followed the directions carefully, removal stung a but, I will be dabbing a little water on for removal from now on but my strip was covered with &#x27;gunk&#x27;. It did nothing for the uneven texture on my nose but my skin in the area was clear and not oily when I was done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think I like my new mask more for regular maintenance, but I will save this for if my nose starts to get shiny or needs a deeper clean.</li>
    <li> I have black heads... that I have had for my whole life. I can squeeze them out one at a time and then scrub very hard yet no matter how hard I try they come back, I thought this was a god send. once I tried it.. I found out otherwise as it doesnt do anything I have tried doing it after a shower, tried doing it before, tried not washing, tried washing. I have tried EVERYTHING and I have to do it the ol fashion way.</li>
    <li> It does a good job removing oil and dirt, stuff like that.</li>
    <li> I have used these for about 10 years and love how it extracts the dirt and oil from from your skin.  Soak your face in the hottest water you can.  Immediately apply the Biore strip.  Wait until it feels completely dry and then slowly peel away the things you don&#x27;t want left in your skin.  Make sure to wash your face after to remove any residue.  Your skin will feel and look great.</li>
    <li> I love this when you use is it pulls out so much stuff out of your pores and leaves them feeling so clean</li>
