    <li> it doesn&#x27;t work, a waste of money.</li>
    <li> I use this to fight pain in my shoulders and hips.  It works surprisingly well for that purpose, though &amp;#34;Oxi-Cell&amp;#34; works a bit better at only FIVE times the price.  [How can a little 2.0 oz. dab of skin cream possible cost so much??]  The only other thing I know about Glutithione is that my MD says that you should always use the cream version not the pills to be taken internally.  According to him your stomach acid will destory the glutithione in the pills before they can get into your system to do any good.</li>
    <li> Amazing product,it&#x27;s really work and fast shipping!!i love it..</li>
    <li> NO DIFFERENCE IN SKIN LIGHTHENING</li>
    <li> I tried to like this but it broke me out. It also absorbs into your skin really fast as in you don;t really have time to blend it well. You have to work quickly. You have to use alot as well.</li>
    <li> Takes the pain away and it smells lovely.</li>
    <li> delivered on time however I am using the product but haven&#x27;t noticed any changes as yet</li>
    <li> Not to my expectations.  I do not see any difference in my skin with this cream.</li>
    <li> Awesome stuff.  Ordering my next jar this week. Why purchase expensive creams when this does the job over and above others</li>
    <li> It was exactly what i expected, on time and at a good price...</li>
    <li> Prodct received in a timely fashion will update when product is used. I am hoping this product will help even my sun damaged skin.</li>
    <li> I have been using for 2months..... i dont see much change... what was it suppose to do again? .... i still use it.. because I bought and paid for it... I use it once a day at night.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for whitening but, I saw no noticeable difference. It&#x27;s more like just a simple cream.</li>
    <li> Excellent product that works.</li>
    <li> This product is a waste of my money.Have been using this product for one week now . My skin is the same no changes to the dark spots on my face. I had the misguided concept that Since this product is being sold by Amazon it has to be good. Very disappointed .</li>
    <li> THE BODY&#x27;S PREMIER WATCHDOG IN A CREAM, THANKYOU</li>
    <li> Maybe I need more patience but after 1 jar and no result, I gave up.</li>
    <li> I am not sure if it really lightens pigmentation as Star of David is supposed to, but it didn&#x27;t clog my pores and its moisturizing.</li>
    <li> This product helps with the bruises and blood spots I get on my arms from facilities. It also helps with the severe bruising I have from a fall.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for 2 weeks, morning and night.  I have noticed my skin does look better overall. My skin feels softer and has helped to lighten my dark spots.</li>
    <li> Great product no paraben</li>
    <li> L-Glutathione Cream with Setria 2 fl oz, It has been very helpful to my dried skin, I love it.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you!</li>
    <li> Garbage not worth the money &amp; effort it was a waste of my money.</li>
    <li> Lessens pain when applied topically. Also, clear up the skin. I purchased anothe product for over a hundred dollars, returned it and bought this well priced product. Works.</li>
    <li> This cream is incredible and so affordable!  My skin glows and is so much smoother.  My wrinkles are fading away as well.  I was using a very expensive cream which created small bumps on my cheeks, but the Swanson&#x27;s L-Glutathione Cream is smoothing them out nicely.  Another wonderful Swanson product  :-)</li>
    <li> very please with the consistency, but as for the results i need more time. I useit mostly for strech marks to see if it would help on that.</li>
    <li> I have been using this cream for just a week now and I can see the result already.. I felt like it stretching my face..LOL! I also have one big pimple on my forehead and I think this cream removed it coz I applied it twice a day, (after taking a bath and after washing my face at night). Looking forward to finish the whole cream and see the result..</li>
    <li> Glutathione is said to have some amazing health benefits.  I don&#x27;t know about that but the cream feels good on my face and it has a fresh scent.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff.  I was having some issues with hormonal acne after my third child and this not only cleared it up, but it is also rapidly fading the marks let behind by previous breakouts.  My skin feels very soft, and hydrated after using, but doesn&#x27;t get oily.</li>
    <li> Another great antioxidant except this is a cream you can apply to your wrist area instead of taking in a pill form. Glutithion eats up all your bad free radicals. Put it on every single day and a tad bit does go a long way. Summer V</li>
    <li> This is a fabulous Creme kicking in the natural nutrients your skin needs.  While I was staying at a hospital  the young  nurses would hit on me and the ones my age would unknowingly  start talking about,  &amp;#34;Back in my day.&amp;#34;  I feel I haven&#x27;t already mentioned it,  I&#x27;d keep this product on my personal shopping list.  It&#x27;s great!</li>
    <li> have been using for 6 weeks and do not noticed any different on my skinn</li>
    <li> Is a nice cream. Very good moisturizer.</li>
