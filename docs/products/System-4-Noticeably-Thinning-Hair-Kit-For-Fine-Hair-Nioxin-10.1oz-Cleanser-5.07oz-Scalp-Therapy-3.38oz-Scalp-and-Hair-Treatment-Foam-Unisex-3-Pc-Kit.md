      <li>Good seller.</li>
      <li>Good product.  </li>
      <li>, it gets better!</li>
      <li>fast and the product is awesome.</li>
      <li>I was under a great deal if stress which affected my hair and Nioxin System 4 has helped tremendously.</li>
      <li>My hair is very fine to start with and is thinning as well.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using these products for over 10 years and love them.</li>
      <li>I wouldn&#x27;t say that it&#x27;s dramatically better</li>
      <li>but it does seem better.</li>
      <li>I truly believe it causes more hair to shed.</li>
      <li>This product does give your hair more body.  </li>
      <li>About 2 months ago, I began to notice a clump of hair in the drain after showering and even more as I combed my hair out.  </li>
      <li>However, I would not recommend this product to anyone unless you want to lose more hair.</li>
      <li>love this stuff</li>
      <li>I love love love this system and can tell a difference.  </li>
      <li>I love the way it feels on my hair.</li>
      <li>But I found that I like the stuff from Sally&#x27;s better.  </li>
      <li>Worked pretty good.  </li>
      <li>It has a nice smell and you really don&#x27;t need to much to really get a good suds.  </li>
      <li>plus, since I started using this product I have lost huge amounts of hair and that was not the case before I started using this.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t see any significant improvement and it stripped my color away.</li>
      <li>The shampoo is ok and pretty moisturizing but the conditioner leaves a lot to be desired.</li>
      <li>I do take care to massage and clean the scalp rather than just the hair.  </li>
      <li>I love the gentle tingle on my scalp.</li>
      <li>said, \\&quot;Then there must be new growth.\\&quot; :-)</li>
      <li>So far it is doing more damage</li>
      <li>I can say this, I do not have very much hair falling out in my brush anymore.</li>
      <li>This product made me lose more hair, left my hair oily, and greasy looking.</li>
      <li>Maybe I bought the wrong # for my hair condition but the #4 works best for my thinning hair.  </li>
      <li>The leave in treatment makes my hair very brittle and sticky</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t really see any improvement in my hair since using it.  </li>
      <li>This stuff really works.  </li>
      <li>I will finish using the shampoo, which seems to be gentle, but will not order this product again.</li>
      <li>My hair is much softer too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Other products, are OK,</li>
      <li>Product  above expectations My hair stopped falling out in clumps after the first use I still have a bit of hair loss but nothing like what was happening .</li>
      <li>but my very thinning hair looks much fuller than it has in a long time.  </li>
      <li>Will not waste the money on it again.</li>
      <li>My hair is completely back to normal.</li>
      <li>it is kind of expensive and can be very costly if you use it for problem hair due to the frequency of having to use it.</li>
      <li>Haven&#x27;t used long enough to know about hair growth yet, but I would definitely recommend for fine, limp hair.</li>
      <li>I still have to use a good conditioner because when I use just the products contained in this kit, my hair is very difficult to comb out.</li>
      <li>It seems to improve fine, thin, colored, and aging hair.  </li>
      <li>I definitely recommend these products to anyone with fine, thin hair.</li>

<li> Not exactly what I expected didn&#x27;t really see any noticeable growth.</li>
<li> You can even feel the product working not only during use but also long after.  </li>
<li> The size is smaller than I expected.</li>
<li> Says it needs to be used for 30 days and haven&#x27;t  used it that long yet.  </li>
<li> I take a break, because your hair will get dry</li>
<li> Does seem to dry out the scalp and creates itching.</li>

<li> Shampoo and conditioner made my hair so dry that I stopped using it after a few times:(</li>
<li> No good.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I can say this, I do not have very much hair falling out in my brush anymore. It seems that less hair is falling out.. That is a big plus for me..</li>
    <li> Worked pretty good.  But I found that I like the stuff from Sally&#x27;s better.  I believe it is their brand.</li>
    <li> Product  above expectations My hair stopped falling out in clumps after the first use I still have a bit of hair loss but nothing like what was happening . love this stuff</li>
    <li> I did NOT think I was shedding any hair. I DO have silky, baby-fine hair, that has been processed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried this kit, out of curiosity. I will never, ever, go back! My hair instantly took on a shine and condition that it never had, before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And, it gets better! After using the kit for six weeks, the women who cuts my hair asked whether I had tried to cut my hair, myself, since I had seen her. I answered in the negative.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She said, \\&quot;Then there must be new growth.\\&quot; :-)</li>
    <li> Excellet duality of the product.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t really see any improvement in my hair since using it.  Will not waste the money on it again.</li>
    <li> Says it needs to be used for 30 days and haven&#x27;t  used it that long yet.  Does seem to dry out the scalp and creates itching.</li>
    <li> Used the system.  Didn&#x27;t do a thing for my thinning hair.</li>
    <li> No good. Save your money, and go to a dermatologist.</li>
    <li> It seems to improve fine, thin, colored, and aging hair.  I wouldn&#x27;t say that it&#x27;s dramatically better but it does seem better.</li>
    <li> Was recommended by a friend - I am experiencing age/medical related hair thinning.  Not too bad but seems to have slowed it down.  It has a nice smell and you really don&#x27;t need to much to really get a good suds.  I do take care to massage and clean the scalp rather than just the hair.  Other products, are OK,</li>
    <li> Good product.  Good seller.</li>
    <li> My hair is very fine to start with and is thinning as well.  Theses products make my hair look thicker.</li>
    <li> i take a medication that thins the hair.  I started using nioxin about six months ago.  My stylist and i definitely see a difference.</li>
    <li> This stuff really works.  My hair appears fuller.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t see any significant improvement and it stripped my color away. It smells great and I like the sun-protection tho</li>
    <li> Works great, smells like peppermint</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t notice any difference in hair thickness, wast of money in my opinion.</li>
    <li> About 2 months ago, I began to notice a clump of hair in the drain after showering and even more as I combed my hair out.  My hair has been noticeably thinning.  My dermatologist and hair stylist suggested I try Nioxin.  I ordered this kit and have been using it for almost 2 weeks and the shedding has definitely decreased during this time.  I still have to use a good conditioner because when I use just the products contained in this kit, my hair is very difficult to comb out. I will stick with it and hopefully the good results will continue.</li>
    <li> It does not work like it used to. I think the formula might have been changed.</li>
    <li> Just what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> This is a great product for thinning hair. I was under a great deal if stress which affected my hair and Nioxin System 4 has helped tremendously. I also used Biotin and RF 80 by Furterer which can also be found on Amazon. My hair is completely back to normal.</li>
    <li> This product does give your hair more body.  I only use the shampoo and leave in scalp treatment.  Haven&#x27;t used long enough to know about hair growth yet, but I would definitely recommend for fine, limp hair.</li>
    <li> It works!!! within 2 weeks, using twice a week I had results.&lt;br /&gt;Then I take a break, because your hair will get dry&lt;br /&gt;I use Joico shampoo and conditioner to restore moisture, it also works wonders</li>
    <li> Not exactly what I expected didn&#x27;t really see any noticeable growth. Breakage slowed down some..I guess I need to find one for hair growth promotion.</li>
    <li> I love love love this system and can tell a difference.  I&#x27;m not mounded up with hair or anything, but it does feel thicker and that means a lot to me.  I&#x27;m on my 2nd batch now and will continue to purchase and use this system.</li>
    <li> As someone who already has thinning hair I was hoping for a product to help hide this and help my hair appear fuller. This product made me lose more hair, left my hair oily, and greasy looking. I used this product as it was directed and did not fair well. I used this product until it was gone, because I hated to spend the money just to throw it out. However, I would not recommend this product to anyone unless you want to lose more hair.</li>
    <li> fast and the product is awesome. I love the way it feels on my hair. I love the gentle tingle on my scalp.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using these products for over 10 years and love them. I definitely recommend these products to anyone with fine, thin hair.</li>
    <li> The size is smaller than I expected.</li>
    <li> I have only had the product for 24 hours but I am already impressed.  Not sure if it&#x27;s also because I used the Nioxin Dermabrasion treatment but my very thinning hair looks much fuller than it has in a long time.  I&#x27;ve bought the Nioxin system before several years ago although was not impressed then.  Maybe I bought the wrong # for my hair condition but the #4 works best for my thinning hair.  You can even feel the product working not only during use but also long after.  It is truly like a facial except for your scalp.  My hair is much softer too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am giving it a 4 instead of a 5 because 1) I&#x27;ve only had it 24 hours and 2) it is kind of expensive and can be very costly if you use it for problem hair due to the frequency of having to use it.</li>
    <li> Does not work. I truly believe it causes more hair to shed. I was so disappointed with it. Shampoo and conditioner made my hair so dry that I stopped using it after a few times:(</li>
    <li> The shampoo is ok and pretty moisturizing but the conditioner leaves a lot to be desired. I do have color treated hair and this conditioner leaves my hair drier than ever.......plus, since I started using this product I have lost huge amounts of hair and that was not the case before I started using this. The leave in treatment makes my hair very brittle and sticky-like so I stopped using that and the conditioner. I will finish using the shampoo, which seems to be gentle, but will not order this product again. So far it is doing more damage and I cant afford to lose anymore hair.</li>
