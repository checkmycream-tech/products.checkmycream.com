      <li>product smells great and cleans my hair nicely.</li>
      <li>They feel and smell like good shampoo, not just a pasty chemical wash to rid your scalp of flakes like it used to be.</li>
      <li>Soo I was in search for something that was good with oily hair I googled and found that citrus get rid of or soaks up oils which lead me to head and shoulders</li>
      <li>My hair is also more flowing now not so stuck to my head!</li>

      <li>As an added bonus, I find the smell refreshing and not at all overwhelming</li>

      <li>so I need to wash it more often</li>
      <li>Any more scent</li>
      <li>He says it does control his dandruff, and he likes the refreshing feeling the citrus leaves on his scalp.</li>
      <li>This is now my favorite version of Head &amp; Shoulders shampoo.</li>
      <li>scent is okay.</li>
      <li>I ordered it for him through Amazon Vine, and now it&#x27;s his favorite H &amp; S product.</li>
      <li>The consistency, lather and scent make it enjoyable to use.</li>
      <li>This strips most (if not all)</li>
      <li>and I believe will perform better with continued use.</li>
      <li>My scalp seems to stay better hydrated during the day with no itching and no flakes.</li>
      <li>Head &amp; Shoulders has been my preferred shampoo for many years.</li>
      <li>All have done a better job of controlling my dandruff flakes when compared to the &amp;#34;equivalent&amp;#34; store brands.  </li>
      <li>and I love the scent.</li>
      <li>really liked the original formulation of H&amp;S Citrus Breeze.  </li>
      <li>Most renditions have been pretty good.  </li>
      <li>I love the scent…it is light and refreshing.</li>
      <li>This new version has a very light pleasant citrus scent.</li>
      <li>Even my scalp felt more better and clean.</li>
      <li>It seems effective and leaves hair clean and lightly conditioned without being too frizzy.  </li>
      <li>Pleasant scent (more tropical than citrus smelling), silky smooth, lathers up very well, and leaves your hair clean but moisturized.</li>
      <li>While my other Head &amp; Shoulders takes wonderful care of my dandruff, my remaining problem was oil in my hair.  </li>
      <li>it&#x27;s an excellent shampoo just due to that.  </li>
      <li>This also leaves a cool feeling on my scalp that is refreshing.</li>
      <li>Not like I have huge hair anyways.&lt;br</li>
      <li>My primary concern was that the &amp;#34;oil control&amp;#34; formula would be too drying on my African-American hair.</li>
      <li>Head and Shoulders Instant Oil Control is a great product.</li>
      <li>The smell is light and citrusy  </li>
      <li>had avoided Head and Shoulders for years because the products available then smelled so medicinal.</li>
      <li>For me the product is worthwhile because it gets the job done at a price that is right.</li>
      <li>This is a fine shampoo, nothing special.</li>
      <li>This smells amazing and works VERY well at getting my hair super clean with just one wash and rinse, even after a sweaty workout.</li>
      <li>It controls flakes and cleans hair just as well as the original one does, and thus, fills no need except to create confusion in the already crowded supermarket aisle.&lt;br</li>
      <li>This makes my scalp feel clean and awake.  </li>
      <li>This shampoo takes care of the dandruff and my scalp feels really clean.</li>
      <li>You can lather, rinse, repeat until the cows come home and never get that squeaky clean feeling.  </li>
      <li>The mango scent is pleasant and reminiscent of the product used by the chain salon where I get my hair cut.</li>
      <li>like I have experienced in other bath products.</li>
      <li>The shampoo lathers up quickly.</li>
      <li>After almost 10 days of no shampooing this amazing shampoo brought my hair back to perfectly clean with ONE cycle of wash and rinse.</li>
      <li>The product was also very effective at removing previous buildup of hair products.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;While I wasn&#x27;t totally blown away, I liked the results.  </li>
      <li>It works well on my dry scalp, cleans my hair nicely, and leaves it feeling full.</li>
      <li>dandruff shampoos contain the same active ingredient to treat dandruff, so I&#x27;d just buy the best value for your money when shopping for this type of shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Make</li>
      <li>since this shampoo really does get all the oil off your hair and scalp you may want to make sure you have a light conditioner to use on long hair to ease out the tangles.</li>
      <li>I have tried several of the new Head &amp; Shoulders shampoos and I love what P&amp;G has done to the brand!</li>
      <li>Overall, this product is an improvement (and may be fine for those with only light oil issues), but it is not as good as some of H&amp;S&#x27;s earlier products.</li>
      <li>sure to leave it in your hair for several minutes, as indicated in the instructions, before rinsing it out.</li>
      <li>This formulation, at least for me, keeps my hair looking great through the day and well into the night.</li>
      <li>Since I color my hair, I try to go as many days as possible between shampoo applications to  </li>
      <li>With this product, I can stretch my washes out to every third day, so it helps keep my color looking better longer.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Really, how many versions of the same product do we need?</li>
      <li>The shampoo worked pretty well first use</li>
      <li>I also like the large bottle that&#x27;s flat on top</li>
      <li>I have been alternating the new formula Citrus Breeze with Tresemme Deep Clean Shampoo, which leaves my hair feeling clean but dries my scalp out.</li>
      <li>I disagree, I think this is actually quite a bit more scented as compared to normal head and shoulders.  </li>
      <li>or heavy feel to it more!</li>
      <li>I love the fresh, slightly fruity smell of this shampoo.  </li>
      <li>I like all of the H&amp;S products, but this is the one I would pick first, particularly if you have oily hair.</li>
      <li>The scent is also light enough that it doesn&#x27;t linger too much.  </li>
      <li>very easily.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d truly recommend this to someone with really oily hair that has troubles like I did.</li>
      <li>I have oily hair and this one really seems to make a difference.  </li>
      <li>Thanks to this trial program, I have had the opportunity to try a variety of the Head and Shoulders shampoos.  </li>
      <li>Highly recommended!</li>
      <li>I stocked up on the original Citrus Breeze but finally ran out.  </li>
      <li>Other reviewers here have commented they get a mostly medicinal, non-citrusy scent.  </li>
      <li>The bottom line is that hair is left squeaky clean and dandruff is controlled.  </li>
      <li>It left my hair feeling clean and kept dandruff at bay.  </li>
      <li>my dandruff really feel better about itself when cooled down a bit?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall, I&#x27;d likely buy more, especially if I see it on sale.  </li>
      <li>Also, the bottle was a lot bigger than I expected, which is always nice.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend it, particularly if you do have a problem with dandruff.</li>
      <li>It leaves my hair feeling soft and very manageable and keeps my scalp moisturized.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> This H&amp;S Instant Oil Control is better than the last version of Citrus Breeze, but it is still not a great shampoo for fine/oily hair.  For perspective, I have used Head and Shoulders almost my entire life.  Most renditions have been pretty good.  Occasionally there has been a particular product that I didn&#x27;t care for.  I do not like any added conditioners to fine/oily hair shampoos because folks with our type of hair don&#x27;t need conditioners.  But usually you could find ones without conditioners.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really liked the original formulation of H&amp;S Citrus Breeze.  It left my hair feeling clean and kept dandruff at bay.  However, the formulation changed with their &amp;#34;New Fresh Scent Technology&amp;#34; and that shampoo is worthless.  You can lather, rinse, repeat until the cows come home and never get that squeaky clean feeling.  I stocked up on the original Citrus Breeze but finally ran out.  I have been alternating the new formula Citrus Breeze with Tresemme Deep Clean Shampoo, which leaves my hair feeling clean but dries my scalp out. With this new Instant Oil Control H&amp;S, I hoped to get the right balance as before.  Unfortunately, though it is a step in the right direction, it still does not provide the oil control that I require.  After the second rinse, my hair feels fairly clean but not perfectly so.  I still use the Tresemme about every 3rd day.  If anyone reading this has found a great cleansing shampoo for fine/oily hair, please leave me a comment.  Overall, this product is an improvement (and may be fine for those with only light oil issues), but it is not as good as some of H&amp;S&#x27;s earlier products.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s been years since I&#x27;ve tried Head &amp; Shoulders, but I figured I would give this variety a shot.  My previous experiences tended to include an unpleasant scent, so-so cleaning, and either stringy or staticy hair (similar to various 2-in-1 shampoos), so the promise of a better smelling, better cleaning, and still effective version seemed appealing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I wasn&#x27;t totally blown away, I liked the results.  It seems effective and leaves hair clean and lightly conditioned without being too frizzy.  The scent is also light enough that it doesn&#x27;t linger too much.  It did a good job of cleaning, though I found that washing/rinsing twice was still necessary to thoroughly remove extra oil and build-up of other products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle recommends using it at least twice a week, or as directed (as often as every day if desired).  I probably wouldn&#x27;t use it every day, but I think a couple or three times per week would work well, especially if using other products that are prone to leave build-up.  I found that to be the case with another brand 2-in-1, so I might alternate with that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;d likely buy more, especially if I see it on sale.  It has largely eliminated my old negative perceptions of Head &amp; Shoulders, and anti-dandruff shampoos in general so I would recommend it to people who want some help controlling dandruff and oily hair without some of the typical drawbacks.</li>
    <li> This is a fine shampoo, nothing special. It smells nice and seems to work well at dandruff control. I like the size and it seems to not dry out my hair as much as other shampoos.</li>
    <li> Head and Shoulders Instant Oil Control is a great product. For me the product is worthwhile because it gets the job done at a price that is right. The citrus smell was a little odd the first time I used it but doesn&#x27;t bother me now at all.</li>
    <li> This is reminiscent of Dr. Bonner’s Castile soap because of the mint coolness while using it. It does not leave the hair dry but soft and moist and without dirt and hair oil secretions. Wonderful for the scalp as Head &amp; Shoulders always is.</li>
    <li> Head &amp; Shoulders does it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;Its formulated with mango and citrus essence&amp;#34; yet there is no mango in it. This shampoo is clearly labeled as Mango, so this is misleading. I guess that the term &amp;#34;essence&amp;#34; can mean anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All dandruff shampoos contain the same active ingredient to treat dandruff, so I&#x27;d just buy the best value for your money when shopping for this type of shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Make sure to leave it in your hair for several minutes, as indicated in the instructions, before rinsing it out.</li>
    <li> I have thick shoulder length hair that does not require a daily dandruff shampoo.  This strips most (if not all) the oils from my hair – so I only use it when I have a noticeable buildup. I love the scent…it is light and refreshing. I always use a conditioner…if I don’t my crown becomes dry and itchy.</li>
    <li> This smells amazing and works VERY well at getting my hair super clean with just one wash and rinse, even after a sweaty workout. I have long hair and usually need to wash and rinse twice to get it clean after going to the gym or working in the yard; I have fine hair, but a lot of it, so it can become a tangly gross mess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After one wash and rinse I noticed it felt smooth and clean and smelled great. I don&#x27;t have dandruff but my husband does, it is so nice to have one shampoo we can both use without sacrificing manageability and silkiness.  I have tried several of the new Head &amp; Shoulders shampoos and I love what P&amp;G has done to the brand! They feel and smell like good shampoo, not just a pasty chemical wash to rid your scalp of flakes like it used to be. You don&#x27;t have to suffer through cruddy shampoo if you have dandruff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I only need to condition the ends, since this shampoo really does get all the oil off your hair and scalp you may want to make sure you have a light conditioner to use on long hair to ease out the tangles. My hubby has oily hair too and his hair looks great but he needs no conditioner, I guess it is just needed if you have dry hair or if it is past your shoulders.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: My toddlers and I were sick for more than a week. The showers we took did not include shampooing because of the cold weather and zero desire to blow-dry. After almost 10 days of no shampooing this amazing shampoo brought my hair back to perfectly clean with ONE cycle of wash and rinse. Zero grease or yuck left behind. Without conditioner my hair felt great too.</li>
    <li> Pleasant scent (more tropical than citrus smelling), silky smooth, lathers up very well, and leaves your hair clean but moisturized. I&#x27;ve never liked Head &amp; Shoulders before but there upped their game well beyond dandruff control.</li>
    <li> I did not experiece any oil control progress after switching on this product. I was looking for a shampoo who allow me to wash my hear a little bit less frequently than how I used to do used a normal shampoo, This is definitively not my final solution.</li>
    <li> It works well for controlling dandruff. I noted a pleasant light citrus fragrance during use. My primary concern was that the &amp;#34;oil control&amp;#34; formula would be too drying on my African-American hair. However, my hair still had the proper level of moisture and did not feel stiff or too dry. I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> My teenage daughter has very oily hair and it was very hard to find a store that carried shampoo for oily hair in our area.  The shampoo worked pretty well first use and I believe will perform better with continued use. Due to allergies, she needed a product that would work with as little botanical ingredients as possible.Thank you Amazon for carrying this product!</li>
    <li> I love the fresh, slightly fruity smell of this shampoo.  This makes my scalp feel clean and awake.  I usually use a 2 in 1 product on my hair or shampoo and conditioner.  But, when using this, all I use is the shampoo.  It leaves my hair feeling thick and bouncy and very manageable.  It&#x27;s a very different feeling than when I use conditioner.  I really like this shampoo as it makes my head feel good and my hair turns out very nice.  My scalp seems to stay better hydrated during the day with no itching and no flakes.</li>
    <li> Before using the product, I had a hard time finding the right products to take the oils out totally I found myself washing my hair everyday to twice a day because the oils would come back  after I washed my hair. Tried all kinds of shampoos and conditioner then was using dish liquid to get rid of the oils which was helping for a while-_-....and then just shampoo no conditioner which was somewhat helping but it&#x27;d have dry frizzy hair and didn&#x27;t want to brushed at all. Soo I was in search for something that was good with oily hair I googled and found that citrus get rid of or soaks up oils which lead me to head and shoulders so I looked for citrus base shampoo on the shelve in hand and shoulders section and found oil control and could not wait to try it. After I tried it for the first time, my hair felt more cleaner than ever and plus being able to feel every strand of hair on my head!!!!! Even my scalp felt more better and clean. It&#x27;s not dry either, just shiny, soft and I&#x27;m seeing less frizz. My hair is also more flowing now not so stuck to my head! or heavy feel to it more! Soooo glad I found this. I&#x27;d truly recommend this to someone with really oily hair that has troubles like I did.</li>
    <li> My family has been using H&amp;S products for years. It seems, however, that every couple of years H&amp;S tries to re-invent itself. Now we have &#x27;instant relief&#x27; shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first, without reading the small print, I thought I would get &#x27;instant relief&#x27; from my dandruff. Instead I got instant &#x27;cooling&#x27; relief. I&#x27;m a bit confused about the cooling effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does my dandruff really feel better about itself when cooled down a bit?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a couple of showers my hair feel a bit flatter. Not like I have huge hair anyways.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scent is okay. Not very manly. I doubt I&#x27;ll use on my next hot date with Mrs. Wrong.</li>
    <li> My teenage son uses Head &amp; Shoulders shampoo to control dandruff, but he had not yet tried this version. I ordered it for him through Amazon Vine, and now it&#x27;s his favorite H &amp; S product. He really likes the citrus scent, but notes it smells more like an artificial Gatorade-like citrus rather than fresh-cut limes, but that&#x27;s to be expected in a mass-market commercial shampoo. He says it does control his dandruff, and he likes the refreshing feeling the citrus leaves on his scalp. It has also cut down the oiliness of his hair. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> Thanks to this trial program, I have had the opportunity to try a variety of the Head and Shoulders shampoos.  I have to say this one is now the one for me.  All have done a better job of controlling my dandruff flakes when compared to the &amp;#34;equivalent&amp;#34; store brands.  I have oily hair and this one really seems to make a difference.  I&#x27;m not sure what is in there, but even other H&amp;S shampoos would let my hair build up oiliness about mid-afternoon and my hair would begin to flatten.  This formulation, at least for me, keeps my hair looking great through the day and well into the night.</li>
    <li> My mother used this and says it&#x27;s hard to wash out.</li>
    <li> Head &amp; Shoulders has been my preferred shampoo for many years. It works well on my dry scalp, cleans my hair nicely, and leaves it feeling full. This new version has a very light pleasant citrus scent. It&#x27;s thick and rich and does exactly what I expect H&amp;S to do. I like this new scent quite well. I also like the large bottle that&#x27;s flat on top so I can store it upside down when it gets low.</li>
    <li> Personally, I prefer inexpensive products.  This product is priced right and exceeded our expectations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Coming off a hard winter and confined indoors to very dry gas heat, some in our household experienced minor flaking.  This product took care of that for all of us in about 4 days of use.  The product was also very effective at removing previous buildup of hair products.  The fact the product really has very little scent was plus for all of us.  The bottom line is that hair is left squeaky clean and dandruff is controlled.  We will be stocking this.</li>
    <li> This is now my favorite version of Head &amp; Shoulders shampoo. The fragrance is very much like mango and other citrus fruit. The shampoo lathers up quickly. It rinses out easily and doesn&#x27;t leave behind a feeling that some shampoo remains. I like all of the H&amp;S products, but this is the one I would pick first, particularly if you have oily hair. I use H&amp;S shampoos regularly, and dandruff is not a problem for me.</li>
    <li> The best I have used! My hair is usually flat by the following day after washing and will need washing. I didn&#x27;t wash my hair until the third day and even on that day my hair felt fresh and fluffy like it was just washed.. I have their oil control conditioner which is amazing too!</li>
    <li> This product helps control the oil level in my hair so I don&#x27;t always have to take a shower as often because my hair looks oily. This also leaves a cool feeling on my scalp that is refreshing.</li>
    <li> This shampoo provides an instant clean feeling without the eye irritation of some other varieties. The mango scent is pleasant and reminiscent of the product used by the chain salon where I get my hair cut. Recommended.</li>
    <li> This is another great Head and Shoulders shampoo. It has the usual thick liquid consistency with a slightly green color. The scent is that of mango and citrus as it states. Being for oil control, this tends to dry the hair. It leaves the hair soft, but not very shiny. If you don&#x27;t have oily hair, this is not for you; just use the type for normal hair.</li>
    <li> Other reviewers here have commented they get a mostly medicinal, non-citrusy scent.  I disagree, I think this is actually quite a bit more scented as compared to normal head and shoulders.  Any more scent and you&#x27;d smell it on me all day from feet away.  It works just as well as &#x27;normal&#x27; head and shoulders, and keeps grease away for longer than a normal shampoo.  Even if you don&#x27;t have dandruff it&#x27;s an excellent shampoo just due to that.  Also, the bottle was a lot bigger than I expected, which is always nice.</li>
    <li> I was surprised at how creamy this shampoo is and the small is refreshing. Some of the dandruff shampoos I&#x27;ve used are runny. This one stays in your hand and works into your hair and scalp very easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t usually have a problem with dandruff, but in the winter with forced air heating my hair and scalp get dried out. This shampoo takes care of the dandruff and my scalp feels really clean. I have long hair so to avoid tangles I do have to use a conditioner. My hair felt as silky as when I use other shampoos that are designed specifically to leave your hair smooth and silky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had avoided Head and Shoulders for years because the products available then smelled so medicinal. However, this shampoo is different. The smell is light and citrusy  I will continue using it. I highly recommend it, particularly if you do have a problem with dandruff.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Head and Shoulders shampoos for about 25 years or so. I&#x27;ve tried several of their varieties and have to admit that they all work well at what they do, that is, they control dandruff and flakes, and they do it well. I would wish however that the marketing department would stop trying to promote fluff. That is to create additional versions just for the sake of creating them, or for getting a larger portion of the shampoo aisle, or to confuse the customers. This shampoo is no better than the classic, and no worse. It controls flakes and cleans hair just as well as the original one does, and thus, fills no need except to create confusion in the already crowded supermarket aisle.&lt;br /&gt;Really, how many versions of the same product do we need?</li>
    <li> love that this shampoo helps with the greasy hair issue!  I know that washing your hair every day isn&#x27;t ideal BUT I live and work on a dairy farm and lets just say the pooh tends to fly and often lands in my hair so I need to wash it more often and I already had a greasy hair issue before that ... and from my own personal experience I can tell you that finding &#x27;grease ball&#x27; shampoo is dang near impossible.  My husband and I&#x27;ve both spend a lot of time looking through the shampoo selection at stores with no success.&lt;br /&gt;I viewed dandruff control as a bonus with this Head and Shoulders shampoo (even though I know that&#x27;s typically what people buy this particular brand for).  My hair feels and looks cleaner - and I love the scent.</li>
    <li> This shampoo smells good, feels good, and cleans excellent. And when you are done and your hair drys you will see much less flaking from your scalp as you go through your day. Superb product!</li>
    <li> One of the best among head and shoulder shampoos.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- Cooling feeling in the scalp (citrus cool)&lt;br /&gt;- Cleans hair well&lt;br /&gt;- Helps with dry scalp (not just dandruff)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- The citrus means, it&#x27;s extra harsh on your eyes. Definitely not kid friendly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I recommend this to any adult. I don&#x27;t have dandruff issues, but sometimes my scalp gets dry and this helps with it. The cooling feeling is nice (though not as strong as the &amp;#34;mint&amp;#34; shampoos if you&#x27;ve ever used those) and it gets the job done.</li>
    <li> I have been a Head &amp; Shoulders user for years.  Since I color my hair, I try to go as many days as possible between shampoo applications to  help my color last longer.  While my other Head &amp; Shoulders takes wonderful care of my dandruff, my remaining problem was oil in my hair.  I could really only stretch my washes out to every other day before it would start too look bad and I would need to wash.  With this product, I can stretch my washes out to every third day, so it helps keep my color looking better longer.  As an added bonus, I find the smell refreshing and not at all overwhelming like I have experienced in other bath products.</li>
    <li> This Shampoo is excellent! The consistency, lather and scent make it enjoyable to use. It leaves my hair feeling soft and very manageable and keeps my scalp moisturized. This shampoo is now a staple in my shower routine.</li>
    <li> I have used an anti-dandruff shampoo for decades and have seen them move from the tar-based smelly stuff (with no choice except &amp;#34;crazy expensive&amp;#34; and Head and Shoulders to the wide variety of great-working and great-smelling shampoos that fill the shelves today.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product smells great and cleans my hair nicely. It makes my scalp tingle when I wash my hair so it has something new and different going on. But, I am finding that my scalp is itchier than normal. Maybe it&#x27;s the changing seasons, maybe it&#x27;s the shampoo.</li>
