      <li>I saw this color on pintrest and loved it.  </li>
      <li>So glad I found this color on here!</li>

      <li>Love, love, love, it!</li>
      <li>My body&#x27;s organs are very important to me</li>
      <li>I love this polish.  </li>
      <li>I love it</li>
      <li>Perfect and only would buy Opi</li>
      <li>Love the gold color too and like to layer it on top of another color too.</li>
      <li>You do need to apply 2-3 coats, but it&#x27;s such a beautiful color and</li>
      <li>Hands down the best glitter polish I have ever used.</li>
      <li>I love this color very much!  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s such a beautiful gold glittered color that adds bling to your nails for the holidays or just a fun go-to!</li>

      <li>the color and sparkle is fantastic.  </li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re familiar with OPI, it&#x27;s one of the leading nail-polish brands</li>
      <li>well worth it!</li>
      <li>Beautiful as an accent nail with tons of other colors.</li>
      <li>Goes on evenly, smaller glitter color that is good underneath for a &amp;#34;ruffian&amp;#34; manicure or by itself.  </li>
      <li>Beautiful gold glitter is super thick but goes on easy.</li>
      <li>pretty light gold color that looks like the glitter you get at the salon with a shellac manicure.  </li>
      <li>And the shipping was very fast!</li>
      <li>Shipping was fast and I received the nice new bottle of nailpolish that I had been expecting all in one piece!</li>
      <li>I probably own 20 different shades of OPI - maybe more - and this is by far my new favorite.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s the new rough-as-sandpaper type (doesn&#x27;t go on glossy or smooth), but</li>
      <li>It is very much a champaign-gold in my opinion which I prefer.</li>
      <li>but it is so much prettier than the picture provided!</li>
      <li>It went on exactly how the picture on Amazon depicted.</li>
      <li>The cost wasn&#x27;t very high.</li>
      <li>This will not work on top of other color, too pigmented.</li>
      <li>It is so subtle and absolutely gorgeous for the upcoming holidays.</li>
      <li>This applies pretty opaquely and you can apply a few more layers of clear nail-polish to combat the grittiness.</li>
      <li>The only thing I suggest is finishing it off with a clear top coat; I forgot and the polish was very rough in texture but did not chip.</li>
      <li>(By the way, I&#x27;m 30 years old.)    </li>
      <li>The price is reasonable since any typical OPI nail-polish will run you about $8.</li>

    <li> I LOVE OPI! I was concerned that this gold may be too much of a yellow gold for my liking but it is so much prettier than the picture provided! It is so subtle and absolutely gorgeous for the upcoming holidays. It can be worn anytime throughout the year and go great! The only thing I suggest is finishing it off with a clear top coat; I forgot and the polish was very rough in texture but did not chip.</li>
    <li> I love this polish.  This is the best sparkle polish I have ever found.  Would order again.  Love the gold color too and like to layer it on top of another color too.</li>
    <li> The gel color is brighter than the polish. Actually it&#x27;s not as sparlkly either.</li>
    <li> The BEST glitter polish I have ever used. Small crystals leaves an all over shine, goes on with even coverage even though you still need two coats. A beautiful mix of silver and gold that you can wear with anything! So happy I saw this at the mani/pedi place that I bought it myself.</li>

    <li> I like OPI nail polishes. I have several from the Mariah Carey and San Francisco collections. But there&#x27;s a negative side to using these polishes. The description says they dont contain DBP, toluene, or formaldehyde (which are dangerous toxins and can cause damage to your body and cause health issues), but I later researced these nail polishes on the internet after my mentrual cycle was disrupted and had other small problems with my body. Thankfully they lasted a short time and went away when I stopped using the nail polishes. The internet websites said OPI was banned from the market in the UK some years back because it contained some of these toxins. And even though now nail polishes (OPI and others) claim these harmful toxins are not in their nail polishes, a test showed some traces of it was still in these nail polishes.    I started using a couple of the nail polishes in November. In December I discovered a missed period and pain in my head and jaw. It hurt just to yawn. I didn&#x27;t go to the doctor. I diagnosed myself after reading about the toxins in the nail polish. So I just stopped using them. I bought surgical masks if I ever decide to paint my nails again. This way I won&#x27;t inhale the chemicals from the nail polishes.    I stopped using the polishes in December. The last one I used was In My Santa Suit (Mariah Carey Collection) on Christmas Eve. I haven&#x27;t painted my nails since. Now it&#x27;s February and my menstrual cycle is back the way it&#x27;s always been. On time and regular. (By the way, I&#x27;m 30 years old.)    I felt the need to tell everyone of my experiences. My body&#x27;s organs are very important to me and I don&#x27;t want them to be damaged from toxic chemicals from nail polish.    **This got 4 stars because the colors are amazing. The toxins gotta go.          **Update: I continue to use these nail polishes. But I always wear a surgical mask during the process of painting my nails.</li>
    <li> This opi polish is fabulous it sparkles and twinkles ... I love it and sometimes I wear it on 1 nail of each hand and the other nails are On Her Majesty&#x27;s Secret Service.</li>
    <li> Hands down the best glitter polish I have ever used. Beautiful gold glitter is super thick but goes on easy. This will not work on top of other color, too pigmented. Beautiful as an accent nail with tons of other colors.</li>
    <li> Purchased for 3 daughters after they saw color on Pintrest.  They love it!!!</li>
    <li> You must get this polish.  It&#x27;s the new rough-as-sandpaper type (doesn&#x27;t go on glossy or smooth), but the color and sparkle is fantastic.  A great neutral color that goes with everything (including both silver and gold jewelry) and that also stands out.  I probably own 20 different shades of OPI - maybe more - and this is by far my new favorite.</li>
    <li> Out of every product line,the female picked this product.It goes on nicely,doesn&#x27;t fade and separate.The cost wasn&#x27;t very high.This is one of the gold colors she picked</li>
    <li> It is a great nail polish for a night out or if you want to stay in with the &#x27;in&#x27; within nail art use it for your &#x27;party nail&#x27;. I loved it and so did my grand daughter.</li>
    <li> So glad I found this color on here! It&#x27;s my favorite! A perfect champagne glitter. And the shipping was very fast! I am very happy! :)</li>
    <li> After having this color applied on my nails at a nail salon, I scoured the internet looking for the color. It&#x27;s such a beautiful gold glittered color that adds bling to your nails for the holidays or just a fun go-to! I will warn you that the texture is gritty if you don&#x27;t like that, but it&#x27;s due to the coarse glitter that makes up the polish. This applies pretty opaquely and you can apply a few more layers of clear nail-polish to combat the grittiness. The price is reasonable since any typical OPI nail-polish will run you about $8. As for the color, this is not a yellow gold. It is very much a champaign-gold in my opinion which I prefer. Shipping was fast and I received the nice new bottle of nailpolish that I had been expecting all in one piece! If you&#x27;re familiar with OPI, it&#x27;s one of the leading nail-polish brands so you can rest assured that you are receiving a quality product should you choose to buy it.</li>
    <li> You do need to apply 2-3 coats, but it&#x27;s such a beautiful color and well worth it! I get compliments every time I use this color, not just around the holidays!</li>
