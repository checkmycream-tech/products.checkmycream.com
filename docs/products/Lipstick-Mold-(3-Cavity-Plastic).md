      <li>They come out very nice</li>
      <li>For those of you who like to DIY your own lipstick, this is for you!</li>
      <li>Once of a good consistency,</li>
      <li>Good quality , but</li>
      <li>I made six lipsticks on the first day and they came out just perfectly!</li>
      <li>It was my first attempt at making lipstick and everything came out perfectly.  </li>
      <li>It was my first attempt at making lipstick and everything came out perfectly.</li>
      <li>, First time I ever had more than a couple of &amp;#34;Just Right&amp;#34; lipsticks in my life!!!</li>
      <li>handy</li>
      <li>It would have been nice if the handles were easier to grip.</li>
      <li>Very easy to use.</li>
      <li>It works perfectly &amp; I&#x27;ve already refreshed 3 old lipsticks that I thought were done for.  </li>
      <li>I make homemade all natural lipstick/lip tint and this mold is the perfect size.  </li>
      <li>Great Fun,</li>
      <li>However they work great and are easy to clean.</li>
      <li>it is an ok deal.</li>
      <li>Make sure you have some rubber bands</li>
      <li>I love the product, love love.</li>
      <li>I had to guess.:)</li>
      <li>She was able to make her mother one tube of lipstick for mothers day.  </li>
      <li>I want to buy more things from this company</li>
      <li>Tip: after you make sure you&#x27;ve sanitized the inside with rubbing alcohol, wipe the inside with olive oil.</li>
      <li>I am still undecided as to whether I will try to tighten the ends with rubber bands or something, or just throw it away and get a better quality mold.  </li>
      <li>I really love this thing.</li>
      <li>make sure you wrap the form with rubber bands so that you don&#x27;t get any leakage.</li>
      <li>It would seem that it would be cheaper to buy many items and they mail them together (which they do) and it should save on postage.</li>
      <li>This arrived promptly and I was very excited to use it.  </li>
      <li>I was so happy to find this product on Amazon; I never ordered the Lipstick Remix kit &amp; since they&#x27;re no longer selling those, I thought I was SOL when it came to fixing old lipstick.  </li>
      <li>Perfect size for tje empty tube.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s really easy to use.</li>
      <li>It would not come appart that easily.</li>
      <li>but that is easily rubbed away.</li>
      <li>WAY OVERPRICED, but a cheap and easy option.</li>
      <li>One lipstick for some reason didn&#x27;t fill smoothly on one side but all in all my first try was pretty successful.  </li>
      <li>this is a must for smooth removal of the lipstick.  </li>
      <li>The molds were overall a great buy.</li>
      <li>I lightly coated the inside with oil  before pouring and I had a smooth removal of the lipstick.</li>
      <li>if recommend it as a cheap option</li>
      <li>Broke the first DAY!!  </li>
      <li>I was so excited when I received this item.  </li>
      <li>Make sure you really squeeze the sides together.</li>
      <li>Oh, Most of my emptied lipstick tubes were ready to be re-used.  </li>
      <li>Then with the mold full, you put it in the freezer.  </li>
      <li>Some quick internet searching led me to this 3 lipstick mold &amp; the price was right!  </li>
      <li>Even though there isn&#x27;t any instructions that come with this, it&#x27;s pretty easy to figure out.</li>
      <li>For the price it is definitely worth it.  </li>
      <li>but how fun is this?  </li>
      <li>Since they charge postage for each individual item, you can end up owing more for postage then your original order.</li>
      <li>your first few trials are not going to be great because you need to figure out how to use it.  </li>
      <li>Easy to use, to open and to clean.</li>
      <li>The items do not weigh very much so I don&#x27;t understand why they charge so much for shipping!</li>
      <li>Otherwise, everything is exactly as described.</li>
      <li>It is exactly what I wanted.</li>
      <li>The first time I used it the liquid leaked out all over.</li>
      <li>Put them in the freezer first.  </li>
      <li>My granddaughter made her first lipstick and it leaked everywhere.  </li>
      <li>It didn&#x27;t leak and it was easy to open.</li>
      <li>If you were interested in making really perfect pro quality lipsticks then the two part expensive molds are better for that, since they are made in such a way that you don&#x27;t have to handle the lipsticks with your fingers like you will have to with this simple mold.  </li>
      <li>This mold however, is the perfect mold for someone who just wants to reuse old lipstick left overs to make new shades or play around with their hand at making a few lipsticks for friends.  </li>
      <li>This mold was very affordable, just wish there had been a product description and how to use insert.</li>
      <li>Really doesn&#x27;t work.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t like that and don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s very hygenic.  </li>
      <li>The mold works really well.  </li>
      <li>There are no directions, and though I have checked online, it seems more trouble than it&#x27;s worth.  </li>
      <li>My first batch was only two lipsticks out of the three in the mold and it went pretty well.  </li>
      <li>I only wish the lipstick&#x27;s final shape had the angled tip for a more luxurious look.  </li>
      <li>Kind of hard to pull the sticks on the side.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend it to anyone who has a favorite old lipstick that&#x27;s dried out - this mold will help you make it practically brand new again!</li>
      <li>Nice products for the DIY people like me- definitely needs rubber bands to hold the molds in place tightly-</li>
      <li>but I made 8 new lipsticks out of leftover lipsticks and chapsticks</li>
      <li>They come out looking very professional.</li>
      <li>A previous reviewer suggested lightly coating the inside with oil (I used argan with a bit of peppermint) before pouring--</li>
      <li>It works okay, just wish that it was made a little differently.  </li>
      <li>It kept falling to the side when trying to apply to lips, or fell out completely.</li>
      <li>they were completely unusable.</li>
      <li>My train of thought is that I can scrape out my old tubes, mold new colors, and reuse the former containers.  </li>
      <li>I took the left overs from 20 lipstick cases and make 6 new lipsticks.  </li>
      <li>Because of this be prepared for a bit of a mess, but it is well worth the effort.</li>
      <li>I did not mind the lipstick&#x27;s round tip, but for a more luxurious look, I cut the tip slightly with a knife and had an angled tip.</li>
      <li>This one&#x27;s too Light, this one&#x27;s too Dark, this one&#x27;s too Red, this ones&#x27;s too Pink, etc.&lt;br</li>

<li> In less than a minute it will solidify enough to not leak.  </li>
<li> The mold size were a little smaller than I needed but, O made it work for my containers.</li>
<li> A little difficult to take apart, but very useful.</li>

    <li> In order to use this mold, you must greese the inside with something. I use olive oil or jojoba oil. Also if it leaks, use some electrical tape around it &amp; at will do the trick. Becare how you cut the tape because it is possible to break your lipee. They come out very nice</li>
    <li> Works well, no seams for me!  It was my first attempt at making lipstick and everything came out perfectly.  Doesn&#x27;t come with instructions, but I didn&#x27;t need them.  A previous reviewer suggested lightly coating the inside with oil (I used argan with a bit of peppermint) before pouring--this is a must for smooth removal of the lipstick.  I only wish the lipstick&#x27;s final shape had the angled tip for a more luxurious look.  Otherwise, everything is exactly as described.</li>
    <li> I was so happy to find this product on Amazon; I never ordered the Lipstick Remix kit &amp; since they&#x27;re no longer selling those, I thought I was SOL when it came to fixing old lipstick.  Some quick internet searching led me to this 3 lipstick mold &amp; the price was right!  Shipping was even cheaper through Amazon than through the vendor&#x27;s website &amp; I had it within a couple of days.  It works perfectly &amp; I&#x27;ve already refreshed 3 old lipsticks that I thought were done for.  I highly recommend it to anyone who has a favorite old lipstick that&#x27;s dried out - this mold will help you make it practically brand new again!</li>
    <li> This is a mold not a lipstick. Your questions are quite strange. Anyway. I love the product, love love. Easy to use, to open and to clean. Perfect size for tje empty tube. Wonderfull ! And the price is affordable, less than 13$.</li>
    <li> Wish they have it in other shapes. Great mold.</li>
    <li> Its not what I expected it to be. Kind of hard to pull the sticks on the side. It would not come appart that easily.</li>
    <li> The molds were overall a great buy. It would have been nice if the handles were easier to grip. The mold size were a little smaller than I needed but, O made it work for my containers.</li>
    <li> I have one lipstick brand in one colour I am not allergic to. That&#x27;s it for the next 15 years.  I took the left overs from 20 lipstick cases and make 6 new lipsticks.  Yay!  Put them in the freezer first.  Melt lipstick in the microwave for a short time. Poor into mold, holding it tight.  In less than a minute it will solidify enough to not leak.  Put back in the freezer.  After a few hours they were solid enough to push out and stick into the empty lipstick case.  WAY OVERPRICED, but a cheap and easy option.</li>
    <li> This mold was very affordable, just wish there had been a product description and how to use insert. I had to guess.:)</li>
    <li> Nice products for the DIY people like me- definitely needs rubber bands to hold the molds in place tightly- but I made 8 new lipsticks out of leftover lipsticks and chapsticks</li>
    <li> The Hardest Part was sorting my reject, &amp;#34;Goldie Locks&amp;#34; lipsticks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You know: This one&#x27;s too Light, this one&#x27;s too Dark, this one&#x27;s too Red, this ones&#x27;s too Pink, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All to eventually mix and make over a dozen &amp;#34;Just Right&amp;#34; lipsticks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--for no more than the cost of this mold. Oh, Most of my emptied lipstick tubes were ready to be re-used.  Great Fun, Great money-saving, First time I ever had more than a couple of &amp;#34;Just Right&amp;#34; lipsticks in my life!!!</li>
    <li> The process requires you to handle the lipstick with your hands and place it in a tube.  I don&#x27;t like that and don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s very hygenic.  I also don&#x27;t like the round tip.</li>
    <li> great product. its plastic. can get messy, but does what its meant to do. if recommend it as a cheap option</li>
    <li> I was so excited when I received this item.  My granddaughter made her first lipstick and it leaked everywhere.  Out of three molds only one held.  She was able to make her mother one tube of lipstick for mothers day.  But she was so disappointed she has not made any since.  When I contacted the company they said use rubber bands to hold it together, if they knew there was a problem with the molds why didn&#x27;t they fix the problem or include the rubber bands? I will try it again when I get some rubber bands. inconvenient as can be, they should have just sent them with the molds.</li>
    <li> For those of you who like to DIY your own lipstick, this is for you! Very easy to use. Tip: after you make sure you&#x27;ve sanitized the inside with rubbing alcohol, wipe the inside with olive oil. The lipsticks will slide out like a breeze.</li>
    <li> It was my first attempt at making lipstick and everything came out perfectly. It is very simple, I didn&#x27;t need any instructions to use the mold. I lightly coated the inside with oil  before pouring and I had a smooth removal of the lipstick. I did not mind the lipstick&#x27;s round tip, but for a more luxurious look, I cut the tip slightly with a knife and had an angled tip.</li>
    <li> The mold works really well.  You need a small cup to melt the old lip stick (Dixie). Then with the mold full, you put it in the freezer.  It is a little difficult to remove the newly made, molded lipstick, but once removed from mold it does go in one of the old tubes easily.  It is exactly what I wanted.</li>
    <li> A low cost solution but it results in a round lipstick end, rather than slanted, with is what I prefer. However they work great and are easy to clean.</li>
    <li> Even though there isn&#x27;t any instructions that come with this, it&#x27;s pretty easy to figure out. Make sure you have some rubber bands handy and you&#x27;ll prevent leakage. Good luck!</li>
    <li> I make homemade all natural lipstick/lip tint and this mold is the perfect size.  It works great with my lipstick tubes I bought as well!  They come out looking very professional.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s really easy to use.</li>
    <li> I really love this thing. I made six lipsticks on the first day and they came out just perfectly! They only thing bad about ordering from MakingCosmetics is the way they charge for postage. They charge for each individual thing. It would seem that it would be cheaper to buy many items and they mail them together (which they do) and it should save on postage. Since they charge postage for each individual item, you can end up owing more for postage then your original order. The items do not weigh very much so I don&#x27;t understand why they charge so much for shipping! I want to buy more things from this company but I probably won&#x27;t until they adjust their shipping costs.</li>
    <li> Broke the first DAY!!  Very poor mold!!</li>
    <li> Perhaps it is my fault for assuming I was going to make lipstick out of my broken ones, but this sits unused.  There are no directions, and though I have checked online, it seems more trouble than it&#x27;s worth.  My train of thought is that I can scrape out my old tubes, mold new colors, and reuse the former containers.  The problem is how?  This remains a mystery.</li>
    <li> I have to say, this has a bit of a learning curve to get the perfect lipstick but how fun is this?  I got this because I hate to throw away empty tubes with lipstick still in the base and let me tell you there is a lot in those tubes wasted.  What I did was use an old tube and push chapstick into the base leaving an 1/8 or less for the base of the melted lipstick to stick into so that I would not repeat that waste.  My first batch was only two lipsticks out of the three in the mold and it went pretty well.  There are no instructions so I went on the internet for ideas how to use.  Basically melt your lipstick in a small glass jar or beaker in a water bath slowly.  I put coconut oil over the inside of the mold but I am not sure this is really necessary.  Once of a good consistency, pour into mold and put into refrigerator till cold.  I pulled the mold apart and hand stuck the lipsticks into my vintage lipstick tubes which is a little messy.  One lipstick for some reason didn&#x27;t fill smoothly on one side but all in all my first try was pretty successful.  If you were interested in making really perfect pro quality lipsticks then the two part expensive molds are better for that, since they are made in such a way that you don&#x27;t have to handle the lipsticks with your fingers like you will have to with this simple mold.  This mold however, is the perfect mold for someone who just wants to reuse old lipstick left overs to make new shades or play around with their hand at making a few lipsticks for friends.  I think next time I do this they will be perfect.</li>
    <li> It works okay, just wish that it was made a little differently.  It serves its purpose but I wish it was a fancier shape and the mold didn&#x27;t pull apart.  You should put some type of oil on the mold to make the removal a little easier.  For the price it is definitely worth it.  I will get lots and lots of use out of it.</li>
    <li> Really doesn&#x27;t work.  Too hard to release from mold intact, even with pre-oiling or non-stick spraying first.  For the 1 in 20 tries where one came out reasonably well shaped, the next problem was that it was hard to insert into a lipstick tube holdero stay in and upright. It kept falling to the side when trying to apply to lips, or fell out completely.</li>
    <li> I ordered this mold online I just used it once the time to make a one time lipstick. When I tried to use for the second time, the lipstick liquid was leaking. I really hate writing bad reviews but I recommend the one made with iron it&#x27;s more expensive but we get what we pay for I guess.</li>
    <li> Small, &amp;#34;cheap&amp;#34; looking.  It does NOT come with instructions, so your first few trials are not going to be great because you need to figure out how to use it.  I recommend holding together with a rubber band.  It is difficult to connect and pull apart.  The best things about this is the price.  You can buy this and play around with making products without paying a lot for this.</li>
    <li> Good quality , but the design is kind of awkward , I do not like having to touch the lipstick bars in order to put  them within the tube</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t used this  mold yet  and I wish they came with instructions.</li>
    <li> I loved it! It didn&#x27;t leak and it was easy to open. The lipstick didn&#x27;t stick to the mold and if you sick it in the freezer you should have enough time to put it in the tube without getting color allover your fingers.</li>
    <li> After a couple of tries, it got easier. make sure you wrap the form with rubber bands so that you don&#x27;t get any leakage. There should be a tiny little spatula to go with this product as it was not easy to use a toothpick to dig out my old lipstick out of the case. Because of this be prepared for a bit of a mess, but it is well worth the effort.</li>
    <li> A little difficult to take apart, but very useful. It leaves a small outward crease once you remove the lipstick but that is easily rubbed away. In all a great product for the price.</li>
    <li> This arrived promptly and I was very excited to use it.  However, the &amp;#34;tubes&amp;#34; on both sides leaked so badly they were completely unusable. I got only one usable lipstick from the mold.  I am still undecided as to whether I will try to tighten the ends with rubber bands or something, or just throw it away and get a better quality mold.  So disappointed.</li>
    <li> The first time I used it the liquid leaked out all over. Make sure you really squeeze the sides together. All in all for the price it is an ok deal. That being said,,,fast ship no issues I will definitely buy from this amazon seller again.</li>
