<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> The headbands are really thin and stretch some what quickly.  Other than that there great :).</li>
    <li> I bought these for my daughter&#x27;s softball team.  Just as described and shipped fast.  The girls love them.</li>
    <li> Great dealer but very low quality hair bands. Received them promptly but simply could not give them as a Christmas gift, even at this price.</li>
    <li> What a great variety and the quality is not cheap at all.</li>
    <li> Great colors, fast delivery.  The one that I really wanted broke the first time I wore it.  I get lots of compliments on them when I wear them!!!</li>
    <li> These were a Christmas gift for my 12 year old granddaughter. She absolutely loves them.  They are a good quality, fit her head like a glove and glittery.  What girl doesn&#x27;t like glitter?  The company was easyto work with.  Highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> My granddaughters wear them a lot and like them.</li>
    <li> Great sellers to work with. They should contact you on the colors you want, so watch your junk mail folder. :) These headbands are cute and my girls love them. So great to have a replenished stash, and these are great for it!</li>
    <li> The shipping was extrememly fast! All of the colors were perfect except for the purple which looks like a bright pink.</li>
    <li> It can on time. I have to say this is great. Beautiful colors and the way they r made is good quality.not cheap glitter that falls right off.... I loved them my daughter adores them.....&lt;br /&gt; ☆☆☆☆☆☆</li>
    <li> My granddaughter loves these hair bands. They fit without discomforting her. The glitter stays on without falling off. She just slips it on her hair with ease.&lt;br /&gt;She loves the variety of colors.</li>
    <li> Great headband for girls softball team and great price...thank you!!!</li>
    <li> I got these within 3 days of ordering them and they are just as I expected them to be! I got all of the colors I asked for and I love them! Definitely worth the buy!</li>
    <li> I was very happy. I got an immediate e-mail requesting my color choices. Then the headbands arrived in a very reasonable time. I would definitely order again.</li>
    <li> Too cute!! Got them for my daughter and use them myself! Totally worth it!!</li>
    <li> These are adorable. I saw someone with them on before and had to find some for myself. They&#x27;re cute! They may or may not last long, but if they don&#x27;t I&#x27;m comfortable with how much I paid. The seller is very prompt, and includes a copy of the message you send with your color choices in your shipment. I would definitely order from this seller again!</li>
    <li> Great customer service. I want to give them a 5 but they are too smooth and slide off my daughters head.  Maybe if they had a little rubber strip to grab the hair it would be better.</li>
    <li> I bought these for my 2 teenage girls and they LOVE them! I was even able to specify the 12 colors I wanted and I got them all. And I got them very fast (less than a week from order placement, to customized request, to in my mailbox). These cost much more in the store, so I basically got 12 for the price of 2 here! You can NOT beat this price or the quality. They are just as good as the ones in the store. You won&#x27;t go wrong with these. If you are debating...don&#x27;t...just buy them. You won&#x27;t be disappointed. I&#x27;m probably going to order 12 more...Thank you!</li>
    <li> These headbands are super cute, colors are exactly as they were shown.  Fast shipping.</li>
    <li> Great headbands.  They fit well and stay in place throughout my kids&#x27; soccer and basketball games.  Easy to choose the colors and quick shipping.</li>
    <li> I love companies that are on top of things.  This company sent personalized emails about the status&lt;br /&gt;of the order.&lt;br /&gt;The headbands are very well made and so far are holding up!  The girls love them!!  The choice of colors was vast!</li>
    <li> I bought these as Easter basket gifts and, the girls love them. In sure I&#x27;ll be buying more for stocking stuffers.</li>
    <li> I love all of my headbands!! What a great deal!!</li>
    <li> I bought these for my son&#x27;s High School softball team for the playoffs. Not only did the vendor get them to me earlier than stated the girls loved them. They sparkled under the field lights at night. Would definitely recommend them to anyone.</li>
    <li> These are just okay. They were still a little too big for my daughter&#x27;s 3 and 5. They are too tight for me. They are somewhat cute but also sort of cheap looking. They slide off easily too so they didn&#x27;t exactly work all that well for us. The customer service is very nice though. This is just a product that did not work out for us.</li>
    <li> If I could give no stars I would! These cheap things are suppose to grip the hair to stay in place, yay right! Minutes after it&#x27;s placed on the head it begins to creep backwards. Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
    <li> I coach a girls softball team.  I bought them all a headband with our team color, since they all wear protective facemasks in the field now and can&#x27;t fit a visor. This brings the uniform together and they like the zebra print.</li>
    <li> I really like the headbands, but they slip off my head easily. Some of the glitter sheds on a few other headbands, but that doesn&#x27;t bother me.</li>
    <li> Bought just a single one so I could see if they work for me I like this kind more than the other sequins head band stays on better I love them I wear them to all of my softball games and I have thick hair</li>
    <li> The headbands are great!  They have a nice thick band that holds the hair in place. We will purchase more for sure!</li>
    <li> i only gave it 4 stars because the colors are great other than that not so great...quality is sub par but hey i did pay about $1 a piece for them.  they arent soft like the expensive material sweaty bands...these are almost like flexible card stock. ok but wouldnt purchase again</li>
    <li> My daughter loves these bands. She can wear them with anything. Every pre teen is into band&#x27;s and they don&#x27;t slip off</li>
    <li> I ordered these and then wanted to switch out a color, they emailed me saying they caught it in time and could switch it iut. They came 2 days early, couldn&#x27;t be happier!</li>
    <li> I bought these for the junior high volleyball team I coach. The girls really liked the headband, but they slipped off during play. If they pinned the headband it would stay on. The headband is good quality and the glitter does not come off.</li>
    <li> Just as it was pictured and plenty of sparkles to make any little girl happy. Work perfectly for non slippery hair.</li>
    <li> I really liked how easy it was to buy from these sellers. The product is great! My girls loved their headbands, and what&#x27;s even better is that the actually stay on! I will definitely be buying from them again!</li>
    <li> These items came in within a week just in time for what I needed it for. The timing couldn&#x27;t have been better and I like how they asked what color I wanted instead of just randomly sending anything</li>
    <li> These headbands fit perfectly on my softball team of 8 to 10 yr olds. I got the hot pink headbands</li>
    <li> These were great! I purchased them for pre-tournament gift bags for a softball team.  The girls loved them--they added just a hint of sparkle to their uniforms under the lights of the field.  Great price!</li>
    <li> It was so nice to be able to pick ALL my colors. Price was right, super fast shipping. I will definetly order from her again. Thanks</li>
    <li> They are not as &amp;#34;sturdy&amp;#34; as I thought they would be but my girls love them</li>
    <li> Fantastic!! My 12 year old daughter wears one about everyday. I have ordered them several times.Great value for the money and quick Shipping. Getting ready to order 24 more now to get us ready for the school year.</li>
    <li> Eh my kids did not like these. They sit weird on their heads</li>
    <li> Great product! Would highly recommend! These headbands last a long time and are very comfortable! They look great as well! My daughter uses these in all sports and they stay in place nicely!</li>
    <li> My daughter wanted this type of headband and this seller had the largest selection.  There were so many different colors and patterns  to choose from and she loves them all!  They are very popular and her friends wanted to know where she bought them.  The price was very reasonable and they were here within a week.  I would highly recommend these headbands to everyone.</li>
    <li> I purchased these for my 7 year old and am very happy with them.  She loves them and they are ideal for holding back her bangs that she is trying to grow out.  Plus, the sparkly colors are awesome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She participates in gymnastics and we purchased them for that, but unfortunately, they slide off her head when she is on bars or is doing active floor skills like handsprings.  So I am not sure they are great for the little ones for sports (that involve being upside down!), but they are super cute.  I am thinking they would work on older kids for gymnastics though.  She wears them to school pretty much every day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great item - definitely suggest buying this - great item, cant beat the price</li>
    <li> $12 for all of these headbands is a great deal. They really keep the hair out of my daughters face and we love all the different colors we chose.</li>
    <li> I love how you can mix in match, or order all the same! The VB players loved them!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve got these several times! They always come on time, individually wrapped, so great for gifts! But also they are great quality and I use them For sports and my entire team!</li>
    <li> Very Sparkly and cute we bought them for our T-Ball team the girls love them they have held up well!</li>
    <li> My daughter has worn these a few times each, and so far 4 of them have come apart where the elastic is glued to the headband.  I have glued them back and added a small stitch to each one.  I think if a stitch was put in when these are being made, this could be avoided.  Otherwise, very cute and colorful headbands.</li>
    <li> They were not what I expected they were just cheap glittery paper  and the bands at back were tolarge</li>
    <li> My daughter loved all the colors I chose for her.  The quality was good considering the reasonable price I paid.  Would order from this company again</li>
    <li> My daughter wears them all the time.... good quality!</li>
    <li> The designs and colors of these are cute, but they didn&#x27;t work for the purpose I intended them for.  Only the back black band is elastic. The rest of the band is a stiff material, not stretchy.  I returned them but didn&#x27;t receive a refund.</li>
    <li> Such nice headbands. I ordered 12 various colors and received every color i asked for. They don&#x27;t have velvet backing but they do still stay in and i have very slippery thin hair. If you are having an issue with them staying in put a little hot glue on the back and let it dry it will help them stay on :) Some of my favorite colors are the white and blue and silver. The ordered was shipped and got to me 3 days early with no problems and very professional packaging. And did i mention how cheap these were?? I&#x27;m definitely ordering more very soon.</li>
    <li> I was looking for headbands that weren&#x27;t too binding on my 11-year old daughter&#x27;s head and these fit the bill.  She loved that she could select the colors.  They are well made and look great on.  My daughter wears them practically every day.  Look great on their own or with a pony tail.  Highly recommend.  Seller was very responsive and sent the headbands very quickly.  We will continue buying them.</li>
    <li> Super great seller so easy to communicate with! The headbands are super cute and they sent just the colors I asked for. My cheer leaders loved wearing them for their performance! Thank you Kenz Laurenz for a great buying experience.</li>
    <li> Purchased the headbands for my 7 year old niece. She wanted sparkly headbands and she loves them!! They even arrived early!</li>
    <li> I never a massage to pick my colors</li>
    <li> AWESOME products and great value! These are VERY cute headbands, are comfortable for the girls and look adorable on them! The seller gives you the option of choosing which ones you want though honestly all of them are perfect!! Great product and great follow up by seller on product. Would buy again and recommend strongly!</li>
    <li> I love the way they are comfortable to wear and come in so many great colors and patterns. they go with everything</li>
    <li> Fast delivery and excellent headbands! Won my first 5k in one of these, maybe they bring luck?</li>
    <li> I got these for my 12 yr old niece and she was sooooo excited about them. Loved the sparkly ones and the animal prints!</li>
    <li> The product was exactly as it was described but it is more of a hair accessory for a little girl and not for an adult. I gave it to my friend and her daughter loved it</li>
    <li> these are great and very appealing to the eye.  She plays a lot of softball and they hold her hair back and super bling.</li>
    <li> Very cute, shipped on time. But not athletic in the sense that they move when in activity.</li>
    <li> My daughter was thrilled to receive these in her stocking. They are glittery and perfect for girls. My favorite are the ones with the stars. I bought this for my 5 year old and they were just slightly too big, but it is doable. Great price. Worth the money.</li>
    <li> These are a great value. They are not as well made as some- these do not have the velvet lining that similar products do. Still these are a great value and fit well. I wear them for exercise and the have held up to lots of sweat. I recommend these and love all the choices.</li>
    <li> Have a mixed review on these headbands. Truth is for the price you can&#x27;t beat it. The quality is not as good as I expected, but once again for the price it&#x27;s a great deal. I emailed the company once I ordered and chose my colors and that is exactly what they sent us. The purple kind of looks more like a pink. The headbands did ship quickly. Overall we were satisfied.</li>
    <li> I got these for my granddaughter because I could pick twelve different colors for a great price. She loved them. The way they shimmer was a big hit. She is concerned that they may slide back so that is one thing I am unsure of. Otherwise they would be a five star.</li>
    <li> So far these are the only headbands I have worn that have not gotten uncomfortable after a few hours or given me headaches. They offer a huge selection of colors and the bands are very durable. You really cant beat this product especially for the price.</li>
    <li> I did not realize the seller would count act me by amazon messaging and I kept continually checking my personal email, Panicked I contacted the seller.  Minutes later I stumble (literally) upon their message to me requesting a response as to which colors I wanted!  They had sent the message the day I placed the order! I then message them again and explained what happened and to my suprize they were still very friendly and did not act annoyed at all! I am very impressed with there service and will recommend them to all of my friends!</li>
    <li> Our Granddaughter loves hairbands and these were perfect!  She loved the assortment of colors and that they all sparkle!  Customer service was excellent and delivery was very fast!</li>
    <li> I thought I had reviewed these after I purchased, but just realized I didn&#x27;t.  These are great and you can&#x27;t beat them for the price.  There are so many choices and I enjoy having so many to choose from everyday with such a small investment.  The customer service from this seller was awesome and shipment was so quick! Please give them a try - you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
    <li> Im very disappointed in these :( These are my second purchase from this company and both slip off my head after wearing for only a few minutes. Ive even put hot glue on the inside to give it some grip, and it doesn&#x27;t work. NOT HAPPY.</li>
    <li> I purchased these for my 10 yr. old volleyball team and they loved them! the headband fit everyone and they looked great with their uniform, I would definitely buy from Kenz Laurenz again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so surprised that these actually fit right.  Usually cheap headbands are crap, but I love these. Really cute too.</li>
    <li> I love these headbands, they are my favorite head bands I wear them more then anything. I&#x27;ve even thought about buying more.</li>
    <li> The headbands were delivered promptly and as seller promised (I had a specialized order). Also, sellers communication/response was excellent.&lt;br /&gt;The issue I have is that the headbands&#x27; quality was did not meet my expectations.  They are very cute and my girls loved them while they lasted but they didn&#x27;t last long. The elastic pulls away from the glitter part of the headband with hardly any use.  My daughter is not tough with these headbands at all.  Considering we purchased an assortment pack and three of them already came apart, should tell you what kind of quality you&#x27;re getting with this product. It&#x27;s really unfortunate because they&#x27;re very cute headbands.</li>
    <li> I purchased these headbands for my daughters gymnastics meet.  Each girl had to bring something for their teammates to add to the goodie bags and we chose these.  They were a HUGE hit!  The girls LOVED them.  I placed my order and actually did the quick shipping because I was ordering them last minute.  I sent them a message letting them know which headbands we wanted.  The seller responded in record time and the headbands were received just as quickly!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So happy with our purchase and would highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Super fast delivery. Not as thick as some I&#x27;ve seen in stores, but i can&#x27;t see these breaking, and the price is unbeatable.</li>
    <li> very bad quality and never stay on my hair</li>
    <li> They all fit and stay on...which is a huge plus!  They look great as well!&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for a great product!</li>
    <li> Very quick shipping!!  Great headbands by 9 year old daughter loves them!</li>
    <li> My girls loved them. Super cute. Bought them for my daughters softball team. They loved them so much my older daughter wanted them for her softball team also.</li>
    <li> I just purchased these headbands and am waiting to receive them. I am excited about receiving them already.  I placed the order and the seller sent an email to me so that I can place my color choices with them. There is a vast selection to choose from.  I had GREAT DIFFICULTY wondering what colors to choose. I&#x27;m amazed at the low cost of a 12 - pack of headbands. I know I&#x27;m going to be a very satisfied customer.</li>
    <li> One kid likes them so she got them all, the other one not so much.</li>
    <li> The girls loved them!</li>
    <li> Bought 12 for my girls volleyball team. They look and wear extremely well for sports. Arrived on time at a great price. With two daughters I will definitely be ordering more.</li>
    <li> Daughters love them, great variety.</li>
    <li> my daughter loves them</li>
    <li> i have to give these 5 stars.  daughter picked out the colors, they arrived quickly too.  they seem cheap looking but seem to hold up to normal wear.  for the price I&#x27;m not expecting too much but so far they are great!</li>
    <li> very cheap. Don&#x27;t fit well on a adult head.</li>
    <li> Well worth it for the price. Great, prompt service with color selection.</li>
    <li> Awesome product!!! I definitely would recommend this to my friends!!!</li>
    <li> The headbands were super cute!  I bought two sets for my daughter&#x27;s volleyball team.  Great price!  Will order again!</li>
