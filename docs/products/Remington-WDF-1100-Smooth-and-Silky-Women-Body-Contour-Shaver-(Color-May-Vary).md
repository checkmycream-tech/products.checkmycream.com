<ol>
      <li>Great shaver!</li>
      <li>after trying it out i found this to be one of the best shavers i have ever used.</li>
      <li>IT&#x27;S A GREAT RAZOR!</li>
      <li>I use rechargable batteries, its working great!  </li>
      <li>It works great.  </li>
      <li>I had one for years and is great</li>
      <li>lol it shaves to your skin</li>
      <li>Absolutely love this razor!</li>
      <li>I tried it on my underarms though, and it kind of stung.  </li>
      <li>I love this shaver.</li>
      <li>Its battery operated, which I love.  </li>
      <li>In convenience an electric is much better than any blade-</li>
      <li>This is an okay shaver.</li>
      <li>, that is why I order two more.</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t be fooled by this shaver&#x27;s cute exterior.</li>
      <li>I give it a three because it does do a pretty good job on the legs.&lt;br /&gt;Given</li>
      <li>I found the wet shave (lather up) gives the best results on both under-arm area and legs.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s about convenience for me, and feeling smooth.</li>
      <li>and I was all excited to use it because I always wanted an electric shaver.</li>
      <li>It shaves so closely, and quickly.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s water proof, easy to clean and allows a very close shave.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve bought other electric razors, and this so far is the best.</li>
      <li>the results I probably will investigate shaver comparisons to find a better one for sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>/&gt;The only thing that this shaver is good for is if u go somewhere on vacation and u won&#x27;t be near a sink  for a while.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
      <li>This really does the work!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had other razors and believe me, this one is the most reliable on I&#x27;ve had!</li>
      <li>Battery life is acceptable, power is good, and just a few swipes is all you need.</li>
      <li>Does really well the first few months, after that, not so good.</li>
      <li>You really can&#x27;t compare a blade razor to an electric-</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m just getting ready to replace the foils and cutters.</li>
      <li>I dropped it once and the whole thing came apart spilling out the batteries.</li>
      <li>Even after adjusting and cleaning it would leave stubble in it&#x27;s path rather than the smooth, silky skin a standard razor produces.</li>
      <li>This razor, however, has a better level of shaving than other electrics, closer to a blade than the others.</li>
      <li>This so called &amp;quot;shaver&amp;quot; does ok on legs, but stubble comes back the next day.</li>
      <li>i would highly recommend this item.</li>
      <li>cored ones are hard to find and you have to have a plug handy.</li>
      <li>If you&#x27;ve got dark hair and light skin, you may want to continue using a non-electric.</li>
      <li>I just use it everyday to keep my legs smooth and soft.</li>
      <li>for now I&#x27;m going back to shaving with a razor, much closer shave and lasts a LOT longer.</li>
      <li>My old shaver stopped charging because of the metal continuously going farther from the connection.  </li>
      <li>I actually do have dark hair and light skin, but I don&#x27;t care.</li>
      <li>My only complaint is that it costs as much to replace the cutters (which come with a new foil as well) as it does to buy a new razor.</li>

<li> It only takes 2 AA batteries and if you use rechargeables, you hardly ever have to buy batteries or worry about running out of charge.</li>
<li> and I have to shave over the area like 4 times and it just irritates my skin and pulls my hairs even if they are little stubs.</li>
<li> This shaver is extremely irritating and also rusted almost instantly.</li>

<li> It sucks on the bikini area as well.</li>
<li> It hardly does shave any hair of my legs and leaves a lot of painful red scars.</li>

<li> I got tired of all the shavers losing its charging capability.  </li>
<li> In the shower it works even worse.</li>
<li> I had this product 7 years ago, but needed to replace it, but I was unable to find it in the department store.</li>
<li> I was unable to turn the unit on or off once the batteries were installed.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;ve stopped using it on my armpits because it was really uncomfortable.</li>
<li> they are not yet comparable for cutting or time used.</li>
<li> (maybe the people who had one that pinches or hurts them got a bad one?)</li>
<li> This shaver chews up my armpits so badly I can&#x27;t wear deodorant.  </li>
<li> God was this thing horrible!</li>
<li> Very poor shaver!!!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> This shaver is extremely irritating and also rusted almost instantly. Wet-dry ... not! Buy anything else before this product.</li>
    <li> I need to check when I purchased this item because I will never use it again and I only used it once. I would like to return it.  When I used it to shave under my arms it cut me. It is so harsh you need to use it very gingerly and even so it still knicks the skin.</li>
    <li> this product was not quite what i was looking for  thought had a chargere this one does not  but does the job.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product for use in between shavings when I just feel like a touch up.  It works great.  I tried it on my underarms though, and it kind of stung.  But when I tried again, it didn&#x27;t.  So I dont know whether that was just from the product or some other factor.  Its battery operated, which I love.  I got tired of all the shavers losing its charging capability.  My old shaver stopped charging because of the metal continuously going farther from the connection.  So it finally died.  Wont happen with this one!  I use rechargable batteries, its working great!  I recommend this product to anyone!</li>
    <li> I have had mine for several years and I&#x27;m just getting ready to replace the foils and cutters. I have NEVER been nicked before so no problems there and yeah i have stubble the day after but who wouldn&#x27;t it&#x27;s not a hair puller lol it shaves to your skin I just use it everyday to keep my legs smooth and soft. I also have no problems using this on my ampits no red bumps or anything    IT&#x27;S A GREAT RAZOR!</li>
    <li> Bought three. The on/off button on one will not shut off, so my wife has to pull the batteries out to shut it off.</li>
    <li> I have used this shaver for over 3 years with no problems at all.  I found the wet shave (lather up) gives the best results on both under-arm area and legs.  Use the pop up trimmer on longer hair- as hair will just glide under the foil if you try to shave without it.  Of course its not as close as a blade- because its not a blade.  My only complaint is that it costs as much to replace the cutters (which come with a new foil as well) as it does to buy a new razor.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t be fooled by this shaver&#x27;s cute exterior. This so called &amp;quot;shaver&amp;quot; does ok on legs, but stubble comes back the next day. I would not recommend trying it on armpits, it hurts and leaves red marks all over - after that you can&#x27;t even put on deodorant! It sucks on the bikini area as well. And not to mention the amount of noise this lil&#x27; thing produces. In the shower it works even worse. I dropped it once and the whole thing came apart spilling out the batteries. I am totally dissapointed with it.&lt;br /&gt;The only thing that this shaver is good for is if u go somewhere on vacation and u won&#x27;t be near a sink  for a while.&lt;br /&gt;But for now I&#x27;m going back to shaving with a razor, much closer shave and lasts a LOT longer.</li>
    <li> This is an okay shaver. It does get rid of some of the hair on my legs but there are always a few stray hairs left and I have stubble a day or two after. I&#x27;ve stopped using it on my armpits because it was really uncomfortable.</li>
    <li> Well I have used Philips LadyShave before,and I regret for making my mind to try this one...It hardly does shave any hair of my legs and leaves a lot of painful red scars.</li>
    <li> i bought this shaver because i didnt want a rechargable, the batteries slowing run out of juice after a while. cored ones are hard to find and you have to have a plug handy. with this shaver you just need 2 AA batteries. after trying it out i found this to be one of the best shavers i have ever used. unlike others i have not gotten any nicks or cuts from it yet and the shave is quite close. i would highly recommend this item.</li>
    <li> This shaver chews up my armpits so badly I can&#x27;t wear deodorant.  I give it a three because it does do a pretty good job on the legs.&lt;br /&gt;Given the results I probably will investigate shaver comparisons to find a better one for sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> Using this on my legs feels like electric shocks because of how it pulls and chews. I wouldn&#x27;t dare use it on my underarms. Very poor shaver!!!</li>
    <li> Not a good razor:(&lt;br /&gt;I bought it so I wouldn&#x27;t have to do a contortionist act to shave in my tiny dorm shower, but in fact it&#x27;s easier to balance a leg on a shampoo bottle or hike it on the wall rather than spend 30+ shaving your legs with this inefficient razor. Even after adjusting and cleaning it would leave stubble in it&#x27;s path rather than the smooth, silky skin a standard razor produces.</li>
    <li> I love this shaver. It&#x27;s water proof, easy to clean and allows a very close shave.  I had this product 7 years ago, but needed to replace it, but I was unable to find it in the department store. Needless to say I was glad to see Amazon carried it so I immediately ordered it and I have used it a couple of times.</li>
    <li> Great shaver! I prefer using the battery style. It only takes 2 AA batteries and if you use rechargeables, you hardly ever have to buy batteries or worry about running out of charge.</li>
    <li> You get what you pay for. Does really well the first few months, after that, not so good.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this razor! Thank you!</li>
    <li> I had one for years and is great, that is why I order two more.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had other razors and believe me, this one is the most reliable on I&#x27;ve had! It works well, does NOT hurt? (maybe the people who had one that pinches or hurts them got a bad one?) A feature I like and use often is the head pops up to cut longer hair...unfortunately at times I need this before I use the regular cutter. Battery life is acceptable, power is good, and just a few swipes is all you need. You really can&#x27;t compare a blade razor to an electric- they are not yet comparable for cutting or time used. This razor, however, has a better level of shaving than other electrics, closer to a blade than the others. In convenience an electric is much better than any blade- you can use it anywhere, dry, just sittin&#x27; around!</li>
    <li> I returned this product.  I was unable to turn the unit on or off once the batteries were installed.  The batteries blocked the on/off switch from the internal switch.</li>
    <li> My husband bought this shaver for me for christmas and I was all excited to use it because I always wanted an electric shaver. God was this thing horrible! It pulls my hairs, and doesn&#x27;t shave anything at all and I have to shave over the area like 4 times and it just irritates my skin and pulls my hairs even if they are little stubs. I would not recommend this to anyone. I am getting rid of mine and using my husband&#x27;s electric shaver instead.</li>
    <li> This really does the work! It shaves so closely, and quickly. If you&#x27;ve got dark hair and light skin, you may want to continue using a non-electric. I actually do have dark hair and light skin, but I don&#x27;t care. It&#x27;s about convenience for me, and feeling smooth. I&#x27;ve bought other electric razors, and this so far is the best. No question.</li>
