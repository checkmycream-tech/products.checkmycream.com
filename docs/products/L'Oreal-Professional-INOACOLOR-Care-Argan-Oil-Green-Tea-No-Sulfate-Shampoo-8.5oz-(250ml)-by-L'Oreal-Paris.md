      <li>Ever since my stylist introduced me to INOACOLOR, I have been in love.</li>
      <li>Does the job but probably better for virgin hair.</li>
      <li>I will continue to use it as it allows my color to remain bright and fresh for many weeks.</li>
      <li>So far I have been really happy with the results I get with it.</li>
      <li>It is the most gentle permanent color available and the colors are pure, brilliant and shiny.</li>
      <li>Since I began using it, my fine hair has gotten stronger, thicker, and longer.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t have sulfates so there isn&#x27;t as much lather when you shampoo, but it still does a nice job.</li>
      <li>I found this shampoo at my local salon and was happy with everything except the price.  </li>
      <li>Very nice product and my color seems to last longer when I use it.  </li>
      <li>My hair never feels clean and the stand up tube is bulky to use.</li>
      <li>It lathers with hardly any product needing to be used, smells great and leaves my hair very easy to manage.</li>
      <li>I need a fresh clean.  </li>
      <li>The scent was much too strong and I didn&#x27;t like</li>
      <li>Used it before and really like it for fine, colored hair.  </li>

      <li>It produces a rich lather which I really like too.</li>
      <li>The color lasts a full 8 weeks thanks to these products</li>
      <li>I highly recommend it!!</li>
      <li>I have tried many different shampoos over the years.  </li>
      <li>it keeps my color looking vibrant and gives my hair a lot of bounce!</li>

      <li>It also smells really fresh and leaves the hair feeling soft.</li>
      <li>is gentle and is color enhancing.</li>
      <li>The smell is refreshing and unlike other high quality shampoos it doesn&#x27;t leave a heaviness or oily residue.  </li>
      <li>My color, almost 4 weeks old, washed a minimum of 4 times a week, is luxe, soft and in super condition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This seems like a decent product.  </li>
      <li>Leaves my hair very soft!</li>
      <li>I was using high end shampoos that were supposed to keep the color.  </li>
      <li>jaded from high priced color protection products that do nothing</li>
      <li>so I was really just trying something new to try something new.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s so thick that I can pull my hair into an amazing shower shark.  </li>
      <li>the Argon oil makes my hair very shiny and soft.  </li>
      <li>At that point I had just assumed my fading was normal</li>
      <li>I mean nothing spectacular.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using it through 2 colorings now and the results are exactly the same.  </li>
      <li>I really can&#x27;t say enough about this shampoo...</li>
      <li>Works very well with the conditioner in the same series unless your hair is oily.</li>
      <li>Keeps my hair soft and moisturized without adding build up.</li>
      <li>I have been having my hair professionally colored with Loreal Professional INOA hair color for 5 years.</li>
      <li>My hair barely fades at all between colorings.  </li>
      <li>My hair is medium thick n lightly processed.</li>
      <li>I have very thick, wavy hair and this shampoo cleans it and makes it soft and smooth.</li>
      <li>Loreal, I&#x27;ve discredited you for far too long.</li>
      <li>I would give this product five stars also because it was less that half the price I paid for it at the salon, or available on-line.  </li>
      <li>This shampoo really helped to make my hair less greasy.</li>

<li> This shampoo really helped to make my hair less greasy.</li>
<li> Also, because I have frizzy-wavy-thick like hair, I use a lot of deep conditioning products and blow dry it quite a bit.</li>
<li> I have long hair that is pretty thick</li>
<li> I was curious about the Inoa shampoo and conditioner and ordered both from 2 different vendors on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> A little goes a long way, it feels like the bottle lasts forever.</li>
<li> My color lasts for a lot longer than with other shampoos.</li>
<li> First off, I have never been aboard the expensive hair products train before.  </li>
<li> This shampoo is made specifically for INOA Color treated hair, but can be used on hair colored by other color treatments.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve been coloring my hair for the last few years and have been frustrated with how quickly the color would fade.  </li>
<li> It did ship in late October (finally)</li>
<li> It was not real product, you must check what you sell!!!</li>
<li> With some shampoos, I would shampoo, and condition, and then once I dried my hair after my hair would still feel greasy around the roots.</li>
<li> Less fading!</li>
<li> I have very long thin and frizzy hair, this shampoo does not make it frizz less</li>
<li> Finding a salon that used Inoacolor was hard here in the northern part of Michigan.</li>
<li> There is a serious difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> I found it to be much less expensive on Amazon.  </li>
<li> It must be coming on a very slow boat from China.</li>
<li> Or for thin hair.</li>
<li> so anything too heavy or anything that leaves and oily shine makes my hair look dirty and dingy.  </li>
<li> I had dabbled in expensive products, using some Bumble &amp; Bumble or Joico here and there, but this shampoo changed everything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> (like you just got your hair washed at an expensive salon).  </li>
<li> Clearly a fake product.</li>
<li> I was even washing my hair in cold water but nothing worked.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I have been using this for over a year now and love this shampoo. Suggested to me by my colorist, I did not have to look for another shampoo again since :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Clears spray and mousse residue well without drying your hair. Works very well with the conditioner in the same series unless your hair is oily. My hair is a bit oily, so I skip this conditioner on alternate washes when I use one of the Aveda conditioners.</li>
    <li> Clearly a fake product. I am throwing it away because I think it damaged my hair. I have used the salon version of this product, I know what it should be like.</li>
    <li> Good, non sulfate product.</li>
    <li> Great shampoo for color treated hair.  Less fading!</li>
    <li> I have been having my hair professionally colored with Loreal Professional INOA hair color for 5 years. It is the most gentle permanent color available and the colors are pure, brilliant and shiny. Non damaging to one&#x27;s hair. This shampoo is made specifically for INOA Color treated hair, but can be used on hair colored by other color treatments. This is an excellent color protecting shampoo.  It lathers very well, smells great. is gentle and is color enhancing. I will continue to use it as it allows my color to remain bright and fresh for many weeks.</li>
    <li> My colorist uses Loreal Inoa products. I was curious about the Inoa shampoo and conditioner and ordered both from 2 different vendors on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m jaded from high priced color protection products that do nothing but this stuff gets big kudos. My color, almost 4 weeks old, washed a minimum of 4 times a week, is luxe, soft and in super condition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wow. Loreal, I&#x27;ve discredited you for far too long. This stuff is amazing.</li>
    <li> First off, I have never been aboard the expensive hair products train before.  I honestly did not know why people blow $20 on a bottle of shampoo when you can get a bottle for $4 at the drug store.  I had dabbled in expensive products, using some Bumble &amp; Bumble or Joico here and there, but this shampoo changed everything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m on the train now.  There is a serious difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This shampoo feels SO good.  It&#x27;s creamy and lathers well, especially for a sulfate-free shampoo.  It&#x27;s so thick that I can pull my hair into an amazing shower shark.  It smells great (like you just got your hair washed at an expensive salon).  This was recommended to me by my hair stylist (at said expensive salon), and I am in love.  Since I began using it, my fine hair has gotten stronger, thicker, and longer.</li>
    <li> I would rate this five stars, because I&#x27;ve used it before and it&#x27;s amazing for hair that has been dyed.  My hair barely fades at all between colorings.  I would give this product five stars also because it was less that half the price I paid for it at the salon, or available on-line.  However, it gets ONE star from me.  I ordered it on October 3rd.  It&#x27;s now November 8 and I still haven&#x27;t gotten it!!!  It did ship in late October (finally) but they gave me over a month-long range to receive it and no tracking number.  It must be coming on a very slow boat from China.</li>
    <li> This product is wonderful and leaves your hair feeling lush and strong. It also helps retain the color for weeks longer.</li>
    <li> I found this shampoo at my local salon and was happy with everything except the price.  I found it to be much less expensive on Amazon.  It is really great for color treated hair and the Argon oil makes my hair very shiny and soft.  You also don&#x27;t need to use much of it.  I have long hair that is pretty thick and I use a squeeze about the size of a nickel.</li>
    <li> Very nice product and my color seems to last longer when I use it.  It doesn&#x27;t have sulfates so there isn&#x27;t as much lather when you shampoo, but it still does a nice job.</li>
    <li> I have very thick, wavy hair and this shampoo cleans it and makes it soft and smooth. I would purchase again.</li>
    <li> Keeps my hair color lasting, but doesn&#x27;t suds well and I feel like I need to use ALOT of it. I will keep buying it though.</li>
    <li> It was not real product, you must check what you sell!!!</li>
    <li> Ever since my stylist introduced me to INOACOLOR, I have been in love. It smells soooo good and I feel like I&#x27;m at the salon every time I use it. It produces a rich lather which I really like too. I really can&#x27;t say enough about this shampoo... it keeps my color looking vibrant and gives my hair a lot of bounce! It is every bit worth the price tag.</li>
    <li> Just started using this shampoo. This shampoo was recommended by my hairdresser. So far I have been really happy with the results I get with it. Believe it deserves the 5 star rating.</li>
    <li> Used it before and really like it for fine, colored hair.  Cheaper at Amazon than the salon.</li>
    <li> I love this product. For quite some time I switched through numerous shampoos, until I came across this one. The two things I need in a shampoo is for it to be sulfate-free because I highlight my hair, as well as helping my hair to be non-greasy. This shampoo helped with both. My color lasts for a lot longer than with other shampoos. Also, because I have frizzy-wavy-thick like hair, I use a lot of deep conditioning products and blow dry it quite a bit. I also exercise a ton.. leaving my hair always greasy. This shampoo really helped to make my hair less greasy. With some shampoos, I would shampoo, and condition, and then once I dried my hair after my hair would still feel greasy around the roots. This does not happen anymore because I now use this shampoo. It also smells really fresh and leaves the hair feeling soft. I will never switch shampoos. This is a must for anyone with color treated, frizzy, greasy, or any related type of hair!</li>
    <li> This seems like a decent product.  I do like it.  Will I buy it again? I may try it again and pair with the conditioner to see how I like the two together?</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been coloring my hair for the last few years and have been frustrated with how quickly the color would fade.  I was using high end shampoos that were supposed to keep the color.  I was even washing my hair in cold water but nothing worked.  Then the receptionist at my salon told me to try INOACOLOR.  At that point I had just assumed my fading was normal so I was really just trying something new to try something new.  Surprise...surprise!!!!  Ever since I&#x27;ve used this shampoo there has literally been NO FADING!!!!  I&#x27;ve been using it through 2 colorings now and the results are exactly the same.  My color looks like I just came from the salon!  Now if only I could do something about the roots...ha!</li>
    <li> My hair never feels clean and the stand up tube is bulky to use.</li>
    <li> I love this INOA haircare line from L&#x27;Oreal. It is nice that huge companies like L&#x27;Oreal are offering products with no sulfates. It works great to help lock the color in your hair. I highly recommend it!!</li>
    <li> Suds up and no sulfates. Finally a good combo that way. Smells great! Leaves no residues that I have noticed at all</li>
    <li> Very good safe shampoo for color treated hair. Gives hair a nice shine and retains the color.</li>
    <li> Finding a salon that used Inoacolor was hard here in the northern part of Michigan. I found one in Traverse City and now I am delighted to be able to get the shampoo and conditioner to keep it fresh. This helps keep the color from fading. I will keep using it. The color lasts a full 8 weeks thanks to these products</li>
    <li> Keeps my hair soft and moisturized without adding build up. A little goes a long way, it feels like the bottle lasts forever.</li>
    <li> This shampoo is sulfate free and smells great! Leaves my hair very soft! This is my second purchase of this shampoo.</li>
    <li> The scent was much too strong and I didn&#x27;t like the result was what it advertised !!&lt;br /&gt;Do not bother spending your $$$$$.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok. I mean nothing spectacular. Does the job but probably better for virgin hair. Or for thin hair. My hair is medium thick n lightly processed. A bit disappointed</li>
    <li> I have very long thin and frizzy hair, this shampoo does not make it frizz less but sure it feels much better than the others I tried. I gave it 4 stars bcz the others I tried were all cheaper and maybe in this price range I could have found something else. This is what my hair stylist suggested, and after using 2 tubes I am still happy with it.</li>
    <li> I have tried many different shampoos over the years.  This shampoo, in my opinion, is the best I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
    <li> arrived as promised and well packaged</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo.  It lathers with hardly any product needing to be used, smells great and leaves my hair very easy to manage.</li>
    <li> This shampoo is heaven.  The smell is refreshing and unlike other high quality shampoos it doesn&#x27;t leave a heaviness or oily residue.  I have blonde hair so anything too heavy or anything that leaves and oily shine makes my hair look dirty and dingy.  I need a fresh clean.  This is absolutely amazing.  My hair is so happy using this product!</li>
    <li> Love the price and quality of this product!</li>
