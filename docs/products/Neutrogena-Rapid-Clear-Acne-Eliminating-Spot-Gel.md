      <li>Will continue to purchase, worked on even the most stubborn acne.  </li>
      <li>This worked okay for me.</li>
      <li>This is a great spot gel that really clears things up without making you feel like it&#x27;s drying it into a desert.</li>
      <li>She used it longer than me and on more area of her face.</li>
      <li>I am really pleased by this product for aid in this way.  </li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t leave any flaky or crusty layer on your skin, so you can put makeup over top of it with no problem.</li>
      <li>(And they are across more skin than the spot treatment was put on.)</li>
      <li>She did say that she thought it works pretty good.</li>
      <li>She did say that it cleared up her break outs pretty good</li>
      <li>The Neutrogena Rapid Clear works great on my stubborn spots.  </li>
      <li>Rapid Clear is a great replacement for Proactiv&#x27;s spot treatment.</li>
      <li>It makes the redness go away very quickly.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used it several times, always with great results.</li>
      <li>I applied to a clean face twice a day on the spots as they were forming and some of them disappeared literally within hours.</li>
      <li>But it&#x27;s not to say it doesn&#x27;t help; it does, but there&#x27;s nothing special about this one to me.</li>
      <li>Neutrogena Rapid Clear Stubborn Acne Spot Gel is a really effective acne treatment.</li>
      <li>My skin looked better 100% because of this product and for that reason, I highly recommend.</li>
      <li>When I saw this product I thought it was worth a try.</li>
      <li>Maybe better for teenagers instead of adult acne.</li>
      <li>It shrinks pimples pretty quickly and lessens the redness as well.</li>
      <li>Look at how it&#x27;s cleared up my face.&amp;#34; And she was right.</li>
      <li>Menopause actually calmed my skin totally down, and it was wonderful.  </li>
      <li>I was pretty impressed because I remember back when I was a young teen, fretting when I got a blemish on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This gel did seem to clear them up faster than normal but not as fast as I would have liked.</li>
      <li>I will be purchasing both through Amazon in the future, because the price is better here than anywhere else I have checked.</li>
      <li>I am totally in love with this product and would definitely re-purchase</li>
      <li>For the first 25 years, a dermatologist treated me with doxycycline which marginally worked.  </li>
      <li>First Neutrogena product I have ever had a problem with.</li>
      <li>Today, the fifth day of use, I notice that areas where I have applied Rapid Clear are now warm to the touch and itch, and the redness has actually spread, so I will be discontinuing use immediately.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Regardless, it does work very well.</li>
      <li>She said, &amp;#34;Gramma, that gel really works.</li>
      <li>Though the breakouts are minimal they still are unsightly which makes me love this product.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;In terms of the blackheads, it didn&#x27;t help much.  </li>
      <li>We used to subscribe to Proactiv&#x27;s delivery, but now just uses acne free on a daily basis instead of the proactiv 3 step and this product for breakouts.</li>
      <li>She used the gel for a week, putting the gel on a couple times a day for the whole week.</li>
      <li>This worked really well for my PMS breakouts.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall highly recommend the spot gel!</li>
      <li>I will say it never got bigger even after a full day of make up, and it was gone within a couple days.</li>
      <li>Highly recommended.</li>
      <li>, I was curious if it really was true that it reduces size and redness in 2 hours.  </li>
      <li>As far as size, I can&#x27;t really say for sure, it was small to begin with.</li>
      <li>As a mom, I don&#x27;t really get break outs anymore but as much as I don&#x27;t like to admit, I do get the occasional pimple.</li>
      <li>Neutrogena makes good products, and not sure how much the brand means outside of the active ingredient (Benzoyl Peroxide in this</li>
      <li>And no burning to my already super sensitive skin like other products.</li>
      <li>Let me preface my remarks about Rapid Clear spot gel by stating that if you have chronic skin problems, see a dermatologist.  </li>
      <li>was hoping that the Neutrogena Rapid Clear Stubborn Ance Spot Gel would help with both those issues.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I will be steering clear of anything with benzoyl peroxide in it from now on just in case, although I don&#x27;t recall ever having a reaction to it before.</li>
      <li>Her complexion was almost completely clear.</li>
      <li>Try to catch them early, as it works the fastest when you can almost prevent it from coming all the way out.</li>
      <li>Some of this spot gel can nearly stop them before they start.  </li>
      <li>I bought this for my son who is 20 years old.</li>
      <li>My chin has cleared up considerably, and with once per day it&#x27;s not too drying.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m an adult who still gets semi-frequent breakouts, as well as having a blackhead issue on my nose and</li>
      <li>So far it has given him comparable results in terms of clear skin.</li>
      <li>After 2 nights of use, smaller to medium sized pimples are pretty much totally gone.</li>
      <li>Over the past 45 years, I noticed that my breakouts seemed to be primarily hormonally driven, but stress and food caused flare-ups as well.  </li>
      <li>I hope I don&#x27;t have to use it forever, but it&#x27;s nice to know my weird onset of adult acne has met its match.</li>
      <li>I have had good experiences with their products in the past, so I expected the same from this product, tempered by the fact that few acne products really deliver.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve got an early teen granddaughter who is suffering from acne</li>
      <li>My teenage daughter used it and she has sensitive skin, as do I.</li>
      <li>I have used Rapid Clear on specific areas, over the last five days.  </li>
      <li>I have to say as far as the redness goes, it actually did not look as red within the 2hrs.</li>
      <li>I have dry, sensitive skin that breaks out often.  </li>
      <li>This product promises much and delivers little for me.  </li>
      <li>It is a huge help when skin is not as broken out, and could even be used as a stand alone product on those periods of time.  </li>

<li> It is a huge help when skin is not as broken out, and could even be used as a stand alone product on those periods of time.  </li>
<li> I can put it on a stubborn red spot at night and have it decreased significantly by morning.  </li>
<li> only thing to note is that you may get some dry skin (cut back on the number of times daily), and that you should wear sunscreen after using this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Summary</li>
<li> To make matters more complicated, I have sensitive skin that tends to get irritated with heavy duty products.  </li>
<li> This product has the highest over the counter percent allowed (10%), so probably not a good idea to use a lot of it right away until you see how your face reacts, or find a cleanser/wash that has a lower percent (like 2.5%).</li>
<li> The only time I noticed skin sensitivity was when I used it twice in one day, and the usage later in the day was placed on slightly wind-chapped skin.  </li>
<li> It doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin either</li>
<li> Occasionally I get a few spots starting to want to turn into pimples.  </li>
<li> It also can dry out your face and cause other skin issues.  </li>
<li> One would think as one aged acne would never be the curse that it was as a teenager plagued with pimples.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;m 34 and never seemed to have trouble with acne in my teenage years, but for whatever reason I now have a stubborn spot that has been resistant to just about everything else I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
<li> I have somewhat (but not overly) sensitive combination skin and after 2 nights of dabbing a very thin layer on a few small spots, as directed, I have slightly raised, very dry, red areas on my chin and right cheek.</li>
<li> A little too harsh for my skin, as it left a dry patch on my face.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ll put it on overnight if I have a really bad pimple that I want to dry out, but it doesn&#x27;t do a fantastic job...</li>
<li> As a result, my complexion has gone off the deep end for the past six months.  </li>
<li> A little bit goes a long way!</li>
<li> I was a bit skeptical of this product, but it really works!</li>
<li> This product, therefore, doesn&#x27;t work faster or slower than any other 10% benzoyl peroxide cream out there, from Walmart brand to Clearasil.</li>
<li> She has tried pro active and that seemed to burn her skin.</li>
<li> There was absolutely no reduction in redness or size of blemishes in two days, much less two hours.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;ve noticed lately that they look just a little smaller</li>
</ol>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> This works better than ProActive, and for a much better price!  The only time I noticed skin sensitivity was when I used it twice in one day, and the usage later in the day was placed on slightly wind-chapped skin.  Even so, the redness had cleared up by the next morning.  Will continue to purchase, worked on even the most stubborn acne.  I have also used the cleaner, but not through Amazon.  It is a huge help when skin is not as broken out, and could even be used as a stand alone product on those periods of time.  I will be purchasing both through Amazon in the future, because the price is better here than anywhere else I have checked.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Neutragena products for years and I&#x27;ve always been happy. This is no exception. This is a great spot gel that really clears things up without making you feel like it&#x27;s drying it into a desert.</li>
    <li> Your standard maximum strength benzoyl peroxide cream. Though this one claims to reduce red spots (incoming pimples) within 2 hours, I failed to notice any difference when applying this to my &amp;#34;red spots&amp;#34; before bedtime and comparing in the morning. However with continued use eventually the pimple gets dried out and goes away (varies in time but I say around 3 days or so). This product, therefore, doesn&#x27;t work faster or slower than any other 10% benzoyl peroxide cream out there, from Walmart brand to Clearasil. I for one did not see the &amp;#34;reduces redness in 2 hrs&amp;#34; claim hold up for me. But it&#x27;s not to say it doesn&#x27;t help; it does, but there&#x27;s nothing special about this one to me.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m an adult who still gets semi-frequent breakouts, as well as having a blackhead issue on my nose and chin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was hoping that the Neutrogena Rapid Clear Stubborn Ance Spot Gel would help with both those issues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is an awesome product for fighting up the occasional nasty breakout.  Small pimples were gone overnight, the big ugly ones in two days, though they didn&#x27;t get worse that second day which they often do - this is a significant improvement over my usual acne spot cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In terms of the blackheads, it didn&#x27;t help much.  I&#x27;ve noticed lately that they look just a little smaller then they were - but they&#x27;re still present.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall highly recommend the spot gel!</li>
    <li> This stuff is pretty great.  Occasionally I get a few spots starting to want to turn into pimples.  Some of this spot gel can nearly stop them before they start.  Helps avoid the pain of it, and also the unsightlyness of it.  Neutrogena makes good products, and not sure how much the brand means outside of the active ingredient (Benzoyl Peroxide in this case).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A lot of acne products use salicylic acid, instead of the benzoyl peroxide like this one uses, but it seems that benzoyl peroxide works faster and quicker.  It also can dry out your face and cause other skin issues.  This product has the highest over the counter percent allowed (10%), so probably not a good idea to use a lot of it right away until you see how your face reacts, or find a cleanser/wash that has a lower percent (like 2.5%).</li>
    <li> Would definitely NOT recommend this product. I have somewhat (but not overly) sensitive combination skin and after 2 nights of dabbing a very thin layer on a few small spots, as directed, I have slightly raised, very dry, red areas on my chin and right cheek. (And they are across more skin than the spot treatment was put on.) First Neutrogena product I have ever had a problem with. I will be steering clear of anything with benzoyl peroxide in it from now on just in case, although I don&#x27;t recall ever having a reaction to it before.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my son who is 20 years old. He gets the occasional pimple and some blackheads. We used to subscribe to Proactiv&#x27;s delivery, but now just uses acne free on a daily basis instead of the proactiv 3 step and this product for breakouts. So far it has given him comparable results in terms of clear skin. Rapid Clear is a great replacement for Proactiv&#x27;s spot treatment. It a great cost effective comparison product.</li>
    <li> One would think as one aged acne would never be the curse that it was as a teenager plagued with pimples.  NOT so.  Though the breakouts are minimal they still are unsightly which makes me love this product.  I can put it on a stubborn red spot at night and have it decreased significantly by morning.  I am really pleased by this product for aid in this way.  I don&#x27;t know how effective it is for acne in teens, but for an older ladies skin it is marvelous.</li>
    <li> This worked okay for me. I am in my mid thirties but I still suffer from the occasional pimple or zit. This gel did seem to clear them up faster than normal but not as fast as I would have liked. A little bit goes a long way!</li>
    <li> Once you start to even feel a pimple forming (when the bump is below the surface or the area of your face is painful) dab some of this product on and it gradually goes away, never even developing. I am totally in love with this product and would definitely re-purchase</li>
    <li> I have dry, sensitive skin that breaks out often.  The Neutrogena Rapid Clear works great on my stubborn spots.  It makes the redness go away very quickly.  And no burning to my already super sensitive skin like other products.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff ! I&#x27;m 22 and just started breaking out recently, it will be one big pimple here and there, I put it on overnight and the next day the pimple is 10 times smaller and the redness is gone ! Prob one of the best things I&#x27;ve used !</li>
    <li> As a mom, I don&#x27;t really get break outs anymore but as much as I don&#x27;t like to admit, I do get the occasional pimple. So I tried this, I was curious if it really was true that it reduces size and redness in 2 hours.  I have to say as far as the redness goes, it actually did not look as red within the 2hrs. As far as size, I can&#x27;t really say for sure, it was small to begin with. I will say it never got bigger even after a full day of make up, and it was gone within a couple days. My teenage daughter used it and she has sensitive skin, as do I. She used it longer than me and on more area of her face. She did experience some drying and flaking from it. She did say that she thought it works pretty good. She has tried pro active and that seemed to burn her skin. She did say that it cleared up her break outs pretty good and she would purchase it again and did say she would recommend to a friend.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t work as described.</li>
    <li> A little too harsh for my skin, as it left a dry patch on my face. Maybe better for teenagers instead of adult acne.</li>
    <li> Neutrogena Rapid Clear Stubborn Acne Spot Gel is a really effective acne treatment. When I saw this product I thought it was worth a try. I have had good experiences with their products in the past, so I expected the same from this product, tempered by the fact that few acne products really deliver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I&#x27;ve got an early teen granddaughter who is suffering from acne and she is not happy about it. She came for spring break and I took the opportunity to have her test the acne gel. I told her how to use it and cautioned her about not getting the gel on her clothing or bedding. I also warned her not to get any gel on the towels. I told her to apply a tiny amount to each blemish and not smear it around. She used the gel for a week, putting the gel on a couple times a day for the whole week. At the end of the test period, she was very pleased with the results. She said, &amp;#34;Gramma, that gel really works. Look at how it&#x27;s cleared up my face.&amp;#34; And she was right. Her complexion was almost completely clear. I was pretty impressed because I remember back when I was a young teen, fretting when I got a blemish on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m impressed with this product and think you will be also.</li>
    <li> It sort of helps?  I&#x27;ll put it on overnight if I have a really bad pimple that I want to dry out, but it doesn&#x27;t do a fantastic job...</li>
    <li> I have thankfully had really good luck with this product.  I&#x27;m 34 and never seemed to have trouble with acne in my teenage years, but for whatever reason I now have a stubborn spot that has been resistant to just about everything else I&#x27;ve tried.  To make matters more complicated, I have sensitive skin that tends to get irritated with heavy duty products.  I started using this twice per day, and that was too drying.  I switched to once per day (morning) with a heavy moisturizer at night.  Magic!  My chin has cleared up considerably, and with once per day it&#x27;s not too drying.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m really happy with this.  I hope I don&#x27;t have to use it forever, but it&#x27;s nice to know my weird onset of adult acne has met its match.</li>
    <li> This worked really well for my PMS breakouts. I applied to a clean face twice a day on the spots as they were forming and some of them disappeared literally within hours. My skin looked better 100% because of this product and for that reason, I highly recommend. Try to catch them early, as it works the fastest when you can almost prevent it from coming all the way out.</li>
    <li> This is a white cream, not a gel. I&#x27;m not sure why they call it a gel..  maybe a combination of both.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regardless, it does work very well. I put it on as needed and it dries with no signs of it being there. It doesn&#x27;t leave any flaky or crusty layer on your skin, so you can put makeup over top of it with no problem. It shrinks pimples pretty quickly and lessens the redness as well. After 2 nights of use, smaller to medium sized pimples are pretty much totally gone. It doesn&#x27;t dry out your skin either</li>
    <li> good product. i can see the different.</li>
    <li> Despite my age, I still have the occasional problem with acne, and when I have a problem it is usually a bad, single, inflamed spot. I was a bit skeptical of this product, but it really works! I went from red and inflamed to practically healed overnight, with all the redness gone. I&#x27;ve used it several times, always with great results. The instructions say to use one to three times daily, but once is all I&#x27;ve ever needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing to note is that you may get some dry skin (cut back on the number of times daily), and that you should wear sunscreen after using this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Summary: For the occasional spot, this is the best stuff I&#x27;ve found. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Let me preface my remarks about Rapid Clear spot gel by stating that if you have chronic skin problems, see a dermatologist.  My skin is very fair, and my condition was diagnosed as acne rosacea.  Over the past 45 years, I noticed that my breakouts seemed to be primarily hormonally driven, but stress and food caused flare-ups as well.  For the first 25 years, a dermatologist treated me with doxycycline which marginally worked.  Menopause actually calmed my skin totally down, and it was wonderful.  However, in September 2014, I had to begin taking aromatase inhibitors [will be for 5 to 10 years] as part of treatment for breast cancer.  As a result, my complexion has gone off the deep end for the past six months.  My face is now regularly broken out with pimples, blackheads, under the skin reddish swelllings, and assorted pink to dark red blotches.  I will resume seeing a dermatologist shortly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the meantime, I tried this product, very carefully following the directions.  Per the package, “reduces size and redness in just 2 hours.”  This product promises much and delivers little for me.  I have used Rapid Clear on specific areas, over the last five days.  There was absolutely no reduction in redness or size of blemishes in two days, much less two hours.  Today, the fifth day of use, I notice that areas where I have applied Rapid Clear are now warm to the touch and itch, and the redness has actually spread, so I will be discontinuing use immediately.  The only positives I noticed were that the product did blend into the skin and reduce tenderness and pain in some affected areas.</li>
