      <li>I love these single facial pads they exofiate so effortlessly &amp; beautifully, I use them every day &amp; night for the best skin ever !</li>
      <li>Easy to pack when traveling as well.</li>

      <li>It is perfect for traveling, too, as the single-use scrub sponges take up little space.</li>
      <li>Perfect to keep skin young and clear.</li>
      <li>Ffantastic; great product that our entire family has used for years.  </li>
      <li>We depend on Amazon to make it available.</li>
      <li>Makes your face feel so smooth.</li>
      <li>The abrasiveness is just perfect and gentle enough for every day use!  </li>
      <li>They do the job quick and easy, then just toss in the trash.  </li>
      <li>Quick and easy to use in one step.</li>
      <li>A very good single use item that gives a clean, fresh feeling to the skin.  </li>
      <li>These sponges are about 1/4 the original thickness.   </li>
      <li>Love them as much as I thought I would!  </li>
      <li>My skin feels for clean now.</li>
      <li>so I like to have a clean sponge to minimize bacteria.</li>
      <li>Leave my skin exfoliated and clean.</li>
      <li>I can no longer find this item in any of my local stores - it&#x27;s always been my favorite and love that you have made it easily available.</li>

      <li>it&#x27;s normal, healthy glow</li>
      <li>Have used these for many years, and they help keep my skin clean and clear of blimishes.</li>
      <li>It was totally worth it for me</li>
      <li>, I&#x27;d: 1) make them a bit thicker, 2) make them round in shape (to make it easier to cleanse around the hairline and eyes), and 3) offer them in a cleanser-free variety - so you can add your own favorite cleanser instead.</li>
      <li>Drier and sensitive skins may not be able to tolerate the texture.</li>
      <li>After about a week I get a fresh one as they start to fall apart.</li>

      <li>It is impossible to find them in the stores anymore so being able to get them on Amazon is awesome.</li>
      <li>Great individual facial scrubs.  </li>
      <li>Just a gentle circular motion with a sudsy Buff Puff about twice a week is all it takes to maintain a soft but healthy glow.  </li>
      <li>They seem to be a little thinner than I have purchased but still a good price.</li>
      <li>recalled using these as a tween when I first started getting acne</li>
      <li>I have used these facial sponges every day for many years.  </li>
      <li>Thanks!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have been using these Buf-Puf for years.  They really do a good job in cleaning the face and keeping it smooth.  love the great purchase price.</li>
    <li> I love exfoliating my face using the Buf-Puf single-use sponges...they already have cleanser built in and create lots of suds.  The sponges are gentle enough to use every day.</li>
    <li> I have been using the Buf-Puf single use sponges for years and I absolutely love them.  It is a hassle having to order them now versus being able to just go to the store to pick them up.  I have tried to find them in the store and have not found them for the past couple of years.  I usually order in bulk to carry me over for a few months.  I have used other sponges in the past, even other kinds of Buf-Pufs, but this is the best for me.</li>
    <li> I love these because they are disposable and work really well.  I don&#x27;t use them too often (maybe once a month or when I feel like I need it). They do the job quick and easy, then just toss in the trash.  I don&#x27;t have to worry about mold growing or anything like that. Totally sanitary. I highly recommend and will buy again.  Since I don&#x27;t use them too often, they last me a very long time (years - - LOL)</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years, it works great, I wish they still sold them at the stores.</li>
    <li> I love Buff Puffs, they remove dead and flakey skin cells and leave your face looking and feeling soft and revived.  Just a gentle circular motion with a sudsy Buff Puff about twice a week is all it takes to maintain a soft but healthy glow.  I highly recomend them.</li>
    <li> I had used this product in the past and loved it. A gentle scrub with the disposable sponge leaves your face feeling really clean and fresh. I had been unable to find the Buf-Puf singles in stores for the past several years and finally came across the long-sought-after cleansing sponges on Amazon. I am thrilled that this product is still out there.</li>
    <li> This item is not always in stock by Amazon, so I ordered two packages this time.  I love the way my skin feels after washing it with the buff puff.   And I hope to continue to see them in stock.</li>
    <li> I LOVE Buf Puf Singles. I do use them with my own facial cleaner after the first use. This makes them last longer.  After about a week I get a fresh one as they start to fall apart. I have looked for these is the stores in my area with no luck. I was so glad to find them online. Thanks!</li>
    <li> My wife has used the Buff Puffs for many years and wont use anything else it is a great product.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product since I was a teen and although the sponges have shrunk in size.  They still are one of my favorite for face care and exfoliating.  Too bad they took them off the shelfs at our local markets.  Still I&#x27;m happy to note that I can still purchase them from this site.</li>
    <li> I used to buy Buff Puffs when I was a teen, and have recently revisited them because I find that exfoliation is so important to preventing clogged pores. It&#x27;s true what the other reviewer(s) said, that they are about half the thickness they used to be - very thin. Unfortunately, I&#x27;ve had an increase in oiliness and breakouts since using these, and I suspect the cleanser. So now I rinse the cleanser off and use my own. Still, I think these single-use puffs are a better alternative to the thicker, more expensive exfoliating circles I was buying and trying to rinse and re-use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I were designing these, I&#x27;d: 1) make them a bit thicker, 2) make them round in shape (to make it easier to cleanse around the hairline and eyes), and 3) offer them in a cleanser-free variety - so you can add your own favorite cleanser instead.</li>
    <li> Like many others who reviewed this product, I&#x27;ve used the Buf-Puf for years and became frustrated when I couldn&#x27;t find it sold anywhere.  Thankfully, I checked Amazon.  Not only is it reasonably priced, buying it in the multipak is the way to go if you use the singles daily.    Please don&#x27;t stop selling this item! We depend on Amazon to make it available.</li>
    <li> Great product!...I had never tried these....but after all the reviews...I bought them....They are a great price on here also.</li>
    <li> these sponges are amazing. I prefer these as they are one use. I get breakouts so I like to have a clean sponge to minimize bacteria. my face feels smooth and pores look smaller. I rinse these before use and add my own cleanser. ice thought about getting a clairsonic but these are great exfoliators and the thought of the filth growing in a clarsonic brush is not appealing!</li>
    <li> Have been using this product for years and love it!  Can&#x27;t locate in stores anymore, so glad to find on Amazon.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> Good product wife loves it; she stocks up once a year.  Would purchase at a local store but product is normally sold out.</li>
    <li> This product is like having a mini exfoliant daily. I can tell the difference with my skin, when I ran out and had to wait two days for my order. I use one scrub daily with a drop of the perricone facial wash and then I have great, clean skin!!!!!</li>
    <li> I wish I had not purchased two sleeves of these. The cleansing soap in them is not the same as when you purchase them in the store.</li>
    <li> These are not the same Buf-Pufs that I have purchased in the past.   These sponges are about 1/4 the original thickness.   The ones that I have used in the past have had two different textures on the sponge - one was slightly rougher and the other side was smoother.   These sponges are extremely rough and since they are so thin, they are a little hard to get a grip on.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend them and then again I wouldn&#x27;t not recommend them.   I would buy a single pack instead of the pack of 6 to test them out first especially if you have sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> Seems to be the only thing I can get her to do and am willing to continue buying if she will keep up with your face.</li>
    <li> Given as gift, great for gift bag</li>
    <li> This product was way too harsh on my sensitive skin, and the cleanser inside was breaking me out really bad.</li>
    <li> Love the buff puffs!! I have used many exfoliating products over the years!  But I remembered my grandma used to have me use these as a kid and how much I loved them/how much I thought I&#x27;d enjoy them now!  So I went on a search for them online--could not find them in stores ( that was 20 something years ago).  Love them as much as I thought I would!  Super convenient and I have not found, like many other reviewers, that I need to use a different soap (other than the soap already in the buff puff pad).  The abrasiveness is just perfect and gentle enough for every day use!  But still feel that its working!  I hate the non-abrasive &#x27;exfoliators.&#x27;&lt;br /&gt;Will definitely purchase again!!</li>
    <li> Great individual facial scrubs.  I have been using them for years and love them. Easy to pack when traveling as well.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for over 30 years...Yes over 30 years....My dermatologist insisted I use the Buf-Puf with my skin program and by the way he is a graduate from UCLA.  If you have skin problems I highly recommend Buf-Puf products!</li>
    <li> I love these single use cleanser exfoliating sponges! They have been hard to find in stores lately so I was glad I could order them here!</li>
    <li> Wonderful product! Great for exfoliation and with it being singles, just trash after use. Been using for years.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using these for years. Wonderful product. Lots of lather and just enough gentle scrubbing power. Leaves skin soft and so clean scrubbing the dead skin away. Quick and easy to use in one step.</li>
    <li> Have used these for years, and they exfoliate my very dry skin and I don&#x27;t react to the soap in them and am hyper sensitive.</li>
    <li> You cannot buy these anywhere in stores, so I switched to something else to wash my face, totally unsatisfied with new product.  I searched high &amp; low for this product on line and found a placing selling them.  I am going to be looking for more in the near future, my skin is back to it&#x27;s normal, healthy glow</li>
    <li> I have used these facial sponges every day for many years.  They are really good for exfoliation and cleansing.  I have combination skin.  They work very well for my skin type.  From: Mary D.</li>
    <li> My husband uses these everyday to help beat the heck out of his oily skin.  Adult acne is a beast.  His shoulders are much improved since he has started using this product.</li>
    <li> These are great for removing makeup</li>
    <li> These baby buf pufs are terrific. I use one 2x daily- once in the am and again in the pm. Then I recycle them as little scrubbers for household cleaning. Leave my skin exfoliated and clean. A daily deep clean. And they&#x27;re especially suited to travel. Just throw a few in your bag and go. No 4oz bottles to mess with.</li>
    <li> Love these little disposable sponges! Just the right size. Makes your face feel so smooth. Found the bigger sponges seemed to scrape the skin as opposed to the lighter scrubbing of these.</li>
    <li> These work well, but they are much thinner then the Buf-Puf&#x27;s I used years ago. As with everything else, more money, less product, but at least they work.</li>
    <li> Works great on my skin especially in removal of dead skin.</li>
    <li> I get a couple of uses out of each one, I just rinse well &amp; dries almost instantly.</li>
    <li> These are so flimsy and thin I need to use 3 at a time because one is hard yo even hold onto.  Waste of money, and I bought a pack of 6 with 40 in each...pffft. Wonder what else I can use them for. Suggestions welcome.</li>
    <li> Great product, used to use these thirty years ago and lost track of being able to buy them or remember who made then. Luckily, through a simple internet search, I have found them and love using them for hygienic, single use which keeps my complexion really glowing.</li>
    <li> You can get these for oily or dry skin. I just get whichever is less at the time, rinse out the cleanser prior to use and add my own cleanser. The included cleanser just doesn&#x27;t do it for me, and it&#x27;s very easy to get rid of with 30 seconds or so of running water. After 30 years of moderate to severe acne, I finally have it under control thanks to these one-time use exfoliating pads, an anti-bacterial cleanser, and a good alpha hydroxy serum to keep the exfoliation going throughout the day. With acne, killing bacteria is half the battle, so having a fresh clean cleansing pad every time is a tremendous help in the fight against contaminated tools. If you use them once a day like I do, this pack of 6-40 count boxes is an 8 month supply and come up to about ten cents a square-- SO worth it to remove dead flakes from a facial and to keep dead skin from lodging into pores already prone to clogging from excess sebum and over-active bacteria. Drier and sensitive skins may not be able to tolerate the texture. However for the extremely oily and acne prone, these cleansing pads may be your Holy Grail in your quest for clear skin. They&#x27;re affordable and do what they promise. What more could I have asked for? I&#x27;m running around in public without foundation for the first time in my life and I am so confident and feel so much better about my skin. It was totally worth it for me and I hope they never stop making them!</li>
    <li> I always wash my face with the puffs, instead of with a towel. They really do exfoliate your skin and get rid of dead skin and oil build-up. They&#x27;re hard to find...so it&#x27;s good that Amazon and Drugstore.com has them.</li>
    <li> Ffantastic; great product that our entire family has used for years.  We rinse out the soap it comes with and use our own soap but we all have very sensitive skin.  The shipment though....whatever affiliate of Amazon shipped this, put it in a bag/pouch instead of a box.  Too bad I can&#x27;t post a picture here.  Every box in the order (6) was smashed and wrecked.  Amazon I don&#x27;t believe is at fault here.</li>
    <li> Been using buff puff pads for years. Only thing that keeps my face clear. Love them! Highly recommend buf puff pads.</li>
    <li> I can no longer find this item in any of my local stores - it&#x27;s always been my favorite and love that you have made it easily available. So convenient to use. Thanks!</li>
    <li> I use these in combination with Dove soap on my face every morning.  My complexion has always been very consistent and clear.</li>
    <li> Perfect for cleaning and exfoliating your skin.  I have used these for many years.  I can no longer find them in any stores, so I was very happy to be able to order them online.  MUCH better than the high dollar &amp;#34;Electric Face Brushes&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> I am an adult with acne prone skin.&lt;br /&gt;I recalled using these as a tween when I first started getting acne and I was so surprised they still made these.&lt;br /&gt;I am a huge fan because it exfoliates and does a good job of getting excess makeup off at the end of the day.</li>
    <li> I used these years ago and found they helped keep my skin clear. At 66 with oily skin and living in a humid climate, these gently exfoliate and thoroughly cleans without over-drying. Perfect to keep skin young and clear. I had nearly given up on finding them again. Like so many other products, Amazon had them for me when no other source was found. BRAVO, Amazon!</li>
    <li> They were at a great price.  They seem to be a little thinner than I have purchased but still a good price.</li>
    <li> Love this product - having been using it for years but it has become difficult to find. Happy to have found it on Amazon.</li>
    <li> My mom heard about these buf-pufs from a co-worker and used my account to buy them. She really likes them and even gave me a few to try. No complaints here.</li>
    <li> A very good single use item that gives a clean, fresh feeling to the skin.  Not too rough and not too soft.</li>
    <li> I have used these for years and I love them.  You just cannot find them in stores much anymore.  Shipped very quickly and a pretty good price.</li>
    <li> I love these single facial pads they exofiate so effortlessly &amp; beautifully, I use them every day &amp; night for the best skin ever ! They last for mths</li>
    <li> Have used these for many years, and they help keep my skin clean and clear of blimishes. Buff Puffs are an excellent product!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for years and years, but it is getting harder to find in local stores. I was happy to find it at Amazon and available on the auto-delivery program. It combines the soft facial scrubber with cleanser, making it quick and easy to use. The cleanser is gentle and non-irritating, even on my sensitive skin. It is perfect for traveling, too, as the single-use scrub sponges take up little space. It is also available in a normal to dry skin formula. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Was great to have something portable to take to work.  I had an issue of one of the boxes that had no soap in it.</li>
    <li> Amazing results after just a few uses. Makes the face skin feel alive and fresh, I use them every day and I like the results you get.</li>
    <li> I used these as a teenager and loved them. It is impossible to find them in the stores anymore so being able to get them on Amazon is awesome. TIP... I do find them a little thin... I use one and then set it aside... the next day I will put that one behind a new one. That thickness is much more acceptable. I just keep using the previous days for the extra thickness.</li>
    <li> THESE BUFFS PUF&#x27;S I HAVE BEEN USING THESE FOR YEARS ON MY FACE WITH SOAP AND WATER AND I&#x27;M EIGHTY YEARS OLD AND MY FACE LOOKS WONDERFUL I THINK AND HAVE BEEN TOLD I DON&#x27;T LOOK MY AGE.</li>
    <li> Once I started using these, I began thinking &amp;#34;where have you been all my life?&amp;#34;  I love these little pads.  I just rinse the cleanser out (which takes seconds) add my own skin car product and there you have it.  Flawless skin.  My skin feels for clean now.</li>
    <li> These are great, I have used them for years, I specially like the multipack  I never run out and  saves trips to the store.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using these for about 15 years and it&#x27;s really hard to find around town.  It costs about the same with Amazon Prime so I just order a load each time and it lasts me forever.  I usually use each pad twice.  The first time with the built in cleanser and then a second time the next day with a little bit of my Neutrogena cleanser.  Then, before I throw the pad away, I give the sink a quick scrub and it stays spic and span all the time!</li>
    <li> I fell in love with these in local stores almost a decade ago. Over the last several years, they&#x27;ve been more difficult to purchase in person so I&#x27;ve been ordering them through Amazon. They&#x27;re absolutely wonderful and I mix them with my own facial soap, using them more as an exfoliator. They remove a lot of sweat, dirt, oil and makeup.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used them for years to get that extra clean feeling.  Since I have oily skin this is the only product that make me feel good about cleaning my face without irritation and ends the break outs. My dermatologist suggested them.</li>
    <li> the buff puff a nice job cleaning and smoothing the skin.  I have used them for a about two years.</li>
