<li> Very thick, really nice product.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve always had long eyelashes, but the older I get</li>
<li> It&#x27;s natural and has no side effects unlike other chemical products out there on the market.</li>
<li> I wish it were a little easier to dispense, since I often get a little more than I&#x27;d like, but it&#x27;s not a major issue - - at least not enough to deduct a star.</li>
<li> Helped grow my eyelashes long!</li>
<li> they seem to be getting shorter and harder to separate when applying mascara.  </li>
<li> I let her know to use on her feet and also to look up some other uses.</li>
<li> The small bottle looks like it will last a few months.</li>
<li> and it smells a little plant-like.</li>
<li> and I will continue to use this oil mix a few times a week for maintenance.</li>
<li> Not as thick as some other castor oils I&#x27;ve tried</li>
<li> I put some oil in a small glass jar with 5 drops of Rosemary oil.</li>
<li> I have been applying this castor oil three to four times a week at night for the past couple of months</li>
<li> it is a thick oil</li>
<li> Unfortunately, the bottle had a small leak in it and spilled in the box :/</li>
<li> but I&#x27;m not impressed with the fact that Amazon won&#x27;t let me buy because it&#x27;s an &amp;#34;add on item&amp;#34;.</li>
<li> I put this on my eyebrows and they grow like crazy!  </li>

    <li> Good organic castor oil!</li>

    <li> I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s a good product but I&#x27;m not impressed with the fact that Amazon won&#x27;t let me buy because it&#x27;s an &amp;#34;add on item&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing. Putting in on eye lashes and brows. Very thick, really nice product. Will buy again. Great company.</li>
    <li> Good castor oil product. Helped me darken my eyebrows</li>
    <li> Quality oil, soft and smooth as silk. I use it for eyebrow growth. Too soon to tell results.</li>
    <li> Excellent items, exactly as described</li>
    <li> Terrific! Pure product! Currently using it on my eyebrows for growth.</li>
    <li> I let her know to use on her feet and also to look up some other uses.</li>
    <li> I highly recommend this oil for the high quality and great packaging. You know you are getting high quality oil when its USDA certified. Castor oil is great for growing out hair so I recommend it to those who have thinning hair, have over-tweezed eyebrows, and etc. It&#x27;s natural and has no side effects unlike other chemical products out there on the market.</li>
    <li> I read to use this to encourage lash growth.  I&#x27;ve always had long eyelashes, but the older I get they seem to be getting shorter and harder to separate when applying mascara.  I have been applying this castor oil three to four times a week at night for the past couple of months and I&#x27;ve noticed a massive difference.  It&#x27;ll take me a while to get though this bottle, but I will definitely order again</li>
    <li> great product...quick shipping, but product was leaking in box.</li>
    <li> Works amazingly on cramps, natural and effective.</li>
    <li> Not as thick as some other castor oils I&#x27;ve tried</li>
    <li> Works great for my healthcare needs.</li>
    <li> I really like this stuff! It&#x27;s my first experience with castor oil. I use it to wash my face (have been oil cleansing with hazelnut and  olive oil for a few  years now), straight up now that it&#x27;s summer but I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll dilute come winter. I can&#x27;t yet comment on hair growth, but it seems to have helped my head and eyebrow hair in just two weeks. The small bottle looks like it will last a few months. I wish it were a little easier to dispense, since I often get a little more than I&#x27;d like, but it&#x27;s not a major issue - - at least not enough to deduct a star. Overall, great stuff.</li>
    <li> Bought it for eyelash growth and I can definitely see a difference especially on my lower eyelashes. I apply it at night and leave it on until morning (shower).</li>
    <li> I primarily use it on my eyebrows to thicken them. It works! Great quality.</li>
    <li> Perfect!  I put this on my eyebrows and they grow like crazy!  I have a thyroid issue, a side effect is hair loss, not anymore!  I&#x27;ve even put it on my scalp and it helps as well.</li>
    <li> This stuff really works. I was looking for skin care oils and castor oil is one that is often recommended online. I can see why because this makes my skin really soft and while it is not as fluid as other oils, I think this is great for very dry skin. I use this on my elbows and knees but also on my eyebrows and eyelashes for added conditioning and strengthening. I think this is a good product to purchase and I definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> I have used Castor before and it works great for brows, eyelashes and hair. Unfortunately, the bottle had a small leak in it and spilled in the box :/</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this along with rosemary essential oil for growing my brows. I&#x27;ve seen awesome results with daily use for 3 weeks! I put some oil in a small glass jar with 5 drops of Rosemary oil. I apply with a qtip at night and go to bed. I highly recommend this and I will continue to use this oil mix a few times a week for maintenance.</li>
