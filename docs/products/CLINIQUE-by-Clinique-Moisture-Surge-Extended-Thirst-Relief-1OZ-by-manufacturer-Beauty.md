<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Clinique products are not tested on animals and this product really does what it says it&#x27;s supposed to do.  Been using it for years.</li>
    <li> great for under makeup.</li>
    <li> Settles my dry patches and never feels greasy. Great for summer.</li>
    <li> I live in Colorado (which is dry), and as I have become older, my skin is extremely dehydrated. So much so that any other lotions, even Argan oil was  not enough to hydrate my face. So, I bought a 1oz sample to test this product and when I used it, I fell in love! You only need to use very little and I am happy to say, my face has not felt this hydrated since I was young! Even though it is a bit more pricey than I like to pay, I will definitely be purchasing more!</li>
    <li> My dermatologist suggested that I use prescription Retin-A cream mixed with a moisturizer to counteract the drying effects of the Retin-A. I use a pea-sized dollop of Retin-A and mix it in the palm of my hand with about double that amount of the Moisture surge, then apply it to my face. It has really helped!  I also use it on its own and what I love about it is that it absorbs so quickly and doesn&#x27;t feel gooey or greasy after I&#x27;ve put it on.  And it really seems to keep my face moisturized.  It&#x27;s great for under makeup.</li>
    <li> I first purchased this product in sephora ever since I&#x27;ve been an addict.  No matter how much my skin changes or the weather conditions from warm July weather to snowy October weather the mosterizer is real rich .  Makes you glow people think I have foundation makes my skin look  fresh</li>
    <li> This was the second order of the moisturizer for the misses...so I&#x27;m in good standing....for now. See loves the results she&#x27;s getting.</li>
    <li> This moisture does work. I had noticed my skin seemed softer and considerably less dry. After using it for several weeks I attended a lunch with my friends and they all indicated that my skin looked glowing! I am sure part of this was due to my new diet and exercise routine but I will give Clinique credit where credit is due. I will continue to use this moisturizing surge because it makes my skin feel better.</li>
    <li> This was an indulgent gift to myself.  It isn&#x27;t oily but provides my face with needed moisture.  It feels so light, so delicate.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. I&#x27;ve used it befoer. It&#x27;s the bomb.</li>
    <li> My daughters and I love this non greasy moisturizer.  Absorbs well.  Doesn&#x27;t cause acne</li>
    <li> Clinique is one of the most popular lines for a reason.  Tried and true, this does wonders for my aging skin.  I&#x27;m glad that I can buy it online at Amazon now, saving me the trip and expense of going to Macy&#x27;s, especially with madness of the holidays</li>
    <li> Has made a nice difference in my skin since using, especially in this cold NE Ohio winter weather.</li>
    <li> The packaging I received was different than the one pictured - when I purchased it, the picture was of a small container, but I received a tube.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s my only complaint.  Best moisturizer on the market, as far as I&#x27;m concerned.</li>
    <li> great product, arrived at time and without problems</li>
    <li> the package is different from what i expected. i have a little worried about it.</li>
    <li> Gave this as a gift for someone who loves this brand but I think the smallness of it made the gift insignificant.</li>
    <li> Yes, it&#x27;s finally happening and my once youthful skin is now starting to dry out.  I was sent samples of this in a small tear pouch and tried it under my day moisturizer.  Loved it!!! The moment I put it on my skin felt softer.  I kept the pouch and decided to order these small travel size tubes for the terrific price.  Thanks Amazon!!!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a couple of years now. I have very combination skin even to acne. You only have to use a touch of this product and it makes my skin feel so nice. Everyone should use this product.</li>
    <li> Your skin will love it. Mine is combination skin and it does not feel greasey when applied. I use Clinque all the time. Get to your Clinque counter now its gift with purchase til March 28, 2013..</li>
    <li> Was advertised as  small jar and it came in this tube which was not closed tightly and leaked. I do not recommend ordering it from this seller.  Product was o.k. though and I am going to use it.</li>
    <li> I have combination skin, and it gets super dry during the winter months.  I received this as a sample and disliked it.  While it&#x27;s light and does not break out my skin it does not provide extended thirst relief.  It feels just like a regular moisturizer.  If you have extra dry skin I would not recommend this.</li>
