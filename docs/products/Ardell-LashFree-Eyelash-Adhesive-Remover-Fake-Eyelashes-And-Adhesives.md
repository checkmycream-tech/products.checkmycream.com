      <li>Doesn&#x27;t burn but didn&#x27;t take off my lashes amazing had to sit and rub for a while, felt like just oil....</li>

      <li>and it comes off so easily!</li>
      <li>Its just ok because you can easily get this in your eyes and boy does it burn!</li>
      <li>It removes some but the more stubborn ones wouldn&#x27;t come off no matter</li>
      <li>Will surely use it again.</li>
      <li>But what I do now is use a eyeliner brush which gives me better control of the amount that is on the brush, than the Q-tip swab.</li>
      <li>Removes the glue easily so I can reuse them.</li>
      <li>but i removed them easily whith this stuff</li>
      <li>This item does help the eyelashes to come off easy</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s an oily-feeling solution, and doesn&#x27;t work very quickly.</li>
      <li>Takes eyelashes off easy without damaging</li>
      <li>By that time you can not see out of your eye because the scent is too strong.</li>

      <li>Luxury brand eye makeup removers are more effective and worth itin the long run.</li>
      <li>this works super</li>
      <li>This works exactly like it&#x27;s supposed to!  </li>
      <li>This stuff is great to remove those little globs of adhesive that want to stick to your lash line after you remove your lashes.  </li>
      <li>It was worth a try</li>
      <li>That being said, this item does remove the powerful LashTite adhesive, you just have to be a bit patient.</li>
      <li>and they come right off.</li>
      <li>I have purchased this before and will certainly do so again!</li>
      <li>: the bottle had only a small tape on the top and was shipped in a bag instead of box happy it didn&#x27;t spill</li>
      <li>This product takes eyelash glue off pretty close to perfectly, would be perfect but it burns soo bad if you get it in your eyes which is pretty hard</li>
      <li>The first I used this stuff and it got in my eye...</li>
      <li>No matter what do NOT pull on them (to the point of stretching your eyelid) and end up taking off some of your real lashes!</li>
      <li>glad to find a larger size.</li>
      <li>love that i can finally find this size.</li>
      <li>the larger size bottle  is not sold in most stores</li>
      <li>It removes my individual eye lashes I get done at the salon as well as strip lashes I put on my self so much more easier.</li>
      <li>Im able to do the same as my stylist.  </li>
      <li>I also went to YouTube and watched different tutorials to see if there was a better way to use the product and there wasn&#x27;t.</li>
      <li>I can save money by just using baby oil to remove my individual lashes and it works fine.</li>
      <li>it works very well, however it takes a bit of time till it removes all the glue.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m really upset.</li>
      <li>This product really worked for me</li>
      <li>Removes eyelash extensions without taking off your real eyelashes.</li>
      <li>Helps get all the stuff off of my real lashes and the fakes.  </li>
      <li>much easier Note</li>
      <li>wow really!</li>
      <li>it didn&#x27;t remove all the glue and gave my a huge stye on my right eye and a smaller one on my left one.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t work the same as the original Ardel that I buy from the professional stores.</li>
      <li>so I don&#x27;t lose any natural lashes!!</li>
      <li>apply a little more remover and wait a few more minutes, until you can PEEL the lashes off, but not pull.</li>
      <li>The remover I received in a kit from Sally&#x27;s didn&#x27;t work half as good and was more expensive.</li>
      <li>Be careful not to get it in your eye, though it&#x27;s not terribly painful if you do.</li>
      <li>but the gir put a massive quantity of glue on my real eyelashes</li>
      <li>This goes on like a silky oil and doesnt sting and it works to remove adhesive, while leaving skin soft and moisturized</li>
      <li>And lost alotof my natural lashes.  </li>
      <li>ok i used this product and it was pretty good.you do have to wait a few minutes for the remover to kick in though.ok a little advice your eyes and eyelids are going to be irritated</li>
      <li>It smells like paint thinner; burns like you wouldn&#x27;t believe and barely removes my lashes.</li>
      <li>The major problem here is that this is the only adhesive remover that I know of that will work with the LashTite Adhesive.</li>
      <li>Use less, gentle on eyes.</li>

<li> It smells like paint thinner; burns like you wouldn&#x27;t believe and barely removes my lashes.</li>
<li> The major problem here is that this is the only adhesive remover that I know of that will work with the LashTite Adhesive.</li>
<li> Use less, gentle on eyes.</li>
<li> Small 2 oz bottle, but you don&#x27;t use much at a time.</li>
<li> how long I left the remover on&lt;br</li>
<li> It was a complete waste of money.</li>
<li> what so ever when rubbing lash of with this product your eyes will feel like they are burning and getting stabbed at the same time keep eyes closed</li>
<li> lid was loose a lot leaked out messed up my dresser</li>
<li> I am new to the false eyelash world and definitely need me some remover!  </li>
<li> it hurts the eye a little bit if you open it during the process</li>
<li> I just spent 30 mins trying to remove from my lashes and I still have little globs of glue left that I&#x27;m giving up on.</li>
<li> Just be careful not to get it in your eye</li>
<li> No matter how carefully applied.</li>
<li> You have to be very careful and not get this in your eyes as it can burn.(I say this from experience).  </li>
<li> I use this remover in conjunction with [[ASIN:B0035LCW0W Ardell LashTite Adhesive 3/4oz Dark]]</li>
<li> it&#x27;s not worth buying it again</li>
<li> but i learned how to do them and the tiny bottles being sold at beauty stores were ridiculous.</li>
<li> That being said, just a little bit on</li>
<li> Just draw a little line across the lash line with a q tip</li>
<li> leave on eyelashes for a few min before you try and remove they will slip off</li>
<li> Product is just to harsh for anyone&#x27;s eyes</li>
<li> So I brush some on and wait a few minutes and the lashes come off.</li>
<li> spot removal (just a few lashes)</li>
<li> put the remover on a q-tip, apply it to the adhesive and then wait a few minutes.</li>
<li> I clean my lashes is annoying, and I use make up cleanser on them now.</li>
<li> This remover burns so bad, and doesn&#x27;t even really remove all the glue from the eyelashes.</li>
<li> Did not work at all, don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
<li> :/ .</li>
<li> I usually dab the solution on with a Q-tip, and then wait around five minutes or so before trying to remove anything.</li>
<li> It didn&#x27;t work for me, I was having a hard time with my eyelashes trying to come out.</li>
<li> So buyer beware , seriously ...</li>
<li> but still it&#x27;s not good</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Only thing that worked to get ardell lash glue off! Ardell glue is evil !!!!!&lt;br /&gt;Thank you!</li>
    <li> This product burns your eyes.  The scent is too strong and you have to put a tone on your lashes to remove them.  By that time you can not see out of your eye because the scent is too strong.</li>
    <li> Its just ok because you can easily get this in your eyes and boy does it burn! I wont be getting anymore of this and will still to my makeup remover that works wonders!</li>
    <li> Small 2 oz bottle, but you don&#x27;t use much at a time. Should last awhile.I like it!</li>
    <li> ok i used this product and it was pretty good.you do have to wait a few minutes for the remover to kick in though.ok a little advice your eyes and eyelids are going to be irritated but thats not uncommon what i did is after all of the adhesive is removed i put vaseline on my eyelids and on wherever it seemed irritated!! just a bit of advice hope this helps!!this product does work though so dont be afraid to try just be ware it can sting and burn if it gets in you eyes!!</li>
    <li> Did not work at all, don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
    <li> it works very well, however it takes a bit of time till it removes all the glue. it hurts the eye a little bit if you open it during the process so you have to be carful and patient since it takes some time to remove all the glue. it came in a good condition and covered in plastic.</li>
    <li> duo eyelash adhesive works 100% . This one wont last an hour . I keep fixing it but still it&#x27;s not good it&#x27;s not worth buying it again</li>
    <li> This lash adhesive remover just rocks.  I am new to the false eyelash world and definitely need me some remover!  Gotta keep practicing...You have to be very careful and not get this in your eyes as it can burn.(I say this from experience).  That being said, just a little bit on a Q-Tip works the best for me.  I recommend this adhesive remover to anyone!</li>
    <li> Thanks for expediting and for making sure that it would not spill  by covering the product . Your time is appreciate</li>
    <li> I wear cluster lashes every day, changing them out once a week and this remover works perfectly so I don&#x27;t lose any natural lashes!! I have purchased this before and will certainly do so again!</li>
    <li> Works ok but if it gets into your eyes it burns like H---!  I can save money by just using baby oil to remove my individual lashes and it works fine.</li>
    <li> This product didn&#x27;t work at all  It was a complete waste of money.I will  never going to buy this s*** again</li>
    <li> lid was loose a lot leaked out messed up my dresser but what was left took off eyelashes</li>
    <li> very happy with the product.  the larger size bottle  is not sold in most stores so I was very happy with the product..</li>
    <li> works well to remove lashes</li>
    <li> It removes my individual eye lashes I get done at the salon as well as strip lashes I put on my self so much more easier. Just be careful not to get it in your eye it burns quite a lot :/ . It gets in my eyes a lot because its liquid . Tip: leave on eyelashes for a few min before you try and remove they will slip off much easier Note: the bottle had only a small tape on the top and was shipped in a bag instead of box happy it didn&#x27;t spill</li>
    <li> This goes on like a silky oil and doesnt sting and it works to remove adhesive, while leaving skin soft and moisturized</li>
    <li> Nice size ! Also like that I can buy this product without buying lashes at the same time! But doesn&#x27;t work as well as I thought it should.</li>
    <li> This sucked. Even though it took off the fake lashed it took me 2hrs. And lost alotof my natural lashes.  Beware</li>
    <li> Removes eyelash extensions without taking off your real eyelashes.</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t work for me, I was having a hard time with my eyelashes trying to come out. I contact the saler n he sed call the manufacture, wow really! But we pay for what we get.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t work the same as the original Ardel that I buy from the professional stores. It looks like it was deluted.</li>
    <li> Excellent seller, product exactly as described.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> The first I used this stuff and it got in my eye...and...OMG!!! It burns like hades!!! But what I do now is use a eyeliner brush which gives me better control of the amount that is on the brush, than the Q-tip swab. So I brush some on and wait a few minutes and the lashes come off. If you used alot of lash glue, it will take longer for the remover to work, so just be patient. No matter what do NOT pull on them (to the point of stretching your eyelid) and end up taking off some of your real lashes! Just be patient and let the remover do its job. If you find that you have to pull with any force at all...STOP...apply a little more remover and wait a few more minutes, until you can PEEL the lashes off, but not pull.</li>
    <li> This works exactly like it&#x27;s supposed to!  It&#x27;s easy, straightforward, and is priced well.  The remover I received in a kit from Sally&#x27;s didn&#x27;t work half as good and was more expensive.</li>
    <li> Im able to do the same as my stylist.  Allows you to do it yourself at your convenience.  A must have if you get your eye lashes done.</li>
    <li> I use this remover in conjunction with [[ASIN:B0035LCW0W Ardell LashTite Adhesive 3/4oz Dark]] and it works great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I put the remover on a q-tip, apply it to the adhesive and then wait a few minutes. I then put a dab on a cotton ball and wipe my lash line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For spot removal (just a few lashes), I skip the last part and just use the q-tip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you use LashTite adhesive, this remover is a must!</li>
    <li> I never write reviews NEVER, but I felt the need to write one this time. Soo I switched eyelash removers and I tried this one out WELL when I put it on not only did it burn my eyes like hell it didn&#x27;t remove all the glue and gave my a huge stye on my right eye and a smaller one on my left one. So now I&#x27;m a makeup artist I have a big even on Saturday an guess what? My eyes are swelled up so bad an how in the world can I look my best? It&#x27;s embarrassing to go out and I can promise you I never break out have any sensitivity whatsoever. So buyer beware , seriously ...I&#x27;m really upset.</li>
    <li> This item does help the eyelashes to come off easy but it burns your eyes very bad? But if you are trying to get them off, it does work</li>
    <li> Helps get all the stuff off of my real lashes and the fakes.  Will surely use it again. I Recommend!</li>
    <li> It removes some but the more stubborn ones wouldn&#x27;t come off no matter how long I left the remover on&lt;br /&gt;.maybe the glue has to be the same brand for it to work?</li>
    <li> Removes the glue easily so I can reuse them. You not need to pull glue off of lashes which can ruin them.</li>
    <li> This solution does what it&#x27;s supposed to do, which is to dissolve the glue used in Ardell LashTite Adhesive.  It&#x27;s an oily-feeling solution, and doesn&#x27;t work very quickly. I usually dab the solution on with a Q-tip, and then wait around five minutes or so before trying to remove anything. Getting any of the solution in your eyes may sting your eyes (it stings mine).  The major problem here is that this is the only adhesive remover that I know of that will work with the LashTite Adhesive. If there were another one that worked more quickly, I would consider switching products.  That being said, this item does remove the powerful LashTite adhesive, you just have to be a bit patient.</li>
    <li> It smells like paint thinner; burns like you wouldn&#x27;t believe and barely removes my lashes. Really frustrating. I just spent 30 mins trying to remove from my lashes and I still have little globs of glue left that I&#x27;m giving up on. I change my lashes each week.</li>
    <li> This product really worked for me i was so afraid because i got eyelash extension but the gir put a massive quantity of glue on my real eyelashes but i removed them easily whith this stuff it tooks me like 4 hours because of the amount of glue but im finally free</li>
    <li> love that i can finally find this size. i used to gt my lashes done but i learned how to do them and the tiny bottles being sold at beauty stores were ridiculous. glad to find a larger size.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t burn but didn&#x27;t take off my lashes amazing had to sit and rub for a while, felt like just oil....they did finally come off though!!</li>
    <li> No matter how carefully applied. Luxury brand eye makeup removers are more effective and worth itin the long run. Use less, gentle on eyes.</li>
    <li> honestly, this stuff removes my nail polish aand is way too toxic to use on most of my fancier eyelashes. Having to reapply my nail polish everytime I clean my lashes is annoying, and I use make up cleanser on them now.</li>
    <li> This remover burns so bad, and doesn&#x27;t even really remove all the glue from the eyelashes. I&#x27;d rather just let the glue fall off on its own than use this again!</li>
    <li> I bought this not knowing if it would work since I have never tried any lash remover but I am glad I purchased this because it works great. I get a q-tip and just keep rubbing on there until it comes off.</li>
    <li> This is great though I use it to remove regular lashes not singles. Just draw a little line across the lash line with a q tip and they come right off. Be careful not to get it in your eye, though it&#x27;s not terribly painful if you do. Great stuff!</li>
    <li> this works super well but keep your eyes cloths are you will never buy it again do not open your eyes what so ever when rubbing lash of with this product your eyes will feel like they are burning and getting stabbed at the same time keep eyes closed until you are done washing your face with face soap and water then open</li>
    <li> did not work it eats up the lashes</li>
    <li> The glue fume is strong. It burns the eye and irritate them.  It doesn&#x27;t remove the eyelash. It was worth a try but I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it to anyone. I also went to YouTube and watched different tutorials to see if there was a better way to use the product and there wasn&#x27;t. Product is just to harsh for anyone&#x27;s eyes</li>
    <li> this product burns like crazy if it gets into your eyes,,,omg!!!!!! it takes the lashes off anyway...hope i wont need it again</li>
    <li> Takes eyelashes off easy without damaging</li>
    <li> This stuff is great to remove those little globs of adhesive that want to stick to your lash line after you remove your lashes.  I just use a Q-tip and it comes off so easily!</li>
    <li> This product takes eyelash glue off pretty close to perfectly, would be perfect but it burns soo bad if you get it in your eyes which is pretty hard not to do considering it&#x27;s a liquid. If it wasn&#x27;t for the eye burning, I&#x27;d give 5 stars.</li>
</ol>
