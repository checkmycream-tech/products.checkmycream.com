      <li>The sea salt really helps heal it and the scent is really pleasant.</li>
      <li>Not only does it leave your skin smooth and hydrated but it smells great!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve even sent it to a very special friend in Italy.  </li>
      <li>By the way, what you get on the ship is pretty good hand lotion in its own right.</li>
      <li>and she loved it so much I bought some for her birthday.</li>
      <li>A friend commended this product and I loved it so much I ordered one for my daughter and one for a friend.</li>
      <li>I first tried this when staying at the Grand Californian at Disneyland and just love it.  </li>
      <li>settle for those cheap super market lotions!</li>
      <li>I liked this so much this was sent as part of a birthday gift to neice.</li>
      <li>this body butter leaves my skin smooth without being greasy.</li>
      <li>The smell goes away very fast but your skin stays very smooth.</li>
      <li>Nice and thick, with a beautiful smell.</li>
      <li>It goes on smoothly and has a wonderful but subtle fragrance.  </li>
      <li>As a guy, I have been complimented many times on how my skin looks vibrant, smooth and inviting to touch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>H2O has many products, I have tried several of them, the quality is always good and the products really work.</li>
      <li>Love it so much when it came out to purchase</li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall, probably good for the summer or when you don&#x27;t need deep moisturizing.  </li>
      <li>I am very particular about lotions and wouldn&#x27;t give it a great review if I wasn&#x27;t totally sold on the product.  </li>
      <li>It has a clean, fresh fragrance.  </li>
      <li>If your lips ever get super cracked, try a dab of this stuff on em.</li>
      <li>This particular product is great for people with dry skin who enjoy non-greasy moisturizers with a lite beachy fragrance.  </li>
      <li>The smell is pleasant and not strong or overpowering.  </li>
      <li>I first was introduced to it on a Disney Cruise.  </li>
      <li>Very moisterizing!</li>
      <li>First got this on R Disney cruise..</li>
      <li>First off, I am a man and didn&#x27;t want anything too smelly or anything that would over power any cologne I wanted to wear.</li>
      <li>Has a lovely smell and really hydrates your entire body.  </li>
      <li>This is the only product I have found that leaves my skin hydrated and looking smooth.  </li>
      <li>Love the product but can&#x27;t stand the idea that this vendor does NOT support our troops--would not mail to an APO (military) address.</li>
      <li>For deep moisturizing effect, I would suggest Shea products from L&#x27;Occitane, either the Shea Butter Lotion (with 15% Shea) or the Ultra Rich Body Creme with 25% Shea.  </li>
      <li>Considering the tube is only 8-oz size, it goes quickly.  </li>
      <li>This is manufactured by the same company that makes hand lotion for Disney cruise ships and is a little more concentrated and overall better than what you get on the ship.  </li>
      <li>Expensive however great product.</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t need to use a lot and my skin is super soft all day long ..</li>
      <li>My skin is soft all day!</li>
      <li>I use this all the time with the sea salt body wash and it makes my skin so soft!  </li>
      <li>I will continue to buy this even if I don&#x27;t live near a store.  </li>
      <li>After long days in the sun and water, my dry sun beaten skin felt so smooth and hydrated after using it.</li>
      <li>My lips were back to normal in no time!</li>
      <li>This product really does hydrate dry cracked winter weather beaten skin.  </li>
      <li>So far it&#x27;s the only thing that has worked on my cracked heels.</li>
      <li>I have very dry, sensitive skin.  </li>

<li> However, I found that after several hours, my skin felt dry again.  </li>
<li> It looks a little greasy right after you put it on, but it helps to seal in the moisture and goes away in a few minutes.  </li>
<li> Actually, for the first time ever I also got cracked feet just behind my toes on one foot.</li>
<li> It even gets my super dry hands soft and they get all cracked from the cold winter air.  </li>
<li> I use this a lot in the winter when my skin gets really dry and cracked.</li>
<li> (I have to note that it is the winter season when the dry heat indoors makes one&#x27;s skin drier.)  </li>
<li> My skin in the summer tends to get very dry and flakey.</li>
<li> I have very dry skin and</li>
<li> It even helps my very dry, cracked heels.  </li>
<li> It is goes on thick and moisturizes deeply.  </li>
<li> It has a slight smell of the lotion you use at the beach</li>
<li> I &#x27;ve used it for years, year round.  </li>
<li> However, after using this body butter for a few days it started improving.</li>
<li> Just wish it wasn&#x27;t so pricy :/...</li>
<li> No overwhelming smell and no greasy feel.  </li>
<li> It does go on thick</li>
<li> I asked for this product on my \\&quot;Secret Santa\\&quot; wishlist.</li>
<li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with H20 products.</li>
<li> And it was really bad.</li>

    <li> Great smell and good moisturizer..made a great gift..my daughter in law loves it great gift. Will order again for her</li>
    <li> This is a great body butter.  My skin in the summer tends to get very dry and flakey. This is the only product I have found that leaves my skin hydrated and looking smooth.  I am very particular about lotions and wouldn&#x27;t give it a great review if I wasn&#x27;t totally sold on the product.  Not only does it leave your skin smooth and hydrated but it smells great! You can&#x27;t go wrong with H20 products.</li>
    <li> Love the product but can&#x27;t stand the idea that this vendor does NOT support our troops--would not mail to an APO (military) address.</li>
    <li> I first tried this when staying at the Grand Californian at Disneyland and just love it.  I have very dry skin and this body butter leaves my skin smooth without being greasy.</li>
    <li> We discovered this product while staying at an inn on the Oregon Coast.  I love the feel and smell of these lotion.  Wish they would make this product with SPF 15 or 30.</li>
    <li> I have very dry, sensitive skin.  When I tried this, I just had to buy it, even online.  No overwhelming smell and no greasy feel.  It even helps my very dry, cracked heels.  I will continue to buy this even if I don&#x27;t live near a store.  I asked for this product on my \\&quot;Secret Santa\\&quot; wishlist.</li>
    <li> This is another one of my favorite H20+ Sea Salt products. I &#x27;ve used it for years, year round.  It has a clean, fresh fragrance.  It doesn&#x27;t feel sticky and tacky when the temps get up to 100+.  I&#x27;ve given it as gifts and many of my friends also love it.  I&#x27;ve even sent it to a very special friend in Italy.  She loves it too!!</li>

    <li> I liked this so much this was sent as part of a birthday gift to neice.</li>
    <li> happy with purchase and service</li>
    <li> I use this a lot in the winter when my skin gets really dry and cracked. The sea salt really helps heal it and the scent is really pleasant.</li>
    <li> Bought for wife and she likes it</li>
    <li> First got this on R Disney cruise.. Love it so much when it came out to purchase I did just that... Love love love it.</li>
    <li> I discovered this product in a hotel in Dublin and have been using it ever since!  Has a lovely smell and really hydrates your entire body.  H2O has many products, I have tried several of them, the quality is always good and the products really work.</li>
    <li> H2O products are the best!  This particular product is great for people with dry skin who enjoy non-greasy moisturizers with a lite beachy fragrance.  I would recommend, and have already recommended, this product to everyone.</li>
    <li> I purchased this item after using the H2o Body balm.  In my opinion the balms go on alot easier and are non greasy in comparison with this butter. Will not purchase again</li>
    <li> I used this Body Butter after my daily shower.  Thought it would complement my use of the Seal Salt body scrub. It is goes on thick and moisturizes deeply.  However, I found that after several hours, my skin felt dry again.  (I have to note that it is the winter season when the dry heat indoors makes one&#x27;s skin drier.)  Considering the tube is only 8-oz size, it goes quickly.  I had a second tube that I returned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, probably good for the summer or when you don&#x27;t need deep moisturizing.  For deep moisturizing effect, I would suggest Shea products from L&#x27;Occitane, either the Shea Butter Lotion (with 15% Shea) or the Ultra Rich Body Creme with 25% Shea.  During the holiday season, the Shea Butter Lotion comes in 16.9 oz size, otherwise it&#x27;s an 8.4 oz size comparablt to the H20 Body Butter in size.</li>
    <li> I got a sample of this lotion on a cruise and fell in love with it.  I had my mom try some and she loved it so much I bought some for her birthday. She is very picky when it comes to lotion and this is best she&#x27;s tried.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing. I first was introduced to it on a Disney Cruise.  Happy I was able to purchase it. Service was great from provider</li>
    <li> A friend commended this product and I loved it so much I ordered one for my daughter and one for a friend.</li>
    <li> I found this product at a bed and breakfast in Pacific Grove, California. So far it&#x27;s the only thing that has worked on my cracked heels. Actually, for the first time ever I also got cracked feet just behind my toes on one foot. And it was really bad. Tried several lotions and even a product that was specifically for cracked heals. Nothing worked. However, after using this body butter for a few days it started improving. Now it&#x27;s much better. It does go on thick but I think that&#x27;s one of the reasons it works on the feet. It seems to stay on even with socks.  Dale Miller</li>
    <li> I love this lotion!!! It smells devine, I wish they had a perfume that smelled like this. Very moisterizing!</li>
    <li> Expensive however great product.</li>
    <li> I discovered this stuff when I stayed a week in a classy hotel down in Disney World last year. After long days in the sun and water, my dry sun beaten skin felt so smooth and hydrated after using it. I decided to buy not one but two bottles when I got back. First off, I am a man and didn&#x27;t want anything too smelly or anything that would over power any cologne I wanted to wear. This stuff smells awesome. It has a slight smell of the lotion you use at the beach but it doesn&#x27;t smell cheap and is actually pleasant. The smell goes away very fast but your skin stays very smooth. As a guy, I have been complimented many times on how my skin looks vibrant, smooth and inviting to touch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t settle for those cheap super market lotions! Your skin is your body&#x27;s largest organ. Treat it well!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS. If your lips ever get super cracked, try a dab of this stuff on em. My lips were back to normal in no time!</li>
    <li> This is by far the best lotion I have ever used on my skin.  It goes on smoothly and has a wonderful but subtle fragrance.  My skin is soft all day!</li>
