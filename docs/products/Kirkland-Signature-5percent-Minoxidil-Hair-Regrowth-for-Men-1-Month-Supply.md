### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Great product, I am a three time breast cancer survivor and my hair always returned after chemotherapy, but this time I have severe thinning hair</li>
      <li>will be good</li>
      <li>Lol it&#x27;s not too many times</li>
      <li>great price and free shipping</li>
      <li>I chose this rating because the product really works to the extent of the name and is an awesome prouct</li>
      <li>According to the instruction, it would take up to one year for the full effectiveness, so I have to be patient to get my hair look good at my age again.</li>
      <li>Noticed some more growth.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s ok haven&#x27;t seen no results atbthis time when I do</li>
      <li>Make sure you are well-informed about Minoxidil before you start using it.</li>
      <li>, however i like what i see :)</li>
      <li>change YOUr diet and stay healthy, that&#x27;s just my advice.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m glad she did bc</li>
      <li>everything its ok until now regarding shipping and price</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s amazing how fast it worked!!!</li>
      <li>It looks thicker and covers up good the hair-loss areas that were so vivid before.</li>
      <li>Again thanks for such a GREAT price!</li>
      <li>Good product that actually grows hair.</li>
      <li>and I feel more confident walking outside as well as meeting people.</li>
      <li>, even eyebrows were almost gone, this product I can see results hair growing back, my hair will never be as i had it, but it sure looks a lot better,</li>
      <li>There were times the liquid would be near the top of my eyebrow</li>
      <li>It is just right for me whom it grew briskly.</li>
      <li>It stops dripping right around where my hair line is.</li>
      <li>Make sure you use a q-tip or something similar and take your time.</li>
      <li>Once you start, you might lose more hair until the &amp;#34;Rogaine hair&amp;#34; grows back in.</li>
      <li>Some side effects I got was lowered bp, dry skin/flaking (everyone gets this-use oliveoil or emu oil, works better than anything else on the market), and water retention/edema in the face (common side effect for some people, plus I was using a bit too much so it was getting absorbed more systemically, thus,  having this more pronounced side effect).</li>
      <li>Using for about a month in a half and i have great results in my facial hair.</li>
      <li>Bought this only for my beard, my hairline is fine.</li>
      <li>I know this is for the hair particularly the scalp, but I chose to use this on my eyebrows!</li>
      <li>Thanks.</li>
      <li>Fast delivery...</li>
      <li>did it ever really work??</li>
      <li>Good for filling in empty patches of facial hair.</li>
      <li>Also, since part of minox gets absorbed systemically, you will find some small growth of more hair on your chest, arms, etc..not much though.</li>
      <li>in plain plastic bag, and had no applicator which was replaced in 4 days - never again - you can do better elsewhere.</li>
      <li>30 plus new hairs on each sides of my cheeks are grown in.</li>
      <li>This may sound a bit odd, but I bought the Minoxidil for my eyebrows.</li>
      <li>Full results depending on the average person for filling in blank spots of their beard may take anywhere from 3-8 months, just take a look at the countless success stories on the internet regarding this for filling in the rest of a beard.</li>
      <li>I will write a second review if this stuff really worked on me.</li>
      <li>so far it has been a week or so</li>
      <li>so it&#x27;s too early to tell if it&#x27;s going to work yet.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;D go natural.</li>
      <li>Well I would definitely try a different one this one seems not to work pretty one</li>
      <li>Of course you need at least one month to see the exact effect, but it is clear that after the second week some narrow hairs growing for the first time and this is a miracle for a bald man!!!!</li>
      <li>I applied this with a sample mascara type wand to my eyebrows and ONLY my eyebrow area and noticed some new growth within about 2-3 weeks.</li>
      <li>Been using it for a month haven&#x27;t really seen results I just don&#x27;t like it because it makes your scalp really dry and flaky</li>
      <li>I eyebrows with success, not sure about hair.</li>
      <li>The beard hair growth stays with you after discontinuation, I even noticed increased growth after coming off due to the new vellus hairs created, still turning dormant.</li>

<li> I eyebrows with success, not sure about hair.</li>
<li> The beard hair growth stays with you after discontinuation, I even noticed increased growth after coming off due to the new vellus hairs created, still turning dormant.</li>
<li> And they are thick and dark, and strong.</li>
<li> not sure if the trade off is worth it thinning all my other hair.</li>
<li> If you&#x27;re using it just for eyebrows, this bottle will last you a long, long time.</li>
<li> My eyebrows were pretty thin</li>
<li> The regrowth speed is less than moderate with thinner hairs and it is 100% acceptable.</li>
<li> My hair has started to regrow about half of the month after using twice daily.</li>
<li> Got small blonde hairs coming in, but seems to make some of my regular hair fall out...</li>
<li> I applied this 2x/day (morning and evening) almost everyday for 2.5 months and saw that some of the hair from the bald spots started to sprout back but not all.  </li>
<li> Will check back in a few months to update.</li>
<li> I read a few reviews and saw that I was not the only one who received this product without the applicator.  </li>
<li> If you decide to try this on your eyes, BE CAREFUL!</li>
<li> I found it odd that a medication would ship without a box and the applicator.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Suspicious</li>
<li> I used this product to remedy my uneven eyebrows after the lady at the salon waxed my left eyebrows too thinly and left me with a few small bald spots.  </li>
<li> A little bit of Googling led me to Minoxidil, so I started applying it twice per day.</li>
<li> doesn&#x27;t work, waste of money</li>
<li> I am a female and since I was 15 I plucked my brows thin.</li>
<li> I&#x27;d say it partially worked but very slowly.  </li>
<li> Need to take down false pictures.</li>
<li> Its a plain old regular kirkland 5% minoxidil  solution, which gave me horrible itchy scalp before.</li>
<li> After years of using the foam version of this brand for preventative purposes, for some reason, earlier this year (2014), my scalp began having bad reactions to all minoxidil products, regardless of brand or type (foam/liquid).</li>
<li> I used this product for a couple of weeks and the side effects of nausea and bad headache outweighed the potential benefits of this</li>
<li> and i can see the little hairs coming out in the places i want, BUT it dries skin like crazy</li>
<li> I had a horrible appointment with a stylist who decided to go crazy on my eyebrows, tweezing way too much hair.</li>
<li> That&#x27;s just false advertising!</li>
<li> The result was depressing</li>
<li> Works well, but hate the shedding time.</li>

    <li> Works well, but hate the shedding time.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this for 1 month now so it&#x27;s too early to tell if it&#x27;s going to work yet. Will check back in a few months to update. Again thanks for such a GREAT price!</li>
    <li> Fast delivery...I got what I wanted..</li>
    <li> After years of using the foam version of this brand for preventative purposes, for some reason, earlier this year (2014), my scalp began having bad reactions to all minoxidil products, regardless of brand or type (foam/liquid). Don&#x27;t know if they changed the formula or something, but it&#x27;s now been 6 months that I stopped and there&#x27;s no difference in the amount of hair I have &#x3D; did it ever really work??</li>
    <li> Does not work, water in an (/*_*)/ opened container. This thing was not sealed, was hesitant to use it</li>
    <li> Used on eyebrows. Noticed some more growth. It&#x27;s def not overnight but I think it helped. Just brush on at night with a spooky brush.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok haven&#x27;t seen no results atbthis time when I do and if I do I will bebposted.</li>
    <li> I always been told generic ones work the same brand ones.  Well I would definitely try a different one this one seems not to work pretty one</li>
    <li> I think this product works you just have to be patient. If it does work it works slower than a turtle crawls.</li>
    <li> JUST save your money. I&#x27;D go natural. change YOUr diet and stay healthy, that&#x27;s just my advice. .... ... ...</li>
    <li> I chose this rating because the product really works to the extent of the name and is an awesome prouct</li>
    <li> but it doesn&#x27;t burn or run all over my neck or ears. It stops dripping right around where my hair line is. Too soon to say if it works or not.</li>
    <li> My hair has started to regrow about half of the month after using twice daily. It looks thicker and covers up good the hair-loss areas that were so vivid before. I am looked younger of course and I feel more confident walking outside as well as meeting people. The regrowth speed is less than moderate with thinner hairs and it is 100% acceptable. According to the instruction, it would take up to one year for the full effectiveness, so I have to be patient to get my hair look good at my age again.</li>
    <li> Finally grew my temple hair back using this product in conjunction with a derma roller</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s no mircle lets start off with that, i used this for facial hair, and it takes a while, so far it has been a week or so and i can see the little hairs coming out in the places i want, BUT it dries skin like crazy, however i like what i see :)</li>
    <li> Got small blonde hairs coming in, but seems to make some of my regular hair fall out... not sure if the trade off is worth it thinning all my other hair.</li>
    <li> I want to try this to grow out my eyebrows. I am a female and since I was 15 I plucked my brows thin. Now at the age of 28 I have places on my brows that hair won&#x27;t grow. I saw a video on YouTube where a chick said this will work so Im giving it a try. I will write a second review if this stuff really worked on me. I hope it does. Thanks.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this morning and night on my eyebrows and all I can say is IT WORKS!!! After years of over plucking and waxing I never thought id have eyebrows again. I saw a girl on YouTube reccomend this and I&#x27;m glad she did bc I have eyebrows again. And they are thick and dark, and strong. My friends were like who&#x27;s doing your brows and I told them what I was using now they want some too. Lol it&#x27;s not too many times u find things that actually work but this definitely does!!!</li>
    <li> everything its ok until now regarding shipping and price but we have to wait for effectiveness of course hope will be good</li>
    <li> I have been using this to help fill in sparse eyebrows. I use a q-tip to apply it twice a day. It took about four to six weeks to see results, but I definitely noticed a difference over time. If you&#x27;re using it just for eyebrows, this bottle will last you a long, long time.</li>
    <li> Good product that actually grows hair.</li>
    <li> Order was not for me though im told it works</li>
    <li> Great product, I am a three time breast cancer survivor and my hair always returned after chemotherapy, but this time I have severe thinning hair , even eyebrows were almost gone, this product I can see results hair growing back, my hair will never be as i had it, but it sure looks a lot better,</li>
    <li> I know this is for the hair particularly the scalp, but I chose to use this on my eyebrows! My eyebrows were pretty thin therefore I couldn&#x27;t shape them the way I wanted. I applied this with a sample mascara type wand to my eyebrows and ONLY my eyebrow area and noticed some new growth within about 2-3 weeks. I did this only at night time and sometimes in the AM on weekends. There were times the liquid would be near the top of my eyebrow and I actually started getting hair there too. I only tried this I eyebrows with success, not sure about hair. If you are looking to grow some eyebrow hair...give this a shot. There is also a YouTube video about using this for eyebrow hair regrowth</li>
    <li> I bought this to use on my eyebrows.  After a month there is noticeable regrowth.</li>
    <li> Of course you need at least one month to see the exact effect, but it is clear that after the second week some narrow hairs growing for the first time and this is a miracle for a bald man!!!!</li>
    <li> Bought this only for my beard, my hairline is fine. Good for filling in empty patches of facial hair. Part of my cheeks had bald spots where the follicles would not grow, after two weeks of 2ml a day (1ml am / 1ml pm), 30 plus new hairs on each sides of my cheeks are grown in. Also, since part of minox gets absorbed systemically, you will find some small growth of more hair on your chest, arms, etc..not much though. Full results depending on the average person for filling in blank spots of their beard may take anywhere from 3-8 months, just take a look at the countless success stories on the internet regarding this for filling in the rest of a beard. Some side effects I got was lowered bp, dry skin/flaking (everyone gets this-use oliveoil or emu oil, works better than anything else on the market), and water retention/edema in the face (common side effect for some people, plus I was using a bit too much so it was getting absorbed more systemically, thus,  having this more pronounced side effect). The beard hair growth stays with you after discontinuation, I even noticed increased growth after coming off due to the new vellus hairs created, still turning dormant.</li>
    <li> Caused severe allergic reaction. Have used others without problems. Had to go to dermatologist.</li>
    <li> It is just right for me whom it grew briskly. I am a Japanese.</li>
    <li> i just got it like yesday and am starting useing it and i think is cool,but lets wait and see if it wil work for me.</li>
    <li> Make sure you are well-informed about Minoxidil before you start using it. Once you start, you might lose more hair until the &amp;#34;Rogaine hair&amp;#34; grows back in. Then if you stop, you lose your hair again. I&#x27;d say this is a last resort.</li>
    <li> I read a few reviews and saw that I was not the only one who received this product without the applicator.  By the way it was shipped, I&#x27;m guessing this product can be sold by anybody.  I found it odd that a medication would ship without a box and the applicator.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Suspicious</li>
    <li> Using for about a month in a half and i have great results in my facial hair. I don&#x27;t need it for my head, just wanted my beard to get fuller</li>
    <li> I have a bald spot on the back of my head. After a week of using this product I saw hair coming out!! It&#x27;s amazing how fast it worked!!!</li>
    <li> in plain plastic bag, and had no applicator which was replaced in 4 days - never again - you can do better elsewhere.</li>
    <li> I used this product for a couple of weeks and the side effects of nausea and bad headache outweighed the potential benefits of this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No hair growth was noticed during the application period.</li>
    <li> Its a plain old regular kirkland 5% minoxidil  solution, which gave me horrible itchy scalp before. Thought it was foam looking at the pictures. Also, received it without the applier. Need to take down false pictures.</li>
    <li> This may sound a bit odd, but I bought the Minoxidil for my eyebrows. I had a horrible appointment with a stylist who decided to go crazy on my eyebrows, tweezing way too much hair. The result was depressing and I wanted to try to get them back to how they were before as quickly as possible. A little bit of Googling led me to Minoxidil, so I started applying it twice per day. If you decide to try this on your eyes, BE CAREFUL! You do not want this stuff getting in your eyes. Make sure you use a q-tip or something similar and take your time. Within a week of twice daily use I definitely noticed hair regrowth. Can I say for sure it was the Minoxidil, no, but I do believe it helped and my eyebrows no longer look frightening.</li>
    <li> I used this product to remedy my uneven eyebrows after the lady at the salon waxed my left eyebrows too thinly and left me with a few small bald spots.  I applied this 2x/day (morning and evening) almost everyday for 2.5 months and saw that some of the hair from the bald spots started to sprout back but not all.  I&#x27;d say it partially worked but very slowly.  This also dries up the skin underneath my eyebrow, so once every 2 weeks I would give my eyebrow a break from the product and just put moisturizer on it.</li>
    <li> doesn&#x27;t work, waste of money</li>
    <li> Been using it for a month haven&#x27;t really seen results I just don&#x27;t like it because it makes your scalp really dry and flaky</li>
    <li> i know you&#x27;re not supposed to, but i&#x27;ve been using them on my eyebrows. i&#x27;ve noticed hair growth when before there was nothing. would definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product thinking it was the FOAM product as the photos suggested. What I received was the LIQUID product with dropper. That&#x27;s just false advertising!</li>
    <li> great price and free shipping</li>
