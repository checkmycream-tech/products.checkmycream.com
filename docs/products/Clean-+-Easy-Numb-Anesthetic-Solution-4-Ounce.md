### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t expect it to be the best because it was cheap.</li>
      <li>Works really good</li>
      <li>, I liked it I will buy again.</li>
      <li>I liked it.</li>
      <li>I still have some discomfort, but this product defintely makes the experience more bearable.</li>
      <li>It did reduce my skin&#x27;s sensitivity and was able to sleep better, but it did not mention the side effects.  </li>
      <li>Nothing prevents the pain of waxing, but this product works better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
      <li>so I applied more.</li>
      <li>This product does not numb at all according to the instructions!!!</li>
      <li>Clean smelling</li>
      <li>so I got it really quickly.</li>
      <li>Works pretty well.  </li>
      <li>I tried several more times without a cotton ball, practically showering one test area in the liquid, and I was still in pain every time I tried to use my epilator.</li>
      <li>This product does exactly what it should: it numbs the surface of the skin where you are waxing.</li>
      <li>My first time</li>
      <li>so dries fast and with the alcohol</li>
      <li>The bottle was sent out fast</li>
      <li>This product works very well as an alternative to the numbing creams.  </li>
      <li>Try a different product possibly something with lidocain or novacain will hopefully work better.</li>
      <li>product could have easily been compromised, plus, half of it is missing!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I completely ignore the directions and just dump it onto the area I am waxing, rub it in, wash my hands, and let it sit for about 20 minutes before waxing.</li>
      <li>I applied directly to the area.</li>
      <li>When I do it my way, the product numbs the skin efficiently and makes waxing even sensitive areas nearly painless.</li>
      <li>Could barely even tell I had anything on.  </li>
      <li>Product is ok, but not great.</li>
      <li>I used this on the sensitive areas and it helped a little bit, but on the thicker skin, I did not feel much of a difference.</li>

    <li> I completely ignore the directions and just dump it onto the area I am waxing, rub it in, wash my hands, and let it sit for about 20 minutes before waxing. I don&#x27;t use a cotton ball or anything else to apply it. When I do it my way, the product numbs the skin efficiently and makes waxing even sensitive areas nearly painless.</li>
    <li> I applied directly to the area. After the time passed I felt no difference so I applied more. Still no difference. I tried on a different day and it was the same. I didn&#x27;t expect it to be the best because it was cheap. But this product didn&#x27;t work for me at all.</li>
    <li> I just received this Solution, it came in a bubble mailer. I opened it and found out that half the bottle has spilled inside the envelope.&lt;br /&gt;When I took the bottle out, I saw that the cap was half unscrewed and there was no safety cap to ensure there was no tampering with the solution.&lt;br /&gt;This product could have easily been compromised, plus, half of it is missing!&lt;br /&gt;I will request a refund.</li>
    <li> Works pretty well.  Doesn&#x27;t completely numb.</li>
    <li> Sorry.  Bought this to go with my dermaroller.  Could barely even tell I had anything on.  Will have to try some 4% or 5% Lidocaine cream.  Save your money.</li>
    <li> This is a pretty thin liquid so its put on with cotton ball. I wanted to use it before microneedling and it did take the edge off. Also, it has alcohol in it so dries fast and with the alcohol I figure I had 2 advantages of cleaning the skin and numbing it at the same time. I think if the liquid had been creamier I could have let it set on my skin to work. To compensate for the thin liquid, I gave my skin a second application.  I didn&#x27;t have to wipe off any excess either since it evaporated. The bottle was sent out fast so I got it really quickly. I think I needed to wait a couple more mnutes for it to numb deeper. My first time so I have some experimenting to do.</li>
    <li> This product does not numb at all according to the instructions!!! Even after applying layers there was no difference in the numbness of my skin.</li>
    <li> This product works very well as an alternative to the numbing creams.  It does sting the eyes a bit from the fumes.</li>
    <li> I used it only once.  It did reduce my skin&#x27;s sensitivity and was able to sleep better, but it did not mention the side effects.  I don&#x27;t want to be cured of one illness then get something more sinister.</li>
    <li> I like this solution because it numbs and also cleans at the same time.  put it on and only in a matter of minutes it numbs your skin.</li>
    <li> If this product does work it provides minimal numbing. Try a different product possibly something with lidocain or novacain will hopefully work better.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work that well...</li>
    <li> I used this on the sensitive areas and it helped a little bit, but on the thicker skin, I did not feel much of a difference.</li>
    <li> I read the instructions and I did what it said to do (Wipe on, let dry for 15 minutes) and I didnt notice a difference.</li>
    <li> This product does exactly what it should: it numbs the surface of the skin where you are waxing. Nothing prevents the pain of waxing, but this product works better than anything else I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product in hopes that it would take the edge off the pain of using a Derma Roller.  It helps.  I still have some discomfort, but this product defintely makes the experience more bearable.</li>
    <li> I had to put it on my face several times to get it to numb on the cheeks and forehead, but accidently got it on my lip and WOW it was numb fast. Clean smelling I liked it.</li>
    <li> I tried swabbing the solution on with a cotton ball, like the instructions said, before using my epilator (on my arms and legs). It would have been the same thing if I just rubbed plain old water on myself. I tried several more times without a cotton ball, practically showering one test area in the liquid, and I was still in pain every time I tried to use my epilator. It&#x27;s too late to return the epilator (and I actually like using it on my underarms), so the search continues for a REAL numbing cream.</li>
    <li> Works really good I bought it to put it on my face to use the derma roller, I liked it I will buy again.</li>
    <li> Product is ok, but not great.</li>
