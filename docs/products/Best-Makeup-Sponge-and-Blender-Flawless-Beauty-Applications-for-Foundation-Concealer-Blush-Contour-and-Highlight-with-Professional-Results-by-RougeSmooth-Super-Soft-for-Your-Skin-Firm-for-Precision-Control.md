<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Works great for blending! No more line on my jaw where the makeup ends!</li>
    <li> This is my first sponge blender and it works as described.  You have to read the instructions about wetting it before use and cleaning it.  This is important because it blends much differently when dry.</li>
    <li> I love it so much I&#x27;ve tried purchasing other beauty blender dupes but this is the best by far! it blends amazingly and its so soft I cant wait to purchase another!</li>
    <li> The sponge is easy to use, does not waste product, and makes blending nice. However, for me, it seems the makeup settles more into my pores than with a brush. This might be because I can control how lightly I blend better with a brush. Need to use a few more times to be sure.</li>
    <li> I love this makeup tool. There is a significant difference when applying make-up. I personally use this tool for applying my tinted moisturizer. I always used to use my fingers because my makeup is light coverage and easy to apply, but the moist sponge and dabbing process really make a difference on how it sits on my face. Love this product. On top of a quality tool, the company is just as amazing to guarantee client satisfaction! Very pleased with my purchase. I would recommend this tool and company to anyone.</li>
    <li> I love the sponge. I use it to apply my foundation. The shape of it allows me to apply to large areas and the small nooks like around my nose. It leaves my face with full coverage and no streaks.&lt;br /&gt;It is also easy to wash out and leave to dry so that it is clean and fresh.</li>
    <li> I had wanted to try the makeup sponge and when I saw this special I jumped on it and I am glad I did.  Blends foundation for a truly professional look I just could not achieve with my foundation brush. Highly recommend this blender. Great for cream blushes as well.</li>
    <li> I really like this makeup beauty blender sponge.  I use a large makeup brush to apply my foundation, but it leaves lines and streaks, I am able to use the blender sponge to smooth the lines out.  Easy to clean easy to use, I would recommend this to a friend.</li>
    <li> Best product for makeup users! I have never used these sponges &amp; blenders before, so this was my first time trying it. And I love it! I have been using it everyday since I got it. I don&#x27;t know how I ever went without it. So glad I got this!</li>
    <li> This is the second beauty blender I have used.  I recommend this highly to blend foundation for even, natural look.  Love the quality.</li>
    <li> I love this sponge. I purchased one 7 months ago, and just replaced it. I do not know how often they recommend replacing these, but it didn&#x27;t become discolored and &amp;#34;used&amp;#34; looking for about 6 months. I use it everyday and clean it off with a bit of my face wash, then leave it out to dry, and this seems to keep it in good condition. I travel often, and use the plastic cover it comes in to easily transport it. I definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> really soft  and blends really well! so far love it</li>
    <li> Sponge absorbs all the liquid makeup... it does not apply it evenly and it is a very firm sponge wet it doesn&#x27;t help at all.</li>
    <li> I am amazed at how well this little guy works for my mineral powder! It doesn&#x27;t leave specks all over my clothes! It holds the powder very well and spreads evenly. I was given the opportunity to try this sponge at a discount in exchange for an honest review. I had very little hopes for it since I do use mineral powder and not liquid foundation. I read the instructions and learned that I needed to wet the sponge and then wring it out well. I thought for sure my makeup would clump and not spread. But it did not! I don&#x27;t think I will ever go back to a brush for my foundation again!</li>
    <li> Excellent product! I love it!</li>
    <li> I love this product.  I do not use cosmetics everyday.  When I do I use this. It blends know the makeup flawlessly.  I love it it is easy to clean and very versatile.</li>
    <li> Awesome product, a beauty must-have.</li>
    <li> Wow.  I love it.  I like how it helps put makeup evenly on the face and neck without leaving spots.  I would buy it again.</li>
    <li> Im very happy with the makeup sponge, it work really good by blending my foundation until it looks flawless. I love this spinge. Thank you</li>
    <li> Love it. Nice alternative to  other sponges</li>
    <li> I own a beauty blender and to be honest,they are not different at all. I like the fact that it is a little thicker than the beauty blender because it it seems more durable and would last longer. It did a great job applying my foundation easily and beautifully. I recommend it and will continue to use it. Great product. I also wanted to add that company service was great.  My order arrives on time as promised and perfectly packaged.  Happy customer.</li>
    <li> This is a decent sponge and will do a fairly good job of blending your foundation. It is not an exact duplicate of the Beauty Blender- it&#x27;s larger in size, and is much denser than the beauty blender. I feel that it soaks up more of the product than the beauty blender does. However, it does grow when it&#x27;s wet, which is more than I can say for some of the other beauty blender tubes out there.</li>
    <li> This Beauty Blender really works and blended my concealer and foundation nicely without streaks. I wet it then squeezed the excess water and placed foundation on my hand and stippled it with the beauty blender, I then patted it unto my face and used the tip of it to reach my under eye area and nose. The sponge is very firm and not that squishy but it does a beautiful job of giving you that airbrush look.</li>
    <li> All the rage has been contouring - You&#x27;ve probably seen the youtube videos or the how to clips on other social media outlets. So of course I want to stay in the &amp;#34;know&amp;#34; and of course I want to give makeup the opportunity to transform my features. No, not really but I am interested in finding ways to ensure that my makeup doesn&#x27;t add to the fine lines, wrinkles and age spots. The reduced price that I purchased this Best Beauty Blender &amp; Makeup Sponge was an incentive that was appreciated however the full price and then some is what this product is worth! I use less foundation, concealer goes where I want it to go the first time which reduces the need for my concealer brush during the morning routine...Which we all know can honestly change the mood you&#x27;ve got out the door.. Saving foundation and concealer alone is a valid reason to make this investment. Why this color? Why this shape? Why this packaging? The size is perfect - it&#x27;s not so small that the surface area is used multiple times in a short time but not so large that it doesn&#x27;t fit well into your hand. The color - It&#x27;s fun! Stands out against many of the pink and red items. The packaging - Who doesn&#x27;t like butterflies?</li>
    <li> This is a great makeup sponge! Just follow the directions, and your foundation will look flawless.</li>
    <li> Perfect for a novice makeup user like me! After watching several youtube videos with makeup artists and everyday girls like me using these beauty blenders, i decided to give it a try. This blender works very well and washes easy with just a few drops of baby shampoo and warm water (air dry). Leaves it with a gentle soft scent and just like new with every wash. ( id recommend once a week or so). The tip works perfect for under eyes and i kept the plastic case for use when traveling.</li>
    <li> Everything it was designed to be! Perfect applicator.</li>
    <li> cute sponge. Seems to be good quality. Bought as  gift</li>
    <li> Great make-up blender! Works really well with my foundation. It doesn&#x27;t seem to absorb too much foundation. Very happy with this purchase!</li>
    <li> I purchased this with skepticism to replace my ancient make-up sponge.  I had some correspondence with customer service prior to my purchase, which was very helpful.  When I received it, I was still uncertain if it would fit my needs, but ordered another one anyway, so I had another as back-up or for different products.  The more I use it, the better I like it.  I find that it distributes my different products on my face with ease and better than I could with my sponge, which was my criteria.  It is also easy to clean.  The customer service sent me a handbook for the sponge&#x27;s uses and I am now very pleased with the product and would highly recommend it to other skeptics.</li>
    <li> Awful. This sponge is too hard and doesn&#x27;t distribute make up to your face at all. Total waste of money. Extremely disappointed.</li>
    <li> This makeup sponge is great, I find it blends very well, I wanted to give 5 stars but I find it doesn&#x27;t wash very well, so after a few weeks of use it seems to be time for a new one.</li>
    <li> I agree with the other reviews that this sponge is denser than other sponges/blenders I&#x27;ve tried but I expected that since it&#x27;s clearly stated that it&#x27;s dense on the product page. I actually like it being dense. I felt like it was it was easier to use than the less dense sponges and easier to hold. I often find myself squeezing the other ones rather than just holding them and bouncing it. This was easier to hold in my opinion not to mention cheaper and bigger than other ones I purchased previously. I like the way my foundation went on. It covered but felt like I was wearing nothing. However, I did find it difficult to clean it and found it takes much longer to dry. Overall I&#x27;m happy with it though and would recommend it.</li>
    <li> This is a great makeup sponge! It provides a very smooth application and an almost airbrushed effect. The recommendation to use it while wet was new to me and took some getting used to. At first I used it while it was way too wet and not much makeup stayed on my face. Then I started squeezing it in a towel after getting it wet so that it was only slightly damp. This works perfectly to give that very smooth, blended effect. The best feature is the tiny tip at the top. I have very visible red capillaries on the sides of my nose and this feature is perfect for getting the product in the tiny creases and thoroughly covering the imperfections. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> This is a great beauty product I love it</li>
    <li> All in all I like this product. I am not a professional make up artist by any means. I am just learning to contour and blend stuff. I will keep trying and see how it goes, but this seems to work well.</li>
    <li> Great quality. Firm but not too firm. Blends my makeup beautifully.</li>
    <li> I have been using this sponge for about a week now and I love it.&lt;br /&gt;This sponge makes my makeup application process so easy. It leaves me with an air brushed look that I love.&lt;br /&gt;In comparison to the original beauty blender, this sponge is much more dense which I actually prefer. The face that this sponge is a little more firm gives me more control over my makeup.&lt;br /&gt;Definitely would recommend.</li>
    <li> The order I placed got lost so I contacted Amazon to let them know. Not only was my account credited back but the seller,  Hamel Home and Beauty immediately reached out to me and sent me a replacement at no charge. This was a very nice and unexpected surprise. I&#x27;ve been using the blender since I received it and I am very happy with the quality of the product and how easy it makes applying foundation.  The finish it provides is great,  almost airbrushed. You can&#x27;t tell the difference between applying  the foundation with my brushes and the blender, other than the time it saves you! The end result looks professional, very natural and best of all, it only takes seconds! I will definitively repurchase this product.</li>
    <li> Wish I would have bought more! great item.</li>
    <li> These beauty sponges are amazing. Good quality and blends my foundation flawlessly</li>
    <li> I really enjoy the way this applies makeup! This is the first sponge of this type that I have ever uesd and I think it blends out my foundation perfectly. The very first time I used it I thought it was a little stiff but it seems the more I use it the bouncier it gets. I love it!</li>
    <li> Great beauty blender I really enjoyed using it once but, my dog tore it to pieces I think because of its bright color. Would recommend</li>
    <li> absolutely in love &amp;#60;3</li>
    <li> I dont like it. It does not work to well. To soft.</li>
    <li> I was really disappointed with this cosmetic sponge.  It wasn&#x27;t easy to use to apply foundation, almost clumsy, and difficult to wash after use also.  I&#x27;m a big fan of the Max Factor Cosmetic Sponge and now can&#x27;t find anything even slightly comparable.  I read the reviews prior to purchasing this sponge, most favorable, but it sure doesn&#x27;t work for me and I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it.  I&#x27;ll keep looking for a better replacement.</li>
    <li> Makes blending a breeze! Pointed tip is perfect for concealer and larger end for foundation. Cleans easily with soap and water.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m super happy with my Rouge Smooth applicator. I&#x27;ve purchased several makeup brushes for my foundation application over the years, only to have them relegated to the back of my makeup drawer and never used.  This Rouge Smooth is so much better.  It makes my skin look smooth and flawless, and is easy to use and store.  Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m really impressed with how smooth this product applies foundation! Much better than my experience using brushes or other makeup wedges. As I care about the environment and am used to most products being encased in bulky packaging the very simple, lightweight packaging design was quite refreshing. The prompt delivery and emailed e-book instructions were top-notch as well. I will definitely recommend this product to family and friends! :)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m just getting into wearing make up, like lip gloss and facial moisturizer are the only &amp;#34;make up&amp;#34; items I wear newbie, so I don&#x27;t know much about the majority of the products out there. However, I do know that all of the tutorials I&#x27;ve watched include the person using a blender sponge. As I mentioned, I&#x27;m new to make up, so purchasing an expensive sponge to perfect a technique I barely can grasp the concept of was not on my priority list. Instead, I was busy worrying about learning the difference between the different types of make up and their purposes. However, when I was offered the chance to try this blender at a discounted rate in exchange for my honest review I jumped on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most make up related item reviews are written by people who are pros at this stuff, not for newbies like myself. Everyone knows to put this on then that, you only blend it this much, etc. Meanwhile, the newbies are over here going cross eyed because we don&#x27;t understand. The sponge is cute and soft. Let me just say this, if you&#x27;re a newbie, you absolutely need a beauty blender. Apparently (Ok, I now know you&#x27;re supposed to, but prior to that I did question it) you&#x27;re supposed to make the blush and foundation blend. How in the world do you do something like that when these two items usually are not even remotely close in color or shade?! Insert the blender. Put your foundation on, you may or may not need the blender. I&#x27;ve done it both ways. How else will you learn what&#x27;s right and wrong? I like with the blender for this step simply because it&#x27;s easier for me, and to me, makes it look more natural (note the sponge should be wet for this step.... ask me how I know). Once the foundation is on apply your blush. Now you look like a clown. Blend the two together to make them mesh. I never do this by hand because it just doesn&#x27;t work. Once you have perfected these steps you feel like you can conquer the world!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In all seriousness, this little thing is magic. You can apply foundation, blush, and probably even eye make up, but I haven&#x27;t made it that far yet. It&#x27;s fairly easy to use and super easy to clean. I just recently found out if you use it dry you can remove your mistakes.... A must have in my world. I&#x27;ll be ordering a few more to have multiple options while doing my make up like the pros.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this sponge.  I found I used far less foundation than I normally do and it went on my face so much smoother.  The tip at the top of the sponge made it easy to smooth the foundation around my delicate eye area and smaller creases of my face.  I think it&#x27;s definitely worth the price as I know my expensive foundation will last much longer and look that much better on my skin.</li>
    <li> Always wanted to try this and when I got a special promotion, I jumped at the chance. This sponge is very dense which is great so as to not soak up all my makeup. Does a great job at blending. Love the pointed end, helps get right in the corners of the eyes.</li>
    <li> I actually love this beauty blender. I love that on one end it has a flat end for amazing spreadable coverage and the pointed to get the foundation in the creases of my nose.  I def give this a 5 star and will be recommending this to all my beauty friends on Facebook and Instagram!!</li>
    <li> Very nice blender!  It is a very high quality.  Arrived on time, no problems.  Love it!</li>
    <li> Love this little Blender!! I got it at a great price (On sale) and I wish that I had purchased more!! Super easy to clean and blends well. Will be buying another soon.</li>
    <li> RougeSmooth is a great for foundation and contouring.  I love to use the pointy end to apply a little highlighter under my eyes.  It makes my foundation look smooth.  I believe the quality of the RougeSmooth sponge is equal to (if not better than) the well known high-priced version.</li>
    <li> This works just as well as the &amp;#34;real&amp;#34; beauty blender. I had tried some cheap knock offs before and they sucked up a lot of product, which was wasteful. I did not find that these did that... and they are much cheaper. Good middle ground.</li>
    <li> My makeup has never gone on so smoothly prior to purchasing this! I love it!</li>
    <li> I was given this as a gift and love it.  So far I&#x27;ve used it for blush and eyeshadow applications. The narrow and wide edges are perfect for broad and narrow application and blending is so much easier. I&#x27;ve just ordered a second one to have on hand at work since I don&#x27;t always have time to do my makeup before arriving.</li>
    <li> Love this little sponge.....just what I needed!</li>
    <li> So, prior to actually ever OWNING a REAL and TRUE Beauty Blender, I thought that this was a decent sponge.  However, since for real trying a REAL Beauty Blender I have to edit this review to state my findings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Rouge Smooth when compared against the real thing is extremely hard and not anywhere near as pliable.  It just doesn&#x27;t do what the real thing can do.  There are times when I recommend going for the cheaper alternative, however this is NOT one of those times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This just ends up wasting space on my counter because I&#x27;ll never use it, even if my real one broke I&#x27;d go back to my icky sponge before using this.  Don&#x27;t waste your money, just get the real thing.</li>
    <li> Flawless make-up application.  I used to think brushes  and blending with my fingertips, was the way to go...but I have been  proven wrong.  This Beauty Blender Sponge is now my go to, for my make-up application.  My makeup looks amazing and flawless, when I use.  The book, is a definite bonus and is helpful!  Thank you!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this. Upon first opening the package I couldn&#x27;t believe how soft the blender is. This is my first blender sponge I&#x27;ve ever used and it will be my last. I have worried about these applicators because most contain latex which I am highly allergic. This product is latex free! I love it! It is my new go to foundation applicator and I love using the smaller side to apply and blend concealer. Would highly recommend!!</li>
    <li> TOO STIFF. Makeup just sits on top of it and doesn&#x27;t smooth well into skin.</li>
    <li> First of all--please note that this is not a Beauty Blender brand sponge.  This is a knock-off.  And it&#x27;s VERY firm even after it&#x27;s been soaked with water.  I found it to be hard on my face while dabbing and difficult to manipulate in order to blend my foundation and BB creams.  It felt like rock.  I would not purchase again.</li>
    <li> Such a great beauty blender and a great price too. I&#x27;ve ordered several different ones and this one is by far my favorite. I use it with my BB Cream and it gives me an airbrushed look and a nice even coverage. You can do your whole face with just this one blender. Definitely worth the investment, cleans up great too!</li>
    <li> I found this blender sponge through a friend and wanted to try it. I have another blender sponge that costs more and this did just as well as it. I highly recommend the Rouge Smooth Beauty Blender Sponge! It is comparable to other sponges and is cost friendly.</li>
    <li> small, easy to use, both sides are usable, great!</li>
    <li> This is the first and only beauty blender I have tried and I love it. Works great. Fast and easy in the mornings</li>
    <li> I have never used a beauty blender like this before, and using this the past week I&#x27;ll never go without again! What a difference it makes in my daily makeup routine! Great quality and a nice pop of color! I&#x27;m a life long customer now!</li>
    <li> I really like this makeup sponge. It has a fine point that comes in handy for under my eyes.</li>
    <li> This sponge is amazing for applying max-coverage of my mineral makeup! Will definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> This is a nice one. It&#x27;s a nice size and really does help in the application of foundation. Usually I use my fingers but now that I have this I can be more precise and thanks to the shape of it, I can areas around my nose. I like it.</li>
    <li> Totally love it!!!. I heard about beauty blender for awhile but this is the first time I use it and I completely satisfied with this product. It give me a natural look without looking cakey -  a problem I often have since I have dry skin. 10/10</li>
    <li> This little beauty blender is awesome. It blends my makeup evenly and it looks flawless. This blender is the best compared to other blenders I&#x27;ve used.</li>
    <li> Comparable to high end brand blender sponges. Im very impressed with the quality of this. Also, it doesn&#x27;t bleed out color when you first wash it as I have noticed with other similar items. I definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> I really like this sponge and all that I&#x27;ve used it for so far. It applied the concealer around my eyes evenly, and much better than my fingers ever do. I then used it to smooth/even out the mineral makeup I had applied to my entire face. The sponge left my makeup looking almost airbrushed. Blending is the key to all flawless makeup looks, and this sponge is great at helping achieve just that!</li>
    <li> I was browsing for makeup in Amazon when I stumbled with this product. It reminded me that using my fingers sometimes did not help with the acne. I decided to give it a try. This sponge is great!!!!! It blends my makeup perfectly. Ive been using it for 3 weeks and I can see the difference in my skin right away. Better complexion and NO ACNE!!!! My acne is disappearing very fast! I love it. The secret is to clean it thoroughly, like the instructions indicate, every time you use it!</li>
    <li> This is my first beauty blender and I am in love! It&#x27;s soft and easy to use/blend, once you run it under water it doubles in size and becomes easier to use while using  a liquid foundation. The company will send directions on how to use once you receive the product. I am very impressed!</li>
    <li> Works very well. I love it!</li>
    <li> This is the best beauty blender I own and I&#x27;ve had several. It doesn&#x27;t wast product and smooths makeup on my face perfectly.</li>
    <li> use this daily, love it. works just as well as my beauty blender. seriously love this! makes my makeup foundation application flawless</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not a daily makeup wearer. In fact, I use tinted moisturizers instead of foundation. But one thing I&#x27;ve found with some of the tinted moisturizers out there is that they don&#x27;t always go on smooth. I&#x27;ve tried the sponges you get at the drug store, and even Sephora brand, but was never pleased with the results. Enter this sponge. I get great even coverage that looks natural. It&#x27;s super easy to use, and feels soft on my skin. It&#x27;s easy to clean, it doesn&#x27;t over absorb product, and gives great results.</li>
    <li> This sponge works great with my foundation and cream products. It works just as good as more expensive sponges. This is a great alternative, save yourself some money!</li>
    <li> Works great for blending washes well and very well made I am happy with this product</li>
    <li> This sponge is the best out there and worth every penny!  It glides the foundation on smoothly and streak free! The pointed edge works perfectly around the eyes and nose. Just wash it and reuse it. This has saved me $$$$. Am so happy with this purchase that I plan to buy another one for my daughter who  will be thrilled with this makeup sponge. Thanks for this wonderful product that I no longer can live without!!! :-)</li>
    <li> Love this product! I use it every day! . Applies make up perfectly!</li>
    <li> Great application tool for liquid foundation. Provides a flawless and seamless application that feels light and airy. Durable and easy to wash. Orange color keeps things fun!</li>
    <li> I was very surprised at how well this beauty blender worked. I have tried the super expensive beauty blenders and other &amp;#34;cheaper&amp;#34; priced ones and this is the one I always grab now. I love how soft it is after getting it wet. My makeup goes on so smoothly with this. The blender is made of quality! My super expensive beauty blender started falling apart after a few weeks but this one is holding on strong. I highly recommend it! *Sample provided for testing and review*</li>
    <li> This is a really good product.  Not bad for the price.</li>
    <li> I love this! Its so soft.. And, it applies my foundation so well!  I wanted a beauty blender badly.  It was just so expensive.  This is a great alternative.</li>
    <li> I bought this little sponge not thinking it was going to do much, but I love it! My makeup goes on MUCH smoothier, It looks more natural and I&#x27;m using let product. I&#x27;ve used the pink sponge before and it just doesn&#x27;t work as well.  This product, Is amazing!</li>
    <li> Did it all! Make up is even, no streaking, got into corners and places easily. This is the best one!</li>
    <li> I really like this Makeup sponge! I wasn&#x27;t too sure because I don&#x27;t always use sponges to apply my makeup but this one is really easy to use! It works well especially with blending in foundation and even better than using makeup brushes. I love that it is reusable and so easy to use! It&#x27;s a Must-Have for makeup application.</li>
    <li> I received the RougeSmooth beauty sponges free for blog review.  I can&#x27;t begin to tell you how much I love this product.  I use my rougesmooth sponge daily and prefer it over the raved about beauty blender &amp; real techniques sponge.  I love the flawless airbrushed finish it provideds.  I also love the customer service of rougesmooth.  Very easy to reach via email &amp; other social media platforms.  I will definitely continue to purchase the rouge smooth beauty sponge.</li>
    <li> This is a very cool applicator!</li>
    <li> This was an excellent product!</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t know if the other reviews mentioned this, as I didn&#x27;t read them, but this is not a Beauty Blender brand sponge. I do not own one so I do not know how it compares, but it seems ok. Glad I didn&#x27;t pay full price, as I prefer the finish of a brush over a sponge anyway.</li>
    <li> Awesome blending sponge! I think it&#x27;s even better than the overpriced beauty blender! I can use it with either wet or dry products. And it leaves an amazing airbrushed look!</li>
    <li> Great product, and the egg makeup sponge performs just as well as the more expensive one I purchased from my beauty salon, but FAR better than the cheapie ones from the drug store!</li>
    <li> A great tool for your beauty regimen!</li>
    <li> This is by far my favorite of all the beauty blenders I have tried (and I&#x27;ve tried alot). It seemed to just blend my makeup so much smoother than the others I&#x27;ve tried.  I also like how it didn&#x27;t seem to suck up all my product.</li>
    <li> Bought it for my wife, who likes it. She says it goes on really smooth and makes her makeup look light. Though we did not receive the &amp;#34;eBook&amp;#34; I thought that was suppose to be emailed to me. Wasn&#x27;t sure if there are any other instructions, only the ones that came on back of package.</li>
    <li> Does an excellent job in applying makeup.  I would have never ever believed it without trying it.  Worth the money.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using a beautyblender for awhile, but I kept on having to replace the sponge after it would inevitably start to tear and pieces would start to fall off.  I&#x27;ve had a great experience with RougeSmooth, and haven&#x27;t had any of the issues that I&#x27;ve had with the beautyblender.  The customer service I received after asking questions was also great.</li>
    <li> I bought this one using a promotional code. I have to say this one looks just like the beauty blender I bought at Sephora except this is in orange. The material used looks nice. This is a great dupe if you do not want to spend $20 for the beauty blend sold at Sephora. The results on foundation looks almost identical. Please wash it with warm water before you use it for the first time.</li>
    <li> Very soft. Makeup application should go on very well</li>
    <li> In my option this works better than the 25$ original beauty blender I love it omg!!</li>
    <li> Easy to use, easy to clean, dries quickly and is cheaper than most beauty blenders.</li>
    <li> This came so quickly I was so happy! It is so soft and when you put it in the water it really expanded unlike cheap copies. Beyond happy with this!</li>
    <li> Wonderful makeup sponge, applies foundation evenly. Great size and durable.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m glad I hot this on sale because I didn&#x27;t like it at all. It seemed to &#x27;suck&#x27; in the product and just didn&#x27;t perform like a beauty blender at all.</li>
    <li> I am so in love with this Blender. The smooth, soft flawless application is perfection! great quality! I will be a customer for life!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t wear make up everyday, but I do love make up  when I take the time to do it. I consider myself to be at least an intermediate level as far as a non professional make up application is concerned. I used to work for a cosmetic company and gave people make overs etc so make up and I go way back, we are old pals. Except for liquid foundation ...... we just never quite hit it off and it just never looked right on me. So I&#x27;ve used a lot of powder foundation. I go through phases, sometimes I use Lancome Dual Finish, sometimes I use Mac Studio Fix, sometimes I use Bare Minerals. However, during the summer my skin develops these dark patches. No amount of sunscreen helps, they just happen. I do not wear make up everyday, but this summer I decided I wanted a  foundation with a little more cover for special evens when I want to cover those dark spots up. I spent a ton of money on a higher end liquid foundation and matching powder. I HATED how it looked on my face, you could see every single pore. So I bought an exfoliator and primer, still hated it, and a $38.00 foundation brush, still hated it. Over $200.00 later I stuck the make up in a drawer and gave up on it. Then, I tried this nifty little sponge. It made a world of difference. I washed and exfoliated, used a moisturizer and primer and applied the same foundation I gave up on with the moistened sponge. I also used the sponge to blend in my under eye concealer and I loved the results. I did use a little more product than I used to but I am going to try and dry the sponge a little more next time and see if that makes a difference.  I&#x27;m really satisfied with the results the sponge gave me and I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I love this beauty sponge!  It helps to blend everything flawlessly!  I highly recommend trying one for yourself if you haven&#x27;t already.  You will be very impressed with the results.  Totally worth the few bucks!</li>
    <li> When I first got this thing I was underwhelmed at it size and feel but was I wrong. The second I put it in water and it started to grow felt as if I would never buy a beauty blender from another company ever again. The feel is amazing and provides a good grip. It left absolutely NO streaks while applying make up and it rinsed off easily. Will definitely be buying again and again and again...</li>
    <li> While I do like this, it doesn&#x27;t compare to my BeautyBlender, but I&#x27;m a bit of a snob on that.</li>
    <li> This is a great product! The sponge is a bit more dense compared to the actual Beauty Blender sponge that most people are used to. It is a lot bigger in size but does do a good job. I gave it 4 stars because I feel the sponge is too dense and soaks up too much foundation compared to the Beauty Blender. Overall, I think it&#x27;s still a good alternative to the beauty blender, but for the price I would much rather spend it on the actual Beauty Blender sponge.</li>
    <li> This is my first Beauty Blender, and so far I am totally impressed! I used it to apply foundation, and it worked perfectly. The smaller end helps to get in harder to reach places like the corners of the eye or sides of the nose. And the texture of the sponge absorbs just enough make up for it to not drip off. I&#x27;m happy with it!</li>
    <li> Compared to the Real Techniques makeup sponge and the Original Beauty Blender, this has the smoothest texture. The pores on it are micro-fine which is why it is so smooth. It is denser than the other two brands I mentioned but still soft and has a bit more resistance when you are pressing it on your face. Is it exactly like the original beauty blender? No. I would say it feels more like the Real Techniques one (only smoother and denser) but with the shape of a beauty blender. And it is just as hard to wash the foundation out like the other two brands. I used the beauty blender cleanser to clean it out. I gave it 5 stars because I love how smooth it feels.</li>
    <li> My teenage daughter and I have been using the RougeSmooth to apply our makeup and both are very impressed.  My daughter says she likes it and will keep on using it because it seems to be working well.  I normally don&#x27;t use foundation but after applying foundation it with the RoughSmooth I have been using foundation daily!  I really like how the pointed soft tip lets makeup go onto my eye area beautifully.  I also like how you can wash it and use again later.  I&#x27;m impressed!</li>
    <li> I have been wanting to try a beauty blender but didn&#x27;t want to pay the price. This sponge is amazing,  my foundation goes on like a dream. I get full even coverage with little effort.  I definitely recommend this one, can&#x27;t beat the price and quality.</li>
    <li> I have heard so many great things about beauty blenders and I finally had a chance to try a Rouge Smooth. It has been an incredible and visible change to my makeup routine. In the past I&#x27;ve applied liquid foundation using my fingers or a kabuki brush. However, a beauty blender applies my liquid foundation evenly and blends lines easily. I have been impressed at how well my foundation looks and stays put after application. It also applies and blends concealer very well because I can use the tip of the blender around my eye area or hard to reach spots on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product is easy to clean. I wash it immediately after each use by applying organic baby shampoo and rinsing it out well.</li>
    <li> Easy to blend out make up, absorbs water well. Compareable to high end make up blenders.</li>
    <li> Love this makeup sponge! It gives a flawless makeup application every time!</li>
    <li> This is the first beauty blender that I have used. I love it so far. It is soft and easy to clean. I also love the fact that it has the tip which makes it easier to get foundation into the corners of my eyes well</li>
    <li> I love this blender sponge! I previously had one but was not loving it because it was not applying my foundation like I wanted it to. With this blender sponge my foundation goes on smooth and I get it to cover around my nose are easily.</li>
    <li> I own a beauty blender already but wanted to try a more dense sponge and this met those specifications.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am much more impressed with this sponge than I am with my previous beauty blender. I find myself reaching for this every morning and not even thinking twice about the BB.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;10/10 would recommend to everyone! It makes my foundation FLAWLESS.</li>
    <li> The Beauty Blender Sponge is the absolute best product of this type I have ever used.  The point at one end is perfect for applying concealer under the eyes and the round end blends foundation quickly and evenly.  I love this product and will recommend it to all my friends</li>
    <li> This is honestly one of the BEST blending sponges I own.. I LoVE LOvE LOVE  it :)</li>
    <li> Great makeup sponge. It&#x27;s applies my foundation super smooth. Compared to other sponges this one is MUCH denser. It&#x27;s a little difficult to squeeze water out when cleaning because it&#x27;s so thick but that&#x27;s good for applying foundation since it won&#x27;t dry out as fast as some sponges. The surface of this one is so smooth I know this will sound weird but it reminded me of the surface of a racket ball. That&#x27;s all I can compare it to. Except this is obviously a sponge and not hollow. It will absorb some product but that&#x27;s to be expected. All in all I recommend this to anyone who likes to apply their makeup with a damp sponge and wants an alternative to the more expensive version but a better quality than the drugstore ones.</li>
    <li> I considered this a high quality product.  You see these foam blenders every where and some can be a crappy loose foam material that really doesn&#x27;t have any effect on your makeup. But upon receiving this blender that is not the case. On top of that the company also sent out detailed instructions on how to use it which I though was very helpful.  Would definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s easy to use. A great new tool on my dressing table.</li>
    <li> Blends my foundation very well and evenly. I would recommend this product especially for the price.</li>
    <li> I got this as a gift from my husband along with other beauty products. This is not something I would normally buy or use, but after using it now for about a week I don&#x27;t know how I did without it all these years.  It helps me blend, contour and I even use it as a brush on some applications.  This is my first Beauty Blender and definitely not my last.</li>
    <li> This beauty blender is fantastic! I was a little worried about not getting one of the original name brand Luxie Lush ones, especially given the reviews on some of the other blenders here on Amazon, but I have been very pleasantly surprised at the quality and performance of this blender!&lt;br /&gt;As long as you follow instructions, i.e, dampen it and pat it dry with a towel, it works like magic!&lt;br /&gt;It also is way easier to clean than expected. I have used the little wedge sponges for a while, and this is so much better!&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this beauty blender, especially for a third of the price of the Luxie ones!</li>
    <li> I followed the cleaning directions recommended by the company. It was great at first, but then started to develop cracks. Though I like the way it puts on my makeup, the product deteriorates a little too quickly for me.</li>
    <li> When I first bought this I was hesitant because I wanted to buy the Beauty Blender but I didn&#x27;t want to pay full price for that. I have tried the beauty blender before and I really liked it. So I tried this out and it is just as good as the beauty blender if not better!! LOVE this product. So soft and easy to use and feels very high quality! Fast shipping too! Very pleased.</li>
    <li> It worked fine and it applies coverage nicely and evenly, but despite wetting it first as instructed, it still seem to absorb a lot of foundation.  So I feel like it is a more wasteful way to apply foundation in comparison to using a brush or fingers. That said, this was just as good as the more expensive beauty blender sponges out there, so if you like using a sponge, then this one is sure to please.</li>
    <li> Prior to this purchase, I never used any type of blender. I&#x27;m totally sold, this is so soft, and my make-up looks 100x better then before. I highly recommend this blender sponge!</li>
    <li> Works just great.  Trick is to dampen the sponge first then compress it with a towel. It is small but perfect.  I&#x27;ve tried other sponges (not in this particular shape) and I like this texture and shape best.</li>
    <li> By far, best blender sponge I&#x27;ve tried! Def will be ordering more.</li>
    <li> This sponge is such a godsend. I suck at applying makeup over all, but especially foundation and over the years I&#x27;ve just been getting suckered into buying progressively more expensive foundation in the hopes that it will look as good when I apply it as it does when the MAC sales associate does. This sponge does that! It has made even my cheaply Walgreen&#x27;s foundation look amazing! Happy client</li>
    <li> I am absolutely amazed at how well this product works I was giving a coupon code and I was a little skeptical at first but let me say it made a huge difference in the way my foundation looked after I applied it, when you get it wet it is super soft and I just applied it in a sponging (like sponge painting)type motion and it looked great. and the packaging is super cute too</li>
    <li> This sponge is just as good as the &amp;#34;namebrand&amp;#34; beauty sponge that costs so much more. It blends makeup beautifully and holds up through washings. Give it a try!</li>
    <li> This makeup sponge is sooooo soft I LOVE IT!!  I have tried a similar cheaper one that does the trick but this was a major difference! It blended so nicely and makes your skin look flawless! I&#x27;ve never tried the big named one that everyone talks about but this one looks the same as that one and is Definitely a better deal... So I would recommend the RougeSmooth to everyone looking for a great deal AND a awesome and soft product, you can&#x27;t go wrong!!</li>
    <li> Great beauty blender works just as well as beauty blender brand .</li>
    <li> I was given this product for an honest review.&lt;br /&gt;Works amazingly!! Just like the original brand name beauty sponge. It expands like it&#x27;s supposed to, is soft and easy to use. Gives you air brushed results quickly with minimal effort. I&#x27;ve been using mine for over a month and haven&#x27;t had any holes or pieces coming off like with other cheaper dupes so I know that it is well worth the money. I completely recommend this beauty sponge vs the one that&#x27;s a bit more expensive because you&#x27;d be getting your monies worth and supporting a great business owner!</li>
    <li> I am very happy with my RougeSmooth. I&#x27;ve tried other other blender spongers but hadn&#x27;t really had the success I&#x27;ve had with this product. The shape is perfect for blending any angle or area of your face. I love that it&#x27;s easy to clean. I&#x27;ll definitely be purchasing another one.</li>
    <li> great product will buy again</li>
    <li> You need to try this love it.</li>
    <li> Way to gummy to be a BB. I have the real beauty blender and it does not compare.</li>
    <li> this beauty blender works just as well if not better than the more expensive ones on the market. It applies my makeup so well.</li>
    <li> wish i would&#x27;ve bought more! great item.</li>
    <li> I love this item, works as directed!  Awesome instructions!  I highly recommend this item and would buy it again!</li>
    <li> It is awesome. It does the job and i am really happy with the material</li>
    <li> This beuaty blender works very well for blending!</li>
    <li> I purchased this blender sponge and I love it. I was skeptical at first but my sis told me to get it. I&#x27;m so glad I did. It does it job n its a lot better than the reg blender!</li>
    <li> This sponge does a perfect job in blending my foundation. Does a much better job than foundation brushes. The application is even, no streaks.</li>
</ol>
