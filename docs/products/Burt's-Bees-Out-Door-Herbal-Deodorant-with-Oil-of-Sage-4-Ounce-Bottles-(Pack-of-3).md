<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I read rave reviews and purchased a 3-pack, thinking I&#x27;d love this deodorant. After trying many natural deodorants though, this was my least favorite. Not only does it give a very strong sting after shaving, it also did not work for me one bit and smells much more like insect repellent than deodorant. Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> That&#x27;s a natural body function that has to happen, whether we like it or not. That&#x27;s on the bottle too. And when you think about it, much as we may not like it, it&#x27;s true - it has to happen so our bodies can get rid of heat and cool down. But this is a natural, wonderful smelling deodorant with soothing oil of sage if you&#x27;re a little sore from razor burn. The scent is light yet determined, so you&#x27;re not going to have to worry about offensive B.O., but it will allow your body to do what it naturally has to do without chemically trying to alter the way you physically function. It doesn&#x27;t leave a residue on clothes (hasn&#x27;t so far for me, and i wear a lot of black), comes in an attractive bottle, so if you want to carry it with you, it&#x27;s pretty enough and looks like a body scent so you can (and then re-apply liberally if you&#x27;re feeling the need - but you shouldn&#x27;t, cause this does it&#x27;s job effectively). Made with natural ingredients, made to work in concert with your body instead of masking your natural body function, I&#x27;ve dumped all my sticks and sprays and have gone exclusively with Burt&#x27;s Bees Out Door Herbal Deodorant. Slowly but surely, Burt&#x27;s Bees is taking the place of the more complex, chemical items in my beauty and body regimen, and I feel healthier and better for doing so. I actually feel MORE confident with this deodorizer than all my previous anti-antiperspirants/deodorants. And it won&#x27;t dry or damage or irritate your skin, either!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Burt&#x27;s Bees Out Door Herbal Deodorant for several years.  The price has gone up, the size of the bottle has changed, but the quality is the same.  This is absolutely the only deodorant that works reasonably well and does not irritate my skin.  The scent is okay and wears off soon.  It is effective for about 12 hours.  It has no chemical irritants, so you can use it daily, or twice a day if you need it.  My wife says it works, and that is what counts.</li>
    <li> This Deo has a natural refreshing scent. Very light and non greasy on the skin and works great all day long.</li>
    <li> I have always liked this product. It works from a deodorant perspective and I like the notion of a product that is not sweet or fruity like many deodorant are.</li>
    <li> This product actually works. I would never buy this kind of product for the price, but a friend gave me a mostly used bottle to try. It actually worked, and it was really neutral. It keeps you from smelling bad, but it doesn&#x27;t give off the same kind of strong, perfume smell that most antiperspirants or deodorants do. If it&#x27;s a really hot and humid day, or if you&#x27;re going to be doing a lot of physical work, then I&#x27;d go with an antiperspirant. It&#x27;s not magic, and if you sweat a whole lot then you&#x27;ll smell somewhat at the end of the day. But for most days in an office or a cold day, it&#x27;s perfect and won&#x27;t make outer clothes smell so you can wear them more than once between washings.</li>
    <li> So far this is the best deodorant that I have found in regards af being natural ingredient based as well as being able to perform how a deodorant needs to perform.  its even holds up to workin outside on a summer day.  I just hope they keep selling it.</li>
    <li> I really like this stuff. I&#x27;ve used all the natural deodorants and this one is great,  Works for me even on the hottest of days &amp; I think the sage is good for your sweat glands. I had no problem with stinging on application, (everything stings after shaving.I also drink a lot of water with lemon juice to amp up the properties. Hope they don&#x27;t change the formula.</li>
    <li> Pros&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used this deodorant for years without issue.  It contains good ingredients, has a pleasant scent (it&#x27;s not fruity or perfume-y, more of an earthy scent), and is not an a antiperspirant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;If you want a flowery scented smell, this is not the deodorant for you.&lt;br /&gt;Unlike some antiperspirants, you will need to apply this everyday.</li>
    <li> Great delivery time for a great product!!!</li>
    <li> Best natural deodorant.  I NEVER thought I&#x27;d be buying deodorant online- E V E R ! ! !  But I live in Chicago and the Whole Foods on Halsted where I usually buy it has been out for a week.  I got frustrated because this morning I&#x27;m now completely out.  I called the Whole Foods on Ashland- they were also out.  The next closest one was about 7 miles away on Kingsbury and THEY were all out and said it&#x27;s on back order.  WTF! Really?!  I can&#x27;t get my deoderant anywhere aournd here today?!.  I have tried at least four or five other natural deodorants before settling on Burts which I&#x27;ve been using for about 3 years now and works great.  So here I am... on line early Sunday morning ordering deoderant online.  I&#x27;ll probably have to go out and buy an inferior one to use for a couple days while I&#x27;m waiting on this 3-pack to come in...  I&#x27;ll throw out the inferior one when the Burts arrives.  ...This is my first review- I&#x27;m off to the gym where I guess I&#x27;ll work out this morning without deodorant...  I feel sorry for the people around me...  Have a good day!</li>
    <li> Best Herbal Deodorant there is. Just too bad its not sold in any stores....</li>
    <li> I really love this stuff. Doesn&#x27;t give me a rash, doesn&#x27;t keep me from sweating (just stinking). Lasts about 3-4 months per bottle. Bought 3 bottles last year and just bought another three this year. Great stuff.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff.  I used to buy Weleda&#x27;s sage deodorant, but it is quite expensive.  Buying this in quanitity saves me money and it smells just as great and works just as well.  I do sometimes have to spritz again towards the end of the day, but don&#x27;t mind that at all as I find it a refreshing lift.  I have had people ask me what I am wearing that smells so good, and they are surprised to find it is my deodorant!  It is a great if you like a clean outdoorsy scent.</li>
    <li> When I saw that a previous reviewer rated this with only one star I had to speak out in defense of what I feel is a wonderful product. I find this deodorant to be highly effective and not liking perfumy fragrances I really enjoy the sagey outdoorsy scent. It is rather expensive but I feel worth the cost - if one did not have to add shipping costs on to the product price. While Burt&#x27;s Bees products are sold in my area this one is non-existent so I am always forced to buy online.  Everyone has personal preferences on personal hygiene products and one product that works great for one person may not work as well on another. I have been using and enjoying this deodorant for several years and having a fairly reasonable social life and a good group of friends I imagine that it is effective.</li>
    <li> This is the only deoderant that my husband will use! It smells so good and also works very well!</li>
    <li> This is NOT an antiperspirant! You will sweat! I will admit it does have a strong smell when first applied that I wasn&#x27;t too fond of.I figured as with anything else and since I paid for it,why not give it a chance.I&#x27;d say it took me about a week to get used to the smell and i even like it now.I like this much more than homemade products that use baking soda or other powders..I do have to spray a few times a day but only when its really hot outside or I&#x27;m doing something involving a lot of activity .This doesn&#x27;t bother me because I think the trade off of not putting poison in my body is worth the 30 seconds  it takes to do this.Hope that helps somebody!</li>
    <li> This is the best deodorant Ive ever used. I don&#x27;t like smelling like artificial fruit, or a baby, or fake overly sweet flowers. I have a very sensitive nose and can only wear natural perfumes. This smells like sage and lemon and is never cloying or overpowering. My son kept stealing the original bottle I bought so I bought a three pack to appease him. If you don&#x27;t like sage or detest &amp;#34;hippie smells&amp;#34; this is not the product for you. As far as keeping my BO at bay, it totally works. The fact that it also works for my teenage son speaks volumes. Essential oils like sage and lemon are antimicrobial and antibacterial, so it doesn&#x27;t just cover up your stank pits with sweet violet dreams or whatever, it kills the funk.</li>
    <li> This seemed a great option when going aluminum free. I would give it a higher rating but for the fact that it didn&#x27;t keep body odor away all day. I would suggest that if you washed your underarm area, and reapplied it at least once later in the day, it would be better. For people who don&#x27;t need something stronger this product would be wonderful.</li>
    <li> Last year I started to suddenly get huge boils under my arms and eventually figured out it was the anti-perspirant.  After trying a couple of other brands of natural deodorant, I settled on this one.  It has a very nice, fresh and subtle scent.  It works pretty well for deodorizing unless you&#x27;re in a very high-stress situation, when you should probably apply it again.  Also, be aware that since it&#x27;s not an anti-perspirant, you will probably get wet under your arms sometimes.  But this is a good product, it does what it is supposed to do and I&#x27;m very happy with it overall.</li>
    <li> I really like this deodorant- it works very well under 99% of situations but like others have said you do perspire so don&#x27;t be surprised. The fragrance is intense when you first put it on but it fades quickly- I like it its very \\&quot;sage-ey\\&quot; and does not interfere with other lotions or perfumes you might apply.&lt;br /&gt;I always got this at Whole Foods or other Health type stores but it seems no one is carrying it right now?? Having three gives me plenty of back-up.  The product came fast and was packaged well.</li>
    <li> Great product.  Everything else on the market either didn&#x27;t work or gave my husband a rash.  Smells a lot like sage.</li>
    <li> Just the best when it comes to a completely safe, natural, and effective deodorant. It really works.&lt;br /&gt;It is important to realize that is that it is not an antiperspirant, just a deodorant. Here is what it says on the bottle:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;Unlike many antiperspirants which contain aluminum and other synthetic ingredients, Burt&#x27;s Bee&#x27;s Herbal Deodorant does not prevent the body from perspiring, which is a natural cleansing process necessary to release toxins.&lt;br /&gt;Instead, our essential oil blend of sage, lemon, and lavender helps to minimize and neutralize odors naturally. You&#x27;ll love the fresh, spicy herbaceous fragrance of our natural ingredients.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Great product . Have used it for years and am happy with it. I do wish they could make a version with a more feminine scent</li>
    <li> This works really well as far as deodorant goes.&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t contain antiperspirant but I hardly noticed. Smells really pleasant.&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to use this.</li>
    <li> My go to deodorant for forever!</li>
    <li> I still smell after a couple of hours, but it&#x27;s perfect to use when lounging around the house and going on light errands (when you aren&#x27;t in close contact with other people). I can&#x27;t foresee myself using this on a hot summer&#x27;s day though, or when exercising...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh! And might I add that I love the smell?!</li>
    <li> I love this product!!!</li>
    <li> This is a great choice if you prefer deodorant.  I bought it because it is all natural and it was recommended by my daughter.</li>
    <li> Not sure about everyone else but all 3 of mine where bug spray....this item is mismatched.  That said, I have the bug spray and it is great, but this item is mismarked.</li>
    <li> I began looking for a deodorant that would satisfy three conditions: that it works, that it&#x27;s non-irritating, and that it&#x27;s truly natural/safe (as rated on the Skin Deep cosmetics web site).  This product meets all three, at least for me.  I would highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> This is the best deodorant I&#x27;ve ever had. It&#x27;s natural ingredients doesn&#x27;t prevent you from sweating, but it totally masks any bad odors. I keep it in my car all the time for a quick spritz whenever needed.</li>
    <li> This stuff stinks and doesn&#x27;t deodorize! I found something else that is much much better at my local grocery store and it&#x27;s much cheaper as well.</li>
    <li> My husband uses this and it works very well for his man-stink.  I use it occasionally, but the smell is more manly, in my opinion.  It&#x27;s a good smell, herby, but not very feminine.  I&#x27;d love to see a version with a more citrus smell, like grapefruit (not perfumy).  This is hard to find in-store, so I&#x27;m glad to get a good price on it online!</li>
    <li> I like it and had heard you didn&#x27;t make it any more. So when in saw a pack of 3 available for a good price I grabbed it.</li>
    <li> I love Burts Bees products...That&#x27;s why I decided to try their deodorant.  I am trying to use all natural products and hated the idea of chemicals in my regular deodorant.  I have to say that I don&#x27;t miss the old chemical laden junk I used to use!  I like the scent...very herbal.  I did have to get used to actually sweating again because this is not an antiperspirant.  It was news to me that we need to sweat, which is how our body gets rid of toxins and all that...  I don&#x27;t usually have to reapply, but every once in a while, I do.  That&#x27;s why I keep a spare in my purse.  So, give it a try!</li>
    <li> I was very disappointed in this product. The spray itself smells good, but just does NOT do the job as a deodorant. Not only that, but if you shave your underarms at all - this stuff will sting and burn! Ouch! I know you&#x27;re not supposed to put on deodorant right after you shave, but even hours afterward it hurt to put this stuff on.</li>
    <li> I love this product so much I had to order a whole batch of it because it&#x27;s not easy to find in the store when you run out. The last time I ran out, I hated having to switch back to regular deodorant until the new stuff came in. It does just what it says - it doesn&#x27;t prevent you from sweating, but it helps you to smell better. I also like it because it doesn&#x27;t stain my shirts like your typical deodorants do.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been getting more and more concerned about the toxins we use on our bodies.  I&#x27;ve tried using regular deodorants (not natural)in the past, but I couldn&#x27;t even handle my own smell.  I can sweat pretty heavily, and this week I put my new deodorant to the test.  I have an almost six month old baby at home, so you can imagine I don&#x27;t just sit around all day.  I also teach elementary music part-time.  Neither of those things for me caused ANY odor this week.  Friday was the ultimate test - I had a dance lesson in about 80 degree weather (definitely sweat through all of my clothes), gardened in the afternoon (same weather), and then went bowling that night.  I intentionally never showered or changed my clothes.  I think I felt more fresh that night than I ever have with a chemical antiperspirant.  Even if you are a heavy sweater and are very skeptical, try it out.  It&#x27;s worth it for your body.  I just ordered myself a 3-pack so I&#x27;ll have a supply for a while.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this stuff for years.  I love it.  It doesn&#x27;t stain my tee shirts or give me cancer.  People always ask what that great cologne is I&#x27;m wearing.  I don&#x27;t wear cologne!  Only Burt&#x27;s Defender Herbal Deodorant.</li>
    <li> Great product.  Only thing I can use</li>
    <li> PURCHASED THIS SPRAY IN BULK. EASY TO USE AND CHEMICAL FREE. PLUS, NOT TESTED ON ANIMALS AND MADE HERE IN U.S.A. HERBAL SCENTED YET NOT OVER POWERING THE NATURAL SCENT WE MEN PRODUCE.</li>
    <li> Wonderful for mosquito and noseeum bug bites.</li>
    <li> To me this is the best chemical-free deodorant around. It has no aluminum or alum -- and the sage, lavender, and lemon oils do a good job of day-long deodorizing (I live in Hawaii, so that&#x27;s saying a lot).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Weleda used to produce very good herbal deodorants, but the quality of them has gone way down in the past several years -- now they even smell bad. If you were once used to the old good Weleda sage deodorant, Burt&#x27;s Bees is the best brand now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One interesting tip is that if you want extra protection (not really needed, but some folks feel the need), just rub some lavender oil under your arms before you spray on the Burt&#x27;s Bees deodorant. Lavender is a strong but non-irritating anti-microbial. A second choice could be that on really hot and sweaty days, you could spray on the Burt&#x27;s Bees, and then on top of that apply an all-natural roll-on deodorant. Either method works like a charm if you are overly nervous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lastly, I&#x27;d like to remind people that this Burt&#x27;s Bees deodorant has been very favorably reviewed elsewhere on Amazon: [[ASIN:B002DPUY6U Burt&#x27;s Bees Herbal Deodorant, 4-Ounce Bottles (Pack of 2)]]. This 3-pack is the best deal however.</li>
    <li> GREAT PRODUCT. GOOD PRICE. FAST SHIPPING.</li>
    <li> Not real crazy about this.  Wish I had only bought 1 bottle to try instead of a 3 pack.  The smell is very strong.</li>
    <li> I buy this for my older adult children, they love it!</li>
    <li> I can only hope that BBs keeps this item in their manufacturing list. I&#x27;ve been using it for years, and will as long as they make it.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t tolerate other deodorants that are sold commercially. For some reason they all cause an itchy rash.  This spray works great.  It is not sticky, and keeps the odor away most of the day.</li>
    <li> this stuff smells good but doesnt work...secret is so much better</li>
    <li> This is a great deodorant for those who don&#x27;t like to use an antiperspirant.  It contains no aluminum or ingredients that I see as being harmful to the body.  That is why I started using it.  Personally, I think the smell is wonderful.  Very fresh, pretty strong, and can be used for either a man or woman.  It smells very herbal and almost spicy.  The scent lasts a while too.  It does sting if you spray it on right after shaving, but only for a minute and is bearable.  Depending on how much you sweat depends how this is going to work for you.  I guess I sweat an average amount, and since this is not an antiperspirant, it does not stop you from sweating.  It simply helps smelling like body odor. Sweating out the toxins in your body is a natural bodily process and I don&#x27;t want to inhibit that and clog my pores with aluminum everyday, and that is why I like this product.  I would give it 5 stars if it lasted all day for me.  I know that for some people it does and that is great for them, but I can tell by the afternoon that I am starting to smell a little sometimes, especially in warmer months.  It probably wouldn&#x27;t work so good for someone who does a lot of physical work or is into working out hardcore. Despite this, I will continue to buy this product anyway because the pros outweigh the cons.  I can just reapply it if necessary to freshen up.  The price is reasonable as well, costing a little more than drugstore antiperspirants/deodorants.</li>
    <li> I ordered Burt&#x27;s Bees Outdoor Herbal Deodorant in the 3-pack after first trying it.  I love the scent, the fact that it is aluminimum-free, and it works well. I apply a lavender dusting powder after the spray is dried.  Wish I could find in local stores, but so far, I see it only online.</li>
    <li> Apply liberally - works great! Smells nice too, doesn&#x27;t change throughout the day like some fragrances. It&#x27;s not going to work like your standard anti-perspirant, but then again you won&#x27;t get Alzheimers, either. Good stuff.</li>
    <li> Is very good and without aluminum products in most of the deodorant</li>
    <li> Smells good but takes time to get used to. Sometimes by bo pokes through and need something extra to cover up. Nice and light. Overall good product.</li>
    <li> This is a great product.  Love the natural sage fragrance, and it lasts all day at work plus through a yoga or spin class afterwards. Very impressed, was prepared not to like it and was pleasantly surprised.</li>
    <li> My pediatrician recommended that my children use an aluminum free deodorant since there may be a link between aluminum antiperspirants and breast cancer.  So I have been looking for some time to find an aluminum free deodorant that would actually work for my son.  I couldn&#x27;t be happier.  It works very well and has a pleasant sage smell that&#x27;s neutral enough for either a man or a woman.</li>
    <li> This beats anything form the grocery store and lasts soooo long since it is not aerosol. Good stuff and hard to find elsewhere.</li>
    <li> Of all the various &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; products tried in the past this one actually works.  The sent is light and not overpowering.</li>
    <li> Great product. Fast delivery. Thanks</li>
    <li> Due to a severe latex allergy, I am becoming allergic to just about everything under the sun. Seriously, my list of allergens is now longer than a page.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Last summer/fall I started making my own deodorant as I was reacting to everything else I had tried over the counter. It was working great, though a bit messy- until I became allergic to TWO of the ingredients I used to make them. (This was a four-ingredient deodorant, mind you.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In desperation I began once again searching high and low for options. I hated putting straight baking soda on my pits, even though I went for the aluminum-free brands. I had given up hope, until my hubby came home with this deodorant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why is referred to as \\&quot;outdoor\\&quot; deodorant is beyond me. But the jist of it is, I don&#x27;t react to it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Granted, it doesn&#x27;t last all day so if I forget to reapply, I do start to stink. I am quite the sweater, after all. But it works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Free of toxic crap, with a light and tolerable scent, this deodorant would be just fine used by man or woman. While I don&#x27;t know about the source of the alcohol in this product (my only gripe), I am allergic to wheat, soy, rice, and corn, and have not reacted in any way to it, with the exception of the one time I accidentally sprayed myself in the face. (Oops!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do note that this is NOT an anti-perspirant. You shouldn&#x27;t be wearing an anti-perspirant, anyways, as we NEED to sweat. Some of us more than others. :-p</li>
    <li> Smell is very very potent.  I think the only thing it does is mask the odor, is all. So I cant really make a review.  I do love Berts Bees and will stick with their other products</li>
    <li> Greatest for those allergic to standard do&#x27;s</li>
    <li> This worked the first few weeks. But after that it doesn&#x27;t work that well. And the reason why I got it was because there is no aluminum. But it comes in an Aluminum container... it should be in glass. It&#x27;s just as bad as aluminum in the deoderant.  I&#x27;m still looking for a good aluminum free product.</li>
    <li> This is not a sweat stopper, but it certainly de-oderizes.  I love the smell and it does stick around for 4-6 hours.  I tend to be more sweaty than the average female.  I usually apply deodorant 3-4 times a day (before work, noontime, after work, and before bed).  I will continue to use Burt&#x27;s Bees after work and before bed--to allow my body to rid any necessary toxins.</li>
    <li> I have used this for at least a decade, maybe two. Smells great and no irritation. Some initial small sting from alcohol content but feels good to me.</li>
    <li> The actual product is great.  I have no complaints about it whatsoever.  I was mailed three bottles that appeared to be the same item so I took one out of the package and put away the other two.  The second bottle was as expected too...I didn&#x27;t find out until a year later that the third item was actually insect repellant.</li>
    <li> Actually, I&#x27;ve used this product for years. The local stores were suddenly out of it, as was the Burt&#x27;s Bees online store. I found the unfindable here!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a good deodorant if you don&#x27;t mind the initial blast of sage. It isn&#x27;t an antiperspirant, but I didn&#x27;t want one of those! Keeps me smelling fresh and natural (a plus if I&#x27;m working in the garden). Just an all around good product for someone like me who has a good enough nose to detect chemical scents when they are used in place of natural ones (gag).</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this stuff. I&#x27;m asthmatic, hypersensitive to anything with chemicals, and i also am prone to eczema and other skin flare ups. I struggled with deodorant my whole life and hated wearing it. My nickname in the family was funkmaster. If i wasn&#x27;t in school or out in the public, I opted to not wear anything. I sweat easy and I do have funk issues. I came across this deodorant while watching one youtuber who made a video about how she used this stuff to make her afro smell good. Whatever! I researched it, purchased a bottle of it from Whole Foods and was hooked. I still sweat but I&#x27;m not funky when I sweat. i only need to use it once. I live in the hot humid south and this stuff withstands the climate perfectly for me. Even if you hit a rough patch where you began to get a tad bit funky, this stuff is so great, you don&#x27;t have to do the entire \\&quot;change your shirt, wash underarms, and reapply deodorant with a new shirt routine.\\&quot; you can just spray the pits of your shirt, the pits of your arms and it will continue to keep you fresh and eliminate the existing funk with no problem. It doesn&#x27;t break me out or anything. I love it. It&#x27;s great for my skin. I&#x27;m super sensitive and have to be cautious with even what i wash my clothes with and clean my house with. This stuff is great for those of us who are allergic to everything under the sun. I highly recommend this product. Unfortunately, i&#x27;m out and whole foods doesn&#x27;t have any right now so i&#x27;ll be buying online until they get more in. :(.</li>
    <li> Yeah, I know it&#x27;s expensive, but a LOT cheaper buying in on Amazon than at Whole Foods.  Light, clean, effective and great for people with (very) sensitive skin.  It&#x27;s the only one I&#x27;ll use.</li>
    <li> Does not work that well over a couple hours.  Does not dry quickly after applying the product.  Don&#x27;t think I will reorder this product.</li>
    <li> Great deodorant with no additives that cause skin allergies.</li>
    <li> Effective for men and women. I have tried multiple natural deodorants, this is the only one that keeps me dry. Only problem is it stings freshly shaven underarms. I try to shave at night so I can use it.</li>
    <li> If you have allergies, asthma, and are hypo allergic like myself, this stuff is a godsend. You only need to use a little bit of it, as it is quite strong. It has a herbal, musky kind of smell to it that dissipates within an hour or so of applying it. It keeps you smelling natural, and allows your body to still sweat. It doesn&#x27;t have any chemicals like normal deodorants do like Aluminum, Alum, and other types that can cause underarm rashes, skin breakouts, etc. It&#x27;s also been reported, but not confirmed that chemicals like Aluminum found in most Deodorant may cause Alzheimer&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So if you&#x27;re looking for a natural deodorant, that is hypo allergenic and won&#x27;t cause you any respiratory ills or other ill&#x27;s, give this stuff a try. It works for me, and there is literally nothing else out there that works well for me. I&#x27;ve tried a ton of stuff, and always go back to good ol&#x27; Burt&#x27;s Bee&#x27;s products.</li>
    <li> Works well as far as I can tell.  Can think of no reason not to buy it.</li>
    <li> ...but this stuff works great! Sometimes I have to reapply if I&#x27;m working outside on a hot day, but that&#x27;s fine because it smells like sage and lavender! People have even said, &#x27;mmmm what&#x27;s that smell?&#x27; after I put it on... haha. This one actually works, whereas the other natural/organic brands I&#x27;ve tried either smell weird, feel slimy, or don&#x27;t protect from odor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very sensitive to scents/fragrances but since this is only 3 essential oils + alcohol, it&#x27;s totally cool with my nose/sinuses. This is the main selling point for me, that it&#x27;s just pure essential oils, as I don&#x27;t like to put aluminum and other weird stuff in my body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I emailed Burt&#x27;s Bees customer service to find out how they made the alcohol, she told me that it&#x27;s made from fermented plant matter (like palm leaves, corn stalks, etc), but she said she couldn&#x27;t tell me how they denature the alcohol (basically poison it so it can&#x27;t be taxed as liquor) since they purchase the alcohol from another company. This was my only complaint. I think they could really find out, they probably just don&#x27;t want to say because, well, it&#x27;s probably some kind of poison. My other complaint is that you can&#x27;t find it in stores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise I totally recommend!</li>
    <li> My son doesn&#x27;t like regular deodorants. He has used this for a number of years. Works will and doesn&#x27;t bother his skin. A good product.</li>
    <li> Came nicely bubble wrapped and all 3 work. My favorite natural deodorant.</li>
</ol>
