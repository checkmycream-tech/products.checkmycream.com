<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I have worn this color for years!  I try other colors but always come back to this one.  It&#x27;s a really vibrant red with just a hint of a mandarin orange color.  It looks great on toes (I&#x27;m sure it does on fingers too, but I just do toes).  The quality of OPI is amazing, and this is a great price.  This bottle will last a long time!</li>
    <li> Item as described, fast postage.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite toenail polish color of all time.  It looks great even after a couple of weeks.  On occasion you might have to do a touch up but other than that it is great!</li>
    <li> This is a beautiful shade of a deep coral/red nailpolish which looks great on fingers or toes.</li>
    <li> EVERYBODY asks me what this color is because they want it themselves.  It was my staple summer color for last summer, and I think that might just have to happen again this year!</li>
    <li> Bright! Really very bright. If you&#x27;re a fan of colours that are bold and eye-catching, as I am, then this shade is perfect. It&#x27;s a pink-based red, and in strong light you have the bright, screaming pinkness out in full force. Pretty thin formula, which takes a bit of building up to get great coverage, although it does go on well.     Again, if you&#x27;re a fan of bright, crimson-tastic reds, you&#x27;ll probably love this one.</li>
    <li> I tried this nail polish for the first time last year and I loved it.  So far, the best nail polish I&#x27;ve tried.  I got it in \\&quot;Cajun Shrimp,\\&quot; a very bright red.  Bright, bold colors are in this year so this is perfect.  Besides loving the color, it applies really well.  Very easy and smooth application.  Dries quickly.  I will definitely try other colors.</li>
    <li> This polish is absolutely beautiful. It is red with just a touch of orange in it. I always use a base coat when applying polish, especially anything with a red base (helps prevent yellowing of the natural nail.) I applied this with my usual base coat, two coats of this polish and a good layer of top coat. The manicure lasted me almost 10 days. It is a fairly shiny lacquer, so the top coat isn&#x27;t essential, but it does help protect your manicure. If you love red or coral polish, you will not be disappointed in this one.</li>
    <li> I fell in love with this color but it is hard to find in the store.  I love that I ordered it and it came to my door even cheaper than if I had bought it in the store.</li>
    <li> great color... fast delivery</li>
    <li> this is a no brainer for summer or for anytime you want a sexy notice me but not to trendy look. its a timeless classic that looks great on anyone.</li>
    <li> This is a pretty and bright Summer color. I also purchased OPI My Chihuahua Bites and it looks similar to this one but Cajun Shrimp has more of an orange undertone to it. I like My Chihuahua Bites a little more because it has more pink.</li>
    <li> Great transaction!! Beautiful color!!</li>
    <li> This is the only OPI shade that I buy repeatedly. Wonderful color and lasts a long time without chipping.</li>
    <li> Cajun Shrimp is my all-time favorite OPI color. This looks a fabulous bright orangy-red in my opinion, deeper reds tend to look odd on me. I&#x27;ll cry if they discontinue this shade.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping and a great color. I usually pick this color when I go to the salon, but it&#x27;s so much more convenient to have it on hand.</li>
    <li> the picture looked like true red to me on the monitor.&lt;br /&gt;Very disappointd to find out it&#x27;s orange red which I personally hate! 5/12/2012&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Updated 7/30/2013.&lt;br /&gt;This one has become the favorite red polish among all the brands I have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m changing it to 5 stars!</li>
    <li> I love it. What a great color.</li>
    <li> I first tried this nail polish when I purchased nail polish minis for my daughters for Christmas.  I had one extra and kept this one for myself.  I truly love this nail polish and the color is the best. I had to buy this larger size.  I just love it.</li>
    <li> OPI is a great polish and this color really delivers.  I got so many compliments the first time I wore it.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite nail color ever! Thank you!</li>
    <li> FAST shipping! When I placed my order, it was delivered to my home in 3 days. It was packaged well protecting the item from breaking. Exactly as seller described! I wear this color year round and it is by far my most favorite brand and color. I was very pleased to find it on Amazon, considering this color is very hard to find where I live. I was so happy to get it for a great price and free shipping. SO happy! Love my Cajun Shrimp nail polish!</li>
    <li> This is one of my favorite colors of OPI that they make,this is one of my go to colors in the fall and in the midst of summer.</li>
    <li> I get the oxxium gel color from opi for my hands when I go get my manicures.  They didn&#x27;t have Cajun shrimp  for my feet so I decided to purchase it.  I love love love the color!!!! It matches my hands perfectly and last 3 weeks.  I know because sometimes I get busy and it will take me 3 weeks ( or a little more) and my hands and feet are fine.  This item also arrived sooner than expected.  I am very pleased and will purchase from n-pix again:-).</li>
    <li> Great product! Great color! Good to wear with all colors.</li>
    <li> Have liked this OPI color for several years because of its festive not-orange-and-not-red hue and was delighted to find it again.</li>
    <li> This Polish was AWESOME going into my second week with this manicure  and no chips!</li>
    <li> Frequent compliments on this color after manicures made me find my own on Amazon.  Love it.</li>
    <li> A really beautiful color is a mix of orange and red  looks like the picture .This color is fine for anytime of year looks great on and last along time without chipping.</li>
    <li> Great color for the summer. Can&#x27;t go wrong with OPI</li>
    <li> My summer favorite coIor.</li>
    <li> This bottle of polish contained polish that was too thick. Indicates, I would guess, that it&#x27;s an old bottle. It took forever to get to me, which I was surprised, since it&#x27;s just a tiny bottle of polish - perhaps it grew old on the way - ha!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t imagine I&#x27;ll be able to use this bottle for long unless I find a way to thin it out, which I should not have to do to a brand new bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, OPI products are usually wonderful, and this color is perfect for summer! A nice orangey-red.</li>
    <li> Love it. It is such a popular color that the salons are out of stock sometimes. I decided to get my own and carry it with me.</li>
    <li> I have used this color for years and it is one of the original OPI colors that has lasted the test of time and popular use.  I would not trade it for any other color.  Long lasting and stays on longer than any other brand I have tried.  Highly recommend this product</li>
    <li> I am in love with this color. I think it just replaced Jade is the New Black as my favorite OPI color!  It is  vibrant red with a hint of orange. It is not a neon but it is such a powerful color!   It applies really smoothly, and I only needed two coats for perfect coverage. Had i been lazy I could have only used one coat and it would have been fine.  The best part: 0 chipping in 5 days!    I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Perfect color.(Google it) Exactly what you would expect. Opi also seems to last longer than other polishes so that is how I justify the higher price for it.</li>
    <li> OPI as far as I&#x27;m concerned is the best nail polish you can buy and this color is my favorite. Cajun Shrimp</li>
    <li> wear it all summer every year...stands out with a slight tan...love it..</li>
    <li> I love this polish and the OPI Red---It&#x27;s makes my nails stronger ane the original nail envy is top notch!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> It is sometimes hard to find this color which is good in the summer months in Texas on the Gulf Coast.</li>
    <li> Not a true red.  Boo.</li>
    <li> Perfect Color! Shipped on time!  Thank you ☺</li>
    <li> Opi is a great nailpolish. I would high recommend it to everyone the Cajun Shrimp is the perfect coral color for summer! love it!</li>
    <li> this is the same polish that i get at my local dept. store only cheaper. i like ording it online because it saves me a trip to the mall(i hate shopping).</li>
    <li> love the colour, however not what i expected, i was expecting a vibrant strong red and this one is more orange red is a very electric summery colour. Love it!! Anyway  will make a rainbow with the polish colors i have :D:D</li>
    <li> Love OPI  Its a great product  and this was a great price for it.</li>
    <li> I did not like the color -</li>
    <li> Finally was able to find this color. Love it on my nails and is hard to find in stores. great buy</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for this color for awhile as I love the color for the summer. It wears well &amp; doesn&#x27;t fade.</li>
    <li> I love opi nail colors, and this color is absolutely fabulous! Definitely in my top 10 of colors, its a beautiful orange red! HOT HOT HOT!!!!!!</li>
    <li> My absolute FAV color. I read other reviews that said these were fake. The polish was just as described and exceeded my expectations. They are real OPI.</li>
    <li> Great color and lasts so long after getting nails done.</li>
    <li> Hard to find now. Love this color.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a nice summer red polish, not too dark.  This one worked well and,of course is quality that is consistent with OPI.</li>
    <li> This color is my upmost favorite of all nail colors. But, it&#x27;s not that easy to find it in all salons so I had to break down and order it for myself. Some cute stories to tell about this color and me.</li>
    <li> Great polish.  Love the color.</li>
    <li> I love OPI, but not easy to find in my small Southern town. This color came out on Pinterest, and I had to have it! No problem. Amazon to the rescue! It is the most popular color I have ever seen! EVERYONE is wearing it. My female physician saw my pedicure during a checkup and said that&#x27;s Cajun Shrimp!! LOL.  LOVE, LOVE!! Fast shipping is great, too, always:)</li>
    <li> Want to spice up your hands or feet; well this color is for you. The polish was rapped tight and neat along with I was pleased with the color.Dress it up or wear it plain. However you choose will be great!</li>
    <li> Beautiful color! Came on time with careful packaging. I had been wanting this color for awhile and it looks great on me. The color really stands out and goes well with my skin tone.</li>
    <li> Beautiful bright orangy red!</li>
    <li> This color is stunning for summer! Great for toes or fingers, it is bright and so much fun! Not quite red, not quite orange, it inspires beachy, warm and sunny days!</li>
    <li> Arrived right on time with great packaging so it wasn&#x27;t damaged! I bought this for a mani/pedi kit for my stepmom. Cajun Shrimp is her favorite shade and the nail salon we go to doesn&#x27;t carry it anymore.&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t say anything about the quality yet since it&#x27;s a Christmas gift, but as it&#x27;s OPI I expect it to be great!&lt;br /&gt;I will update once she uses it.</li>
    <li> Love this color and love to have my own bottle at home.</li>
    <li> Such a fun color for summer! Doesn&#x27;t clump and dries quickly!</li>
    <li> You can&#x27;t go wrong with OPI and this color is bright and fun for summer. Love them on my toes!</li>
    <li> The perfect color. Arrived on time also. Thanks.</li>
    <li> This is a vibrant must have red! The happy color will compliment all skin tones. The seller was outstanding by shipping immediately so I received 4 days earlier than expected by using standard shipping.</li>
    <li> This is hands down my favorite nail color! It&#x27;s the perfect shade of red with a hint of orange/mandarin. I get complemented regularly when I wear it. I can&#x27;t recommend it enough!</li>
    <li> My favorite color in the OPI collection. I carry the bottle with me to my mani and pedi just in case they don&#x27;t have it on hand. It&#x27;s a great color for a bikini or to brighten your spirits during a cold winter.</li>
    <li> I usually don&#x27;t wear red/orange colors, but I really like this color. I&#x27;m currently wearing it on my nails and toes.</li>
    <li> I am so satisfied with OPI products.  I wear my natural nails, so I&#x27;ve had trouble with nail polish peeling after 24 hours, even when done professionally. I noticed a customer at the hair salon and asked her about her nail polish.  She told me OPI Cajun Shrimp.  As soon as I got home I went to Amazon to order.  I really like the staying power of OPI.  The Cajun Shrimp is fabulous against my complexion.  I am African American, with pecan complexion, plus I get a kiss of color from the sun.  Love the contrast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product!</li>
    <li> This color is a beautiful!  Cajun shrimp is bright red/orange color that brightens my day when I wear it. Takes me back to Nawlins!</li>
    <li> I love the color. Only color I wore all summer.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong with a classic OPI color!</li>
    <li> It is my favorite polish ever!</li>
    <li> Best nail polish in the world! Doesn&#x27;t chip and you really can&#x27;t even get nervous and pick at it and have it peel away like other polishes I&#x27;ve used. Great product, great dealer.</li>
    <li> I randomly used this color polish when I got a pedicure at a nail salon and fell in love with it. I finally got the name of it and found it on Amazon and bought it. I have worn it a couple times since I bought it less then a month ago. So happy.</li>
    <li> I love OPI polish. I saved a few dollars ordering the product from Amazon.</li>
    <li> It was exactly what I wanted.  I love this color especially in the summer!</li>
    <li> I LOVE this color. I wear it in the summer and I wear it in the winter. It&#x27;s the perfect red/orange/coral color and compliments any skin tone. I&#x27;ve had mine for about 3 years or more now and it&#x27;s just about time to purchase a new one. I&#x27;ve never repurchased a nail polish before but I can see myself wearing this color forever!! A must have.</li>
    <li> This is a fun, summer color.  While OPI lists this in their orange color range, it&#x27;s definitely more red with a tinge of coral. Side-by-side with the Coca-Cola red, this color is more coral by a two, maybe three shades. It reminds me of more of a poppy red. It&#x27;s a pretty, creamy shade with complete coverage in two coats, but it&#x27;s not quite as shrimp colored as The OPI website led me to believe. I use the OPI natural basecoat on my nails to prevent any color staining, followed by two coats of color and then a topcoat.</li>
    <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE this color on my chocolate skin!</li>
    <li> I recently had a pedicure at a salon using this color, and I just knew that i had to buy it!</li>
    <li> This nail polish is the one used at my favorite nail boutique.  It lasts longer than any of the garbage sold in the stores.</li>
