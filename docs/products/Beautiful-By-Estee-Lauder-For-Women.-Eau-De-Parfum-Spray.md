      <li>Estee Lauder is great as always.  </li>
      <li>The perfume is great.</li>
      <li>THIS IS A GREAT PERFUME.</li>
      <li>That way you have a great comeback if she doesn&#x27;t think she&#x27;ll like it</li>
      <li>this site that is for sure!!</li>
      <li>My sister in law was very pleased and happy.</li>
      <li>It arrived in good condition and on time.</li>
      <li>Just what I wanted at a good price.</li>
      <li>I have used beautiful perfume many times and it had a scent for hours after applying it.  </li>
      <li>and I can tell just from the selections that it is a lighter color and even though they do not disclose that it is like Beautiful Love or another of the sister products, we can tell.</li>
      <li>Purchased as a gift and was very satisfied.</li>
      <li>I get a happy fun feeling.</li>
      <li>LIKE MOST</li>
      <li>Love finding them and sometimes cheaper</li>
      <li>and I will be ordering more for my family and church members.  </li>
      <li>Much better prices than going to the department store.</li>
      <li>This is my favorite for over 25 years.</li>
      <li>but dang it, its true :)</li>
      <li>: Went to the department store and bought another 2.5 oz bottle of Beautiful and finally did a comparison.</li>
      <li>Needless to say, I got more bonus points for surprising her with Beautiful when she thought I forgot.</li>
      <li>It might have the reputation as an old standby fragrance, but Beautiful is a classic.  </li>
      <li>I am a Beautiful expert and I would have been VERY upset to have waited on my product only to find out</li>
      <li>SMELLS NICE AND SOFT.</li>
      <li>BECAUSE IT&#x27;S THE ONLY KIND SHE WILL WEAR.</li>
      <li>Just right.</li>
      <li>The product is packaged well, sealed, looks authentic, marked as eau de parfum, smells pretty close</li>
      <li>look forward to future order&#x27;s. :)</li>
      <li>(something is faintly off- when the top notes wear off, the middle notes fade into something wonderful with my scent, but that isn&#x27;t there with this product-</li>
      <li>I bought the large bottle and the smell</li>
      <li>Thanks.</li>
      <li>The product sold here is not the real stuff.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been wearing this lovely fragrance for half my life (I&#x27;m 32) and have always received compliments but not since wearing this product...</li>
      <li>Would highly recommend.</li>
      <li>I would highly recommened&lt;br /&gt;it.</li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re not sure about what your significant other might prefer, stay away from the new trendy scents and buy this.  </li>
      <li>it doesn&#x27;t smell as if it is new and as if it were damaged.</li>
      <li>I agree with the 3 star reviewer, but I&#x27;m more annoyed ;)</li>
      <li>Product was old...</li>
      <li>is not harsh, but a soft smell.  </li>
      <li>it&#x27;s really the eau de toilette?), and if it weren&#x27;t for the fact that it just doesn&#x27;t last (!)</li>
      <li>Like a previous reviewer, the scent of this dissipates so quickly, I can douse myself with the stuff (10 -12 sprays) and have the scent barely detectable 4 hours later.</li>
      <li>Bought this as a Christmas present, so naturally i dont wear it.</li>
      <li>The color of FrangraceGo&#x27;s fake Beautiful is a faint yellow, while the real stuff is a deep gold.</li>

<li> the printing on their bottle is in the wrong place.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> The name of this perfume is perfect. It smells Beautiful. Not to intense or heavy of an aroma. Just right. Would highly recommend.</li>
    <li> The product was just as advertised and it arrived on time. I would order from these guys in the future.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite for over 25 years.</li>
    <li> It might have the reputation as an old standby fragrance, but Beautiful is a classic.  If you&#x27;re not sure about what your significant other might prefer, stay away from the new trendy scents and buy this.  That way you have a great comeback if she doesn&#x27;t think she&#x27;ll like it,  \\&quot;Honey, I saw the name and thought of you.\\&quot;  Say that and I bet she tries it.</li>
    <li> Purchased as a gift and was very satisfied.It arrived in good condition and on time. The very same product as in the department stores and a small savings too. One of my wifes favorites.</li>
    <li> THIS IS A GREAT PERFUME. NOT OVER POWERING LIKE MOST AND YOU DON&#x27;T NEED TO SPRAY A LOT. SMELLS NICE AND SOFT. I BOUGHT THIS FOR MY SISTERS BIRTHDAY BECAUSE IT&#x27;S THE ONLY KIND SHE WILL WEAR.</li>
    <li> it doesn&#x27;t smell as if it is new and as if it were damaged. No more biz w/this site that is for sure!!</li>
    <li> I agree with the 3 star reviewer, but I&#x27;m more annoyed ;) I&#x27;m an online shopper, and I could have gone to a department store and bought this for the same price, so imagine my disappointment receiving this substandard product. Like a previous reviewer, the scent of this dissipates so quickly, I can douse myself with the stuff (10 -12 sprays) and have the scent barely detectable 4 hours later. I&#x27;ve been wearing this lovely fragrance for half my life (I&#x27;m 32) and have always received compliments but not since wearing this product... no one can detect a fragrance!! The product is packaged well, sealed, looks authentic, marked as eau de parfum, smells pretty close (something is faintly off- when the top notes wear off, the middle notes fade into something wonderful with my scent, but that isn&#x27;t there with this product- maybe bc it&#x27;s really the eau de toilette?), and if it weren&#x27;t for the fact that it just doesn&#x27;t last (!) I might have questioned/ doubted my nose. This is a DON&#x27;T BUY!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: Went to the department store and bought another 2.5 oz bottle of Beautiful and finally did a comparison. Four sprays and the scent lasts forever. The product sold here is not the real stuff. The color of FrangraceGo&#x27;s fake Beautiful is a faint yellow, while the real stuff is a deep gold. The bottle is actually slightly different, too- the printing on their bottle is in the wrong place. This company is charging full price + shipping for a fake product. Absolutely ridiculous!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> She loves this stuff and it was just what I ordered. Much better prices than going to the department store.</li>
    <li> I used to date a girl in college that wore this stuff. It became part of what made her... her. To this day when I smell Beautiful (and yes, I can pick it out in a crowd!) I get a happy fun feeling. I know thats not a very manly thing to say but dang it, its true :)</li>
    <li> Another bottle of &amp;#34;Beautiful&amp;#34;  Been a staple of mine for over 30 years.</li>
    <li> I have used beautiful perfume many times and it had a scent for hours after applying it.  I bought the large bottle and the smell can only be detected immediately after spraying.  i will take it to a department store and do a comparison.  i am disappointed, as I really looked forward to getting it.</li>
    <li> Product was old... imposter</li>
    <li> Just what I wanted at a good price.</li>
    <li> Estee Lauder is great as always.  Beautiful is beautiful it was price great and I will be ordering more for my family and church members.  Please keep up the good work and the wonderful pricing.</li>
    <li> Wife always uses it and with the prices at Amazon on the larger size I just got two no dog house for me LOL.</li>
    <li> I am so thankful for all of your reviews. I am a Beautiful expert and I would have been VERY upset to have waited on my product only to find out it wasn&#x27;t what I thought I was getting. All of my Beautiful sisters, be ware!!! We know what the bottle looks like on the picture and I can tell just from the selections that it is a lighter color and even though they do not disclose that it is like Beautiful Love or another of the sister products, we can tell. We know our brand!! Trust your gut. You probably had an inkling something was not right. Shame on you seller for not disclosing the mixup and addressing each of the customer concerns. You just lost a customer because you seem to be hiding and don&#x27;t care about valued customers!!!</li>
    <li> My wife loves this stuff. She was sad that she didn&#x27;t get it on Christmas, but I had ordered it and it arrive a couple days after Christmas. Needless to say, I got more bonus points for surprising her with Beautiful when she thought I forgot.</li>
    <li> I rated it a 5 because I have used &amp;#34;Beautiful&amp;#34; for a very long time.  I like&lt;br /&gt;because &amp;#34;Beautiful&amp;#34; is not harsh, but a soft smell.  I would highly recommened&lt;br /&gt;it.</li>
    <li> awesome!!! look forward to future order&#x27;s. :)</li>
    <li> Bought this as a Christmas present, so naturally i dont wear it. My sister in law was very pleased and happy.</li>
    <li> The perfume is great. The bottle though, was either stored in heat or other type environment where the plastic tube inside breaks off and half a bottle is left. Cannot use the remaining perfume. Too much waste. Local store would replace it if I brought it back. Over the last couple of years the online purchases fail and the store purchases have no problem, so far.</li>
    <li> Hate going to the mall to purchase these items.  Love finding them and sometimes cheaper then the mall stores. Thanks.</li>
