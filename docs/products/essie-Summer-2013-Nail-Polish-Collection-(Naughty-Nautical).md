      <li>You really can not see from the photo, but there is just the slightest bit of shimmer in the Summer collection.  </li>
      <li>You can really see the sparkle if you look at the bottle.</li>
      <li>Upon receiving the item I realized it&#x27;s a MUCH greener product and not at all turquoise.  </li>

<li> it also has small glitter specks if you look really close.</li>
<li> It is much darker, used it once and was not pleased.</li>
<li> Very creamy, with a small hint of sparkle.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m a big essie fan and this is one of the few shades they have where there is shimmer in the bottle that actually translates to the nails.</li>
<li> The color is a little deeper than I thought it would be based on magazine advertisements, but I am a big fan of naughty nautical.  </li>
<li> I will say that it is greener than I expected - based upon the picture as well as photos I&#x27;ve seen in magazines, I was expecting a bluer, slightly lighter color.</li>
<li> that shows the true ugly color</li>
<li> It&#x27;s a very dark color.</li>
<li> I was a little disappointed, but now I know next time to try to find it in a store</li>
<li> I have never experienced nothing like that....</li>
<li> Next time I&#x27;ll just put base coat..</li>
<li> For the price of this polish, it was SO THIN!!!</li>

    <li> Just received my polish today and the color is so pretty, not sure how it will look on but can&#x27;t wait to use it.</li>
    <li> I wanted more of a fun aqua but it is acually a poopy blue! I think you need i picture on here that shows the true ugly color</li>
    <li> I thought this color was going to be a lot brighter than what I received. It&#x27;s a very dark color. It&#x27;s just okay.</li>

    <li> Love the color...and all Essie products...high quality and great colors. Good price...better than in the stores.  I always check Amazon for my Essie.</li>
    <li> Perhaps a bit darker than I imagined with the picture but nonetheless a beautiful aquamarine teal shade that I can&#x27;t wait to wear to the beach this summer. The sparkles are subtle but lovely. I feel like Sailor Neptune would approve of this shade.</li>

    <li> Absolutely gorgeous color for the summer, I wore it all throughout the summer on my hands and toes. Very creamy, with a small hint of sparkle. You can really see the sparkle if you look at the bottle. Might pull this color back out again around Easter. :)</li>
    <li> I thought I would enjoy this color more but it really isn&#x27;t for me.  It is a great product and wears well.  I love the name as well.</li>
