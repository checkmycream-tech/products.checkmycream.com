<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Natural, rosewater, sprayed in the face very moisturizing,I love it.</li>
    <li> its okay. it does not smell like real rosses.</li>
    <li> I am so glad to have found Heritage Store. The Rosewater that I purchased is just heavenly. I keep it in the frig because the warm and humid weather of Florida makes you feel sweaty and damp. So I spray some of the Rosewater every few hours and it makes you feel so refreshed. Also, many people have stopped me to ask what I am wearing, they say &amp;#34;you smell just like fresh picked roses&amp;#34; I&#x27;ll take that compliment anytime. Thanks for this lovely product.</li>
    <li> One of my mother&#x27;s caregivers used this spray for odors.  It is very nice.  The scent of the spray is very light, but most importantly it care of the &amp;#34;bad&amp;#34; odors.  I like it much better than the aerosol sprays.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful product!&lt;br /&gt;I use it daily...</li>
    <li> Love this!I have smaller bottls and I divide it up and add my own glycerine.  Which makes it a bit more than the rosewater and glycerine blend they make up. The rose smell is very delicate and fresh compared to manyother rosewater sprays.</li>
    <li> It has a very nice scent. Not fake or chemical scented.</li>
    <li> This is a great rose water product. Smells wonderful, clean and refreshing. Dries with the smell of roses on you, not oily or anything. The 3 pack is a great deal. The \\&quot;vormag activated water\\&quot; bit is rather dubious, but I didn&#x27;t buy it for pseudo-scientific claims, just to smell nice, which it does.    My only concern is that it doesn&#x27;t actually say it&#x27;s certified organic. While I know some companies have consciously chosen not to certify for various potentially legitimate reasons, it&#x27;s still a badge that inspires some amount of trust. Without it all you have is the manufacturer&#x27;s word to go on, so you&#x27;d better know and trust the manufacturer. Unfortunately, unless they&#x27;re your neighborhood farm (where buying non-organic from a local farmer&#x27;s market can make more sense), there&#x27;s generally no way to know. Still, there are few if any certified organic rose water products, so the lack of certification is not a deal breaker. The product is clearly high quality and worth the price.</li>
    <li> This Rosewater is amazing! I use it everyday.  There are a lot of things you can do with it.  I use it as perfume, put it in my shampoo, use it on my face, and much more!!!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this rosewater! I use it every day and I&#x27;m so happy I ordered it. This order doesn&#x27;t come with a spritz attachment for the bottle, so I poured some into a small spray bottle. I use it a few times a day to freshen up and moisturize my face. This is really nice to have now that it is winter and the air is drier because my skin gets super dry, and this really helps. I carry it in my purse! I also use it together with jojoba oil or coconut oil for moisturizing. I highly recommend this product. Also, it smells amazing!!</li>
    <li> I thought this was a fantastic product!  The ones I was shipped were plastic wrapped together so the bottles were not jostled and did not lose any of the rose water in shipping.  The scent was extraordinary!      I was using this in a recipe and had to mix a bit with water and then spritz so I poured the majority into a separate container until I finished with the baking.  The scent was very potent and did not lose any of potency as the night wore on.  My home was still very pleasantly rose scented the next day even after I had put the product away.</li>
    <li> I love the rosewater it is so soothing to my sensitive skin. I even use it on my hair,  Smells wonderful. Would recommend to a friend.</li>
    <li> LOVE this product, use it all the time, spray it on my face and pillow before bed to calm...also use it as a hair rinse in the shower and it smells wonderful!</li>
    <li> I have only been using the rosewater for a few days, because I had to find an atomizer to use.  I thought I had read that it came with it, but evidently not.  I have already done a full spray in the linen closet and every time I change sheets I plan to spray the sheets. The rose scent is really amazing; I just hope it has staying power.  I have a lot of roses, but just don&#x27;t have time to make anything but potpourri. When I was younger I used to buy a rose-scented powder sachet, but I can&#x27;t find that anymore, darn it.  Hopefully, this will be a good substitute.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this as a toner/refresher for years. I used to get it at Whole Foods but the price is constantly increasing. These didnt come with the mister but i can use one of the old ones I have.</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this! I spray it on my face and over my body after I get out of the shower, because it gives me the hydration and moisture for my dry.  I don&#x27;t know anything about how organic or natural the ingredients are and I would like more information on that, but for the most part I love this spray!</li>
    <li> Great product! smells great!! very gentle! great for anything really! body, face, hair! How is it different from water (as some people say)? its smells like roses!! just makes me feel great in general)) love it!</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin, and have been using this as a facial toner for a couple of years now. It&#x27;s very \\&quot;clean,\\&quot; works really well and smells wonderful. Plus Amazon offers it at a great price, especially if you have an Amazon Prime membership. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I usually buy at Whole Foods and very expensive... running out and saw in the subscribe and save section and is a great buy for three!  I have very sensitive skin and literally have my skin peeling from other product that literally dry out my skin until it cracks!!... can&#x27;t have any shea butter in any product and it is out there in everything!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this a lot and have been using a long time!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I spray this after shower on dry areas and use every day in the summer after sweating because skin is so irritated.  (Yes, I use on my face as a toner, but I close my eyes and don&#x27;t spray so much that it is dripping.) This stuff soothes and has a very light, mild rose fragrance but is okay for sensitive skin... like with any new skin product try a little at first!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, have used for years and will continue to use and now that it is a subscribe product will save a bundle...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(Personally, most of my reviews are positive because I don&#x27;t buy products I don&#x27;t like and I do a lot of research and checking if I try a new product....now I am using Amazon a lot for all kinds of purchases,especially things I have been using and now can save by buying at Amazon!!!  Thanks, Amazon!!!)</li>
    <li> Yes perfect I use it when I make my body cream</li>
    <li> cook with, refreshen yourself and spray on your hair. Mix butters like cocoa, shea and mango with it, for whipping action.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this brand rosewater for over a decade and it works very well. I&#x27;ve used Mario Badescu&#x27;s rosewater as well - costs more but doesn&#x27;t have the rich rose scent like Heritage. And I really believe that this rosewater makes me glow!</li>
    <li> My eyes are very sensitive to virtually every commercial facial moisturizer I&#x27;ve tried.  Years ago, rosewater and glycerine was available from pharmacists; now it seems they&#x27;ve changed to fake rosewater and not necessarily vegetable glycerine.  So I decided to make my own with this Rosewater and Now vegetable glycerine.  I don&#x27;t have any small glass vials to mix it in, so I just put a dab of glycerine in my hand and spray a little rosewater onto it and mix it in my hands and apply.  It&#x27;s very good stuff.  It moisturizes well, even in dry New Mexico.  It seems to keep well.  It&#x27;s very economical.  The Rosewater can also be used as a fragrance or room  or hair freshener and even for cooking.  A great and economical product that causes no problems with my many allergies and my sensitive eyes.</li>
    <li> I would order again it is a very refeshing rose after, place in fridge for hot summer days it is wonderful.</li>
    <li> wonderful product... I have been using it for years and the price on amazon is the lowest I can find ( I have free shipping).&lt;br /&gt;I use it as a face cleaner/toner, it takes away all my make-up very gently, and leave my skin clean and soft with no irritation.&lt;br /&gt;It smells of roses but not in a strong way. A very good product.</li>
    <li> My sister uses this on my 9 month old niece&#x27;s hair. We&#x27;ve been buying this at the wholefoods market for quite some time but it was pretty expensive for a bottle that is much smaller. She&#x27;s very happy with the larger bottles and the cost.</li>
    <li> This is one of my \\&quot;must haves\\&quot; when it comes to my daily routine...shower, spray rose water on my face and body, and then moisturize with oil. The scent is light!</li>
    <li> Its such a refreshing part of a daily habit. I have 2 bottles, one is the glycerin mist; both are fabulous. I use it when I pass one of the misters. I will always keep it on hand!</li>
    <li> This product has a nice fragrance but it is not as lasting and as strong as I had desired.  I had recently read that the aroma of roses at night tends to induce  more pleasant dreams.  I had a bottle of Tea Rose perfume and tried it and it seemed to have the desired effect, but I didn&#x27;t want to spray this on my pillow every night.  I thought the Rosewater would help but the fragrance was not strong enough.</li>
    <li> Alright, to date I have tried many many brands and grades of rose water(at practical and impractical lashings out at my wallet). I shall not mention their names, because although they are no longer to be repurchased by myself, they still nonetheless served me well enough at some point or another. But that was exactly the problem, they merely served me WELL ENOUGH. I&#x27;ve always loved roses, and I&#x27;ve researched all of the means by which roses serve towards well being. The countless rose waters that I&#x27;d used however, always seemed to be missing something, or not quite reaching that high note I always listen for in a beauty product. My eyes stung, bad tastes, tightening drying effects, artificial scents. You name it, each and every rose water I&#x27;d tried had some faulty. I even opted to go organic; still, at bulk, the organic rose water that I almost settled upon had an unpleasant scent(almost like the smell of rotten rose water at the bottom of an empty vase abandoned sans cleansing), not to mention (and unacceptably so, being certified organic, the supposed \\&quot;purest of pure\\&quot;) broke me out! The whole point of a rose water, I figure, is to relieve, relax, and tone. Not cause an uproar of stinging, unpleasantness, and upheaval of my cystic acne.     I thought I&#x27;d almost given up, and accepted that nothing is complete, nothing&#x27;s perfect. I was just about to repurchase the expensive, luxuriously bottled, however debatable benefits rose water, when I browsed through amazon, and spot this brand. I&#x27;d remembered dismissing this product, as I&#x27;m awfully vain and to see that this product was hideously bottled in a putrid pink, just turned me off. However, looking at the gorgeous antique and nostalgia printed useless and expensive rose water that I was currently using, I realized, I really ought not to judge a book for its cover. I had just recently purchased Heritage&#x27;s Castor oil( to great quality and success) and figured, why not? You&#x27;ve wasted tons of money already, this is a greatvalue, and who knows? Maybe this could be it.    AND it is! The MINUTE, the SECOND that I sprayed this, my PORES just knew! It&#x27;s as though they SANG out to me in delight, in applause, in saying FINALLY, darling, THIS IS THE ONE!! It fell like elixir rain drops onto my skin, and absorbed quickly enough, leaving behind a dewy, moisturized, glowing complexion. and the SCENT, goodness, DIVINE! Really, ROSES. I even sprayed so much(unnecessarily and over indulgently so!) that I got a bit in my mouth. Pure! Not a single bit of unpleasantness, I may just open the top and pour it all down my throat!(just kidding, though I may utilize it in my rose petal pound cake!) Although I was unsure of the organic status of this product, I am positive now it is pure. Whether certified or not, this is certainly higher grade than that certified brand I&#x27;d tried. And the SCENT. It is ROSES. Like the scent of a rose bush in the rain. Like the odour of petals in bath water. It is PERFECTION. My search has ended. It&#x27;s what I&#x27;ve yearned for. Never judge a the exterior of a bottle for the value of its contents; you never know until you try. To the previous user stating it&#x27;s for angels and butterflies only: this is a fact. But I believe that all women are angels and butterflies, all of us that put forth the effort towards our well being.</li>
    <li> love it, always have. baby loves it. carry everywhere i go for quick refereshment to face.</li>
    <li> Always love this product. Have been buying it for like 15 years. &amp;#60;3</li>
    <li> This is a great product.  It can be used as an awesome spritzer for the body/face.  It has a light scent and cools the skin.  I purchased it for a craft purposes and it works awesome.  It&#x27;s exactly what I wanted.</li>
    <li> the scent remains to the bottom of the bottle. better than more expensive ones</li>
    <li> After cleansing my face I spray this on it, followed up with some hyaluronic acid. Works great!</li>
    <li> This water is exactly as described and an amazing value. I use it with witch hazel for a facial toner.</li>
    <li> Very nice to use right after cleansing.  Smells so lovely and is very soothing to the skin and the mind.  I like to splash it on my upper back after bathing.  So for me it is nice for the face and my back.  I have another brand and while I really like the other brand, I like this one the best.  To me it is a wonderful toner and skin refresher.</li>
    <li> I love this for toning my skin-my grandmother swore by rosewater. I use them after a bath and in the clothes dryer as well.  However I&#x27;ve also used this for years for grandkid sleepovers. I altered the label to read \\&quot;Happy Dream Magic Spray\\&quot;. All you need is a little puff dramatically sprayed into a dark corner or under the bed. \\&quot;Oh! Look! It&#x27;s working already!!! No more bad dreams or scary things! I only use Cayce waters as they are not a perfume but a pure floral infusion.  Lasts a long time and the placebo effect plus the calming florals work like a charm.</li>
    <li> The rosewater itself is great, however... when it arrived, the water had leaked all over! I only got about half a bottle upon arrival. I contacted the seller to get a replacement and i&#x27;ll keep you updated once I hear back.</li>
    <li> LOVE IT&lt;br /&gt;this product is what I been looking for, the scent is so nice that when I use it makes feel like being&lt;br /&gt;in a rose garden. The price is right and service was very good. Will buy again.</li>
    <li> Excellent product and fast shipping!</li>
    <li> This is so fresh and simple, two ingredients. I use it to spray in my hair and as a light perfume that won&#x27;t make all the people around me gag.</li>
    <li> This is wonderful, smells JUST like a fresh bouquet of roses! The smell doesn&#x27;t last long, however... if it&#x27;s scent you&#x27;re going for, I suggest adding a drop of Egyptian Geranium essential oil. This whole &amp;#34;vor-mag&amp;#34; water claim is absolute nonsense, but I do like to mix this with a touch of glycerin in a spray bottle and spray on my face before bed. I wouldn&#x27;t call it a miracle water like some other reviewers, but it is nice around the eyes and seems to tone your facial color a bit. I mostly bought this to use as my water base for lotion/shampoo/etc., and the one lotion I&#x27;ve made so far is great! Highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Smells great -- like roses! I purchased this mainly to try in some food dishes  but since no where on the label does it indicate&amp;#34;food grade&amp;#34; I am hesitant to use it for that.  Will be great in the bath, though...</li>
    <li> Not rose water, but rose oil and water.</li>
    <li> I spray this on my bikini area after waxing or shaving; it helps to prevent ingrown hairs.  I also use it as a deodorant and as a  face and body mist.</li>
    <li> Clean, refreshing and beats boiling my own rose petals.</li>
    <li> love this product! I have used rosewater on my face for years. This is a keeper!</li>
    <li> I use this product before lotion or cream, it smells good and not hurt even into my eyes. I have been using this for many years.</li>
    <li> This product is good for natural hairstyles.  Jus spritz some on when you feel your hair is dry.  Product arrived as promised, I have purchased this product before, but decided to purchase from Amazon because of the price.  Trust me, you won&#x27;t be disappointed</li>
    <li> good product, good deal but it does NOT come with a Atomizer mist sprayer as listed in last line of item description. Amazon would have sent me a shipping label to return it for a refund but I told them it was fine and i&#x27;d just keep it and to please update the listing.  would buy again</li>
    <li> I love how this product is pure and safe. I spray it on my skin, clothing and even my hair without fear of any negative effects or harmful chemicals. The scent is light and beautifully floral. I am so pleased to have found a product to replace my chemical based perfumes, but I will still be searching for a longer lasting scent. Sadly, the lovely scent fades very quickly, but spraying on more is refreshing enough to keep me using it. I love the 3 pack, so I can throw one in my bag and give the other as a gift.</li>
    <li> The smell is truly ambrosial.  I took one to work (in a prison) and the guys don&#x27;t complain.  Subtle enough for frequent use.</li>
    <li> I use this product as a toner and I love that I got a 3 pack for the price I got.  I wanted to finish at least one bottle before reviewing now that the first bottle is over I can say I can&#x27;t find any complaints so if you&#x27;re in the market for rosewater this is perfect!</li>
    <li> BEWARE: this is not authentic rosewater.  It is \\&quot;Vor-Mag water\\&quot; with \\&quot;Hydroessential Rose Oil added to it.  Supposedly the Vor-Mag water has been \\&quot;vortexed and magnetized to raise the energy to a higher vibration...\\&quot;  I&#x27;m not exactly sure what it means to vortex something and I don&#x27;t understand what it means to magnetize water, but this wouldnt really bother if the product was any good. However, it is crap. I don&#x27;t understand what \\&quot;hydroessential rose oil\\&quot; is either, but my best guess is that it is rose essential oil that has been chemically altered so that it will disperse into water (most essential oils do not do this naturally).  It does smell like roses, but its smell is like that of a very low quality rose essential oil. I think you are better off going to a Middle Eastern grocery store and buying their rose water cause it is much less expensive and smells far better.</li>
    <li> I like rosewater.  This is a nice product, smells nice, and it wasn&#x27;t real expensive.  I would purchase it again.</li>
    <li> I bought this at a health food store a few years ago. Rose is my absolute favorite scent and I am a big believer in Edgar Cayce so that just sealed the deal. I love this stuff. It&#x27;s got a lovely, light smell and when you spritz it on your face it&#x27;s almost like your face sighs. Very refreshing.</li>
    <li> [...]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Heritage Store Rosewater &amp; Glycerin spray is like magic! For the price you cannot do better. Its a great moisturizer, refresher, skin astringent, emollient, body spray or perfume. Glycerin and rosewater have been valuable skin ingredients to women for centuries. This combination of rosewater AND glycerin is also used in various cosmetic lotions and creams. It is supposed to conduce  glowing and soft skin. Rosewater has anti-inflammatory, astringent, and antiseptic properties making it great for facial cleansing and toning. Glycerin on its own is a wonderful oil-free moisturizer and rosewater has skin nourishing properties. What&#x27;s great about this spray versus other rosewater sprays is that it combines both into one (not to mention how great the price is).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I picked up this brand in a small whole foods store on a small street in Kauai in Hawaii over this past holiday season while on vacation and I was instantly impressed. It is now one of my must have products. Then I realized I can easily order it on Amazon for just about $7-$8 a bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried many grades and many price levels of rose spray and rose oils (I do love REN rose oil but it is pricey and I usually only use it in the winter, and not everyday). This spray is the best there is for the price in my opinion. While I am a fan of Mario Badescu&#x27;s rosewater facial spray, since I have tried this one, I don&#x27;t think I will go back to Mario&#x27;s. Mario&#x27;s spray is a little milder and not as moisturizing. It is also doesn&#x27;t contain glycerin. So if you have very oily skin you may prefer Mario&#x27;s version.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I suggest spraying this on your  face and body when you get out of the shower and then applying your moisturizer. The rosewater and glycerin will add extra hydration and you will love the scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[...]</li>
    <li> Great scent good price</li>
    <li> Smells beautiful,  but fragrance lasts only a few minutes. Comes in a &amp;#34;squeeze bottle&amp;#34;, doesn&#x27;t come in a spray bottle like shown in the picture.</li>
    <li> What is this really?!! A toner? but it does not stay on the packaging to spray on your face. It&#x27;s more of a body mist than anything and the smell really doesn&#x27;t stay. I don&#x27;t even know what to do with these 3 bottles.</li>
    <li> I like to use this in my Witch Hazel (love Witch Hazel for pores and face cleaning with cotton pad AFTER I&#x27;ve washed my face).  I saw a Witch Hazel product that already had this rosewater in it, but wanted to keep the cost down so I just add my own.  I mix about 5:1 ratio - 5 parts Witch Hazel; 1 part Rosewater.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know there are many other uses for Rosewater - spraying on towel-dried hair, a light spritz on face after makeup application.  So I don&#x27;t know a lot about it, just like the fact that it adds something good &amp; healthy to Witch Hazel</li>
    <li> Purchased the 3 pack of Heritage Rosewater, 8 oz bottles.  Makes my skin velvety soft.  I used it on my face as a toner as well as on my skin.  It was exactly what I wanted.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Product came on time great product!</li>
    <li> Great value, so much cheaper than buying it in the chain heath food store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great for hydrating natural African American hair.  Mix with glycerin &amp; alcohol free witch hazel for a great hair and skin refreshing spritz.</li>
    <li> Quality of this rose water was significantly better before.&lt;br /&gt;Now the product stings the eyes when applied; also need to use more to get desired affect;&lt;br /&gt;However, still better remedy for eye related conditions, from red eye to conjunctivitis....&lt;br /&gt;This is a reflection on the product and not on the seller.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great, smells great, and the bottle size is convenient.  The plastic they used is pink, so at first I thought the rosewater would be dyed (yuck).  I will say, that the ingredients list includes \\&quot;vor-mag\\&quot; water, which is completely ridiculous... the company obviously missed physics/chem 101 in high school!</li>
    <li> I have been an avid fan of this product for about 2o years! My best friend introduced me to it when she was diagnosed with Alopecia. We found that paired with glycerine, it is an amazing lightly fragranced skin astringent/emollient. Used everyday right after bathing, it keeps the skin moisturized and soft. It can be used alone or along with your favorite lotion or cream. It blends well with any fragrance, and doesn&#x27;t clash. If you pair it with a rose, or floral scented perfume or oil...watch out! AWESOME results!!! It is versatile and can be used from head-to-toe, literally. I have used it in my hair, on my face,  all over my body, (it is even safe for intimate freshening)!&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this to all of my friends, especially ones with sensitive skin (like me), or extremely dry skin.</li>
    <li> I love these.  Great price, I wish they came with sprayers.  I went to a store and bought some travel sprayers so I have bottles all over my house.</li>
    <li> well, I haven&#x27;t tried other brands but this smells great and feels great. I bought it to add to a hair spritz recipe. In the meantime I notice my face and neck are ..nicer, softer. This is a great price - I paid over 8 dollars for 1 at a local health store. So the recipe is veggie glycerin, rosewater and aloe vera juice (not gel).  The rosewater makes the spritz pleasant to use - far better than using water as I had been. My hair - and face - really like this spritz. I see no down sides.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! This was just a restock purchase.</li>
    <li> Great price, arrived on time, and has a light tea rose fragrance.  I put some in a small spritz bottle and spray my face before applying moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve purchased many times and it seems consistently to be high quality. Scent is not overly strong and is very fresh.</li>
    <li> Great price &amp; an excellent toner or base as a vitamin C scrub.</li>
    <li> I have used this product a long time and am very satisfied.  This is too many words for me to need to use to satisfy your inquiry.</li>
    <li> I loved this product.  It siuited my needs for reproducing 18th century recipes.  It was shipped in a timely manner. I HAD ENOUGH TO COOK WITH AND GIVE EACH GUEST A SAMPLE IN A SMALL BOTTLE TO USE AS A SKIN REFRESHER.  i WAS SO DELIGHTED TO BE ABLE TO FINSD ROSE WATER. THANKS. NANCY GRAHAM</li>
    <li> Great as a toner .. Love the rose smell . !!! Great spraying it on he face on hot summer days</li>
    <li> Addicted to this stuff</li>
    <li> This rosewater smells just like roses. I&#x27;ve bought other brands and they smell like rotten roses.  I love to spray this water on my face, it&#x27;s very refreshing and smells so good.</li>
    <li> Smells beautiful. Great to use when I run out of roses in my backyard. I use this as a water substitute in all my beauty products. I sometimes use it for my hair.</li>
    <li> Great Product. Love this product smell so good!!! Use it on my face Just love this sent Have a Wonderful day Blessings..........********</li>
    <li> This product came highly recommended, I purchased it and I love it.  It was what I expected and then some!</li>
    <li> can be used for many purpose, toner, body splash or linen spray….smells great and i love it, get it you will love it too!</li>
    <li> But this one is the best.  The smell is perfection.  I have not found anything (even high end expensive products) that can match the scent of this product. I love how it smells, I use on my face after I wash and the scent wakes me up. I sprinkle some in my washed hair too. I keep buying this brand over and over again.</li>
    <li> I like this smell better then the Bulgarian rose I have tried. It does not last long but is very nice. TWIMC: Thank you.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent skincare product.  I have been using it for years! Smells like real roses. Especially great for the face...</li>
    <li> This is so refreshing and light.  The scent is very nice.  I poured this into a small atomizer and use it as a facial mist a few times each day.  My only complaint is the packaging allowed product to leak during shipping.  I didn&#x27;t lose much.  The price was great and it arrived very quickly.</li>
    <li> It smells wonderful, like real roses! Helps skin with irritations. Tastes good in food. I mix with a little glycerin in a spray bottle for skin and clothes.</li>
    <li> You can&#x27;t beat the price on these!  The spray bottle is really nice too.  I like that it is food quality so you can use one for cooking and keep the others for a facial toner.  I gave 4 stars because the packaging allowed my bottles to get bumped around and they lost a little rose water during shipment.</li>
    <li> I have eczema, and lately nothing -- and I mean nothing -- would soothe my dry itchy skin.  I remembered buying some Heritage Products Rosewater about two years ago (during another flare-up), and desparately searched through the house to see if I still had some left.  I found my bottle, sprayed all over my body, and hoped for the best.  Ahhhhh!  Relief came immediately.  I have to spray ever few hours.  But when nothing else works, it&#x27;s well worth the effort.  I&#x27;ve got less than an inch of this precious liquid left in the bottle, so I&#x27;m ordering some more.  Hopefully, it&#x27;ll get to me before I run out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To somebody like me, who (during a flare) will itch so badly I wake up with bloody sheets, this rosewater is worth its weight in gold.  In the future, I&#x27;ll always keep enough on hand that I never run out again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, there&#x27;s an added benefit too.  It smells divine!</li>
    <li> Great staple to have, your hair will love it. I keep it in a cool place and sometimes add my oils.</li>
    <li> love it. makes my skin feel wonderful and it just smells heavenly. I will be a regular for this item.</li>
    <li> I have been using this rose water for over a year. Tried other brands, but this one feels so very good. I spray it all over my face, neck and sometimes, well all over. It feels that good. Use it at  night. Very light scent which I appreciate, just enough to put you in a wonderful mood. I find using it right before going to bed the best experience. I have not come across a better feeling brand.</li>
    <li> I love to use this on my face every morning!</li>
    <li> This rose water spritz is seriously awesome!!! Read more about in my blog post: [...]    Thanks so much!! xo, Kelly {from Joie De Life}</li>
    <li> This is one of my favorite brands of rose water at a great price.  Will order again.</li>
    <li> Very refreshing , this Rosewater.  Can&#x27;t say that I have had much use for it.  But did give a bottle of it away!  Nice fragrance.</li>
    <li> smell like alcohol and dries my face.</li>
    <li> I was very pleasantly surprised to find such a great deal... Rosewater is so useful for soothing and calming my two daughter&#x27;s fair skin... and as a bonus it smells wonderful! Definitely a good purchase</li>
    <li> light and soft, nice smell, not sticky, no alcohol&lt;br /&gt;perfect for me and my kids, i carry one in my car year round!</li>
    <li> I spray this rosewater on my face in the morning after cleansing, in the studio before I teach a yoga class and whenever I need to clear the air or lift my spirit. Simply lovely. So fresh, so clean. Put a bottle in the frig and on hot days take out and spray to revitalize or after shower.</li>
    <li> It is ok, but will not buy again, because it is not &#x27;true&#x27; rose water, just rose oil added to water</li>
    <li> I normally love this product, but the last batch I ordered was horrible.  The others I&#x27;ve ordered were clean enough to add to food and water and spray on myself as aromatherapy.  My last batch smells and tastes of pesticides, so I can only use it as room freshener spray.  I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s a cheap knock-off or a poor batch, but I&#x27;m questioning whether to buy this ever again.</li>
    <li> I love this product and am so happy its available on Amazon - I use rosewater a lot in the summer to spray on my face, body, hair on a hot day and I use it religiously mixed with water to spray on my bedding and clothes to get the wrinkles out and freshen up a shirt or dress.</li>
    <li> I really like the rosewater I use it with other natural products for my hair. It smells wonderful and soothing to the scalp</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this stuff! Makes a great facial toner, and love the scent of roses!</li>
    <li> On time and high quality</li>
    <li> Love this rosewater- food grade and high quality.</li>
    <li> I spray this on my hair and body after I get out of the shower. Love it!</li>
    <li> Love this rosewater, buy it often.</li>
    <li> I would not want to be without this product.  I spray it on my hair in between shampoos and it keeps it looking and smelling good! I think the Vor-Mag water, which they describe as \\&quot;water that has been vortexed and magnetized to raise the energy to a higher vibration that we believe to be more beneficial\\&quot;, has something to do with it, as well as the rose flower oil itself, of course. :)</li>
    <li> Nice product and good price will buy again.</li>
    <li> I purchased this in the 3-pk and I use them for just about everything.  I love it as a face hydrater, quick hair spritzer and a fabric freshener.  The smell ls so fresh without being overwhelming. Will order this again.!!</li>
    <li> This product never fails. I use it as a toner and as a mid-day spritz for freshening up. This is my second order and I don&#x27;t see an end in sight. Thank you!</li>
    <li> nice refreshing good purchase</li>
    <li> Got these pretty quickly. They do not come with the spray pump, FYI. Will purchase again in the future.&lt;br /&gt;I use rosewater to hydrate my face and body any time of the day. I also use it during workouts and keep a small bottle in my studio, all washrooms, my makeup room and my purse. Perfect for summer!</li>
    <li> Love the product.  Thanks</li>
    <li> Now I find I can&#x27;t live without it.  Use it as a toner.  It&#x27;s like being in a field of Roses.  Also, on hot days, I will spritz and get refreshed.  I absolutely love this produce, and will reorder and highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This rose water is so far, the best I&#x27;ve found on Amazon. I&#x27;ve purchased a variety of other rose waters of other brands, and none of them smell or feel as good as this cheap-looking stuff. Bright pink bottle, kinda-ugly label, HILARIOUS &amp;#34;Vor-Mag Water&amp;#34; claim, but FANTASTIC rose water. I am dubious about the claims on the website that this might be culinary quality, and don&#x27;t much feel like finding out first hand, but this stuff is heaven on my skin and it smells so divine. My bathroom smells wonderful all the time now because I use it so frequently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have eczema on my eyelids and my forehead, and have been having a terrible time with my eyelids drying out and getting puffy and wrinkly due to all the washing and gels and moisturizers and all kinds of tomfoolery. Since I&#x27;ve been taking a cotton pad with this rose water and swiping it over my eyes in the mornings and whenever I feel kinda itchy, my eyelids have smoothed out and the itching has decreased significantly. My eyelids feel soft and smooth after I use this. And smell good, too! It&#x27;s replaced a bunch of my way-more-expensive eye goop I&#x27;d been trying, and I feel a lot better in general. I don&#x27;t have to use much, and I can use it as frequently as I need without irritating my skin or my eyes themselves - I&#x27;ve gotten the rose water directly in my eyes before by accident and had no irritation at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, this, unlike some other rose waters I&#x27;ve tried, almost never ever makes my skin red. If I apply it after using some other products (I haven&#x27;t taken the time to figure out which yet), sometimes I&#x27;ll get a little bit red, but nothing like some of the other rose waters I&#x27;ve used that make me look like I&#x27;ve been slapped silly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, this is the best I&#x27;ve tried and will keep buying it for as long as I can. If I could get this on subscribe-and-save, I would in a heartbeat. It&#x27;s inexpensive and delightful in every way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit: I wonder what one person decided this review was unhelpful. Maybe they didn&#x27;t like the product themselves so they decided that a good review was unhelpful. Or maybe they took offense to the snarky &amp;#34;vor-mag&amp;#34; comment. Or maybe, like some YouTubers, they go around clicking &amp;#34;not helpful&amp;#34; on everything. I dunno, but it&#x27;s weird.like the product themselves so they decided that a good review was unhelpful. Or maybe they took offense to the snarky &amp;#34;vor-mag&amp;#34; comment.

    <li> I am a connoisseur of body products, especially natural,and the chemical free kind. This fits the bill. Those who are new to natural products may find this to be a hard transition if one is accustomed to chemicals. For one, rose water, is just that rose water, Nothing special. Rose has a natural fragrance and it comes through beautifully, light and airy. Great for whole body as well as adding to food which I do often. I love any product that is good for outside and inside the body, can&#x27;t be beat. My mom who is in her mid-60&#x27;s with extremely sensitive skin has found using this product is best on her body versus face. As a side Rose water can be drying if you already suffer from dry sensitive skin- moisturizer is key, and the rose water can be mix with a good lotion or body butter.  I highly recommend this product, Purchase a small bottle, and build up. Try it with various things. Rose loves everyone, just gotta find your nitch.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure about this product, it seems to leave me flaky, and the rose scent is strong, I like the scent &amp; the ritual but not sure why I&#x27;m flaking or if this product helps anything on my face.</li>
    <li> The product is fine bit it was shipped in splash bottles and&lt;br /&gt;NOT in atomizer mist sprayers as advertised Please send me&lt;br /&gt;a spray bottle I can refill.</li>
    <li> The best Rosewater that I have ever used!I will definitely order it again when my supplies get low.Excellent product and price.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product for multiple reasons: I wanted to use it as a toner, for baking, perfume, and part of my skin care routine. It was an added bonus that for the price, you recieve three! It arrived on time and it came exactly as described and pictured. It smells amazing and so far it&#x27;s doing wonders for my skin! A little of this stuff goes a long way so I&#x27;m giving a bottle or two away as gifts. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seller was also super friendly and courteous by emailing me promptly by ensuring i have received my product. I would buy from them again</li>
    <li> Mix it with essential oils (tea tree and lavendar) and some witch hazel.  Better toner than the expensive stuff you buy at the mall.</li>
    <li> I use this to make my own skin cream. It lends a beautiful scent.</li>
    <li> Great product smells great. Ships fast</li>
    <li> I mix this with organic apple cider vinegar and use it as a toner. Works wonder on my skin!!!!</li>
    <li> I love this rose water, I get it at wholefoods but you can get it from any health food store.I love the way it smells on me after a clean shower.Its nice not too strong but a natural smell and its water based</li>
    <li> I was sceptical about this product when I first got it but it turns out to work really well for me. I find it works best when my face is still damp. It smells nice, not heavily perfumed. I have the smaller size and it will travel well. Its summer now but I can imagine it being handy in the harsh winter cold. a pritz of moisture to combat dry winter skin!!</li>
    <li> WOW this stuff is great! I did an at-home keratin treatment a few months ago and ever since, my hair has been extremely dry, brittle and impossible to detangle. I&#x27;ve done loads of research and become a product junkie in the process of searching for something to return my hair to it&#x27;s pre-keratin state. High-end, low-end you name it! I&#x27;ve tried it. I have sprayed this in my hair twice a day since I bought it three days ago and oh my goodness it has done WONDERS for my hair! It finally feels like normal hair and not some crispy crunchy stuff on top of my head. My hair is super soft, shiny and very easy to detangle. I have also noticed significantly less breakage. I think the texture of hair that grows out of my head is 3c and the length of my hair is more loosely curled and wavy (3b maybe?) from straightening it and damage from the keratin treatment. No matter what I do, if I wear my hair curly it ends up all fluffed up by the end of the day. I don&#x27;t mind that, but if I spray this in it while it&#x27;s all fluffy it&#x27;ll curl right back up onto nice, defined curls which water alone doesn&#x27;t do!! I plan to use it when I straighten my hair as well, it is replacing my chemical-laden leave-in conditioner. I&#x27;m going to just spray it in my damp hair after washing it, put a heat protectant serum on top, let it air dry, then flat iron. I&#x27;ll come back and update when I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In conclusion:&lt;br /&gt;-This rosewater is AMAZING. It has brought my extremely damaged hair back to life.&lt;br /&gt;-It smells heavenly&lt;br /&gt;-I bought it at my local Whole Foods&lt;br /&gt;-Costs $8.99&lt;br /&gt;-I used it by mixing 75% rosewater and 25% distilled water in a spray bottle (I did this because the one that I bought did not come with a spray top and I also read that rosewater strengthens your hair in some way and I just wanted to err on the side of caution and dilute it a bit. Since I&#x27;m recovering from protein overload my hair certainly doesn&#x27;t need any help in the strength department.)</li>
    <li> Love this Rosewater! I have a little bit of redness around my T-Zone area otherwise my skin is combo, sensitive and clear. I use this as a toner, twice daily and  after washing my face; I spray some on a cotton pad and a little on my face and gently wipe away. I occasionally use it on razor burn skin and relieves it quickly. My skin feels refreshed, clean and soft. I&#x27;ve used very expensive Rosewater before and I find this one to be better. The scent isn&#x27;t overwhelming at all, and it&#x27;s clear, not pink unlike previous ones I&#x27;ve used. After two months, I&#x27;ve only used half a bottle and that&#x27;s with constant twice a day use. Excellent price for straight up Rosewater.</li>
    <li> The fragrance is definitely roses. The scent is light and not overpowering. I like to keep it in the fridge and use it as a face pick me up. I like to spray my natural hair with in as a morning refresher.</li>
    <li> This smells like old lady water. I bought it to scent and accent some homade hair and skin products. Yuck. This smells awful and fake. Too strong too fake floral.</li>
    <li> This has many uses. I am using it for my skin and hair</li>
    <li> This smells so great and works wonderful! I pretty much use this in the summer when it is so hot I just spray it all over my face and neck (I keep it in the fridge) and it feels great. I don&#x27;t wear makeup so I can&#x27;t speak on that subject.</li>
    <li> If you like sweet, floral scents, specifically the smell of roses, you will love this. If you do not, you will hate it.  Very strong, distinct scent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I apply it all over the body with a cotton ball post-shower in lieu of perfume. Soaks right in and isn&#x27;t at all overpowering. I have used this on my face about a few times, but I haven&#x27;t noticed if it has the magical powers other people claim that it has. Objectively, I will tell you that it leaves my skin feeling moisturized and dewy-looking, not at all tight and dry. Then again, as someone with oily skin, \\&quot;dewy\\&quot; is my base-line. I use this when my face feels more dry than usual. Typically, I do not apply moisturizer when I use this as a toner in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this 3-pack August 9, 2013 and as of October 7, 2013, I am not half way through the first bottle. Again, the smell is potent, so a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> Wonderful for a refreshing pick me up and I also use it in oil cleansing of my face.  A delicate rose fragrance not over powering it is perfect.</li>
    <li> I love it. I use it on all my beds and sheets.</li>
    <li> Great product! I love using it to make my homemade body lotion.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  I use it on my natural hair style in the morning before I add my cream moisturizer, and at night before I flat twist my hair.</li>
    <li> I absolutely ADORE this product!!  I&#x27;ve used this product &amp; brand for over 3 yrs and find its scent very calming &amp; soothing- while giving my spirit a little lift! I was so happy to see Amazon carry this brand of Rosewater, especially with AmazonPrime! I have always purchased this brand at my local healthfood store, and unfortunately would pay a small fortune, but this 3 pk is soooo much more affordable- it makes it sooooo worth it!!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this rosewater.  I found it years ago in the baking aisle at The Mercantile in Lawrence, KS, and haven&#x27;t found one that matched its quality and refreshing scent since.  I use it as a toner (add part witch hazel in the summer; use alone in winter), \\&quot;setting\\&quot; mist for mineral makeup, and keep it in my bag as a light perfume/refresher for my skin, especially when I&#x27;m feeling funky during a long work day - or need a little \\&quot;pick me up.\\&quot;  It&#x27;s such a pleasant, light scent and does wonders for my skin when I actually use it (spray onto cotton balls/pads and wipe carefully upwards, or mist over face).  I spray it all over my skin after a shower, too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This 3-pack has the MIST NOZZLE at the top, which I appreciated.  It&#x27;s not a squirt bottle, as shown.</li>
    <li> Good price.  I use it everyday to increase my vibrations.  I also use it on my hands right before I am going to give a Healing Touch session.  Highly recommend this to any energy worker.</li>
    <li> Heritage Rosewater removed old acne scars and &amp;#34;liver spots&amp;#34; from my skin and made my skin soft, smooth and flawless after less than two weeks of using it.  My family, friends and coworkers were amazed by the sudden transformation and sometimes strangers ask what I use on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am studying herbalism and began eating herbs and drinking lots of herbal infusions several months ago, but it was not until I began spraying Heritage Rosewater on my skin several times everyday that my complexion cleared very quickly and beautifully.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I keep Heritage Rosewater in my purse, glove compartment, gym bag, and my desk at work and just received another nine bottles to ensure that I have it always.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this product, it always exceeds my expectations and the smell is fabulous!  I have never used a better smelling rosewater product and the refreshment I get from spritzing this rosewater on my face (especially when I keep it cold in the refrigerator in summertime) is THE BEST!  Cool, refreshing and wonderfully rose scented, it smothers my face in heaven!  And, not to be forgotten is the awesome price this company offers, especially when you purchase the three pack!!  Thank you Heritage Products!!</li>
    <li> Timely arrival. Smells wonderful. I use this in my homemade facial scrub, and it is the perfect hydrosol for so many recipes. Love it!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s absoultely beautiful without being too overpowering.  Description said atomizer but it came with a cap instead but I didnt purchase it for the bottle.  I will continue to buy this rosewater for years to come.</li>
    <li> Very nice aroma.  Use it from another reviewer recommendation to assist the Original Hyaluronic Acid Serum 100% Pure helping hydrate face and neck.  But it is great to spray all over.  Picked up cheap travel 2 ounce spray bottles at the store to use this with.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this rose water, I use it as facial toner, spray my hair before styling, add it to homemade lotions.</li>
    <li> I have known for some time that Rose, good quality rose products are the best. I bought this on a whim at whole foods, and I started using it as a body mist. Then as a face toner and refreshening mist. Then one day I was running late and I forgot to put all the usual hair treatments that I would usually put on. I only sprayed this onto my damp, not wet, hair and managed to put frutics silky smooth anti humidity serum. I started drying my hair and it felt so much smoother and lighter. I have puffy hair. Not curly or straight, just damaged. Well with this rose water my hair dried straight without even using a straightener. I am in shock and delight. My skin has less blemishes, and some scars are healing and disappearing. I am so glad I bought this. I also bought the oil and I remove my makeup with it. I also use it for my hair and body. This Rose water is high quality and you should definitely give it a try.</li>
    <li> Researched this and read all of the reviews. Decided to try it and I have notice a difference in my skin. I will keep using it and I also love the smell of it.</li>
    <li> My favorite Rose Water company quit making their Rose Floral Water (Green Valley Lab).  I have been searching for a replacement since I desperately needed it since it calms my panic attacks and also helps me fall asleep.  I have bought several different rose waters and have been disappointed either by the scent or by the rose water being oily.  This time I bought 3 different brands from Amazon, I have received two of them so far and they are both very good...but this one is a 100% match for what I used to use!  I spray it on my face, pillowcase and blanket.  The scent is very fresh and REAL, not overpowering or artificial like the others I have tried. Also it is not oily which was a concern since I use it on my face and linens!  I am so glad I finally found this...now I can rest easy!</li>
    <li> I have been using this toner for a long time.. I usually use this as not only a toner but also a hair spray and body spray. It works in both ways..</li>
    <li> I use this literally from head to toe: here&#x27;s now.&lt;br /&gt;1. As a toner after cleansing.&lt;br /&gt;2. As a cleanser in the morning to freshen my face after sleep.&lt;br /&gt;3. In my hair before coconut oil (light spritz then seal it in).&lt;br /&gt;4. Pre-deodorant, as an anti-perspirant (2-3 sprays then allow to dry, follow up with a natural deo like soapwalla or coconut oil).&lt;br /&gt;5. Decant some into a mini spray bottle and keep with me for when I feel a bit sick or if something in the office smells.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ok, well maybe not to toe, but it has may uses in my bathroom.</li>
    <li> This is by FAR the best smelling rose water currently available. I used to buy Home Health brand, but can&#x27;t find t any more. I think this is about the same (thankfully!). Very light &amp; fresh. It smells just like roses, but it&#x27;s not overwhelming. Perfect is the word.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this brand of rose water.  I use it as a refreshing toner on my face and I also make an aloe vera, rose water &amp; vegetable glycerin spritz for my 4a-4b natural hair. This rose water is simply divine and it smells amazing!</li>
    <li> I normally hate rose scented things but this smells really delicious and beautiful - very natural. The scent is not strong and dissipates quickly. I like using it on my face as a toner or quick pick me up spray. I&#x27;m not sure if it &#x27;does anything&#x27; but it feels nice, smells nice, and is cheap.</li>
    <li> My second order .  The family loves it</li>
    <li> Lovely rose smell...gone as soon as it drys. Absolutely no residual aroma. Very dissapointing . What I thought was a bargain ( I guess you get what you pay for)</li>
    <li> this is a regular repurchase for me. I use as a facial toner, in my bath and overall skin and hair spritzer. I enjoy this product</li>
    <li> I love the rose water...  I use it to set my makeup, or just before moisturizing.  also when I want a to freshen up a bit just spritz my face...the scent make me feel as though I&#x27;m walking through a rose garden...  wish they had it in a room spray or perfume.</li>
    <li> For the same quality product as on the store shelves, this one is about 1/3 of the price.&lt;br /&gt;The same brand for the sane price.</li>
    <li> Fantastic! Love this product, and sent one bottle to my aunt in South Carolina.</li>
    <li> I have been using this spray for years.  A great way to cool off on a hot day.  Rose is a wonderful light fragrance and very healthy for the body.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  I spray it all over my face to help set my makeup.  The smell is very nice and fresh, and it does not irritate my sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I spray my bed linens when I make my bed, I keep a bottle in the fridge during hot weather to spray my face, I&#x27;ve sprayed my dog when he is a little stinky between baths.  I&#x27;ve heard of so many uses and my grandma wore rosewater as her perfume.</li>
    <li> I always thought of rosewater as something older women used 20 years ago.&lt;br /&gt;Boy was I missing out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Heritage Products Rosewater is used on a daily basis in my home.  I do not wash my hair everyday, neither does my 9 y.o. daughter, and we both spray our hair with this to make it easier to brush out (for her) and to freshen and restyle for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It imparts a light fragrance that fades relatively quickly while not leaving any greasy residue, nor does it weigh our hair down at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also use it as a refreshing spray on my face, both after cleansing and at other times as needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Final use (so far) has been to stop static electricity in my hats and clothing.  Quick spray on the item, or my self, and the hold of the static is broken.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended, I even stocked up to make sure I don&#x27;t run out.</li>
    <li> Reasonable price for a reasonable quality rose water. No need to spend more if you are making your own simple mists or other products</li>
    <li> I use this after showers as a body freshening spray. My husband likes the smell. So, I&#x27;ll be purchasing more in the future.</li>
    <li> Used this for my face Hydrosal Spray smells WONDERFUL! Like a garden of roses!</li>
    <li> i love, love, LOVE this rose spray! it smells amazing, and once i start spraying, i don&#x27;t want to stop! i highly recommend if you are goddessly and love to pamper yourself with delicious smells.</li>
    <li> The authentic aroma of this exquisite rose water is intoxicatingly beautiful. I have tried many on the market and Heritage&#x27;s takes the prize. This water has also been voticized and brought to a higher vibrational energy level, which imparts a magnificent inner radiance to your skin!</li>
    <li> I recently suffered a crazy breakout on my face for a couple months and went to the dermatologist who prescribed me medicine that dried out my face so bad it would peel uncontrollable (horrifying when out in public!). So I looked for something to moisturize my face. This had good review so why not, right?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;+ Smells nice&lt;br /&gt;+ Just spray on&lt;br /&gt;+ Comes in a pack of 3&lt;br /&gt;+ Provides cool, refreshed feeling, but...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;- only lasted for a minute, literally; smell went away, moisture went away&lt;br /&gt;- didn&#x27;t really bring relief for dry skin&lt;br /&gt;- I tried to mix with some jojoba oil but this product is mostly water so it didn&#x27;t mix well (obviously, but I had to try)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I can&#x27;t say I&#x27;d recommend this to anyone. I won&#x27;t be purchasing this again. If you enjoy the smell and instant fresh feeling then you may like this. It was nice at first but it doesn&#x27;t last. I know some people will disagree with me but this is my personal experience with it.</li>
    <li> This is no longer manufactured by Heritage House -- it&#x27;s now manufactured by something called &amp;#34;Seychelles Organics, Inc.&amp;#34; and it&#x27;s not as good now. There&#x27;s less rose scent.   Seychelles Organics also bought out the company essential-oil company &amp;#34;Simplers&amp;#34;, and I&#x27;ve noticed a steep decline in that company&#x27;s products as well.</li>
    <li> You could very well create your own but Heritage is the next best thing! This spray feels wonderful against my sensitive skin and is perfect for after showers, baths, or if I want to feel cool and smell nice. I also treat my childs delicate skin with a few light sprays and it sure beats lotions, creams and powders. The spray is of course easy to use so you quickly get an all over spritz. And the second this stuff touches my face, I feel a difference, it truly is refreshing. I love it, and it has become an essential beauty product.... I have more than one bottle in the house just in case.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about a week, saw the reviews on this and decided to give it a try. I have acne prone skin, it is extremely sensitive so I&#x27;ve noticed if I use products that are natural products they don&#x27;t irritate my skin. With using this only a week I can tell that it&#x27;s not harsh and leaves my skin feeling clean but not dried out and also no residue. I am going to continue using this and would recommend it to others who have sensitive skin and just need a light moisturizer.</li>
    <li> good quality, love it</li>
    <li> Love this Rosewater! I use this for toning after cleansing and I also use it for wetting makeup brushes to intensify color or to blend concealer and lastly, I use it for setting or refreshing my makeup. It smells so nice, just like roses! Three 8oz bottles for the price is unbeatable! Will definitely purchase again.</li>
    <li> This truly smells like roses at a reasonable cost and is safe to use on any part of my face or skin. It doesn&#x27;t burn if it gets in my eyes.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t let the pink bottle fool you - the rosewater is clear, as it should be. This is high-quality rosewater that I use every morning and night. It soothes my sensitive skin and also cleans off any extra makeup residue. GREAT VALUE AND GREAT PRICE - LOVE IT.</li>
    <li> Do these 4 things for happy skin,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Cleanse gently with a paraben-free cleanser, mornings and evenings, using a brush system with bristles for sensitive skin, at least once a day.&lt;br /&gt;2. Spray liberally with this rose water after every cleanse.&lt;br /&gt;3. Use a quality serum suited to your age and skin requirements, Laser Focus Repair Wear by Clinique is VERY GOOD and reasonably priced.&lt;br /&gt;4. Moisturize with, at least, a 15 SPF creme that contains no petroleum products in the mornings. Re-apply if needed during the day.</li>
    <li> I use this in a mixture for a moisturizing spray.  It&#x27;s sublime and non irritant to my sensitive skin.  The scent is pleasant and not overpowering. I&#x27;m in love with this product.  My skin is now happily hydrated and balanced!</li>
    <li> I use as a toner and skin refresher throughout the day.  I have a bottle on my desk, next to my bed, in my bathroom, in my purse...you get the point...it&#x27;s a must have in my day-to-day life!  I also have random eczema breakouts and it soothes the itching and burning.</li>
    <li> I love the smell, but be warned there is no mister spray - it really is a refill.</li>
    <li> This is so refreshing! I mix it with apple cider vinegar and use it as a tonic on my face. I also spray it on when I want a boost, smells wonderful and feels just as good.</li>
    <li> very good brand of rose water</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful product.  I use it as a skin freshener every time I wash my face, and I also spritz on my hair because it makes it softer.  Rose water is a great way to have subtle fragrance and it&#x27;s just really refreshing.  I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Great price for a quality product--thanks so much!</li>
    <li> Very strong rose smell. A little goes a long way</li>
    <li> My hair loves this!  I use it in my natural hair spritz along with aloe vera whole leaf juice, essential, avocado and jojoba oils.</li>
    <li> I spritz my face with this after toner/before serums &amp; after application of any powdered product. Hydrates &amp; gives a nice finish. It&#x27;s also handy to keep a small spray bottle of it nearby for those inferno ;-) moments or *any*time we&#x27;re overheated. Vanity, desk, treadmill, bedside table ~ it&#x27;s inexpensive, quick, &amp; refreshing!</li>
    <li> Excellent. Refreshing.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve bought the three pack several times now and this is my absolute favorite product. It smells like fresh fragrant roses&lt;br /&gt;And is the perfect toner. I also like to spray it all over when it&#x27;s stinky hot outside. It&#x27;s so refreshing. I also use this to wet my bangs and blow dry them for a refreshed look.</li>
    <li> When I was young, my grandmother made her own rosewater from the vintage roses growing outside her kitchen. She used it on her skin, and this is the closest I&#x27;ve come to what I remember. I also use it as an astringent with Lavera Wild Rose face products, and it&#x27;s wonderful as a full body spritzer, or room refresher. All I want now is my OWN rose garden.</li>
    <li> Very good stuff thank you</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS WATER!!!</li>
    <li> Heritage Products Rosewater has a great smell, not overpowering. It has multiple uses. Great product.</li>
    <li> WOW, am I ever so pleased with this product.  Read the reviews.  DITTO.</li>
    <li> I buy this in bulk--the smell is natural and not too sweet like some rose products, and the mist is refreshing and not cloying.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using these products for years and have been totally satisfied, in summer as an after shower refresher and in winter with a little extra vegetable glycerin.  The light scent is just right.</li>
    <li> Have been ordering this for years. Great to make face toner.</li>
    <li> I used the item on my natural hair and in my Henna. The smell was great and lift my hair really soft and manageable</li>
    <li> great for ur skin , refreshing , soothing , and smells nice</li>
    <li> Large bottle for the price. I&#x27;m sure this works for others, however, I found that when I spray this on my face it makes me break out. I think the fragrance irritates me.</li>
    <li> love this product. I use it primarily as a toner before applying moisturizer. I also spray it on bed linens.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this brand of rosewater since the late 1980&amp;#34;s.  It has an authentic scent (not fake smelling like some other brands) and not too strong.  My mother used to use rosewater as a face lotion.  I like a few squeezes of rosewater in my bath with bath salts and a little argon oil.  The combination leaves my skin feeling very clean and smooth without drying it out.  The bottles arrived quickly and very well packed.  No leaks.  Great price on Amazon too.</li>
    <li> I love this.. I don&#x27;t understand the Vortex etc... but I almost used one bottle in 2 days... Made my hair INCREDIBLY soft...My skin is glowing..The scent is very pleasant... Price is amazing. I ordered another which should be arriving today.. Love it. Will definitely order more continously... I have received compliments for my hair...Its glossy and sooo soft. I do love it.</li>
    <li> Wow! I received the package in two days!!!! Super fast shipping! Also, I was pleasantly surprised to find out that these bottles had a top that allowed me to spray the rosewater. Perfect...since I use this &amp;#34;magical&amp;#34; water to keep my hair moisturized. I am very satisfied and I will certainly be buying from this vendor again.</li>
    <li> Great product. 4 stars only due to one of the bottles cracked and leaking. Otherwise love this product and the price!</li>
