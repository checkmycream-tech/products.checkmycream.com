      <li>So far so good...</li>
      <li>The most important thing that it&#x27;s done for me is really suppress appetite and curb cravings.  </li>
      <li>But that wouldn&#x27;t be true, because it just didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
      <li>Didn&#x27;t do anything to curb appetite, never made me feel full.  </li>

<li> I can&#x27;t 100% say if the issues below are due to taking these pills but sharing with potential buyers as an FYI.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> I recently ran out for a few weeks and I have gained about 7 pounds ...</li>
<li> I bought these off a different website and it was the biggest waste of money.</li>
<li> /&gt;It seems to even effect cravings, mentally.....</li>
<li> Guaranteed to lose weight if you eat less</li>
<li> both lost with this because of the appetite loss, we ate much less.  </li>
<li> It was just a blue-brown watery mess.</li>

<li> used it for a few weeks and lost a few pounds but not in the hard to lose areas.......</li>
<li> It keeps my usual neverending desire to snack at bay and keeps me from overeating at meals.  </li>
<li> Did not suppress my appetite and game me major migraines...would not recommend this to anyone seriously!</li>
<li> The 4 stars is because the 3times a day dosing is hard for me to remember to take.</li>
<li> Straight crap.</li>
<li> I started the pills on Monday and by Sunday I was down 5 pounds!!!</li>
<li> Having said that, I would tell people that who are considering buy it, that just cause it didn&#x27;t work for me doesn&#x27;t mean it won&#x27;t work for them.</li>
<li> my appetite has decreased within 2 days of use</li>
<li> I have not finished the bottle yet, but it does seem to suppress my appetite without making me feel uncomfortable.</li>
<li> this gave me a really bad headache</li>
<li> Or am I just being stupid?</li>
<li> The worst diet pills ever!!!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Really like these pills. And got some great results.</li>
    <li> I have had my Zanocap pills for only about two weeks . But it does suppress my appetite ,  it said to take one or two pills and drink eight ounces of water per pill and I am doing this. I also walk on my treadmill hoping this will help also. I really think this Zanocap  pill is helping and hope to see pounds fall off soon!</li>
    <li> A friend of mine actually recommended Zanocap to me, so I figured it was worth trying.  I have always had a problem with my weight, and I attribute it to always being hungry. After taking it the first day, I noticed my appetite slowly weaning.  The next day, I went several hours without so much as one hunger pang.  Over the course of a few weeks, I have lost over 10 pounds - which is more than I ever expected!  Really great product that actually WORKS.</li>
    <li> Zanocap is among the best weight loss supplements I&#x27;ve tried..  The most important thing that it&#x27;s done for me is really suppress appetite and curb cravings.  It keeps my usual neverending desire to snack at bay and keeps me from overeating at meals.  This has made a huge difference in my ability to diet and combined with exercise, I have been dropping pounds like you wouldn&#x27;t believe..  I am so pleasantly surprised with the effectiveness of Zanocap.. highly recommended!</li>
    <li> The worst diet pills ever!!! Did not suppress my appetite and game me major migraines...would not recommend this to anyone seriously! 1 star is too much</li>
    <li> They didnt assist in curbing my appetite, may just be me.&lt;br /&gt;They however, did NOT make me jittery, which was nice!</li>
    <li> I bought these off a different website and it was the biggest waste of money. They claim that these pills surpress your appetite by forming a gel in your stomach. I put two of these in a cup and allowed them to fully dissolve and there was NO gel -like substance. It was just a blue-brown watery mess. I also took these for a week and experience no appetite suppression. If you notice all the positive reviews have extremely similar grammar and all pretty much say the same thing. I&#x27;ve tried lipodrene (with ephedra) and Alli in the past and had good results so I&#x27;m going back to that.</li>
    <li> It was ok.... Just made me jittery</li>
    <li> this gave me a really bad headache</li>
    <li> Wonderful product... would recommend it to anyone.  Fast shipping and fast results! !</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t do anything to curb appetite, never made me feel full.  Doesn&#x27;t do what it advertised that it would do</li>
    <li> Very simple but works....the fiber in the pill expands in your stomach and therefore you feel full and eat less at each meal. Guaranteed to lose weight if you eat less and that is what happened to me. Would have to recommend this product as it definitely worked.</li>
    <li> ONE MONTH TWO BOTTLES WEIGHT GAIN NOT LOSS&lt;br /&gt;DONT DO IT TO YOURSELF.  I GUESS MAYBE IT IS  FOR PEOPLE WHO JUST WANT TO THINK THEY ARE DOING SOMETHING</li>
    <li> Wow, what a great product.  This helped me and a friend of mine with our appetites.  It really cuts the cravings at times when we feel like we just have to eat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It seems to even effect cravings, mentally.....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used it for a few weeks and lost a few pounds but not in the hard to lose areas.......I coupled it with this:  [[ASIN:B00J7WKZ3Y Safe, Fast Weight Loss Diet Drops, 2 Oz, Includes E-book and Low Calorie Weight-loss Recipes, Free Liquid Vitamin B-12]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I immediately saw the weight start to come off of the love handles.  My friend lost more behind her arms and on her thighs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We both lost with this because of the appetite loss, we ate much less.  When we did both, it seemed to start to target unwanted areas specifically.  I thought I would pass on my experience.</li>
    <li> Straight crap. Doesn&#x27;t work</li>
    <li> Constipated me. Wish I could return them. Ugh</li>
    <li> The product did control my hunger and it helped me lose weight.</li>
    <li> diet going good on these capsules. Lost 5 lbs in 2 weeks so staying with it and going back to kickboxing to hopefully the assist the weight loss process before the holidays hit.</li>
    <li> I bought these hoping to use in conjunction with my exercise routine but will not ever purchase again (see below). I run 8 miles a day and monitor my weight and fat % daily, along with monitoring my calories/fat/protein intake. The upside of this product was that it helped curb my appetite and cravings, however I did not make any changes to my diet/exercise routine while taking this product. I can&#x27;t 100% say if the issues below are due to taking these pills but sharing with potential buyers as an FYI.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Issues:&lt;br /&gt;* gained 8-10 pounds (yes, pounds) in a week after starting to take pills, appears to be all water weight&lt;br /&gt;* no change to body fat % in that week, increase in water % per fitness scale&lt;br /&gt;* bloating all over my body&lt;br /&gt;* after I stopped taking these pills lost five pounds of water in first two days and remaining five pounds several days later</li>
    <li> Greatly helps in curbing my desire to over eat. I make sure to take some before a social function or any opportunity to over eat for that matter.</li>
    <li> This product did curve my appetite and cravings for sweets which was my biggest weakness. I also received the product in just a few days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;K. Smith</li>
    <li> Wish I could say that this product worked &amp; that I would recommend it to friends and family. But that wouldn&#x27;t be true, because it just didn&#x27;t work for me. Having said that, I would tell people that who are considering buy it, that just cause it didn&#x27;t work for me doesn&#x27;t mean it won&#x27;t work for them.</li>
    <li> Do they really need to be refrigerated?? It says thy do on the bottle. Or am I just being stupid?</li>
    <li> I have been taking zanocap for about 4 months and I have lost 20 pounds ..I recently ran out for a few weeks and I have gained about 7 pounds ...so this product works for me</li>
    <li> To be honest, I had so much problem with my weight. I was even insulted a few times because I was fat. But trust me, since I tried Zanocap Weight Loss. I am having a wonderful life, I feel like a million bucks!  I have lost over 60 lbs in a little over 9 months.  I found Zanocap product on the Amazon while I was looking for a bypass surgeon. This is the first diet product that I have ever tried that didn&#x27;t make me nervous. I would highly recommend this to anyone troubling with his/her weight, this product is for you. Get it while it lasts.</li>
    <li> So far so good...my appetite has decreased within 2 days of use</li>
    <li> Thanks you so much for this product! I have dieted my whole life and have never found anything that has worked so well. I started the pills on Monday and by Sunday I was down 5 pounds!!! I couldn&#x27;t believe the scale when I got on, I feel so incredible and on top of that I look incredible too. I never feel hungry and as of today I am down 24 pounds! I now have my mom and sister taking them as well and they are both doing great as well.&lt;br /&gt;I highly suggest these for anyone!&lt;br /&gt;S. Taylor</li>
    <li> I have not finished the bottle yet, but it does seem to suppress my appetite without making me feel uncomfortable.</li>
    <li> I am very satisfied and happy because Zanocap I am losing weight without much effort because for my job I have no time to exercise and I&#x27;m seeing results 😊😆😉</li>
    <li> Great at cutting cravings and between meal snacks without any side effects. The 4 stars is because the 3times a day dosing is hard for me to remember to take.</li>
    <li> so far so good - lost 5 lbs</li>
