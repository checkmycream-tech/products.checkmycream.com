<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This was a great value, a rechargeable brush that doesn&#x27;t break the bank! Simple to use, easy to charge and comes with replaceable heads!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing I would change about it is to add some sort of charging indicator, as you simply just place it on the charging stand and the toothbrush charges.</li>
    <li> Love this refill brush heads, too bad company don&#x27;t make same brush line any more.</li>
    <li> We need more time to see how they work, it is fast enough but don&#x27;t know how durable it is</li>
    <li> Performs well and was great price.  Replaces a gift from my husband of a much more expensive model that didn&#x27;t last&lt;br /&gt;long.</li>
    <li> I have somewhat mixed feelings about this toothbrush. On the PLUS side, it does a good job of cleaning around the gumline but the head is so small (MINUS) that it misses places when cleaning overall. I also like that it is rechargeable, so I don&#x27;t have to waste money on replacing batteries. I&#x27;ve had two electric toothbrushes prior to this and both did better jobs of overall cleaning because they had additional vibrating bristles behind their heads that also cleaned, but neither had replaceable cleaning heads, which meant you threw them away when the heads wore out. (Or as I did, press them into service in other jobs such as cleaning jewelry and other items like the geodes I sell on eBay.) The one feature I really like on this toothbrush that neither of my previous models had is the timer. Since none of the lower-end brushes have this feature, you may wish to make that feature more prominent in your sales literature,</li>
    <li> My dentist recommended the toothbrush because the brush is small. I can get it in the small places&lt;br /&gt;between my teeth.  I love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pat&lt;br /&gt;.</li>
    <li> This is a new toothbrush. Works great and has a nice small base.&lt;br /&gt;Fits perfectly on the shelf I have for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you.</li>
    <li> I liked my older model  Vitality better this one hits against my teeth for some reason not sure why though</li>
    <li> Cleans my teeth much better than a manual. This is my first electric. Got it for my 2 and 4 year olds as well and they clean their teeth with it pretty easily...just need my help with the top really. Fits in their little mouths and the dentist is always impressed by their white smiles. I pair it with Pronamel toothpaste for my sensitive teeth.</li>
    <li> Opening the packaging on this Oral-B Vitality toothbrush was a nightmare.  It took two people using scissors, knives and pliers.  I hate to think how an older person could possibly open it.  No pull tabs, no instructions.  Double sealed and inpenetrable!  If you can open it, it is a very good battery operated toothbrush.  Very easy to use and cleans very well.  Charger and toothbrush make a very slim unit so it doesn&#x27;t take up a lot of room on the countertop.</li>
    <li> great easy to use was telling friends  and relative how great they go hand and hand forgot how good it makes your teeth feel</li>
    <li> I got this after seeing a Jillian Micheals Infomercial and I love it! I could use it after every meal if I had time.  I enjoy that there is a timer on the toothbrush...</li>
    <li> This was a gift for my (adult) son. Since he had recently had his braces taken off, his lower gums were having problems. I told him about my experience with this toothbrush and that my dental hygienist noticed a great improvement in my gum health since I had switched to the Oral-B. Great toothbrush, good service from this vendor.</li>
    <li> first one lasted for almost ever.  good, in expensive, basic, no frills electric toothbrush. price right. does the job it&#x27;s supposed to do very well.</li>
    <li> The unit delivers plenty of cleaning power in a small, affordable package. Good battery life. Recharges quickly enough,...after the initial charging. Replacement heads aren&#x27;t the cheapest, but they&#x27;re easy to find.</li>
    <li> This works well for me but I find that it easily loses its charge.  For example, the electricity went out for 32 hours, and for weeks it would die mid-brushing.  I found the solution was to let it sit and charge for 48 hours without using it- it&#x27;s lasting the full 2 minutes now.</li>
    <li> This is my first mechanical toothbrush and I&#x27;m surprised by just how well it seems to work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ordinarily when I brush my teeth (the old-fashioned way), I feel a bit of a film on my teeth from the paste, but with this brush, my teeth feel scrubbed dry, the way they feel when I come home from the dentist!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having the oscillating head also makes it much easier to scrub your back teeth which are a little awkward to get leverage on with your average toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You have to go a little easy, however, because the brush is so strong it might make your gums bleed a little until they get used to it (like with flossing).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did notice the upright charger tends to gather toothpaste water a bit faster than a normal toothbrush holder can, but it&#x27;s a small gripe.</li>
    <li> This is my first electric toothbrush. I am extremely happy with it. I would recommend it as an entry-level electric toothbrush to those who are too unsure about the technology to pay for one of the more higher priced models.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Full disclosure: I received this toothbrush free as part of the Amazon Vine program. However, at the low cost of $29.99 I probably would&#x27;ve bought it anyway. I think it is definitely worth that price for a first-time electric toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CLEANING: My teeth get much cleaner when I use this toothbrush versus my traditional one. They feel smooth, just like I came from the dentist. Flossing also seems easier while using this toothbrush because, with the right tilt on the brush, it is better able to clean between my teeth and at the gum line, so there seems to be less tartar buildup when I floss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WHITENING: The stain removal is EXCELLENT. My teeth are not that stained, but during the 2 weeks I&#x27;ve been using this brush, I&#x27;ve noticed a *significant* decrease in the yellow stains near my gum line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BATTERY: This may sound odd, but I liked the way the battery ran out. I was a bit concerned about what would happen and how I would handle it (the instructions give no clue). It pretty much just stops working, no wind-down at all. I liked that because it left no mystery as to \\&quot;will it or won&#x27;t it\\&quot; finish and I just finished brushing my teeth with it manually. I&#x27;ve used this toothbrush 1-2 times per day for over 2 weeks now, and I&#x27;ve only had to charge it once.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;REPLACEMENTS: The brush indicates when it needs to be replaced via color loss on the bristles (just like some traditional toothbrushes do). It does come with an extra head, as well as a $3 coupon for another one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DROPLETS: The only negative on this toothbrush is probably just due to my inexperience with electric toothbrushes: it sprays toothpaste droplets onto my clothing. Now I try to brush my teeth before I dress, or else I drape a hand towel over my blouse while brushing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;VIBRATIONS: As others have mentioned, the vibrations are INCREDIBLY strong on this toothbrush. You should NOT press it hard against your teeth; just lay it gently onto them and let the brush do the work for you. My teeth are EXTREMELY sensitive (I have several cracked ones) and once I stopped pressing with the brush, I had no problems with pain due to the vibrations. However, the vibrations DO make my nose ticklish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unlike other reviewers, I have NOT experienced any \\&quot;gunk\\&quot; buildup in the toothbrush stand because I always rinse off my toothbrush the way the instructions say to. (If you put ANY toothbrush back in its holder without rinsing it well enough, you&#x27;re going to get \\&quot;gunk.\\&quot;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I would recommend this as a fine first electric toothbrush, especially at this price point.shing.

    <li> This is a well-thought out and well-executed electric toothbrush system. Things certainly have come a long way since the early days of this technology. In addition to being an effective tool with changeable heads, it is also a very reasonably priced tool. I just can&#x27;t say enough good things about this system. A great system at a great price; I can&#x27;t think of anything negative to say about this product. The results have been immediate and noticeable, at least in how clean my teeth feel.</li>
    <li> I love this toothbrush! My teeth feel so much cleaner than with the crappy battery-operated ones I&#x27;ve been using. Well worth the investment.</li>
    <li> Update: (Feb 2012)&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using the Vitality toothbrush for over a year now and still love it. I purchased they for the rest of the family and my 11 year old is doing a much better brushing.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve never had any problems with this toothbrush running low on power, even when I&#x27;m away from home (and the charger) for a few days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Original Review: (Sept 2010)&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using the Oral-B power toothbrush for a few weeks now and I&#x27;m very pleased with it. Other electric toothbrushes did an ok job, but they usually had problems with getting gummed up with residue or lacked much in the energy department.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Oral-B power toothbrush has a brush head that&#x27;s about 1/2\\&quot; in diameter that consists of a small rubber cup in the middle and is surrounded by bristles on the edges. I&#x27;m able to maneuver it easily to the every tooth surface and get the some spots that I couldn&#x27;t get to with a conventional brush. I find that I&#x27;m able to get away with using about half of the toothpaste I did before. As a result, much less is wasted and there are no excess globs of toothpaste getting washed down the drain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One feature I really love is the inductive charging base. It doesn&#x27;t have any exposed contacts, which means the brush is easy to rinse off after I brush. The base is easy to keep clean for the same reason.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The power switch is behind a flexible rubber part of the grip and is easy to turn on and off. The brush isn&#x27;t especially quiet when it runs, but that&#x27;s not a big deal. It&#x27;s not deafening either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s doing a great job keeping my teeth cleaned with much less effort than a regular brush. I&#x27;m very happy with it.</li>
    <li> The Oral-B Vitaility Prowhite Rechargeable Power Tooth Brush is a really good Power Tooth Brush. The Brush ocillates to provide an excllent cleaner. It is really effective on removing placque from the teeth. It also leave teeth with a very clean feel. I recommend this brush if you are looking for a very effective Power Tooth Brush. You will get your money&#x27;s worth.</li>
    <li> It seems to work well but the replacement heads are pricy and only last about two months.</li>
    <li> The whitening aspect of a toothbrush isn&#x27;t very important to me. I&#x27;m interested in cavity prevention. I&#x27;m also concerned that some of the power brushes are too powerful - my teeth get sensitive. After trying a number of different brush / paste combos I&#x27;ve been doing pretty well with the cheap [[ASIN:B0001WXTRI Crest SpinBrush Pro, Soft Bristles (Colors May Vary)]]. Recently, the Crest brush began bothering my teeth to the point that I returned to a manual brush. I was looking for an alternate option when the opportunity to try this Oral-b Vitality brush came up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s lightweight and compact, so I can take it when I travel. Against the market as a whole, it&#x27;s fairly inexpensive so losing the brush isn&#x27;t a concern. I like the sealed construction - once a week I place it on the charging base and that&#x27;s it. I think that when the battery dies it&#x27;s non-replaceable nature might be an issue. The vibration is smoother than the power brush I was using, and it doesn&#x27;t bother my teeth at all. I can comfortably brush for the full time without discomfort. Flossing afterward is much quicker, showing that the Oral-b is doing an excellent job of cleaning around the tooth. I don&#x27;t think my teeth look any whiter, but since my teeth are also naturally dark this isn&#x27;t a concern for me. I&#x27;m planning to buy this brush for my children to try. For an entry level power brush, this is a solid choice.</li>
    <li> Years ago my dentist sold me a professional teeth cleaning system that had interchangable brushes and a rechargeable base.  It cost a lot of money at  the time, but it was about the best system I had tried.  Through the years my dentist moved away and my system wore out.  I&#x27;ve been searching for some time for a system that was similar.  I&#x27;ve never been satisfied with the brushes I&#x27;ve tried since that time...until now.  The Oral-b Vitality Prowhite Rechargeable Power Toothbrush isn&#x27;t exactly like the system I used to own, but it is the closest thing I&#x27;ve found.  I am going to keep this brush.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical but I must admit this product does the job its supposed to do. Works well around the teeth and gums and any appliances you may have. Leaves your teeth feeling clean.</li>
    <li> Oral-B has a number of brushes available - the Sonic, Vitality, the Professional Care family (which comprises the 1000 and 3000), and the Professional Care SmartSeries (4000 and 5000). The Oral-B 1000 is the entry level of the Professional Care series.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In my usage of the Vitality and the Oral-B 1000, the Oral-B 1000 stands at the minimum level of functionality to make an electric toothbrush viable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In particular, note that the Vitality does not have a quadrant timer (it beeps only at the end of the 2-minute cycle), is rated at only 7600 oscillations per minute, and does not have a battery charging indicator. All of which are present just one level up in the Professional Care 1000.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To me the lack of a quadrant timer is a big disappointment - I don&#x27;t want to be watching a clock while brushing if I don&#x27;t  have to. The gentle thrumming of the Professional Care 1000 every 30 seconds is a very nice pacer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brushes in the Professional Care series not only add quadrant timers, but also are rated both at 8800 oscillations per minute and at 40,000 pulsations per minute, and have battery charge indicators.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As you go higher in the Professional Care family you get multiple brush modes (daily clean, sensitive, polish, deep clean), pressure sensors, and even wireless displays.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I found the Vitality to be lacking features that I rely on. Hence my rating. I&#x27;d strongly recommend that you consider the Professional Care 1000 as the minimum entry level functionality for a brush. You&#x27;ll probably find (like I did) that you don&#x27;t need much more than what the Professional Care 1000 has to offer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Happy Brushing!</li>
    <li> Bought this to replace the one with dying battery. The new one is much more powerful and vibrate much faster.</li>
    <li> I had an Oral-B rechargeable toothbrush like this one for a few years, and eventually the battery died.  There is no easy way to replace the battery, so I purchased a new one.  This toothbrush is doing fine.  I especially like the two minute timer, and I can buy generic replacement brushes as well as Oral-B.</li>
    <li> Replacement for one that quit charging. It is very compact, powerful and does a great job. Very pleased Priced good too.</li>
    <li> I love this product so much, I&#x27;ve been looking for a decent toothbrush and I absolutely love it. I am always left with a good clean feeling after every brush. its also convenient because my boyfriend has a different model oral b electric toothbrush but we can buy the large pack from costco and have a year of replacement heads for each of us.</li>
    <li> Battery sucks and completely dies after 6months. These brushes though are stellar at whitening.</li>
    <li> Overall, the Vitality is a nice toothbrush. If one trusts the packaging, it out performs a manual toothbrush.  If price is your main concern, the Vitality is a good choice.  The included brush heads (the ones with the polishing cup) are unsatisfactory, however. The brush has too strong a vibration inside the mouth; almost as if it bouncing of teeth instead of polishing them. It&#x27;s a noisy head, to boot.  When I switched to a regular brush head, the vibrations and bounce significantly declined.    The Vitality does have its faults; especially when compared to the higher end Braun/Oral Bs.  First, the motor is not as smooth as the other brushes.  It does not seem to vibrate at as fast a rate as my other more expensive Braun.  When I compared Vitality with my other Braun (without brush heads) it was easy to see the Vitality simply vibrates more slowly and without as much power.  My other Braun is much smoother during brushing.  This smoothness means the brush bristles maintain more contact with one&#x27;s teeth during brushing.    I am not happy with the timer.  It does not have the 30 second notifiers like my other Braun.  I have to keep track of time in my head.  The 30 second timers ensure one is able to brush all one&#x27;s teeth within the two minute span.  I am sure cost kept this feature from the Vitality.    The NiCd battery within the vitality is also a weak point.  Unlike the nickle metal hydride battery in the up-level Braun/Oral B units, the NiCd takes longer to charge, suffers from battery memory, should be fully discharged before recharging, and cannot store as much power as an NiMH.  There is no included charge indicator light, as well.    So, it&#x27;s a decent brush for the budget conscious.  However, for a much better experience, look at the higher end Braun/Oral Bs.</li>
    <li> Being my first electric toothbrush it took me a few brushings before I was comfortable. Now I think it&#x27;s great. I look forward to my next teeth cleaning to see what the dentist has to say. I think they will be cleaner. I have a very small counter in my bathroom and may have preferred one with batteries instead of the charger plugged in. I&#x27;m not going to try another one though because this is great!</li>
    <li> I had an earlier model of this toothbrush and loved it but after a couple years the battery died. I wish they were replaceable but they aren&#x27;t so I purchased this model.  It seems to have more power which helps to clean the teeth.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a fact - most kids HATE to brush their teeth. It&#x27;s twice-daily battle, with everyone ending up disgruntled in the end. While this toothbrush won&#x27;t necessarily change the aggravation factor for kids, it WILL make sure that the visit to the dentist doesn&#x27;t up YOUR disgruntlement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We got this toothbrush for our 9-year-old, who not only hates to brush his teeth, but has more than his fair share of issues with said teeth. Put simply, his orthodontist bills will be horrendous. And while he still hates to brush his teeth, I can feel confident that the dental bills won&#x27;t outstrip the orthodontist. The two-minute timer is especially helpful for everyone, as Son knows when he&#x27;s done and I can listen for the toothbrush to signal rather than digging up yet another destroyed kitchen timer. The action on the toothbrush head is much better than what he can do himself, though I have no idea whether it actually removes any staining (he&#x27;s a little young for coffee and red wine issues).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price is very reasonable (particularly considering the cost of some other rechargeable toothbrushes) and the cost for the head replacements is not bad either. It&#x27;s basically a very solid electric toothbrush that just might help shave a little aggravation and/or frustration out of your day!</li>
    <li> While this is not my first time using an electric toothbrush, it has been some years since my last time. I have been using this one for a couple of weeks now and have 3 issues:&lt;br /&gt;1. The on/off button is a bit difficult to press, having to use my knuckle&lt;br /&gt;2. Probably because it is so powerful, I often splatter the vanity if I don&#x27;t keep the toothbrush well inside my mouth&lt;br /&gt;3. I do have a problem with getting motion sick on long car rides and boats, but have also surprisingly felt slightly dizzy using this device...also probably because of its power.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not completely comfortable with this product yet, but will either figure out how to best manage 1-3 above or soon go back to the old fashioned toothbrush.</li>
    <li> This toothbrush is fantastic for the price. Being rechargeable is definitely a big plus in my book. The only issue I could say is that the handle itself feels rather bulky for what it is, but that is not really a big drawback.</li>
    <li> I got this rechargeable power toothbrush  delivered quickly on time.&lt;br /&gt;The package is new and unopened and it worked very well.  The first few days&lt;br /&gt;I used it, it felt like I just got my teeth cleaned at the dentist.  My teeth felt smooth and clean.  This is a awesome toothbrush, small round bristle head is better than the sonicare long shaped one, becuase you pay more attention to&lt;br /&gt;each tooth and it&#x27;s really fast and easy to use and brush.  Now I look forward to brushing everyday and I also brought one for my wife and three kids.&lt;br /&gt;Update:  I went to costco and they had the same tooth but a professional version, which cost more money and works the same.  My recommendation is that if you can afford it then get the professional version or if not, this one works just as fine and maybe even better since it saves you money.</li>
    <li> I thought I did a fine job of taking care of my teeth on my own and bought this more or less on the suggestion of a friend when I had some cash to burn. I have to say I can feel a difference in the level of clean.</li>
    <li> Compact, easy to clean, holds a charge for a long time, Timer makes its easy to know if you have brushed enough.</li>
    <li> Excellent toothbrush..... does a great job!  I have used other Oral B products in the past, and this toothbrush does the best job of any I have tried in this past.</li>
    <li> Bought this for our daughter and it works great.  The size if fine for kids and she has been using it for several weeks without issue.  I like the timer which keeps her brushing for the appropriate amount of time and the charge has been good so far.</li>
    <li> - Very strong electronic toothbrush, but doesn&#x27;t hurt your teeth,&lt;br /&gt;- Also comes with 2 brush heads and charger.&lt;br /&gt;- It has a special vibrating motion that goes off every couple (3 or 4) minutes to warn you how long you have been brushing for&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very happy with the Oral-B toothbrush.  One thing I do not like is the brush heads that come with it.  These are not the standard brush heads I have used in the past.  These have an open center (without bristles).  Only the outer edges of the brush head have bristles.  Because of this, the plastic edge of the brush head rattles/vibrates against my teeth.  This more of a brush head problem and not the toothbrush.  So instead, I just replaced the brush heads with the standard ones I previously used.</li>
    <li> Love this toothbrush.  My teeth feel so clean all day.  The timer comes in  handy also.  Would recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> I had a Crest SpinBrush Pro.  I thought that was way better than our manual toothbrushes, but thought I&#x27;d give this a whirl.  It makes a HUGE difference!  For one, the head is much smaller than the SpinBrush.  It&#x27;s just one rotating head, whereas the SpinBrush has a rotating head and another section that goes up and down.  While I thought the rotation wouldn&#x27;t leave my mouth feeling as clean as the double-motion head of the SpinBrush, it actually felt better!  Perhaps the smaller head allows it to get to more places in my mouth, or perhaps it is that the rotation looks, sounds, and feels much faster.  The SpinBrush is battery powered and even with new batteries, I don&#x27;t think the top head spun as fast as this bad boy.  While this toothbrush costs more than the SprinBrush, it&#x27;s still relatively inexpensive and since you can replace the heads, it&#x27;s still a good option for those who don&#x27;t want to spend top dollar on an electric toothbrush.  Overall, I love this toothbrush.  We will see how it stands up over time, but for the week I&#x27;ve been using it, I feel like my mouth is cleaner.</li>
    <li> The Oral-B Vitality rechargeable toothbrush is very effective in cleaning and polishing teeth and stimulating gums.  The kit includes two ProWhite brush heads designed to remove surface stains and polish teeth bright white.  There are three types of brushing fibers in the ProWhite rotating brush, blue, white, and green, each with a different stiffness.  The longest and least stiff blue fibers gradually loose color with use indicating the remaining life of the brush (listed as 3 months).  There is a deep cleaning orange rubber center in the brush for deep cleaning of stains.  I have noticed a clean difference in the appearance of my teeth and gums after a week of using the ProWhite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The handle of the device fits the hand nicely because of its large diameter and a ribbed blue rubber grip covering the back of the smooth light blue plastic cylinder. The cylinder has a battery that is recharged by placing it upright on a plastic stand. The unit fits on the stand with a plastic receiver on a plastic plug, so electric shock to the user is avoided. The entire hand device can be rinsed completely (not the recharging stand).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is a built in timer on the Vitality that alerts the brusher when the recommended brush time of two minutes have elapsed with a noticeable pulsing action of the brushes and the accompanying change in sound from continuous to intermittent. After the timing alert, the device resumes continuous brushing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this rechargeable toothbrush.  I have switched from a regular brush to the exclusive use of the Vitality. I will order the four other brush heads each with a unique cleaning function. A $3.00 coupon for these heads is included in the kit. The rotary action of the brush is superior to the electric toothbrush I tried years ago that used an up and down motion that I did not like.</li>
    <li> The Oral-b Vitality Prowhite is okay. Ths brush is relatively inexpensive, but it also feels inexpensive, so you get what you pay for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-It works. The product came out of the package, charged, and worked without a fuss. The worst part of setup was the anti-theft plastic package.&lt;br /&gt;-Inductive charging base. The case is 100% waterproof sealed, and power is drawn by setting the brush on a holder base so that power is transferred with no risk of electric shock. Very nice.&lt;br /&gt;-The brush pulses a couple of times to let you know when you&#x27;ve done your time. Brilliant.&lt;br /&gt;-And it comes with an extra basic brush head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-Rattles your head like a jackhammer, negating most of the positives the moment it touches your teeth. The motor is relatively slow and cheap, so until you&#x27;ve used it for a while and learned to adapt you&#x27;ll be concerned that it&#x27;s going to knock your teeth out before you&#x27;re done cleaning them.&lt;br /&gt;-Standard brush head is only okay. You get the most basic brush head out of the box, which to me feels only so-so for cleaning. I sometimes have to run my brush for an extra cycle to feel really clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, if you want to try a power brush but you don&#x27;t have the money for a more expensive model, this isn&#x27;t a bad choice- it&#x27;s still better than a manual brush. However, in the realm of power toothbrushes, you can and should do better. When you weigh a lifetime of painful dental cleanings and potential surgical issues from cavities against the (hopefully) one-time investment in a good power brush, there&#x27;s really no reason to stick with an underpowered model like this that&#x27;s going to rattle your teeth like it does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I&#x27;m still going to be reusing this model for a long time to come- craft and cleaning experts know that there&#x27;s nothing like a cheap power toothbrush for doing tasks like detail cleaning leather. For this application, this is an absolute wonder of a brush. It&#x27;s cheap, and all the jackhammering works just fine when it&#x27;s done on something other than your head.g other than your head.</li>
    <li> Although this is expensive and the brush heads are also quite expensive, this electric toothbrush does what it&#x27;s supposed to - keep your teech clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s easy to use being electric (so no effort is required!).  It does help tremendously with things such as plaque and mouth sores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I keep it on the charger all the time and haven&#x27;t noticed any detrimental effect on the battery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only issue I have with any of these electric toothbrushes is their lifespan.  If they fail after 2 or 3 years, that&#x27;s quite a replacement cost to swallow.  This was a replacement for another Oral-B that I had and took on vacation.  Unfortunately, putting the charger in checked baggage on a plane caused the sealed batteries to leak and so I had to get anotehr one (tip - don&#x27;t take these on a plane!) - the base became warped due to the leaked batteries.&lt;br /&gt;Also these things are quite fragile and can break easily - so just don&#x27;t drop it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I suppose I can recommend it since it does do it&#x27;s job.  But I&#x27;d like to give it 3.5 stars ideally because of cost and lifespan.</li>
    <li> Cheap, great, does not damage my gums and in less than a week my teeth are looking whiter. Charger is very useful and the timing option is perfect for the lazy ones like me.</li>
    <li> It works as advertised. Used it in the past, love it.&lt;br /&gt;Worth the money.&lt;br /&gt;Will keep buying it, till a better one comes around.</li>
    <li> Great brush at a great price.</li>
    <li> I read other review said model 1000 is very good, but no good price yet. My old one battery is dead, don&#x27;t want to wait. It is for replacing my old one. Like it.</li>
    <li> Very good brush for the price.  The Oral-B comes with two brush heads and a charger.  The only reason for a missing star is that this unit only has One Speed.  So far we have had no problems and have traveled with it.  It will go for a week without a charge if you cannot get to power; we tried just to be sure.</li>
    <li> I had an oral b replaced it w/ this one (the battery died easy on the old one) I am still charging the new one 2xs a week&lt;br /&gt;this one is not as fast and it doesn&#x27;t have the 30 second mode or either it is not working</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t even care how well this thing works.  The package was so hard to break into it doesn&#x27;t matter.</li>
    <li> Good price and quality. My dentist has been bugging me to start using a electric toothbrush, so I have used it more and more as the days go by. I wish the replacement heads weren&#x27;t so expensive.</li>
    <li> I had one of these for 10 years and the motor finally died so I got this one and I like it even better than the one I had.  Outstanding product.  Feels nice on your teeth and does an excellent job cleaning them.  The base is also smaller than the last one I had which is nice as it takes up less space on the counter.</li>
    <li> Works very well and looks good in bathroom. Easy to use and good for all ages. Priced very good for product.</li>
    <li> I bought this to replace my wife&#x27;s older Oral-B brush that no longer held a charge very long. She preferred this one because it didn&#x27;t pulse as all the newer models seem to, just a basic spin brush. Has the usual two-minute timer. So far, no complaints.</li>
    <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Teeth feel clean&lt;br /&gt;Strong vibrations (maybe even too strong)&lt;br /&gt;Easy to use charging stand&lt;br /&gt;Extra head included&lt;br /&gt;Long charge life (I had no problems on a long weekend without the charger)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;No head cover/case for traveling&lt;br /&gt;Fully sealed - no major nooks to get dirty&lt;br /&gt;Weird timer (it pulses at 2 min but doesn&#x27;t stop)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: I have the Oral B Cross Action ([[ASIN:B002P5PRU6 Oral-B CrossAction Battery-Powered Toothbrush, Pack of 3, Plus Two Extra Replacement Brush Heads (Colors may vary) - Soft]]), which feels like it works just as well. I use a rechargeable AA battery and it came with head covers for traveling. I don&#x27;t feel like this gets my teeth any cleaner than the Cross Action. YMMV, but for me I feel the Cross Action is a better buy.</li>
    <li> I just started using Oral B electric toothbrushes. I was using a different brand of electric toothbrush and never got the clean feel I get with the Oral B. I think the difference is the size. This toothbrush has a small circular brush that spins. It&#x27;s easier to maneuver this toothbrush than the larger ones. I can even get the back of my molars with this toothbrush. Also, it seems to hold up better than the larger ones (i.e., the bristles don&#x27;t spread apart as quickly).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having said that, I found an Oral B toothbrush I like even better than this one and would give 5 stars.  The [[ASIN:B003UKKH6O Oral-b Vitality Prowhite Rechargeable Power Toothbrush, Light Blue and White]] is the same shape as this toothbrush, but has a little rubbery cup in the middle that looks sort of like a dentist&#x27;s polishing tool. And, that&#x27;s exactly what this toothbrush does. My teeth not only feel clean like with the toothbrush I&#x27;m reviewing, but they also look much whiter.</li>
    <li> I bought two of these. One for me and one for my husband.  They are just what I expected.  Sturdy, easy to use with a convenient stand for charging.</li>
    <li> Having gum problems for a couple of years already, this friend helped reduce completely the bleeding and better feeling during the day. Timer is a good way to keep control of time spent.</li>
    <li> I do not know what took me so long to get this toothbrush. it cleans very well, it is easy on your gums and it&#x27;s very user friendly.</li>
    <li> I had the previous version for years and always liked it and was amazed how long it lasted.  This new one is even better.</li>
    <li> Durable, simple, and convenient toothbrush. Easy to use and charges well. A good buy.</li>
    <li> works great and gives a very clean feeling. Does not cause any gum bleeding like some other high frequency power brushes do.</li>
    <li> This rechargeable toothbrush works great! It feels so refreshing after using this brush compared to a regular toothbrush. Definitely makes me feel like I got a closer brush.</li>
    <li> What can you say it works well for me everytime I use it.  It recharges very quickly and feels good to hold.</li>
    <li> Having read some of the reviews for this brush, and then having used it myself, I can&#x27;t help thinking some people have missed the point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a rechargeable Oral B, for less than $30 you get -&lt;br /&gt;a) It&#x27;s powerful to feel twice as fast as the best named brand that takes AA batteries&lt;br /&gt;b) Small enough to take on your travels with the charging unit&lt;br /&gt;c) Built in timer to let you know that you have brushed for two minutes.&lt;br /&gt;d) Spare heads although not the cheapest are widely available.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So why the criticism??&lt;br /&gt;Comparing this to other Oral B models like the 1000 pro series, or 5000 series is like comparing a Ford Focus to BMW, they BOTH drive, and will get you from point A to point B, one is two or three times the price of the other, for the extra money, you get extra features!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whilst I don&#x27;t like this as much as my Sonic-care, but it&#x27;s a great brush, and for the price worth 4 stars in my opinion.</li>
    <li> One of the better electric toothbrushes out there.  It&#x27;s the closest thing to my dental hygienist that I&#x27;ve gotten when it comes to (1) teeth cleaning/polishing and (2) gum-massaging, topics that all dental personnel regard as important to one&#x27;s dental health!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kudos, Oral-B...a great product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I rate \\&quot;Oral-B Vitality Prowhite Rechargeable Power Toothbrush, Light Blue and White \\&quot;...Five stars!</li>
    <li> I love the Vitality. I do not, however, like the pro white heads that came with the brush. I bought the precision clean heads and love those. They are made to work with the Vitality. This is only packaged and called the Vitality Pro White because it&#x27;s the vitality model with pro white heads... Any heads made for Oral-B will work with this except for the Sonic heads.    This brush is great, although it seems it&#x27;s a bit underpowered. When brushing my back teeth and trying to get behind the tooth the motor isn&#x27;t as powerful as it you were just brushing the front teeth but it&#x27;s fine it still does the job just fine. I leave the brush on the charger when not in use so I can&#x27;t attest to how long the battery lasts. Oral-B says that it will last 20 minutes or about 10 2-minute brushing periods. I personally think that&#x27;s low for a modern electronic toothbrush but I leave it on the charger so I don&#x27;t have to deal with a low battery.    I brush at minimum 3 times a day. Usually more. I contacted my dentist asking if it was bad and she said that it&#x27;s fine and I told her I was using the Vitality and she said that it was no problem, \\&quot;brush as often as you&#x27;d like\\&quot;.. So I&#x27;m not worried about gum recession or ruining my tooth enamel with it.     I moved from a manual brush to the electronic brush and found at first that the vibrating (oscillating?) was making my gums and the tip of my nose tickelish. I&#x27;ve gotten used to it and it doesn&#x27;t seem to affect me like that anymore.     I do drool a lot when brushing and the toothpasty drool goes down the handle on the brush and makes the handle a mess, so I rinse it off half way through and after brushing. The brush is completely waterproof, although I wouldn&#x27;t submerge it...    So all in all I really love this brush and rate it a 5/5. We&#x27;ll see in 6 months how my brushing habits are when I go in for my next cleaning. I try to be very thorough and usually brush at least 3 minutes to make sure I get every nook and cranny so if I have tartar that is an unusual build-up I&#x27;ll modify this review.    I recommend this brush 100%!</li>
    <li> charges quickly and stays that way, teeth look great after only a few uses, narrow head for where wisdom teeth used to be. highly recommend this product</li>
    <li> Powered brushes are shockingly expensive and this is the cheapest Oral-B model.  The brush and plug-in charger are two separate units.  The charger has a small footprint and low profile, with a sealed chassis and contact point, keeping water out.  The brush handle is about the diameter of a broom handle, with a lot of rubber to protect it from water and to keep it from slipping out of your wet hand.  The clicking on-off button is sealed in rubber and the contact point in the handle is also completely sealed.  The only point where water might get in is where the brush meets the handle.  Charging is idiot-proof:  mount the brush (no skill involved) and you&#x27;re ready for next time.  Sealed contacts allow you to rinse or wipe off the handle or charger.  The brush cycle pauses quickly when two minutes have passed and teeth are clean.  The Vitality is durable - it still holds a charge and brushes effectively after over a year.  I replaced the original single brush with [[ASIN:B002BTETG4 Oral-B Dual Clean 6 Replacement Brush Head]] replacements, which are a little larger than original equipment (maybe too large for some?), but a little more effective.  Just don&#x27;t completely immerse either component in water and you&#x27;ll be good to go.  Cheap, simple, unobtrusive, effective - what else could you want?</li>
    <li> Good toothbrush.  Replacing a previous Oral-B that I wore out</li>
    <li> Prior to this I had the \\&quot;professional\\&quot; Braun model. When it broke, I ordered this to replace it hoping it would fit the old charger base and it did. Although it comes with a charger, there is no storage for brush heads. In short, it works very well and I even feel the it cleans better. The tempo of the motor seems to allow the brush to work more efficiently and just feels like a better clean and with noticeably less plaque. Would recommend to a friend.</li>
    <li> I wanted to buy an electric toothbrush after reading about how much better they are than regular toothbrushes. I did not want to spend a fortune, though. This was a perfect option and I&#x27;m very happy with it. At first the head feels extremely small, but I got used to it very quickly and now when I have to use a regular toothbrush it feels enormous. This toothbrush holds a charge very well, you do not have to charge it every night. I have gone on vacations for long weekends without even bringing the charger and it starts to slow down only towards the end. I have never had it completely die on me. When I first got this, I was using it for the full 2 minutes, but I have to admit I have stopped using the timer and now just use it for probably about a minute.</li>
    <li> This is a replacement for my previous Oral-B, so I knew the quality.  It works great, yet is an affordable price.  I am very satisfied with this toothbrush.</li>
    <li> Handle is a bit more streamlined and fits my hand better.  Holds a charge longer than my previous Oral-B Vitality.  Love the brushing/flossing heads than clean better.</li>
    <li> This was recommended by my dentist - it feels like a dental office cleaning every time I use it - great product!</li>
    <li> I have always used Oral-B and have been pleased with it. This offer definitely had the best price without having bells and whistles that aren&#x27;t necessary.</li>
    <li> I bought this to replace the same model that I had before. It does a great job of cleaning my teeth.</li>
    <li> Great price and product.  Works just as well as the expensive ones I tried. Works with heads I had been buying.</li>
    <li> The first time I used it, as the brush whirled around, some movable part of the brush head would occasionally whack adjacent teeth.  It was very unpleasant and I couldn&#x27;t keep it from happening.  I assumed it was defective and sent it back.  I still need a toothbrush, but feel reluctant to try another Oral B.  Maybe another model.</li>
    <li> I like very much.  Makes your teeth tingling clean..I would recommend this to others .  Thank you i am happy with this product</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift for my dad.  It&#x27;s one of those what do you buy for retired people gifts.  Mom said he needed a toothbrush so what the heck.  He said it was great,  he took it on a 6 week trip to Europe.</li>
    <li> I have been using these toothbrushes for several years and they are really good.  I no longer have very much tartar at all and my dentist says keep using them.</li>
    <li> This was a replacement for my ooooold Oral-B (10 years plus).  The Vitality works great.  Holds a charge, has a small footprint on my countertop.  Just what I wanted.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like the polishing heads they come with, other than that it really is a great electric toothbrush for the price.</li>
    <li> I needed a new electric toothbrush because my old one died. And I bought this one &amp; it works very well.</li>
    <li> Not as good as the older version that came before this. Missing a light that tells you when it&#x27;s fully charged.</li>
    <li> this is the best toothbrush I have had since I first got one ten years ago. There is no better combo than Braun and Oral B for oral health. That&#x27;s the truth.</li>
    <li> A toothbrush with a small brush head is what works best in my mouth. I can maneuver the brush on and around each tooth. After a couple days of use it does need to be charged. I like this basic electric toothbrush very much, in fact best. Though I have tried a more expensive and fuller size brush head, this one is my favorite. I hope to always have this one available to me.</li>
    <li> The price isn&#x27;t bad for this, not much more than the spin brush. Replacement tips not too expensive and completely sealed. Good for me  I like the smaller brush, seems to keep the teeth cleaner. Also the sealed design seems to be working good so far for me to keep it in the shower. I charge about once a week.</li>
    <li> Both my husband and I are having no issues with this, holds charge for about a week. Took on vacation without charger and never went dead.</li>
    <li> the oral b toothbrush is wonderful!  The 2 minute warning is a great plus so you can brush the right amount of time.  The brush makes your teeth absolutely clean.  I love the color.  Would highly reccomend this product.</li>
    <li> The Oral-B&#x27;s VITALITY offers decent value but it doesn&#x27;t come close to the &#x27;high end&#x27; performance and convenience offered (at a higher price) by rival products such as Sonicare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, for the GOOD qualities:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Rechargeable - I view this as a &#x27;bottom line&#x27; feature when it comes to electric toothbrushes and VITALITY has it.&lt;br /&gt;- Water-proof - the body appears to be fully sealed. Like Sonicare, this model is using the &#x27;proximity&#x27; charge method where you place the toothbrush&#x27;s body on the base and charging takes place when the base is plugged into an electric outlet.&lt;br /&gt;- Extra brush - this model comes with 2 brushes, one mounted on the body and one extra.&lt;br /&gt;- Easy brush replacement - you simply pull the mounted brush to take it out, push the new one in.&lt;br /&gt;- $3 coupon to be used when purchasing replacement brush heads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not so good or annoying:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- The packaging is atrocious. It comes in one of those bullet-proof clear plastic enclosures that you must cut with scissors and make sure you don&#x27;t cut yourself in the sharp edges while at it. It took me several minutes to extract the contents off packaging and I did manage to do it scratch-free.&lt;br /&gt;- Vibrations are a little too strong - this MIGHT be my Sonicare bias (which I&#x27;ve been using for longer than I can remember) but I felt that this VITALITY was a little too aggressive. My teeth are a little bit sensitive and they didn&#x27;t like that.&lt;br /&gt;- A little too noisy for what I am used to - of course, an &#x27;ultrasonic&#x27; toothbrush noise is harder to detect because... it&#x27;s ultrasound.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When compared to the higher-end products, it may be worth noting that the VITALITY does not come with a &#x27;full&#x27; timer. The toothbrush does tell you when the 2 minutes are up (noise similar to revving an engine) but it does not turn itself off and, more importantly, it does not give you 30-second signals so you can switch &#x27;quadrants&#x27; as the higher end products do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The VITALITY offers a lot for the price but I am not sure that &#x27;price&#x27; is THAT meaningful when the topic is our teeth. It&#x27;s probably preferable to most manual toothbrushes but, for a few dollars more you can get a lot better. Overall this is a decent product but if I had to replace my higher end toothbrush today, knowing what I know after trying out this product I would NOT go for the VITALITY and sacrifice features and convenience. The few dollars saved would not justify it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Three stars, meaning \\&quot;It&#x27;s Okay\\&quot; seem to be the fair rating on the Amazon scale.ers a lot for the price but I am not sure that &#x27;price&#x27; is THAT meaningful when the topic is our teeth.

    <li> I&#x27;ve had an electric toothbrush before...actually this same model...so I knew what to expect. However I was quite surprised by the new brush head. I love the polishing effect from the center \\&quot;buffer\\&quot; head. It truly makes me feel like I&#x27;ve just left the dentist&#x27;s chair. I also love, love, love the timer that let&#x27;s you know when you&#x27;ve been brushing for two minutes. It always amazes me how much longer 2 minutes is than what I expected it to be! Definitely worth the money for me to have a fresh feeling mouth to start out and end the day!</li>
    <li> I own another Braun electric toothbrush, one of their \\&quot;Professional Care\\&quot; line, and this is what I&#x27;m mainly comparing this toothbrush against.    First visible difference : this toothbrush has NiCd batteries instead of NiMH for the other one. It doesn&#x27;t last as long between charges (approximately 1/2 as long, 5 days instead of 10 days), and you&#x27;ll need to be careful about letting it discharge once in a while because of the memory effect of NiCd batteries.    It also lacks a lot of the frills of the other toothbrush. No LED light to indicating charging / charge full, and it does not pulse at 30 second intervals when brushing. It does pulse at the end of 2 minutes though.    The brushing action is also different from the \\&quot;Professional Care\\&quot; toothbrush. The brushing action feels weaker, though I must admit the teeth feels just as clean afterwards. I tried the same toothbrush head on them - they appear to be interchangeable. I&#x27;ve also tried the original toothbrush head. I can&#x27;t judge effectiveness (they appear to all clean well) but the one that came with the \\&quot;Professional Care\\&quot; toothbrush feels more comfortable to me - better contact with the teeth.    This toothbrush is significantly lighter, but otherwise the construction looks to be about the same level as the other one.    I&#x27;m giving it 4 stars despite the shortcomings because it is significantly cheaper than the other toothbrush. I think they balance each other out (I&#x27;d rate my existing toothbrush 4 stars as well).    For me at least, an electric toothbrush cleans teeth much better than manual brushing and although I&#x27;m definitely not a dentist, I recommend them.</li>
    <li> The Oral-B Vitality Prowhite toothbrush is better than a manual toothbrush and it does clean your teeth well - but loudly and a little aggressively.  The goal with an electric toothbrush is to spend 2 minutes brushing.  There are some feature sets missing (30 second indicators to switch areas of brushing amongst the 4 \\&quot;quadrants\\&quot; of your mouth).  It does tell you when the two minutes are up but it does not shut off.  It has a rechargeable battery (charges by sitting in the base, which is plugged in).  I like this toothbrush fairly well and will continue to use it, but if money is not a factor I would recommend spending a little more money up front.  Shop around and also consider the price of replacement heads in your purchase price.  Here are some other toothbrushes to compare to:  [[ASIN:B003QYFVRY Philips Sonicare Essence Power Toothbrush]] and [[ASIN:B001CX4JSS Oral-B Pulsonic Sonic Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush]]</li>
    <li> Considering the price of this powered toothbrush, it seems to be an effective option if you are dying to have a powered toothbrush.  However, compared to something like the more expensive Sonicare Elite, this doesn&#x27;t come close to the cleaning ability.  So, in my opinion, why pay the extra money for a powered toothbrush when the old faithful standard toothbrush seems to do just fine?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros&lt;br /&gt;- Rechargeable (ultimately this is the best feature)&lt;br /&gt;- Has good power and the battery seemed to last about 5 days with regular use&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;- Does not leave me feeling any cleaner than a standard toothbrush (A Sonicare does)&lt;br /&gt;- Does not feel anymore gentle on my sensitive gums than a standard (A Sonicare does)&lt;br /&gt;- The head feels a bit akward in my mouth (it&#x27;s not large, but as it rotates it feels more like its in the way)&lt;br /&gt;- Sound of the rotating head is a bit loud</li>
    <li> This toothbrush definitely leaves my teeth feeling cleaner than using a &amp;#34;regular&amp;#34; toothbrush.  This is the second one I have owned.  The first one lasted many years before it finally stopped holding a charge.  Very good quality for the price.</li>
    <li> Back in college, I had a roommate who bought an electric toothbrush.  It ran on batteries (non-rechargeable).  I was using a manual toothbrush at the time.  I watched him use it that year and thought it was the silliest thing I&#x27;d ever seen or heard of in my life.  &amp;#34;The epitome of laziness,&amp;#34; I thought, &amp;#34;you stick it in your mouth and let it do the work for you.  Pfft.&amp;#34;  That was my attitude and was mostly due to the fact that he was changing the batteries every week or two - he spent more on batteries in one year than I&#x27;ve spent on manual toothbrushes in my whole life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fast forward to about four years ago.  I was at my dentist&#x27;s office and my dentist commented on how fast my gum line was receding.  He was also giving me the usual lecture about gum disease because he noticed that I wasn&#x27;t brushing very well, flossing regularly, you know, the usual.  He then asked me if I was using a manual or automatic toothbrush.  I said &amp;#34;manual&amp;#34;, of course, because I didn&#x27;t want anything to do with automatic toothbrushes.  Interestingly, the dentist didn&#x27;t say anything beyond that question, but it was clearly implied that I should go get an automatic toothbrush.  So, off I went to Amazon and hunted around for a while.  I eventually settled on the cheapest thing I could find:  An Oral-B Vitality for about $30 (an older model of this one).  It got my teeth cleaner than my manual brushes ever did in less time and my dentist has noticed the change too and I don&#x27;t get that lecture on gum disease any more!  Let&#x27;s just say this has saved my gum line from further damage, removes plaque that manual brushes can&#x27;t, and has a two minute timer to prevent both under- and over-brushing.  The only problem is that the battery gets weak and my previous unit died after 3 1/2 years, hence the recent purchase of this newer model.  But that&#x27;s going to happen with more expensive rechargeable models too, so why throw away money?  All you need is a motor and some gears attached to a brush head and a timer, which is exactly what this is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This latest model of the Vitality is better than the previous model I was using.  The brush head with the round rubber thing in the middle keeps the user from pressing down too hard, which is a brilliant little modification.  Those complaining about this not having enough features, you are being silly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you use a manual toothbrush, you are being foolish, just as I was.  Plus, this is only about $30, which is a fraction of the cost of major dental work to fix the problems caused by manual brushing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only step up from this model that I can think of that I&#x27;d be willing to buy is a nanotechnology-based solution (a cup of nanites, swish for a couple of minutes, spit back into cup, place cup back on charging station, nanites deposit plaque and food particles into collection tray).</li>
    <li> I ordered this to replace my more expensive Oral B product that broke.  I am happy with this purchase and it works just as well as my $80 original Oral B Electric Toothbrush with casing.</li>
    <li> Excellent product! It is worth the price. It lasts for a very long time. I would definitely recommend it to all.</li>
    <li> Toothbrush Amazon sent is different color and packaging and is not named Vitality.  Typical Amazon switch.  It&#x27;s a very slow toothbrush compared to other Oral B electric toothbrushes I&#x27;ve owned.  Not sure if an actual Vitality would be better.  I will buy one elsewhere to see.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used several electronic toothbrushes, this is the best one I&#x27;ve owned. Works great, love the 2 minute timer, have no complaints. Seems very sturdy and well made, not cheap.</li>
    <li> I just wrote a review on the over-priced brush heads that need to be replaced.&lt;br /&gt;I saw where someone wrote that it is cheaper to just by a new brush again rather that buy the over-priced brush heads.&lt;br /&gt;Whether that is true or not I will have to comparison shop.&lt;br /&gt;It does an excellent job and at my last check up 2 weeks ago I had no plaque on my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;The brush handle will vibrate after 2 minutes to let you know you have brushed long enough.&lt;br /&gt;I am going to try and change the brush head every 4 months instead of 3, and see how that works out.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this brush - just wish Oral-B didn&#x27;t charge so much for the replacement heads.</li>
    <li> The whole family loves this toothbrush.  It works forever, the batteries easily make it for a week without charging while on a trip, and we all love the bzz-bzz notifier that lets you know when you can be done brushing.</li>
    <li> This item replaces my old one which finally faded away after years of excellent service.  In every way - size, performance, cost - the new one meets and in some ways exceeds my expectations, which I based on the prior model.  And the old model&#x27;s brushes - of which I still have a few - fit it.  I fully recommend this toothbrush, without reservation.</li>
    <li> Excellent product; received relatively quickly as per instructions I had sent to distributor. Timer is very helpful because of dental needs of user</li>
    <li> I purchased this since our more expensive Oral-B electric toothbrush died (after 4-5 years). This is a great value, especially since it includes 2 toothbrush heads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t have the bells and whistles of the more expensive models, but I never used those. I can&#x27;t remember the last time I used the Smart Guide. The base to more expensive models is bulky, and can hold 4 or 5 toothbrush heads, and collects gunk at the bottom. Kind of disgusting, if you ask me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would be nice to have a change in pulsation at the halfway point of the built-in timer...but I don&#x27;t really care about that, either. I always brush longer than 2 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I like:&lt;br /&gt;Light&lt;br /&gt;Small footprint&lt;br /&gt;Has a timer&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What could improve it:&lt;br /&gt;Change in pulse to mark halfway point&lt;br /&gt;Battery strength indication (even if it&#x27;s just a green/yellow/red LED)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Those improvements would cost Oral-B little/nothing and they could charge $10 more...but they know where they make money - toothbrush heads! I would definitely recommend this toothbrush.</li>
    <li> I need to recharge this Toothbrush after every 5 days which is very painful. I can not recommend this product to any one.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Works very well and does a great job of brushing my teeth. I would recommed it as my dentist does..</li>
    <li> Very nice product for teeth, it is powerful, each time recharged, it can be used for 1week. Automatically stop for second after two minutes brushing.</li>
    <li> Our old Vitality finally died after a few years of hard use. New one does the job. Increased power made the wife very happy. Well worth the price.</li>
    <li> There are advantages of this kind of toothbrushes over regular ones: they perform gum massage and clean teeth. No gum problems since using it.</li>
    <li> This was the second one I bought within 6 month. I liked mine so much that I bought the same for my son. Powerfull, only needs charging about every two weeks. Nice feature is the two minute brush time signal.</li>
    <li> Hubby and i use this. It works really well. My teeth feels clean after. I love how i can get in to every corner of my teeth.</li>
    <li> Seems to work well, new brush heads are nice.  My last Oral-B brush (similar to this one) lasted for over ten years, but became sporadic in charging recently.  When this arrived the old one started working great again (it figures), but I put it away to use the new one.  If this one gets ten years plus use; then it will deserve a five star rating.  Use both an Oral-B and Philips Sonicare and like both, but prefer the Oral-B for feeling like teeth are cleaned better between the teeth.</li>
    <li> It works great and arrived on time.  I just wish that I ordered this years ago! It makes brushing your teeth is a fun thing to do &amp; it makes my teeth feel cleaner.</li>
    <li> Replaced my last one with the same type when the battery died.  Works well, dentist says I have less plaque than with a manual toothbrush.  No bells or whistles but decent for the price.</li>
    <li> I got one as a gift, and loved it so much, I got two for my older children. Both rave about them. Great product.</li>
    <li> This is the cadillac of electric toothbrushes!!  I had one fro 3 years prior to this on-bought it as the other quit working.  Much more powerful and works well on my gums!</li>
    <li> It seems to clean very good and it started making my teeth whiter,and once you get used to it ,its very easy to use.</li>
    <li> It works great.  It lasts a long time between charges and gets my teeth very clean.  The price was great!</li>
    <li> I had a more expensive Oral-B that finally wore out.  I got this one and even though it does not jump through hoops like the old one did, I am very satisfied with it.  My gums are very sensitive, and the round brush works better than one of the other brands that have a up and down motion,</li>
    <li> This is my first spin toothbrush. I have used the cheap &#x27;vibrating&#x27; ones but I haven&#x27;t used a spinning one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the absolute best toothbrush I have ever used!! I am so insanely happy with the results. I liked to think that my oral health was really good. I brushed twice a day and I flossed but no matter what I did, I had swollen and red gums right by my canine tooth. I was sure that it was irritation from flossing so much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Three days ago I bought this toothbrush because it was on sale at Wal-Mart. I put it onto the swollen and red area and immediately my gums there started bleeding heavily. Each day I have done that 2-3 times a day, as well as flossing and using mouthwash, and the irritation is completely gone. It is completely healed. I know believe that I had a touch of gingivitis (embarrassing!!!) right there and this toothbrush healed it. It doesn&#x27;t even hurt anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am so happy with this product. Very rarely do I review products that I bought at a store but I am so happy with this toothbrush, I had to share.</li>
    <li> I bought this after the Triumph Professional series model I had owned for about three years stopped holding a charge. It&#x27;s good, for a reasonable price.</li>
    <li> Read lots of reviews and have had many electric brushes over the years.  For the price, this is definitely worth it.  It may not have all the bells and whistles as others, but it does the job it is supposed to do.  Great product!</li>
    <li> Works well.  It is an electric tooth brush that does the job.  Bought it for my 5 year old and it works..</li>
    <li> Very powerful toothbrush.  Works well as long as you are gentle with it in your mouth.  If you press the brush against your teeth with a lot of force, you will end up hurting yourself.</li>
    <li> I had one of these bad boys for about six years before it finally died. Not bad for a $20-ish dollar investment. Cleans way better than a manual and is really easy to use. Get one of these.</li>
    <li> I use this product to brush my teeth and it is very good.  It seem to have more power then my old one.  But I don&#x27;t like the brushes that came with it. They are too harsh.  I would like to have little softer brushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;George Muszynski</li>
    <li> I never give negative feedback but this one product especially provided from Oral-B is a wast of money, the reason is charger does not work nor there is any adapter that shows connection between toothbrush and charger, couldn&#x27;t even return it.</li>
    <li> My teeth feel cleaner.  Good toothbrush for the price.  If you spring for a more expensive toothbrush result are better but this is really good for the money.</li>
    <li> When it was time to replace my toothbrush I did not want bells and whistles; this one is just what I wanted.</li>
    <li> I find this brush too lightweight for me but adequate for children.  Be aware that Oral B batteries cannot be replaced so you will need to discard this item in 1-2 years.</li>
    <li> I purchased my first (and only) Oral B electric toothbrush almost 15 years ago.  It still works, and I can still get the replacement heads.  I purchased this one for my husband after much teasing about how I never have cavities, and he had one in the last year.  Highly recommend, your teeth and gums will thank you for it (and your hygenist!)</li>
    <li> This product met my expectations. The only problem was the first shipment didn&#x27;t work so had to return for a replacement.&lt;br /&gt;Replacement works fine.  However there is only one speed which was a disappointment to my husband who I purchased it for.&lt;br /&gt;Other was okay.</li>
    <li> My dental hygienist recommended this model  as an effective no bells and whistles toothbrush to control plaque buildup and reduce teeth staining from coffee and tea. Topics people don&#x27;t really want to discuss. This  toothbrush is very effective ,inexpensive and an excellent  improvement over manual brushing.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift as I own the Oral-B Vitality Sonic by Braun, type: 3737 and find it the quietest of all the electric toothbrushes I own (4-5 models). I was quite disappointed.  I do not understand why they have to be as loud as they are. Not the nicest thing to do to one&#x27;s self just prior to going to bed. I felt badly once I heard it, having promised something quieter.</li>
    <li> Does everything an electric toothbrush is supposed to do.  What more is there to say about this product!  End of story.</li>
    <li> Power of hand held machine was sufficient&lt;br /&gt;Fits comfortable in hand to hold and not to big for mouth&lt;br /&gt;Did not take up much room on counter in bathroom</li>
    <li> IT IS FAST AND STRONG. GETS MY TEETH AND GUMS TO FEEL REALLY CLEAN. CARRIES A STRONG CHARGE THROUGH THE WEEKLY CYCLE REQUIREMENTS.</li>
    <li> This is my fourth Braun Oral B electric toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have had several entry level models over the years, replacing each of them when the internal battery had reached the end of its working life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My dentist recommended that I use an electric toothbrush, and this entry level model has proven to be entirely satisfactory.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The principal features are:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. It uses replaceable brush heads. It fits a variety of the brush heads which Oral B offers, but you should ensure that you do not buy one of the heads which don&#x27;t fit this model! Also, there are several generic substitute brush heads available.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. It is powered by a non-replaceable rechargeable battery, which is sealed inside the handle. You charge the toothbrush by placing the handle on a compact bench top charger. Charging is by induction, do there are no metal contacts to corrode.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3. The charger requires a 110V power source for US market models. This does restrict its usage when you are travelling overseas, where the mains power source is 220-240V. If you are a significant traveler, I recommend you consider one of the more expensive models which have dual power source compatibility.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4. A charge will last about a week before needing a recharge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5. The handle incorporates a 2 minute timer: this works by vibrating briefly when the toothbrush has been operated for two minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6. The brush heads- depending on type, and how you brush- last about 2-3 months. Some Oral B brushes incorporate a wear indicator, to help you to ascertain when replacement is necessary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;7. In my experience, these  toothbrushes will last about 2-3 years before requiring replacement. The packaging includes information regarding safe disposal and recycling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are more expensive electric toothbrushes available, which do have additional functional attributes and accessories. For some people, these may be necessary or worthwhile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I suspect most people would find this entry level model to suit their requirements./&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I suspect most people would find this entry level model to suit their requirements.</li>
    <li> I love the rechargeable aspect!  My first set--charger stand and wand/tip--lasted 10 years.  It just quit, and I needed a new one.  Unfortunately, the charger stand isn&#x27;t interchangeable (one&#x27;s insert is round, one&#x27;s horseshoe-shaped), but the tips are.  I just wish it came in green like the original!</li>
    <li> this was a replacment for my previous one which had stopped working after 5 years. Works as good as  the previoyus one did.</li>
    <li> Works great, I like it much better than my manual toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;I feel like I just left the dentist every time I use it.</li>
    <li> This is my second Oral-B Vitality. Quality of this one is lower compare to previous brush. It&#x27;s base has bigger insert for placement on the charger. Toothbrush feels loose when you set it down on the charger. Sometimes it&#x27;s not even creating enough contact for battery to receive a normal charge. When it&#x27;s charged well though, I have no complaints about the brush. Will still recommend it.</li>
    <li> This was a very good product at a reasonable price.  I have seen this priced way higher at Target.  Other reviewers have complained about the product not being what was pictured or of it dying quickly.  I&#x27;ve had this product for 2 weeks now and I have not had any of these problems...so far.</li>
    <li> this is my third one of these - but, it has taken about 12yrs to go through them - I think they are great and do a better job than the sonic types</li>
    <li> My 7 year old uses this and it works well to keep him brushing for 2 minutes. He likes using it as well.</li>
    <li> Just replacing an old one which was well used and dearly loved. It does a great job of cleaning one&#x27;s teeth.The old one lasted for years and I hope this one will too. It came with a replacement head as well. Great value for the price.</li>
    <li> This is our second one.  Our first lasted at least ten years and was just an Oral B without the Braun logo.  It always did a superb job of cleaning teeth and exercising gums, and never was really unattractive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This new one is a real winner.  Subtle changes in the base and major changes in the brush head and even more subtle changes in the handle only improve the good functional looks.  I think that the motor may be more powerful, but probably only because it is new.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is no reason whatsoever to spend a nickel more and a few reasons to not try to buy a less costly brush.  I also like the way that it keeps the gumline healthy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy it with confidence, use it properly, and see your dentist once or twice a year, and you will never take your teeth out at night.</li>
    <li> I really like it, the only thing is it doesn&#x27;t have a light signifying it&#x27;s being charged. The price is low.</li>
    <li> Bought this after dentist recommended wife get a rotating toothbrush.  Keeps it&#x27;s charge and works like a charm, even the two minute signal.</li>
    <li> Works great, by far the best toothbrush I have ever owned, you have to stay on top of cleaning it it can tend to get dirty pretty quick so u have to make sure u properly rinse them both off after every use</li>
    <li> Have used Oral B rechargeable for 20 years?&lt;br /&gt;This one arrived damaged.  I can&#x27;t get it to charge, either on the new stand or an old base.  Tried the old brush on the new charger and worked fine.  It is just the hand held part.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The packaging is the type where you have to cut the clear plastic and in the process, the sharp edges cut your hands!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will order another hand part but I bet I have to order another base at the same time.&lt;br /&gt;Update:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The handheld brush is working now.</li>
    <li> The purchase of this product has proven to be great for cleaning my teeth. I have had other electric tooth brushes but none had the speed effectiveness that this Oral-B Vitality Prowhite Rechargable Electric Toothbrush has. I would recommend it to all who are thinking about purchasing it.</li>
    <li> My old Oral-B Vitality pooped out after several years.  I like the fact I was able to find what I wanted to replace it and especially like the 2 minute timer on the brush.</li>
    <li> Purchaed in Jamuary. Loved the battery staying power and the brush effectiveness then five months later it died! Cannot tell if it is the charger or the brush.</li>
    <li> Lots of power, a bit larger than other electrics but not a problem. Feels great on the teeth and gums. Price is more than right.</li>
    <li> I love the way this toothbrush cleans, and how easy it is to use, too.  The hardest part to get used to was going over each tooth, and not using the habitual &amp;#34;scrubbing&amp;#34; motion.  I feel like I&#x27;ve been to the dental hygienist each time I brush!  The price was excellent, too.</li>
    <li> I bought this after using 2 Target knock off&#x27;s that broke in record time.  Not sure why I bought the second one!  The Oral-B is great.  I really like the little yellow rubbery polishing thingy (technical term) in the middle of the brush head.  It makes my teeth feel very clean, as if I just came from a dental cleaning.</li>
    <li> It works great, much better than the one I had to return to Overstock.com.  I recommend it from Amazon, where it is available for a third of the price.</li>
    <li> Works great. Replacement heads are not too expensive.</li>
    <li> I feel like I just left the dentist. It really help clean my teeth all around. Hopefully the battery last a year.</li>
    <li> Rec&#x27;d toothbrush ,works very good and owned another but it began obsolete so it was time to purchase another but finds that brushe heads will fit the Vitality</li>
    <li> took it out of pkg - charged according to instructions - quit after 30 seconds and  never worked again.  Returned to mfg.</li>
    <li> This brand/type was recommended by my dental hygienist, and while I put off switching to an electric brush, I finally purchased this one due to gum deterioration from scrubbing with a regular brush. While it took awhile to get used to a rotating, electric machine, I soon began to love how clean my mouth felt (and was) and the gentleness on my gums. Instead of scrubbing to ensure cleanliness, I just let this rotating brush head glide over each tooth. It gets between tightly crowded areas, and keeps my gums healthy. Once I stopped splattering toothpaste all over the walls, and drooling on myself, I was able to appreciate the thoroughness and gentle cleansing of this electric method. I should have bought one years ago!</li>
    <li> purchased this after our old vitality toothbrush broke after using it for nearly 4 years.  We figured we would stick with the oral B brand since it seems to last quite awhile and it is reasonably priced.</li>
    <li> You can pay over $100 for an electric toothbrush, but these are the same thing. These seem to last 3-5 years and I&#x27;m sure some have lasted even longer. My wife and I are both on are second ones and we still have payed less than it would cost for a Sonicare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How well do they clean? Well, my wife and I have not had a cavity since we&#x27;ve used these and our dentist is always impressed with our teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing you need to make sure of is buying genuine oral-b replacement heads. You can get them fairly cheap on ebay. Don&#x27;t settle for the other ones as they don&#x27;t last as long and can fall apart.  Also I&#x27;m not a big fan of the toothbrush head that came with this one as it has a rubber center that is supposed to simulate the dentist&#x27;s cleaning tool. I prefer the simple and small circular head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for a good electric toothbrush, the Vitality is a great buy.</li>
    <li> 10 in the 1 to 10 scale.</li>
    <li> i bought a pair of these for Festivus last year, for my husband and I to use.  They have been great.  Long lasting battery, timer, and easy clean up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Downsides: My husband went through his bristles pretty hard, so replacement after 6 months.  Mine lasted the year.  it also got a little messy, especially for his, as he didn&#x27;t rinse thoroughly enough.</li>
    <li> Reasonable price for a electric tooth brush. Works great. My teeth feel cleaner and no effort brushing. Its also water proof and i use mine while in the shower</li>
    <li> I could tell the difference in 2 days and I smoke and drink 2-3 POTs of coffee a day !&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried a store brand and it pinched your lip while brushing. I like the timer on this one and the new sleek look.</li>
    <li> well pleased with what it offers oral b I use it daily and have not had any problems I always recommend replacements original brand product</li>
    <li> Great product!!!  The charging base is small and very portable; a prior rechargeable toothbrush that I had has a much larger base and also works with batteries.  However the batteries are a real pain to replace.  SOOOO I was just delighted to get this model.  Now I can just take the charger with me and need not worry about trying to replace the batteries in the other one.</li>
    <li> This is my first electric tooth brush and it is still working after 3 and half years of use. The battery holds the charge very well.</li>
    <li> This is my second Oral B rechargeable.  I like that it has a small profile and that its a powerful and thorough cleaner.  One of the best features is that you can change out heads using a deep cleaner head followed by a polishing head.  My first Oral B lasted about ten years.</li>
    <li> For the cheap price it works just fine---nothing special or deluxe but with the rebate--paid $17 good deal for a replacement for my son&#x27;s old one</li>
    <li> I first purchased an Oral B 3000 but found that it wouldn&#x27;t stay charged at all. I then purchased an Oral B Vitality toothbrush thru Amazon and have really liked it except I couldn&#x27;t use the &amp;#34;flossing&amp;#34; heads, they were too rough. I ordered the Sensitive heads and have used them for several weeks and they are perfect. I would highly recommend this unit (with the sensitive heads). Papa John</li>
    <li> This was my first power toothbrush. It works great. After brushing with this brush, you will never want to go back to the old one. I recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> My son has had this toothbrush since he was a sophmore in high school.  He is now a Junior in college.  Change the heads and keep it charged, never had one problem.  And never had a cavity!!!</li>
    <li> Makes me brush longer than with manual toothbrush and my teeth feel cleaner. Won&#x27;t know how good until after my next dentist visit.</li>
    <li> I love this toothbrush. It was recommended to me by a dentist. Love using it, the 2 min warning is also great and helps brush my teeth for just the right amount of time!</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product for the price, just wish something could be done with the power pack.  The length of the cord is long which pull the power easily off the sink.  Otherwise this is a great deal.</li>
    <li> Stays charged for over a week.  Works well, my dentist recommended this specific one. I most definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> excellent battery tooth brush</li>
    <li> This piece of crap died on me in 4 months and when I tried to contact Amazon, the message said I will be prorated and I will have to pay shipping for the item and I will not get the previous shipment money, and then there was not even an option to complaint for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product should have one year warranty, that&#x27;s why online shopping SUCKS, specially company like Amazon does not even offer proper options to contact them..</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t express how durable these brushes always are. Great battery life, and awesome brushing power!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy it if you want the best bang for your buck!</li>
    <li> The brushes failed several times. Fell off and I couldn&#x27;t reattach. Gets dirty easily and is difficult to clean, both the handle and the receptacle.</li>
    <li> Changed my brushing experience. Great deal and a great product. Probably outfitting my whole family when the next holiday comes around.</li>
    <li> It only lasted a couple days before the motor simply would not turn on any more. I used it as instructed. While it WAS working I liked the toothbrush alot. Made my teeth feel really clean. Just wish it had lasted longer.</li>
    <li> Good product....if gets the job done!  Good purchase for the price. Dentist clean feeling and two minute varied vibration is good.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using one like this since about 2007.  My dentist has been complimenting how clean my teeth are twice a year since then.  My visits are usually quick and painless. This year, the battery on my old one finally stopped performing.  Guess what? Just bought a new one of these on Amazon.com. Here&#x27;s to another 6 years of clean teeth.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t really expect much buying this super cheap electric toothbrush, but it really does the job very well. No problems so far.</li>
    <li> Very happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used manual (mostly Oral B) hand toothbrushes all of my life. But I&#x27;ve always wanted to try an electric toothbrush. So when Amazon offered the Vitality Prowhite Recharable, I jumped at the chance to try it out.    All-in-all, I am satisfied. It takes a gentle touch and care not to put too pressure on the teeth (and not to shoot toothpaste flying all over the bathroom! But I like the product and plan to continue using it daily.</li>
    <li> I got this Electric toothbrush to replace my Conair Oral B one.  The difference is like night and day.  The Braun Vitality ProWhite brush leaves teeth feeling so much cleaner.  I think it is the dental office type cap on the brush.  It feels the same why it does when a hygenist is applying flouride in the Dentist&#x27;s office.  The power settings are just right and it is very gentle of the teeth and gums while being hard on plaque.    The set is compact and doesn&#x27;t take up too much space on the bathroom sink.  The base is a bit wider than that on the Conair brand so it doesn&#x27;t topple over as easily.  The brush is easy to put on and easy to remove.  A replacement brush is included in the package.    I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This is my first electric toothbrush.  It took a few times to get the hang of it, but have used it for over a year now and feel my gums are healthier.</li>
    <li> My dentist recommended that I purchase an electric toothbrush and as a poor graduate student, I liked the price and reviews of this toothbrush the best.  I couldn&#x27;t be happier with this product.  My teeth and mouth feel so much cleaner than when I used a regular toothbrush.  I also enjoy the pulse when the 2 minute period passes while brushing.  The brush head is a little small, which I don&#x27;t enjoy when cleaning my tongue, but overall very happy.</li>
    <li> This is my first rechargeable toothbrush. I thought about getting a fancier, $99 one but figured I could start with a cheaper model and upgrade if I wanted. I think I&#x27;ll just stick with this one. It does everything I really need from an electric toothbrush, which is make my teeth feel really clean. I also definitely notice my teeth are whiter and brighter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a 2-minute timer to let you know when you&#x27;ve brushed the recommended time. I thought I wanted the fancier quadrant timer, but after using this toothbrush, I realize I really don&#x27;t need that much instruction on how to brush my teeth. It&#x27;s a great toothbrush that&#x27;s easy to use and totally worth the money.</li>
    <li> Got this for My 12 year old son so he can brush his teeth better this helps him get all the gunk out .... Very pleased</li>
    <li> Gets teeth extremely white and clean. Removes plaque and makes my mouth fresher for hours. Use religiously. Makes teeth feel dentist clean.</li>
    <li> This is such an upgrade from previous tooth brush. It removes more gunk and gently scrubs away stains (with the right tooth paste) for a brighter, healthier smile. It&#x27;s travel safe and comes with an extra head and doesn&#x27;t take up counter space either!</li>
    <li> This is the second Vitality electric toothbrush I&#x27;ve had, the first one lasted about 10 years!  Well worth the money!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll update if things change. Right now I&#x27;m a little against this because my gums started to hurt. I&#x27;ll read the instructions in better detail and see if it&#x27;s operator error or something else.</li>
    <li> Nicely cleans the teeth..Would recommend for others too..Good with the price..not too expensive.. must have..&lt;br /&gt;Brushes are engineered very well..</li>
    <li> Head of toothbrush looks like it is for baby teeth, but it&#x27;s a good value and gets the job done. Comes with one replacement head.</li>
    <li> I bought this model after my Oral B handle of over 10 years quit working. It has way more power than I expected and I love the compact design. The price point is right on, too.</li>
    <li> Great toothbrush! The Oral-B Vitality Prowhite Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush 1 Count makes my teeth feel nice and clean. Great Price!</li>
    <li> been using it for 2 weeks. so far no problems. good value. small, doesn&#x27;t take up loss of room. would recommend.</li>
    <li> This is my second brush and it is pretty decent. Fair price for a fair brush.If you are lazy this should be for you.</li>
    <li> The old toothbrush I had was losing power even after  being recharged. The new toothbrush works fine. It provides the power needed for good brushing.</li>
    <li> This toothbrush wasn&#x27;t my favorite. The rotation of the brush-head was very uncomfortable. It also retained a lot of water in the base even after brushing. The base is very big and weird. Not the best purchase.</li>
    <li> My dentist recommended an electric toothbrush, and said this was a good one to buy if you didn&#x27;t want to spend much money. I wish I&#x27;d spent the extra money! (And in fact, I just ordered a Sonicare to replace this, just a couple of weeks after buying this one.) The brushing is incredibly harsh, and makes my gums painful and bleeding. I compared to my roommate&#x27;s Sonicare, which has a much softer brush, and gentler brushing--it gets its work done through more of a sonic vibration than an aggressive buffing. Additionally, I looked up peer reviewed journal articles on effectiveness, and while both types of brush improve dental health, the Sonicare does significantly more so. ([...]) So, I regret my choice, and am going for the competitor. If you want the most effective and pleasant experience in brushing, in my opinion, this ain&#x27;t it.</li>
    <li> haven&#x27;t owned electric before. this is great. its much more effective than manual brush. sorry I didn&#x27;t switch years ago. thanks.</li>
    <li> Have used this brand for years. They have never failed, never broken, still holds a charge. This is for another member of the family.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Strong and powerful. I like the compact charger. Suitable for 1 person, but for more than one would get the charger with the compartment for holding brush heads.</li>
    <li> Love this electric toothbrush, I&#x27;ve had mine for years with no problem.  Just replace the heads every 3 months and I&#x27;m good to go.  I just bought two more for my mom and my son in the military.  I&#x27;ll never go back to a regular toothbrush again.</li>
    <li> Nice tooth brush but it feels flimsy. But the price was right!&lt;br /&gt;Wish it had a cover for the toothbrush..</li>
    <li> I switched from the more expensive electric models to this one after advice from dental hygenist in 2004. These Oral-Bs seem to last me about 4 years before they stop being able to recharge sufficiently. This latest model seems even more powerful than my last one. Warning to those with sensitive teeth/gums: my brush came with a special head installed for whitening. It has a yellow cup in the center. Don&#x27;t even think of brushing with this head, as the yellow cup will hurt your gums something fierce. Pop in a regular head and you&#x27;ll be fine.</li>
    <li> Great brush head included. Takes up very little counter space. I wouldn&#x27;t know what it is a $200 electric toothbrush can do that this one won&#x27;t? Teeth feels so much cleaner than with a regular toothbrush!</li>
    <li> My hygienist recommended this over the Sonicare I had been using for years.  Much better results with this one at a much better price</li>
    <li> This version only has one head where previously there were two heads.  I think one electric head is better than none I wish I had purchased a version that has two heads.  I bought this one to replace an older version that suddenly stopped working after constant use over 5 years time.</li>
    <li> The charging base is a little unusual because there are no visible charging contacts, nor a light to indicate charging status or progress.  To be on the safe side, I charged it for the full 16-hr recommended charge time before initial use.  It comes with two identical interchangeable brush heads.  I plan to have my two young children use the brush, however, the brushes are identical, with no markings to distinguish them, so I marked one brush at the base with a permanent marker to indicate the difference.  The brushing action is robust and does a good job of scrubbing tooth surfaces.  There is no need for additional pressure or manual brush strokes.  The brush has a built-in timer and makes a stuttering sound after you have brushed for two minutes.  My kids enjoy the brush and don&#x27;t find it overly harsh or difficult to use.  I was quite pleased with the results and feel it does a better job than relying on them to properly use the manual brush.  The two-minute timer also makes sure they brush for a sufficient duration.  We&#x27;re approaching two weeks of use without a recharge.  That&#x27;s pretty good battery life, considering it&#x27;s used twice a day by two people.  So it&#x27;s a pretty good brush, especially if you have kids or don&#x27;t want to spend a fortune on one of the fancier more expensive power toothbrushes.</li>
    <li> I had been using an oral-b electric toothbrush, but this new brush and polishing style of head are a revelation. The body of the toothbrush is lightweight, it tells me when it&#x27;s time to stop brushing, and the polishing head REALLY gets those black tea stains off my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The polishing head might be a little too vigorous, because it actually hurt my gums in one area where I brushed too hard. But if you&#x27;re careful, this is a great toothbrush head on a fantastic toothbrush. I&#x27;m definitely seeing better results than usual.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also really like the small size of the stand. It looks very minimalist on my bathroom counter, unlike the behemoth I had with my old toothbrush.</li>
    <li> This product is a good value for the money.  This review may sound critical, but its not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottom line:  this product simply costs less than many other products, and yet it gets the job done.  If you can&#x27;t afford to pay 2x or 3x for a&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its got a timer, which does not beep when you are supposed to change part of your mouth.&lt;br /&gt;Its in a blister package, which is cheaper to make than a color box.&lt;br /&gt;Its rechargable&lt;br /&gt;its waterproof&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its also mechanical and noisy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using it for a prolonged time, I think it does an adequate job.  You don&#x27;t need to spend more money, particularly if you floss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think this would be the perfect toothbrush for a person who was considering upgrading to a electric but couldn&#x27;t get a sonicare for whatever reason (and there are some good reasons: tooth sensitivity, price, etc)</li>
    <li> I got this to replace my old Elec. brush that I got from think geek years ago. I finally ran out of new heads. And most of the the ones out meow did not fit it. So I got this as it uses the same heads that are common.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had the same electric toothbrush for about eight years. It finally rusted and broke so I got this one and I&#x27;m really happy with it. It holds a charge well and the spinning isn&#x27;t too intense. The head on it is kind of weird, but I got used to it and it&#x27;s fine now. Definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> A must for kids to brush longer! Fun!!!!</li>
    <li> Too rough on gums, too messy, teeth didn&#x27;t get very clean.  It is now sitting under my sink and no one in the house will use it.  Waste of money.</li>
    <li> Been using this make/model for years, so when i saw it at a really great price i purchased it as a spare.. They cost MUCH more in the stores...</li>
    <li> A great idea for a gift, it was really appreciated!</li>
    <li> My old Oral-B died and I needed one that works with the same heads.  This one arrived and it&#x27;s perfect.  It&#x27;s slightly different from the old one (two-push on-off function instead of different on-off buttons) but it works just as well.  I couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
    <li> I like my rechargeable toothbrush.  The price was fantastic and it works very well.  I would never go back to a regular toothbrush.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t beat the price and it leaves your teeth feeling cleaner then a toothbrush. if u haven&#x27;t purchased an electric toothbrush u should consider this one.</li>
    <li> if you can tolerate the vibration of it, it seems fine.&lt;br /&gt;the child I bought it for could not stand it, and another child did not seem bothered by it.&lt;br /&gt;so, you have to decided if the shaking/vibration of it is something you like or not.</li>
    <li> We love these spin brushes. It&#x27;s like having a hygienist clean your teeth every time you brush!  You have a nice clean, polished feeling afterward.</li>
    <li> I bought this as recommended by my dentist (who is very practical) and I&#x27;m loving it so far, three months after purchase. The toothbrush is excellent, and the care is so minimal. I plug it in every 3 days or so and I haven&#x27;t had any problems to date. For the price, you can&#x27;t go wrong with an excellent toothbrush that does what it is supposed to do!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s price was great and it is a great toothbrush. I have never had an electric toothbrush before and my gums and teeth feel fantastic. I love the 2 minute timer and when I am done my mouth is so clean and fresh.</li>
    <li> Recommended by my dental hygienist, my teeth feel like I&#x27;ve just come from the dentist every time I brush. This electric toothbrush is inexpensive, good for use by one single person and comes with a refill brush.  Simple, easy to use and works great.  Just set it on your bathroom sink, plug it in to charge, and its ready to use.  It even pulses after 2 minutes to let you know when you&#x27;re finished with a thorough brushing.  I bought one for myself and one for my husband.  My husband used to have bad breath.  Since he&#x27;s using this electric toothbrush, his breath no longer has an odor.  This electric toothbrush minimizes flossing.  I can never go back to a regular toothbrush again.</li>
    <li> Have owned a few cordless models and I love this one, best I have ever had.  Very good quality especially when compared to the cheaper ones.</li>
    <li> You don&#x27;t have to spend sixty bucks on an electric toothbrush! This one works great and last a long time. I comes with one head and Oral B is the standard for electric toothbrushes therefore you can find a variety of heads to suit your needs. I have used this type of brush for years and I regularly get comments from my dentist that I am brushing well and people asking me if I use whitening; I don&#x27;t, I only brush once a day before bed with this electric toothbrush.</li>
    <li> I love these re-chargeable toothbrushes. They are easy to handle, especially if you have arthritis in your hands. They make my teeth feel as clean as they do when the dentist cleans them.</li>
    <li> This was the first electric toothbrush I have ever purchased, and boy, am I glad that I switched over!  I didn&#x27;t expect it to work as well as it does, considering it was under $30.  My teeth feel a lot cleaner after brushing, and I also love the built-in timer!</li>
    <li> The toothbrush came properly packed and in time.  It appeared to be pretty good at the first glance.  The on/off button felt a bit flimsy and mushy to me; however, I didn&#x27;t want to have any preconceived bias against it.  Our son started using it and it worked fine for the first few days.  Unfortunately, it started to malfunction soon and the switch turned out to be the culprit.  Initially, it would act up by not turning on and sometimes we couldn&#x27;t turn it off.  The charging system was suspected of malfunction in the beginning, but I think it was okay.  The only incentive to purchase this unit was to save money, but well... you get what you pay for I suppose.  I returned the unit for a refund and purchased a higher-end electric toothbrush for our son from Costco.  I chose Costco instead of Amazon only because we would have much more time for the return of the (defective) unit.  BY the way, my wife and I have been using Oral-B electric toothbrushes from Costco for almost a year now without any incidence.  I am little nervous to recommend the unit to anyone because of our bad luck (?).  It may be okay to use if it was just that our unit was a lemon.  Please read other reviews (good and bad) before making up your mind.</li>
    <li> This has been a great replacement for my last electric toothbrush that finally said goodbye.  This comes with the charger and two replacement heads.  It has one speed with a timer. I only miss the two speeds that were on my old one though.  But all in all for the price this is a super great deal!</li>
    <li> Replaced old electric toothbrush that was old and worn out.  Also this electric toothbrush has new features that I like.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using these electric toothbrushes for years, just buy a new one when the old one wears out. The stands seem interchangable, I have one with toothbrush head storage in my bathroom, and take the smaller one when I travel. Best feature? My dentist noticed the difference. When I went for my cleaning, there was little to no picking at my teeth. By that I mean less than a minute or two, and that included looking around! And that&#x27;s what I bought it for. Because I&#x27;m basically a lousy tooth brusher; always was. In the morning I&#x27;m not awake enough, at night I&#x27;m exhausted. With this thing, it&#x27;s automatic. If I had only had one when I was a kid, I&#x27;d have perfect teeth today (nobody ever taught me how to brush my teeth; in the 60&#x27;s it was just a matter of &#x27;do you brush up and down, or side to side; nobody ever told me to brush the chewing surfaces, so I had perfect sides on my teeth, and giant cavities going down the middles). So, buy this brush. Keep your teeth. Isn&#x27;t that what it&#x27;s all about? Oh, and same charging stand for what, 25 years? When it ain&#x27;t broke, don&#x27;t fix it. Ni-cad or lithium, seems to work just fine. Cost? Compared to one dentist filling, dirt cheap. And yes, I suppose you could get by with a cheap $1 hand held manual toothbrush, and diligently brush your teeth. But this is easier, and seems to clean better than I was ever able to on my own.</li>
    <li> Works great.  Seems to do a great job cleaning my teeth.</li>
    <li> A few years back I was having issues with really gritty teeth despite brushing them twice a day. When I went to the Dentist I mentioned this to him. He suggested I try the Electronic Toothbrush. I was skeptical but went ahead and bought it. WOW what a difference. I haven&#x27;t had that issue since. This particular purchase was for both of my parents last Christmas. They have since both mentioned to me how much cleaner their teeth feel. I don&#x27;t brush for the suggested two minutes but I do use it twice a day and a charge lasts almost a full month. Definitely worth the investment!!</li>
    <li> Great!  My son uses this toothbrush per the recommendation of our dentist.  It&#x27;s the best electric toothbrush he has tried.</li>
    <li> Great product. TERRIBLE packaging. That plastic has got to go. Cut my finger trying to get it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my second Oral-B rechargeable Electric Toothbrush. I had the first for a long long time before the battery finally gave out. Hope this one lasts as long. Or longer.</li>
    <li> Very good brush. The built in timer helps kids brush for at least the right amount of time. The last dental cleaning was very positive and less buildup than when we used a manual brush!</li>
    <li> These brush heads clean my teeth incredibly well. I end up with super white teeth without having to bleach them!</li>
    <li> I am flabbergasted that people spend $100+ on electric toothbrushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No, this won&#x27;t beep at you 4 times. It won&#x27;t floss for you, offer different settings, etc. If you absolutely need anything other than just basic &amp;#34;brush,&amp;#34; this isn&#x27;t the toothbrush for you. If you are capable of knowing what clean teeth feel and look like without mechanical assistance, this is the right toothbrush for you. I had an earlier model that lasted 4 years before it stopped taking a charge, so I think it was a worthy investment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Replacement heads are cheap and plentiful - I tend to buy the aftermarket big box store brands, or pick them up at Costco on the cheap.</li>
    <li> Been using for years. Rechargeableness eventually fades, but it lasts 2+ years, so I get my money&#x27;s worth, especially since the dentist reports have been better.</li>
    <li> not as greast as my original one that costs 130 - but i didnt have 130 - so i went for the cheaper model - louder and harsher than the pricey model - but works fine.</li>
    <li> best bang for your buck on electric brushes. why spend 100&#x27;s when you can buy the oral B Vitality. was recommended by a friend and i will do the same .. love it and it comes with an extra head.</li>
    <li> This is my second Oral-B electric toothbrush (the other one lasted for years). This one is easy to clean and the two-minute &amp;#34;jiggle&amp;#34; warning makes sure I brush the proper length of time.</li>
    <li> Some people have said that you get what you pay for, however, it is an electric toothbrush and not a voice activated car navigational system.  I can&#x27;t imagine what other options are really out there that one would need in addition to what this electric toothbrush already offers.  I buy a new one every one and a half years or so.  I am now on my third one, and these have stood the test as I have used these while deployed with the military.  Consequently, they have been used out in the field and can go roughly two weeks on a full charge when using them 3x a day.  Someone said that there is some sort of alarm on here to let you know when you have brushed for two minutes.  I don&#x27;t know anything about this, nor do I care......I am 34 years old and have never had a cavity in my life......I know when my teeth are clean and don&#x27;t need a buzzer or an alarm to tell me when to stop brushing my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The chargers are some of the sturdiest chargers that I have ever seen for any small electronic gadget.&lt;br /&gt;The only thing that I feel that I should forewarn anyone about, is that you need to keep these cleaned.  Sometimes toothpaste etc can bulding on the appication head.  If this is not kept clean, it can make changing otu the heads very difficult.</li>
    <li> I like this toothbrush, but am not fond of the bristles.  I like the way it can time the amount of the time needed to brush your teeth properly.  I may go and buy new brush heads for it.</li>
    <li> I am so glad I purchased these brushes for my family.  8 months after Christmas and they&#x27;re still running strong!</li>
    <li> This is the best toothbrush I&#x27;ve ever owned.  It&#x27;s WAY more effective than the Sonicare line that my dentist pushes and certainly better than a manual brush.</li>
    <li> You get a wonderful electric toothbrush for a fraction of the cost.  This toothbrush works very well and I love it.</li>
    <li> does the job to my satisfaction as I expected it to do.  What more can I say about it.  It&#x27;s fine.</li>
    <li> Still going strong!  Charge lasts a very long time, probably close to 2 weeks with using it 3 or 4 times daily.  Nice product!</li>
    <li> This works more powerfully, is light weight and has a longer battery life than the original(this is my 2nd one). The timer is still cool too. Dr Rices hygienist recommended it.</li>
    <li> Good price, works well. Nice and compact.</li>
    <li> Works great and would buy another when needed</li>
    <li> I love it. It&#x27;s very light weight and so I don&#x27;t feel that I&#x27;m putting a lot of pressure on my teeth and gums.&lt;br /&gt;Very convenient to charge it and it&#x27;s pretty quiet.</li>
    <li> We bought this to replace an existing Oral-B toothbrush that was just not charging up to full speed any more.  This is our third one and needless to say we love it.  All of the previous toothbrushes gave us many years of service.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for quite a few months now and it&#x27;s great. The price was good, and no faults with it so far. You can feel the &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34; so much after brush than with a manual toothbrush.</li>
    <li> Do you need an excellent toothbrush?  It also comes with a second removable head.  It has a 2 and a half minute timer.</li>
    <li> I have not had experience with other electric toothbrushes, but I must say I am highly satisfied with the clean feeling this gives me after brushing. Waaay better than using a manual toothbrush. Not a lot to pay for a fresh from the dentist feel. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I bought this one to replace my many years old Oral-B/Braun electric toothbrush which quit taking a charge. In comparison, this model runs faster, has a single speed, no LED lamp, and gives the same 2 minute pulse. It also takes the standard replacement brush heads available at my dentist&#x27;s office.</li>
    <li> I just replaced my actual oral b with the new model since mine was not working anymore. Great buy very light and gentle to the gum. If you are like me ruff when you brush your teeth on the gum this will help you.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used one for several years until it died.  Bought a cheaper one that was no good.  Vitality replacement is great.</li>
    <li> i would&#x27;nt have any other brush.</li>
    <li> It works wonderfully, so much better than my old toothbrush. It arrived on the same day it was promised. Well packaged.</li>
    <li> These rechargeable tooth brushes get the job done and are very dependable. my old one lasted four years before the battery gave out.</li>
    <li> Years ago, I bought some Oral-B 3D rechargeable toothbrushes on a store error sale that allowed us to get 2 at the sale price instead of one. About a decade later, some of the toothbrushes are failing. They had a 2 minute timer, and charge indicator. We replaced 2 of the brushes with this, and overall, it hasn&#x27;t been a problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This brush works fine, no charge indicator, but it has a slightly larger handle, which I find easier to hold. By this time, everyone in my home knows how to use these. My children started on this type of brush, and have never had cavities. My wife and I have not had any cavities since starting to use Oral-B toothbrushes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The self recharge feature is helpful. Over the years, there is a lot more warning boilerplate. Though the mechanism seems almost identical. We change toothbrush heads about every 3 to 4 months, but the toothbrush itself should last a long time.</li>
    <li> Great brush. Love the power and the charger is small and compact.</li>
    <li> Cut my hands up opening the blister packaging which was made of plastic that left such sharp edges that I could have used it to open a second package. The unit arrived completely dead, so I plugged it in overnight. Nothing. After reading that it will not charge on a GFI outlet, I tried a different, non-GFI circuit. Nothing. Frankly, I am a little gad it did not work - the muted cream and blue were somehow unpleasant to look at. I don&#x27;t expect much fashion from a toothbrush, but this design makes it look like it fell off a piece of hospital equipment in the 70&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> Works just as they said it would, once charged it last about a week which is great! I had one year ago, don&#x27;t know why I stopped using it.</li>
    <li> lasted 33 days will not take a charge.back to the old Sonicare tooth brush lasts for years Cheap is Cheap</li>
    <li> Good product. Wasn&#x27;t looking for the the latest and greatest, top-of-the-line toothbrush - just one that was made with quality and that would brush/clean my teeth well. The more expensive versions of this toothbrush have a lot of bells and whistles that I consider pretty unnecessary, especially for the increased price tag they wield.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only negative is the \\&quot;you&#x27;ve been brushing for 2 minutes\\&quot; alarm. Actually, it&#x27;s not technically an alarm I guess; it just cuts the toothbrush&#x27;s power several times in rapid succession over a period of a couple seconds. If you brush longer than 2 minutes (like I do), it&#x27;s kind of annoying, bc you have to basically stop brushing momentarily until the \\&quot;alarm\\&quot; stops. A simple \\&quot;beep\\&quot; sound would be nicer; but regardless, this is a fairly minor issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m happy with my purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for reading. I&#x27;m here all week.</li>
    <li> Very good product, the engine is powerful and it really work good on your teeth. If you are a traveller, attention! It comes with a charger good only for the USA.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very disappointed in this product.  I purchased the toothbrush May 2013 and it no longer holds a charge.</li>
    <li> This has been a great addition to to my stash of electric toothbrushes.  I also have a couple of dentist supplied Rotadents and this holds up nicely compared to those toothbrushes.  It will take just about any Oral-B brush head (no sonics though) and allows for some diversity in brushing.  Also, the brush heads are relatively inexpensive compared to Rotadent.</li>
    <li> Unless you need a separate display with a picture of teeth on it or a timer to tell you when to switch brushing each quadrant of your mouth, this toothbrush is sufficient and excellent.  I saw immediate whitening results with the Pro White brush.  I bought 6 FlossAction heads for everyday use.  They all work great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s just hard to get used to not having to manually scrub your teeth.  It is really powerful.  You don&#x27;t need to press hard at all.  You just touch the brush head to each tooth surface and let it do the work.  The transition takes about a week to get used to.  Once you do, it&#x27;s amazing.  One thing to note when using a brush like this is you can&#x27;t just remove the brush from your mouth or the toothpaste will spray everywhere.  You need to learn to shut it off while it&#x27;s in your mouth before removing it from your mouth;  all part of the transition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Family members can use the same toothbrush by just switching out the brush heads (ie one brush head assigned to each family member).  Just pop them on and off for each use.  The brush heads come with colored collars you can pop onto the bottom to let you color code the brush heads if you&#x27;re sharing this brush with others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does give you a special vibe-pulse at the end of two minutes to let you know you&#x27;ve been brushing long enough.  Like I said, no fancy bells and whistles like separate displays with this one.  It just does the job and does it well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am really impressed with this product.</li>
    <li> My dentist suggested the Oral B and it has turned out to be a very good buy.  It improves your gums and cleans teeth well.  I really like the timer on it to let me know when I have brushed for 3 minutes.  Definitely worth the money!</li>
    <li> This is as good as the Braun I paid $100 for a decade ago.</li>
    <li> Works great. Perfect size for my toddlers mouth. She loves to brush her teeth. Worked right out of the box.</li>
    <li> I love the new toothbrush. It works beautifully. I would buy another one when necessary and reccomend it to others.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s cleaning my teeth better, but my mouth gets more sore.  The toothbrush head seems to be a bit shaky and I&#x27;m hoping it will hold up for the long haul.</li>
    <li> Purchased this model and charged it for about 12 hours the first time and it stopped working after about a minute. Charged again for about 18 hours and then tried it again - same thing. It won&#x27;t hold a charge - its going back and won&#x27;t buy again. Buyer beware.</li>
    <li> There are other better products available for a premium price but for this price, this is okay product.</li>
    <li> I bought 2 at Walmart.  They both were last for more than 3 years (just need to replace the head).  I replaced them from the ones I bought on Amazon, EXACTLY the same brand.  Both were stopped working after 2 months. I&#x27;m wondering if the ones I bought on Amazon are counterfit?</li>
    <li> This is a great electric toothbrush. I bought this because the dentist suggested I get&lt;br /&gt;a electric toothbrush because it does a better job and this one works great.</li>
    <li> Performs better than the old Oral-B I had (Battery died and wouldn&#x27;t recharge). Gets in between my teeth better, less flossing.&lt;br /&gt;My dental hygienist noticed the difference.</li>
    <li> This toothbrush replaced my old one that wouldn&#x27;t charge anymore. It works great and the timer feature lets you know when you can stop brushing.</li>
    <li> This replaces my old Vitality.(its battery died after nearly 5 years)  It is even better because the charge unit is smaller and takes up less room. I love the timer, too.  My teeth feel really clean after using it, and it is econmical.</li>
    <li> Basic and inexpensive. A bit short on battery life. No indication of battery life or charging condition.&lt;br /&gt;But it is still a good buy and does the job.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t go back to using a regular toothbrush again after using this one! Easy to use and cleans the teeth well.</li>
    <li> I would highly recommend this toothbrush to anyone. It can easily last a week on a charge, and Ive even come to love the &amp;#34;floss brushes&amp;#34;. This cleans your teeth a hundred times better than a normal brush would. It is well worth the price. Awesome product!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used the $100 plus brush sold by dentists, a Sonicare, and this item. By far, the Vitality gave me the closest dental cleaning feel. I bought it after my Sonicare died. Unfortunately, I&#x27;m no stranger to professional oral care due to lax habits plus a diet consisting of too much candy in my youth. I decided to try the Vitality after overhearing my dentist tell another patient that he wouldn&#x27;t spend the dough on those expensive brands they push in house. Wish someone had been that honest with me years ago when I purchased my first electric brush, which, by the way, did not last as long as the Sonicare. I use a dye that targets plaque residue and notice much less now that I&#x27;m using the Vitality. I give it only four stars because I&#x27;ve owned it less than two months and am not sure how cleaning might change over time, etc.</li>
    <li> This is my first electric toothbrush and I think it does the trick. Holds the charge for the whole week with 2-3 times/day use. The head is small enough I can get my back molars really well. My only complaint is how gross it gets around the bottom of the brush head. Water? gets in there and makes layer of film pretty much daily even with rinsing it off well after use. Doesn&#x27;t have the quadrant timer, but after a few uses you can basically time it yourself. Good for the money, glad I didn&#x27;t spent $100+ when this works great.</li>
    <li> This toothbrush is very good. It has a timer and you know exactly when to stop brushing your teeth. It brushes your teeth so well. I like that I can recharge it and don&#x27;t have to buy batteries.</li>
    <li> For the price this toothbrush does a great job of cleaning teeth and gingiva.  Using the sensitive brush in this toothbrush really helps get teeth clean without the usual pain on very sensitive teeth.  They are quite durable because this is our 3rd  Oral B electric toothbrush over at least 14 years, and actually we are still using the second one.</li>
    <li> I bought this because I like OralB products.  The description did not make clear that this was for cleaning as opposed to brushing teeth.  I went out and replaced the brush head with a sensitive head brush.  Like the timing feature.</li>
    <li> I like it a lot it is perfect, this is my fourth order I bought it for all family members</li>
    <li> We needed a rechargeable electric toothbrush and because of the positive reviews decided to try the Oral-B Vitality Pro.  Good price and the toothbrush works really well. We are happy that we ordered it!</li>
    <li> Had older Oral-B that died, this is perfect replacement for it.  Bought one for each of us.  Wish it had the 30 second timer the old one did.</li>
    <li> I like this Oral-B electric toothbrush! We currently have the same brand and have been using it for many, many years. They just don&#x27;t quit. I got this one because it was priced so well, and I wanted my own! I had been sharing one with my husband, but it never failed--we both want to brush at the same time! The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it five stars is that it has one speed. Our old one has two speeds; but truthfully I don&#x27;t know why you need two. It works very well and the brushes seem to do an excellent job. I&#x27;m very happy I purchased it.</li>
    <li> I have never had an Electric toothbrush until my wife insisted to buy one since it does a better job than regular toothbrush. It takes a while to get use to it, but once you use it for a while, it is great.</li>
    <li> I bought this toothbrush at the urging of my dentist.  After using this toothbrush for a few months, might dentist noticed a difference at my regular checkup.  I too notice a difference--when traveling I used a manual toothbrush and definitely noticed a different feel with the manual brush (less clean, especially gums).  I challenge anyone to the same test.  I also like that I can use almost any Oral-B brush head with the wand, so I don&#x27;t have to worry about the store being out of any particular kind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think this brush works well for someone who is already accustomed to brushing with a manual brush properly (i.e., doesn&#x27;t need a quadrant timer or pressure alarm to tell them how to do it).  A fancier model with a bigger storage case might be beneficial for larger households, to store multiple brush heads (this one doesn&#x27;t come with any storage).</li>
    <li> I had the 100 plus dollar one previously for over 8 years but I lost the base... So I bought this 20 somethin dollar one to replace it and it is equally as awesome thus far.</li>
    <li> Love our Oral B toothbrushes.</li>
    <li> I love this brush! I had battery brushes before, but this one really ramps up the performance for just a bit more up-front. I have no idea how long this will last with the rechargeable battery, but it is really zooming now. I got the whitening brushes, and they do work. I spent some time brushing the old fashioned way after my battery machine died, and this is no good. This machine gives you a clean feel, a great gum workout and noticeably whiter teeth. It is a great value!</li>
    <li> I must say I was so skeptical about purchasing this because Electrical toothbrushes run from as cheap as $15 all the way up to the hundreds!This one being under $25 I decided to give it a try and let me tell you my teeth have never been this white in years!After just five days of using it all the yellow is gone off my teeth. I will never go back to a regular toothbrush ever again and will stick with this product!Buy it!,trust me, you will be glad you did!!!</li>
    <li> My teeth have NEVER been this white. EVER. It has a buzzing timer to tell you when your two minutes are up and does a great job of getting off that ring of tartar below your gum line. Great product!</li>
    <li> Great for the money - quality very very good - -only reason not 5 stars is because the 2-minute timer doesn&#x27;t work on mine.</li>
    <li> Great little electric toothbrush. I have no negative comments about it. I wish the genuine replacement heads were less expensive, that&#x27;s all.</li>
    <li> I brush my teeth a lot more using this.  I know that sounds crazy but I actually like brushing my teeth now.  The head of it is small so it doesn&#x27;t feel bulky, very comfortable and the timer is great.</li>
    <li> Pros: -my teeth feel amazingly clean after I use this toothbrush&lt;br /&gt;  -It is rechargeable and not battery operated&lt;br /&gt;  -great price&lt;br /&gt;Cons: It came apart when I tried to change the brush head, so now it only functions as a regular toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Could be a bit sturdier, but is still a decent brush for the buck</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t had one cavity since I started using this toothbrush about 6 years ago. The dentist and technicians always rave about how great my teeth and gums look, and I think I owe a lot of that to this brush. Now I can&#x27;t stand how scummy my teeth feel after using a manual toothbrush. Get one! Your teeth will thank you :)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Oral-B device for oh, at least 15 years if not more.  This year, it died and I bought my second  Oral-B.  It works great, it&#x27;s economical, and I always have great checkups at the dentist.  I&#x27;ll keep buying it as long as they keep making it.</li>
    <li> Excelent product .... :) :)</li>
    <li> Very low profile, this takes very little space on the counter.  So inexpensive but it works like the $79 version I bought a few years ago.  ...1/4 the price, basically.  Works just like it should.  Buy it.</li>
    <li> Electric toothbrushes in general are great.&lt;br /&gt;I have been using Oral-B Vitality and now this Oral-B Vitality Pro.&lt;br /&gt;In general I feel that this has helped to reduce plaque and help keep the teeth white.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I especially like the plaque reduction, since the visits to the dentist for routine check up and cleaning are less painful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have not tried other brands, but gave not gone wrong on this brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The base unit has a rechargeable battery that is water proof and I have used it for years without having to replace the base.&lt;br /&gt;I do replace the brushes periodically as recommended and is obviously necessary.</li>
    <li> Great product at great price.I Have been using this product for 25+ yrs. Last one lasted more than 7 yrs.</li>
    <li> I bought three of these for me and my kids. Brushes are small and gentle enough for kids. Self timer is great feature.</li>
    <li> Why spend a hundred bucks on a tooth brush when this will do exactly what you want. Best bang (or cleaning) for the buck!</li>
    <li> I am so delighted with this toothbrush.  Having used it for a while now Ifind it really does get between the teeth and&lt;br /&gt;makes my mouth feel refreshed after each use.  Real value for money.</li>
    <li> Easy to use and store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t know why they require more words in the review when a few will convey the message...</li>
    <li> the product works as described.  I especially like the built in timer that lets you know you have brushed for at least two minutes</li>
    <li> My dentist has been very happy with the results!  This is my first electric toothbrush and she convinced me to make the switch.  After reading about a lot of different ones I picked this one for the price and the other good reviews.  I like the two-minute alert and the indicator bristles on the head that change color when it&#x27;s time to replace the brush head.  It has good power.  I can&#x27;t speak to the battery life since I always leave it plugged in.  I took off one star because the small head doesn&#x27;t make my mouth feel as clean as using a big old toothbrush, but apparently it&#x27;s working (according to the dentist).  It doesn&#x27;t work great on your tongue though so maybe get a tongue scraper.</li>
    <li> I had one that was about 5 years old and it finally died.  This one uses a stiffer brush and seems to have a better oscillating action so it feels like it is cleaning better.  I really like it and the price was very reasonable.</li>
    <li> I had one of these for years and loved it. After years of faithful service its motor weakened and I replaced it with another. It worked great for a month and completely died. Whether it&#x27;s the switch or motor or battery I don&#x27;t know but even for $20+ I was hoping for more. Be wary.</li>
    <li> I do love the oral b this is my 3rd, I prefer the professional but it&#x27;s unaffordable at the moment, and the 2 minute timer is great</li>
    <li> I needed some new brush heads for my Oral B toothbrush. I&#x27;ve had it for years, but I decided to try the Pro White heads. I wasn&#x27;t even thinking about \\&quot;whitening\\&quot;, they just looked like they would be good for cleaning the gumline. WOW!! About two weeks after using the Pro White head, one day I looked in the mirror and realized my teeth had become noticeably whiter. It was a complete surprise. I wasn&#x27;t doing anything else for whitening. It&#x27;s about a week later, and my teeth - which weren&#x27;t terribly off white to begin with - are still showing improving whiteness. My wife uses a pro style dentist recommended tooth cleaning \\&quot;system\\&quot; that costs as much as a couple of tickets to an NFL game. She kept hearing me comment on the brusheads, so today she asked if she could try one. SHE WAS AMAZED! After one brushing, she announced that she was retiring her expensive \\&quot;system\\&quot; and is now using the Pro White head. I am buying another Oral B rechargeable toothbrush with the Pro White heads for my son. And it&#x27;s UNDER 30 BUCKS, with two heads included. This just may be the best deal on the planet.</li>
    <li> Have used Oral-B electric toothbrushes for probably 15 years now. Have yet to have one cavity in that time frame and I still have all but 1 of my &amp;#34;wisdom&amp;#34; teeth (hard to reach and prone to decay). The precision heads are great for people like me that have to reach back in there and get those wisdoms cleaned. The electric rechargeable brush handles last about three years with daily use and NEVER discharging (out of laziness) and constantly on the charger unless brushing. Manual says to do otherwise but alas, I&#x27;ve got more things to worry about than discharging both our handles on a routine basis. I&#x27;ll take my three years of usage and run with it ...&lt;br /&gt;Heads can get expensive, but a good quality toothbrush costs almost as much. They do last about 4-5 months. For me, 6 months would be pushing it.</li>
    <li> Nice, keeps charge and teeth squeaky clean.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Mind you, we haven&#x27;t come from a $100-200 professional toothbrush to this one.  So if you&#x27;re in the \\&quot;posh\\&quot; category in life, my review may not be helpful.  We&#x27;ve been using the battery operated toothbrushes for our kids and it&#x27;s a major pain to change out the batteries every two weeks.  You have to unscrew the screw at the bottom and it gets all corroded with toothpaste, then you hope you have the right battery size as they eat batteries like crazy, then the brush isn&#x27;t cheap replacing it every 3 months at $6-$8 dollars a pop.  It&#x27;s not fast, easy,or affordable by any stretch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We decided to buy the Vitality along with some cheaper compatible heads to switch out for our kids.  They don&#x27;t have enough colors for our family so I just take a black marker and initial it at the bottom with the first letter of their name.  It&#x27;s exceptionally easy to change the head, which was my main concern when I bought it.  Should we technically have a brush for each kid, yes, but we can&#x27;t afford to do so right now.  Plus that&#x27;s a lot of counter space wasted and I don&#x27;t think my OCD could handle five separate toothbrushes staring me in the face every day.  Our kids are little and I brush their teeth still. It makes our mouths feel dentist clean. It&#x27;s fast and easy, which I need brushing three little mouths and then my own.  The timer isn&#x27;t high tech, but it pulses after two minutes, which is an adequate indicator.  It doesn&#x27;t have a charge indicator as some have complained, but seriously, who really needs an indicator if it has a docking station?  If you place it on the docking station, you shouldn&#x27;t have a problem, unless you brush your teeth five times a day. We don&#x27;t eat junk and therefore don&#x27;t have a need to brush our teeth even three times a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The knock off replacement heads are so much more affordable than the $40 per two heads other professional toothbrushes cost.  I&#x27;d have to lop off an arm to pay for brush heads every 3 months.  Insane!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m alittle nervous as to how long the battery life will last with five of us using one brush, but hey, even if it last&#x27;s six months, it only cost me $25 bucks and it&#x27;s worth the convenience factor.  If I don&#x27;t like the battery life, I&#x27;ll be sure to tag on a comment at the end.  I gave it four stars as it&#x27;s probably lacking in some features, but the price is right and makes up for it with my frugal lifestyle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, give it a try if you&#x27;re in the same boat as we are. You probably won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> I like this brush! The two minute timer is helpful too.&lt;br /&gt;It feels quite powerful. It makes my mouth feel fresh&lt;br /&gt;and clean.</li>
    <li> This certainly cleans your teeth. However, it&#x27;s difficult to get toothpaste to stay on this thing because the spin is so fast.</li>
    <li> Stopped working in 1.5 years.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t write a lot of reviews, but I really love this toothbrush! I had problems with some build up on my teeth and cavities (especially due to having tight contacts). It&#x27;s definitely possible I wasn&#x27;t brushing vigorously enough or using the right brush, but it was annoying and gross! I got this, finally, though my dentist office was recommending it for the past 2 years, and I am SO glad I did. My teeth feel great, even after I eat or drink coffee! And the gross build up that would happen all too quickly is gone too! I can say that, at first, it can be a little painful, but stick with it because that pain is just telling you that you haven&#x27;t been doing a very good job with brushing your gums and teeth, most likely. (Though I&#x27;m not a dentist so if it&#x27;s really hurting or you&#x27;re unsure, ask your dentist).</li>
    <li> Oral b has been in my home for years. I paid a couple hundred dollars for this many years ago and was very disappointed when my charger stopped working because I thought it would cost so much to get a new one. I was able to get it here for $26 and it replaced my old charger and I now have a new handle and brush too. This was a very good buy and I would recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> I like this product because it really works on keeping your teeth clean and I enjoyed it so much I bought on for a Christmas gift and they enjoy it too.</li>
    <li> my dentist told me to buy this. It work great, and promotes health teeth. easy to use and store. no problem.</li>
    <li> My father has an old model and it&#x27;s worked great for years. So I thought I&#x27;d get one. Now, I don&#x27;t usually write many reviews, but felt compelled.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought one of these for $30 a CVS. It&#x27;s a newer model, and feels a little lighter and cheaper than my dad&#x27;s. The first one charged all day and would not turn on at all. Left it charge for more than 24 hours and still nothing. So I took it back and CVS replaced it, no questions. The second one I charged for almost 24 hours before using, but I used it once and it ran out of charge in under a minute. Now it won&#x27;t charge at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I imagine that I could keep going through these at CVS until I find one that worked. But say it works for a few months and then kaput. I would have to go through their warranty program, paying shipping to send it to them. I have better things to do than play with toothbrushes! I will invest the money in a pricier electric toothbrush that&#x27;ll give me some years of use.</li>
    <li> Small powerful head, able to reach places that you can&#x27;t with regular toothbrush head. Most important it helps me control plaque build up on back of teeth that could only be reached by a Dentist.</li>
    <li> Gets the job done very well for a very reasonable price. I even convinced my husband to try it and he even loves it.</li>
    <li> So much better than Sonicare which is much more expensive. Does just as good a job and is easier to clean.</li>
    <li> This is a good toothbrush, cleans fantastically.  I would have given it a 5 star but it&#x27;s loud.  I didn&#x27;t expect it to be so loud, but I&#x27;ll keep it and use it because it works really well.</li>
    <li> This is the ultimate brush for cleaning your teeth. I have had one for quite some time and rave about it. I purchased this one for my 10 year old grand daughter because she requested a toothbrush like &#x27;nana&#x27;s. She loves it. I have no doubt that she is getting a better brush with this than a regular brush. The price is not outrageous, but quite affordable. You will love it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been a long time user of a Phillips Sonicare and love it.  It gets my teeth clean and even seems to get in between them with the sonic technology.  But when my elderly grandmother needed an electric toothbrush as a first time user of one, I got her this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is very lightweight and simple.  It has a small round head that spins and polishes teeth.&lt;br /&gt;It is rechargable by putting it on it&#x27;s small stand that plugs into an outlet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried it out and find that it works every bit as well as my more expensive Sonicare, although I don&#x27;t think it gets between teeth quite as well, but it&#x27;s close.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But my grandmother loves this and is very happy with it.  It makes it easier for her to keep her teeth clean.  Between this and the Sonicare, I think it&#x27;s a dead heat draw.  They both work well.  This one is a bit cheaper and lighter in weight.  I&#x27;m pleased with this and find it works very well.</li>
    <li> This unit replaced a more costly one that lasted 10 years and cost about $100. This was priced better than local big box store, no shipping, no tax. For me it was a no brainier. A purchase I am pleased with .</li>
    <li> Unfortunately, I bought this toothbrush and didn&#x27;t use it until 3 months after purchasing it. It won&#x27;t charge/hold a charge, only runs about 30 seconds before dying no matter how long it&#x27;s been plugged in.  I&#x27;ve owned many Oral-B brushes over the years and never had this problem, they&#x27;ve always worked for years before needing replacement. The guarantee is only for 30 days so I&#x27;m out of luck.</li>
    <li> We&#x27;ve bought a few of these over the years, and I really love the way it leaves my teeth extra-clean and super-smooth feeling after brushing. I buy the soft replacement heads, as I find the regular brush heads too hard on my gums (but this is a personal preference). The first Oral-B Vitality Pro White Rechargeable Electric Toothbrush I bought did really well for about 6 months, then one day when I tried to turn it off, it just kept going. I ended up having to literally beat it to death to make it stop. I have bought 3 other since then, and have not had that problem again, so I think it was just a fluke, since I followed the directions regarding the rechargeable battery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course, is extremely important to thoroughly clean the unit after every use, and wipe down the charger base daily, to avoid gross, gunky build-up. It is important to note that the replacement heads for this unit are rather pricey, in my opinion. Since I frequently switch out our manual toothbrushes about once a month when we use those, with this I soak each brush head individually in Original Listerine and a small amount of Hydrogen Peroxide, then rinse thoroughly to keep them sanitary. For a lower priced electric toothbrush, I think this does a really good job at cleaning my teeth and making them feel really smooth), but I do wish the brush heads were a bit less expensive, which is why I&#x27;m taking 1 star off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is important to note, if you have sensitive teeth (like me) be aware that it is important to barely apply any pressure to your teeth when using this electric toothbrush, to avoid causing damage to your enamel and causing further sensitivity.</li>
    <li> My old unit finally wore out after many years of reliable service. This new one is different, and on balance just as good. Things that are different: one speed rather than two (I never used the slow speed so don&#x27;t miss it at all); does not fit in the old travel case, but does have a travel charger (old unit did not); old charging stand works perfectly and has the added benefit of storage for the brush heads (this model does not have a charging-storage stand); there is no charging indicator light on the unit-it is not needed as you know it is charging when it continues to operate at full speed. The overall build quality is different and it has a different &amp;#34;feel&amp;#34; in the hand, very acceptable. A very good product that brushes teeth very well and at a good price.</li>
    <li> So far, so good.  The brush seems to get my teeth clean, but I usually use a Waterpik (also purchased from Amazon) after I brush, just in case.  I am just waiting to see how long the toothbrush lasts, as sometimes the battery wears out sooner that I would like.</li>
    <li> was tough sell to get my daughter to brush her teeth. she loves this refuses to brush her teeth with anything else</li>
    <li> Great deal on yes item. I checked local stres and the price could not be beat. It does a nice job cleaning your teeth and comes with a extra head. Nice item and price.</li>
    <li> My dental apts have gotten short n sweet after buying this! It doesn&#x27;t have a &#x27;count down&#x27; timer but it will change the vibration pattern after 2 minutes to let you know your 2 mins are up. Also it will hold a charge for a few days if you forget to charge it or need to take it along on a trip and don&#x27;t want to take the base. Want to buy only one handle but want everyone to use it? Just buy extra heads! The heads come off and on easily and mine had different colored bands so we can keep them separate. This with a good flossing routine and you&#x27;re good to go!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for the past month and I&#x27;ve been amazed on how my oral health has improved.  For the price you can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
    <li> This is my 3rd Oral B electric toothbrush, I have used it for years. It makes routine dental appointments fast &amp; easy since there is minimal plaque build up.</li>
    <li> 2nd toothbrush like this that I have. I love it. Of course there are better ones out there but not for this price</li>
    <li> This toothbrush is extremely well made.  So far I haven&#x27;t had any troubles with this toothbrush, not that I was expecting any.  My teeth feels exceptionally clean after using this toothbrush, compared to any other toothbrush I have used.</li>
    <li> I enjoyed my first one so much, I purchased a second one when the battery would not charge as long.  When the battery is in good shape it will stayed charged for about 1 week</li>
    <li> My teeth are whiter after using this brush and my kids love using it too.  We bought an extra head for each person in my family and it gets a lot of use.  I think everybody does a better job brushing when it is fun to do it.  This brush is compact and long lasting.</li>
    <li> There is no halfway timer like on my battery-powered Oral-B toothbrush that this one was to replace.  The first time I used it (last night) I noticed there was no pulsing after a minute.  So basically you&#x27;ve got to watch the clock and after a minute just KNOW to switch and do your upper or lower teeth.  If I wanted to watch a clock I wouldn&#x27;t be paying for an electric toothbrush.  I&#x27;m surprised and not happy at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But on the upside, inside the package there is a 30-day challenge and if you&#x27;re not happy you *can* just send it back.  I don&#x27;t need 30 days to know this isn&#x27;t the product for me.  I&#x27;m also calling Oral-B&#x27;s 800 number to find out if ANY of their newer 2-minute toothbrushes still have the 1-minute vibration/pulse/reminder.  If they don&#x27;t, then I&#x27;ll keep filling my old one with batteries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Packing it up right now to return.  Sucks to have to pay another $5 for shipping and not even get a replacement.  Oh well.</li>
    <li> Good replacement for what I had. Takes the tips that I was using and that is good since i have several.</li>
    <li> Seems like a good value, if you like rotating toothbrush heads.  But I prefer the high-speed vibrating head action in my old Phillips Sonic care electric toothbrush because I believe it cleaned my teeth better (squeaky clean).</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very fast so it cleans better. It doesn&#x27;t hold its charge as well as the cheaper Vitality. I don&#x27;t know if  it&#x27;s just this machine, but it changes the shape of the brush from circular to elliptical.&lt;br /&gt;It has an HTML battery, so I can recharge it at any time. At present I charge it every other time I brush. I also like the charging light.</li>
    <li> I had an older model that wasn&#x27;t charging as well any more.  I charged this one overnight and I&#x27;m still working off the original charge 2 weeks later.  This was extremely inexpensive compared to other electric toothbrushes out there, and I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s missing anything so I feel that it&#x27;s an excellent product for the price.</li>
    <li> We had our first one for quite a few years and it finally succumbed to wear and tear. Ordered this one and it is much more efficient in terms of cleaning the brushhead storage area. The older one had to be unplugged and it was difficult to clean the area without getting the business end of the toothbrush wet. This new one is just a matter of wiping it with a lysol wipe. Much better.</li>
    <li> Replaced my old Oral B with this one and it works as great as the last one with the same features.</li>
    <li> Wish these were as cheap as they used to be in regards to the price. They never break. I have 3 and are all still in use by the family for over 5 years now. Needed to get another one for our most recent addition to the family.</li>
    <li> I bought this at the recommendation of my dental hygienist.  I think it works well.  My reason for only 4 out of 5 stars is that you don&#x27;t really have an idea of when the charge is going to run out.  I can estimate when I need to recharge it, and I need to get better at that.  But, it&#x27;s run out (stopped working) on my twice while I am using it.  Kind of a bit annoying.  But overall, I think it is worth the value.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll get more used to it, but the brush part would be better if it were angled somewhat. It makes me drool and tends to splatter, so I can&#x27;t be wearing a shirt when I use it.&lt;br /&gt;And the designers apparently were not familiar with the concept of \\&quot;ergonomics,\\&quot; since it feels like holding a chunk of plastic water pipe in one&#x27;s hand, rather than feeling more natural and comfortable.  Kind of a surprise, since Braun&#x27;s name is on it. There is just nothing pleasant about using it--very mechanical-feeling instead.&lt;br /&gt;It arrrived on time, took the initial charge well, and seems to be going great so far.  My teeth feel a bit cleaner and a bit smoother.</li>
    <li> Recommended by my dentist.  Finally had to replace my first one after almost a decade of use.  Leaves my mouth feeling clean and fresh.</li>
    <li> It came to my attention recently that we have owned this product for nearly two years at this point and still have not written an interview.  My original review was going to a glowing one filled with singing praises.  I am happy to report that the current review will be the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is not many times that a product will still keep the consumer as excited as the first day.  For my personal use, I just could not get used to using a motorized brush.  I did not enjoy the vibrating feeling nor the rather smallish head.  My husband on the other head LOVES the fact that it is motorized and doesn&#x27;t seem at all bothered by the head&#x27;s size.  This became a hand me down and I have decided to focus on his love and daily use with this electric toothbrush because as I previously stated, I just couldn&#x27;t get past the vibrations.  It had me feeling all shaky and the extra bit of heft wasn&#x27;t what I was used to.  He loves how clean his teeth feel and he really believes that it gets in between the spaces of his teeth and sweeps perfectly against the gum line.  I will attest to the fact that his teeth had more of a shine and it does do a much more thorough job then his old manual toothbrush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a stickler for flossing... the hubby not so much.  Since his use of the Oral-B Vitality, he no longer has icky breath.  I believe that the brush does effectively clean away tartar and calculus compared to the manual toothbrush.  There is a light/timer feature which comes in very handy.  It remains on the charger most of the time.  At one point it was fully charged and lasted a week off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one star loss comes from the fact that the replacement heads that are currently offered in a 3-pack are just too expensive and have been.  We always pay 20 dollars for only 3 heads.  The heads do last a long time, but at that cost you can just be replacing the whole gadget.  The other negative is that gunk builds up on the metal connectors constantly.  I am assuming because the water after each use just slowly slips down and pools in the charging station.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend at the current price point for it&#x27;s longevity to begin with.  Wonderful product for  those on the market that find it necessary to use a motorized toothbrush and feel that they benefit from them.  This is a quality product that will have the user&#x27;s mouth feeling clean after just one use.e water after each use just slowly slips down and pools in the charging station.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend at the current price point for it&#x27;s longevity to begin with.

    <li> I bought two of these to replace my old Oral Bs whose batteries failed after about 7 years of use. My only reservation with the new ones is that they don&#x27;t have a charging indicator light, but I&#x27;m getting used to that as charging works just fine. You just have to be sure the charger is plugged in to a live outlet. For those who care, the Vitality Pro is made in Mexico, the old brushes were from Germany.&lt;br /&gt;I experimented with one of my old chargers and found that it&#x27;s compatible with this toothbrush and charges at the same rate as the supplied chargers, even though the old one is capable of putting out twice the charge rate*, which the old toothbrush needed, having a higher-capacity NiMH battery.&lt;br /&gt;Compatibility note: The chargers have the rounded-corner-trapezoid charging peg. The old chargers are wall-mountable and have the brush-head holder whereas the new ones are smaller and easier to pack for travel but have no wall mount or brush holder.&lt;br /&gt;The new brushes provide the same action, feel and (I believe) speed, so they are a good replacement. They are single-speed, but I never used the low speed on my old brushes anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* I compared the charge-rate capabilities indirectly by winding a coil to fit over the charging pegs and measuring the induced voltages, which were 2:1 (old:new). The actual charge rates were roughly measured for each charger by running the brush to battery exhaustion (the point at which the brush stops running), charging 1 hour, and measuring the run times until reaching exhaustion again (both were equal). This suggests that the new brush has some sort of charge-rate control to prevent over-fast charging, for the sake of battery life.&lt;br /&gt;All in all, a decent brush at a bargain price!</li>
    <li> Regular use of an ultrasonic toothbrush and irrigator combat periodontal disease quite effectively.  Oral-B makes a very good ultrasonic toothbrush.  I&#x27;ve been using it slightly more than a month, and I can already see the results.  I was showing signs of periodontal disease, and that has been reversed.  The plaque buildup is also gone.  Great buy.</li>
    <li> My mother in law bought this for me when I get my braces put on 3 yrs back. It was my first electric and I will NEVER go back to a manual! This makes you feel like you just got your teeth polished every day, and it does wonders for your gums. For as long as I can remember my gums have bled, my mouth is super sensitive. When first using this I still bled, but after a week or two the bleeding ceased and my gums look healthier and are much tougher. When going on trips, if I forget my battery operated Oral B I use a manual toothbrush and even after 2+ minutes of brushing, my teeth still feel gross compared to what this beauty does!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as the unit having an odd shaped head, since I didn&#x27;t buy it from Amazon I have no idea what people are talking about. The heads are interchangeable if you don&#x27;t like one, try another one it&#x27;s not rocket science. And with the unit stopping about 30 seconds into the brushing, mine is only just now starting to experience that on occasion. Make sure the charging port is clean. I cleaned the gunk from mine (eewww) and it charged like it was new. My unit might just be getting a little worn out, so I may have to replace in the near future, but it will definitely be with another Vitality!</li>
    <li> My teeth feel just awesome after using this.  I like the timer feature on it also.  Great product, highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Very satisfied with the performance of the Oral-B Pro rechargeable electric toothbrush.  My teeth very clean and gums feel good.  Excellent dental check-ups.</li>
    <li> I have had one for the last 7 years. Works great to this day. Got one for each family member too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Beats manual brushing by a mile.</li>
    <li> It is a small gift to my sister, it looks good and I have not used yet. Hopes it will as good as it looks.</li>
    <li> My teeth feel like I just got them cleaned at the dentist office! Small, doesn&#x27;t take up much space, would be good to take on trips.</li>
    <li> The toothbrush is great...does an excellent job and has been good for my gums. The one thing I&#x27;ve always found, is that the heads are expensive...but, saying that...keeping your mouth healthy, helps you live longer. So, guess it&#x27;s a good investment in my health.</li>
    <li> This is my third Oral B electric toothbrush in over 20 years.  The other two worked great, but the recharge finally gave up the ghost.  I&#x27;ve only had this toothbrush for about a month, but it seems to work fine.  It seems to be a little more noisy than the others that I&#x27;ve had, but I can live with that.  All in all, I would purchase it again.</li>
    <li> It is well worth the money for a quality toothbrush manufactured by Oral-B.  You can&#x27;t go wrong with this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this for like a year and it still works. Would buy again.</li>
    <li> plug in and go,rechargable battery is very convenient,brushes are much to expensive but last longer than generic brands ,would recommend</li>
    <li> After using the Oral-B for a few months my routine dental cleaning went very quickly.  There was not much work left for the hygienist.</li>
    <li> Everything&#x27;s really great just wish it had a power light so I have a concrete way of knowing it&#x27;s charging.</li>
    <li> This was recommended to me by my dental hygenist and it&#x27;s perfect for me- holds charge well, lets me know when Ive reached the two minute suggested brush time, amd small to fit in between crevices etc.</li>
    <li> Considering the price, it was a good buy. The handle is a little shorter than I would have liked and there is no light indicater on the stand to let you know that it is charging.</li>
    <li> This seems like a good toothbrush and a good value - the only complaint is there is no indicator light to know when it is in the charger or may need recharging if you like to keep it in a drawer and not plugged in all the time. The instruction booklet was very poor too. But it is fine. Just now WOW.</li>
    <li> I am glad that I replaced my 7-year-old Oral-B rechargeable electric toothbrush with yet another Oral-B.  It&#x27;s a great toothbrush, and my dential hygienist will be pleased, I know.</li>
    <li> This replaces an older Oral B whose batteries gave out.  I believe this unit was less expensive to buy than replacement batteries that would have been a pain to replace.  Very happy with this.  Again, great shipping time.</li>
    <li> My last Oral B electric toothbrush finally died and I had to replace it. I&#x27;m very happy with this one!</li>
    <li> Absolutely love it. Worth it.&lt;br /&gt;Reaches hard to reach places and gives your mouth a fresh from the dentist feel.</li>
    <li> I had an early Oral-B electric tooth brush for 15 years or so and it was great.  I unfortunately left it in the hotel on a recent trip.  Of course the hotel couldn&#x27;t find it so I bought a new one.  This one has a feature, the little rubber thing in the middle, which makes my teeth even cleaner and my gums happy.  This new one is even better and I plan to be more careful with it.  IT IS THE GREATEST!  Amazon comes through again!</li>
    <li> I bought one over 12 years ago and it just stopped working. I just repurchased the Vitality. I am and will be a lifelong fan.</li>
    <li> I got it because of the reviews, and now im sooo happy!! my mouth feel so clean and the feeling last longer.  im so happy that im going to give one of this to my dad on his birthday.</li>
    <li> This little device has helped me with my fight against gingivitis and other dental problems beginning the first time I used it. Highly recommend this device, especially recommend it for the price!</li>
    <li> This is one serious toothbrush.  I gets your teeth clean quick.  I do agree with some of the reviewers.  This toothbrush scrubs hard and can cause your gums to bleed the first couple of times of use.  If you aren&#x27;t comfortable with this; I would recommend you find another toothbrush or get a head with softer bristles.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this brush for five months and it does a great job. I highly recommend this tooth brush/</li>
    <li> This is the first electric toothbrush I have ever purchased, and I am extremely pleased. I can see a real difference in using this toothbrush as opposed to the manual ones I used before. I would definitely recommend this one not only for how well it works but for the low cost.</li>
    <li> works great right now.  was a replacement for my older oral-B toothbrush which finally died after a couple of years.  keeps my teeth clean.  good product.</li>
    <li> This has proven to be an excellent electric toothbrush. The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is that it should have a charge light on the charger indicating when it is fully charged.</li>
    <li> I like the way the toothbrush cleans.  The timer is a great option.  I must have read the description wrong because I thought it was a Sonic toothbrush, so I was a little disappointed.</li>
    <li> These toothbrushes just do not work. As soon as you touch it to your teeth it stops rotating and just vibrates. Threw mine away. A total rippoff.</li>
    <li> Works great. Cannot go wrong with an Oral-B product.  :)</li>
    <li> Had to purchase this to replace another that doesn&#x27;t charge consistently after about 3 years. Hope this one lasts longer. The power is great, it comes with a larger brush head than my old one, so I was clacking it against my teeth at first but adjusted after a few days.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a new rechargeable electric toothbrush for both my husband and myself so when I saw this one I ordered us both one!  We love them! They really work well. I received them very quickly! Thanks!</li>
    <li> Bought this toothbrush for my wife who wanted an exact replacement.  The old one lasted a long time, I think about 6 or 7 years.</li>
    <li> I bought this based on a recommendation from my dentist when I asked her about whitening my teeth. She said try this first. Boy did it work, I have mostly coffee stains and this brush does a great job, the yow minute timer is a great reminder about how long to go.  This in combination with arm and hammer toothpaste worked miracles on my teeth.</li>
    <li> Nice, holds good charge.  I like better then the Sonicare I had before it.  The little rubber thing in the middle is a lot different and kind of feels like the dentist polishing tool.</li>
    <li> Wow, talk about cleaning teeth!!!! this is the one to get. Forget all the other ones with the bells and whistles. All you want is one that keeps spinning when you use slight force to push it against the gums and teeth. When you&#x27;re done your teeth and clean and your mouth feels great. This is the one to get. I have two.</li>
    <li> This is my first electric toothbrush and it seems to do the job well. Have had a week and using it 2-3x each day. Only recharged it once, so its working as advertised. I guess we need to see how well it stands the test of time.</li>
    <li> Mom likes it but expensive</li>
    <li> My fiance and I have had Oral B Vitality toothbrushes for years so we have had nothing but good experiences with these toothbrushes in the past.  I&#x27;m giving the toothbrush a single star because we got not one, but TWO toothbrushes that don&#x27;t hold a charge at all!  We followed directions and plugged them in as directed, only for them to literally die mid-brush on our teeth 30 seconds in.  What?!  What a complete waste.  We were so fed up that we&#x27;ve sworn off of these stupid toothrbushes for good...now it&#x27;s on to find something that is actually worth our money.</li>
    <li> This is a good product and worked out well for me.</li>
    <li> I build up a lot of plaque, my dentist says quicker than others. So, he recommended I get an electric tooth brush because they are more powerful. I looked at quite a bit, but I liked the price of this one. However, when I saw how much the replacement heads are ($26 for a pack of three), it makes this brush less valuable to me. The brush made my gums bleed the first two brushes, now my gums are stronger. I do like having an electric toothbrush, I dont really want to go back to a manual. However, you may want to look at others because of how much the price for the replacement heads are. But, I can tell a HUGE difference in the amount of build up I have now. It seriously cleans your teeth better than any manual toothbrush.</li>
    <li> I love my toothbrush! It signals me when two minutes have elapsed so I can stop brushing. It keeps its&#x27; charge. The handle proposes a grip that allows for non slipping. I would recommend it for every tooth brusher. Good price, good merchandise..</li>
    <li> I was excited to get this toothbrush, and being that Oral B is a good brand, I opted to buy it. The toothbrush works well, instructions are easy to understand. Only setback is when it is being charged there is no indication that it is actually charging (No light or anything). But leave it on the charger overnight and you&#x27;ll be fine.</li>
    <li> This is a great toothbrush. Get this instead of a battery operated one. My previous Oral-B exceeded expectations and lasted at least 10 years, very similar to this one. My dentist continually tells me I&#x27;m doing a great job of brushing. Teeth feel super clean after brushing.</li>
    <li> Very powerful battery, it lasts over a week using it twice a day for two minutes each time.  Replaced one (same model) that was four years old and had to charge it nightly (just the past couple of months)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FOR THE PRICE YOU CAN&#x27;T GO WRONG</li>
    <li> I had a couple of Philips Sonicare toothbrushes that I liked until I found the Oral-B Vitality.  The Vitality works much better for me and is half the price.  I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s because my mouth is kind of small (for the size of my teeth) but I am very happy with the Oral-B Vitality.  I must emphasize the Vitality is the model that works better for me.  And my dental hygenist is happy with my improvement in cleaning, less tartar, and less staining of my teeth.  And the Oral-B Vitality was shown in a research study to clean as well as the (twice the price) Philips Sonicare.  Electric toothbrushes are definitely an item that everyone has to find which works best for them (and their needs and comfort), and I guess that is why there are so many versions available.</li>
    <li> For the price this is a great toothbrush.  I had an older, $70&#x27;ish version that I liked a lot so I stuck with the same brand.  If you want all the timers and bells and whistles then spend the extra money, but if you want a good tooth brush for the price this is your brush.</li>
    <li> I like my Oral B electric toothbrush very much I had a sonic toothbrush before and it about vibrated my face off I didn&#x27;t care for that so I went and got this electric toothbrush from Mor Bay I like it much better thank you very much. Bjwolf</li>
    <li> I really like the Oral B Vitality Pro White Rechargeable electric toothbrush.  I used to use an electric one years ago, and then got out of the habit, and went back to a manual brush.  I knew I had liked it, but couldn&#x27;t exactly remember why.  I went to my dental hygienist recently, and she said how much she liked using one.  Well, that got me thinking...went on Amazon.com and thought if I could find one for a reasonable amount, I would splurge.  Let me tell you, it is not a splurge at all, but a necessity.  The price was fair, and the item cleans so much better than a manual, that I couldn&#x27;t believe that I had switched.  The Oral B Vitality is an outstanding product because it does such a thorough job and helps to make my mouth feel very clean and fresh.  I also notice that there is no plaque build up, which was a problem with a manual brush. There is even a timer that tells me when 2 minutes of brushing time has past.  The only problem is the price of the replacement brushes, they are quite expensive.  I will try to stock up when ,and if they ever go on sale.  The price for the product I bought at Amazon.com was half of the cost at the retail stores ....no, I do not work for Amazon.</li>
    <li> Great toot brush! Not much to say...it&#x27;s just a toot brush! It works, came with a replacement brush and battery lasts long.</li>
    <li> I love it because it really helps remove teeth stains due to coffee or tea.. I lke it.. you feel you clean your teeth at the Hygienist.</li>
    <li> My son used his first Braun for over 10 years--it finally wore out.  So I got him a new one.  Price was right--quality is good.  Son is very happy!</li>
    <li> Have used oral-b recharchable toothbrushes in the past and have been very satisfied.  This toothbrush is so loud and very uncomfortable.  It feels like my teeth and gums are being damaged. Used it three times and threw it out.</li>
    <li> This was the cheapest alternative to buy for my son who left his charger in a hotel when he traveled.</li>
    <li> I buy this for 3 times the price in Walmart. If you have one of these toothbrushes, this is a great price.</li>
    <li> I bought a new Oral-B Electric Toothbrush because, after quite a few years, my old one gave up the ghost.  The new one works very well and I have no complaints.</li>
    <li> I love this toothbrush! My dentist recommended it, so I also bought one for each of my daughters. The only suggestion is that it have a cover for the head to keep germs away (or at least make me think it keeps germs away). When you need new heads, DON&#x27;T BUY the generic ones ... they don&#x27;t work and they hurt!</li>
    <li> Probably my favorite thing in my bathroom. That sounds weird, but this is one of the only products I&#x27;ve ever bought that actually changed my habits. I brush my teeth about 50% more than I used to, and I&#x27;m a lot more conscious of my technique. The three dentists that I&#x27;ve asked about electric toothbrushes all said they&#x27;re worth it, i.e. they actually clean better than normal brushes. The charge holds for about a week of 3 brushes a day, at about 2 minutes per session.  This also feels pretty good if you use it to massage your gums.&lt;br /&gt;Basically, just buy it and use your old brush to scrub the tile in your bathroom.</li>
    <li> battery still going strong, hopefully will last long and dont have to replace it again! I have gone trough head replacements but the battery is going strong.</li>
    <li> As I did not realise that the toothbrush was coming from America I was unable to use until I had purchased the appropriate plug adaptor. I may be a little apprehensive about buying in the future, especially things like a bread machine.</li>
    <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;really cuts down on staining and plaque in-between cleanings compared to a regular toothbrush&lt;br /&gt;a great affordable value for the money&lt;br /&gt;replace brush less frequently than manual toothbrush&lt;br /&gt;recharges well by plugging into the wall (don&#x27;t buy batteries)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not as slick looking in design as more expensive electronic brushes&lt;br /&gt;The blue rubber grip may be nice for holding the brush but it makes it harder to clean</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my mom. She prefers an electric toothbrush as she puts less strain on her wrists. Loves her Oral-B Vitality. at this price its definitely worth a buy. I chose this model as its rechargeable. No need to worry about batteries.</li>
    <li> I had the same one for 2 years, back in Europe, and unfortunatelly with the US electric current, it is not working in US, so just because of that I had to get a new one! Great quality for the price!</li>
    <li> Get our teeth squeaky clean!  One use from this brush is equal to a month of brushing with a normal brush.  We love it</li>
    <li> This toothbrush is probably my third in 10 years.  They last a long time, work great and cost very little over time.</li>
    <li> I had an Oral-B which I used for 6-7 years.  Finally, it demanded permanent retirement.  So, I replaced it with this one which is not quite as nice.  My old one had a 4-pause so I knew just how long to clean each area without keeping track.  I miss that feature but for the price, this is great.</li>
    <li> Bought 2 of these, my son&#x27;s works fine, mine slowed down right out of package. Thought batt. was low, charged and still nothing. Used Son&#x27;s charger, realized unit is locked up. Need to send it back for warranty as trash is already gone w/ package. UPDATE Oral B stands behind their product. Went to dentist to get routine cleaning, dentist asked if I stopped smoking, no I said, got a new toothbrush. She was stunned, said my gums look healthier too. Funny, she recommends the over $100 models. Highly recommed!</li>
    <li> This item is exactly as advertised.  It works without a problem.  I had read reviews that said they had problems with the battery compartment getting wet or it not working.  My Oral B is perfect!  I love the 2 minute timer.  It has really improved my brushing and my teeth look awesome!</li>
    <li> They must be having production problems because like many of the other recent reviews, mine was dead on arrival.  Charged it for a good 12-15 hours but got maybe 30 seconds of brushing.  Charged overnight and nothing.  The base gets warm so I know it&#x27;s doing something, but it&#x27;s not charging.</li>
    <li> Best brush ever. Battery works great can brush 7 days 2 times a day before it need to be recharged.</li>
    <li> it comes with small brushes and I would prefer the larger brushes.  I would not recommend this brush with the current brush assortment that comes with it.</li>
    <li> Not as good of quality as I would have expected. The bottom of the handle was peeling a bit and seems to stick on the charger. Not sure if I just got a defective one or they are are like this? This brand is usually great.</li>
    <li> The product is nice to hold and functions as intended. The body feels soft and provide good grip. Very satisfy.</li>
    <li> My old teeth are shining and feel terrific after using the Oral-B Vitality only for two weeks. So glad my hygienist steered me to it.</li>
    <li> The bristles are too hard. We were told years ago to by our dentist and the whole dental field agrees that we should brush with a soft brush. Also the brush is rather large. The head keeps hitting my teeth.  Maybe it&#x27;s because my mouth is not very big, only when talking.......LOL</li>
    <li> This toothbrush cost 25.00 and it is no better than the $5.00 electric. If I could get my money back I would! This model of Oral B is disappointing.</li>
    <li> This electric toothbrush has a problem with the battery. It may not be secure in it&#x27;s fitting. It stops working at certain angles.</li>
    <li> My dentist&#x27;s office has been trying to get me to buy their $90 toothbrush. After rejecting their offer again a couple of months ago, I got online to see what was available. I chose this one because of the low price and the features (I especially like the 2 minute signal that tells me I&#x27;ve brushed long enough).  I can feel the brush clean the area of my teeth adjacent to and just under the gum. After brushing, my teeth feel a bit like they do after a cleaning (a real good thing). This nice little machine has got me brushing twice a day everyday. That was always I chore for me before.</li>
    <li> I have a Philip Sonic Care and I also bought this one, I found this one is adequate for daily use, if you just want to clean your teeth,, this is adequate, not as comfortable as Sonic Care, I also feel the motor motion is rougher and a little bit noisier than Sonic Care.</li>
    <li> This item came in a timely manner.  It was packaged in very sturdy plasic case and was in perfect condition.  My dentist recommended an electric toothbrush and this one is easy to use and brushes are easy to buy and replace.  The battery lasts for a week of better.</li>
    <li> Found this toothbrush to work well. Keeps charge for quite a while, but I find that too much of a charge makes the brush more aggressive than it needs to/should be. That may, however, be the case with most electric toothbrushes. Recommend ordering a couple replacement heads at the same time. Oral-B and other manufactures are notorious for changing their models and replacement heads can be difficult to find sometimes. Yes, I would again purchase.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried different brush heads for my Oral B Vitality toothbrush and I&#x27;ve found that the Prowhite is the best. The Floss Action head is too harsh on my gums, and some of the others are too small. The Prowhite is the perfect size and it&#x27;s not to hard or too soft.</li>
    <li> This toothbrush doesn&#x27;t last long, I charge it every day and it still doesn&#x27;t work as it supposed to. The one I had before (battery operated Walmart brand) was so much better. I have to charge it overnight, I leave it on a base and plugged in at all times because this is the only way it will be working at all (the bristles spin very slow). I will eventually buy some other brand.</li>
    <li> This works great, nice replacement for my old one. Plus they have re-designed the charging base just slightly so it&#x27;s easier to clean. Yay.</li>
    <li> This is my second time purchasing this item.  The first time I bought it was about 10 years ago and it has been working great ever since.  The only reason I&#x27;m replacing it now is because the rubber grip has slowly developed dark spots around the grip ridges that I can&#x27;t seem to get rid of.  That&#x27;s the only reason I&#x27;m rating this 4 stars instead of 5.  I hope in the future they will modify this design to prevent this issue.</li>
    <li> Works as advertised, and is so low cost that if anything does go wrong, it can be replaced without concern.</li>
    <li> Works well, holds a pretty long charge, absolutely fantastic for the price. I&#x27;ve been using this for months without issues. I had a fancier Oral B before that, but the motor seems to have died in it after 8 or 9 years. This brush is good so far, no frills, but that&#x27;s fine. Would highly recommend this, the brushes it comes with alone are almost as much money as the cost of the whole package!</li>
    <li> I have had the top pf the line Oral B for several years and while this one is ok, you can tell the difference in the quality.</li>
    <li> Bought this as a gift for someone and they really liked it. She was greatful the I bought it for her</li>
    <li> I got this toothbrush from my Dentist&#x27;s office. The first one I charged for the full amount of time before trying it. It ran for about 15 seconds then shut off and wouldn&#x27;t go back on. When I&#x27;d push the power button, it&#x27;d click like it was trying to turn on, but it didn&#x27;t. I tried other electric outlets thinking maybe the one I had it plugged into was dead. No luck. I read the instructions to see if there was a way to tell if it was charging on the base. Nope. Then I read others had this problem so I called my dentist&#x27;s office and told them what happened. They offered to switch it for a new one. Great! So I go there and I get a new toothbrush (same Oral Vitality). I charge it for the full amount of time and it runs until I was done brushing. Awesome! Next time I use it, it turns like it wants to run but doesn&#x27;t start. I only got one use out of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided not to get another one. Two different times this product hasn&#x27;t worked and so consider me done with it.</li>
    <li> Awesome toothbrush for a fraction of the cost of the top of the line models.  I&#x27;ve had a $100 sonicare and this works just as good, I bought this one as a gift, I&#x27;ve had mine for over 2 years and it still works as well as it did on day  1.</li>
    <li> My new toothbrush, which replaces the same, earlier model, seems a lot peppier, more thorough, more effective. And I like the single-button control.</li>
    <li> I gifted my adult grandson with this tool, hoping he will make use of it.  I have one and it is great!</li>
    <li> I bought this as a replacement for my Sonicare, which seemed to have pooped out after many years of use. I&#x27;ve always purchased Oral B regular toothbrushes, and they are what my dentist recommends. However, I wasn&#x27;t completely satisfied with this Oral B purchase. It&#x27;s movement is slower than Sonicare, and the brush is harder, so my gums were actually sore from brushing. In the meantime, my Sonicare apparently only needed to &amp;#34;dry out&amp;#34;, and is now working again. The Oral B makes a nice backup option, but I will use my Sonicare as my primary brush. Mechanically, the Oral B works perfectly, and there are other brush options available which might work better for me. When, or if, my Sonicare does eventually die, I will explore the different brushes for the Oral B.</li>
    <li> Delivered as promised. Feels like a well made product. Brush is soft enough so that it does not damage your gums while cleaning.</li>
    <li> Great price and works well.</li>
    <li> Bought this to replace a \\&quot;sonic\\&quot; toothbrush for which I simply could not find the heads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This brush works great, the 2 minute warning is all I need, the charger is small enough to take traveling, but I rarely take it because the battery lasts at least a week. The brush head is not too small or too large, and I have a large head and mouth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And I can buy genuine Oral-B brush heads cheap at my local big box membership store, or you can find many generic heads right here on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just right for me.</li>
    <li> I resisted an electric toothbrush for a long time but my wife kept raving about hers so I finally relented. I was truly amazed at the difference. My teeth feel super smooth just like after visiting the dental hygienist.</li>
    <li> This is the 3rd or 4th toothbrush of this type I&#x27;ve owned over the years.  This new model has upgraded batteries so I hope it will last even longer.  These lower cost models work just as well as ones costing 2 or 3 times more.</li>
    <li> Lo regale a mi hija, ella esta feliz, es facil de usar y Oral B es garantia de buena calidad.</li>
    <li> The product arrived in exactly the time specified.The packing was typical Amazon.Foolproof and sturdy.Well protected and consequently the product was in perfect shape and works well.This is our second Oral B.The last on only lasted 16 years.This one may do as well.I&#x27;m 81 so it may outlast me.</li>
    <li> Pros: holds a charge well, does not take long to charge. comes with 1 replaceable head. The brush head is small so it makes reaching to those tight spots easier. Price is good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: does not have a battery status indicator or a light to let you know when the battery is getting low.</li>
    <li> This is a great product. I was not sure of it until I bought these. Charge comes for a longer period and brushing was never so easy.</li>
    <li> I have bought several brands and types of toothbrushes. trying to find the right product for me, the many products that i have tried all failed in the way or another. I usually give a product a three of lower. Basically giving room for error. Surprisingly I can find nothing wrong with this toothbrush. I would recommend this product for any adult who wants that after the dentist clean feeling.</li>
    <li> I charged this toothbrush for 24 hours after I received it.  I then used it for the first time, and it ran great for 30 seconds.  Then it quit running.  I charged it another 24 hours, but it would not turn on or run at all.  So I had to return it.</li>
    <li> last one lasted 16 years, this is reason I chose this brand, works as intended, is good quality and cleans teeth better than by hand</li>
    <li> i been using this toothbrush for 2 yrs. now and its still in good condition, i think i used this more than the sonicare i bought (it broke for the last 6 mos.)  great job, oral-b!</li>
    <li> I wanted a little more power than I get from just hand brushing and I didn&#x27;t want to go for a $100 toothbrush. The Oral-B Vitality works really well. I like that it comes equipped with a timer to ensure you don&#x27;t go over two minutes. If you do go for too long, your teeth start to feel as if you took off stuff that wasn&#x27;t supposed to be brushed away. One issue is that no matter how much I dry it off after brushing, there is still always a white caked stain under the base. The second issue is that there is a pretty long cord that needs to be plugged in to keep it charged. This is something to keep in mind. The only plug in my bathroom is next to the medicine cabinet, so I ended up with a long white cord hanging down the side of my mirror. This is not an issue for people who can hide the cord.</li>
    <li> The brush arrived safely. More importantly it works. My dental Hygiensit recomeded this brush. The small brushes get inside the groves and seems to do a better job in getting rid of the leftover food .</li>
    <li> We have used this budget conscious electric tootbrush for years. This will be our 3rd one. It is great and leaves the surface of the teeth feeling clean and smooth. Don&#x27;t like the large heads that come in this pack, but they do the job. The only complaint is how crazy expensive the replacement heads are.</li>
    <li> What a clean feeling, like after a dental cleaning. Thisis the third Oral B I purchased. I would not do without one. To bad the replacement brushes are a bit pricey.</li>
    <li> Replaced an 10 year old one that I dropped &amp; broke.  It is quite a bit more powerful than the last.</li>
    <li> It came on time, in great condition and was exactly what I wanted.  There was no problems with this.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you very much</li>
    <li> This was a replacement for defunct same product and it works well as expected.  Price is right and product does the job.</li>
    <li> We have had a vitality for over 5 years and it is just beginning to feel a bit slow.  This new vitality is much stronger and will actually last for 2 weeks out of the charger.  I can&#x27;t imagine what the more expensive models can offer you over this one.  All of the Oral-B brushes fit.</li>
    <li> I have just received this electric toothpaste; I have brushed with it 2xs.  I really notice a difference in how clean my teeth feel.  I also like the fact the brush shutdown once you have brushed for 2 minutes.  With a manual brush, I never used a timer and I am sure I did not brush long enoungh.  This is the best experience I have had with tooth brushing.  I would recommend this to anyone.  My dentist really likes the Oral B brand and I now see why.</li>
    <li> Bought my first Vitality pro over 4 years ago and it&#x27;s just now starting to require recharging after just one brushing. The new one works perfectly, just as the first. It&#x27;s actually fun to use, very effective, and I like the reminder I get when I&#x27;ve brushed 2 minutes.  I can&#x27;t imagine  going back to a &amp;#34;regular&amp;#34; toothbrush. Use this after every meal and floss once a day, and your dentist&lt;br /&gt;is probably going to tell you you&#x27;re doing something right-keep it up.</li>
    <li> My old Oral B no longer would hold a charge. It was a good toothbrush, so I looked to Oral B for a replacement. This model is nothing like my old one. The head is bigger, oval instead of round. I have a small mouth, and I am constantly hitting the upper side of my teeth with the plastic edge, and vice versa. I never had that happen with the old one. I don&#x27;t feel that I can brush the inside of my incisors very well because the head is too big when I hold the brush horizontally to clean these teeth. Also, the noise and vibration from this unit is very jarring. I am going to find another round head because after only a week&#x27;s use of this one, I am ready to trash it.</li>
    <li> This model was recommended to me by a dental hygienist at the dental clinic I go to, so I had high hopes for it. Unfortunately, like many others here, I received a unit that did not function and I did not find out until the packaging had been discarded (and honestly, the return shipping would have been more trouble than it&#x27;s worth). Out of the box, the unit ran well for about 30 seconds, then shut off. I placed it on the charger for the recommended 16 hours and then experienced the same thing when I went to use it in earnest for the first time. 30 seconds of brushing, then grinding to a dead halt. I repeated the charging procedure, this time for a full 24 hours. Same frustrating results. Another 24 hours, same dead brush after 30 seconds. I went out and purchased the same item from my local grocery store. It looks different, came with different brush heads, and even included coupons in the packaging. I suspect the item being sold on Amazon is a bogus knockoff brush that isn&#x27;t manufactured to the same standards as the original. Very disappointed! I expect a sham like this on eBay, but I expected better from Amazon sellers.</li>
    <li> This is great as always have been. I switched ti electric brush 7 years ago and have sticked with it every since</li>
    <li> I have used the Oral B toothbrush for well over a decade the battery was only supposed to last for 5 years but  I made it last for 11 or 12 years so when that one finely died I knew I wanted the same brand again so off to Amazon I went Ionly paid 26.00 for it and if you consider it lasted 11 or 12 years Oral B is well worth it</li>
    <li> We have used the Oral B electric toothbrushes for a long time. They are very good but the batteries do not last forever. So we have to get a new one after a few years. I am glad they have an inexpensive style.</li>
    <li> This is one of the more basic models and it works really well This is my second Oral B and I really like the 2 minute timer, it is a good addition to an already quality appliance. The first one lasted 9 years so I have no complaints. This one seems to have more power, it really leaves my whole mouth feeling clean and fresh.</li>
    <li> These are very good in quality. They get the job done just as they should. would recommend for friends. very good</li>
    <li> I purchased the Oral-B Vitality which was recommended by my hygienist. It works great.  It vibrates a little more than I like but it is working out just fine.</li>
    <li> I felt like I had just left the dentist, My seven year old wants one.  I purchased one of the cheaper Oral B brushes because I didnt want to invest in something expensive right away and I&#x27;m glad I did. This may have been one of the least expensive ones but upgrading from a manual I would never know.  I can tell that after a few more weeks my teeth should be very very white.</li>
    <li> This toothbrush works well for my children. It holds a change much longer than expected. I see no reason to spend money on the expensive versions. This toothbrush is more then inadequate.</li>
    <li> great toothbrush.  this replaces the same model which i&#x27;ve been using for years.  dentist says my teeth &amp; gums look great.</li>
    <li> This is a great toothbrush to help get rid of plaque.Nothing will ever replace flossing&lt;br /&gt;but this is a great tool to help.</li>
    <li> My wife likes it and she says that it works very well with no issues.  She likes the 2 minute timer that&#x27;s built into the toothbrush.  She says it keeps her teeth clean and fresh.</li>
    <li> Product works as advertised.  I was using an Oral-B with a perfectly round brush and this one is oval.  Can&#x27;t say that I like the oval as well, but it works.</li>
    <li> A toothbrush such as this was highly recommended by my dental hygenist. It does a great job on my teeth, but the small head does not hold enough toothpaste to also cover the roof of my mouth and my tongue.  I do a \\&quot;quick\\&quot; all-over brush with a regular toothbrush, followed by a \\&quot;detail\\&quot; brush with this instrument.</li>
    <li> I have owned expensive electric brushes and was pleasantly surprised when the Oral-B seemed to have just as much power and does an awesome job.  Would definitely buy again!</li>
    <li> My entire family now has these.  This one I got for my husband.  Do a great job cleaning my teeth and the one I have had has lasted for so long I cant remember how long I have had it (at least 6 to 7 yrs).  The replacement heads are not cheap otherwise I would have given 5 stars.</li>
    <li> I have used the Oral B line of electric toothbrushes for almost 11 years. This is my 2nd Vitality but this comes with a different head (the ProWhite) than the Floss-Action Vitality that seems to be No Longer Available. My old Vitality is still working fine and it will be used as a back-up; the only reason I purchased this one is that the $7 off coupon that Amazon provided made it almost as cheap to buy a complete new toothbrush set rather than buying only the replacement brush heads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OK, let&#x27;s get onto the review.  Once I got it out of the worst clamshell package I&#x27;ve ever tried to open it&#x27;s a great toothbrush!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Vitality model is a less expensive model than the Professional Oral B line which most, I believe, have a quadrant-timer than just the plain 2 minute timer.  I prefer the plain 2 minute timer as I constantly move the brush around inside my mouth and I feel every surface area is fully covered during the 2 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I prefer the smaller brush heads, such as what&#x27;s included with the Vitality models, since my mouth is on the small side and the larger heads just don&#x27;t fit right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I do like:&lt;br /&gt;&gt;&gt; The two minute timer is the BEST feature of all. Unless you have a timer, you are not brushing your teeth long enough. Trust me on this.&lt;br /&gt;&gt;&gt; I love the rubber grip handle. My old Oral B did not have this, and it was slippery to hold onto.&lt;br /&gt;&gt;&gt; Will go over a week between charges. I keep it off the charger until it needs recharging - I recommend keeping it off the charger instead of \\&quot;use it once/recharge it/use it once/recharge it. That wears the battery down quicker. The instructions say to let the battery completely drain down every 6 months, I do it more often, and I think this helps contribute to a longer-lasting brush-head.&lt;br /&gt;&gt;&gt; Feels like a professional teeth-cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I do NOT like:&lt;br /&gt;&gt;&gt; The clam-shell packaging this comes in has to be the worst I&#x27;ve ever encountered. This one was even worse than the last Vitality I ordered. I guess they err on the side of caution for a health-related product. If you ever have the option of choosing this with frustration-free packaging, get that one instead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hate visiting my dentist. Since I&#x27;ve been using these Oral B brushes, dental visits for anything other than a professional cleaning haven&#x27;t happened!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The following Oral B brush heads will fit this model:&lt;br /&gt;1.

    <li> The toothbrush works well, but the base gets grimy quickly.</li>
    <li> I LOVE ORALB BRUSHES WHEN I GO TO THE DENTIST TO GET A CLEANING IT ONLY TAKES 5 MIN. COOL</li>
    <li> Only major complaint I have is the gunk that collects at the bottom of the replaceable head -- have yet to find a good way to keep that from collecting.</li>
    <li> Simple toothbrush with two minute vibration reminder. It takes little counter place even with the charger. The only con would be the length of a single charge. you need to charge it after 6 brushes so that&#x27;s just three days. It still has power after but is not strong.</li>
    <li> I have one of the original spin brush. Truly makes a difference in your check ups&lt;br /&gt;My original started to do some funky things, not sure why. It would&#x27;nt turn off, but would stop if I put it back on the charger.&lt;br /&gt;After a year, some how some way it healed itself! Will turn on and off using the push buttons, but now it does not spin&lt;br /&gt;nearly as fast. Didn&#x27;t waste any time replacing with a newer generation of spin brush</li>
    <li> This is a great toothbrush for a great price. It is the first rechargeable toothbrush I&#x27;ve had, and I&#x27;m so glad I got it. With normal batteries the toothbrush starts to run slower and not work as well as the batteries get older. With this brush however, you can always keep it well powered without having to worry about batteries. The charger is also a great place to store it, as you can easily unplug it if you want to save on energy. I keep mine plugged in most of the time, because if I don&#x27;t I can tell a difference in power in about two days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only bad thing I have to say is that over time the charger gets gross from water falling down the toothbrush. If you are careful you can prevent this, but I would rather just clean it every once and a while. You can wipe it down with a wet cloth to clean, but you are not supposed to submerge it in water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a two minute timer that starts automatically when you turn it on. When it hits the two minute mark it will vibrate differently a few times to let you know. I usually turn it on and off a few times while brushing though, so I don&#x27;t really use this function. I *think* it starts over every time it&#x27;s turned on and off but I haven&#x27;t tested it for sure. So either that or I just never brush my teeth for two minutes. (It&#x27;s actually a pretty long time...) It would be nice if you could change the timer but you can&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the head it comes with:&lt;br /&gt;Good for sensitive teeth, but I&#x27;ve found the \\&quot;floss\\&quot; replacement head to work better for me. I&#x27;m not sure if it actually helps teeth get whiter but it does a good job of cleaning them and you feel like you get the \\&quot;dentist brush\\&quot; treatment. I think this head would be better for occasional polishing rather than everyday cleaning.</li>
    <li> I love this toothbrush. It has good power. Oral-B changed the shape and size of the charger and I like it.  It is now smaller compared to the older ones.</li>
    <li> Purchased for a gift for my daughter.  She really llikes it.  Works great.  Comfortable to use also.  Brushes are good too.</li>
    <li> perfect product!&lt;br /&gt;love it!&lt;br /&gt;I had it before and lost it in a trip,&lt;br /&gt;happy to have it again!&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!</li>
    <li> Got this for a christmas gift for my boyfriend. Couldnt believe the great feal i got on it and it was exactly what he wanted.&lt;br /&gt;He got the brush and i was greatlynappreciated for it :)</li>
    <li> As expected, this turned out to be a great and inexpensive replacement for a worn out Oral-B electric toothbrush, but the product&#x27;s plastic clamshell packaging took both scissors and a knife to open.</li>
    <li> I have owned the Oral-B Vitality brush for several years.  It has served me well and continues to do so.  I recently ordered one for my wife to replace a similar aging electric brush by the same manufacturer that just wore out from use.  The charging unit on the new one even has a smaller footprint than my two year old unit.&lt;br /&gt;The first one arrived DOA (dead).  Those things happen.  I ordered a replacement unit on Saturday and it was in my mailbox on Monday.  Can&#x27;t beat that.&lt;br /&gt;In addition to 5 stars for the toothbrush I give Amazon 5 stars for great service.</li>
    <li> This is my second vitality rechargeable, the first one having lasted eight years. It actually still works but is slowed down a bit and I felt it was time for a new one and was pleased to see that there still selling that line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These aren&#x27;t really fancy with a lot of bells and whistles, but, they are long-lasting and do the job. The shape and size hasn&#x27;t seemed to change much, however the charging base is a little bit smaller, and the brushing head replacement is as easy as ever, with replacements being affordable and readily available.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had my brush a few days now and look forward to hopefully getting eight years out of this one, if this one last nearly as long as the first one it will work out to being a lot cheaper than buying eight years worth of manual toothbrushes.</li>
    <li> This toothnrush is the best electric brush i have had in a long time. regular toothbrushes do not clean the way this brush does. awesome brush. I have braces and it gets into the spaces my regular brush didnt.</li>
    <li> The unit works great. Just don&#x27;t like that the replacement heads are so expensive.</li>
    <li> a little expensive for tooth brush</li>
    <li> Great price and my husbands likes it!</li>
    <li> This is our all time favorite electric toothbrush.  We came back after using sonicare, which I hated, and are glad we did.  Very dependable product for a good price.  Love it.</li>
    <li> I bought this in July to replace one of my older Vitality brushes, which I like, and luckily I still have one.  I didn&#x27;t use the new unit until yesterday morning, Sept.17th, after charging it all night.  The older model had two switches, one for OFF and the other for ON, which also acts as a timer.  This newer unit has a single switch for ON and OFF, and it is an annoying and limited timer that will automatically shut off while I prefer that it remain ON.  No matter how many times I press the button, it won&#x27;t reset and restart.  I recharged it again overnight; it overheated and is as dead as a nail.  It&#x27;s total junk.  Now, come on, Braun Vitality, you&#x27;ve ruined a perfectly good tool.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can think of several reasons why the versatility of the original design was better.  One: It worked.  Secondly, you may want to clean your teeth or any other object for more than a few seconds.  Thirdly, these little brushes were also good for removing tough dirt from small objects and hard to reach places, so yes, I would want it to run for a longer time, if it worked.  Finally, after you wash the brush clean, reactiviting the vibration helps to shake off excess water, hence extending the life of the brush; you can&#x27;t do that with a dead brush.  Give us back the original design!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this type toothbrush for years. It&#x27;s my 3rd one. It charged up nicely, is holding a charge for over a week now. Has a lot of power, almost too much. I got to really hold tight on a full charge. I wish the bristles were softer. the bristles were softer with my last vitality.  I find the trick to making the brushes last longer is not to press down when your brushing, there is no need to, that&#x27;s why you have an electric toothbrush, let the brush do the work. I really didn&#x27;t need to replace the whole unit, I just wanted to replace the brushes, but for ten dollars more, I got a whole new unit and 2 brush heads and it holds a charge longer than my old one, and I guess because it is old.  I never tried the generic brushes, maybe I should have. I will with this one when the time comes.  It is still worth the purchase. I can&#x27;t see spending big bucks for other brand units that really do the same thing.</li>
    <li> You just can&#x27;t beat this toothbrush, especially for the price. It does a great job, holds a charge well, and my dentist loves these things, as well.</li>
    <li> looking for Oral-B vitality pro white rechargeable electric toothbrush?&lt;br /&gt;this is it!&lt;br /&gt;cheapest I found on the web and off web&lt;br /&gt;works great</li>
    <li> Good at this price. Timing and wireless charging are just useful. Sometimes could be used too &amp;#34;hard&amp;#34;, should be more careful.</li>
    <li> I love the fact that I do not have to keep changing batteries and the brush heads are firm.  This is a great product and will continue buying this same product in the future.</li>
    <li> This gift was what I expected and arrived in plenty of time. The person who received it was very pleased.</li>
    <li> I started using this product as a result of spending TOO much time in the dentist chair having my teeth cleaned.&lt;br /&gt;The Oral-B&#x27;s are just great.  Bought this for a family member.  I have been using this product for about 1 year and I can tell you &amp;#62;&amp;#62;These brushes get the junk out, keep the tartar level VERY LOW and improve the health of your gums. I&#x27;m now spending less time at the dentist with my last two scheduled cleanings. Have to get the hang of it..be a liitle careful at first as I was spraying toothpaste all over the mirror and sink.  You turn it on when it&#x27;s in your mouth near your teeth!!&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend this product and just wish I started with an electric brush years ago.  Do have to change out the brush head every three months.</li>
    <li> Got this to replace the one we had for 2 years.  Nice product.  I like that it doesn&#x27;t require batteries</li>
    <li> I have bought this product over a number of years.  It does a great job of cleaning my teeth and keeping my dental bills low!  It is reliable and easy to use.  I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used an electric brush in years, but have been very pleased with The Oral-B Vitality Pro.  Vigorous action, easy cleaning, forever battery, and good price.  Can&#x27;t ask for more than that.</li>
    <li> Exactly what the description says. Don&#x27;t know why I never used an electric toothbrush before. This is amazing :) teeth are so squeaky clean.</li>
    <li> I have been skeptical about electric toothbrushes and didn&#x27;t want to pay a lot for one. This brush arrived on time and loved it from the moment I first tried it. My teeth feel clean as if I had a cleaning from the dentist. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> This toothbrush is a great value.  I had to replace my old electric toothbrush and this is a great replacement.  It really makes your teeth feel like you just left the dentist.  The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because I wish it had a small, skinny, floss like head like my old one that got in between my teeth.  Other than that I&#x27;m extremely happy with my purchase!</li>
    <li> I bought it for travel.  It died in 1 week.  After returning home, I cannot return it for refund.  I bought another Oral-B at Walmart and it died in the first day.  Where is quality control.  Do not buy!!!</li>
    <li> We were having a hard time getting my grandson to brush his teeth properly or at all when we discovered this toothbrush. Now he, his dentist and his parents are thrilled with this good investment!</li>
    <li> i am using this product more than year, it works perfects, cleans fantastic, high quality, once i drop it but nothing happend, stil works well :)</li>
    <li> i will be purchasing for my other family members soon. it feels like you just came out a dentist office with a real good cleaning.</li>
    <li> This electric brush does a great job compared to traditional brushing. My teeth feel clean like I was just at the dentist. The charge is good for a few days, but it does loose power after not being on the charger for one day. I like the faster rotations that a fresh charge produces. I would like a faster rotation, actually, but for the money, this really does a great job.</li>
    <li> This is really a good toothbrush. On my last visit to the dentist he gave it his stamp of approval (I didn&#x27;t even tell him which toothbrush, he said so by the way my teeth looked). I had to replace my last one because the battery wouldn&#x27;t hold a charge after several years of use. I prefer the precision tip so I can get back behind my very last teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was surprised at how long the battery lasted out of the charger while I was on vacation. Even though I was only gone for a few days and the toothbrush was brand new, it stayed pretty strong. As the battery breaks in I&#x27;m sure it won&#x27;t last that long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In closing, I definitely recommend this toothbrush. There may be better ones out there, but this absolutely works. And works well.</li>
    <li> I am not crazy about it...the brush is too small..not easy to manuever...i don&#x27;t feel as if it does a great job of cleaning...was thinking of sending it back...any other recommendations???</li>
    <li> I will never use a regular toothbrush again!  Love these inexpensive products...and clean teeth really well with little effort on my part!</li>
    <li> What a great deal for a toothbrush that works great! It gets the hard to get spots and makes me feel squeaky clean. It&#x27;s a little rough when you first start out, but your mouth toughens up. Would totally recommend, fantastic little toothbrush! (also comes with a spare!)</li>
