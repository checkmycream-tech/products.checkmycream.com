<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Gold Bond products are top notch.  They all work better for my than any lotion.</li>
    <li> I have such dry sensitive skin and this stuff is perfect for it, goes on thick, last long and does not irritate my skin. DH finger tips split really bad and although there really isn&#x27;t anything on the market that help them heal fast, GB&#x27;s lotion does a pretty good job.</li>
    <li> Makes me skin feel so soft and alive</li>
    <li> I love this lotion. It makes your hands feel silky but not greasy. It&#x27;s my go-to lotion. I&#x27;m totally gunna buy it again.</li>
    <li> I agree wholeheartedly with all the other reviews.  There just isn&#x27;t a better product on the market.  I am in my early 50&#x27;s and remember \\&quot;Gold Bond\\&quot; as a product my grandmother used.  I also remember it not having the most pleasant of smells when applied.  This lotion is marvelous feeling going on and hours later still feeling the same.  I have \\&quot;normal\\&quot; skin with dryness in the \\&quot;T\\&quot; zone.  This product has made my hands look like a teenagers again.    I have tried MANY products - both MORE expensive and the same price and nothing compares.  I am hopeful that the manufacturer of this product realizes what they have on their hands and won&#x27;t change the ingredients or stop making this product.  I paid $8.00 for mine.  I just hope the price doesn&#x27;t sky rocket - but you know - I&#x27;m always willing to pay for a product that works.</li>
    <li> I have extremely dry skin and this seems to be the only lotion that helps. This is a very good product that helps eliminate dry skin without that greasy feel.</li>
    <li> The lotion is great  for the neck area and the arms. After about two weeks of using the lotion on the neck, there is a visible difference  with less wrinkles. Best lotion I have used, and I have tried many of them. This is the best</li>
    <li> This lotion is the only thing that works for my dry hands!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is even better than some prescription steroid creams from my dermatologist. I highly Recommend this one!</li>
    <li> Though I have started using it just recently I am convinced of its richness. It certainly works miracles for dry skins without making them greasy or oily. I think this is the wonder therapy for dry skins.</li>
    <li> I love this lotion....I do not have rough skin to start but it does get dry and itchy this lotion keeps me from being dry or itchy from the time I put it on my skin til I take my next shower. It has a soft light scent so if you wear perfume it will not affect that and it you don&#x27;t or can&#x27;t it smells great on it own. It&#x27;s my new must have. I love this lotion.</li>
    <li> Happy with moisture content. Pirce is a little expensive. I could go with Jergens shea butter but I would still recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Great for softening skin and feels so good on your hands when applying it. I use it on my feet and it does a really good job of keeping my feet soft.</li>
    <li> It arrived on time! And the lotion is amazing, keep my skin extra hydrated about 24 hours. Love it!</li>
    <li> Gold Bond is the best around. If you&#x27;ve got dry skin and you don&#x27;t want to smell too flowery, you can&#x27;t go wrong. It&#x27;s super thick yet it dissolves quickly right into your skin so you don&#x27;t look or feel greasy. Even after you&#x27;ve wash your hands, they still feel moisturized. You don&#x27;t need a lot; this cream is RICH a little goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;if you&#x27;ve got a manboy or just a regular boy in your house who doesn&#x27;t like to wear creams because they leave him \\&quot;stinky\\&quot; then this is the lotion for him.</li>

    <li> Product is great, I have purchased several times before however, this is the first time I was sent #1 instead of #2 bottles. I was very disappointed to find this out as I had purchased off my old order to be sure I got the right product.

Doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy feeling like another brand so I am not running to wash the excess off right after application.</li>
