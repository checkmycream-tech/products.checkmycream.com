<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Absolutely no effect, the white film left on skin doesn&#x27;t do anything.  I should have made sure if there are pics of before-after, before buying.</li>
    <li> I have tried everything to help me with my awful puffy under eye area! I tried all sorts of creams and make up concealers and tricks.&lt;br /&gt;This product is simply the best thing I have ever found! I wish they made it for the whole body!&lt;br /&gt;The first time I used it, I almost didn&#x27;t recognize myself without the puffy eyes!&lt;br /&gt;I have found if I really shake it or alternately squeeze the top then the bottom of the tube to mix, I never find a problem with a whiteness showing. Plus I use a tiny bit for each eye.&lt;br /&gt;I have never felt compelled to write a review on anything, but this product is the best! I am so thankful I found it!&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t go out go the house without it. Without makeup yes, but not without my miracle worker!&lt;br /&gt;PS. I am 60 years old if that helps anyone. Not a cute 35 year old who thinks she looks old!</li>
    <li> Who wants to see bags under your eyes??  no one if you are vain.  This product will help and lasts a very long time.... use it sparingly!!</li>
    <li> Did not work as expected.  Will not order again.</li>
    <li> Very concentrated so a little goes a long way.  The stuff will start tightening skin in around 30 seconds if used alone.  You&#x27;ll have to experiment with how much or how little to use.  Every person&#x27;s skin reacts differently.  If used alone you will most likely get some white residue when it dries.  Just moisten the white areas with a little water and blend it in.  The tightening effect will be diminished a bit, but is still effective.  I have found that mixing the product with a small dab of face cream (everyone has their own favorite) keeps the white residue from appearing--and you still get the tightening.  Again you&#x27;ll need to experiment until you find that right balance and that works best for you.  Like any type of make-up this is not a one-size fits all product.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for over 3 years, it works for me, temporary but I use it everyday!!</li>
    <li> I bought this because it was advertised on dr oz show or some other show, anyway dont waste your money , you apply the product on your face and it turns white and it feels like superglue on your skin</li>
    <li> One of my wife&#x27;s favorites and hard to find locally.  Price was excellent</li>
    <li> I hated this product. Once on it dries to a white chalk on your eyes no matter how sparingly it is applied. Useless waste of money.</li>
    <li> I am always a skeptic when \\&quot;celebrities\\&quot;(not that Dr. Oz is one..)recomend a product. However in the past he has been right on as far as suppliments/vitamins are concerned.  I have for almost all my adult life had the excess bags under my eyes....so when he recommended Firmx I wanted to try it....well it really works!  You just need to put a very small dab on and make sure you work it in,or  there will be a slight residue.  I was impressed!</li>
    <li> I heard Dr. Oz say that he used it on his undereye bags and it helped. I CANNOT SEE THAT IT HELPED AT ALL.</li>
    <li> received product quickly. Product works exactly as indicated and demostrated on the Dr. Oz show where i first saw it.  I&#x27;m very satisfied with the product and shipping timeline.</li>
    <li> Be careful when using this product. The third time I used this product I received a minor skin burn under my left eye.</li>
    <li> absolutely 100% satisfied and beyond</li>
    <li> didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars because it doesn&#x27;t last all day.</li>
    <li> It definitely works!!!  A little drying so make sure to use moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe the reviewers who throw out a few words like &amp;#34;doesn&#x27;t work.  Waste of money.&amp;#34;  ??  Really??  I&#x27;ve tried SO many facial products - serums, lotions, peels, etc.  I&#x27;m in my 50&#x27;s and THIS product is AMAZING!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I need to work with it more re: makeup application/types of makeup to use with it.  But this product does what it says.  I was reading Beautypedia/Paula&#x27;s Choice reviews on Peter Thomas Roth products - and they noted that this company just uses ingredients that are effective - they don&#x27;t add ancillary ingredients just to try to make a product sound good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have fine lines &amp; wrinkles under my eyes - crows feet, etc., and this is the closest to Botox/Dysport that I&#x27;ve found.  Really, I&#x27;ve not found a topical skin care product that&#x27;s even remotely effective in tightening/firming.  None.  And I&#x27;ve spent SO much $$ trying to find the holy grail.  This is my HG.  I do like Dysport now &amp; then as well, but it&#x27;s so pricey that I rarely go that route.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This FirmX DOES tighten, it DOES firm, and it pretty much erases lines and wrinkles.  You can feel the tightness as it&#x27;s working, and it is a little bit drying.  I don&#x27;t mind.  This WORKS.  I shall never, ever be without it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I shake tube, put a pea-sized amt on back of my hand, then dab a tiny amt onto thin/flat &amp;#34;foundation&amp;#34; brush, &amp; lightly apply to cleansed skin around eyes and smile lines.  Within about 7 minutes.... MAGIC!!  It works!  It&#x27;s AMAZING!  There&#x27;s a good YouTube tutorial on application, and if you get some whitish, or light residue, you can dab a moistened q-tip on the area - just LIGHTLY dab it on any white (which you might not even need to do), and it doesn&#x27;t remove the efficacy of the product, it just removes the light residue.</li>
    <li> Product tightened the eye area, but left a dried white residue on the area that it was placed.  My cover up make up did hide that though.  All in all it was good.</li>
    <li> UPDATE FEB 2016: Well ladies I&#x27;m one of the biggest supporters of this product, however I must have gotten a bad tube or something, and it says I have passed the window of opportunity to return it... This particular tube I got in December has burnt the holy heck of my under eye bags area. At first I thought I was doing something wrong but I&#x27;ve been using this product forever and this is the only tube that has hurt my eyes so bad I&#x27;ve considered seeing a dermatologist.&lt;br /&gt;BUYER BEWARE if it burns really really bad over an extended period of time return your product before the 30 day period I waited too long thinking I was doing something wrong until I realized there&#x27;s just something wrong with this particular tube and it&#x27;s still pretty full!!! I wish the seller would consider changing for a new tube since I am such a huge advocate of this product.&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE March 28th, 2016: I am still using the same tube that was burning my under eye area.. I just cannot force myself to throw it away!! However, I went on Amazon and found some really good eye cream and apply it every night and every day when I am not using the FIRMx..this has helped tremendously! Did I get a &amp;#34;bad tube&amp;#34;? I am not 100% sure! What I do know, my under eyes were burnt badly!  BUT not anymore with the new cream!! This is the EYE Cream I bought! &amp;#62;&amp;#62;&amp;#62; Rejuvenating Eye Cream with Organic Coconut Oil, Vitamin C and MSM for Your Best Defense Against Wrinkles and Fine Lines - Coco Luxe by Michelle Staff...  I use it nightly or when I am not using the FIRMx,,</li>
    <li> I saw this product on the Dr. Oz show; Dr. Oz himself demonstrated the product by comparing one under eye bag with the Peter Thomas Roth Instant FIRMx applied and the other under eye bag without the FIRMx.  I was very impressed with the difference.  I immediately ordered FIRMx and it does tighten up the eye area. The big problem is the residue left behind when the product dries.  I have tried carefully blotting the residue away, mixing it with a little moisturizer and nothing works.  By the time I have removed the white, flaking residue the product is gone and my under eye area is red and swollen.  I would not recommend purchasing FIRMx Eye.</li>
    <li> A little does go a long way!  White residue shows up later in the day-beware if you don&#x27;t wear make up.  Is awesome for temporary tightening.  Not sure if there is any long term effect.  Once I figured out how much to use, I liked it much better.</li>
    <li> it really works and makes you feel younger. The only thing is that when you smile it makes weird creases under the eye. When no expression, takes away bags, and wrinkles under the eye. Works on frown line the best! Takes away wrinkles and doesn&#x27;t mess with expression in the least bit.</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS PRODUCT!! I saw it on Dr. Oz and yes it really does work yOu only need a little and might need to put a little face cream on after it dries.just so its not really tight and leaving a white patch which will happen if you put to much.haha I learned the hard way..it will last forever cause you use so little..</li>
    <li> Love this product the trick is to apply the minimal amount to achieve maximum results. I will definitely buy more if this miracle eye cream that makes the bags under my eyes disappear. Well worth the money.</li>
    <li> After I saw Dr Oz singing the praises of this product on his show -  saying he and his wife both use it to look &amp;#34;camera&amp;#34; ready for the show and other events, I thought &amp;#34;wow. must try this&amp;#34; so I bought some.  I read the reviews but I guess i should have paid more attention.  I carefully read the directions and tried it.  It made my eyes dry and crusty looking.  Even when diluting with water.  I wanted to throw it out the window but it cost so much that it would hurt to toss it. I skipped the under eye treatment since my bags aren&#x27;t that bad and concentrated on crows feet and fine lines.  No luck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reviewers that say maybe this is not a good product for those under the age of 60 are in my opinion correct.  I have purchased eye products  that gave me fantastic eye firming results at less than half the price of this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I won&#x27;t toss it, I will give it away to someone OVER 60 that it may work well on.</li>
    <li> Decided to order this product after seeing Dr Oz tout its efficacy on his TV program.  It will work on mildly puffy eyes. However you have to apply it sparingly. If not it has a gray cast and peels off.</li>
    <li> Under eye bags did disappear but left a white residue. All of the reviews in reference to the white residue are absolutely true</li>
    <li> I have bought two tubes, one for me and other for BFF Birthday . We LOVE it!  I will contuine to buy this product when I run out.</li>
    <li> works great, but try and get rid of the ikky white dust residue, wasnt worth my effort</li>
    <li> Product came as described.  Purchased it for my Mother who really likes it.  You can see a difference immediately after applying.</li>
    <li> http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004P2LL2K/ref&#x3D;cm_cr_rev_prod_title&lt;br /&gt;This truly is only an instant firming cream. I think it&#x27;s too strong for the skin around my eyes and gives me a \\&quot;Botox look\\&quot;. I probably need a PREVENTATIVE type of treatment as opposed to this FIX. Someone who already has fine lines/crows feet and sagging eyelids may appreciate this. It&#x27;s a bit too strong for me and I don&#x27;t want to keep using it to see if it has any long term benefit.</li>
    <li> This product does work, but you have to be sure to just apply a thin film, or it will form a white crust.  Sometimes I do have trouble applying the right amount, but I do like it and will purchase more when I have used up my tube.  It is the only product I have ever used that actually does reduce my under-eye puffiness.  One thing though, communication with the manufacturer is VERY POOR.  I sent them an email question, waited two weeks &amp; didn&#x27;t receive an answer to my email, then sent them another email.  I then gave up, since I didn&#x27;t hear back from them.  Then, TWO MONTHS later, I finally got an answer to my email, answering both of my questions and apologizing for the delayed response.  TWO MONTHS - that is rediculous!</li>
    <li> It does tighten the  under eye drastically,  however if you wear foundation, or under eye concealer it will look like crusty film.  But if you don&#x27;t wear those then maybe it&#x27;s ur ticket. . and no under eye lotion. ..</li>
    <li> Peter Roth Instant  Firm Eye was a great buy especially for the price compared to other sites where it is 15 to 20 dollars higher. I was able to apply about the amount or size of the tip of a #2 lead pencil to my pinky finger under my eye area and my puffiness diminshed almost instantly. The only cons to this product was that it does not appear to diminsh the fine lines that I have which is very few I am only in my early thirties. But the overal product rating I would give is a 8 out of 10.</li>
    <li> The firming creme really works.  If you want an instant eye (and face lift) use this product.  It does leave a little white tint but your face makeup covers it.  It also fills in lines and lifts the areas you put it on.</li>
    <li> I was selected from the Dr.Oz show to try several Peter Thomas Roth products and this was one of them I got from his show. This worked- immediately- and better than a much more expensive brand that I had been using. I saw some people complaining about a film, but if you DAB IT ON little by little under your eyes (then remain emotionless for about 5 minutes) you will FEEL it tightening and if you use just a little bit it works perfectly and leaves no evidence behind. It worked so well I let my girlfriends try it and my sister try it so of course I had to rush onto Amazon to get myself a new tube of it. My bags are gone, my fine wrinkles that show how tired I am disappear within moments of putting this on. It literally works INSTANTLY and I love it. It has become my favorite skin care product. I do not use makeup, other than a little gloss and eyeliner, so I love how I can put this one without having to use some kind of makeup to cover up my bags under my eyes.</li>
    <li> If you have doudts, don&#x27;t this product really works. I saw it on the Dr. Oz show and trusted his referral. My mom and I both use it and it&#x27;s like does it&#x27;s magic and is amazing. Love this product.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t know how I lived without this product for so many years.  I love it and will not be without if, if I can help it!!</li>
    <li> PTR PRODUCTS WORK!  THIS ABSOLUTELY FILLS WRINKLE - JUST LIKE AN INJECTABLE - EXCEPT THAT YOU OWN THIS PRODUCT AND CAN USE IT AS OFTEN AS YOU LIKE.  THIS WAS THE SMALLER SIZE, THAT WAS A SURPRISE, ONCE APPLIED YOU DO HAVE TO TAP IT WITH COOL WATER - IT WILL TURN WHITE - THEN YOU CAN APPLY MAKEFUP, FOUNDATION, WHATEVER  - IT DOES LAST UNTIL YOU TAKE IT OFF.  I EVEN WEAR THIS TO BED - ONCE A WEEK - YOUR FACE &amp;#34;DOES&amp;#34; NOT MOVE ALL NIGHT!!!!!  YOUR FACE UPON ARISING LOOKS LIKE BABY SKIN - ISN&#x27;T THAT WHAT WE WANT.  THANK YOU PTR.!!!</li>
    <li> Works great. Be sparse when applying or it can become flakey.</li>
    <li> Wonderful Product !! I can&#x27;t believe I waited this long. I had seen other similar products but was in disbelief ! But thank Dr Oz, he made me...</li>
    <li> Wow, I really hoped this worked...You put it on and yea, you look great until...you move an ouce and it looks like you have white crusty stuff all around your eyes. I used very, very little but still doesn&#x27;t work once you move. I tried it w/lotion, without lotion, with make-up, without make-up...I&#x27;m disappointed to know Dr. Oz highly recommended this because now I&#x27;m not sure when he talks about something if it&#x27;s really going to work. I&#x27;m sad to say this is not a winner! If you want to know what it&#x27;s like use egg white around your face, same affect. : (</li>
    <li> Works great to fill in the lines. Only reason I didn&#x27;t give 5stars is because it dries on your skin white. So you need foundation or BB cream to cover it.</li>
    <li> I bought this last year, after trying this at Ulta. Loved it. But, when I tried this at home, I saw  white residue...Woah? Wait. But there are steps that I overlooked..And this is: apply your favorite eye/skin cream 1st, let it dry;  Apply your makeup, but keeping away from you under eye area (where you would apply this product). Apply only a nail head amount (yes, a small amount goes along way), on your fingertip and smooth on. Let it dry, stay expressionless for 2 minutes. You&#x27;ll feel an immediate tightening (Let it dry completely.) You will see a  a brightening effect, and if you see any obvious residue, don&#x27;t worry, use a slighty damp cotton ball to gingerly wipe away any excess, and viola! Instant, wrinkle free, lineless, perfect eyes! (because without surgery, your bags and sags will not go away). I ordered another tube, just to keep in queue. BTW: This little tube lasts for months and months!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t like this at all.  If you applied it as directed , you needed a small concealer brush to apply the product.  Luckily I had one and I applied it as directed.  It left a dried out white film wherever I put the stuff.  I did tighten the up and lower eye lid a  little, but once you removed the white film as directed that effect disappeared.  I tried some tips that I had read in some of the reviews.  I used my fingers and used only a small amount, only to end up with the white film.  I tried to rub it in with no results at all, yet no white film on the eyelid.  I brought this cream in hopes of tightening up my puffy, sagging eyelids.  If it was not so drying and didn&#x27;t leave the white film it may have been OK.  So if you can figure out how to get it to work without leaving that white film, this product will work for you.</li>
    <li> Love it but have to be careful not to put too much on!</li>
    <li> I bought this hoping it would tighten my skin....and wow, did it ever.  It was like a miracle, my skin looked fantastic until I had to wash the greyish tint off my face. It says don&#x27;t put water on it but if you don&#x27;t it looks like a dried clay face mask film. I tried everything to keep from washing my face but I could not get the film off without water and without water this is useless.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s did what it suppose to do, got it off TV.I look for some fix not&lt;br /&gt;Make up over it . So it&#x27;s was ok thank you</li>
    <li> WARNING&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m 33 with a tendency toward under-eye puffyness, bags and dark circles (thank you, genetics). I am a woman that generally enjoys wearing makeup. If I am in a hurry, I&#x27;ll always at least throw on eyeliner, mascara, brow powder, THIS PRODUCT and some concealer. The reason I explain all of this is that if you&#x27;re a woman (or man) who doesn&#x27;t like taking time with her face, then this may not be the product for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t get me wrong-- this isn&#x27;t some arduous, drawn-out process, but you MUST learn how to do it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HOW TO USE IT&lt;br /&gt;The instructions CLEARLY tell you to dab it on, use water if it gets crusty, and do NOT move the area you&#x27;ve applied it on, so the product takes effect. THIS IS VERY TRUE. If you put too much on, it&#x27;ll get crusty--but they TELL you this right off the bat, so it&#x27;s should be no surprise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also tells you not to move the area you put it on. It doesn&#x27;t mean I stand around not blinking, but I basically put the Roth on AFTER I&#x27;ve already put on my liner, brows, and mascara. While the Roth is drying, I brush my teeth (I&#x27;m serious, I got this down to a science). After it dries, I put on my under-eye concealer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HOW I LEARNED ABOUT IT&lt;br /&gt;I first tried this product in a Sephora inside JCP. I have been getting to that age where I needed SOMETHING, but I wasn&#x27;t sure what would work. The saleswoman in the store suggested this product and I am a total CONVERT. It INSTANTLY tightened my under-eye area--- so much so that one eye was a dramatic \\&quot;before\\&quot; and the other was a dramatic \\&quot;after\\&quot;. I was sold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is BETTER than a $45 under-eye tightening product I used in the past-- you get more product, you don&#x27;t need as much and it WORKS. I&#x27;m in lots of photographs and videos in my field, and this product is a life-saver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;-Works fast&lt;br /&gt;-Noticeable difference&lt;br /&gt;-Smoother skin when I have the product on&lt;br /&gt;-Did I mention it&#x27;s fast?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS&lt;br /&gt;-Takes a few try&#x27;s to find out the right dab for you&lt;br /&gt;-If it&#x27;s too much, it gets crusty&lt;br /&gt;-You can feel your skin tightening&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BOTTOM LINE FOR ME????? The benefits of it GREATLY. OUTWEIGHED. the annoyances.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re a first-time user, understand that you may feel a tingly feeling as it begins to tighten your skin and work. If that bothers you, realize it&#x27;s the product WORKING, so if you want something to tighten without feeling it, get rid of your under-eye nerves. lol  Also, I tended to put WAY TOOOOO MUCH ON at first. This product only takes a TINY dab to work. I learned how much I needed by trial and error, but you&#x27;ll find out what works for you.a few try&#x27;s to find out the right dab for you&lt;br /&gt;-If it&#x27;s too much, it gets crusty&lt;br /&gt;-You can feel your skin tightening&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BOTTOM LINE FOR ME?????

    <li> I am 38 yrs. old with little fine lines.  This product worked great for the first week but, then, I started to notice extremely dry skin under the eye which appeared to show my wrinkles more visibly. This is only a TEMPORARY fix and I would not recommend it to anyone unless your 60 yrs+. I&#x27;ve been using Verite by Estee Lauder, and am satisfied with it. Ladies-you will age, just accept that and don&#x27;t buy in to the hype of such \\&quot;miracle\\&quot; products like the Firmx eye by PTR. Just simply take care of your skin and stay out of the sun.</li>
    <li> Seriously, this product WORKS. It is instant and amazing. I&#x27;m interested in long term results, but for a new mom who wants to look more awake and put together, this product is for you.</li>
    <li> I bought this at Sephora after seeing it on Dr. Oz&#x27;s show.  He said he now uses it for his under eye bags.  Well, I don&#x27;t have bags, but I do have wrinkles so I decided to try it, even if it was $38!  I simply cannot believe how well this works!!!  My under eye area is smooth as glass and it lasts for most the day!  It is true that sometimes you have a white residue left when it dries, but not always.  Maybe it has to do with the amount you put on.  Anyway, if you wear makeup, you can blend this with a concealer or foundation or wear it alone. Today I&#x27;m using it au naturel and I have no white residue.  Not sure about the science behind this, but it&#x27;s awesome.  After I tried it, I immediately bought another one for my travel makeup bag, so I&#x27; never without it.</li>
    <li> Maybe this works for fine line but to difficult to use on any deeper wrinkle.  I am 42, my eyes are my problem area.  I had good results with PTR night cream so thought I&#x27;d give it a try.  I have \\&quot;practiced\\&quot; with an entire tube and the results are greatly varying.  Too much and you feel your skin it so tight it will pop your eye ball out, leaves residue and can twist your skin in a weird unatural way.  Too little, nothing, no effect at all.  It is nerly impossible to apply this perfectly.  You can not blot the residue as it completely dissolves and makes a very obvious untreated area.  It is beginning to dry out the eye area, which of course you do not want with wrinkles, makes them worse!  I don&#x27;t know how anyone can wear this product with make up.  Anything wet will destroy it and powders look dry and flaky.  The only purpose I have found for this is if I have no make-up on and need to answer the door or skype at short notice.  I wipe it on and at least I look more presentable than no makeup at all.  I really did want this to work, I gave it all I had but now I am looking for a more user friendly product or just one that works..</li>
    <li> Hard to use, meant for someone with way more wringles than me I guess. It just dried my eye area and made it worse.</li>
    <li> works great. My wife loves it, It works with liquid makeup but does not work with cream makeup. Recommend, Thanks</li>
    <li> I love this product.  It makes a noticable difference in my eye bags.  I had to experiment with using it to avoid the \\&quot;white eye circle\\&quot; effect.  I use a very little bit and dab on, but stop before the product is entireley dry.  I use it over a tinted moisturizer and haven&#x27;t had any problems.  I gave it as a gift to my sister who likes the product as well.</li>
    <li> i ordered this product because i saw it on dr. oz. it works like it says it does. i got in a very timely manner.</li>
    <li> I have puffiness under my eyes especially in the morning so I thought this would be the solution. I found the product works ok as far as the tightening effect goes, however it leaves too much white residue and when you blot it with a wet rag, it loses it&#x27;s effectiveness. If you don&#x27;t put enough on it doesn&#x27;t work. If you put concealer on top of it after it dries it cakes and looks fake. You have to do a lot of experimentation to get it right, but as of yet I have not found the right way. If they can rework the product so it doesn&#x27;t leave the white stuff, it is worth buying.</li>
    <li> It does firm the under-eye area by shellacking the skin taut, so I have to wonder if my stretching the skin taut perhaps it is doing more harm than good.  Furthermore, I have attempted applying it 50 different ways and only 1 in 10 applications does not result in white residue.......who wants that?</li>
    <li> Ordered several of the Peter Thomas Roth items as Christmas stocking stuffers for my husband. I knew that he had previously bought the shampoo, conditioner and body wash and was very pleased with the rich quality of  those items.  But, the firm eye tighter was a new purchase. He has tried other eye products in other lines but has never made any comment about their effectiveness. With PTR&#x27;s Firm eye, he made an unsolicited compliment about it and has only good things to report.  He has felt a difference with the eye firmer working as described and we can see results. I will definitely repurchase this item for him again!</li>
    <li> I KNOW IT IS ONLY A TEMPORARY ERASER, BUT HEY....SO IS LIPSTICK!!!!  IT IS A NEAT BIT OF MAGIC IN A TUBE AND I AM HAVING A BALL PUTTING ON MY FRIENDS AND SEEING THEIR REACTION!!!!!  THE ONLY PROBLEM IS THEY ALL WANT TO TAKE MY LITTLE TUBE....NO WAY!!! I LEAD THEM TO AMAZON AND THEY ORDER THEIR OWN FROM MY HOUSE......THAT IS THE URGENCY IT CREATES IN PEOPLE---MALE AND FEMALE!!!  THE MEN LOVE IT!!!!!  PETER THOMAS ROTH IS ABSOLUTELY THE BIG DEAL WITH ME!!!  THANK GOD FOR AMAZON SO I CAN AFFORD HIS FINE PRODUCTS!!!!</li>
    <li> This product works just as it says it will.  Tightens the skin around the eyes and you cannot see anymore wrinkles.  It lasts all day.  My husband uses just a tiny amount on each eye, hold very still as not to cause wrinkles, then put a hair dryer on low to make it dry even faster.  He saw some white residue when he first started using the product, then he realized he was using too much.  Decrease the amount you are using and you should not see the white residue.&lt;br /&gt;He has used this product for several years now and is still very happy with the results he see from using it.</li>
    <li> tried this at sephora and saw an instant difference (I used on one eye only to see difference) but so was expensive I was waiting til Christmas, until I found it here and at a great price and just in time before a family wedding in early December. It cam.e in a timely manner and I love the product.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. It works right away and leaves me looking younger.</li>
    <li> This works wonders.  There is a real art to getting in right however.  Start with a VERY little, you can always add more, and dab it quickly over the trouble spot.  Don&#x27;t move the area for a minute or two and then all is well.  Don&#x27;t leave home without checking the mirror after it dries.  I do believe that I am using less over time.  Maybe a little muscle memory thing in the  wrinkle is happening???  I use it under my eyes for the &amp;#34;crosshatch&amp;#34; issue as well as the crows feet.  I do use it on the &amp;#34;11&#x27;s&amp;#34;  not sure how much difference it&#x27;s making.  I don&#x27;t think that I would like this for my entire face as you can tell it&#x27;s there for the first 30 minutes.  Put your foundation over top and you are good to go.  I think you will love it.</li>
    <li> this stuff works.....and only a tiny tiny bit needed.  I used a small eye shadow brush to apply thinly and the bag under my eye vanished.  it is amazing. no residue like so many say they get.  but I was using sudden change and that leaves a white residue...you have to be so careful....tried this and put it on really thin...and I am totally happy with the results......a little tiny bit with a small eyeshadow brush is all you need...  I have had problems with puffiness under my right eye and it is gone with this ....try it...</li>
    <li> Awesome product! Takes a very small amount and a few tries to get it right.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about 5 years and loved it and hated it from the start.  In the beginning I would either use too much product which resulted in crusting and white circlrs or use to little which would not be effective. After a bit of practice I found judt the right amount to use and discovered that, for me, applying it with a small brush worked the best.  The price is great and 1 tube ladts months!  I use eye moisturizer and apply this product after applying the moisturizer (let the moisturizer set a few minutes begore applying Firnx) and mascara.  I apply it in the morning and it ladts all day until I remove my makeup at night.  Wouldn&#x27;t leave home without it.</li>
    <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE this stuff! I&#x27;ve got all my girlfriends buying it now too... Before and Afters are incredible! I&#x27;ve been using this for about 3 years, after stumbling across it in Sephora. This WILL remove puffiness under your eye! IT WILL!  Be patient.. get the right consistency... I add a TINY amount of water and use my finger to apply.... read the instructions... WOW...</li>
    <li> Works great, if applied correctly.  My sister turned me onto this product but returned hers because it cracked, peeled and turned white under her eyes.  The trial version does not have the proper instructions, unlike the full size.  The trick to this product is shaking the tube first, applying a pea size (and I do mean pea size) amount to the top of your hand, rubbing the product on top of your hand (in a circular motion) and applying the product sparingly under and on the side of the eyes.  It&#x27;s best to avoid squinting, etc after applying the product in order to let it set and dry.  Afterward, I apply my foundation (which is just Clinique&#x27;s double pressed powder) and I&#x27;m good to go.  At this price, much cheaper than at Sephora.</li>
    <li> Everything was perfect from start to finish.  Item arrived in time, no problems at all.  I would definitely use again!  Thanks so much.</li>
    <li> While this works in minimizing the appearance of wrinkles, it leaves a white residue at the site of application.&lt;br /&gt;I use the smallest amount possible and i can still see the white residue.  I just got this product a few days ago&lt;br /&gt;so I may not have the application technique quite right yet.  I will come back again at a later time and review once I work with this&lt;br /&gt;product some more.</li>
    <li> This makes the stress under my eyes disappear! I don&#x27;t know how it works but it does and its amazing. I don&#x27;t even ware foundation any more!</li>
    <li> Has helped the puffiness and fine lines around my eyes so much, truly love this product.  Also helps with the eyelids as well.</li>
    <li> Quick fix-not permanent-but the best under eye product...ever! Takes some getting use to, but once you figure out the application-puffiness and lines are gone until you wash it off.</li>
    <li> I saw this product on Dr. Oz and ordered it for my son.  Due to a battle with a brain tumor, my son had a change in the muscles on the right side of his face.  While others can&#x27;t notice it, he felt like there was always swelling under his right eye to the point that he&#x27;d want to pull down the skin under his eye to get relief.  This product tightens things up immediately and provides him with so much relief.  He wouldn&#x27;t want to be without this product for a single day.</li>
    <li> Quickly noticed a difference</li>
    <li> Makes my eyes look a decade younger!. I have been using this product for years and swear by it so long as you don&#x27;t over apply - otherwise you end up with white streaks atound your eyes:-)</li>
    <li> This stuff works!!! It&#x27;s temporary, but great for special occasions. If you want to avoid surgery under your eyes, give it a try. More affordable than some of the other products out there that do the same thing. It only takes a little, and if you get too much, it will look powdery. But a little water on a brush will solve that problem.</li>
    <li> I love, love, love this product. I have tried many other under eye creams for puffiness and although temporary, it really does take years off your appearance. I&#x27;m in my early 40&#x27;s and with my eye baggage, I looked much, much older not to mention tired. I&#x27;ve had numerous comments on how refreshed and alert I look now. As with many other reviews, I do have issues with the white residue. It takes me 2 to 3 times to reapply sometimes to make sure I get it perfect. But once done, it lasts all day long. Give it a try, you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
    <li> I LOVE this product! Still experimenting and so far pleased. I&#x27;m 62 and have good skin. Hope my regimen helps! I use Cetaphil gentle skin cleanser...and don&#x27;t use a washcloth. Pat face dry and use Olay complete all day moisturizer. Next I apply Revlon New Complexion. Now, I don&#x27;t put under eye as I do in my final step. After applying minimal makeup I use my index finger..barely touch Revlon New Complexion...and add couple small drops Peter Thomas Roth Instant Eye (make sure you shake first!). It&#x27;s thick so little is needed. I then tap under eyes till blended. This works for me and I can apply AFTER makeup is applied. This is the best result I&#x27;ve achieved after using other under eye products. Hope this works for you!</li>
    <li> This is a great product for tightening up wrinkles and magically making them disappear.  The only problem that I have is that the effects do not last as long as advertised.</li>
    <li> Have used for a number of years.  Have to be careful to not leave any white specks.</li>
    <li> This product does a good job making under eye bags less noticeable. A lot of reviewers talk about it being difficult to apply. I rarely have issues with the white flaking, I do apply it with a small brush. That helps ensure I don&#x27;t use too much product.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product and will be devastated if they discontinue or reformulate it!!! I will not leave the house without it!!!! I just turned the big 5 OMG!!! I notice a big improvement in the appearance of my wrinkles and sagging plus the pore size of my face when I use this. Great item and will continue to purchase. One word of advice is to not rub in too much as this will produce flaking and white residue. I spread a thin layer with slight pressure on my face and leave it to set for 5 mkinutes or until completely dry, Do not apply too close to lash line under eye as it will create a pulling effect on your lower eyelid that is a bit unnatural looking and uncomfortable and lastly do not use moisturizer before applying as this will diminish the effects and produce the white residue.</li>
    <li> I also need to correct how slowly try try it, because I did not try it and I think it&#x27;s moisturizing and even completely ineffective, in addition to rub mud.</li>
    <li> Took me a few times to figure out how to get this to work right but once I did, it is AMAZING! It takes years off your appearance. Usually you see products that &amp;#34;say&amp;#34; they do something and then it is all hype. Not this. It really works. I also use it above my top lip and the small vertical lines disappear. Love this product.</li>
    <li> This is an amazing product. I have very puffy bags under my eyes and I use this every day!  And voila no more 3-bag days. I highly recommend this product for anyone with bags under their eyes!</li>
    <li> Application is the key [thin layer using broad flat foundation brush]; blending so-so with foundation,too much work; however, it works very well with Bare Minerals, or similar products. The powder will not weigh down the formula.  Rather than wait the perscribed tem minuite dry time, use blow-dryer (on cool), fan, etc. to save those get ready minutes.  Get accustomed to the product, works like a charm:-)</li>
    <li> Amazing product.  You must use a very small amount and do not disturb the eye area until the gel is dry.  After you get the application down you will have AMAZING results!</li>
    <li> Great for when you need a little lift. I find it works best if I put product on damp face. Let it dry and proceed with a loose mineral powder.  Whether it&#x27;s for the eye or entire face, I&#x27;ll use either of his products for whole face.</li>
    <li> Does as it states.  I have severe bags under my eyes.  This product does &amp;#34;hide&amp;#34; them.  It does, however, take time to learn the proper way to apply.  Best results are when applying with a brush as recommended.</li>
    <li> This product is the future of cosmetics I&#x27;m sure, however, it isn&#x27;t perfect and not for everyone. Someone commented you&#x27;re not supposed to use water to wash it off. The directions clearly state you do! Here&#x27;s how I use it: I apply as directed and when ready, I splash water a 2-3 times all over my face, rubbing very gently the third time. I gently pat my face dry. When it&#x27;s dry, I check for any leftover residue, in which i wet my finger and gently rub off. I have never worn foundation, so after it the product dries, I apply my bronzer or blush, and any eye/lip stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is absolutely a difference when you wash this stuff off. I&#x27;m 46, not super wrinkly, but can definitely see my prominent marionette lines greatly reduced. I dont have a lot of forehead/heavy crows feet, but they also are great minimized. Before you wash off, it is TRULY amazing to see your face. It&#x27;s like you are literally 10 years younger!! That is why I say this is the future of cosmetics. I&#x27;m quite sure they will find a way for you to keep that dramatic look in the near future. In the meantime, try it out. Even if you only use it to go out at night. It&#x27;s worth it.</li>
    <li> Waste of money!! all this product did was leave a white powdery look on my face that wudnt rub off. So I ended up having to wash it all off! Very dissatisfied!!</li>
    <li> This product does what is promised.  But it is a temporary fix and not long term correcting.  I use it on my worst under eye bag days!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t think this worked as it said it would. Its Okay but the effects are definitely temporary and ware off quickly. the product is a little difficult to apply and leaves a film if applied to thick. It is helpful to mix this product with your primer or moisturizer to help avoid the white film.</li>
    <li> I have tried mastering the perfect way to apply this without the yucky residue and have failed each time. I am African American and unfortunately even under makeup it still shows. Leaves an ashy dry look. However it does work, it tightened the skin underneath my eyes instantly and took years off my appearance. I guess I will have to keep working on my application technique.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like the way that there&#x27;s a white layer after it dries on the skin.  I&#x27;ve had to remove it before leaving the house because&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s so obvious.</li>
    <li> Unlike so many products out there, that claim to firm skin and remove dark circles/wrinkles and bags around eye area, this does what it says!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can truly say, after using this product for some time, it works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You have to follow instructions carefully, and remember it is not a permanent fix. But it lasts all day!</li>
    <li> This is my 2nd tube of this great stuff.  The only negative is that sometimes it leaves a white film on your skin that is visible.</li>
    <li> Love this product as I have been using it now for 2 years.  You don&#x27;t need any other costly product.  Suggesstion: Put some eye serum on first before applying.  Then before using Firmx Eye, SHAKE it first then apply a small dot on the back of your hand.  Then gently sweep it on.  Do not move for 2 minutes to let it dry.  Put too much and you will have eye crusting.  I also use it on my frown lines between my eyes.</li>
    <li> Keep buying as gifts for friends. Everyone loves this- it&#x27;s amazing. My friends eye bags have actually shrunk fe using this over the last couple years. Great stuff. You do need lighter skin as it dries white and a teeny little bit is all you need to suck in the bags and avoid the white strip. Love it</li>
    <li> Product does reduce (temporarily) reduce puffiness around eyes.  Apply sparingly.  Arrived earlier than expected.  Overall, satisfied.  Excellent seller.</li>
    <li> So I was very skeptical about this working at all but surprise, surprise.  It does work!  You can clearly see and feel the difference as it is drying.  The trick is not to put on too much, just a very think coating.  You can feel it working.  Wait about 10 minutes and then add makeup.  I just put a little moisturizer on it and it takes care of any whiteness.  I would say it lasts half the day.  I would reapply before going out at night.  I would definitely buy this again.</li>
    <li> it did make the puffiness look better, but my skin is irritated and painful after applied it.  Have to throw it away</li>
    <li> This is the third time I order and as usually the shipment was very very fast and the product is my life saver! I never leave the house without it! Takes 10 years off! Thanks!!!!</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome.  I mix this with a little eye cream every day before I put on my makeup.  You have to go light on the touch with this because you might get some white under the eye if you put too much. That is why I recommend an eye cream with it. It tightens up the eye area and then I put on my foundation or my St. Tropez instant facial glow.  This is another product I cannot be without.  It lasts a long time because you just need a very small drop and then you let it set for a few minutes before applying makeup. It makes a big difference for those with fine lines or wrinkles under the eyes.  This is one of my favorite products by Peter Thomas Roth, if not the FAVORITE!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> excellent - works a advertised.  a very good de-puffer!</li>
    <li> The white film that forms over the under eye area look TERRIBLE !!</li>
    <li> Puffy eyes or wrinkles required for this stuff!!  Once you put it on, you can feel it firming and tightening! Just be careful to not over do it...as there will be some white residue!!</li>
    <li> I have terrible bags and not kidding it makes them disappear...I use mineral makeup....if you get it moist it will not work....just so you know</li>
    <li> Have applied it in several ways and still do not like it, it really does not do what it says it does. will not buy again, leaves a white powder and when you apply make up looks horrible</li>
    <li> This stuff is a wonder! A girl on my staff recommended it, she looks so good! This product is easy to use. Do NOT make expressions whilenit is drying though, you won&#x27;t get good results.</li>
    <li> Delivery was fast and this is a great product.  If you use it appropriately it works fine.  You just have to use it sparingly according to the directions.  I&#x27;m a repeat buyer.</li>
    <li> The wiping around the eyes, soon became a bit dry. Sometimes there will be some white powder. But after a few days, can still feel the skin around the eyes tightened. Use for a long time, hope to have better effect</li>
    <li> This stuff does what it says it does -- which puts it ahead of most beauty products, which only &amp;#34;help&amp;#34; cover wrinkles, &amp;#34;help&amp;#34; make hair shiny, or &amp;#34;help&amp;#34; improve skin tone. This doesn&#x27;t &amp;#34;help&amp;#34; do anything -- it DOES erase wrinkles and tighten skin, period. I use it on my eyes, neck and those folds along my nose. They disappear and I look 32 instead of 52. Really. My only issue is that I&#x27;m basically a low maintenance person working from a home office so I wouldn&#x27;t go through this routine every day. I also noticed that if I use it for several days in a row my skin gets irritated and it burns. But it&#x27;s a life saver for me -- I work in an industry dominated by young geeks and REALLY need to fit in at conferences and meetings. I feel much more confident wearing the product and when I finally told a co-worker my age his jaw hit the floor (I also work out a lot).</li>
    <li> Works extremely well.  Takes a few times to get it down pat.  Too much and it flakes - too little and it&#x27;s not effective.  If you use foundation, I recommend powder foundation only.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work. A friend bought one at s makeup store for $38. It was black with a gray cap and she loved it.  This is either a knockoff or some ingredients are missing. Also leaves a white residue.</li>
    <li> I love it!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried tons of these types of products and have always been disappointed that the &amp;#34;hype&amp;#34; about them was all false!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And I agree, FOLLOW the directions and you can&#x27;t go wrong..  it does take a practice to find the right amount for the job, but once you get that down, you are good to go!</li>
    <li> I so love this product that I wanted to make sure I never run out.  That&#x27;s why I bought a second tube before my first was empty.  This product is a little bit hard to get the application down right.  Too much and you have white half moons under your eyes, Too little and it isn&#x27;t as effective.  This is what works for me.  I put a small amount, the size of a small pea, on a firm brush.  I then brush  under my eyes where my bags appear.  THEN, I use my finger to gently press (do not rub) the product in.  Sit for a few minutes, not making any facial expression or touching you face in any way.  Once the product is set - I HAVE NO MORE BAGS UNDER MY EYES.  I am a woman in my sixties and this Instant FIRMx makes me look ten years younger!!</li>
    <li> Helps keep my pants up and they&#x27;re cute!</li>
    <li> This stuff is quite amazing. It really makes the bags DISAPPEAR under your eyes! It makes your skin feel strange, like it&#x27;s pulled tight, but doesn&#x27;t really bother me because the results are fantastic. This is just a temporary fix and I only use it when my eyes look really puffy in the morning. I got it for a much better price on Amazon than in the stores and I highly recommend trying this if you want an instant fix for puffy under-eyes!</li>
    <li> Works really well for a tightening effect under my eyes. I like to use it daily over an eye cream . Over that I use a light foundation and I&#x27;m happy with  the outcome. My only advice is to read the instructions before hand so you become skilled at it . Practice makes perfect. :)</li>
    <li> Having a very difficult time with the application process. It leaves a white film that sometimes is impossible to work with. I was hoping for better results on my puffy eyes.</li>
    <li> I tried it in the Sephora store in JCP. Wasn&#x27;t able to wash under my eyes. I figured I&#x27;d just try it for the heck of it and was headed straight home in case it looked awful. I put just a dab on, walked around the store and got in my car. Looked in the mirror and was VERY happy. It looked great! Then I took my powder foundation and brushed some on under my eyes and it still looked great! No white residue or cakey look. Lasted a long time too which surprised me since I already had makeup on under my eyes before I applied it! I plan on buying some now which is why I came here!</li>
    <li> it never took my bags away under my eyes...low review because of that..no for the price I would not recommend to no one</li>
    <li> this product is well worth the money...only issue I have is that when applying foundation it tends to loosen the skin again.</li>
    <li> Best product I&#x27;ve found for the money for tightening under eye area.</li>
    <li> Ok product, got it as a gift.</li>
    <li> If the results of this product would last more than several minutes, it would be like a face lift in a bottle, BUT, it doesn&#x27;t.  When I  apply the product I can literally see my facial lines disappear.  It seems absolutely amazing, but as soon as I apply my moisturizer the effect is gone.  Disappointing.</li>
    <li> This works so good on my eyes, it erases (temporarily) the wrinkles and crows feet instantly.  I suggest putting on a thin layer so there is no residue to wipe off.</li>
    <li> I am a man!  I have found as I have gotten in my thirties (almost thirty one) my circles around my eyes are getting very bad.  I have tried everything placenta, baby turtle baths, dog sweat and extract of mud.  So seriously I mean it when I say I aged ten years what seamed like overnight and I use to have the face of a Greek god.  You can look at pictures of me before they started to set in and I looked like a college kid.  These things have aged me and I have no problem at getting older but I dont wanna look forty five when I am in my lower thirties.  They don&#x27;t concern me to the point of surgery because I am fine with them but wish I could hide them somewhat.  Zeus cursed me with these genetics and I can see it in my kids eyes and I weep and I tear my garments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately my face decay found no hope with this product though I think you will like it if you have wrinkles to tighten.  You dab a little and keep your face robotic for three to seven minutes give or take.  My problem is I found it actually enhanced my circles making them worse and since I don&#x27;t put makeup on over top it doesn&#x27;t look very nice.  It almost made me look sick though I am a pale white guy it made it look a tad worse.  I wasn&#x27;t expecting much and I simply don&#x27;t wanna go out on a date night with my wife and have people compliment her on bringing Golem or the walking corpse to the party.  I was not expecting a miracle and I have tried a few different ideas to try to lessen the effect of corpse face but nothing has worked yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will say you can feel the stuff tightening and I could see my skin was smoother and tighter but not really what I needed.  It would probably work for light wrinkles and the such but that&#x27;s not my concern.  Another problem was no matter how much I used you can always see a light white film on top of my skin.  I tried a goop to a microscopic dot and always could tell.  It might of been my own paleness enhancing the white but it was there and it looked like dry eye skin or something.  I guess for the price its not worth it though I think it does have its place I wont buy again until my face turns more Cryptkeeper like.  Give it a try and you may be surprised.ed like dry eye skin or something.  I guess for the price its not worth it though I think it does have its place I wont buy again until my face turns more Cryptkeeper like.  Give it a try and you may be surprised.</li>
    <li> I tried P T Roth&#x27;s Instant facelift and while it sort of worked the residue even when washed off came through as the day wore on. Samething with the the Instant Firm Eye. Great idea, but the makers have to find a way that it goes on clear and stays clear. I felt like I wasted money to look vampirish (whitish green around the eyes). It does tighten but it isn&#x27;t worth the eerie glow.</li>
    <li> I cannot say anything negative about this product. I love it and have turned others onto it!</li>
    <li> This product would work if it didn&#x27;t leave a white residue. Tried using it different ways but it always leaves the white residue even when using a tiny bit. White residue is hard to remove.</li>
    <li> does not do what it promises to do.  great disappointment.</li>
    <li> My mom uses it now CUZ of me and I do the tanning bed and helps the wrinkles under my eyes will buy more when my bottle gets low</li>
    <li> I was sceptical at first seeing this on the Dr. Oz program. Tried it and was amazed how it did remove bags under my eyes!</li>
    <li> This is a miracle!  I have a few wrinkles &amp; darkness under my eyes &amp; more importantly I have a slight puffiness under my left eye which is noticeable even with concealer.  I was JUST about to get Juviderm to even my eyes out but tried this first.  It worked immediately!  Gone were all the problems listed above--my eyes looked like a 20yr old!  But you MUST apply just a bit under each eye otherwise you will get a little residue.  Remember, this is not a permanent fix.  It lasts for about 8hrs.  I&#x27;ve spent a fortune on eye creams &amp; this is as close to Juviderm as it gets.  I&#x27;m astonished &amp; so happy that I look like my &amp;#34;old self&amp;#34;.  Give it a try &amp; remember to read the simple instructions.  BTW, I did not even have to use concealer under my eyes!  Yes, I&#x27;m a man &amp; I&#x27;ll admit to using concealer bc of dark circles!  But with this product I can go out a look &amp; feel better!</li>
    <li> I was using another product similar to this one. This is great a product but it&#x27;s the same as the other. It&#x27;s extremely hard to apply makeup.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t understand some of the negative reviews for this amazing product. Perhaps they are using way too much. You only need an extremely tiny dab. Use your pinky finger and pat it in gently, starting at the inner corner, wiping off your pinky in between pats if it feels too slick. Work your way across to the outer corner, feathering out to the temple area. In seconds, puffy eyes are smoothed! I have used the Sudden Change brand for years and this is 1000% better. One thing to note, I use this as the last step after makeup is all done. I won&#x27;t ever be without this fabulous product!</li>
    <li> Leaves a white residue, even if you don&#x27;t use a lot. Didn&#x27;t really see a difference on my face or wrinkles.</li>
    <li> Love the product! Perfect solution to quickly eliminate undereye bags. I had to work at it for awhile at first to get it just right. I found that less is more and apply with applicator. It does leave a white residue, but if I use just enough that it is absorbed mostly into the skin. The residue is manageable. Also let it dry naturally, I found if I tried to hasten the process by standing in front of a fan, it will surface dry befor being absorbed into skin leaving a messy, caky residue. But I have to let it really dry befor applying any foundation or it will undue. I found it best to smooth a little foundation on my arm, let it dry and then use a facial powder brush to apply. But it must be almost powder dry. Or it will look caky or again undue the adhiesive effect of the product. But when done correctly it takes 30 years off of my life and is great alternative untill I can afford plastic surgery! Warning: it is not for everyday use as it will irritate your skin, especially the delicate area under your eyes.</li>
    <li> There&#x27;s no doubt this temporarily eliminates the undesired wrinkles around your eyes. However, I couldn&#x27;t keep it on for more than 30 minutes. The skin stretched to the point where I was very uncomfortable. I had to wash it off. The worst part comes after I washed my face. My skin looked really dried and the wrinkles I DID NOT have 30 minutes earlier simply popped out of nowhere and the ones I had became more pronounced. I’ve been putting moisturizer since yesterday and it’s just not going back to the way it was before.</li>
    <li> The instant firm eye cream exceeded my expectations.  It does just what it says it will do.  The lines under my eyes disappeared while I was watching them.  Excellent and good price as well.</li>
    <li> Yes it works. However. It is inconsistent when it it comes to leaving behind the white residue making it look like I have put on a way too light under eye concealer. Looks bad. I constantly fight with this product between white residue and leaving enough product to do the job. I recently bought sudden change under eye instant firming serum. That stuff works way better. It does not leave behind the white residue and works just as well as a skin tightener for my under eye bags. I was born with the under eye bag issue and feel as I get older it ages me. It did not bother me when I was younger. If anyone is considering a product like this I would totally tell you to try the Sudden Change.</li>
    <li> This is one of my favorite Peter Thomas Roth products. Just like the name states, it instantly firms your eye area. Use just a small amount under and around the eyes to produce firmer tone as well as reducing puffiness. It&#x27;s a daily product to be used under moisturizer. This is not a product that is intended to produce long term results. It&#x27;s just a daily fix. I&#x27;ve been using it now for several years along with my daily PTR skin care regimen and it&#x27;s an extra blessing when I&#x27;ve taken the 6:00am flight straight into the office. Try it. You will love it.</li>
    <li> this is  the best product going.  It is amazing and will be buying more.&lt;br /&gt;Loved it.</li>
    <li> This product does nothing to treat or change the reason why it was purchased. It leaves a visible residue that is not flattering and only dryes the skin. Like most advertise beauty products,I t&#x27;s just another marketed sales pitch to target those who have concernes about apperence with puffy/ baggy eye treatments. What a waste of money.Thumbs down!</li>
    <li> Great product !  Can&#x27;t go out without it,  it makes me look younger without baggy under eyes .  Thanks much !</li>
    <li> I have tried everything to fight wrinkles. I am 51 years old and people are shocked that I am that old. This stuff not only is a instant fix, but, in time, I noticed that it started work in that it reformed the skin to stay the way it tightened it daily. I will never be without this product. Please buy this product if you are worried about your wrinkles. You have to work with it for a couple of weeks or more to get it just right.</li>
    <li> I followed the instructions and searched through You Tube for additional help.  It just dries under your eyes like dry sputum and just sits there.  They instruct the customer to use just a small amount and wait motionless for a few minutes to allow the product to dry.  A dry, crusty very noticeable film is what I received.  After several attempts, I filed it under, what a total waste of money!</li>
    <li> I really like this product.  It takes away the puffiness under my eyes.  You need very little to do the job!</li>
    <li> Leaves a residue on skin.  Does not firm as instructions state.</li>
    <li> Really helps with the puffy eyes in the mornings.</li>
    <li> don&#x27;t know what all the fuss is about.  I could not see much of a difference.  Product gets two stars and the seller gets a big fat zero!  Terrible customer service.</li>
    <li> The product dries and pulls your skin in odd directions.  You&#x27;re suppose to wipe off excess but how much is excess?  Lesson - just because Dr. Oz says it works doesn&#x27;t make it so.</li>
    <li> this product works great but leaves a white filmy residue and it is not something that just wipes away. You need to use water and then well, you just wiped it all OFF! I have tried mixing it with petroleum jelly but he effect is not as strong as it is without. Won&#x27;t be buying again.</li>
    <li> Product seems to reduce dark circles, but it seems to lose its effectiveness for smoothing wrinkles if make-up or skin care products are used over it. A small amount is all that is needed, but the results , in my opinion, are not significant enough to warrant purchasing. Be mindful, however, that I believe most products behave differently on different individuals. Hence, what may fail for me might be a winner for you. Also, it seems that the results may differ based on the magnitude of the problem. The main thing to remember here is to use a very small amount (less than the size of a pea) and to allow it to dry completely.</li>
    <li> This stuff works great.</li>
    <li> This is an awesome product  to temporarily erase years from your eyes. It really works and you will be surprised. The results will be an overall more youthful look.</li>
    <li> another stupid add on.</li>
    <li> This works some of the time....When the firmx turns white and you rub it with a qtip (moistened) you make extra wrinkles show,&lt;br /&gt;It is not all it is cracked up to.  About 1 out of 10 times have I been happy with it.  It drys if the cap is not tightened.</li>
    <li> Awesome product. The only thing is you have to becareful how much you put on or it will leave a white crusty area where it dries. Other than that I love it. Even my 78 yr old father bought some after I put some under his eyes and he saw how well it works for puffy eyes!!!!</li>
    <li> It leaves a white residue regardless of what I do. And also a very stiff look afterwards. I&#x27;ve even tried mixing it with other products!</li>
    <li> Nada, Nada, Nada.  It did nothing as promised.</li>
    <li> iI flakes and doesn&#x27;&#x27;r work.</li>
    <li> I can not live without this !! My trick is .... A little goes a long way and I put under the eyes and crows feet lightlyswooping upward .... Dry with a blow dryer while smiling .... Repeat and then use a nice facial mosturizer a little blush and you are GoRG!</li>
    <li> Not what I expected.  Not happy with the product.  It was returned.  I saw it advertized on a popular doctor TV show.  But, at least Amazon took it back.</li>
    <li> I am 74 and have tried every eye product that advertised \\&quot;skin tightening\\&quot; puffiness.  I have my Sicilian Father to thank for the under eye baggage.  I LOVE this product.  It is the only product that has ever worked for me.  It takes away the tired under eye look that I hate.  Actually my 53 year old daughter who also got her grandfather&#x27;s genes, put me on to this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing. VERY important.  Use only a bit.  I put a tiny drop on my pinkie and touch the pinkie finger on my other hand and use each to apply to the under eye area.  More than enough. Have not had a problem with a white film.  Because I have pretty good skin - thank you Dad - I rarely wear foundation.  My eyeliner and brows are done with permanent liners (tattoo) so some shadow, blush, a TINY bit of Firm X and I&#x27;m out the door!</li>
    <li> This product works great on my crows feet but it seems to pinch and pull underneath my eye making it look worse than before I used it.  I have not had any problems with the gray residue thanks to all of those who posted you MUST use a very thin layer.  This will work if you are moderately wrinkled but not so much for puffiness under the eye.</li>
    <li> If you remember that jingle, chances are you might have the need to check out this wrinkle cream...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is really interesting stuff to check out. If you have fine lines and problem areas under your eyes this cream tightens the areas up and for lack of better words, puffs it up. The first time I tried it was at a friend&#x27;s house and I kept getting the residue after effects that the cream can create if you use too much or if you already have some type of product on your face. For this, I just put some water on a cloth and dabbed it off. I got some and at home, I put it on right out of the shower when I don&#x27;t have any face cream or make-up on and I just used a tiny bit around my eyes and also a couple of other places. One of the tricks to the product is to not move your face when you first put the cream on. If you have ever used lip plumper, you&#x27;ll recognize the feeling of the cream. It tightens and seems to plump up areas much like a lip plumper. That&#x27;s what I thought anyway. After I wait 5 or so minutes for the cream to dry, I put on my make-up as normal and the cream seems to last most of the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t tried to mix it with make-up but this is a product you can play with and learn as you go. It did get rid of fine lines around my eyes. If you get the residue build up, what I&#x27;ve found is that you&#x27;ve already got some type of product on your face, or you have used too much as it only takes a little, tiny amount, which means your tube will last as well, as long as you just use a little bit. I also used it on fine lines around my mouth and it worked great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product requires a little patience, well, maybe more than a little, but you&#x27;ve got to work with it a bit to learn how to use it properly and get the best results, but the results are pretty pleasing! It&#x27;s really an amazing cream. You do feel it tightening and plumping up your skin and it stays on under make-up. Like I said, once I got home and began to use it after I washed my face, I have not experienced the white residue at all. If those fine lines or under eye areas are troubling you, this is definitely worth a shot.face, I have not experienced the white residue at all. If those fine lines or under eye areas are troubling you, this is definitely worth a shot.</li>
    <li> This is a great product at a great price.  It arrived quickly and in mint condition.  I can tell a difference in the appearance of lines around my eyes almost instantly</li>
    <li> Paid about $12 less than the suggested retail price.  It definitely works as advertised.  I suggest using a very small amount.  This gives the best results and as a side benefit, results in more uses per tube.</li>
    <li> Good product.  Fast shipping</li>
    <li> Its simply incredible the effect, and lasts all day long.</li>
    <li> it works pretty good. when you first put it on it looks great. it is supposed to last hours...not really. and you have to be careful and get it on just right or it leaves a white film on your skin. i got it for an awesome price...so that makes it ok.  would be disappointed if i had paid a lot for it</li>
    <li> I love this stuff..works great under eyes..put little to much turns white but otherwise great stuff. I&#x27;m addicted to it😊</li>
    <li> Well i&#x27;m glad you asked.  I contacted the seller to do a return and was declined.  I had a bad reaction to this face product.  I don&#x27;t feel i should be stuck with paying for something that was damaging to me.  This seller is not being a good community seller.  I would never let someone keep something if it was damaging. Also, this product is good if you don&#x27;t wear make-up. Once you put anything over it the affects go away.  It&#x27;s a bad product.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you</li>
    <li> I have darkened bags under my eyes.  I am told it is hereditary and not too fixable with plastic surgery.  This stuff is amazing.&lt;br /&gt; I use it when I am going out and want to look my very best.  It takes the bags completely away.  It is a little drying. I use it under my makeup, and make sure to let it dry for 10 minutes before makeup.  The very best look would be to use airbrush makeup over the top.  FABULOUS!</li>
    <li> This really works. Only note of caution is it can be temperamental putting it on. I have allergies..and it shows in my eyes, they get puffy underneath.  Put this on and it takes it away. I do wish it had a tint of color though. But I don&#x27;t start my day without it.</li>
    <li> IT REALLY DOES ELIMINATE UNDEREYE BAGS AND WRINKLES VERY QUICKLY (5 TO 10 MIN), HOWEVER, THE DOWNSIDE IS THAT IT CREATES A FILM AFTER IT FLATTENS OUT THE WRINKLES WHICH WILL NOT COVER WITH NORMAL FACE LOTION AS IT WILL CAKE UP INTO SMALL BITS.........SO, UNLESS A PERSON IS GOING TO WEAR SUNGLASSES ALL DAY, YOU NEED TO WASH OFF THIS PRODUCT IN ORDER TO PUT ON FACE CREAM......SO THE WRINKLES AND BAGS REAPPEAR WITHIN THE HOUR.  I GUESS SURGERY OR LASER TREATMENT FOR UNDEREYE WRINKLES/BAGS  IS PROBABLY BEST.</li>
    <li> This product works well for a temproary fix and it works within minutes. Granted you can get the same effect from an egg white wash on your face but that is hard to put makeup over.</li>
    <li> felt and looked like white glue- made my face look worse- not better!</li>
    <li> dried to white powder and irritated skin</li>
    <li> Does the trick! If you get the white powdery look when it dries, use less product. Pea size works.</li>
    <li> Leaves a film on skin.</li>
    <li> It was really amazing as I watched the bags under my eyes disappear after applying this product. Then came the &amp;#34;no&amp;#34;. When I applied moisturizer and sunscreen on top, it negated the product - the bags returned! So, it would be good at night when you donot require sunscreen and also skip any other liquid product you would put on top of the Roth Firmx. Yes, I tried it over the sunscreen and moisturizer and it did nothing and left a glaring white residue.</li>
    <li> This product did noticeably flatten my undereye bags and it helped with the appearance of my malar cheek bags. The trick was the application . I have had success using a rice grain size bead of the product squirted onto my hand and then very thinnly and carefully applied with a small makeup brush, stroking upward and outward. I have not yet gotten it to work when mixed with a dab of my usual Avon brightening concealer. I will keep trying i think it will eventually work. Right now i am just dusting mineral foundation over my dark circles to help cover them. Anything liquid messes up the effect. In short i will buy this product again. It is expensive but it works.</li>
    <li> I like this product, but you have to apply it &amp;#34;just so&amp;#34; as to not leave a residue. When applied properly it does work, but who has the time to waste being so specific.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing; you can actually watch it firm up the bags under the eyes.  I have some damage to one of the under eye areas from some cryotherapy my doctor did and it even improved that one!  Good product.</li>
    <li> I was so happy to get this and try it right away.  But I was so disappointed.  It only made the eyes firm for only a little time.  Once you moved your eyes it was gone.  The lines came back.</li>
    <li> This product works but you do have to develop the skill to make it work the way it should based on your skin colour.&lt;br /&gt;I mix it with a little bit of my foundation .</li>
    <li> This product is amazing. The only thing with it is you have to brush away residue when&lt;br /&gt;it dries but, other than that it tightens like crazy!</li>
    <li> ok... so i bought this and decided to give it a try..... well... maybe it&#x27;s me... but i&#x27;m not that impressed... YET.&lt;br /&gt;maybe it was an error that i have yet to master... maybe i need to try a different technique... I don&#x27;t know....</li>
    <li> This product works beautifully for me if I:&lt;br /&gt;Thoroughly cleanse my face first, removing all traces of dirt, oil, makeup and moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;Apply a small size and pat/wipe in &amp;#34;sweep up&amp;#34; motions, from inside corner of my eye out.&lt;br /&gt;Do not add any makeup or concealer until about an hour later.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My entire eye area looks like I am 21 again all day long!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the second tube of PTR Instant FIRMx Eye that I have purchased from Amazon. Lasts for many months, fantastic price, prompt delivery. I just love this product!! Would like to dip my whole body in.</li>
    <li> Still trying out this item and so far I like the out come but need more time using it and then I can truly let you know.</li>
    <li> I love this product, it works miracles on puffiness and circles under your eyes.  I saw this product demonstrated on Dr. Oz, but really did not expect the excellent result I received.  You do have to work carefully with this and not use a lot of product.  That is the key, just a bit mixed with makeup will do the trick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried lots of products for dark circles and puffiness around the eyes.  This is the only one that has worked.  I highly recommend it!!</li>
    <li> Its Just okay........just okay need more info on how to apply ....but it&#x27;s just okay not great but just ok</li>
    <li> This product is great at removing saddlebags under your eyes.  You have to play with it for awhile, and then it&#x27;s clear sailing.</li>
    <li> Definitely smooths and tightens laugh lines.</li>
    <li> This is nothing special and it appears to be a copy of Serious Skin Care&#x27;s \\&quot;Atox\\&quot; but it costs more and leaves a white residue.  I&#x27;m a bit disappointed especially because the hold doesn&#x27;t last very long, so what&#x27;s the point of taking the time to use it at all.  It does what it says it will do and if you don&#x27;t have anything else you are using and like already then by all means give it a try but if you are using another product and your happy but thought perhaps this was better, it probably isn&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> I like this product.  You have to be patient and only apply small amt at one time or you will be able to see white areas where you have applied the gel. I don&#x27;t think it works on deep wrinkles.  I use it for the bags under my lower eyelids.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok it leaves a white spot were you put it hard to cover use only near the eyes may work better put on very thinly</li>
    <li> While I enjoy other Peter Thomas Roth products, this one just leaves a white film (even if I use the smallest amount) which peels&lt;br /&gt;off my skin. Amazon did a great job getting it to me, and I will continue to use Amazon.</li>
    <li> I purchased this item and it is another product that I wasted money on and will throw this out in the garbage. It comes out watery and when I put it under my eyes it left a horrible film and did absolutely nothing.</li>
    <li> i had this product highly recommended--but i found it creates a crusty hard&lt;br /&gt;bloch around the eyes that flakes off all day--Unfortunately i wore it first&lt;br /&gt;before an all day meeting and it was so embarassing to have my eyes&lt;br /&gt;stared at all day and see the specs flaking off. Why would anyone want this?</li>
    <li> This stuff works and I can not be without it. Once you learn how to apply it ( Which is trickey), the results are fabulous if you have puffiness under the eye area...</li>
    <li> While the product works, it leaves a white residue that you can&#x27;t wipe off or you loose the effect of the product.  The same thing happens when you try to put makeup on over it.  I even tried combining it with the moisturizer and also with the liquid cover. It&#x27;s not worth it.</li>
    <li> Cream is good but you have to becareful not to apply too much because then it cakes and cracks when it dries up. Otherwise is alright.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff!  It really works for me!  I see immediate reduction when I apply it in the morning.  I was skeptical but after trying it, I am hooked and will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> This product works really well. Read the reviews to get an idea how to best apply. A little works better than a lot.</li>
    <li> IT COVERED THE BAGS UNDER MY EYES. i REALLY LIKE IT AND WILL ORDER IT AGAIN IN A FEW MONTHS;</li>
    <li> Have been using this product for a couple years now. I take a pea size amount on the back of my hand and add a very small amount of my foundation and mix with a damp small soft bush. Apply with small soft brush and then gently tape with finger or simply just use soft brush to smooth out. Lasts most of the day.</li>
    <li> I am still wondering if this makes a noticeable change.  I think it does remove some puffiness, but don&#x27;t expect to look years younger.</li>
    <li> I found it almost impossible to put this product on thin enough.  Also.... impossible to put any type of makeup on over it without getting that &#x27;peeled&#x27; skin look.  Maybe for someone who doesn&#x27;t wear makeup.  But, I won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
    <li> I buy this for a male friend of mine.  He is 70 yrs. young and one day as he watched DR.OZ he asked me if I could get this product on Amazon for him for he said Dr. Oz recommended it as an item HE USES AND LOVES because it works.  Well, Eugene said he is not disappointed either for it worked as good as Dr.Oz said it would and he will surely reorder when he gets low.  EUGENE RECOMMENDS THIS HIGHLY</li>
    <li> Wonderful, I have been using for a couple of years. Except I put on after applying my makeup. Works better!</li>
    <li> Get product!  Received it as planned and in a very timely manner.</li>
    <li> This stuff does what it advertises: It firms skin. I was amazed when I saw it literally erase the bags under my eyes. But I don&#x27;t like the product. It&#x27;s like a glue or resin that sticks to the skin and contracts as it dries. This naturally &amp;#34;tightens&amp;#34; just like glue on your face would &amp;#34;tighten.&amp;#34; I noticed I looked great if I didn&#x27;t smile. Once I smile, it almost accentuated new fine lines and wrinkles because I was stretching the glue. It also left a slight white-ish film on my skin. I learned to apply it where it was virtually undetectable but since I don&#x27;t wear much make-up, any little bit of opaque lightening is noticeable. Finally, it kinda burned on my skin and was hard to remove. So while i can see the miracles in this bottle, it wasn&#x27;t for me.</li>
    <li> See my review of the Peter Thomas Roth product that is for firming the whole face.  Both seem to work the same on my eyes, and getting the larger size is cost-effective.</li>
    <li> this so called instant firmx cream is useless, just another unending road to try to help delay wrinkles.  this was totally useless, i would not recommend it for anyone</li>
    <li> It really takes away the puffyness under your eyes.</li>
    <li> I love this eye firm after I used this before I wanted to try something new well guess what came back to this it works I stand behind it.</li>
    <li> What a horrifying result! This product leaves behind a white filmy grit all over your eye area. This looks ridiculous, and I would never go out in public with white smudges all around my eyes. I followed the instructions and even used the most minuscule amount possible and it still left the stains. Tried several times, and each time I inevitably had to wash it off. What a disappointment. It went straight into the trash today.</li>
    <li> I was excited when the product arrived sooner than expected, and I tried it immediately! I could feel the tightening as I watched tv and went to check what I looked like in the mirror and was disappointed. There was white film under my eyes, I looked like a clown. I q tipped it off which took the product off. Once I put the makeup on, it was over. One liquid hits it after it dried, it was like I never had the product on. It would probably work if I didn&#x27;t apply makeup after the application, but will never know. That was the only time I applied it, so its sitting in the medicine cabinet.</li>
    <li> This is no more than egg whites in a fancy package.  I&#x27;ve used egg whites and it&#x27;s exactly the same result which doesn&#x27;t last once wet.  Egg whites will smooth your skin in a matter of minutes, but once it gets moist in any way, like apply foundation, you will lose the results.  I&#x27;m so glad I bought the samples to &amp;#34;try before you buy&amp;#34;.  I spend my money wisely and this is like flushing it down the drain.  Like egg whites it dries giving you a tight feel to your skin, a white residue and then a slight sand like feel when fully dry.  Once I applied foundation that tight look was gone and my face looked like it did before applying the Firmx.  I can&#x27;t say NO to this product enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product title says Firmx Eye.  I used Instant Firmx for whole face.</li>
    <li> Love it!  It is very important to follow the directions in using sparingly.</li>
    <li> I saw this product on dr oz and thought I would give it a try.  I don&#x27;t have many bags under my eyes normally unless I don&#x27;t get any sleep.  When I do put this product on the bags do go away but then you are left with a white stiff cream under your eyes.  It says to wait a bit then wash the product off and I did that but then my bags reappeared.  Not sure why.  My mom, who is 30 years older than me, uses this and loves it. Maybe it just isn&#x27;t for me.</li>
    <li> I was very skeptical about this product when a friend recommended it to me, and then she sent me before and immediately after photos of her own eye and I decided to try it for myself. Let me sum it up simply:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~~~~~~~~~IT REALLY WORKS~~~~~~~~&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Is it temporary? Yes.&lt;br /&gt;Do you have to apply it correctly? Yes, follow the instructions on the tube.&lt;br /&gt;Can you wear makeup over it? Yes.&lt;br /&gt;Can you feel it on your skin? Yes.&lt;br /&gt;Does it leave a white residue? Only if you apply too much.&lt;br /&gt;Can I mix it with other eye products? Yes!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am going to use this on my clients AND myself from now on. I hope PTR never discontinues it!</li>
    <li> not worth it white glue</li>
    <li> Does what it say , I have had no problem applying or using this product&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does exactly what it is created to do!! Just put a match tip amount on your finger to pat under each eyes and rub it in and you are good to go!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok have to work with it to know how much to put on. Just a little a thin film , if to much it makes your eye pull real tight a very uncomfortable feeling on the  eyes. A small about you feel a little pull but not much difference on me.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll keep trying to get it right amount hope it works better</li>
    <li> I used this product as stated on the packaging and did not notice any difference in diminishing fine lines under the eyes. You can feel a tightening afterwards but it does not last very long. I would not recommend this product. Does not accomplish what it advertises to do.</li>
    <li> This product has been life changing.  About 3 years ago I developed bags and dark circles under my eyes.  I had tried many products and none of them worked. Though I have good skin the bags and circles made me look old and tired.  I used this product and it was amazing.  I use it daily.  Overtime I think it actually gets better.  I am now again getting comments on how great I look. One person actually asked if I had plastic surgery.</li>
    <li> Leaves a white paste on your skin.  Does not firm.  Would not recommend.</li>
    <li> I enjoy using this product. When working with the public I often get complimented on how I look. Upon further discussion with women and aging I admit I am 60 yrs young and get surprised expressions from them saying I look like I am in my late 40&#x27;s to early 50&#x27;s.  I recommend this product and even use it above my lip to soften fine lines.  It works there as well as under eyes for fine lines and for me puffiness. If using a little too much just smooth using your ring finger with a miniscule amt of water. It lasts all day until you wash it off!</li>
    <li> Saw this on Dr. Oz and thought if it was half as good as it looked I would be happy.  Have used this and it&#x27;s terrific.  Then I found it on Amazon discounted and was even happier.  It took me one or two applications to get it right but now, every time I use it I get compliments, like...&amp;#34;Boy, you look great!  What have you done?&amp;#34;  I would recommend this product to anyone who has a little puffiness under their eyes....and then I tried it on the deep crease I have between my eyebrows and it worked!  I&#x27;m sold.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a male in my forties. Just got the product about 2.5 hours ago. Immediately went to the  bathroom cleaned my faced, dried it, and applied the cream under my eyes. After a couple of minutes of not moving my facial muscles too much (you can move them afterwards), I looked back into the mirror and the cream had reduced my eye bags down about 90%. This is some weird *ss s***. Yeah, you feel it tightening a bit, bit it&#x27;s really minimal. I&#x27;m sitting here typing this and it&#x27;s still working. I barely notice it anymore. The trick is to use very little of it. I had some residue left over off to the side of my eyes, but I applied a very small amount of lotion and it got rid of that. I have reddish-brown skin, and it only shows up very slighty. Women probably have the advantage of using cosmetics to further conceal the dryness. I have very puffy eyebags, so if you only have small baggage - this will more than likely eliminate yours. Be wary however because as advertised - this is a temporary fix - so when you wash your face or tears flow from your eye, you&#x27;ll probably have to re-apply the product. I&#x27;ve tried the roll-on type serums before, and they don&#x27;t do jack s***. This at least does what it claims to do. It&#x27;s just not permanent. I think it will last at least a full day though.</li>
    <li> AMAZING HOW IT WORKS IN MINUTES!! ALL LINES AND PUFFY UNDER EYES WENT AWAY AND LASTED ALL DAY!! INVEST IN THIS PRODUCT IT WILL BE THE BEST THING YOU&#x27;VE USED!</li>
    <li> Tightens but when you smile it looks wrinkled.  Also, it leaves a white appearance.  Basically you are trading less puff for wrinkles when you laugh or smile.</li>
    <li> Wrinkles and puffiness DEFINITLY dissapearred&lt;br /&gt;But can&#x27;t put any make up over it or it blends away and after awhile it turns white and powdery...so unless I&#x27;m missing a step not good after looking in the mirror for five minutes...I do use face make up and don&#x27;t want the white powder look on my face the rest of the day..:(</li>
    <li> This product works but leaves a white film which you have to cover with make-up, but don&#x27;t brush to hard or it will start to flake off.</li>
    <li> This is a really great product.  I saw  a demo on it on QVC which really helped.  It&#x27;s best to use a tiny amount and apply with a concealer brush.  If you use your finger it&#x27;s too much and doesn&#x27;t go on right.  In this case - less is better.  Takes a few times to get the application correct.</li>
    <li> Love it..  Be careful of putting too much on.. If it gets powdery, spray a bit of water or toner on it.. Pat gently.</li>
    <li> Poor results. Leaves skin around eye crusted and discolored. If one uses a bit of water to soften the results, the firmness disappears.</li>
    <li> The instant firmx eye treatment is a good product; does it job!</li>
    <li> I have always used a similar product for under-eye puffiness and have been very satisfied with it although it is a bit pricey and I cannot get it without shipping costs that I consider too high, or a visit to the manufacturer&#x27;s salon in NYC, which is not always convenient. When I saw Peter Thomas Roth Instant FIRMx Eye on Amazon and read the reviews I was very impressed, so I ordered it.  Good price, and with Amazon Prime, no shipping costs and 2-day delivery!  I was a little skeptical, since I have tried alternatives with nothing that compared to my usual \\&quot;cannot-live-without\\&quot; product.  What delightful results!  This product does what my other product did, is much kinder to my skin and lasts quite a bit longer -- at a far bettr price. I have become a fan!</li>
    <li> I look 10 years younger.</li>
    <li> I got this for my sister and she loves this. She had serious bags and loves this. I actually saw this on dr oz. he said he used it for his puffy eyes.&lt;br /&gt;So now my sister gets this all the Tim</li>
    <li> Works like a charm and I have major bags and circles under my eyes. lasts all day, too. only a small amount needed.</li>
    <li> This product does work, but I am still having trouble with the white residue.....I&#x27;ve tried everything....looks better before I apply makeup. I&#x27;m on the limb right now about this product. I&#x27;ll keep trying and if no results I will have to send it back. Darn! I was hoping for a miracle :-)</li>
    <li> great product, great price</li>
    <li> Works pretty well. I pat on with finger tip then make a cup of coffee by that time ready to put on eye cream.</li>
    <li> After a 2am QVC viewing thanks to my over active 6 month old, I decided to purchase locally because of course I would already be up when the normal stores opened. I am 32 and over the past 18 months have developed very obvious UNDER eye wrinkles extending from my tear trough towards my crows feet area when I smile.  I do not have discoloration or under eye bags.&lt;br /&gt;Big disappointment.  Over the past 3 days I have tried it several times. I do believe it may work for a more mature person that experiences the under eye loss of firmness in this area at all times, not just when smiling. At first try, I did notice there was less wrinkles under one eye than the other. This effect was short lived. I smiled in the mirror a few hours later and the effects had already worn off. It seems to act like a surface glue: if you have thin under eye skin with obvious lines without movement it would probably show more obvious temporary improvement.</li>
    <li> You need to take your time to apply it, but it definitely pays off. And yes, I would recommend it to my friends!</li>
    <li> No it isn&#x27;t cosmetic surgery, but is the next best thing.  Apply a thin layer.  I wore it to work and it lasted a good 9 hours.  I have terrible bags under my eyes and it worked wonders.</li>
    <li> I was reluctant to purchase this because of the negative reviews. It&#x27;s not inexpensive and I hate wasting money on products that don&#x27;t work. I decided to take the plunge, though, because I LOVE PTR products (especially Retinol Fusion PM). I read a few posts online about how to apply (I think using a brush is key) and I also watched Dr. Roth&#x27;s video. My first try was this morning, and I must say I was pretty impressed. I did have some residual white after it dried, but it was easy to clean up with a Q-Tip. I apparently used more on one eye, because my left eye looked great while the right one still had some sagginess. I used it on the deep lines between my brow, too (as shown by Dr. Roth), and that worked pretty well. The problem I have with this product is that while it does lift and smooth, as soon as I smile, the lines around and under my eyes look even more pronounced. I am going to practice a bit more and see if I can resolve this. Overall, though, I am happy with this product. Even though I&#x27;ve only used it once, I do think that I will repurchase. By the way, I tried it on my laugh lines (thinking it wouldn&#x27;t be much different than brow lines). I was wrong; it didn&#x27;t work in that area at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE MAY 13, 2013 -- Well, as much as I&#x27;ve been really trying to love this product, I think I don&#x27;t. It seems like I&#x27;m applying it the same way (and in the same amount) every day, but my results are really inconsistent. Sometimes I can really notice the firming, other times not. Sometimes I get white residue, other times not. When I get the application right, the improvement around my eyes is significant. However, it shouldn&#x27;t be this much work to try to get a product to work properly. Unless I suddenly master this product, I won&#x27;t be buying it again.</li>
    <li> Wasnt satisfied with this at all. Maybe if you didnt use make up to disturb the product placement, or if you never smiled lol which I do alot of. This product is a waste of money Im afraid. I returned it ....</li>
</ol>
