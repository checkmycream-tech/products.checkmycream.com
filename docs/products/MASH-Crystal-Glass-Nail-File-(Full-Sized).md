      <li>I&#x27;m glad I bought this for myself.</li>
      <li>I did not pay any more than I did for these.  </li>
      <li>Anyone looking to try out a glass nail file without spending $20 or more, this is your product.</li>
      <li>The description says that it can be used many times, i just used it once</li>
      <li>This is the first one I&#x27;ve tried, but I think it&#x27;s pretty awesome.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad I ordered two.</li>
      <li>Even on the fine grit side, this file doesn&#x27;t leave a very smooth surface on the nail.</li>
      <li>I love to write good reviews, I really do.</li>
      <li>Besides looking cute, this file smooth the edge of nails.  </li>
      <li>The Swissco brand I got at Sally&#x27;s for $7.50 has been by far the best to hold up and is a much gentler grit.</li>
      <li>I was told by many people that this was a great nail file that would last for ages....</li>
      <li>This nail file is easy and accurate to work with.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not like I&#x27;m using it every day, so it&#x27;s just fine for me.  </li>
      <li>It looks sleek and is easy to use and easy to clean when needed.</li>
      <li>It was good at first, but then the grit did wear out and now I need to order a new file!!!</li>
      <li>It gives a smooth edge and doesn&#x27;t wear out.</li>
      <li>I used this three times, and the nail file is now smooth.</li>
      <li>The texture has started to wear off and go smooth.</li>
      <li>I used the nail file one time and wore it smooth.  </li>
      <li>B00283O7LK Crystal Glass Nail File, 5.5 Inches, Free Carrying Case from Sassella]].  </li>
      <li>The price is low, the shipping was fast, and the file works great!</li>
      <li>So far, this seems like a good purchase as it seems to hold up.</li>
      <li>First time I&#x27;d ever used a crystal nail file and I&#x27;ve really enjoyed it.  </li>
      <li>My girlfriends have all commended on the pretty color as well &#x3D;)</li>
      <li>I recently purchased this one and so far I am very happy with it.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll keep looking for one as good as my last one.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used other glass fingernail files before and they&#x27;ve been great.</li>
      <li>The grit was not attached to the file very securely, and I used it in a normal manner.</li>
      <li>This file is too fine to shape with, so I used a coarser file first, then finished with this.</li>
      <li>does so quickly...</li>
      <li>I thought another glass file would be as good as the first, but obviously not so.</li>
      <li>During my first use, the abrasive material wore right off the surface, leaving the smooth plastic below.  </li>
      <li>Not even worth the nominal cost...</li>
      <li>I guess for such a cheap price, I should have known better.</li>
      <li>It looks more durable than my old one too.</li>
      <li>And this file is so light I feel like a new age person!</li>
      <li>I have no idea why so many people are giving this file good reviews - it&#x27;s completely smooth after a week of use and I could saw back and forth at my nails for an hour and not smooth them out.</li>
      <li>The cheap emery boards do a much better job and even though they only last me a couple of weeks, I get a better return out of them</li>
      <li>Spend a few bucks more and get a better file.</li>
      <li>I agree with many of the reviewers of this nail file - it wore down to smooth glass on both sides during the first use!  </li>
      <li>This item was inexpensive, shipped pretty quickly, and works great to shape nails and avoid those rough edges that lead to nailbiting or clipping them down over and over in an attempt to make them smooth and even.</li>
      <li>When I purchased these (I bought two), I was looking for a file that was more than an emory board, but soemthing that would last.  </li>
      <li>I have never tried glass nail files before so this was my first experience.</li>
      <li>Recently a friend told me about these glass files, saying that they&#x27;re even better for nails than the gemstone files.  </li>
      <li>I think this is my first 1 star review.  </li>
      <li>I have used and loved glass files in the past.</li>
      <li>My other glass file never worn down, was good for over 2 years and was still going strong when I accidentally dropped and shattered it.</li>
      <li>The little pouch it comes with is a nice added protection so it doesn&#x27;t chip or break.</li>
      <li>The problem with this file is, the filing surface (you know, the scratchy part) doesn&#x27;t come all the way to the very edge of the file.  </li>
      <li>It leaves a much smoother surface than anything else I have ever used.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve only used it once, but so far it seems a lot better.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll return it to Amazon ASAP even though it&#x27;s more trouble than it&#x27;s worth.</li>
      <li>I have had probably 4 different glass file brands and this one was more course than all of them and the grit wore off faster than other cheap brands.  </li>
      <li>Signs of that are apparent after my very first use.</li>
      <li>and you will avoid that particular misfortune.&lt;br /&gt;Love</li>
      <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s small enough to fit in my make-up bag or purse easily with the rest of my supplies.</li>
      <li>This product, the MASH Crystal Glass Nail File (Full Sized), purchased four of them, did not live up to my expectations.</li>
      <li>They apologized and sent me a new one.</li>
      <li>Even when it was new, it took forever to shape my nails.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s exactly as pictured and works terrific!  </li>
      <li>I actually went and ordered a set of 5, just wanted to test out the one first.  </li>
      <li>If I didn&#x27;t know better, I may not have noticed how ordinary this nail file is.  </li>
      <li>It worn down and is smooth after 2 weeks.</li>
      <li>This file is about the same size as an average emery board, but is much better on my nails.</li>
      <li>the grit is pretty temporary, there are definitely areas of the file that are already completely worn and smooth after only minimal use.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I was told by many people that this was a great nail file that would last for ages.... So not true.  I&#x27;m a massage therapist so I must keep my nails filed down.  I used this file about every other day or so for maybe a month, possibly a little longer, but after a few weeks it just wasn&#x27;t getting the job done anymore. The cheap emery boards do a much better job and even though they only last me a couple of weeks, I get a better return out of them then I got out of this crystal nail file.</li>
    <li> The price is low, the shipping was fast, and the file works great! It&#x27;s small enough to fit in my make-up bag or purse easily with the rest of my supplies. I&#x27;m very satisfied with this product, and recommend purchasing it.</li>
    <li> This nail file is easy and accurate to work with. I&#x27;m glad I bought this for myself. It&#x27;s a nice way to self-indulge and the end product is all you!</li>
    <li> The file lasted for a few weeks, but wore away.  I liked it at first, but when the crystals wore away, it was difficult to file with empty spots where the crystals used to be.</li>
    <li> I wish I could give this 0 stars.  If I were giving it 1 star per use then I guess it would rate 2 or 3 stars.  I got this to keep my nails filed for piano practice, but the rough coating wore off almost instantly.  Don&#x27;t buy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m trying this one now - [[ASIN:B00283O7LK Crystal Glass Nail File, 5.5 Inches, Free Carrying Case from Sassella]].  I&#x27;ve only used it once, but so far it seems a lot better.  UPDATE: I&#x27;ve use the Sassella one three times now and it shows no signs of wear, unlike this MASH which was unusable after three times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I can&#x27;t believe they actually claim,&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;A permanent file that never wears out\\&quot; ...pshh</li>
    <li> After reading about the benefits of using glass or crystal nail files from InStyle magazine, I decided to purchase one. I was pleasantly surprised when I found the product at my door only 2-3 days after the order. The nail file works very well and unlike traditional nail files, it doesn&#x27;t feel like sandpaper. Although it is slightly like scratching a blackboard (minus the sound!) Now I keep it in my purse and it travels everywhere with me. The little pouch it comes with is a nice added protection so it doesn&#x27;t chip or break. My girlfriends have all commended on the pretty color as well &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> I used this three times, and the nail file is now smooth. The grit was not attached to the file very securely, and I used it in a normal manner. The grit came off on my nail leaving bare, shiny spots on the file. Simply put, I do not recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Looked for one of these for the longest time, but they were all so expensive.  I hate the feeling of regular nail files, and this one works well without that weird sandpaper feeling.  Just wish it had a case.</li>
    <li> This file is about the same size as an average emery board, but is much better on my nails. This is the first one I&#x27;ve tried, but I think it&#x27;s pretty awesome. It gives a smooth edge and doesn&#x27;t wear out. As for dropping it ... Just use it sitting at a table or something and you will avoid that particular misfortune.&lt;br /&gt;Love that the file comes in a little slip-in pouch, as well.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used a crystal nail file in the past and liked it a lot, but unfortunately I dropped it and it broke. I recently purchased this one and so far I am very happy with it. It looks more durable than my old one too.</li>
    <li> When I purchased these (I bought two), I was looking for a file that was more than an emory board, but soemthing that would last.  During my first use, the abrasive material wore right off the surface, leaving the smooth plastic below.  Good thing I did not pay any more than I did for these.  If I can find the second one I purchased, I will return them both.</li>
    <li> Not worth it!  It was good at first, but then the grit did wear out and now I need to order a new file!!!</li>
    <li> I should have been less stingy when looking for a glass nail file. The etched glass does not go all the way to the edge, making it hard to use, especially for a short-nailed person like myself. It also seems to be eroding already (had for about 2 weeks). Spend a few bucks more and get a better file.</li>
    <li> I love, love, love this file. I keep it in my handbag for touch ups. It looks sleek and is easy to use and easy to clean when needed. It does not leave ruff edges or snags. I&#x27;m glad I ordered two. My nails thank you!!!!</li>
    <li> I have thin, fragile nails, (darn it) but this product is very sensitive to my nails needs. It does the job without shredding my nails and seem to last and last without deteriorating. Try it, you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
    <li> Very happy with my purchase.  It&#x27;s exactly as pictured and works terrific!  Recommended. Anyone looking to try out a glass nail file without spending $20 or more, this is your product.</li>
    <li> This item was inexpensive, shipped pretty quickly, and works great to shape nails and avoid those rough edges that lead to nailbiting or clipping them down over and over in an attempt to make them smooth and even. Recommended.</li>
    <li> I have never tried glass nail files before so this was my first experience. Terrible!  After using a couple of times, the roughness of the surface wore off w/hardly any pressure against my soft nails. I hope all of them are not like this. Usually I look at reviews before purchasing anything but didn&#x27;t this time.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a crystal file for some time now and never found one that I liked. this one was amazing! It&#x27;s thick enough that i dont feel like I&#x27;m going to break it by putting pressure on it and yet the tip is small enough to get to the edges of my nails. I am totally going to buy this again for friends as stocking stuffers for Christmas.</li>
    <li> This file is junk. It wore out after 2 uses. Even when it was new, it took forever to shape my nails. I purchased the file when I read about the benefits of a crystal file on a nail blog. I guess for such a cheap price, I should have known better.</li>
    <li> I have used and loved glass files in the past. I&#x27;ve only used this one a few times and already the roughness of the file is wearing down to nothing but a smooth and useless piece of glass. Very disappointing.</li>
    <li> I love to write good reviews, I really do. My sister bought one and loved it so I bought one. It sounded great. A nail file that wound&#x27;t wear down after a week. Crappy paper nail files lasted longer than this one did. It worn down and is smooth after 2 weeks. Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
    <li> This is a nice nail file; definitely better than an emery board type of file. However, it does seem like the grit is pretty temporary, there are definitely areas of the file that are already completely worn and smooth after only minimal use.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used diamond files for years with great results.  Recently a friend told me about these glass files, saying that they&#x27;re even better for nails than the gemstone files.  I decided to try this one.  I agree with many of the reviewers of this nail file - it wore down to smooth glass on both sides during the first use!  There may be good files available but I&#x27;m afraid that for my money, this isn&#x27;t it.  I&#x27;m very disappointed in this product.  I&#x27;ll try somewhere else.  It&#x27;s probably not the glass technology, but the manufacturing process in this case.</li>
    <li> I love these nail files. I have thin nails and I am ruff on my hands. These nail files are great for me and as a gift as well. They make my hands feel better.</li>
    <li> I used the nail file one time and wore it smooth.  Did not even finish all fingers. Not worth the money.</li>
    <li> No more bump and grind. Just slip slide those ragged edges away. And this file is so light I feel like a new age person!</li>
    <li> Lasted one use. Would give zero if I could. The 5 stars must be fake. Awful product. Not even worth the few bucks.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my daughter. She likes it but the texture is a bit different and takes a little getting use to.</li>
    <li> I was expecting this to be similar to my last glass nail file. The abrasive sides are just too dull to really file anything down. I intended to use this mainly on my infant daughter&#x27;s nails, and all it does is bend her nails back without filing, regardless of pressure. I tried it on mine, and it didn&#x27;t even do the job.</li>
    <li> I used this nail file just once on two fingernails before the abrasive glass came off permanently. I&#x27;ve used other glass fingernail files before and they&#x27;ve been great. In fact I only bought this one to supplement the one I bought over 5 years ago and have used weekly ever since. I&#x27;ve worn out other files including diamond coated ones before, but never as quickly as this. I thought another glass file would be as good as the first, but obviously not so. I&#x27;ll return it to Amazon ASAP even though it&#x27;s more trouble than it&#x27;s worth.</li>
    <li> Great glass file for the price. It&#x27;s not a tiny travel one either- it&#x27;s full sized and works great!! For this size and quality, I would expect to have to pay at least 3x the price. Very satisfied!  Update: The texture has started to wear off and go smooth. My NAILS filed it off! It worked for about 3 files :(</li>
    <li> I think this is my first 1 star review.  Bought this a couple months ago after breaking my glass/crystal file of 2+ years that I just loved.  Couldn&#x27;t find the same one and purchased this one.  Bad move, the \\&quot;grit\\&quot; that files your nails down is some kind of coating that just rubs off as you file your nails.  I can&#x27;t even use this anymore and back on Amazon to buy a new one of another brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For more info: I use this file couple times a month when I trim all my nails short and this file is now unusable after maybe 6 uses.  My other glass file never worn down, was good for over 2 years and was still going strong when I accidentally dropped and shattered it.</li>
    <li> Besides looking cute, this file smooth the edge of nails.  It is much better to file with glass file versus a paper one.</li>
    <li> I love frosted glass and crystal things, so this was very appealing when I saw it.  As the other reviews claimed, the file material film did come off right away in one spot so far.  But I keep it in my purse and pull it out whenever I need it.  It&#x27;s not like I&#x27;m using it every day, so it&#x27;s just fine for me.  I actually went and ordered a set of 5, just wanted to test out the one first.  But it&#x27;s cheaper to buy in larger amounts and they will last a long time in my opinion.</li>
    <li> The nail file stuff comes off when you use it. The description says that it can be used many times, i just used it once and it no longer files. I am returning this file, as it is cheaply made and a waste of money.</li>
    <li> This product, the MASH Crystal Glass Nail File (Full Sized), purchased four of them, did not live up to my expectations. The files worked for a few uses then the grit coating began to fail and fall off rendering the file useless. While it did work, it did a very good job. I would consider a different brand the next time I make a crystal nail file purchase.</li>
    <li> My mom bought me a glass nail file, and I used it for years.  Then I stupidly packed it in the front pocket of a suitcase, and when the baggage handlers played football with my luggage, it broke.  The problem with this file is, the filing surface (you know, the scratchy part) doesn&#x27;t come all the way to the very edge of the file.  Or maybe the glass is too thick.  If you have short nails, it&#x27;s hard to get it underneath the nail to a place where it files nicely.  I&#x27;ll keep looking for one as good as my last one.  At least I didn&#x27;t spend a lot.</li>
    <li> The rough part wore off very fast (after 3 manicures) leaving a smooth patches on the file which is pointless. Save your money.</li>
    <li> Great item ... files smoothly and can be washed. I highly recommend buying a few to keep in various places as well as in your purse.</li>
    <li> I found this nail file to work great. I lost one my sister had given me and didn&#x27;t want to go back to the emery board type. I ordered the Mash file and love it. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I have no idea why so many people are giving this file good reviews - it&#x27;s completely smooth after a week of use and I could saw back and forth at my nails for an hour and not smooth them out.</li>
    <li> Even on the fine grit side, this file doesn&#x27;t leave a very smooth surface on the nail. The abrasive is also held on by adhesive which means it will eventually become a bald glass blank. Signs of that are apparent after my very first use. I&#x27;m still searching for a quality crystal file, and this one wasn&#x27;t even close. Not even worth the nominal cost...</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t realize there could be a difference among glass nail files, but I was surprised at how inferior this was to the Sephora ones I buy.  It lost all of its &amp;#34;grain&amp;#34; very quickly and just became smooth glass -- worthless, of course, at actually filing my nails.  I&#x27;m sticking to the Sephora brand from now on.</li>
    <li> I ordered this item and it came broken in half, even though it was wrap up pretty well.  It was a good idea, had it worked.</li>
    <li> I have owned this product for just over 1 year. The ad says it is a &amp;#34;permanent&amp;#34; nail file that never wears out. Well, mine has the abrasive worn out in the middle on both sides. I&#x27;m a guy and don&#x27;t sit around filing my nails, usually do that only when I have roughed one up working. This file is too fine to shape with, so I used a coarser file first, then finished with this. It did a good job of that until the abrasive started wearing out. If you use it very often, it won&#x27;t last long. Can&#x27;t complain about Amazon, though, because they gave me a refund. Great customer service from Amazon.</li>
    <li> I purchased this nail file as a replacement for another glass file I bought and broke.  If I didn&#x27;t know better, I may not have noticed how ordinary this nail file is.  With my other glass file, my nails were on point.  Whatever I filed only required one or two swipes, not the endless back and forth motion typical of emery files.  This glass file is simply not as sharp.  I am not happy with this purchase and will be purchasing a different brand of glass file.</li>
    <li> I bought a nail file that would be better for my nails and that is just what I got. Its nothing spectacular. Just a nail file.</li>
    <li> I had been told how wonderful a glass nail file was so I decided to try one.  It leaves a much smoother surface than anything else I have ever used.  I recommend the glass nail file.</li>
    <li> I have had probably 4 different glass file brands and this one was more course than all of them and the grit wore off faster than other cheap brands.  The Swissco brand I got at Sally&#x27;s for $7.50 has been by far the best to hold up and is a much gentler grit.</li>
    <li> So far, this seems like a good purchase as it seems to hold up. I can&#x27;t stand using a file, but my husband loves it and it doesn&#x27;t break down so like a regular cheap file does so quickly... only time will tell how well it will hold up over time.</li>
    <li> I hsve just had this file a few months and the grit just comes right off the glass! What a peice of JUNK. This is not one of those aewsome files that will last you forever because it us molded glass. This one is coated with some gritty coating that will come rigth off the file. HATE.</li>
    <li> This nail file was worthless after only using 2 times. The file texture rubbed off. I called the company to complain. They apologized and sent me a new one. The same thing happened with the new one.</li>
    <li> First time I&#x27;d ever used a crystal nail file and I&#x27;ve really enjoyed it.  GOOD PRODUCT and I will be buying more.</li>
