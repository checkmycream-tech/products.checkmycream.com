<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> It&#x27;s pretty good but, be aware 0.34 oz is very tiny</li>
    <li> Just what teens were looking for!</li>
    <li> This is the best product.  We use it for glow parties and it shows up beautifully in the blacklight. It doesn&#x27;t require much paint so don&#x27;t be discouraged by the small tube size.</li>
    <li> This was just what I expected. I searched many products before selecting this one because it came with the multiple colors. I used a tiny brush to apply designs on my and my bf&#x27;s face for a blacklight Halloween party we had and the colors glowed really well. There is still plenty to use for the future even though the tubes seem really small.</li>
    <li> Good product. This is enough to lavishly decorate about 5-7 partiers. Dries to an almost chalky consistency (still gets everywhere though).</li>
    <li> Bought these for the electric run for my friends and I to use on our faces. The bottles are small but there were 5 of us and there was plenty left over. The colors are vibrant so you don&#x27;t need to use a whole lot. Dried fast and didn&#x27;t smear even while we were running. It glows super bright under the uv black light.</li>
    <li> This worked perfectly! It was so bright. It dried nicely and didn&#x27;t flake or smudge despite hours of dancing with it on.</li>
    <li> The paint looked cool on, but it didn&#x27;t really glow in the black lights at all. And the tubes were TINY. Kind of disappointed.</li>
    <li> Did not glow in the dark but the kids had fun painting themselves.</li>
    <li> A little goes a long way! Some colors show up better than others, but that is expected. We used it for a scaring party and it was a huge hit!</li>
    <li> Super bright and awesome under black light- a huge hit!</li>
    <li> Pink and Orange glow the same color (orange) but they look great!!!! PERFECT!</li>
    <li> These work really well with UV lights, slightly messy but they&#x27;re a big hit at raves</li>
    <li> this stuff is crazy bright in the day time as well. didnt get sun with it on so idk if the uv reaction is good or not when it gets dark, but it does glow very nicely in sunlight</li>
    <li> Not a lot of product for the price - but it&#x27;s certainly quality over quantity.</li>
    <li> It certainly works, but in the glow lights the green and yellow/ red and orange are indistinguishable. Best &amp;#34;wow&amp;#34; colours are definitely pink, blue, and yellow. Would have given five stars, but it has to applied rather liberally as it is very thin.</li>
    <li> This stuff works great!</li>
    <li> Not only did this glow really nicely, it painted on nicely...didn&#x27;t run, we were able to do designs with and without stencils, just with regular paint brushes.  It looked good with and without the glow lights.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We did a 5k in this stuff.  It rained.  And then we went to a dance party.  By the end of the night, we were all still glowing, still pretty.  And when I got home, it came off easily with soap and water...not even scrubbing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t say enough great things about this paint!  If you are doing a glow run, or if you just want some glow paint for whatever, this is awesome stuff.</li>
    <li> Bought these for a friend&#x27;s BLACKLIGHT party. They were awesome and did a great job at glowing in the dark, especially if right under a blacklight. Application was a little difficult because you have to use a paintbrush and some colors were harder to apply than others. Other than that they were a big hit! We ended up having a face painting party in the middle of a college BLACKLIGHT party!</li>
    <li> Great product. May need to order larger amount as these are .34 of an oz and very small.</li>
    <li> Definitely works as intended.  Just be aware of the size of the bottles when purchasing, because this stuff can get expensive if you need a lot of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Glows well in my blacklight, and it&#x27;s perfect for EDC which is the intended reason I bought it.  I would personally pair this up with a cheaper UV body paint, and use this stuff for your face and smaller details, while using a thicker, cheaper UV paint for the rest of your body, especially if you want just one color the be primary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, with regards to the product, a little paint can go a long way if you know what you&#x27;re doing, so although I wasn&#x27;t aware of the size (I probably should have read the description), I&#x27;m still happy about my purchase.</li>
    <li> We do black light services for our kids at church.  This was a hit and worked well.  Goes on easy and comes off easy. Would recommend.</li>
    <li> Great even shows up on dark skin! Perfect for raves or black light parties!</li>
    <li> These UV Glow Blacklight Face and Body paints are so much fun!  6 brilliant  Neon colors in convenient easy to use tubes!  My main concern using these would that it would take to long to dry or rub off and smear. But its just the opposite! They dry super fast, and you can literally rub hard and it does not come off or smear! Stays on until you wash it off with soap &amp; water! We visit haunted houses every year and everyone gets into the mood, these are going to be so awesome for the kids to use/wear when we go! Glow super bright and the colors are amazing!  These would work great for sleepovers, club goers, or even to add a bit of &amp;#34;spice&amp;#34; to your bedroom ;)  All you need is a black florescent light and the possibilities are endless!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received these at a discounted rate in exchange for my honest unbiased review.</li>
    <li> Paints work great under blacklights.  They don&#x27;t glow anywhere else.  The colors are bright and fun for dance parties.</li>
    <li> Bought this paint for a rave party run. There was enough paint to cover me head to toe with sone still left over for friends faces and arms. The paint had a very nice color, each one be distinct and vibrant without mixing together to form brown. I git the paint in my hair and eyes with little consequence. I even drove home shirtless covered in paint and didn&#x27;t color the car seat. At the end of the night most of the paint washed off in the shower, a few stains needed a little soap to come off, but nothing stayed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately I can&#x27;t speak to the UV effect of this paint as there were no blacklights at the eventsl.</li>
    <li> These are cool and can&#x27;t wait to use them @ parties!</li>
    <li> Loved the items, felt it was a bit small in unit qty.</li>
    <li> Purchased these because they had good reviews, but for the money, there should have been a lot more product.  The tubes were tiny.</li>
    <li> Worked great at the scene! Everyone loved it and it glowed forever!</li>
    <li> product does not apply well, could not use. Ended up using neon easter egg dye kit by McCormick from Walmart for $3 - which worked perfectly</li>
    <li> Love it! The blue didn&#x27;t really glow like the rest, but blue rarely does so I wasn&#x27;t surprised. I got so many compliments! My makeup was definitely the talk of neon night!</li>
    <li> These were great! Glowed brightly in blacklight, and was fun to apply. We used a tiny paintbrush so the small tubes lasted through the first use and are still going strong.</li>
    <li> These glow paints are really neat.  My daughter is going to a blacklight party and she was so excited when they came.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They were a little smaller than what I thought it would be.  The tub is like a lip gloss.  When you first open the tub you have to take the silver lining off.  It kept it from leaking in travel and fresh.  The colors are bright and fun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She could not wait to try them out.  She painted her hand and nails.  We had a UV light that she used to see if they glowed.  They glowed really well.  The blue, green, and pink showed up the best.  The Orange and yellow did not show as brightly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They washed off with warm soapy water.  I can say one downfall that I saw.  They do wipe off easily which is &#x27;m it good when you are trying to look a certain way for the party.  My daughter however said it was fine for her.  She said once pictures are over she was planning on washing most of it off as well.  She is happy with the product and that is all that matters.  I added that it comes off easily in case you are wanting something to stay on for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I teach and I plan on using this paint on black paper to paint our letter of the week.  Use the UV light to show the letter of the week.  I think the kids will enjoy seeing the letter light up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I am very pleased with the paints.  The tubs are about the size of a lip gloss.  They go on very smooth and dry fast.. It washes off easy with soap and water.  The downside is the paint comes off really easy even without soap and water.  My daughter is happy with the paint.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product at a discount in order to  give my honest and unbiased opinion.</li>
    <li> haven&#x27;t used them yet, but I&#x27;m sure they will be what I expect.</li>
    <li> This UV Glow Blacklight Face and body paint is so much fun to use!&lt;br /&gt;We were headed to a 4th of July party yesterday so we decided to give it a whirl!&lt;br /&gt;The pack comes with a variety of 6 colors.&lt;br /&gt;The tubes are small, BUT you don&#x27;t need a lot of product, spread it more if you can to help make it last.&lt;br /&gt;The product spreads very easily and does not get all oily and goopy, I knead the tube prior to use too, which helps.&lt;br /&gt;Some colors are very similar once on and under the light, red and orange are a lot alike.&lt;br /&gt;I would use a design with colors with drastic differences between them to make it stand out!&lt;br /&gt;The product was easy to squeeze from the tube and easy to apply.&lt;br /&gt;The only reason this is 4 stars and not 5 is the size, but the quality for the cost is there!&lt;br /&gt;This washed off with warm water and soap with ease.&lt;br /&gt;I was lucky enough to receive this product at a promotional discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review,</li>
    <li> I love these neon paints.</li>
    <li> Colors are great. very bright but the tubes are really small.</li>
    <li> Great product!! Arrived when it should have. Thanks!</li>
    <li> The second main ingredient used in this paint is formeldahyde, a substance used to embalm and preserve corpses. Among with numerous other toxins that are not listed on the Amazon page, this product is a piece of poisonous junk that is not suitable for a body or face paint. I would avoid at all costs unless you like intentionally poisoning and damaging your mind, body, and spirit.</li>
    <li> It is a great product and it meet all my needs and wants for the event I needed it for.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t realize there were so many cancer causing ingredients. Won&#x27;t use.</li>
    <li> Beautiful colors that glow like crazy under blacklight but are still bright without!!</li>
    <li> okay i never thought these would work but they were a hit and do exactly what they say</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m all about writing truthful reviews! So here it is, at first considering the price and how tiny the bottles are, I was hesitant of my husband ordering them. However, once they came in and he applied them, the color was exceptional and it has a lot more paint than you&#x27;d think. Also, the Cora are very bright and neon, as he ordered them! Totally happy!</li>
    <li> My son is having his 5th birthday party at a black light laser tag place.  This is going to be awesome for the kids to &amp;#34;warpaint&amp;#34; themselves before they head back to the black lights!  The colors are all super bright and vivid and i cant wait to snag some amazing photos.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product at a reduced cost in exchange for my personal and unbiased review.</li>
    <li> green was excellent. pink was great. orange didn&#x27;t light up much</li>
    <li> I was VERY disappointed by the tube size.  For reference, each is about the size of my thumb.</li>
    <li> THEY EXPLODED EVERYWHERE &amp;#62;:(</li>
    <li> Tubes are tiny. Paint doesn&#x27;t glow very bright. Disappointment city. Quickest shipping of all stuff I ordered, though. That I appreciated.</li>
    <li> Glows well - came on time - orange, red and pink look VERY similar - try different application methods - unsatisfied customers should have paid more attention to the  listing in regards to size</li>
    <li> These tubes are tiny, like the size of your pinkie finger.&lt;br /&gt;Really bad value. It&#x27;s almost like a lipstick.&lt;br /&gt;I was expecting normal paint tube sizes.</li>
    <li> I ordered a few different kinds of neon paint and this was the best. All of the colors are black light reactive.</li>
    <li> These do not glow in the dark ! Would not buy these again</li>
    <li> These little tubes go a long way and they are bright neon. The kids loved them at the black light birthday party..</li>
    <li> Very hard to clean off and does not wash out of clothes easily</li>
    <li> This was a great product. Glowed better than expected. I originally thought it was priced high when ordered, but it totally worth the price for how cool the faces looked in the black light:) Also, although the tubes looked really small when they arrived, we had plenty left over after painting 6 face (mind you not all filled in the paint, but still) definitely recommended.</li>
    <li> Very bright colors. They look awesome under the blacklight. The pink and orange paints are very similar in color.</li>
    <li> This is by far the best body paint I have ever used. I recently bought it for EDC and I couldn&#x27;t have made a better decision. Not only did it look fantastic under the blacklight (however blue didn&#x27;t really show) but it didn&#x27;t sweat off. Throughout the night I danced and sprayed water on myself to keep cool. Never once is the paint smear, fade or drip. Even after I got in the shower the paint still didn&#x27;t budge. It wasn&#x27;t until I washed it with soap did it come off. No scrubbing, just wiping. Literally best low maintenance body paint I have ever used. Do I wish the blue showed up better? Yes, but everything else about this paint was absolutely perfect. I look forward to buying this paint again!</li>
    <li> I do not like it, when it dry ,it start to crack,looks ugly and not glow on the dark, I will not recommend it.</li>
    <li> Fun product worked so good and it&#x27;s so amazing you don&#x27;t need a lot and it lastes long the cool thing is that it dosent rub off but it does come off with wipe</li>
    <li> They really don&#x27;t glow all that well</li>
    <li> Worked very well. Would recommend.</li>
    <li> Took almost two weeks to arrive. So had to take a star off for that. Really small tubes. Another star. And it has to be applied kinda thick for good effect. So 2 stars in total.</li>
    <li> very bright...good color. Unfortunately, can be seen in natural light conditions, not just under black light.</li>
    <li> As described, and small.</li>
    <li> Took forever to get to me... I think this comes from the UK that&#x27;s why it took so long to receive. The bottles are really little and its doesn&#x27;t come off very easy you have to scrub it off. It does dry quick though that was about the best thing about it.</li>
    <li> Had abundant paint but paint didn&#x27;t glow in UV Light.</li>
    <li> I was a bit concerned after reading a few of the reviews regarding the sizes of the tubes. Yes, they are small but more than enough for my daughters Glow in the Dark Dance Rave Party.  The girls loved them and they glowed so brightly under the black light... We had 7 kids and plenty left over for the adults!</li>
    <li> These come in very small tubes. But they go a long way. We had a party with about 45 people and I Still have lots of paint left! Glows perfect under blacklight</li>
    <li> These were awesome paints!! Easy to paint on, really bright under black lights and easy to wash off!</li>
    <li> SUPER, SUPER BRIGHT NEON COLOR. A BIT ON THE WATERY SIDE, BUT IT WAS PERFECT FOR THE BLACKLIGHT RUN&#x3D;D</li>
    <li> Received a shipment of these and the blue was busted inside. Disappointed.</li>
    <li> Loved the colors, loved the consistency. It does flake a bit when it dries but I just touched up as needed. My only complaint is the size of the tubes. I ran out too quickly! Will purchase again.</li>
    <li> Pricey but really glows on black light</li>
    <li> Was amazing and worked</li>
    <li> This worked perfect! We used these at a party with just two or three uv lights and it looked awesome. I would buy again.</li>
    <li> It is great.  Very reflective with black lights.  We will be using it in  our puppet ministry.  Thanks you so much for a great product.</li>
    <li> water washable, good color, good price.</li>
    <li> KIDS LOVED IT FOR THEIR BLACKLIGHT DANCE</li>
    <li> The glow paints comes in a travel size toothpaste shaped tube. The colors in the set are blue pink yellow green red and orange.  Honestly the red looks more like a darker orange. My favorite colors out of the whole set are the pink yellow and blue since they are more vivid and true to color. They wash right off and doesn&#x27;t leave a stain on the skin. I would set them under light for about 30 minutes to charge the glow. I&#x27;ll be using these as face paint for my daughter&#x27;s glow slumber party. I know the girls will love it! I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest review and all opinions are mine.</li>
    <li> Really glowed at black light party! My daughter and her friends loved it!</li>
    <li> Lots of fun with my boyfriend on his b day</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t glow!  Expensive product for nothing.</li>
    <li> The colors were bright and bold but it didn&#x27;t glow in the dark like I hoped it would.  We didn&#x27;t get under a black light to test it.  But we had fun with it</li>
    <li> These worked great with the black lights! So fun!</li>
    <li> Paint didn&#x27;t really work at all.</li>
    <li> was as described used for Halloween. arrived on time great product.</li>
    <li> No complaints&lt;br /&gt;Works very well</li>
