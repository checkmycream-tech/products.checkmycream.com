      <li>I love this fragrance..</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s one of my favorite</li>
      <li>Much better priced than Ulta where I tried the fragrance out.</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>I love the smell.</li>
      <li>Found it cheaper on Amazon, love it.</li>
      <li>Great product at a reasonable price ...</li>
      <li>Bright crystal absolu is stronger than the regular bright</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s so light and refreshing,</li>
      <li>Well, the fragrance is good, but it sprays too much and I&#x27;m drenched in this perfume.</li>
      <li>accurate product.</li>
      <li>I was nervous because in the picture the bottle looked light</li>
      <li>Shipped fast, smells amazing.</li>
      <li>I like the light</li>
      <li>My new favorite perfume!</li>
      <li>it is edp whereas the regular bright crystal is edt).</li>
      <li>Similar to original but slightly more potent than original.</li>
      <li>Before buying ANY perfumes, try them on, and then buy from this company as they are really stand-up and deserve your business :)</li>
      <li>My new favorite.  </li>
      <li>Smell great as the one I have previously tested over at macys store.</li>
      <li>but I trust this seller and have made other successful purchases.</li>
      <li>It is light, very feminine, and and floral.</li>
      <li>fresh (sweeter)  scent.  </li>
      <li>The perfume arrived very very fast.</li>
      <li>The item was exactly what I was expecting.</li>
      <li>I got this fragrance as Sephora sample and fell in love, so I bought the big bottle.</li>
      <li>personal favorite</li>
      <li>I first came across this perfume when I got a sample of it in my Sephora package.</li>
      <li>Thanks for saving me a ton of money, Amazon!</li>
      <li>Product exactly as described.</li>
      <li>However, I must say the company is VERY nice, and against their policy, after I submitted an A-Z complaint with Amazon...</li>
      <li>On me the regular bright crystal only lasts about a hour or two.</li>
      <li>I wore the EDT for so long until my husband got me the Edu de parfum which has such good  staying power as compared to the EDT.</li>
      <li>far too strong, not the soft one in the store</li>
      <li>Now I need to go buy one of those perfume bottle with a spray air bag thingy to control how much of it I want.</li>
      <li>yet very noticeable when you wear it.</li>
      <li>fast shipping.</li>
      <li>the smell is real and lasts ALLL day and even DAYSS.</li>
      <li>and I really like it.</li>
      <li>Quick and easy purchase would definitely buy again from same buyer.</li>
      <li>This Edu de parfum is genuine and has the same staying power as purchases from Sephora without the high price tag.</li>
      <li>I received a paper sample of this perfume and LOVED it, carried it around for 6 months, rubbed it on me until the scent would no longer transfer, and finally, I broke down and ordered it.  </li>
      <li>If you like strong sharp scents, this is not for you.  </li>
      <li>but when I received it, it was exactly the same as the one at Sephora.</li>
      <li>Smelling like a French whore, just a whore, or like a dog trainer who doesn&#x27;t want to smell like dogs too much.</li>
      <li>I THINK THAT THE PRODUCT IS OLD.  </li>
      <li>I have 2 old bottles @</li>

    <li> I don&#x27;t buy anything but Versace Bright Crystal &amp;, now that I&#x27;ve found Absolu, I love it even more. People always comment favorably when I&#x27;m wearing it.</li>
    <li> Smells great.  Similar to original but slightly more potent than original. Best Value!</li>
    <li> Great deal on Amazon! Much better priced than Ulta where I tried the fragrance out. Nice bright floral scent, not over-powering.</li>
    <li> Smells great! Only reason I gave it four stars vs five is because the scent doesn&#x27;t last long.  Not sure if it&#x27;s perhaps my body &amp;#34;toxins&amp;#34;? Regardless, looks legit, smells legit.</li>
    <li> Got this for my Mom on Mothers Day, she is absolutely in love with it!</li>
    <li> Wonderful fragrance, great price, highly recommended</li>
    <li> Just what I expected,</li>
    <li> The product met my expectations</li>
    <li> Love this perfume.  I get compliments all the time on it.  My new favorite.  Great price</li>
    <li> Shipped fast, smells amazing. The bottle is cute and the packaging is really beautiful. I first came across this perfume when I got a sample of it in my Sephora package. Found it cheaper on Amazon, love it.</li>
    <li> Bright crystal absolu is stronger than the regular bright crystal(because it is edp whereas the regular bright crystal is edt). On me the regular bright crystal only lasts about a hour or two. I love the smell. The bottle is a bit gaudy though. I don&#x27;t mind, it&#x27;s what it smells like that truly matters.</li>
    <li> Absolutely incredible value! Thanks for saving me a ton of money, Amazon!</li>
    <li> I love bright crystal and have been wearing since 2012, I get so many compliments and my husband loves it on me. It is light, very feminine, and and floral. I wore the EDT for so long until my husband got me the Edu de parfum which has such good  staying power as compared to the EDT. I am always hesitant purchasing fragrances online but I trust this seller and have made other successful purchases. This Edu de parfum is genuine and has the same staying power as purchases from Sephora without the high price tag. The fragrance arrived 2 days after my order was placed. I recommend without hesitation.</li>
    <li> My new favorite perfume!</li>
    <li> Not the same as the fragrance I have purchase in the department stores.</li>
    <li> Absolu-tely LOVE this perfume!!..</li>
    <li> I love this Versace Perfume. It&#x27;s one of my favorite and it&#x27;s so light and refreshing, yet very noticeable when you wear it.</li>
    <li> Quick and easy purchase would definitely buy again from same buyer. Smells amazing !</li>
    <li> far too strong, not the soft one in the store</li>
    <li> Very quick shipping! Product exactly as described. Very happy with this purchase. Will be buying again.</li>
    <li> The item was exactly what I was expecting. I was nervous because in the picture the bottle looked light but when I received it, it was exactly the same as the one at Sephora. The scent stays on all day!!! I love it.</li>

    <li> Amazing and it was a great deal I&#x27;m so happy with it . I saved money</li>

    <li> I love it! And so does everyone else!</li>
    <li> Love this scent. Great price.</li>
    <li> Scent is an individual preference.  I like the light fresh (sweeter)  scent.  This is not fruity or something that is baking in the oven.  If you like strong sharp scents, this is not for you.  The scent lasts all day without reapplying.</li>
    <li> I got this fragrance as Sephora sample and fell in love, so I bought the big bottle. Well, the fragrance is good, but it sprays too much and I&#x27;m drenched in this perfume. Now I need to go buy one of those perfume bottle with a spray air bag thingy to control how much of it I want. Smelling like a French whore, just a whore, or like a dog trainer who doesn&#x27;t want to smell like dogs too much.</li>

    <li> The perfume arrived very very fast. Im happy with my purchase. Smell great as the one I have previously tested over at macys store.</li>
    <li> I THINK THAT THE PRODUCT IS OLD.  THE FRAGRANCE, WHAT LITTLE THERE IS, DOESN&#x27;T LINGER AT ALL.</li>

    <li> My wife was very pleased with the product she loves it! and gets lots of comments of the Versace fragrant all the time.&lt;br /&gt; She has used it for many years.</li>
    <li> I received a paper sample of this perfume and LOVED it, carried it around for 6 months, rubbed it on me until the scent would no longer transfer, and finally, I broke down and ordered it.  What a disappointment.  It smelled nothing like the sample I THOUGHT would be my new signature scent. :( However, I must say the company is VERY nice, and against their policy, after I submitted an A-Z complaint with Amazon...they accepted my return of it.  Not sure if it was a bad batch or what, but tried it on in a store since and NOT the same as the sample - YUCK!  Before buying ANY perfumes, try them on, and then buy from this company as they are really stand-up and deserve your business :)</li>
    <li> Seriously guys, this is the real deal. Trust me when I tell you. I have 2 old bottles @ home Bc it&#x27;s the perfume I usually use and I was skeptical about buying it but I compared EVERY little detail and the smell is real and lasts ALLL day and even DAYSS. Love !</li>
