      <li>But this is a nice product, anyway.</li>

      <li>I can not explain in words how good it felt to go to bed and fall right asleep.</li>

      <li>The greasy factor is worth it to keep my hands healthy though!</li>
      <li>This salve has helped a great deal (I also tried cortisone cream, but prefer a natural solution).  </li>
      <li>Then, with Groupon, I went for my first pedicure in years and the girl was impressed with how soft the bottoms of my feet were.  </li>
      <li>I loved it so much</li>
      <li>I originally ordered (a differnt version) of Neem Oil to cure dog mange many years ago and it worked for that as well.</li>
      <li>I recently ordered more of this great stuff.  </li>
      <li>This product has a pleasant scent and is good for itching bug bites or skin irritation but it does leave a little greasy feel.</li>
      <li>light smell</li>
      <li>Ladies it really puts a nice shine on your skin.  </li>
      <li>It is a good product and to date I have purchased 5 containers and will purchase and use more as long as it helps my skin!</li>
      <li>Particularly good at tackling the waistband and top of the socks itch, a single application does the trick.</li>
      <li>We bought this after trying many, many, many over-the-counter \\&quot;anti-itch\\&quot; creams to help with the constant itching.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know what they&#x27;d be like right now without it!    </li>
      <li>Buy the way you won&#x27;t gray so quickly if ya keep using this stuff.</li>
      <li>He only used it at night and within four days the white spots were gone and his skin looks great!  </li>
      <li>My step daughter brought home scabies from someone at her school and it quickly spread to everyone in our house.</li>
      <li>Good for the very dry skin.</li>
      <li>It is not messy like most over the counter anti-fungal drugs.  </li>
      <li>isn&#x27;t right.  </li>
      <li>Great cure for some common itches.</li>
      <li>Almond oil is first, then safflower oil, then beeswax, then Neem and Vitamin E oil...</li>
      <li>&quot; most of the red bumps and sores on our skin; everyone realized a noticeable reduction in their bumps after using this for 2 days.    </li>
      <li>and it is very soothing!</li>
      <li>Neem Oil is the key ingredient and even better than tea-tree oil.  </li>
      <li>smells and tastes bitter, but its effective</li>
      <li>This optical topical save has anti-bacterial and anti-viral properties that can be used safely as a tooth paste.</li>
      <li>I have very sensitive skin and an mild acne...and knew from reading about the neem plant what it can do for your skin.</li>
      <li>At any particular their are over 150 different bacteria on your bod and more in your mouth.  </li>
      <li>It is very solid at cooler temperatures, but warms very quickly to be easily spread on.  </li>
      <li>It really has helped my eczema.</li>
      <li>It worked immediately and, with only one application before bed, we&#x27;ve been sleeping soundly ever since.    </li>
      <li>so we can have several handy around the home, in diaper bags, purses and such.</li>
      <li>It smells pleasant enough, so it&#x27;s not overwhelming on her lips, right under her nose.  </li>
      <li>The frustration of waking up every 45 minutes, to find yourself scratching in your sleep, was taking a serious toll on our quality of life; I had not gotten a good night sleep for over 3 weeks until we got this product.</li>
      <li>If you have a sore that won&#x27;t heal or a skin condition, I highly recommend this salve.</li>
      <li>huge improvement just in the first few hours.  </li>
      <li>Also great for random mystery rashes and  eczema patches.  </li>
      <li>Unless you put your nose in it I did not find the smell in any way offensive (much better then the little old ladies at the gym).</li>
      <li>I highly recommend, it leaves skin soft and there&#x27;s no worries of putting a product on that</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m using this salve as much as possible to try to get my hands back to normal fairly quickly.  </li>
      <li>It is a very thick ointment with a rather light smell (which is great because neem is not a pleasant smell to me) but it is greasy like petroleum jelly.</li>
      <li>We have tried many other products, from regular lip balms to pure shea butter (which for other things I love) to other neem salves, but none of them a) work as well or b) have the trifecta above.  </li>
      <li>This is all natural and works.</li>
      <li>I believe ingredients are listed most to least.  </li>
      <li>Plus it is natural.</li>
      <li>After using a prescription to wipe out the mites, we were told the itching would persist for about 6 more weeks (as the antihistamines slowly leave the skin).</li>
      <li>However, it is hard to find an all natural product that contains neem in an easy to use product that you can travel with in America.  </li>
      <li>The product itself is 5 stars for us; I gave it 4 stars because it&#x27;s not stocked in our local Whole Foods or smaller natural food store, Cornucopia.  </li>
      <li>I first started using this on the rough bottoms of my feet.  </li>
      <li>When it&#x27;s very chapped, the dry skin is instantly soothed and starts to heal --</li>
      <li>My son is super sensitive to even the most natural of things and this, plus the Shea Moisture Head to Toe baby ointment, and the California Baby Diaper Rash Cream are the ONLY things that do not make him break out horribly and get the job done.  </li>

<li> My latest need for the salve was a crazy rushed move that all but wrecked my hands.  </li>
<li> I will probably buy it for a long time to come.  </li>

<li> A little goes a  long way.  </li>
<li> Although the product itself comes in four little tins it lasts a long time....</li>
<li> so I can keep 2 for ourselves, and take the other 2 tins to those stores to see if they will carry it,</li>
<li> The salve is the consistency of petroleum jelly, so it stays put and does not run down your leg.  </li>
<li> - The picture of the product is deceptively misleading; these canisters are very small (slightly larger than a silver dollar).</li>
<li> -The Neem in the product will cause the contents to be semi-solid at temperatures slightly cooler than room-temp.</li>
<li> You must be a little patience with problems like with psoriasis &amp; Eczema however with fleas, scabies, mosquitoes results are immediate.  </li>
<li> So, it is a little pricey for 1 oz....</li>
<li> this has almost completely dried it up along with the drops you put in liquid and drink.</li>
<li> MY husband had singles for 5 months and this was suggested to us to help with getting this dried up.</li>
<li> But it tastes bitter, so she is reminded not to make the problem worse (odd that that&#x27;s a plus, but it is!).  </li>
<li> If you leave the canister in your pocket for a small amount of time, your body heat will make it an easier-to-use consistency.</li>
<li> Your kids have ringworm, their behind itch and other places</li>
<li> I also use it on my eye lids for a contact dermititus, that causes my eyes to swell and get very raw, no problems since I started using it.</li>
<li> It was sticky and irritated my hand and made eczema worse had to throw it away</li>
<li> will just make you worse!</li>
<li> doesn&#x27;t hurt, repels behavior that would make it worse, and nothing smells bad.  </li>
<li> My daughter gets very badly chapped lips, from stress and winter cold.  </li>
<li> (Believe me, they were horribly callused for years when I started with this salve.)    </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin and an mild acne...and knew from reading about the neem plant what it can do for your skin. However, it is hard to find an all natural product that contains neem in an easy to use product that you can travel with in America.  I hope that the product or the seller never goes away...I will probably buy it for a long time to come.  Although the product itself comes in four little tins it lasts a long time....LUV IT!</li>
    <li> smells and tastes bitter, but its effective</li>
    <li> Excellent stuff! light smell and it is very soothing!</li>
    <li> I had been using a product for 20 years to keep the eczema and my hands in check. Maybe the formula changed or maybe it was my skin but it quit working. I have tried about a dozen &amp;#34;new&amp;#34; products with no luck. This salve seems to be helping more than any product I have tried to date. It is a very thick ointment with a rather light smell (which is great because neem is not a pleasant smell to me) but it is greasy like petroleum jelly. I wear white cotton archival gloves on my hands once the salve is applied to reduce transferring the salve on everything I come in contact with. I also apply it before bed and sleep with the gloves on. It really has helped my eczema. I only gave it four stars because of the greasy factor. The greasy factor is worth it to keep my hands healthy though! It is a good product and to date I have purchased 5 containers and will purchase and use more as long as it helps my skin!</li>
    <li> My daughter gets very badly chapped lips, from stress and winter cold.  She sucks on her lip and the constant moisture sets up a big red rash that can get pretty dry and chapped and red -- almost clown-lip-looking.  This salve is the ONLY PRODUCT that works for her, so here I am online, buying it again!  We&#x27;ve gone through 3 tins in 3 years.  IT IS FANTASTIC!  It smells pleasant enough, so it&#x27;s not overwhelming on her lips, right under her nose.  But it tastes bitter, so she is reminded not to make the problem worse (odd that that&#x27;s a plus, but it is!).  It is ONLY soothing, never stingy.  I think the neem kills any bacteria/fungus that would otherwise have a foothold in through the cracks.  So for a kid with chapped lips, it&#x27;s a trifecta:  doesn&#x27;t hurt, repels behavior that would make it worse, and nothing smells bad.  It also has a very pleasant texture -- sort of a soft clingy warm buttery texture that doesn&#x27;t slide off or be waxy to put on.  It is very solid at cooler temperatures, but warms very quickly to be easily spread on.  We have tried many other products, from regular lip balms to pure shea butter (which for other things I love) to other neem salves, but none of them a) work as well or b) have the trifecta above.  They sting or the texture or smell isn&#x27;t right.  With this Neemaura salve, the moment her lips chap, she quietly goes to the cupboard and starts slathering it on -- problem stopped.  The red is either kept to a minimum or goes away.  When it&#x27;s very chapped, the dry skin is instantly soothed and starts to heal -- huge improvement just in the first few hours.  The product itself is 5 stars for us; I gave it 4 stars because it&#x27;s not stocked in our local Whole Foods or smaller natural food store, Cornucopia.  I wish that I could buy it locally more easily.  I&#x27;m ordering this 4-pack so I can keep 2 for ourselves, and take the other 2 tins to those stores to see if they will carry it, so I don&#x27;t have to order it online anymore!  (No offense, Amazon,thank you for stocking it!)</li>
    <li> My step daughter brought home scabies from someone at her school and it quickly spread to everyone in our house. After using a prescription to wipe out the mites, we were told the itching would persist for about 6 more weeks (as the antihistamines slowly leave the skin). We bought this after trying many, many, many over-the-counter \\&quot;anti-itch\\&quot; creams to help with the constant itching. This skin salve was the ONLY product that worked. I can not explain in words how good it felt to go to bed and fall right asleep. The frustration of waking up every 45 minutes, to find yourself scratching in your sleep, was taking a serious toll on our quality of life; I had not gotten a good night sleep for over 3 weeks until we got this product. It worked immediately and, with only one application before bed, we&#x27;ve been sleeping soundly ever since.    Things to note:    - This has also \\&quot;healed\\&quot; most of the red bumps and sores on our skin; everyone realized a noticeable reduction in their bumps after using this for 2 days.    - The picture of the product is deceptively misleading; these canisters are very small (slightly larger than a silver dollar). So, it is a little pricey for 1 oz.... but it works well and you don&#x27;t need to use a lot for it to work. If you are treating a family that has some itching-ailment, I&#x27;d probably get a multi-pack.     -The Neem in the product will cause the contents to be semi-solid at temperatures slightly cooler than room-temp. If you leave the canister in your pocket for a small amount of time, your body heat will make it an easier-to-use consistency.</li>
    <li> Finally a salve that you can use for a  vag/yeast infection that doesn&#x27;t further irritate!  I highly recommend, it leaves skin soft and there&#x27;s no worries of putting a product on that will just make you worse! (petroleum, glycol,  etc.)  As mentioned you have to warm the tin up at first to soften the salve, but after that it&#x27;s good to go.</li>
    <li> I used this salve for yeast infections in the female area.  It is a great anti-fungal.  The salve is the consistency of petroleum jelly, so it stays put and does not run down your leg.  It is not messy like most over the counter anti-fungal drugs.  Plus it is natural.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for any number of ailments from bee stings to itching to skin infections and it either works instantly or within a day or two. I originally ordered (a differnt version) of Neem Oil to cure dog mange many years ago and it worked for that as well. It is a bit greasy but that&#x27;s a small price to pay for consistently instant relief, especially for itching and infections.</li>
    <li> This product has a pleasant scent and is good for itching bug bites or skin irritation but it does leave a little greasy feel.</li>
    <li> This stuff works for just about every irritation of the skin I&#x27;ve encountered in life.  Recently I Eben used it to sooth a case of shingles</li>
    <li> I first started using this on the rough bottoms of my feet.  Then, with Groupon, I went for my first pedicure in years and the girl was impressed with how soft the bottoms of my feet were.  (Believe me, they were horribly callused for years when I started with this salve.)    One toenail also has a pocket from an infection I got several years ago.  I started putting this salve all over the nail both morning &amp; night, and it started improving.  (I stopped this last month due to a short-term upheaval in my routine.  I need to start again.  From what I read, this has to be done consistently with an antibacterial every am &amp; pm for at least a year.)    My latest need for the salve was a crazy rushed move that all but wrecked my hands.  This salve has helped a great deal (I also tried cortisone cream, but prefer a natural solution).  I&#x27;m using this salve as much as possible to try to get my hands back to normal fairly quickly.  I don&#x27;t know what they&#x27;d be like right now without it!    This salve does not smell like Neem oil (which has a peanut/garlic smell).  I believe ingredients are listed most to least.  Almond oil is first, then safflower oil, then beeswax, then Neem and Vitamin E oil... I would prefer if there were more Neem.  But this is a nice product, anyway.</li>
    <li> At any particular their are over 150 different bacteria on your bod and more in your mouth.  As a biological photographer I had to photograph everything from bacterial, to fleas to things I should not mention.  This optical topical save has anti-bacterial and anti-viral properties that can be used safely as a tooth paste. What&#x27;s not to like?  You must be a little patience with problems like with psoriasis &amp; Eczema however with fleas, scabies, mosquitoes results are immediate.  Unless you put your nose in it I did not find the smell in any way offensive (much better then the little old ladies at the gym). Like Redmond Clay this is a must-have with you. Ladies it really puts a nice shine on your skin.  Your kids have ringworm, their behind itch and other places this is the product for you.  Neem Oil is the key ingredient and even better than tea-tree oil.  If you don&#x27;t like the smell add some orange oil or lavender to it. Try the shampoo as well it great for cleaning out the sebaceous glands of the hair and face. Buy the way you won&#x27;t gray so quickly if ya keep using this stuff.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t do a thing for me.</li>
    <li> Great ointment which is easy to apply to skin issues.</li>
    <li> Good for the very dry skin.</li>
    <li> Awesome, soothing, healing cream!&lt;br /&gt;I love it!</li>
    <li> MY husband had singles for 5 months and this was suggested to us to help with getting this dried up. He had been on perscription drugs that would get it some better but did not get rid of it. (It was on his face and head) this has almost completely dried it up along with the drops you put in liquid and drink. This is all natural and works. I also use it on my eye lids for a contact dermititus, that causes my eyes to swell and get very raw, no problems since I started using it. My daughter uses it for her skin condition also. This is a great product.</li>
    <li> Excellent product!  My husband had white patches on his face and nothing seemed to help.  I did some research and found that neem was very good for the skin.  I checked on Amazon and ended up ordering this.  He only used it at night and within four days the white spots were gone and his skin looks great!  Update:  I recently ordered more of this great stuff.  A little goes a  long way.  My husband no longer has the white patches on his face although he still uses it sometimes as a preventative measure.  If you have a sore that won&#x27;t heal or a skin condition, I highly recommend this salve.</li>
    <li> This is amazing for healing diaper rash within a couple of changes and for prevention too.  My son is super sensitive to even the most natural of things and this, plus the Shea Moisture Head to Toe baby ointment, and the California Baby Diaper Rash Cream are the ONLY things that do not make him break out horribly and get the job done.  Also great for random mystery rashes and  eczema patches.  I used it on a bee sting on my arm and it is the only thing that made the swelling go down instantly. I loved it so much I went ahead and bought the 4-pack so we can have several handy around the home, in diaper bags, purses and such.</li>
    <li> Great cure for some common itches. Particularly good at tackling the waistband and top of the socks itch, a single application does the trick. Very happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> this is great for all kinds of scrapes, sunburn, cuts...</li>
    <li> I bought this  product after using the neem face care thought it would work wonders on my hands too. It was sticky and irritated my hand and made eczema worse had to throw it away</li>
</ol>
