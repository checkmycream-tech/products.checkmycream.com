<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Love it! will order again. It stays on all day and is very easy to apply.</li>
    <li> Great sturdy yet flexible brush. I always use this eyeliner. Its thick enough to make a smooth mark the first time around, but not too thick that it looks clumpy. I highly recommend!</li>
    <li> The color is not dark at all. It&#x27;s transparent like water color and takes a while to dry. I bought this at Target today...not worth the trip</li>
    <li> I loved it and had no problems. It does require some skill as does with liquid eyeliners, but it wasn&#x27;t flaky with me. It&#x27;s likely a few of you may have gotten a bad batch. It all depends on the manufacturer because the product bought in stores is of excellent quality and applies on darkly.</li>
    <li> can&#x27;t beat the price and love that elf is vegan.</li>
    <li> Eyeliner is watered down; it&#x27;s runny and it almost looks like you&#x27;re applying dark water on your eyelid. The brush is great but the consistency of the product is very poor.</li>
    <li> I really like elf products because of their affordability and (usual) quality. I had high expectations for this eyeliner but when I opened it and used it, it was terrible. It was really runny, the brush was prone to gliding all over the place, took a long time to dry, and also stung terribly if it got in my eye! Really disappointed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It would stay for a bit, but would fade in its sharpness within a couple hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I keep it around for a backup eyeliner (my first choice is WnW). It was only a dollar, what do I expect?</li>
    <li> This eyeliner has a wonderful very skinny brush tip that makes precision application of the eyeliner liquid extremely easy.  Once it dries, it stays put very nicely.  The best part of all (to me) is this eyeliner is cruelty-free, meaning it was not tested by torturing defenseless warm-blooded animals.  This is the eyeliner I will be buying from now on!!!</li>
    <li> I have tried many cheap black liners. In my previous forays into liquid liners, I was always baffled by the way the liner was not pigmented enough to deposit it all in one swipe--the color would sort of get pushed to the sides of my stroke. That does&#x27;t happen with this eyeliner (although it does happen with the brown e.l.f. liner). I will happily repurchase this when I run out. My main complaint is that the long handle/lid is not very sturdy and cracks easily--on both my brown and black liners, the lid eventually fell apart into pieces entirely. There&#x27;s another smaller lid inside the bigger one, though--it keeps the liner inside and keeps it from drying out, but it&#x27;s admittedly not a very good handle. This is not a problem if you use your own brush. I would give this 4 or 5 stars if it weren&#x27;t for the bad packaging.</li>
    <li> Too thin &amp; liquidy....takes a long time to dry on lids &amp; this leaves time for it to smear .</li>
    <li> Came in 2 days.  For the price, fantastic liquid eyeliner.  Thin brush applicator, super easy to hold and line straight.  Stayed on and put all day until I took it off, and it comes off easy, no scrubbing.  Have even slept in it, and the next morning was smudge free.</li>
    <li> Product and shipping as stated. Very easy interaction</li>
    <li> It came with no tip. How is one supposed to apply the eyeliner if there is no tip? Would not recommend to anyone. Please buy it at a physical store.</li>
    <li> OMG!!! I picked this up as an impulse buy while waiting at the register; GLAD I DID!! Only paid $3 for it &amp; it&#x27;s the BEST liquid eyeliner I&#x27;ve ever used! Nice &amp; bold in pigment, stays on &amp; is smudge free; it goes on seamlessly; even a first time user for liquid eyeliner could use it with ease!!</li>
    <li> The applicator is made of synthetic hair and does not go on easily. Also, it wears off in patches and is not thick enough to maintain it&#x27;s appearance. Will not buy again.</li>
    <li> Loved it. Will definitely buy again. Stays on for hours, even on hot summer days....</li>
    <li> This product is ok. When I first got it, it was difficult to maneuver the brush on my eyes because it&#x27;s too long. I got used to it but was not able to put it on my eyes they way I wanted to all the time. When I do get it right it does come out beautiful. I am just using for now until it runs out but I don&#x27;t think I will buy it again.</li>
    <li> Well it&#x27;s liquid eyeliner so....</li>
    <li> This product is no harder to apply than any other liquid eyeliner but it is significantly cheaper.  It may not last as long but for my purposes its great.</li>
    <li> This is the best eyeliner I have used so far for a cat eye. Although it fades a bit and isn&#x27;t as opaque as I like, for the price its wonderful. The tip is perfect for a smooth, thin line and I have been consistently buying this product since I first found it. A great, cheap option!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used liquid eyeliners for years and could never seem to find one that would stay on all day long. This product does just that and the price you can&#x27;t beat. I bought for to start and I&#x27;m definitely going to stock up on more</li>
    <li> very fine just the way I like it</li>
    <li> I love e.l.f. products but not this, took forever just to have dark lines, took 5 minutes an eye, very thin and watery.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using elf liquid eyeliner for about a year now. It&#x27;s my favorite because it&#x27;s cheap, easy to apply, and doesn&#x27;t seem to smudge. Very great product, especially considering the price.</li>
    <li> For the price I am very impressed.  This eyeliner is very dark, goes on smoothly, and doesn&#x27;t crease.  I really like the brush because it&#x27;s very thin.</li>
    <li> I found this for $1. U need stick eyeliner not this it stinks because it smudges and is runny. Not good</li>
    <li> This product makes me feel like i can&#x27;t use liquid eyeliner.  Ended up getting it in my eye and it gave me a cool grey eye for a few minutes...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think it is operator error most likely.  I do like it for doing a flick, nice tiny little paint brush tip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Probably won&#x27;t buy another, but I&#x27;ll probably never finish this bottle.</li>
    <li> WILL ORDER THIS AGAIN</li>
    <li> Perfect price, perfect product. Creates a sharp line, lasts ALL DAY, NO FLAKING! Amazing stuff that&#x27;s perfect for my rather dramatic cat-eye. It does take a few moments to dry...I bet I look pretty ridiculous standing there with my eyes closed to slits trying to blow on my eyelids. But hey, that&#x27;s par for the course with liquid liner.</li>
    <li> Best liquid liner I&#x27;ve purchased! Especially for the price. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I love it. It works great I am glad I Bought it..Much appreciated thank you very much can&#x27;t wait to buy more</li>
    <li> I like this just needed to get used to it its extremely watery you need to wipe the tip of the brush off and than its fine.</li>
    <li> This is the best VEGAN eye liner I have found! The color lasts and is pretty solid (like, not watery). Impressed.</li>
    <li> Smudges easily and takes a while to dry. Also if my eyelid gets any moisture on it at all the eyeliner will come off onto my eyelid which is a bit annoying. I find myself having to wipe away black marks on my eyelid occasionally throughout the day. Other then that it&#x27;s not a bad eyeliner.</li>
    <li> I just got this in Black, Midnight and Copper (I&#x27;ve purchased the silver one before). I am so impressed with the black and he Midnight ones which I wear most. The brush makes it so easy to draw the thinnest line or to thicken it up to your licking. It is also opaque in one passing and I have absolutely no problems with smudging or transfer. I have to say that now I actually prefer in to the cream version: it is cheaper, easier to use and it doesn&#x27;t budge even if it doesn&#x27;t claim to be waterproof. i am in love and I&#x27;d recommend this to anyone looking for an eyeliner!</li>
    <li> I bought e.l.f. eyeliner from ROSS (of all places) for $2 as part of a makeup kit and love it!  I was always a pencil liner person but when I tried this, I fell in love with the clean, precision lines it makes.  The line is full of uninterrupted color, there are no skips, breaks, or pulling, and it glides on beautifully especially if your eyelid skin is loose due to puffiness or aging.  Once fully dry, it doesn&#x27;t smudge.  It stays on all day (important if you have oily eyelids) and I don&#x27;t need to rub my delicate eye area at the end of the day when taking it off.  It comes off easily in the shower without a trace of makeup left behind!  You can&#x27;t beat the price.  I just hope I can continue to find it in stores.</li>
    <li> This one works for me! I typically have to do short quick strokes across the eyelid (I&#x27;m not a pro- no one swipe for me). It doesn&#x27;t clump for me, but it does not last very long either. It dried out about 3 weeks after purchase and I do not use it everyday.</li>
    <li> The brush is almost to soft to apply, the color is lighter than expected and i need to put on two coats on to get black. Rubs off easily.</li>
    <li> I have bought this product from Target before and loved it! However, I just got the same product from Amazon, and it was in terrible condition. The liquid inside the bottle was clumpy, and the brush was bent and mutilated. I was unable to apply the product with a clean line. I tried to swap brushes with my old set from Target, however, the tops were not able to screw into the opposite sets (top &#x3D; target, bottom &#x3D; amazon). I ended up throwing this away since Amazon won&#x27;t refund me my money. I will NEVER be buying another e.l.f. product from Amazon, and that&#x27;s saying a lot because I buy EVERYTHING on Amazon.</li>
    <li> I purchased this eyeliner in a pinch, and i&#x27;m impressed. The brush is a little long, so it took a little practice, but Im a seasoned liner girl, so I got the hang of it. If you shake the bottle before you apply it goes on beautifully, it seems to separate a little if it sits. It takes a few seconds to dry, but compared to other liners ive used it is not unreasonable. My liner, wings and all, stay put on my oily skin all day. Its a good product for the tiny price!</li>
    <li> pretty good liner. Heard its cheaper at target. My only problem is that it does run and the application brush should be a little more sturdy.</li>
    <li> I am rewriting my review. When I first got it i really didn&#x27;t like it much but I realized it takes a few times to get used to applying the eyeliner with this applicator. The color pigmentation isn&#x27;t amazing, but it&#x27;s not horrible. The super thin tip makes applying liner to the inner corner of the eye much easier. I have to run it over a few times to get the look I want, which isn&#x27;t ideal, but overall the price was very cheap. I realized that if you buy it in stores, it&#x27;s only $1!!!!! for that reason i changed my review to five stars.</li>
    <li> It may be one of the cheapest liquid eye liners but it&#x27;s great quality. It has a jet black color and a very thin tip. Especially great for anyone who&#x27;s trying to learn how to do winged eyeliner.</li>
    <li> Better than designer brands...read the ingredients!</li>
    <li> Perfect daughter loves this! Thank you so much.</li>
    <li> Just saying that I was about to buy this then I saw it in, like, 3 other stores for a dollar. It&#x27;s good eyeliner, but make sure it&#x27;s worth the extra 4 bucks before you get it online.</li>
    <li> TO &amp;#34;e.l.f&amp;#34;-do the world a favor,AND STOP MAKING POOR,LOW QUALITY,HORRIBLE PRODUCT!!.</li>
    <li> I LOVE IT!!!  It&#x27;s exactly what I was looking for!  It;s a tiny brush instead of the felt.  I don&#x27;t like the felt tip personally.  The brush is thin and precise.  And you can&#x27;t beat the price!</li>
    <li> Let me start off by saying that I absolutely love this eyeliner. I think that for the price, this product is very good. That being said, I was very excited to order this off of amazon because I couldn&#x27;t find it in stores. Nearly two months have passed and I STILL HAVENT GOTTEN MY PACKAGE. It states on my order that it is due to be delivered \\&quot;July 20th\\&quot; and currently it is September 11th. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT FROM THIS SELLER - you may never get your package &amp; you will have wasted your money.</li>
    <li> This didn&#x27;t go on smooth for me and melted in the Texas heat. It won&#x27;t work for me at all. I&#x27;m sad becaus I had such high hopes for it.</li>
    <li> Stays put and nicely pigmented for the price</li>
    <li> I was very hesitant to try out this liquid eyeliner, because of the price. BUT... I have a lot of liquid eyeliners, and this one is my favorite. It is so dark that it does not need multiple coats to get it a very rich black color. This liquid eyeliner has a little brush on it, but it is very flimsy if you press to hard it will get everywhere. It looks like a fine paint brush. I just use an angled brush instead of the one that it provides. Also, be careful with getting too close to the inner side of your eyelid because if you put too much it will get in your eye and you may have black tears for a couple minutes. (It does not hurt and it is not bad for you). All in All... good eyeliner, and I will stick to this one because some eyeliners you need to put multiple coats on or use multiple eyeliners with (stick and gel) but when I use this one, I only need one.</li>
    <li> This is the only liquid liner I use to create the cat eye look. Love it. Works great and its cheap!</li>
    <li> Useable but not good. The brush goes on very sloppy therefore I have to use a different brush to use this eyeliner.</li>
    <li> I did not buy mine from Amazon, however, this product is watery and runs into your eyes. It flakes off after a few hours and it make my eyelids get a rash. Not very well made. Would not recommend.</li>
    <li> i like the brush but the actually line is terrible it takes a long time to dry! i dont like it</li>
    <li> So when I first got it I was like wow this is pretty good for one dollar but then a few days later I was like this is terrible I don&#x27;t care how cheap it is I never want to buy it again it&#x27;s really watery it creases does not last all day and it gets very clunky if you are a beginner I guess this is ok for you but I suggest getting something else</li>
    <li> This is a great liquid liner, especially for beginners who don&#x27;t want to spend much on a new method of eyeliner application. Once the product dries on your lid, it doesn&#x27;t budge, which was a problem I had with few other liners. Considering that this is only a dollar, the liner lasts me a handful of months, which is also a plus. The only issue I have with this, is that the color starts to become less concentrated once you&#x27;ve been using it for too long, so it come off as dark grey instead of black.</li>
    <li> The best liquid eyeliner out there. I&#x27;ve tried high end brands and cheap ones and this is my absolute favorite. It lasts forever and is easy to apply.</li>
    <li> This eyeliner is on the smaller side, but it works wonders! The first time I used it I got the most perfect results.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t really like it cause it does not cover consistently. I will try and explain what I mean, when I apply it there are like these little gaps that appear, like it doesn&#x27;t give an even coverage. but elf isn&#x27;t expensive so I would recommend giving it a try cause you might like it. I am just giving my personal experience with it.</li>
    <li> I got the brown and plum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all, I&#x27;d like to say that they were very dark, more like black-brown and black-plum.  This isn&#x27;t exactly either a pro or a con; it depends on what you want.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: love the applicator brush.  I found this went on very smoothly and evenly, and was extremely easy to apply.&lt;br /&gt;Cons: If you don&#x27;t use primer (the e.l.f. primer works just fine), it flakes off practically while you&#x27;re putting it on.  If you do use primer, it lasts for a couple of hours.  Very fine lines last pretty well, but any sort of cat eye will flake away.  Even when not flaking, I had a little fallout.&lt;br /&gt;Overall: it&#x27;s cheap.  What do you expect?  For the price, I&#x27;d give it three stars.  I&#x27;ll probably use it again, as long as I&#x27;m in a situation to check it often.  If I decide not to, I might take the applicator brush for a cream liner.  I really do like it.</li>
    <li> This is my all time favorite liquid eyeliner! Although, I have noticed that without eyeshadow... you have to apply a couple coats to get a good line on your lid. But other than that, the brush and the eyeliner last really long and I wear eyeliner everyday. I&#x27;d say it lasts me about 3 months.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok. I had to put a couple of layers on for it to be really dark. I am defiantly looking to buy a different brand</li>
    <li> Very runny and smudgy. Does not last long. I normally don&#x27;t write reviews, but this was just terribly disappointing I&#x27;m new to putting on makeup, but it shouldn&#x27;t be wiped away with just tissue paper in a single swipe. I don&#x27;t recommend at all.</li>
    <li> Do not buy this. Its not good liner.&lt;br /&gt;Taking time to dry.spreads easily.&lt;br /&gt;I have wasted my money</li>
    <li> For a cheaper brand this is great. It goes on smoothly and the color is very solid. The applicator isn&#x27;t very flexible, but it does bend back a forth. It doesn&#x27;t smudge and it stays on all day. The bottle is good quality and easy to hold. I would definitely recommend this.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like it, So i put it on in the morning and by 11 12 ish its hard and it [eels right off. The only nice part is it goes on really well.</li>
    <li> Not the best at putting on liquid eye liner but loved this!</li>
    <li> The thin tip is great! It&#x27;s easy to use and my line looks straight and clean. You can&#x27;t go wrong.</li>
    <li> This product its great!</li>
    <li> Perfect for small fine lines. I apply this to my upper eyelid to add a little definition to my beautiful blue eyes. I get compliments all the time on them:)</li>
    <li> It was way too runny and not thick enough</li>
    <li> I have the brown color of this liquid eyeliner and I can&#x27;t even notice a difference that it was brown. Looks black when applied. Also it seems a little watered down so when you apply it you have to put 2 coats because it leaves streaks where it missed the first time. You can get a better liquid eyeliner so don&#x27;t waste your money on this one even though it&#x27;s cheap.</li>
    <li> I purchased e.l.f. 420 Black Liquid Eyeliner at a local market. It did not apply consistently and, being a painter, I was disappointed to find the thin burst and liquid liner very difficult to work with. I was displeased with the result and promptly washed it off with eye makeup remover (Clinique, have used man many times before), which is when I discovered that it burns: eyes, face, ouch. Not good.</li>
    <li> Great applicator and goes on really easy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only thing I dont like is that it isn&#x27;t waterproof and therefore seems to seep into my eyes by the end of the day.</li>
    <li> I am always sketchy about trying cheap beauty products in fear of being disappointed. Unlike most super cheap beauty products (its $1) I love this liquid eyeliner. The brush is so accurate and not messy, the formula stays on and lasts all day PLUS it is easy to remove using makeup remover at the end of the day. I love using this for going out or just spicing up my day time look. Would recommend this eyeliner to anyone, my favorite colors is black. This eyeliner is always in my makeup kit. The bottle has been tossed around when traveling and the container has never leaked or left a mess. Overall great product!</li>
    <li> I love how thin the brush is!</li>
    <li> Smooth and cleam lines...love it.</li>
    <li> I love this elf product . Its cheap but its a little runny. This is also only $1 at any department store.</li>
    <li> will continue to order this product its a great liquid eye liner Ive had not problems with it at all</li>
    <li> Oh it&#x27;s black alright. Except the pigment isn&#x27;t carried in the liquid well, so when you brush it on and spread it, it gets back onto the brush instead of staying on skin.</li>
    <li> Good quality and received on time.  Thanks</li>
    <li> Works like it is supposed too</li>
    <li> Good sturdy brush. I have to apply 2-3 layers for it to become jet black with good coverage. I don&#x27;t know why Amazon sells it for over $4 if Walmart &amp; target sells it for $2</li>
    <li> Seems to stay moist for quite a long time, which causes it to leave black lines on the lid if you blink</li>
    <li> I love this eyeliner!! I bought it at Target about three months ago, and this is my ONLY eyeliner :D&lt;br /&gt;I bought it in store for only $1! Really recommend buying it. Works great and lasts long.</li>
    <li> Goes on nice, lasts all day, comes off easy at night with water and looks great!</li>
    <li> YOU LOOKING FOR SOMETHING TO MAKE YO EYES POP.&lt;br /&gt;found it.&lt;br /&gt;Not 100% black, but if your learning take this.</li>
    <li> Excellent product! Speedy shipping.  Amazing for the price. Will purchase more in the future. The liner glides on smooth and does perfect lines.</li>
    <li> Runs in to my eyes but overall a good product ..perfect for a bold wing or a subtle cat eye.you can create the thinnist lines tho ^&amp;#60;^</li>
    <li> Item arrived fast and was what I expected.</li>
    <li> This eyeliner is perfect. The product is good and the brush makes application easy.</li>
    <li> this eyeliner doesn&#x27;t stay all the way.. It was peeling off halfway through the day and when I got home from school, the wing I had created was gone.</li>
    <li> Hate this brush! It makes the thinnest line!</li>
    <li> My 14 year old daugher loves this eyeliner - she&#x27;s able to create the winged effect with ease</li>
    <li> This was my first ever liquid eyeliner and I loved it!! The brush was small enough for any first timers, like myself, to do the perfect upper eyelid line!</li>
    <li> It worked well on the first few uses, but then I noticed that it started thinning for some reason. Even when I paint another layer over the first one, it leaves watery traces. But it doesn&#x27;t smudge or anything, and can stay on all day (granted, I use primer). If you need something reasonable for everyday casual use, it&#x27;ll do.</li>
    <li> this is a very watery eyeliner, and it takes a while to get used to applying it without getting eyeliner all in your eye. when i get it to work, it looks very nice and has a dark black color. however, even when it does work sometimes the color is a very light gray because it gets too watery to apply properly. it takes far much more patience and time than any other eyeliner i&#x27;ve used and i won&#x27;t bother buying it again because it&#x27;s overall too much of a hassle</li>
    <li> Honestly, I hated it. Watery, runny, the brush clumps too easily. For this quality I could buy liquid eyeliner at the dollar store. It takes two or three coats to get a solid black, and ain&#x27;t nobody got time for that. It&#x27;s only good for fleshing out a better eyeliner.</li>
    <li> The pencil is good the the mascarra itself smotheres all over your face. NOT recommend it!!</li>
    <li> Harder to apply than eye pencil, but looks nice when you get it right. The tiny applicator allows for more precision with practice, and the color is cleaner and darker. I had to reapply during the day, but I frequently touch/wipe my eyes during the high pollen levels in the spring.</li>
    <li> This is pure crap.  Granted at first it seems GREAT. But very quickly the liquid begins to clump and  and no longer goes pm smooth.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s really not worth the money. Save it and go for a better brand.</li>
    <li> Perfection! I&#x27;m in love with this product.</li>
    <li> When I first got this, I was super excited to try it out, but when I did I was a little disappointed. It took a very long time to dry, and when it did, parts of it looked uneven, as if it was too watery to dry properly. The other parts looked fine. They were a bold black that looked very nice. This was also very easy to apply , but you may need to apply more than once. It&#x27;s great if you don&#x27;t want to spend a lot, but it may need more than one application.</li>
    <li> I received my order on time. I like how the liner goes on smoothly. I can put a little or add more for a darker look.</li>
    <li> its a good liquid liner but i would recommend to use a gel liner its a lot easier.</li>
    <li> Will continue to use my previos eyeliner.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used my mom&#x27;s and sister&#x27;s liquid eyeliner before so this was my first time actually getting liquid eyeliner and I like it a lot. Only problem is that it smudges really easy. I find that you also have to hold it at a certain angle to get it to be a straight thin line which kinda sucks</li>
    <li> Not bad a little light so I would have to pass over it again with a darker one or with it a couple times so it can look really Dark like for a cat eye</li>
