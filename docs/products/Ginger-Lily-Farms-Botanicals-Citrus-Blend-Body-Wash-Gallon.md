      <li>And makes you feel absolutely refreshed just by smelling it.</li>
      <li>I decided to start purchasing bulk soaps because of the intense plastic pollution issues we are confronted with.</li>
      <li>As someone who is allergic to sulfates, finding a sulfate free soap in stores is a big challenge.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;ve got to say I really like it so far ....</li>
      <li>I have very sensitive skin, I can&#x27;t us a lot of products, but I can use this.</li>
      <li>It burns my sensitive areas and now I know why.</li>
      <li>I assumed from the listing that it would be all natural, but it IS NOT all natural.</li>
      <li>The price is right, since a little goes a long way.</li>

    <li> I love the smell, it&#x27;s great and relaxing.  I will definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> I decided to start purchasing bulk soaps because of the intense plastic pollution issues we are confronted with. I am very happy with this product. It smells great, it lathers well, and leaves no residue on the my body after shower. Impressed.</li>
    <li> Great light scent. Love it</li>
    <li> As someone who is allergic to sulfates, finding a sulfate free soap in stores is a big challenge. This soap is great in so many aspects. I use it for body wash, hand wash at home and at work. It&#x27;s scent is bright and refreshing but not overwhelming. It makes my skin soft but clean. The price is right, since a little goes a long way. It also works in foaming dispenser even without the sulfate. I will give the shampoo and conditioner a go next, since the body wash has made me so happy. I love not having sores and broken skin anymore!</li>
    <li> Cheap, and well worth it if you&#x27;re trying to keep a family clean.</li>
    <li> Great smell, great moisturizer, no parabens.</li>
    <li> It burns my sensitive areas and now I know why. Check out the ingredients. I assumed from the listing that it would be all natural, but it IS NOT all natural. I also am itching all over from it and about to try to return it and get a refund. I&#x27;m disappointed because it does smell good. It leaves a bit of a slimy feeling on my skin as well.</li>
    <li> Great product  , I&#x27;ll continue to buy 👍lathers up really well and smells great .....</li>
    <li> I ordered this body wash because it seemed to be a good value. That&#x27;s what I got, an inexpensive product that looks and smells like an inexpensive product. It is reminiscent of the stuff that comes out of the gel dispensers in gym and athletic center showers around the country. If you have a shower in your office building, you may have smelled it there, too.&lt;br /&gt;The product does not lather well and, as others have observed, feels more slimy than foamy and does not leave a slimy feeling on the skin even after rinsing. The same is the case with the shampoo, by the way, that seems to have the same formulation.&lt;br /&gt;The Green Tea Lemongrass scent is not something I will wear proudly, but who knows, maybe I will get used to it.</li>
    <li> Great value, fast shipping &amp;amp; great smell</li>
    <li> Excellent.  This makes my skin feel so good.  It lathers well and only take a little to get the job done.</li>
    <li> im so aggravated I want to re-order this product and right now it says none in stock, I Will buy again and use nothing else but this if it would come back to stock to purchase. this product smells great and lathers well. My husband even likes it.</li>
    <li> Love this and a great price. I have very sensitive skin, I can&#x27;t us a lot of products, but I can use this.</li>
    <li> I usually don&#x27;t by body wash by the gallon but I tried this when I had company coming for a few weeks and I&#x27;ve got to say I really like it so far ....I actually just ordered my second gallon !</li>
    <li> love it. will buy again and again might even consider giving as a gift or might just want to keep it all to myself</li>
    <li> I love this body wash. Its smells great and lathers up nicely. i even used it to shave.</li>
    <li> It arrived promptly! It smells exquisitely divine. The two aromas, green tea and lemongrass, compliment each other well and do not cancel each other out. It is light to the touch and fresh on the senses. And makes you feel absolutely refreshed just by smelling it. And oh!! Once used your skin feels nourished, fresh and clean. As it has been caressed or pampered. Will definetely continue to buy this brand.</li>
    <li> ordered body wash got hair conditioner.</li>
    <li> Great understated scent, lathers well, and great buy!</li>
    <li> This body wash is great for my whole family because it doesn&#x27;t have a girly smell for my boys but it smells good enough for my girls.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great, but good thing it was in a plastic bag as the lid had loosened and leaked.  Suggest taping the lid.</li>
