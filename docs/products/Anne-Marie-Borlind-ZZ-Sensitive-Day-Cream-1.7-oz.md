<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I used to use a dept store moisturizer, but was feeling that it just sat on top of my skin and wasn&#x27;t really doing the job.  I had a facial at a spa and they used the Borlind skin care line on me.  It felt so wonderful that I decided to purchase it on line (I am not aware of any local stores that carry it).  That was 5 years ago and I still love it.  I have had facials since and had comments about what wonderful condition my skin is in.  I am 45, so that is very nice to hear.  This product really moisturized without leaving any greasy feeling.  I have had excema since I was a baby, so i have very sensitive skin, and this product does not cause any issues.  I definitely reccomend.</li>
    <li> This is a much loved product, one I&#x27;ve used for many years, probably more than 15. It never causes my sensitive skin to break out but it does deeply moisturize. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> After just a day of using this product my skin looked like it did years ago. Absorbent and light, this product is wonderful, worth every penny. I am very fair and am outdoors all the time,  I noticed the redness and irritation from the elements fade each day. I am now into my third week of use, and plan to continue this wonderful natural product. Give it a try.</li>
    <li> I love this skin cream, I am very sensitive to fragrance, and even Lancome is too strong.    It does the job, my  face is hydrated all day. I have used it for three years , and I will never stop, my wrinkles     are diminished. and skin looks better.    all of her products are good but this one is good and cost effective.</li>
    <li> I love how soothing this cream is. I wish there was a version with sunscreen in it that was Feingold approved.</li>
    <li> I always using this cream after a chemical peel and it works great. The cream is not oily  and it has a matt finished. I can apply make up afterward.</li>
    <li> great day cream.it is not greasy and absorbs fast. no toxic chemicals. love AnneMarie Borlind beauty products.</li>
    <li> Worth the money, and then some.  Works like much more expensive creams do, moisturizing without clogging pores.  And no nasty fragrances to irritate skin or sensitive noses. I&#x27;ve used this for 10 years, and every time I try something else, I wonder why I bothered.</li>
    <li> Best in sensitive, natural care. I have been using it for years.</li>
    <li> This product is one I&#x27;ve returned to using after 4 years. I&#x27;ve had atopic dermatitis for life and it became much worse after cancer treatment of chemo and radiation. Dry irritated skin with pigmentation has plagued me.&lt;br /&gt; After an extensive derm patch test Found me allergic to Fragrance and Propylene Glycol among other ingredients, I discarded or gave away most of my skin care products.&lt;br /&gt; ZZ Senstive Day Cream is made from natural, some organic ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;This creamy, luscious tube soothes and moisturizes better than most over  $40 versions. It&#x27;s made  in Europe from natural ingredients and extracts where they require a higher standard of purity in products. Any scent is naturally occurring. A little goes a long way and the packaging allows for maximum extraction of product.</li>
    <li> This is awesome, I&#x27;ve used it for a few years now.  Good pricing, better than any local prices that I could find.</li>
    <li> This is a great cream but it is very thick and  takes a long time to absorb into the skin.</li>
    <li> I love love love love love this cream. It is light and non greasy and I always look forward to it. This product is great for semi problematic skin/dry skin with break outs. For me this is the only cream that deals with both!</li>
    <li> This product is OK for me, but I don&#x27;t know it will fit someone else. But anyway you can try.</li>
    <li> Excellent product.  Natural ingredients, very good for my hypersensitive skin, clinical results.</li>
    <li> Just what my wife wanted+++++</li>
    <li> Probably the best cream for sensitive skin out there</li>
    <li> best preservative-free moisturizer in the market!</li>
    <li> Product is fine except one package was old and the cream smelled rancid. It says not to send it back so am I stuck?</li>
    <li> Lighter than the night moisturizer but still moisturizing. Unscented and creamy.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t like that it&#x27;s shiny, but skin absorbs it later on in the day but takes a while. Sometimes I apply some powder lightly to get rid of the shine or I blot my face with a tissue.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Quick service.</li>
    <li> people always comment on what nice skin I have, then the next thing is what are you using. I get that all of the time.  Use it with the sensitive night cream and sensitive day cream and watch your skin transform. What a Big Difference!! Huge!!!&lt;br /&gt;Smooth, glowing, healthy looking. Doesn&#x27;t get much better than that!</li>
