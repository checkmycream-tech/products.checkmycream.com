      <li>Great smell to the lotion.</li>
      <li>Body Fantasies Moisturizing lotion is great....</li>
      <li>I wanted a very strong scent of cotton candy and this smelled almost nothing like cotton candy!</li>
      <li>Nothing smelled good about it.</li>
      <li>Good</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t smell as good as the spray.</li>
      <li>thought this would be good</li>
      <li>I thought this lotion was going to smell good like the body spray...</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t see any dates on the bottle so good job there with this &amp;#</li>
      <li>Watery at first but after a while of having it I seriously love it its so strong and smeels great!!</li>
      <li>the product honestly smelled like plastic and rancid oranges, not like the light, vanilla scent that I love about cotton candy, I immediately went for the returns, but after almost a week, my issue is yet to be resolved</li>
      <li>I have the body fantasy cotten candy body spray and love it.  </li>
      <li>I love the smell/taste of cotton candy: gum, body spray, etc.</li>
      <li>I think that&#x27;s all that needs to be said :-)  </li>
      <li>I love the body spray</li>
      <li>Glad I did</li>
      <li>, I got the body wash as well and that one seems ok..</li>
      <li>but the spray is better..</li>
      <li>Am sure if it would have had an expiration date on it...</li>
      <li>but there are probably better lotions out there.</li>
      <li>I should have saved my money by reading the reviews, but I thought I was going to enjoy it because I LOVE the spray...</li>
      <li>Closest thing I can say it smells like is a really strong glue  </li>
      <li>Since I could rave endlessly about how wonderful they smell, I naturally assumed the lotion would smell just as good.</li>
      <li>; cheap item.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I ordered it, recieved it, tried it, paid for it, and tossed it straight into the garbage!!!  </li>
      <li>When I saw the moisturizer, I was so excited.</li>
      <li>This is my first review after using Amazon for many years.</li>
      <li>I received this lotion excited about the cotton candy scent.</li>
      <li>It definitely does not smell as good as the body spray.</li>
      <li>Smells just like cotton candy fresh off of the machine...</li>
      <li>it didn&#x27;t smell like cotton candy and the color wasn&#x27;t right.</li>
      <li>It came out thicker, but still not quite the right consistency.</li>
      <li>It had expired in 1998, and it certainly smelled like it!  </li>
      <li>Soaks easily into skin, leaves it soft and silky.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I love that the scent will last all day, and never ever be over powering.</li>
      <li>Smell it totally different --- smells more like a Chemical instead of Cotton Candy....</li>
      <li>/&gt;My 3 and 5 year old love to use it also, because it smells so yummy and doesn&#x27;t irritate their sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>Pure liquid, not a lotion.</li>
      <li>i shook it very well</li>
      <li>Word of advice to anyone who wants to buy this product</li>
      <li>I know Body Fantasies very well.</li>
      <li>I threw it straight into the trash, but am now thinking I&#x27;ll try to return it.</li>
      <li>Wow!!!</li>
      <li>and it got somewhat better its a white color lotion not pink as i expected but still fine.</li>
      <li>Nice for young ladies and little girls.</li>
      <li>Very sweet long lasting scent.</li>
      <li>Was refuned but product came in and it smelt very old.</li>
      <li>didnt have a big cotton candy smell and watery liquid came out at first</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very runny and feels similar to mucous or something of the like.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Smells old  like rust.</li>
      <li>Oh, and it makes your skin sooo soft.</li>
      <li>The lotion smell like play dough... old, and out of date.</li>
      <li>I wish I had read the reviews before purchasing, especially because I normally always do.</li>
      <li>Inhaling as deeply as you can, you almost can&#x27;t catch it because that &#x27;lotion&#x27; smell almost completely masks it.</li>
      <li>I opened it right away, pumped a few times and... liquid.</li>

<li> I opened it right away, pumped a few times and... liquid.</li>
<li> Smelled really old, like it had been on a shelf for a very long time!!!  </li>
<li> I don&#x27;t know if it has been sitting on a shelf too long or what, but it is going back.</li>
<li> body fantasies usually makes great smelling body sprays and lotions, however... this smells soooo bad.</li>
<li> Stuff been sittin&#x27; around too long.</li>
<li> I don&#x27;t know if this was a REALLY old bottle of lotion, or if it&#x27;s just poor quality in general, but there was no scent at all,  and it was runny and gross.</li>
<li> This lotion had NO original smell left!  </li>
<li> it would have been far past it!  </li>
<li> Very chemical-like smell with a faint undertone of something else that wasn&#x27;t cotton candy.</li>
<li> I slathered it all up and down my arms and couldn&#x27;t stand myself and ended up in the shower.</li>
<li> Just received this &amp; although it does have a slight cotton candy scent there is also an off scent that I can&#x27;t recognize.</li>
<li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
<li> It had a very odd smell.</li>
<li> I usually buy the body mist from Rite Aid.</li>
<li> I was really disappointed because my mom really wanted this for christmas.</li>
<li> Seemed filled with water and smells awful.</li>
<li> We gotta have at least one star rating.</li>
<li> It smells like...a generic drugstore lotion with a very faint hint of cotton candy.</li>
<li> If that were bad enough it smelled nothing of cotton candy.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m a little disappointed.</li>
<li> I cannot stress how faint that undertone is.</li>
<li> In fact this bottle smelled rather stale.</li>
<li> , SAVE YOUR MONEY, THIS PRODUCT IS NOT GOOD!!!!</li>
<li> Aside from the scent, the consistency is very unappealing.</li>
<li> but this was a disappointment.</li>
<li> STINKS.</li>
<li> What a terrible waste of money!</li>
<li> i&#x27;m not sure if it was defective, but it smelled horrible.</li>
<li> Too bad I didn&#x27;t read the reviews before I bought it.</li>
<li> Nothing but a bottle of crap.</li>
<li> Very disappointing!</li>
<li> Very unhappy!</li>
<li> I WAS WRONG!!!!!</li>
<li> It was awful!  </li>
<li> so awful.</li>
<li> It smells awful!</li>
<li> Horrible</li>
<li> It&#x27;s smells awful!  </li>
<li> Nasty stuff.</li>
<li> This lotion was terrible...</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> It doe not smell like cotton candy!!</li>
    <li> The biggest mistake i made here was not looking at the reviews before me. the product honestly smelled like plastic and rancid oranges, not like the light, vanilla scent that I love about cotton candy, I immediately went for the returns, but after almost a week, my issue is yet to be resolved</li>
    <li> I love that the scent will last all day, and never ever be over powering. Soaks easily into skin, leaves it soft and silky.&lt;br /&gt;My 3 and 5 year old love to use it also, because it smells so yummy and doesn&#x27;t irritate their sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if this was a REALLY old bottle of lotion, or if it&#x27;s just poor quality in general, but there was no scent at all,  and it was runny and gross. After it arrived and I opened the bottle and realized what I had, it was then that I looked up the reviews of this product and realized it wasn&#x27;t just me. That&#x27;s what I get for not researching beforehand. Nothing but a bottle of crap.</li>
    <li> Watery at first but after a while of having it I seriously love it its so strong and smeels great!!</li>
    <li> This lotion had NO original smell left!  It had expired in 1998, and it certainly smelled like it!  It was awful!  I ordered it, recieved it, tried it, paid for it, and tossed it straight into the garbage!!!  What a terrible waste of money!</li>
    <li> I thought this lotion was going to smell good like the body spray... I WAS WRONG!!!!! The lotion smell like play dough... old, and out of date. I should have saved my money by reading the reviews, but I thought I was going to enjoy it because I LOVE the spray... Word of advice to anyone who wants to buy this product, SAVE YOUR MONEY, THIS PRODUCT IS NOT GOOD!!!! I would rate it 0 stars, but they wouldn&#x27;t let me... PLEASE TAKE THIS OFF THE SHELF!!!!!</li>
    <li> Seemed filled with water and smells awful. I love the body spray but this was a disappointment. I threw it away.</li>
    <li> Just received this &amp; although it does have a slight cotton candy scent there is also an off scent that I can&#x27;t recognize. It definitely does not smell as good as the body spray. I&#x27;m a little disappointed.</li>
    <li> It does have a cotton candy scent to it but there was another lingering scent that i could not figure out wat it was.  It had an almost play-do/cotton candy smell to it. The play-do smell did go away after 10minutes but there are probably better lotions out there.</li>
    <li> I received this lotion excited about the cotton candy scent. I love the smell/taste of cotton candy: gum, body spray, etc. I opened it right away, pumped a few times and... liquid. Pure liquid, not a lotion. So thinking it may have settled I shook up the bottle and pumped again. It came out thicker, but still not quite the right consistency. I tried to rub it into my hands but it was too runny. Not only that, but it wreaked! Very chemical-like smell with a faint undertone of something else that wasn&#x27;t cotton candy. I threw it straight into the trash, but am now thinking I&#x27;ll try to return it. I do NOT recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> This is my first review after using Amazon for many years. I have been using the Cotton Candy spray since 2007. When I saw the moisturizer, I was so excited. It smells awful! I slathered it all up and down my arms and couldn&#x27;t stand myself and ended up in the shower. I don&#x27;t understand, since I also ordered the spray and it is wonderful. I don&#x27;t know if it has been sitting on a shelf too long or what, but it is going back.</li>
    <li> I think that&#x27;s all that needs to be said :-)  Not overpowering, but enough to let you know it&#x27;s there.  Oh, and it makes your skin sooo soft.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t smell as good as the spray. In fact this bottle smelled rather stale.</li>
    <li> I have the body fantasy cotten candy body spray and love it.  thought this would be good IT NOT ONLY DOESNT SMELL LIKE COTTEN CANDY, IT STINKS. Closest thing I can say it smells like is a really strong glue  I want my $ back but I dont wanna sc*w the seller.  they maybe didnt know</li>
    <li> i bought this for my mom for christmas and it doesn&#x27;t even smell like cotton candy! i&#x27;m not sure if it was defective, but it smelled horrible. I was really disappointed because my mom really wanted this for christmas. i would not recommend this product to anyone</li>
    <li> Was refuned but product came in and it smelt very old. Couldn&#x27;t use it at all</li>
    <li> This lotion was terrible...it didn&#x27;t smell like cotton candy and the color wasn&#x27;t right.</li>
    <li> i couldnt wait to recieve this product. body fantasies usually makes great smelling body sprays and lotions, however... this smells soooo bad. i threw it out!! i couldnt even give it away!</li>
    <li> Nasty stuff. Shew!!! Smells old  like rust. Nothing smelled good about it. We gotta have at least one star rating. Stuff been sittin&#x27; around too long. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> just smelled like lotion with no fragrance</li>
    <li> Bought this to replace a used bottle i had purchased at WalMart around Christmas time - they don&#x27;t carry it anymore...&lt;br /&gt;The Smell it totally different --- smells more like a Chemical instead of Cotton Candy....&lt;br /&gt;Will never order this off Amazon again..... I;ll just stock up at Christmas time..</li>
    <li> I give this lotion NO STARS!! It&#x27;s smells awful!  To review this, I was prompted to give it a star.</li>
    <li> didnt have a big cotton candy smell and watery liquid came out at first i shook it very well and it got somewhat better its a white color lotion not pink as i expected but still fine.</li>
    <li> Too bad I didn&#x27;t read the reviews before I bought it. I know Body Fantasies very well. I usually buy the body mist from Rite Aid. Soooooooooo I I got this and I was like &amp;#34;wth is that smell&amp;#34;. Horrible lol It smelled like it was expired. I don&#x27;t see any dates on the bottle so good job there with this &amp;#34;add-on&amp;#34; cheap item.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On another note, I got the body wash as well and that one seems ok.. it&#x27;s just this lotion tho... so awful.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried the body wash and the body spray. Since I could rave endlessly about how wonderful they smell, I naturally assumed the lotion would smell just as good. I couldn&#x27;t have been more wrong. It smells like...a generic drugstore lotion with a very faint hint of cotton candy. I cannot stress how faint that undertone is. Inhaling as deeply as you can, you almost can&#x27;t catch it because that &#x27;lotion&#x27; smell almost completely masks it. Aside from the scent, the consistency is very unappealing. It&#x27;s very runny and feels similar to mucous or something of the like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;0/5 stars, if it were possible.</li>
    <li> Very disappointing! I wanted a very strong scent of cotton candy and this smelled almost nothing like cotton candy! It was a very gross texture as well. If there was a no star option, I would have done that. Don&#x27;t buy this product!</li>
    <li> I wish I had read the reviews before purchasing, especially because I normally always do. I went to use this and the lotion was so runny, like the consistency of water. If that were bad enough it smelled nothing of cotton candy. It had a very odd smell.</li>
    <li> Very sweet long lasting scent. Smells just like cotton candy fresh off of the machine...Nice for young ladies and little girls.</li>
    <li> Good but the spray is better..and she loves it and it will make you wanna snuggle up and what not with your girl. or girls it will make your man come closer to you.</li>
    <li> Wow!!! Great smell to the lotion. Glad I did but it and would recommend anyone thinking about buying it. Lasting smell. Body Fantasies Moisturizing lotion is great....</li>
    <li> Did not smell anything like cotton candy...Smelled really old, like it had been on a shelf for a very long time!!!  Am sure if it would have had an expiration date on it...it would have been far past it!  Very unhappy!</li>
