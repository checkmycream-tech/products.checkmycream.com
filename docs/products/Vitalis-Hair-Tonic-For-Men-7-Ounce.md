      <li>Good grief!&lt;br</li>
      <li>That is a good thing, for me, considering I don&#x27;t like any product in my hair before I go to bed at night.</li>
      <li>There are so many good reasons to put nothing in your hair that a tonic had better be excellent to persuade me to use it.  </li>

      <li>He has worn this for years, and I love it!  </li>
      <li>How nice to find it again.</li>
      <li>love you amazon.you do good.</li>
      <li>He really liked that it came in a 7 oz.</li>
      <li>This has disappeared from most store shelves, as they try selling their own brands as a subsitute, they do not even come close.  </li>
      <li>This pleasant smelling tonic is well worth your money.  </li>
      <li>The cologne smell, as everyone seems to agree on, is more in the sense of baby vomit.</li>
      <li>Love this stuff...</li>
      <li>It arrived on time in appropriate packaging.  </li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>The cologne smell, as everyone seems to agree on, is more in the sense of baby vomit.</li>
      <li>This product has been my favorite for years.</li>
      <li>As a side note, I do like the CVS Hair Tonic probably a bit better than Vitalis.</li>
      <li>Pinaud&#x27;s feels almost like water, while the magic of V7 is unbeatable.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not in love with the scent(though</li>
      <li>you don&#x27;t want to put more in or it&#x27;ll look like you dipped your head into oil.&lt;br</li>
      <li>So glad I got this for the husband :)</li>
      <li>With that said, let&#x27;s look at the good qualities for a first time</li>
      <li>My hair is fine and straight and Vitalis works great for any style I want.</li>
      <li>Fortunately, they were ok.</li>
      <li>Easy to set my hairstyle.</li>
      <li>Vitalis goes in easily.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used this brand for years and it does fine for me.</li>
      <li>The product is fine but the package was not enclosed in a protective covering and leaked all over the rest of the products which were also in the box.  </li>
      <li>and it does a fine job</li>
      <li>This product is great for taming my dry frizzy fly-aways and keeps my hair looking healthy and shiny.</li>
      <li>Hasn&#x27;t been available in Australia since Adam was a boy.</li>
      <li>Sometimes new is good but in most cases I&#x27;ve learned that old school is sometimes better.</li>
      <li>The last good thing about this product is that it&#x27;s water-soluble.</li>
      <li>Yes, this is all weirdly true.  </li>
      <li>I have a full head of hair.</li>
      <li>I kind of like the scent to it and alcohol tingle and masculine feel to it.</li>
      <li>I have to stand at the mirror for a good 10-15 minutes constantly putting this stuff in my hair.  </li>
      <li>Vitalis leaves my hair darned near perfect every day I use it, and it has no annoying side effects like other products, which can leave hair unnaturally rigid ( hairspray or gel \\&quot;cement head\\&quot;) or greasy ( when I tried Wildroot).   </li>
      <li>I keep a bottle of this in my glovebox and another bottle in my backpack for quick fixes whenever the need arises.&lt;br</li>
      <li>/&gt;There are three things I don&#x27;t like about this product, they are: the amount needed for adequate use, the hold strength, and the smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It makes hair more manageable, provides a light hold and actually disguises some of the grey.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t think this hair product is really worth &#x27;the stretch.&#x27;</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t think this hair product is really worth &#x27;the stretch.&#x27;</li>
      <li>if you want a light hold classic groom with no downsides, give it a try.</li>
      <li>But in terms of scent, I think I like Pinaud&#x27;s Quinine scent a little better, but I like the consistency of Vitalis a bit more.</li>
      <li>I have been using Vitalis for many years and my hair is very manageable with natural shine without seein greasy</li>
      <li>Love the smell of this stuff and the classic quality it brings to an old school hair style.</li>
      <li>I recommend for a classic, sophisticated, yet natural look.</li>
      <li>It does smell like alcohol, but more in the sense of beer than actual rubbing alcohol or hand-sanitizer.</li>
      <li>It smells kinda funny, the number 1 ingredient is alcohol, and it made my head itch like hell.</li>
      <li>It washes out the next day :)</li>
      <li>It does smell like alcohol, but more in the sense of beer than actual rubbing alcohol or hand-sanitizer.</li>
      <li>They&#x27;ve all seem to say this stuff smells like rubbing alcohol at first, then cologne afterwards.</li>
      <li>Wish I had looked at the size of the bottle first tho</li>
      <li>I can see how the conservative-easy-soft-hair/causal male, pass the age of 35, will find this product enjoyable, but not me.  </li>
      <li>I can see how the conservative-easy-soft-hair/causal male, pass the age of 35, will find this product enjoyable, but not me.  </li>
      <li>it is the same as I always buy my favorite.</li>
      <li>It is exactly what he wanted.  </li>
      <li>This is a first impression review.</li>
      <li>on my  first order  some  six months ago.</li>
      <li>Vitalis has been around a long time and is probably, other than Brylcreem, the best known among the older baby boomers.</li>
      <li>fragrance not exactly the same as in days of Truman  or Eisenhower or Kennedy,  but still provides a nice refreshing splash on head</li>
      <li>I have a hard time finding this in stores where I live so it was nice to be able to order it online.</li>
      <li>The first time I put this stuff in, I wanted to just pour the whole bottle on my head because it was taking so</li>
      <li>I have relatively straight manageable hair that lays flat in most areas.</li>
      <li>For me, Vitalis is pretty much the holy grail of hair care.   </li>
      <li>That one has a nice lemon, citrus scent with just a tad less control without the tackiness you can get from Vitalis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>The smell is a bit strong but goes away after a short bit.</li>
      <li>I always ended up shaving my head after my hair reached a certain length because of the frustration of styling problems.</li>
      <li>Generally I combine the tonic with a pomade or gel for a clean well-kept look.</li>
      <li>Just pour a little in your hands and rub it in your hair and like magic you can comb it perfectly back into shape without adding any more \\&quot;greasyness\\&quot; to your hair.</li>
      <li>My whole life I&#x27;ve tried gels, waxes, sprays and everything else to make my hair look the way I want it.</li>
      <li>The alcohol smell really borders me and it turns my hair sticky.</li>
      <li>After Vitalis disappeared from drugstore shelves, I really missed it.</li>
      <li>but I think it really all depends on the person.  </li>
      <li>One advantage to smelling like your grandfather is that the fragrance emanating from your hair acts as a very efficient contraceptive device.</li>
      <li>At the end of each day, it washes out very easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>And I can see the difference with other top quality gels when I shampoo my hair.</li>
      <li>If, OTOH, you&#x27;re trying for a classic slicked back look, you may want a stronger classic groom like Brylcreem, Groom and Clean, or wildroot.     </li>
      <li>It will keep most of the frizz down, but not the stubborn flyways.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> One advantage to smelling like your grandfather is that the fragrance emanating from your hair acts as a very efficient contraceptive device.</li>
    <li> I have relatively straight manageable hair that lays flat in most areas. This product is great for taming my dry frizzy fly-aways and keeps my hair looking healthy and shiny. It is not heavy like a gel and does not dry to a crunch, which I hate. It coats the hair in a thin layer of oil that keeps the hair soft and allows for normal movement. This product will not shape the hair into other styles but will enhance those of us that have hair that naturally falls into place. It has a decent scent too.</li>
    <li> love you amazon.you do good.</li>
    <li> Brings back old memories.</li>
    <li> This stuff just isn&#x27;t for me.  It smells kinda funny, the number 1 ingredient is alcohol, and it made my head itch like hell.</li>
    <li> This is for the &amp;#34;Fonzies&amp;#34; of the world (no offense) who still keep a comb in their back pocket and say , &amp;#34;Aaaaaaaaaa&amp;#34; with the thumbs up.  I don&#x27;t know what I was looking for but I know its not this. While putting it in my hair, my hair became tacky, and eventually became sticky, like someone poured sugar water in my hair.  The next morning, I still had the &amp;#34;wet look&amp;#34;, still had the sticky hair. I tried to wash it out with shampoo, but I could still feel it. After two washings, I think I have it out of my hair.  I don&#x27;t need varnish to give me control of my grey hair.</li>
    <li> For me, Vitalis is pretty much the holy grail of hair care.   It makes my hair managable and shiny(though not to the point of a glossy finish like some products), and controls the frizz that my curly hair is prone to.  It and even seems to make the few grey hairs I have a bit less obvious.   I&#x27;ve tried gels, hairsprays, etc. and none worked as well, and the left my hair feeling nasty, to boot.   Vitalis leaves my hair darned near perfect every day I use it, and it has no annoying side effects like other products, which can leave hair unnaturally rigid ( hairspray or gel \\&quot;cement head\\&quot;) or greasy ( when I tried Wildroot).   An added plus for vitalis over other classic grooms is that it doesn&#x27;t seem to have issues in the heat.       I&#x27;m not in love with the scent(though it&#x27;s a *lot* less horrible than hairspray), but it is mild, fades quickly and doesn&#x27;t irritate me like a lot of scents do. If you have hair with a lot of \\&quot;life\\&quot; that lays well and want to try something that gives ti that little extra to keep it in line, then vitalis is amazing.  If, OTOH, you&#x27;re trying for a classic slicked back look, you may want a stronger classic groom like Brylcreem, Groom and Clean, or wildroot.     TLDR:  if you want a light hold classic groom with no downsides, give it a try.</li>
    <li> Just like the old stuff! I only got it to remind me of my grandfather and it certainly did the trick! Love this stuff... Smells and feels exactly the same</li>
    <li> I love it. Keeps my scalp from itching. I did forget how it kinda leaves itself behind on the pillow ... Ooops.</li>
    <li> Vitalis has been around a long time and is probably, other than Brylcreem, the best known among the older baby boomers. I&#x27;m one of that crowd but I gotta say I&#x27;ve tried a lot of different \\&quot;product\\&quot; over the years and you can&#x27;t improve on Vitalis.  Great scent and it works.</li>
    <li> Vitalis hair tonic damaged my hair. After using one week of this product my hair starts falling. I stopped using this product  but my hair won&#x27;t stop falling. still falling every day.</li>
    <li> My hair is very thick, coarse and dry.  Gels and other products just don&#x27;t work well at all, but a few splashes of Vitalis leaves my hair soft and manageable, without even creating a &#x27;wet look&#x27;.  It just makes my dry hair look normal.  It is very unfortunate that the company has apparently stopped making this product.  The Vitalis name is now attached to standard gel and shampoo, which does nothing for me.</li>
    <li> Just like it was fifty years ago !!</li>
    <li> The  product  is no problem . The way it was  shipped  was not as well done as  previously packed .  on my  first order  some  six months ago. onthis shipment  the vitalis  bottles  we  re not sealed in plastic  bags which  gave  them air  cushioning  protection  so  to  speak. Unfortunately two  bottles leaked  about 1/2 ounce  each. I  believe  packing  those bottles  in  cardboard  box  with out thje air  sealed plastic  bags was a mistake.</li>
    <li> I have been using Vitalis for many years and my hair is very manageable with natural shine without seein greasy</li>
    <li> I have used Vitalis for 60 years, I would not use anything else. It is getting harder to find though.</li>
    <li> BEWARE:  ALL CHEMICALS EXCEPT WATER</li>
    <li> This isn&#x27;t Vicki, it&#x27;s her son.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I sport a longer version of a classic side part, and normally I use Brylcreem to hold it and place and give my hair some shine. But if your hair gets messed up past the point of being able to comb it back into shape and retain the hold (which it often does at my work or in high Oklahoma winds) you don&#x27;t want to put more in or it&#x27;ll look like you dipped your head into oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is where Vitalis comes in. Just pour a little in your hands and rub it in your hair and like magic you can comb it perfectly back into shape without adding any more \\&quot;greasyness\\&quot; to your hair. I keep a bottle of this in my glovebox and another bottle in my backpack for quick fixes whenever the need arises.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only bad thing about it is Vitalis gives almost no hold if your hair is semi-long so it can&#x27;t be used alone, but with shorter hairstyles I&#x27;ve found it works great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And even if you don&#x27;t style your hair try rubbing some in, it makes your hair feel ultra-soft and it will tame any fly-aways you may have while giving you a very subdued shine.</li>
    <li> fragrance not exactly the same as in days of Truman  or Eisenhower or Kennedy,  but still provides a nice refreshing splash on head</li>
    <li> This purchase was for my Dad.  He has worn this for years, and I love it!  There is nothing like the scent of &amp;#34;fresh Vitalis!&amp;#34;  Memories!</li>
    <li> I was looking for this product for quite awhile.....it was/is just I remembered......really great.  Amazon has everything you ever need.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t notice any difference after using it. Smells good I guess.</li>
    <li> This hair tonic is probably one of the best in terms of managing your hair and control. It seems to soften your hair and giving it an almost &amp;#34;glossy&amp;#34; shine to it without making it heavy or greasy. I kind of like the scent to it and alcohol tingle and masculine feel to it. But in terms of scent, I think I like Pinaud&#x27;s Quinine scent a little better, but I like the consistency of Vitalis a bit more. Pinaud&#x27;s feels almost like water, while the magic of V7 is unbeatable. As a side note, I do like the CVS Hair Tonic probably a bit better than Vitalis. That one has a nice lemon, citrus scent with just a tad less control without the tackiness you can get from Vitalis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like alternating between Vitalis and Pinaud. They are both excellent hair tonics and a must for your grooming arsenal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some folks have asked, &amp;#34;What is V7?&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;The Answer: If you count the number of ingredients in Vitalis, guess what? They total seven, hence V7, V for Vitalis and 7 for the number of ingredients (both FDC colorings counting as one ingredient).</li>
    <li> The alcohol smell really borders me and it turns my hair sticky. And I can see the difference with other top quality gels when I shampoo my hair. I have to apply shampoo on my hair two times with this tonic, while other gels need once.</li>
    <li> This pleasant smelling tonic is well worth your money.  When I&#x27;m styling it without hair product; I splash it on my hair after a shower and let it dry to add shine and manageablility for a \\&quot;neat\\&quot; look.  Generally I combine the tonic with a pomade or gel for a clean well-kept look.</li>
    <li> This product has been my favorite for years.</li>
    <li> The product is fine but the package was not enclosed in a protective covering and leaked all over the rest of the products which were also in the box.  Fortunately, they were ok.</li>
    <li> My whole life I&#x27;ve tried gels, waxes, sprays and everything else to make my hair look the way I want it. Nothing ever made me happy until I used Vitalis. I have a full head of hair. My hair is fine and straight and Vitalis works great for any style I want. I always ended up shaving my head after my hair reached a certain length because of the frustration of styling problems. Not anymore. Vitalis is the best.</li>
    <li> I have recently started using Vitalis Hair Tonic For Men, 7 Ounce, because I&#x27;m tired of all the crappy gels on the store shelves today. I&#x27;ve used hair gels for several years, but then began to wonder how that stuff would work that my grandfather used to have in his medicine cabinet. Sometimes new is good but in most cases I&#x27;ve learned that old school is sometimes better. Vitalis goes in easily. Just massage it into damp hair and comb it into place. It makes hair more manageable, provides a light hold and actually disguises some of the grey.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not very effective for severe bed head if you don&#x27;t wash your hair before use. I can&#x27;t vouch for it&#x27;s holding power in light to gusting winds, but for normal weather, Vitalis provides enough hold for my thin flyaway hair and it&#x27;s not greasy or sticky and has very little smell. At the end of each day, it washes out very easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please rate this review if you found it helpful.</li>
    <li> I like to use it after I shampoo my hair.</li>
    <li> I luv, luv, luv the scent.</li>
    <li> haven&#x27;t had vitalis for quite a while...it&#x27;s how i remember it and it does a fine job</li>
    <li> Ordered this for my 86 year old uncle who couldn&#x27;t find it locally.  It is exactly what he wanted.  He really liked that it came in a 7 oz. bottle.  It arrived on time in appropriate packaging.  He said he&#x27;d have me order this again.</li>
    <li> Easy to set my hairstyle.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this brand for years and it does fine for me.</li>
    <li> After Vitalis disappeared from drugstore shelves, I really missed it. Then a friend told me I could get it at Amazon. So, I am back to having my fluffy-light hair under full control with no greasiness or any other sign that I have used anything on it. To borrow a phrase from another old-time hair tonic to describe how little you have to use, \\&quot;A little dab&#x27;ll doya\\&quot;.</li>
    <li> And it gives me the same sheen as other products without feeling gunky.  I recommend for a classic, sophisticated, yet natural look.</li>
    <li> As good as it was 40 years ago! How nice to find it again. Hasn&#x27;t been available in Australia since Adam was a boy.</li>
    <li> This has disappeared from most store shelves, as they try selling their own brands as a subsitute, they do not even come close.  Vitalisw manages my hair great.  It is greaseless, and once applied, your hair combs into your style with just a couple of strokes.  Great.</li>
    <li> pricey but, I love it!</li>
    <li> Price, and it is the same as I always buy my favorite. I have used  this product for years and it has been hard to find</li>
    <li> I have very little hair on top, but this keeps in under control.  It is still the same old &#x27;dry look&#x27; Vitalis and suits me just right.</li>
    <li> I have a hard time finding this in stores where I live so it was nice to be able to order it online. Wish I had looked at the size of the bottle first tho</li>
    <li> Helps us old men by making our hair appear darker.</li>
    <li> This is a first impression review. With that said, let&#x27;s look at the good qualities for a first time user.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Good...&lt;br /&gt;I like the shine; it has the level of shine as hair grease like \\&quot;Tres Flores,\\&quot; the bottled oily version, not the petrolatum container.  It keeps most of the flyways down, except the stubborn ones.  There seems to be a pattern that every hour or so the shine fades slightly and the little hold reduces it strength as well. That is a good thing, for me, considering I don&#x27;t like any product in my hair before I go to bed at night. It usually gets all over the sheets. If the product reduces itself throughout the day, I&#x27;m all for it. The last good thing about this product is that it&#x27;s water-soluble. Yay! It washes out the next day :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Bad...&lt;br /&gt;There are three things I don&#x27;t like about this product, they are: the amount needed for adequate use, the hold strength, and the smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The amount needed for adequate use is ridiculous. I have to stand at the mirror for a good 10-15 minutes constantly putting this stuff in my hair.  I have thick, wavy, natural-curly hair by the way, and it takes forever to get this product in fully.  The first time I put this stuff in, I wanted to just pour the whole bottle on my head because it was taking so long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The next thing I hate about this product is the hold strength. I didn&#x27;t expect any hold from a liquid product, but this is for those of you that want to know the hold strength. It has some hold. By some, I mean just a tiny bit. It&#x27;s kinda noticeable, but it doesn&#x27;t compare to other products like gel or pomade. It&#x27;s weak for the most part. It will keep most of the frizz down, but not the stubborn flyways. My stubborn flyways still stick out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The last thing I hate about this product is the smell. Oh man, here is where most people/users will hate me. I&#x27;ve read the other reviews including watching the ones on YouTube. They&#x27;ve all seem to say this stuff smells like rubbing alcohol at first, then cologne afterwards. It does smell like alcohol, but more in the sense of beer than actual rubbing alcohol or hand-sanitizer. The cologne smell, as everyone seems to agree on, is more in the sense of baby vomit. Yes folks, I&#x27;ve been around little infants to know what that smells like. It&#x27;s terrible! I can&#x27;t believe people find this smell attractive and appealing. I use CK One, CK Escape, CK Obsession, Adidas Moves, Axe, and DKNY Be Delicious for Men. It smells nothing like those colognes. Even my other hair products like \\&quot;Blue Magic\\&quot; and \\&quot;Royal Crown: Hair Dressing\\&quot; smell better than this crap. Good grief!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it&#x27;s somewhat decent. The price on this stuff is $5 at Wal-Mart. It&#x27;s $8 on up at Wal-Greens, ebay, and Amazon. I don&#x27;t think this hair product is really worth &#x27;the stretch.&#x27; I have used numerous hair products for men and I have to say this is one of the worst. I can see how the conservative-easy-soft-hair/causal male, pass the age of 35, will find this product enjoyable, but not me.  The bottom line, it&#x27;s just not for everyone, certainly not for those in a specific demographic.e rubbing alcohol at first, then cologne afterwards.

    <li> Love the smell of this stuff and the classic quality it brings to an old school hair style. It&#x27;s very masculine and much more smooth and slick than gel or hair spray, and offers that shiny almost wet look like Don Drapper! So glad I got this for the husband :)</li>
    <li> good product, one bottle leaked</li>
    <li> My experience with this product went like this. I ordered it and received it in a timely matter, a few days later.  When I went to use it there was a hole at the bottom of the plastic bottle, leaking when you applied it into your hands. I contacted amazon customer service thinking it would take me 30mins to get all this cleared up. I was not on the phone no more than 5mins. Told the rep what happened, they had me a new bottle sent the very next day. Great product with great customer service. Will purchase again.</li>
    <li> After shampooing, my hair often becomes puffy and frizzy. So for a long time I had to choose between having fro-like Asian hair that looks terrible, or dirty oily hair that looks ok but is filthy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This allows me to style my hair in a way that&#x27;s not obvious that I used a product. I like to wet my hair, apply a small squirt to my palm, rub my palms together, and then rub it into my hair into a style. The smell is a bit strong but goes away after a short bit.</li>
    <li> So, I happened to be reading a book by Stephen King and there was a sentence that mentioned the character having smelled Vitalis on the preacher&#x27;s hair which brought back a lot of memories for him.  Considering the fact that I am a admittedly impulsive and compulsive Amazon shopper, I plugged the word &#x27;Vitalis&#x27; into the search bar and put it in my basket.  Yes, this is all weirdly true.  Granted, I WAS looking for an inexpensive way to keep my hair tame without having to use a bunch of product to do so yet I never planned on finding out about it this way.  I am extremely happy with the way this works!  I would say the sheer fact that it has been around for forever and a day is a testament to the products worthiness in and of itself, and I can further add to the continued success by giving it the high praise it deserves.  Basically, you just apply some in the same way you would add aftershave to your hands, and then you just comb it through your hair with your fingers and there you have it.  It gives control without having any gel like stickiness and it has a pleasant smell to boot.  Only minor setback is that I feel some may find it to have a greasy-esque look to it but I think it really all depends on the person.  Recommended...</li>
    <li> It has the consistency of water.  I think for me, something with a little grease would help me for better control.</li>
    <li> There are so many good reasons to put nothing in your hair that a tonic had better be excellent to persuade me to use it.  For starters, whatever you put in your hair is going to get re-deposited into your upholstered furniture.  And we are talking about applying chemicals to your scalp because Vitalis is not \\&quot;organic\\&quot;.  I bought this because I saw that it is so highly rated at Amazon.  I dislike it.  Even the tiniest amount makes my hair feel heavy, oily, and dirty. Regular shampooing with a vinegar rinse is what keeps my hair manageable.</li>
