<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I am black with tightly curly hair. This stuff did nothing for my hair. I had to mix a bunch of stuff into it to make it worth applying as a deep conditioner.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used this product once but I love how my hair looks, feels and smells.  My hair is very straight with medium thickness but has been horribly dry with tons of flyaways lately.  I came across this product while grocery shopping at Safeway and decided to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I washed my hair and then combed big gobs of the product into my hair in several sections, from root to tip.  I probably used 1/8th - 1/4 of the entire product.  I left it on for 15 minutes and then rinsed it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is silky, shiny and pretty flat.  The flyaways have been tamed.  My hair has a nice, perfumey scent to it, as well.</li>
    <li> I have mixed, relaxed hair. I tried this product as a leave-in conditioner and rinsed after 5 minutes. It was like a grease that just got stuck to my hair! I had to shampoo my hair twice to get this greasy junk out of my hair. The smell of this product is similar to chicken grease. It was gross. I had to get some cheap conditioner that I had lying around to get rid of the dryness this Shea moisture masque left on my hair.&lt;br /&gt;I bought it at Target but I threw away the receipt so I&#x27;ve kept it around (not sure for what)...</li>
    <li> The  product worked very well for my hair. I use it as a deep conditioner every two weeks. It hydrates my hair , softens, gives my hair more volume and protects my ends from splitting. I am a natural 4 a women. If you are a natural person then this product is just for you. I also love that it&#x27;s organic. basically organic products grows hair faster. I&#x27;ve been using this product for a month and already my hair has grown a inch and a half.</li>
    <li> I purchased 4 of these from Target because it was on sale for half the price listed here. I added a bottle of African Black Soap Deep Cleansing Shampoo, and I got free shipping, too. That aside, I love this product as a leave in conditioner. It&#x27;s the best leave-in I have ever used for my natural hair styling. After shampooing and conditioning, I towel dry, very carefully, and use a small amount of the Shea Moisture Thickening Growth Milk as a leave-in. I follow that with an essential oil mix rubbed on my hands and worked through my hair. I rub a little glosser between my palms and work it around my hair, as well. I allow my hair to dry completely. I then separate my hair into three sections in front and four in the back. I spritz the ends with Shea Coconut Hibiscus Hold &amp; Shine and rub a little of the Deep Treatment Masque between my palms. Starting at the ends and working my way up, I work in the Deep Treatment Masque to the root -- avoiding placing product on my scalp. I then twirl the section around my finger and pin it. I do this for all sections. If I want looser waves, I take the sections down after a half our and allow them dry completely before separating. If I want tighter curls, I keep my hair in sections overnight. My hair is shiny and bouncy. I use additional styling products to maintain my hair for up to two weeks. Before using the Deep Treatment Masque as a leave-in, I was challenged with a lot more dryness and frizziness -- but those days are gone. I did try this product as a masque, but found that it left my hair feeling stripped. I read elsewhere that it worked as a leave-in, tried it, and love it! Note that I have very fine type 3C hair.</li>
    <li> This stuff smells DELISH! My husband loves it when I put it in my hair. I&#x27;m not as impressed by it as the other Shea Moisture products and probably wouldn&#x27;t buy it again. I doesn&#x27;t do that much for my hair. But again, it is nice and rich and smells great.</li>
    <li> Do not pay more than $10 for this stuff (base price) It is available at Target and Walgreens for 9.99!!!!! But it does work well on my hair , not as a deep condish or a rinse out, I use it as a leave in on damp hair and then seal with an oil.</li>
    <li> I tried this product to try and find a good deep conditioner for my hair.  I was having a lot of breakage and excessive shedding and picked up this product with hopes that it would help.  After washing my hair I applied a generous amount of the deep treatment masque to my 4b/4c hair as well as some olive oil to my scalp and hair strands.  I covered my hair with a plastic shower cap and sat under the hair dryer (high temp) for 40 minutes.  After I rinsed the the treatment out my hair was soft and it felt strong!!  When I combed through it to do a twist out, there was NO MORE Breakage and excessive shedding!!!  Very pleased with this product as a deep conditioner and I would recommend it to all my natural girls!!</li>
    <li> I bought this from cvs and was so excited to try it. However, it does not smell nice. I&#x27;m not sure how to describe it. Every time I&#x27;ve used it, my hair actually feels worse than it did before which was shocking to me, especially since it seems to be a more natural product. I was very disappointed.</li>
    <li> This product is terrible! It dried out my hair and I ended up with huge knots! I lost a lot of hair because of this horrible product.😡</li>
    <li> I like all the products so far. I&#x27;m just not a fan of the very strong smell</li>
    <li> This product does wonders for my hair.  I use it about once a week and the difference in softness and shine is immediately noticeable.</li>
    <li> I had already tried the Shea Moisture Raw Shea Restorative Shampoo and was thrilled to pieces with the result from that. So I was super excited to try this deep conditioner. It was really thick which is usually a good sign in a deep conditioner. When I first applied it to my very thick 3c/4a/4b hair it felt sort of hard which was really strange, but I finished the application anyway and covered my hair with a bag and towel and let it sit for an hour.  When I removed the towel and bag, ready to rinse out this so called amazing conditioner, I was appalled to find that my hair felt EVEN DRYER than it did before I  had even washed my hair! All the moisture from the SM Raw Shea Restorative shampoo was completely stripped.  This \\&quot;conditioner\\&quot; had the exact opposite effect that was desired AND advertised for this product! So I promptly returned it and bought the Shea Moisture Raw Shea Restorative Conditioning Milk with MUCH better results. Such a shame, this has such potential with so many awesome hydrating ingredients in it, but It just didn&#x27;t work for me.  :(</li>
    <li> I love this product and my hair loves this product. I have really long thick mixed wavy, curly, and coily hair. Before I wash my hair I part my hair in different sections and rinse out with warm water any of the \\&quot;all natural hair products\\&quot; that I may have previously had in my hair and put a clip on each section to keep the parted hairs separate. While my hair is still wet, I scoop up some of the Shea Moisture Deep Treatment Masque and smooth it into my hair from the roots to the ends. Then I take my wide tooth comb and starting at the bottom of my hair, comb through my hair until I reach the top of my hair and my scalp. This stuff is like a creamy conditioner butter and detangles my hair so phenomenally well, I bought more so I would always have it in stock. Love, love, love this stuff!</li>
    <li> I bought this brand of hair care products not here but at my local target.  The smell is strong but it didn&#x27;t really bother me.  All target had was the deep conditioning masque, the shampoo and the restorative elixir spray (naturally I didn&#x27;t have too much to choose from).  In my personal opinion the masque was not a very good conditioner for my 4b transitioning hair.  It just sits on my hair...I&#x27;ve left it on 30mins, combed it through, left it on with a conditioning cap...but still it&#x27;s just on the top layer of my hair.  It hasn&#x27;t gotten down to the roots.  Unsure if it&#x27;s me or the product. will continue to use until product is gone and hopefully I will find an application that gives me the results i&#x27;m looking for.</li>
    <li> I was ready to fall in love with this conditioner because of the great ingredients and it has such a great story. But it did not work on my hair AT ALL. I have very thick, 4a/b transitioning hair. I used this as a deep conditioner under a steamer and my hair was not moisturized in the least. And to add insult to injury, when I attempted to detangle my hair, a ton of my hair came out. I do however use the shampoo and the Coconut &amp; Hubiscus Smoothie and Style Milk. Both of those work just fine on my hair. But this masque... um no, not a winner for me.</li>
    <li> Amazing! I put it on at night and leave it until well into the next morning, giving it as much time as possible to stay in my hair. Then I wash it out with SM&#x27;s Coconut &amp; Hibiscus shampoo, and the result is tamed, soft, healthy looking curls for the first time in my life. I have very thick, coarse curly hair that is so hard to manage. This actually makes it look pretty. ^_^&lt;br /&gt;The smell is also enjoyable, although very strong. I&#x27;ve gotten compliments on the smell before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT: Ok, I found an even better way to use this stuff. First, clarify your hair really well (a normal shampoo won&#x27;t do, get neutrogena&#x27;s clarifying shampoo). Then, while still in the shower with soaking wet hair, apply a lot of this product. Spend some time combing it through really well. Leave it in. When you get out of the shower, dab a bit of the excess water with a towel and immediately wrap the hair into  a bun on top of your head. Leave it in for at least overnight but preferably as long as you can. I left it in for about 20 hours. Then, shampoo with a normal shampoo, and condition with a really good quality conditioner (I used Fekkai&#x27;s Glossing). Then you know the drill... put in your blow dry cream, etc. My hair was literally transformed from doing this. I have extremely thick, curly, unruly hair that is unpresentable without straightening and/or chemical treatments. This made it a completely different texture!! My hair feels like silk, and has a super healthy sheen I&#x27;ve never seen before. It literally was like I got some kind of really, really expensive treatment done, except no other treatments ever gave me this result. Seriously... try it o_o&lt;br /&gt;(This is only for very coarse, thick hair - if you already have thin hair it may make your hair TOO moisturized and weak!)</li>
    <li> This deep treatment conditioner is the real deal. It really puts your hair back to its roots! Ive been with the shea moisture movement lol for the last two years. Ive notice strong growth, damage control, hair strength with natural shine. Now that is what the shampoo and conditioner can do. Dont forget you must play your part as well for you to see your desired out come. You must know what would instergate the desire out come. Im a 4b natural and this is what my hair wanted. The shea moisture retention is my go to # 1 home girl shes on my side lol! FIVE STARS ALL DAY!</li>
    <li> I purchased this product after doing extensive research regarding my 4c hair type.  It is absolutely wonderful, finally my hair feels soft, conditioned and moisturized.  Please be aware that Walgreens also sells this line of products and it is far less expensive to purchase through Walgreens.</li>
    <li> My curly hair loves the natural products from this company but this shady seller is tripling the real price. This product sells for around $10 at Walgreen&#x27;s, Target ( stores and online) and a variety of drugstores. This product is made by a small, minority owned family business that believes in fair trade, sustainability and natural cruelty free products. They make a fine product at a reasonable price. This seller is doing something very dishonorable by tripling the price of their product and pocketing the difference.</li>
    <li> When I bought the restorative masque and used it as a deep conditioner, my hair was kind of dry. I have 4a/b hair so dry hair is the last thing I needed. But when i left it in my hair my hair had sheen and it was soft. So now I double twist with the masque and I love it. The people just need to experiment with it to the best use for each persons&#x27; hair. I would recommend using it as a styling cream, it say on the jar to use it as a styling cream, leave-in or a deep condition. In the Shea moisture brochure at Walgreens, the tip they gave was for those with kinky hair, may be used as a leave-in styling cream to do twists and braids. I do love their products, my hair has sheen and is soft now because of Shea Moisture. I&#x27;m a product junkie and quick to try a product someone suggests but I&#x27;m sticking with these products.</li>
    <li> This made my hair unbelievablely dry. Normally my 4c hair feels so soft with my usual deep conditioners but this made it feel li me straw. I could NOT comb my hair without hearing little snaps of dry brillo pad strands. I haven&#x27;t tried it as ac leave in yet but if it doesn&#x27;t work as it was advertised (as a deep conditioner), I consider it a failed product.</li>
    <li> I have waist-long, brunette hair of varying thickness and texture.  I also have been fighting dry scalp my whole life.  This product is the only thing I have found that has solved every single problem with my hair.  It prevents tangles, smooths my hair, and evens out the texture too.  And the SHINE!  I am amazed at how shiny my hair is after using this product.  I would not have thought to buy it before, as it is generally located in the section of the hair care aisle dedicated to ethnic hair.  But, after trying every dry scalp shampoo under the sun, every conditioner, and even salon products, I have found my go-to product.  I actually will rub this into my scalp as well, and that moisturizes it enough so it never flakes after using this conditioner. It does not weigh down my hair like other conditioners would if I put it on my scalp. I think those who are unhappy with this product have not given enough time to leave it on their hair.  I leave it on for at least 5 minutes straight.  When one is going through the morning shower routine, five minutes seems a lot longer than it is, so just be patient, and I promise it will pay off.  After using this product, I can let my hair air-dry and it comes out in beautiful, shiny waves, and not a single flake on my shoulders.  I am going to buy the [[ASIN:B0038TYTI4 Shea Moisture Raw Shea Butter Restorative Conditioning Milk - 12 oz.]] for everyday use, because I am finding that I use my [[ASIN:B0007CXYAE Paul Mitchell The Detangler 33.8 Ounces]] less and less.  I am definitely converting to the Shea Moisture brand!</li>
    <li> I have a hard time recommending this product to others because for me it works inconsistently.  There are days when this masque works like a dream and then there are days where after I rinse this out, it looks like my hair hasn&#x27;t seen conditioner in a year. Even when I use heat, I get erratic results from this product.  I do like the fact that it smells nice, and a little goes a long way.  But that could be my hair is short.  Detangling properties is minimal but I always detangle my hair before I shampoo and try my darnest not to over manipulate my hair when shampooing.  Once I finish this product, I will not repurchase.</li>
    <li> I am a Latina with wavy dark hair. I got highlights and since then I started bleaching my hair. I have tried many shampoos and conditioners to try to help my dry straw-like hair. After I ran out of shampoos/ conditioners to try, I tried the suave almond and Shea butter shampoo and conditioner and was amazed that something so inexpensive gave my hair bounce and definition to my waves and best of all my hair didn&#x27;t feel dry. I convinced myself that it had to be the Shea butter, so I went on a quest to find something better. This line appealed to me because it is organic and I have heard wonderful things about argan oil (which it also contains). I just had to try it. As soon as I got home I shampooed my hair like I usually do and got some of this product and put it on my hair. I was expecting something soft that would just absorb into my hair making it easy to run my fingers through it (like deep conditioners usually work)... I was completely wrong!!! It felt like I had just put pork LARD with perfume on my hair. I tried to blend it in with the rest of my hair, but I just couldn&#x27;t, so I got more and rubbed it between my palms and put it on the ends. I left it on for 30 minutes. When I finally rinsed it, my hair was a tangled mess. I tried to run a wide tooth comb through it, but my hair would just break. I got so frustrated that I rinsed my hair and put the suave conditioner (which helped with the tangles). Some days later I wanted to give it another try because I felt that I was doing something wrong, so I washed and conditioned my hair let it air dry half way and rubbed some of this product in my palms and applied it to my hair. I parted my hair and twisted it into two buns, left it like that for like an hour and.... SURPRISE!!! I have shinny, bouncy, beautiful waves!!! I usually don&#x27;t use styling products because I feel like they are a waste of time, BUT I will be using this for sure. I also can&#x27;t wait to try the shampoo and conditioner from this line.</li>
    <li> This has made my hair very managable and soft. I dnt think it took to my hair as great as it could have but i think it&#x27;s bc i didn&#x27;t use enough. I will try again and add more.</li>
    <li> I have thick coily 3/4 AA hair. This stuff does absolutely nothing for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not only that, but the smell is loud, lingering, and artificial. This is unfortunately common of all Shea Moisture products and something I truly dislike about the line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The texture is like watered down normal conditioner. I&#x27;ve tried it as a rinse out, deep conditioner, and leave in. I really don&#x27;t care for it at all. It retails $9.99 at Target or similar stores.</li>
    <li> I tried using this product after the mostly favorable reviews on it.  I do not like this product.  It did not leave my hair soft or detangled.  In fact my hair was very hard and tangled after using the masque. I have natural hair with a corkscrew pattern.  My hair is inherently dry and frizzy and this product just made it worse.  The only nice thing about this product is the smell...its very pleasant and fresh.  I would not purchase again.</li>
    <li> I use this product daily as a leave in for moisturizing my relaxed hair, and I love it. I&#x27;m actually surprised to see the inconsistency in these reviews because this stuff is great. It&#x27;s made of natural ingredients, and smells delicious. While the Shea Butter is a moisturizing sealant for the water in this product, I still apply coconut oil after using this. Many times, I just use this to moisturize the ends of my hair before bed, and since I live in Las Vegas (which is extremely dry year round) this masque protects my hair, and nourishes it. It makes the hair feel moisturized and light, instead of greasy. I also bought the Shea Moisture Moisturizing Retention Shampoo, which I am also very impressed with. I would suggest buying this from Walgreens instead of Amazon though. I love Amazon but this price is way too expensive. You can find this for half the price at Walgreens.</li>
    <li> I used this product as a deep conditioner under a heated cap for about an hour.  After I washed it out my hair was so soft and I can run my fingers through it!!  I have natural curly hair and its hard to run my fingers through it without getting my fingers caught in my hair.  This product is worth the price and it smells so good!!  I highly recommend it!!</li>
    <li> I have long, naturally coarse (but relaxed) hair and I bought Shea Moisture&#x27;s Deep Treatment Masque from Target after having had such a great experience with Shea Moisture&#x27;s Moisture Retention Shampoo (it&#x27;s the most gentle and moisturizing shampoo I&#x27;ve ever used). I had such high hopes for this product! The ingredients are of a high quality and I expected it to be very moisturizing. However, my first wave of disappointment came when I rinsed out the treatment and my hair did not have that smooth, sleek feeling that it usually has when I&#x27;m rinsing out a good moisturizing conditioner. It felt more like I was rinsing out a somewhat harsh shampoo. That was a foreshadowing of things to come because the end result was very dry hair! It didn&#x27;t feel as if I had conditioned my hair at all. I have gotten better results from using cheap instant conditioners. The only positive things I can say about this product are that the ingredients are great and it smells good. I just wish it made my hair feel half as good!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product had great reviews on Target, but I did note that one of the reviews stated that the formula had changed and that the reviewer now hates the product. I can see why! I would just throw it away, but as it was $9.99 and it does have good, natural ingredients, I&#x27;ve just been adding a bit to my other deep conditioners to slowly get rid of it. The container states that it can also be used as a leave-in, which I may eventually try. I hope to have better luck with that!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT: This product does work pretty well as a leave-in. It moisturizes decently, but leaves some residue on the surface of my hair as if it doesn&#x27;t absorb completely. It&#x27;s definitely better as a leave-in than it is as a deep conditioner. However, as I don&#x27;t need another leave-in (I needed a deep conditioner, which is what this product is marketed as), I won&#x27;t be purchasing this again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note: Please do not buy this product or any other Shea Moisture hair product for morethan $9.99! I&#x27;m baffled that they&#x27;re being sold for so much more than this! This product and all other Shea Moisture products normally retail for $9.99, which is the manufacturer&#x27;s price. You can find them at Walgreens and Target for $9.99.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ingredients: deionized water, Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea butter) (denotes certified organic ingredients), Argan oil, vegetable glycerin, emulsifying wax, sea kelp extract, Panthenol (vitamin B-5), essential oil blend, avocado oil, Lonicera Caprifolium (honeysuckle) flower and Lonicera Japonica (Japanese honeysuckle) flower extract, Tocopherol (vitamin E), Hyssopus Officinalis Extract, Salvia Officinalis (sage) leaf and Equisetum Arvense Extract, soybean oil and Daucus Carota Sativa (carrot) seed oil</li>
    <li> First off let me say that I have very curly kinky thick (Caucasian) hair. And I like this stuff. I do. I use it as a conditioner in the shower on my ends and as a mask all over once a week. It&#x27;s not that silky feeling you would expect to get from a conditioning treatment like this but I still like it. Only drawback for me is you have to rinse and rinse and rinse or it&#x27;ll end up looking really greasy on finer areas of hair and feel waxy as well when it&#x27;s dry. If you have fine/straight hair naturally then I would not recommend this. For my super curly hair it works. Defines the curls and moisturizes them. Think I paid twelve dollars or so for mine at Meijer. So for the price I think it is a good buy if you have the right hair type.</li>
    <li> my relaxed 4a bsl hair was so dry and tangled after i used it. my hair felt more moisturized after just shampooing than with the deep conditioner. i had to do another deep conditioning treatment on my hair. i gave it to one of my natural friends and she loved it.</li>
    <li> I recently purchased this product a few days ago. It worked wonders. I have relaxed hair that I apply heat to once a week. As I am on a hair journey, I needed a deep conditioner and a protein treatment. I have bad experience with protein treatments because they dry my hair really bad. So I decided to try it again but this time with the deep conditioner. It says to apply generously and that&#x27;s exactly what I did. 45 minutes later I washed it out with my shampoo and conditioner. Although I didn&#x27;t notice a difference initially, after flat ironing my hair, I noticed it had an amazingly soft and heavy texture to it. Usually my hair is weightless and flowy. But this product added a great glossy film to my hair while still keeping it flowing. I will definitely be using this again!</li>
    <li> I really wanted to like this product. I love the shampoo and it left my hair very soft so I thought the conditoner would allow me to detangle effortlessly. I applied it to one section of my hair and by the time I got to the third section, I realized that my hair suddenly felt a bit rough and my root area started to tangle. I immediately rinsed it off! My hair cuticle already felt rough! I took out my little secret conditoner, Aussie 3 minute conditioner and my hair went back to feeling smooth and easy to detangle. I will NEVER try this conditioner again.</li>
    <li> This product DOES NOT work well as a rinse out conditioner. I am in my 5th month of transitioning. After washing with the shampoo (which is FABULOUS) this conditioner left my hair without ANY softness and VERY difficult to detangle. My husband asked \\&quot;why is all that hair coming out?\\&quot; However, when I used it as a leave in conditioner it worked great! Left my hair soft and shiny but without any feeling of heavy product buildup.</li>
    <li> I have 4c grade hair and purchased this product to help with transitioning to natural hair after using chemical hair relaxers for many years. I did not purchase the product from Amazon, and so am not knocking the company (my favorite site) or the seller. But, I felt strongly that anyone should know what happened to me. I&#x27;m hoping that I am a rare case. My decision to stop using relaxers was made because over the past 6 months I&#x27;ve been experiencing extreme hair thinning. I used this item 2 days ago in the shower, leaving it in for about 10 minutes while I showered. I experienced SO much hair fall, it was unbelievable and very stressful. I literally was pulling handfuls of strands of hair out. This is Day 2, and I&#x27;m still losing hair like crazy. Literally pulling it out. Hoping this will stop. It&#x27;s  very stressful. I&#x27;ve never had anything like this happen before. It was also very drying for my hair and even contributed to knotting. I&#x27;ll update if the hair fall stops.</li>
    <li> I have long medium blonde hair and have struggled with dry scalp and course hair my whole life. My hair is also so thick that if I don&#x27;t shower every day/every other day, I get headaches because my hair will pull on my scalp. All the leave in conditioners end up leaving my hair oily and greasy which is AWFUL. I just put this in my hair (Dry and clean) then let it sit for 30-40 minutes while I do other things. It doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down or hurt my scalp at all. I&#x27;m about to wash it out. BTW- if you&#x27;re military, you can usually purchase this at an exchange for less than $10.</li>
    <li> Really great deep conditioner. For all hair types not just naturals. I use it on my four yr old too</li>
    <li> Such an amazing product! Especially for all the curly girls. Just make sure you&#x27;re using the product correctally, it cost too much money to waste it!</li>
    <li> The Deep Treatment Masque is my next to favorite product in the Shea Moisture line. I have extremely dry hair but and use the Deep Treatment 1-2x a week as a leave-in/styler and at the end of the day my hair still looks great and feels moist (not wet) and soft. It smells like shea butter so not as appealing at the smoothie product hence the 4 starts as opposed to 5. Would be nice if there was a \\&quot;softer\\&quot; scent to the product. As another reviewer said, it can be purchased at Target for $9.99.</li>
    <li> I normally do not write reviews but I have to warn others out there to not buy.  I have 4C hair and i&#x27;ve been natural for almost two years. To disclose I do have a color in my hair that i&#x27;ve been growing out the past five months. So I thought this product will do the trick to deep condition and moistourize. Boy was I wrong. As soon as the cream touched my hair, it became dry, brittle, felt like staw or brillo. Usually my hair reacts like that to shampoos that are not for my hair type. I&#x27;m not sure what is in this product, maybe it was the color in my hair, but I doubt it because my hair was soft before.  My hair revolted in the worse way. There is something in this product that does not blend well with 4c hair or color. Not sure what it is but I was surprised and dissappointed because I love Shea Moisture products.</li>
    <li> I used it twice...I like it</li>
    <li> Like others mentioned, I got this at Target for $10. I have been having a lot of issues with my hair over the last 3 years. Mainly, it hasn&#x27;t grown at all (in fact, my hair has progressively gotten shorter due to damage). I have use many deep conditioners, leave ins, etc, to try and make my hair manageable, but none have worked until now!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been straightening my hair since I was 13 years old. My hair is wavy, thick, and easily broken. I&#x27;ve always wanted to wear my hair natural, but it is so unruly and frizzy that I never felt comfortable with it natural. This product has changed all that. This product has allowed me to wear my hair natural for the first time ever!  As a deep conditioner, I give this only 3 stars, but as a leave in I give it 5 stars, so I averaged that and gave it 4 stars. I put a small amount (a few drops) in my hair while it is wet, and follow it with a small amount of coconut oil (which I have been using for years), and my hair dries beautifully. My waves are manageable, even, and not frizzy. Best of all, I can comb my hair when it&#x27;s dry without making it puff up and I can run my hands through it without it breaking. It feels great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works well as a deep conditioner, but it&#x27;s nothing stupendous. It works as well as other deep conditioners I&#x27;ve used that are less expensive. I had no problems rinsing it out, but it did leave my hair feeling a little greasy when it dried. I prefer Queen Helene Cholesterol as a deep conditioner, and it is much more affordable at $8 for 32 ounces on Amazon.</li>
    <li> I love this product. I shampoo with Aunt Jackies Oh so Clean shampoo, condition with any rinse out conditioner and then saturate hair with this product and leave in for a few minutes. Next I rinse out most is the product but leave some in. I then follow with Shea Moisture Moisture milk and mixture of SM Curl Enhancing Smoothie mixed with SM curl soufflé. Result is bouncy moisturized defined curls. Type 3a, 3b hair!</li>
    <li> I use this product both as a deep conditioning treatment and as a leave-in when my hear feels dry and brittle.  I am extremely sensitive to chemical (artificial) fragrances. I am sensitive to some essential oils also, but I have a fighting chance with natural products. This particular product has almost no odor, which is good for me.  I&#x27;m a white male with type 3 hair. An African-American friend with cosmetology school experience told me I should be using &amp;#34;ethnic&amp;#34; products. I used to have short hair, but since retiring, I am now playing blues music part-time and grew my hair out for the proper look. This winter was terribly dry and I had no knowledge in advance what that would do to my hair. The dryness left my hair unmanageably coarse and knotted. I couldn&#x27;t even pull out the knots with my fingers, so I had to learn about proper hair care. I use this as a leave-in conditioner and while I have badly damaged hair from trying to comb it this winter; I was pulling handfuls of hair out of the comb; this product has fixed the problem.  I have switched to Shea Moisture products entirely, and they are a good value at local stores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I see that the reviews are pretty polarized of the love/hate variety.  All I can say is that it works magic for me.  I&#x27;m no hair expert, but I imagine that hair type, climate and other hair products used probably make the difference.  I unhesitatingly recommend it to people with hair and hair problems like mine.</li>
    <li> After using this product on it&#x27;s own several times with lackluster and quite frankly, piss poor results, I think I&#x27;ve AT LAST gotten the hang of using the Raw Shea Butter Deep Treatment Masque. The first several times I used this product I was VERY dissapointed. I ended up with straw-like hair, and I think that has a lot to do with the Shea Butter as a main ingredient. I can&#x27;t use Shea Butter on it&#x27;s own in my hair-it dries it out something awful. I have to use it in combination with a lighter oil like Jojoba, Grapeseed or Olive. Since the base for this product is Shea, it would likely leave my hair feeling dry and stripped after I used it. This was exactly what happened whenever I used this product on it&#x27;s own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have 3b/3c hair (so I believe). I do not use coconut oil outside of deep conditioning for my hair because I find that it is much too heavy and on me, leaves an oily residue that is impossible to remove outside of washing. I have fine hair, so this may be why coconut oil and I do not get along. The only reason why I decided to use this masque was because I was pressed for time, lacked several of the main ingredients to make my own DIY Dry Hair Treatment Masque, lacked the money to BUY said main ingredients, and didn&#x27;t want to leave my house because I was too comfortable and it was cold outside. At the time, my hair was very dry due to winter weather and prolonged heat use. I had been sitting under a bonnet dryer and doing wet sets for probably 2 months. Wet sets with perm rods and an hour or so under a dryer were not making my hair happy. I needed moisture, and it was the one thing I lacked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to mix this masque with some unrefined, organic coconut oil I had lying around. I divided my hair into sections and ran coconut oil through each section and followed it with a good cupped fingerful of the Shea Moisture Organic Raw Shea Butter Masque. The oil gave the masque more slip than it had previously, and the oil seemed to allow themasque to actually sink into the hair and penetrate the shaft, instead of just sitting on top of the hair and coating it, which is all that I feel that this masque does when used by itself. I twisted each section into a chunky bantu knot and covered my hair with a plastic shower cap. I left the masque on for probably 2 1/2 hours, maybe closer to 3. Then I rinsed out. Rinsing out my hair felt moisturized, and I seemed to shed a lot less hair than I normally do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Afterwards, when I styled my hair, it seemed to help my curls define themselves (they have trouble with this normally) and my hair felt MUCH more moisturized than it had been for months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Three days out, after a no heat styling regimen, I&#x27;m pleased to say that my hair seems to be doing a good job of retaining the moisture that the masque seemed to put into it. I&#x27;m just now seeing the effects of dryness, but it&#x27;s by no means as bad as it was before I started. Spritzing my hair nightly with some water and tea-tree oil mixed in and rubbing jojoba oil through my hair before bed seems to help too. For dryness, the Raw Shea Butter Deep Treatment Masque PLUS added coconut oil seemed to really do the trick. If i&#x27;m out of everything I&#x27;ll use this mixture again but I won&#x27;t buy another tub of this masque when I run out of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I plan on making my own masque for dry hair when I run out of the Shea Moisture one. Less expensive than spending $10.00 (don&#x27;t buy this for $23 on Amazon, in my opinion it&#x27;s only worth about $7 and you can find it at Target for $10.00) but IMHO, not worth it unless you have nothing else. You can find so-easy-it&#x27;s-painful recipies for DIY Dry Hair Treatments on youtube or on any other curly girl website or blog that will cost less than this to make and will last longer. The fact that for me it only works with the coconut oil added is also another &#x27;meh&#x27;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another dissapointing Shea Moisture purchase. I&#x27;ll see if I still like the Curl Enhancing Smoothie afterwinter&#x27;s over and then do a review on that one.&lt;br /&gt;********************************************EDIT*********************************************************&lt;br /&gt;I will be repurchasing this Masque to use again with unrefined coconut oil. I have not been using deep treatments that sit on the hair for some time for over two months (pressed for time) and I can definitely see a change in my hair. Deep conditioners that are only kept in for a few minutes and then rinsed out on wash day are NOT cutting it for me. This is one of the only Masque&#x27;s that worked even halfway decently. Greek yogurt, Mayo, Oil Combos-my hair is too fine for all of them. It just gets very oily and looks disgusting and I end up washing a few days later. So, I&#x27;ll be repurchasing this to give my hair a much needed boost.</li>
    <li> My hair type:&lt;br /&gt;Bleached then dyed a bright red color as of last week.&lt;br /&gt;Hits my waist, and is medium thickness.&lt;br /&gt;Naturally wavy/curly (the curls loosen out the longer it gets).&lt;br /&gt;Moderate frizz, especially in the Georgia climate I live in.&lt;br /&gt;Lightly oily roots and split-end prone tips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I’m becoming a fan of the Shea Moisture collection. I religiously use the Shea Moisture Raw Shea Butter Restorative Conditioner on my hair.  I wanted to try some kind of deep conditioner masque to revitalize my hair after I dyed it, mainly because it wasn’t the color I wanted, so I was using a clarifying shampoo to lighten it. Unfortunately, that also dries it out A LOT.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I applied this conditioner in the shower and pinned it up for about 5 minutes, then rinsed it out. There wasn’t much difference in the condition of my hair initially. No extra softness and manageability, and definitely nothing like the Restorative Conditioner can do with my hair. But when it was dried, it seemed to have left some kind of… film on my hair. And yes, I know how to rinse out a conditioner, and I rinsed it out in the shower. I think this masque may be more suited to exceptionally dry hair, not just processed/dyed hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Later, I went to the store and got a different deep conditioner that actually worked really well. It was this one: http://www.amazon.com/Shea-Moisture-Tahitian-Smooth-Nourishing/dp/B00JDSLQZ8/ref&#x3D;sr_1_1?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1436372778&amp;sr&#x3D;8-1&amp;keywords&#x3D;shea+moisture+tahitian&amp;pebp&#x3D;1436372774636&amp;perid&#x3D;1BDNGFTVWQA82EHD0Q56&lt;br /&gt;I don’t imagine I’d come back to this deep conditioner, especially not when I found a different one that works well for my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;-Easy-open jar makes it easy to simply get however much you need, rather than using a squeeze bottle which might give you more than you need.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;-Weird/unpleasant smell.&lt;br /&gt;-Left a strange film on dry hair, without actually nourishing or conditioning. It was kind of greasy, after just one wash.g. It was kind of greasy, after just one wash.</li>
    <li> This is not conditioner where you think it&#x27;ll leave your hair soft and easier to detangle very good conditioner but not the masque where leaves your hair soft but it does work and restores</li>
    <li> As a back ground:  I am a very fair white with med blond natural relatively strait hair.  My hair has always been oily at the roots and tangled and braking to a varying degree throughout my life somewhat worse lately.  Whether this is due to hypothyroidism or some other reason I do not know.  Several of the things I have had success with were eventually discontinued, the last thing that worked for me was the grainier fructis[[ASIN:B0013LAR80 Garnier Fructis Fortifying Deep Conditioner 3 Minute Masque 10.2 oz.]] deep condoning mask and before that Wella cholesterol.  I have tried moroccanoil restorative hair mask[[ASIN:B003H3KLLA MOROCCANOIL by Moroccanoil: RESTORATIVE HAIR MASK 8.5 OZ]] it works but not as well because the Shea moisture absorbs more easily and mixes better with water also.  Also the morroccanoil needs to be reapplied every time you wash as it diminishes in its treatment in just one wash, even a wash without shampoo. also the moroccanoil must be on for 7 minets in practice to do any good at all. The Shea moisture can be applied for a normal amount of time as a regular conditioner(1-2 minuets)it absorbs quickly and stays thought many washings with a noticeable dryness&#x27; returning after the second sequential wash, althought this is not a return to previose hair statuse.  The Shea moisture makes my broken frizzy hair lay down without weighing down the rest.  The hair feels nice and soft, it is very good at combating and preventing tangles in my hair, and its making brushing pain free.  It has a pleasant very light sent which is a major advantage over the moroccanoil, also I have allergies to many perfumes, and neither of these seems to be an allergen.  If you can&#x27;t find it at the store it is worth the online price.  the container says the treatment is between 5 and thirty minuests.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product in a few ways; as a leave in, a deep conditioner, and for twist outs. After first trying this as a deep conditioner, I couldn&#x27;t honestly say that I was that impressed. But after I decided to use it as a leave in, then I truly found the product that works for me. So now I only use this as a leave in and for my twist outs. It leaves my hair soft and moisturized. So perhaps if you&#x27;re using this product as a deep treatment after your shampoo, try using it as a leave in moisturizer. You may find better results. I sure did and I can honestly say this is one of my leave in products I always keep in the house.</li>
    <li> I used this product as an overnight conditioner for my 4b hair type and it is wonderful. My hair is soft and moisturized. I hadn&#x27;t found a product yet amidst all that I have gotten. By right I am a product junkie and have a household full of items I have bought but this one is a keeper!!!!!</li>
    <li> This product was recommended to help with the dryness of my daughter’s hair.  This Masque left my daughters hair brittle, tangled and very dry feeling, which is crazy because her hair responds really well to shea butter.  I immediately put a deep condition in after unsuccessfully attempting to comb through her hair but it still feels brittle and tangles easily.  I can tell it&#x27;s going to take a few deep conditionings to restore her hair to a normal ph balance.  Based on the reviews, this product is a hit or miss and most of those who &amp;#34;Love&amp;#34; it aren&#x27;t using it as directed,  but rather mixing it with water using it as a leave-in, adding oil to combat the dryness, etc.  I&#x27;m sorry but if I have to tweak a product  that much (at this cost), it&#x27;s a failure.</li>
    <li> I purchased this based on the shampoo, which i love. However, this has to be one of the worst conditioners i&#x27;ve ever used. I cant even use it as a leave in. I have course, relaxed shoulder length hair, and it did absolutely nothing. Still in the hunt for a decent deep treatment for moisture. I cannot recommend it. plus, the price is way too much on Amazon.</li>
    <li> I am really fair when it comes to products and giving them a chance. However, this masque is not a good deep treatment at all. It does what it says, \\&quot;Masque\\&quot; the hair and nothing more. No moisture, no shine, no nothing. Just a product sitting on my hair. I love Shea Moisture, but I&#x27;m sorry..this one is a no:(</li>
    <li> I love this masque! Each time I have used this product it has left my hair feeling both strong and soft!! Excellent product, however I do recommend that If you are on the look out for this product I&#x27;d suggest shopping at target or Walgreens because the seller on here is too expensive!</li>
    <li> I initially tried this product as a rinse out conditioner and was not pleased. I really wanted it to work. I loved the ingredients and the smell of it so I decided to try it another way. Upon reading the instructions, I realized that it could be used as a leave in. When I opened the jar, I realized I had left a stray hair from using it before. That hair was SOOOOOO super soft, smooth, and not gummy at all! So away I went to putting it in my hair. As a leave in, this product is fabulous. I love to put it on my freshly washed (natural and kinky) hair (be careful not to OD on the product), let it absorb, then shingle my hair with my eco styler. It&#x27;s \\&quot;fantasitical\\&quot; lol. It leaves it soft and with a hold, but not cap&#x27;n crunch crispity :)</li>
    <li> I have finally found it! yessssss! I use this as a Deeeeeep conditioner by mixing with amla oil, castor oil and rosemary oil. It works wonders on my relaxed hair. If I DC with another product then i use it as a leave in. I have recently started using it as a moisturizer and styling for my twist-outs and bantu knots and it leaves my hair soft and silky. I can feel the moisture when I touch my ends.&lt;br /&gt;This is my absolute fav SM product as it&#x27;s a fantastic multitasker and the results are unmatched thus far.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;************************ &lt;---- me giving it additional stars. lol :)</li>
    <li> This stuff needs to be renamed because it definitely isn&#x27;t a good deep conditioner. When I initially bought this, I was so excited to hopefully find my staple, holy grail deep conditioner. FAIL! My hair was the least bit impressed when I rinsed this out. I was so sad lol. A few weeks later I really wanted to try this again so I read some other reviews and decided to use it as a styler for my twist outs. When I took the twists out the next day, they were nice and moisturized and just giving life to the lifeless! I am on my third jar and I only use it as a styler. Pairing it with the elixir from this line also produces amazing results!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used other Shea Moisture products and have been happy with the results but this masque is terrible. It made my hair extremely dry and caused a lot of breakage that took me two weeks of moisturizing my hair at least three times per day to finally get back to normal. Looking at the ingredients this product contains mainly oils and oils do not moisturize the hair. Never again.</li>
    <li> I bought this product about two weeks ago and have used it three times as a deep conditioner. I apply it toddy hair and let it sit for about 30 minutes, then I take a normal shower. Rinsing out the deep conditioner, washing with shampoo and regular conditioner. I have seen immediate results! My hair is softer, shinier, and looks 10 times healthier. I have very fine, thin, brown hair, which gets very dry. This is the first deep conditioning treatment that I have used, and I am very impressed with the immediate results. I can&#x27;t wait to see the long term results, and i am hoping it helps my overall hair health. I have not have any of the bad experiences that other people seem to have had. My hair does not feel sticky, or hard after using this product. I don&#x27;t apply direct heat to my hair while its sitting, but I do have a gas fireplace and stay in that room so that it gets some heat exposure but not enough to damage my hair. Overall, its a great product and I would recommend it to anyone, with any hair type.</li>
    <li> do not buy this here!! at walgreens and target its only 9.99!!! thats how much the company has made it for the same size! these people are ripping you off if you buy this.</li>
    <li> I did NOT like this product. It left my hair feeling drier than before I used it. It went right in the garbage.</li>
    <li> I have 4a type hair.  I bought this thinking I would get some great moisture . Boy Was I wrong. And I was also confused because the ingredients are great.  I used it one time and I will never use it again.  My hair was crispy dry.  I was able to detangle. But I felt a crispy dryness while detangling my hair. Also be careful with all these products aimed at natural hair.  Learn about your hair needs.  It becomes easier with time and patience.</li>
    <li> DO NOT buy this product! I had an AWFUL experience with it yesterday.  (Type 3b/c). I followed the directions exactly, and even added a bit of olive oil. However, this product caused my hair to matte together. It has also pulled or stripped my natural curl pattern making it stringy and knot up. SO, if you have well-defined curls, skip this product, as I will now have to undergo a hair-cut.&lt;br /&gt;Oh well, you live and you learn, to help someone else, right?</li>
    <li> I use the raw shea butter Shea Moisture shampoo and conditioner and love them!  I use this mask for 5 minutes in the shower once a week or so and it helps banish dryness and leaves my hair shiny, very supple, soft and full of body.  I also use it for 45 minutes with a heat cap once a month for extra conditioning.  My hair is long so dryness is always a problem.  It smells wonderful; refreshing and slightly floral with hint of earthiness.  It&#x27;s super thick and rich, thicker than another SM mask I&#x27;ve tried (10 in 1 Renewal which I also like a lot).  I coat my midlengths and ends really well after shampooing when my hair is towel dried well.  I find that this mask works better if my hair is not super wet.  This formula does not contain silicone so the natural ingredients really penetrate the hair shaft.  It also does not contain protein so it&#x27;s purely hydrating.  It banishes dryness really well and leaves my hair in great condition.  I think it works best with heat but if you don&#x27;t have a heat cap, you can use a hot towel or a plastic shower cap and a blow dryer on low.  I&#x27;m a big SM fan. I also use the Shea Moisture Jamaican Black Castor Oil shampoo, which is also sulfate free and removes styling product buildup with apple cider vinegar.  I use it every 3rd or 4th shampoo.  I use a lot of styling products and this shampoo keeps my hair bouncy and light while still protecting my precious hair color.  I discovered raw shampoo while browsing the net for hair tips. Apparently, raw shampoo is different from other sulfate free formulas.  There were two shampoos mentioned and the other one, which did not garner the same rave reviews, is quite a bit more expensive (triple the SM price) and only available online. But the reviewers were truly in love with SM so I decided to try it.  The article did say that it takes several uses before the benefits became obvious, that the PH level of the scalp takes time to normalize.  The first time I used it my hair fell a bit flat and I was tempted to return it.  But I continued to use it and each time my hair looked better and better.  Now I have a good hair day nearly every day!  I truly believe that the results are contingent on using the shampoo and conditioner together and the mask is a great supplement to the routine. Some Amazon review posts have stated that this shampoo left the hair tangled or matted. This certainly has not been my experience.  Both the raw shea butter conditioner and the mask have plenty of slip, that in other S &amp; Cs is accomplished by heavy silicone.  In my local drugstore, SM products are in the African American hair care section so I had never noticed them before.  Many of the positive reviews have come from those with Caucasian hair like mine, which is medium in texture and slightly wavy but I think all hair types can benefit from these products.  I do think that this mask in particular is perhaps too heavy for fine hair, which would likely benefit from the 10 in 1 Renewal formula instead, which is considerably lighter or the new Fruit Fusion formula, which is specially for fine hair (and only available at Ulta).  I think I&#x27;ve found my holy grail product line and I will continue to use these products.  I&#x27;m hooked!  SM is available in Walgreens, Ulta, CVS and Target for about $11.  Unfortunately, none of these stores carries the entire product line (which includes body care as well).  This is a small family-owned company that uses a grandmother&#x27;s recipes.  I like that fact very much and am happy to purchase products that actually live up to their claims.  I most definitely recommend this mask and SM in general.tempted to return it.

    <li> I used this product as directed. I noticed when I went to wash it out, several strands of hair came out just from me gently pulling on it. I then proceeded to detangle and comb it and a lot more of my hair came out.  I am praying that my hair does not continue to shed.  If it does, I will probably follow this up with an apple cider vinegar rinse just to rid my hair of this product completely .  I&#x27;ve posted a picture. This may not seem like a lot of hair breakage for some, but for me this is a bit much.  I have long, thick, 4C hair</li>
    <li> I am giving this product 4 stars because it works great after some doctoring and a different approach. I first used it on wet hair post-shampoo. First off, it felt like putting lotion in my hair. It left my hair feeling awful and hard to comb. I was so disgusted that I almost threw it away. I then remembered that I can&#x27;t afford to be wasteful and decided to make it work. I added 1/3 cup coconut oil and 1/4 cup olive oil. I applied the new mixture to dry hair in sections, covered it with a plastic cap, and left it in overnight. The next morning, I shampood as usual. My hair was very soft and I noticed that there was far less shedding when combing my wet hair. I think I&#x27;ve found my new go to DC.</li>
    <li> I am very impressed with this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been natural just over a year now. Unsure of which products to use, I started with Shea Moisture because the products were available EVERYWHERE and were very affordable.  I&#x27;d been using the Curl Enhancing Smoothie as my styling product, then I tried the Souffle; both were good but nothing got my curls to sing until I tried the Deep Treatment Masque.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is great for co-washing, styling &amp; deep conditioning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My regimen is pretty simple, nightly, I apply to damp/wet hair in sections then brush through with a Denman, two strand twist then cover my head with a sleeping bonnet.  The next morning my curls are defined, soft, soft, soft &amp; did I say, SOFT?!!  Oh my goodness!  My hair feels like a mixture of new born babies hair, medicated cotton &amp; kitten fur.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When applied correctly, the products work well together &amp; do not leave a messy build up.  My senses agree with the scent of the products...they don&#x27;t clash or stand out against whatever fragrance I am wearing.  Long, hot, sunny summer days outdoors are no longer a problem if I don&#x27;t wear a hat/cap...my curls last &amp; last.  My hair does get bigger but the definition &amp; softness never fades. This product did not feel greasy or heavy and it added shine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product for textured hair of all types, babies, men and naturals &amp; especially color treated naturals.  For optimum results hair should be natural from root to tip.</li>
    <li> I finally figured out how to use this product!  As so many others have stated, for some reason this product does not seem to work well as a rinse out conditioner.  After washing my hair and slightly drying my hair (just enough to keep it from dripping), I tried this product with heat and without...no luck.  However, I decided to try it the same way the Aubrey Organics Honeysuckle Rose Conditioner instructs, and that is to apply it to dry hair.  After I apply a fair amount of the masque, I apply about 5-6 tablespoons of coconut oil on top and leave it on about 20-30 minutes.  Works like a dream!  I then co-wash as usual and have soft, well-conditioned, moisturized hair.  I always wondered why the Aubrey Organics said to apply to dry hair, but then I remembered reading a you tube response that said the reason you apply deep conditioners to dry hair is the same reason you use a dry sponge on a spill.  It absorbs more.  Makes sense!  If anyone has had trouble with the deep treatment masque working for you, please try it on dry hair with some coconut oil on top.  I think you will be pleased.  I gave this product four stars because I have to add coconut oil to it. I think since it is advertised as a deep treatment it should work on its own, but I do like it.  After I finish up my Honeysuckle Rose, this will be my deep conditioner of choice (only because I like the smell of the masque better).  Also...as a side note, coconut oil ON ITS OWN on dry hair is an excellent deep conditioner.  I have 4a/4b natural hair.</li>
    <li> I have 4a/b hair and I love using this conditioner for my twist outs.  It makes my hair so soft, shiny, and it feels moisturized without being greasy.  I&#x27;m loving my hair! Will definitely continue to use this.</li>
    <li> I have yet to use these products but I&#x27;ve heard great things about them and I&#x27;m hoping my hair loves it. But I just purchased 4 items from Walgreens website and only paid $33 for all products. They are only $10.99 on the website and its buy one get one 50% off.</li>
    <li> Product is more like 99% water and 1% all the ingredients listed.</li>
    <li> It makes my hair silky and defines my curls which makes me love my hair! So for all you curly headed girls out there, give it a try and see if  it doesn&#x27;t help with the frizz and the undefined ringlets you have been wanting so badly. I helped me a lot and I will be using this from now on. I wish they sold it in vats..LOL</li>
    <li> This is pretty great in my opinion. I&#x27;ve had the hardest time with my hair, its frizzy and can dry out EASILY. I use this ans mix in some warmed up coconut oil (run it under hot water in the jar because microwaving it changes the chemicals.) More importantly, I put it on my DRY hair 45 minutes before my shower and then rinse, shampoo, and condition. It&#x27;s wonderful. I&#x27;ve read some poor reviews and my only conclusion is that everyone&#x27;s hair is different, but if your hair resembles a horses tail THIS IS FOR YOU!!</li>
    <li> I applied this to my hair with a heat cap and all for an hour, after rinsing it out I did not notice any significant differences or enhancement in my hair&#x27;s health. While detangling I noticed my hair was shedding massively and my ends appeared to be split, I don&#x27;t apply heat, dye,or any damaging actions to my hair. So I was very shocked and disappointed. I&#x27;ve tried a lot of different Shea moisture hair products and it just doesn&#x27;t seem to work for me. I will never buy from Shea moisture again</li>
    <li> This product dries my hair out which is titled Shea&#x27;s Moisture Deep Treatment Masque. It made my hair shed and break. Definitely wouldn&#x27;t use again. Aubrey Organics would better if your looking got natural products.</li>
    <li> This product doesn&#x27;t feels like conditioner. When I put this product in my hair it immediate made my hair feel hard and dry and also must I mention it burn my scalp, yes burn my scalp. I didnt have any open sores in my scalp either. I wouldnt recommend this product to anybody who already has dry hair. If your hair is oily this product might like i said might work for you but it didnt work for me. I&#x27;m upset that this product is selling for the price it is becuase the way it made my hair feel this product should be .99 cent.</li>
    <li> I read all the reviews for this product, the good and the bad. I figured since some reviews were very positive I would try this product, hoping I&#x27;d have a good experience and not negative one. I should NOT have risked it. My hair is very long naturally 2c and in not too bad of shape, I just needed more moisture. Now it is dry and crispy and I LOST a good bit of hair in the shower. How can a treatment cause this? This product is amazingly BAD.</li>
    <li> Simply: it does not work.&lt;br /&gt;And then I find the small letters: mix in some olive oil for great results. I did. Still does not work.&lt;br /&gt;And anyhow, I am buying a fully finished product, not some ingredients to add some other stuff to it so it may work.&lt;br /&gt;Really very very bad!</li>
    <li> For me as well as many others this worked better as a leave in product for my curls.  I need a little weight to my hair and this helped keep my ringlet tight curls defined with great moisture for days.  The use of this product, honey child guava hair balm and Curl Define by AfroVeda really improved my wash and go&#x27;s.  I can now wash and go, use a diffuser and give my curls length with consistent moisture.  I finally found my ultimate combination and I no longer have to wet my hair and start over to get fresh looking curls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I used this as a treatment masque it was just so so.  I really like what it does when it dries in my hair as a styling cream.</li>
    <li> Good ingredients .. This product worked well on my natural 4b/4c hair texture. I added extra virgin olive oil to it while I had a big glob of it in my hand before adding it to my hair .. I admit this product does make your hair feel a little hard once rinsed out, but I had no hair fall out, or strange reactions due to using it .. The 10 in 1 masque by Shea Moisture is what I usually use and I didn&#x27;t expect this Raw Shea Butter one to leave my hair extra soft due to the raw ingredients. This masque is meant for a whole different purpose. I use shea butter by itself regularly on my hair anyway so I think that&#x27;s why this product didn&#x27;t disappoint me like it did others who used it, my hair is use to raw ingredients.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t touch it! I&#x27;ve never lost so much hair in my entire life. I read all the good comments and got sucked into them, but I&#x27;m telling you - read those bad comments too. Those are true. The fact that in order for this product to be effective, you have to &amp;#34;figure out how to use it&amp;#34;, that is, combine it with multiple other products to make it work, means it&#x27;s not even worth it. If you can&#x27;t use the instructions at the back of the container (wash your hair, apply this cream, put it under a shower cap for a while, etc), it means you should probably stay away from it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A product treating dry hair should not make your hair drier, more brittle, clumpy and chunky. No. If I never had the Shea Moisture Leave In conditioner and Africa&#x27;s Best Herbal Oil gouped up in my hair to fix the problem, who knows would happen. I just hope I don&#x27;t keep continuously shedding. Cause then I&#x27;d lose my mind. Don&#x27;t buy this product, trust me! Don&#x27;t say &amp;#34;oh, I might take a chance - that&#x27;s just that one person, I may be as lucky&amp;#34;. Shea Moisture makes many other treatment products that don&#x27;t require half as much work as this one. Stick to those. Trust me.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve started wearing my hair natural again about a month ago and the more I researched, the more I learned how essential deep conditioners are.  Before I stopped during the winter months (I wore my hair primarily straight)  I was using the Shea moisture line and love their products so I decided to try this after months of  intense straightening and heat damage. From what I read people mistook this as a detangler which it is not. It is a reconstructer and just like heat damage can stress your hair repair hair products can just in a different way. So if you&#x27;re hair is like mine it can end up a bit tangled after all of that repair. That&#x27;s why you use an actual detangler (which this line has) and leave ins  to help loosen your hair and that&#x27;s what I do. I&#x27;ve had no problems. I also went with adding coconut oil just so my hair doesn&#x27;t dry out too much because I learned that if you use a product longer than recommend (I leave it on for an hour)  it could cause a bit of dryness. Which I don&#x27;t mind.  As long as the product does what it says it does I&#x27;m satisfied.</li>
    <li> This is a product that if you don&#x27;t know how to use it, it won&#x27;t work properly and thats what happened to me the first time. i bought it because my cousin raved on and on about it, she told me to just apply it on dry hair before i showered to leave it on for 10 min or so and then just jump in the shower and wash it off. but i decided to follow the instructions on the bottle, and i applied it wet hair and left it on for about 30 min or so. i don&#x27;t know how but i swear it did nothing to my hair, as a matter of fact i felt it made my tips drier. now, i had bought this and i was not about to let it go to waste so i decided to try it the way my cousin told me and VOILA! its perfect. you really do have to apply it to dry hair. i left it on for about 20-30 min and my whole entire hair especially my tips came out so much healthier. i didn&#x27;t add anything to it, i know you can apply olive oil it to like it says on the bottle but keep in mind that olive oil does lighten up your hair color. if you use it properly, you will really see results. i would definitely recommend it, but just like some other reviewers suggest don&#x27;t pay for than 10-12 bucks for this with taxes! you can find it at drugstores for 10 bucks.</li>
    <li> This made my hair really dry for some reason, even as a leave in. It made my daughter&#x27;s hair dry as well. I love the coconut hibiscus line, but this wasn&#x27;t for me. I&#x27;ll probably mix it with yogurt and other oils just to use it up.</li>
    <li> I purchase this product all of the time. At first, I used it as a deep conditioner. I was not impressed with it though. I had to find a way to make this product work for me. It has become a staple. This is best used as a moisturizer for my hair type and texture. I use it daily to moisturize my hair and it works wonders. I have also noticed that it aids in the detangle process. The point is... it cause the hair not to tangle up and so I don&#x27;t loose a lot of hair in the process. It has a peculiar odor but it is not too bad. I use about a quarter size amount on each section of hair and I section my hair into four or five sections. I highly recommend using this product as a moisturizer. It is worth the price because as a moisturizer it last about 3 to 4 months. As a deep conditioner it last about 3 good weeks it you hair thick coarse textured hair. It was not economical to use as a deep conditioner. I hope this review is able to help someone or give someone some ideas on how to use. ~ttfn.</li>
    <li> I have thin curly hair that tends to become frizzy and dry. I love the Shea moisture body products, and this smelled so good that it made me want to give it a try. I use two conditioners in the shower and then put this on as a leave in. It leaves my hair without an oily residue and gives it a fantastic smell. I think it&#x27;s made for any type of curly hair. Mine is thin and flowy with a lot of volume. I absolutely love it and I&#x27;ve been using it for about three months now and still have a lot of product left. A little goes a long way! Love Shea moisture!</li>
    <li> i have purchased this 3 times and its amazing i always use it as a pre poo treatment or combine it with a portion treatment for my hair while i was experiencing breakage from heat and after i took out my bantu knots. this product is very good to use on my 4b hair and it restores elasticity</li>
    <li> This product does not rinse out of my hair.  I&#x27;ve tried it 3-4 times (I only shampoo &amp; condition my hair twice per week) and every time my hair feels so weighed down.  It actually looks and feels so greasy I can&#x27;t even wear my hair down.  On a side note I paid $11.99 for mine at Target so it&#x27;s cheaper there if you want to give it a try.  Also have the Shea Moisture shampoo for dry damaged hair and that stuff smells and works great!</li>
    <li> I have used this product for about 2 years and believe it to be one of the best, if not the best, I&#x27;ve used. I was surprised to find such a great product in Walgreens and my only problem is choosing among the various varieties. I also apply it to my granddaughter&#x27;s hair and see a substantial improvement in her hair texture when applied. I never got the impression it was intended to be a rinse out conditioner and found it in the hair oil/cream section. I apply it on my wet hair before braiding and my hair dries soft and manageable ready for any styling I choose. I also apply it to my dry hair 2-3 times per week and it leaves my hair moist and supple. I like the smooth curl product too on twists when they start to get old. Still trying to understand the customer who said it knotted her hair up. Can&#x27;t see how that is possible hair if hair is combed before drying.</li>
    <li> I was actually hoping it would make my hair feel Moisturized...it did not at all.  Waste of money.  Loreal Mega Moisture from Sally Beauty Supply did the trick.</li>
    <li> I bought this as the Shea Moisture Smoothie did  my hair so well!&lt;br /&gt;I was sorely disappointed however as even whilst putting in the product, my hair did not feel soft, it had no slip and even though I left it in for about two hours, it did not leave my hair with the soft detangled feel that I expected from a product so expensive.  The next morning even thought I moisturised, my hair was dry and stiff!&lt;br /&gt;I should of read these reviews before buying...I will try it as a leave-in as some suggested and see what happens...&lt;br /&gt;I would not recommend this product, especially for this price...</li>
    <li> Leaves hair soft and moisturized.</li>
    <li> This stuff left my hair feeling like a broom! None of their other products have been like this, so I was very surprised after trying to deep condition my hair. My hair actually felt better before I used it, and while I usually don&#x27;t have a problem detangling my hair, this stuff made it impossible. My hair actually felt better after I shampooed this product out of my hair, and before conditioner, which I&#x27;m sure is not supposed to happen. There must be something off with this formula--I wish I had read the reviews before I tried it. Don&#x27;t buy this stuff!</li>
    <li> I have fine 3b hair and I use this product as an overnight deep conditioner. I usually use it on Day 2 or Day 3 hair after a Wash and Go. This product has an \\&quot;OK\\&quot; scent. I still haven&#x27;t decided if I like it or not. It&#x27;s a thicker cream texture and definitely clings to the hair. I usually wrap my hair into a bun at night, place a plastic shower cap on my head and then wrap that in a head rag to keep the plastic cap on over night. Rinse it out in the morning and place a leave-in styling cream in and hair gel. My hair feels wonderful and has beautiful defined curls when it dries. Good product. I&#x27;ll probably try some of the other products in the Shea Moisture line.</li>
    <li> I decided to write a review about this product because i simply think it is awful, and it must be shared. I have purchased this conditioner time and time again. I did this because it was always available at the drug store, and it claims to be an all restorative conditioner with a great ingredient list. I kept telling myself that even though this product had no slip at all and left my hair feeling drier than an old mop, that it was somehow good for the health of my hair given its restorative properties. Girls, guys... just don&#x27;t do it. It truly is a waste of your money. There are comparably priced products that will enhance your shower experience. i will NEVER spend another dime on this nonsense product. Let me just say however that I adore a lot of the other Shea Moisture products, but this one is just a mistake.</li>
    <li> I did not buy this product, someone had bought it, used it, didn&#x27;t like it, and gave it to me.  I have very dry hair and and even drier scalp.  I used it as a rinse-out conditioner the first time I used it, and then the 2nd time I tried it as a leave-in conditioner, following the directions on the jar.  It kind of worked on my hair and scalp.  My hair and scalp were both not as dry, but still nowhere near &amp;#34;normall&amp;#34;.  While I did not find the smell of the product offensive, my husband was not pleased with the smell.  Then I decided to try applying the conditioner before I washed my hair, leaving the product in my hair for about an hour before shampooing.  After, my ends finally felt soft and my scalp was not one big dry, itchy flake.  I then used the product as a pre-shampoo conditioner on my 8 year old daughter, who inherited her father&#x27;s middle-eastern thick, coarse, dry hair.  Her hair came out soft and less-tangle prone.  If you have this product, don&#x27;t give up right away if it doesn&#x27;t work on your hair, you may need to try different application methods before you find what works for your hair and scalp type.</li>
    <li> i like this line of products but i absolutely hate this product as a deep conditioner. i have relaxed hair and i was looking for a product for my weekly deep conditioning and since i have used the shampoo and other products and it was amazing i decided to try this product. i usually pre poo then shampoo and deep condition with this product and it would leave my hair very very very dry and tangle. waste of money</li>
    <li> Absolutely horrible. I am mixed and I was so excited to try this product but as soon as I put it in my hair, I could tell it didn&#x27;t penetrate. So, I added a little water and still nothing. It was like I was ripping my hair out with a wide tooth comb. Ridiculous!!! I love the sea moisture line but they need to work on there deep treatment products !!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I am a black Hispanic woman. Purchased this at Target for 9.99 (don&#x27;t overpay anywhere else!). I have fine, high density 3b-4a range hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell: The scent described by others is not horrible, nor overpowering. If you&#x27;ve smelled shea butter before, this does not deviate too far from it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Use: If you plan to use this to detangle exclusively, forget about it. It offers almost no slip (though I have admittedly not tried this with added coconut oil). However, the hydration this product adds to my hair is unbeatable for the price. I use just as suggested: I wash with a non-sulfate shampoo, deep condition in sections, no cap, for 15 minutes (I find any longer time unnecessary and overkill). Wash out with warm water then detangle with my regular conditioner and comb. Afterwards, when my hair dries, it&#x27;s sooo soft and stays hydrated, with no reapplication of any product, for up to a week or more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I noticed however, that when I washed my hair with cold water with the product on, it hardened. I think the oils and shea butter in this react better to warm water - if anyone wants to give this a second try after unsatisfactory results, use warm water instead!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some reviews have mentioned using this as a sealer or leave in. I tried this to twist my hair but it did not work with my texture. The result was hard and dry hair with flakes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In conclusion: unbeatable price for the volume of product and quality you receive. does all that is says. definitely a staple in my simple regime.</li>
    <li> This product was not love at first use. As many others have mentioned, I used it as a deep conditioner and that was a no go. I would recommend Shea Moisture Restorative masque, as that is a wonderful moisturizing deep conditioner. As a leave in though, the deep treatment masque is everything for my tightly coiled hair! I just love how moisturized and smooth it leaves it. Not to mention, slicking a little on your edges and putting on a silk/satin hair scarf lays my edges down better than most gels! I recommend using this on damp to dry hair for those with tighter curls... (For hair typers: 3b-4c)&lt;br /&gt;youtube.com/user/soleilkiss</li>
    <li> Yeah I purchased this dc because I wanted my hair to be softer and more moisturized. After using it over time I noticed a decrease in breakage in my hair but it didn&#x27;t really seem to make it soft. The scent is very strong, and that&#x27;s what I disliked about it the most. When I would put it in my hair I would constantly sneeze. Too strong and heavily scented for me. It&#x27;s an okay deep conditioner, not great. Since the consistency is thick and smooth it did last me a long time, especially since I tend to use A LOT more product than I should.</li>
    <li> I love this product, I found it at target. It really helps moisturize my natural hair. I use it everyday as a syling product and mu hair is soft all day. And it smells good like Cake Batter, lol anyways i am definitely going to go back to Target to buy the other Shea moisture line. But as for now I do recommend the deep treatment masque. :)</li>
    <li> When I tried this product I thought it would be just a typical conditioner. I washed my hair and then applied it, left it on for 30 minutes as the instructions suggested. To me my hair felt waxy after I rinsed it out so I washed my hair again, applied normal creme rinse and then proceeded to put rollers on and sit under the dryer. When I took my rollers off I was beside myself. The shine, bounce and softness was completely unexpected. My suggestion would be to apply this to wet hair and THEN wash. This product worked better than expected and I will be buying it again</li>
    <li> First, let me say, I did not like how my hair felt when I rinsed this out.  I rinsed and rinsed but, my hair still felt stiff and sticky, like it had a coating on it.  In fact, it felt so \\&quot;coated\\&quot;, I was dreading drying my hair, so, I also did a vinegar rinse and let it sit for 2 minutes trying to get this stuff out of my hair, because I didn&#x27;t feel like washing it again.&lt;br /&gt;Well!  Whadya know!!&lt;br /&gt;I blew my hair dry, and it is like SILK!  Oh people!  This conditioner is so good!  And NO split ends are visible.  Nada!  Honestly, I just can&#x27;t get over how slick &amp; silky my hair is.  LOVE this stuff!  I will use this again, but the next time I will try it as others have done, as a pre-poo treatment and see how it goes.&lt;br /&gt;What a pleasant surprise.  This mask IS amazing!&lt;br /&gt;Thumbs up!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT:&lt;br /&gt;I am so thrilled with the way my hair feels, I thought this might be helpful to others.&lt;br /&gt;3 Caveats:&lt;br /&gt;1-I bought this product from Target a few months ago and forgot I had it.&lt;br /&gt;2-I read all the bad reviews and feared \\&quot;dryness\\&quot;, so I sprayed Shea Moisture&#x27;s Reconstructive Finishing Elixir on top of the mask and let the whole thing \\&quot;set\\&quot; for 20 minutes w/ heat.&lt;br /&gt;3-After reading the bad reviews about \\&quot;matting\\&quot; and tangling, I sprayed Carol&#x27;s Daughter&#x27;s Anti-breakage spray thru-out my hair BEFORE the entire application to avoid tangling and breakage.&lt;br /&gt;I had no breakage and no matting or tangling.</li>
    <li> Smelt horrible, I did both the 5 minute treatment and the 30-45 minutes one. Not only did it not work it made my hair EVEN MORE DAMAGED! I&#x27;ve tried to redeem this product sooooo many times half the tub is gone and it has always gone bad, I&#x27;d have to wash my hair with my swim shampoo (btw I&#x27;m a swimmer with 3b hair and highlights in my hair) twice just to get my hair back to normal. My scalp is naturally oiled but my hair is dry I never applied this to my scalp but SOMEHOW I could almost feel the oil swirling around my head. My sister with 4b hair hated it as well clumbs stayed in her afro even after washing it. DO NOT BUY! It&#x27;s expensive and crappy overall,</li>
    <li> This did nothing for my 3B multicultural hair. It felt dry and not soft or silky. The sulfate-free line from loreal does a way better job on my hair.</li>
    <li> My hair is very dry after shampooing. I use Shea moisture products on my hair and body. The soaps especially black soap on my face. The hair line, goes by color. The brown packaging is for dry hair, The Pink is for curly, to help define and hold curls. The green for thin breaking hair. I use the brown package and the pink packages. Now, like a previous person stated DO NOT BUY THIS FOR MORE THAN $10. The website is under construction so you cannot purchase it there at the moment. Yet target and Walgreen&#x27;s carry all of Shea Moisturizes products including the baby products, which I use as well on my hair and skin.   I have natural hair. So What I do is, wash my hair with this green tea and mint organic shampoo from Trader Joe&#x27;s, Which is about $3. I dont want to use Shea Moisturizes shampoos, for $10, the one i have works excellent, Its the moisturizers I splurge on. My hair doesn&#x27;t get real dirty with dandruff, in fact when I wash its not because I feel its dirty, its to refresh and re moisturize.  I wash out the shampoo, then add in the moisturizer from the brown bottle, the one with the pump. Then I towel dry my hair. Then I take the reconstructing elixir in the brown bottle, Spray it all over my hair and rub it in with my fingers, its an oil. Then I take a comb part my hair in little boxes, dip my fingers into the hair masque, and two strand twist it. I do this all over my hair while it is still damp. Then when I am dont I blow dry my hair, just to soak up any wetness. And I spray a bit more elixir, and put this masque in my scalp, lightly. Next day, I wake up , untwist my hair and I am all set to go!!</li>
    <li> This masque  is amazing! I use it as a pre-shampoo treatment. I add coconut oil and olive oil. Leave for an hour, rinse out and shampoo with the Shea moisture thickening shampoo. Then I deep condition with the restorative conditioner. My hair feels so healthy with minimal breakage.</li>
    <li> I wanted to love this product. It smells great and the description on the label promises so many amazing things! It just didn&#x27;t live up to the hype for me. Still, it&#x27;s not bad at all. It does condition more than my regular rinse outs, but on its own it&#x27;s not really a DEEP conditioner. For a real deep conditioning treatment, I boost it up with olive oil and leave it on for 30 minutes. I also like to mix it with [[ASIN:B003YELGF2 Organic Root Stimulator Hair Mayonnaise Treatment, 20 Ounce]] to do a protein treatment. It works fairly well as a twisting butter but again, nothing amazing. It&#x27;s not bad enough to throw out, but I won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
    <li> It did not work for me at all, I have 4a hair and am suffering from breakage on my hair and the shea moisture deep conditioners even felt to thick on my fingers at first. I tried it on my hair and it felt like my hair was breaking just by putting this thick pomade on my hair. I left it in for about 1 hour and In the end my hair just felt super dry and crispy.</li>
    <li> I love this masque!! It leaves my hair feeling so good and soft. I have AA hair type 3c-4a hair. I use it as a DC. I mix it with olive oil and honey and it gives me so much slip and moisture.</li>
    <li> This product work great on me and my daughter&#x27;s natural hair . It moisturizes our hair and makes it very manageable. We are very pleased with this product.</li>
    <li> I am a white woman with straight, fine, blonde hair who dyes portions of it with different colored dyes. My undyed hair is usually very healthy. The dyed hair does require extra moisture treatments, though that&#x27;s not why I use and like this product. I preface my review with this because I know that if you don&#x27;t have hair like mine, my review may be of no help to you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For about a decade, I have been dyeing a portion of my hair dark red. Red is a difficult dye to maintain. You have to leave chemical dyes in for a long time to get a bold color, and it fades pretty easily. I had flirted with using Kool Aid dye (like so many middle and high school students before me), but I really didn&#x27;t like how it turned out. A few years and a lot of damage to my hair later, I decided to revisit the Kool Aid method. Turns out, I had messed up a lot of things like not using a mix of colors to get the right shade, not leaving it on long enough, and most importantly, not using the right delivery method, specifically, conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once I started using the drink mix, I just used whatever conditioner I had in my shower, and I had varied results. Good enough that I was happy with the new method (my hair was certainly happier not being shredded with chemicals numerous times a year), but some dye jobs turned out much better than others. In retrospect, I realize this was because of the conditioner I used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enter Shea Moisture Deep Treatment Hair Masque. A friend had bought a tub for herself but found it too heavy for her hair. She offered it to me, and I thought, sure, probably too much for my fine hair, too, but I can use it as a dye base. It has been the absolute best Kool Aid hair dye delivery conditioner. Some conditioners break down when mixed with the drink mix, but this maintains its creamy consistency. That is especially good because it makes it less likely to dry out in the 6-8 hours you have to leave it on your hair, and it&#x27;s less prone to dripping all over the place and making a mess. When I finally rinse it out, my hair feels soft. (I usually follow up with a little lighter conditioner after the rinse, but even wet in the shower, I can tell how much softer my hair is when I&#x27;ve used this as the base as compared to other conditioners.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The color also comes out much better with this masque as the base. When I ran out of the tub my friend gave me, I briefly went back to using random other conditioners. Mistake. Three days after a really crappy dye job courtesy of whatever conditioner I had in my shower, I went and bought two tubs of this. Dye was reapplied and looks as great as ever again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t say how good it is as a moisture treatment, but if you dye your hair with drink mix or food coloring, it will leave you with bold color and soft, healthy feeling hair. As long as I keep dying my hair accordingly, I&#x27;m going to keep using this masque.ver the place and making a mess. When I finally rinse it out, my hair feels soft. (I usually follow up with a little lighter conditioner after the rinse, but even wet in the shower, I can tell how much softer my hair is when I&#x27;ve used this as the base as compared to other conditioners.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The color also comes out much better with this masque as the base. When I ran out of the tub my friend gave me, I briefly went back to using random other conditioners. Mistake. Three days after a really crappy dye job courtesy of whatever conditioner I had in my shower, I went and bought two tubs of this. Dye was reapplied and looks as great as ever again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t say how good it is as a moisture treatment, but if you dye your hair with drink mix or food coloring, it will leave you with bold color and soft, healthy feeling hair. As long as I keep dying my hair accordingly, I&#x27;m going to keep using this masque.</li>
    <li> I love the bar soap, I love the raw shea butter moisturizer, and I really wanted to love this masque. However, this product didn&#x27;t do anything for. I have very long chemically treated hair. I would use literal handfuls of this stuff in my hair and let it sit. After using this masque my hair feels dry an &amp;#34;straw like&amp;#34;. Worse than after my shampoo. I always need to put in a leave in treatment because it does nothing to de-tangle. This mask may work for some people, but for me it was a real disappointment.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m African-American with thick relaxed hair and it&#x27;s extremely dry hair. I work out a lot and have color so the regular products I used weren&#x27;t as effective (Panitene, Carson, Fruitus Gartiner). My friend is all natural, so I decided to try out this deep treatment as my first foray into natural products.    First I want to say that I also use the Restorative Deep Conditioner, which I bought first. I don&#x27;t recommend buying both of these products because they are very similar. However, I do love the Masque. After I used it as a deep conditioner wash out, my hair was sooo soft and smooth. I would say that a little goes a long way, especially with the combination of water. I was lathering the product on because that&#x27;s what I&#x27;m used to. The moisture stayed in my hair for days instead of hours. I noticed the difference immediately when I blow-dried my hair.    I would not put this product on dry hair, it works best with wet hair. I haven&#x27;t tried it as a leave-in on wet then blow-dried hair, yet but when I do I&#x27;ll update my review. I use the Restorative Deep Conditioner as my leave-in for dry hair and it does wonders, I also loved it so much I went out and bought the Shea Moisture Hibiscus Hold &amp; Shine Moisture Mist. Love the Masque and Restorative Conditioner too pieces. I&#x27;m not natural so I don&#x27;t know if that made a huge difference. I do know that some complain about the product not working for their natural hair. For my relaxed and colored  hair it works wonders.    Update: I didn&#x27;t have any style/hold products. I noticed one of the descriptions on the Masque tub is for a styling product. It did great as expected. My &#x27;do held all day and when I wrapped my hair at night it shaked out into style the next day. So far I can use this as a deep treatment conditioner, a leave-in conditioner, and a styling product. So it&#x27;s def worth the price.    9/13/2014 Update:  I wanted to update my review because I have a completely different opinion of the product now. I no longer have relaxed hair and as a naturalista, this product does not work for my hair. I&#x27;m 4a, no hair damage, with think fine strands. Due to the fine nature of my hair this product is too heavy. It works, my hair is soft, but it suffocates my coils leaving me with non-existent coils or definition. I still think the product is good but it no longer works for what I want.</li>
    <li> this conditioner does a nice job conditioning my hair and getting it soft. i have 3c/4a hair.</li>
    <li> The most amazing conditioner I have ever used. I am in love. After I rinsed the product out my hair felt dry and unmoisturized but once it started to dry my hair felt like silk. Once I flat ironed my hair felt like silk. I have never had a conditioner make my hair feel so good. Definitely a new customer</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t get past the smell and don&#x27;t want to use it again because my hair smelled all day.</li>
    <li> I have really kinky and coarse hair and for the longest time, I was suffering from really dry hair. I had my hair in braids as a protective style for two months and I didn&#x27;t take care of it or moisturize it as I should have. I was looking for something to really bring moisture back my hair and this did the trick! I used it as a deep conditioner once a week when I washed my hair and I loved how soft and moisturized my hair felt after each wash. Would definitely recommend this product to anyone trying to lock moisture into their hair!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m AA with Natural 4a type hair. I purchased this product to try as a leave in as most of the reviews say it works better that way so I whipped up a small batch of \\&quot;Kimmytube\\&quot; recipe and swapped the masque in place of my regular conditioner and I must say that I like this mix with the DT masque and I like it even better with the Organic Yucca &amp; Baobab Anti-Breakage Masque so I will use up both products until finish but will purchase only the Yucca one next time...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can mix and match whatever oils you want but this is the mix I use:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1 ounce- Shea Mositure Hair Masque&lt;br /&gt;2 tablespoons - Whole leaf  Aloe Vera Juice&lt;br /&gt;2 teaspoons - EVOO (extra virgin olive oil)&lt;br /&gt;1 teaspoon - Black castor oil&lt;br /&gt;1 teaspoon - Tea tree oil&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**ONE LAST THING**  This item can be found in Target, Duane Reade, Walmart or Walgreens for $10 or less!</li>
    <li> For starters, I only paid $9.99 for this same product at my local Walgreen&#x27;s. It is not good to use as a rinse out conditioner, and is slightly oily as a leave-in. However, these are not the reasons I gave this product two stars......the scent is the reason I gave it a two-star rating because it is waaay to overwhelming and gives me headaches!</li>
    <li> Shea Moisture Organic Raw Shea Butter Deep Treatment Hair Masque does a great job at reviving my hair after washing it.  Great scent and not too thick.  Have also been able to use while styling my hair as well.</li>
    <li> I am amazed at how well this product worked for me. Since I began coloring my hair a few months ago, it has been cottony, lifeless and dry looking, with no shine. And nothing helped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used the Shea Moisture masque and have gotten so many spontaneous comments from friends and family that my hair looks shiny and natural again. I am a fan, and will be using this product the rest of my life!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the record, I have fairly straight dark blonde hair with a just a bit of curl.</li>
    <li> First of all, let me give you a quick description of my hair. I&#x27;m Caucasian. My hair has been colored multiple times. I just went from bright blond to brunette. I&#x27;ve also used a hair dryer and a curling iron on a regular basis often neglecting thermal protection. That resulted in a LOT of damage and lately I&#x27;ve been trying to cut down on heat styling. Finally, over the last several months my hair went through a major hair-fall due to stress. Ok, you get the picture....Over the last couple of months I&#x27;ve been trying to bring my hair back to life. I was able to stop my hair-fall with a combination of vitamins (hair, skin and nails) and a variety of plant and essential oils (coconut, argan, lavender, peppermint, lemon, Jamaican black castor, amla, bay, etc...the list is long). I like using oils on my hair but they were still not moisturizing enough and my hair felt coarse. Plus applying dripping oil is tough. I decided I needed a masque to use as a base for my oil treatments. My requirements were reasonable price and more or less natural list of ingredients. This masque (I bought it at my local W-mart) met those requirements. My oils mixed in very well and the final texture was like homemade whip cream. It was easy to apply to my hair with a coloring brush. I applied to dry, unwashed hair, put a plastic shower cap on and a fabric turban to retain heat. I left it in for a couple of hours and rinsed with warm water. After rinsing, I&#x27;ve used As I Am co-wash conditioner to make sure I don&#x27;t end up with oil residue. My hair feels very soft and looks shiny. Some mentioned a major hair-fall after this treatment. I&#x27;ve lost about 5-10 strand in the shower and then about 10-15 during brushing, After loosing 100+ during brushing at the peak of my hair-fall, I think this loss is normal. To wrap it up, I must say that from my experience there is no single magical treatment or product. You have to find concoctions that work for your individual needs. Figure out what your hair likesand treat it :). Overall, I really liked this product but took 1 star off because I do need multiple additional products to enhance it. Hope my review was helpful to you.</li>
    <li> I have SUPER thick, course frizzy redhead (Caucasian) hair, and this product is awesome as a leave-in frizz control product. I use very little of the product and it makes my hair go from fied-looking to healthy in a single application. One tub will probably last me a year. I was not impressed with it as a was-out conditioner.    I wanted to write this review because it is sold in stores in the ethnic hair-product section, but works very well on my caucasian hair.</li>
    <li> Not really impressed - also the smell is strange; Biolage deep moisture treatment is my go-to and I&#x27;ll stick with it.</li>
    <li> Im African American who has struggled with finding a proper moisterizing hair cream. Im big on the health of my hair and body an The ones I&#x27;ve found seemed to work well after I applied alot. Although looking at the ingredients I noticed I was doing more harm them good, the moisture I THOUGHT I was feeling was just on the outside of my strands, in other words It did not penetrate my hair as it stated it would. So I started using Extra virgin coconut oil (which is said to be the only oil that penetrates the hair) I like it alot but my hair (being curly) favors a creamy texture. So I was at Walgreens looking for something better and found this AMAZING ORGANIC cream.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;****You cant trust everything that says organic got to read the ingredients  this product states \\&quot;No parabens, phthalates, paraffin, gluten, propylebe, no mineral oil, synthetic fragrance, NO ANIMAL TESTING ;), PABA, synthetic color, no DEA, animal ingredients, no sulfates!****&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I thought why not...I puchased this for $11 from walgreens and used it....ok let me make this clear it works but if your not taking care of your hair you might see different results. make sure your hair is clean and well conditioned with a deep conditioner after shampoo prior. Its important to understand what your hair needs and beware certain products BLOCK OUT MOISTURE. Dont shampoo unless hair is dirty sometimes you may just need a co wash. Some shampoos strip the hair of its natural oils because of the detergent in it. YES detergent is in alot of shampoos if you did not know. THATS WHY I LOVE THIS ORGANIC PRODUCT. YOU CANT GO WRONG :).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;RESULTS---&gt; Soft hair that smells good and that feels, look and is healthy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***TIPS: for black hair,,,Nothing can make you hair grow! All hair grows! Its all about stoping the breakage to be able to see all your growth. you stop the breakage by keeping your hair moisturized from the inside out. MAKE SURE YOUR ENDS R EXTRA MOISTURIZED BECAUSE WHEN YOU ENDS GET DRY AND BREAK OFF THATS WHEN IT LOOKS LIKE YOU HAIR IS NOT GROWING. This product does the trick. Every hair type is different, if your hair feels dry thats when you put more. you know your hair is dry when you hear a sound when you touch it***&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ALL NATURAL HAIR NO PERM/RELAXER...USES ON MY TWO BOYS HAIR ALSO (ONE HAS A HAIR CUT AN ONE HAS CURLY MIXED RACE TEXTURED HAIR) ...I LEARNED ALL THIS FROM TONZ OF GOOGLE RESEARCH LOL...HOPE THIS HELPST LOOKS LIKE YOU HAIR IS NOT GROWING. This product does the trick. Every hair type is different, if your hair feels dry thats when you put more. you know your hair is dry when you hear a sound when you touch it***  ALL NATURAL HAIR NO PERM/RELAXER...USES ON MY TWO BOYS HAIR ALSO (ONE HAS A HAIR CUT AN ONE HAS CURLY MIXED RACE TEXTURED HAIR) ...I LEARNED ALL THIS FROM TONZ OF GOOGLE RESEARCH LOL...HOPE THIS HELPS</li>
    <li> After reading the ingredients, I couldn&#x27;t wait to try this product. I have kinky-coily (type 4a) hair and I thought this product would be very moisturizing. Boy, I was wrong. This products left my hair dry and tangled! My hair felt completely stripped of moisture. I was disappointed but I know that every hair product does not work for every head of hair.</li>
    <li> After reading the great reviews I decided to spend the money and invest in trying the Shea Moisture Raw Butter Line of Products.  It’s only been a week and I know it may be too soon but I don’t see any great results so far. My hair actually feels drier. The Deep Treatment Masque didn’t moisturize or make my hair silky soft like I expected after doing a conditioning treatment and I didn’t see any good results. The shampoo smells great but the conditioner doesn’t seem to soften or detangle hair. After I run out of this I don’t think I will re-buy this line of products. I am Spanish and have textured hair and it didn’t work for me sadly after spending all that money.</li>
    <li> I have naturally curly, long, highlighted hair. When buying this product I was looking for something that was going to add moisture back into my hair and also help with detangling. I can say that after brushing through the terrible knots and letting it air dry my hair felt softer but it was so dang frizzy. I lathered this stuff all over my hair and tried to run a comb through it in the shower it wasn&#x27;t happening, so I thought I would try after I let it sit for 30 min. or so, I even took a warm damp microfiber towel and wrapped my hair up with it and then put a shower cap on. After 30 min. still no luck, washed it out and it felt like there was a greasy residue left on my hair. First time trying the Shea Moisture products and I wasn&#x27;t pleased, which makes me sad because so many people rave about it.</li>
    <li> Ethnicity: Hispanic&lt;br /&gt;Skin: Pale&lt;br /&gt;Hair: Normal, dry scalp, dyed hair&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DO NOT USE IF YOU ARE A FAUX REDHEAD! Okay I had high hopes for this, all natural, great ingredients, deep treatment masque. Why I didn&#x27;t like it;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.) It was like mayonnaise,but not. Kinda hard to put on as it didn&#x27;t really &amp;#34;glide&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;2.) I left it for half an hour and rinsed in lukewarm water, as the suds are coming down i see them a slight pink. The color is BLEEDING out of my freshly(3 days ago) dyed hair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I proceed to just rinse it all out and get it over with. and was undoubtedly freaking the F*** out!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3.) After rinse out it felt harsh, kind of like I didn&#x27;t use ANY conditioner after all!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now to the after. It was wet and heavy and was taking forever to dry. And it was feeling kind of crispy(?) so i took my handy wet brush and blow dried my hair. It was a complete &amp;#34;meh&amp;#34;. My hair was not any more soft, smooth, or healthier as it would be just using my regular conditioner. All in all I will not be using this product again for fear of wasting money on dying my hair every week.</li>
    <li> I add olive oil to a huge dollop of this and mix together.  I leave the masque on overnight and rinse in the morning.  In the shower with my hair soaking wet, I add my leave in conditioners.  I don&#x27;t wring my hair or dry it with a towel.  I pin it up at the crow to give my hair some height and I dry with a diffuser.  Beautiful, silky curls (almost) every time.</li>
    <li> My hair dresser told me to get a $50 Shea butter mask, as this ingredient is the best product there is to repair hair, and a mask is the only way that works she said. This ingredient is super expensive bc it is difficult to extract.. This is the same as an expensive one and feeds your hair beautifully. Make sure you rinse well and choose a day where you won&#x27;t mind having any volume, especially if you have thin/thinner hair (have a bun or ponytail day) because you are just getting so much moisture, and nourishing repair and it might weigh you hair down which is okay for one or 2 days a week. I sometimes even sleep with it for intense repair.</li>
    <li> I made my purchase from Target @ 9.99.  Later found it at Wal-Mart (the same day) for 7.96.  The product did not work well for me as a DC, but it does a wonderful job as a leave-in.  I added some Argan oil, and my other secret ingredient and it does the job wonderfully.  As long as I can get the product on the ground, and have to make changes to the consistency....to make it work as a leave-in...I&#x27;m cool.  For 7.96 for 12 ounces...you get your monies worth.  I&#x27;m a AA, and menopausal...which means....dry, dry, dry hair.  I have to co-wash, and I absolutely need a leave-in.  I never did before.  I have combination hair on different sections of my head...believe it or not.  I have 3c, 4a, 4b, and 4c hair, and the thickness will flexuate depending on my hormones, or estrogen levels.  Since my hair tends to be on the thin side I have to thin down the mask.  But, I am pleased that I have found a product that works with a little tweaking, because I am just not going to spend all the money for the ingredients and the time, nor the shipping to have items sent to my home.  I hope this is helpful to someone else that maybe having the same issues as myself.</li>
    <li> This is the first time I have ever review a product so here goes....I really wanted to love this product, I really did but I just could not get with it. After washing my hair with the Shea Moisture Black Soap Shampoo (which i love) I left the masque on for about 8 mins to restore some moisture to my hair which it did somewhat, then after I rinsed, I used as an overnight deep conditioner. I expected to rinse it of the next morning and my hair to feel soft and moisturized but unfortunately, it did absolutely nothing. My hair was still very dry so I thought ok, maybe I should try it as a leave-in. I sprayed my hair with some homeade spritz (which usually is enough moisture for me) and decided to use the masque as a sealer. What it did was the exact oposite and it sucked up all of the moisture from my hair once it dried and left it like straw, hard, and weighed down. I was so dissapointed. I even mixed in more raw shea butter to make it more moisturizing and more sealant proof but that didnt work either. I do better using shea butter by itself. All in all I was very dissapointed with this product after having such high hopes thinking my hair would respond different than other negative reviews but that wasnt the case. Oh well, trial and error...</li>
    <li> First of all, this costs a fraction of what they have listed on amazon if you go to Walgreens. At my Walgreens it costs $10.99.  I have been looking for a line of products that can control my Jew Fro. I&#x27;m Jewish so I can call it that :) I use this stuff after I&#x27;ve squeezed the excess water out of my hair and scrunch it in- probably about a Tbsp - then I use their other product [[ASIN:B0038TYTSO Shea Moisture Coconut &amp; Hibiscus Curl &amp; Style Conditioning Milk - 8 oz.]] which smells really good if you ask me. My hair looks amazing! It&#x27;s shiny and soft and what I love the most is you can use this product for days when you don&#x27;t wash your hair. I spray my head with a spray bottle of water and then add more of this \\&quot;masque\\&quot; and it brings my hair back to life. But remember, buy it at Walgreens not Amazon.</li>
    <li> My type 3C-4A graying, color treated, coily curls are 8 months into transition from a relaxer. This is the first treatment that smoothed and softened the new growth and minimized the deep transition line between relaxed and natural hair. I applied this in layers to dry hair, covered with plastic cap and a warm cloth cap for 30 minutes. I followed up with a warm water rinse, shampoo, conditioner and used the Shea Moisture Masque lightly for twists. The next day I spritzed my hair with water only to set Bantu Knots and could not believe how silky-soft my hair is. Will continue to use as my deep conditioner as I am pleased with the results.</li>
    <li> I bought this product because of the natural ingredients, thinking  it would be good for my natural hair.  It was not.  The first time I tried this deep treatment masque, it left my hair stiff and dry.  I tried it again, this time adding a teaspoon or two of extra virgin olive oil, it was still a NO go.  My hair never felt so dry and brittle.  I managed to rescue my hair by adding extra leave in conditioner (Giovanni Direct Leave-In) before I started my twist out.  I would never by this product again.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if it is my hair that is reacting with it, but I give up on this product!  I have natural think curly hair, color treated.  I don&#x27;t see what type of DEEP TREATMENT any person would get out of this.  Putting it on my hair, I don&#x27;t feel that it soaks in or softens the hair.  I would much prefer the Brazilian Blowout Mask any day over this. I took a chance on this product because it was cheaper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From using it in the shower, to rinsing it out and then styling - it ultimately made my hair feel like straw!  Maybe it&#x27;s protein sensitivity like someone else mentioned on here. NOT FOR ME.</li>
    <li> Leaves my hair soooo soft. Never thought my hair could feel this way. I reach for this everyyyday. It does not have much slip I must admit so I was reallly doubting this product. BUT it fooled me big time lol. I twist with this, wash with this, everyyything. I dnt blow dry with this because it will leave my hair dull. But I do apply it once im done blow drying.. ladies with 4c hair this is a must have ! My hair feels like a cotton ball. I found this is my local walgreens as well</li>
    <li> I use and like this product, although I read early on that it was kind of a fail as a conditioner and actually a good daily moisturizer on dry hair, which is how I use it and I like the results.&lt;br /&gt;However, I do not know why anyone would pay the prices listed here on Amazon unless they lived someplace that didn&#x27;t have the product on store shelves.&lt;br /&gt;As many have mentioned, this product is usually available in Target, Walgreen&#x27;s, CVS, and many other drug stores and beauty supply stores, and the highest price I&#x27;ve seen is about $10, and in other parts of the country, it can be cheaper.&lt;br /&gt;I realize Amazon doesn&#x27;t stock this item themselves, but it would seem as if they&#x27;d have a policy about price gouging on the part of the people who sell on the site.&lt;br /&gt;Simply good, use this product as a moisturizer on dry hair, not as a conditioner/deep-conditioner, and don&#x27;t pay anyone $12-$20 for it, b/c that is a huge rip off.</li>
    <li> I used this product for the first time and I feel the results were fabulous!!  Hair is soft and looks and feels really moisturized!  I am afro american with kinky hair that  has a perm that is transitioning ( about 2 months ).  I co-washed my hair and then put shea moisture deep masque on for about 35 minutes.  I sat under hooded dryer for about 10 minutes and then rinsed out.  I could feel and see the difference immediately!  I&#x27;m also using as a leave in for manageability.  Smells wonderful and is not greasy.  Love product</li>
    <li> Im transitioning and I read great reviews about this maque.  Unfortunately, it made my hair feel dry and rough to comb through. I tried ths as a rinse out and leave in...no difference.  If anyone knows of a great product for transitioning hair, please let me know. I gave it 2 stars for the fragrance. It smells wonderful.</li>
    <li> I am the ultimate product junkie.I have 3 tubs of conditioners, gels, mousses and shampoos in my bathroom including Wen, Pantene, Cantu, Herbal Essence, Organix, Mane and Tail, Aphogee, Ion, and NONE COMPARE TO THIS LINE.  I have long thick coarse curls and I have every single conditioner out there. This one changes you hair from first application. Ive been using it about a month and my hair is soooooo much more healthier and smooth. My hair is transformed. I want this forever and if I ever have kids... they will use this stuff too. LOVE</li>
    <li> I have coarse, thick, natural, shoulder length hair, that happens to be very manageable.  I also  have an affintity for natural hair care products, geared towards women of color.  I used this product a few times and noticed my hair wasn&#x27;t feeling very moisturized afterwards; In fact, it felt a little dry. I assumed I hadn&#x27;t given it enough time to work (as with any new product).&lt;br /&gt;Upon my last application, it tangled a large quarter of my hair into a MATTED KNOT!  I freaked and I tried everything to release the knot, olive oil, conditioner, detangler, you name it and to no avail.  This product should be taken off of the market ASAP!!!  If you want to lose your hair or worse have to cut it out yourself, then by all means take the gamble.  Not every new product marketed towards African American hair types, is good for it.  I know now that this isn&#x27;t one of them. Don&#x27;t buy this product, your hair will thank you!</li>
    <li> Along with this brand&#x27;s moisturizing shampoo, this masque leaves my hair very soft and shiny.  I tried it because I&#x27;m always looking for something to make my frequently colored short hair look undamaged.  This is all that and more.  Lots of shine and softness, all natural, great smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best conditioning product I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
    <li> I am a big fan of Shea Moisture products and I LOVE the shea butter restorative conditioner so I had been eyeing the Raw Shea Butter Deep Treatment Hair Masque for a long time. I finally purchased it a few months ago at Wal-Mart for about 12 bucks. Here is my experience with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first time I used it, I applied it to freshly washed and conditioned hair and left it on for the 5 minutes that it instructed me to in the instructions. I hated it. It left my hair feeling worse than it did before I applied it. But I am not one for wasting products, so I was not about to give up that easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The next few times I used it, I mixed some of the masque with olive oil, as suggested in the instructions also. It made my hair feel a little better, but still not what I wanted from this product. I was not sold. Eventually I went back to using my olive oil replenishing conditioner. It&#x27;s full of yucky ingredients but it got the job done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fast forward to present day &amp; I have gone back to an all natural hair regimen and I was using an all natural deep conditioner. It was working, but I still wasn&#x27;t getting the results I wanted from it. I decided that I was going to revisit the deep treatment masque since I was still holding on to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This time after co-washing, I mixed some of the masque, about a tablespoon of coconut oil and olive oil and put it all on my hair with a plastic cap &amp; left it on for 30 minutes......&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;MAGIC! This is the first time since I have been using an all natural deep conditioner that I have gotten the results that I wanted from it. My hair was soft, shiny, &amp; moisturized. It didn&#x27;t leave my hair with an oily feel just thoroughly conditioned and manageable. I had to add that in there because when I used the masque alone it, my hair felt kind of matted and I do not have a tight curl pattern (3c) so I never have any MAJOR problems with tangling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is not going to be for everyone. Everyone&#x27;s hair responds differently to products and honestly I had given up on this one. My advice would be to play around with it a bit using your favorite oil or mix it with your favorite moisturizing rinse out conditioner. I have not tried this as a leave-in and probably won&#x27;t because I use the restorative conditioner for that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is going to be my staple deep conditioner for a long time.differently to products and honestly I had given up on this one. My advice would be to play around with it a bit using your favorite oil or mix it with your favorite moisturizing rinse out conditioner. I have not tried this as a leave-in and probably won&#x27;t because I use the restorative conditioner for that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is going to be my staple deep conditioner for a long time.</li>
    <li> I expected my hair to feel very soft, moisturized, and to have less tangles after using this product.  This wasn&#x27;t the case for me.  My hair felt like a film was left on it, my hair tangled more than with other products I&#x27;ve used and I even had to trim my ends due to breakage that occurred as a result of the tangling.  I don&#x27;t care for the smell which has a &amp;#34;mud&amp;#34; smell to it.  Lastly, I think the item would be more user-friendly if it came in a squeeze bottle - trying to place the conditioner on my wet hair from the tub when I&#x27;m in the shower is messy, incovenient, and time consuming.</li>
    <li> I read the range of reviews before trying this. It really did not work for my curly, dry hair. It took me two or three days to re-moisturize my hair after using this twice. The ingredients look good, but, for some reason, this did not work for me. I do like their other products a lot. So, this is baffling.</li>
    <li> Not a good product for conditioning even though it says it has shea butter. It made my hair tangled and matted. I did use it as a shave cream with sucess. They do have another product I reviewed that is good. Watch the prices though.</li>
    <li> They make the best products for natural hair.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using only chagrin valley shampoo bars + ACV rinse + coconut oil once a week for over a year and and due to my hair growing I needed to start using a natural conditioner for my ends. I tried all the natural stuff and none of them were good. I started using organix conditioners but wasn&#x27;t happy that it wasn&#x27;t so natural. this is the best and closet to a natural conditioner I&#x27;ve found. I&#x27;m also white with thick straight hair. just thought I&#x27;d mention that since I found this product in the &amp;#34;ethnic&amp;#34; isle at wal-mart. I love it.</li>
    <li> I am a black woman with chemical-free hair. Since black hair is prone to drying, I needed a product that would help retain moisture. The Shea Moisture Deep Treatment Masque does that. I have not and do not plan on using it as a deep conditioner or rinse-out product. I use it as a moisturizing styling aid. On freshly washed and detangled hair, I separate my hair in sections, seal each section with grapeseed oil or any essential oil and apply the product by combing it through my hair with my fingers, making sure to saturate the ends. My curls are defined and my hair is moisturized for about three days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love this stuff. I don&#x27;t know why it&#x27;s so expensive on Amazon but it&#x27;s great stuff!</li>
    <li> I had to write a review because this product gave me the worst reaction to a beauty product that I&#x27;ve ever had.  I bought it on sale at Target... so I know it was the real thing because I purchased it at a reputable source.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I literally used it twice.  Two times.  You would think that would not be enough to give someone who has lived long with beautiful clear skin the worst acne they have ever had in their life.  Wrong.  After using this product two times (once per day, after getting out of the shower...the first time, I left it in as a leave-in conditioner, the second time, I rinsed it out after a few minutes), I had 6 or 7 huge zits on the sides of my face right under where my hair falls and nowhere else.  Those zits were painful, deep, and it took over 6 months of diligently cleansing my face daily to finally eradicate them.  I now have huge pores where the zits used to be, and the rest of my face still looks poreless.  I can&#x27;t even believe that happened.  It was horrible.  I had to throw this review on here because it is literally the worst experience with ANY product that I&#x27;ve ever had.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit:  Just wanted to say it&#x27;s been over a year since I wrote the review and I still stand by what I said, in spite of what appears to be three people who&#x27;ve marked this as unhelpful.  My skin still has never had the kind of acne I had after using this product in my hair (not even close...I haven&#x27;t even had any acne since other than a tiny redspot, 1/8th of the size of one of the zits I got while using this product, every once in a great while), and I&#x27;d changed nothing in my routine at the time of use other than Shea Moisture.  I could be intolerant to an ingredient, but I&#x27;m still amazed to this day.  Also to this day, I still have small red areas beneath my hair line in the very spots where I put this product in my hair.  They never erupt back into acne, but I know it&#x27;s the Shea Moisture because I only have the acne on the side of my face where the Shea moisture was used.  I&#x27;m sorry to disappoint those who like the product, but it is what it is.</li>
    <li> got this masque at meijer. I was excited as I have used the shampoo which I liked. My hair is a mixture of wavy curly hair  which is manageable in winter and frizzy in summertime. Due to the extreme winter, at the moment my hair is dry. This masque did not help and worsened the dry condition. The texture when applied is hard wax like and after I rinsed it out of my hair, made my hair tangly and hard. I would not recommend this product to anybody and at $9.99 expensive.</li>
    <li> I really like how my hair feels after using this product. My hair feels very soft and silky after rinsing. You have a satisfied first time purchaser.</li>
    <li> Bought this for $10 at Target and it works great!&lt;br /&gt;Was looking for something all natural. All the hot oil treatments were full of too many chemicals (perfume, alcohol, which is bad for your hair)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think the bad reviews are because people are putting it on wet hair, not rinsing it out all the way, or putting it on their roots.&lt;br /&gt;NEVER put leave in treatments on your roots!! It will make your roots very greasy. Leave in treatments are for your ends. Never put them higher than your ears.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Use on CLEAN, DRY hair. let sit for 30 minutes in a shower cap. Then rinse. done. Also is great as a leave in conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;IF you use it on your roots you are going to have to shampoo and condition after or its going to be greasy/oily.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately, this product did not work well as a deep conditioner for my relaxed hair.  I sat under a dryer for 30 minutes and, after rinsing, was devastated to find that my hair had neither the softness nor the slip that I desire.  I even mixed some coconut oil with it on my second try, but still got poor results.  I used it on my daughter&#x27;s natural hair and she got some moisture, but it was not notable.  I will not be purchasing this product again.  Disappointed that this was my first Shea Moisture product.  I keep hearing great things about the Shine &amp; Hold Mist and the Curling Smoothie, so I may give them a try (but I will be purchasing from a CVS or Target because these products are OVERPRICED on Amazon - you can get them for $9.99 each).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE (December 16, 2013):  Since my review above, I saw a YouTube video that suggests using this product on natural hair as the cream part of the LOC (liquid-oil-cream) moisturizing process.  I tried this on my daughter&#x27;s natural hair as a leave-in cream and liked it.  I still am not sure if I will purchase it again, but am glad I found a better use for it than the deep conditioner use.</li>
    <li> This is the absolute worst product I have ever used on my hair. I love the shea moisture shampoos so tried the deep treatment masque expecting to have great results as well. When used as a deep conditioner on my transitioning 3c/4a hair, this product left my hair incredibly dry and tangled. It took me at least an hour using Cantu leave-in shea butter cream and gently detangling with a wide tooth comb to undo some of the damage. I also experienced quite a bit of breakage as a result of this whole ordeal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wanted to cry. It was the second time I had used the masque. The first time I just thought it didn&#x27;t really moisturize as much as I had hoped so I held on to it. I was running low on my good deep conditioner so I decided to give this another try. WORST decision I ever made. The rest of the jar went right in the trash where it belongs!!</li>
    <li> I have natural hair and this is some good stuff.  It moisturizes my hair and makes it feel so soft.  I suggest if you have natural hair to try this and you will not be disappointed.</li>
    <li> I bought this product as a deep conditioner for my relaxed 4a hair, and what can I say except, \\&quot;It was terrible\\&quot;? It sat on top of my hair and didn&#x27;t leave it feeling moisturized at all. Quite the opposite, actually - it felt like all the moisture and softness had been leeched from my hair! I had to follow it up with one of my other moisturizing deep conditioners. I do not recommend this product to anyone as a deep conditioner, and certainly not at the inflated price this vendor is offering. There are better products out there for half the price.</li>
    <li> Left my hair beyond stripped, it felt like I used a sulphate shampoo!! Terrible product. This company has to add more lubrication and nourishing ingredients (olive oil, castor oil, avocado, fatty alcohols) for some of there products to be effective. Shea butter is good but sometimes it needs more to it.</li>
    <li> I am a 47 yr. old African American woman who has done my own hair for years. I was looking for a &#x27;PROTEIN FREE&#x27; product since MOST haircare products contain proteins and eventually you will get protein overload and your hair can break-off. This product was a perfect substitute. It&#x27;s all natural, organic and contains a lot of moisturizing properties i.e. Argan Oil, Essential Oil Blend, Avocado Oil, Soybean Oil, Carrot Seed Oil and Shea Butter. WHAT MORE CAN YOU ASK FOR!!!! The shampoo takes a bit of getting used to because it&#x27;s SULFATE FREE which is better for your hair but sulfate free means it doesnt contain the detergents and other lathering components that most shampoos do. So dont worry if you don&#x27;t get a great deal of lather, your hair is still getting clean. The Deep Treatment Masque works well as a moisturizing conditioner, but beware it does leave a residue (oil) on your hair. Being a black woman that did not concern me because I want something that&#x27;s healthy to coat my hair and protect it from heat appliances, etc. I washed, conditioned and wrapped my hair and then went to the hairdresser to get it cut. I wear my hair relaxed with a short, pixy (Halle Berry)type haircut. My hairdresser said my hair looked and felt beautiful and she was right. I could not be happier with this line. I purchased the Deep Treatment Masque, the Moisture Retention Shampoo and the Restorative Conditioner. Only one of their products contains PROTEIN so read your labels and always to your own research. I will alternate between these products and my protein rich shampoos and conditioners. It is worth the $9.99 for each product and is available almost everywhere (Walgreens, Xmas Tree Shop, Harmons, Bed, Bath &amp; Beyond, Target, etc.). You will not be disappointed. My son even likes it for his waves!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;****SIDEBAR***** These products do contain Sea Kelp which is both Iodine and Zinc rich so if you are allergic to Iodine (NOT Shellfish, it&#x27;s not the same) you CANNOT use thisproduct line. For those of us who ARE NOT ALLERGIC, Sea Kelp strengthens the hair follicle and therefore helps to eliminate shedding.</li>
    <li> I bought this product at Walgreens for 9.99, The exact same product that Amazon is trying to sell for 16.00 and some change. Anyway, it is a good product I use it on my daughter hair who is natural. I use it as a conditioner and you can also us as a leave in conditioner. It works well for her hair. The smell is strong, but its a nice smell.&lt;br /&gt;Also, just about all of Shea Moisture products are  around 10.00. So, if you pay more than that you are paying too much.&lt;br /&gt;thanks</li>
    <li> I love this product for styling my hair. I have 4a/4b textured hair which tends to be very dry. I got this product last year and can&#x27;t truly remember using it to treat my hair, decided to use it as a styler for my twistouts. My hair looked absolutely AHmazing. I have not found a product that makes my hair look more beautiful, more hydrated. My hair is in love with this masque.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those who have tried it as a treatment, and wasn&#x27;t impressed, I&#x27;ll say try using this to style your hair instead or you could send me your jar if you really don&#x27;t want it...lol :). Shea Moisture needs to rebrand this product.</li>
    <li> I have always had very good hair- naturally shiny, thick, but after i had highlights (my guess is they left chemicals on my hair for too long or used really cheap stuff) made it weak, dull and lifeless. I have tried many different conditioners/hair masks, but only shea moisture masque made my hair look shiny and healthy again. I love this product.</li>
    <li> This is like butter for hair..when used you need to spread little slow as it is thick and can stick on hair and rip it if not handled in slow and gentle way on hair. When this mask left of hair for the time recommended, the user can feel the butter feeling when rinsing the hair. It is suitable for curly thick hair as it weighs the hair down little bit and clumping it when used for several times. Very good product to get the immediate moisture. I spread drops of oil after using this product to lock the moisture in for longer time.</li>
    <li> Though this is a mask, I use it as a conditioner in the shower.... and I love it. I also use the shampoo and love the benefits I get with the two products combined. I never have a greasy residue in my hair and it feels naturally soft. I recommend this for all hair types.</li>
    <li> I got this product for $8 during a sale at CVS. I was really excited to try it since I had only heard good things when it first came out. I think they changed the formula because the product is more like Shea Butter in its natural state: hard, a little waxy, and a not-so-great smell. When mixed with other conditioners, the deep treatment masque was a much better product, but I was disappointed, especially with how much it costs normally.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
    <li> It does nothing for my hair, it actually made my hair drier than it was before i used it, the regular conditioner from this shea moisture line is much better, i use it then i go into my gym&#x27;s steam room for 10-15 mins and i swear my hair is so soft, my hair never breaks now ( i have low porosity hair) and my hair is never dry i do this like 4 to 5 times a week, also i use their detangler after i get out of the steam room, i put a little ( and i mean a little) detangler on my hair then their conditioner a little grape seed oil and i swear my hair never breaks off, MY PERFECT COMBINATION. ( just giving the natural hair ladies some ideas)</li>
    <li> I have fine 4b hair, I decided to try this product after hearing great things about the shampoo (which works great for me). I used it as a DC without the oil and it left my hair feeling hard. Maybe it was the amount I used, I used liberally as I do with normal DCs. Because it is a sealant as well my daily moisturizing was not very effective, after a few days I just washed my hair and used my regular DC now my hair is super soft again. For me I think it is the Shea butter that doesn&#x27;t work well for my hair in large quantities.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product because my hair has been like straw lately and needs a little TLC. I&#x27;ve been using it as a weekly deep conditioner. After washing my hair, I put in on my hair, place a plastic shower cap over it and let it soak in for about 30 minutes. After rinsing it out, my hair is so soft! And there&#x27;s no mineral oil in this product (mineral oil makes my hair greasy). The only thing is the price (which is why I&#x27;m only giving it 4 stars). I saw the same product, same size in my local Target for about $4 cheaper! I&#x27;ll be buying there from now on.</li>
    <li> Excellent product and fast shipping. Thank you!</li>
    <li> This didn&#x27;t do anything for my hair. I have 3b 3c (waist length when curly) hair and I really had high hopes for it. My hair didn&#x27;t feel any different after I rinsed. I even tried adding olive oil like to says and it was just an all around flop for me. Everyones hair is different and responds differently to different products. This just didn&#x27;t perform well for me.</li>
    <li> I bought this from my local Walmart for about $9-10 or so. I was in desperate need of a DC and this was the only one they had in the &amp;#34;African American&amp;#34; section. I bought it with high hopes :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For background purposes:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1- I am transitioning (1 year post relaxer on 10/18/14)&lt;br /&gt;2- My hair goes down to BSL&lt;br /&gt;3- First time using Shea Moisture. I&#x27;ve never cared for their products (I usually use Eden&#x27;s Bodyworks or Neutrogena Deep Recovery Mask)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I then proceeded to go to Amazon a few days before I decided to use it and was met with nothing but negative reviews (but they meant nothing to me. you know, we all have different experiences with products) and found that one review in a million that made me positive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The review (which was written by naturally me!) said to apply the DC to dry hair and also added a little olive and coconut oil. I don&#x27;t know if it was the oils or the DC, but I was not impressed with the consistency once I added the oils. It was thin, and not thick like a typical DC. Then, I applied it to my hair. This is where my disappointment came.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Usually with a DC, you can feel it working as you are working it throughout your hair. This DC did nothing for my hair. My curls were what we will call &amp;#34;popping,&amp;#34; but they weren&#x27;t soft or anything like that. Especially the relaxed parts after rinsing? My relaxed hair felt so hard and rough and not at all soft like with my usual DCs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unlike most reviewers, I didn&#x27;t feel the &amp;#34;goopy&amp;#34; texture they felt once they applied the DC. Maybe it&#x27;s because I applied it to dry hair, I&#x27;m not sure...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would I recommend this to someone? I think it depends on who it is and also their hair type. The container says that this works well with transitioning hair, and I personally believe that it doesn&#x27;t. For those who are completely natural, then yes, I would recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After rinsing the DC, I applied Oyin Handmade&#x27;s Honey Hempleave-in conditioner and Hair Dew to do the LOC method. They helped &amp;#34;revert&amp;#34; my hard hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But personally, I&#x27;ll stick with my Eden&#x27;s and Neutrogena for my next DC.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this in my bathroom closet since September after using it as directed after washing with the shampoo (which is amazing!!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;as a conditioner this left my hair dry like straw and matted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recently started bunning my natural hair and decided to use this to seal after I spritz my hair with water and my herbal tea mix. it works MUCH better this way. lightly damp hair and even dry hair. particularly good on those ends that need extra moisture. if it hasn&#x27;t worked for you try it this way. I&#x27;m giving it 3 stars because its horrible as a conditioner and its marketed as a conditioner...but as a cream styler it&#x27;s definitely a 4.5</li>
    <li> I purchased this at Sally Beauty Supply with high hopes, given the all organic/natural ingredients.  I was also (and still am) stoked by the fair-trade practices of the company!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have type 1 B-C hair (straight, medium-coarse texture) and this stuff left my hair stiff and tangly from the moment I put it on in the shower, after using my regular shampoo.  When I rinsed it out, it was no better, so I had to wash it out and re-condition with my regular conditioner.  This might work better on other types of hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the upside, I tried it on my feet, and it left them very soft, but not greasy.  I decided to keep it for use on rough/dry skin and even as a skin protectant for my face and hands on very dry/windy days.  In this respect, and given the pure ingredients and the business practices of the company, it&#x27;s a keeper!</li>
    <li> I use this once a month after I wash my hair and it leaves my hair feeling really soft and manageable!!</li>
    <li> Love this product. Keeps my natural hair strong no breakage. This is my #1 conditioner.</li>
    <li> I can honestly say that I love all shea moisture products, I am a natural with 4b 4c hair and all of shea moisture products work good for my hair. This deep treatment masque has a wonderful smell and it leaves my hair very soft.</li>
    <li> I did&#x60;t like what this masque did to my hair, made it really dry, and hard to untagle.&lt;br /&gt;This product did not work for me.</li>
    <li> Smells amazing, love the ingredients and no animal testing yay!! I want to like this! The lid says &amp;#34;dry, damaged hair&amp;#34;...But all three times I have used it, it has GIVEN me dry, rough, extremely tangled and frizzy hair. I used it as a leave in after washing, a mask with and without heat/shower cap, and every time I get the same result. My hair is by no means fragile or sensitive but this stuff is just bad. My hair feels worse after use.</li>
    <li> Not the best but does a good job!</li>
    <li> This product left my hair so dry and it felt like a broom. i have 3b 3c hair mixed with white and black...so i thought this would do wonders. i left it on for 30 minutes and put a plastic cap on....omg when i rinsed it out it was so dry and gross....i had to competly wash my hair again...i got waayyyyyyyy better results when i used garnier strength reconstructing butter, and miss jessies pillow soft curls</li>
