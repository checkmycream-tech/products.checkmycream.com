      <li>The handle is nice too, since I was holding it for hours.</li>
      <li>good strong comb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>A great strong comb for making strong dreads.</li>
      <li>this helps:)</li>
      <li>I also was expecting the product to be slightly larger but it gets the job done perfectly</li>
      <li>The quality is ok.  </li>
      <li>Was able to dread 3 dreads before it looked like that.</li>
      <li>teeth are easily bendable and breakable when backcoming .</li>
      <li>The comb is strong.</li>
      <li>If you are dreading your own hair, this comb should be exactly what you&#x27;re looking for.</li>
      <li>The handle is comfortable and easy to grip.</li>
      <li>Luckily I ordered 2 combs and we will be able to finish backcombing.</li>
      <li>Comfortable in the hands</li>
      <li>Very sturdy comb and is highly recommmended and a great price.</li>
      <li>The handle is gel and super comfortable.</li>
      <li>This brush was not bad.</li>
      <li>This little comb is really my best friend haha.</li>
      <li>Definetley going to need to buy a new better quality one .</li>
      <li>good not really well made&lt;br</li>
      <li>Ordered a second one because my dog also loved it so much</li>
      <li>Well worth it.</li>
      <li>Very easy to clean and nice wooden handle for a firm grip.</li>
      <li>Its metal with very very close teeth</li>
      <li>The handle is comfortable, but mine is not shaped exactly like the photo, mine does not have a bigger rounded end at the bottom.  </li>
      <li>it was easy to just bend them back into place.</li>
      <li>so it just kind of slides up and down, but it doesn&#x27;t really make a difference..</li>
      <li>Fast Ship&lt;br /&gt;catches on hair and pulls it out, breaks it off&lt;br /&gt;not</li>
      <li>The teeth are very sturdy.</li>
      <li>It was really helpful combing out all those knots</li>
      <li>It wont break and it helps to really knot-up your new locks.</li>
      <li>I am satisfied with this, it certainly dreads hair MUCH easier and faster than the tools Ive used in the past.  </li>
      <li>I used it once on my normal, not thick hair, to backcomb dreads.</li>
      <li>teeth her crooked easily while back coming</li>
      <li>so i don&#x27;t think that helped,it should of been made a little better,but it worked good until the teeth started falling out,so we just finished with a small rat tail comb.......</li>
      <li>Would definitely not recommend this to anyone with thick hair, as yours will probably break more.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve only used mine to make one dread-fall so far</li>
      <li>and the metal piece that sits right above the handle but below the comb part is not glued down</li>
      <li>but the comb is weak and breaks realy easy..</li>

    <li> This comb was total crap and a waste of money. Was able to dread 3 dreads before it looked like that.</li>
    <li> I am satisfied with this, it certainly dreads hair MUCH easier and faster than the tools Ive used in the past.  I&#x27;ve only used mine to make one dread-fall so far but I haven&#x27;t had any teeth break off yet.  The handle is comfortable, but mine is not shaped exactly like the photo, mine does not have a bigger rounded end at the bottom.  and the metal piece that sits right above the handle but below the comb part is not glued down so it just kind of slides up and down, but it doesn&#x27;t really make a difference.. its only a tiny bit annoying. I also was expecting the product to be slightly larger but it gets the job done perfectly so I guess that&#x27;s all that counts.  I will try to upload a photo so you can see what I mean. (I say try because last time I tried uploading a photo on here it never showed up.)</li>
    <li> teeth are easily bendable and breakable when backcoming . Definetley going to need to buy a new better quality one . I&#x27;m going to try dreadheadhq this time</li>
    <li> I was combing out my dreads and two of the prongs got bent. The comb seemed sturdy but wasn&#x27;t as sturdy as i expected.</li>
    <li> Looks durable but still had some prongs break. Does not seem as durable as I thought.it would be, but it still did the job :(</li>
    <li> The Knotty Boy comb worked great for my sons dreads.  Very sturdy comb and is highly recommmended and a great price.</li>
    <li> Very poor quality. I used it once on my normal, not thick hair, to backcomb dreads. I have no product in my hair either. After one day&#x27;s use bristles are already vent and falling out. I have to stop the dreading process until I get another comb. This is supposed to be a dread comb and it can&#x27;t handle dreads???</li>
    <li> my husband dreaded his beard recently and used this plus some other stuff to work at the dreads. good strong comb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;hope this helps:)</li>
    <li> I like what its meant for but I wish it wasn&#x27;t small. I could of stand it to be bigger</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used it yet. The quality is ok.  Not as heavy duty as others I have bought.  I think it will get the job done.</li>
    <li> To small first off I mean what am I a baby. the teeth broke in my hair but I have dreads and I thought this comb was pose to be for dreads  it sucks</li>
    <li> Fast Ship&lt;br /&gt;catches on hair and pulls it out, breaks it off&lt;br /&gt;not good not really well made&lt;br /&gt;will not purchase again</li>
    <li> Exactly as I expected. Sturdy, fine-toothed. Did a great job knotting my hair!</li>
    <li> Did the job. Helped start my dreads.</li>
    <li> This brush was not bad. It worked and broke the knots up but the brush wa made poorly and ended up breaking itself. Did the job but also cut my hand up.</li>
    <li> Sturdy design. Comfortable in the hands</li>
    <li> If you are dreading your own hair, this comb should be exactly what you&#x27;re looking for. It wont break and it helps to really knot-up your new locks. One word of advice though: if you&#x27;re dreading it without professional help, prepare for the long-haul; it is not a fast process.</li>
    <li> it did what i needed it to do..but the comb is weak and breaks realy easy..so i could realy only use it a few times</li>
    <li> Great comb, loved it.  Ordered a second one because my dog also loved it so much</li>
    <li> As i sit here dreading my hair with this comb, I am disappointed with the quality of metal. At about halfway through my dreads there is 1/3 of the comb left unbent. Luckily I ordered 2 combs and we will be able to finish backcombing.</li>
    <li> I used this to make my husband&#x27;s dreads and it&#x27;s strong, sturdy and works great! The handle is nice too, since I was holding it for hours.</li>
    <li> Sturdy and works well!</li>
    <li> A great strong comb for making strong dreads. Very easy to clean and nice wooden handle for a firm grip.</li>
    <li> It was really helpful combing out all those knots</li>
    <li> Although it&#x27;s not as big as I thought it would be it still did the job. The comb is strong. The teeth would bend a little but they did not break. Since the teeth are metal it was easy to just bend them back into place.</li>
    <li> My hair is very thin and when I tried to dread my hair with this comb a few of the metal tongs broke off! I was so disappointed. Would definitely not recommend this to anyone with thick hair, as yours will probably break more.</li>
    <li> I used this while I was combing out my dreads with their Emergency Removal kit. You may want to buy two because in the end the comb went in the trash because it was missing a whole lot of teeth after everything was said and done.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this comb to make synthetic dreads and it is durable and perfect for the job</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t actually purchase this comb, but solely from the reviews I read prior to getting a dread comb. I actually went to the pet store and bought a flee comb by Conair. Sucker is really tough. The handle is gel and super comfortable. I&#x27;m telling you get a flea comb instead it works just as well for dreading or even dedreading. Just saying.</li>
    <li> handle not as pictured. teeth her crooked easily while back coming but it was the job done. you get what you pay for, I personally would not buy again.</li>
    <li> The teeth are very sturdy. I&#x27;ve done and re-done my dreadlocks and the teeth haven&#x27;t bent. The handle is comfortable and easy to grip. Well worth it.</li>
    <li> got the comb last week,came in a decent time.used last night and not even half way of doing my hair 7 teeth broke off,and my hair is nappy so i don&#x27;t think that helped,it should of been made a little better,but it worked good until the teeth started falling out,so we just finished with a small rat tail comb.......I WOULD NOT BUY IF YOU HAVE NAPPY/COURSE HAIR!!!!!!</li>
    <li> This Comb Is GREAT For Backcombing ANY TYPE OF HAIR TO MAKE PERFECT LOCS ! Its metal with very very close teeth and it had a wood handle so it is so great for backcombing your hair into locs ! This little comb is really my best friend haha. GREAT PRODUCT WHEN USED CORRECTLY !</li>
