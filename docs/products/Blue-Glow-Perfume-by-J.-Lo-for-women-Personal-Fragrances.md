      <li>this scent was good</li>
      <li>and I am very satisfied</li>
      <li>It is very nice, love it</li>
      <li>My favorite is JLO GLOW!</li>
      <li>Nice for a pick me up.</li>
      <li>but when i do, it does smell nice.</li>
      <li>However, the smell completely took me by pleasantly by surprise!</li>
      <li>This is my favorite perfume.</li>
      <li>So glad I did.</li>
      <li>i like my perfumes with a bit more &#x27;presence.&#x27;</li>
      <li>and I love everything I have gotten from Amazon...</li>
      <li>I love all of JLO perfumes.</li>
      <li>:) The 3.4oz is gonna last me a while which is awesome since I&#x27;m away at college</li>
      <li>I love this perfume.</li>
      <li>It really smells great.</li>
      <li>I receive many compliments on it all the time.</li>
      <li>(there is no way I could ride my bike there:)).</li>
      <li>She even ordered more for our daughters.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m still excited about my find today!</li>
      <li>It is a beachy-clean scent; almost like fresh linen meets Bora Bora--a very unique, summery scent!</li>
      <li>The most important reason of all for any purchase for your wife.</li>
      <li>Fresh, kind of sweet, aquatic smell but very light.</li>
      <li>I originally bought a 1.3 oz (i think) version of this perfume from Gordmons and fell in love with it.</li>
      <li>I also ordered JLO Glow and that was fine...</li>
      <li>It was a huge hit with my wife.  </li>
      <li>So light that it wears off in 20 mins.</li>
      <li>Amazon helped me not only locate it but be able to really enjoy it fast and at an Incredible price.</li>
      <li>She does such a great job on all of her scents and this one is no exception.</li>
      <li>It smells so nice when freshly put on and it mixes nicely with my natural skin smell.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m just hoping my next order will be intact and full.......STILL LOVE AMAZON!!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll stick to the original GLOW..</li>
      <li>It is a light sweet fragrance, one which my wife loves.</li>
      <li>very clean crisp feminine.</li>
      <li>I received this product fast and was able to track its progress to my home.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m actually glad that happened, because now I purchased here at a much lower price.</li>
      <li>full to where it should be</li>
      <li>It isn&#x27;t a sweet scent.</li>
      <li>I love this so much.</li>
      <li>I really wanted to LOVE this perfume</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s light, fresh and not too sweet.</li>
      <li>If you love the crispness of ocean air then you will likely love this fragrance by JLO.</li>
      <li>This is the kind of perfume I love to wear everyday.  </li>
      <li>This fragrance has an inviting, fresh scent.  </li>
      <li>Would recommend this to anyone who wants that special something for their wife or girlfriend or daughter.  </li>
      <li>Amazon prices are very reasonable.</li>
      <li>The reason I bought it is because I love blue</li>
      <li>This was my first time buying this one.</li>
      <li>I first bought this at TJ MAXX on clearance.</li>
      <li>I bought this perfume for my friend from Kohl&#x27;s when it first came out</li>
      <li>I think the bottle looks funny with out it.</li>
      <li>However, if I&#x27;m in the mood for something mellow, soft and inviting all at the same time I will spray a bit of this on and feel very refreshing.</li>
      <li>I love the beautiful bottle, and I&#x27;m sad that they no longer put a bracelet on the bottles like they used to!</li>
      <li>Thank you JLO for a scent that is so different and unique!</li>
      <li>Think an intense cobalt blue, it looks almost lit up while sitting on the dresser or cabinet, so enjoyable.</li>
      <li>&amp; My Glow (smelled like those cheap deodorant sprays that come in a can) and was equally dissatisfied.</li>
      <li>and I just wanted to try a new scent.</li>
      <li>My neighbor&#x27;s five year old likes it too, she told me so.  </li>
      <li>Definitely soft and oceanic..</li>
      <li>I bought a different JLO fragrance from Kohl&#x27;s and paid a high price.  </li>
      <li>This one smelled old, like an expired perfume, if there is such a thing as an expiration date.</li>

<li> It is definitely not a sweet scent by any means ( I normally prefer a bit sweeter parfums)</li>
<li> I know the bracelet has no bearing on the fragrance, but I couldn&#x27;t help but wonder if I got a fake especially since I ordered Miami Glow from Amazon at the same time and it had the cute little flip flop ankle bracelet.</li>
<li> I hate it when a good smelling perfume starts to stink when it stays on your skin for a while.</li>
<li> This one is soft not strong and it can be worn for all day or night out.  </li>
<li> I would definitely recommend this to other people.</li>
<li> also purchased LA Glow (smelled too flowery &amp; fruity but slightly musky at the same time.. )</li>
<li> Searched high and low for this scent, unable to find it local.</li>
<li> I love the scent but was disappointed that it did not come with the bracelet as shown in the picture.</li>
<li> All my other JLO perfumes have always had the bracelets.</li>
<li> I love all JLO fragrances, but I was disappointed when I opened the package.  </li>
<li> It came half way empty and did not have the bracelet on the bottle.</li>
<li> the bottle looks like it was already used...looks like almost an inch down from where it should be...</li>
<li> The scent is fine, but I&#x27;m a bit disappointed that my unopened bottle from Amazon came without the little bracelet trinket that is shown in the picture.</li>
<li> The trinket bracelet that is usually on her bottles was missing and it shows it on the picture....</li>
<li> I am not satisfied.</li>
<li> Not a good experience.</li>
<li> either something is wrong with my nose, or this perfume is way too faint/ subtle, for me.</li>
<li> It smelled like hairspray to me :(&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
<li> not the worst thing but</li>

    <li> I am not satisfied.It came half way empty and did not have the bracelet on the bottle.</li>
    <li> I love this perfume. I first bought this at TJ MAXX on clearance. So glad I did. I love this so much. I just purchased it on Amazon. I have never seen it on clearance again at TJ MAXX.... Must have been put there just for me to try. I receive many compliments on it all the time.</li>
    <li> It is a light sweet fragrance, one which my wife loves. The most important reason of all for any purchase for your wife.</li>
    <li> I really wanted to LOVE this perfume but I did not. It smelled like hairspray to me :(&lt;br /&gt;I also purchased LA Glow (smelled too flowery &amp; fruity but slightly musky at the same time.. ) &amp; My Glow (smelled like those cheap deodorant sprays that come in a can) and was equally dissatisfied. I&#x27;ll stick to the original GLOW..love that one!! very clean crisp feminine.</li>
    <li> It was everything I hoped for.  I love all of JLO perfumes. This one is soft not strong and it can be worn for all day or night out.  This is the kind of perfume I love to wear everyday.  This was my first time buying this one. The reason I bought it is because I love blue and I was hoping for the perfume to be good and it was.  This is a must try.  It won&#x27;t hurt. lol</li>
    <li> I received this product fast and was able to track its progress to my home. Good pricing and smells great!</li>

    <li> I love the scent but was disappointed that it did not come with the bracelet as shown in the picture. All my other JLO perfumes have always had the bracelets. I think the bottle looks funny with out it.</li>
    <li> smells very nice yes. IF U CAN SMELL IT. either something is wrong with my nose, or this perfume is way too faint/ subtle, for me. I have to spray alot to notice this. but when i do, it does smell nice. i like my perfumes with a bit more &#x27;presence.&#x27; smells good tho. if u can smell it.</li>
    <li> I bought this without testing it and I find I like the fragrance.  My neighbor&#x27;s five year old likes it too, she told me so.  It&#x27;s light, fresh and not too sweet.</li>
    <li> I originally bought a 1.3 oz (i think) version of this perfume from Gordmons and fell in love with it. It smells so nice when freshly put on and it mixes nicely with my natural skin smell. I hate it when a good smelling perfume starts to stink when it stays on your skin for a while. This one doesn&#x27;t. It smells just as good. :) The 3.4oz is gonna last me a while which is awesome since I&#x27;m away at college and there isn&#x27;t a Gordmons for quite a while (there is no way I could ride my bike there:)). I would definitely recommend this to other people.</li>
    <li> I took a chance on this product.  I bought a different JLO fragrance from Kohl&#x27;s and paid a high price.  After reviewing the comments of those who had bought this fragrance, I ordered it from Amazon.  It was a huge hit with my wife.  She even ordered more for our daughters.  This fragrance has an inviting, fresh scent.  Would recommend this to anyone who wants that special something for their wife or girlfriend or daughter.  Amazon prices are very reasonable.</li>
    <li> It is very nice, love it</li>
    <li> The scent is fine, but I&#x27;m a bit disappointed that my unopened bottle from Amazon came without the little bracelet trinket that is shown in the picture. I know the bracelet has no bearing on the fragrance, but I couldn&#x27;t help but wonder if I got a fake especially since I ordered Miami Glow from Amazon at the same time and it had the cute little flip flop ankle bracelet. Meh might see if I can return.</li>
    <li> I have purchased JLO perfume before but never online. This one smelled old, like an expired perfume, if there is such a thing as an expiration date. Not a good experience.</li>
    <li> Definitely soft and oceanic.. If you love the crispness of ocean air then you will likely love this fragrance by JLO. She does such a great job on all of her scents and this one is no exception. It is definitely not a sweet scent by any means ( I normally prefer a bit sweeter parfums) However, if I&#x27;m in the mood for something mellow, soft and inviting all at the same time I will spray a bit of this on and feel very refreshing. Not to mention the bottle is GORGEOUS! Think an intense cobalt blue, it looks almost lit up while sitting on the dresser or cabinet, so enjoyable. Thank you JLO for a scent that is so different and unique!</li>
    <li> Excelente perfume se la regale a my esposa y wao creo que hasta hora es una de las mejores cosa que le he regalado la recomiendo 100%.</li>
    <li> Fresh, kind of sweet, aquatic smell but very light. So light that it wears off in 20 mins. Nice for a pick me up. Only if it lasted longer.</li>
    <li> I bought this perfume for my friend from Kohl&#x27;s when it first came out and we both loved it. I wanted to buy it for myself, but Kohl&#x27;s was sold out when I went back. I&#x27;m actually glad that happened, because now I purchased here at a much lower price. It really smells great.</li>
    <li> My wife likes the perfume.</li>
    <li> I have always loved JLo&#x27;s perfumes! I actually found a 3.3 oz bottle for $19 at Ross today--but I didn&#x27;t get to smell the fragrance prior to purchasing it so I was nervous! However, the smell completely took me by pleasantly by surprise! It is a beachy-clean scent; almost like fresh linen meets Bora Bora--a very unique, summery scent! It isn&#x27;t a sweet scent. I love the beautiful bottle, and I&#x27;m sad that they no longer put a bracelet on the bottles like they used to! I&#x27;m still excited about my find today!</li>
    <li> I am taken pleasure by the product acquired in his shop. Thank you for the sending until Friday it was that receipt the product in my hands and I am very satisfied thank you.</li>
    <li> My favorite is JLO GLOW! best perfume eveeeeeeeeeer! this scent was good I never heard of it and I just wanted to try a new scent.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite perfume.</li>
