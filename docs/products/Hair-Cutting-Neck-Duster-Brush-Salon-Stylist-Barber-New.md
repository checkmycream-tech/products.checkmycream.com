      <li>So from the words of Mr. Sensitive : this is a perfect instrument for both shaving and barbering.</li>
      <li>A good and useful stylist item.</li>
      <li>Ok for the price, though.</li>
      <li>Came on time and has been a great product so far.</li>
      <li>Overall, good buy!</li>
      <li>So far, so good.  </li>
      <li>Okay buy I guess but if looking for a nice barber brush (big)</li>
      <li>feels soft and has a nice handle.</li>
      <li>BUT A GREAT LITTLE BRUSH.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s very soft and comfortable to use.</li>
      <li>Fast delivery!</li>
      <li>So I&#x27;ve decided to purchase this duster and use it for the first time.</li>
      <li>extremely soft, no hairs escape it, bristles don&#x27;t fall off, well made, can even clean face with it.</li>
      <li>Very MINI, but thankyou</li>
      <li>Got it for my clients,workers very well,  i recommend....</li>
      <li>He himself says it&#x27;s so soft</li>
      <li>but I wonder how much longer it will last if the hairs keep coming off...</li>
      <li>, we wondered how much of this hair in the brush cud possibly be mine.</li>
      <li>(Mr Sensitive what can I say?)</li>
      <li>Only draw back is that it has a funny ink smell.</li>
      <li>Exactly what was expected</li>
      <li>the back of his neck was freshly clean and conforting like delicate skin.</li>

    <li> Hairs are already falling off after a few weeks of use.  Ok for the price, though.</li>
    <li> Works great! Takes brushes off all the hairs from the neck and face when I&#x27;m done cutting hair.</li>
    <li> much smaller than I imagined it would be!</li>
    <li> got this for my hairdresser.&lt;br /&gt;we teased how in me donating over 67&amp;#34; of my hair in a 10yr period, we wondered how much of this hair in the brush cud possibly be mine. {not unless i was in china which i wasn&#x27;t}&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;gr8 little duster!</li>
    <li> Exactly what was expected</li>
    <li> A product that was purchased to remove loose hair after a trim/lining. So far, so good.  This product did just that.</li>
    <li> extremely soft, no hairs escape it, bristles don&#x27;t fall off, well made, can even clean face with it.</li>
    <li> Excellent.  Works perfectly to remove hairs from neck and a soft touch.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s very soft and comfortable to use. I like it a lot.</li>
    <li> great for barbers or at home trimmers like myself! gets the little hairs off forehead and neck area!</li>
    <li> Got it for my clients,workers very well,  i recommend....good price</li>
    <li> Came on time and has been a great product so far.</li>
    <li> A nice touch for home haircuts. Add an inexpensive cape from Amazon to keep snips from itching your customers.</li>
    <li> Item seemed larger than it appeared. Very MINI, but thankyou</li>
    <li> Not as described can&#x27;t even use it,it&#x27;s very small wast of money.so don&#x27;t wast your money on this thing please.</li>
    <li> Works good for brushing off lil hairs after giving my boys their cuts. Some shedding but not the sob story other reviews have posted about. Overall, good buy!</li>
    <li> Smaller than it looks - haven&#x27;t used it yet, but I&#x27;m assuming it will do the job. Okay buy I guess but if looking for a nice barber brush (big) this is not it.</li>
    <li> I got this because I want to start cutting my son&#x27;s hair instead of paying a barber. The hairs on this brush come off with every swipe though... For the price, it does it&#x27;s job but I wonder how much longer it will last if the hairs keep coming off...</li>
    <li> feels soft and has a nice handle. Only draw back is that it has a funny ink smell. But it is new and maybe just has to be in the open air for a few days.</li>
    <li> The item is much smaller than it looks and it is delivered from China. So it took over three weeks to be delivered</li>
    <li> I happen to be my husband&#x27;s personal barber. While I&#x27;m cutting and styling his hair, he&#x27;s always whining about his trimmed hairs falling and lying down on the back of his neck. (Mr Sensitive what can I say?) So I&#x27;ve decided to purchase this duster and use it for the first time. Lo and behold : no more whinings. He himself says it&#x27;s so soft it&#x27;s like the back of his neck was freshly clean and conforting like delicate skin. So from the words of Mr. Sensitive : this is a perfect instrument for both shaving and barbering. A good and useful stylist item.</li>
    <li> NOT AS BIG AS I THOUGHT BUT A GREAT LITTLE BRUSH. GREAT VALUE AND QUICK DELIVERY!  I WAS VERY PLEASED WITH MY ORDER</li>
    <li> Brush is very small... not made for cleaning up a haircut... waste of money!!!</li>
    <li> Fast delivery! Great Item! Item just as described!</li>
    <li> Broke after a few uses not worth getting.</li>
