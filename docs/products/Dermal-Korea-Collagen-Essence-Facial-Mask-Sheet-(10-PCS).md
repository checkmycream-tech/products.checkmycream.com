      <li>and they give a youthful, soft look.</li>
      <li>At the price, I can enjoy this a few times a week.</li>
      <li>first package i open was dry.  </li>
      <li>I am 17 years old, so I do not have wrinkles, but I still use it because it will help to prevent in the long run.</li>
      <li>oh man what a waste of money, be aware this doesn&#x27;t do anything that says on the packet.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I lived in Japan for a year and they had these wonderful collagen masks that just made my complexion wonderful.  I thought I would try to find something similar online now that I am back in the U.S. and stumbled across these.  I have been using them now for a few weeks and the effects are exactly the same as those I found in Japan.  They are easy to use, feel really nice, and leave your skin looking great.  As a plus, they are soothing for sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> The Dermal Korea Collagen full facial masks are easy to use and leave the skin feeling tingly fresh and clean. The generous 10-pack is a great value.</li>
    <li> These masks feel AMAZING. My skin looks and feels youthful as soon as my 20 minutes are up. I purchased these with the Daiso Japan Reusable Silicon Mask Cover so I can walk around and do things while wearing my mask. They also included an extra Collagen Mask. I can&#x27;t wait to try other kinds after I&#x27;m done with these!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m an esthetician and I use these in my spa.  I like to use them on dry dehydrated skin, common in the area where I live.</li>
    <li> I saw something similar on Dr. oz and wanted to try it.  These are wonderful.  Very moist. Very, very relaxing. Light, pleasant fragrance...I have allergies and they didn&#x27;t bother me one bit.  Did I mention relaxing?  Lol.  Love these and will continue to order.  Made my face feel fantastic afterwards. High recommended.</li>
    <li> I strongly recommend these to anybody that wants to improve their skin appearance and also relax at the same time.</li>
    <li> I loved it so much I bought it again after only trying it once</li>
    <li> Has fair soft fragrance. Stays on the face well. Makes the face stay moist.</li>
    <li> first package i open was dry.  found another rip.</li>
    <li> these are good for relaxing. I don&#x27;t have any wrinkles, I probably shouldn&#x27;t have ordered collagen- So it&#x27;s expected I didn&#x27;t have any noticeable differences after wearing, just more moisture. It smells nice too.</li>
    <li> There are more expensive sheet masks out there but for me they don&#x27;t work as well as the Dermal Green Team mask. It is summer as I am writing this and there is nothing better after being in the hot sun than this mask. At the price, I can enjoy this a few times a week.</li>
    <li> Pricing is excellent. Just got it, so can&#x27;t see results yet!</li>
    <li> i enjoy pamparing myself time to time. and with this special bundle, i dont have to make weekly trips to the store</li>
    <li> great, but suppose 10, I have 9 instead.</li>
    <li> Great product and fast shipping!!</li>
    <li> This mask was very cooling and helped the PRP absorb.  Comfortable and easy to use.  I would use this again.</li>
    <li> I loved it! It makes my skin feel soft and healthy</li>
    <li> Awesome after a day in the pool or at the beach! I have super sensitive skin no reaction at all!</li>
    <li> Not good for my skin at all. It hurts when I apply this mask.</li>
    <li> I ove these. I used a mask the night befoe I was to see a friend, we met up, I instantly got a compliment on my skins. She looked at me and told me that my face has a glow. These masks really firm and they give a youthful, soft look. I will be stocking up.</li>
    <li> oh man what a waste of money, be aware this doesn&#x27;t do anything that says on the packet. don&#x27;t buy.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a nice product. I feel the difference if I don&#x27;t use the masks for a month -- My skin feels better if I use the masks. But honestly I didn&#x27;t notice any big difference between this product and other products.</li>
    <li> I am 17 years old, so I do not have wrinkles, but I still use it because it will help to prevent in the long run. I&#x27;ve been using this mask for a few years now and I love it. Helps me relax, I use it often and it is one of my favorite Korean face masks. Totally recommend this mask!</li>
    <li> Very reliable line with nice thick masks and ample product in the masks.  The green tea is a new try for me - not sure yet</li>
    <li> My friens recommended me to buy this item. I like it. I will try to use it as soon as possible</li>
    <li> Ive always bought these at the asian mall beauty kiosk. These are easy and effective. My makeup goes on smoother days after I&#x27;ve used the mask.</li>
    <li> Awesome Mask!!! Thanks</li>
    <li> I love love love this mask! It&#x27;s my favorite part of my skin care routine. I have extremely sensitive skin and was worried it might cause irritation but it felt wonderful. It&#x27;s very cool and refreshing, the perfect way to relax. I use it after exfoliating my face, and then put on moisturizer after rubbing all the liquid into my skin.</li>
    <li> very fast shipping and like the mask. great. thanks. i put it onmy face every night and feel great. my skin is very moisturized.</li>
    <li> These don&#x27;t do much for me. I guess my skin feels softer for a little bit, and they are easy to use but it doesn&#x27;t feel like anything is really penetrating my skin. I think a mask with hyaluronic acid in it to really penetrate and plump up the skin. Searching for one!</li>
    <li> These are perfect for the winter months when your skin is dry and damaged. Also great when your skin is inflamed. I have acne and these masks help to soothe irritation caused from acne and reduce redness and inflammation.</li>
    <li> I actually got my first Dermal mask as a gift and after I tried it, my skin was extremely smooth, I recommend this to anyone who loves sheet masks, this mask is great for any skin type and I love it!!</li>
