<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I like this lotion. It&#x27;s light and it does not irritate my sensitive skin. It has a nice light not overpowering smell. I will be purchasing more of this lotion againin the near future. Great buy at a great price.</li>
    <li> I love natural products without the typical weird ingredients that will backlash on your skin at a later stage. This cream really does it for me. Soothing, hydrating, clarifying and even my skin tone seems to have improved after several weeks use.&lt;br /&gt;I can only recommend this amazing product to everyone who is conscious about their skin and its comfort</li>
    <li> Love the product it feels soft on the skin but surely is strong enough to repair.  I have only started using it for a week and I can already feel and see my skin totally different and without as much expression lines as I had when I began using it.  I love the product and fully recommend it it&#x27;s totally worth the try and the best thing is that it is all natural so I&#x27;m glad I&#x27;m not adding anything that will create any allergic reaction especially in my skin that is very sensitive!!</li>
    <li> absolutely love the product, i just put a little bit cream in my face.my skin feel soft and smooth.</li>
    <li> This product smells great and feels awesome on the skin</li>
    <li> I like the feel of this moisturizer on my face and I love the way it quickly absorbs. That means I can apply it right before I go to bed without having to worry about it getting on my pillowcases and sheets. I&#x27;ve used this both as a night cream and during the day and it lasts the day or night. My skin is pretty dry so I do have to reapply it after about 12 hours or sometimes a little less. I like that the ingredients are plant derived although many cosmetic ingredients come from plants and are processed into something with a particular purpose. This one seems to work. It doesn&#x27;t make wrinkles disappear but it does add moisture which plumps up my skin and makes them less noticeable. The fragrance is light and the consistency is light, sort of like mayonnaise. It spreads easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They did a nice job with packaging the product. The jar is a tastefully understated frosted glass with a brushed silver lid. I know what a container looks like shouldn&#x27;t influence my perception of what is in the jar, but it kind of does.if I had not tried this moisturizer before I would likely pick it out on a store shelf because it looks like a quality product. Also, it is a generous 4 ounces of moisturizer. At any rate, I have tried it and it&#x27;s a product that I would likely purchase after this jar, which was provided as a sample for testing, is gone.</li>
    <li> I really love this moisturizer, I use it day and night. It moisturizes and gives me that perfect glow.</li>
    <li> I like it! She love it.</li>
    <li> This cream is wonderful. I&#x27;ve only had it a few days, so I will update in a couple of weeks.&lt;br /&gt;This first day, I overdid it and used too much thinking that it was going to be like other creams and necesitate copious amounts. I woke up the next morning to greasy skin. After learning from my mistake, I re-applied the tiniest amount which more than covered my face and neck the next morning. Then I applied my makeup which seemed to last longer and with fewer touch ups than usual.&lt;br /&gt;The scent is marvelous. It is not overpowering and soothing. I lover the way it makes my face feel.</li>
    <li> This is an exceptional moisturizer. I have been using it now for two months and the fine lines around my eyes are a distant memory.  It also provides great moisture and  during the day. I am not one to wear Foundation and as such I use LA Beauty Labs. This is a true Face Lift in a Bottle so forget about Botox and  start using this amazing product.</li>
    <li> Love, love this cream! I have very sensitive skin and this product works great. I normally don’t pay much attention to ingredients, but you can definitely feel the difference with “all natural”. The cream goes on smooth, not greasy at all, and the smell is pleasant without being overpowering. The packaging is elegant, yet practical and the price is a bargain for the quality of product you&#x27;re receiving. I will definitely be gifting this to all my friends!</li>
    <li> It helps the dryness on my skins and especially on my swimmwr&#x27;s dry skins. Will recommend it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m used to using either Lush or another midrange natural brand of lotion and other body products, so I didn&#x27;t have high expectations for this given that I have such brand loyalty to Lush. However, this really blew me away. It sinks in immediately, has a fresh scent which doesn&#x27;t linger too long, and has natural ingredients that I don&#x27;t feel afraid to leave on my skin. It really moisturizes very well, and I&#x27;ve used it both on my face and body. It is light and doesn&#x27;t cause breakouts. Overall, I&#x27;m really surprised to find that I like it even better than my usual lotions. Though I received a sample for review, the positive opinion is my own.</li>
    <li> This cream is amazing! I&#x27;ve been using it for almost a week now and my skin feels rejuvenated. My body normally reacts easily and I get rashes very quickly. However, this cream not only keeps my skin feeling supple (for over 24 hours!) but also doesn&#x27;t cause any negative reaction. It&#x27;s probably due to the true organic features of this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve recommended this product to all my friends because I love the consistency of this product (Not greasy yet extreme moisture, leaves my skin glowing!)</li>
    <li> I have dry, middle aged skin and I&#x27;m always on the lookout for quality moisturizers. I especially like products with Hyaluronic Acid (it holds in the moisture) and Vitamin C (helps reverse sun damage and regenerate skin cells). I choose natural, organic products whenever I can, and steer clear of unpronounceable chemicals. This LA Beauty Labs moisturizer is wonderful and I&#x27;ve enjoyed using it for several weeks before writing this review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it twice a day after cleaning my face, also applying it to my neck and upper chest. It smells clean and fresh without having an overpowering fragrance, and it soaks in quickly without leaving me too greasy. I&#x27;ve also been using it on my elbows, where I tend to get dry flaky patches. It&#x27;s soothing and calms irritation, thanks to the colloidal oatmeal. The large 4 ounce jar will last me for months, and it&#x27;s pretty sitting on my vanity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great Features:&lt;br /&gt;- Hyaluronic Acid&lt;br /&gt;- Vitamins C &amp; E&lt;br /&gt;- Moroccan Argan Oil&lt;br /&gt;- Witch Hazel&lt;br /&gt;- Aloe Vera&lt;br /&gt;- natural botanicals (chamomile, licorice root, green tea, rosemary, skullcap root, Gotu Kola,&lt;br /&gt;- 99.2% natural ingredients (82% organic!)&lt;br /&gt;- USA made&lt;br /&gt;- 100% guaranteed, or you get a refund&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a complimentary sample of LA Beauty Labs moisturizer for testing and review purposes. I wasn&#x27;t asked to leave a positive review, nor was I compensated in any way for giving my honest opinion.</li>
    <li> Love this product, make my skin feel amazing!! Smells good too!</li>
    <li> Excellent facial cream.</li>
    <li> There is a reason why this product has 40 five star reviews out of 41.  It really is an amazing product.  The thing I like most about it is that it is not full of chemicals.  All these other companies make products that have so many chemicals in them you worry about dying of cancer if you try to keep your skin hydrated!  Seriously, it is a concern for me.  With this product, I don&#x27;t have to worry about it. It&#x27;s 99% natural and mostly organic.  So at least, I can feel good about using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As to quality, it really is great.  It smells absolutely lovely (a very light scent, it&#x27;s not overpowering or anything), it is very hydrating and goes on nice and smooth.  There is no sticky feel when you put it on and there is no oily residue.  You also only need a very small amount so the product should last quite a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it is a fabulous product that I can highly recommend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received a sample for review.</li>
    <li> Love this cream! I was gas given my first tub of it by a friend and actually used all of it and bought another tub right away. It has the ingredients I want, none of the ones I don&#x27;t want and it doesn&#x27;t break me out. This stuff is awesome!</li>
    <li> Excellent product! I am very impressed with this cream. I am very picky and careful when it comes to skincare products, since a lot of them contain ingredients and chemicals that are bad for your skin. I tried many products and this one is a keeper! This cream has natural ingredients that are all beneficial for the skin such as aloe, oatmeal, moroccan oil and many other natural ingredients that I researched. It is very moisturizing and leaves my skin very soft and plump. I am 25 and starting to see some small lines around my mouth and this cream really helps diminish the look of these fine lines. By far, the best cream I tried. I use it day and night and I am very happy with the results!</li>
    <li> Light but nourishing, feels great on my face! A nice sized 4 oz jar, and very little is needed to moisturize. Skin is looking refreshed.</li>
    <li> It smells awesome but it irritates the eye area. Other than that, it is a good product.</li>
    <li> If you want to feel as pampered as a Hollywood star you just have to try this cream. When I used it the first time I was pretty impressed with how well it moisturized and absorbed. It has a gel/cream consistency and a little goes a long way. I used it on my neck and face at first and then I tried it all over. How luxurious.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now after using it for about a week I started to notice that my face was not breaking out. This is actually non-comedogenic which means you are going to love your clear beautiful skin because it doesn&#x27;t block your pores. Seriously you can see the difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This also has a lot of great ingredients including aloe vera, green tea extract, MSM, hyaluronic acid and grape seed oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I experienced something that apparently only a few people (maybe 1 in 100) do and that was a slight warming sensation. I was told that this simply means all the wonderful ingredients are getting transported to deeper layers of my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another thing I noticed was the slight redness on the top of my cheeks seems to be disappearing. I have pretty sensitive skin and apparently my skin loves this moisturizer and it has calmed my skin as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The jar of moisturizer is quite large so you really get a lot compared to other creams on the market.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~The Rebecca Review&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received one free jar for review purposes. This review is my honest opinion.</li>
    <li> This is a great face and body anti-aging cream.  When I opened the jar I fell in love with the fragrance. It&#x27;s a distinctive flowery and earthy scent that is very appealing. The cream is soft, satiny, and applies smoothly.  Unlike other creams that I&#x27;ve used it applies with a non-greasy feeling and absorbs quickly. I use the cream on my face, forehead, neck, and chest area and the skin is hydrated immediately.  I also use the cream as an over-all body cream.  The cream is rich so a little goes a long way.  The ingredients include aloe vera, rosemary leaf, orange stem cells culture, Vitamin C Esther, and  licorice, witch hazel, and apple extracts. I purchased this cream at a discount in exchange for an honest and unbiased review, and the thoughts in this review are my own.</li>
    <li> I think if I could turn this moisturizer into liquid form and soak in a tub of it I would!  It&#x27;s just that good!&lt;br /&gt;This La Cr&amp;egrave;me de la Beaut&amp;eacute; by LA Beauty Labs is not only super hydrating but it also helps restore damaged skin, diminish wrinkles and evens out skin tone.  Best of all you can use this moisturizer not only on your face but on your entire body.  As most of you already know I have very oily skin and this even worked well for that.  Mostly, I have been using this as a neck cream and also on my decollete and shoulders.  I love applying it at night after my serums and when I wake up in the morning my skin is hydrated, plump and super soft.  Plus, it smells amazing which means I smell amazing!  It has a light orange citrus smell that I love!  I would use it just for the smell, but it happens to be an amazing moisturizer as well.&lt;br /&gt;The consistency is a cross between a gel and a rich cream, it&#x27;s not oily, sticky or greasy at all and it absorbs quickly and hydrates completely.  I love that it is also non-comedogenic and perfect for sensitive skin.  It even works as an effective Rosacea, Eczema or Psoriasis treatment!&lt;br /&gt;The La Cr&amp;egrave;me de la Beaut&amp;eacute; by LA Beauty Labs is naturally anti-aging.  It contains maximum levels of active organic and wild-harvested herbal ingredients, Bio-available Vitamin C and Orange stem cells are key helping achieve that youthful glow!  It also has Aloe Vera and olives which contain low levels of naturally occurring SPF to protect you from mild sun exposure.&lt;br /&gt;There is nothing that I don&#x27;t love about La Cr&amp;egrave;me de la Beaut&amp;eacute; by LA Beauty Labs!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***I did receive this product at a discount or complimentary in exchange for my honest, unbiased review.  However, I was not paid in anyway and my thoughts and opinions are my own.***</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! It makes my skin feel hydrated and I feel like I&#x27;m glowing during the day!</li>
    <li> Wonderful cream! I use it on my face day and night, doesn&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m coated with something.  After using a few days as I was applying the cream to my face, I noticed a difference. Just seemed more youthful, actually I looked closer and the smile lines around my mouth seemed less noticeable. Used some on my hands too, love it. Great ingredients, organic, natural and it works. Get some, you won&#x27;t be sorry!  5 plus stars</li>
    <li> All my life I haven&#x27;t used any moisturizer for more than few days for the simple reason of breakouts. I have a very oily skin and when I turned 30 I started getting acne. I tried numerous products and ended agreeing to use Proactiv to get rid of the acne, the scars and blackheads. I&#x27;ll hand it to proactiv it did a grand job but at a $ price. After my pregnancy I started to wean off Proactiv, it worked the acne wasn&#x27;t as severe but I did stop seeing the glow on my face and the blackheads returned with a vengeance. Fortunately came across this product and I have used it all over my face, neck as well as the whole body. I have never felt my knee caps soo supple and smooth. I exfoliate it quite often but no cream was able to change the texture and feel as this one did. I think I have found the one cream for my skin that does it all. Along with the moisturizer I use a rosewater toner and once a week do a dead sea salt mud mask to clear my blackheads. Will write and update at the end of the month.</li>
    <li> It is not oily, sticky or greasy but deeply hydrating.</li>
    <li> Love, Love, Love this cream. My skin feels and looks amazing.</li>
    <li> I remember watching my mother and even my grandmother apply creams to their face, neck and arms every night as part of their evening routine. Strangely, I never thought about doing it consistently until..well.. my age started walking across my face!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Being a product reviewer, I have tried my share of products. Some are OK, some are great and then there are the ones like this Cream by LA Beauty Labs that you just want to tell your friends about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This cream reminds me of spa treatments. It is a heavy cream but it isn&#x27;t greasy. My skin absorbed it quickly but the cream could still be &amp;#34;felt&amp;#34; where applied for about another hour. At first this bothered me, but after a couple of days I learned to apply less at first and reapply if needed so this wasn&#x27;t an issue. I am really funny about how things feel on my skin..thankfully, this is one that I have learned to appreciate. A word to the wise here...apply lightly to your face. A little bit will cover a large area. Different areas seem to absorb at different rates. My face and neck take longer than my arms and hands. I use more of it on my arms than on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a unique scent. I can&#x27;t quite put a name to it, but it is comforting. Yeah, it has a comforting scent to me. Reminds me of hugging my grandmother when she was still alive. That kind of comforting... a hug!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product information explains what the combination of ingredients do and why they were chosen. Each provides a level of care and treatment quality to your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This cream can be used any where on your face &amp; body as it is completely free of any harmful substances: Parabens, Artificial preservatives, GMOs, Petroleum, Mineral oil, Propylene glycol, Sulfates, Phthalates, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nor does it does not contain lanolin, silicones or waxes and is Gluten and Nut Free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using this cream your skin will experience deep hydration that lasts for up to 72 hours. It works to help the restoration of damaged skin and brings out the natural glow due to infusion of active herbal ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I appreciate that this is a product that isn&#x27;t full of chemicals and will help me to protect my skin.

    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cream for a month and what an amazing difference to my skin. Awesome to find a safe, well priced moisturizer to enhance my skin. D Robinson</li>
    <li> I am constantly on the quest to find a gentle, all natural face cream. I have sensitive, dry/flaky, rosacea prone skin with that gets irritated easily.  My skin loves the LA Beauty Labs Moisturizer. It has improved my skin and the dry/flakiness is gone. It is non-greasy and has a mild pleasant scent. I also use it for dry patches on my body.  This is an excellent face/body cream. A little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> I have enjoyed this product.  The smell is great and it has taken my skin to another level of elasticity and clarity.  It is certainly true that you only need a dab.  I have been using the same 4 oz. jar for almost 4 months; it is worth the price.</li>
    <li> Love it. Makes my skin feel soft to the touch and has increased the look and feel of skin. Use it every morning. Just a little dab will go a long way.</li>
    <li> This arrived prompt and I have enjoyed using it.  Seems like its really making a difference but still too soon to say how much.  I will buy it again.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B00UMX5NAW La Beauty Labs Face Moisturizer Anti Aging 4 OZ]]&lt;br /&gt;What my wife liked best about it were all the organic ingredients.She is very health conscious,and won&#x27;t use any products that aren&amp;#34;t organic or that have any suspicious ingredients. So,if she&#x27;ll use it,then I guess I&#x27;ll try it.&lt;br /&gt;The jar is almost used up.She requested that I get her some more for Xmas. I will. It&#x27;s her favorite,and she&#x27;s quite particular about what products she&amp;#34;ll put on her body. Jeff K</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:64da7976f8fcf8416fd5e6720206a744]] Such an awesome product. Great facial cr&amp;egrave;me. I let my husband use it and he loves it. I did receive this product in exchange for my honest review.</li>
    <li> Great seller.  Cream is wonderful.  Light but absorbs like a dream.  My skin feels smoother and moisturized immediately.  Light fragrance.  I received this discounted product in exchange for my honest review and I truly love it.</li>
    <li> I have gotten this cream as a gift from a friend!&lt;br /&gt;I love how it feels! It does not leave an oily residue on the skin and it totally absorbs!</li>
    <li> A friend of mine turned me onto this cream. I get cracked hands and feet that sometimes bleed and it healed them in a couple of days. Its not oily or greasy which is hard to find plus it has really good natural ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;Aloe Vera is great but most aloe products are full of junk. This one is solid so I do recommend it.</li>
    <li> I received this moisturizer to review and I love it. I love the way it makes my skin look and feel.  It gives me immediate moisturization.  It takes away that dull looking skin I have and makes it feel soft, moist and younger.  I love the natural looking glow I get.</li>
    <li> Awesome product! Not greasy and has a pleasant scent. Dark brown spots on arms faded after only a couple of weeks of use! Great results for a great price. I would highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Works so great if you eczema purchased this product for my daughter she has frequent out breaks and she loved it. It a light pleasant smell she adored. Her face began to clear up immediately her face is smooth again and peace in the valley is back.</li>
    <li> I have experienced many moisturizers over my lifetime, good, very good, and excellent.  However, LA Beauty Labs Moisturizer knocks them all right out of the ballpark.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As an older woman, I tend to have dryer skin, because that’s what happens with age. I also live in the southwest, a very hot and dry desert climate where the environment is so dry and acrid that any natural body moisture is absorbed into the air.  In our 7-month summer, no one wants to go out in the sun; temperatures stay around the 110-degree mark, and the humidity is so low our bodies do not sweat, instead our skin dries out and feels ‘crispy’.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;LA Moisturizer, does more than hydrate, more than moisturize, it leaves skin feeling like ‘liquid silk’.  The concentrated cream has a slightly thicker texture; therefore a little goes a long way. I use a tiny cosmetic spatula, scoop out a dab, rub my palms together and apply to each section of my body. LA Moisturizer is not sticky, not greasy, and not oily.  It melts and becomes absorbed through skin layers, penetrating deep to nourish skin cells.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I guarantee this moisturizer will immediately soften any rough, dry skin on elbows, knees, legs and feet, and skin feels so silky, you’re going to want to hug yourself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a facial moisturizer, just a very small amount will cover the face, I just sweep one finger across the top, and that is a sufficient amount for full coverage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most good moisturizers will keep skin hydrated, and soft throughout the day, and then in the evening we reapply the moisturizer to rehydrate our skin until the morning hours.  LA Moisturizer is different, not only does it last the full day, after my morning shower, my skin is still silky smooth because the softness has not washed away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;LA Beauty Moisturizer is luxuriously rich and creamy containing maximum levels of organic and wild harvested herbal ingredients, and nourishing plant extracts, which are natural sources of anti-oxidants to protect, anti-bacterial and anti-inflammatory to heal, calm and soothe irritated skin, and nourishing properties to help repair skin cell damage.

    <li> Absolutely amazing! Luxurious with a clean feel and I love how the ingredients are basic natural things. I love creams and this one is turning out to be my favorite.</li>
    <li> So... being a dude, I wouldn&#x27;t normally write a review for this kind of girly stuff; but a couple weeks ago I noticed that my girlfriend started using something new that smelled really good. Turned out she got some new lotion. I usually can&#x27;t stand the scent of most lotions she uses but this one is really mild and I gotta say; kinda pleasant... so I tried some myself and surprisingly it didn&#x27;t make my hands feel greasy. My gf told me to try using it after shaving because it&#x27;s supposed to get rid of irritation; and it totally worked. This is good stuff to get for ur lady; and then sneak some for yourself.</li>
    <li> it was great to receive a product that was true to its description.  I used it the first day it arrived and have used it everyday since. It really is one of the best moisturizers I have ever used!</li>
    <li> This moisturizing cream is white and has the whipped texture of mayonnaise.  The fragrance is neutral, with subtle but detectable notes of witch hazel and aloe vera and a hint of sweet botanicals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cream instantly melts into the skin and immediately soothes and softens dry areas.  It is an excellent moisturizer and regular use will lessen the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ingredients are mostly botanical or plant derived and predominantly organic.  This cream does not irritate my sensitive skin even when used around the eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The frosted glass jar holds a generous 4 oz. supply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;LA Beauty Labs provided cream for evaluation and review</li>
