      <li>and I love it.</li>
      <li>Thank you Timeless Skin Care for the reasonable price on this amazing product!</li>
      <li>A good price for a large quantity.  </li>
      <li>After the first day, my face was glowing and healthy looking making me more confident in my appearance</li>
      <li>Absorbs very quickly and does not leave the skin looking oily.</li>
      <li>In the winter it&#x27;s great for top of hands when they get dry.  </li>
      <li>fabulous my skin looks radient use it with hydrolic acid</li>
      <li>Received it on 18th Mar, and so far so good.</li>
      <li>In general, it feels good, is silky smooth, and maybe if I didn&#x27;s use it, my skin would be aging faster than it is.  </li>
      <li>But that is ok as the first bottle got me hooked.  </li>
      <li>The cost savings are significant.  </li>
      <li>It penetrates well, quickly disappear and doesn&#x27;t make my oily skin look shiny.</li>
      <li>I have normal healthy skin</li>
      <li>you believe in the benefits of Matrixyl 3000 with respect to collagen growth and the moisturizing effectiveness of Hyaluronic acid, then this is just about the best deal out there for a highly concentrated and very high quality blend of those active</li>
      <li>Thank you sooooo much for making this product available.</li>
      <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ended up buying the refill because it&#x27;s an even better deal and the original bottle from the 1oz size is simple glass and will last for many refills.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Having said that, if you have deep furrows, it is not going to erase them but, fine lines have gone away or are significantly improved.</li>
      <li>They also provide a large dropper that makes refilling a smaller bottle very easy.  </li>
      <li>Got the first 1oz bottle at a steal compared to the price now.  </li>
      <li>:)......everybody will get a change to check out my skin, hair in the next couple of months on You Tube and see the products that I use here......</li>
      <li>After years of trying to find a product that really does provide and keep moisture without a scent and oily sheen &amp; feeling, I have become an avid supporter of this product.  </li>
      <li>a must have in your skin care regimen large bottle way to go</li>
      <li>then refill... keep the large size in refrigerator to preserve.  </li>
      <li>But short term are fine.</li>
      <li>Really 2 products in one:</li>
      <li>you really feel a difference in you</li>
      <li>Thanks to Amazon Reviews for introducing me to this product.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m no expert, but as a man that has used a good number of skin care products over the years-- many that were very expensive, I&#x27;ve gradually learned that few products actually deliver great results, there are only a few skin care ingredients that really make a notable difference and the rest is pretty much just packaging, branding, and marketing</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d recommend buying the smaller bottle first if you&#x27;re a first time buyer.  </li>
      <li>This does seem to make a positive difference in my skin, and it dries clear and \\&quot;unfelt\\&quot;.  </li>
      <li>Clearly it costs less in this size, although the outlay is more.</li>
      <li>Used with an internal collagen, that you ingest faithfully, you&#x27;ll be on the right track to aging gracefully.</li>
      <li>So far, nothing.</li>
      <li>I have tried other Matrixyl 3000 products at much higher prices.  </li>
      <li>Mature male.</li>
      <li>I was even asked for ID last year to prove I was old enough to buy wine!</li>
      <li>I use at night, but you can use it during the day -- put it on first and let it absorb a few minutes before applying makeup or sunscreen.  </li>
      <li>I put some drops of the serum  right into the face, and it leaves your skin tense and soft.</li>

<li> (I do wash our my old small bottle, dropper and add a little bit of bleach, but rinse very well and dry completely....</li>
<li> I had tried the small size and as soon as out, ordered the large size refill.  </li>
<li> I cannot know about long terms results.</li>
<li> - I expect it is the same as my other since it is a refill.</li>
<li> Do not use this product without a moisturizer as it will dry your skin</li>
<li> the peptides in this coupled with my regular hyaluronic acid twice daily keeps the firm texture of my skin.  </li>
<li> Have gone through multiple products usually in the pricey range above $100.</li>
<li> skin feel very dry and flaky.</li>
<li> /&gt;Since starting this regimen approximately four years ago, I have had numerous comments on how I keep looking younger.</li>
<li> A little goes a long way.</li>
<li> Have not started using it yet as have not used up other bottle.  </li>
<li> and I use less moisturizer so that is a plus on the wallet as well.  </li>
<li> This product is an adjunct to my serum that contains moisturizers and Palmityl Pentapeptide-3 which supercharges aging skin that is producing less collagen.</li>
<li> This is not a magic potion and probably won&#x27;t reverse your current skin damage, but if you want to prevent further aging and keep your skin as firm as possible, you&#x27;d be crazy not to have this in your arsenal.  </li>
<li> And usually they add oils, fragrances, colors, and other junk to it.  </li>
<li> Little does my youngest child realize.....</li>
<li> I have been using this Serum for a few years</li>
<li> I&#x27;m not sure why that is.</li>
<li> There&#x27;s no better deal anywhere, I&#x27;ve looked.  </li>
<li> It is hard to please me</li>
<li> Matrixyl 3000 (a combination of peptides commonly used in antiaging products to boost collagen production) in a hyaluronic acid serum (a non-greasy humectant moisturizer).  </li>
<li> Sad.</li>
<li> The bottle is very expensive.</li>
<li> and I don&#x27;t have bad skin to begin with...</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Really 2 products in one: Matrixyl 3000 (a combination of peptides commonly used in antiaging products to boost collagen production) in a hyaluronic acid serum (a non-greasy humectant moisturizer).  HA serum alone is often sold by high-end skincare companies for upwards of $50 for 1oz!  And usually they add oils, fragrances, colors, and other junk to it.  Here you&#x27;re getting a whopping 4oz and no junk.  There&#x27;s no better deal anywhere, I&#x27;ve looked.  This is not a magic potion and probably won&#x27;t reverse your current skin damage, but if you want to prevent further aging and keep your skin as firm as possible, you&#x27;d be crazy not to have this in your arsenal.  One bottle should last several months to a year depending on if you only use it on your face, or on neck, chest, tummy, upper arms, etc.  I use at night, but you can use it during the day -- put it on first and let it absorb a few minutes before applying makeup or sunscreen.  Good luck and happy firming!</li>
    <li> Have not started using it yet as have not used up other bottle.  Will give results when I do - I expect it is the same as my other since it is a refill.</li>
    <li> This does seem to make a positive difference in my skin, and it dries clear and \\&quot;unfelt\\&quot;.  Clearly it costs less in this size, although the outlay is more.</li>
    <li> fabulous my skin looks radient use it with hydrolic acid a must have in your skin care regimen large bottle way to go</li>
    <li> EXCELLENT EXPERIENCE WITH THIS PRODUCT - SKIN FELT FIRMER - ONE OF THE BEST SKIN PRODUCTS I HAVE EVER USED - WILL CONTINUE PURCHASING THIS PRODUCT AT TIMELESS BEAUTIFY PRODUCTS - THANK  YOU AMAZON FOR CARRYING THIS GREAT SKIN CARE PRODUCT -</li>
    <li> I love this serum.  I have tried other Matrixyl 3000 products at much higher prices.  This is the best product by far.  Thank you Timeless Skin Care for the reasonable price on this amazing product!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff!  Works well and has a great price point. I use it every day, skin looks amazing.</li>
    <li> I have been using this Serum for a few years and I love it. you really feel a difference in you skin moisture after applying it. Great!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product about 3 years.  Will not use anything else.  If you use it twice daily it will reduce....not erase.... the number of lines and wrinkles.</li>
    <li> Got the first 1oz bottle at a steal compared to the price now.  But that is ok as the first bottle got me hooked.  I love this stuff.  My skin feels great and I use it with any type of moisturizer and I use less moisturizer so that is a plus on the wallet as well.  I do see a difference.  Now I will tell you I am not one to get up and have a routine daily of using anything so what I am saying is I use it only whenever and it still works.  I might even work better if I did it all the time.  The lines on my forehead are going away and it makes the skin around my eyes tighter so the lines there as well are doing great.  Even the worry line between my eyebrows seems to be shrinking.  It is hard to please me and I know I have tried so many things.  So for the price I paid on the refill I will never let myself run out of this again.</li>
    <li> A good price for a large quantity.  I do believe this has improved my facial skin and diminished the saggy areas.</li>
    <li> I cannot know about long terms results. But short term are fine. I put some drops of the serum  right into the face, and it leaves your skin tense and soft. Afterwards I apply a moisturer, as per the instructions.</li>
    <li> No complaints... Love to use it when I needed.</li>
    <li> I have purchased this product twice. The reason why I purchased it again was because IT WORK!! My daughter keeps asking me &amp;#34;Mommy why do you put that stuff on your face for wrinkles.....you don&#x27;t have any!!&amp;#34;  Little does my youngest child realize.....this products is the reason why I don&#x27;t have any. The lines in my face have changed so dramatically and I couldn&#x27;t be happier about my results.  Thank you sooooo much for making this product available. I will never stop purchasing.  :-)</li>
    <li> I had tried the small size and as soon as out, ordered the large size refill.  (I do wash our my old small bottle, dropper and add a little bit of bleach, but rinse very well and dry completely.... then refill... keep the large size in refrigerator to preserve.  Great product and reasonable cost for 4 ounces!!!</li>
    <li> This is one of the best skin serums I&#x27;ve ever used - and I am very picky! After the first day, my face was glowing and healthy looking making me more confident in my appearance then I have been in years (I&#x27;m 49). Also, I feel the price is affordable; you definitely get a lot for your dollar. I will be a return customer for sure. Thanks Timeless Skin Care for a wonderful product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for 2 years now. Mature male. Have gone through multiple products usually in the pricey range above $100. Had read the reviews for awhile and decided to try out the product.  A little goes a long way. Absorbs very quickly and does not leave the skin looking oily. In the winter it&#x27;s great for top of hands when they get dry.  This refill is a huge bargin!! I&#x27;d recommend buying the smaller bottle first if you&#x27;re a first time buyer.  If re-ordering, this refill size is the way to go.  The cost savings are significant.  I&#x27;d estimate you&#x27;re getting about 4 bottles of the regular size.  They also provide a large dropper that makes refilling a smaller bottle very easy.  The dropper is too big to conveniently use when applying.  After years of trying to find a product that really does provide and keep moisture without a scent and oily sheen &amp; feeling, I have become an avid supporter of this product.  Thanks to Amazon Reviews for introducing me to this product.</li>
    <li> this  is some great serum love it thank you for the 4oz. and a great price also.</li>
    <li> I read the reviews and decide to try it. Received it on 18th Mar, and so far so good. It penetrates well, quickly disappear and doesn&#x27;t make my oily skin look shiny. Very good value too.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this item over a month now but there was no difference at all.&lt;br /&gt;It feels like water and the mail ingredient is water also.&lt;br /&gt;My skin feel very dry and flaky. I have normal healthy skin though.&lt;br /&gt;I saw all the good reviews but it doesn&#x27;t work for me at all.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using a lot of skin products, but I don&#x27;t trust this one.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m still using this, and have been for over a month, but I can&#x27;t tell if it&#x27;s being helpful or not. I use it faithfully every morning and every evening. Also, there is nothing on the side of the bottle that tells you what concentrate of Matrixyl 3000 is in this, only that it contains it. Now, here on Amazon, it says 8%, but it doesn&#x27;t say anything on the bottle. I&#x27;m not sure why that is. Maybe Timeless Skin Care can tell me, but if they put ingredients on Amazon, and we purchase based on that description, I would hope the bottle actually contains the same ingredients. The bottle is very expensive. But, anyway, at this writing (12/15/13), I have noticed NO difference in my skin...and I don&#x27;t have bad skin to begin with...I was just hoping for some tightening around the chin area. So far, nothing. Sad.</li>
    <li> Great stuff - great value!</li>
    <li> Seems to work well, I started using it a couple of years ago and it does keep wrinkles off and moisturize your skin</li>
    <li> the peptides in this coupled with my regular hyaluronic acid twice daily keeps the firm texture of my skin.  Used with an internal collagen, that you ingest faithfully, you&#x27;ll be on the right track to aging gracefully. :)......everybody will get a change to check out my skin, hair in the next couple of months on You Tube and see the products that I use here......</li>
    <li> I noticed relaxing of my deep lines within 2 weeks so I&#x27;m beginning to believe in this serum.</li>
    <li> This product is an adjunct to my serum that contains moisturizers and Palmityl Pentapeptide-3 which supercharges aging skin that is producing less collagen. Essentially, it increases collagen levels akin to women in their 20&#x27;s and 30&#x27;s. Matrixyl is a TETRApeptide and works in conjunction with the pentapeptide. Do not use this product without a moisturizer as it will dry your skin out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since starting this regimen approximately four years ago, I have had numerous comments on how I keep looking younger. I was even asked for ID last year to prove I was old enough to buy wine! I thought I misunderstood the man. When I told him my age, he said, &#x27;keep doing what you&#x27;re doing.&#x27;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Similarly, last month, I was told that I looked so youthful that I looked like a teenager. Having said that, if you have deep furrows, it is not going to erase them but, fine lines have gone away or are significantly improved.</li>
    <li> I have not found any difference after using the product for 1 month. There were no instructions for use in either the 4 oz refill or the 1 oz. I purchased both. .</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m no expert, but as a man that has used a good number of skin care products over the years-- many that were very expensive, I&#x27;ve gradually learned that few products actually deliver great results, there are only a few skin care ingredients that really make a notable difference and the rest is pretty much just packaging, branding, and marketing speak.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you believe in the benefits of Matrixyl 3000 with respect to collagen growth and the moisturizing effectiveness of Hyaluronic acid, then this is just about the best deal out there for a highly concentrated and very high quality blend of those active ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ended up buying the refill because it&#x27;s an even better deal and the original bottle from the 1oz size is simple glass and will last for many refills.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like this company&#x27;s style!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay.  Does not seem as effective as the 25% matrixyl product I have used.  In general, it feels good, is silky smooth, and maybe if I didn&#x27;s use it, my skin would be aging faster than it is.  My gut says any good department store brand of any  face cream would probably do as well.</li>
