      <li>I LOVE THIS MIRROR</li>

      <li>So glad I don&#x27;t have to lean over to use a counter model any more.</li>
      <li>As described - looks great in my new bathroom.</li>
      <li>Great so far, installed easy, looks good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Easy to install.  </li>
      <li>Sturdy, easy to mount, works as advertised.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
      <li>Installation was easy.</li>
      <li>Easy to install and extend.  </li>
      <li>Easy to install and works well,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;thanks</li>
      <li>It has a sturdy arm, and is easy to mount.  </li>
      <li>I wish that I hadn&#x27;t been a nice person...leaving a perfectly good mirror at my last home</li>
      <li>This is a highly specialized part, so good luck replacing it!&lt;br</li>
      <li>To me, it looks and feels cheap.</li>
      <li>It seems very sturdy, mounted easily on the wall, moves and adjusts smoothly.  </li>
      <li>It looks great and is extremely sturdy.</li>
      <li>and it is useful for that.  </li>
      <li>was a kid going to Carnival Fun Houses.</li>
      <li>Has held up very well and is very useful.</li>
      <li>price and quality  were right on for the product.  </li>
      <li>There is a great deal of distortion around the circumference that leaves a relatively small amount of &amp;#34;usable&amp;#34; mirror.  </li>
      <li>This was the exact thing I was looking for to install into one of my bathroom.  </li>
      <li>Exactly what I needed.</li>
      <li>Quality seems better than the last one we had.  </li>
      <li>But installation was simple and it looks ok.</li>
      <li>Exactly what we were looking for.  </li>
      <li>Very unimpressive, Amazon!</li>
      <li>AND NOW I AM ABLE TO SEE THE BACK OF HEAD WHEN DRYING MY HAIR</li>
      <li>The actual 5X mirror is the most distorted mirror I have looked into since is</li>
      <li>The recipient of the gift planted it on the wall too high for me to see, just right for him.  </li>
      <li>Some of these, the magnification is too high, this one is just right.</li>
      <li>The only positive thing I can say is that it was easy to install.</li>
      <li>You really can see the difference when you hold the two mirrors side-by-side.  </li>
      <li>Fast delivery</li>
      <li>Also, the magnifying mirror is very &amp;#34;distorting&amp;#34;.</li>
      <li>so I don&#x27;t have to bend down to the counter for a table top mirror.</li>
      <li>It was easy to install, but I did have to improvise a bit as the installation instructions were minimal.  </li>
      <li>Well constructed and easy to mount on a wall or other type of surface.</li>
      <li>There is a dizzying halo effect about 2&amp;#34; from the edge so you only have about 4&amp;#34; of useful mirror space, if you can stand to look into it.  </li>
      <li>Unlike my wife&#x27;s table top 5x mirror (also about 8&amp;#34;), in which the magnified image is clear almost all the way to the edge, this one only has a very small useful area (maybe 4&amp;#34;?)</li>
      <li>I purchased this item to replace a brass finished mirror that was in my new home.</li>
      <li>The chrome plating is much higher quality than the mirrors from the local shops</li>
      <li>and I don&#x27;t forsee the rusting issue I had with the previous cheap mirror.</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t use the magnification side very often but use the regular mirror side every day.  </li>
      <li>Still looks brand new, very solid construction.</li>
      <li>The only problem is that the screws and bolts included were too small to securely attach it-so had to go and buy longer ones.</li>
      <li>center of the magnified side is very clear, as it goes to the edges it becomes unclear.</li>

<li> It is pretty sturdy, not flimsy like I was afraid of.  </li>
<li> just a few weeks after installing the mirror.  </li>
<li> It was a waste of money because we bought it for the 5X mirror.</li>
<li> so I wouldn&#x27;t leave holes behind for the current owner.</li>

    <li> Gave it for a birthday gift.  I have one upstairs and moved it from TN to IN.  The recipient of the gift planted it on the wall too high for me to see, just right for him.  Guess I will be  buying a third one.  Love this mirror.</li>
    <li> I use it everyday! Love it!</li>
    <li> Great item installation was so easy and for 5he price the quality is outstanding. Would recommend to anyone looking for this type of item</li>
    <li> Great so far, installed easy, looks good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The center of the magnified side is very clear, as it goes to the edges it becomes unclear.</li>
    <li> Has held up very well and is very useful. I like how I can fold it flat when I need it out of the way. Still looks brand new, very solid construction. Pleased with purchase!</li>
    <li> Great addition to the bathroom - lots of uses.</li>
    <li> Some of these, the magnification is too high, this one is just right.</li>
    <li> Does just what it&#x27;s supposed to do.  Good quality.</li>
    <li> I bought this mirror after breaking the IKEA one that we had.  It seems very sturdy, mounted easily on the wall, moves and adjusts smoothly.  This is some distortion in the magnifying side, but it&#x27;s not really problematic for me.  It&#x27;s a good mirror for the price and I would definitely recommend it to others.</li>
    <li> This has been a good mirror.  I like having a mirror to see the back of my hair and it is useful for that.  Also nice to have the magnifying side for make-up.</li>
    <li> While this mirror is very nice looking, the 5x magnified side is terrible to look in.  There is a dizzying halo effect about 2&amp;#34; from the edge so you only have about 4&amp;#34; of useful mirror space, if you can stand to look into it.  Luckily, it only takes me a few minutes to put on my makeup.  Unfortunately I had it up on the wall before I realized how bad it was.  I would have returned it if I noticed this before.</li>
    <li> Easy to install.  Seems durable.  Fast delivery</li>
    <li> Mirror is very loose &amp; can&#x27;t be tightened. One of the screw threads on the base is stripped as well.</li>
    <li> Just what I wanted in my guest bathroom.  It&#x27;s a small vanity and the lighted mirrors are a bit overpowering.  This mounted easily, folds away nicely and is perfect!</li>
    <li> price and quality  were right on for the product.  Wife loves it.  and  it was the perfect house warming gift</li>
    <li> Very happy with my mirror&lt;br /&gt;Dies the job for me and husband also likes it.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I needed. As described - looks great in my new bathroom. Also, I got it within 48 hours!</li>
    <li> Very handy, sturdy, and adjusts to many positions.  Frees both hands to work on back of hair and still see what I&#x27;m doing</li>
    <li> I was using a counter style mirror before, but now love this wall mounted one!  I can now see properly to insert contacts and apply makeup!</li>
    <li> I gave this mirror 2 stars rather than 1 like I planned because it is inexpensive, so I would say for the money, it&#x27;s on the low end of what you would expect. To me, it looks and feels cheap. On top of that, it arrived poorly packed in a previously opened box and with screws rolling around everywhere. Very unimpressive, Amazon!</li>
    <li> Exactly what we were looking for.  Nice lines around the mirror.</li>
    <li> Works great.  Just as expected  So glad I don&#x27;t have to lean over to use a counter model any more.</li>
    <li> Well constructed and easy to mount on a wall or other type of surface. Works great.</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS MIRROR AND NOW I AM ABLE TO SEE THE BACK OF HEAD WHEN DRYING MY HAIR</li>
    <li> This was a gift and I was told by the recipient likes it. Easy to install and works well,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;thanks</li>
    <li> This was the exact thing I was looking for to install into one of my bathroom.  It is good quality and very easy to install.  The shipping was good as well.</li>
    <li> This wall mount mirror is great.  It looks great and is extremely sturdy. The chrome plating is much higher quality than the mirrors from the local shops and I don&#x27;t forsee the rusting issue I had with the previous cheap mirror.</li>
    <li> I am very satisfied with the two sided mirror.  It is pretty sturdy, not flimsy like I was afraid of.  My wife enjoys using it sitting instead of having to stand in front of the bathroom mirror leaning over the sink anymore.</li>
    <li> The only problem is that the screws and bolts included were too small to securely attach it-so had to go and buy longer ones.</li>
    <li> The Zadro Two Sided Dual Arm Wall Mounted Mirror is a great value for the price.  Easy to install and extend.  Perfect for makeup, ect.</li>
    <li> Very disappointed! Wish I would have spent the extra dollars and bought the Jerdon  that I bought previously. A much better mirror that I also purchased through Amazon!</li>
    <li> I purchased this because of the satin nickel finish. I have a chrome finish one in another bathroom that&#x27;s actually an 8X-1X, and it&#x27;s excellent. This one is lousy. The 5X magnification is a bit distorted, very cheap. The only positive thing I can say is that it was easy to install.</li>
    <li> I love that this mirror is attached to the wall so I don&#x27;t have to bend down to the counter for a table top mirror.</li>
    <li> Sturdy, easy to mount, works as advertised.&lt;br /&gt;The swing works with ease.&lt;br /&gt;Only Con is that it&#x27;s slightly bigger than I expected.</li>
    <li> I purchased this wall-mounted 1x / 5x mirror as a present for my wife.  She has a counter top 1x / 5x mirror but needed something she could use while standing in front of the sink.  Unfortunately, this particular brand / model has some shortcomings, the biggest of which is the design of the mounting hardware.  At the points where the mirror hinge mounts to the base, there are two fragile plastic grommets and one of these broke just a few weeks after installing the mirror.  Therefore, the hinge is loose and the mirror arm has up and down play in it.  This is a highly specialized part, so good luck replacing it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then there is the 5x side of the mirror itself (the magnifying / concave side).  Unlike my wife&#x27;s table top 5x mirror (also about 8&amp;#34;), in which the magnified image is clear almost all the way to the edge, this one only has a very small useful area (maybe 4&amp;#34;?) in the center of the mirror and seemingly over distorts the image at the edges.  You really can see the difference when you hold the two mirrors side-by-side.  Ultimately it didn&#x27;t meet the WAF (Wife Acceptance Factor), so I ended up ordering a different mirror and trashing this one.</li>
    <li> This product is of good quality. It has a sturdy arm, and is easy to mount.  I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> My wife wanted a wall-mount mirror with a magnifying option.  This product is perfect and just what she wanted.  It was easy to install, but I did have to improvise a bit as the installation instructions were minimal.  Even so, I had the mirror installed in our bathroom in 10 minutes.</li>
    <li> I am very disappointed with the quality of the mirror.  There is a great deal of distortion around the circumference that leaves a relatively small amount of &amp;#34;usable&amp;#34; mirror.  I had hoped that, once it had been mounted to the wall, I would adjust to the limited area without distortion.  Not the case!  I have owned similarly priced wall mounted mirrors in the past and never experienced this type of poor quality. I feel as if I&#x27;m stuck with it because it&#x27;s mounted to the wall with molly bolts.  I wish that I hadn&#x27;t been a nice person...leaving a perfectly good mirror at my last home so I wouldn&#x27;t leave holes behind for the current owner.</li>
    <li> The 5X magnification is perfect for applying makeup without my glasses on.  And the wall mount is so convenient.  Well made, too.</li>
    <li> NIce finish.  Quality seems better than the last one we had.  A little difficult to move , but will probably loosen up after use.</li>
    <li> Good product. I purchased this item to replace a brass finished mirror that was in my new home. Installation was easy.</li>
    <li> Very nice mirror.  Don&#x27;t use the magnification side very often but use the regular mirror side every day.  Mounted nicely.  Sturdy.  Great value.</li>
    <li> For price, construction is a bit flimsy. Also, the magnifying mirror is very &amp;#34;distorting&amp;#34;. But installation was simple and it looks ok.</li>
    <li> The metal construction of the mirror is good quality and attractive. The actual 5X mirror is the most distorted mirror I have looked into since is was a kid going to Carnival Fun Houses. It was a waste of money because we bought it for the 5X mirror.</li>
