### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>I found this one &amp; it was perfect for my needs.</li>
      <li>The material isn&#x27;t fraying anywhere and the zipper is still working perfectly.</li>
      <li>&lt;br /&gt;And not the best quality.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>so that was perfect in my situation.</li>
      <li>Beautifully made, with sturdy protectors.</li>
      <li>&amp; I know eventually it will break but all in all it was still a great buy</li>
      <li>Happy with the purchase.</li>
      <li>This is a very nice case, holds all my plates.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Good quality&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended</li>
      <li>I have a bunch of plates from bundle monster, mash and shany and they fit perfectly in here.</li>
      <li>Good quality and Shipping about a  month.</li>
      <li>Daughter loved it for her nail stamping collection.</li>
      <li>/&gt;However, all in all good product.</li>
      <li>And plates from Bundle Monster fit perfectly inside.</li>
      <li>But good for organizing and not scratching the pueen plates</li>
      <li>Very nice, and it holds many plates.</li>
      <li>I love this!</li>
      <li>&amp; I love it!</li>

      <li>LOVE!</li>
      <li>I love it!  </li>
      <li>looks nice too.  </li>
      <li>Nice case for my girlfriends plates.  </li>
      <li>This is a very nice, pretty case with a sturdy construction.</li>
      <li>and it keeps them organized and safe from damage.</li>
      <li>IS ALREADY HAVE EVERYTHING OK, RECOMMEND</li>
      <li>Adorable, fits so many plates.</li>
      <li>, it looks more like a mauve color; I love it.</li>
      <li>Absolutely love my PUEEN stamp organizer.</li>
      <li>thought it was going to be kind of cheap</li>
      <li>The Pueen ones are better than the Bundle Monster ones (in my opinion) because they have an opening/slot to place plates on both sides of the sheet/page.</li>
      <li>Cute case for holding all of your stamping plates</li>
      <li>Would have preferred if looked more like the picture-</li>
      <li>and I love the design.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s held together with three metal rivits that are nice and secure.</li>
      <li>With that being said my collection of nail plates grew quickly &amp; I wanted to have a nicely organized, safe place to store them.</li>
      <li>Perfect storage for my PUEEN and other same-sized plates.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m in love, so far so good.  </li>
      <li>The plate protectors are fantastic quality.</li>
      <li>All my plates fit</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m excited I have somewhere to store them.</li>
      <li>The inside is nice &amp; sturdy &amp; I love that the pages are double sided to maximize storage space.</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t fit octagonal plates very well but is perfect for square or round ones!</li>
      <li>I couldn&#x27;t fit two of my octagon plates, but that&#x27;s ok all of my other plates fit fine.  </li>
      <li>There are actually a good number of pages, 14 to be exact front and back.</li>
      <li>&amp; I would buy another if I need more storage in the future.</li>
      <li>does the job, kinda pretty.</li>
      <li>I will be repurchasing (probably in a different color) when I need more room.</li>
      <li>While this one doesn&#x27;t have sleeves in which to slide the larger plates, you can still put them in there easily (between pages of sleeves rather than in one sleeve) and zip it up</li>
      <li>My book didn&#x27;t have the little crown on it that says &amp;#34;Pueen&amp;#34; but it honestly doesn&#x27;t bother me.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s also really sturdy and doesn&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s going to start coming apart</li>
      <li>I really like it, but it has some beauty imperfections.&lt;br</li>
      <li>inner surfaces wasn&#x27;t smooth and it has bubbles .&lt;br</li>
      <li>Metal logo on the front fell off (not glued on very well)</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve filled one completely and it is holding up nicely so far.</li>
      <li>It is very classy looking, the lace looks like it is real.  </li>
      <li>It is just has described, very durable, you can see the plates very clearly through the clear vinyl slots, both sides.  </li>
      <li>and it still looks brand new.</li>
      <li>It seems like it will break in the near future because it feels flimsy &amp; gets stuck around the whole way of the case &amp; never is anything blocking the zipper.</li>
      <li>was pleasantly surprised.</li>
      <li>Although many of her other brands will not fit in the sleeves.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s light pink with a black lace overlay.</li>
      <li>I used to waste so much time going through all of my plates; now I keep them all in one--this thing holds A LOT of plates!</li>
      <li>I really love this holder for my small round plates.</li>
      <li>I got this one because I have both round and large plates, and I wanted to store them in the same case.</li>

<li> graat holder for your round plates.  </li>
<li> The only complaint (&amp; reason for my giving 4 out of 5 stars) is that the zipper is a bit questionable.</li>
<li> I have to tug hard sometimes to keep the zipper going</li>

    <li> All my plates fit and I love the design. It protects them from scratching like when my daughter is &amp;#34;looking&amp;#34; I don&#x27;t  have to worry she is scraping them agains each other or getting cut with the sharp metal.</li>
    <li> Adorable, fits so many plates. I got this one because I have both round and large plates, and I wanted to store them in the same case. While this one doesn&#x27;t have sleeves in which to slide the larger plates, you can still put them in there easily (between pages of sleeves rather than in one sleeve) and zip it up and it keeps them organized and safe from damage. I love it!</li>
    <li> does the job, kinda pretty. Would have preferred if looked more like the picture- like having the metal crown in the corner (it doesnt have it in person).</li>
    <li> Just what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> Cute case for holding all of your stamping plates</li>
    <li> LOVE! Beautifully made, with sturdy protectors. I love the way the black lace looks over the nude/pink base color. My book didn&#x27;t have the little crown on it that says &amp;#34;Pueen&amp;#34; but it honestly doesn&#x27;t bother me. It&#x27;s held together with three metal rivits that are nice and secure. No movement from them at all. The plate protectors are fantastic quality. No flaws whatsoever. I will be repurchasing (probably in a different color) when I need more room.</li>
    <li> This is a very nice case, holds all my plates.&lt;br /&gt;I thought it was going to be kind of cheap&lt;br /&gt;And not the best quality.&lt;br /&gt;I was pleasantly surprised. Good quality&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s pretty and keeps my small plates organized!</li>
    <li> Very nice, and it holds many plates. The fabric on the outside is a tad bit loose/wrinkly though.</li>
    <li> IS ALREADY HAVE EVERYTHING OK, RECOMMEND</li>
    <li> I love it!  I used to waste so much time going through all of my plates; now I keep them all in one--this thing holds A LOT of plates!</li>
    <li> graat holder for your round plates.  looks nice too.  will only hold round plates, this is the only negative thing</li>
    <li> This is a very nice, pretty case with a sturdy construction.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love my PUEEN stamp organizer. It is so sturdy and the plastic pages aren&#x27;t flimsy at all. There are actually a good number of pages, 14 to be exact front and back. And plates from Bundle Monster fit perfectly inside. I can&#x27;t wait to fill it up. Also the silver PUEEN emblem pictured on Amazon was not actually on my case. No big deal but just part of the review.</li>
    <li> I just received this case.  It is my valentine gift from my husband, he purchase it through amazon.  It is very classy looking, the lace looks like it is real.  I couldn&#x27;t fit two of my octagon plates, but that&#x27;s ok all of my other plates fit fine.  It is just has described, very durable, you can see the plates very clearly through the clear vinyl slots, both sides.  I&#x27;m in love, so far so good.  Hope it holds up well.  Would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Nice case for my girlfriends plates.  Although many of her other brands will not fit in the sleeves.  But good for organizing and not scratching the pueen plates</li>
    <li> I recently started nail stamping &amp; I love it! With that being said my collection of nail plates grew quickly &amp; I wanted to have a nicely organized, safe place to store them. I found this one &amp; it was perfect for my needs. It&#x27;s light pink with a black lace overlay. The inside is nice &amp; sturdy &amp; I love that the pages are double sided to maximize storage space. It did not have the Pueen logo on the front cover as it is pictured but I preferred not to have anything at all on it so that was perfect in my situation. The only complaint (&amp; reason for my giving 4 out of 5 stars) is that the zipper is a bit questionable. It seems like it will break in the near future because it feels flimsy &amp; gets stuck around the whole way of the case &amp; never is anything blocking the zipper. I have to tug hard sometimes to keep the zipper going &amp; I know eventually it will break but all in all it was still a great buy &amp; I would buy another if I need more storage in the future.</li>
    <li> I really like it, but it has some beauty imperfections.&lt;br /&gt;The inner surfaces wasn&#x27;t smooth and it has bubbles .&lt;br /&gt;However, all in all good product.</li>
    <li> Metal logo on the front fell off (not glued on very well)</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t fit octagonal plates very well but is perfect for square or round ones!</li>
    <li> Good quality and Shipping about a  month. Happy with the purchase.</li>
    <li> I love this! I have a bunch of plates from bundle monster, mash and shany and they fit perfectly in here. There is room for so many too! I just bought another 25pc stamp plate collection and I&#x27;m excited I have somewhere to store them. I chose the pink with black lace and it&#x27;s not very pink at all, it looks more like a mauve color; I love it. It&#x27;s also really sturdy and doesn&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s going to start coming apart anywhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: I&#x27;ve had this for a while now and I added some pictures of it, I use it a lot and it still looks brand new. The material isn&#x27;t fraying anywhere and the zipper is still working perfectly. I&#x27;ll definitely get another one when I run out of space in this one.</li>
    <li> Daughter loved it for her nail stamping collection.</li>
    <li> Perfect storage for my PUEEN and other same-sized plates. What a relief to have them all in one place!</li>
    <li> I really love this holder for my small round plates. The Pueen ones are better than the Bundle Monster ones (in my opinion) because they have an opening/slot to place plates on both sides of the sheet/page. In the BM ones, you have to put them both into the same slot (just facing different directions). The binder is sturdy. I&#x27;ve filled one completely and it is holding up nicely so far.</li>
