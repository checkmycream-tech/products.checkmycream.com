<li> The seal on the bottle is loose, so that much of the acetone evaporated even when shut as tightly as I could.</li>
<li> The product itself works well, and the seller shipped it quickly, but the packaging is poor.</li>
<li> I would not recommend anyone to buy other than for regular nail polish...</li>
<li> It removed my red polish with no tint left behind.</li>
<li> doesn&#x27;t seem to be very harsh on the nails.</li>
<li> I assume this would  take off my fake gel acrylic nails being 100% acetone</li>
<li> Very poor quality and very disappointing.</li>
<li> Very disappointed in this product.</li>

    <li> I assume this would  take off my fake gel acrylic nails being 100% acetone but it did not! it does work great for just regular nail polish though</li>
    <li> GREAT purchase. Much larger size than what I can get locally in the store for a lot better price. Will buy again!</li>
    <li> It did not work well at all. It feels like water. Also after using it, still left the polish on. Very poor quality and very disappointing.</li>
    <li> I cannot believe that people don&#x27;t love this product. It removed my red polish with no tint left behind. I have never used a remover that has removed so cleanly.</li>
    <li> Works great and fast, just as expected.</li>
    <li> What can I say, it&#x27;s acetone and I use it to remove my shellac polish rather than those pricy wipes, works great!</li>
    <li> Acetone, what can I say? Works well, takes the paint off everything when spilt all over but hubby lol. I use mine in a pump, its great for cleaning my nail art brushes, etc.</li>
    <li> Perfect!! i gave myself a gel takeoff at home by using the same techniques the salon techs use (some alluminum foil) and this acetone!! Worked perfectly! i also bought one of those scraping tools from Amazon so that helped</li>
    <li> Very disappointed in this product. I bought it to remove my gel nail polish. Which was not something that happened. I had to buy another bottle from another company. But I just naturally thought that acetone should be the same regardless of who the company was,..especially a name like Cutex...big mistake...I would not recommend anyone to buy other than for regular nail polish...I guess it will do that.</li>
    <li> I had ordered this product while deployed out to sea. I would give myself gel manicures while on the boat and what I love about this product is that it does what it says it does.</li>
    <li> works better than just regular nail polish remover that you could pick up at a store and it arrived on time</li>
    <li> the product really works great. I don&#x27;t have any problems with cutex. good brand. its removes glitter polish where as the non acetone does not remove very good if at all. doesn&#x27;t seem to be very harsh on the nails. works real good taking acrylic nails off. I really like this polish remover. works great. shipping was fast too 1 day.</li>
    <li> I bought this to remove my gel polish, and it works wonderfully..... Even on glitter polish...I would purchase again when I run out</li>
    <li> Works well. It takes off my stubborn nail polish I had on for months. Lol because of the regular nail polish didn&#x27;t take it off at all.</li>
    <li> The product itself works well, and the seller shipped it quickly, but the packaging is poor. The seal on the bottle is loose, so that much of the acetone evaporated even when shut as tightly as I could.</li>
    <li> great price great item</li>
