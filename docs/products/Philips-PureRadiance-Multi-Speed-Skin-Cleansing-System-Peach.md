      <li>You can take the Pure Radiance into the shower which is a great feature.&lt;br</li>
      <li>skin is very, very fair, freckled and a bit on the sensitive side.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
      <li>Sonicare is much better.</li>
      <li>all this could be better in many ways, I am returning it.</li>
      <li>I love most about this</li>
      <li>This brush by Philips has some interesting innovations, but I am not so sure that they are an improvement over the Clarisonic:  1.</li>
      <li>My skin is cleaner and more radiant.</li>
      <li>I feel a bit rushed when I&#x27;m doing the over the forehead into the nose area cycle, and that I&#x27;d like some more time.</li>
      <li>Though I haven&#x27;t had this six months, it seems more aligned with what my skin likes because it cleans without being abrasive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>and I used Neutrogena Healthy Skin Boosters Cleanser or Neutrogena Pore Refining exfoliating cleanser with this cleansing system.  </li>
      <li>also love how my skin feels after using the PureRadiance.  </li>
      <li>* ~1 minute cleansing cycle should work for most people</li>
      <li>think that my skin looks better after the month I have been using it.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve noticed that after using this compared to washing by hand, my skin seems softer and more even-toned.</li>
      <li>My wife has also used the device to help cleanse her neck and was equally pleased with the results and how her skin</li>
      <li>I absolutely LOVE about the PureRadiance</li>
      <li>So people with arthritis or carpal tunnel should be able to use this without worrying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The sonicare product I bought lasted many years and worked well.</li>
      <li>However, I love this product.</li>
      <li>but it also gets into the nooks and crannies better (like the corners of my nose).  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m just so glad that I don&#x27;t need to pay for facials anymore.  </li>
      <li>really love this product.  </li>
      <li>number one feature for me is being able to use it in the shower.  </li>
      <li>I use it every day and have come to love the brush.  </li>
      <li>Not too sure why this is.</li>
      <li>Try different amounts and see which works best for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a lot more flexible than the Clarisonic.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had many facials and my skin tends to redden after them.  </li>
      <li>I LOVE this product.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t see a need to use it more than that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Within 2 weeks of use, the acne has subsided significantly and since I have not changed anything except my cleansing method, I feel that my cleaner and medication is getting in deeper for more effective, visible</li>
      <li>Its just wonderful to have clean and clear skin all the time.</li>
      <li>love the color, and how easily it charges.  </li>
      <li>- it&#x27;s easy to use and will work well for almost all skin types, however there are more affordable options out there, this one I think is a bit on the pricey side.  </li>
      <li>The Philips PureRadiance Skin Cleansing System is an excellent beauty aid to deep clean pores and rejuvenate the skin through increased blood circulation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Again, in my opinion it&#x27;s a better fit for me.</li>
      <li>Most importantly a longer cycle.</li>
      <li>It offers deeper cleaning which is great for pores.</li>
      <li>I recommend using a mild cleansing solution, unless your skin can withstand very strong cleaning.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I feel like my original Clarisonic is better in this respect.  </li>
      <li>It grips your face and follows along the contours easily.</li>
      <li>So easy to use, again just like Sonicare toothbrushes.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s easy to use and you can take it into the shower.  </li>
      <li>You can clean your face twice a day with this product safely however.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Ergonomic design makes it easy to hold - even in the shower&lt;br /</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s easy to use and it prevents breakouts.&lt;br</li>
      <li>However, those can easily be added to a toiletries case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>(Just make sure you buy from an authorized retailer for full warranty coverage.)</li>
      <li>best part is that it felt like a lot less work than my scrubbing routine</li>
      <li>/&gt;In reality, the PureRadiance and the Clarisonic are very similar - both do a great job with cleaning skin, are easy to charge, can be used in the shower, brush heads are easy to replace, and both hold a charge so you can take them for a weekend trip without taking the base.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>system is super easy to use - the heads snap on easily and remove just as easily.  </li>
      <li>If a gentle, light, easy to use brush is what you want, the Philips PureRadiance is a nice choice.</li>
      <li>The exfoliating head is great, but really only needs to be used twice a week.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I received this product for free, but when I looked it up to see what the going price was, I was in shock.</li>
      <li>After 1 minute the system turns off, although you can easily turn it on again if you wish to clean your skin even more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>People can use it as they see fit.  </li>
      <li>brush is light and not clunky at all.  </li>
      <li>Even though it doesn&#x27;t feel like it is doing the intense cleaning it claims, I was impressed that it actually does!  </li>
      <li>Over the years the batteries in their products have been very reliable - more so than most brands.</li>
      <li>After using the brush, one&#x27;s face feels silky smooth and super clean, in fact, one feels radiant!  </li>
      <li>It would be marriage sabotage to say she looks any more or less beautiful because of a cleansing system, so</li>
      <li>When you push the button once, nice gentle rotation of the brush; if you push it twice, faster rotations for a deeper clean.</li>
      <li>This is a good feature, as in the winter when my skin is dry, a gentler speed is better for my skin.&lt;br /&gt;2.  </li>

    <li> It&#x27;s ok, but can&#x27;t say I&#x27;m too impressed. The battery last only for one time use, you need to keep charge it.</li>
    <li> I have used a Clarisonic Mia brush for more than two years, and although I like it, I&#x27;ve read that the Clarisonic brush can be too harsh.  So, I was interested to try the Philips PureRadiance brush.  First, the differences:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.  The Philips PureRadiance brush has two speeds, one is gentle and the other is a more intense option.  This is a good feature, as in the winter when my skin is dry, a gentler speed is better for my skin.&lt;br /&gt;2.  The Philips PureRadiance brush has rotating bristles plus an pulsing feeling.  The brush head is smaller than Clarisonic, so it is easy to use in small areas such as between your nose and mouth.&lt;br /&gt;3.  Similar to the Philips toothbrush, the PureRadiance brush has three timed sessions of 20 seconds each for three zones of your face.  This is beneficial if you have a tendency to over scrub or irritate your skin.&lt;br /&gt;4.  The PureRadiance brush is smaller and lighter than the Clarisonic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The PureRadiance is a different experience from the Clarisonic.  It&#x27;s not bad, just different.  If this is your first facial brush, I think you will like the PureRadiance quite a bit.  If you currently use a different brush, you&#x27;ll need to compare features.  If a gentle, light, easy to use brush is what you want, the Philips PureRadiance is a nice choice.</li>
    <li> I like this skin cleansing system.  Got it for my wife to try but she let it sit on the sink counter for days so I took it to try it myself.  I have a very oily skin and I used Neutrogena Healthy Skin Boosters Cleanser or Neutrogena Pore Refining exfoliating cleanser with this cleansing system.  For the first few days I used the softer setting and skin felt  slightly irritated in the beginning.  Maybe I was pressing it too hard on my skin.  After a week and less irritation is experienced I switched to setting 2.  I also noticed for the first few days I could see a layer of grayish foam on the bristle head and as days passed the color became lighter and lighter.  I like the way the skin felt after the cleansing and wife also noticed difference when she felt my facial skin.</li>
    <li> I have been using the Clarasonic Mia 2 for a few years now and while it&#x27;s OK I always felt it was lacking in someway even though I couldn&#x27;t put my finger on it it just didn&#x27;t do the job for me and my face never really showed much of an improvement with or without it.  In the past few months I&#x27;ve pretty much stopped using it entirely so the PureRadiance was well timed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I absolutely LOVE about the PureRadiance is that it has two speeds - so you really can make this work for your face.  I like the smaller head vs. the Mia - I feel it does not only a better job of cleaning but it also gets into the nooks and crannies better (like the corners of my nose).  My face is overall softer after each use as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also really enjoy the timer feature - it doesn&#x27;t stop but pauses three times during the minute cycle to let you know it&#x27;s time to move onto the next section of your face.  While it&#x27;s not a necessity, it&#x27;s a nice reminder for when you&#x27;re daydreaming in the shower!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The exfoliation brush is quite wonderful and seems to do a great job of getting off dead or flaking skin.  Just make sure that you only use this once a week and replace it with the normal brush after the use (I accidentally forgot to replace this and did two exfoliations in a row, oops).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, the look of the product is great but my husband gave me a side eye and asked me WTF did I have charging in the bathroom.  It does look a little... phallic... so keep that in mind if you leave it out in the open charging.  Ha!  The roundness of the product also makes it hard to sit down in the shower without rolling around which can be a pain.</li>
    <li> Aside from the price tag, I like this product a lot. I&#x27;ve noticed that after using this compared to washing by hand, my skin seems softer and more even-toned. There are two speeds which can help those with sensitive skin, or if you ever have irritated areas that need to be gently cleansed until healed. You can get the cleaner wet, which makes using it while in the shower and cleaning the brush ten times easier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When cleaning the brush, I&#x27;ve found that running it under water until suds at the base of the bristles stop appearing, then using a dry towel is best. I also remove the head and dry inside near the handle near rubber seal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing I would recommend is to use about half the cleaner your normally would use washing by hand. I apply the cleaner directly to the brush head and apply some to both cheeks, nose, and forehead. After that I clean each area as directed (each zone for twenty seconds.) Because you aren&#x27;t losing any cleanser on your hands, you won&#x27;t need as much using the Philips PureRadiance. Try different amounts and see which works best for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My other piece of advice is that it will take a few times to get used to using this. The first few times, I kept thinking my face wasn&#x27;t clean because it felt too fast. But because of the sonic pulses, it cleans deeper with fewer passes. So even though it takes less time than washing by hand, it is cleaning deeper. You also don&#x27;t want to over wash your face, because it can strip oils and dry out your skin, similar to hair. You can clean your face twice a day with this product safely however.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The included travel pouch is nice, but it only holds the handle and one attached head, which I was disappointed about. It would have been nice to have more room for attachments. However, those can easily be added to a toiletries case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only complaint I have really is about the heads. They are labeled which which they are, as in regular, exfoliating, etc. However, they don&#x27;t label how often you can use them. I believe the exfoliation head can only be used once a week. It tells you that in the manual, but I rarely keep them. It would have been nice to add that to the brush head, under the label. Aside from that, I really don&#x27;t have any complaints,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, it is pricey. Over time, if you use less cleanser as I mentioned that can save some money, depending on how expensive your cleanser is. The other benefit is also having clearer and healthier skin. If that is something you are looking for, I would highly recommend purchasing PureRadiance.y don&#x27;t label how often you can use them. I believe the exfoliation head can only be used once a week.

    <li> I really like the Phillips face cleansing brush. It grips your face and follows along the contours easily. It&#x27;s a lot more flexible than the Clarisonic. However, the actual brush head is quite small compared to the Clarisonic and therefore, you have to move the Phillips brush around a lot more. I appreciated the extra brush head because replacement heads on other brands are really expensive. Note that you can buy a sensitive skin head if needed. The timer is a neat feature as well.  Overall, this is a good product that deep cleans just as well as more expensive brands.</li>
    <li> This is a really neat product that I never thought I&#x27;d ever want to use. But since I got this as part of the Amazon Vine program, I went ahead and gave it a shot. My wife didn&#x27;t have much interest in trying this out, so I used it myself. As I&#x27;m trying to age gracefully, I&#x27;ve been learning a lot about mens skincare recently, most importantly, that when you shower/cleanse your skin, you need to finish with a cold rinse to close off your pores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The unit comes with the normal and exfoliating brush. I&#x27;ve only used the normal brush, which I found to be very soft. I can&#x27;t imagine how much different the sensitive skin one would be, as I found the normal one to be quite easy on the skin. The only way to explain the cleansing action is like a bunch of little tiny fingers gently gliding across the surface of your face. The instructions tell you how to divide your face up into three quadrants for cleaning through the timed 20 second cycles. This is the only area in which I have a complaint. I wish that the unit was more like the Sonicare toothbrushes and had multiple cycles to chose from. Most importantly a longer cycle. I feel a bit rushed when I&#x27;m doing the over the forehead into the nose area cycle, and that I&#x27;d like some more time. That&#x27;s not to say that you can&#x27;t start another cycle, and then use it on your neck also which is that I normally do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My one fear was unfounded, and that was cleaning around the eye area. I was afraid that cleaning product would be thrown into the eyes when cleaning. Amazingly there is nothing thrown from the brushes so you can clean without getting anything into your eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Reading the instructions, I was a little upset, they explicitly tell you not to use homemade facial cleaners on the brush. Not too sure why this is. Worst case, I could see it messing up the brushes, and not the unit, so I may try anyway. I&#x27;ve really been trying to use more natural products since there are so many parabens in skin care products.</li>
    <li> I have been wanting an electronic skin cleanser for SO LONG! And now I finally have one! I love this thing, with a few caveats.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-It holds a charge FOREVER. I&#x27;ve had it for a month, and have not had to recharge it. I&#x27;ve used it 2-3 dozens cycles and it has sat unused for about 5 days without losing charge.&lt;br /&gt;-Can be used in the shower and put under running water&lt;br /&gt;-It cleans very gently. The exfoliating head is great, but really only needs to be used twice a week.&lt;br /&gt;-it has a timer that goes off every 20 seconds to tell you to clean a different zone of your face (left cheek, right cheek, forehead and nose). Very similar to a sonicare toothbrush&lt;br /&gt;-heads are very easily changed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-hard to clean the heads. I use it with an Epicuren facial cleanser which foams quite a lot. Even just using a little bit, I have to rinse it forever.&lt;br /&gt;-the little plastic covers for the heads (to protect when not in use), don&#x27;t stay on well. When they do click in place, they have a tendency to deform the bristles</li>
    <li> Good product, it brush gentle and it includes 2 different brushes.</li>
    <li> OMG, This is the first facial cleaning machine I&#x27;ve ever purchased and used. I heard a lot not-so-impressed feedback from others who have had clearsonic and didn&#x27;t use for long. However, I love this product. It made my face looks clean and shinny.  I will stick with it as long as the product last.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about a month. I have combination skin and my skin is, getting close to elderly but not yet sagging. That means I do not want to pull and stretch it.  However, my hobbies include gardening, walking and playing outside with the dogs and doing projects around the house.  I don&#x27;t wear a lot of makeup, but I do end up with dirt, sweat, and flecks of pain on my skin.  The idea of being able to wash this away without overdoing it, as I tend to do with facial scrubs and wash cloths, was very attractive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think that my skin looks better after the month I have been using it.  It definitely hasn&#x27;t made my skin dry.  It&#x27;s easy to use and you can take it into the shower.  I don&#x27;t think I see any difference in the skin tone though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely recommended.</li>
    <li> I had a Clairisonic Pro in the past, and while I will say the sonic vibrations don&#x27;t seem as strong, this unit cleans just as well (if not better) in half the time, and it&#x27;s really comfortable and easy to use. The brush head isn&#x27;t as large, but the brush head itself feels a lot more comfortable, and a lot less like sandpaper as the Clairisonic brush head did. The PureRadiance is much lighter and more ergonomic to hold and is half the price of a Clairisonic. Again, in my opinion it&#x27;s a better fit for me. Not to mention my Clairisonic stopped charging after a year, and I paid a hefty sum for it. As with other reviewers, I think the charging base for the PureRadience leaves a little to be desired - it seems a bit flimsy, it charges the unit just fine and hasn&#x27;t caused me any issues. In my opinion, even with the charging base, this still gets 5 stars especially given their competitors reliability and cost. So glad I purchased this!</li>
    <li> I have been a dedicated Clarisonic user for years and was given the Philips Pure Radiance Cleaning System to try even though I was skeptical.  I would say the biggest difference in the two products is the gentleness of the Phillips system.  Even though it doesn&#x27;t feel like it is doing the intense cleaning it claims, I was impressed that it actually does!  After using it, my skin is left clean (no makeup residue), soft, with a subtle glow (not irritated skin).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product is light weight and takes up very little counter top space; I like that it stands up.  I also think that it holds a charge well.  I found the protective cap for the brush head to be a bit difficult to place securely--other than that it is a quality product that is comparable to the Clarisonic.  If you are trying to decide between the two, I think if you like a more gentle feel on your skin or have very sensitive skin, you should consider the Pure Radiance as it is not as aggressive-feeling on the skin as the Clarisonic, yet does the same work in terms of cleaning and it is not likely to cause irritation to your skin.</li>
    <li> This is a really user friendly facial washing device.  I love that it stays charrged a long time and the handle fits nicely in my hand.  The brush has soft bristles but cleans very effectively with very little soap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My acne literally disappeared in two days and has stayed that way.  I use Body Shop TeaTree cleansers which I&#x27;ve used before but this seems to have done the trick for my combination skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have had a Clarisonic MIA which was abrasive and stopped working within 6 months.  Though I haven&#x27;t had this six months, it seems more aligned with what my skin likes because it cleans without being abrasive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> This is the worst piece of junk that I have ever bought. I purchased this in March and it will not work at all. I spent a lot of  money for this and an extra brush head and cannot use either one. Not to mention, it only did a mediocre job of cleansing my skin to begin with as compared to sonicare that I had in the past. The sonicare product I bought lasted many years and worked well. Their company was much better too because they automatically offtered a free replacement if it had only been in use 3 years. Do not buy this product. Sonicare is much better. I just thought I would try because of the advertising that said it cleaned 10 times better than by hand versus sonicare saying it was less. Boy was that false advertisement. What a joke and what a lot of money for a terrible product with terrible return policy. I am a nurse practitioner and very well educated.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t tried any other one but this product works very well. Skin cleaner than ever!</li>
    <li> Four years ago I bought a generic version of the Clarisonic called the Nutrasonic. My little Nutrasonic quickly became my favorite four speed facial powerhouse. I loved my Nutrasonic (and still do) but sadly the company has decided to discontinue the brushes so my favorite little machine is no more. Hence I started shopping for a replacement and as before when I bought my Nutrasonic I was dead set on not getting a Clarisonic because of the high price of the machine. I came across the Philips Pure Radiance on Costco’s website and decided to order it thinking I would be happy with it since not only Costco but Amazon has rave reviews for the machine. I got the Philips yesterday and let me tell you this facial brush sucks big time. If you are used the battery operated facial brushes they sell at Wal-Mart, then you may like this weak inadequate machine, but if you are used to a powerhouse cleaner and exfoliater you will absolutely hate this machine as I did. First off, the Philips has only two speeds which are pretty slow. The brushes are super soft (even the supposed stiff pore cleansing brush) and the annoying timer that turns off the machine every 20 seconds to apparently remind stupid people to move to a different spot.  This machine was so weak and truthfully, I hated everything about this cleansing system as it did not leave my skin feeling clean what so ever. If you have super sensitive skin then perhaps this machine will be okay for you but those desiring a pore cleansing will be greatly disappointed. Beyond how weak the machine is in hindsight I should have thought about my current dilemma before ordering the Philips and that being the long term availability of brushes. Since facial cleansing systems are not Philip’s main seller I can guarantee that this machine will be like my Nutrasonic in a few years and have no brushes available. Sadly there is nothing nice I can say about this machine and can only say that if you are used to the Wal-Mart type of facialcleaners and not a Clarisonic then you will probably like this, but otherwise if you are used to the deep cleaning of a quality facial system you will certainly hate this machine. Of course I am taking this one back and have broken down to buying a Clarisonic for two reasons, the power of the machine and the future availability of the brushes. I can’t wait to get my new 4 speed Clarisonic Pro that I ordered off of E-Bay that cost me the same price as this Phillips did but will actually clean my acne prone aging skin.</li>
    <li> Bought this based off good reviews, plus the vibration AND rotation aspect. I don&#x27;t care for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used an olay spin brush, and a clarisonic for years and so that is what I will compare this to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush head is tiny, and VERY soft. I can honestly say the 1 minute auto timer does not even give me adequate time to cover all of my face and it feels like I am rushing due to the small area the brush head covers.&lt;br /&gt;The wand is delicate and thin, however you have to hold it almost like a flashlight - it&#x27;s not comfortable and feels weird.&lt;br /&gt;Also, the head is at an angle which means you either have to place it precisely on your face, or the brush head doesnt make enough contact.&lt;br /&gt;And the nail in the coffin? $30 brush head replacements.&lt;br /&gt;No thanks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over all this could be better in many ways, I am returning it.</li>
    <li> Amazing innovation&lt;br /&gt;It must have piece</li>
    <li> Awesome product. Very handy</li>
    <li> As someone who used a Philips Sonicare toothbrush for 20 years until switching to an Oral-B toothbrush a couple years ago, I jumped at the opportunity to review this skin cleansing tool.  I have been using one of the original Clarisonics since 2009.  I use it every day and have come to love the brush.  Despite that it is now six years old, it is going strong.  I love it so much that I purchased the Mia 2s for my family in the past year.  (Clarisonic was bought by L&#x27;Oreal in 2011.)  This brush by Philips has some interesting innovations, but I am not so sure that they are an improvement over the Clarisonic:  1. Different shape: I didn&#x27;t really notice any better performance or results with the cylindrical shape of the Philips PureRadiance. 2. Slower rotation: The Philips PureRadiance seems to have much lower RPMs.  I feel like my original Clarisonic is better in this respect.  Rather than the entire brush rotating like the Philips PureRadiance, only the inner ring of the Clarisonic rotates. 3. Charger: The Philips PureRadiance is not the easiest to fit into the charger base.  The original Clarisonic had a nice cradle and the new Mia 2s have a magnetic base that attaches easily to the brush handle. The Mia 2 has nice haptic feedback letting you know the brush is connected to the charger correctly.  The Philips PureRadiance base is so lightweight that I have easily knocked it over a couple times on the sink counter.  I really want to like this brush, but I don&#x27;t think that it&#x27;s any better than the Clarisonics.  If I were to buy a new one, I would go with the Clarisonic today.  The Philips PureRadiance is nice, but I think I still love my Clarisonic more.  (Just make sure you buy from an authorized retailer for full warranty coverage.)</li>
    <li> As usual Philips makes a well made and constructed product. Over the years the batteries in their products have been very reliable - more so than most brands. It holds a charge for quite a long time - plenty of reserve between charges - if one does not put it back into the charger. First of all - it clearly does clean better and one would usually be able to achieve manually for most. It leaves your skin feeling clean and aids in circulation. It comes with two different brushes. I have no doubt that if one uses this product faithfully - the appearance of one&#x27;s skin will improve - a product like this requires regular and consistent use to fully realize its full results. For one who uses make-up this and other like it should prove to be a real plus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are several other brushes available on their web site</li>
    <li> Overall I do like the PureRadiance Skin Cleansing system - it&#x27;s easy to use and will work well for almost all skin types, however there are more affordable options out there, this one I think is a bit on the pricey side.  The system comes with 2 cleansing heads: a &#x27;normal&#x27; one for every day use and an &#x27;exfoliating&#x27; one for weekly use.  There are additional heads you can purchase separately, even one for sensitive skin although I find that the normal everyday one that comes with the system is incredibly soft and gentle.  The system also comes with small plastic cover cases for the heads, a small charging base, power cord to charge the unit, and a small zippered case that holds only the unit itself.  I was a little disappointed that they only included a small zippered pouch that only has room for the unit itself, but no room for the different heads, base or power cord.  If you wanted to travel with this system you would need to put it all into a different (larger) bag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The system is super easy to use - the heads snap on easily and remove just as easily.  Once charged you are good to go, and the system is waterproof (but the charging base is not!), so you can even take it in the shower with you.  You can use with or without your favorite facial cleanser, that&#x27;s your option.  A built-in 1 minute timer with a reminder &#x27;pulse&#x27; every 20 seconds helps ensure that you spend equal amounts of time on all parts of your face and that you don&#x27;t use the system for longer than you should. There are 2 speeds available - slow, and a little bit faster.  It is very quiet, much quieter than my electric toothbrush.  After 1 minute the system turns off, although you can easily turn it on again if you wish to clean your skin even more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find the base that the unit sits in inadequately sized given the size of the wand.  The wand is a bit long and heavy, and when you set it down in the small and light plastic base it can easily tip over if not propped near something astall as it is (for example I keep mine in the corner of my counter where 2 corner walls help keep it from tipping).  While it is nice that the base doesn&#x27;t take up much room, it seems like it needs to be a little more substantial to hold the wand while charging or drying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using this for a few weeks and it&#x27;s done a wonderful job of helping remove dry, dull dead skin that is a result of the harsh winter air and is leaving my skin softer and smoother.  Using it once a day seems to work well for me, but different options may work better for others - everyone has a different skin type.  The system comes with a 45-day money-back guarantee which might help influence your purchasing decision if you&#x27;re on the fence about whether you want to actually buy this, and it also comes with a 2 year limited warranty.</li>
    <li> If I had to guess, you might be reading this because this PureRadiance is over half the price of the Clarisonic (cordless). And while that seems pretty appealing, the difference is stark. I have used Clarisonic for over three years now. At the highest setting, the Clarisonic is a powerful machine that does not merely clean your face, but it makes it more receptive to the products you apply after. I did inquire with my dermatologist if these claims were valid. She enthusiastically agreed and endorsed its use (she does not sell the device in her office and had no reason to promote it other than the health of her patients). Once you use the Clarisonic, there is NO going back.  The head here is awkward in comparison to the Clarisonic. It seems to takes considerably longer to use this (to cover the same area with the same care as the Clarisonic). And, it seems that the &amp;#34;gentle rotations&amp;#34; are a ploy to appease those who do not initially understand the Clarisonic. (The Clarisonic employs sonic technology exclusively ... this can lead to a little consumer confusion. However, once the consumer commits to the routine, he/she realizes is the same principle with the Sonicare toothbrush ... which leads to a superior &amp;#34;clean&amp;#34;).  The wand and charging device feel a little on the &amp;#34;cheap&amp;#34; side as compared to Clarisonic. (And, it really is half the cost, so I think this is expected). Moreover, it is considerably less ergonomic than it appears (and, of course, in comparison to the Clarisonic).  For me, the lack of power (which does not even approach that of my Clarisonic) makes this a non-option. If at all possible, just spring for the Clarisonic. I realize how pricey it is; therefore, if the cordless Clarisonic is not feasible, try the Clarisonic Mia (which is a little less convenient, but it still effective). Once you use it, you will feel lost without it! Imagine going back to a manual toothbrush! Now, you get it;)</li>
    <li> This is the equivalent of a motorized toothbrush for your skin and it works the same way. If you&#x27;ve ever used a Sonicare electric toothbrush you&#x27;ll know what I&#x27;m talking about, however if you haven&#x27;t then imagine a vibrating brush that you move across your teeth but instead for the skin. This works extremely well and it&#x27;s less labor intensive. It removes oil and dirt much better because it basically &amp;#34;vibrates&amp;#34; the contaminates loose. It offers deeper cleaning which is great for pores. The unit has high build quality and the battery lasts quite awhile. As with the toothbrushes there are different brush heads. This model comes with two heads..one for normal skin and a second one for exfoliation.</li>
    <li> I love this product!! it works beautifully and does the job. My skin is cleaner and more radiant. I use to get acne breakouts every month but since I have been using this cleansing brush I have not had any acne at all!! Its just wonderful to have clean and clear skin all the time. I will definitely recommend this cleansing brush to all my friends :)</li>
    <li> I love it and my skin too! My skin is so much cleaner and softer now I use it. I like the skin zone timer. The timer is divided in three periods of 20 seconds, one for the right cheek, one for the left cheek and one for the T-zone. In between these periods, there is a short pause so you know when to switch. And it is great that you can use it in the shower!</li>
    <li> very good thing to clean skin!</li>
    <li> My wife is the primary user of the Philips PureRadiance cleaner and I&#x27;m more or less writing this review from her thoughts on the device and my own impressions. I&#x27;ll also mention that this is my wife&#x27;s second PureRadiance Cleanser; the first being the cheaper, single-speed PureRadiance device.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For obvious reasons this review will be very similar to my review of the single-speed device.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-------------------&lt;br /&gt;DESCRIPTION:&lt;br /&gt;-------------------&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Pure Radiance is in short, a handheld, battery operated skin-cleansing system that uses interchangeable (and disposable) brush heads that rotate gently to cleanse your facial skin. The unit ships with two brushes - one &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; brush for everyday use and one exfoliating brush that, according to the included literature, should only be used weekly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The device comes with a base charger and the head of the Pure Radiance device sits on the base charger for storage, and of course, charging the device itself. The base elevates the brush head for drying as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The device features some really nice aesthetics and appears that Philips worked hard to make the device as attractive as possible. There&#x27;s a single button that serves to toggle the two cleaning modes - gentle and deep cleansing. A built-in one minute timer that automatically shuts off the device helps prevent the user from over using the brush on sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-------------------&lt;br /&gt;USE:&lt;br /&gt;-------------------&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife primarily uses the Pure Radiance at night after she&#x27;s already used her traditional makeup remover. She really enjoys the fact that the Pure Radiance can be used both at the sink and in the shower and that&#x27;s a huge selling point for her. After just a few days usage she was also quite pleased with the way her facial skin felt. My wife has also used the device to help cleanse her neck and was equally pleased with the results and how her skin felt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll go ahead and mention that my wife let her sister (my SIL) borrow one of her PureRadiance cleansers and she absolutely loved it as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-------------------&lt;br /&gt;THE GOOD:&lt;br /&gt;-------------------&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(+) Cleansing.

    <li> I LOVE this product.  It works so much better than a facial.  I&#x27;ve had many facials and my skin tends to redden after them.  Even exfoliating facials don&#x27;t tend to clear up my skin.  The Philips PureRadiance Multi-Speed Skin unit cleared up my skin for one week after only one use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product comes with two heads.  One for exfoliation and another for cleaning.  The directions say that it can be used daily.  But I tend to use it only when my face has blemishes.  I don&#x27;t see a need to use it more than that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product has a slow and a fast setting.  People can use it as they see fit.  I tend to use only the slow setting and haven&#x27;t found a need to use anything faster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product needs to be used with cleansing solution.  You can either put the cleansing solution directly on your face or you can put it directly onto the brush head.  Either works find.  I recommend using a mild cleansing solution, unless your skin can withstand very strong cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really love this product.  I&#x27;m just so glad that I don&#x27;t need to pay for facials anymore.  And I love that I&#x27;ve found something to clear up blemishes on my face.</li>
    <li> I have been using this 1-2 times a day for a couple of weeks now and I am very impressed with how clean my skin feels afterwards.  Because the bristles are SO soft and because you clean each section of your face for only 20 seconds - it doesn&#x27;t seem like it would make that much of a difference.  But for about a half an hour afterwards - my face feels tingly and very refreshed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The directions say that this may be used in the shower - which I have not tried yet - but that is a nice feature and an easier way to make it part of your daily routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I wish was different was the design.  This looks too much like a different kind of battery operated product and I have to admit that I don&#x27;t want to leave it out on my bathroom counter in case someone got the wrong idea.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But that aside - I like the way this makes my skin feel.  I am lucky in that I don&#x27;t often break out - so I can&#x27;t speak to the effectiveness as far as that goes.  The exfoliating head is great as well - and so much nicer than the harsh peach/salt/sugar scrubs that I&#x27;ve used in the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a good beauty tool and I hope it lasts for years to come.</li>
    <li> The Philips PureRadiance Skin Cleansing System is an excellent beauty aid to deep clean pores and rejuvenate the skin through increased blood circulation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PureRadiance is fool-proof - similar to Philips Sonic Toothbrushes. Each cycle has three 20 second periods designed to clean each cheek and your T-zone. There is a pause between each cycle to let you switch areas. The great thing about this ~1 minute timer is that it is a quick cycle (which is not difficult to use even on those tiring nights) for deep cleansing and you do not over-abrase your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using PureRadiance with Melaleuca Tea-tree products to control acne and it works wonders. I had been using disposable medicated wash cloths, but the difference between the medicated cloth and PureRadiance is like night and day. Within 2 weeks of use, the acne has subsided significantly and since I have not changed anything except my cleansing method, I feel that my cleaner and medication is getting in deeper for more effective, visible results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;* Philips brings its proven tooth cleansing Sonic technology to its skin cleansing line&lt;br /&gt;* Visible results in less than a week - skin feels cleaner, radiant and tighter&lt;br /&gt;* Deep cleansing of pores remove impurities and permit creams/medications to penetrate deeper&lt;br /&gt;* ~1 minute cleansing cycle should work for most people&lt;br /&gt;* Works with any face cleanser, lotions, make-up remover, etc.&lt;br /&gt;* Ergonomic design makes it easy to hold - even in the shower&lt;br /&gt;* Rechargeable - 5-6 hours for a full charge which yields ~30 cycles&lt;br /&gt;* Includes Normal and Exfoliating brush heads and a travel-case&lt;br /&gt;* Multiple brush types available for different applications - Normal, Exfoliating. Sensitive, Extra Sensitive and Deep Pore brush heads&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;* Expensive at $125&lt;br /&gt;* Charging stand does not hold up - have to lean it against wall when charging</li>
    <li> My skin is oily and I tend to get rough patches of dry skin. Every few days I use an exfoliating scrub which makes my face feel so smooth and refreshed. What I like about the scrub is that it sloughs off the dead skin, yet does not strip my face of oils. I have found that this facial product cleans the same way as the scrub. It is super gentle on my skin, sloughs off all the dead skin, and does not strip my face of its oils. I have used a few of these types of skin care products and they either do not work or are too strong for my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-I love that it is 100% waterproof -- so nice to have a product that you don&#x27;t have to wash with the worry of it breaking with a little water.&lt;br /&gt;-rechargeable battery works for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;-easy to charge and it lets you know when it is needing to be charged. I keep the charger in a drawer in my bathroom and just charge it overnight when it needs it.&lt;br /&gt;-When it tells you that it needs a charge, it still has enough juice for a few more uses. Really, really great feature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I love most about this is that it has cycle and every 20 seconds it pauses for .05 seconds to tell you to move to another part of your face. It takes the guess work out of making sure you spent the same amount of time on each cheek and on your t-zone. Brilliant feature!</li>
    <li> I picked this up for my girlfriend who is in cosmetology school and wears quite a bit of makeup herself. Too much if you ask me but don&#x27;t tell her I said that. She fell in love with this the first to she used it. She said she has not been able to get her skin this clean in a long time. She loves the way her skin looks and feels after using it. She has even tried it out on a few friends she does makeup for and they have asked her where she got it and how can they get one. This is highly recommended to any woman who cares about her skin</li>
    <li> I have very light, oily skin which constantly break outs.  PureRadiance brush surprised me - it&#x27;s easy to use and it prevents breakouts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The number one feature for me is being able to use it in the shower.  It doesn&#x27;t even feel like I&#x27;m spending extra minutes in my daily shower routine, I use it while conditioner is in my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brush is light and not clunky at all.  Just note you should replace the brush every 3 months with regular use - very similar to Sonicare toothbrushes, you can even do this for both devices so you don&#x27;t forget.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The timer!  So easy to use, again just like Sonicare toothbrushes.  It just makes you move from zone to zone on your face, in 20 second periods.  There&#x27;s an everslight pause between zones so I have time to switch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are two brushes.  I prefer the normal.  Second is exfoliation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are two speeds - normal and gentle.  I usually use gentle, just because my skin is so light and sensitive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You do need to charge it, but I still have to use up the battery on it!  Box says 30 charges.</li>
    <li> My wife is loving this product. I quickly saw a difference in the appearance of her skin. At our age, the time in the sun is starting to show as skin damage, but this makes such a difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She loved the exfoliating brush head, and started to use it everyday, but that quickly proved to be overkill. Once a week for that one, and the cleansing brush every other day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She says her pores are much cleaner, but I just see a younger, more radiant looking face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will say that it does not sit very well in the charger. As a matter of fact, you have to be careful with how you put it in, for it to balance right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this a great gift for the women you love. I plan on getting one for my Mother for Mother&#x27;s Day. I know she wants one, but she feels it&#x27;s too much of a splurge.</li>
    <li> I really, really like the Philips PureRadiance Cleansing system.  For the record, I also have a Clarisonic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the color, and how easily it charges.  It sits upright in the charger and takes very little space on the counter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also love how my skin feels after using the PureRadiance.  It is literally squeaky clean and makes me feel refreshed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In reality, the PureRadiance and the Clarisonic are very similar - both do a great job with cleaning skin, are easy to charge, can be used in the shower, brush heads are easy to replace, and both hold a charge so you can take them for a weekend trip without taking the base.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only criticism I have is that the rotating brush can pull skin, especially when you are closer to the eye area, otherwise, it is great!</li>
    <li> I have to say that I am truly impressed. I received this product for free, but when I looked it up to see what the going price was, I was in shock. I couldn&#x27;t see how anything costing over $100 could be that much better than my regular skin care routine. I was wrong.&lt;br /&gt;I approached this product as a skeptic. I&#x27;ve tried many skin care items in my life time, including professional facials from spas and certified professionals.&lt;br /&gt;My &amp;#34;cheat&amp;#34; skin care routine is a basic 3 part kit, similar to Proactiv, for my adult acne-prone skin.&lt;br /&gt;Even with the deep cleansing scrub, I normally get a bit of leftover make-up off when I put the toner liquid on a cotton pad and swipe.&lt;br /&gt;The &amp;#34;cleanest&amp;#34; clean I get is from Biore&#x27;s heating facial scrub. But you can&#x27;t use it every day unless you have skin like leather.&lt;br /&gt;My skin is very, very fair, freckled and a bit on the sensitive side.&lt;br /&gt;This did NOT irritate my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So here&#x27;s the test I gave it:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I left on my make-up overnight.&lt;br /&gt;It was 24 hour, long-wear, sweat-proof make-up that has survived swimming laps and aerobics classes.&lt;br /&gt;I used the brush with a mild exfoliating cleanser (the one that normally leaves behind make up) from my daily routine.&lt;br /&gt;I did NOT use the sensitive head attachment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Results: I had almost NO make up residue left on the toner pad (none that I could see).&lt;br /&gt;My skin felt REALLY clean, like it did after a facial. My pores looked tighter and cleaner.&lt;br /&gt;My skin had a few spots that were very slightly pink. But if I were to use a normal cleanser rather than a mild abrasive, it would probably be fine.&lt;br /&gt;The best part is that it felt like a lot less work than my scrubbing routine and my face felt refreshed, like it has been massaged, rather than pulled, tugged and twisted like it normally does after my morning cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Congratulations, Philips. You have won a skeptic&#x27;s heart and skin care routine.</li>
    <li> Did a great job cleaning my wife&#x27;s face.  She reports a big thumbs up on the two brush head options, the ease of use and the refreshed CLEAN feeling of her skin when she&#x27;s done.  It would be marriage sabotage to say she looks any more or less beautiful because of a cleansing system, so I&#x27;ll just say it does a great job!  It charges quickly and conveniently and will now likely make the rounds to our teenage daughters as well.</li>
    <li> My wife has never had such an exfoliating/cleansing device before.  She absolutely loves it.  Easy to put together and take apart, the head is non-abrasive and works wonderfully on her face.  She says it is like going to a spa.  The one thing she wishes the package included is a sensitive skin head.  You need to buy that separately.  But the regular head works well, she says, and restores life and glow to her skin, particularly around her nose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The technology is very similar to the Sonicare toothbrush, which we both use.  Philips does seem to have done a good job exploring the possible uses of their research and development.  The cleanser is lightweight, feels pleasant, and does not vibrate unduly.  So people with arthritis or carpal tunnel should be able to use this without worrying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely a product worth considering.</li>
    <li> What distinguishes this mechanical face scrubbing brush from its competitors is its design.  It is sleek, pretty, and slim.  The charger has the same footprint as the brush-end of the scrubber, so that it takes up very little counter space, unlike its competitors, whose chargers and overall design are larger, more bulky and just generally clunkier.  Functionally, this scrubber is superb, not better or worse than the competition.  After using the brush, one&#x27;s face feels silky smooth and super clean, in fact, one feels radiant!  I highly recommend this product because it does what it is supposed to, and looks good doing it!</li>
    <li> Does it work? At the higher setting, yes, the lower setting didn&#x27;t seem to do much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How it works. When you push the button once, nice gentle rotation of the brush; if you push it twice, faster rotations for a deeper clean. It goes for one minute, pausing for 5 seconds every 20 seconds to let you know when to move on to a different region of you face for an &amp;#34;equal&amp;#34; cleaning session.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The system comes with two brush heads - one for normal skin and one for exfoliation. You can also purchase other brush heads separately - for sensitive skin, extra sensitive skin, and even one for deep pore cleaning. It is recommended the brush heads be replaced every three months. New brush heads sell for $18 - $20 on Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seems to be very easily disturbed from the charger - does not really feel like a secure fit.</li>
