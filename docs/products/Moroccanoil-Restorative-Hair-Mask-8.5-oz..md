      <li>This one still leaves my hair non brush able.</li>
      <li>hydrating mask&#x27; is much better and cheaper.</li>
      <li>I love the Moroccan Oil treatment that you put in your hair before blow drying as well as their shampoo and conditioner.  </li>
      <li>It also seemed more hydrated, which was another plus.  </li>
      <li>and I believe it did a better job than the $30 for Moroccanoil.</li>
      <li>Love this product.</li>
      <li>The smell of this hair mask is overwhelming and almost nauseating.  </li>
      <li>Wonderful conditioner for coarse, over-processed hair.  </li>
      <li>You don&#x27;t need much and it&#x27;s very effective.</li>

      <li>My hair is soft again and it smells good.</li>
      <li>I have always wanted to try products from the Moroccan Oil hair care line, and I was really excited to try this product.  </li>
      <li>Seller originally sent Moroccan oil instead of conditioner, but then resent correct product and still allowed me to keep the full size bottle of oil as well.</li>
      <li>It is a great conditioner, but the results are not as expected.  </li>

      <li>Overall very pleased.</li>
      <li>Excellent product for thick curly multi-ethnic hair!</li>
      <li>/&gt;It is definitely worth the expense.</li>
      <li>well worth it.  </li>
      <li>Using this product once weekly makes my hair soft, healthy, and shiny, even when it is color-treated, keratin-treatment, and shampooed/blowdried</li>
      <li>Like I said, the Moroccan Oil Products have been amazingly fabulous, and I would HIGHLY recommend them to everyone.  </li>
      <li>got it a few months back, my hair is damaged from dying it seems to help a great deal hair is in much better condition</li>
      <li>I have used their standard conditioning treatment and like it much better.  </li>
      <li>I am satisfied with the goods.&lt;br /&gt;I will buy again in the future.</li>
      <li>This only takes 7-10 minutes on your hair, while most deep treatments take 20-30; or more.  </li>
      <li>It may come at a higher price but one doesn&#x27;t need to use a lot each time so it lasts quite a while</li>
      <li>Love the smell/feeling of this mask, but there is a lot of extra crap/alcohol in it.</li>
      <li>You have to seal this in by using conditioner after using this repair mask or it will actually cause more damage for your hair.</li>
      <li>Fast shipping!</li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re looking for a good deep conditioner try the L&#x27;Oreal Damage Erasing Balm or the Macadamia Oil Deep Repair Masque.</li>
      <li>Hair is super soft</li>
      <li>My hair seems to need to have a deep treatment of some sort every time I wash now, and both of these products fit the bill very well.  </li>
      <li>&#x27;Intense</li>
      <li>Thanks for correcting and not making me return oil and have a hassle of an experience.</li>
      <li>This worked very well for me, and my hair was strengthened after I used it.  </li>
      <li>Highly recommended!</li>
      <li>Also the jar was kind of messy as opposed to using it in a tube that squirts out.</li>
      <li>She described that this product added strength to hair while the deep hydration mask obviously gave hair more moisture.  </li>
      <li>main points : do not leave this on your hair for longer than 5 mins.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s just that this particular one</li>
      <li>Made old hair like new with first use.  </li>
      <li>In general, when the price is too good to be true, it&#x27;s because it&#x27;s a fake.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s normal dryness.  </li>
      <li>I usually love all moroccan oil products, but not sure about this.  </li>
      <li>Really like the smell, makes my hair feel a little bit less damaged but not as amazing as the reviews say.</li>
      <li>I had tried the Moroccan Oil Deep Hydrating Conditioner and it worked very well for me, and asked my hairdresser about this product.  </li>
      <li>and when I rinsed it out it did not feel soft at all.  </li>
      <li>and I see a marked improvement to the quality of my hair.  </li>
      <li>If anything it left it more dried out.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Followed the leave in for five minute directions, and while hair was soft, it was not as soft as with the regular moroccan oil.  </li>
      <li>It has a thick consistency, so I expected it to make my hair feel really soft and smooth</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d definitely recommend it to anyone with less than cooperative hair or someone who just wants to soften or add shine to their hair.</li>

<li> Hair is soft and silky without being weighed down.  </li>
<li> My hair was so dry and brittle.  </li>
<li> This mask is deeply conditioning without weighing my hair down or making it greasy -</li>
<li> After 2 weeks of using the other brand, my hair was tangling and frizzy, and not soft at all.  </li>
<li> Thick conditioner that leaves your hair feeling SO soft after use!</li>
<li> As expected, thank you</li>
<li> My hair still feels rough and in fact after I use this, my hair is falling out.</li>
<li> It is expensive but well worth it.  </li>

<li> I did a few well water stripping treatments (to rid my hair of copper) and found my hair still rough and tangly.</li>
<li> I have heavy and thick Asian hair.  </li>
<li> I lose a lot less hair when I detangle, and my hair immediately feels stronger.</li>
<li> This is not a good product, especially compared to the oil.</li>
<li> Use it once a week and makes my hair silly soft!</li>
<li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.  </li>
<li> Didn&#x27;t notice a lot of difference after using it for a few months.</li>
<li> The price is the only drawback (expensive).</li>

    <li> My all time favorite hair mask. You notice a difference after just one use! Helps brings my hair back to its healthiest state and helps keep it growing.</li>
    <li> got it a few months back, my hair is damaged from dying it seems to help a great deal hair is in much better condition</li>
    <li> The mask works great and the smell is amazing.  Hair is soft and silky without being weighed down.  The price is the only drawback (expensive).</li>
    <li> Excellent product for thick curly multi-ethnic hair!</li>
    <li> I love this serum! It softens even my thick and unruly hair and adds a wonderful shine to it. I&#x27;d definitely recommend it to anyone with less than cooperative hair or someone who just wants to soften or add shine to their hair. It may come at a higher price but one doesn&#x27;t need to use a lot each time so it lasts quite a while (since you only need to use it once a week).</li>
    <li> I am satisfied with the goods.&lt;br /&gt;I will buy again in the future.</li>
    <li> Made old hair like new with first use.  My hair is thinning and short.  It gave it body and shine and held the style even sleeping on it.  Looked just as good the next day.</li>
    <li> I had tried the Moroccan Oil Deep Hydrating Conditioner and it worked very well for me, and asked my hairdresser about this product.  She described that this product added strength to hair while the deep hydration mask obviously gave hair more moisture.  This worked very well for me, and my hair was strengthened after I used it.  It also seemed more hydrated, which was another plus.  My hair seems to need to have a deep treatment of some sort every time I wash now, and both of these products fit the bill very well.  This only takes 7-10 minutes on your hair, while most deep treatments take 20-30; or more.  You don&#x27;t need much and it&#x27;s very effective.</li>
    <li> my hair was a horrible dry wreck from too much coloring.  I used this twice and I see a marked improvement to the quality of my hair.  I strongly suggest you go to the Moroccan oil website and read the instructions on how to use this.  it is not a hair conditioner it is a restoration for your hair.  You have to use a conditioner after you use this or your hair will feel horrible.  This is really good stuff.  main points : do not leave this on your hair for longer than 5 mins. must use conditioner after you use this. use it weekly until your hair improves, then use it once a month.</li>
    <li> My hair had severe damage from hard water from my well. I needed a miracle. I did a few well water stripping treatments (to rid my hair of copper) and found my hair still rough and tangly. I got this stuff, put it on and from the advice from the lady at the store left it on for 30 minutes in a shower cap. It was awesome. My hair is soft again and it smells good. Would recommend.</li>
    <li> I love the Moroccan Oil treatment that you put in your hair before blow drying as well as their shampoo and conditioner.  They are some of the best hair products I have ever used.  However, I was not impressed with the restorative treatment.  I have used their standard conditioning treatment and like it much better.  Like I said, the Moroccan Oil Products have been amazingly fabulous, and I would HIGHLY recommend them to everyone.  It&#x27;s just that this particular one I found to be disappointing.</li>
    <li> Love the smell/feeling of this mask, but there is a lot of extra crap/alcohol in it.</li>
    <li> As expected, thank you</li>
    <li> Wonderful conditioner for coarse, over-processed hair.  I will purchase again.</li>
    <li> My hair has also been falling out after using it.</li>
    <li> Thick conditioner that leaves your hair feeling SO soft after use! Absolutely love it!</li>
    <li> I have always wanted to try products from the Moroccan Oil hair care line, and I was really excited to try this product.  The smell of this hair mask is overwhelming and almost nauseating.  It has a thick consistency, so I expected it to make my hair feel really soft and smooth but it just felt like I had a lot of thick paste on my hair, and when I rinsed it out it did not feel soft at all.  I have thick, wavy, and color-treated hair.  I don&#x27;t know if this would work differently on a different type of hair but it did not work for me.  This hair mask smells like bad cologne and is so overpowering and lingered in my hair the next day.  Don&#x27;t waste your money.  If you&#x27;re looking for a good deep conditioner try the L&#x27;Oreal Damage Erasing Balm or the Macadamia Oil Deep Repair Masque.</li>
    <li> This product smells awful but after using it the first week I could definitely tell a difference in the strength of my hair. Again it doesn&#x27;t smell wonderful but it feels wonderful. I will continue to purchase this product!</li>
    <li> This hair mask makes my hair so silky compared to it&#x27;s normal dryness.  I have been using it at least once a week and I have noticed a big difference in my hair!</li>
    <li> I have thick curly hair (chemically treated).  This is wonderful!  I put it on with a shower cap for an hour and rinse.  Hair is super soft</li>
    <li> This one still leaves my hair non brush able.&#x27;Intense hydrating mask&#x27; is much better and cheaper.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing, here is a hint from my hair dresser. You have to seal this in by using conditioner after using this repair mask or it will actually cause more damage for your hair. If you use it properly it will work, if you do not condition your hair after using the mask you can actually damage your hair.</li>
    <li> This mask is deeply conditioning without weighing my hair down or making it greasy - I have heavy and thick Asian hair.  I do leave it in for the recommended 7 minutes.  It smells wonderful and I would definitely recommend it.  I am currently going through hair regrowth treatment that can be drying for my hair, so I use this several times a week.  Otherwise I would use it once a week as a treatment.</li>
    <li> I love this product!  My hair was so dry and brittle.  I use this product once a week and noticed a difference immediately.  My hair is no longer brittle and lifeless.  It is shiney and has added body.  I would recommend this product!</li>
    <li> This mask is by far the best I&#x27;ve ever used and I love the smell.  It is expensive but well worth it.  I use it like a regular conditioner and when I ran out and tried another brand that has 10 in it&#x27;s name, there was no comparison.  After 2 weeks of using the other brand, my hair was tangling and frizzy, and not soft at all.  Then I go back to the Moroccanoil mask and after one use, my hair is back to the way it was before trying the other brand, soft, shiny and no tangles whatsoever and I&#x27;m over 50 and my hair is chemically enhanced. I&#x27;m only reviewing the product not the seller and I&#x27;ve never purchased the mask online but only from my hairdresser.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping! Love love this product! Use it once a week and makes my hair silly soft!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t notice a lot of difference after using it for a few months.</li>
    <li> I also tried this product and did not find that it did anything to deep condition my hair.  If anything it left it more dried out.&lt;br /&gt;It is definitely worth the expense.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the best for the hair.</li>
    <li> Is good my hair change after I star to use this . Muy hair grow and look with life</li>
    <li> Moroccan Oil products are pricey but well worth it.  Using this product once weekly makes my hair soft, healthy, and shiny, even when it is color-treated, keratin-treatment, and shampooed/blowdried/flat ironed daily.  Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> I usually love all moroccan oil products, but not sure about this.  It is a great conditioner, but the results are not as expected.  Followed the leave in for five minute directions, and while hair was soft, it was not as soft as with the regular moroccan oil.  Could be just my hair type, or my water.  Still, giving it four stars, as it is a great conditioner.</li>
    <li> My hair was overprocessed and needed a mask. From my hairdresser I understood that this product was great. While waiting for it to come I purchased a tube of L&#x27;Oreal repair mask for hair. The L&#x27;Oreal purchase was only six dollars and I believe it did a better job than the $30 for Moroccanoil. Also the jar was kind of messy as opposed to using it in a tube that squirts out.</li>
    <li> I asked the company if this product with foreign writing was counterfeit and they said that only authorized salons and the company directly sell this product.  All others are fake!  I bought an authentic bottle from a salon a year ago and it worked great.  I won&#x27;t be buying this product here. In general, when the price is too good to be true, it&#x27;s because it&#x27;s a fake.</li>
    <li> Excellent delivery, I have stringy damaged hair as a result of being over processed I have found that this is one of the best products for chemically treated hair.</li>
    <li> good product...would recommend</li>
    <li> This is not a good product, especially compared to the oil. My hair still feels rough and in fact after I use this, my hair is falling out.</li>
    <li> Great product, easy to use, smells awesome, does everything it purports to do.</li>
    <li> Really like the smell, makes my hair feel a little bit less damaged but not as amazing as the reviews say. Nice but I would look for a cheaper brand.</li>
    <li> Product didn&#x27;t smell as usual was a disgusting smell like it was spoiled</li>
    <li> I love this hair mask! I have been battling damaged, dry, breaking hair for a few years now due to a medication I was taking. I will tell you that my hair is extremely thick and when I use this, my hair is like silk! I have very thick African American hair and I am in the middle of transitioning from a relaxer (5 months since last relaxer) and this mask gives my hair enough slip that I don&#x27;t even need a relaxer. I lose a lot less hair when I detangle, and my hair immediately feels stronger. This works wonders! Please remember to use a regular conditioner after this product, as it is a protein treatment and you have to put the moisture back into your hair. Worth the $$$!!!</li>
    <li> Love this product. Have used for months and truley changes hair quality. Seller originally sent Moroccan oil instead of conditioner, but then resent correct product and still allowed me to keep the full size bottle of oil as well. Thanks for correcting and not making me return oil and have a hassle of an experience. Overall very pleased.</li>
