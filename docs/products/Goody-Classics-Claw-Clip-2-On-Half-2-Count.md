      <li>The different colors in the package make them a perfect match for any hair color.</li>
      <li>These were ok.</li>
      <li>These are my favorite mini-clips.</li>
      <li>If I&#x27;m exercising or want a more secured look, more than 1 is needed, but then I just use a hair tie.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>They&#x27;re ok, bought them for fine hair for children..</li>
      <li>Just the right size and just what I needed!!</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t slide off the hair easily</li>
      <li>Just the size I was looking for but not as strong as they used to be.</li>
      <li>These little miracle clips are perfect for my pixie cut.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t need huge hair clips for my hair.  </li>
      <li>mini clips that are a great size for holding hair back.</li>
      <li>Mother wears them daily, great product</li>
      <li>Would be best in thin light weight hair.</li>
      <li>These are the older and better clips.</li>
      <li>There are far more in this package than I will ever need.</li>
      <li>Small size, beautiful colors.</li>
      <li>However, the teeth broke easily with normal use.</li>
      <li>left of penny,  my own favorite smaller clip on the right.</li>
      <li>they hold hair back securely and don&#x27;t stick out much from the top of the head so it almost looks as if you aren&#x27;t wearing any sort of clip at all.</li>
      <li>Great size for clipping small sections of hair</li>
      <li>When the price is too good to be true it usually is</li>
      <li>I wanted to pull a few strands of hair back from my face without looking like I was wearing a giant 80s-style clip on the top of my head and these are perfect-</li>
      <li>Pretty sturdy too.</li>
      <li>THANKS FOR THE FAST SHIPPING!</li>
      <li>And they are easy to use and position, unlike traditional barrettes.</li>
      <li>These hold just enough and are easy to use.  </li>
      <li>Note, you can purchase these in larger sizes, but this one is ideal for earbuds, and small charger cables.</li>
      <li>bought for my daughters hair, they work really well to keep her bangs out of her face</li>
      <li>Hold my hair very well&lt;</li>
      <li>Should be just about right for a three year old.</li>
      <li>These are great small clips that can be used to hold pieces of hair back from the face.  </li>
      <li>These are the SUPER tiny clips-</li>
      <li>( it has extra comb prongs in the inner part of the clip - which gives it a better grip on the hair).</li>
      <li>Great for people with thick hair, especially curly/wavy/textured hair.</li>
      <li>I would highly recommend buying these.</li>
      <li>they will break if you force just a little more hair in them than they think they should hold..  decent for matching or blending into some hair colors which is why they were bought..</li>
      <li>Contrary to other reviewers on here, my hair is held in place just fine using these.</li>
      <li>My smaller clip actually holds tight to a good amount of hair without slippage.</li>
      <li>These little guys are perfect for the problem and keep individual cords neatly stored in place next to your device when traveling, or when stored in small places.</li>
      <li>These mini crown claw clips hold your hair really well and all the basic colors are included in the package.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m able to sweep just a few strands back from my face, or use multiple clips and really shape my whole head, clipping some strands up for volume and others back away from my face.</li>
      <li>STRONG LITTLE CLIPS!</li>
      <li>These are small and stay put in my fine hair.</li>
      <li>/&gt;They are so convenient - I can clip one onto my purse or belt loop for easy access.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only 4 stars because I have some other similar clips that are even stronger, and the same size.</li>
      <li>I have very long hair (knee length) &amp; these hold very well.</li>
      <li>Also have been generally unappreciated since the 90s.</li>
      <li>Came in a smaller size than expected and can&#x27;t hold much at all .</li>
      <li>It sucks, cause I bought it for the ginger clips more than the other colors.</li>
      <li>A little too large than i hoped</li>

<li> It sucks, cause I bought it for the ginger clips more than the other colors.</li>
<li> A little too large than i hoped</li>
<li> Tired of wrapping and then untangling all those wires and cords for the various wireless devices in my life, I wanted something other than rubberbands to keep the lot organized and easily accessible.  </li>
<li> They work very well for my thin hair for pinning back just the fronts of my hair.</li>
<li> The pack of 15 cost less than a pack of 3 at the local store, and I&#x27;ve used 6 already.</li>
<li> the ones a little bigger than a dime.</li>
<li> I use these everyday, &amp; tend to lose them constantly!</li>
<li> I have long, thin, wavy hair - putting my hair up in a loose bun-thing can be accomplished with just one of these little clips.</li>
<li> what a lame introduction, right?</li>
<li> These are tiny and too small for me.  </li>
<li> While these are just the right size, the grip is so loose that it&#x27;s difficult to hold small locks up.</li>
<li> They&#x27;re well-sized and none of the others have broken so far, but</li>
<li> --I coil it around itself, clip it down with four of these, and it stays all day.</li>
<li> Can&#x27;t really mess up hair clips.</li>
<li> I have very long, thick hair and sometimes pony tails give me headaches.  </li>
<li> I bought these clips a few months ago because I was tired of constantly having my hair in my face.</li>
<li> A side note: may be a bit too small for thick(er) hair, as they are very small</li>
<li> After a few weeks they were all mostly broken.</li>
<li> These mini clips do not hold onto hair tightly, that being said if you have thick hair, these will be useless.  </li>
<li> This are NOT mini as stated they are small!!</li>
<li> Can&#x27;t find them anywhere :-(</li>

    <li> These are perfect for my thinning hair.</li>
    <li> Nice colors and quality. Doesn&#x27;t slide off the hair easily ( it has extra comb prongs in the inner part of the clip - which gives it a better grip on the hair). Small size, beautiful colors. Good for kids and for not-so-thick hair.</li>
    <li> I have very long, thick hair and sometimes pony tails give me headaches.  These hold my hair and don&#x27;t hurt my head.  Love them!</li>
    <li> Came in a smaller size than expected and can&#x27;t hold much at all . When the price is too good to be true it usually is</li>
    <li> These are tiny clips, about the size of my thumbnail.  I like using them in place of bobby pins to put my hair in a bun--I coil it around itself, clip it down with four of these, and it stays all day.</li>
    <li> Contrary to other reviewers on here, my hair is held in place just fine using these. I have long, thin, wavy hair - putting my hair up in a loose bun-thing can be accomplished with just one of these little clips.

I wish I knew what they were, but these are a close second.</li>

    <li> I don&#x27;t need huge hair clips for my hair.  These hold just enough and are easy to use.  They stay put too.  Pretty sturdy too.</li>
    <li> These mini clips do not hold onto hair tightly, that being said if you have thick hair, these will be useless.  Would be best in thin light weight hair. I&#x27;ve used smaller clips that held hair tighter. These are NOT them.  My search continues.  See photo; Goody Classics Claw clip,  &amp;#34;mini&amp;#34; left of penny,  my own favorite smaller clip on the right. My smaller clip actually holds tight to a good amount of hair without slippage. Can&#x27;t find them anywhere :-(</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t really mess up hair clips. Mother wears them daily, great product</li>

These little guys are perfect for the problem and keep individual cords neatly stored in place next to your device when traveling, or when stored in small places. The pack of 15 cost less than a pack of 3 at the local store, and I&#x27;ve used 6 already. Note, you can purchase these in larger sizes, but this one is ideal for earbuds, and small charger cables. And they don;t crimp or damage the wires.</li>
    <li> Just the size I was looking for but not as strong as they used to be. My hair keeps falling out of the clips.  Will look for better mini clips.</li>
    <li> These are the older and better clips. I looked everywhere for these because the ones they sell in most stores aren&#x27;t as good. These are small and stay put in my fine hair.</li>

A side note: may be a bit too small for thick(er) hair, as they are very small clips.&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;1. Hold my hair very well&lt;br /&gt;2. Come in a variety of colors to suit each hair color!&lt;br /&gt;3. You can&#x27;t beat the price!&lt;br /&gt;4. Sturdy- have help up for several months for me with no problem&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;1. None!</li>
    <li> These were ok. They are &amp;#34;standard&amp;#34; mini clips that are a great size for holding hair back. However, the teeth broke easily with normal use. After a few weeks they were all mostly broken.</li>
    <li> I use these to bump up my ponytail.  There are far more in this package than I will ever need.</li>
    <li> As soon as I tried to use one of the ginger clips, one of the claws snapped off. This clip also had left-over plastic from the mold hanging on it, so maybe it&#x27;s just a lemon. It sucks, cause I bought it for the ginger clips more than the other colors. They&#x27;re well-sized and none of the others have broken so far, but what a lame introduction, right? I&#x27;ll post a picture to show the defective clip.</li>
    <li> Perfect! Just the right size and just what I needed!!</li>
    <li> STRONG LITTLE CLIPS! THANKS FOR THE FAST SHIPPING!</li>
    <li> Bring back the 90s! These little miracle clips are perfect for my pixie cut. Also have been generally unappreciated since the 90s.</li>
    <li> I was looking for some tiny clips for my hair. While these are just the right size, the grip is so loose that it&#x27;s difficult to hold small locks up. Would perfect if they were just a bit tighter of a clamp.</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re ok, bought them for fine hair for children.. they will break if you force just a little more hair in them than they think they should hold..  decent for matching or blending into some hair colors which is why they were bought..</li>

    <li> These are the SUPER tiny clips- the ones a little bigger than a dime. I wanted to pull a few strands of hair back from my face without looking like I was wearing a giant 80s-style clip on the top of my head and these are perfect- they hold hair back securely and don&#x27;t stick out much from the top of the head so it almost looks as if you aren&#x27;t wearing any sort of clip at all. And they are easy to use and position, unlike traditional barrettes. Totally recommended.</li>
    <li> This are NOT mini as stated they are small!!</li>
    <li> Nice strong clips. A little too large than i hoped but i still use them.</li>
    <li> These are tiny and too small for me.  I will pass them on to my granddaughter.  Should be just about right for a three year old.</li>
    <li> These are great small clips that can be used to hold pieces of hair back from the face.  Very good product -- they have held up well.  These are larger than the Scunci mini clips and will hold thicker pieces of hair.  These are my favorite mini-clips.</li>
    <li> Great size for clipping small sections of hair</li>
