      <li>now the challenge is finding a cheap set of razors that fit it....if anyone knows of a cheap, but also good set, please let me know!</li>
      <li>, so I think I&#x27;ll be practicing on weekends until I become a bit more proficient at it before I decide to throw out the Gillette.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Very good quality, very light!</li>
    <li> I  am new to this type of shaving, but it doesnt matter. I got this product and never used it. This is because My nails aren&#x27;t long or strong enough to get in between the cheap plastic insert to place in and out of the main holder. (I bite them). Changing blades would result in a cut, and/or I would need some type of tool to use to get the razors in and out. Since the &amp;#34;razor holder inserts&amp;#34; (red and black) are made of cheap plastic, they would inevitably break if i used pliers or something similar. Amazon has granted me a refund as I explained the problem. (Thank you amazon)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I am just giving a heads up. I&#x27;m really dumbfounded by all the positive reviews on this product. Perhaps I got a lemon, I guess I&#x27;ll never know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought I was getting quality, but I got a name stamp. (Dovo). I cant speak for the quality of shave cuz i didnt use it.  but the holder is very light compared to the one other cheaper disposable flat razor sold here on amazon. (parker). Although the parker doesnt appear to be anything special either, i will try to shave With the Parker  that I got as it appears as if I will be able to change those blades. Even though that is no small feat, at least it looks like it won&#x27;t break.</li>
    <li> First off, I&#x27;d like to say shipping was really fast! I bought this to mainly make clean looking cuts and to shape up my facial hair better than your regular 5 blade razor. It comes with 4 blades, and 3 holders. There is the red one for the short blades and two black holders for the longer blades. One of them has grooves on it like a comb to trim! Let me just warn everyone who is a first time user. Be extremely careful!!! I cut myself on my chin and under my nose because I was nervous using it for the first time and I bled for quite some time. Another tip, you will find it easier to use if you&#x27;re holding it at the right angle and keeping a steady hand lol. I know it will take some time to get used to it, but FINALLY I can save money on shaving. I went from a Gillette fusion spending 20 bucks for 5 replacement heads...My skin was so irritated from using that razor and I used this one time and my skin feels as soft as a babies bottom! Many thanks to this company for a great product! Cheers!</li>
    <li> This is so easy I&#x27;d almost switch completely, but it&#x27;s just not as nice as using a real straight razor. This does do a great job though. No more needing to strop before shaving. Just a quick blade change and a shaving I go :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the first shavette I&#x27;ve ever owned and to be honest I had to look up how to change the blades. This is because for the life of me I could not get the red holder that came in it out. It just would not budge. Not being overly familiar I didn&#x27;t want to break it. After loosening up the main piece it hasn&#x27;t given me any issues since.</li>
    <li> Title says it all.  No stropping / Honing like a straight, just remove the plastic insert, swap blades and pop it back in.  It looks like a childrens toy but is anything but. Very lightweight and won&#x27;t rust or corrode. You may have to remove it for inspection when going through airport security (make sure to remove the blade beforehand).  Beginners tip: Try it with the Personna (red box) blades first. Work your way up to Derby.  Once you have mastered the fine art of not cutting your own throat you should switch to the Feather High Stainless.</li>
    <li> This blade holder feel great in your hand and adds confidence to my hand when using the blade. On top of that the classic look style and feel is amazing</li>
    <li> I bought this shavette mainly for cleaning up my neck area and sideburns between haircuts. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s large enough for shaving your face but it is possible to shave with it. It is well made but it lacks that German heft to it. It does shave well and handle is good but the only issue i have with it is taking the plastic insert out to change the blade. It can be challenging and dangerous as well. The insert is very hard to get out and requires using a counter top or something hard and flat to make it loose.</li>
    <li> The shaver was far too light to allow a comfortable experience.  I found my fingers slipping on the ribbed-plastic neck too many times.  At times the blade would flex too much in one direction, even with slow, smooth draws.  I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been wanting to try out a straight razor for about two months and wanted to go with a shavette versus one that would need sharpening, etc., so I could get an idea how it was shaving with a straight razor.  I may relent and resign myself to paying an arm and a leg for Fusion blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First ordered a Parker and sent it back because the quality was abysmal.  Decided to try Dovo because of their reputation.  This razor was a step up from the Parker in terms of quality, but it certainly wasn&#x27;t what I was expecting.  If the product details provided all the pertinent information (and for some reason, it seems to be lacking for ALL DOVO razors on Amazon) I would have saved myself the time in ordering and sending it back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The most glaring omission from the product details is what blade holder comes with this particular razor -- and that is a critical detail. Depending on the color of blade holder, you may or may not be able to use the blades you may have bought (in my case, I had a box of Shark blades).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The razor I received came with a green holder which is used for (and from what I can tell, ONLY for) the Ridgid-Back Personna Shavette Blade (one such blade is included with this razor).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What is missing (and what you&#x27;ll need to order from somewhere else because I can&#x27;t find them on Amazon) are the two other colors of blade holders:  red and black.  The red blade holder will work with any brand double edge razor blade that you cut in half, and I guess DOVO also makes a blade for the red holder called the DOVO Short Shavette Blade.  And yes, the red holder will work with the Shark blades and I believe the Derby blades too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The black blade holder works with the DOVO Long Shavette Blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would think the majority of people use Derby, Shark, or cut a regular double edge blade in half, so why isn&#x27;t the red holder included instead of the green one?  Better yet, why don&#x27;t they explain what I just explained in theproduct details?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would have kept the razor and just ordered a red holder, but when I found out how difficult it was to remove the green holder from the razor, I said forget it.  I mean, we&#x27;re talking \\&quot;where&#x27;s the plyers?\\&quot; type of difficulty.  And this is something I&#x27;m going to be able to remove with a blade in it without slicing myself to death?  I think not.  So back it went, and I remain straight razor-less with a box of Shark blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Again, the quality of this straight razor was a step up from the Parker shavette, and that&#x27;s why I gave it two stars instead of one.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a shame, because this could be a handy product; but it was a great disappointment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, I was sent the wrong product. The Dovo shavette is a modular design, with a choice of three inserts, depending on the type of blade you want to use. I ordered the red--universal, designed to fit basic double edge blades like you can find at CVS and cut in half or the Shark/Derby blades that are already cut--but received the green--designed specifically for longer rigid spined blades.  Annoying, but no worries, I just order the correct holder (and the third insert, just in case) from a shaving specialty store elsewhere online.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, no matter the holder/blade combination, this shavette has a horrible feel in the hand. The balance is off and the tail/shank is incredibly bulky. The holder is quite thick and reaches almost to the very edge of the blade, which severely limits the angle of contact. Also, the various \\&quot;seams\\&quot; in the shavette--between blade and holder, and again between holder and shavette arm--create natural crevises for shaved hair to snag, making it difficult to clear the blade after a pass.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aesthetically, I like the design. It&#x27;s compact. With the modular design it should be versitile. It&#x27;s fairly solidly built, considering what it is. It should have made a great travel blade. Unfortunately, the design just does not perform well for me. I&#x27;ve gotten far more effective use from the comparatively poorly built but (IMO) better designed Parker shavette--without the frustration of mismatched parts.</li>
    <li> A bought one for me and one for my son. I was looking at a full hollow ground Dovo, but the time i added in the strop, sharpening stone and razor I was up to $425. A 100 pack of blades for $5 would last me 3 years with this razor, so that is the main reason I went with this one and no sharpening, just way easier to change blades.</li>
    <li> Great straight razor! I would recommend this for beginners. I started with a shaving factory a couple of years ago and I cut myself at least once a week. This one I have very few cuts and I have been using it for a couple months.</li>
    <li> I was shocked. It feels like a toy in your hand. This might be a good first razor for a 11 year-old hipster boy, but if that&#x27;s not you, then you&#x27;ll be disappointed.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a very experienced knife collector, not so much about straight razors even though I&#x27;ve owned a couple.  I should have known with the price but I thought this was just a cheaper straight razor, it&#x27;s not, it&#x27;s a Shavette (I thought that was the model name or something) meaning this takes razor inserts.    For being a Shavette it is very nice.  Make sure that is what you want, for a Shavette it&#x27;s perfects, but that&#x27;s not what I wanted.    What I like about the company is they are returning no problem, and they are paying the shipping.  And they do sell regular straight razors, of course they cost more.</li>
    <li> I bought this before I knew anything about straight razors.  If you need something heavy feeling this isn&#x27;t for you.  There are 3 guides you have to put the razor in which are plastic, one red, 2 black.  Comes with 2 long and 2 short razors.  Overall, putting all of it together for use is frustrating cause those blades are sharp as hell.</li>
    <li> Out of the box I had to squeeze the end in a bit to make the blade stay put, quality control?&lt;br /&gt;The razor seems well made, it&#x27;s definitely not cheap China crap.&lt;br /&gt;My main problem is I cannot find a really decent blade to use it with, the Dovo blades kind of suck I think, I wish the Feather Japanese brand made one to fit it. I have had a hard time finding the green blade insert to use with the rigid blades, don&#x27;t quite understand why it didn&#x27;t come with all three plastic inserts? It&#x27;s definitely better than the Parker Shavette, which I also own, made in India, quality a notch better than the Chinese stuff. If you want a nice straight razor your going to pay a couple hundred dollars and then a couple hundred more for all the other stuff to keep it sharp, this is a nice cheap alternative.</li>
    <li> Packaged in a clear plastic envelope.No instructions whatsoever. 3 strange plastic keepers?&lt;br /&gt;Not at all impressed with the presentation. I have a much cheaper blade razor and it is excellent.&lt;br /&gt;I do not recommend this product at all. I had to forum your site as to how to use the shaver..&lt;br /&gt;Appalling presentation.</li>
    <li> This review is based entirely on my experience with this type of razor. This is my first experience with a straight razor of any kind. The blades that came with the razor are very sharp and after several attempts, with many nicks and cuts, I decided that this razor is not for me. As far as the razor itself is concerned, it is of excellent quality and I have no issues with it.</li>
    <li> Another must have hubby loves it and it came with some razors too</li>
    <li> I purchased this product from Straight Razor Designs. About the same price, but they have a detailed description of the product and what to expect from using the product. The product comes with the red and black blade holder, but you can order the Green holder as well and all of the razor blades you might need. The product is lightweight and feels cheaper than a real straight razor, but it is what it is. I&#x27;ve had good success shaving with it using a split double edge razor (Red holder). I also have a Boker straight razor, but I will use the Dovo shavette when I don&#x27;t feel like stropping the Boker. All said, it is a good product for the money.&lt;br /&gt;...Amazon appears to be cheaper on price now, especially if you can get Prime shipping.</li>
    <li> I got this for my boyfriend, and it hardly shaves. I definitely wouldn&#x27;t recommend purchasing this.&lt;br /&gt;It is not a straight blade razor, you have to replace the blades.</li>
    <li> I have a lot of respect for Dovo, and enjoyed using my friend&#x27;s Dovo. So naturally, I wanted my own.    Looked it up, found the same model, and purchased it. Came quickly, so I was pleased with that.    When I got it, I opened it up, and found that there is nothing inside of the green insert to line up, or guide the blades that I put in it, much unlike the exact same razor that my friend got... perhaps they changed it, or I just got a dud?</li>
    <li> Its a good first razor and is forgiving if you mistreat it. Its a little hard to change the blades and it was also wound pretty tight when I got it.</li>
    <li> If you are going to use a straight edge just buy a more expensive solid one. The replaceable blade on this is flimsy and I ended up with a very bloody face. I bought a safety razor after this and will never shave with anything else ever again.</li>
    <li> My husband is in the military &amp; has to shave  almost everyday. He loved it. It delivers a very smooth finish.</li>
    <li> Love this razor.  I can&#x27;t get over how much money I have saved with this thing.  I bought a variety pack of blades back in 2011 and I still have yet needed to buy more blades. I switch blades every week! The razor is very nice and has never rusted on me.</li>
    <li> So i am pretty new to straight shaving. i go to the barber every once and a while for them and they are great every time i go. This is my first straight razor and it is great, i am never going back to a safety razor. The personna Blade that comes with it lasted about 3 shaves. i probably could have pushed it to 4 but i had already ordered derby professionals so i tossed the personna. To my dismay i found out that the Derby blades are too small to fit in the shavette slot....it is disheartening especially when derby&#x27;s come at a pack of a 100 for less than 6 bucks. other than that, i love this straight razor. i actually enjoy shaving now. i get a lot less cuts and nicks from a straight razory ironically and my face comes out super smooth. now the challenge is finding a cheap set of razors that fit it....if anyone knows of a cheap, but also good set, please let me know!</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t believe I waited this long to switch to a straight razor!</li>
    <li> Bought this razor to get away from the costly cartridge razors and it works great finally got over the learning curve and doesn&#x27;t take me as long but still get a little blood on the neck area still need practice</li>
    <li> Amazing shave. All I have to say.</li>
    <li> I love this shavette. It seems to hold the blade more secure than other shavettes that i have tried. My red blade holder has broken and I am having trouble finding a replacement.</li>
    <li> I have been using this razor for about a month, I really enjoy using a fresh blade every time I shave which was part of my motivation to grow up and use a straight razor. I was a total beginner and the first few shaves they were pretty gory but now that I have been using it have have gotten used to handling the razor so I am pretty sure I could shave my coconuts if I wanted to. I did also purchase a box of 100 Shark single edge blades when I bought the razor but I also tried the longer Dovo blade that comes with the razor and ended up liking the longer blade.</li>
    <li> Solid performing holder for disposable razor blades. I like that you can try different blade manufacturers. It took a few tries but now I&#x27;m getting the best shaves ever with this. The stainless steel finish means no rust and a firm grip. So far I&#x27;ve only used Derby blades but I&#x27;m comfortable with the blades so far. After I finish the box I plan on looking for a top-end straight razor.</li>
    <li> Great to use, easy to get razors in. Only problem is my red insert broke it came apart at the fold, after 5 months. But it doesn&#x27;t effect the shave. Be gentle with it.</li>
    <li> a good way to try straight  razor shaving without  getting to involved with sharpening  It is a little difficult to remove the blades and the majority of  avalible blades with be of the shorter variety</li>
    <li> This will work just fine on the sides, but when you get to your chin you will have to choose between leaving hair behind or getting cut. This is because the razor blade is very exposed and the holder is so light its hard to make a very small precise adjustment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried this for a month and then switched to a safety razor so I can get a good shave without cuts.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t expect anything less from the German engineering.</li>
    <li> Great shaving tool for my husband. No rust at all from long time usage!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband, he loves it. Thank you for such a great razor.</li>
    <li> Great product, happy with it</li>
    <li> Nice straight razor to start out one&#x27;s straight razor journey.  This item comes with three holders (red holder for half of a regular double edge razor blade, black closed comb holder for half of a long double edge razor blade and a black open comb holder for a long double edge razor blade), one regular platinum coated double edge razor blade and one long double edge razor blade.  The blades are already split in half, so be careful when handling the little packets.  The ability to practice with a long blade &amp; short blade ads to the versatility of this razor.  The only thing I would improve would be the weight of the blade.  It is very light and does not handle like a regular straight razor.</li>
    <li> Amazing, it&#x27;s been five months and still works wonders!</li>
    <li> after using this a few times now, I love this razor! its an experience to have one and learning how not to slice your throat open, the long blades that come with the razor are also really nice smooth shaving blade, not sure of the brand but I would buy more if I could... it also came with some short blades for the red insert but they felt kind of like they were dragging on the hair rather then shaving it... all in all a really good buy</li>
    <li> I bought this for my boyfriend for our anniversary last year, and, a year later, he still loves it!  It gives him a nice clean/smooth shave, and he is really happy that he can use it to touch up his hairline and side burns.  If you are looking to buy a straight razor, I would definitely go with this shavette instead because you save SO much money and get the same (if not better) results.  The razor is very durable too, and there&#x27;s no wear on it even a year later.</li>
    <li> the red holder uses normal blades but the other two holders are only for the type of blades with holes in the middle to hold them. the handle is NOT plastic which as anyone who uses one alot knows, is very important for durability.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this razor every day for about month now and can confidently say that, I believe this is a great first straight razor since it is relatively inexpensive and feels good in quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only draw back, and it may be a deal breaker for you:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The red plastic razor holder is poorly designed. Everyday before I shave, I slide out the red plastic blade holder from the straight razor blade handle, open the red plastic blade holder to expose the keyed blade slot, and drop in a fresh Sharks blade. When I close the red plastic blade holder, there doesn&#x27;t seem to be any way for the two halves of the red plastic blade holder to perfectly align with each other (no snap in tab which aligns the two halves and secures both halves to each other). This is a problem since, when you slide the red plastic blade holder with a fresh blade back in the straight razor handle, the red plastic sometimes covers the blade making it impossible to shave without readjusting the red plastic blade holder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even if you perfectly align the red plastic blade holder and slide it into the straight razor handle, the blade sometimes gets pushed too far into the red plastic blade holder, also making it very difficult to shave. It seems the tolerances for the blade keys are far too large so the blade freely moves in its holder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than this problem with the red plastic blade holder which I&#x27;m sure could be replaced, this is a great feeling razor blade. As of right now, I am searching for a better designed blade holder to make this razor perfect.</li>
    <li> Felt like it was made out of plastic</li>
    <li> I like the blade guard, which is perfect for a beginner. Shavettes are very forgiving due to the ability to change blades cheaply and quickly, but still try and learn proper technique for when you upgrade to a standard straight razor</li>
    <li> Since this is specific to straight-razor beginners, it&#x27;s expected to not be of high quality. Having said that, I still think the shavette leaves something to be desired in terms of weight and how it feels in the hand. I would recommend only shaving the flat surfaces of your face to get a feel for it. I think the razor needs to be a little more robust to have better control, it seems to me that it slips too easily out of position causing skips and nicks as a result. Still, it&#x27;s probably better than most beginner shavettes out there.</li>
    <li> Great product, excellent quality, a must for beginners and safe to use, this is my first straight razor and I am very happy with it.</li>
    <li> Still using it after many months of use, bought the derby blades after I used the ones provided. Fairly cheap and effective. Cheaper than spending over $20 on a modern razor replacement blades that have 4 or 5 blades to irritate my skin. Still having trouble shaving around jaw bone but it works great still. Part of the learning curve.</li>
    <li> This straight razor I bought for making the perfect lines on my beard! I don&#x27;t shave my entire face with it...hell I would be scared to! This thing shows no forgiveness for being stupid or careless! The red holder holds any blade I have bought for it and the reviews I have read saying the red holder is difficult to remove is inaccurate. You slide the holder parallel with the shaver out of the top. Do not try to pull the holder perpendicular away from the shaver. I think this may be why people are having problems. It is very nice for the money and I love that I can buy nice replaceable blades very inexpensively! It always gives you a very precise and close shave! I have been using the Wilkinson sword classic blades and they seem very sharp and have never tugged on any hair. If you like straight razor shaving or use it to edge your perfect beard I truly believe this a great product that isn&#x27;t to expensive.</li>
    <li> Not happy with what I purchase.  I thought it would give me a clean shave, I was wrong about this item!</li>
    <li> I really wish I would have forked out the money for this razor when I first got into shaving with a straight razor. This is hands down more comfortable than my previous razor in the grip and with the shave. I find myself getting less nick/cuts with this razor as well. Overall this is a really great blade, its extremely light, and conforms to your hand. If your going to switch to a straight razor and want to do so but not spend hundreds of dollars, I would definitely recommend buying this razor first and avoid the ones that are under 20.</li>
    <li> Although the red tab is indeed actually pretty hard to pull out, as compared to the black ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A simple shavette that should adequately serve anyone&#x27;s needs for one.</li>
    <li> This thing is a great way to get in to straight razor shaving without dishing out more than $100+ for a traditional carbon or stainless steel razor and accessories. Has a nice tight grip on the blade very sturdy. The blade holder slides right out the end for easy blade replacement. Also great to have while travelling as razor blade cartridges can be found in just about any drug/department store.</li>
    <li> This is a light weight, and well crafted razor.  This is NOT a straight razor. It requires disposable safety blades.&lt;br /&gt;This razor is very versitile and can accomdate several different size blades including the standard safety blades.</li>
    <li> Just got this bad boy in the mail today (two days ahead of the \\&quot;estimated shipping day\\&quot; so, good job, whomever shipped this), took it upstairs, and lathered up my face for the moment I&#x27;ve been waiting for since Wednesday. Let me tell you, this product is fantastic. The handle and the blade pieces are of good quality. It didn&#x27;t come with any blades, but I have a ton of DE blades so I&#x27;m set there. The blade mechanism is very tight, you may need a little help to slide the red piece out of the blade, but it&#x27;s good to know the blade won&#x27;t be moving around while you&#x27;re shaving. All in all, a good buy. I would buy another if I had to, and would highly recommend this to anyone trying to bridge the gap between DE and straight shaves.</li>
    <li> This is light weight, yet well made. Mine came with 1 long blade and 1 standard DE blade. It came with the red insert, a black insert and an extra black insert with comb teeth on it. Although it is light weight it feels like it is made pretty solid for what it is. It is a welcome addition to my collection! My dad used it on his head and it is probably the smoothest head shave he has ever had. From what I understand this is a shavette that professional barbers use (and coincidentally I watched a video of an &amp;#34;executive shave&amp;#34; this morning and they were using this).</li>
    <li> Ive used it twice now and Im fairly sure the only issues I have with it are technical mistakes that I make myself while shaving. The product is all metal and it is well made. As far as shavettes go, this is one of the best on the market.</li>
    <li> I purchased this as a precursor to the real thing so as to acclimate myself with straight razor shaving without the full blown expense but as I purchased this razor as a combo pack with razors that don&#x27;t even fit the cartridge,  this endeavor was a misstep. I am going to see if the manufacturer will make things right.</li>
    <li> Decent quality shavette from one of the best brands (Dovo). The red insert is very difficult to remove initially, and took a good deal of careful prying to remove. Beware that while the handle is steel, the blade carrier is actually made of aluminum and is easy to bend or break if you&#x27;re not careful.</li>
    <li> MY particular order of the Dovo shavette came with One RED blade holder for the half length razors, and Two BLACK blade holders for the full length razors [one with comb-like blade guard (training wheels I guess?), and one without] - for a total of THREE blade holder inserts. It also comes with one half, and one full length double edge razors that snap in half, for a total of four razors, packaged in a plastic/vinyl pouch. It is also very well constructed (same model sells for $50 at the Art of Shaving store).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those who are worried about the blade holders being too difficult to take out... I just clipped my nails last night and I think as long as you have SOME fingernail left over (if you don&#x27;t bite your nails or clip them till you bleed, or if you don&#x27;t have super brittle nails), you shouldn&#x27;t have too much of a problem removing them.  Stick the tip of your nail in the gap on the top (the spine on the opposite side of the razor) where the plastic meets the aluminum, then just gently pushing it out. You do NOT need to go anywhere near the razor itself to pull it out, so there&#x27;s no danger. It DDID, however, require slightly more force to be applied than I expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First time shaving with a straight razor and I must admit, I did lose some weight today. There&#x27;s definitely a learning curve but the result was a fantastic, super smooth shave (minus 4-5 patches of skin). Although I only did one or two passes max on the same spot at any given point in time going WITH the grain, it felt ALMOST as smooth as it usually does when I shave with my Fusion Pro several passes with, then against the grain (it was still a bit stubbly on the bottom of my chin on the throat side off the edge of my jaw bone when I ran my fingers against the grain afterwards).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finished off with some Suavecito Bay Rum, and it burned very very nicely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Took about 15 minutes or so for the whole thing, so I think I&#x27;ll be practicing on weekends until I become a bit more proficient at it before I decide to throw out the Gillette. Definitely happy with the purchase.</li>
    <li> Super item, exactly as shown in the image. Very impressed. Not quite as comfortable to shave with as a straight, but excellent value. Now shaving like a Boss!</li>
    <li> Love this razor would recommend the razor to anybody solid great quality</li>
    <li> Just not sharp enough to but my thick beard. Spend a little more and get s really straight.</li>
    <li> After using it for a while, there does not seem to be thirty five dollars worth of work / craftsmanship put it to it but I am still very pleased with the bang for the buck compared to the alternatives. Buy this once with a 100 replacement razor blades( ~$6) and your set up to shave for at least a couple years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this after looking into straight razors and while I do not think they are very comparable, it is a step in the right direction if you want to test the waters. I have yet to use a regular straight razor but I think this will get you used to some of the intricacies such as how to maneuver around the corner of the lips, under the nose, and your chin line without cutting yourself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Plus, the process of taking your time for a shave, with proper shaving cream and brush is pretty relaxing in the end. Makes you appreciate having a clean shaven face.</li>
    <li> way better than having to sharpen all the times, Lather, soak properly combine with using feather blades snapped in half and thrown away after one use ( because it&#x27;s just so cheap) gives an amazing shave, the beard just floats away, I admit I cheat and use a safety razor around the mouth because my technique just isn&#x27;t up to it.</li>
    <li> I was previously using a straight razor from Sally&#x27;s that I believe was meant more for haircuts, but worked. This razor gives more control shaving-less nicks and razor burn. This could be better razors too? Very happy with this razor</li>
    <li> I have been shaving with this shavette for a while now and I am very happy with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I got it, I was a bit skeptical.  It is very lightweight.  Almost too lightweight in comparison to the shavette I had been using previously.  But it shaves great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The plastic insert that holds the blade is tapered so that only a thin edge of the razor is exposed; less is exposed than with my other shavette.  This allows me to get under my nose better, and it pretty much eliminates cuts and nicks while shaving.  This shavette allows me to get that special, super close single blade straight razor shave without having to break out my first aid kit.  I highly recommend this product, especially to those just starting out with a shavette/straight razor</li>
    <li> Its very nice its light weight very manuverable.</li>
    <li> The product was not at all what I expected. I may not know how to use it well, but the product irritates my skin before I am finished. It also took me a while to figure out how to assemble it. I would NOT recommend this product to anyone. The only reason I am not putting it as one star, is because it does get rid of hair. But, it does it SLOWLY. NOT buying again.</li>
    <li> LOVE this shavette. This is my third purchase as I have made this into a regular &amp;#34;manly&amp;#34; gift set I&#x27;ve been giving to close friends. People are normally nervous to buy a shavette themselves and try it out. This has got to be one of the best quality for the money shavettes available.</li>
    <li> Great shavette for the price.  Comes with 2 short and 1 long blade (made in solingen).  Loving it so far!</li>
    <li> This is far more durable and sturdy than other shavettes I have tried.  My others break if I try to travel with them.  This one is well put together, the components feel strong and the pins are tight.  When I ordered this razor it came with a black blade holder too (for long blades) and a black holder with a blade guard (for styling hair).  It also came with one long and one short blade that were both already cut in half for me (the blades seem to be Merkur).  Overall it is an excellent daily shaver.</li>
    <li> I went cheap on the straight razor and ended up with this one to see if I would enjoy shaving this way. I&#x27;ve tried multiple blades but my normal razor shaves closer. It could be that I&#x27;m simply a newb to this however thats how I see it. I will be looking for another straight razor and keep trying different blades. Good way to learn how to shave with a straight razzor.</li>
    <li> I am returning this item . It did not work as it was very dull and would not shave any facial hair.</li>
    <li> i bought this christmas of 2012. my gifteee said it tore his face off.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m happy with this product. When it gets dull, just change the blade. None of that annoying stropping. Also, it doesn&#x27;t have sharp corners like those other razors with changeable blades.</li>
    <li> It works fine. I must admit..I thought it would be made of metal but feels like a rigid metal finish plastic.</li>
    <li> I am new to straight razors so this is my first one, I use it mainly for lining facial hair up works great. I got it becuase its a good brand, Great deal</li>
    <li> Be Aware. The Combo of Derby Razors in the bought toghether or whatever do not fit. This Dovo takes a longer razor insert. Otherwise I love it. I bought another slightly cheaper one and it was crap, but this feels good in your hand, the stainless is nice and the razor it accepts is nice and long instead of the half blades the other one took.</li>
    <li> Bottom Line Up Front: This is a great razor if you know what you&#x27;re doing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use a Parker safety razor everyday, and I thought to try this shavette razor out.  My goal was to get as close of a shave as possible, every time.  For the record my facial hair is somewhere around the middle of the road as far as coarseness is concerned.  My daily shaving routine consists of shaving with the grain first, followed up by shaving against the grain (if I want a close shave).  If I only shave with the grain (no matter how many times) and then slide my hand upward on my face I always still feel stubble.  If I shave against the grain right off the bat, I wind up either cutting myself or getting bad razor burn.&lt;br /&gt;Now, I decided to buy this razor with a 100-pack of Shark double-edge super-chrome blades.  The only reason I bought so many blades is that they still fit my safety razor, and you simply split each blade in half in order to use them with the Dovo razor.  If you are familiar with razor blades then you already know Sharks are pretty damn sharp, so I knew beforehand what I was getting myself into.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When setting up the Dovo razor you can use one of two razor sleeves, depending on if you have a long single-edge blade, or as in my case, a split double-edge razor blade, which winds up shaving a significantly smaller coverage area.  For me, I used the red sleeve.  You snap a double-edge blade in half, and then open the razor sleeve. Next you line up the holes in the razor with the guide-pegs in the sleeve, and then fold the sleeve shut.  This sleeve slides into the handle, and you are ready to bleed, I mean shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you use a straight razor, make sure you are not in a hurry, heavily caffeinated, under the influence, and so on.  Now I use pre-shave oil, and a lot of hot water to start off with.  It probably wouldn&#x27;t hurt to throw a semi-wet towel in the microwave for a little bit to help open your pores up.  Once I lather up the shaving creamI use short quick (not too quick though) strokes to scrape the hair off my face.  The Dovo does feel comfortable in your hands as it&#x27;s not heavy, and it has a rubber grip on the handle.  I have used this razor at least ten times now, and I am just not smooth enough with it to warrant everyday use.  I have slipped twice with it, though I caught it just enough to minimize the damage.  The razor sleeve also creates enough of an angle with the blade in order to prevent serious injuries from occurring, but only if you&#x27;re very careful.  I will continue to use this blade every now and again.  I like the idea of shaving with a straight razor, and this product is made very well.  However, I do not possess the necessary skill and steady hand to convince myself to use this more, even though I&#x27;m sure I could get the hang of it over time.  Each time I use this razor I think of how smooth my face will be at the end, but as soon as I splash on the aftershave that thought is burned away in a fire of pain.</li>
    <li> This is exactly what I thought it was when ordered and more! I thought it only came with the red sleeve and turns out it comes with red, one black for longer blades, and a black one with teeth that I assume is for thinning hair. The one thing I wish this thing came with was directions. Tips for proper use would be nice. This is my first time using one so my first try looked like a war zone. Second attempt was MUCH better and a much closer shave then my Gillette Fusion. I do suggest that beginners use the red sleeve as it is much easier to use!</li>
    <li> works as expected. I would recommend this to friends, but there is a learning curve before excellent results are achieved but is well worth it.</li>
    <li> Unbelievably light weight. Took some getting used to compared to my standard straight razor. Overall I would say worth the buy!</li>
    <li> I bought both this version and the black plastic one this one is the best ! (short of a real straight razor)</li>
    <li> Great product, well built and inexpensive.</li>
    <li> use it for work... absolutely love it! the metal &amp;#34;cover&amp;#34; is much better than my co -worker&#x27;s plastic ones...... I am the envy of the barber shop.</li>
    <li> I bought this, plus razors brings it up to maybe $30 for the year. That means a little over $2/month for a shave which is closer than the NSA.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seriously though, once you get past the part where you make minor cuts on your face, this is much preferable to everything except one of those fancy pants shaving razors. But this is very good nonetheless.</li>
    <li> I went from a Parker to this Dovo. I would of liked more weight behind it but over all it&#x27;s pretty nice. Handles very well.</li>
    <li> Love the straight razor. A little light compared to what I usually used. But after getting used to it, very smooth.</li>
    <li> Good product for a good price. I got this to work my way into using a straight razor without the &amp;#34;labor&amp;#34; of honing and stropping. Getting the technique down is just a matter of practice and being careful, but I still lost some blood before I got the hang of it.</li>
    <li> Well made shavette. Lightweight and well balanced. My only issues are that removing the blade has the potential for injury on the blade should your hand slip, and hair collects in the tip of the scales.</li>
    <li> Overall, I like this shavette. Most of the attributes are just as easily pros as cons depending on your preference, so the list below is more just FYI than anything else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- The size is pretty comfortable. It&#x27;s smaller than my other one, but not enough so as to cause trouble. It will accept both the shorter and longer blades&lt;br /&gt;- The system for holding the blade in place is pretty solid. I&#x27;m confident the blade won&#x27;t shift or slide, and it&#x27;s very easy to clean.&lt;br /&gt;- The lighter feel is a mixed blessing. On the plus side, it&#x27;s easier to feel which areas are stubble free. There is sort of a . . . gritty sensation in the hand holding the shavette when it moves over an area that isn&#x27;t completely smooth. It&#x27;s hard to describe, but it&#x27;s something that has been very helpful.&lt;br /&gt;- The plastic piece that holds the blade in place has a tiny protrusion that covers the corner of the blade. In my experience 95% of my nicks come from the corner of the blade scraping me, and that&#x27;d be almost impossible with this shavette. In my opinion, it&#x27;s worth the price of the shavette alone to fix that problem, but if that doesn&#x27;t happen to you, it&#x27;s not going to be of major benefit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- The flip side of the lighter weight is that it doesn&#x27;t have quite as solid a feel as some of the other shavettes out there. It&#x27;s nothing horrible, but I could see someone complaining that it didn&#x27;t have the premium sensation that some of the heavier ones had.&lt;br /&gt;- I could see someone not liking the smaller size. It doesn&#x27;t bug me, but it would be understandable if it did.&lt;br /&gt;- The system that holds the blade in place, while really easy to clean, is a tiny bit harder to seat the blade into. It&#x27;s a small thing, and only took a day or two of getting used to, but I thought I&#x27;d mention it.&lt;br /&gt;- If I were actually designing my own razor with the people from Dovo, I might let the blade hang out just a hair more. I&#x27;m probably just used to a little more blade hanging out because that is the way my last one was. It&#x27;s by no means hard to work with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d definitely pick up this shavette again, but a ton of personal preference is going to play into your opinion on it. From a &amp;#34;just the facts&amp;#34; perspective, it seems well made and does a fine job holding a razor for a shave, which is it&#x27;s real purpose.</li>
    <li> I love this razor I have 2 of them now. Best razor I have used as a barber.</li>
    <li> Works good, just the way it should.</li>
    <li> great razor, if u have problems cutting people this will eliminate a lot of that, perfect weight no need to put a lot of pressure on customers when using this razor. The only thin that takes time getting use to is using the front corner of this razor, because of the slot that is used to put the blade in. put after a few times using it you will love it. 5stars</li>
    <li> I use this once a week for touch up and am getting very good at using it. get past the initial bloodshed and learn to shave old school.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t work for me!</li>
    <li> I like it, but the problem is when you use the normal small blades, the blade holder is very long and sometimes you need to be very accurate and that&#x27;s kind off not helping. The quality on the other hand is very good.</li>
    <li> Best investment ever. I was tired of paying $30 on mach 3 cartridges every month or so and so i explored this route. Great choice! Great starter shavette. Best, closest shave ever in my life and only $7 for 100 blades. Learning to shave with this kinda razor took me approx a week or two. Intimidating at first but you will do fine and get used to it. Great cheap investment</li>
    <li> the quality isnt there. still cheaper than a real straight edge and to learn a new technique this will suffice.</li>
    <li> I really like the Dovo Silver Shavette Satin Finish Straight Razor. IT was a really good razor and I like the design of the razor. I would say it is a good buy. I got my razor really fast from Amazon and the shipping was great.</li>
    <li> Bought this at the suggestion of my son.  Never used a straight razor before.  I&#x27;m a convert and will happily recommend this product to others.</li>
    <li> I purchased this Straight Razor over a year ago and have used it consistently over that time. There is virtually no signs of wear and the hinge still works perfectly despite being used in a humid environment. If you take care of this Razor it will last several years, just be sure to change out the blade regularly!</li>
    <li> Very light and fragile. Works as expected.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking into wet shaving for a while, and, I&#x27;d finally made the choice to try this one out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The holder easily slides in and out, and it came with two black holders for straight edge blades, and a red holder that adapts to fit any side blade. The replaceable blades take away the stress of having to deal with honing, stropping, and other maintenance. Not only that, but the holder looks devilishly handsome in the shavette, red or black.</li>
    <li> I love that it is made of real metal but the way this razor works is that there is a little plastic sleeve that slides in the shaving part of the shavette, I wish this was made out of something better than plastic or allow us to buy replacement plastic sleeves.  Overall I recommend this product</li>
    <li> I received my grandfather&#x27;s straight razor from my uncle while in Europe. The thing was rusty and completely dull for a straight razor, having ridiculous tug to it. I bought a strop and sharpening stone only to find out I have no clue what I was doing. The shavette is a much better option for a busy engineering student or anyone who is busy all the time. Not worth the work to sharpen a large piece of metal when you could simply replace it. Dovo has an annodized aluminum alternate to getting into straight razor shaving. The removable blades are all very easy to install and the blade glides right over you face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As another reviewer has said, the trick is to getting the angle correctly and traveling perpendicular to the blade, rather than laterally. I have shaved twice with this product and can not be happier with its performance. I only cut myself twice the first time and not at all the second!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product feels sturdy in your hand, I don&#x27;t know what these other reviewers are talking about when they say the plastic handle is flimsy. All sturdy, quality hardware.</li>
    <li> I have tried them all, and for me, this works the best.  The Dovo blades are excellent.</li>
    <li> Awesome beginning for a straight razor, and still a great travel razor.  You must get the full length Dovo blades for the whole experience, but still, this is the only way to go if you want to try straight razor shaving on a budget.</li>
    <li> I originally bought a straight edge razor and really liked the shave over a normal multi-blade razor.  Unfortunately it was too difficult to keep up with honing it/stropping and all the other care required.  I switched to this and Derby razor blades.  The shave is great, close, and doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin.  I suggest replacing the Derby blade between every shave.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift for my husband with no idea if he would actually use it or not. To my relief he was excited about it, and has continued to use it on a daily basis. He cut himself a few times, but did not do any serious damage. When he feels more comfortable, we win probably get a little nicer one. I do wish, however, that they would have included some I directions on how to out everything together, and what each piece is for.</li>
    <li> Do not waste your money in this product. Eventhought it is all metal the material is cheap and light forcing you to put more pressure as you shave causing irritation. Also, the plastic insert that holds the blade will brake in half. You will find better quality razors for half the price.</li>
    <li> The only problem I found with this product, was the plastic clip that holds the actual razor itself. That plastic seemed a little flimsy but durable. It&#x27;s a little hard to get the razor in place but its not a big deal. It is sturdy and reliable. If I had to buy this straight razor all over again, I would. I wouldn&#x27;t even look at other straight razors.</li>
    <li> Really like the feel and weight of it, it does take some shaving to get use to the feel and weight of it, the plastic blade holder do seem a bit cheap but then for a starter razor is more than adequate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since my item came different blades sizes would recommend to try them all before buying your blades.</li>
    <li> This razor gives me a REALLY close shave - I love it. There is a steep learning curve to using this - so you will nick yourself at first, but stick with it the results are worth it. I am now getting the closest shaves of my life. You&#x27;ll need to experiment to get the right shave soap and blades for your face. And of course don&#x27;t let your kids get hold of it - you know what they are like with bright shiny things !!!</li>
    <li> Disliked the quality of the whole shavette.  Where you insert tha blade, its really thick so its hard to get the actusl blade down and flush with the skin.  Only gave 2 stars because it came with the red and black holder.</li>
    <li> This Dovo shavette using Dovo blades has a light comfortable handling and an excellently cutting smooth glide.  It&#x27;s superior to the results and comfort of any disposable, safety or straight razor I&#x27;ve ever used.  It&#x27;s so light, smooth and sharp that I can practically dry shave with it without any irritation.  Plus, needing ZERO maintenance, never rusting and being much more affordable, Dovo&#x27;s shavette is much more convenient than a straight razor.  I&#x27;ve placed my straigh razor in a keepsake drawer because of this shavette and it is the only razor I now use.</li>
    <li> the Razor itself is a little lightweight. The razor has 3 different blades sizes. the bad is that i cant seem to find the blades online to use the hair trimmer and the ling straight blade.</li>
    <li> Great product and made in Germany high quality. Can go wrong with a german product. Thanks, amazon for putting where the product was made.</li>
    <li> My favorite way to shave is with a safety razor.  I have never shaved with a real straight razor, so keep that in mind while reading my so-so review of this product.  There is no way that I could shave with this razor on a daily basis.  I just don&#x27;t have enough time and the quality of the shave is no better than with a safety razor.  The workmanship of the razor is okay, but certainly not anything impressive.  For me, this was pretty much a waste of money and I doubt I will ever use it again.</li>
    <li> I bought this wanting to learn how to shave with a straight razor rather than spending hundreds of dollars on a full on kit. It works great and and weighs nicely. After a bit more of practice I do plan on moving up the full on Straight Razor but I highly recommend buying this to practice with and see if it is something you really want to get into without making such a large investment. Definite confidence builder being able to use this</li>
    <li> I highly recommend using this straight razor if it&#x27;s your first. It&#x27;s a learning curve. You can get 4 or 5 good shaves with one blade. I would go with the 2.5\\&quot; blades that fit into the black blade holder. With this straight razor, you will have a smooth shave and save money.</li>
    <li> This shavette is great. My shaver came with two holders: red and black. I also bought 100 double edge razors which fit perfectly with the red holder. However, I did manage to cut my self, but I was already expecting it because I&#x27;m a beginner. It is difficult at the beginning, but I&#x27;m sure that with some practice Ill be able to master the technique. Overall good product.</li>
    <li> At my request I recieved this razor for my birthday. I had been wanting one for a long time but just never ordered one.The biggest selling point for me was that it was not made in china.&lt;br /&gt; The first couple of shaves were rough as I had never used a straight razor before. I have been using this razor for seven months now and have only used a safety razor once in that time. I am realy happy with this thing. The holder slides in and out with out much effort but stays in place while shaving and the blades are easy to replace. I will not be shaving with any of the latest 12 bladed monsters any more. I enjoy shaving now. I used to shave in the shower just to get it over with, now I look forward to shaving after I shower.&lt;br /&gt;Like I said the first couple of shaves will be rough if you have never used one of these before. Once you get the havg of it you wont have any problems.</li>
    <li> i have wanted to buy a straight razor for a long time but didnt want to spend the $100 to $250 on the traditional straight razor. The item shipped very quickly and was ready to use right out of the packaging. I ended up nicking my self 2 times but they were small and i know it was my fault(wrong angle of the blade) for this being the very first time using a straight razor shavette i was a little bit proud of myself. made of stainless steel it has a sturdy construction. its a great buy and i would suggest it to anyone that i know is looking into straight razor shaving. One warning i do have is that the first time you slide the blade holder out it will be a little bit hard to get out, but i guarantee that it get easier the second time around.</li>
    <li> This is great for learning technique and a cheap starter. The downside is that whiskers get caught between the razorblade and the plastic sheath that holds the razor. I need to completely disassemble every time I use it to clean the whiskers that get jammed and impede the work.</li>
    <li> The first thing you notice when you pick this thing up is how light and, well, CHEAP it feels. But despite that it is pretty sturdy and it gets the job done very well. The razors it shipped with weren&#x27;t the best but they worked as you would expect them to. Overall very pleased with this purchase.</li>
    <li> those the job.. however its does feel a bit flimsy. made of plastic</li>
    <li> Kinda flimsy but very light and is great for travel.</li>
    <li> light weigth and a safe way to feed the blades. very useful as you can turn the blade 180 degrees with a 100% utilization.</li>
    <li> Love this shavette. Practice makes perfect so don&#x27;t expect much until you learn to use. Love the feel of old school shaving now.</li>
    <li> Just keep in mind that you need to buy the razors since it does not come with any. It does comes in a plastic clear holder so  it is not a must have to buy a leader one (unless you want to)</li>
    <li> Received in good condition</li>
    <li> Good quiclity razor. The only recommendation I&#x27;d have would be having an inside plastic lining. This would make the blade cover not look cheap. Aside from that pretty good sifter to have in your collection.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never used a straight razor, so this is my first jump into it.  I did a lot of research and felt like this would be the best one to start with.  It was a great price, seemed easier to change out the blades than some of the other ones I saw, and is a great brand.  So far, it has given me no problems, and is easy enough to use.  Getting the proper technique down is the most difficult thing to do now.  I guess it comes with more practice.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Excellent product! Has a nice, comfortable grip to get a clean, precise shave!! I reccomend purchasing the derby blades along with this razor!</li>
    <li> Great razor. Great price. Fantastic service.</li>
    <li> I am a huge DOVO fan all my straight razors are made by them.  I recently purchased the&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;Dovo Silver Stainless Steel Shavette Straight Razor Replaceable Blade with Red Blade Holder\\&quot; and the Derby blades.  These blades are too small for all the inserts that hold the blade in place.  I liked the blade that came with the Shavette.  how do I get that blade?  If anyone knows where I can purchase that blade or one that equal to it please let me know.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re thinking of trying a cut throat razor and don&#x27;t want to spend 200$ right away this is a decent starting point.</li>
    <li> This item is the best value I&#x27;ve found, and it works pretty well for shaving.  Changing the blade is nearly impossible, and it&#x27;s a very bad design.  I would recommend using a tool of some sort.  So much force is required, my finger slipped and I received a serious injury.  I realize it was mostly my fault, but the design of the blade change is just very dangerous;  Would not recommend.</li>
