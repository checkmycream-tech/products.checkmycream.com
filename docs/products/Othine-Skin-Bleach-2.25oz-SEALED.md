      <li>The ingredients are not the best</li>
      <li>I AM IMPRESSED!!!</li>
      <li>I am thoroughly impressed.</li>
      <li>Now feeling very confident!</li>
      <li>Great Product just got shipped to me.</li>
      <li>LOL....</li>
      <li>Plus it has a pleasant smell.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know how many people are going to read this review, but if you do buy this stuff!</li>
      <li>and I have seen fantastic results!!</li>
      <li>Completely and thoroughly impressed.</li>
      <li>I am so pleased with my product.</li>
      <li>Great, this item really works.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;But what I am noticing now is, that after I wash my face, my skin tone looks so much more even.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m lighter, brighter, and more all over even-toned.</li>
      <li>In fact hydroquonone has been safely in use since 500 BCE that we know of.  </li>
      <li>I love it and keep a jar of this in my home all the time.</li>
      <li>I love her dearly</li>
      <li>After I got more comfortable with it on my face</li>
      <li>and I have never seen a fade/bleaching agent so powerful and effective.  </li>
      <li>I heard this product works better than Ambi and it works fast.</li>
      <li>is use it for my upper thighs  and am happy with the results so far.</li>
      <li>hydroquonone suppresses melanin production, users will by more sun sensitive.</li>
      <li>highly recommend to anyone with light unwanted marks.</li>
      <li>have spots on my neck from wearing my hair up in  a pony tail during hot summer months, so</li>
      <li>I always use suscreen on top if I wear short sleeve shirts.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It took about a week before I noticed a more even tone to my skin--but I definitely do see a difference.  </li>
      <li>FIRST OFF...</li>
      <li>and I have been using this consistently for over a month.  </li>
      <li>The spots are fading slowly, but because I tend to spread this cream on pretty evenly across most of my face, my skin is showing a more youthful, even complexion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried many creams with little success.  </li>
      <li>I was really dissapointed in the ambi, really dissapointed.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried lost of other prouducts and this stuff is magic.</li>
      <li>I am fair skinned, and my dark spots were really obvious without foundation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>the only studies suggesting this may be carcinogenic, are ones where hydroquonone was administered to rats orally at full strength.</li>
      <li>The FDA has listed hydroquonone as safe up to 2% OTC and anything beyond that must prescribed.&lt;br /&gt;The only 2 potential issues are these;&lt;br /&gt;A</li>
      <li>Also, if you combine the use of Othine with a high SPF sunscreen, then you will be protected from the bleach hyperpigementing on  your skin</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t really seen any results but the cream is not heavy.</li>
      <li>when applying,it will fade marks and lighten surrounding skin if you spread it on skin that is normal.</li>
      <li>its ok, i haven&#x27;t been using it long enough to see results, but so far i have no complaints about this.</li>
      <li>I purchased this cream after doing considerable research on the safety and effectiveness of skin lighteners.</li>
      <li>COMPLETELY</li>
      <li>I have a skin burn because of an old laser surgery.</li>
      <li>the jar is nearly finished and the spot is still there</li>
      <li>news is, it doesn&#x27;t cause any damage to skin (no dryness or acne) and it works great as a moisturizer, bad news is that it doesn&#x27;t seem to have any bleaching ability.</li>
      <li>apparently the chemical in this stuff has been banned in the EU, Japan, and Australia, over concern being that it is a carcinogen, meaning it causes cancer.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve since noticed that I&#x27;ve gone up at least 1 full shade, and all my acne scars from HS have faded quite dramatically.</li>
      <li>It also has been linked to high levels of mercury and other problems.</li>

<li> AS FAR AS BLACK PEOPLE GO, THIS CREME WILL NOT BLEACH OUR SKIN.</li>
<li> not a WOW one</li>
<li> As the reviewer stated below, you must be careful to apply it with a q-tip because applying to an entire area will lighten marks</li>
<li> I will be seeing a dermatologist for recommendations as I would be concerned with continuing this long term.</li>
<li> it left unsightly dark acne scars.  </li>
<li> I put this on to correct a dark skin patch (which had appeared suddenly)</li>
<li> My skin is so sensitive and keeps  the dark color for few years if got burnt.</li>
<li> I saw Othine had a 3% active ingredient of hydroquinone bought it, and found those same exaqct spots that I put all that other stuff on fade in about 8 days.</li>
<li> I&#x27;M CAUCASION AND NEEDED IT FOR UNDEREYE DARK CIRCLES AND A FLAT BUT REDDENED SCAR.</li>
<li> This stuff works be careful with use .Use</li>
<li> /&gt;About hydroquonone -the active ingredient in this cream-</li>
<li> I thought this product is gonna help me accelerating the dark spots of the surgery, but it didn&#x27;t.</li>
<li> I used this in her face cream and while she&#x27;s still dark, she&#x27;s getting there.</li>
<li> THE DARK ACNE SCARS DID NOT FADE OR BLEND</li>
<li> I get dark marks here</li>
<li> AND FYI I WAS DARK SKIN</li>
<li> I have been using this for over 3 months on some dark scars on my legs and they don&#x27;t seem to be fading at all</li>
<li> i just expected quicker results after a few months use</li>
<li> At first I was a little skeptical after a little bit of time using it, but then again I used it irregularly anyway.</li>
<li> very small percentage of people with darker skin may develop ochronosis, a condition that further darkens and thickens the skin.</li>
<li> /&gt;Every morning I rub some of this product on the two areas of my neck, and after one month they are almost half gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> and it lightened the area slightly</li>
<li> I AM A BLACK WOMEN AND</li>
<li> I don&#x27;t even have to use half the coverage I used to pack on out of shame.</li>
<li> This worked to lighten and even erase some of those spots in just a few weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve been battling with this \\&quot;shadow\\&quot; for over 2 years now, and I could still see it even with heavy makeup.</li>
<li> but it will also lighten the surrounding areas which could cause a blotchy and uneven skin tone.  </li>
<li> I have naturally very pale skin with some melasema and dark patches.</li>
<li> I have a very Black girlfriend.</li>
<li> Remember use with caution, you&#x27;ll see results in as little as 2 weeks!</li>
<li> I PURCHASED THIS CREAM TO BLEACH SOME MOSQUITOS BYTES, BUT WAS NOT IMPRESSED WITH IT, AFTER USING 2 JARS, I HAD TO PURCHASE A DIFFERENT BRAND</li>
<li> BUT LESS DRAMATIC DIFFERENCE IN THE SCAR,</li>
<li> , not happy have to continue to use cover up.</li>
<li> This crap works, hands down period.</li>
<li> I was skeptical, but i have faded all the freckles on my face to being unnoticable.</li>
<li> You won&#x27;t be afraid to hug or kiss someone.</li>
<li> And it soaks into the skin, and it&#x27;s not greasy, and doesn&#x27;t smell too bad either.</li>
<li> It smell bad and did nothing.</li>

    <li> I&#x27;M CAUCASION AND NEEDED IT FOR UNDEREYE DARK CIRCLES AND A FLAT BUT REDDENED SCAR. DEFINITLY SAW A DIFFERENCE 1ST DAY ON THE UNDEREYES BUT LESS DRAMATIC DIFFERENCE IN THE SCAR, BUT I&#x27;M WRITING THIS AFTER ONLY 1 NIGHT SO...</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know how many people are going to read this review, but if you do buy this stuff! I have used Ambi, nothing. I have even bought a prescrition strength skin bleach through my dermatologist at 4% hydroquinone and two months later nothing! I have also tried another lemon type skin bleach from my local beauty store. It smell bad and did nothing. I was really dissapointed in the ambi, really dissapointed. I saw Othine had a 3% active ingredient of hydroquinone bought it, and found those same exaqct spots that I put all that other stuff on fade in about 8 days. I even took a photo of my face with my HD digital camera (thats notorious for showing my hyperpigmentation in photos) and the spots faded. I am thoroughly impressed. Completely and thoroughly impressed. I tell people how it is and if something doesn&#x27;t work I will say it. This crap works, hands down period. Plus it has a pleasant smell. You won&#x27;t be afraid to hug or kiss someone.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried lost of other prouducts and this stuff is magic. I had these spots on my face of all places and needed to get rid of them. I used this stuff and within a month spots were gone.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for over 3 months on some dark scars on my legs and they don&#x27;t seem to be fading at all</li>
    <li> I ordered this cream to fade a spot on my face the jar is nearly finished and the spot is still there, not happy have to continue to use cover up.</li>
    <li> This stuff works be careful with use .Use a q-tip when applying,it will fade marks and lighten surrounding skin if you spread it on skin that is normal.I love it and keep a jar of this in my home all the time.I get dark marks here and there do to acne or ingrown facial hairs.I would have look like a dalmation dog without this product.Remember use with caution, you&#x27;ll see results in as little as 2 weeks!</li>
    <li> AFTER READING REVIEWS I BOUGHT THIS STUFF IT DID NOT WORK FOR ME I&#x27;BE USED IT FOR LIKE 2 MONTHS.</li>
    <li> apparently the chemical in this stuff has been banned in the EU, Japan, and Australia, over concern being that it is a carcinogen, meaning it causes cancer. It also has been linked to high levels of mercury and other problems. Look it up. Here is one article. [...]</li>
    <li> Great Product just got shipped to me. I heard this product works better than Ambi and it works fast. I am so pleased with my product.</li>
    <li> I been using this product for about 6 weeks now, only at night and it has made a difference not a WOW one but my skin is definitely lighter. is use it for my upper thighs  and am happy with the results so far.</li>
    <li> I have a skin burn because of an old laser surgery. My skin is so sensitive and keeps  the dark color for few years if got burnt. I thought this product is gonna help me accelerating the dark spots of the surgery, but it didn&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> I PURCHASED THIS CREAM TO BLEACH SOME MOSQUITOS BYTES, BUT WAS NOT IMPRESSED WITH IT, AFTER USING 2 JARS, I HAD TO PURCHASE A DIFFERENT BRAND TO KEEP USING ON THIS UNPLESANT MARKS.</li>
    <li> I put this on to correct a dark skin patch (which had appeared suddenly) every day for over two months.  Nothing.</li>
    <li> I see no difference in the sun damage on my face and I have been using this consistently for over a month.  I apply morning and night after washing my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good news is, it doesn&#x27;t cause any damage to skin (no dryness or acne) and it works great as a moisturizer, bad news is that it doesn&#x27;t seem to have any bleaching ability.</li>
    <li> I purchased this cream after doing considerable research on the safety and effectiveness of skin lighteners. I have naturally very pale skin with some melasema and dark patches. This worked to lighten and even erase some of those spots in just a few weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About hydroquonone -the active ingredient in this cream- the only studies suggesting this may be carcinogenic, are ones where hydroquonone was administered to rats orally at full strength. No studies done topically on humans have had the similar results to the ones done on rats. In fact hydroquonone has been safely in use since 500 BCE that we know of.  The FDA has listed hydroquonone as safe up to 2% OTC and anything beyond that must prescribed.&lt;br /&gt;The only 2 potential issues are these;&lt;br /&gt;A very small percentage of people with darker skin may develop ochronosis, a condition that further darkens and thickens the skin. So do a patch test.&lt;br /&gt;Because hydroquonone suppresses melanin production, users will by more sun sensitive. So wear a stronger sunscreen then you are used to.</li>
    <li> I have been using this cream for about 2 months now and I have never seen a fade/bleaching agent so powerful and effective.  It is 3% hydroquinone so that may have alot to do wit it.  I am African American that have always suffered from acne as a result it left unsightly dark acne scars.  I&#x27;ve tried many creams with little success.  I&#x27;ve only been using this cream for about 2 months and I have seen fantastic results!! Some products take forever to start working but not this one, it starts to work immediately.  As the reviewer stated below, you must be careful to apply it with a q-tip because applying to an entire area will lighten marks but it will also lighten the surrounding areas which could cause a blotchy and uneven skin tone.  I am truly sold on this item and would recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> works on my elbows. The ingredients are not the best but it works. I always use suscreen on top if I wear short sleeve shirts.</li>
    <li> I bought this to try to fix the \\&quot;shadow\\&quot; that showed up after waxing. I&#x27;ve been battling with this \\&quot;shadow\\&quot; for over 2 years now, and I could still see it even with heavy makeup. I swear in 2 days I can see improvement, so this stuff does work. And it soaks into the skin, and it&#x27;s not greasy, and doesn&#x27;t smell too bad either.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t really seen any results but the cream is not heavy. i just expected quicker results after a few months use</li>
    <li> I used this product on my belly, post pregnancy (do not use if breast feeding) and it lightened the area slightly but it darkens again if you discontinue use. I will be seeing a dermatologist for recommendations as I would be concerned with continuing this long term.</li>
    <li> Great, this item really works.  I have used it for years.I would definitely recommend this to friends and family and would definitely purchase again.</li>
    <li> This product works! At first I was a little skeptical after a little bit of time using it, but then again I used it irregularly anyway. After I got more comfortable with it on my face I&#x27;ve since noticed that I&#x27;ve gone up at least 1 full shade, and all my acne scars from HS have faded quite dramatically. I don&#x27;t even have to use half the coverage I used to pack on out of shame. I&#x27;m lighter, brighter, and more all over even-toned. I will continue to use this product and I recommend it to anyone trying to lighten their skin or simply fade discolorations. The result window is  only a couple days, and you can increase or decrease usage whenever! Also, if you combine the use of Othine with a high SPF sunscreen, then you will be protected from the bleach hyperpigementing on  your skin and you won&#x27;t undo the brightness you&#x27;ve achieved either.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for about one month now, and I truly see a difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Years of tanning in salons as well as on beaches--well--has certainly left me with sun spots to deal with--which totally ages my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It took about a week before I noticed a more even tone to my skin--but I definitely do see a difference.  I am fair skinned, and my dark spots were really obvious without foundation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But what I am noticing now is, that after I wash my face, my skin tone looks so much more even.  The spots are fading slowly, but because I tend to spread this cream on pretty evenly across most of my face, my skin is showing a more youthful, even complexion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have spots on my neck from wearing my hair up in  a pony tail during hot summer months, so the sides of my neck have suffered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Every morning I rub some of this product on the two areas of my neck, and after one month they are almost half gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Namaste...</li>
    <li> FIRST OFF...I AM A BLACK WOMEN AND THIS STUFF WORKS LOL....BUT IT WILL ONLY WORK IF U FOLLOW THESE STEPS, REMEMBER U MUST WASH THE AREA WHERE U WILL APPLY THE CREME. I WOULD WASH MY FACE TWICE A DAY AND USE A SCRUB EVERY THREE DAYS SO THAT THE CREME CAN PENETRATE THE SKIN... DONT EXPECT RESULTS IN ONE DAY...GIVE IT TWO WEEKS TO START SEEING RESULTS...AND FYI I WAS DARK SKIN AND NOW MY FACE IS CARAMEL... AS FAR AS BLACK PEOPLE GO, THIS CREME WILL NOT BLEACH OUR SKIN. IT WILL ONLY WILL MAKE IT BRIGHTER.... I AM IMPRESSED!!! HOWEVER THE DARK ACNE SCARS DID NOT FADE OR BLEND COMPLETELY SO I WILL BE USING ANOTHER PRODUCT THAT CONTAINS HYDROQUIONE 10%(PRODERMA 10)</li>
    <li> I have a very Black girlfriend. I love her dearly but I want that cafe con leche look--not her michelin tire look. I used this in her face cream and while she&#x27;s still dark, she&#x27;s getting there.</li>
    <li> its ok, i haven&#x27;t been using it long enough to see results, but so far i have no complaints about this.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical, but i have faded all the freckles on my face to being unnoticable. highly recommend to anyone with light unwanted marks.</li>
    <li> Great product will buy again! Lightened my private area. Now feeling very confident! Take the time to purchase this and give it a chance</li>
