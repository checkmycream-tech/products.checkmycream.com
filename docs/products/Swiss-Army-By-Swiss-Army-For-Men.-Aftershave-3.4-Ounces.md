    <li> I think that the company did not send me aftershave. I believe that they sent to me a collonge called Swisss Army \\&quot;Tester\\&quot;. I love Swiss Army products. Thank you</li>

    <li> good afternoon my experience with the product did not fulfill its purpose because I did not get the ordered product was a shipping error, request an aftershave and I get a perfume</li>
    <li> This product was advertised as an after-shave lotion. A lotion to me, means sort of a creamy and moisturizing product.  This is NOT a lotion, but rather a regular old splash-on aftershave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product is fine if that&#x27;s what you want, but I was looking for a creamy type after shave lotion/balm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Many times Amazon lacks the detailed descriptions of products, so when ordering you are playing a guessing game.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disappointed!</li>

    <li> Venta Concretada, Recomendado \\&quot;☆☆☆☆☆\\&quot; !...</li>
