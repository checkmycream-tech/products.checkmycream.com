      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>It has a creamy, gourmand fragrance that is more sexy than fruity or floral.</li>
      <li>Mostly.</li>
      <li>so it&#x27;s great if you&#x27;re going for a polished blow out or straight</li>
      <li>They&#x27;re outstanding.</li>
      <li>I noticed I felt like I had to rinse a bit more because the silky feel of the conditioner makes you still think there&#x27;s lots of it in your hair.</li>
      <li>This product made my hair feel more like straw and frizzier.</li>
      <li>, I thought I wasn&#x27;t going to be able to comb my hair afterwards...</li>
      <li>I love it</li>
      <li>I love this conditioner and use it every day.</li>
      <li>I also love the smell of my hair.</li>
      <li>on more than one occassion, it&#x27;s taken me 10-15 minutes to brush it out.  </li>
      <li>but when I use this I feel that my hair is softer and My curls become more defined..</li>
      <li>Boy am I glad that I did.</li>
      <li>I really like how my hair feels since I switched to this conditioner about a month ago, and the price is great at $5.74.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad I don&#x27;t have to.</li>
      <li>but I love the smell</li>
      <li>but if I add and oil to my hair afterwards for moisture love it</li>
      <li>My hair is noticably stronger, more supple, and more shiny.</li>
      <li>This is one of my favorite Organix formulas.</li>
      <li>I am damn glad I am....</li>
      <li>favorite conditioner.</li>
      <li>It has a lovely scent to it which isn&#x27;t overpowering -</li>
      <li>Perhaps this would be best for someone with hair that is fine and not a dry type.</li>
      <li>I was looking for a great conditioner for my natural hair</li>
      <li>By the next day, my hair was incredibly greasy.</li>
      <li>I have used a keratin conditioner before and had good results but to me there&#x27;s something about this conditioner that doesn&#x27;t really soak into the hair.</li>
      <li>One of my tweaks was picking up this wonderful conditioner as well as the other products from this brand.</li>
      <li>I have trichotillomania, and my hair is easy to fall out because I pick on it.</li>
      <li>Easy to pour out too much&lt;br</li>
      <li>Even on the days I shampoo + not using this product, my hair is easy to comb through....</li>
      <li>after figuring that out: I literally started washing my nails with the shampoo/conditioner and my cuticles stopped peeling, and I get left with strong beautiful nails.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>This stuff is really pretty amazing.</li>
      <li>I have baby fine hair and need a conditioner that doesn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling</li>
      <li>The combination of products with the shampoo did a tremendous job on my hair!</li>
      <li>Although I love the fragrance and would not mind it if it lasted longer, the fragrance quickly dissipates.</li>
      <li>FANTASTIC.</li>
      <li>I even remember dragging a heavy bag that made my nails bend, and after that my nails were still perfect (except my nail polish chipped).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The keratin oil conditioner is beyond fantastic but the coconut shampoo was a disaster for me.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Nope leaves my hair super frizzy and extremely dry.</li>
    <li> This conditioner smells amazing but it is pretty heavy and I usually have to rinse it out twice before I get that greasy feeling out of my (thin) hair.  I love the matching shampoo though!</li>
    <li> I never write reviews but I just feel I need to make justice to this product. I have mix hair, oily scalp and dry ends. My hair is extremely thin and curly. I&#x27;ve been experiencing a terrible hair loss, that according to the doctor is genetic, so not much to do. I was prescribed vitamins and baby hair products, however the problem persisted and I almost gave up. So, looking on internet I started to get into organic stuff and just by chance discovered this product. I tried the biotin one, but I had a reaction on my scalp so I stopped using it. After reading tons of reviews I decided to give this product a try. I&#x27;ve been using it for 2 weeks now and I can tell you I have noticed a 50% reduction on hair lost, Plus my hair is really shine and super soft. At first I was afraid as I thought it might let my hair oily, but that&#x27;s not the case, in fact now I only need to shampoo every 3 days. Absolutely happy with this conditioner! Oh... and the smell in my hair is amazing! Can&#x27;t wait to see the results in a month!</li>
    <li> THIS IS THE ONLY CONDITIONER I&#x27;LL EVER USE EVER AGAIN OMG</li>
    <li> By far my favourite conditioner and I also use it as a leave in.</li>
    <li> Helps my hair feels really soft as if i relaxed my hair</li>
    <li> My hair has NEVER been this shiny! I love it</li>
    <li> This is a great product but was disappoint when I saw it cheaper in the local store. It&#x27;s way over priced</li>
    <li> Great for dry hair. Be sure to leave it in for at least a couple of minutes before washing out.</li>
    <li> I switched to this shampoo from Pantene Pro V hoping it would make my hair softer and help with damage. In actually did the opposite. This product made my hair feel more like straw and frizzier. The day I switched back to Pantene Pro V my hair was immediately softer and smoother again.</li>
    <li> Not only did this makes my hair super greasy, it made my hairline breakout!</li>
    <li> I finally found a product that puts the life back into my hair. After blow drying, my hair does not look dry and as frizzy as it used to. I noticed a huge difference after the first use.</li>
    <li> I did not order this product from this merchant so I cannot speak to the shipping speed or the overall quality of their service.&lt;br /&gt;Like another reviewer already mentioned, this stuff initially feels a little runny when you put it on your hands. Then you apply the conditioner and the SMELL is AMAZING!! I was expecting with the runny consistency that it might not be moisturizing, but that was not the case. I have mid-back length blonde hair that I dye dark brown. My hair is very fine and it is difficult to find products that don&#x27;t weigh my hair down, but still control frizz (south Florida humidity). This product is the only conditioner that has met my needs and I have tried a lot. Couldn&#x27;t be happier...ten stars.</li>
    <li> I have a great deal of wavy hair, but thin strands of hair. This stuff not only weighed my hair down, but it made it almost greasy and awful.</li>
    <li> Best conditioner I have bought lately. Makes my thick curly hair feel good even after blow drying and straightening it.</li>
    <li> This stuff is really pretty amazing. My hair was not incredibly damaged, but I do heat-style it, so this helped it come back to a soft, shiny state. I do have to be careful not to use it too often, or it starts to build up in my hair. Overall though, with careful use, it&#x27;s wonderful. And it smells good too.</li>
    <li> FANTASTIC. Works well, just about the same as the 3 minute miracle conditioner. I love it. Smells great. Leaves hair soft without too much oil.</li>
    <li> Hair feels super soft after use. Not a heavy or greasy feeling. Definitely recommended</li>
    <li> Would rate this five stars, but I have to use a lot of it to be effective. Love the smell! This conditioner has really improved my hair.</li>
    <li> I returned this after three uses. Horrible. It made my hair SO greasy, only after three hours after washing.</li>
    <li> The conditioner makes my hair all heavy and sticky. Not exactly what i was looking for.</li>
    <li> I love how this conditioner makes my hair feel. It is so incredibly soft. I also love the smell of my hair. I&#x27;ve tried other Organix products and loved them but this is my clear favorite.</li>
    <li> This can really leave your hair feeling strong, healthy and shinny!&lt;br /&gt;there&#x27;s not pretty much things to say about it because is sooooo freaking good. the only thing that I dont like is the smell it has... for my teaste is very strong</li>
    <li> just bought today, used once and so in love with it! i use it with the shampoo but i feel that the conditioner makes me hair feel like so healthy! I had just gone through a bad experience with hair dye and was experiencing a ton of split ends. This conditioner goes on so smoothly and you can really feel it healing and softening your hair. Will buy again! I don&#x27;t really care for the scent but its not awful</li>
    <li> I only bought the weightless leave in oil. This is the best I have ever used.ever.Next shampoo and conditioner. Wonderful.</li>
    <li> i love this product very much ill used every 2 days or maybe every two weeks its keeps my har shiny &amp; beatifull</li>
    <li> I bought this shampoo and conditioner about four months ago, and was not impressed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. It made my head itch.&lt;br /&gt;2. It gave me head zits (or whatever they are call).&lt;br /&gt;3. My hair became very oily because I have thin straight hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I stopped using it, and would only use it once in a while to switch up my hair washing routine. Once my hair gets used to the product, then the product stops working.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a month of having it I started using it again because it was the only shampoo and conditioner I had left. I used it for about a month and a half and it did nothing to my hair as much as I can tell, but the itching went away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then a miracle happened: I noticed that my flimsy, thin, never able to grow out nails haven’t broke, chipped, or peeled in a month. I was stunned!!! I even went through a move, which requires lots of lifting, dragging, and tons of unpacking. I was all bruised up but not a single nail chipped or broken. I even remember dragging a heavy bag that made my nails bend, and after that my nails were still perfect (except my nail polish chipped).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What could it be in my life that has changed?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ding ding ding the shampooing has.&lt;br /&gt;So after figuring that out: I literally started washing my nails with the shampoo/conditioner and my cuticles stopped peeling, and I get left with strong beautiful nails.&lt;br /&gt;I will keep using the shampoo on my hair and nails. If it does miracles for my nails, I wonder what it will do for my hair in the long run.&lt;br /&gt;I hope you all get the results you crave.</li>
    <li> This conditioner works well with the shampoo of the same name for helping dry damaged hair feel and look softer. I have used it three times and have noticed a difference in my hair. It works well for overly processed hair.</li>
    <li> This is by far my favorite brand of shampoo and conditioner. I like every single offering from this brand and you can&#x27;t beat it for the price. I have baby fine straight hair and this conditioner makes my hair feel so manageable without weighing it down. It&#x27;s unlike any shampoo and conditioner set I have ever found. Tons of body without any flyaways. If I had to pick just one this might be it. I&#x27;m glad I don&#x27;t have to.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t really know what to say about this brand except that it&#x27;s sulfate free, which makes it for me.</li>
    <li> Perfect. I started using the entire product line of the OGX Keratin Oil about 8 months ago to fix my breaking, falling out, damaged hair. It has worked miracles. My hair is noticably stronger, more supple, and more shiny. And it is no longer falling out.</li>
    <li> I have thick, course, curly/wavy hair that I prefer to wear straight. This conditioner makes my hair feel like silk! I don&#x27;t even have to use biosilk or chi products to get it that way.. It is the best ever!!!!!</li>
    <li> favorite conditioner. I have super dry and frizzy hair but when I use this it&#x27;s soft and silky. I have split ends but this works really well keeping my hair from breaking more.</li>
    <li> Pleasant and somewhat mild smell (thank goodness), and it does wonders for my hair. I&#x27;ve been using the Pantene Anti-Breakage Shampoo and Conditioner up till now, but with that shampoo and this conditioner I don&#x27;t have to use nearly as much and my hair ends up much smoother and softer now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product. Odd bottle shape.</li>
    <li> The combination of products with the shampoo did a tremendous job on my hair! Definitely reduced the shedding. I have trichotillomania, and my hair is easy to fall out because I pick on it. This definitely helped me prevent some bald spots.</li>
    <li> my hair is really dry and gets impossibly tangled after i wash it.  on more than one occassion, it&#x27;s taken me 10-15 minutes to brush it out.  with this conditioner, that time gets cut in half.  also, it makes my hair softer overall.  i recommend.</li>
    <li> My daughter has thick, long, curly hair (she would call it frizzy. I would not). She finds this (and other) Organix product keeps it manageable, with fewer split ends.</li>
    <li> Everyone in the household likes this conditioner! With that being said, now I have to hide it!  Lol  :)&lt;br /&gt;Thanks</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this conditioner for almost a week and it has already started to bring my hair back to its normal beautiful, fullness and shimmer. I really like the smell of the conditioner, smells fresh.&lt;br /&gt; * I would recommend to all my friends and family*</li>
    <li> The keratin in this product is very helpful in strengthening hair, but this product can be purchased at the neighborhood corner drugstore for about 33% less.</li>
    <li> Seems to help strengthen my hair, like it</li>
    <li> I never EVER write reviews. Let me make that clear. However, I purchased this shampoo/conditioner and it&#x27;s truly amazing. The smell is outstanding, it makes my hair so soft and shiny, and let me point out that I used pureology for THREE YEARS. I decided I needed to switch to something cheaper. This is 20-30 dollars LESS a bottle and its even better. HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS!</li>
    <li> My hair felt great and a lot stronger after use and less breakage. I love this brand, their products really works.</li>
    <li> This conditioner is AMAZING. I have recently developed a love for oils for my body and hair and when I saw this I thought why not give it a try. Boy am I glad that I did. This makes my hair SO soft and best of all the smell is amazing. I am SO happy with this and def will be repurchasing!</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this item! When in combination with other oil products (Shampoo &amp; healing oil) it is the absolute BEST!! I have very thick hair &amp; I have been looking for a product(s) that could tame my mane, but at the same time, did not weigh my hair down &amp; this is it! The three products left my hair full &amp; voluminous with shine! Also love the scent of it! Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I swim every day and this seems to really work.</li>
    <li> While searching for products that are not tested on animals, I took a chance on this brand after reading the amazing reviews here and was blown away by its awesomeness. After discovering how wonderful [[ASIN:B00ADRH2OM OGX Shampoo, Thick &amp; Full Biotin &amp; Collagen, 13oz]], [[ASIN:B00J4WHURG (OGX) Organix Conditioner Biotin &amp; Collagen 13oz]], and [[ASIN:B00HVKAUTS OGX Weightless Healing Oil Mist, Thick and Full Biotin and Collagen, 4 Ounce]] are, I explored more of their products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Truthfully, I&#x27;m not that great with my hair and have never really been. I&#x27;ve put it through hell and it shows. However I recently changed all that. It has been an adventure to see what improvements can be made with a few tweaks. One of my tweaks was picking up this wonderful conditioner as well as the other products from this brand. I also started using [[ASIN:B0006VVN1S Culligan WSH-C125 Wall-Mount 10,000 Gallon Capacity Filtered Showerhead, Chrome Finish]] (it is a MUST if your hair sucks and you live in a place with hard water), invested in a [[ASIN:B001T0HHDS Babyliss Pro BABNT5548 2000 Watt Ionic Nano Titanium with Integrated Ion Generator Hair Dryer]], and picked up more of the right tools.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On to the review: I love, love, love how soft and pretty this conditioner makes my hair. I leave it on for 3-5 minutes a few times a week and have seen great results. It has a creamy, gourmand fragrance that is more sexy than fruity or floral. Although I love the fragrance and would not mind it if it lasted longer, the fragrance quickly dissipates. With continued use of this conditioner I can see my ends becoming less frayed and more sealed. This conditioner made my hair sleek and slightly heavy so it&#x27;s great if you&#x27;re going for a polished blow out or straight look. If you&#x27;re going for fuller hair, bouncy curls or doing something up, definitely try the Thick &amp; Full volume products from this brand. They&#x27;re outstanding. As far as the price, I bought it here on Amazon for $5.62, which is about what it goes for in stores. I&#x27;ve never seen it sold for less than $5 which, considering how great it is, is a steal and a half.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please note: I don&#x27;t use the shampoo with this conditioner. I use [[ASIN:B00HVKBDCQ OGX Shampoo, Quenched Sea Mineral Moisture, 13 Ounce]] instead because I didn&#x27;t want the keratin oil products to weigh my hair down. The Sea Mineral Moisture is great and the two balance out together well.at it goes for in stores.

    <li> I have been using the OGX shampoo which I like and decided to try the OGX Conditioner. I have baby fine hair and need a conditioner that doesn&#x27;t leave my hair feeling greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The OGX conditioner has a nice fragrance, good consistency and leaves my hair feeling smooth. However, it seems my hair requires more frequent washing when using this conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bottle opening is a bit too large and it&#x27;s easy to pour much more than necessary. However, overall, it&#x27;s a good conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;- Nice fragrance and consistency&lt;br /&gt;- Goes on smoothly&lt;br /&gt;- Hair feels less dry&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;- Easy to pour out too much&lt;br /&gt;- Need to wash hair more frequently</li>
    <li> Love this! Keeps my hair very smooth without adding too many additional products. It also smells great!</li>
    <li> Love it but dries my hair out extremely but I love the smell but if I add and oil to my hair afterwards for moisture love it</li>
    <li> This is one of my favorite Organix formulas. It really does cut down on frizz and condition without weighing hair down.  I have hair with some curl, fine that frizzes, my one daughter has long naturally curly hair that is fine and frizzes.  This product works well for both of us.  For my other daughter that has straight hair that&#x27;s a bit more course, she prefers other formulas as her hair got greasy faster using this one.  I love it, though!</li>
    <li> Although it makes my hair manageable, soft and shiny, it also makes it relatively greasy. I&#x27;m the type of person who likes to shower every other day. And I couldn&#x27;t attain this while using this shampoo. By the next day, my hair was incredibly greasy. It smelled good and it was really soft, but it was really oily. I had mildly bleached my hair before, and my hair is also incredibly long, so I thought it would be a good product. Also, it&#x27;s really heavy. The shampoo is very thick and so is the conditioner. I don&#x27;t know about you, but I will most likely not purchase this product again.</li>
    <li> This works amazing and I would recommend to anyone who needs a little extra conditioning to their hair~!! I will order again and again~!!</li>
    <li> I like the way it smells and it makes my hair soft. I honestly do not know if it has any other benefits for my hair though. I&#x27;m still trying to find the &amp;#34;perfect&amp;#34; shampoo and conditioner to strengthen my hair and help it grow faster. I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;ll stop here.</li>
    <li> This conditioner really keeps my hair moist and not dry.</li>
    <li> I really like this conditioner. I have really dry, damaged hair and suffer from a lot of breakage. This helped smooth things out and keep my hair soft and strong. It also has a really nice scent.</li>
    <li> This is the BEST conditioner ever. My hair is singing with happiness. Never will I ever use another kind. Not all OBX&#x27;s have given my hair this joy. The Keratin Oil is just awesome!</li>
    <li> Not as good as I thought</li>
    <li> I bought this product at Christmas Tree Shop for 6.99 along with the Coconut Shampoo because I was looking for a good shampoo/conditioner that wasn&#x27;t too expensive. The coconut shampoo made my hair feel so dry and brittle. I was scared to death because it was so hard, I thought I wasn&#x27;t going to be able to comb my hair afterwards... I was upset while washing my hair but still decided to try the keratin oil conditioner. The keratin oil conditioner instantly made my dry brittle hair (from the shampoo) soft within seconds. My hair has NEVER been that soft from a conditioner!!!! I was in the shower thanking the Lord, because I thought I would have to rewash my hair all over again with other shampoo products in my home. I definitely recommend trying different lines of the Organix products. The keratin oil conditioner is beyond fantastic but the coconut shampoo was a disaster for me. I will probably pick up the keratin oil shampoo or try another shampoo to see how it works. It just depends on your hair, and the products or cheap enough to try. Good luck everyone!</li>
    <li> This conditioner makes my very damaged hair so soft it is unbelievable — and it is not too heavy. I don&#x27;t think I will ever buy another conditioner.</li>
    <li> This is easily the best conditioner on the market in my view. It has a lovely scent to it which isn&#x27;t overpowering - it just makes my hair look, feel and smell wonderful.</li>
    <li> I Am A Die Hard Fan For Some Organix products. I have been using this conditioner for almost a year and it awesome. It leaves my hair so soft and touchable. I already have soft hair but when I use this I feel that my hair is softer and My curls become more defined.. which is always plus</li>
    <li> This stuff is great :) makes my hair so much easier to work with.</li>
    <li> I love this conditioner and use it every day. It is overpriced on Amazon though and you can find it at Walmart, Target, or the grocery store (in Texas, H-E-B) for $5-6 and sometimes they even have it on sale for the same price but the much bigger bottle.</li>
    <li> I used this today following the kukui oil shampoo (from the same company) because sometimes I do that mix &amp; match &amp; I was taken aback a bit on how good it smelled as I&#x27;m not use to using perfumie stuff like how I don&#x27;t like extras in my food (additives, preservatives, food coloring) as soon as I dispensed it onto my hand. I was also surprised by the color (it&#x27;s not pink like the bottle). I noticed I felt like I had to rinse a bit more because the silky feel of the conditioner makes you still think there&#x27;s lots of it in your hair.</li>
    <li> This conditioner smells so good.  It makes my hair feel so soft.  I was looking for a great conditioner for my natural hair and I found it!!! LOVE LOVE LOVE</li>
    <li> As stated  in the shampoo review, for some reason, I am re-growing hair with this shampoo/conditioner combination. Can think of no other change that could account for this! Also, it makes my hair feel stronger, less hair in the brush and the texture is luscious!</li>
    <li> I bought this conditioner because I&#x27;ve been going long periods between haircuts and wanted something to help reduce the number of split ends. This conditioner has worked really well for that! My hair is noticeably smoother using this. I also really enjoy the scent of the product-- it&#x27;s a mature, more complex smell than a lot of the other floral or citrus hair products out there.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this condicioner! I bought it along with the shampoo and they both work great together. It leaves your hair soft you can really feel it doesn&#x27;t have alcohol and other stuff other products usually have. I totally recommend this.</li>
    <li> There are not enough stars for this product. I have dry hair and this is literally the only product I can find that makes my hair soft, smooth, shiny, and manageable. Mostly. Smells great and works great! I love this conditioner! Organix is a great brand of product and it has taken over my bathroom. I highly recommend this conditioner! Its a nice price for an amazing product! This is by far my favorite conditioner out of all the ones from cheap drug store to hairdresser recommended. A must have for dry, unmanageable hair. I can see the difference and ive only been using it a few weeks.</li>
    <li> I have used a keratin conditioner before and had good results but to me there&#x27;s something about this conditioner that doesn&#x27;t really soak into the hair. It seems a bit too light for my dry hair. Perhaps this would be best for someone with hair that is fine and not a dry type.</li>
    <li> I have never written a review on Amazon, but this product has me compelled to write my very first one.... I bought this @ the drugstore looking to buy John Frieda Full Repair  again because that was the last conditioner I was using.... I don&#x27;t condition every day, I do it every other day.... My older sister advised me years ago that because I had oily hair that I should only shampoo my scalp every other day and only condition my ends on the others.... I find that worked for me + been doing it ever since.... No matter on whether I am shampooing or conditioning, my hair is prone to tangles + straying.... So, anyways, I saw that the store didn&#x27;t have the shampoo I usually used, my boyfriend told me I should try Organix purely because of what the bottle looked like.... On a whim, I decided to go with what he said.... I am damn glad I am.... I only been using it for a few weeks + can tell a difference right away.... For the first time, I can definitely notice I barely have any tangles @ all when combing my wet hair....Even on the days I shampoo + not using this product, my hair is easy to comb through.... It&#x27;s like a miracle! I almost want to give this 5 stars, but I didn&#x27;t want to prematurely do it since I hadn&#x27;t been using this for long time.... ;-)p</li>
    <li> I really like how my hair feels since I switched to this conditioner about a month ago, and the price is great at $5.74.  If Amazon happens to increase the price, you can also find Oxo keratin conditioner at major discount stores.</li>
