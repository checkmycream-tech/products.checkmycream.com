### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Great price on Amazon!</li>
      <li>Excellent seller.</li>
      <li>I choose Rogaine Foam because is the best way to apply minoxidil 5% in your head at day time.</li>
      <li>This is like the best invention for balding men- almost like the sliced bread for the hungry!  </li>
      <li>thank u great product.  </li>
      <li>but I have successfully stopped my hair loss and it looks better every</li>
      <li>Smells nice, too.  </li>
      <li>I will be using Rogaine for another 3 months to make my judgement more fair, and if it doesn&#x27;t work, that&#x27;s it for me.</li>
      <li>Easy to use and effective!  </li>
      <li>leaves your hair in best shape the whole day,I will recommended to another users and I am Okay with the price (lower than in Pharmacy or Walmart), and the service I received.</li>
      <li>This foam is very easy to apply and doesn&#x27;t give the look that you did either, unlike the liquid minoxidil which shows on your head after applying.</li>
      <li>The service was fast and the price was very good.</li>
      <li>I think mostly because I was in denial that I was losing my hair and that it would just stop on its own.</li>
      <li>My hair is much better than before.</li>
      <li>Will return again to buy more.</li>
      <li>but he was thinning on the top front area of his head...</li>
      <li>So, it might be that the effects of Rogaine are a lot more variable than advertised.</li>
      <li>I used it for about 8 months and quit after noticing that I was losing more hair then ever before.</li>
      <li>So easy to use.</li>
      <li>- huge change in my confidence.</li>
      <li>information that seems credible...</li>
      <li>It didn&#x27;t work, and much to my dismay and horror, I have now lost substantially more hair at a substantially faster pace than I was losing before using Rogaine.</li>
      <li>Am I expecting a full head of hair??</li>
      <li>well, I&#x27;ve been seeing side effects more than good results, every type of hair on my face is growing faster, that includes facial hair, eyebrows, and even nose hair, but my scalp&#x27;s hair is still steadily receding, it&#x27;s not stopping nor regrowing, but KEEPS RECEDING.</li>
      <li>Thanks Rogaine!!</li>
      <li>WOW i love this product . . .</li>
      <li>, right (he rhetorically asks)?</li>
      <li>Thanks Bill Rancic!</li>
      <li>It really helps!</li>
      <li>I have consistently used this product for about six months now.</li>
      <li>It must be me, perhaps the higher dosage would be the way to go</li>
      <li>As far as effectivity my doctor said it is working although it might take six months to see the full result.</li>
      <li>I really see the improvement on my friend.  </li>
      <li>cant really tell how well its working yet...</li>
      <li>how much I shock the</li>
      <li>Thanks Rogaine.</li>
      <li>Fast sbipping, product was as described.</li>
      <li>It really works after 6 weeks</li>
      <li>The foam is a much better alternative to other forms of these products.</li>
      <li>I have been using it for more than half a year</li>
      <li>As far as hair loss goes,  I haven&#x27;t really seen much regrowth</li>
      <li>but this time he may be following the direction right, because his hair is really growing.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
      <li>It is not back to being full but it there is marked difference.  </li>
      <li>Apparently there are also cases where the treatment has worked, but has taken between 6 months and 2 years for any results to be evident.</li>
      <li>A palm full of foam, rub it in, and it&#x27;s dry literally in minutes.  </li>
      <li>It is easy to get in the habit of applying it because you don&#x27;t have to worry about it dripping down like the liquid did.</li>
      <li>I am on month 4 and am growing new hair.</li>
      <li>the first quarter of that period saw actual growth of say 10%.</li>
      <li>The key is to apply it to the root of your hair, and to be consistent.  </li>
      <li>The foam, though more expensive, is well worth it.  </li>
      <li>however, there are plenty of anecdotal cases online where apparently hair lose has happened that has not been compensated by new hair growth even after years of use, or even after stopping the treatment.</li>
      <li>The original liquid left my hair so greasy and wet</li>
      <li>After all the shedding, I freaked out, and have started to make much more serious online research about Rogaine.</li>
      <li>I have been using this for 5 months now and not really seen much happening with the hair loss..</li>
      <li>the 3 cans the last one, near the end of the bottle started to liquidity again no matter</li>
      <li>When the can is almost empty Rogaine starts to liquidify no matter how much I shake the can.  </li>

<li> the 3 cans the last one, near the end of the bottle started to liquidity again no matter</li>
<li> When the can is almost empty Rogaine starts to liquidify no matter how much I shake the can.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;ve heard from several people that the &#x27;liquid/gel&#x27; is difficult to use, but this has been easy.  </li>
<li> I have been using other minoxidil products prior to this for about 2 months, and I continued with Rogaine about 2 months as well, so</li>
<li> I try to apply it every other night prior to sleeping.  </li>
<li> Twice a day just squeeze out the recommended amount into your palm and massage it with your fingers onto a dry scalp.</li>
<li> Rogaine claims that you will lose hair initially and then it will regrow, but that was an absolute farce in my case.</li>
<li> Granted, the instructions tells you that some shedding might occur for hair that you would have lost anyways, however, I am loosing weak/thin, but also and thick, normal looking hair.</li>
<li> Invest a few extra bucks and go with the foam.</li>
<li> and I still have a glimmer hope that there will be some growth in the next few months</li>
<li> the product it was empty</li>
<li> the total was about 4 months of minoxidil (twice everyday)..</li>
<li> It&#x27;s messy, extremely limited in how it would work and where, and the possible side affects were less than desirable for he very minor benefit one hoped to attain.</li>
<li> Extremely noticeable changes.</li>
<li> By the way at night you can use other product that can leave your hair greasy, but can be cheaper(Hair DRX for example).</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve decided to stop Rogaine and loose the hair I have left slowly, rather than look 50 in just a few months.</li>
<li> So much less hassel.  </li>
<li> Since the initial spurt though, I have not experienced any growth whatsoever.</li>
<li> My friend use it a few time</li>
<li> There is very little &amp;#34;formal&amp;#34;</li>
<li> that I found myself not using it, which was pointless.  </li>
<li> It is small peach fuzz</li>
<li> Also with the foam, it&#x27;s less irritating to my scalp than the liquid.  </li>
<li> barber said the patch hasnt gotten any worse of the past 5 months, so maybe that&#x27;s the proof it works.  </li>
<li> It might work for you, it might make things a lot worse.</li>
<li> The kicker is that when I quit using it at the suggestion of a Rogaine representative (who sounded alarmed when I described my results), my hair thinning became much worse in the aftermath.</li>
<li> My hair looks worse than ever.</li>
<li> I am sick to my stomach over this fiasco and I am uglier because of it.</li>
<li> I hated that streaks the liquid showed and people do notice it.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> the product it was empty</li>
    <li> husband has been using it for about 3 months... cant really tell how well its working yet... but he was thinning on the top front area of his head... and it doesnt look to be any thinner!</li>
    <li> My boyfriend is an African American male and we were concerned that it would not work as well for him.  He has been using it for three months and everyone has noticed the difference.  It is not back to being full but it there is marked difference.  Even his barber is wondering what is going on.</li>
    <li> it is only been a month and I used propecia with the rogaine and I still have a glimmer hope that there will be some growth in the next few months so I gave it a neutral rating</li>
    <li> Fast sbipping, product was as described. Will return again to buy more. Ron Paul 2012. Ron Paul 2012, ron Paul 2012.</li>
    <li> Save yourself some money and just buy the Minoxidol by Kertland.  It is the same stuff.  No need for the name brand.</li>
    <li> I have the type of hair loss that Rogaine is supposed to help (vortex balding) and guess what? It didn&#x27;t work, and much to my dismay and horror, I have now lost substantially more hair at a substantially faster pace than I was losing before using Rogaine. I used it for about 8 months and quit after noticing that I was losing more hair then ever before. Rogaine claims that you will lose hair initially and then it will regrow, but that was an absolute farce in my case. The kicker is that when I quit using it at the suggestion of a Rogaine representative (who sounded alarmed when I described my results), my hair thinning became much worse in the aftermath. I am sick to my stomach over this fiasco and I am uglier because of it. Thanks Bill Rancic! Thanks Rogaine!!</li>
    <li> This foam is very easy to apply and doesn&#x27;t give the look that you did either, unlike the liquid minoxidil which shows on your head after applying. I hated that streaks the liquid showed and people do notice it. Save the embarrassment and get the foam. It is easy to get in the habit of applying it because you don&#x27;t have to worry about it dripping down like the liquid did. Very simple to use while watching television or surfing the net.</li>
    <li> The foam is a much better alternative to other forms of these products. So easy to use. Twice a day just squeeze out the recommended amount into your palm and massage it with your fingers onto a dry scalp. Don&#x27;t forget to wash your hands immediately after. The stuff dries in minutes and no one will know it&#x27;s there. The service was fast and the price was very good. Excellent seller.</li>
    <li> I choose Rogaine Foam because is the best way to apply minoxidil 5% in your head at day time. leaves your hair in best shape the whole day,I will recommended to another users and I am Okay with the price (lower than in Pharmacy or Walmart), and the service I received. By the way at night you can use other product that can leave your hair greasy, but can be cheaper(Hair DRX for example).</li>
    <li> I have been using this for over 2 weeks now, and in 2 weeks I have lost the hair I would have lost in probably 2 years. My hair looks worse than ever. Granted, the instructions tells you that some shedding might occur for hair that you would have lost anyways, however, I am loosing weak/thin, but also and thick, normal looking hair. My scalp is not red, or inflamed, so I do not think is the result of an allergic reaction. After all the shedding, I freaked out, and have started to make much more serious online research about Rogaine. There is very little &amp;#34;formal&amp;#34; information that seems credible... however, there are plenty of anecdotal cases online where apparently hair lose has happened that has not been compensated by new hair growth even after years of use, or even after stopping the treatment. Apparently there are also cases where the treatment has worked, but has taken between 6 months and 2 years for any results to be evident. So, it might be that the effects of Rogaine are a lot more variable than advertised. It might work for you, it might make things a lot worse. Rogaine does not waranty that you will recover the hair you shed. So you decide if you want to take a gamble. I&#x27;ve decided to stop Rogaine and loose the hair I have left slowly, rather than look 50 in just a few months.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for quite a while.  My doctor recommended it when my hair starting thinning.  I&#x27;ve heard from several people that the &#x27;liquid/gel&#x27; is difficult to use, but this has been easy.  I try to apply it every other night prior to sleeping.  The key is to apply it to the root of your hair, and to be consistent.  Great price on Amazon!</li>
    <li> Been using for a year now and it is helping. I have not regrown any of my lost hair, however I have stopped loosing hair. I do not have hair on my pillow and no hair coming out in the shower so it is helping me keep the hair I have. Will continue to use.</li>
    <li> This is like the best invention for balding men- almost like the sliced bread for the hungry!  Easy to use and effective!  Smells nice, too.  I have retained hair and got some back.  Seriously, I only have praises for this foam Rogaine! Thanks Rogaine.</li>
    <li> It really works after 6 weeks i got a sign of hope WOW i love this product . . .</li>
    <li> I have been using this for 5 months now and not really seen much happening with the hair loss.. I have another month of recommended usage before anything should start to happen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of the 3 cans the last one, near the end of the bottle started to liquidity again no matter how much I shock the can it was the same, I used it anyways but just a smaller amount to cover the problem patch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My barber said the patch hasnt gotten any worse of the past 5 months, so maybe that&#x27;s the proof it works.  I believe I can do further updates and will do in another 2 months</li>
    <li> thank u great product.  the product took approx. 3 months to see results.  after 5 months my hair is back to when I was in my teens</li>
    <li> i&#x27;ve been using rogaine for 7 months now, and i&#x27;ve noticed that my hair loss reduced a lot (like 85%) its not a miraculous thing, you have to use the product twice a day every day or you will start loosing your hair again.</li>
    <li> I have been using other minoxidil products prior to this for about 2 months, and I continued with Rogaine about 2 months as well, so the total was about 4 months of minoxidil (twice everyday).. well, I&#x27;ve been seeing side effects more than good results, every type of hair on my face is growing faster, that includes facial hair, eyebrows, and even nose hair, but my scalp&#x27;s hair is still steadily receding, it&#x27;s not stopping nor regrowing, but KEEPS RECEDING. I will be using Rogaine for another 3 months to make my judgement more fair, and if it doesn&#x27;t work, that&#x27;s it for me.</li>
    <li> as adverticed, but i dont like reginms, its anying to constantly trying to remember hwen to get to it ..</li>
    <li> This product sucked for me. It&#x27;s messy, extremely limited in how it would work and where, and the possible side affects were less than desirable for he very minor benefit one hoped to attain.</li>
    <li> The foam, though more expensive, is well worth it.  So much less hassel.  A palm full of foam, rub it in, and it&#x27;s dry literally in minutes.  The original liquid left my hair so greasy and wet that I found myself not using it, which was pointless.  Invest a few extra bucks and go with the foam. As far as hair loss goes,  I haven&#x27;t really seen much regrowth BUT my hair isn&#x27;t continuing to fall out.  I&#x27;ve been using the foam since it came out.  Also with the foam, it&#x27;s less irritating to my scalp than the liquid.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I really see the improvement on my friend.  My friend use it a few time but this time he may be following the direction right, because his hair is really growing.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this stuff for over a year now...diligently with no results. It must be me, perhaps the higher dosage would be the way to go</li>
    <li> When the can is almost empty Rogaine starts to liquidify no matter how much I shake the can.  As far as effectivity my doctor said it is working although it might take six months to see the full result.</li>
    <li> I have been using it for more than half a year and I applied it to my head twice a day. It really helps! My hair is much better than before.</li>
    <li> If you are on the fence with this product I can assure you so was I. I think mostly because I was in denial that I was losing my hair and that it would just stop on its own. My only regret with this product is that I didn&#x27;t start sooner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Downside: Once you start you can&#x27;t stop using it, you will lose whatever hair you&#x27;ve regrown. Not overnight of course, but you will lose it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Upside: I used religiously and within 3 months I had thicker hair of everything that was thinning out drastically. Extremely noticeable changes. I am on month 4 and am growing new hair. It is small peach fuzz like but is getting darker and is helping cover my scalp in areas where I was losing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The box says has a disclaimer that it is not for receding hairlines. That&#x27;s just for managing expectations, it works. Am I expecting a full head of hair?? No but I have successfully stopped my hair loss and it looks better every month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do it. - huge change in my confidence.</li>
    <li> I have consistently used this product for about six months now. the first quarter of that period saw actual growth of say 10%. Since the initial spurt though, I have not experienced any growth whatsoever. Sounds like I would be pissed then, right (he rhetorically asks)? Actually not in that the Rogaine has STOPPED any and all loss of hair and help to thicken it. Therefore I can recommend the product though YMMV.</li>
