<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I purchased this because of the amazing reviews!! I wanted to love this product, but I do not! It doesn&#x27;t curl my eyelashes and it feels like it is cheaply made! It made a rattle sound every time I squeeze down.. very disappointed! I wish I would of just built a sephora curler instead!! :(</li>
    <li> The best eyelash curler ever!  And the box is even adorable and makes a perfect gift ~ especially for a teenager!  I can&#x27;t wait to try their other products!</li>
    <li> First eyelash curler I have used that doesn&#x27;t pinch. Very easy to use. Will probably order another for my travel bag soon.</li>
    <li> Best eyelash curler I&#x27;ve ever owned. I used to buy the cheap drugstore ones, thinking how much better could this technology get? It seemed that there was a low price point, mid and high price point for eyelash curlers. I feel that this one was in the middle, but as excellent as any high sale point. My eyelashes are naturally quite straight, and with this I don&#x27;t have to repeatedly curl. It&#x27;s great!</li>
    <li> Finally an eyelash curler even I can use--it works well and doesn&#x27;t pinch. Love it.</li>
    <li> You barely have to squeeze this for it to work.  I can see where it might pinch easily, but just be careful.  Love the curl it gives you!</li>
    <li> I love it and it doesn&#x27;t hurt when you try to curl your lashes.</li>
    <li> It definitely does what it says it does, and I don&#x27;t struggle with the unwanted pain and pinching of my eyelashes and eyelids like I have with other eye curlers!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;tt care for this eyelash curler at all.I&#x27;ve had cheap $3 curlers work better</li>
    <li> Delivered Promptly  Works well without pinching  Would recommend</li>
    <li> I have really short eyelashes and it is hard to find a curler that fits the curve of my lash line well, until I found this eyelash curler. It does the job and does it well. It is easy to use, and gives my lashes a really nice curl which makes my mascara work that much better.</li>
    <li> I never thought that there could be that much differences in eyelash curlers, but I am pleasantly surprised.  This one is easy and comfortable to use; no pinching or anything.  It also gets all of the lashes, and they do curl as opposed to just crimping.  I really like this company.  Their products are quality.</li>
    <li> Beat eyelash curler I&#x27;ve ever gotten! I love it! The only thing I don&#x27;t like is it pokes my upper eyelid when curling.</li>
    <li> Best eyelash curler I have ever used.</li>
    <li> I was really hoping for this to wow me. I love the design and the appeal to it. But, it doesn&#x27;t do much for my short, straight lashes. I have tried many different techniques but they never stay curled for over a minute. They did not pull my lashes out or cut them off and I have applied quiet a bit of pressure to them. I have better results with a much cheaper curler though. Although these didn&#x27;t work for me I think that for most people they will be great for so I would still recommend these.</li>
    <li> Perfect gift! Love this curler, it works great!!</li>
    <li> First of all, soooo pretty, both the packaging and the eyelash curler itself. But of course, I do not want my eyelash curler to be cute, I want it to make my lashes pretty and curly and this does the job!  I was impressed with the grips, it is easy and comfortable to hold in my my fingers and it holds together the eyelashes in the curler easily without the annoying pinch of inferior curlers.  I am happy to say that I not only love my Bella and Bear eyelash curlers because they are pretty but because it makes my lashes look gorgeous with zero pain!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the She Umera curler for past few years until it got stood on! On receiving this curler,  I was cautious trying it at first incase of pinching but with a couple of tries I find it very effective at curling my lashes. I especially appreciate the spring loaded mechanism and the comfort grip on the handles. That they came in pretty floral chintzy packaging with a little drawstring bag is a bonus!</li>
    <li> Super high quality, great size, very pleased with this curler.</li>
    <li> This is the first product I ever returned to Amazon. I thought from the reviews it would be decent, but instead learned that free products bias reviewers whether they realize it or not. This did not curl my lashes. Worse then that was the metal was actually extremely SHARP at the corners, and scratched up my lids. I was shocked that anyone would let this thing into consumers hands when it actually injures you. Outrageous!</li>
    <li> I am not overly impressed with this eyelash curler. Performs the same as any other cheaper version I can purchase at Walmart. I prefer heated eyelash curlers. They curl better and the curl lasts unlike this one.</li>
    <li> Nice handle, easy to grip. Doesn&#x27;t rip out my eyelashes. Seem really sturdy. These will definitely last.</li>
    <li> It is the worst I have ever bought. Not only does it not curl, it pinches too.</li>
    <li> It was time to replace my old eyelash curler and I was lucky to obtain a good coupon for this product. I really like using it. Works great.</li>
    <li> Eh, there is NOTHING special about this curler. I bought it a couple of months ago and should have returned it right away but thought if I just got used to it that it really would work as advertised. Now I just can&#x27;t be bothered. Back to using my cheap Revlon curler. Works much better.</li>
    <li> Best eyelash curler ever!  I bought myself one...WOW!  So I have bought one for my daughter, and now one for my mother!  I have been using an eyelash curler since I was probably 13, I am going to be 50 this year, and this is the best eyelash curler I have ever used...hands down!</li>
    <li> This curler is o.k., I find it very hard to squeeze and thus not very comfortable.  It doesn&#x27;t pull or pinch but doesn&#x27;t seem to work any better than my old school Maybelline curler.....</li>
    <li> I love this eyelash curler.  The curler does a great job and really makes my eyes pop.</li>
    <li> This thing is awesome! I had never heard of the brand and frankly bought it because of the reviews. Well they weren&#x27;t wrong!  Probably the most sturdy and well made curler yet! My lashes are rockin!</li>
    <li> This is an absolutely amazing eyelash curler! It takes a little bit of practice, but having gone through a ton of cheap crappy curlers, this is great! I would highly recommend, this is a truly sturdy and quality product.</li>
    <li> So far I love this product it is easy to use and does a nice job on my lashes.</li>
    <li> This one works when others do not.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t seem to get all of my eyelash in the curler in one go. It clamps nicely, the instructions are good, and the pads on it are awesome, though. I think it might be something I&#x27;m doing wrong or just the shape of my eyes, but I&#x27;m not sure.</li>
    <li> I will be honest I have long natural eyelashes and I  curl my eyelashes after I apply mascara but this eyelash curler will break your lashes will pinch  your eyelid and will pull the lashes one by one. Horrible product.</li>
    <li> Very disappointed! Gave it away</li>
    <li> Easy to use. Handle is very comfortable.</li>
    <li> This product does what it says it w ill do. My lashes does not break off or pull out after curling my lashes.</li>
    <li> Product is extremely effective, especially when blow dried for a maximum of 5 seconds right before using it. It actually curls it instead of crimping it! Love it!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> this is really the best lash curler</li>
    <li> Love this !! Perfect amount of tension to give a nice curl, not a crimp.  This my second purchase and will not be my last.</li>
    <li> i have very straight eyelashes and this curler works better than any I have ever used.</li>
    <li> I am going to return this. It did pinch me a bit in the base of one eyelid.  And i didn;t think it was any better than a drugstore Tweezerman i bought also just to compare.</li>
    <li> I received these curlers for review and testing purposes.&lt;br /&gt;Ok, I thought all curlers were the same but not the Bella and Bear Curlers. First of all they are very fat, very big and very sturdy. I did not need to clamp down hard at all. They are so easy to use and no hurting or pinching occurred. They extend very far and when you clamp down it is very gentle. I really like their cute floral packaging and the generous offer they give their customers in a cute little coupon for 25% off the next purchase on the products they sell. I&#x27;m very pleased with the Bella and Bear Eyelash Curlers. In the Pic collage below you will see me without curling my lashes then the results with the curlers.</li>
    <li> Nice product- great quality. Works very well.  Very happy!</li>
    <li> I love this lash curler!! I bought one for myself, and loved how easy and quickly it was to curl my lashes with this. So I bought another one to gift it to my mom, who has never been able to find a lash curler that keeps her lashes curled for more than 30 minutes. She ended up loving this product so much, she ordered another one for herself to keep one in her bathroom and another one in her purse. She says this curler leaves her lashes curled all day long.&lt;br /&gt;This curler does not pinch your skin, it is easy to use, it curls lashes quickly, feels sturdy and durable, and it comes in very adorable packaging (which makes it a great gift too).</li>
    <li> It does what it says and it doesn&#x27;t take long. Just one pinch of the curler and it&#x27;s done. It also keeps my eyelashes curled. My Revlon curler needed me to squeeze squeeze and hold and squeeze and hold and my lashes would limp after a couple of hours anyway. This does the trick. I love it so much I ordered another one just I case I misplace it or my daughter swipes it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE for those with bigger eyes:  My eyes are large and almond shape, I put a longer rubber piece in it and it won&#x27;t pinch my skin now. Still one squeeze and that&#x27;s all I need and they stay curled. LOVE IT.</li>
    <li> I bought this curler with my own money :) I have long lashes, and it is usually not a good thing. They never stay up with other eyelash curlers. I am 30 and have been using eyelash curlers for at least 17 years. Every one of them has been disappointing, until the Eye and Mighty. Here&#x27;s how I use it: 1) I curl the lashes 2) I use Revlon Beauty Tubes mascara 3) I wait about 20 minutes, then curl again (usually after I get to work)  This keeps my lashes curled for HOURS. Note: I don&#x27;t experience lash loss when I curl the second time, at least not with this curler. If you have sparse lashes already, do #3 with caution.  Anyway, I love this curler. I&#x27;m going to buy another two of these: one for travel and another for my mom.</li>
    <li> Works the same at Revlon curler for $4.99. Not worth the money. Go to drugstore.</li>
    <li> This eyelash curler is great!</li>
    <li> No big improvement over a standard curler</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the best.  Never pinches.  Works perfectly.  I bought a second one for travel.  And I&#x27;ve bought some for gifts as well.  Love the packaging.</li>
    <li> This eye lash curler is simply amazing! I love the lasting curl it gives my lashes! I&#x27;ve tried so many others that promised to do the job and didn&#x27;t do what I expected! so here&#x27;s to a beautiful lasting relationship with Bella and Bear I am one happy customer!</li>
    <li> Came with a cute travel bag and it&#x27;s the best eyelash curler I&#x27;ve used. Would definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> No joke, the very FIRST day I used this, I had a stranger compliment my lashes!  I use this daily and haven&#x27;t pulled and ripped my lashes like other curlers.  I would recommend.</li>
    <li> The eyelash curler was very nicely packaged using no plastic. I really appreciated that. However, I think the shape of my eyes are too flat because I had a very hard time getting my lashes to fit into the very curved opening. Unfortunately, I had to return it.</li>
    <li> Bought it for my wife.  she says it curls firmly and loves the pretty pouch it came with?</li>
    <li> ...made my lashes bigger:)</li>
    <li> This eyelash curler looks great but didn&#x27;t do a great job with my lashes. It was not comfortable on eye &amp; pulled out eyelashes. It did not keep my lashes curled unless I used it several times &amp; I still was not happy with how lashes looked. I&#x27;ve used very expensive curlers &amp; drug store curlers, but this one is not for me.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this eyelash curler. I&#x27;ve finally found one that actually curls my straight lashes! Very happy with my purchase!!</li>
    <li> I love using this because is just beautiful! It&#x27;s made well. It works great too.</li>
    <li> No no no! horrible! Literally chopped a portion of my lashes...like scissors! Wtf. Good thing I still have some left. And didn&#x27;t even curl the rest. I have used Shu Uemura, sephora, tarte, tweezerman, reckon, and others and I&#x27;m currently using Mac, which is good, just inconvenient to go to the store. I&#x27;ve literally never been more disappointed with anything I&#x27;ve purchased online. Don&#x27;t buy this product. Doesn&#x27;t have extra pads either. Ridiculous.</li>
    <li> Really like this product. Hasn&#x27;t pulled or broken any of my eyelashes.</li>
    <li> awesome  love the curler and the packaging is so fun</li>
    <li> This is the BEST eye lash curler i have EVER owned!! I love it i use before using mascara and it curls well i put one coat of mascara and then use again and you can see the difference. I don&#x27;t know what took me so long to see this product but if it ever breaks i will buy a knew one without the promotional discount that i used for this one.</li>
    <li> The best i ever tried. Now my eyelashes are gorgeous. I&#x27;m really happy with it.</li>
    <li> This is my 2nd purchase (Somehow I lost my eyelash curler). I absolutely love it. It is pain free and gives you the ultimate natural curl. I don&#x27;t even wear mascara sometimes and still get compliments on my natural lashes. No crimps just curls :)  I plan to pick some up for the holidays as gifts for friends and family.</li>
    <li> This curler does curl well, except that the rubber piece falls off every single time I use it and one has already been lost. Having to put the rubber piece on every single time I pick this up kind of defeats the purpose.</li>
    <li> Good product. Works well.</li>
    <li> I love this! Nice compact size, and it works great!!!! Thank you! :D</li>
    <li> I never thought I&#x27;d have a strong opinion about an eyelash curler, but this thing is seriously flawless. The curve is perfect for my eyes, you don&#x27;t have to squeeze it super hard to get a curl, and like another reviewer said, it actually curls instead of &amp;#34;folding&amp;#34; like a lot of other curlers do. Also, it&#x27;s cute. :)</li>
    <li> I was super excited to use this curler since my eyelashes are straight. I couldn&#x27;t get them to curl right, they all went in different directions. I tried a few more times, but the last straw was when the curler cut off a section of my lashes! I couldn&#x27;t believe it! Needless to say I am not using this anymore.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried every kind of eye lash curler there is and this one is by far the best one! It kept my eke lashes curled all day! Love!</li>
    <li> Very well made product. Sturdy, cute, reliable, and works perfectly! The bag is a tight fit, but I just use it for jewelry when traveling, so think of it like a free bonus gift!</li>
    <li> Love it! I was a little hesitant to buy it due to some reviews but I love the way it curls and my curls stay all day</li>
    <li> When Bella &amp; Bear contacted Everything Beauty and Beyond to review their eyelash curler, I was totally in!  I was actually so in, that I even bought one of these lovely gadgets for my sister and mailed it to her so that she could try it out as well!  You see I had the same eyelash curler for years.  However about 6 months ago it broke and so did my beautiful curled eyelashes with it. I went out and bought a Revlon one, however it really didn&#x27;t do anything for me and I found myself having to use it a few times before my eyelashes would even curl.  I looked into other ones, but I refuse to pay more than $20 a curler and some of the good ones were going for $50 and up!!  Yeah no!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When this arrived to my house, it the first thing I noticed was the lovely packaging.  The box was just beautiful and awesome.  It actually reminded me of the 1950&#x27;s look.  Inside I found a curler that seemed very sturdy and durable.  I decided to read the description online about the product and it said:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What Makes The Eye And Mighty The Curler You Need?&lt;br /&gt;✓ No pinch no pain curling&lt;br /&gt;✓ Non slip handle&lt;br /&gt;✓ Ergonomic design, to get every lash&lt;br /&gt;✓ The Eye &amp; Mighty eyelash curler lifts and curls like no other eyelash tool.

So after reading this I was sold!  I decided to go ahead and use this curler the same night I received it AFTER I had finished washing my face and taking my makeup off because I just couldn&#x27;t wait to try it out.  I applied to my freshly clean eyelashes and was just amazed on how little pressure you needed to curler your lashes.  The curler seemed to sit high on the hinge on the device and therefore you didn&#x27;t need to press down so hard in order to get it to work.  I noticed automatically on just how quick it curled my lashes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to use it again a few days later when I had to go to work.  I first curled my lashes, applied mascara primer and then applied my mascara.  My eyelashes looked amazing!  The curl held all day with very little effort and my lashes just looked longer then usual.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I loved about this curler is that it sits high which means it lifts your eyelash curl even higher.  It fits perfectly in my fingers and is very comfortable to use.  I love the design, color and shape of the curler and would highly recommend it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My sister also had a Revlon eyelash curler that she used off and on for the last few years.  However since using this curler that I bought her, she hasn&#x27;t looked back.  From the first day she used it, she told me that her eyelashes were perfectly curled and held all day long even after applying mascara.  The curler looks sturdy and well designed and fit perfectly in her hand as well.  She was really excited about trying out this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the price and usefulness of this eyelash curler I highly recommend it!!</li>
    <li> I like this eyelash curler more than the Shu Eumura that I&#x27;ve used for years. I am blessed with long lashes, but they have lost volume and become straighter as I&#x27;ve aged (I&#x27;m in my late 40&#x27;s).  The way this curler is designed, it&#x27;s easy to get close to the base of the lash without pinching. My lashes tend to stay curled twice as long now.  This comes in cute packaging, too. ~~~~ sample received for review ~~~~</li>
    <li> I was never one to use eyelashe curlers before.&lt;br /&gt;I tried them once from a cheap $ store and swore I would never again use an eyelashes curler. That was before I found Bella and Bear! This is by far the best eyelashes curler I&#x27;ve ever used! It came in an adorable box and was packaged nicely. It has a strong grip and is definitely worth the cost. Now I find myself using this eyelashes curler everyday because I love it so much!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned other eyelash curlers.  This one stands out as more attractive and comfortable to use.  What can I say?  It works, and very quickly at that.  The curler comes with a little plastic clip to keep the handles closed, but it&#x27;s so easy to lose that clip.  I just leave it open.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product was provided for review by KP Marketing.</li>
    <li> Better than others, softly curls them.</li>
    <li> Great product, shipped quickly and with TLC...thank you!</li>
    <li> I have to say i love this eyelash curler. It is so much easier to use. It curls your eyelashes perfectly. I have had a couple of eye lash curlers and none have done the job as well as this one. The maybeline one has pinched my eyelids so many times but this one fits my eyes perfectly; It lasts all day theres minimal pulling, and I actually went out and my friends kept complementing me on my eyelashes. :)</li>
    <li> First impression: Oh, I am jumping with joy at how adorable the box that this curler came in! I would definitely give this out as a gift based on how adorable the darn box is. It is little things like this that impress me. The first impression would make me stop and look if this were in stores. Inside the box was a card explaining to leave feedback or contact them with issues and the beauty eyelash curler with a pretty red handle. (I was even more excited to see the red handle, being that it is my favorite color)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before: My eyelashes are very long and they naturally curl a bit. However, I was looking forward to reviewing this eyelash curler because I did not own one and I had not used one in years. I wanted a little extra curl to make my lashes stand out a bit more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After: My lashes were definitely more bold after using the Bella and Bear lash curler. It was easy to use, I used it after my base mascara had dried. I did not even need to warm it up. It worked just fine. Below you will see a picture of my eyes after using the eyelash curler.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;See my Full Review Here: [...]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I must let you know, I was NOT paid to write this review, but I did receive the eyelash curler at no cost from Bella and Bear to me for giving my true and HONEST opinion.</li>
    <li> Best curler I&#x27;ve ever owned. Curls all lashes from one side to the other without missing any, crimping the end lashes, or pinching my skin! Compared to others this curler feels well made and durable. It&#x27;s handle has an ergonomical shape so it&#x27;s easy to grip. Comes with its own cute little travel sachet...bonus!</li>
    <li> Works well enough, but as most, curl fades in hours. Paired with a heated curler after... much better!</li>
    <li> Great product! Curls eyelashes better than any other curler I have ever used!</li>
    <li> I never use eyelash curlers much because mine are so short. I always pinch myself, which is very unpleasant to say the least. With this curler I had no problem what so ever hitting every last and reaching the base, while missing my eyelid. Great product all around! Would definitely recommend this to my friends as a must have.</li>
    <li> I really love this eyelash curler! It curls every lash and gives you a natural look. I have always had trouble curling every lash but this curler really does grab each lash and curl it perfectly. It doesn&#x27;t pinch or hurt your eyelid which is another important detail for me. During the day when I am nannying I use just the curler but when I go out at night I add some mascara for a little bit more drama! I love it and would definitely recommend it to others.</li>
    <li> This is a cute little eyelash curler.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this eyelash curler. It works great and leaves my lashes looking so full and curled to perfection. I absolutely love how it makes my lashes look-especially when I throw on some falsies and mascara. It is the perfect eyelash curler!</li>
    <li> When I mentioned to one of my friends that I was going to review an eyelash curler, she asked what I feel is an extremely valid question: “Is there really any difference between eyelash curlers?” I told her I think there definitely is and after testing out the 2 Eye &amp; Mighty Eyelash Curler,  my opinion has only been reinforced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you’ve ever used a cheaply made curler you probably know exactly what I mean. They just feel flimsy and easily breakable, and seem destined to pinch your eyelids. So your eyelash curler not only looks like some medieval torture device, it also feels like one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not so with the 2 Eye &amp; Mighty! First of all, the box is adorable. Why don’t more companies take advantage of necessary packaging to make a cute statement?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;More importantly, as soon as you grip the pretty matte metallic red handles in your fingers, you’ll notice the weight of a well-made product. In fact, the hefty pull of the spring-action was a little intimidating before I tried them. The worry was needless, though. They gripped my lashes delicately with no tugging or pinching.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried them with one layer of Rimmel ScandalEyes mascara and a bit of Mary LouManizer for sparkle. My lashes are usually stick-straight with no natural curl.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 2 Eye &amp; Mighty certainly helped give them some lift and curl, as well as making for a smoother mascara application. I didn’t try it with false lashes, but I can tell it would be extra useful for blending your natural lashes with falsies. I will be adding this as a new tool in my beauty routine for days when I want to look and feel more glamorous!</li>
    <li> THE ABSOLUTE BEST!!! I&#x27;ve bought several more, and keep them everywhere! I&#x27;ve given them to several family and friends, and they all love it, too. Very sturdy and holds up for so long. Never pinches, and the curl lasts all day long - which is saying a lot for someone with lashes like mine. I won&#x27;t even consider another lash curler now! Don&#x27;t hesitate to buy - it is awesome!</li>
    <li> I love pretty things, having said that, not only is the Eye &amp; Mighty eyelash curler the best I have used, the red handles and just general look of the curler is &amp;#34;pretty&amp;#34; to me.  I haven&#x27;t pinched my eye lids one time using this curler, and that has been a prob with past curlers.  One can also tell that the pad of this curler is superior to other curlers.</li>
    <li> Wow, read the other reviews. Have an old eyelash curlier and thought how can this be any different? Don&#x27;t know how, but it is. Much smaller, very comfortable to use, doesn&#x27;t pull on my eyelashes&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend</li>
    <li> First let me tell you about my lashes. My lashes stick straight out and the ones on the outer corners curve down :( and I have small eyes so it seems the other eyelash curlers that I have used never got my eyelashes on my outer corners very well. I have used lots of different eyelash curlers  and they have the same problem which is they did not curl my lashes on the outer corner and the ones that did get curled everywhere else only held the curl for a few seconds so I would have to immediately apply my mascara. I got the Bella and Bear curler yesterday at work and I had to use it as soon as I got the package, I opened the pretty box the curler comes in and I took it to the bathroom I did not have any mascara with me but I really wanted to see how good it curled my lashes. After I used it on one eye there was a huge difference, it curled every eyelash even the ones on the outer corners then I did my other eye it came out beautifully also and sense I did not have any mascara with me I could not put any on so I decided to see how long the curl would hold. I checked 30 minutes later and the curl was still there and not only was it still there it was a much better curl then any other curler had given me even right after I would use them. When I got home I decided to see how it looked with mascara and it was the best my eyelashes have ever looked. In fact my 6 year old has very pretty dark curly lashes and when she seen me after I curled and applied mascara with the Bella and Bear she said mom your eyelashes look so pretty like my eyelashes.&lt;br /&gt;When I seen this curler on Amazon I was hesitant to buy it because of the price and I was not sure if it would really work like the description and reviews said but I was so tired of how my eyelashes were before so I decided to give it a try and I am so happy that I did. I will never use any other curler again.</li>
    <li> I bought this one because I have deep set eyes and I cannot get most eyelash curlers to actually reach my lashes.  They are too curved.  I bought this one because it did not look as curvy as most. It works and it works really well.  I gave it four stars rather than five for three reasons--it does not come with a replacement pad, it is overpriced and pinches.  I have had other curlers with that black silicone pad and they do not last forever.  For the price, there should be some way to replace the pad.  It does pinch a bit too- even though it is advertised as no pinching.  The best working eyelash curler I have used was a small cheap pink plastic fold up one--but it did not last very long.</li>
    <li> Believe the hype. An amazing eye lash curler!</li>
    <li> Bella and Bear&#x27;s eyelash curler is unlike any I&#x27;ve ever tried before because it contains a little spring in the handle that allows you to use less pressure on your eyelashes. I suppose this is better for the health of your lashes because they aren&#x27;t as crimped when you use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Honestly, I really wanted to love this curler, but it doesn&#x27;t hold a curl at all. I have pretty long eyelashes to begin with, so curling my eyelashes always makes a noticeable difference. However, with this curler, I felt like I wasn&#x27;t curling them at all! It curled my eyelashes at first, but after adding a coat of mascara, they drooped down to normal. Disappointing. Just to make sure, I curled my lashes again, with the coat of mascara on, and a few minutes later, the same thing happened.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This all happened within 15 or so minutes. I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t leave the house like that! I have tried much better (and cheaper) curlers and this one may appear unique, but I would not use it because it doesn&#x27;t work for making my lashes more dramatic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I LOVED about this product was the handle. It&#x27;s so smooth and fits perfectly in my hand. The design is really well done, I must admit; I just wish the performance was as impressive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FTC Disclosure: I received a complimentary sample of this eyelash curler from Bella &amp; Bear in exchange for an honest and unbiased review. I was neither paid nor sponsored for my opinions—positive or otherwise—and all thoughts reflected in this review are solely my own.</li>
    <li> Best eye lash curler ever! My daughters were even impressed with it!</li>
    <li> I order a ton of stuff on Amazon and never usually have time to write a review, but I feel the need to review this one product and their company.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all, this eyelash curler is truly amazing.  I have used so many cheap ones, and have thrown them out or replaced them as needed.  Some of them pinch my eyelids just a bit, or some curl the longer lashes but don&#x27;t really curl the lashes towards the outer part of the eye.  This baby does the job of curling ALL my lashes.  I am Asian, therefore am not gifted in the eyelash department, but with this curler and a coat of mascara, my eyes pop!  I am so happy with this curler, I have recommended it to all my friends!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second, customer service:  I wrote them on amazon asking if I could buy a replacement rubber pad, because mine had fallen off and I left it somewhere in Spain when I went traveling with my girlfriends last month.  They responded promptly and told me I would be getting a brand new eyelash curler replacement!  The rubber is not supposed to fall out that easily, so I needed a replacement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am so happy with this company, that I cannot wait to try out their other products!  Thank you Bella and Bear!</li>
    <li> Great quality love it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this a few times now, and it&#x27;s a bit tougher to close than my previous eyelash curler, but I like the soft feel of the grips on the handles. It curls my lashes nicely, but requires a bit of dexterity to clamp them down.</li>
    <li> BEST eyelash curler EVER.  I&#x27;m going to buy another one for my daughter right now.  I&#x27;m in my 40&#x27;s and this makes my lashes look amazing!  Sometimes they raise the price.  Don&#x27;t pay over $18.00  Update:  It has been almost a year and sadly the little pad has a cut in it now.  It has lasted way longer though than any curler I have ever had.  I guess I will try contacting the company to get a replacement pad.</li>
    <li> OMG! I love this eyelash curler. A girl has to look cute and curl her eye, right? I love using this.</li>
    <li> I am a makeup junkie, so naturally I have used many eye lash curlers in my time. I am rating this one by Bella and Bear 3 stars, simply because in my use it didn&#x27;t perform better, or worse than my current drug store bought eye lash curler. So let me break down my review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The packaging of this is gorgeous. Very feminine and girly. I fell for it! The curler inside came with 1 pad that was attached to it. The claim for that being unlike most curlers, this one works so well that you don&#x27;t need replacements. Obviously I cannot give my claim to that one as I have only had this curler for a couple of weeks. So far the pad has held up wonderfully as you would hope it would.  The pad is black in color, and the handles of the curler are a dark pink. Feels durable, and not flimsy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using this is pretty basic. If you know how to curl your lashes, then you know what to do. I tested this curler against my current drug store curler. On my left eye I did this one by Bella and Bear, on the right, my old curler. I didn&#x27;t experience any pinching, or discomfort while using this one. My end results after putting on 1 coat of mascara were pretty much identical. I honestly couldn&#x27;t tell much of a difference. The curl also stayed for the same amount of time as my drug store curler.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The final thing that made me give this 3 stars is the price. My drug store curler cost me about $10. If the price was a bit more competitive with other curlers that provide the same results, then I would definitely up this rating to 4 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Please note that I was sent this product complimentary to try out in my home in order to share my honest experience, thoughts and review.</li>
    <li> It really curl you&#x27;re eyelashes.  It is worth your money. I really love love it.</li>
    <li> This curles pumps your lashes from a 3 to a 10 in ten seconds! Love how ergonomic the handles are.</li>
    <li> this really truly is the best eye lash curler I have ever used. the handles are so smooth and I love the texture of them. it didn&#x27;t pull on my eye lashes, and break them as ive had with a lot of curlers, the packaging is the cutest thing and I love the name. I really want to check into seeing what else they have to offer because being in the beauty industry keeping up with great companies is a must. I repeat, BEST EYE LASH CURLER EVER!!!!</li>
    <li> Good product. IT would be better if the curler has a less deep curl which is more suitable to eye that are big and poping up a little bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;IT is definitely usable, I can fix that myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Material is good too. Each of us has different type of eyes so overall it is good product to try.</li>
    <li> The first thing I noticed about the Bella and Bear Eyelash Curler is the box. It’s absolutely adorable! It’s got that retro fun feeling to it! The eyelash curler itself is really great. No pinching and it really gets every last lash. You really don’t have to press down very hard to get the look you want.&lt;br /&gt;I used the curler and applied two coats of mascara for some seriously sexxayyy lashes on a recent date night with the hubs. He kept comment on how pretty my eyes looked!</li>
    <li> Love, love, love this eyelash curler. I love the cushion that helps round my lashes as opposed to crease, the spring that allows the hinge to bounce back softly with out sticking or pulling my lashes. The cure fits around my eye and allows me to get close to my lashes for the best curl ever! LOVE it.</li>
    <li> I have been searching for the perfect eyelash Curler for years now, and I have to say this product does wonders on my stick straight eyelashes. Its no doubt in my mind the best eyelash Curler ever invented.</li>
    <li> I am a lash aficionado.  I don&#x27;t leave the house without curling my lashes and putting on mascara..  I didn&#x27;t have high hopes that this curler would be any better than  all of the fancy expensive brands of curlers I&#x27;ve owned, which  always left me with  2 problems.  One- they never got all of my lashes in one attempt (especially the outer corners) and two- they always crimped my lashes instead of curled, leaving me with wonky lashes going every which way.  This curler  is  AMAZING.  It gives the most beautiful curl (not crimp!)  perfectly even across every single lash that stays all day and it gets every lash from the inner corner to the outer lashes in one attempt.  It is exceptionally well made and the spring-load makes it much sturdier than the other high end brands I&#x27;ve tried.  I&#x27;ve only had it a few weeks so i don&#x27;t know how long it will hold up without a replacement pad, but i will happily pay to replace this if I ever lose it.  If you think all lash curlers are the same, try this one and you will definitely see that they are not.  This is a superior product.</li>
    <li> did not curl my lashes at all...very disappointed in the product</li>
    <li> I was really excited to get the eyelash curlers. it comes in the most adorable box and makes you want to just give it to someone *reminder, buy for birthday gifts for friends* The curler itself is very nice. It has a hard rubber handle that is easy to grip and because it is spring loaded it takes a bit to squeeze. I think it&#x27;s more effective because you don&#x27;t ever have to replace the rubber pad. It&#x27;s also rounded so your eyelashes look curly rather than look crimped. After trying it out, it actually curled my lashes and it was really quick and easy to use. Just hold it down for a few seconds and then apply some mascara. I have very little eyelashes after finishing chemo so I was afraid that I would lose them easily but it wasn&#x27;t hard at all and didn&#x27;t pull them out. Squeezed it for a few seconds and then put on my mascara and it was that easy. It says you can use 2 coats but I like the way it looked with just one.</li>
    <li> I have very short, sparse, &amp;#34;barely there&amp;#34; eyelashes. Without mascara and a complex routine on my lashes alone, they&#x27;re barely noticeable. It really is a shame that I have to spend so much time on my eyelashes when my husband wakes up with eyelashes looking like they&#x27;re straight out of a mascara commercial.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I&#x27;ve been using a very cheap, plastic eyelash curler for the past few weeks, and let&#x27;s just say, it doesn&#x27;t get the job done. It makes my eyelashes stick together at the base, which prevents them from spreading out to create that full look that I desire to achieve. I decided to say goodbye to the cheap-o eyelash curler and try something different.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My first impression of the Bella and Bear Eyelash Curler is that it was made of high-quality materials. It was much heavier (but not too heavy) than my plastic curler, and seemed to have a lot more thought put into the design. The grips were comfortable and slip-resistant, which really helped me feel at ease (as much &amp;#34;at ease&amp;#34; as possible when you put some weird metal contraption next to your eye). Fortunately, and to my surprise, I didn&#x27;t end up pinching myself as I *always* seem to do with my plastic one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The results were pretty astounding. Not only did it curl my lashes at the base and make them stand up nice and pretty, it also helped spread them out. It not only curled my center lashes, but also those tiny ones at the inner corner of my eye. I didn&#x27;t even know those lashes were there, to be honest with you. After applying mascara, I was perfectly satisfied. I didn&#x27;t have to go through my complex routine of separating, brushing, etc. All I needed to do was curl and apply a couple coats of mascara.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What a breeze!</li>
    <li> This curler gives my lashes a really nice shape to them. It doesn&#x27;t cause them to break or to get an unnatural crease in them. It doesn&#x27;t pull them so hard that it pulls them out either. There&#x27;s a very nice pad on it that is supposed to last the lifetime of the curler. So no need to change them out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tool is easy to grip and I find it easy to get all my lashes into it. It&#x27;s a much nicer design than some of the old curlers I tried years ago. This one is easy enough to use that I&#x27;m able to curl the lashes on both eyes evenly, and am even able to use the tool in both my right and left hand with the same results. It works really well!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sample provided for review</li>
    <li> I bought this because everyone gave the curler a great review and I was right for listening to the masses; this is truly the best eye lash curler on the market.  Thank you!</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem to be any better than a a standard eyelash curler. I was seeking a replacement for my beloved Smashbox curler (since apparently Smashbox doesn&#x27;t make them anymore!), and hoped this would wow me, but I didn&#x27;t notice any real major curl going on. Pretty much the same so-so results I get from a Revlon curler. Bella and Bear really do stand behind their product, though - as soon as I contacted them to let them know, they issued a full refund. Impressive. So would definitely give this product a try - there are a lot of other positive reviews for this curler. Maybe my eyelashes are just stubbornly loyal to Smashbox! I&#x27;d definitely be willing to try Bella &amp; Bear products again, based on my overall experience.</li>
    <li> I have used several lash curlers, and have experienced some lash breakage from them. I&#x27;ve been using this one for a week and this has not been an issue! Works great!</li>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect.  Shipped quickly and saw the cute little box and first thought was this was going to be way too small.  Pulled it out and was pleasantly surprised.  It is smaller than your average drugstore brand.  What I liked is it opens up wide and the curler put is big enough to get all my eyelashes in the curler.  First time I used it I was a little disappointed.  The reason is this curls the lashes and does not crimp them like the drugstore brands do.  I thought I wasn&#x27;t squeezing it hard enough.  Even when I did I did not get the crimp!  So these really do curl your lashes and have to move away from the crimping look which is great.  I have long lashes and a couple of coats of Dior mascara and I got the compliments.  People asked if I was wearing falsies!&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this curler...just know that it curls the lashes and does not crimp them, get used to that new look and you will love this product also!</li>
    <li> Read my full review here http://www.fashionbeyondforty.com/2014/09/bella-bear-beauty-products-review.html&lt;br /&gt;I am going to be straight up with you all. When I found out I was receiving these products to review I was sort of nervous. For one thing I have not used an eyelash curler since I was a teen. Second of all, I was really not sure at all about the hair remover. It looked like something that would be used in torture. Now that I have used them, (after my daughter took the initial test run and she turned out okay) I love them!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all they are pretty tools in pretty boxes! They are so girly and pretty and pink, and red, and I love that! I thought that being pink that my husband would leave them be as he is always using my tools, but nope, he got a splinter woodworking tonight and came out after getting it out of his skin and asked where the pink tweezers came from. I gave him the run down about it and he said they were a lot better than our other tweezers, which for the record were pretty good too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I will say, the hair remover can be a bit painful but no more painful than trying to tweeze those delicate areas. It does the job a lot faster too. I have fair skin and light facial hair so unless in the sun you can barely see it but in the sun I look a bit furry, even at my lip line. I have used the hair remover on my upper lip and corners of my mouth and while it didn&#x27;t feel great, it was not too bad and now I have a smooth lip! I also did my hairline and face. It works after you get the hang of it which didn&#x27;t take long to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was surprised with the lash curler. I remember the curlers from my youth, always sticking on my lashes, pulling them out, but I also do not remember them having the nice slick black stuff on them. I guess we have come a long way in non stick surfaces! I also learned my lashes are naturally longer on my right eye than my left. Interesting, never noticed that before. I can now have lovely curly lashes before applying mascara!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lastly, the tweezers ... nothing can compare to a great tweezer! I hate when the ends do not come together completely, useless. These tweezers are perfect and really get the job done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like having my &amp;#34;girly&amp;#34; tools now, they are pretty to use, and I know it seems shallow, but when I have to pluck, tweeze, and remove hair from my face, I prefer to do it with something pretty rather than utilitarian!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And yes for the record I did get this free but I would never review something I do not personally enjoy using.before applying mascara!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lastly, the tweezers ... nothing can compare to a great tweezer!

    <li> Pretty good curler, but overpriced.</li>
    <li> Ok, so we all know what an eyelash curler is...  So, I&#x27;m not going to sit here and give a description..  What I will say about this particular pair of curler&#x27;s is that they are some of the nicest ones I&#x27;ve seen.  Most that I&#x27;ve had have had metal handles and it can be quite uncomfortable when your using them to be holding metal, however the rubber handles are well constructed with seemingly quality materials.  The rubber handles makes it loads more comfy to hold in your hands...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ok, so overall, these is a nice eyelash curler.  I&#x27;m a weird girl and haven&#x27;t really ever used eyelash curler&#x27;s much, but from the previous ones I&#x27;ve had these definitely are far better than anything I&#x27;ve owned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**  Please note:  This product was given to me for testing/ review purposes.  However, the thoughts and opinions expressed are 100% MY OWN.</li>
    <li> It cut my eyelashes TWICE! went straight to the trash, didn&#x27;t work for me.</li>
    <li> It seems silly but I love this curler so much more than the other ones I&#x27;ve gotten in the past. The fact that it is spring loaded makes it so good. Definitely the best I&#x27;ve seen.</li>
    <li> I like this eyelash color, it works greats. Too well in fact, I have to push down really gently. The quality is good, it doesn&#x27;t feel like it is going to break any time soon. The only downside, is that it didn&#x27;t come with an extra cushion. Hopefully, I can find some that would fit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I highly recommend this product, as it does curl the lashes really nice.</li>
    <li> As someone with very straight eyelashes, I&#x27;ve searched my whole life to find an eyelash curler that works consistently well. I&#x27;m happy to report that I think my search is over! :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This curler gets all of my eyelashes and results in a lovely curl without the weird kinks. I&#x27;ve always had better luck with spring-loaded eyelash curlers like this, but experienced problems with the pads wearing down or falling out over time. With this one, the pad is solid and seems to stay in place very well. Here&#x27;s hoping it stands the test of time!</li>
    <li> I wanted to believe all the hype, but alas, this was no good for me.  It didn&#x27;t curl my lashes any better than the drugstore model.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have very straight and somewhat sparse lashes -- they do take mascara very well though (too faced better than sex is a great buildable mascara, btw)...if only I could get the lashes to curl up they&#x27;d be pretty good all things considered.  This curler got my hopes up but not the lashes -- in a side by side comparison my old curler (I think it&#x27;s a Revlon from CVS) did as good if not a little better.  Oh well :(</li>
    <li> eh curls like a $2 curler....only difference is that the spring leaves curler open and they seem harder to press. btw i did get pinched and i have long eyelashes. save your money. given too much credit and over priced for what it does tbh</li>
    <li> I really didn&#x27;t think i would love this as much as I do. If you&#x27;ve ever suffered pinching with other curlers, you&#x27;re in for a treat. I love the way it curls as well. It looks natural and doesn&#x27;t have that bent quality that a regular curler will give you. It was worth every penny I spent on it.</li>
    <li> Comfortable grip, and works better than most.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t let the silly photo put you off -- this is not for curly-haired  teens..</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this curler! It is very comfortable to use and eliminates painful pinches. It is very ergonomic and easy to use/hold. I love that it can do all my eyelashes at once. In the past I have used other eyelash curlers but always quit because I didn&#x27;t notice that my eyes looked any different at all. After using the Bella and Bear curler I saw a noticeable difference and my eyes looked so much better (and without any pinching!). It can be used on any shape/size eyes, so it is a product I would recommend to anyone and everyone. I also love that if you use it properly, you will NEVER need to replace the pads! I&#x27;ll never buy another curler again. Love it!</li>
    <li> Super nice packaging, and works very well.  Thank you!</li>
    <li> My review consists of the good, the bad and the ugly. First,&lt;br /&gt;the good - I finally found a curler that &#x27;fits&#x27; my eyelid. Huh, you say? Well, it appears that most of the manufacturers believe I have golf balls instead of human eyes. The tool&#x27;s shape is long and shallow enough of a curve to catch most of the eyelashes. It is comfortable to use, but takes a bit of practice. Once you are comfortable with the scissor motion (sorry, no other way to describe it) used to make the curl, you are rewarded with a nice, non-crimpy curl. The pad in this one is the best I have used. This tool also opens wide enough that even the most nearsighted or lush lashed amoungst us can get it close to the base of the upper lashes. The design over all is very well thought out. I recommend using an magnifying mirror if you have to use bifocals (I do). All that said, now...&lt;br /&gt;the bad - there is no replacement pad and I am questioning how sanitary this is going to be in the long run. I agree completely with folks here who advise to REMOVE ALL EYE MAKEUP before use. Ain&#x27;t nothing pretty about an eye infection. I am wondering out loud how to properly clean this curler to be certain it remains safe. If you are prone to sties and other types of infection, I would be asking the same questions. Which leads to...&lt;br /&gt;the ugly - until you practice and are used to it (won&#x27;t take long) the results are a bit odd looking. The black pad is plushier and looks to be made of silicone and not the usual hard rubber. I have found that the hard rubber pads are chiefly responsible for that weird ugly crimp you can get. Not so with this one. I mentioned before the squeezy scissor action your thumb and index finger have to use can be tricky. If you have coordination issues, well - things could get ugly.&lt;br /&gt;SUGGESTIONS for use...wash your hands before use. I keep the little plastic clip to keep the tool closed. You could follow the advise of one person here to heat the tool with a dryer, but I think I may skip that. Use a makeup mirror to assist you. Practice when you have some time. Enjoy, Ladies - get out there and be lovely.ip that. Use a makeup mirror to assist you. Practice when you have some time. Enjoy, Ladies - get out there and be lovely.</li>
    <li> Pulls eyelashes out if you have any mascara on when curling</li>
    <li> Sturdy, clean lines and works just fine.  I&#x27;d definitely recommend this item and brand.</li>
    <li> I was drawn to this eyelash curler because of all of the perfect reviews (at the time about 10 five star reviews). In hindsight, I should have been wary as they were SO enthusiastic about the product---too good to be true, right? The curler itself seems sturdy and yes it came in a &amp;#34;cute&amp;#34; box but the function is lacking. They curl my lashes after a very hard press and even after &amp;#34;pumping&amp;#34; the curler a few times, once I apply mascara, my lashes are straight again. And this is with Benefit&#x27;s They&#x27;re Real! mascara, which can give my lashes a slight curl even without using a curler first. I even tried curling them post-mascara, but to no avail. Disappointed with this curler, especially at its price point-- will go back to my old trusty Shu Uemura again, and toss this one into the bin.</li>
    <li> I got this eyelash curler and the first time I tried it, the corner of my eye kept getting poked. Turns out the welded section of the curler was not welded in a way so there wasn&#x27;t a point/sharp edge at the weld area. I can&#x27;t use the thing for fear that the corner of my inner eye will get scratched. Tried a few more times and moved it left to right gently, no luck. I couldn&#x27;t return it because I threw it in my makeup drawer after getting frustrated about it and when I finally remembered to refund it, the refund period is over. I am hoping I just had a defected one, but if this is the quality of the product...be careful putting it near your eyes.</li>
    <li> I was given the chance to review this product as a blogger. I have not owned an eyelash curler since high school.  Having owned a really bad one that actually pinched off my eyelashes (yikes), I decided that I would never, ever use one again. However, I decided that it may be worth a try once again and opted to give the Eye and Mighty a try.  The eyelash curler is a fun and girly color and comes in an attractive box making it perfect for personal use or gift giving.  I was pretty happy with the eyelash curler. Unlike my last disaster-of-a-curler, there was no pinching or noticeable damage done to my lashes. I found that I needed to hold it for almost 20 seconds before a real impact was made but I did not mind. Once mascara was applied, the curling was amplified and it made my eyes look great.</li>
    <li> Awesome so far! I&#x27;ve had no issues with pulling or punching, and my eyelashes turn out beatiful!</li>
    <li> I am so glad I got this eye lash curler. I needed a new one and as I was scrolling through amazon I spotted this one and it looked good so I got it. It arrived fast and it is so great. My lashes look longer than before and it really adds something! This product is my new favorite make up item. It does take a little bit to grip your lashes but when it does it makes you look like a celebrity! Love love love it</li>
    <li> This product is well built, nice to look at, and will last. However, it does not work for me. The top horizontal piece of the curler is too wide for it to fit comfortably under my brow bone. Still looking for a great curler.</li>
    <li> I have never truly INVESTED in eyelash curlers before. I had only ever used $1-3 curlers,... thinking &amp;#34;eyelash curlers are eyelash curlers - why spend more?&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, now I get it. I have noticed such a difference in my lashes!!! They seem so much more prominent, even without mascara. These curlers were gentle and easy on my lashes. By far, these are the best curlers I&#x27;ve ever used. I&#x27;m tossing my cheaper curlers into the depths of the drawers and I&#x27;ll be using these from now on. I received these promotionally for review, but my opinions remain my own.</li>
    <li> It really curls the lashes with a smooth curve, as opposed to a sharp angle produced by other curlers. No pain and no pinching!</li>
    <li> I have the shortest, and straightest eyelashes ever!! I also pinch myself when using eyelash curlers. And they ever stay curled. I just started using this eyelash curler and I&#x27;m loving it. The shipping was super fast. I ordered it on Thursday afternoon and by Friday morning it was at my door. So impressed. I will never use anything else.</li>
    <li> Um I do not understand all these positive reviews. This eye lash curler was worse than my already decent revlon eyelash curler. It was tight and hard to squeeze felt like if my finger slipped it would rip all of my eyelashes off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> Yes, it is worth the price.  By far the best/nicest/does what it should eyelash curler.  You&#x27;ll never buy a drug store version again. LOVE!</li>
    <li> Pretty good, am happy.</li>
    <li> Curler works great! I have small eyes and it&#x27;s been hard for me to find a curler that doesn&#x27;t pinch. It also holds a nice curl! Love this product! &amp; very satisfied</li>
    <li> I heard my girlfriend talk about not being able to find these things with springs, then I ordered this. She was pissed because it tore off her eyelashes, and one of her friends that she let borrow. Personally I think she was exaggerating because I didn&#x27;t really see a difference. I&#x27;m out.</li>
    <li> awesome. Love love love this item. My daughter is now using it as well, her, already super long and beautiful lashes look even more awesome</li>
    <li> I would love to have loved this eyelash curler so charmingly raved about and packaged, but I can&#x27;t. As a matter of fact, after curling my eyelashes with over-the-counter eyelash curlers for over 40 years, this is the first curler that actually ripped my eyelashes out!!! I didn&#x27;t put mascara on before curling. I didn&#x27;t pull on them. I wasn&#x27;t pushed. I didn&#x27;t feel any pain. The lashes are and were my own - not false or artificial. I used the curlers exclusively once I had bought them. They performed about as well as the previous curlers that I had probably bought at Walgreen&#x27;s or maybe even the 99 Cent Store. So I wasn&#x27;t thrilled, but I&#x27;d grin and bear it if they hadn&#x27;t done any damage, but they did. I noticed that a chunk of lashes were missing in the center of both swathes of lash on both eyelids. What? Yes.  Cut to the quick as though chopped by a scissors to about 1/4\\&quot; when my eyelashes are probably 3/4\\&quot; to an inch long. They&#x27;re just beginning to grow out. I&#x27;m being patient. Am told by a professional make-up artist that it will take a while. With 365 days a year of curling my lashes almost every day - sometimes more than once a day - I&#x27;m nearing somewhere in the vicinity of 10,000 curlings. Do the math. I did. I hope I didn&#x27;t throw them out since I just noticed the money back guarantee. Good luck and be careful.</li>
    <li> I REALLY wanted to love this curler, especially after I read a review that seemed just like my situation. I use Latisse so I have pretty long lashes and I love the natural look if I am able to get a good curl but I do use mascara also.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This curler does get a great curl and I like that you don&#x27;t have to squeeze too hard or apply too much pressure (actually I found if you do, I get too much curl, but it&#x27;s nice that there could be some variation). In any case, I try not to squeeze too hard so I can keep my lashes in tact.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So all that said, I guess my  beef with the curler is that it just doesn&#x27;t fit the curve of my eye. It feels very awkward when I go in for the initial approach and then when I go to &amp;#34;squeeze&amp;#34; it misses half of/ my outter lashes. When I try a different angle I miss or don&#x27;t get enough or am unable to get close enough to the lid so the curl is not good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll try it a couple more times but alas, I think my quest for the perfect or best eyelash curler continues</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so happy I found this eyelash curler, I was going to just buy the regular kind that I&#x27;ve always bought but the name and box caught my eye and I&#x27;m so happy that it did because it&#x27;s the best curler I&#x27;ve ever used! It&#x27;s bottom part is a bit flexible, it has a give to it so if you have stubby pin straight lashes (like me) it works great! I&#x27;m very happy with the Bella and Bear eyelash curler and I&#x27;d buy it again, not only for me but it would also make a great stocking stuffer for my daughter.</li>
    <li> I bought this curler based on reviews, however, I can&#x27;t say that I am satisfied with it. I find the curve of the curler too...straight? Not sure how to describe it, but whereas for one of the reviewers, it grabs corner hairs, on me, it misses them. I feel like I can&#x27;t get close enough to my lid to have the curl be in the appropriate spot. I switched the curler with my daughter&#x27;s to see what she would say and she doesn&#x27;t like it either. She ended up bending the metal to make it curvier, so it is better, but not great. I do not recommend that you try bending the metal...i think she was just lucky.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this curler for the last few weeks &amp; as much as I wanted to love it, I don&#x27;t.  The curler itself is very well made, it is durable, the spring works great, &amp; the finger grips make it easy to grip without fear of it slipping.  The only design flaw that I&#x27;ve found is that the rubber pad that curls my lashes already has a slit in it from where the metal &amp; rubber meet.  The other issue which is why it doesn&#x27;t work for me is the curve of the actual curler.  It is very wide which, but the curve of the curler is too strait for my eyes.  I have almond shaped eyes &amp; I guess a slightly smaller eye socket.  In order to get all of my lashes in the curler I have to press the curler into my eyelid &amp; then adjust the angle to get them in a few times to get the curler close enough to the base of my lashes.  If I only had to press the curler lightly on my eyelid that would be one thing, but I have to really press &amp; almost flatten out my eyelid for it to work.  Even after that I get maybe a creased &amp;#34;curl&amp;#34;.  My lashes are quite long &amp; bone strait &amp; even pumping the curler a few times up my lashes doesn&#x27;t give much of a curl.  By the time I put on mascara they are almost strait again.  I&#x27;ve been using curlers for 20 some odd years now &amp; honestly the drug store ones work better for me personally.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have short lashes &amp; more oval eyes this may be a great curler for you &amp; I do recommend it for the quality.  Good luck!</li>
    <li> Great curler! Even better seller. After usps lost my package Bella and Bear sent me another one for free. Awesome customer service!</li>
    <li> This doesn&#x27;t seem to curl very well.</li>
    <li> Its a sturdy eyelash curler, but honestly it doesn&#x27;t curl very well. I find myself having to squeeze the curler extremely hard to get a little lift. Once I add mascara the curl falls.</li>
    <li> LOVE IT! High quality product with quick shipping. I will never order from anyone else again! You have a custoimer for life</li>
    <li> I had the opportunity to test out an eyelash curler. I normally do not use one because they always hurt me eyes. The reason they hurt my eyes is because they are always too large for my eyes or they are too cheap and pull out my eyelashes. I love all beauty products so I was super happy to try this out.&lt;br /&gt;The packaging is super cute and girly. The packaging should draw you right to the product on the shelf. I would purchase it because of the packaging.&lt;br /&gt;The box was a little heavy for an eyelash curler. In my opinion anyway, but then again Ive never bought a nice one, just the cheapest. I had to open it and see why the box was so heavy. In hand this is definitely a well made eyelash curler. I do not feel as if I would break it when squeezing together. This is definitely a quality eyelash curler and I love the weight of it in my hand.</li>
    <li> Really great priced curler. The eye opening is huge and allows all your lashes to be curled beautifully. Will even fit fake lashes too to blend with the natural lashes nicely. Curls, doesn&#x27;t crimp. Haven&#x27;t pinched my eyelids yet :) I&#x27;m liking this more than my shu curler which I&#x27;ve had forever. If your in the market for a great eyelash curler, I&#x27;d give this one a try. Your lashes will thank you ;)</li>
    <li> It isn&#x27;t as great as the reviews say it is. It curls my eyelashes, but maybe only slightly more than any other eyelash curler. I think they might have had people inflate their reviews.</li>
    <li> My wife was really happy with this eyelash curler</li>
    <li> Just purchased this curler.  Very happy w/ it.  It is sturdy and curls my eyelashes better than any previous curler I have owned.  It comes in a super cute floral bag which is nice for traveling.  I would definitely recommend this eyelash curler without hesitancy.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s pretty good, I&#x27;m not really sure if it&#x27;s the best product I&#x27;ve ever used though, I needed a new eyelash curler and this gets the job done but you would be fine using a cheeper one.  UPDATE It looks like Bella and Bear have backed down on the claim that they had made in the past that the pad *never needs replacing&amp;#34; which makes me wonder if a. The quality of the product has gone down. Or b. they have decided to be honest with their buyers. Also they now include a travel bag for your lash curler which is a nice touch (too bad they did not have that when I bought mine last month) all that being said I still enjoy using my curler but you still could just as easy get the same results with a cheeper one.</li>
    <li> Easy to use and curls lashes well.  I don&#x27;t frequently use eyelash curlers but I&#x27;m now a fan of this one.  It curls well and is ergonomic.  It&#x27;s great to use even if you aren&#x27;t wearing makeup just to make your eyes pop.  I have used various curlers but this is the classic design done perfectly.</li>
    <li> I waited a few days before writing this review.  At first, I wasn&#x27;t crazy about this eyelash curler.  It does take a little getting used to as it operates differently from conventional curlers.  About the second or third day with it, I&#x27;m realizing it&#x27;s a great eyelash curler!  It curls as well (if not slightly better than) my Shu uemura.  Best of all, it&#x27;s reasonably priced!  The red color is really cute as is the box it comes in. I&#x27;m not typically a sucker for cute packaging, but I&#x27;m finding it hard to recycle the box. Great eyelash curler!!</li>
    <li> I like this eyelash curler because it doesn&#x27;t pull on my lashes and it&#x27;s easy to use.</li>
    <li> This is a great product!  Never pinches and curls beautifully.</li>
    <li> This eyelash curler is living up to the other outstanding reviews I read prior to purchasing it. I have used countless brands of eyelash curlers over the years from high end names to drugstore purchases and I have to say that this is the most comfortable one I have ever used. If you are looking for a quality eyelash curler this is the one to buy!</li>
    <li> I thought that all eyelash curlers were the same... Until I got one of these! Holy cow it does way better than others that I have tried and I have better looking eyelashes since using it. No pinching or anything. Love love love love love it!</li>
    <li> I like this eyelash curler.  The shape is great for getting close to the lash line and curling.  Doesn&#x27;t pinch or put put odd creases in lashes.  Would purchase again.</li>
    <li> This Eyelash Curler works perfectly. It really curls my eyelashes, you are going to need only one or two coats of mascara, and it looks like you have false eyelashes. If you feel that your mascara does not work with this curler your makeup is going to change 180 degrees. Your eyes will look bigger and are also going to look more open. My lashes looked so long and pretty. The size is perfect for travel. The color red is so bright and cute.&lt;br /&gt;@MakeupByOne</li>
    <li> I love writing beauty product reviews. It’s always a good excuse to pamper myself, get dolled up and try the latest items out there and let you know what I think.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, I love the packaging. Most people who saw it had the same reaction ‘Oooh, what did you get me?’. It looks gift wrapped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I saw a girl in the gym today using an Eyelash Curler and she was actually applying the blow dryer to it. I asked her what she was doing and she said that the curler doesn’t work too well and the heat helps. I wanted to give her my Bella curler which I had in my bag, I felt so bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Eyelash Curler is great. You won’t need to apply heat to use it. It’s a nice size that fits perfectly in your hand. The handles are a solid plastic so this baby is not breaking anytime soon. The Curler also comes with a nice Thank you card that includes a 25% off gift code for your next purchase which is great because at only $14.95 you can purchase one and then use the discount to purchase one for your friend.</li>
    <li> I liked this. It&#x27;s also w</li>
    <li> Very dissapointed.  I purchased this curler two months ago and it does not hold up to the claims at all.  It pinched out about 6 lashes this morning and stuck in the pad, pad is being cut by curler and is not a lifetime product. I have been using it properly, been curling my lashes for 30 years.  This product is no better than a drug store $4.00 one.  Had high hopes given the reviews.  Will be returning without a doubt.</li>
    <li> I love this eyelash curler! The colored handles make it really fun. Overall they are very well made and sturdy! I know that I will have them for years to come. They are also gentle and do not pull or lock up. It is obvious they were well thought out and high quality. I would strongly suggest them! I am so glad that they sent me these eyelash curlers to review! To read my whole review go here: http://www.my-captivating-life.com/2014/11/bella-bear-beauty-products-all-things.html</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m surprised at the good reviews. Maybe it&#x27;s just me but the curler has little extended tips that actually hurt the skin when you try to get close to your lashes and it pinches.  I wanted this to work because I read you can heat this one with a blow dryer for longer lasting curls because its made of metal.  But alas, I&#x27;m re-ordering the plastic Japonesque go curl. Even though they don&#x27;t last long - I&#x27;ve gone through several - they allow you to get super close to your lash line without pinching and provide a nice curl.  FOLLOW UP:  The company is really strange in their customer service response.  The day after I posted my review they publicly posted a great reply on Amazon saying they would be happy to return my money.  They then sent me a private email stating:    Rather than just leave such negative feedback simply contacting us and asking that we stop sending emails or even more simply just unsubscribing from Amazons email system would have solved this problem.    We are sorry that you feel that 3 simple emails warranted such negative feedback as you left but we do hope that you found our product satisfactory.    Have a nice New Year     Bella &amp; Bear  .....................No I didnt find their product satisfactory as I said in my review.  Very odd - think twice before purchasing from them.  I wish I hadn&#x27;t  What a pain over an eyelash curler</li>
    <li> This eyelash curler definitely makes your lashes evenly curled to receive mascara.  I rad all the reviews before ordering and it&#x27;s true --  this curler is an entity of it&#x27;s own.  I&#x27;ve tried many different curlers from Shiseido to Japonesque and the Bella &amp; Bear works the best.</li>
    <li> I bought it after the great reviews, but this doesn&#x27;t curl my eyelashes as well as if I were to get a eyelash curler for $3 at a makeup or clothing store. I was really expecting a good eyelash curler but this just didn&#x27;t do my long eyelashes any justice. Its strong and doesn&#x27;t pinch my eyelashes as much, but after three crimps, and mascara, it just doesnt seem to hold the curl as long as I would like.</li>
    <li> This item arrived quickly, packaged well and in great and new condition.  I absolutely LOVE this eyelash curler!  Lashes stay curled all day, something I have never experienced.  I&#x27;m ordering another as a backup.  Highly recommend this from Bella and Bear.</li>
    <li> Love this curler, maybe it&#x27;s the shape or the angle but it&#x27;s definitely the best lash curler I have ever used....</li>
    <li> I have tried many eyelash curlers and while most are sufficient and get the job done I can honestly say this is my favorite eyelash curler along with the whiplash curler (by crave naturals also available on amazon).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read once on in a beauty magazine that eyelash curlers tend to wear out after about a year and a half. No way!! A good eyelash curler with proper care (not getting dropped or crushed in a makeup bag) should last a lifetime, the pads are another story...but not with this one!.&lt;br /&gt;I have tried the famous Shu Uemura and while that did a very nice job of getting a natural curl I could tell statement about wearing out after a year and a half as the metal connection did not seem very strong. This curler however is rock solid in it&#x27;s build! The metal is thick and reinforced as is the connection. Another thing I preferred over the Shu Uemura is that this is strongly spring loaded where as Shu Uemura isn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The finger holds are very comfortable and smooth plus, also importantly, the curler looks classy! The pad on this curler, as said by the company doesn&#x27;t need to be replaced. This is impressive as you can tell by looking at it and feeling it the pad is thick and does not have a lot of give to it but is still gentle enough not to harm your lashes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for curling. I get the curler as close to the roots as possible by about half opening my eye and the no pinch design allows you to do this easily. Then I hold for about 7 seconds occasionally pumping the curler. I then raise my eyebrows and move the curler a little farther down my lashes and pinch for a second for two while bend the curler backwards and raising the handle up a bit. The main issue with certain eyelash curlers is the over curled and bent lashes effect which also isn&#x27;t good for your lashes. This curler, when not over pressed, gives a natural curler that is noticeable on it&#x27;s own without even using mascara.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And a shout out to the wonderful company Bella and Bear with their wonderful customer service and wonderful products that they wholeheartedly back up! Can&#x27;t go wrong here.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t write too many product reviews, but WOW, this curler is amazing! I have very long straight lashes that have never held curl on their own, let alone with the weight mascara adds.&lt;br /&gt;This curler makes my lashes look INCREDIBLE, even with the weight of fiber mascara!&lt;br /&gt;And as an added bonus...if you can keep from washing over your lashes when you take your makeup off, not only do they hold curl through the night but if you use the curler again in the morning and reapply mascara, it doubles the effect and lasts all day!&lt;br /&gt;This curler is absolutely incredible!</li>
    <li> I used to have a revlon curler and barely used it. Over the years, the silicon pad eventually became too worn out and I decide to get a new curler and ordered new pads for my revlon curler and have it as a back up. It was hard at first, deciding on which one to order. There are over 6 eyelash curlers on Amazon, all with over 4 star ratings, having hundreds of reviews and all within the same price range too. How did I decide on this one? I don&#x27;t remember honestly. But I can tell you that every time I put on mascara, I always use this curler. It seriously makes a huge difference. No wonder why I never used my revlon one. It is absolute crap compared to this curler. I have straight sparse Asian eyelashes and this curler effortlessly curls all of my lashes and keeps them curled. I can&#x27;t currently comment on the longevity of this curler since I&#x27;ve only had it for a few months so maybe in a few years, I&#x27;ll try to update this review if I remember. I honestly don&#x27;t think anyone will regret purchasing this item. If you do, you really would be in the very small small minority.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t bother with anything else - this is the best one</li>
    <li> I honestly love it! This eyelash curler is way more sturdy than other curlers I had purchased in the past. The coated handle is very comfortable to hold, and I like that it comes with a latch to keep the curler closed. This curler really works, it curls your lashes without pinching or hurting. I&#x27;m not worried about breakage with this curler. It released quite easily, no sticking at all. It also comes nicely packaged in a pretty box and a special pouch. If a company puts so much care in providing you a pretty packaging, it tells me that they put the same care designing their product. It is a great item, and at a very reasonable price. I am planing to look into other products from this company. I am a very happy customer!</li>
    <li> I purchased this eyelash curler four months ago and it worked great. A little more curl than I typically like, but it was fine. Then, a few days ago, part of the black plastic pad on the curler seemed like it was a little cut -which seemed odd, but I didn&#x27;t pay a lot of attention. Until I saw that I had cut off 1/3 of my lashes on each eye! Seriously! About 1/2 way to my lid. I couldn&#x27;t believe it but there&#x27;s no question that it was this eyelash curler that cut them. Steer clear! I had to buy fake lashes so I don&#x27;t look like a freak....</li>
    <li> I got this in high hopes that it would curl my lashes and keep it curled after applying mascara. It curls really well, feels really sturdy, I love the spring opening. I gave it 4 stars because my lashes droop after applying mascara. I even used my blowdrier to heat it a little. The curl was awesome, I applied mascara, then droopity droop droop...maybe it&#x27;s just my lashes, who knows....</li>
    <li> The only thing I don&#x27;t like is the heavy spring that keeps it open -- it&#x27;s awkward and seems totally unnecessary.  It makes it a little difficult to place correctly and it&#x27;s difficult to store unless you keep putting the little holder on every time you finish using it.  I&#x27;ve been using eyelash curlers for many years and have never had a problem opening them.  I do like that it says the pads never have to be replaced, hope that proves to be true after I&#x27;ve used it for a while.</li>
    <li> This is a great eyelash curler. It is very sturdy and grabs all my fine eyelashes. It&#x27;s probably my favorite one out of all my eyelash curlers that I have tried and I own a dozen or more eyelash curlers. I will probably order more to have on hand.</li>
    <li> This is the greatEst eyelash curler I have ever purchased. Doesn&#x27;t pinch or catch. I never thought my eyelashes would stay curled all day. Extremely happy with my purchase. Will buy another</li>
    <li> pinched my eyelids.  top is too wide</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Bella &amp; Bear eyelash curler for a weeks now, it is my new favorite!  When I curl My eyelashes, I put mascara on first, once the mascara is on I wait until it dries, use the eyelash curler then apply more mascara.  This has been perfect on my eyelashes, they aren&#x27;t very naturally curly so I need products like this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My favorite thing about this product is that it doesn&#x27;t tug or pull on your eyelashes.  It&#x27;s easy to use, comfortable and leaves your eyelashes looking great for a while without having to recurl.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;100% recommend!</li>
    <li> I just received this, and already LOVE it! I was previously using a Sephora brand curler that just did not do the job. I have short, straight eyelashes that don&#x27;t hold a curl without a coat of waterproof mascara. My last curler barely got them curled and it was really difficult to get the right angle without pinching my eyelid. This curler is GREAT. It feels really sturdy and seems to be pretty good quality. I&#x27;m interested to see how long it curls my eyelashes well since it says I should never need to replace the pad on it. Received it on time and in the cute box, pictured. So far, I&#x27;m loving it!</li>
    <li> This Eyelash Curler is the BOMB!  I&#x27;m over 40 and have long eyelashes enhanced by several years of using Latisse.  The only issue is, while my lashes ARE long, they are \\&quot;Unruly\\&quot;.  They stick out in multiple directions and if I don&#x27;t use a curler, they look horrible.  Over three years ago I purchased a Shu Uemura online from their site.  I was happy with it and it performed well, but the pads wore out and when I went online to purchase another one, I was disappointed to see that not only were they purchased by L&#x27;Oreal, they were completely out of stock on eyelash curlers on their own website!  The internet is FLOODED with counterfeit Shu Uemuras and frankly I didn&#x27;t want that either.  So I went in search of an alternative.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased another high rated curler, the Billy B Eyelash curler online hoping that it would do the trick.  The Billy B one is \\&quot;different\\&quot; from the Uemura--it has a more rounded shape and I was hoping it would do a fabulous job.  Unfortunately I found that I had a harder time getting the rounded Billy B up next to my eyelash base, and inevitably it would miss my corner lashes entirely.  I&#x27;m sure the Billy B works well for people with smaller, more rounded eyes, and in all honesty the pads on it were great.  It just wasn&#x27;t the right fit for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So again I went searching and that&#x27;s when I stumbled across the Bella &amp; Bear.  This thing is awesome and with a single coat of mascara for work, my eyelashes look a mile long and very well separated.  I can&#x27;t say enough good things about how easy this was to put up against my eyeline and get a good curl.  The handle fits my hand well and the spring loaded mechanism on this means you don&#x27;t have to press all that hard to achieve a good curl.  It&#x27;s flatter and not as rounded as the Billy B, so if your eyes are longer and flatter, this one should be able to easy grab from corner to corner without missing any lashes.  In fact, when I lined up my curlers side by side, you can see the shape of this one is more like the Uemura than the Billy B.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The curler arrives packaged in a box, so you won&#x27;t have to worry about it being broken in shipment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In all, I&#x27;m so happy with this eyelash curler that I will never go back to another brand.  So long as this one never gets broken I should be in business for a very long time.  I&#x27;ve already recommended it to a friend to use on her daughter&#x27;s long eyelashes during dance recitals.  My search for the perfect curler is over!this one is more like the Uemura than the Billy B.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The curler arrives packaged in a box, so you won&#x27;t have to worry about it being broken in shipment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In all, I&#x27;m so happy with this eyelash curler that I will never go back to another brand.  So long as this one never gets broken I should be in business for a very long time.  I&#x27;ve already recommended it to a friend to use on her daughter&#x27;s long eyelashes during dance recitals.  My search for the perfect curler is over!</li>
    <li> I barely ever bothered with an eyelash curler. They pinch, poke, and generally a pain to fool around with. So when I received this one I was doubtful that I would like it, much less enjoy using this product. I am a good sport however, and gave it a go. First there was NO pinching. What a relief. It is quite painful to pinch your eyelids. No pinching, no pulling, and a breeze to use. Just 10 seconds and bam you have awesome looking eyelashes without all the fuss. I am so glad to have found this. This eyelash curler is a must have in your makeup bag. If you have given up the hope for finding an awesome eyelash curler like I did, you have to try this out!</li>
    <li> does not curl any better than my revlon eyelash curler.</li>
    <li> Wow, does this every work.  Throw out all your other eye lash curlers ladies....this is the best and I have been curling my lashes for 40+ years.  You won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
    <li> I have to admit...I did not use a curler regularly because I never saw the difference. Well now I know why. I have inset eyes so my curler wouldn&#x27;t even fit right. I could only grasp the very end  of my lashes and in the end I couldn&#x27;t even notice any difference. But that is certainly not the case with this one! I love it! Even my husband noticed the difference! Very happy!</li>
    <li> I had kind of given up on eyelash curlers because I would always get pinched and they never really seemed to curl, they more or less just &amp;#34;folded&amp;#34; my lashes.  Not so with this one!!!  Loved this product from day one!  Works great! Co-workers have even noticed a difference and I keep finding it in my daughters room (where I did not leave it) so I guess I will be ordering a second one :-)&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for making such a great product!!!</li>
    <li> Seems to be a very nice curler.</li>
    <li> This curler works great! It&#x27;s so quick to use, I can curl my lashes in like half the time it takes me with my la cross curler. Also, there&#x27;s no way to accidentally pinch your eyelids with this curler, it&#x27;s very safe to use.</li>
    <li> This is hands down the best eyelash curler i&#x27;ve ever used. I have eyelashes that stick straight out and this baby curled them with no problems, no pinching or breakage. Wish I would have bought this sooner.</li>
    <li> Drum roll please...I have just become the recent owner of, hands down, THE BEST eyelash curler I have ever used. Not long ago ago while I was in Miami I told my mom I really needed a new one. Well ask and you shall receive! After reading all of the reviews, I gave it a whirl and waited like a kid on Christmas for it to come in. When it arrived I giddily opened the package once it arrived.&lt;br /&gt;The box in which it comes is totally adorable. Of course I love the polka dots! And the story of their cats is adorable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The eyelash curler is smaller than most I&#x27;ve seen sold in grocery and cosmetic supply stores. It fits in my hand perfectly and I absolutely love the deep red color of the spring-loaded handle. It&#x27;s sturdy and you can easily tell it&#x27;s constructed with high quality materials. The superiority to other products on the market is obvious through the look and feel. While using this one, there is a rest for the middle finger while you&#x27;re curling the eyelashes. It&#x27;s great that Bella and Bear kept ergonomic design in mind!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My eyelashes are pretty straight and often other eyelash curlers will fold them or cause what looks like a dent. Not this one. It appears as though this would work for someone with even really deep set eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am impressed and I fully intend to make this a long-term relationship!</li>
    <li> It does work ok but I wouldn&#x27;t say it&#x27;s as great as portrayed.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m sorry. I don&#x27;t really like this eyelash curler. I have long eyelashes, but straight. This curler is hard to pinch and not very effective. I&#x27;m hoping it will loosen up with further use. Also, the curl doesn&#x27;t last long enough for me to curl both eyes and apply mascara; I need to do one eye at a time. I expected more because it was rather expensive.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this curler for about 4 months now and it&#x27;s been working great.  My eyelashes don&#x27;t stay curled any longer from this eyelash curler than other ones that I&#x27;ve used in the past but it&#x27;s gives a good curl and covers all of the lashes in one curl.  My previous curler was one of the small plastic Japanese curlers but it broke after about 9 months and this one is much sturdier and should last a lot longer.  Also, I like the ability to heat up this curler by using the blow dryer on it for just 8-10 seconds so that it&#x27;s warm (not hot) and then curling my lashes and holding for about 15 seconds.  This definitely keeps my eyelashes curled longer!</li>
    <li> It is a nice looking lash curler but it absolutely refused to curl my stubborn eyelashes.</li>
    <li> Been looking for a curler that can curl my small, short, and straight lashes and this one was the one! it does not pinch my eyelids, makes my lashes stay curl for a long period of time and is very soft weight.</li>
    <li> Curler is a little wide, so you have to be careful not to pinch yourself. But, the fact that I don&#x27;t have to replace the pads is a miracle and I have seen no sign of it cracking or breaking like some others I&#x27;ve used.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical because I&#x27;ve tried so many eyelash curlers since the original Shu-Uemera (sp?) was removed from the US.  All except for Tarte brand have been absolutely worthless.  The pads of the Tarte curler need to be replaced every 3 months and the curler itself gives out after 6 months, typically the &amp;#34;spring&amp;#34; mechanism snaps.  The curl of the Bella and Bear is GREAT.  It curls quickly and the curl lasts.  It seems to be very sturdy and it says it will last so time will tell but I am optimistic.  I have long eyelashes that are poker straight so one or two passes with this curler and a tip of  mascara and I&#x27;m done!  I love it it so much as a matter of fact,  that the next time I make a purchase from Amazon I will order another, just in case Bella and Bear stop making them!</li>
    <li> Disclosure: I got this product as part of an advertorial.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This eyelash curler curled my lashes perfectly! I have not used many eyelash curlers but this one definitely did the job. I was able to get close to my eyelid and not actually pinch it! I’m not a pro at actually curling my lashes but this worked well. It is really cute and very well made, I definitely love the quality of this curler as opposed to the random curler I purchased from the beauty supply store. I’m not sure I curl my lashes enough to spend $16 on one so I&#x27;m really happy that I received this one, but if you do curl your lashes on a regular I think this one is great quality and is definitely worth the money!</li>
    <li> Does not live up to hype</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this eyelash curler. It always gets all of my lashes, and the results are amazing. There isn&#x27;t any pulling or pain and the retro box design is adorable.</li>
    <li> Excellent product, and I have tried every eyelash curler in existence! Terrific vendor as well!</li>
    <li> Worth every penny. Best eyelash curler I&#x27;ve had yet.</li>
    <li> I just discovered Bella and Bear and I absolutely LOVE their products! I have to say, Bella and Bear is an amazing Brand and I hope they will be adding more products soon. When I bought this product I was skeptical to the quality. After all, it is inexpensive. However, after reading all the glowing reviews, I decided to buy it. The &#x27;Eyelash Curler: Eye &amp; Mighty&#x27; came within two days and all of the packaging was secured very well. The packaging is extremely cute and durable. The eyelash curler looks exactly like the picture (silver metal with smooth red handles) and does a fabulous job at curling eyelashes. My lashes seem to have a mind of their own, pointing at what seems in every direction imaginable. This product tames my lashes and adds a little lift before I even put mascara on. This eyelash curler keeps my lashes neat while doubling the size instantaneously. I had my sister use this product and she loves it almost as much as I do. She has naturally long, curly lashes and has never had a need for eyelash curlers; but after using this product, her lashes are even more beautiful than before.I definitely recommend buying this product.</li>
    <li> I bought two different eyelash curlers from Amazon recently as my daughter and I were not happy with the ones we had been using at home.  I loved the presentation of these eyelash curlers and how they felt in my hand.  Unfortunately for me these did not really fit my eyes however my daughter LOVES them.  They were a perfect fit for her eyes.  She is enjoying them.</li>
    <li> This eyelash curler is well made, and it&#x27;s a good one.  With that being said I will have to say that after I read all the reviews on it before I bought it, I was expecting something fabulous, and really, this is just a really good eyelash curler, nothing more.  I have owned eyelash curlers for many years and my last one was a Revlon brand that I paid less than $5.00 for and for the money, it was almost as good as the Bella one.  I have no regrets on buying the Bella curler, and if you&#x27;re considering it, I would say go for it, it does what it&#x27;s supposed to, but it won&#x27;t be a glorious experience by any means as it may appear from some of the other reviews.  It will pinch your eyelid if you don&#x27;t grasp your lashes correctly.  It will crimp your lashes if you don&#x27;t grasp/squeeze properly, as any eyelash curler will do, and as some of the other reviewers stated, the curl isn&#x27;t long-lasting. As I said this is a good item, just don&#x27;t expect miracles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m hoping the pads will be more durable than the other brands I have owned and only time will tell on that.</li>
    <li> Meh - it wasn&#x27;t for me.  Thought I&#x27;d love it from all the great reviews, but it&#x27;s just ok.</li>
    <li> curl&#x27;s like a dream. definitely curl before mascara though</li>
    <li> Really great product- as most other reviewers have said, doesn&#x27;t pinch and truly curls your lashes (and the curl lasts)! Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> This Bella &amp; Bear eyelash curler is really nice. The handle is very comfortable. The curler part gets all of my lashes and doesn&#x27;t pinch my eyelid at all. I have tried many eyelash curlers and they always end up pinching my lid or even hurting when close to my lash line. I have naturally long lashes but I like curling them just a little bit every now and then. This is the perfect eyelash curler and has replaced my high end one that cost almost triple the price of this one! The pad is very strong and durable. According to Bella &amp; Bear the pad never needs to be replaced. These are excellent eyelash curlers and without needing a replacement pad they are very cost effective. *promotional pricing received for testing and review*</li>
    <li> I am very picky with my eye lash curlers and this one is by far my favorite!  I usually have to throw it out or give it away as they do not work. This Ine is awesome!  No pinching and it really does curl!</li>
    <li> I loved this the first few days I used it and then it happened, my eyelashes broke right in the middle of my eyelid. I also noticed that the part with the pad on it is loose and wobbly. Very disappointed after reading all the great reviews.</li>
    <li> I received my order on time. I used my curler only twice now and I love it</li>
    <li> I have tried practically every lash curler &amp; I had begun to think they were all the same. This one is truly different. Not sure why it works but it&#x27;s the only one I&#x27;ve used that actually works. Very happy!</li>
    <li> Best eyelash curler ever!!  Doesn&#x27;t feel flimsy, always curls and is priced right!  You won&#x27;t be disappointed!!</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t pinch my Asian mono eyelid and comes in a nice box, good quality.</li>
    <li> Curling one&#x27;s eyelashes does make a huge difference in the eyes appearance.  This curler&#x27;s rubber pad is almost twice as thick as any other curler I have had.  The company is top notch to work with.  The curler comes in  a lovely box, so very feminine  One&#x27;s eyelashes will appear longer after curling.  These are very well made, good construction, and comfortable to hold.  I haven&#x27;t pinched my eyelid using this curler because of it&#x27;s unique design.  I was pleased to review this product, and recommend these to anyone with eyelashes!!  Vicki @ Dragonfly Tales</li>
    <li> Total let down. The company was nice enough to refund my money so I gave them an extra star for that. Usually Amazon customers steer me right with their reviews, but in this case I don&#x27;t understand all the 5 star reviews. These eyelash curlers did not even work as well as the cheapest drugstore brand I&#x27;ve used. Yes, they are comfortable to use with their large handles, but if they aren&#x27;t curling the lashes there&#x27;s not much point.</li>
    <li> I was so excited to get this product! Ordered it at discount and certainly know I snagged a good deal . I bought this product for half the normal price because I joined their beauty club. Which is a great club to join if you are interested, Either way I got this product nice and fast . I also love the fact that they offer a money back offer if you are not happy. This is not like any normal lash curler, and it certifiably does it job. I would definitely recommend it .</li>
    <li> NOT &amp;#34;the&amp;#34; best.</li>
    <li> Absolutely the best eyelash curler ever!</li>
    <li> The thing I love most about this eyelash curler is that it has some weight to it.  I have had in the past some curlers that just felt very cheaply made and I just ended up getting rid of them.  This one feels good in the hand and while you are using it.  Also you don&#x27;t need to squeeze very long.  I can tell a difference in my lashes when I use this and don&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> Beat eyelash curler ever! Need to purchase another for gym bag! A must have!</li>
    <li> Update: a year later and it&#x27;s not even worth it. Paint came off and all around felt cheap..   Its just an eyelash curler, I didnt even get a replacement for the curling part of it... It&#x27;s okay I guess not really impressed for a 15$ eyelash curler.</li>
    <li> I have been looking for an eyelash curler that works on my skinny eyelashes for a long time.&lt;br /&gt;I was using a battery operated heated curler but it went through batteries way too quickly.&lt;br /&gt;After reading reviews I tried this one. Fantastic.&lt;br /&gt;My lashes have never curled so easily and so well.&lt;br /&gt;They stay curled all day and my eyes look brighter and more awake.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend curler and it is a great price for high quality.</li>
    <li> I have just found THE BEST EYELASH CURLER! YAY Being in the cosmetics industry for over 25 years this truly is a fab curler! I have worked with many top named curlers. &amp;#34; from the megga popular mass purchased three letter name brand&amp;#34; to the Japanese brand retailing close to 100$ this one does not stick to lashes nor tug at my lashes nor break them. Super happy!</li>
    <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE This eyelash curler! Not only does it work wonders (i put mine under the heat of my hair dryer for 10 seconds and curl 3 times each eye for BEST and most DRAMATIC results). They have the cutest products! All have the fun and flirty floral pattern and this curler comes with its own little cloth bag! I cannot say enough good things about B&amp;B. I&#x27;m a forever customer!!!!</li>
    <li> This eyelash curler is great in most ways - it works quickly and is very effective.  I wish it wasn&#x27;t so pokey on the ends, though!  It pokes me above my eyelids every time I use it.  Not a major complaint.  It still works way better than my old Shu Uemura and Tweezerman ones.</li>
    <li> Like that it doesnt pinch my skin,but i dont see any difference it how it curls the lashes</li>
    <li> I. Love. This Curler. I could not be happier with it!!!! Years of curling my lashes with mixed results, and at 46 I finally found my forever curler. Thank you!!!</li>
