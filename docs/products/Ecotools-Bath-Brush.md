      <li>There is a better brush that has perfect stiffness (subjective and will be determined by your preference).  </li>

      <li>This is a good bath brush.</li>
      <li>The company are good people though.</li>
      <li>If it a good scrub you want choose another brush.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have only had this brush for a couple weeks, and already it&#x27;s starting to crack apart. There are thin strips of bamboo running the length of the handle...and they are just starting to gap apart. Sad too, because this is the first back scrubber i have found with soft enough bristles.</li>
    <li> my kids really love the brush. they thought it was going to be hard but it was soft and ticklish.</li>
    <li> The bristle stiffness is just right- tough enough to scrub without irritating soft back skin. Attractive handle looks like laminated bamboo and feels good in the hand. Handle is long enough to reach any spot on my back.</li>
    <li> Decent for the price but for a back brush I would like stiffer bristles than this has.  Handle can be a bit slick when soaped up too.</li>
    <li> Bristles are good replacement for washcloth scrubbing when you can&#x27;t reach &amp;#34;there.&amp;#34; I prefer the brush to not be scrubbing-tough. Handle is easy to hold on to.</li>
    <li> Good product, as described; sturdy, a bit soft for my liking but if you are looking for a bath brush this is definitely the way to go!</li>
    <li> Great bristles. Nice for the hard to reach spots.</li>
    <li> This is a well-made brush, the bamboo bristles were part of the initial attraction for me, but they turned out to be both too short and too soft.  Also the handle is absolutely flat, whereas a really effective backscrubber will be at least slightly angled and therefore easier to use in getting to those hard-to-reach places.  You are better off spending $7.00 at Bed Bath &amp; Beyond.</li>
    <li> This brush suits us just fine. Its length, balance and flatness allows it to really hit the spot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also works as a bath brush. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, a more recent purchase of the same brush ended up splitting after not too much use or wet/dry cycles. Inspection revealed it to be made of thinner, lower quality  wood and was 10 percent lighter on our kitchen scale.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I were buying another one again today, I would keep it oiled with Watco wood oil to keep the water from penetrating it in hopes of a long life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would also recommend buying one in a store, where you can select one with darker wood. Ours cracked at the lightest wood layer.</li>
    <li> I like this bath brush a lot. I learned from a cosmetic representative to first use a bath brush on dry skin in a circular motion-then use it to shower or bathe. It&#x27;s soft, but effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t know why one reviewer gave it such a low rating. I&#x27;d buy it again.</li>
    <li> Too soft to do anything</li>
    <li> I should have read more  reviews before I bought this.  The bristles are too soft and the liquid soap I use slides right off the brush.  Wish I could return it.</li>
    <li> Works perfectly and much sturdier than any other bath brush I&#x27;ve used. Very solid construction and it has surprisingly soft bristles.</li>
    <li> great price for a great item</li>
    <li> Great product. Bristles are soft but still do the job getting you clean. A good investment if you care about your personal hygiene.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s awesome I bought two just in case. Bristles are not too stiff so it&#x27;s easy to brush especially when you&#x27;ve got fresh wounds. I&#x27;ve had it for a month now and the bristles are still intact and the handle hasn&#x27;t warped either.</li>
    <li> I use this brush in the shower. It&#x27;s a little softer than I expected it to be, but it gets the job done - I definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> Got gross quickly. (the wood got mildew on it) But It was great while it lasted for the short while!</li>
    <li> Bristles are way too soft. Doesn&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m getting a good scrubbing.</li>
    <li> Nothing super fancy, does exactly what you&#x27;d expect it to! Only downside is the short bristles—I often hit the wood when doing my elbows, knees, etc. Love it otherwise, though!</li>
    <li> The clumps of bristles are not very close together, which makes the acne liquid soap I use for my back fall to the bottom and not be very effective. Otherwise, the bristles are soft, the brush is very light, and it is made from one piece of wood which is great (won&#x27;t fall apart from the warm showers).  I just wish the bristles were more dense.</li>
    <li> This brush works well, reaches where you would expect and does so comfortably.  almost too comfortably, I could stand for the bristles to have a little more resistance to them, but nonetheless they do their job well.  The handle is shaped alright, and has a small rope loop on the end for hanging, which should be larger to fit over more things but is somewhat helpful nonetheless.  Overall great for what it is and what most people would expect it to do, with a few small flaws.</li>
    <li> I thought the brush was well made but the bristles are a little soft so I don&#x27;t feel like it does as effective a job of scrubbing as I would like.</li>
    <li> This brush for less than $5 delivered is exactly why I love shopping on Amazon.  The bristles are perfect, and the brush feels like a much more expensive brush.</li>
    <li> $5.99 on the ecotools website.</li>
    <li> Amazingly soft, perfect for gentle exfoliating! Someone people say its too soft but I don&#x27;t have barnacles so I feel it works great. If you are human I feel it will work great for you too.</li>
    <li> The brush itself wasn&#x27;t exactly as depicted and the wood color was much darker, which I actually like. But, the bristles were VERY soft, which I don&#x27;t like.</li>
    <li> Loved the bristle strength and handle length.</li>
    <li> bristols are way too soft (don&#x27;t scrubb)</li>
    <li> Ordered this for my husband.  He loves it, especially for the long handle and solid construction.  He had previously had one with a removeable brush (which would come off when he didn&#x27;t want it to) and one with the brush part just glued in place and the brush went flying mid-shower after a few weeks.  This is very well made and should hold up well with daily use.  Excellent price and a happy hubby - can&#x27;t ask for more.</li>
    <li> The Ecotools Bamboo Bristle Bath Brush (B0020HEBX8) is most satisfactory.  It fits well in even a soapy hand, feels great on the skin.  Best back brush I’ve ever used.</li>
    <li> This bamboo bath brush feels very nice and soft.  The brush head is plenty big for the purpose.  The handle feels solid as well.  If you are looking for harder bristles, you may want to look elsewhere though.</li>
    <li> I am assuming that the bristles will soften with use, and I like the long handle, just wish it came with a hook for hanging instead of the string for hanging.  The reason it only gets 4 stars is because it was over packed in a humongous box.  There could easily have been a gross of these brushes in the box.  Huge waste of space, glad it was on Amazon Prime.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a bath brush, nothing special.</li>
    <li> I like everything about this brush (coarseness/softness of bristles, length of handle, size of area of bristles, cost, etc.).  I would &amp;#34;love&amp;#34; it if the handle were bent or shaped in some way to aid reaching the middle of one&#x27;s back.  I will edit my post if lack of longevity becomes an issue.  Otherwise, very good brush.</li>
    <li> This is an amazing bath brush…very soft, &amp; enjoyable. I love the shorter bristles that make less of an opportunity for mildew to collect since it can dry quicker…All in all it&#x27;s one of the best bath brushes I have owned.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my fiance; he&#x27;s got eczema on his back and has a hard time reaching it in the bathtub (like most men!  or people, for that matter).  He says it works well - the handle is long enough for him to reach everywhere on his back, and the bristles are stiff and give him a good scratch/exfoliation while also washing and lathering up the soap.  This combined with some other products (Gold Bond lotion and a lotion applicator) have help reduce the eczema.  I know it&#x27;s working because he doesn&#x27;t ask me to scratch his back as much :)</li>
    <li> I have a few makeup brushes from Ecotools that I love, and picked this shower brush up based on the positive reviews.  I bought it to use in the shower as a back brush, and it works great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does have really soft bristles, which I actually prefer for a washing brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s also vegan and eco-friendly, as all Ecotools are.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking for a firmer brush for dry skin brushing, I&#x27;d recommend the [[ASIN:B0002JFZDQ Yerba Prima Skin Brush Vegetable Fiber Brissle]].&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I&#x27;m keeping this in my shower, so I&#x27;ll update it in terms of how well it holds up in wet conditions.</li>
    <li> First and foremost what kind of person build it, where is the curve?, so you can actually nicely scrub your back. Second it is soft, so soft that pretty soon it will be flat, because I would like to feel some scrubbing. Third, bristles start falling after maybe 4th or 5th use......</li>
    <li> It gets the job done but I&#x27;d like the bristles to be a little more stiffer.</li>
    <li> When I first got this brush, I thought the bristles were going to be too soft, but when I used it, I was pleasantly surprised to find out it really did a good job.  If it had a curved handle it would be perfect.</li>
    <li> Highly recommend. I have been using it for more than 3 years and its condition is still great.</li>
    <li> I see a lot of people complaining about the bristles being too soft. I think the softness is just perfect! its mildly abrasive. Any harder bristles and the brush would actually be damaging the skin. My advice if you find the bristles too soft use an exfoliant. But the brush feels great, reaches all the hard spaces, and has a very cool look. Feels A bit awkward using it cause its so long. Only Major concern was the MASSIVE box it shipped in.</li>
    <li> I was pleased with the price and quality of this brush. I had payed more for hard bristle Bamboo bath brushes and gotten less. The hair bristles of this brush massage the soap into the skin with a rejuvenating feel.  I would absolutely recommend this find.</li>
    <li> It is made of very good materials, but the bristles were far too soft for my taste.  I was really looking forward to a good strong back scrub, so this was a disappointment.</li>
    <li> I liked this brush purchased July 4th.  Today it fell in the shower and the wood handle split the brush in two.  I liked the feel of the brush before it broke.  Now it is garbage.</li>
    <li> Bristols are a bit too soft.</li>
    <li> With an itchy back I wanted a really stiff back brush.&lt;br /&gt;This one was much stiffer than what I had and exactly met&lt;br /&gt;my needs.</li>
    <li> Bristles were fine and was easy to use. I don&#x27;t use it regularly but have been using it once in a week. It is made with bamboo and is of-course eco-friendly. I will recommend it to others.</li>
    <li> The bristles on this brush are absurdly weak. It is worthless as a brush. Others have commented on this. I am going to toss this and get something else.</li>
    <li> Great brush for the shower.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d give it 5 stars except I wish the bristles were just a little stiffer.  Other than that, this is a great brush.  I&#x27;ve had it for several months and haven&#x27;t seen any real wear on it.  It&#x27;s a great buy.</li>
    <li> Cheap and the bristles aren&#x27;t too scratchy(they are a bit scratchy but that&#x27;s good). I would purchase again at this price.</li>
    <li> Very good. Soft bristles. If you&#x27;re looking for a scrub brush look elsewhere.</li>
    <li> i like it. good for face and back scrubbing</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a bamboo brush that cleans your back.  The bristles do the job, but I just wish they were a bit more stiff, but that&#x27;s a personal preference of mine.</li>
    <li> Frankly I am concerned about Amazon standards.  This brush came in the box 24x14x14 filled with fillers, since brush itself took maybe 1/20th of the space.  Is anybody here concerned about the environment and how much unnecessary garbage this is producing?  The brush itself is no good either - so soft it will not be able to do any job of brushing.  Overall - wasted money and garbage production big time.</li>
    <li> The quality of this product is fine, but the bristles are WAY too soft.  I have sensitive skin too, I have to press so hard with this brush that the wood digs into my skin.  Would not buy again.</li>
    <li> like others stated, this bath brush is too soft. However, it is holding up well, there are no cracks in wood.  The bristles stay put.  Handle is long enough.  I like this brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 8/7/15:  The Ecotools Bamboo Bath Brushed cracked near the bristles so I returned it.  Changed my rating to one star.  There is a better brush that has perfect stiffness (subjective and will be determined by your preference).  It is called: B&amp;uuml;rstenhaus Redecker Long Bath Brush, Natural Beechwood Handle, Pig Bristle Fibers, 19-1/2 Inches Long.  I will review this and show pictures when I have time</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s quite nice, the only problem is that, for me, it&#x27;s too soft.  But that&#x27;s a matter of personal taste.  I really like the fact that this brush is one solid piece.  I had one where the head came off, which seemed convenient at first glance, but the head kept coming off all the time.  I like this better.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had a few different bath brushes before, and this is now my favorite. Unlike synthetic bristles, these aren&#x27;t uncomfortably scratchy or poky, yet they are stiff enough to scrub effectively. Unlike ones with attached heads, this one won&#x27;t come apart after repeated exposure to moisture. My one complaint is that the handle is a bit uncomfortably long for me (I&#x27;m 5&#x27;6\\&quot; or so), but on the other hand, I definitely don&#x27;t have any trouble reaching body parts. I like mine enough after 6 weeks of use that I&#x27;m back to order another for my daughter.</li>
    <li> Works great, but as others have said the bristles are a bit too soft.  That would be the only thing I would change, but for the price it works great.</li>
    <li> With visitors coming, I purchased this bath brush for the guest bathroom. I was expecting both form and function in the product. Unfortunately, the way it was packaged left a sticky tape residue across the wood on the back of the brush. I first tried soap and water to remove the residue. No luck! Then I used a &amp;#34;Magic Eraser&amp;#34; sponge. No luck! I ended up going out to purchase Goo-Gone to get rid of the stickiness. There is still a faint line showing where the tape once was, but at least it isn&#x27;t sticky. I have no idea why anyone would have packaged it with tape directly on wood.</li>
    <li> I really don&#x27;t know why there is nagative feedback for this being too soft. I don&#x27;t want to scrape the heck out of my back, I just want it clean. In my opinion, you wouldn&#x27;t want anything harder than this. Does a great job! When I need to replace this one, I&#x27;ll definitely come back and get the same one!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like to give negative reviews often but this warrants it I think. The brush is actally good size and worked well for reaching my back in the shower. The problem is that it molded in about a week, maybe two weeks :( Totally gross! Nasty black mold. I had a baby recently and have been very busy so I missed the cutoff to return this nasty molded item.  So I am out the money and the brush :/</li>
    <li> This is a great way to scrub all the hard places I can reach the regular way. Three more words required.</li>
    <li> No complaints... It&#x27;s a nice brush and works as advertised. Skin brushing is really good for the skin. I have been doing it for a few months and have been needing less lotion!</li>
    <li> I am enjoying this brush and would recommend it to anyone who likes a soft brush. It has a nice long handle with contour.</li>
    <li> ok i gave this brush 4 stars because I think its too soft, but my husband thinks its perfect. I like a more course brush, but he doesnt. This brush is definitely on the softer side, it will clean you just fine. However, I like to feel really well exfoliated in the shower and this doesnt make me feel that way. Its not a bad brush, but I would have returned it if he didnt love it. The bonus is that it doesnt have the type of bristles that will flatten over time like cheap plastic versions will. The bristles are shorter and softer, but not flimsy. Soap will not suds on this brush, just in case anyone wanted to know. I like the bath brushes where the head can come off from the handle, this one does not detach.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used a lot of other brushes in the past, and have always had problems with the loofah piece falling off (likely they used cheap glue to connect it) or the loofah piece getting moldy in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This solves both problems.  I will buy it again.</li>
    <li> I was hoping for a bit more bite in the bristles but it works well and seems solid. I hot-glued a scrubby pad on the back for the serious scrubbing.</li>
    <li> Bristles not firm enough. But a good deal</li>
    <li> Excellent length of handle, but the brushes could be a tad longer. But the brush is extremely soft. used for for a while now and none have fallen out. would buy it again.</li>
    <li> The bristles on this feel soft to the touch when dry, but once in the shower, they feel scratchy on my back.</li>
    <li> Excellent brush. It has a good length to it and the bristles are firm but not too harsh on my back.</li>
    <li> The bristles are extremely soft, therefore not much of an exfoliater or scrubber.</li>
    <li> Almost all bath brushes I have ever used - especially natural bristles - eventually undergo a change with use where the bristles become hard and stiff; its like scrubbing with sandpaper.  The bristles on this brush have stayed nice and soft for six months already.  I disagree with all the reviewers that think the bristles are too soft.  They are just perfect.  I bought this brush in a supermarket and now I am buying two more from Amazon just to be sure I will never be without one.</li>
    <li> I wanted a brush with more substance to the bristles...it barely feels like they&#x27;re doing anything on my back. the handle needs to be a little bit longer too.</li>
    <li> Works well, and it gets the job done!</li>
    <li> Very soft bristles.  Not sure I like it for my back but I do like it for my face.</li>
    <li> This brush is for my back. The bristles are soft enough to feel good but stiff enough to clean. The last wooden brush I had got moldy. I&#x27;ve had this for six months so I believe it resists mold. Synthetic brushes feel awful.</li>
    <li> arrived super fast looks like a hard brush but it is soft enough for a baby outstanding gets to all those places that are hard to reach&lt;br /&gt;for a cheap price</li>
    <li> I like the fact that this brush is environmental friendly. I think it was made with recycled wood. The only thing is its not practical too wet wood everyday.</li>
    <li> It is a great size-not too big or heavy. The bristles scrub well yet are soft and gentle. It is an excellent product for an even better value!</li>
    <li> Bought a cheap one at Ross, fell apart in about 3 weeks.  I bought this from Amazon and really like it..  Some reviewers complained that the handle is not curved.  I don&#x27;t have a problem moving the brush around in my shower; however, if you have disabilities or difficulty moving this type of brush around while you are in the shower, then yes, I would consider something else.  The bristles are soft to medium; which is just right.  I don&#x27;t think anyone wants hard in a manner that could remove skin.  Buy it and enjoy!</li>
    <li> Nice long handle. holds up very well. Have had it over 2 mos and use it everyday and it is still almost like new.</li>
    <li> I needed something to be able to assist me with washing my back since my scoliosis prevents me from being able to reach everywhere. I was surprised when I opened the package and the bristles were so soft! I thought the bamboo handle would get soggy and splinter from leaving it in the shower all the time, but it hasn&#x27;t yet. It&#x27;s just the right length for reaching my middle back. I absolutely love this! I definitely recommend it to anyone who has trouble reaching their back.</li>
    <li> Very soft dense bristles and the craftmanship seems very good.  It&#x27;s a good size and sturdy.  No complaints, I would purchase again.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a tough-bristled bath brush, and this one is still too soft for me. Great for someone who is looking for that. I&#x27;m still using it until I can find the bath brush I like more. Well made and good size.</li>
    <li> Not the product or sellers fault. It&#x27;s just very very soft and I like to exfoliate with a tougher brush. Not what I was expecting.</li>
    <li> Bristles are too soft and the length is a bit longer than needed. Hard to keep anything on the bristles. Other than that, good.</li>
    <li> I just received the item and almost splintered myself.  Part of the handle was not smoothed well and a piece of the bamboo was splintered already (it was sticking out) and if i wasn&#x27;t careful I would have splintered myself on it.  I tried to simply take out that one splinter, but as I pulled it, it wound up taking off a 3 inch long strip of the handle (making it even more dangerous to use now...and of course since I did this I probably cannot return it).  I would avoid buying this product.</li>
    <li> Bristles are too far apart, too soft and too short.  It was like washing my back with wood.  The wood is solid but that is not good enough.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used the back brush for about one week. I like the way the bristles hold the soap. It is much better than the nylon bristles. Brush is very soft and does a nice job. I am not sure how long the bristles will last, but I will do an update. JMC</li>
    <li> This is a really  nice soft scrub brush. It would be great for dry brushing, but it also works great in the shower. The bristles are well rooted, and firm enough that they do clean, but not so firm that they hurt. I use this on my feet and arms and back and it works great.</li>
    <li> This brush does as it is supposed to. I have no problem reaching my back. The bristles aren&#x27;t too soft or hard. However, the areas around where the bristles attach to the bamboo gets nasty. I&#x27;m not too sure how to clean it. I don&#x27;t want to bleach the brush because that might be too harsh for it. I tried scrubbing with another brush, but that made some of the bristles come out. I wouldn&#x27;t buy this again because of the cleanliness issue. Go for a plastic brush or a loofah.</li>
    <li> I ordered two of these and am glad I did; one for each master bath.  Having lived for many years in Northern California where we periodically had water shortages (because SoCal got ours) then 8 years where water was very expensive I am a master at military showers.  Now with this brush I simly put the liquid soap on the brush and scrub away then rinse off.  It actually feels sooo good I spend a lot of time scrubbing. The handle is a nice  length and has a rope for hanging it up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know if they come anything but super soft but I would like one a little stiffer.</li>
    <li> This wasn&#x27;t quite what I was looking for. I have had this almost a week now. The bristles are way too soft so I don&#x27;t feel like they are exfoliating or getting me clean, they remind me of a high quality baby hairbrush&#x27;s bristles in how soft they are. I think I get more exfoliation from a washcloth. I am hoping that the bristles will stiffen up with use. It may help if the company put the bristles closer together or more densely packed. I do like that the brush handle is one piece and it is very nicely made and smooth. Unless you have sensitive skin I would steer clear of this brush and find one with coarser bristles.</li>
    <li> I bought this brush to scrub my back, but the bristles are so soft that it doesn&#x27;t really give the sloughing &amp;#34;feel&amp;#34; that I would&#x27;ve preferred.</li>
    <li> This is a high quality brush with very soft bristles.  Not a scrub brush, more like a luxury gentle skin massage.  Yummy!</li>
    <li> Great for reaching those hard to reach spots on your back. I kinda wish the bristles were a little tougher but it still gets the job done just right</li>
    <li> Go this for my boyfriend last Christmas and he&#x27;s still using it and loving it- it still looks great! I&#x27;m surprised. I got this as a replacement for an expensive one my bf had that crapped out big time in the end- and he likes this one more than the other one during its good days. The bristles are soft but still firm enough to scrub. Handle is long. No complaints thusfar!</li>
    <li> Bristles are perfect for me - not too hard and not too soft. The only issue I have is that it&#x27;s still difficult to reach some areas of my back. Perhaps a brush with a slightly curved handle would work better.</li>
    <li> This is a quality made brush that should last quite a while. It is a tad bit softer than I anticipated but it still gets the job done nicely.</li>
    <li> I bought this to replace an existing brush of similar build.  I use it to scrub my back after workouts.  I will continue to use this until it needs replacing, but I will not be re-ordering.  The brush is too soft for it&#x27;s intended purpose - exfoliating my back.  Its soft enough to scrub my face with which doesn&#x27;t make it super effective back scrubber.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for taking the time to read my review, and I hope you found it helpful in making a purchase decision.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t find any body brush that is softer than this one out in the market. Yet, it exfoliates very well.</li>
    <li> I used this daily and the brushes sort of gave up after 4 months. Worked well for the meanwhile and scrubbed my body clean.</li>
    <li> The brush is well constructed. The downside is that the soft bristles make it difficult to scrub and clean one&#x27;s back.</li>
    <li> A really good brush with long handle and bristles just the right stiffness.  Every shower I say to myself, &amp;#34;hey self, this is a great scrub at a bargain price.&amp;#34; Get one and you can join  the &amp;#34;Happy Scrub  Club&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> Awesome brush. Just the right stiffness to really get me clean, and long enough to get my whole back even when sore after a workout.</li>
    <li> This is a really good quality brush at a very reasonable price. I bought another brand on Amazon and it was junk -- fell apart on the second use. So I like this, but the only thing is that I wish the bristles were a bit longer and stiffer. I want to scrub right down the center of my spine, and this brush just doesn&#x27;t quite give as satisfying a scrub as I would prefer.&lt;br /&gt;Short of that one little objection, an excellent product at an excellent price.</li>
    <li> It does what it&#x27;s supposed to do. I like it a lot. The bristles are firm but gentle.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t had it that long and have only used it a few times.  But the bristles are soft enough that it is comfortable but not soo soft that you are down to the wood when using it on one&#x27;s back.  The handle seems strong and long enough to get down the back.  So far, so good</li>
    <li> Bristles are nice and soft, but the handle itself is a little awkward and long. I will purchase from BB&amp;B when I need to replace this one.</li>
    <li> A nice brush but the bristles IMHO are about half as long as they should be so it wont last very long.&lt;br /&gt;I would not buy again !!</li>
    <li> Good product, would have like the bristles to be a little more stiff</li>
    <li> I love this brush. I was afraid it would be too coarse and scratchy, but it feels great, and works up a good lather.</li>
    <li> Bristles are just right, nicer with contour handle, but, bamboo has a cool factor, nice. So a solid 4 stars +</li>
    <li> An absolutely worthless item.  The bristles are too soft and porous so it does not work as an even light scrubbing bath brush.  Also it quickly developed a black mold/fungus on the surface beneath the bristles. It became a very unsanitary item to be discarded.&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately this is an item that doesn&#x27;t make being green work although I suppose that it will biodegrade in a landfill fairly quickly.</li>
    <li> It works well.  The bristles are not real stiff.  My youngest loves this brush, because some of the others are to &amp;#34;pokey&amp;#34; for her.</li>
    <li> This brush does what I need it to do, reach places on my back. Be aware that it&#x27;s very soft. If you want to scrape off dead skin cells and exfoliate, keep looking. Amazon sells rougher brushes, too.</li>
    <li> Nicely made brush, glad it is made of recyclable materials, but it was way too soft for a back scrubber.  I&#x27;ve &amp;#34;recycled&amp;#34; it.</li>
    <li> Works well, I was hoping for something a little more softer, seems rough after a bit. But good buy for the money.</li>
    <li> After a long day working in the shop, it&#x27;s great to take a hot shower and have this brush wash the day away. The bristles are great and overall well made. Does a great job reaching all those hard to get spots.</li>
    <li> This brush is great to use and is very soft on skin.  We use on our toddler sometimes.  Product came as described, fast and easy.  The reason it got 4 stars is because it&#x27;s leaving a dark mark on our travertine tiles in shower.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s hard to find a back scrubber with really strong bristles but this one fills the bill.</li>
    <li> This brush has soft yet firm bristles.  The handle is long and I get easily scrub my back.  The handle is wood and several previous plastic ones have broken when dropped in the shower.</li>
    <li> This was a stocking stuffer for my boyfriend.  I was happy when it showed up before Christmas.  The bristles are perfeect.  I plan on getting one for myself:)</li>
    <li> Reading some of the reviews on here, you will notice that there are people complaining about the bristles on this thing. Before you buy this brush ask yourself these questions:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Is your body so dirty that normal bristles won&#x27;t scrub the gunk off? If you answered yes, then go buy some Brillo pads and attach them to a stick for your bathing. These bristles are just the right strength for a normal human to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. Do you want to reach every crevice around your body? If you answered yes, this brush is for you.</li>
    <li> The handle is long and nice but the brush is so soft you could use it on a baby. Too soft for really doing a good job of scrubbing.</li>
    <li> good for use; bar is long enough and the hair is very soft and feels good on skin. better if the bar is designed to be bent a little, so that easier to brush back</li>
    <li> This is a very, very soft-bristled brush. I can&#x27;t tell how well it&#x27;s made, because I&#x27;ve only used it once. I wish I had examined it more closely before I used it, because if I had, I would&#x27;ve sent it back. I am disappointed because I like to use a stiffer-bristled brush all over my body to slough off dead skin and increase blood circulation. This one will not do that. It does have a nice long handle, though, therefore the two stars.</li>
    <li> it is a brush and it works if the rope on the end was bigger it would help better to hang it up</li>
    <li> Loved this brush. It very soft and doesn&#x27;t hurt to use. I am not a huge person, so I found it to be long enough etc. however after a small time hanging in the shower (not in direct spray, just in the shower), the brush head began to turn black and smell strange, so I&#x27;ll have to throw it out as I am not interested in cleaning myself with something spoiled. It was a good price so that was nice, but I don&#x27;t feel I got my monies worth. Therefore, two stars....</li>
    <li> solid wood.  plastic ones would fall in the shower and break.  This one seems durable.  works well and reaches far.</li>
    <li> Such a good product! Really decent size and it has nice soft bristles, not too abrasive on the skin. I was worried i was going to be too small or just not what I expected but it was exactly what I wanted!</li>
    <li> I love it! I brush before a shower cuz i heard it takes toxins out of ur skin and exfoliates, so far my skin feels great and it feels amazing when the super soft bristles brush my skin.</li>
    <li> Fast delivery and good quality product.</li>
    <li> it became way too soft for me i did not like it at all , it did not give me the scrub i wanted</li>
    <li> durable, great consistency on the bristles and not too harsh yet not too light either. As disgusting as this sounds, it helped cut down my acne fairly quickly.</li>
    <li> This brush worked well until it split in two pieces. It may be a bath brush but the moisture caused the wood to split.</li>
    <li> The brush is well made. The brush is soft. It&#x27;s a little too big.  It Would have been shorter. quality is good.</li>
    <li> I will probably buy another one of these in a few months when these should be replaced.  The bristles are not rough and, for all intents and purposes, it appears to be helping.  I bought it because I started breaking out on my back after being hit by a car.  It did help a little.  I added OxyClean to it and that made the condition worse.  I then used Phisoderm and that undid what the OxyClean did.  I&#x27;m now using it with a St. Ives salt body wash for my back.  It hasn&#x27;t made it worse and in conjunction with the brush, it feels really good on my back.</li>
    <li> This brush is very soft and gentle.  It has a great construction and is pretty ergonomic.  I expected the bristles to be soft but it is so much softer than any brush of this type that I have ever used or found in stores.  This brush is perfect for someone that wants a super soft bristle but it was just a bit softer than what I was looking for.  I have sensitive skin that also needs regular exfoliation so a soft brush initially was appealing to me but this was a bit softer than I expected so I am not sure how effective it has been for me.</li>
    <li> The bristles are very soft, but I found the handle a bit too long to use comfortably. For me, it&#x27;s rather awkward and difficult to use because of that.</li>
    <li> I hate the bristles, i like the reach on this brush, the wood is good. But the bristles are way too soft too scrub at all. I am not satisfied with this product at all will never buy again ever!!!</li>
    <li> The bristles are too short and way too soft, so you can&#x27;t get any real scrubbing done.</li>
    <li> MUST SEE UPDATE at end, for just arrived new brush from amazon---Bought one elsewhere previously, and near exact brush which I will describe, first ! Bristle head of similar $5 brush where bristles are affixed to wood, are nailed with 2 tiny nails to handle. Slid half way off as one nail came thru the nail hole. Handle finish has worn off pretty badly, and have couple rows of adjoining bristles missing. Will try nailing back together, but looking for another back brush @ amazon. Actually I like softer bristles, personally. I have decided to order this brush from amazon, since I liked the previous store bought one so much.  Note; old brush details---handle 14\\&quot; long, plus head is 4 7/8 long x 2 7/8 wide x 5/8\\&quot; long soft bristles.  UPDATE--UPDATE--UPDATE about NEW brush; Excellent brush from china, unlike old brush. Creme colored bristles(3/4\\&quot; high) placed solidly into one-piece handle. Handle length 18 3/4 x 3 wide--bristles 5 x 2 3/4. Great grip on handle and NOT thin ! Hang up cord in 1/2\\&quot; hole. Handle edges nicely rounder/shaped. Makes for a light backscratcher. NO cons, but note bristles soft. recommend--200%--quality ! Handle wood grained nicely lengthwise-natural-not lacquered.  Nice paddle for VERY small boat !  NOTE--NOTE--NOTE--Brush shipped UPS service, on time, in a huge 19 x 13 x 13 box--totally filled with large bubble packaging---a bit laughable... but probably odd long item, to use different box. Shipped separate from other 5 items ordered. Help china...buy this brush from them. UPDATE  UPDATE ----  Bought another as gift, being SOFT enough for using on a skin infection without hurting ! Shipped in a huge box like before -- exact same quality brush. Long handle just right and grips great.</li>
    <li> The construction is excellent as is the lenght.  However, the bristles are not long enough and you have to re-apply soap far too often.</li>
    <li> unless your hands are as long as chimpanzee&#x27;s, this will help.</li>
    <li> The wooden handle is smooth and seems to resist water and it&#x27;s nice and long to reach all of my back. The bristles are very soft and do not feel like they are really cleaning, I was hoping for stronger bristles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;update after 6 months or so. mold growing where bristles attach to wood, threw it out!!!</li>
    <li> best bristle brush i haev ever had, perfect hard and softness combined. the only thing i would like to change about it is making the top part removable so youcould jsut hold the brisle part with your hands- which is common in many other bristle products. still great nonetheless.. high quality as no bristles have fallen out yet and i hae been using for one year.</li>
    <li> this product was on time and as described. this product was on time and as described. thank you very much.</li>
    <li> I love bamboo because its so sustainable. I wanted something stiff and rough and I was/am pleased with this. But I think that over time it will become less stiff and rough due to wear and aging.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 2 months now, and it&#x27;s already developed mold where the bristles meet the brush body/handle. A bit disappointed, and trying to figure if I should get a new one or different brand. It&#x27;s stored in the shower on a hanging hook. Generally, the bathroom is pretty low in humidity.</li>
    <li> I love the soft brush better than the.hard ones  it cleans without hurting your skin but you still get the clean feeling</li>
    <li> I have had sturdier bristles, previously, on brushes - and have not torn apart my skin. Exfoliating is not something you need to do everyday, though, so a softer brush, like this one, tends to work fine - that is, if one is using it everyday. However, with a stiffer bristle brush, the user simply does not work as hard, since that would be a bit harsh. The brush I&#x27;d used, with the stiff bristles, also had a better angle. This one&#x27;s just straight and flat. However, it&#x27;s a bit longer than some. An angular brush reaches better, though. So, all in all: decent brush, works fine, by far not the best of its kind ... and reviewers fearing stiffer bristles here are using extreme examples to \\&quot;make their point\\&quot;.</li>
    <li> The brush works very well... and then it gets moldy. That&#x27;s not kosher, man.</li>
    <li> Owned less than 1 month, use and hang in my shower. The overall quality is decent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bristles are way too soft for use as a body brush - softer even than my Bass facial brush (natural/boar-bristle). The bristles are sparse and do not lather soap very well compared to other similar brushes I&#x27;ve owned with natural, denser bristles (like the Earth Therapeutics - although it has its own problems).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bamboo/wood surface is &#x27;fuzzy&#x27; like a fresh plank of unfinished plywood that might give you splinters if you slid your hand across the surface. Although I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll actually get any splinters from this brush, I&#x27;m not 100% certain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would only recommend this brush to those with *very* sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> The wood on the head of the brush was completely split when it arrived. It still works, but probably won&#x27;t last long. I never contacted the seller as I am no going to waste my time returning a $10 product. But there is no way the seller did not notice the damage before shipping.</li>
    <li> bristle are a little to soft could be a little more stiff not what I expected a back brush should be</li>
    <li> I use this brush to brush myself down before bathing, when both myself and the brush are dry. My beauty consultant advised me to try this, when I complained that it didn&#x27;t seem to be having a dramatic effect on my skin when I was using it during showers. This is just the right bristle to brush my whole face, d&amp;eacute;colletage, back, and belly. I use a stiffer brush (Earth Therapeutics Purest Palm Body Brush) for legs, backside, and arms/elbows, and my elbows have never been softer, I barely ever have to lotion them anymore. Body brushing is wonderful - it really helped clear up my skin. I could never use exfoliating products because it always made my breakouts worse. This has a totally different effect. The long handle is seriously long - I can reach my whole back over the shoulder no problem.</li>
    <li> Hmmm....I don&#x27;t know what to say, the item appears to be of good quality and the handle is long enough to scrub all of my back, which was my intended purpose.</li>
    <li> As described and smooth transaction. Thanks! [Four teen more words required. It&#x27;s not enough to give positive feedback, it has to be a pain in the @$$, Amazon is getting ridiculous]</li>
    <li> I got this to replace my old brush which totally fell apart. A lot of these shower brushes are constructed by threading the bristles through a plastic plate which is then glued to the wood - which inevitably falls to pieces.&lt;br /&gt;This brush on the other hand is made properly, with the bristles inserted directly into the wood. It also helps that it is made of bamboo, which is far superior for standing up to the wet and steamy conditions of your bathroom.&lt;br /&gt;I do agree with other reviewers that the bristles could stand to be a little stiffer, but it still works fine and considering the price and the proper construction, it is definitely a good buy.</li>
    <li> The bristles are short 3/4 inch and soft, so if you have an itchy spot (depending on skin sensitivity) you will find you may srub a little harder in the shower.  The length of the handle not inclluding the lanyard is 18.5 inches, just good enough to reach the area that is hard to get on the back.</li>
    <li> I needed this product to apply a topical wash (benzoyl peroxide) to my back. I&#x27;m 6&#x27;1&amp;#34; and the brush can reach every part of my back. The bristles are not stiff, and they don&#x27;t fall out easy. I actually use it on my face when I&#x27;m done with my back. Highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I really love this bath brush.  The bristles are perfect.  Not too hard and not too soft.  I have tossed many brushes because they have been too stiff and harsh and actually hurt.  This one is great.  It feels so good.  Enough to feel you are doing something without hurting.  Love the long wood handle also.  I don&#x27;t see how anyone could be unhappy with this one.  And what a great price.  Unbeatable.</li>
    <li> Bristles could be longer and firmer and closer together so they hold the soap that is a good reach  fairly good quality</li>
    <li> The brush handle is quite sturdy and easy to grab and the brush itself is actually pretty soft. Overall it seems to clean just fine and it made scrubbing my back very easy. The biggest flaw with this item though is that if you don&#x27;t let it dry off completely after each use it will start to grow mold between the bristles and the bamboo. Letting it hang in the shower to dry won&#x27;t work either as it doesn&#x27;t dry fast enough in the bathroom so you will need to let it sit by a window to air dry.</li>
    <li> Bristles are a little soft for my taste.</li>
    <li> Great brush, but very soft bristles</li>
    <li> I love this brush....Its great for kids or anyone with sensitive skin &amp; it has a massaging/ blood stimulating feel. Im going to buy another one for myself. Very Soothing, so it doesnt seem as if it made for dry brushing. Great product to have.</li>
    <li> I really love this brush.  I like the soft bristles and sturdiness of it.  I wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to buy another one like it.</li>
    <li> Helps reduce my scars</li>
    <li> Good brush, very cheap and decent quality. The only complaint that I have is that for me, the bristles are way too soft. I want something that I can use to really scrub my back. The bristles on this brush are more comparable to the bristles on a toothbrush.</li>
    <li> This is a good bath brush. Soft bristles and once piece wood design with lanyard. Just a sort of soft to medium scrubbing feel from bristles and once piece wood so not to fall apart or decay as fast.</li>
    <li> Appear to be well made. Bought for presents so we will see how they hold up after they start using.</li>
    <li> Very soft brush but stiff enough to make my back feel like I am getting a good scrubbing.  Long handle lets me reach places I cannot normally get by hand.  Had back surgery so being able to reach feet and bottom of feet was an issue and this eco brush helps there too.</li>
    <li> This bath brush is great! The bristles could be longer but they are soft when wet. Wood handle feels good in my hand w/long enough reach to get all the places&lt;br /&gt;and won&#x27;t break if you drop it. Would pay twice the price if it were not an add on item but still feel it would be worth it. Thanks again Amazon!</li>
    <li> The bristles are just hard enough and work up a good lather with a bodywash. The brush has a good grip as well. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> nicely finished wood, just the perfect scrubbiness but not too stiff bristles, and it reaches to all those impossible places! decent value for the money</li>
    <li> Good value &amp; good brush. This was the longest-handle natural bristle brush I could find that was reasonably priced. I wish there were longer-handled ones out there, but if so, I couldn&#x27;t find them. I&#x27;m not disappointed in the quality.</li>
    <li> I have owned one of these before and I loved it so much, I bought another.  My first Ecotools bamboo brush lasted three years and then the head split in half--pretty good for heavy usage!  The bristles are nice for me, not too soft or too stiff.  I can rub my back and legs with this and my skin does not turn red.  In my opinion, this is a very good brush for the money.  It helps too smooth out your skin and lessen cellulite bumps.</li>
    <li> The handle on the brush fell off immediately after first use.</li>
    <li> Good: I wanted wood not plastic, and that&#x27;s what I got.&lt;br /&gt;But:  the handle is not at all ergonomic as well as a little short.&lt;br /&gt;And: the (natural?) bristles don&#x27;t seem quite long enough.&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: keep looking.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m going to keep this as a dry body brush instead of a shower brush, due to the softness of the bristles.</li>
    <li> This back \\&quot;brush\\&quot; is a really soft product that was a great alternative to the back \\&quot;sponge\\&quot; I used prior.  It was much better than the latex back \\&quot;sponge\\&quot; I used just prior to this brush.  The sponge was made from latex, to which I have an allergy.  I sponge caused blistering and rash.  The bamboo bristles of the brush are a very soft, non-scratch material the handle is long; so, reaching the lower back is very easy.  I no longer need another person to wash my back![[ASIN:B0020HEBX8 Eco Tools Bamboo Bristle Bath Brush 1 ea]]</li>
    <li> Reading reviews from 2-4 years ago, I wonder if we&#x27;re talking about the same product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is an \\&quot;Ecotools\\&quot; product, implying that it&#x27;s more environmentally conscious. Product marketing reinforces this pretense, claiming the brush was \\&quot;made from recycled and sustainable materials\\&quot; and claims: \\&quot;1% of sales donated to environmental organizations.\\&quot; Sounds great to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regardless of personal or political leanings, it simply makes sense to conserve resources. If for no other reason, conserving energy means less hard-earned money given to utility companies. In this sense, a bamboo brush is a good concept. Bamboo is well-documented to be a renewable resource, especially the timber varieties. (Keyword search \\&quot;bamboo renewable resource\\&quot;) Bamboo grows quickly, and timber varieties can spread up to 40 feet annually, quickly creating a sustainable bamboo forest. Bamboo is used in construction; some varieties can be used for weaving baskets and other containers; there&#x27;s beautiful bamboo flooring that saves cutting down slow-growing hardwood trees. These are some of the reasons I find bamboo products compelling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, it was curious that this one little brush needed to be shipped in a giant box that was a waste of resources. I didn&#x27;t rate the product over shipping, since that&#x27;s on the seller, not the maker, but it does figure into my story with this brush: After a search-and-rescue mission inside the box, the first thing I noticed was that the rope loop attached at the handle&#x27;s end--used for hanging the brush--was cleanly sliced 90% through, like somebody took a knife to it. (We didn&#x27;t do this: The brush being buried in voluminous packing material, our little box knife couldn&#x27;t have presented a threat to the brush.) The hanging loop was rendered nearly useless, and guaranteed to quickly fail. It&#x27;s easy enough to replace, but we paid for a broken component.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bristles are very soft, too soft for our purpose. (Of course, people looking for a very light touch will find this a benefit. I can only speak to my experience.) Being a geek, I took the brush over to our kitchen scale to get a sense of how much force these bristles could handle. Multiple tests showed that about 1.2 kg (2.65 lb) of force flattens bristles. That&#x27;s the equivalent one of the smallest (exercise) hand weights available in most gyms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The old brush that we liked took over 5 kg (11 lb) to flatten its more substantial bristles. While one can use a stiffer brush for multiple applications by varying the amount of force applied, with this new brush those options are eliminated by the flimsy bristles. If you try to scrub your back, you&#x27;ll only end up pushing bent bristles across your skin. The only option is to scrub so lightly that you&#x27;ll barely feel it. In fact, when I tried it out first as a dry brush, I could barely feel the contact. (As a manual therapist with over 25 years experience, and having taught clinical practicum to graduating students, I have some skill in evaluating appropriate therapeutic pressure.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is advertised as a bath/shower scrub brush. Their marketing says: \\&quot;Soft, synthetic britles [sic] gently scrub skin clean\\&quot; and \\&quot;Reaches hard to scrub areas.\\&quot; The directions say: \\&quot;Wet brush and apply favorite soap or body wash to gently scrub hard-to-reach areas.\\&quot; Scrub, scrub, scrub. Their words, not mine. As a shower scrub brush, this brush failed. The bristles began disintegrating after the first shower use, when I had to remove bug repellent after working in the garden. I could barely feel the bristles on my skin. If I was really dirty from a major planting session, this brush would have been useless. Bottom line: I didn&#x27;t feel any cleaner than if I just washed with my hands, and I certainly didn&#x27;t feel as clean as I like to feel after a sweaty gardening experience. These last two paragraphs explain why I concluded that when bristles can&#x27;t handle enough compressive force, they can&#x27;t do the scrubbing job the brush was advertised to accomplish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product may have some utility as a dry brush, though I&#x27;m not sure how. While other reviewers have rightly pointed out that dry brushes shouldn&#x27;t be too stiff, or that older folks need softer bristles, being one of those older folks, I can&#x27;t see how this can serve even as a dry brush. You&#x27;d need to scrub the same area so much to get any exfoliating benefit, that you may end up getting repetitive stress injury to your shoulder, wrist, or hand. (As a manual therapist, I&#x27;ve treated a lot of these injuries.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking for the softest brushing experience possible, this product may be worth considering. Just keep in mind that the manufacturer may either suffer from inconsistent production quality, or their product quality diminished in the years since the positive reviews appeared on this site. Or perhaps they&#x27;re relying heavily on marketing to promote a substandard product to people who, through their own good intentions, can be easier marks to a company profiting by playing the environmental card.

    <li> It really met my requirements-- and I really need it.  I think it is scientific designed for this purposed of cleaning the back.</li>
    <li> This bamboo bristle brush reaches all of those &amp;#34;hard-to-get&amp;#34; places.  When the brush is dry, it is stiff enough to do light exfoliation and when wet it does not irritate your skin.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned better brushes. Handle design allows the brush to slide out of grip when soapy. Bristles on the soft side, which could be an asset or a liability.</li>
    <li> Bristles too small and soft for this big man&#x27;s back.  Gave it away.</li>
    <li> Well built brush.  Bristles are soft enough for delicate skin.  Handle provides good reach for scrubbing back and legs.  Overall good deal.</li>
    <li> GREAT BRUSH--one solid piece---to get those spots you CAN&#x27;T REACH--in the shower--cane in 4 days--GREAT</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful bath brush.  It has soft bamboo bristles, which make it green/eco-friendly.  The bristles are luxuriously soft.  It&#x27;s not meant as an exfoliating brush. For that you&#x27;d be better off with boar bristles.  It lathers well, and you can get to all those hard to reach places.  The handle is contoured for easy grip.  It has a cord for hanging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I especially like that the handle is all one piece.  My last bath brush had a detachable handle, and it would detach at inopportune times, like when I was scrubbing my back.  Because this is a one piece handle, that&#x27;s not an issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had this for a couple of months, and the bristles and sealant are holding up well.</li>
    <li> Hubby said back never felt cleaner!</li>
    <li> After two weeks of use, I&#x27;m loving this brush.  The bristles are just the right firmness.  The handle is easy to hang on to and long enough to reach.  The bamboo wood seems to be mildew resistant.  And the price is right.  This is hard to beat from every angle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One humorous note is that Amazon sent this item to me in a box large enough to have shipped a hundred of these inside of.  I guess someone was bored at the \\&quot;fulfillment\\&quot; facility that day.</li>
    <li> I like this bath brush because the bristles are soft. I do wish they were a little longer. The brush is very well made with bristles made into the brush, all one piece.</li>
    <li> Excellent brush. I&#x27;ve had it for a while now, and it&#x27;s still in good shape.</li>
    <li> I have had several Bath Brushes. But this is by far the best one I have ever had. Very soft and doesn&#x27;t fall apart!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this for several months now, and it has held up just fine.  Easy to use, easy to keep clean, easy to dry.  I&#x27;m glad I bought two.</li>
    <li> Simple bath brush that is built well.</li>
    <li> I agree with  the review that concludes the brush is &amp;#34;great&amp;#34;. At least it&#x27;s a great deal. I once got sucked in to buying a similar brush for $70. Compared to that the Ecotool brush is a great deal. Also compared to the supermarket brushes selling for under $10, it is still a great deal, because those brushes, held together by cheap plastic, shed and quickly disintegrate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Altogether, unless you are looking for something highly abrasive (like a wire brush) this is the best product for the money I have found.</li>
    <li> Back brush. In use every time I take a shower. Satisfied!</li>
    <li> This is a great product, I use it to reach the hard to reach places and it has been holding up well for the past few months. I got it to try it for a cheap price now that I have it I realize what a steal it was! Great product and durable.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t get a chance to use this attractive product because as I pulled it out of the box, an extremely sharp split in the head-potion of the bamboo handle sliced open my finger. It felt like a razor-blade edge as it lacerated my index finger. And it hurt like heck! Not very deep, but still... Clearly a defect in the product not caused by packaging or shipping. The bamboo is split apart twice (heat, dryness, shrinkage???), separation creating the sharp cutting edges. Frankly, I can&#x27;t believe this wasn&#x27;t discovered by inspection somewhere along the process prior to shipping (Is Larry H Parker still around? - hehe:)). I have requested another (and some Bandaids) because I have been without a back brush for years and am eager to get a replacement and this one looks just like my favorite one from years ago - sentimental appeal I guess. I agree with the other reviewers who commented on the short, soft bristles; however, I&#x27;m still going to give this one a chance. If they promptly replace without any hassle, I&#x27;ll probably upgrade the review a star or two. I&#x27;ll be sure to take a good glance at the brush before handling it this time; and I recommend you do too, though this was hopefully just an isolated incidence.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t find anything to complain about with this brush. Others might prefer stiffer bristles, but for me this very soft brush feels just right. It&#x27;s gentle on the skin and, in my opinion, that&#x27;s a good thing.</li>
    <li> Nice design and materials. Bristles are a little on the soft side, but if they don&#x27;t come out and it ages gracefully I&#x27;ll be happy.</li>
    <li> The brush bristles are way too soft.  The brush i just threw out had bristle this soft, and thats why i tried to find a new one.&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t sem to scrub at all.&lt;br /&gt;The brush does have a nice long handle.</li>
    <li> Best back brush I&#x27;ve ever had.  Soft bristles and long handle.  Very soothing.  The ONLY reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars was the handle was straight and I would have liked a slight curve in the handle.</li>
    <li> This is a great brush.  It has a nice long handle so it reaches where it needs.  The bristles are soft yet stiff enough to do a thorough scrubbing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We would buy this again.</li>
    <li> Good quality wood in the brush, the hairs are not nearly as firm as I would have liked.</li>
    <li> Soft enough bristles without feeling too soft (for me) but aren&#x27;t so stiff that you feel like it is gouging grooves in your flesh. I like that it actually cuts down on the frothy-ness of my body washes so I actually feel like they are cleaning my skin and not just leaving a soapy skim on my skin. Great so far for the dry skin on my back I was having a hard time getting to with a washcloth.</li>
    <li> My back has really sensitive skin and the bristles on this brush are perfect: not too hard but not too soft... but juuust right.  I live in a really humid environment and the wood around the bristles started to get a little moldy around 3-4 months, but the price and the reach make it an easy regular buy.  Mahalo!</li>
    <li> This brush gets to those places that are hard to reach. I would definitely recommend this brush -  it gets the job done.</li>
    <li> I ordered this for my husband to use in his shower and he loves it! Not too hard or too soft.</li>
    <li> I like this brush because the brissels are stiff enough to get my back, legs and feet clean without removing the hide. I am 66 years old and my skin is not as thick and tough as it used to be. This brush has served me well for the last year and a half and it is time for a replacement.</li>
    <li> Too straight, doesn&#x27;t fit the back curve, and the handle is a little too long too.</li>
    <li> Soft bristles feel great on your skin.</li>
    <li> Love it.  Hangs in my shower.  Makes it easy to scrub my back and is soft yet works great.</li>
    <li> I really enjoy these. They do the job and do not have any strange smells or anything. Plus they are not too soft or too rough on the skin. I will order again.</li>
    <li> I could not believe how soft this brush was. Let me tell you, it&#x27;s like being stroked with hair that has been conditioned like 100 times. It was very quick to get here and looks very good. Practical brush and the little rope comes in handy to hang on shower hooks when not in use.</li>
    <li> Most reviews focus on the brush being too soft or just soft enough....yes it is soft but if that&#x27;s what you like, great.  Unfortunately, most reviews are written after using it for a few days or even before it&#x27;s used.  I&#x27;ve used it for 10 weeks.  After 6 weeks it started growing mold in the bamboo.  Black mold growing on it and nothing else in the bathroom has mold growing on it....just the bamboo material on this brush.  I would prefer a brush I don&#x27;t have to clean every few days to remove the mold.</li>
    <li> Was looking for a new brush with a longer more comfortable handle and this one is great.  The handle is much more comfortable then a squared type plastic and it&#x27;s length allows me to hold it with two hands as needed to be more precise in where I scrub.  The nylon bristles (no critters killed to make this!) look and feel feel like a natural material and are softer than most bath brushes, but I find them just right to scrub well without irritating my skin.  Love the bamboo as I&#x27;m trying to use less plastic and more products made of natural and renewable materials that won&#x27;t be around in our landfills hundreds of years from now.</li>
    <li> Excellent brush for getting the back cleaned.  It can reach pretty far and the texture is just enough to get a good scrub without causing pain.</li>
    <li> This brush packs a nice sting without brusing. It even hurts over my lace panties. Best when used on bare bottom! Can also use in shower</li>
    <li> Bristles are soft but do the job just right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is one piece so the head won&#x27;t fall off like other back brushes.</li>
    <li> I bought one of these for my wife and she loves it!! In fact I just ordered two more for Christmas gifts. Very soft and works well. Nice handle and is well made.</li>
    <li> Product arrived quickly and as advertised! Now extra words to make twenty total! And that should do it for now.</li>
    <li> I purchased this brush as a gift for my boyfriend. He uses it at least once a day, and is not  delicate with it. It&#x27;s bristles are not too soft or stiff. So far none have came loose or fallen out.  It is one piece so there are no problems with  it seperating.  He often drops it on the shower floor and no signs of breakage yet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*****Edit**** although  we liked the brush! eventually it tended not dry fully and discolor. It may have been due to our well water, which is extremely hard.</li>
    <li> Good solid design with a handle long enough to reach the middle of your back. The bristles are numerous and very soft.  You won&#x27;t get scratched using this brush.</li>
    <li> It does its job but the bristles are fairly soft. I prefer something stiffer for a more vigorous scrub.</li>
    <li> Great brush!! Perfectly soft.</li>
    <li> My daughter recently had a  hip replacement, so we bought this to make her showering safer.&lt;br /&gt;She can wash almost everywhere without having to stretch or reach very much, thus helping her stay balanced.&lt;br /&gt;It soft enough to be considered a gentle washing brush  for arms, legs, back, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s well made, long, and easy to use.</li>
    <li> I tend to get really dry skin in the winter months, and wanted this bristle bath brush for those hard to reach places on my back. There are several things I love about the brush. First, the head and handle of the brush are all one unit, so I don&#x27;t have to be concerned about them coming apart when the brush is dropped or extra pressure is applied. I also like that the bristles are short, because it makes them more effective. I would have liked for the bristles to be just a tiny bit stiffer, but the fact that they are so short almost--almost--balances this. The length and shape of the handle are perfect for scratching your own back!</li>
    <li> I was very disappointed. Before buying given limited income, I read carefully.  The bristles are so soft that one could use a wash cloth instead.</li>
    <li> Soft enough to use on your face and your back.  This is the second one I&#x27;ve purchased and I know they last a long time.</li>
    <li> A good product, handle is long enough, bristles are natural and very soft. My complaint is they are too soft, but it&#x27;s just a matter of personal preference. I bought a couple of these, one to replace my old nylon bristled one, and one for my teen-aged son, who needs to learn to scrub his back. I opted for the softer variety for his sake, but found that I prefer the old nylon dakine. It is like the difference between scrubbing yourself with soft fingertips, compared to using your fingernails to dig in and scratch away. I think a harder bristle does a better job.</li>
    <li> the brush is nice and well made, but too soft and the bristles are far apart, too soft for dry brushing and not convenient for washing</li>
    <li> This brush is awesome.  I highly recommend it.  I see a difference in my skin in just the few weeks I&#x27;ve been using it.  I take it with me out of town and use it daily.</li>
    <li> very soft, works fine. would recommend to everyone who needs a long handle. my last brush was not as nice.&lt;br /&gt;shipped fast.</li>
    <li> All in all it&#x27;s a good item, but some of the bristles were missing (as in falling out). Not a lot, mind you, just one section grouping. It probably would have gone unnoticed if it weren&#x27;t for the bristles laying inside the package as a hint. It could have happened during shipping, just guessing. Not that big of an issue really.</li>
    <li> I mainly bought this for back rub.Since it is straight handle bar it is difficult to rub on back side also it has soft bristles.May be this product is not suitable for Men.</li>
    <li> A well made brush that has a long handle.</li>
    <li> The bristles are nice and do a good job abrasive wise yet do not hurt your skin.  I use a bar of soap on them but a liquid soap might be tough as the bristles are separated apart.  The brush is straight - I wish it had a slight angle to it.  I do like the rope tie at the end so I can hang it to dry.  Overall a decent brush.  Time will tell how the bristles last but they are fastened to the wood itself which is nice - the last brush I had they were fastened to a plastic piece which was glued to the brush.</li>
    <li> Lousy frail-bristled useless waste of materials. Look elsewhere. It couldn&#x27;t knock the pollen off a bee&#x27;s mustache unless one swung it like a cricket bat.</li>
    <li> bristle&#x27;s are too soft for me</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband to wash his back. After using it daily he would prop it up so that it would dry off but it still mildewed very quickly, it went into the trash within two months.</li>
    <li> the bristles are good for those who dont want a scrub, it&#x27;s as soft as cottonballs and more suitable for bathing babies, if that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re looking for</li>
    <li> This was an add-on for my order so at 5.00 it was no big risk. However, my previous brush could scrape your heels down and do some serious exfoliating. I ended up using this brush on my 4 year old twins and they say it &#x27;tickles&#x27; . So very soft bristles that won&#x27;t do the type of scrubbing you&#x27;re looking for.</li>
    <li> While this is the only bath brush I have ever used, it is a great brush.  The bristles are soft while firm enough to scrub and the handle is the right length to cover my whole back.  The only downside is, sometimes the soap sinks to the bottom of the bristles and it is a little hard to wash out, but overall it is a fantastic brush</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay. Does its job in the shower and looks great for a little while, but will start to mold and crack before too long, no matter the temperature of your showers.</li>
    <li> didnt last as long as i&#x27;d like</li>
    <li> Bristel is a little too soft, but it is oK</li>
    <li> Bristles not strong enough.</li>
    <li> This brush holds the loquid soap well and does a fine job of scrubbing,but I am disappointed in the bristle length.  Bristles are less than an unch long.  Also, the stick-straight handle (not curved) makes it awkward to reach areas of the back. I don&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a product that will slough off dead skin this might not be the one for you. The bristles become damp and soft in the shower and don&#x27;t really function as an exfoliant. The bristles are very very soft, even out of the box.</li>
    <li> This bamboo bristle bath brush is soft enough to be comfy but stiff enough to do the job! Seems solid and like it will last forever.</li>
    <li> This is the ONLY bath brush I&#x27;ve found that is soft enough--I have sensitive skin--and also lasts a VERY long time.  Other brushes were painfully rough and would split and lose bristles within a few uses.&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend this to anyone who needs a softer bath brush.</li>
    <li> I had been looking for a bath brush and after a while serching came across this and glad I did. Feels good on my back,It was wait I was looking for.</li>
    <li> I do like the Bath brush. I personally do not use it my husband does. I got him this for Christmas so he can wash his back a little better. He says the bristle&#x27;s are soft but they do the job. He said he would like if the bristle&#x27;s were a little more firmer. He also stated that he does not like the hanging rope that is on the end because it will not fit around the faucet in the shower. He does wish that was a little bigger. Other than that he likes it.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a really good, rough &amp; tough brush to help me as I detox, get all the dead cells off of my skin, &amp; be able to really do a number on my skin, really get into all the pores &amp; grab out anything that needed lifting out...this is just not the brush I was looking for. It may serve very well for people with skin that is super sensitive, or maybe for babies? I&#x27;m not entirely sure, but this is not for pre-detox. This is maybe more of an everyday dry bath brush. I guess it&#x27;s mostly my fault for not reading more reviews before purchasing. Anyhow, it&#x27;s made well, &amp; will probably last a long time, it&#x27;s just not what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> This brush is great!  I love that its eco- friendly and using it has helped clear up some of my body acne.</li>
    <li> pretty much as advertised. also, very sturdy. bristles are tough enough for your back and if you re careful enough they are gentle enough for your face</li>
    <li> perfect for what i wanted. Very soft and good quality brush</li>
    <li> Its my second one. the head split on the last one but I liked it enough to look for another one.</li>
    <li> This was nice. Stiff but not hard. It did start to grow mold because I left it in the shower. I had to throw it away while it was still in good condition because of the mold.</li>
    <li> I like it:) looks just as described and has very soft bristles. Made my skin a bit softer after just one use. I would recommend buying.</li>
    <li> I have never used a bath brush with a handle but bought this one to be able to reach my back.  I am unsatisfied with it because the bristles are too soft in my opinion and squish too easily without the satisfaction of a good, effective scrub.  Might just be a personal preference.  Good sturdy handle.</li>
    <li> I needed a new back scrubber when mine kept breaking--it was made of two wooden pieces put together and it kept coming apart.  This is one solid piece and it&#x27;s bamboo so it looks gorgeous.  I can tell it is much more waterproof than my last one because I can see the beads of water roll off.  The bristles are nice and soft, but still feel like they are exfoliating well.  And it&#x27;s super cheap for the quality!</li>
    <li> Bristles are too soft</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a nice inexpensive brush.  You need a bigger rope on the end to either put around your wrist or hang up (unless you have just a nail in the wall).</li>
    <li> The handle is very nice, but that is about it.  The bristles were very soft... not good for exfoliating... and the bristles were too short!</li>
    <li> This dosent fall apart however a bit to soft for my manly tastes more for a delicate touch but again it dosent fall apart.</li>
    <li> I love this brush so much, I bought another in fear that the next time I need one they won&#x27;t be available!  It is the perfect stiffness to softness ratio.  It won&#x27;t hurt your face and it will get that sticky skin stuff off your back!  I really don&#x27;t care how much they cost, I just hope they keep making them.  The first one is only four months old and is actually holding up quite well.  I expected it to fall apart quicker for so little money.  I will try to get back and let you know when it actually wears out.  I will order the third one, the moment I start using the second brush I have!</li>
    <li> MUCH BETTER than the type where the brush comes off (and keeps coming off.) Not super stiff bristles which I like.</li>
    <li> The bristles are on the softer side of the spectrum but are certainly more than adequate.  I reckon I don&#x27;t have to rip off my outer dermis to be clean.</li>
    <li> Had it for a while with no problems at all! Bristles are still intact, no chipping of the wood, looks brand new even after months of use. I can reach my entire back with ease now when before I couldn&#x27;t wash 70% of my back.</li>
    <li> I purchased this brush after reading a ton of reviews and when i tried it, it was way too soft. The purpose of a back brush is to distribute soap and exfoliate dead skin cells. This brush doesn&#x27;t even distribute soap. The main reason i purchased this one was because it was a 1 piece unit and it would not fall apart.  Back to the drawing board for me.</li>
    <li> This is a perfectly nice brush.  I purchased it to use for dry brushing, and the bristles are too soft for this, in my personal opinion.  It is otherwise just great for use in the shower.  The bristles are even a bit silky.</li>
    <li> I was looking for more of a back scrubber when I ordered this.  The long handle and placement in amazon&#x27;s &#x27;backscrubber&#x27; search keywords also led me to believe this.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a good brush, but as a back  (and body) scrubber, not so much. A good washcloth will get the job done better and easier.</li>
    <li> I was considering this and another bath brush with plastic bristles...I can see now that I would NEVER survive the plastic bristles. I am a bit of an exfoliation-nut who sometimes exfoliates compulsively to avoid that &#x27;caked&#x27; feeling you get from filth. A lot of people noted that this brush doesn&#x27;t scrub so well and doesn&#x27;t feel effective. I was worried about this until I finally got it, and let me just say that this brush does the job. It scrubs the right amount, especially if you use it every day (I use it every other day, though.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, probably unlike other reviewers, I actually turn off the water when I am scrubbing, since the water tends to take away from the scrubbing capacity. Believe me, any harsher and this brush would damage your skin (which shouldn&#x27;t undergo so much exfoliation to begin with.) Things are relative! I have really thick skin and can tolerate it to an acceptable level.</li>
    <li> Though it is not perfect, I can&#x27;t complain too much since I spent less than $4 on it.  I bought this because I like a clean a little better than what a wash cloth or sponge can do for a guy.  It does the job.  The bristles are soft.  I wanted harder/stiffer bristles, but the soft ones that come on this brush are durable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- Cheap!&lt;br /&gt;- Long handle!&lt;br /&gt;- Semi-soft bristles!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-Bristles are fairly soft, but not too bad.</li>
    <li> The bristles on this brush are so soft that I would classify this as a \\&quot;large baby brush.\\&quot;  The handle also gets very slippery when you have soap on your hands.  I think just about everyone will have soap on their hands while in the shower or tub.</li>
    <li> I ordered this brush to replace a wood-handled boar brush that I had for quite a while which had given up the ghost [wood split and boar bristles were shedding]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have owned this brush for a while now and can honestly say it fills the bill for what my expectations of a bath brush are.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bamboo handle seems to be a couple or three inches longer than the brush it replaced [which is a good thing, no, a VERY good thing, I&#x27;m 6&#x27; 5&amp;#34;].. I only use it on my back and legs below the knees, but the added length was much appreciated as these ol&#x27; bones get a little stiffer and less pliable on command [compliable?] each day!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I actually have found the synthetic bristles more conducive to holding the body wash and lathering up than the natural boar bristles in my old brush did.  And contrary to some reviews [IMHO] I have no problem with the bristles length, as I said earlier, they hold the soap and suds up well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this brush to anyone that would like to clean the hard to reach places.  The only reason I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars is I guess I would expect a massage and pedicure from it to give it 5 stars.</li>
    <li> Does the job, quality is good, price is good, what else could you want?  I do not think you will be disappointed.</li>
    <li> bristles are a little too soft for me. I can&#x27;t seem to find a brush that is just right</li>
    <li> Easy to maneuver around the back, it has a long enough handle to where you can reach all the way down your back effortlessly. The bristles are a little softer than I anticipated, but either way it accomplishes the job it needs to.</li>
    <li> Delivery experience was nice and timely, the item was as it was described and the condition was kept up, and the quality of the service was nice but it does not reach ever area of your back try something flexible motion then this one</li>
    <li> I absolutely loved this brush for a couple of months, but even soaking in bleach won&#x27;t clean the mold from around the bristles.  I&#x27;ve noticed this with a lot of the EcoTools products -they&#x27;re great at first, but they don&#x27;t hold up.  I&#x27;ve had the moisture gloves, foot socks, Konjac sponge, makeup brushes, shower cap, etc.  I went crazy and bought a lot of their products, and the only one that&#x27;s held up is the hair brush and sleeping eye mask.</li>
    <li> Great soft bristles, but not curved enough to be ergonomic.</li>
    <li> Love this brush. I always use it. The bristles could be a bit longer though like the ones you find on the wooden brush. But overall it&#x27;s fine.</li>
    <li> I love this back brush.  Right size for my hand, making it easy to&lt;br /&gt;reach back between the shoulder blades.  Only reason I didn&#x27;t give 5 stars&lt;br /&gt;is that the bristles could be a little stiffer for just scratching your back.&lt;br /&gt;I will recommend it to my friends and I WOULD purchase it again.</li>
    <li> The bristles are much too short and soft for me.</li>
    <li> The handle is long enough, but the bristles are a bit soft.</li>
    <li> this brush needs a curve to reach the back its too straight. hard to reach your back ..... I wish it wasn&#x27;t Im sending it back or using it for my legs. lol.</li>
    <li> This bristles of this brush are soft which makes it a comfortable bath accessory to  use. I bought it as a replacement brush &amp; would recommend it to anyone considering the purchase of the same.</li>
    <li> Good not great.  Bristles are a bit thin so soap doesn&#x27;t lather as much as other ones I have had.  However, this one seems to be much sturdier than others, the bristles are soft, and the handle is long enough to do a good job.</li>
    <li> It is so hard to find a back brush like this.  The bristles are soft and don&#x27;t scratch your back but retain their shape.  It looks great too.  If you are looking for a nice soft back brush this is it. It&#x27;s easy to find the other hard scratchy ones!</li>
    <li> I wish the bristles were stiffer but it says &amp;#34;soft bristles&amp;#34; in the description.  Better soft than wire bristles.</li>
    <li> Nice length and materials. Not too rough either.</li>
    <li> Back Brush !!! Matches my others !!!</li>
    <li> The bristles on this brush are really soft.  It&#x27;s good for washing your back or even your feet if you need the extra reach.</li>
    <li> The price was good and the item seems solid enough, but the bristles are too soft to give much of a satisfying feel.  The whole point of an item like this is that it&#x27;s hard to reach certain parts of one and to feel like one can scrub there, and this is so wimpy that even though it reaches it really doesn&#x27;t leave me feeling like I satisfied that itch, both metaphorically and sometimes literally.</li>
    <li> I suffer from itchy back where I cannot reach.  Poor me.  But now I have this bamboo bristle brush hanging from the drawer handle at my bedside.  Works great.  Just the right length to reach the right spots and just enough scratching to itchaway.  I also like the [[ASIN:B002DQMZ5M Dual Sided Back Scrubber/Massager]] and [[ASIN:B0035RE2TA Fantasea Natural Bristle Body Brush]].</li>
    <li> Super soft brush, good for sensitive skin. It will not scratch you or leave your skin marked at all like some stiffer synthetics.</li>
    <li> This bath brush is just O.K.  It&#x27;s bristles are soft and clean well, but they need to be longer.  You end up banging your skin with the wooden part of the brush because the bristles are just too short.  The wood soaks up water and it takes a long time for it too dry.  I will probably look for another one.</li>
    <li> Great brush ,I like it. The soft bristles are just fine. For those of you complaining ,what kind of backs do you have?  I&#x27;ve had other back brushes made of boar ,(never again)they produced mold. With this brush  not a speck. So get one and enjoy...</li>
    <li> Way too soft for me. The handle is way long, but it&#x27;s the bristles that are so soft and have no body, no ability to scrub. I&#x27;d love to see a company make a 13&amp;#34; boar bristle bath brush devoid of plastic. The company are good people though.</li>
    <li> Thought this would be a good brush for my back as I have so much trouble reaching it during my bath. I should have gotten out my tape measure to see how long the handle would be before I ordered it, but since I didn&#x27;t I was dismayed it&#x27;s so long. It doesn&#x27;t have any curve to the handle and I can&#x27;t find a comfortable way to use it on my back. If I hadn&#x27;t already put it in my bath water once I would return it. Too bad as I like anything bamboo because it&#x27;s a sustainable product and it&#x27;s usually very soft.</li>
    <li> I like the idea of a one piece brush. A little bit longer and a little wider on the handle would make it 5 stars</li>
    <li> There are enough good reviews that I knew it would be okay, but there was disagreement about the stiffness of the bristles, so I was curious to find out.  Just to run your hand across the bristles, they feel ultra soft, so I was worried about how well it would do in the shower.  First of all, the flexibility of the bristles is terrific.  They are soft enough to use from head to toe, including my face and neck, but they feel like they are cleaning very well.  To say that I am thrilled with the purchase is an understatement.</li>
    <li> This was a gift for my partner. They absolutely love it, however this one has softer bristles, so it&#x27;s great if you have more sensitive or delicate skin.</li>
    <li> I have owned this brush for a couple of weeks.  It has 4 large splits in the wood at the brush head, where it is thin from the bristle holes.  I would not recommend this product.  The bristles are also extremely soft.  So soft it doesn’t feel like it is cleaning.  The one thing that I do like is that the brush head and handle are one piece, I have had problems with the two piece brushes.</li>
    <li> I ordered this brush based on reviews so I was surprised when the brush arrived with soft bristles. It even has a sticker that states gentle. Too gentle for scrubbing my back in the shower. And much too soft for dry skin brushing. Never removed from package. Shipping was fast.</li>
    <li> This brush is heavy and appears to be very well made. I&#x27;ve had mine for 2 years but have only used it twice. It&#x27;s horrible, horrible, horrible. The bristles are so soft that you can&#x27;t even feel them! Besides that, they are very short. When wet and soapy, they almost lie flat. It&#x27;s like you&#x27;re washing your back with a piece of flat wood! I&#x27;d hate to throw the brush away, but I can&#x27;t really think of a good alternate use for it. It may be good to get crumbs out of a computer keyboard!</li>
    <li> Great brush and the bristles are nice and soft while being sturdy enough to scrub well. I would prefer it had a little larger loop on the handle, but it doesn&#x27;t affect the quality or usefullness.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s kind of soft. I bought another one for my face (Fantasea Natural Bristle Body Brush, 3.5 Ounce ) that one is to hard for the face but would be perfect for the body but it has no handle. But the one that I am reviewing I would say is good for the face.</li>
    <li> Bath brushes don&#x27;t usually inspire me to write a review, but this one is AWESOME.  I use this in the shower to scrub my whole body.  It is very well made:  sturdy wood, just the right length a big bristle surface, and very soft (but effective) bristles. What I love the most is that the bristle clumps are spaced far enough apart that my hair doesn&#x27;t get caught up and stuck in them.  This has been a big problem in the past for me (I have long hair and rogue pieces of hair always gets tangled in the bristles and render the brush useless in a few weeks). I haven&#x27;t had a single piece of hair get caught in this brush. It&#x27;s super easy to rinse out, and it has a nice loop so you can hang it to dry.  The bristles are very soft. If you don&#x27;t apply much pressure, it would feel like you are using a wash cloth. If you apply some pressure, it feels like a brush. This is the best bath brush I have ever had.</li>
    <li> I have two bad shoulders which makes washing my back impossible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The good news is this is helpful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bad news is I wish it were angled like some available on here. Also some people were complaining that the bristles weren&#x27;t hard enough. I thought that was stupid. After using it for a few months, I with the Bristles were harder. It does the job, but I like to scrub at least a few layers of skin off while Im washing.</li>
    <li> The bristles are super soft and work really well.  My only concern is the wood handle may be getting moldy in my shower.  Be careful and hang it up to dry every time it gets wet!</li>
    <li> Great brush ! Bristles stay in, and doesn&#x27;t turn into a spear like others when their when head falls off .</li>
    <li> This is my 2nd brush that I&#x27;m using.  The first one lasted over a year and I ended up throwing it away since it was getting harder to keep it clean.  These brushes may be too soft for some people but for me it it just right.  I&#x27;ve had some brushes where the bristles were too stiff and felt like rubbing sandpaper on my back!  Ouch!  Thought these are soft I find that they still do the job and are comfortable to use.  Another reason why I like these brushes is because they don&#x27;t use metal clips to hold the bristles in the head which can rust.  Maybe not a biggie for you but I hate rust!  Again, these brushes are soft, think &amp;#34;soft&#x27; toothbrush.</li>
    <li> I have been using this brush for a while now. Bristles are holding up nicely. The best thing I like about this brush is the handle and rope remain strong &amp; mold free.</li>
    <li> Perfect length and size for reaching those hard to reach places on your back. Well made with sustainable bamboo. The brush has soft bristles. I may have preferred something a little firmer therefore the 4 star rating, but only on personal preference. would recommend this company and product highly</li>
    <li> I love this product for the following reasons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Ergonomic shape- Curve allows you to get a good handle on it and long enough to reach whole back.&lt;br /&gt;2. Just the right softness to bristles- Easy to lather up and does not destroy your back.&lt;br /&gt;3. Eco-friendly sustainable materials- Bamboo holds up well to moisture and is naturally grippy.&lt;br /&gt;4. Lasts a long time- I had mine for almost a year and will be buying another after.&lt;br /&gt;5. Sturdy- I used to have a cheap plastic one and it broke. This is nice and strong.&lt;br /&gt;6. Cheap- Just as good if not better than fancy wooden handled sets with loofas (which eventually unravel)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been looking for the perfect bath brush as I am not very flexible and finally have found it. I have seen this at retailers for cheaper. Don&#x27;t know why Amazon does not sell this directly. Great product.</li>
    <li> Sooooooo wanted a nice brush to scrub and itch my back. Disappointed</li>
    <li> Great brush just like I wanted</li>
    <li> Love this brush, its great for the back and it feels so good.</li>
    <li> I like the wood and the bristles, just wish more bristles or that they were grouped closer together to keep the lather on longer.</li>
    <li> Super lightweight! but a little too slick for really grabbing onto with soap and trying to scrub hard. It need a little roughness somewhere to grab onto. I&#x27;ma dude and the bristles seem too soft for me but it gets the job done. I use it all the time with my showers and its been lasting for months with very little wear. I&#x27;m mostly comparing it to the last brush I had and maybe I should&#x27;nt. On the flip side, this would  make an excellent paddle to disciple the kids with or your significant other if that&#x27;s how you roll.</li>
    <li> Works we&#x27;ll not as rough as some, which I like</li>
    <li> Excellent quality and just what I wanted and expected.  Thanks for the timly shipping.</li>
    <li> It was super cheap at under $5 so I went ahead and bought it. I realized later that the bristles were too soft, and the handle isn&#x27;t curved so it&#x27;s hard to reach places on the back. Months later, lots of the bristle hairs began to come off the brush. Then, about a year since I bought the product, the brush actually broke in two where the bristles are located (like the glue had come off) ... granted it was wet a lot and it fell from the shower faucet a few times. But I realized something like a cheap bath brush wasn&#x27;t meant to last long.  At the price I got it and for how long it lasted, it wasn&#x27;t bad, but definitely far from good. If you&#x27;re paying over $10 for this brush, then you are definitely over-paying.</li>
    <li> I have had this bath brush for a bit over two weeks at time of review.&lt;br /&gt;This is a good bath brush. It would be better if it had a bend in the handle, but for the price it can&#x27;t be beat. The bristles are soft and on the short side. If you use a light touch the exfoliation is great. If you use too much force the bristles will lay down and do little for you. Overall this is a quality bath brush for not too much dough.&lt;br /&gt;A good ergonomic bend in the handle would have knocked the rating from a 4 to a 5.</li>
    <li> Good looking brush, does the job...it is sturdy enough (have been using for a month now) but I feel like it is too gentle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Support the Amazon review community with your product reviews...it is very helpful.</li>
    <li> I use this brush for dry exfoliating. Its soft bristles are perfect for that. After each use I clean it with a little baby shampoo and towel dry the handle. Then I hang it up to let the bristles dry. I also clean my hair and makeup brushes with baby shampoo.</li>
    <li> Really nice bamboo but the bristles could be a little firmer. I still like it a lot and use it everyday. I oiled it before using for the first time and I make sure I place it on a well ventilated place to dry after using, to prevent molding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;IMPORTANT - Editing my original review:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I used it everyday and developed a rash. At first I thought it was a new shampoo, so I returned the shampoo to the store and kept using the brush. The rash got worse, allover my back and everywhere. I put away the brush and got better in few days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fast forward many months and I found the brush and decided to use it again. Within 2 days my back got a bad rash again and the itch is unbearable. I think the bristles leave some particles that are dangerous to the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Threw mine in the trash and will buy a natural fiber one. :(</li>
    <li> I agree with other reviewers saying the bristles are too short and soft. It will be used until it needs replaced, but I&#x27;ll be trying a different brush next time.</li>
    <li> The bristles on this brush are just right. Not too hard to rip off your skin, but firm enough for cleansing and gentle exfoliation. The handle length is perfect to reach my back. It&#x27;s made of natural material so yes, after a few months it gets worn out and could collect mold. I just buy a new one when I see it getting discolored. For the price, why not? Mine last about 6 months. I&#x27;d say longevity is dependent upon the moisture level in your bathroom. Great product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;8/2/2017 Update: I&#x27;ve been faithfully purchasing this brush &amp; for the first time, they sent me Something different (see pic). It&#x27;s understandable that vendors may make changes but these changes aren&#x27;t for the better. The head is smaller and the handle is no longer reinforced. The bristles still feel soft. A little disappointed. I miss the old model.</li>
    <li> The delivery time  was reasonable, and so far, it seems well-crafted and durable.  I hate buying &amp;#34;El Cheapo&amp;#34; products and getting shoddy crap.  This Brush is a good value, IMHO.</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t believe how much time it would take to get something to wash my back.  The words Bamboo bristle made me think Bamboo scarping across my back.  And I&#x27;m thinking, I just want to wash my back, not peel off the skin. I started to think I would have to buy something girly looking to clean my back (wasn&#x27;t gonna happen) so to save my manhood I risked buying this brush with Bamboo bristles.&lt;br /&gt;The brush turned out to be soft, and it lathers up well.</li>
    <li> This brush works well, but the bristles started falling out fairly quick.</li>
    <li> I really appreciate a good shower brush.  Have the most popular one here at Amazon with longer bristles.  It is a bit heavy and awkward so tried this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hey!  Those short bristles are nice and SOFT.  It cleans and feels superb everywhere.  Bamboo handle is strong and highly water resistant over time.  Handle has a flaw.  It is nice and wide but too flat and thin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have a solution but you have to ride a bike to understand?  Bike handlebars have tape wrapped around them for grip comfort.  You can buy that tape here.  I have two bikes and replaced tape before many times over fifty years of riding.  Took half a package and wrapped this brush.  Used Electrician&#x27;s tape to finish the ends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That tape comes in two rolls one for each side of the bike.  I have two bath brushes as mentioned and wrapped the earlier brush for similar reasons so both rolls were used.  If your not used to wrapping bike bars practice a little.  You need to overlap much more on brush because it is much shorter and you want it thicker anyway.  Pull pretty hard to bend tape and make it tight.  One problem is that tape is not cheap.  I bought mine ten years ago for 1/4 current price.  Still have several rolls if I live long enough, LOL&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my favorite shower brush.  Stiffer bristles are hard on your skin and dries it out.  The Yerba is nice this is preferred.  Skin is delicate no matter how tough you are, LOL</li>
    <li> I have used a lot of bath brushes and this is the best. Soft, perfect length worth 10 stars.</li>
    <li> I purchased this brush to replace a bath brush that was too hard.  Because it was advertised as soft, I thought it would be perfect since my old brush was scratching my skin it was so hard.  It turns out this brush is not just soft, it&#x27;s too soft.  I don&#x27;t see how anyone can use it.  the bristles are spaced too far apart and they are really, really soft.  they are a little like those little baby brushes.  Yes, that soft.  you may like that soft of a brush, but in my case it went too far on the soft side.</li>
    <li> good for dry-brushing skin before showering. the bristles are natural which is healthier for my skin.</li>
    <li> Bristles were a bit softer than I expected, but good overall.</li>
    <li> This thing is awesome. You feel much better after using this in the shower - you can feel your pores opening up and it&#x27;s not too bristly or rough.</li>
    <li> Folks - This is the one you&#x27;ve been looking for!  The bamboo handle is sturdy and the bristles are so soft right from the start.  For years I&#x27;ve been using the plastic handled brushes from Bed Bath and Beyond and, in time, the handle snaps, and the bristles are hard and need to soften over time.  Not with this brush!  I seriously thought of buying a second and storing it away for years from now when this one bites the dust, just in case they weren&#x27;t manufacturing it in years to come.  Why don&#x27;t other brush makers make a brush like this?  Well anyway - this is the real deal and I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;d be disappointment.</li>
    <li> I chose this brush because it is a single, long length of wood brush.  I have had many plastic handle, one piece brushes that have broken due to dropping them or just adding a little extra pressure when scrubbing my back.  So far this one is holding together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros :) Long wooden handle - 18.5 inches&lt;br /&gt;Cons :(  It gets a three star rating due to the bristles being 3/4 inch long and they are very soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Three stars or other I&#x27;ll use this brush until the bristle fall off because I don&#x27;t expect it to break.</li>
    <li> Bristles are a bit soft for my taste, but the long handle is very useful and it lasts a long time in the humid shower.</li>
    <li> Decent quality; only a few months in use wise. Quality for the price</li>
    <li> Works well. Is holding up well. Love the long handle.</li>
    <li> Got mildewed very quickly</li>
    <li> The brush is very soft, almost too soft.  It would help if the same bristles of this brush were a little longer, or at least more dense.</li>
    <li> The bristles are soft but clean the skin thoroughly and the handle makes it easy for T-Rex-armed people like me to scrub every inch of their back. The bristles can fall off but not quickly.</li>
    <li> I needed to use a dry brush detoxification technique while participating in a 21 day program.  I will continue to use after completing the diet.</li>
    <li> Soft and easy to hold</li>
    <li> I like the bamboo material, the length is good, but the bristles are QUITE soft. I want to do some actual scrubbing, not just tickle myself. Whoever designed the packaging apparently didn&#x27;t consider whether or not the long piece of transparent cellophane tape securing the plastic cover over the bristles would leave a swatch of adhesive behind once removed. Oops. So that wasn&#x27;t exactly stellar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s too cheap to bother returning, but I&#x27;ll shop for a real bath brush in meatspace rather than relying on photos on the web this time around.</li>
    <li> We have always had firmer, harder brushes and I actually prefer the firmer brushes but this one is nice and soft and good for some uses. If you like soft, then this brush is for you as it is a very nice product. We will probably go back to the firmer one next time.</li>
    <li> Very solid construction; I like that it is one solid piece of wood. Previous brushes are two part and end up coming apart. The bristles are nice as well! Definitely would buy again!</li>
    <li> Very nice brush it has a long handle of real wood.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bristles are about right: not too soft or too hard, though they feel very soft to the touch of my fingers, they feel about right to my back.  Don&#x27;t be fooled by the gorillas who say its too soft - they probably prefer a tree tunk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What else can I say? I&#x27;ve had it for a couple months now and I LIKE IT!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;MK</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a nice weight, the handle is long enough and it&#x27;s attractive. My only criticism is that the brush is very, very soft; not as firm as would be desired for a back brush.</li>
    <li> A well made back scrubber, but it is just too soft for my taste. Other than that, it is an excellent back scrubber.</li>
    <li> Bristles are very soft.</li>
    <li> Other reviewers mentioned the hemp rope getting worn out, this has not been an issue for me.  The handle is comfortable to hold, dries quickly after use, and is just the right size.  The bristles are soft but firm enough for a good brushing.  Would buy again!</li>
    <li> Soft enough to be comfortable, long enough to reach the middle of your back easily. Good product for daily use.</li>
    <li> The brush has very soft bristles.  If it a good scrub you want choose another brush.</li>
    <li> It does the job OK but needs to be less bulky or lighter to move around comfortably. Good for the money.</li>
    <li> I was hoping for a good invigorating scrub, but this is more like a baby&#x27;s hair brush.  The bristles are short and soft, the handle is awkwardly wide and flat.  It is nicely made, and I appreciate that it&#x27;s made of sustainable materials.  They could improve the design.  It makes a nice (long-handled) face brush though!</li>
    <li> Had this brush a year ago &amp; it was wonderful. It was time for a replacement but it isn&#x27;t the same. Has gotten way softer. Bristles fold up under pressure. Works up a fine lather but couldn&#x27;t scratch an itch. I like a more skin stimulating brush and this isn&#x27;t it. just ordered up a different brand to try.</li>
    <li> Bamboo brush is just right for me. I cannot tolerate the harsher, stiffer brushes.  The wood on handle smells great.&lt;br /&gt;Item is as it described.  Arrived earlier than expected/within 1 day.  Great service!</li>
