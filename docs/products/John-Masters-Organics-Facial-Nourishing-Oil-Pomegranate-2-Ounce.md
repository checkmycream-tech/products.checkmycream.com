      <li>My entire face feels smooth and perfectly hydrated.</li>
      <li>So far I&#x27;m very pleased with it!</li>
      <li>Great oil, very moisturizing and full of antioxidents.</li>
      <li>The oil works well, and my face looks more radiant with smooth pores.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>The smell is so relaxing and refreshing, it is a treat to smooth it on my face before bedtime.</li>
      <li>This one does only good things for me!  </li>
      <li>It does have an herbal smell, but other than that works great!</li>
      <li>Smells like fresh herbs, goes on smoothly and absorbs nicely.</li>
      <li>I primarily use it on my face, but I&#x27;ve used some on my legs and hands as well.</li>
      <li>Works fantastic in both climates.</li>
      <li>I pair it with a light sunscreen and don&#x27;t need anything else.</li>
      <li>oil smells great and is relatively light-weight.</li>
      <li>I enjoy this \\&quot;energizing\\</li>
      <li>It felt heavenly as I applied it to my face and neck and my complexion just drank it up and looked more supple right afterwards.</li>
      <li>As a make-up artist and person who moisturizes regularly, I&#x27;m more aware of what my skin needs.  </li>
      <li>This oil is awesome and I will continue to use it even though it is a little pricey, it is worth the splurge.</li>
      <li>John Masters products are CLEAN so you don&#x27;t have to worry about any junk seeping into your pores and bloodstream.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m 36, white, and have used this while I lived San Diego which is near perfect weather</li>
      <li>It even made the serum, which smells like artichokes, smell sweet.</li>
      <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also be sure to check around about the price; some sellers here are really jacking up the price, so check the John Masters website to make sure that you&#x27;re not paying too much.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll stick with good ol&#x27; coconut oil for the future.</li>
      <li>The smell is not overpowering, it is rather mild and floral.  </li>
      <li>Excellent and long lasting.</li>
      <li>I HIGHLY RECOMMEND this facial oil because the smell is amazing!</li>
      <li>I love how this glides on and gives me a natural glow, with or without make-up.</li>
      <li>(The other product I use which is equally significant is a citrus toner created by &amp;#34;Lather&amp;#34;  which I transfer into a misting bottle and when I have more of a day at home, I give my skin a good misting several times a day</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m delighted I gave up all the other junk.  </li>
      <li>and the right amount of humidity.</li>
      <li>that&#x27;s just not appealing, but let&#x27;s just say I have to fight not to be constantly touching my own</li>
      <li>I also find that it gives my skin a slight, pleasant tingling sensation, as if blood flow is increased.</li>
      <li>Love the smell and my skin looks terrific!</li>
      <li>If I don&#x27;t find anything better, I&#x27;d definitely come back to this :)</li>
      <li>so just make sure you tie your hair back until it seeps into your skin.</li>
      <li>First time I use it</li>
      <li>I bought this oil because I was interested in the organic quality of the moisturizer.</li>
      <li>My skin did not respond well the first time when I used this oil.</li>
      <li>(The JM website also offers free shipping.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>also have sensitive skin that is easily irritated and have been dealing with an ongoing bout of perioral dermatitis, but this didn&#x27;t cause any inflammation; in fact, it is very soothing and moisturizing.&lt;br</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not fast absorbing, but I kind of like that about it.</li>
      <li>Nice aromatherapy scented oil but not worth the money.  </li>
      <li>I love how the oil moisturizes and am amazed that I don&#x27;t feel like my skin is oily, where normally if I use a facial lotion in the evening I&#x27;ll see a sheen of oil on my face by bedtime.</li>
      <li>I have purchased this facial oil before and been happy with it, but this time the oil seemed to be watered down.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;UPDATE ON 2-23-14:  I&#x27;ve been using this for a few months now, and continue to love it!  </li>
      <li>The fine lines are almost gone as well as the deep lines on my neck and chest.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m 34 and am starting to see fine lines around my eyes and cheeks at rest</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t notice it as much anymore</li>
      <li>Later, I mix a few drops of Calendula Oil from Melvita with this John Master Organics oil (3 drops of calendula oil and 3 drops of JMO Pomegrante facial oil), it yields perfect results on my skin.</li>
      <li>and I really look forward to putting it on before bed.</li>
      <li>BUT I tend to use too much product</li>
      <li>really like this oil.  </li>
      <li>An esthetician friend recommended it and I&#x27;ve been really ha</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very herbal, like rosemary, thyme, etc.</li>
      <li>and I think it&#x27;s useful to mist both under and over the oil as well - yet another essential oil product that my skin just soaks right up.)  </li>
      <li>Within a day, my skin was back to normal, and now (a couple weeks later), it&#x27;s looking better than ever!</li>
      <li>Having working in beauty care I am aware that certain fill size products are marked and the boxes are initialed to be used as testers.</li>
      <li>I have not spent much time or money on facial products, but with age, this has become more important.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Great oil, very moisturizing and full of antioxidents. It does have an herbal smell, but other than that works great!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried several (at least 6) different essential oils on my face.  Everything from Makeup company brands to a few I&#x27;ve bought here on Amazon.  I wanted to find something less expensive but this one is the ticket.  No breakouts, and while it goes on thick, it does sink in well.  Some others kind of sit on the skin and feel greasy.  This is thick, so I&#x27;d dab it all over and lightly of pat it on.  It does have a noticeable scent.  I don&#x27;t mind it, kind of feels like the aromatherapy part of my skin care routine. I&#x27;m 36, white, and have used this while I lived San Diego which is near perfect weather and the right amount of humidity. I&#x27;m now on the east coast where the dryness from heating the house and the cold, dry wind was causing an issue.  Works fantastic in both climates. I put it on before my spf or moisterizer with SPF.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m male, in my early 30s, with combination, olive-toned skin that isn&#x27;t sensitive or acne prone. This was set to be my last try with JM products as the first two were extremely over-rated! This oil is great whether you&#x27;re dry/sensitive or combination.  Pro: 0 reactions, sinks into skin, safe around my extremely sensitive eyes, mixes fine with other product, ingredients  Moderate: I&#x27;m pulling mainly lavendar from scent, price   Con: dropper is a bit sloppy/drips, no instruction on how much product to use, glass bottle makes it bad to travel with (though it would be nice on an overnight or international flight)  I would definitely recommend this oil to anyone for use anywhere on the body but don&#x27;t expect to see noticable results. It&#x27;s a great product for long-term use. I use about 12 drops for my face and neck BUT I tend to use too much product so 5 drop will likely be sufficient resulting in the 2 oz bottle lasting quite awhile.</li>
    <li> I bought this oil because I was interested in the organic quality of the moisturizer. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND this facial oil because the smell is amazing! It is aromatherapy - period! The smell is so relaxing and refreshing, it is a treat to smooth it on my face before bedtime. I will definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 58 and trying to use organic ingredients on my skin and I&#x27;ve been oily in the past but drier now. This  is the most wonderful treatment. It smells great, I rub it all over my face at night, its absorbs  nicely and my skin looks great in the am. I didn&#x27;t think I could use an oil on my face but this stuff  is awesome, a real treat and not expensive! You won&#x27;t regret using this.</li>
    <li> I have aging, sensitive skin with Rosacea.  I use organic oils exclusively on my face, switching them up depending on the season and the condition of my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like this oil.  It leaves my skin soft and toned, it absorbs well over night.  A little goes a long way.  The smell is not overpowering, it is rather mild and floral.  It is a great product for daily moisturizing, at a great price point. And it&#x27;s organic!  It works well for my skin.</li>
    <li> love it, i use it everywhere, even my hair.</li>
    <li> We have gone through 2 bottles of this facial oil this winter and it has saved our skin.  As a make-up artist and person who moisturizes regularly, I&#x27;m more aware of what my skin needs.  However, even my husband and 5 year old recognize their need for this oil and they actually love it.  I&#x27;m grateful that I&#x27;ve found something that they will use.</li>
    <li> I switched toners and my skin went into disaster mode. Dry flaky patches everywhere. It was so thirsty and desperate for TLC! My regular moisturizers were not cutting it, so I decided to pick up a bottle of John Masters Pomegranate facial oil at the Vitamin Shoppe (I hate that spelling of \\&quot;shop,\\&quot; btw). This product is amazing! Within a day, my skin was back to normal, and now (a couple weeks later), it&#x27;s looking better than ever! The softness this facial oil instills cannot be described. I won&#x27;t say baby&#x27;s butt, bcs that&#x27;s just not appealing, but let&#x27;s just say I have to fight not to be constantly touching my own face!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it once a day, before bed (although I was using it twice when I was very dry), and just a few drops go a long way! Usually I overdo it with about 6 drops, but i just rub the excess into my throat or even on my shoulders a little.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is amazing, but some people might not like it. It&#x27;s very herbal, like rosemary, thyme, etc. I thought it might smell a little fruity from the pomegranate, but not so. However, I personally love the smell and I swear it&#x27;s been helping me fall asleep at night!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the price, this is an amazing product. Whether you&#x27;re thinking about getting a facial oil for the first time, or if you&#x27;ve been using them all along, I highly recommend John Masters!</li>
    <li> I have purchased this facial oil before and been happy with it, but this time the oil seemed to be watered down.  When I pull the dropper out of the bottle the oil just runs out of the dropper making it impossible to get the oil onto my finger before losing several drops on the counter.  I contacted John Masters Organics and after a lengthy wait Customer Service replied that nothing in the formula had changed.  I wrote back explaining my experience and the differences, but never again heard from the company.  Very poor customer service on a very runny product which has definitely changed from what it used to be.</li>
    <li> I just turned 50, I am out in the sun quite a bit and this is one of only two things I purchase for my face.  The third thing I use is a little baking soda to lightly scrub once or twice a week.  My age is typically guessed late 30&#x27;s and although I could care less really about age in general and there are surely other lifestyle elements and attitudinal as well that play a vital role, I simply state the age reference because it helps to convey my experience with this product.  (The other product I use which is equally significant is a citrus toner created by &amp;#34;Lather&amp;#34;  which I transfer into a misting bottle and when I have more of a day at home, I give my skin a good misting several times a day and I think it&#x27;s useful to mist both under and over the oil as well - yet another essential oil product that my skin just soaks right up.)  I have tried a couple other essential oil moisturizers but they make me break out.  This one does only good things for me!  Oh, and a bottle lasts about 4 months minimum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although it has pomegranate in the title, it smells of lavender which I love.  I don&#x27;t know why there are two versions on Amazon, one which is is priced at $43 and this one at $27-ish?  One day soon I will purchase an extra bottle and do an oil treatment for my hair as well!</li>
    <li> My skin did not respond well the first time when I used this oil. Later, I mix a few drops of Calendula Oil from Melvita with this John Master Organics oil (3 drops of calendula oil and 3 drops of JMO Pomegrante facial oil), it yields perfect results on my skin. The oil works well, and my face looks more radiant with smooth pores.&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend to mix this product with Calendula oil.</li>
    <li> I bought this because of the reviews, but it is not that good for me. it is just okay .</li>
    <li> Nice aromatherapy scented oil but not worth the money.  Gimmicky dropper for the oil.  I&#x27;ll stick with good ol&#x27; coconut oil for the future.</li>
    <li> Smells like fresh herbs, goes on smoothly and absorbs nicely. I usually put on at night because its a bit heavy for my skin type during the day.</li>
    <li> I have used this for years and clearly JM has changed the ingredients without telling us.  It smells different, feels different and doesn&#x27;t work as well.  Too bad.</li>
    <li> I like John Masters line and this oil keeps my skin moisturized beneath my moisturizer.  Will order more products in this line.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this oil. My face feels like a baby face! My skin is average I do suffer from slight congestion. I love how this glides on and gives me a natural glow, with or without make-up. A little goes a long way. John Masters products are CLEAN so you don&#x27;t have to worry about any junk seeping into your pores and bloodstream. This oil is awesome and I will continue to use it even though it is a little pricey, it is worth the splurge. Be careful around your hairline it will make your hair greasy if it gets in your hair so just make sure you tie your hair back until it seeps into your skin.</li>
    <li> I love this product. The bottle i received was marked tester as was the box. Having working in beauty care I am aware that certain fill size products are marked and the boxes are initialed to be used as testers. The box was also initialed by hand. I have no way of knowing if it was used or not. Testers are not meant for resale.</li>
    <li> Big bottle - it&#x27;s glass, so traveling with it may prove difficult, but I imagine it will last a long time. A little goes a long way and you have to get used to the herbal smell, but it really does revive dry skin. I primarily use it on my face, but I&#x27;ve used some on my legs and hands as well. So far I&#x27;m very pleased with it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using John Masters Organic facial oils for years - that should say a lot right there. It&#x27;s my go-to facial moisturizer. I don&#x27;t even bother using other products. Can&#x27;t be beat.</li>
    <li> I have tried several kinds of oils for my sensitive skin (face, neck, hands).  I have paid prices ranging from dollar store to \\&quot;insane\\&quot;.  This one is the one I have come back to.  I like products that absorb completely, and this one really does.    Even when I over-do the amount I use, I go to sleep (on my back) and when I wake up my face is luxuriously soft and clean feeling.  I never expected this from an oil.    I started getting glowing comments about my face when I changed my entire facial line to Cosmetic Skin Solutions C+E Fer., Cosmetic Skin Solutions B5 gel, and this oil after it at night and sometimes in the morning.  I&#x27;m delighted I gave up all the other junk.  (Facial cleansers don&#x27;t count, here, and obviously in Arizona I wear SUNSCREEN.)</li>
    <li> started using this a couple of weeks ago.&lt;br /&gt;what a difference it has made!&lt;br /&gt;its not greasy and feels good on the face.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m committed to this product now! I&#x27;ve bought and used two bottles. A bottle lasts a long time and is wonderful for my skin without being greasy. I pair it with a light sunscreen and don&#x27;t need anything else. An esthetician friend recommended it and I&#x27;ve been really ha</li>
    <li> Works as described. Love the nice clean scent and pom yumminess...It arrived as promised. Would order again. ++++ Thank you!</li>
    <li> Excellent, prompt service.</li>
    <li> I have not spent much time or money on facial products, but with age, this has become more important.&lt;br /&gt;I love the feel and will be purchasing again.</li>
    <li> After reading reviews for facial oils I wanted to give them a try. I&#x27;d read that pomegranate helps with pores, scaring and wrinkles. And so far so good! I love how the oil moisturizes and am amazed that I don&#x27;t feel like my skin is oily, where normally if I use a facial lotion in the evening I&#x27;ll see a sheen of oil on my face by bedtime. My skin just loves this and seems to be balancing out. The smell is lovely, not overwhelming and seems to fade quickly, so don&#x27;t let that hold you back from trying this oil. And the bottle is going to last a very long time since you use so little each time, about 5 little drops.</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome! I use it every night. First time I use it the next morning it felt like my skin was totally different – a lot smoother and healthier. I don&#x27;t notice it as much anymore probably because I&#x27;m used to it LOL</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this product!  I read another review that called it &amp;#34;aromatherapy&amp;#34; and it&#x27;s very accurate.  I find the smell relaxing and I really look forward to putting it on before bed. It&#x27;s not fast absorbing, but I kind of like that about it. That said, I like BIG moisturizers--I like the feel of thick lotion or oil as a PM moisturizer so if you are someone who doesn&#x27;t want to feel anything on your face, this is not the product for you.  I have moderately sensitive/rosacea prone skin and haven&#x27;t had any issues with this product (I&#x27;ve been using it nightly for 15 months).  I only gave it 3 stars b/c it did nothing to improve the appearance of my skin (wrinkles, skin tone evenness, etc...).  I&#x27;m 34 and am starting to see fine lines around my eyes and cheeks at rest so I&#x27;m currently searching for products that will address those issues.  If I don&#x27;t find anything better, I&#x27;d definitely come back to this :)</li>
    <li> The dry winter weather has been killing my skin and hair, so I recently ordered a bunch of John Masters products since I want to move to using more organic products.  I have used one or two items in their product line in the past and was impressed, so ordered this oil, along with a few other items.  I love this!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve only used it a couple of days, but I&#x27;ve been applying it either when I get home from work and wash off my makeup or before bed.  You just need a few drops to cover your face and neck, and you will wake up with soft skin that glows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also ordered the [[ASIN:B00401T8PI John Masters Organics - Linden Blossom Face Creme Cleanser, 4 fl oz cream]] cleanser, and the combo has been perfect for my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also have sensitive skin that is easily irritated and have been dealing with an ongoing bout of perioral dermatitis, but this didn&#x27;t cause any inflammation; in fact, it is very soothing and moisturizing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also be sure to check around about the price; some sellers here are really jacking up the price, so check the John Masters website to make sure that you&#x27;re not paying too much.  (The JM website also offers free shipping.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE ON 2-23-14:  I&#x27;ve been using this for a few months now, and continue to love it!  In San Diego, we have really dry winters since we&#x27;re basically in a desert, and this has made a world of difference to my skin.  It is soft and supple, with no dry patches.  I love the smell!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, a few older reviews mentioned that the dropper is messy, but they must have re-designed it since it is very easy to use, and doesn&#x27;t drip or make a mess when you first pull the dropper out of the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is really a fantastic product!</li>
    <li> Needed a good moisturizer for my face because I wasn&#x27;t seeing results from JMO&#x27;s vitamin C anti-aging serum, so I tried this product. I actually mixed two drops with that other product I had (VC serum) and WoW! Immediately I saw results! It felt heavenly as I applied it to my face and neck and my complexion just drank it up and looked more supple right afterwards. It even made the serum, which smells like artichokes, smell sweet. Now on day two I have noticed a clearer complexion and an added bonus - the darkness under my eyes is fading away! Even my freckly sunspots are almost gone and I look at least 5 years younger! The fine lines are almost gone as well as the deep lines on my neck and chest. I don&#x27;t know if it is the combination of the two or if it is just the Pom Face Nourisher but I look forward to see even more benefits as I continue using this miraculous oil from an incredible company ~ John Masters Organics!</li>
    <li> Smells great00that&#x27;s my favorite part. Works pretty well, and my sensitive skin tolerates this oil.</li>
    <li> Love this product. Use it everyday. However there seems to be a seller trying to sell it for $1000. Its expensive but more like $40 a bottle. $1000 is a major rip off and a scam. Do not buy for that price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Besides that, love this face oil.</li>
    <li> Great moisturizer. My everyday go to product. Excellent and long lasting.</li>
    <li> This is my second bottle that I&#x27;ve used.  Love the smell and my skin looks terrific!</li>
    <li> Crossing over into middle age means a lot of changes and that includes my skin. It used to be combination and is now mostly on the drier side with especially dry patches on both cheeks. For the past year and a half I had been using Kiehl&#x27;s Midnight Recovery complex and liked it OK. But when that bottle was empty, I decided to change it up and order John Masters Pomegranate Facial Oil. I am glad I did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This oil smells great and is relatively light-weight. The dropper&#x27;s opening is a bit large though and one has to be quite careful to not accidentally release product when taking the dropper out of the bottle. The oil itself goes on easily and absorbs well - a few drops is all that&#x27;s needed (I&#x27;d say 5 is plenty). I also find that it gives my skin a slight, pleasant tingling sensation, as if blood flow is increased. Apparently this is due to the geranium oil. I enjoy this \\&quot;energizing\\&quot; feeling but it might not be the right product for people with broken capillaries - just thought I&#x27;d mention this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I like best about this oil is a) the wonderful scent and b) that for the first time ever these dry spots on my cheeks have disappeared. Kiehl&#x27;s Midnight Recovery Complex never achieved this nor any other serum that I had bought in the past. My entire face feels smooth and perfectly hydrated. I am quite impressed and will definitely buy this again.</li>
