      <li>I just LOVE it!</li>
      <li>Love the color!</li>
      <li>This is my favorite blush!</li>
      <li>Love the color, the smell, the package!</li>
      <li>I love it!</li>
      <li>There are so many things I love about Benefits Cosmetics Dallas!</li>
      <li>I love the box it comes in because none gets wasted…whatever doesn&#x27;t get loaded on the brush</li>
      <li>I also recommend Hoolla blush if you want it to be more tanner than this.</li>
      <li>It has been my go to bronzer for many years.</li>
      <li>I do love Benefit blushes</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure it would work well for those looking for a darker mauvey brown tinted bronzer.  </li>
      <li>Okay, maybe not ALL over.  </li>
      <li>I would not recommend this product,  the original is tons better</li>
      <li>Perfect for fair skin, blonde hair, blue eyes</li>
      <li>Pretty light rose scent..</li>
      <li>Hence why its cheap</li>
      <li>Fast shipping for someone at an FPO address in Japan, works lovely for those with light skin!</li>
      <li>I especially love the cool little brush that comes with it.  </li>
      <li>This is a perfect and subtle bronzer.</li>
      <li>easy to use and fast for a quick touch</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t have a sparkle to it, so it makes for a great everyday bronzer.  </li>
      <li>It is worth the splurge.</li>
      <li>have tried others but believe this one is the most natural looking.</li>
      <li>I was watching her put on everything with a handheld mirror, and right after she put this on</li>
      <li>First she put foundation primer</li>
      <li>I first had this put on me at a Benefit counter at Macy&#x27;s.</li>
      <li>Makes you feel pretty.</li>
      <li>For some strange reason, this particular color/formula is not like the others I own.  </li>
      <li>On a busy day, I can swipe some on with a quick coat of mascara</li>
      <li>I went anout enjoying my other products that came today.</li>
      <li>My skin type is normal so there&#x27;s no oil breakthrough, which is why some makeup oxidizes (changes to a darker color) for those with oilier skin types.</li>
      <li>I told the girl that did my makeup that I wanted an \\&quot;Everyday Look\\&quot;, that was easy for me to do and didn&#x27;t take much.</li>
      <li>a Mac Nc25)&lt;br /&gt;Coralista- is too pink for my skin, I think it would look good on you if you have VERY pale</li>
      <li>I had high hopes for this color because I&#x27;ve been searching high and low for a bronzer that will work for me.  </li>
      <li>Generally, Benefit blushes</li>
      <li>I have a favorite orange Benefit blush that has since been discontinued, and I&#x27;m heartsick about it and am trying very hard to conserve what I have left.  </li>
      <li>I have received my order today, it&#x27;s not a real Dallas benefit blush, the box is totally different from the original and the color is not exactly the same.</li>

<li> /&gt;Another thing I see is that it doesn&#x27;t last long, I had  to retouch it</li>
<li> So I&#x27;m baffled as to why this happened with this Benefit blush, which when you look at it, has absolutely no orange to it at all.  </li>
<li> but this item is not a real benefit product!</li>

<li> My face transformed into dull and tired to sunkissed and lively!</li>
<li> have been using this product for a few years.</li>
<li> I don&#x27;t know if my body chemistry reacted with the ingredients or whether the ingredients and pigments have some orange undertone that shows up after a few hours of wear.  </li>
<li> Wow, this product is fake.</li>
<li> I am not sure which I recieved today..</li>
<li> I dont usually write reviews and that says alot.</li>
<li> Its fake.</li>
<li> But I have nothing bad to say about the seller.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Great for contouring.</li>
    <li> Love the color, the smell, the package! it&#x27;s really nice! the brush is beautiful but doesn&#x27;t work! the hair falls all over your face!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another thing I see is that it doesn&#x27;t last long, I had  to retouch it several times&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tomorrow I&#x27;m trying it with the Make Up Forever Mist &amp; Fix to see if it stays longer</li>
    <li> I first had this put on me at a Benefit counter at Macy&#x27;s. I told the girl that did my makeup that I wanted an \\&quot;Everyday Look\\&quot;, that was easy for me to do and didn&#x27;t take much. First she put foundation primer, then Some Kind of Gorgeous, a then Dallas. I was watching her put on everything with a handheld mirror, and right after she put this on I was hooked! My face transformed into dull and tired to sunkissed and lively! I have medium skin and this perfect for me. It gives just the perfect amount of \\&quot;glow\\&quot; to your face with a touch of \\&quot;rosey-ness\\&quot;. I just LOVE it! And it lasts FOREVER!</li>
    <li> There are so many things I love about Benefits Cosmetics Dallas! I love the box it comes in because none gets wasted…whatever doesn&#x27;t get loaded on the brush falls back in the box! The brush is great. It is the perfect shape for contouring and giving me razor-sharp cheekbones. The color is wonderful, and I can&#x27;t help but believe it would look beautiful on most people. It lasts all day with no need for touch-ups. This is one of the BEST BRONZERS I have found, and I am sticking with it!</li>
    <li> Not legit. Pirate immitation! Not benefit products. Its fake. I would not recommend this product,  the original is tons better but this item is not a real benefit product! Hence why its cheap</li>
    <li> Love the color! Perfect for fair skin, blonde hair, blue eyes</li>
    <li> This is a plummy brown blush that can be used as a bronzer.  However, for whatever reason, it turned orange on me.  I don&#x27;t know if my body chemistry reacted with the ingredients or whether the ingredients and pigments have some orange undertone that shows up after a few hours of wear.  I had high hopes for this color because I&#x27;ve been searching high and low for a bronzer that will work for me.  My skin type is normal so there&#x27;s no oil breakthrough, which is why some makeup oxidizes (changes to a darker color) for those with oilier skin types. So I&#x27;m baffled as to why this happened with this Benefit blush, which when you look at it, has absolutely no orange to it at all.  It&#x27;s a mystery.  However, it did happen, so I returned this blush to Ulta.  I do love Benefit blushes and I have several that I use regularly.  I especially love the cool little brush that comes with it.  I have a favorite orange Benefit blush that has since been discontinued, and I&#x27;m heartsick about it and am trying very hard to conserve what I have left.  Generally, Benefit blushes wear well all day, don&#x27;t change color and don&#x27;t need to reapplied throughout the day.  For some strange reason, this particular color/formula is not like the others I own.  I&#x27;m sure it would work well for those looking for a darker mauvey brown tinted bronzer.  It just didn&#x27;t work for me.  Still, I&#x27;m giving it three stars because my experience with Benefit blush has overall, been good.  This one is just an anomaly.</li>
    <li> This is one of my favorite bronzers! Very easy to apply to achieve that luminous glow! Plus it smells good! :)</li>
    <li> Dallas- The benefit lady at the counter showed me how to use this for conturing, bronzing and eye shadow.&lt;br /&gt;Its easy to use and fast for a quick touch up.&lt;br /&gt;(Im a Mac Nc25)&lt;br /&gt;Coralista- is too pink for my skin, I think it would look good on you if you have VERY pale skin.&lt;br /&gt;Im fair and my foundation+ powder leaves me tinted.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping for someone at an FPO address in Japan, works lovely for those with light skin!</li>
    <li> have been using this product for a few years. have tried others but believe this one is the most natural looking.</li>
    <li> I ordered the Hoola and Dallas from different sellers.. I am not sure which I recieved today.. I am too caught up in my disappointment with Benefit cosmetics, to charge so much for a small box with msybe 1/4 -1/3 of it only product. Shame on them. I put it down and didn&#x27;t even try it, so I can&#x27;t even say I like the product or not. I went anout enjoying my other products that came today. But I have nothing bad to say about the seller. They have done their job, and speedy delivery!!</li>
    <li> My favorite, it&#x27;s the perfect color for all skin color it works as a blush and a bronzer</li>
    <li> Arrived in a timely manner...but... for me, so not worth the price.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t fall for the hype.</li>
    <li> I loved this blush! It is perfect! A hint of color with great taste. Makes you feel pretty. I would definitely purchase this blush again and again. I also recommend Hoolla blush if you want it to be more tanner than this. Both are amazing!</li>
    <li> This is my favorite blush!</li>
    <li> I have received my order today, it&#x27;s not a real Dallas benefit blush, the box is totally different from the original and the color is not exactly the same. Don&#x27;t buy from this seller.</li>
    <li> This is a perfect and subtle bronzer. It has been my go to bronzer for many years. It is worth the splurge. It also has a pretty shimmer to it so it would be great for contouring! Added bonus.. Pretty light rose scent.. I love it!</li>
    <li> I use this ALL over my face, 365 days a year.  Okay, maybe not ALL over.  I use it to highlight the \\&quot;sun-kissed\\&quot; areas....or the areas that SHOULD be sun-kissed, anyways.  It doesn&#x27;t have a sparkle to it, so it makes for a great everyday bronzer.  On a busy day, I can swipe some on with a quick coat of mascara and I&#x27;m out the door (with a lip gloss in my bag of course)!</li>
    <li> Great bronzer for all skin colors!!! Love it!!</li>
    <li> Wow, this product is fake. I dont usually write reviews and that says alot.</li>
