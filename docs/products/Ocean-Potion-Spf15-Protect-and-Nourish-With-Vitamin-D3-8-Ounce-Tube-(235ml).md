      <li>I am a fair skinned gal, who burns easily.</li>
      <li>Most importantly, it is an effective sun block lotion</li>
      <li>We love this product because of the lack of scent.  </li>
      <li>What more</li>
      <li>I love this sunscreen...</li>

      <li>ok price (when you add in shipping) but love this product.  </li>
      <li>Love this stuff.</li>
      <li>I love all of the Ocean Potion products.</li>
      <li>Love the scent....</li>
      <li>Many people, suck as me, the kids , and many others can&#x27;t used most sunblocks because it irritates their skin, causing redness and burning.</li>
      <li>Not here, a most gentle and very effective product.</li>
      <li>This stuff smells good, wipes in easy, and dries quick.  </li>
      <li>Bought this once because it was on sale, best find in a long time.</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s still pretty good.</li>
      <li>Not greasy with a nice mild fragrance.</li>
      <li>First of all look at the volumes of ingredients in most sunblocks !</li>

      <li>but the product is the same, it works great.</li>
      <li>The price was right, and I was able to get the aloe lotion as well and it arrived within days...</li>
      <li>I was already familiar with this product.  </li>
      <li>One of the few Oxybenzone free lotions, goes on smooth, not greasy, easy to wash off, and the perfect combo of still being able to get a little color while protecting yourself.</li>
      <li>Arrived quickly.</li>
      <li>I love this sunscreen and have not been able to find it in my local stores.  </li>
      <li>I am happy to have found this product, it contains additional Vitamin D; is not greasy; and although it has a fragrance, it does not carry the typical sunscreen odor.</li>
      <li>I also have very sensitive skin, so most sunscreen burns when I put it on.</li>
      <li>Suggest you get some fresh stock.</li>
      <li>This is by far our favorite lotion.</li>
      <li>This product is great, but not easy to find.</li>
      <li>It soaks in quickly, doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy feeling, and absolutely works.  </li>
      <li>I have only used the SPF 15 lotion but absolutely love it.  </li>
      <li>Receive in a timely fashion and exactly what I wanted.  </li>
      <li>My first couple oft times in the sun for the season</li>
      <li>I have found it consistently in Rite Aid.  </li>
      <li>It would be nice if it was offered in other stores.  </li>
      <li>Ocean Potion, smells great (a very subtle orange creamsicle scent), absorbs quickly and keeps me from burning.</li>
      <li>The Ocean Potion suncare products are by far the best - but they&#x27;re hard to find locally.  </li>
      <li>Ocean Potion is great stuff all the way round, Wish I could buy the SPF 15 locally</li>
      <li>We really like this sunscreen, but when it is gone from the stores it&#x27;s gone.</li>
      <li>and it works very well for us.</li>
      <li>fast shipment, product as described.</li>
      <li>formula is light and pleasant, unlike most sunscreens (which often are thick and oily, and unnecessarily smelly).</li>
      <li>It rubs in quickly and smells terrific!</li>
      <li>Ocean potion has been the first (and only) sunscreen that I have used that works and doesn&#x27;t burn.</li>
      <li>Bought my first bottle in Anguilla and cannot find it in stores locally</li>
      <li>Hard to find in R. I. Love the smell and non greasy feel</li>
      <li>It goes on smoothly and is not too heavy</li>
      <li>The skin on my face is as soft as ever.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I discovered Ocean Potion when I was canvassing door-to-door in the hot sun for all day long.  </li>
      <li>Additional benny, it smells like the old Dreamcicles (ice cream bar)</li>
      <li>I was surprised that it was advertised as an 8 ounce tube</li>
      <li>It smells better than any other!!!!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> This is now my brand of choice for sunscreen.  I use 50, 30, and 15 depending on the day.  It soaks in quickly, doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy feeling, and absolutely works.  I&#x27;m fair skinned but can tan some and the 15 is great to allow some sun, but keep me from burning.  The 30 and 50 are basically like wearing clothes.  Seriously, Ocean Potion deserves two thumbs up.</li>
    <li> I have red hair and freckles and have burned all my life. I also have very sensitive skin, so most sunscreen burns when I put it on. Ocean potion has been the first (and only) sunscreen that I have used that works and doesn&#x27;t burn. Plus, it smells great!</li>
    <li> I discovered Ocean Potion when I was canvassing door-to-door in the hot sun for all day long.  It is the only sunscreen product that prevents red blotches from appearing on my lower legs.  I will never use any other product for sun protection.  It soaks into my skin and moisturizes, rather than leaving me feeling greasy.  I use the Broad Spectrum sunblock 30 anti-aging.  It is rather hard to find in the Portland, OR area.  I have found it consistently in Rite Aid.  It would be nice if it was offered in other stores.  Probably would expand the market, I should think.  Thank you for making this wonderful product and keep up the good work!</li>
    <li> Ocean Potion is great stuff all the way round, Wish I could buy the SPF 15 locally</li>
    <li> This sunscreen is so nice and non greasy.  The bonus is it&#x27;s wonderful scent.  People always want to know what it is when they smell it.</li>
    <li> Leaves a white film on skin after you go in the water.</li>
    <li> Drs in Florida suggest this is the best lotion you can use!  It keeps out more of unwanted rays!</li>
    <li> great production but still allows you to tan. smells delicious... like a creamsicle!!</li>
    <li> I generally prefer spray sunscreens - but it can be hard to find an SPF 15.  This stuff smells good, wipes in easy, and dries quick.  It will run/re-emerge if you get wet/sweat a lot - but it&#x27;s still pretty good.</li>
    <li> Great sunblock.  Not greasy with a nice mild fragrance.</li>
    <li> Non sticky and good scent, protects will.</li>
    <li> I was already familiar with this product.  I was surprised that it was advertised as an 8 ounce tube but when I received it that it was a 3 ounce tube.  As always with Amazon they took care of my issue immediately.  Very happy with Amazon!</li>
    <li> This is by far our favorite lotion. It goes on smoothly and is not too heavy but it lasts for many hours. And the smell is fabulous. Our local Walgreens only carries it in the summer and we could not live without it in Florida.</li>
    <li> As a person who believed it necessary to protect my skin from the cancer causing rays of the sun, I have been overly cautious wearing long sleeves and slacks, even in summer, when outside.  I have also covered myself in sunscreen while at the beach, etc.  The result... I became vitamin D deficient, a bad development.  I  now know that we need some exposure to the sun each day.  Nevertheless, there are times when I feel the need to apply sunscreen.  I am happy to have found this product, it contains additional Vitamin D; is not greasy; and although it has a fragrance, it does not carry the typical sunscreen odor.</li>
    <li> This lotion isn&#x27;t heavy like some of the other brands.  Rubs in easily and smells fantastic.  I have a difficult time finding it in stores so I hunted it down on-line and order it whenever I want.</li>
    <li> We really like this sunscreen, but when it is gone from the stores it&#x27;s gone. So stock up and do not run out mid-season!</li>
    <li> Does not leave me looking like a ghost like other products. Smells nice also.&lt;br /&gt;very nice product. I would order again.</li>
    <li> I love this sunscreen and have not been able to find it in my local stores.  I probably should have bought a case of it so that I would always have it.  We also use the 30 and 50 spf and they really do a great job and smell really good too.</li>
    <li> Works fine but smells great! Always my favorite!</li>
    <li> Bought this once because it was on sale, best find in a long time. This lotion feels great, it is not greasy and does a great job.</li>
    <li> I loved this product when I bought it, it smells great and gives good coverage. I am only giving it 3 stars however as it rates quite highly on the EWG&#x27;s (Environmental Working Group) list of sunscreens containing harmful chemicals so I will be looking for a safer option when I purchase my next sunscreen.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. Been using it for years.  Wasn&#x27;t too happy about the expiration date on the last order.  I think it said September 2014.  A little too close for comfort. Suggest you get some fresh stock.</li>
    <li> I use to get it every time I went to the shore, but I don&#x27;t go any longer so I got it from here the bottle is now yellow but the product is the same, it works great.</li>
    <li> Product is different than picture and description. Yellow bottle was shipped.</li>
    <li> This product is great, but not easy to find. The price was right, and I was able to get the aloe lotion as well and it arrived within days...thank you.</li>
    <li> great firming love it</li>
    <li> I discovered this product while vacationing in Hollywood, Fl. This is the best suntan lotion ever! It smells better than any other!!!!</li>
    <li> Receive in a timely fashion and exactly what I wanted.  This is the best suntan lotion ever!  It smells better than any other!!!!</li>
    <li> Perfect.  We love this product because of the lack of scent.  It works wonderfully.  Great protection against the sun especially for people who burn easily.  Also, since it has no scent, perfect for people who have allergies.</li>
    <li> Great smell, works well. two weeks on beach, no burns just good tan</li>
    <li> Smells like marshmallows. Awesome.</li>
    <li> Best sun tan lotion I&#x27;ve used.  It actually does dry quickly upon application and does not leave a greasy filmy feeling once on.  Most importantly, it is an effective sun block lotion....works great.</li>
    <li> I love all of the Ocean Potion products. They only contain natural oils and the sunscreen does not contain any of the horrific chemicals that other sunscreens have. I like the SPF 15 since I tan well and don&#x27;t like to use heavy sunblocks, but it does come in other strengths.</li>
    <li> Just back from a week in Belize and bought this for the trip.  I really liked it no burns and still tanned well.</li>
    <li> I discovered this product while vacationing in Hawaii. When I returned home I could not locate it in any store, so I ordered it through Amazon. I am a fair skinned gal, who burns easily. Ocean Potion, smells great (a very subtle orange creamsicle scent), absorbs quickly and keeps me from burning. I even use it on my face, and have not had any issue with break-outs.&lt;br /&gt;I purchased the 15 and 30 SPF and both work great.</li>
    <li> Very nice sunblock, leaves your skin smooth and it is not sticky at all. Pleasant  scent.</li>
    <li> I love this sunscreen...I have used it on my face every single day for the past several years, with no adverse effects. The skin on my face is as soft as ever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The formula is light and pleasant, unlike most sunscreens (which often are thick and oily, and unnecessarily smelly). I even use it in my eye area without any sort of stinging.</li>
    <li> Excellent kids love it</li>
    <li> I have been using this OP for a few years.  Love the scent....not fruity nor topical...just a nice scent....and it works very well for us.</li>
    <li> love the stuff, smells great. can&#x27;t find it in Mn.</li>
    <li> we orded sunblock 15 and we get sunblock 30</li>
    <li> This picture shows the best sun lotion I have ever found or used.  They have changed the makeup of the lotion and look of the tube.  What I received was not what is pictured here and what I wanted and was led to believe I was ordering.  Very disappointing.</li>
    <li> ok price (when you add in shipping) but love this product.  works great and smells even better!  Arrived quickly.</li>
    <li> Did not receive this product as ordered. For the second time! Once can happen, but twice in one week?  Ridiculous! I&#x27;ll just go to my local store and buy it there! I am not fulfilled by the Amazon Fulfillment Center! Maybe they need people working there who can read? This is not rocket science people!!  Also no refunds/returns for this product! What&#x27;s up with that?</li>
    <li> fast shipment, product as described.</li>
    <li> Hands down the best lotion I&#x27;ve ever used. First of all look at the volumes of ingredients in most sunblocks ! OMG what a laundry list of chemicals ! Many people, suck as me, the kids , and many others can&#x27;t used most sunblocks because it irritates their skin, causing redness and burning. Not here, a most gentle and very effective product. If you used your head and apply this lotion, and use a touch of common sense about your exposure time YOU WILL NOT BURN. My first couple oft times in the sun for the season I use the SPF 30 to get a base and then for the rest of the summer I use the 15 SPF and I have... wait for it... NEVER burned. Additional benny, it smells like the old Dreamcicles (ice cream bar) I used to get as a kid. What more could you ask?&lt;br /&gt;No animals were injured in the writing of this review.</li>
    <li> The Ocean Potion suncare products are by far the best - but they&#x27;re hard to find locally.  They work great, and the fragrance is nice - not overpowering.  The only brand I&#x27;ll buy!</li>
    <li> Smells like an orange creamsicle. Works just as good as it smells.</li>
    <li> Hard to find in R. I. Love the smell and non greasy feel</li>
    <li> One of the few Oxybenzone free lotions, goes on smooth, not greasy, easy to wash off, and the perfect combo of still being able to get a little color while protecting yourself. I will only use this stuff if and when possible.</li>
    <li> I have only used the SPF 15 lotion but absolutely love it.  Bought my first bottle in Anguilla and cannot find it in stores locally but sure can count on Amazon to have anything I can&#x27;t find!  It rubs in quickly and smells terrific!</li>
