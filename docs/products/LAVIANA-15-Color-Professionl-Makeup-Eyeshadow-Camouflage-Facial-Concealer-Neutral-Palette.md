      <li>I use it to conceal and to clean up my eyebrows.</li>
      <li>I have normal to dry skin as I&#x27;m 59 years, this works wonderfully under my foundation.  </li>
      <li>The colors aren&#x27;t exactly like its shown the 3 light colors.</li>
      <li>It works great, and conceals really good :) I used the lightest shade as a base for my eye shadow.</li>
      <li>Recommend to buy them so worth the money.</li>
      <li>I also use a silicone based primer,which works well for my skin type to give me the fresh, dewy look I</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not powder but a kind of oil-ish pasty fluid.</li>
      <li>I received this two days ago and tried it out yesterday, it only has a couple colors for my complexion (extremely fair) but they worked really well.</li>
      <li>Iusw it only to contour but its nice for its price.</li>
      <li>And most come on clear</li>
      <li>Worth the money.</li>
      <li>and I guess I wasn&#x27;t applying it right.</li>
      <li>It blended well, and really covered my blue under eyes nicely.</li>
      <li>Like very much.</li>

      <li>BUT it stayed on for a whole day!</li>
      <li>I would even be aware with oily skin...</li>
      <li>the first is more of a pearl white</li>
      <li>I like all the tones, easy to apply on the face, moist not dry.</li>
      <li>I really can&#x27;t tell what exactly this thing is.</li>
      <li>This product is really small and it doesnt conceal any of my blemishes doesnt have good pigmentation it creases fast</li>
      <li>Overall though, I&#x27;m happy for what I spent!!</li>
      <li>Very food variety of color options.</li>
      <li>but it doesnt really show any color on my face.</li>
      <li>it came fast too</li>
      <li>I really this.</li>
      <li>The texture is creamy but too watery to provide any real coverage.</li>
      <li>but I use at least two of them on a regular basis, and two more occasionally, which is the only reason I&#x27;m giving it for stars, I feel like the range of colors is kind of a waste for me, but the  product itself  is wonderful</li>

      <li>Thanks anyway.</li>
      <li>Very oily and creamy.</li>

      <li>smaller than what it looks like but other than that good</li>
      <li>What more can you say, if one is willing to repurchase a product then that says more than mere words.</li>
      <li>This palette was a decent price</li>
      <li>This palette conceals decently, however, it does somewhat cake up and crease.</li>
      <li>The  skin really looks natural...</li>
      <li>the 3rd one is a very light purplish pink.</li>
      <li>I live in Arizona, so I understand.</li>
      <li>the 2nd one is a light teal blue</li>
      <li>Just what I needed to complete my make up collection!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> this is a awesome product..love the difrent shades and how it correct all the flaws in colorations in my skin.</li>
    <li> Being a college student who doesn&#x27;t have a lot of money to spend, this pallet is perfect. It is a little dry which made it a little harder to blend BUT it stayed on for a whole day! I love it!</li>
    <li> smaller than what it looks like but other than that good</li>
    <li> Cheap and clay like. Extremely hard to blend.  It dried out my skin and caused me to have fine bumps. (I have medium to oily type skin).</li>
    <li> The texture of this concealer pallet is fantastic, it has great coverage and a wide variety of uses, I guess it&#x27;s meant for professional makeup artists and a lot of the colours are of no use to me but I use at least two of them on a regular basis, and two more occasionally, which is the only reason I&#x27;m giving it for stars, I feel like the range of colors is kind of a waste for me, but the  product itself  is wonderful, it&#x27;s not cakey, gives me a natural for and concealed my imperfections, therefore I highly recommend it :)</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very oily. I wanted more coverage.</li>
    <li> PLEASE DONT DO IT! this just rachett the palette size is not like in the picture, the colors go on sheer, slides on face like wax don&#x27;t expect  your makeup to stay put with this one. just spend the money for the good stuff. 2 thumbs down</li>
    <li> I really love this concealer palet. I am able to use this through out the year from spring, all the way through winter. It has so many shades. It sometimes creases when I use a primer, so I suggest using it without one. It works great, and conceals really good :) I used the lightest shade as a base for my eye shadow. I am going to purchase again. Its my everyday concealer.</li>
    <li> dont waste your money, took forever to ship and wouldnt ever purchase again, bad quality &#x27;makeup&#x27;</li>
    <li> This palette was a decent price and I was looking for a few different shades. This palette conceals decently, however, it does somewhat cake up and crease.</li>
    <li> I Love my make up pallet. It&#x27;s exactly as described on website. Colors and texture are perfect for cover up.</li>
    <li> I like all the tones, easy to apply on the face, moist not dry. Recommend to buy them so worth the money.</li>
    <li> I bought this and don&#x27;t even know how to contour my faces lol so I can&#x27;t say how it does or whateva but it&#x27;s okay I like it just don&#x27;t know how to do it correctly lol</li>
    <li> This product is really small and it doesnt conceal any of my blemishes doesnt have good pigmentation it creases fast</li>
    <li> Very food variety of color options. Holds up very well through out the day . I would buy again!!&lt;br /&gt;Fast shipping as well</li>
    <li> It was a little smaller than I expected, but that was okay because it lasted me for a long time. I think it does great coverage for the price I paid. It is heavy, and wears off within 30-1hr. It kinda dries your skin. I&#x27;d recommend it to people who are just looking for a cheap coverage, or beginners who are just learning to conceal.</li>
    <li> I received this two days ago and tried it out yesterday, it only has a couple colors for my complexion (extremely fair) but they worked really well. Stayed on all day and didn&#x27;t seem to rub off as much as my previous concealer did. BE WARNED: this concealer is THICK!! Perfect for small cover ups and breakouts, but slightly difficult to blend, and DO NOT put under your eyes! It covers the dark bags really well, but it emphasises the small wrinkles since its to thick to get in them. Overall though, I&#x27;m happy for what I spent!!</li>
    <li> Just what I needed to complete my make up collection! Wonderful for high lighting and contouring! The price can&#x27;t be beat!</li>
    <li> I would&#x27;ve like to try it, but it came all melted as ice cream so I had to throw it away... I live in Arizona, so I understand. Thanks anyway.</li>
    <li> Waste of money. Not great quality, caused creasing and oil. I do not recommend using them under your eyes. The green shade is not pigmented enough to cover any redness.</li>
    <li> Personally I didn&#x27;t like this product. But someone else might. I bought when I was starting to use concealer and I guess I wasn&#x27;t applying it right. Judge this product for yourself. You just might love.</li>
    <li> Very oily and creamy. Not at all what I expected... ordered this to try to highlight and contour and it just looked awful!!! Plus, took FOREVER to arrive.</li>
    <li> I really this. It is perfect for a beginner like me. It has very fast shipping.( it cames 18 days earlier than said). I like the colors.</li>
    <li> I love this concealer palette. People say that it&#x27;s not very pigmented but I definitely disagree. I have acne and redness on my face and this concealer covered it all. Perfect for under eye concealing as well. I will repurchase this.</li>
    <li> You definitely get what you pay for with this product. While it does supply good coverage, it is a bit cakey. It&#x27;s not horrible but it definitely isn&#x27;t the best.</li>
    <li> Hated it. It&#x27;s like for kids</li>
    <li> I also enjoy this concealer palette It has a range of colors. It&#x27;s creamy but not to creamy. works great for contouring face.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re looking for something that is good quality..GET THIS! Not only does it get the job done, but the material is smooth as silk and it makes skin look radiant and glowing. It&#x27;s also M.A.C! I really do recommend this product, give it a try!</li>
    <li> I like it BUT its not thick enough... Not the best concealer.&lt;br /&gt;But I would recommend if you wear this without foundation.</li>
    <li> I got the palette thinking I would have a range if colors to mix for concealing, highlighting and contouring. Well it does have a range of colors but the actual product itself is horrible. The texture is creamy but too watery to provide any real coverage. It was really hard for me to pick the product up with my makeup brushes. So I tried to use my fingertips and still nothing. The colors go on sheer and crease almost instantly. I do not recommend this product.</li>
    <li> too cheaply made. I threw it away</li>
    <li> I really can&#x27;t tell what exactly this thing is. It&#x27;s not powder but a kind of oil-ish pasty fluid. And so far I tried twice but it doesnt really show any color on my face.</li>
    <li> For the first 30 minutes, I loved this product. It blended well, and really covered my blue under eyes nicely. Then the nightmare happened. Within one hour of wearing this concealer the skin of my under eyes were literally flaking. I couldn&#x27;t believe it! How could something become so horrible, when it started so nicely. Obviously there is something in the ingredients of this product that is very drying. If you have normal to dry skin. I do NOT recommend what so ever. I would even be aware with oily skin...</li>
    <li> So I received this a little earlier than I expected, but I&#x27;am so glad I did. I absolutely love it! For the price and free shipping (because I bought some makeup brushes), I couldn&#x27;t have been more happier! So creamy, it last almost all day and it&#x27;s just what I needed for contouring! Will purchase another one very soon!</li>
    <li> With this product you can do all make up tricks! For exemple : make your eyes look bigger or your nose smaller and etc ... . Very useful !!!!and the good thing it&#x27;s that it is not oily.. The  skin really looks natural...</li>
    <li> Totally waste of money, bad quality and dont cover  anything at all, if you want something that works, please dont buy this.</li>
    <li> Chalky,&lt;br /&gt;Not Pigmented,&lt;br /&gt;Wears off easily,&lt;br /&gt;Not a Coastal Scents Dupe,&lt;br /&gt;Too many highlighter colors,&lt;br /&gt;Does not show up on dark skinned women.&lt;br /&gt;I would not recommend.&lt;br /&gt;The coastal scents is currently on sale. It&#x27;s worth the few extra bucks.</li>
    <li> The colors aren&#x27;t exactly like its shown the 3 light colors. the first is more of a pearl white the 2nd one is a light teal blue the 3rd one is a very light purplish pink. Overall I love this!! Worth the money.</li>
    <li> Poor.. melts easily and its more like lip gloss. And most come on clear I tested out on my hand I Didn&#x27;t want to put it on my face and glad I didn&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> I ordered this concealer palette. I ordered this cause I&#x27;m obsessed with make-up and because i wanted to contour my face and honestly i&#x27;m thinking about buying a few more because it&#x27;s wonderful and the price is even better.</li>
    <li> I was very happy to get this palette, now I wish it was offered in subscription form like some of the makeup we use daily is.  In this unnamed set you can do a lot of blending, sculpting, highlighting and concealing.  The product is nicely pigmented, it&#x27;s smooth and applies well then blends out beautifully. I have normal to dry skin as I&#x27;m 59 years, this works wonderfully under my foundation.  I also use a silicone based primer,which works well for my skin type to give me the fresh, dewy look I love.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You get a good amount of product for your money here, so this is well worth the cost.  What more can you say, if one is willing to repurchase a product then that says more than mere words.</li>
    <li> Much Smaller than the picture suggests.</li>
    <li> The only problem with this is it&#x27;s too thick, it&#x27;s just like putting on Halloween makeup. Wish they could make it more apply able.</li>
    <li> Disclaimer: Makeup applies differently on everyone, depending on skin type and application process, so your experience may vary. In my opinion, this product is cheap in price as well as value. The concealers are creamy to the touch, but apply heavily even when used sparingly. The coverage is almost non-existant, even when built up, which cause it to just look cakier and draw attention to fine lines. I tried applying with just my finger, as well as a concealer brush. Results were barely better when applied with fingers, but still not something I would wear out of the house.</li>
    <li> Like very much. Will recommend to other makeUp artists.</li>
    <li> it feels dry after a couple of uses, but colors are great it came fast too</li>
    <li> I really liked this make up. Iusw it only to contour but its nice for its price.</li>
    <li> I love this palette. I use it on myself and my clients.  It covers well, it is oily BUT when you give the product a little swirl/mix it changes.  I use it to conceal and to clean up my eyebrows. .you can see me using this product on Instagram under makeupby_mars also on Facebook.  My only issue with this is that I ordered 4 of these. .and 3 came in broken. ..and I mean Broken!  :( I feel I cant use them in my kit because I don&#x27;t want my clients seeing them like that...but I guess they will be for my personal use.</li>
    <li> Works perfectly for a night out.</li>
    <li> this compact is good quality and has a range of color for EVERY skin type. I am African American with a lighter skin tone and they work great. They are very creamy but not too heavy.</li>
