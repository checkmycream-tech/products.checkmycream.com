      <li>I would get more pimples.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m okay</li>
      <li>While I could splash it off with water, I find that it&#x27;s better to use a wash cloth to thoroughly rinse it</li>
      <li>If you want to be sure to buy it, try it at Sephora or Macy&#x27;s see if you like it/love it.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I really wanted to like this cleanser. I have oily acne prone skin. This cleanser is very frothy and a little goes a long way as they say. It smells faintly of spearmint, a little like toothpaste. It feels very gentle, and appears to remove light mineral makeup, however once washed off, the problems start. It leaves my face feeling like there&#x27;s an obvious film on it even though I have rinsed well, idk what the film is and I guess it&#x27;s one of the essential oil ingredients. It does seem to balance out oil production for me, however this crap broke me out like crazy! Every use I would get more pimples. Big cystic ones, little regular ones, it&#x27;s a shame because besides the pimples, the rest of my face was starting to look great. Idk if it&#x27;s just not removing my makeup well enough or the oils are irritating or what, but I don&#x27;t have time to figure out how to use it because every day my face looks worse. I&#x27;m just gonna give it away. I would skip it if you are sensitive or very acne prone.</li>
    <li> I have tried many, many, many face washes over the years.  I find this one to be very gentle on my skin, leaving it super clean and very soft.  Because it is easy on my skin, it doesn&#x27;t cause breakouts or irritate my skin in any way.  I am fair skinned and have have both oily/dry skin.  It works beautifully and is worth the money (to me anyway).  My skin has never looked better -- I&#x27;m 43 years old and have been using this for 10 years now.  I tried changing to a less expensive product from Alba, but my skin revolted (even though I&#x27;m sure it was a good product).  It&#x27;s just not worth messing with something that works so well.</li>
    <li> Origin&#x27;s Checks and Balances Face wash has done wonders for my face. I used to have frequent breakouts. But since I switched to this face wash, my face is almost completely blemish free. It gently cleans your skin and has a wonderful smell. When you get done your face is very soft and has a beautiful glow to it. My husband even uses it now. He loves it just as much as I do.</li>
    <li> I dont even mind the price. Even though it doesn&#x27;t look like a lot, the frothy texture makes it so you don&#x27;t have to use a ton, making it last a lot longer. I am person who has very smooth skin and only gets the occasional pimple around period time so I don&#x27;t like to use harsh face washes that claim to decrease my acne when I don&#x27;t need to, yet it isn&#x27;t good for me to just use regular soup on my face. This face wash is the perfect medium. It doesn&#x27;t claim to do anything at all but wash and give a very pleasant minty aroma and soothing texture that makes me not want to wash it off! Highly recommend!!</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this cleanser. The combination of Bergamot, Lavender and Mint create a wonderfully fresh smelling scent, which to me is sort of an earthy mintiness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I  only need to use a  small dime-size amount of this cleanser. It has the consistency of a thick lotion and develops into a nice frothy lather. While I could splash it off with water, I find that it&#x27;s better to use a wash cloth to thoroughly rinse it off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The results are really amazing. My oily T-zone feels clean but my cheeks (typically dry) don&#x27;t feel tight or dry. Makeup is thoroughly washed off and the cleanser doesn&#x27;t irritate my eyes  I had been having some issues with minor breakouts but since using this cleanser for the past few weeks, my skin has seen noticeable improvement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While this cleanser doesn&#x27;t dry out the skin, I didn&#x27;t find it to add moisture either. But with this type of cleanser I didn&#x27;t have expectations that it would. In the past I have used a lot of cream cleansers (non-foaming) which were great for the dry skin, but didn&#x27;t help much with the oily areas. Checks and Balances is the happy medium - nice foaming action while managing to maintain skin&#x27;s natural moisture level.</li>
    <li> It is a little drying, but I love it.  Cleans up the makeup and the dirt without scrubbing.</li>
    <li> love this cleanser. both my husband and I both use it! great for all types of skin. a little goes a long way</li>
    <li> If you wish to cause premature aging and needless irritation to your skin, then this product is for you.  Better yet, the ENTIRE Origins range of products is for you!  Essential oils serve NO purpose in skin care products.  Such ingredients cause photo-toxicity, cell death, dermatitis and the break down of collagen in the skin.  Estee Lauder, which formulates this line of products, manufactures much better product lines than this one.  I know that they smell wonderful, but the safety and condition of your skin is MUCH more important.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this facial wash for years.  It keeps my face clear of blemishes without drying out my skin.  Great product!</li>
    <li> Love it. Doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin (and I live I a dry climate) but controls oil as well. Skin feels fresh after using. Just had to go and find it this morning after my teenager used all of hers and stolen mine.</li>
    <li> I was using this face wash for a couple of months and I absolutely loved it! It kept my skin from becoming too oily through out the day! I loved using this product and was recommending it to all of my friends. After about 6 months, I began to have problems with my eyes. They would get red and irritated and I changed everything in my routine but my face wash. I tried to stop using Checks and Balances and my eyes got immediately better! While I did really like this product, it was a little too harsh for my skin. I have very sensitive, combination skin. I think this would be great for people with tougher skin!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s good at clearing oil off my face after I go overboard with frying in the kitchen, but seems to give me allergies on my face. I have sensitive skin, so I probably will not purchase this again.</li>
    <li> I have combination skin that can get very oily but also very dry.  This facewash feels nice, smells fresh, and really cleanses my skin.  It definitely takes care of the oil.  In winter my skin tends to dry out a bit more and if I did not use moisturiser afterwards, this facewash would leave me a little dry and flaky, but I find that with all products I have tried.</li>
    <li> 21$ elsewhere, too expensive on here. Otherwise this product is great and leaves my skin feeling soft. Highly recommend it just don&#x27;t purchase here.</li>
    <li> Have always purchased this at Dillards/Macy&#x27;s, however I will be purchasing here when my next bottle runs out (~4 months).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am a guy and this is the best face wash I have ever used. I have used plenty of &amp;#34;nice&amp;#34; brands in the past, many more expensive than Origins, and I can confidently say that none have worked better than this face wash!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This wash strikes an impossible balance between that which cleans and that which moisturizes. It leaves the skin feeling smooth (exfloiated), tight (nourished), soft (moisturized), clear (cleaned) and tingly (rejuvenated).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This face wash is like democracy for your whole face. Don&#x27;t worry about vetoing that pimple, passing the Oil Removal Act of 2015 or funding the Clear Skin initiative. Origins Checks and Balances has got you covered!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are a guy, don&#x27;t worry about this being only &amp;#34;for women&amp;#34;, Amazon is drunk! Get. This. Stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Kyle E.</li>
    <li> You name the brand, I&#x27;ve used its face wash.  Origins Checks and Balances does so much more than it says!  I have combination skin, leaning more towards oily, and this clears my skin without drying it out.  I noticed that this lasts beyond just a few hours of washing and keeps my face under control all day long.  I use it twice a day with my Clarisonic brush and the results are phenomenal.  My complexion is brightened, my face is shine free- I barely use make up!  I would highly recommend this product if it works for your skin type.  I would go to a local Origins store and get a sample first.</li>
    <li> this product makes my face feel clean and soft, I don&#x27;t get the feeling that my face is dry or tight feeling.</li>
    <li> Quite expensive, but it seems to work.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used plenty of face washes, but by far this is my staple favorite. I only need a pea sized amount to get a generous lather, so the tube is an excellent value for the amount. My skin isn&#x27;t left dry or taut feeling. And most importantly it cleans all traces of makeup, even the difficult eye area. The smell is also perfect, luxurious and calming.</li>
    <li> love love this product.  you need very little but it goes a very long way.  does not dry out my face like other washes do.  A 5 star recommend for me.</li>
    <li> It works. It is gentle but actually leaves your face clean and fresh. Great smell.</li>
    <li> I was on my last thread with finding a good face wash for my acne prone skin. Acne oriented face washes were often leaving me too dry (which equal more acne) and non acne face washes were too oily and greasy (which equal more acne). Using this along with my clarasonic has worked wonders for my skin! It feels so clean afterwards. I cant say if its the face wash or my clarasonic that has really helped my cystic acne breakouts, but together this is the first time in years my skin looks normal again! I use it along with the origins spot treatment afterwards which seeps into the pores and helps clear my acne even further. (if you&#x27;re not a fan of that specific acne spot treatment, use your favorite one along with your favorite moisturizer).  and voila. I had perfect skin as a teenager but around 21 began my bout with acne and all throughout my 20s have struggled with it. I&#x27;m 28 now and this is the first time since around my early 20s that my cystic acne has dramatically decreased. If this sounds like you, please give it a try! I hope my recommendation can help.</li>
    <li> I was introduced to origins by my girlfriend as being a great organic alternative to face washing.  I have to admit I am hooked! This stuff is great.  It smells good ( and not strong) and it makes my face feel cleaner than normal face wash which is loaded with chemicals. I suffer from chronic adult acne and this face wash is the only thing that has helped reduce the amount of blemishes I have. The only con is the price- it is not cheap.  BUT it is worth it and a little bit goes along way.  One bottle lasts for months! You wont regret it.</li>
    <li> My wife loves this face wash, and so do I. She has sensitive skin, and I have eczema so this is a great compromise for us both. 2 people/ use daily last about 2 months.</li>
    <li> Horrible. Dried out my sensitive skin like none other.</li>
    <li> Leaves my face clean but not dry and I love the foamy, fresh consistency. Great smell and wonderful effects on my combo skin.</li>
    <li> I am 34 year old guy and was turned on to Origins products by my best friend when I was 22. She worked at an Origns store and was appalled at the time to learn that I was using Zest (bar soap) to wash my face. After using many Origins products religiously for the last 12 years, Checks and Balances remains one of my top 5 skin care essentials. Everything about it is pure heaven. The scent, the texture, the feel of your skin after use. It&#x27;s a treat to use it each morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have combination skin and this product delivers exactly what it claims. It strips away the unnecessary oils and dirt from my face and doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling dry or parched. I can attest after for than a decade of use that it really does protect your skin from all the free radicals bombarding it each day. It keeps my complexion clear and has played a large part in my youthful appearance. Many Origins products have a fruity scent to them and while Checks and Balances has a spearmint type scent it is clean and masculine and doesn&#x27;t linger after you&#x27;ve washed your face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has this amazing frothy/foaming action that allows you to use a small pea sized amount that, after water is added, transforms that small amount into enough frothy/foamy product to wash my face, my entire neck (guys you&#x27;ll LOVE using this before you shave as it sooths and cleanses so well you can kiss razor burn goodbye), and even enough to wash my pecs and shoulders. I start at my forehead and work my way down and being 6&#x27;6&amp;#34; tall its usually is enough to wash my shouders and chest in addition to my face and neck ( if you&#x27;re shorter it may very be enough to cleanse you from the waist up). This makes the price an amazing deal. Yes you spend on average $20-30 for the large tube, depending on where you purchase it however, the large tube will last more than 6 months and its a high quality product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I&#x27;ve gotten older, out of curiosity I have tried other products from Dior, Kiehl&#x27;s, Lancôme, and even lower end products like Burt&#x27;s Bees, Olay Regenerist,and Aveeno to see if there was anything out there that I might be &amp;#34;missing&amp;#34;. Nope...Check and Balances is the real deal. I will never stop using this product unless they stop making it, or I pass on. I seriously reccomend it to everyone who tells me I look so young for my age or asks what sort of products I use. I give co workers samples because I am so satisfied and in love with the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re curious, but hesitant to spend the money on it I strongly suggest going to an Origins store, or a retailer who carries Origins products (Nordstrom, Macy&#x27;s, Sephora) and ask for a sample. You will fall in love the first time you use it and will be running back to the store to buy it. It&#x27;s that good, and in 10 years you&#x27;ll thank me. (I know this is supposed to be a review for Checks and Balances only..but I reccomend almost every Origins products..they absolutely amazing!)nd even lower end products like Burt&#x27;s Bees, Olay Regenerist,and Aveeno to see if there was anything out there that I might be &amp;#34;missing&amp;#34;.

    <li> After one use of this product, I saw an immediate improvement on my very dry face. I use it in combo with Benefit&#x27;s Dear John moisturizer and now my face is so much softer, it&#x27;s almost unbelievable to me. The difference between night and day. I can&#x27;t stop touching my face! I would highly recommend Origins Checks and Balances to anyone with dry skin. I love it and I&#x27;m so glad I found it.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the same price+shipping if you buy it on amazon, but the quality can&#x27;t be guaranteed.  I&#x27;ve used this product before (having bought it from sephora) and decided to purchase it again because it was a very good cleanser (nice/simple smell, great lather, clean finish).  However, the one that I got from amazon must&#x27;ve been on stock for quite a while because it just had that texture of something that was really old and made my face feel a little chalky? after using it.  Not the same.  This is just my experience though! If you&#x27;re too lazy to go out and buy it, it might be worth the shot to order it online.</li>
    <li> I sought this face wash out because I have difficult skin.  Mine is dry and sensitive, yet also acne prone.  Reading in the description that it is meant for skin with both dry and oily places and discourages excess oil production while also protecting dry skin, it sounded perfect for me.  When I apply it to my face, I love how it feels.  It is exceptionally creamy and really feels luxurious on my skin.  I enjoy how it feels when I massage it in with wet fingers as well as when I use my clarisonic. I also find the scent pleasant.  It&#x27;s very light and natural smelling, but not medicinal like some cleansers for sensitive skin can be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, the downside is that I have to really make sure I rinse it off well otherwise it feels like it leaves residue behind that makes my skin feel tight and papery.  It surprised me because this isn&#x27;t a problem that often plagues the cleansers I&#x27;ve tried, especially those geared toward sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I think this is a good cleanser as long as you have the time to make sure you rinse your face very well after use.</li>
    <li> Use it day &amp; night. Lasts a long time as you only need a drop to wash your entire face.. Origins is top quality.  Love this</li>
    <li> this is my third purchased...luv it!</li>
    <li> This face wash is a little pricey but definitely worth every penny. The smell is fantastic and you only need (seriously) a tiny bit to get a full froth. You can feel it deep cleaning and it leaves my face alive and awake in the morning. I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll ever use another face wash again!</li>
    <li> Sensitive skin due to cancer!  This cleanser is so soft and gentle.  Has made my skin look great. I use it with the Night-A-Mins Mineral Enriched Cream at night.  Awesome combination! I have been getting compliments on my complexion, which is incredible for a 55 year old cancer patient</li>
    <li> This face wash is great for all skin types.  It has a fresh clean fragrance.  Highly recommend for all ages.</li>
    <li> Love this cleanser, so foamy and the scent is so fresh. It washes off so easily. I have been using this for a month now and really notice a positive difference in my skin.</li>
    <li> My husband has very oily skin.  This is the&lt;br /&gt;only product he has ever used that works!&lt;br /&gt;He keeps one in his bathroom drawer and&lt;br /&gt;also one in the shower.  Can&#x27;t run out!</li>
    <li> Zero complaints here! I was looking for a face wash gentle enough for everyday use, but one that would still be strong enough to clean deep down to my pores. Checks and Balances is that. I use it everyday, sometimes twice a day, and my skin is clearer, pores less noticeable, complexion less red. If I use it twice, I follow it up with a moisturizer, but it is pretty nondrying. It&#x27;s foaming, so a tiny drop it all you need. If you use it with a Clarisonic, even better! I&#x27;ll never use anything else for a daily cleansed.</li>
    <li> I love that this product foams nicely and rinses clean.  But Origins is not a cruelty-free company, so I cannot give it more than 3 stars.  Too bad, if they were cruelty-free I would buy all of my products through them based on this great cleanser alone!</li>
    <li> Skin feels completely clean and not dry.</li>
    <li> Ive been using this product for 5+ years. Love the consistency; its creamy and cleans face well with little effort. Don&#x27;t have to use much. Tube lasts a long time..</li>
    <li> If you want to save yourself 10 bucks, walk to the store.  I thought that most things were cheaper on Amazon, but certainly not 50% more expensive in comparison with the actual store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just got back from the Origins store in downtown SF, and I just bought the same 5 oz bottle for $21.  Including tax, it&#x27;s $22.84.  I&#x27;m going to return the one I bought here and save the difference (net shipping).</li>
    <li> Gentle and cleanses very well removing dirt and makeup but without harming your skin.  Perfect for sensitive skin.  I recommend this product often to friends and family.</li>
    <li> It cleans my face as it should.</li>
    <li> Love it!  This stuff works so good!</li>
    <li> I originally got this as a sampler from my birchbox subscription. I&#x27;ve been looking for a good cleanser for my ever changing, finicky skin. I was one of the lucky girls that in my pre-teen and teen years I might suffer from **one** zit a month (blessed asian genes). I never cared too much about my skin care routine, except to keep it from the sun mostly. When I hit 22, my skin just went crazy. One day it would be dry, the next day it was super oily. I started getting acne in the middle of my cheeks and when I usually would have zero zits, I now have 20 (on each cheek bone). I&#x27;ve tried a variety of things. I&#x27;d use products that were more harsher when my skin was oily but that would just irritate it further. I tried using gentler products, like a cream cleanser, and my face would grease up and break out. Once I started using this stuff, all that changed. My acne flare ups died down (still happen but less haywire and more cyclical) and my face didn&#x27;t feel dried out and moisturizing after washing didn&#x27;t make me greasy.&lt;br /&gt;After a month and a half, I ran out of my sample. So imagine what a full sized bottle will last you!!</li>
    <li> best stuff ever. use it with the clarisonic and am so in love. perfect face wash.</li>
    <li> Best facial wash ever!</li>
    <li> The only wash that works on my adult skin.  Keeps the acne away and only need a drop to do it.</li>
    <li> This does not dry my face out like some other brands can do - glad to see the price online isn&#x27;t too high above brick&amp;mortar retail</li>
    <li> Great product.  Clears acne on 2 teenagers and myself.</li>
    <li> This is a really nice product at a decent price. I received this as a gift two years ago and have been using product since that time.  I don&#x27;t think you can find a better facial cleanser. It does a great job at removing makeup and cleansing face.</li>
    <li> Love the aroma and how soft and smooth skin feels afterward. Works great with those round yellow cellulose sponges. Have used this for years.</li>
    <li> Clears my face up nice. Very gentle on sensitive skin too. Just wish this brand did not test on animals.....I will be looking elsewhere.</li>
    <li> Best face cleanser I&#x27;ve ever tried.  Mild and gentle, but effective, cleaning my problem skin without drying it or leaving a residue.  I use it almost every night.</li>
    <li> I have been using this Origins product for a while and with my sensitive skin it is fabulous! Love It!</li>
    <li> I love this product and have been using it for years, but the mark up on Amazon is crazy. At the Origins store I only pay around $20. I have even tried using the Clinique equivalent and it is close, but still can&#x27;t beat this one. I have combination skin with extremes on my t-zone and cheeks, and this product works well on balancing them.</li>
    <li> I used at a another person&#x27;s house and love it. and bought it. So the price is a bitttt high but i can live with that. If you want to be sure to buy it, try it at Sephora or Macy&#x27;s see if you like it/love it. Then buy it. It is not that cheap.</li>
    <li> I have used this product before...I usually get it at Macy&#x27;s.  Even though it&#x27;s marketed to women, men should use it as well.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s great to clean the face before shaving.</li>
    <li> This has been the best product I&#x27;ve found that keeps my skin nice and clear! Have tried other products but always come back to this one. It foams up so you don&#x27;t need to use a lot and is definitely worth the price.</li>
    <li> It is really good, but smells disgusting.</li>
    <li> I feel like I&#x27;m on a never-ending search for the perfect facial cleanser, and I never seem to get it just right.  I&#x27;d been using Origins Clean Energy cleansing oil for a few years, but then started getting clogged pores and eczema, so I tried switching to this Origins Checks &amp; Balances frothy face wash.  Not really satisfied with it, either.  It doesn&#x27;t rinse easily (I need to scrub with a wash cloth to get it off) and it leaves my face really dried out and flaky.</li>
    <li> I have tried so many facial cleansers for my serious (two rounds of Accutane) acne problems. If I don&#x27;t use an effective product it shows up as cystic acne. This cleanser really gets the facial oil out of your pores, and I need that twice a day without fail to control my complexion. You don&#x27;t have to use a lot of it. Have used it for two months and I&#x27;m very happy with it.</li>
    <li> This cleanser is wonderful and it smells fantastic. Just a small amount in the palm works up a beautiful lather, no need to use very much. I will buy this again!!</li>
    <li> I love how it foams and cleans, altho it does sting when in the eyes... Gotta be careful.  Smells fresh too.</li>
    <li> This product, I recieved as a sample, then recieved for christmas. I adore it no complaints whatsoever.&lt;br /&gt;it makes you feel refreshed, and your skin feel nice and soft. I would say, that this is more than a five star product its a ten. ★</li>
    <li> Great for pre/post-shave.</li>
    <li> I received a full-size sample of this product, and I was immediately smitten!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried many, many face cleansers (being as I have \\&quot;combination skin\\&quot;, I&#x27;ve tried all types). This one, which I first tried while away on a women&#x27;s retreat last winter, left my face feeling creamy soft and completely refreshed!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product comes out as a white cream - you don&#x27;t need a large amount, so the bottle will last you quite some time. Upon contact, be prepared for a cool, refreshing, minty tingle (take care around your eyes as they will burn if the cream gets in them). The cream is almost masque-like in its composition, which further adds to its spa-like quality. It doesn&#x27;t drip or foam. It&#x27;s a lavish creamsicle for your face. :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But all of the niceties aside...does it work? Well, during one of the hottest, most humid summers on record, this Illinois girl says absolutely it does! I&#x27;m not experiencing that oily summer \\&quot;sheen\\&quot;, my break-outs are greatly decreased and I love, love, love the feeling of being pampered just by washing my face.</li>
    <li> Yes I will buy this again it makes my skin feel fresh and clean. I love the smell of this product.</li>
    <li> I wanted to try this because of the natural ingredients.  I don&#x27;t like that I cannot use it around my eyes.  It kind of makes my face feel like it did when I used Noxzema when I was a teen.  Sorry, I won&#x27;t be ordering it again.</li>
    <li> Fantastic product!!! I was VERY oily in my T zone area and forehead was quite embarrassing.&lt;br /&gt;I used this religously and it did balance my skin.</li>
    <li> My favorite face wash..</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very nice on skin and you only need a small amount because it foams up. so lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> This face wash has always been one of my &amp;#34;key item/must-have&#x27;s&amp;#34;, but one thing... Why is the seller calling this product &amp;#34;FOR WOMEN&amp;#34;???  It&#x27;s a product for ALL genders -- saying that it&#x27;s for women is silly in my opinion.</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive combination skin with a fair/pink complexion, so I have never been very keen on testing out face washes because if it has bad results it&#x27;s a rather vivid problem for me. However, this face wash is gentle and cleanses my skin without drying it out or leaving behind too much oil. It&#x27;s been a real treat being able to use something that actually works and doesn&#x27;t cost the whole farm to purchase. ;)</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know who it is that is reselling this on Prime right now, but this product retails for $20, not $32. I realize that Prime is a decision factor and I&#x27;m okay paying a few bucks more, but this is robbery at ~160% of MSRP.</li>
    <li> My skin tends to be dry. Most products I use further dries out my skin. This is the first face wash I have used (besides Burt&#x27;s Bees natural orange face wash) that is gentle on my skin, leaving it clean and NOT dried out! It also lasts a long time - a little goes a long way!</li>
    <li> Great for combination skin!</li>
