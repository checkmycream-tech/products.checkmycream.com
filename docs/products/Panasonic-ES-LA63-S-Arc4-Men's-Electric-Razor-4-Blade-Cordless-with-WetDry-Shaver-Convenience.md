<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This shaves CLOSE!  I also like it that I can see the percentage of charge. Reviews said it was good--smoked prior Norelco (glad it got lost). Quality. Tried to pick up another for one of my sons but the price went up about $39.  I didn&#x27;t realize I got such a good original deal.</li>
    <li> Excellent electric razor.  Very close shave with a swivel head that can follow the curves of your face.  Battery lasts about 2 weeks.</li>
    <li> I much prefer the Panasonics to all the other shavers I&#x27;ve used, including high-end Norelco and Braun. Apparently the skin on my throat is VERY sensitive, since a blade - ANY blade when I try to get very close - leaves me covered with dots of blood to be followed the next day by spots of infection.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The weak point, for me, with the Panasonics is the little spring-loaded plastic tabs on either side. Eventually they give way. And, though the mechanics of the shaver are fine, if the head won&#x27;t stay on, it&#x27;s not of much use. Would be nice if they were replaceable!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other &#x27;problem&#x27; I&#x27;ve encountered is a leakage of something appearing to be oil under the soft rubbery plastic on the handle. It appears to me the lifespan of one of these shavers, given these two factors, is only a few years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, would I buy this again? Yup. Works very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NO shaver that has claimed to be a &#x27;single pass&#x27; shaver IS - at least not for me. At 66, my beard is much thinner than at 21 - which has its benefits. But even at that, stretching the skin and multiple passes is required! This Panasonic is no exception. But it is GENTLE and of course powerful.</li>
    <li> I agree this is a great electric razor but it isn&#x27;t perfect. It still leaves hairs on me after several passes so I am not sure if I am doing something wrong?  I have tried with shaving cream and pulling my skin but with shaving cream you can&#x27;t see if you got the hair.</li>
    <li> I have a light beard, but I still need to shave every day to try to look somewhat civilized. I used an electric shaver for several years before switching to blades about 10 years ago, which were faster and closer than my old Norelco electric razor. However, I recently developed some sort of allergic reaction to the lubricating bar that now comes on Gillette blades, specifically itching on my neck and chin. So when I saw that Amazon had the Panasonic ES-LA63-S on a \\&quot;Today&#x27;s Deals\\&quot; sale for $99.99, I decided to give it a try. Glad I did!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Panasonic shaves me very quickly, very closely, and very comfortably -- better in all respects than the blades I was using. It&#x27;s light and easy to hold, and the head pivots to follow the contours of my face. It charges quickly -- one hour from zero to a full charge -- and it looks as if a charge will last me a couple of weeks at least. It can be used wet, so there&#x27;s no worry about dropping it in a sink full of water, and it&#x27;s easy to clean using liquid soap and water (it even has a turbo setting specifically for cleaning). Lastly, the digital readout provides a lot of information, including the charge level, how much time you&#x27;ve used it, an alert when it needs cleaning, and a couple of other things. And the built-on trimmer is 1000% better at trimming sideburns than the single blade that&#x27;s on the Gillette cartridges for that purpose. Oh, yeah - it comes with a 2-year warranty. All in all a very good buy!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;p.s. - If you try to register the razor on Panasonic&#x27;s website, you may run into a problem with the serial number. The site insists that the number contain 9 to 11 digits, but the serial number on the razor is only 7 digits. If you enter just those 7 digits, the system will not accept your registration. I called Panasonic and discovered that the workaround is to add the letters SN before the 7-digit serial number, and the system will then accept your registration.</li>
    <li> Bought this as a second (travel) shaver for the ES-LA93 I have. One thing is that this one doesn&#x27;t have the charging contacts on the back for use with the docking station. Beyond that, works well - as good as the other one.</li>
    <li> Very please, very close shave and great value.</li>
    <li> love it! its the third one in our family and they all say the same thing ..</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this shaver now since December of 2012 and cannot recommend it highly enough. I used to use Norelco, but this razor beats anything I have tried before – and I have been shaving for 40 years!</li>
    <li> My husband loves this razor! It gets a close shave, and can be used in the shower. What a great purchase!</li>
    <li> I like every part of it.  It works as advertised.  Expensive but worth it...I had used less expensive razors that just didn&#x27;t cut the mustard.</li>
    <li> Really like this razor.  We use it on a disabled man who has difficulty raising his chin to  shave his neck, and he has a thick, course beard.  The pivoting head makes the task much easier to get a clean shave.  It is easy to handle, gives a great shave and cleans beautifully.  It is more powerful and closer shaving than the other four-blade razors we&#x27;ve used over the past several years. I wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to recommend it.</li>
    <li> Shaver cuts well and gives a comfortable shave, however it doesn&#x27;t capture the shavings/hair well and &amp;#34;leaks&amp;#34; messy residue all over your sink, bathroom, floor etc.  I previously had a norelco that cut as well and did not make a mess.  I would avoid this model until they fix this issue.</li>
    <li> Got this to replace a Norelco Artic rotary shaver.  The Panasonic gives a very close shave, almost like a blade.  My only gripe is it does not hold a charge very long.  I can&#x27;t make it through the week on one charge.  Other than that this is a great shaver.  Easy to clean, and not to loud.</li>
    <li> I have utilized other electric shavers of well-known brands,this electric shaver seems to provide a closer shave.Let&#x27;s see if this shaver continues to satisfy my needs for a close and comfortable shave.</li>
    <li> Absolutely the best shave ever! Way better than my Braun 720 series which costs 3x as much and has needed repair twice. SoooooSmoooooth</li>
    <li> Great razor, especially for travel  It is a great value, has a nice grip and recharges super fast.  My husband loves it!</li>
    <li> This shaver really does an excellent job, it is powerful, fast and it saves time for me, personally this is the best electric shaver i have ever used, it took my old BRAUN shaver about 15 minutes to do it, with this it takes 4 minutes, this shaver does not irritate my skin does not pull or tug on the hair, most of the time it shaves in just a few quick passes, it has a bigger head than my previous shaver so it covers more in less time, it appears to have good batterie life, i think it can easily give me 10 shaves, it does  not come with a stand which i do not mind at all, cleaning it is quite easy, just a little soap and water.&lt;br /&gt;The main feature of this shaver for me is IT DOES AN EXCELLENT JOB, i wish i had discovered it many years ago, i used to hate shaving before this shaver and now it feels awesome.&lt;br /&gt;for me it&#x27;s a 6 star shaver.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks.</li>
    <li> This shaver is awesome.  Not sure why there are complaints on the price of this unit.  Panasonic offers a wide range of shavers at lower prices for those who can&#x27;t justify spending a few extra dollars on themselves.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Pros: much closer cut than my previous Braun Series 3.  Seems to be well made, very quiet compared to other electric razors I&#x27;ve used, head maintains good contact with face.  Cons: very large physical size.</li>
    <li> Best shave I&#x27;ve ever gotten from an electric razor, as other reviews will agree, BUT&lt;br /&gt;First one failed after 10 months.  Got a warranty replacement, and it failed in 7 months.</li>
    <li> I use this daily for shaving while taking my shower.  This will be my fifth Panasonic.  The duel swivel head has proven useful and I like the readout telling me precent charge remaining.  It provides a very close shave (better then previous model which was good).  I cannot compare to regular razor as I have always used electric.  I have found wet/dry razors have about a 3 year life when used daily in shower making it on the pricey side.  I think it is worth it.</li>
    <li> I was using Philips Arcitec for years. I wanted a change from rotary type shaver to something else. So I dd some research and found that there are 2 shavers which are different from Philips that is Braun and Panasonic. Then I chose Panasonic and I do not regret my decision as it is a smooth shave. I save time also as this shaver is fast. The instructions are clear and it feels good in the hand.</li>
    <li> I have used a rotary type razor and was somewhat hesitant to change. But, change I did and this was the best thing I have done in quite some time. I truly love the shaver. I researched this product to death and the bottom line, for all who is consider a new razor, get a Panasonic. Shaving is faster, thought speed was not an issue, and there is no razor burn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Again, a great razor.</li>
    <li> This review won&#x27;t convince straight razor nor safety blade users to switch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used this razor for month so I can&lt;br /&gt;For years, both my father and I have used Philips products (the items manufactured in Holland) when there was no such thing as re-chargable razors.&lt;br /&gt;The rotary system is fine, until you purchase the replacement heads.  Then you collapse in a state of shock.&lt;br /&gt;I replaced my old Philips Cool Shave as I was recharging it every 3 days and it was taking 8 hours a day to charge.&lt;br /&gt;I contemplated Braun, but I read some poor reviews on this site and others as well.&lt;br /&gt;This Panasonic model ES-LA63 is sufficient for what I required.  The model above this version (ES-LA93) has the self cleaning function.  That is OK, until you have to purchase the replacement cleaning solution.  It is a slight incremental benefit that you must consistently pay for maintenance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other comments talk about the noise that comes from the razor.  It is a non-issue.  Anything mechanical makes a noise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wet shaves are impressive.  Face and under the nose is very good in removing hair.&lt;br /&gt;The neck (LIKE ALL ELECTRICS) require time and technique.  Remember, it is just a razor.  We can&#x27;t all look like Daniel Craig after getting out of the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Being from Canada, the Amazon US site beats all retailers.  Not The Bay, Sears, Personal Edge can beat this price, even after F/X and Duties.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Delivery was impressive...Less than 48 hours, it was at my door.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Without hesitation, I would recommend this Panasonic razor to any man.  To all Canadians, make an example of our retailers and tell them to match Amazon.com prices.  There is no reason it should retailer higher in our country.</li>
    <li> Good value works well for my head, thats all i use it on hope it last long time,recharges fast hope battery last long time.</li>
    <li> Gives a close shave without neck irritation and redness I have had with other razors.  Price is way down from the original price and that is nice too.</li>
    <li> GREAT FOR CUTTING A STRAIGHT BEARD - NOT SO GOOD FOR A AREA WHERE HAIR GROWS AT AN ANGLE , I&#x27;LL GIVE IT ANOTHER WEEK</li>
    <li> At the beginning the performance was not that great, but as per other users&#x27; recommendations I decided to stick with the shaver for a little while. My skin is now sort of used to the shaver and you tend to get better results over time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As other users have mentioned, getting rid of skin hair around your neck is somewhat difficult so you need to stretch your skin to make it (it doesn&#x27;t work all the time though).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like it because it is pretty comfortable for a quick shave, though I always fallback to razors for cleaner shaves.</li>
    <li> When I started shaving there were very few options available:  single razor blades, straight-edge, disposables and a few electric models.  I tried everything.  Back then, the electric razors I tried, pulled on the hairs rather than cutting them so I gave-up on electric razors believing that my beard was just too tough for an electric to handle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s no argument that the 2, 3, 4 and 5 blade razors revolutionized shaving starting in the late 1980&#x27;s / early 1990&#x27;s.  Then came the sticker shock of the replacement blades.  But that&#x27;s the dream, right?  Create a product that everyone needs that&#x27;s disposable that they have to buy again and again.  But that&#x27;s an expensive trap for consumers...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With that said, when I researched the Panasonic, I was hesitant because of the cost.  Then, after doing the math, I realized that I spent more than that on the yearly cost of replacement blades and so bought the electric.  To be honest, even before the first shave, I was prepared to return the razor.  After my early experiences with electric razors, I didn&#x27;t have high hopes...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To my amazement and surprise - it gave me a clean and fun shave.  I actually look forward to shaving every day; I haven&#x27;t felt that way since I was a boy (you know, that time in every young boy&#x27;s life when we were all in a rush to be all grown-up).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not going to comare electric to blades because I find that comparison utterly ridiculous - and I think the reviewers here who have done so, just like the sound of their own voice.  The fact is, I&#x27;ll use a blade from time to time but for daily or ever 2x daily maintenance (the touch-up before an evening out at the theatre), I&#x27;ll be using the Panasonic.</li>
    <li> MY HUSBAND IS VERY PROUD TO HAVE THIS RAZOR.  IT MORE THAN MEETS MY EXPECTATIONS, SEEMS REALLY WELL MADE, IS POWERFUL AND GETS IT ALL!</li>
    <li> This is a beautiful and high quality shaver.  It comes with a soft, zippered form-fitting case.  I don&#x27;t think its leather, but looks like it will hold up for a long time.  I did have a shaver about 15 years ago that came with a much nicer leather custom case.  For the price of this shaver, I sort of expected one like that.  Oh well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This shaves very gently.  I&#x27;ve had ones that could easily cut into your adams apple or around your lips if you pushed too hard in those areas.  This one is very easy to wash with a drop of liquid soap and warm running water.  I find it helpful to rub some clipper oil on the inside of the cutting foil with a Q-tip after washing.  It will make the blades last much longer and provide a smoother shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am 47 years old and have owned maybe 6 or 7 electrics and this is, by far, the most effective.  Battery life is good.  I get about 5 shaves per charge.  I only use it dry, so I can&#x27;t say how it works wet or in the shower, but it says it is safe to do so.  It&#x27;s a lot of money, but a great shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are having trouble with razor bumps, and/or ingrown hairs, this may help with that problem.  This shaver will not cut hair below the skin surface.  Supposedly, even with a razor blade, you are not supposed to cut hair against the grain for this reason.  So, if you compare a shave with a blade NOT against the grain to this shaver, I think this electric does a better job.  This model has a timer on it so it tells you how long it took to shave and I average right about 5 minutes.</li>
    <li> The Panasonic ES-LA63-S Wet/Dry Shaver provides an incredibly close and comfortable shave. However, it has a few minor drawbacks. Here&#x27;s some of its pros and cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros&lt;br /&gt;----&lt;br /&gt;- Incredibly Close and Comfortable Shave&lt;br /&gt;The Panasonic shaves just about as close as traditional shaving blades. Compared to blades, this shaver definitely provides a more comfortable shave - wet or dry. There&#x27;s no need for shaving foam, although you can use it if you choose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Wet/Dry Convenience&lt;br /&gt;I usually opt for dry shaving simply because it&#x27;s more convenient, but I occasionally choose to have a wet shave for the increased comfort a wet shave provides.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Easy To Clean&lt;br /&gt;You can easily clean the shaver by rinsing it under tap water while it is running. There&#x27;s no need to crack it open to clean it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Pop-Up Trimmer&lt;br /&gt;The pop-up trimmer does as good a job as a dedicated trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Good Ergonomics&lt;br /&gt;The shaver is comfortable to hold. The back of the shaver is rubberized to help improve your grip on the shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;----&lt;br /&gt;- No Charging Dock / Cleaning Station&lt;br /&gt;This model doesn&#x27;t have a cleaning station like the [[ASIN:B0021AG0Z6 Panasonic ES8249S Arc IV Nanotech Vortex Wet/Dry Rechargeable Shaver]] does. For the price, I&#x27;d expect at least a charging dock.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Bulky Head&lt;br /&gt;The shaving head is a little on the bulky side, which makes it a little unwieldy for targeting specific areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- Additional Points&lt;br /&gt;The shaver is rather plain-looking. Besides an LCD screen with a battery indicator, there&#x27;s really not much to write home about. The build quality is descent but the shaver looks a bit too plasticky. It falls short of expectations in the aesthetics department for a shaver that costs this much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;---&lt;br /&gt;Despite a few shortcomings, I like the Panasonic ES-LA63-S Shaver for the incredibly close shave it provides and for the ease with which it can be cleaned.</li>
    <li> good product for the money ($140)</li>
    <li> Panasonic makes some good products.  A bit on the expensive side though.  The Arc4 is a nice shaver, and does a nice job if I shave every day or two.  It has trouble with my longer hairs (My facial hair grows pretty slowly, so I&#x27;m not talking very long), and requires many trips over the stubble, or even using the trimmer.  The trimmer is sized right and works well.  Easy to clean manually - I&#x27;ve not tried cleaning in water, so can&#x27;t comment.  Seems like more of a fuss to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since this is a wet/dry shaver, Panasonic correctly made it so you can&#x27;t use it corded.  Too much liability issues.  Humans are NOT the smartest animal!  The unit charges quickly, but I find it drains between 10 to 20% each shave, which takes about four minutes.</li>
    <li> This shaver is great replacement for my earlier Panasonic Arc 4 (ES-8249). In my opinion the Panasonic is still the best of the top of the line shavers. I&#x27;ve tried both of the others, the Braun 7 series and the Philips Norelco 9000 Series (though I haven&#x27;t tried the Panasonic Arc 5, don&#x27;t have an extra $400 lying around). Though the Braun is close to as good as this Panasonic, the rotary Philips I just can&#x27;t stand, hate having to make circular motions the entire time that I&#x27;m shaving. I shave dry, if I wanted the inconvenience and mess of wet shaving I&#x27;d use a blade. I think the Panasonic shaves closer, faster than the Braun.  One problem with this shaver, and the area in which it loses to the Braun is ergonomics. I thought my old Panasonic had a huge head...until I saw this one, which they&#x27;ve managed to take to an entirely new level. It&#x27;s a little hard to maneuver around the face but still the best of the top of the liners.</li>
    <li> Now that the price of this model has dropped you get an excellent shaver at a good price point!  I really like to option of using the shaver wet or dry.  The shaver does shave closer when used wet.  Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> This shaver works!!!  Really, I have a beard that requires two shaves a day.  It grows that fast. Like Tim Allen on Santa Clause.  I have had all the various versions of Braun, Remington,  and Noreclo.   Noreclo from 1974 was very good. It cut well and lasted sometime.  Of course, Noreclo was sold and the version was obsoleted.  Since 1980, I usual have changed blades every month or two and shaver every year.  I have also tried real shavers.  The beard is so thick the blades dull while shaving.    This Panasonic shaver actually cuts the beard without pull.  I have not had to push into the skin to get the beard hair.  No razor burns.  One can just lightly shave and with each pass it cuts beard not skin.  It works wet or dry.  I usually pre-soak with water ten minutes before shaving.    Clean up is great and actually keeps the shaver clean like new if you use the liquid hand soap.  The side burn cutter works great as well.    I have had the shaver for two months and have not had to replace the blades yet. I am happy!!  Shave is just as good as day one!!!</li>
    <li> Well I have used it for about a month now, it does a decent job, it only works great when using it along with a liquid like Lectric Shave. It helps keep the ingrown hairs in check, shaving with a regular razor is closer (especially on the neck) but can&#x27;t do it as often without problems. I can&#x27;t say it&#x27;s an awesome product, I had a Norelco Spectra before this and it worked equally good, but it is a better razor when used wet. I am lucky that I paid $140 for it, because at the original price of $300, it would not have been worth it!!</li>
    <li> This is a second Panasonic shaver that I&#x27;ve bought.  My first one was over 10 years old 7003 series, which served me well in the last 10 years without any blades replacement or any issue until I dropped it and broke the foil.  I haven&#x27;t used any other brand yet, but since I fell in love with the first Panasonic shaver, I decided to buy another Panasonic. It works very well, close shave, but a little bit pricey. I just hope that it&#x27;ll last me another 10 years like the other one.</li>
    <li> It is a nice and quiet wet/dry shaver. It gives shave close to a razor blade, but at the neck bones it leaves hair little bit and you may need to use a razor just for it. Long battery life, more than 8 shaves for one charge. For the price under $80 it is well worth.</li>
    <li> Purchased the Panasonic ES-LA63 in December 2010.  Gives a closer shave than my rotory shaver. (Norelco)  Has a little better battery life than my last foil type electric shaver. (Remington)  The only negitive&#x27;s are the very expensive wear parts.</li>
    <li> I have now used this shaver for sometime and it is the fourth different electric shaver I have purchased.&lt;br /&gt;The unit was shipped quickly and received in good condition.  It does not shave as well as my&lt;br /&gt;previously purchased Remington unit but does hold a longer charge.  Shaves well on sides of face&lt;br /&gt;but leaves a lot of stubble on my neck and chin.  Would not purchase another.</li>
    <li> I bought the cheaper Panasonic ES8243A about 2 years ago, upgraded the blades on that one and it worked great. I needed to upgrade the outer foil but ended up buying a whole new shaver because of my positive experience, and because I can&#x27;t resist getting the top model. This shaver is basically the same as the ES8243A with a couple of differences. First, this one has two motors: one to drive the blades, the second just vibrates the head. At first, comparatively, you don&#x27;t notice, but a third or fourth shave you can tell. The sonic element makes the shave a bit smoother and works better on the neck and jawline than the ES8243A. Secondly, the speed at which the blades reciprocate is 14,000 rpms, compared to 13,000 for the ES8243A. This is a marginal upgrade, but I assume it helps to have a smoother shave.    Overall, compared to cheaper Panasonic models, this shaver is smoother all around especially on the neck and jawline, but compare prices so that your not spending much over the ES8243A.</li>
    <li> Very good Hope to have more products to China</li>
    <li> I received this shaver last night and finally got to use it earlier today. First impressions are incredible. I had the Braun 790CC and was happy with it, but somehow came upon this shaver while looking for cleaning fluid for the Braun. The Braun cut pretty close but my face was always a little dry and dull due to the fact that I was shaving dry. When I seen that you can use shaving cream with this one and read some reviews, I was intrigued. I decided that I would take a chance on it since the price was a modest $135. My first shave was extremely close, even closer than the Braun 790CC. I&#x27;m not trying to say buy this one or that one but my experience has shown that this razor shaves slightly a bit closer. As far as cleaning, it was very easy to clean, I just ran it under some water and applied some soap and it was good to go. The Braun cleaning system was really great and I miss that aspect but I&#x27;m not complaining one bit. I know I could have paid the extra $80-90 and got the ES-LA93-K with the cleaning system but since this is a wet/dry, it&#x27;s very easy to clean. One last note, I haven&#x27;t shaved dry yet so if the results are different than the wet shave I will edit my post. With that being said, I expect very similar results.</li>
    <li> Good stuff, I like it.</li>
    <li> This is simply the best electric shaver I&#x27;ve ever used.  My beard hair grows in pretty thick and I have to shave every day for my job.  After four years, I grew tired of using foam and a manual razor every morning.  In the past I&#x27;ve used a few electric shavers but none of them worked well for me.  Some of them pulled my hair out, others simply passed over it and barely cut anything...but this shaver is outstanding.  What used to be an annoyance every morning is now something I can take care of in under two minutes.  I don&#x27;t get any irritation and the shaver cuts the hairs surprisingly close to my skin.  Is it as close as a manual razor?  No, not quite, but what electric can really claim that anyway?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this shaver to anyone and everyone.  It&#x27;s an absoutely outstanding product.</li>
    <li> This electric Razor is amazing! It charges quickly, gives an incredibly close shave, and works wet/dry! I picked it up after I saw that it won the Men&#x27;s Health Grooming Award, that helped me decide between all the identical looking razors. I have been using a Mach 3 for years and I have no desire to ever go back after using this razor, it was worth every penny.</li>
    <li> I use this shaver in wet mode only - gives me very close shaves just like a razor blade, but I don&#x27;t get any ingrown hair, unlike top of the line Braun shaver or any of the blade based ones (Gillette etc etc).    Now the bad part - the biggest issue I have with this is that it will not shave while plugged in - dry or wet.    To me it screams planned obsolescence - you will have to pay shipping (while on warranty) and wait for battery replacement, buy new battery and do the job yourself, when out of warranty or BUY NEW shaver again.    I&#x27;m sure Panasonic would explains this from electric shock perspective, but output voltage is just 6V; plus the connection looks snug enough to avoid water getting in there anyway. If not this, they they could have designed it a bit better. My point is - in 2011 this shouldn&#x27;t be an issue; and these sort of things have been solved by now.    Buy this shaver if you have a sensitive skin to use it in wet mode, preferably with oil based shaving creme/lotion; but expect to buy the next best new shaver from Panasonic in the near future again. Lather rinse repeat...</li>
    <li> I have only shaved with a razor since I learned to shave. More years ago than I would like to admit. Anyway I did my research and decided to give the Panasonic a try. I also figured I would hate it and send it back within the 30days that Panasonic gives you. Big surprise, best shave I have ever had. smoother than a razor, no nicks etc. Granted I cant compare this one to other units. I thought the Braun were too pricey and besides its not owned by them anyway its Proctor and Gamble so I have heard the quality has slipped.  The quality of the unit is top notch. Made in Japan not China.easy to clean ( I didn&#x27;t want to deal with the bulky units that clean themselves with the solution etc) Also for me 5 min I&#x27;m done.  Paid a good price here on Amazon. Give it a try I don&#x27;t think you will be disappointed.</li>
    <li> Hands down, the best wet/dry (or any) shaver I&#x27;ve owned. My original electric razor was a Panasonic and lasted over 20 years with only screen and head replacements periodically. My next three were gifts, two Norelco&#x27;s and a Braun. None lived up to their hype. I threw the last Norelco away and went back to a straight razor while researching electric rechargeable wet/dry shavers. When I read the specs and reviews for the Panasonic Arc IV, I decided to buy it based on my earliest experience with Panasonic (should have returned the other gifts and got a Panasonic in retrospect). The Arc IV gives the closest shave of any electric razor I&#x27;ve ever owned. Baby smooth feeling with minimal work, regardless of whether using in the shower or dry. I charge it once a week even though it&#x27;s only down to about 30% after 7 uses. My previous Braun was a high end with base / cleaning solution and I&#x27;ll never get another base / cleaning solution model again. Again, much hype and more work than they&#x27;re worth. This rechargeable Arc IV is the keeper. Learned my lesson. Should I replace this one, it will be with another Panasonic for sure.</li>
    <li> I previously had a braun 7 series and this shaver gets closer and is also a wet/dry shaver.  build quality on the braun is better but this one outperforms it with less irritation.</li>
    <li> I have to use a blade razor to remove the hairs on my neck that this shaver always leaves behind. The foils also get uncomfortably hot after a few seconds of shaving and I&#x27;m not pressing the foils hard on my skin. I switched to the Braun 790 and the tossed the blade razor because it&#x27;s no longer needed.</li>
    <li> Great, it does the job, simple to use, simple to clean,&lt;br /&gt;Recharges in about 5 to 10 minutes, buy it</li>
    <li> This razor does an excellent job shaving close and comfortably everywhere on your face except your neck. However, it does the best job on the neck for any electric razor that I have ever used.</li>
    <li> I bought this with the intent to use it as my day to day head and face shaver. First, this pulls very hard on your hairs if you let it grow out more than 3 days. Next, I found it very hard to get a good shave without rotating it in every single direction; its not really a huge con on the shaver as my facial hair grows different directions but its huge head did make it a little hard to get the neck. The shave was pretty much the same as a normal shave. I didn&#x27;t use it in water; I always get worried something will happen but I do clean it by running water through the blades and it did an amazing job except it does splash a bit. Lastly, I switched from a rotary shaver to a foil. I found that using the foil made my face itch and gave me lots of razor bumps which a rotary did not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ultimately, I used this razor&#x27;s 30 day trial before I gave it the boot and switched back to a rotary.</li>
    <li> So I got this for my dad for Christmas and he says that: \\&quot;It&#x27;s not bad, but there are certain angles that this razor can&#x27;t seem to shave cleanly. All in all, it&#x27;s ok.\\&quot;</li>
    <li> I could not be happier with this shaver from Panasonic.  I have used Braun shavers in the past, but purchased this unit because of its wet/dry capabilities.  Well made, well engineered, and a great shave.</li>
    <li> I spent two days researching shavers. First I found out that a person who shaves regularly is better off with a foil shaver than a rotary shaver. I saw reviews, checked out this and that, and even went and looked at a few.  Finally I just bit the bullet and bought the number one on consumers reports and I am really, really glad I did.  It charges fast, lasts a long time on a charge, really cuts clean, like you were using a blade, does not cut or pinch and does not miss anything you send it over.  It does not need lots of moving here and there and back and forth.  Just run it over as if you were using a blade.  And super easy to clean!  My goodness!  Way better than my Philips Norelco rotary (but it did last me 6 years without trouble till the top of it broke). It does not come with a stand and I wasn&#x27;t happy about that, but it stays where you put it on a shelf.</li>
    <li> I have been buying electric razors for more than 45 years, and this razor is hands down the first one to live up to its hype! I have most recently tried the near top of the line Braun, Norelco and in the past Remington. I first tried this shaver on about 2.5 days of stubble, and I felt this was not going to be a fair first trial, but it just mowed right through without any pulling! Honest, this is the only shaver I have ever had that literally delivers a blade-close shave, with just one or two passes! With the Norelco and Braun I had to go over an area 3 or 4 times to get even passable results. I can use a razor but it irritates my skin and makes my beard too heavy, so this electric is a revelation. I expect it is the dual motor technology and nanotech blades. On top of the amazing smooth shave, this really must cut below the skin since my beard takes longer to re-emerge than with other razors. I did not get the fancy cleaning system, not needed, this is easy to clean with a simple razor brush; I would not use water or shaving cream, not needed, it does not irritate! I cannot recommend this razor more highly! With this razor I can see keeping it forever and just buying new blades if needed. Don&#x27;t waste your money on the others or the cheaper Panasonic, this new technology has got the electric razor challenge nailed!</li>
    <li> best shaver I have ever used</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin and course facial hair. This razor is not that great. Work great on my actual face but my chin and neck it sucks greatly. It actually burned my neck. For now I use this for my actual face and use fusion proglide for my neck. Still looking for the a good razor.</li>
    <li> This shaver is the finest shaver I have ever owned.  It is a bit expensive but the quality of the shave makes the cost worth it.  It is technologically advanced and will even tell you when the head needs to be cleaned, how long it took you to shave and what is the remaining battery strength in percentage rather than a series of lines.  Can be used wet or dry but dry seems to get me the closest shave but that may just be because of my beard.  I have a medium type of beard and this shaver will shave it to a very close shave without any problems even if I do not shave for 4 or 5 days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are a couple of cons to the shaver.  First it is big and bulky.  The size makes you have to turn it a bit to get it to shave up next to your ears on sideburns and also in trimming around your beard if you have one.  Second the motor noise is high pitched and will make you want to finish shaving as fast as possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With that said it is still a great shaver.</li>
    <li> This is an outstanding razor, particularly for the price.  I have found that the truly expensive electric razors, whether by Braun, or whomever, are clearly NOT worth the price.  Moreover, one must realize that straight, safety, or disposable razors will always provide a closer shave.  Another advantage with this razor is that it cleans very easily (easier than a disposable), and it can be used wet or dry.  So you can use regular soap if you please, and in the shower if that&#x27;s your gig.  All said, I&#x27;d highly recommend this razor.</li>
    <li> I received the Panasonic ES-LA63-S Arc 4 electric shaver last week. After a few days of using it (dry shave), I can say that this is the best electric shaver I have ever owned. I was a life-long Remington user, but I love this new Panasonic shaver so much I doubt I will ever return to Remington. It shaves very, very close and most importantly doesn&#x27;t irritate my very sensitive skin at all! Finally a close, pain-free shave! The thing feels very impressive in my hand and produces a very quiet, almost laser-like shave. My old Remington Titanium MS3-2700 beat my skin up and missed many hairs on the neck area. The Panasonic ES-LA63-S Arc 4 makes it look like a piece of junk by comparison. I will let my skin continue to adapt to it before trying out a wet shave. So far an excellent purchase and WELL WORTH they money I paid for it.</li>
    <li> I was so happy whe I got it, plus I was doing research about shavers for a long time and it was good raeting, it look so nice and design was good Made in Japan so it made me fell secure, but the moment I start using that shaver it was puling my hair out  it felt like I was getting wax another thing why I got that wax shaver because it was on sale for $ 109 , but after I used I will not pay even $49 , that&#x27;s why it dosed keep the value from $300 it went 61 percent down good products never will drop like that , so I&#x27;m returning tomorrow</li>
    <li> My old Panasonic razor finally started to peter out on me after nearly 10 years of daily use, so I did some research and bought the ES-LA63-S as a replacement.  It&#x27;s pretty big, but does a great job at shaving me close and doing it quickly. Normally, one or 2 passes and an area is clean-shaven. As another reviewer mentioned, the razor will run for another week or two once you hit 10% battery left, and overall the battery life is very good (I charge mine about once a month or so).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OK, for the nitpicky things I do not like about this otherwise excellent razor:&lt;br /&gt;-- like every other razor I&#x27;ve used, getting my neck clean takes a little time and effort, but a lot less irritation than any other razor I&#x27;ve used&lt;br /&gt;-- the blinking blue light on charge is annoying&lt;br /&gt;-- no stand included with this razor, so I end up laying it on a washcloth on my sink&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, a great razor.  I have very sensitive skin and razor burn has been minimal to nonexistant from the get-go. I dry shave only, so I have no clue how well it holds up wet shaving or via shaving in the shower.</li>
    <li> When the price of Mach III blades went above $1.50 on ebay I decided a change was in order.  I switch to double edged blades.  Got great shaves.  Smooth as a baby&#x27;s butt.  But, it&#x27;s slow, prone to nicks and sometimes irritating.  Cost of blades is $.10 to $.30 so that was no problem.  But I found that I shaved less and less as it is not the most enjoyable of experiences.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After reading the glowing reviews of this shaver I decided to give it a try.  Right out of the box I was converted.  I don&#x27;t get a baby&#x27;s butt shave but it is certainly good enough and if I want to really grind it out I can get a pretty good shave.  I love the fact that cleaning is just running a bit of liquid soap and tap water when the shaver alerts you.  The shaver also lets me know when I need to recharge it, which it does in less then an hour.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I keep the shaver at my desk and pick it up whenever.  No fuss, no mess.  Now, I don&#x27;t mind shaving at all.  Can do it anywhere, anytime.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product.  10 stars!!!!!</li>
    <li> Just opened the box over the weekend. Initial thoughts are - WOW!  I couldn&#x27;t praise the old model enough.  This one cuts even closer and is even more comfortable.  I have a very thick beard that grows very quickly.  This razor makes short work of it and causes no irritation to my sensitive skin.  Another great product from Panasonic.  Thanks for not changing a good thing too much.  I do like the additional degree of movement on the head.  This is now the best electric I have ever used.</li>
    <li> I did a fair amount of research before making this purchase and overall this razor does a fine job for less than 3 days of growth. I&#x27;m a bit annoyed by the sound level of the BUZZ which is only squelched by using it in the shower. Battery life is enough for about 1hr of continuous shaving or 4 shaves. cleaning is  easy and I like the dual direction rotating head. I have used straight razors most of my life and if you spend enough time with this razor its hard to distinguish between the two types of shaves. In hindsight razor is a bit pricey but I&#x27;m not necessarily regretting the purchase.</li>
    <li> Bought this with high expectations that it would solve all my problems with shaving .. but unfortunately, even though this product seems to have so many positive reviews, it does not shave well in all areas. The first time I used, I was disspointed because it could not remove all the hair in the neck area. I thought of returning it, but amazon&#x27;s return policy is nowadays a big hassle. They will charge you for shipping if you are returning the product if you do not like it. So I planned to try it for some more time and later just forgot to return and decided to live with it&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first impression when I saw it was \\&quot;its huge\\&quot;. The head is really big. I had tried a norelco before tis which I had returned and when I saw this, the head of this shaver looks double the size of Norelco shavers&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this for almost 3 months now. I use it almost daily for around 3-4 minutes. This product does not remove all the hair and I have to use a razor under my chin and the neck area to remove all hairs. I also have to go back and forth multiple times in all angles to try and get a smooth shave in other areas&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cleaning is easy .. just wash, wipe and leave it to dry .. you do not have to worry about water falling on any circuits and spoiling it&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;if you use the shaver for 2-3 minutes, you will feel the blade heating up. I do not know whether this ia flaw, but it does not heat up so much that it becomes uncomfortable. So I am ok with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Charging does not take too much time .. I think around an hours or so .. I get to shave atleast 5-6 times (avg 5 minutes) before it reaches around 10% of charge and that is when I usually recharge&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product is a little heavy than what I expected .. maybe because of the large shaving head that I mentioned above.&lt;br /&gt;The popup trimmer is sometimes difficult to open up, esp if your hand is wet. This trimmer is also not very good in getting hair when you want to trim your mustache orside burns .. it helps in trimming, but does not help in getting the lines properly upto the skin .. what I mean, you cannot use it the way you would use a razor to get the side-burn lines .. not sure whether any of the trimmer does that or not .. But I have seen the trimmers that the barbershops use that does that very neatly and I expected this to work that way too ..</li>
    <li> I bought this razor to replace my old norelco but what what was very noticable was that while shaving all of the shavings rain down onto the counter or sink like a fine brown powder. It gives a great shave but leaves my white sink coated with shavings. My old norelco never did that.</li>
    <li> I owned an older Panasonic razor, but eventually the battery died and I just trashed it and went back to wet-shaving.  When it came time to acquire a new one I looked at both the Braun and Panasonic but never took the plunge.  When the Amazon Vine program offered the Panasonic I knew I wanted it.    I&#x27;ve used this new Panasonic razor primarily wet in the shower.  It works great there, very smooth shave, no pulling, no irritation.  I just use a regular shave cream with it.    I&#x27;ve also tried it dry, with an electric pre-shave.  While the end result was ok, the shave wasn&#x27;t as comfortable and my face was a little red.  It faded quickly, but just wasn&#x27;t as comfortable for me.    The shaver itself has a huge head, but it is easy enough to maneuver it around and I didn&#x27;t have any problems getting the area on my upper lip close to my nose.  It doesn&#x27;t come with a cleaning base, like my older Panasonic had, but it is simple enough to squirt some soap on it and activate the cleaning mode.    Overall I&#x27;m not sure I would spend close to $300 for this model when the lower cost ones do the job just as well.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried many different electric razors over the past 15 years, whether it was from Braun, Norelco, or Remington.  Prior to testing the Panasonic ES-LA63-S I had been using a Braun Cruzer.  After using the ES-LA63-S for 3 weeks, I can definitely say it&#x27;s the closest shave I&#x27;ve ever had with an electric razor.&lt;br /&gt;The Panasonic ES-LA63-S has two motors and two blade sets housed inside a giant shaver head that contains three foils and a hair lifter/comb piece.  The shaver head really is big, which is a strength and a weakness of the unit.  The head of the unit tilts to accommodate the contours of your chin and neck, but you can also lock the head in place so it does not tilt.  In addition, there is a pop up trimmer on the unit for sideburns and such.  The ES-LA63-S has a fairly large blue LED screen on the handle that tells you how much battery power is remaining, how long your shaving session lasted, whether the battery is being charged and if the cleaning mode is on.  The shaver feels solid and heavy in your hand--in a good way.  The construction of it makes it feel like it will have no durability issues.  This Panasonic also comes with an AC adapter and a very basic carrying case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cleaning the unit is pretty easy, and is probably has the best electric shaver cleaning system that I&#x27;ve ever seen.  To clean you place several small drops of liquid hand soap across the top of the foils and then hold down the power button in order to enter \\&quot;turbo mode.\\&quot;  The blades vibrate really fast and lather up the foils and blades themselves.  You let that run for 20 seconds, stop and then rinse.  The foil cover comes off easily so you can rinse out the entire head, inside and out.  Works way better than having to use those mini-brushes that inexpensive shavers come with, and it&#x27;s far cheaper than having to buy replacement cleaning cartridges for some other shavers, like several of the Braun series.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ES-LA63-S covers a lot of surface area in one motion and cuts hairs really close for an efficient shave.  The timer says most of my shaves last about 3 minutes.  I tried it both wet and dry, and I prefer to use it dry after a shower.  The first week that I used this shaver I noticed an increased occurrence in ingrown hairs on my face.  I think my skin was adjusting to the new, closer shave though, because after that first week I haven&#x27;t had any complications with my skin.  The shave is remarkably smooth, however, and I think it holds up well compared to a standard disposable razor.  The only limitation is the giant shaver head size.  If you have neat facial hair it is difficult to trim around it while manipulating the blades due to the oversized head.  As a result, I now shave most of my face with the Panasonic and then take 30 seconds to trim up the sides of my goatee with my old Cruzer.  If you have complex facial hair you&#x27;ll probably need to develop a similar method to maintain straight lines of a beard or &#x60;stache.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, the ES-LA63-S provides a surprisingly good, close shave.  I knock it down to four stars because it&#x27;s not great for maintaining facial hair patterns, and at $300, you probably want your shaver to brush your teeth for you as well.  If you don&#x27;t have facial hair and you can swallow the $300 price tag, you&#x27;ll be hard pressed to find a better electric shaver.close for an efficient shave.

    <li> The Panasonic ES-LA63 is fairly unusual for a high end electric shaver: unlike its competitors, it does not come bundled with fancy ultrasonic cleaning and charging stations, does not have a built-in lotion dispenser... The box just contains the shaver itself, a world-compatible charger, and a soft case.    The shaver itself does not have all sorts of complicated settings, either: just an on/off button and a three position switch (floating head, locked head, trimmer). Its only concession to the high end is a nifty blue LCD display that shows the amount of time in use and a remaining time estimate. The power button can also be locked by a slider to prevent unwanted activation when traveling.    The trimmer is a bit of a disappointment: it&#x27;s hidden by the large shaving head, so you can&#x27;t really see what you&#x27;re doing with it, rendering it useless unless you&#x27;re doing large areas.. unfortunately it&#x27;s too narrow to be really useful for that type of job. Bottom line, if you need a trimmer, buy a $20 Wahl at Target: this one won&#x27;t... er... cut it.    The large shaving head is also a problem if you need any sort of accuracy, because it&#x27;s always hiding what you&#x27;re doing.  All these minor problems are eclipsed by the amazing quality of the shave: as close a shave as you would get from a mechanical razor, and absolutely none of the redness or pain you would get from an electric shaver. I have never seen this type of results from an electric shaver before.    Cleaning is a breeze: pop the head cover, rinse the head and cover under the tap and air dry.    CONS  ----  * Large, can be cumbersome and lacks accuracy (not very good for trimming facial hair)  * Useless trimmer  * Expensive    PROS  ----  * World compatible charger  * Floating head effortlessly follows face contour  * Amazingly efficient and close shave without pressure, pain, redness or irritation  * Easy cleaning    CONCLUSION  ----------  The ES-LA63 is a no-frills shaver, but it puts the emphasis where it really counts: a close, comfortable and painless shave, the best I&#x27;ve ever had by a long shot. I&#x27;d much rather have that than a gimmicky self-cleaning stand, especially when cleaning is such a quick and easy procedure. Very highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Excellent shaver, best electric one Ive used. Very comfortable to use and easy to clean. My only complaint would be the shaving head is a little too big and does not offer much precision. I still prefer the rotary head of the Norelcos but its more of a personal preference. The Panasonic does the job just fine, if not better. Also its pretty expensive, dont think your average joe would spend so much on an electric shaver. However its nice to see that for the price it is Made in Japan, which I would expect in higher end electronics. If you are willing spend the money the Panasonic ES-LA63-S will deliver.</li>
    <li> Panasonic product is not new for me. I have been using a Panasonic \\&quot;[[ASIN:B000VKZMHK Panasonic ES8109S Vortex Wet/Dry Shaver with Nano Technology and HydraClean System]]\\&quot; Wet/Dry Shaver for about a year. The price is about half of ES-LA63-S.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This shaver is larger, bulkier, and a little heavier than ES8109, but it has an additional head designed to cover more shaving area. In my experience, both can do the job with little difference. Sometimes, due to its size, ES-LA63 missed some spots. ES-LA63 has a neat feature of \\&quot;self-clean\\&quot; by putting a few drops of liquid soap and set it to clean. I think this feature is not available on ES8109 (it requires a separate cleaning system).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My most positive comment about Panasonic is the adapter can be used in 110 and 220 Volt. This is very useful if you traveled to Europe and Asia.</li>
    <li> I go back and forth between regular razor blades and electric shaver.  The electric shaver I used before Panasonic ES-LA63-S (LAMDASH) was Norelco 8891XL that I purchased a few years ago for about a hundred.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was impressed with Panasonic ES-LA63-S as it provides an excellent shave.  It is feels very comfortable in my hand.  The floating head is fantastic, it moves easily and is always at the correct angle.  I noticed that after using Panasonic I had less irritation on my neck than after using Norelco.  Panasonic ES-LA63-S is quite a bit larger than Norelco but lighter and feels more comfortable in my hand.  I noticed that with Panasonic it takes me just over three minutes to shave, while with Norelco it normally takes about six minutes.  Wet/dry shaving is a nice feature, but I use electric razors for dry shaving only.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunatey, Panasonic ES-LA63-S did not come with a charging station, which is a nice feature of Norelco.  For the price, I expected one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, the high price of the shaver and replacement blades and screens makes it just an OK value.  At the current price, it is three times pricier than my old Norelco, but the quality of shave is not three times higher.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE 6/17/10:  I finally decided to try wet shaving with electric razors.  Again, Panasonic LA63 outperformed Norelco 8891XL significantly, although it is still difficult to justify the price.  Panasonic LA63 would make an excellent present.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used a lot of electric shavers over the years, including some of the higher end Remington, Braun and Panasonic units. I mostly used them to avoid getting nicks on my chin. However none of them have done a good enough job on my neck, so I usually used a manual razor on the neck and sides and the electric shave in the goatee area. I was both apprehensive and hopeful about moving up from my [[ASIN:B00176V2SK Panasonic ES8228S Men&#x27;s Linear Vortex Nano Arc Foil Shaving System, Silver]] because compared to it, this thing is a jumbo jet. It has a much bigger shaving area, and has a higher rpm motor which hums confidently when you turn it on. It took about two weeks for me to get my face to adapt for a similar shave quality and after about a month I&#x27;ve found that it gives me a much better shave than any of my previous shavers. It&#x27;s razor close on most of my face and it has even gotten the cross grained hairs on my neck into presentable fashion (not as close as a blade, but respectable). It is much larger than my last shaver (I&#x27;ve uploaded some comparison photos), so it did take some getting used to, especially on the upper lip. Overall I&#x27;m very happy with it, and even though it doesn&#x27;t come with a cleaning station like my last Panasonic razor, I don&#x27;t really miss it since the recommended liquid soap and water method works very well, it&#x27;s easy and a lot quicker and quieter than the base station.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS&lt;br /&gt;- Works great wet or dry&lt;br /&gt;- Gets cross grained hair down to respectable levels&lt;br /&gt;- Easy cleanup&lt;br /&gt;- Long Battery Life (10-14 days)&lt;br /&gt;- Power lock switch so it won&#x27;t accidentally turn on during travel (I had this happen once on an old shaver)&lt;br /&gt;- Easy to read LCD with wash reminders, time used, and percentage of battery left (10% increments)&lt;br /&gt;- Multi-directional pivoting head&lt;br /&gt;- Fast and strong motor reduces the number of passes&lt;br /&gt;- Large surface with 4 blades (but only two inside driving 2 more in the foil)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS&lt;br /&gt;- Small soft sided travel bag can&#x27;t fit charger (although you won&#x27;t need it for most trips)&lt;br /&gt;- Large shaving area takes some getting used to on smaller areas like the upper lip&lt;br /&gt;- Without the base you don&#x27;t have a \\&quot;home\\&quot; for the unit and you do have to remember to charge it.&lt;br /&gt;- Maybe price is a bit steep compared to others, but if you get it on sale it&#x27;s a good deal.ou won&#x27;t need it for most trips)  - Large shaving area takes some getting used to on smaller areas like the upper lip  - Without the base you don&#x27;t have a \\&quot;home\\&quot; for the unit and you do have to remember to charge it.  - Maybe price is a bit steep compared to others, but if you get it on sale it&#x27;s a good deal.</li>
    <li> Terrific shave, even without shave cream</li>
    <li> Perfect product. I have been using this fpur years now wet and dry no problem just change the blade  a year and it works fine</li>
    <li> i love it  so good!!!!!!!!!!!1</li>
    <li> Recommend a good product to buy</li>
    <li> This shaver lasted 8 months until the battery started to die.  Then, it just decided to not even turn on.  Customer service was a joke.  You would think for such a profitable company they would have decent customer service by now.  I&#x27;m not even going to get into that.  I will never buy anything panasonic again.  Piece....of....crap.  For t w o hundred plus dollars I expected much more.  My norelco that I have had since 2000 STILL WORKS!  How about that.  I&#x27;ve come to the conclusion that anythings quality made newer is down the hill.  Really start doing some research before you by anything these days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This thing doesn&#x27;t even work when plugged in.  If you run out of battery while shaving then you out of luck.  What a pile.</li>
    <li> The jury is still out!  I have only used it sparingly for a month.  I do like the ease of cleaning.</li>
    <li> This Panasonic ES-LA63-S Men&#x27;s Shaver is a high performance shaver, but I cannot honestly give a better rating due to the high initial cost and maintenance cost.  I have used a few electric shavers in my life and am using a manual blade razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;This shaver is easy to clean compares to my older electric shavers: a simple rinse under running water or in the water will do.  Many other electric shavers require more labor-intensive cleaning procedure.  I believe the ease of cleaning is its best attribute.  It is quiet for an electric shaver.  It has a large head, but it is light and nimble.  The shaver head can be set for free movement or locked.  The performance is good for an electric shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;This shaver is sold at $300, which is the advertised price when I wrote this review (hoepfully it will come down).  It is better than a typical $50-$100 shaver, but not by that much.  I disagree with other reviews which claim it shaves as close as a blade razor.  In my experience, this is false.  I ran this electric shaver through my face 5-6 times (dry or wet) and there are still hairs above the skin.  Then when I ran a blade razor across, it shaved them all off.  If you are hoping for an electric shaver which can cut as close as a razor, then this is not it.  I don&#x27;t even think this electric shaver cut much closer to the skin than typical electric shavers.  The outer foil ($60) is recommended to be replaced every year and the inner blade ($20) is recommended to be replaced every two years.  This is $70 maintenance cost per year, and even if you double the duration between replacements, it is still $35 per year.  Potential buyers should take this long term financial commitment into account.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the end, this shaver is marginally better than its competitors, but the initial price and upkeeping cost are high.  This is not a bad electric shaver if you have the money to spare.  However, you will not find dramatic differences between this electric shaver and a typical $50-100 electrical shaver.ypical $50-100 electrical shaver.</li>
    <li> I have been using electric shavers for my entire adult life, mostly Norelcos with an occasional foil type shaver (Eltron, Panasonic, Porsche) thrown in for good measure.  I have always been aware that I was not getting the closest possible shave, but I was too lazy to want to bother with the mess of a razor.  But now that I own the new Panasonic Lamdash (ES-LA63-S,) I no longer feel that I am missing out on anything.  This is one powerful shaver.  I can now get a much closer shave in 3 minutes than I could in 6 minutes with my most recent Norelco.  No longer is it necessary to go over the same spots again and again with little to show for it, especially in the neck area.  I love the fact that the battery puts out full power right until the point when it runs out of charge, not like other shavers that gradually lose power over the course of a charge.    Can the Panasonic shave as close as a blade?  I cannot answer that directly, because I have not compared the two.  I can only say that in order to get a closer shave with a blade, I would have to remove a significant portion of my epidermis, and why would I want to do that?</li>
    <li> This is a Great Shaver !    Pretty close to a manual one    My husband never uses anything other than a manual but he gave this a shot and was in for a real surprise    Best of all he could use it wet    Easy to charge    Dual voltage so he can use it anywhere    I think this was a great gift for him    Expensive no doubt but worth it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve experimented with electric razors for years. I have a pretty thick beard, and sensitive skin, and trying to find a lasting, close shave for over 20 years has been next to impossible. Shaving against the grain with a standard x-amount of blades razor is too painful, and usually precludes shaving for a day or two until the irritation goes away. I even tried a straight razor shave at Art of the Shave, and horrified the poor woman who painstakingly tried her best to reduce the mess/discomfort. Electric razors throughout the years would burn, and were awful in removing hair from my neck. In the past few years I&#x27;ve tried newer razors from Norelco and Braun, with the same basic results - and got tired of funky cleaning systems and having to buy special solutions for the razors. Being a sucker for yet another electric do-dad, I had to jump on the opportunity when this appeared as a Vine Voice option.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After 5 weeks of using this razor, it has become my everyday razor for several reasons, which I hope to get across below.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first thing that grabbed my attention is that it&#x27;s a no-nonsense razor. The box includes the razor, a nice travel pouch, a cord and instructions - no funky charging/cleaning base, no cleaning cartridges or other solutions. Cleaning instructions are to use water and liquid soap, so just about any modern day bathroom (public or private) is equipped to clean this razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next was the ability to use it with water and shaving cream - just like a standard, x-bladed cartridge razor. It isn&#x27;t until the first time you really try this when you realize that is really modern shaving - comfortable, quick and effective. The razor glides over your skin smoothly, unlike the older dry shave days of electrics (I realize there have been razors that have done this for a while - this was my first time trying it), no burn, no cuts or nicks as with cartridge razors. When you seem to be losing effectiveness, a quick dip of the shaver head in running water cleans the blades and starts fresh - again, just like \\&quot;normal\\&quot; shaving. I had no problems with changing the angles I used to shave in order to get most (but still not some problem areas) on my neck and jawline (which are quickly cleaned up with a cartridge razor). Then a quick clean with the soap and water, final rinse and drying, and in about the same time I&#x27;d take for a normal shave, I had an easier, and closer shave with no burn, nicks or other irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought it was just the first day, and expected the typical electric razor problems to crop up over the next week. Each day I used it proved it to be the same experience - quick, easy, painless. The battery easily lasts for over a week of shaves (I recharge it once a week or so), and charges completely within 2 hours or so. It&#x27;s a great razor for travelling - lock the head, charge it, and put it in the travel case. If necessary, bring the cord with you and you&#x27;re set for a longer trip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Quick, full charges.&lt;br /&gt;Ability to work with water/shaving cream.&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;As close as a catridge razor\\&quot; shave&lt;br /&gt;No charging/cleaing base&lt;br /&gt;No typical electric razor irritation&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Power button is easy to hit while shaving&lt;br /&gt;Still misses small areas of the necke blades and starts fresh - again, just like \\&quot;normal\\&quot; shaving. I had no problems with changing the angles I used to shave in order to get most (but still not some problem areas) on my neck and jawline (which are quickly cleaned up with a cartridge razor). Then a quick clean with the soap and water, final rinse and drying, and in about the same time I&#x27;d take for a normal shave, I had an easier, and closer shave with no burn, nicks or other irritation.

Pros:  Quick, full charges.  Ability to work with water/shaving cream.  \\&quot;As close as a catridge razor\\&quot; shave  No charging/cleaing base  No typical electric razor irritation    Cons:  Power button is easy to hit while shaving  Still misses small areas of the neck</li>
    <li> Best electric razor I&#x27;ve used since my first one 25 years ago.  Close shaves with no skin irritation...cleaning is a snap and it gives me about 8 or 9 shaves before re-charging.</li>
    <li> Gret razor. My husbands favorite razor ever, so far.</li>
    <li> Functions worse than cheap $20 shavers.</li>
    <li> Very nice razor. Close shave. Great price. Fast shipping. Quality transaction.</li>
    <li> The Panasonic shaver performed well and produced a close shave comparable to the top of line Braun shaver I use.  The shave head tends to be a bit bulky, but its articulating head helps to remedy this a bit.  The one big advantage to this shaver as opposed to a Braun system is that it is a wet/dry and can be rinsed under the sink with relative ease.  You do not need to buy cleaning cartridges - just run under water and it&#x27;s done.  I am not sure if the current retail price makes it worth buying over the competition.</li>
    <li> In a nutshell, very impressed.    I compared this shaver (Panasonic ES-LA63-S Men&#x27;s Shaver) to one of those Norelcos with triple-head circular blades. I conducted the half/half face test. The result? Panasonic: 1 - Norelco: - 0. The Panasonic provided a much closer shave; on the verge of \\&quot;smooth as a baby&#x27;s behind\\&quot; close.     What&#x27;s in the box: Shaver with plastic blade cover that snaps on, battery charger (AC cord), and a pleather (emphasis on the \\&quot;P\\&quot; in \\&quot;pleather\\&quot;) fitted case.     More pluses: Its swiveling head contours your face and neck and it fits nicely in your hand. Even though it&#x27;s a little larger than I expected, it is still lightweight and easy to use. You don&#x27;t need to read a huge manual to figure it out (always a huge plus for me!). And yes, it has a trimmer on the back. Oh yeah, and it&#x27;s wet/dry.    A couple of things I wish were different: It probably isn&#x27;t the best choice for you if you have very sensitive skin. It gives such a close shave that those with skin issues might find it irritating, at least when using it dry. Also, it&#x27;s a little loud. After an average shave, you might find your ears ringing. (OK, it&#x27;s not THAT loud, but pretty dang loud for a little shaver.) Finally, the pricetag is pretty steep, imo. Better accessories in-box might make it feel worth it. How about a cleaning brush, at least?     Overall, it&#x27;s a great shaver. I know it&#x27;s not all about the accessories that come with it, though they&#x27;d be nice add-ons. It gets an A+ for the essentials: You get a very close shave, and it charges quickly and efficiently.</li>
    <li> I have own many of this . This time i followed the majority that recommended this product .&lt;br /&gt;Happy with the product .</li>
    <li> I wanted to like this but I also own a Panasonic ES-LT71-S and feel it does a better job.  The head on the ES-LA63-S was huge compared to the ES-LT71-S even though the blades and cutting area were about the same size.  This one seems to have a lot of unnecessary bulk.  After using this I went back to the ES-LT71-S and could hear it shaving what was missed.  I ended up returning this because it wasn&#x27;t shaving as close and the large head made it feel awkward.  It seems well made but just too big.</li>
    <li> VERY GOOD KEEP BUYING FORM YOU.</li>
    <li> The first thing I should say is that you can get as close as you want. Closer than a blade, because with a blade if you add pressure, you get nicks and cutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do you want to get so close that your skin will feel extremely raw? Do you want to get even further beyond where you start bleeding? Even further beyond, I&#x27;ve gotten so close that I&#x27;ve taken out my epidermis, my skin is raw to the bone and I have no hair, smoother than a babies behind; their legs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How quick is the shave? Well if you just want a quick shave, this thing will give it to you. I got a good shave in less than a minute. At 14,000 micro-vibrations you can basically get a good shave in a minute. Very fast, very quick, very impressive. The head is huge, so that means you can cover a lot of ground in a short amount of time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do you want a comfortable shave? Dang, this thing is very very comfortable.  It felt like I was rubbing my face with a cloud. Yes, the blades spin that fast that it feels like you&#x27;ve got some kind of cloudy heat pad on your face. Rubbing it up and down, no irritations, very comfortable. Now if you shave for a while, it will get hot. And, if you shave for a while, your skin will get raw and a little irritated. All depending on how close you want to get. Basically, you won&#x27;t get any irritations if you shave quick; for those with sensitive skin, do not shave for a long period of time. This shaver is very good for sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does it clean? Yes, put liquid soap on the top, run for a few seconds, and run it under the water. The shaver comes with instructions on how to properly clean. I will also take the top off and rinse off the blades; accidentally hit the blades to the sink while they were on; ouch. It still works though. Then soak the top in alcohol if you want, or set to dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The neck? \\&quot;Conquered the skies, conquered Mount Everest, conquered the moon, CONQUERED the neck,\\&quot; (Phillips commercial) But, the Panasonic es-la63-s also conquers the neck.  I&#x27;m going to be honest, it does take a while to shave the neck, but it gets very close, I was surprised. I had to pull back some of my skin and shave in 100 different directions, but I finally got all of the neck and the only hair remaining is the Adam&#x27;s apple which is too sensitive to shave to the bone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has an LCD screen that tells you how long you have been shaving. And, don&#x27;t worry about dropping it because it has an incredible grip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Last comments, don&#x27;t shave in the shower, you can if you want, but my experience was that the water slowed down the blades and couldn&#x27;t get a good shave. You can use shaving cream to shave though, the blades won&#x27;t slow down unless you run it through water which includes the shower. Also, my hair type is fast growing hair, not very rough or tough, but still a bit of a challenge. This blade didn&#x27;t slow down when cutting my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR!!!onest, it does take a while to shave the neck, but it gets very close, I was surprised.

    <li> I&#x27;ve used top line Braun and Norelco, but this is something else!!!&lt;br /&gt;The BEST RAZOR money can buy!!!  That is all I gotta say.  Using this razor with Gel on my face felt so natural...it almost felt like I was using my manual razor!  Thank u Panasonic for making this unit.  I won&#x27;t have to buy March 3 Turbo no more!&lt;br /&gt;If u r contemplating on getting this, then get it!!!</li>
    <li> This is my third Panasonic shaver that I&#x27;ve owned over the past many years.  Without any question, this is the best shaver I have ever used.  With just a stroke or two the area is cleanly shaven and I am done with my shave in about  one and a half minutes.  My neck has been the biggest challenge for getting a clean shave with an electric and this unit does it like a dream.  It is the quietest shaver I&#x27;ve used and overall am very pleased.  My only quibble is the overall size of the foil/shave head.  It is bigger so learning how to shave the upper lip and beneath the nose was different, but it isn&#x27;t that big of a problem.  I have never used a rotary shaver and cannot make any comparison to that style, but for the foil style, this thing is great.</li>
    <li> I was excited when I first saw that my favorite shaver had been updated with several improvements. Upon first use, I was very disappointed. Those perceived improvements weren&#x27;t a reality for me. It does not cut as close as the ES8243A that I currently have. Once I shave with the Arc IV, I go over it again and pick up more stubble with the ES8243A.    It&#x27;s now been well over a month of use and the ES8243A still picks up what the Arc IV cannot get. The ES8243A feels much closer just from using it. It&#x27;s motor even sounds faster, like a V6 turbo to a V6 regular. The Arc IV is also much larger and harder to maneuver too.    Do yourself a favor and save some $$$ and buy the older model, or if you don&#x27;t believe me, try both and see for yourself. The difference is quite easily noticeable.</li>
    <li> Actually, I have chosen this shaver after reading many reviews on the Internet. I have to say it&#x27;s awesome. As promised - the best shaver ever. Worth money payed.</li>
    <li> I have been using razor blades for a long time. This one is easier to use however after 3 weeks, it still misses one or two hair here and there.</li>
    <li> Two years of use, it is still doing well.  Panasonic knows how to excel in Dry and Wet use category.  Been using their different models since 1992.  The models with Linear motors like this one are much better performers.  The blades and foil combo are about half the price of the whole unit.  That is why I sometimes decide to buy a newer model then pay to buy the replacement blades.  I never had to replace any of them because they stopped working.  It was always because a newer model made much more sense.</li>
    <li> Previously (for over 42 years) I only shaved with a safety razor and shaving cream. I had tried a couple of electric razors and was left wondering how anyone could choose it over a blade. Then I discovered how the Panasonic Razors can be used either wet or dry. And due to the 13,000 vibrational speed adverised to allow a closer and more comfortable shaving experience I decide to take a leap of faith by purchasing my first Panasonic. Well, it has now been three years of satisfying shaves. Therefore, I ordered this razor so that I may use my previous 3-year old model as a backup (one never knows when a razor will reach its limit of operation, even though it has performed very well and with absolutely no problems--it runs just as strong as the very first day of operation).     One important thing: I have very sensitive skin, with a medium to tough beard, growing in a pelthera of directions (a combination that usually spells red, irritated skin). My first Panasonic Razor did so well in addressing this issue that I then ordered this razor (14,000 vibrations vs. 13,000 vibrations of the older model). What an amazingly smooth and comfortable shave (and I shave dry, not wet). I was simply amazed how much closer it shaved. In fact, I kept rubbing my hand over the smooth texture of my skin -- the results were just that pleasant.    Let&#x27;s face it: There is no electric shaver that shaves as close as a razor in one simple pass. After the first pass (with only slight pressure)I then feel which direction my bread grows in the particular area being addressed. I place a little more pressure on the next pass while going against the growth pattern, and repeat the proceedure (if needed) with just slightly more pressure. The biggest mistake any first-time-user makes is pressing so hard on the first pass because they want it to be the only pass. This will never work. An electric shaver is designed to give a very comfortable shave, and the above procedure does just that. I will never go back to a razor (unless, unexpectedly, the power goes out or the water supply is interrupted by some disaster), it is just that comfortable of a shave.     I guess it is now very obvious to you that I AM TOTALLY PLEASED WITH THIS RAZOR (and that comes from a previous \\&quot;Die-Hard\\&quot; razor and shaving cream user).</li>
    <li> Great product, love it</li>
    <li> excellent quality; quiet &amp; effective.  a bit bulky.</li>
    <li> Super shaver. Charges quickly. Cuts close and rapidly.</li>
    <li> I have been using Norelcos for 40 years and been happy until the last Norelco which was the Senso Touch 2D.  Used it for 2 plus years and never felt I could get a reasonably close shave.  Even putting in new heads didn&#x27;t improve things much.  Also the new style Norelco has to be emptied after every shave as there is no room to collect the shavings, the charging set up is a pain and the head has to be removed to install the trimmer.  Hence I decided to try a foil shaver for the first time.  Only been using it a week and had no trouble adjusting.  It is the best electric razor shave I&#x27;ve had.  Close shave no burn or irritation.  I use it dry and would say I have an average beard. The large shaving head is surprisingly not a problem at all.  Here is a tip for ex-Norelco Senso Touch users:  The Panasonic does not come with a stand, but the stand for the SensoTouch holds the Panasonic just fine.</li>
    <li> Works great. Wet/Dry is an excellent feature. I don&#x27;t miss the washing/charging station that is the first thing to break.</li>
    <li> Let me begin by saying that I was only recently introduced to electric shaving after decades of blade shaving, and involuntarily at that.This was caused by a mobility problem which forced me to give up the blade and I hated the idea of electric, knowing it could never equal a razor blade. In addition, I knew nothing  about electric shavers or their cost and succumbed to my first without doing any research and not caring much either. I did know that any electric would be a challenge because my face is slim and angular.  So I dispatched my son to go to my local store and get me my first electric. He returned with a Philips Norelco triple rotary recommended by the store owner who  has used one himself for the last ten years. Cost:$120(prices here in Canada are  brutal). I hated it from the get-go and returned it under the 30-day trial policy  of the store for a Panasonic GA21,a mid-high level foil shaver costing $150. It&#x27;s sleek  and attractive, has the self- cleaning feature, and shaves quite well. Like most Panasonics,as I now understand, it pivots from side to side instead of front to back, a design I don&#x27;t understand. It&#x27;s also discontinued at this point.  While shaving with this razor with good but not outstanding results I started to really get into electrics and began doing a lot of research with a view to finding the best machine out there(cost be damned).The first thing that caught my attention was all the hype about the Braun 7 series, so I bought a 720(that&#x27;s the one without  the cleaning station).It was the silver one that&#x27;s now been replaced by the new black 720-4. So I concluded that my 720(on sale for $180)was the best of its class.I loved everything about it--it&#x27;s ergonomic sexy design and floating foils, for example(but not the lack of a protective plastic cap for the head--inexcusable),but was so disappointed to find it didn&#x27;t shave close enough.So, regretably, I returned it before the 30 day deadline for a full refund and went back to using my Panasonic  GA21.  Following up on my research, I knew my next move was this Panasonic LA63,priced at just $130 at Amazon!(less than half list price of $300). Straight out of the box I loved it--everything works beautifully, the head pivots both ways with ease, the four blades and two motors feel powerful as the large head plows through my medium   beard like a lawn mower.And, most of all of course, it shaves close!! Not as good as a blade but not far from it. It&#x27;s comfortable as can be and never pulls as the Braun did. The big head is actually an asset as it covers more territory for a faster shave.The vibration in the head is very subtle compared to the Braun, which feels like a face massage--quite nice. And the upper lip is no problem for me; you just use fewer foils and it comes out fine. It&#x27;s not perfect on the neck, but that may have something to do with the fact that my skin isn&#x27;t as tight as it used to be, particularly under the chin, and so may not be a problem for younger guys. It comes with nice bells and whistles like the charge level LED readout and cleans like a breeze under running water. I suspect this unit will shave extremely well when wet, but I only shave dry.  So, for me, this is possibly the best electric shaver out there, and I see Men&#x27;s Health magazine agrees, as the LA63 has been voted best grooming aid for 2010. In addition, it has received other awards this year.                 l</li>
    <li> This is my third panasonic shaver and it is by far the best.I am 71 years young and have shaved with an electric shaver all my life.Before Panasonic came on the marked I shaved with Braun products but must say\\&quot; Panasonic is ahead of the others.\\&quot;  I do have one complain and I think panasonic should correct that for all the poeple who have purchased this shaver and that is a charging stand.Panasonic charges enough for this product and should include a charging stand.  hale</li>
    <li> Bought this after having Braun shavers for 5 years or so. Holds a decent charge and comfortable to hold. Pretty close shave for an electric. Can do a daily shave in 2-3 mins which seems to be in less time than my Brauns. Easy to clean, just wash it under water each day. Only con is the head is a little big to get upper lip.</li>
    <li> works well, quiet, smooth and easy on the skin. Probably the closest shave I had from an electric razor.</li>
    <li> OK, I bought it as a backup/travel shaver to complement my Panasonic LA-93, knowing it didn&#x27;t include a charging dock - the front of the shaver looks identical to the LA-93 except for the color.  What I didn&#x27;t know, and I&#x27;m advising others with this review, is that it doesn&#x27;t fit the LA-93 charging dock either.  Well, it fits, but Panasonic has cleverly removed the charging contacts on the back of this model so it does nothing in the dock.  For a travel shaver, it will work well; wish I had known it wouldn&#x27;t work in the existing cleaner/dock though....</li>
    <li> Works really well.  I have a hard beard to handle and it does as good as any I have found.</li>
    <li> I know most people reading these reviews are just going to quickly skim through so I will keep this brief.  First of all I&#x27;ve used all different types of razors and shaving techniques and would say that this is by far the most convenient and effective razor of any kind I have ever used.  It does take some time to get used to but I would say after about a week or two you will know for sure whether or not this razor is right for you.  It has a timer letting you know how long each shave takes and after a week or so I got it down to about 3 minutes which is convenient if you&#x27;re in a hurry to get to work or whatever you do in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:  The motor is faster than a lot of other electric razors and this allows for minimal contact with the skin to remove the hair. Whereas the price is somewhat higher than what I was wanting to pay, it is SIGNIFICANTLY cheaper on amazon than other retailers, seriously if you don&#x27;t believe me check other websites or retail stores.  I won&#x27;t say where but it was 40-50 dollars less on here than it was on a similar website.  The four blade pivoting head is also really nice, it seems kind of big at first but after the second or third shave you realize you can cover more area of your beard in a faster manner than with the smaller shaving heads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:  The most noticeable flaw is going to be the price, my advice is that if you&#x27;re not comfortable with paying whatever the current price is look at a cheaper model Panasonic from the same product family.  I personally use it for a dry shave either after or before a shower or sometimes just whenever I get around to shaving but from what I&#x27;ve read is that it won&#x27;t last as long if you use it for wet shaves, honestly I don&#x27;t know nor do I care but that seems to be said by a lot of people who&#x27;ve used this for wet shaves based on other reviews.  So if that bothers you maybe look at a different razor.  One last thing that kind of bothers me is the amount of time you spend on your neck and jawline, given NO electric razors work well on your neck or jawline but I expected this to be a little better in that area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, you will probably will get some initial irritation to your skin on the first few shaves.  Most of that will depend on what your shaving method was prior to using this razor and how long it has been since you last shaved.  To prevent this you could shave every other day for the first week or two or even consider shaving at night so by the time you go to work or whatever you do during the day, the irritation will be unnoticeable.  In conclusion, I would recommend this product to anyone who is looking for a clean shave without the razor burn and hassle of dealing with replacement blades/shaving cream and all that other BS every morning.  Anyways, hope this helps.</li>
    <li> The worst razor i ever used.</li>
    <li> I read up on Amazon all the shavers, styles, and tips - BTW Thanks Guys! -and decided to give this one a try as it was on sale and everyone was talking about how the rotation speed was higher on the Panasonics. This one is 14,000rpm. I have a light beard and was previously using a Norelco Nivea with a Braun M-60 for touch up. Wet shaving took about 30 minutes for a razor smooth shave.  As the title says - Love at first shave! I fully charged and took it into the shower. I used a dab of Billie Jealosy as recommended by a poster and while it did take multiple passes, especially until I figured out there is a proper angle to hold it at for the magic to happen - which they actually provide a diagram of in the instructions, but in ten minutes I had baby soft skin with zero stubble, no ingrown hairs, no need for touch up and NO RAZOR BURN. Now I&#x27;m not that sensitive, but my back neck area STILL didn&#x27;t like the Norelco after several months use. The aftershave would still sting there pretty good and I&#x27;d get a tingle all over. After shaving with this, I KNEW, I mean I KNEW that this wasn&#x27;t the case here as my head didn&#x27;t feel like it had just been shaved and sure enough, not even a tingle from the aftershave! And trimming around my beard was easier becuase of the straight foil vs the rotary as well.  If you&#x27;re a head shaver like myself I strongly encourage you to give this one a try!</li>
    <li> Purchase for my husband. He thinks this is a great razor that performs better than any electric that he&#x27;s tried before and is very happy with the purchase.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll keep this short and sweet as there are many positive reviews already on the Panasonic ES-LA63-S Arc IV Multi Flex Nanotech Rechargeable Shaver.  First I was delighted to catch this on sale on one of Amazon&#x27;s \\&quot;Today&#x27;s Deals\\&quot; for just under $90.00 then qualify for a $30 rebate.  But most of all this shaver is the real deal in that it shaves comfortably AND close.  No burns or fuss I don&#x27;t have to lather. Darn close as a razor.</li>
    <li> I have used this razor now for about three weeks, about 15 shaves. I had for some 55 years used a Gillette razor and blades and occasionally a Braun electric shaver. I have a fairly heavy beard.  I got tired of paying outrageous prices for Gillette blades so I wanted to give another electric a try.  This Panasonic gives a very good shave. Although not as close as the Gillette , it is good enough for me. I am retired so I do not need a shave that lasts all day. In the past  I could not stand a five  o&#x27;clock shadow at two o&#x27;clock, but now that is no problem. The head of the shaver is rather large so getting to tight places ( eg, above the lip) is not easy.  The Panasonic is very smooth running across the face; it gives a close shave for an electric; and it is easy to clean. It is better than the Braun I had.  I would recommend this shaver.</li>
    <li> Wow, what a step up in electric razors, will never do back to super expensive Gillette blades. This razor works super fast, no irriation, and is sold for a great price. You will start saving money in three months versus paying $8 week for Gillette four blade razors.  Battery life is also very good, lasts well over 2 weeks.</li>
    <li> I am a head shaver.  I have used electric razors and blades on my head for years.  I just got this razor and it is light years ahead of any razor i have ever used for face and head.  It is very close shave and much faster than previous models from panasonic.  BTW, i loved my old panasonic until i got this one.  It is also very quiet.  It is worth every penny.</li>
    <li> excellent shave  takes me 5 minutes for the closest shave. no problem saying close as a razor. the large head looks like it would be awkward but it really isn&#x27;t much bigger than any other and takes seconds to get used to it.  have been using braun for 15+ years. tried the top norelco rotary just before i tried this panasonic. i returned it. i wouldn&#x27;t spend $300 for the top braun and the specs on the panasonic appeared to top the braun.  this panasonic is hands down better than all of them and half the price.       the only disappointment? no simple stand. have to just lay it on the counter to charge and when not in use.</li>
    <li> Best shave since I gave up the blade 10+ years ago.  I used rotary shavers because I had a bad experience with a screen shaver.  After results getting worse and worse with a rotary, in spite of replacing the heads, I decided to try a screen shaver again, based on ratings from a consumer magazine, I selected this shaver.  Very satisfied.</li>
    <li> Best shave I&#x27;ve had from an electric, ever - and at least as good as a straight razor shave.  The only thing preventing me from giving 5 stars is the price.    After trying this shaver dry, wet (just water), and lubricated with shaving soap and/or shaving oil (each separately and both together), the best shave came in the shower, using just a few drops of [[ASIN:B000G014V8 American Crew Essential Shave Oil, 1.7 oz]] which provides just the right amount of lubrication.  I also like to use a shaving balm afterwards and find this to be very effective [[ASIN:B00127Q13K Nivea For Men Extreme Comfort Post Shave Balm, 3.3-Ounce Bottle (Pack of 3)]].    With this shaver, it takes me about 2-3 minutes to shave my face completely smooth.  I am military, and have fairly thick, quick-growing facial hair.  Getting a good shave in the morning is important, or I have to shave again after lunch.  Normally I can&#x27;t get a close enough shave with electrics, but I can with this one.  It&#x27;s even slightly better than the Braun 7 series which I&#x27;m now keeping at work as a backup shaver for the really long days.    Battery life is pretty good.  It charges in less than an hour and lasts a week and a half at 2-3 minutes of shaving per day.    For travelers - this shaver has a locking mechanism on the power switch so you won&#x27;t have to worry about it being switched on in your luggage (NICE!)    After reading some of the bad reviews, I&#x27;d suggest you get this version and avoid paying for the charging/cleaning stand which apparently has reliability problems.  A wet/dry shaver doesn&#x27;t need a fancy cleaning stand anyway - just open it and run it under the faucet when you&#x27;re done using it and splash some alcohol on it once a week or so to sanitize.    PROS:  Great Shave!! Wet/Dry.  Good battery life/Quick charging.  Locking power switch.  CONS:  Price.</li>
    <li> This is by far the best electric shaver I have ever used and produces a close shave comparable to that of a blade shave. I have used other rotary type shavers before but the Panasonic ES-LA63-S Arc IV is far superior.</li>
    <li> I shave my head and face with this razor, and it is by far the best razor I&#x27;ve used.  It has saved 15 minutes off my shaving time.  Excellent product.  I used a variety of razors, mostly the triple head rotary blade razors, and this razor puts them all to shame.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have owned and used this since Christmas 2014.  So I only have a couple months of use, but Love it so far.  I guess the next test is how long the blades will continue to work so great, before I need to replace them.</li>
    <li> I bought this razor for my son for Christmas 2010. He has long complained that his old razor was awful! His exact words after using this new razor was: \\&quot;Oh my gawd, Mom - that razor&#x27;s AMAZING!! That&#x27;s the smoothest shave I&#x27;ve ever had!\\&quot;   He loves it!!</li>
    <li> My Husband purchased this shaver.  In his words, OUTSTANDING.  He has had 3 other brands of electric shavers &amp; none can compare to the quality of this panasonic ES-LA63 - S Arc 1V. The shaves are smooth.  It is like using a razor blade.</li>
    <li> I have been using Panasonic electric razors for the past 5 years and this razor is by far the best of the best. In the past I had been using the 2 headed foil. Now that I have upgraded to the three foil head and I couldn&#x27;t be happier. I usually always do a wet shave and it seems to get as close as a straight razor! Shaving on the neck can be a bit tricky, but gets the job done after multiple passes/angles. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I recently converted from using a hand razor and it took a &#x27;little while to get used to using an electric razor but now I&#x27;m getting closer shaves and halving the time spent shaving. Highly recommend this Razor.</li>
    <li> Who would believe it an electric shaver that does shave as close as a blade. I read alot of reviews regarding the Panasonic ES-LA63S but was very sceptical about how well it would actually shave. I have tried many brands over the years with all claiming to be as good as a blade only to be disapointed. Finally an electric razor that lives up to the hype. Good on you Panasonic. I only hope the blades last, anyway time will tell.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m on my 3rd Panasonic ES-LA63. Each time they last 2-3 months and then the LCD screen breaks. The first time it didn&#x27;t light up at all and the last two times the things were blinking at the wrong time. I would use it and then when I turned it off the clock said 0:00 and blinked. Only first and third battery meter lines lit up. The shaver works great but it isn&#x27;t worth it. I have to call customer service and pay to mail my razor back to them with copies of my original purchase and then wait 2-3 weeks for them to send me another one. Its not worth the hassle.</li>
    <li> Purchased for my husband as a surprise gift.  It not only doesn&#x27;t perform well for shaving facial hair, it&#x27;s even worse shaving a bald head.  It is much quicker and more efficient to continue using razors than this product.  We were both very disappointed and have returned this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been a Norelco user for many years but was never quite satisfied with its closeness of shave (or lack thereof),  The Panasonic exceeded my expectations--a very great improvement over the Norelco with no skin irritation despite the closer shave.  I have been using a pre-shave (CVS&#x27; economy version) which seems to improve the shave a little.  And it&#x27;s a fast shave, too, on the order of three and a half minutes.  Mark me as a very satisfied consumer.</li>
    <li> My old Panasonic Linear razor finally quit (after more than 25 years of great service) so I decided to stick with the same brand that had served me so well.  I have not been disappointed as I get a quick, much quieter, more comfortable shave.  I love the locking feature on the power button as my old razor would occasionally start if bumped during the process of loading and unloading my suitcase to an airplane&#x27;s baggage compartment.  The shaver cleans very easily and, while it was more expensive than many other razors, I feel that the money spent was well worth it!</li>
    <li> a wonderful shaver indeed.  quick-thorough-bang for buck.  it arrived in OZ in 10 days also.  great work all round guys!  regards  mac</li>
    <li> Quickly shaves my face.  Close shave, no problem shaving under nose/above lip (I mention this because I&#x27;ve seen the question asked, since it seems like a large head, but no problem at all), cleans easy, solid build quality.  Most of my shaves are around 2min 30 seconds long, trimmer works great for sideburns.    Very satisfied with this.  Not so much with my previous purchase a month ago (Norelco rotary) which I returned after one day of use.</li>
    <li> It is the best electric shaver I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
    <li> Best Shaver i have ever used!!</li>
    <li> amazing, the best electric shaver that I ever had</li>
    <li> Literally, the best razor I have owned. I can be rough on sensitive neck skin. Charges fast, cleans easily, very close shave in 3-4 minutes.</li>
    <li> RECEIVED THIS RAZOR ABOUT A MONTH AGO. AFTER USING BOTH THE BRAUN PULSONIC &amp; THE NORELCO ARITEC ALL I CAN SAY IS WOW!!!! THIS PANASONIC IS GREAT. I AM NOT A PANASONIC FAN BY ANYMEANS. MY LAST EXPERIENCE WITH THEM WAS WITH A CAMERA THAT I FINALLY SOLD AT AN AWFUL PRICE JUST TO GET RID OF IT. (CUSTOMER SERVICE WAS BAD.) I TRIED THIS RAZOR  BASED ON THE REVIEWS THAT IT RECIEVED &amp; HAVE BEEN PLEASANTLY SURPRISED. THE SHAVE IS CLOSE, BETTER WET (WITH SHAVING CREAM) THAN DRY. STARTED WITH ABOUT 7 MINUTES &amp; NOW DOWN TO ABOUT 5 MINUTES AS I HAVE GOTTEN BETTER ACQUAINTED WITH THE RAZOR. THE CHARGING TIME IS ABOUT 1 HOUR. SO FAR I GET NO MORE THAN 6 SHAVES TO A CHARGE. NO CHARGING STAND OR HOLDER WITH THE RAZOR IS ANNOYING. I ADAPTED MY ARITEC STAND TO HOLD THE RAZOR. CAN&#x27;T CHARGE IT ON THE STAND BUT IT HOLDS IT BETWEEN SHAVES. GOT A GREAT BUY ON THE RAZOR SO COST DOES NOT EFFECT THIS REVIEW. BEST RAZOR I HAVE EVER OWNED.</li>
    <li> My first foil shaver.  (i&#x27;ve used a couple of rotary Philips shavers in the past.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had it a couple of weeks, and so far, I like it a lot.  I&#x27;ve mostly been using this one, occasionally substituting my old Philips PT724 (3100 class) rotary shaver for good measure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I should mention that the PT724 rotary is an el cheapo ($40) rotary - but I also like it a lot.  I think it&#x27;s Philips&#x27; cheapest rotary that allows actual rinsing to cleanup.  Believe it or not, I previously had an even cheaper (if that&#x27;s possible!) Philips rotary - one that required dry cleanup (yes, the brush).  That thing was definitely second rate in all possible ways - but even it did the job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway I wanted to try a foil, so selected this Panasonic (with a little push thanks to a lightning deal).  I wasn&#x27;t interested in the super-premium models ($200), or anything too gimmicky.  And I&#x27;ve spent enough time with it to say, you know, I really like it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s smooth, quieter than I expected (tho still noiser than a rotary), rinses easily, charges very quickly and holds a charge.  i should mention that I dry-shave; never tried in shower or with lotion, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll revisit this review if it disappoints down-the-road, but so far I can say, Recommended!</li>
    <li> Takes 20+ minutes to shave. Leaves too many unshaved clumps. Cuts skin. Pulls hair. Returning ASAP</li>
    <li> I just purchased the ES-LA63-S to take advantage of the $30 rebate available from Panasonic until 12/31/2010. I upgraded from an older Panasonic model, the very capable ES-8075-S with Vortex cleaning system. The ES-LA63-S model is superior to my older Panasonic, without question. The blades seem a touch more powerful, the shave a bit closer. In addition, the slight curve present in the \\&quot;Arc\\&quot; foil and cutting blades do seem to provide an advantage compared to the \\&quot;straight\\&quot; foil and blades of my older shaver. Note that the ES-LA63-S is the exact same shaver as the more expensive ES-LA93-K; the only difference between them is that the ES-LA93-K comes in black and includes a drying/cleaning/charging base station. The truth is, you don&#x27;t need this station, because the shaver is ridiculously easy to clean under running warm tap water with a little liquid or bar soap, and to air dry. The shaver features a sideburn trimmer, which works fairly well, and comes with a charging cord and black travel case.    This shaver features two motors (one with horizontal oscillation; the other with vertical oscillation), a 14,000 RPM cutting speed, four foils and is made in Japan (some of Panasonic&#x27;s lower-end models are made in China). The blue-backlit LCD screen tells you how much charge is remaining, how much time you&#x27;ve been shaving for, and when the shaver needs to be cleaned. One full charge provides about 40-45 minutes of shaving time. As with all electric shavers, I find some slight touch-up with a razor is necessary afterwards (usually on a small part of the neck), but the bottom line is that by using an electric for the bulk of the shaving, you are saving a ton of friction and irritation on your face.    My personal tips to get the most out of this model:    1) Use a shaving oil (olive oil works great) and warm water and shaving cream for the most comfortable shave. The oil helps provide extra lubrication for the cutting blades as they pass across your skin. I do believe that the use of oil and a wet shave provides for a far superior and more comfortable experience than a dry shave. This is the main advantage of the Panasonic line-up over the Braun series -- the Braun models can&#x27;t be used in the shower or with water and shaving cream.  2) Lock the shaving head so that it doesn&#x27;t move. I find this makes it easier to control the shaver and aim it at specific spots on one&#x27;s face.  3) Clean your shaver after every shave to keep it smelling fresh and clean. This takes 45 seconds at most. Remove the foil top from the shaver and rub liquid hand soap or bar soap lather over the foil and cutting blades. Wash them clean under running warm water. Place the shaver (with foil top still removed) upside down on a paper towel or some toilet paper to \\&quot;gravity\\&quot; air-dry. That&#x27;s it.  4) Drain the battery fully before re-charging it -- this helps to prolong the life of the rechargeable battery.    In closing, bear in mind that Panasonic&#x27;s own literature states that anyone switching to electric shaving from a razor will take about 30 days to fully adjust to it.</li>
    <li> I have used Braun electrics for years. All eventually needed replacement because their batteries needed replacement. They are OK but loud, and take a long time to get a close shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Panasonic is a little bulky looking at first, but it&#x27;s a good shape and size for the job. The shave is fast and efficient and close. A feature I especially appreciate is the display that measures remaining battery life.  It&#x27;s smartly done: they figure you&#x27;ll get about 10 shaves from a charge (100%), and each reading is a multiple, like 60% remaining. Depending how sleepy I am, some shaves take longer, but you always kind of know where you stand.  I also think that there&#x27;s some reserve power at 0% so you won&#x27;t end up half-shaven. This simple feature ensures that the battery is charged correctly (before it is completely empty) which should allow the battery to last much longer. Also, you know where you stand so don&#x27;t need to bring a cord on trips unless you&#x27;re away for a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The blades oscillate super-fast, and it&#x27;s he sound is a quiet, high-pitched buzz. Much quieter than my old Braun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Works wet or dry.  I use dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recharge is quick: about an hour.  Then unplug and your good for a week or so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cleaning is great.  There&#x27;s a &amp;#34;turbo mode&amp;#34; -- put some soap on the foil, turn on the cleaning mode and run under water, and it basically shakes all the skuzz off, and turns off when done, about 15 or 30 seconds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I have been buying Panasonic razors for over 25 years, with this purchase I bought a more expensive one than I normally do. The other ones were good,  this one is great.</li>
    <li> The Panasonic ES-LA63S is a replacement for a Braun 7500 purchased some 10 years ago, a shaver which I have been happy with in terms of performance, but alas in absolute ignorance of the giant steps forward in technology in recent years.  Having been used to the \\&quot;5 O&#x27;Clock shaddow\\&quot; for the last ten years I have known nothing better, however when my 7500 died just prior to Christmas 2010, my wonderful wife bought me a new electronic razor, the Panasonic ES-LA63s.....Why the Panasonic...well I chose this razor after much research on the net and having read many reviews on all the shavers available I decided on a 63s. a Wet and Dry shaver.  The reason I chose a 63s and not a 93s was simply the cost, the 93s was $100 more but included a charging/cleaning station which required a constant and very frequent change of cleaning fluid,(which is expensive) and with the 63 being a wet and dry shaver and literally cleaned under the tap, the obvious question was asked....why do I need a cleaning station...simply plug the damn thing into the mains and charge it up around twice a month...simple really...no nead for another bulky box sat on the bathroom windowsill causing more clutter.AND THE 63 IS THE SAME SPEC AS THE 93  The first time I used this shaver was on Christmas morning,2010 after my shower, I shaved in the washbasin with shaving foam, I could not believe how smooth the shave was compared to the Braun (which was a dry shaver).  My face was ultra smooth....\\&quot;as smooth as the proverbial babies bum\\&quot;..the last time I had a shave this close  and to last all day was when I was in my twenties and wet shaved every morning, which left me with horrendous shaving rashes around my collar line.  I am now 62 years young and honestly wish that this technology had been available in my youth..BUT I am so glad this shaver has been developed by Panasonic, it is light years ahead anything available just 10 years ago, I am very happy with this shaver and would strongly recommend it to anyonewho is used to a wet shave at present and who is thinking of trying a wet/dry electric shaver, you will not be dissapointed, you will still be feeling your smooth chin when it is time to go to bed at night, and believe me, in the morning you will be asking yourself the question....\\&quot;Do I need to shave this morning\\&quot;.  This shaver is brilliant...The only reason I do not give it 5 stars is the high cost..but in time this will come down I am sure.  Well done Panasonic...I have absolutely no idea what you are going to come up with for an encore.</li>
    <li> I had Norelco razors forever. My last one was dying, and after researching online, I decided to go with the Panasonic. I&#x27;ve had it about a month, and at this point I am regretting not getting this sooner. It gives me a better shave, and in less time. It&#x27;s easy to use, and easy to clean. Doesn&#x27;t hurt my skin at all (but I am very used to using electric razors). Very happy with it, and highly recommend it. Hope it lasts as long as the Norelco&#x27;s did, but I guess time will tell.</li>
    <li> My last 3 electric razors have been Braun&#x27;s, so I was hesitant to make a switch since the Braun&#x27;s have always worked well for me.  When I bought my latest Braun 4 years ago I went for the top of the line model - complete with self cleaning stand, etc.  The self cleaning stand broke after 1 year and was expensive to maintain with their proprietary refills, so after the initial coolness factor wore off, that wasn&#x27;t very useful.  I replaced the blade and foil about every year with my Braun and that kept it cutting very nicely.  It would be easy to say that this new Panasonic cuts so much better but that wouldn&#x27;t be a fair comparison since I am comparing a new Panasonic blade to my Braun&#x27;s blade, which was about 1 year old when I replaced it.  And even with my older Braun, putting in a new [...] blade made it feel almost new again.    The biggest pros for me of this Panasonic over the Brauns are:  1) Price - to get a top of the line Braun it would have cost twice as much as this Panasonic model, which I picked up for eight nine dollars after rebate.  If performance is equal I&#x27;m not going to pay twice as much because I&#x27;m loyal to a brand.  2) Surface area - this Panasonic has a much larger surface area on the razor head, which means I can shave faster.  I shave every day so to cut off a couple of minutes has been quite nice.  3) Wet or Dry shave option - I didn&#x27;t buy the Panasonic for this reason, and I still use the dry shave most of the time, but it is a pretty nice option to have.  And the fact that it can get wet makes cleaning much easier as well.    Overall I&#x27;ve been really pleased with this razor after a month of use and haven&#x27;t missed my Braun one bit!</li>
    <li> Excellent, works perfectly!</li>
    <li> I have shaved with cordless shavers all my life (I&#x27;m 73) and have used Remington, Braun, Norelco, and Panasonic.  Each time I made a purchase it was for a claimed faster, smoother shaver with a longer lasting battery.  Each time I ended up with a shaver that performed about the same as the last one.  My last two shavers have been Panasonic because I find them the most comfortable.  When my last one quit (no longer would hold a charge), I looked at Panasonic&#x27;s ES-LA63-S.  Panasonic&#x27;s MSRP is $300, Amazon had it on sale for $94 and Panasonic had a mail-in $30 rebate.  We all love a bargain and at this price how could I miss?  For the first time I got a shaver that IS faster, smoother, and has a longer lasting battery.  Lithium Ion batteries are a definite step up and hold a charge longer.  My last shaver would do 5 to 6 shaves on a charge.  The ES-LA63-S does 8 to 9 shaves.  The old shaver took 7 minutes for a close shave.  The ES-LA63-S takes 5.1/2 minutes.  The high speed cleaning mode is quick and effective.  I put a little dish soap in a small cup with warm water and run the shaver through a couple of cleaning cycles, rinse it, and it&#x27;s done.  The ES-LA63-S is a product that delivers as advertised,    The only negative is that the shaver is battery only.  It can&#x27;t run on the charging cord.  However, it will charge enough for one shave in 5 minutes which isn&#x27;t too inconvenient when you forget to charge the battery.          This is the best shaver I have owned and I recommend it.</li>
    <li> I have used dozens of different brands of electric razors over the past 40 years and my beard is so heavy that after I shave with any of my previous electric razors, I also had to shave with a blade razor while taking a shower to get a smooth shave.    Those days of double shaves are over.  The Panasonic ES-LA63 electric razor gives me, by far, the best shave I have ever gotten by an electric razor.  I am sold!!!</li>
    <li> Excellent shaver. Prompt shipping</li>
    <li> I have been a rotary shaver guy for 30 years!  I just accepted that I needed to go over and over the same shaving area get rid of stubble but never truly have a smooth shave.  After my first shave with the Panasonic LA63 I am a complete convert!  I was amazed not only with how close my first shave was, but how quickly I was able to achieve a \\&quot;real\\&quot; smooth shave!!  My last shaver was one of those new styled Norelco&#x27;s with futuristic shape and tiny swivel head.  Every time I used it I saw the \\&quot;wash me\\&quot; light turn on. It was a nuisance to shave and then need to clean the head.  With my new Panasonic, I have yet to see the clean me light, but still feel compelled to clean the shaver after a week of use...old habits die hard.  The battery lasts for at least a week. I have not yet used the wet shave feature but look forward to trying.  I travel often and so appreciate the black travel case that comes with this shaver, as well as the locking feature of the on/off button so it cannot inadvertently be pressed \\&quot;on\\&quot; while squished in luggage.  It also charges very quickly (less than an hour).  This is another feature I am not used to from my previous life.  While I do appreciate reading reviews, I have not been a consistent review giver.  This shaver definitely needed a review, to let others know there is another world out there beyond rotary shaving!</li>
    <li> This shaver is really great! After a week of using it on a dry skin, I can tell that it&#x27;s well built, and the shaving feels closer than ever. I&#x27;ve benn using Philips shavers for 17 years and decided to make a change and I don&#x27;t regret, highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I bought the Panasonic shaver after I tried the Braun 5 series and 7 series. The Panasonic shaver is faster and more powerful. With Braun, either the 5 or 7 series, you need at least 10-15 minutes to shave, but with the Panasonic 3-5 minutes. This Panasonic shaver is quite and very smooth on the skin and the neck areas, it shaves hair very fast compared to the Braun. The Braun used to cause my neck to plead, but not with the Panasonic. However, it does leave few hair around the neck, but it is the same as the Braun shavers as well. The trimer also works better than the Braun models. In my opinion the Braun has a better mechanical design and looks better, but the quality of this Panasonic shaver is the best, and it looks in your hand better than the picture, when you feel it, it fits perfectly. Also, I found that the panasonic works the same either wet or dry, just it is smoother on skin when wet. Definitely I will keep this one.</li>
    <li> This is one of the best razors I&#x27;ve ever used.  I previously used a rotary electric shaver.  This multi-flex moves and contours to your face for a perfect shave.  I have neck hair which likes to grow in different directions, this razor is able to grab those hairs and cut them with ease.  I would spend about 20 minutes shaving, now its about 5 minutes.  No redness or discomfort.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this razor!</li>
    <li> What can i say about this Razor?    Well it shave nearly as close as a blade dry and just as close when used with shaving oil.    I have used it on my chest area and it does a great job, no rash and much better than any Electric razor i have ever used (my previous electric was  philishave arcitec and this panasonic knocks it into a cocked hat)    brilliant razor and hard to see how this could be improved upon</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B002N5MHLU Panasonic ES-LA63-S Arc IV Multi Flex Nanotech Rechargeable Shaver, Silver]]  I am 63 years and have used a few electric shavers  This shaver gives the closest best shave ever. I like a wet shave occasionally. This shaver  provides a great shave, wet or dry.  I do have to hide the shaver however, as my darling wife has taken to using it in the shower. I may have to purchase another one Just for my wife.</li>
    <li> One of the best types of shavers that I bought and also the quality is excellent too and I advise everyone not to miss it Thanks Thanks Amazon thanks Panasonic .</li>
    <li> I purchased this shaver a few weeks ago and couldn&#x27;t be more happier. I&#x27;ve owned a Braun for several years, and never experienced a closer shave than I receive from the ES-LA 63-S. And I don&#x27;t have to be ripped-off by the over priced cleaning solution from Braun. After reviewing the shavers performances on Consumer Reports, I really believe money dictates their findings. I&#x27;m sure a lot of peoples beards are different, but if there is a better electric shaver out there I haven&#x27;t found it yet.</li>
    <li> Really prefect Shaver machine , soft Light high quality , Recommended</li>
    <li> The best electric shaver I have ever owned. I&#x27;m 76 years old so I have tried a lot of them</li>
    <li> This is the best electric razor i have ever owned.  I have used remington, norelco and phillishave in the past and none of them shave anywhere near as close as a wet shave with a blade but the panasonic chnages this.  It is as good as a blade shave even when using it dry.  Cant recommend this product highly enough.  I will never buy another brand of shaver again.</li>
    <li> Charge the shaver when the power is 0%, not 10%. It helps to extend the life of the battery (and the shaver).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I shave about 1 min a day, and the battery level drops from 100% to 10% in 2 weeks. After that, the battery remains at 10% for 10 weeks and drops to 0%. So don&#x27;t get fooled by the battery indicator. :-)</li>
    <li> purchase for my son. not really sure yet on the durability. it seems kind of bulky on the head but really have never used an electric shaver, he&#x27;s still getting used to it -- time will tell</li>
    <li> I purchased this shaver from Amazon.  Before, I was using one of those 3-circle bladed units.  While it worked ok, it always cut my skin especially around the nook of my mouth (where upper lip meets lower lip).  This shaver, however, is the best shaver I have ever used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hate using the old school shaver with foam and all that. I simply do not have the time or patience to deal with it. So electric shavers are the only units that interest me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using this product for several months, this Panasonic unit has many clear positive features.  First, it has great battery life.  The screen on the unit even let&#x27;s the user know how much juice is left. It also charges fast and indicates when it is done by a blinking blue light. This thing is also comfortable to hold; it is not too heavy and is slightly curved to easily fit into your hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the most important aspect of any razor is how well it works. Like I said, I have sensitive skin that would easy get cut and become dry with my old unit.  I have not been cut by this unit one time and the pivoting head makes shaving as easy as it can be.  Clean up is easy too.  For the most part, all the hair clippings were caught by the razor head to avoid messes (only slight spillage).  I always clean my razor after every use, but the little screen tells you when you need to clean the unit.  And cleaning is easy, you just simply unclip the razor head and rinse with cold water. There really is nothing to it. The one-touch ON makes this unit easy to use too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When turned on, this little unit just feels powerful.  The buzz that it recreates is really something that needs to be felt. It is very strong for its size and overall works very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint about this unit is the clipper on the back.  You need to use some force to get it to pop out and it is quite small.  It is nice that you do not need to attach something extra to make this shaver into a clipper, and the smaller size allows for more accurate control, but I would have liked it to be a little wider.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The unit also comes with everything you will need including a little travel pouch and AC adapter.  It would have been nice if it included an extra razor head (which you should change every year or so) but for the price, I guess I shouldn&#x27;t complain.but I would have liked it to be a little wider.

    <li> I have the same one in Black.    Wifey got this one for me about 7 months ago.  I have never owned an electric shaver so I was impressed how close it shaves.  I have only used the dry shave on this.  Wet shave seems too messy.  It&#x27;s great when you are in a rush.    The cleanning soap and blades seem pricey but if you sit down and do the math comparing disposable shavers and this you&#x27;ll see its worth it in the long run.  I use to buy the Gillete triple blade 8 pk razors, about $10 p/pack.     Pros  Quick and close shave  Convenient for people on the go  Worth the investment  Cons  Takes about 30-45 mins for the dock to clean the shaver.  I think its waay too long.  Beard hair comes back out about 1/2 day earlier compared to razor shaving.  I probably need to do the Wet Shave to get a close shave tho.  The trimmer totally doesn&#x27;t do it&#x27;s job, unless I&#x27;m using it wrong.  But I don&#x27;t really care because I&#x27;m more concerned with the overall shave.  Instead of buying the expensive Gillet razors I buy from the 99 cent store now to do all my trimming.    I totally recommend it!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok for me,and I think it&#x27;s better than 760cc.</li>
    <li> Panasonic shaver is the best for me. The battery does last much longer than Braun. Panasonic just redesigned the head and it does contour to the face much better than the regular straight head like the Braun shaver.</li>
    <li> Although I have used electric razors for about 12 years, I was not much of an electric razor fan preferring a traditional razor shave with heated gel or cream. Based on that, I tried this product with a great deal of pessimism.  However, Panasonic won me over but an obvious high price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a foil shaver (compare to rotary) that works wet or dry.  From what I can tell, this is the most advanced rechargeable shaver not only in material (although there is plastic used in the shaver), but also in technology though I dispute the necessity (and cost) of an LCD screen.  The shaver is very quiet with no vibration.  It is very easy to handle and feels as if some ergonomic design was considered.  The LCD screen displays current charge level of the battery.  However, the charge for me (at this point) lasts for over three weeks of almost daily use.  The shaver provides an extremely close shave due to a floating head and does so without pulling any hair.  Its worth noting that the heads work both horizontally and vertically allowing you to shave in any direction.  Nevertheless, the end resulting shave is not as close as using a traditional multiblade razor (such as a Quattro) with cream.  Since I prefer a dry shave, I cannot adequately comment on shaver performance in the shower.  The side burn trimmer works fantastic on mustaches as well as sideburns.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shaver comes with a decent carrying case (vinyl) with a durable zipper but only holds the shaver and not accessories. My box did not include a cleaning brush or stand which I find odd.  However, since the shaver is wet/dry, you can clean it under running water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Clearly this is an excellent shaver.  However, at this price, you would expect it to be.</li>
    <li> Just from browsing some of the other reviews I see that most people agree that this shaver is excellent.  It gets up close and anything it misses a quick brush with the precision trimmer will knock it out.  In addition to that it has some nice amenities, such as a wobble head that makes it even easier to get around the curves of your face.  An LED light that says how long you have been shaving and the amount of battery life left.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All and all, an excellent electric shaver.  But $300?!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re like me, seeing that price tag better mean this bad boy does something no electric shaver in the history of shavers has ever done before.  Unfortunately, I can&#x27;t say that is the case.  Before I was using another Panasonic shaver, the [[ASIN:B000VKZMHK Panasonic ES8109S Vortex Wet/Dry Shaver with Nano Technology and HydraClean System]], and while it has a few less blades, I honestly can&#x27;t tell much of a difference in performance.  Both charge up as quickly, have LED lights, is wet/dry, gets a really close shave while feeling extremely gentle.. yet the Vortex is 1/3 the price.  Hmm..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So all in all, I couldn&#x27;t give this a bad rating, because it is excellent.  If you get it, you will like it.  I promise.  However, if money is an object, I wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to shop around for a similar (cheaper) product that is just as good.</li>
    <li> Razors are somewhat personal.  What works for one person isn&#x27;t necessarily right for another person.    I don&#x27;t have one of those tough beards that needs a chainsaw to shave.  I have the opposite problem that my whiskers don&#x27;t stand up enough to get into the cutting area of most electric razors without repeated passes.    I have tried many electric razors by Braun, Norelco, etc. and finally found a Panasonic electric that was very effective.  I liked that one a lot and when it finally died after years of service I got a Panasonic ES8249K Arc IV Nano Vortex Wet/Dry Rechargeable Shaving System which was the replacement for the earlier model and really liked it.    Then this razor came out.    I like it even better than the previous Panasonic I had.  It is better at getting the corners, the edges and the flats than the previous razor which I was very happy with.  I can shave in about 30% less time with this razor.    I use it dry as the wet just makes by whiskers even less likely to be in the right place on the razor.</li>
    <li> A good razor if it was in the next pricing tier down from where it is.  Considering the lack of a cleaning station, and it&#x27;s utterly useless trimmer, it lacks the \\&quot;wow\\&quot; feeling that you should get from a razor of this class.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-Cuts close with no skin irritation&lt;br /&gt;-charges fast, holds charge for a long time&lt;br /&gt;-clear LCD displays remaining battery life&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-No cleaning station.  Some other Panasonic razors come with a base station which automatically cleans and charges the razor with the touch of a button, but this model lacks this feature, and requires manual cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;-the razor head is HUGE.  It feels a little bit like shaving with a brick.  You can&#x27;t see what&#x27;s going on while you&#x27;re shaving, so this razor is best suited for people without beards/mustaches.&lt;br /&gt;-the trimmer jams easily.  You have to move it VERY slowly or else it jams up.</li>
    <li> The Panasonic ES-LA63-S is a great shaver for the money, especially with the holiday discount(s).  However after I received the shipment I noticed the shaver for a significant amount (for me anyway) less on another website.  In all fairness the particular vendor had a special savings of 20% more for a short amount of time.  I returned the item (Amazon is/has always had THE BEST customer service) after being given the opportunity to identify the cost difference.  So I do have the shaver - shaves great (dry) and no cleaning solutions necessary.  I don&#x27;t cut myself (cost a fortune in new white dress shirts) and life is good.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my boyfriend and he loves it! This was his first new shaver in about 5 years so this was a major step up. He said the ease of cleaning and the battery life are just amazing!</li>
    <li> Three years ago I purchased a Braun 7000 razor which considering the price, has been pretty disappointing. It didn&#x27;t shave any closer or more comfortably than a Norelco which I had used for years (updating every couple of years). When the Braun&#x27;s blades needed replacement and the chrome finish started to peel off, I began looking around for something better. The reviews on the Panasonic indicated that it was superior to Braun at about half the price. So I gave it a shot. It has indeed been superior to the Braun in every way. And I don&#x27;t have to buy cleaning solution every couple of months at a steep price. (Considering it&#x27;s only denatured alcohol.)  If you have the double whammy.....tough beard and sensitive skin, give this one a try.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had a number of Panasonic razors over the years and have always been impressed but this model takes the range to new heights. Not only is it much quieter but does a fantastic job of shaving whether wet or dry and the cleaning method couldn&#x27;t be simpler and certainly a great deal cheaper than buying cartridges. All in all a highly recommended shaving system.</li>
    <li> close shave&lt;br /&gt;time saver&lt;br /&gt;beats any norelco or braun i have had&lt;br /&gt;easy to clean&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;cant go wrong with this one!</li>
    <li> I bought this razor a bit over a month ago, and it was my second electric razor. I bought my first one about 20 years ago, used it for a few weeks, and went back to a blade. At the time I was convinced that no electric could match a blade. This razor changed my mind about that. My face is so incredibly smooth after I shave with it, it is incredible. I shave in the shower, so water resistance is a must.&lt;br /&gt;A little lather, and a two minute shave, and I am good to go. A charge lasts about 3 weeks. I would also say that using a shaving gel and an aftershave gel makes the shave better. There was a little irritation for the first week, but that is all gone now. I recommend this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDITED TO ADD:&lt;br /&gt;So after 6 months, the razor died. I use it to shave in the shower, and it looks like water damaged it. I am lowering the rating from 5 stars to two, because a razor that costs $140 should last longer than six months.</li>
    <li> This is the best electric shaver I have ever had. Far better shave than an old Braun 5000. Charges in about an hour and lasts 2 weeks.  Not readily available in the UK so I had to order from the USA.  Price was 30% of the UK price for a [[ASIN:B002N5MHLK Panasonic ES-LA93-K  Men&#x27;s Shaver]] which I think is a waste of money as the only difference is that the LA 93 comes with a cleaner, so they can sell you expensive cleaning supplies .  The LA 63 is very easy to clean with a bit of liquid soap and tap water, once a week. Cleans perfectly.  The only niggle is the on/off button is poorly placed -  I often switch it off inadvertently while shaving, but you can set the lock to prevent it happening.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll just repeat what everyone else says on the up side. This shaver gives the best cut of any current shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, how could they make a shaver that won&#x27;t run direct off the cord? Could it be that tough? Sometimes, you&#x27;ll use the saver and it&#x27;ll be near dead and you set it down and run out the door. That evening, you don&#x27;t remember to put it on the cord to charge, so next morning, it&#x27;s dead or dies while you are using it. Not a problem if you&#x27;re anal retentive and up an hour early, just charge it up. But if you&#x27;re like the rest of us and running behind, dancing around teenagers in the bathroom, etc. having a shaver that can&#x27;t run plugged in is a big time negative.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seems like this was an oversight. Hard to believe it can&#x27;t be set-up that way. Most every other shaver does. Which is why I have to keep my old braun in the drawer for emergencies. Bad news.</li>
    <li> This is decent shaver, when it worked. I never was able to get very close shave, but shave quality was acceptable (mediocre). Unfortunately after about 10 month, electric motor stopped working. I sent shaver to the Panasonic repair center two weeks ago, because it was still on warranty (2y). Did not get anything back from them. This is a little inconvenient, not only I had to pay for shipping but I also had to buy another shaver. This new shaver (another leading Brand for about the same price), is so much better than Panasonic that I don&#x27;t even care if they repair it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update (12/23/2013): Still waiting for Panasonic to honor the warranty and repair the shaver. It has been more than six month. If this is how Panasonic stands behind their products, I will never buy anything from them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update (6/2/2014): I got a new replacement shaver from Panasonic. It took them almost a year to do this. I updated review from one to 3 stars. I would still not recommended this shaver to anyone, but at least the company stands behind their products. Although I wish their processing speed was faster.</li>
    <li> It work very good and clear very conveniently. I brought it with $119.99 but now the price is $99.99. I lost $20!</li>
    <li> Be aware this model has the motor and stuff in the head so it will not fit the cleaning cradle of the others.  Been using this for over a year now and still shaves decently well dry, better wet. (Actually to save time these days, I just shave in the shower. Takes about 3.5 min which is really nice since I come from using a straight razor.) Doesn&#x27;t shave as closely as straight razor (well nothing does), especially around the neck area where it meets the jaw and by the ears, but I guess that&#x27;s mostly due to the wide head. However, the time savings makes it tolerable. Haven&#x27;t needed to replace anything yet, including blades. I run the battery down until it starts flashing 10% left, then charge it up. After a year of use this way, it still appears to retain its charge just as long as it always has. As others have mentioned, would be nice if it came with a stand for drying. The locking mechanism is worthless, easier to just hold it with your fingers. And the trimmer is decent at longer hair like sideburns, but inevitably it&#x27;s simpler to just use a straight razor to ensure a clean edge.  I give it 4 stars because of the time savings. 3 stars in terms of closeness of shave and actually getting most of it done instead of leaving strange patches like other electric shavers do.  UPDATE: 2013-01-08, well, the lcd screen crapped out about 2 months ago. some of the blue letters appear, but fractionally, so that you can&#x27;t actually read anything. it all still seems to work, but you can&#x27;t figure out the status.  UPDATE: 2014-01-19, So I bought the replacement blades and foils and wow! I should&#x27;ve replaced them sooner! Definitely like brand new again. It&#x27;s always hard to judge when to replace since everyone&#x27;s hair is different and treatment of the shaver is different, but I&#x27;d say on average use, about 6-8 months warrants a replacing. The only con is the price: each replacement set runs about $30 on the low end to I&#x27;ve seen as high as mid $40s.  UPDATE: 2014-04-28, Well the battery just doesn&#x27;t hold a charge like it used to anymore. I searched online and found the appropriate replacement battery. Swapped it out and the thing works well again. Be aware that you need to reseal very well to prevent water intrusion!!  UPDATE: 2014-06-30, Even though I replaced the battery with the OEM Panasonic model, the shaver doesn&#x27;t hold the charge as well as the original In as little as 4 shaves, it needs recharging again. Disappointed. I took it apart to swap again, but the replacement batteries are now running about $30 min.  UPDATE: 2014-07-30, I bit the bullet and bought a new one. LV61 arc5</li>
    <li> Got this as a Christmas gift for husband and loves the new shaver. It&#x27;s been 5 months and the shaver is still working nicely. It gets a nice close shave and gets around the tough edges.</li>
    <li> I finally pulled the trigger yesterday and bought the Panasonic ES-LA63-S over the Norelco 1250x/40 which was the other contending shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been a Norelco man since the past 10 -12 years now so it was a tough choice for me to move to a foil shaver over a rotary. Ultimately I decided to go to a foil shaver because I wanted to try something new and because I read quite a few reviews that said foils are closer shavers then rotary. I also read quite a bit of very good reviews about the Panasonic shavers.  Honestly I think they are both very comparable and the Norelco is probably even a bit better in built quality, but in the end I didn&#x27;t like being tied to a base for charging the shaver and I didn&#x27;t like the fact that my past Norelco&#x27;s came with mediocre trimmer. I felt I should give foil shaver a chance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this shaver yesterday and used it today for the first time. I was really impressed with the smoothness of the shave. One thing I noticed right off the bat was that the hair that was being cut by the Panasonic was so fine it turned the water/shaving cream into a gray paste while the hair from the Norelco&#x27;s I have had in the past have been tinny chips but not fine powder like. I have fairly thick hair and it grows in all directions on my neck but the shaver took care of everything in one run. No issues for me like some of the other reviews I read.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I was already an electric shaver user, it didn&#x27;t take time for me to get accustomed to the shave. It felt very natural and comfortable. I did not have any redness or irritation from the shave and my skin didn&#x27;t get dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cleaning it was a breeze and personally don&#x27;t think the automatic cleaner is necessary for a $100 more. The only thing I wish the shaver came with was a base so I can have a place to stand instead of laying it flat down when drying.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used electric shavers for a number of years now.  I&#x27;ve found using a blade is too rough for my skin.  I&#x27;ve used this razor both wet and dry and for me personally the wet method with shaving cream provides the closest shave.  It is slightly more time consuming, but I enjoy the ritual of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My beard isn&#x27;t particularly thick - I can grow a mean goatee, my beard is acceptable - but not as thick as the mustache and chin area.  This shaver works as well in the thick parts as it does anywhere.  It is powerful and well built.  For $130 bucks with shipping it is a no brainer.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not new to the excellent performance and quality of the Panasonic shavers...this is my third up-grade. They keep getting better every time. The Panasonic ES-LA63-S is great if you want a close shave or if you are keeping \\&quot;The Bald Look\\&quot; goin&#x27; on, like me. After I donated my ponytail (of 18 years) to Locks of Love I used a Norelco and cold steel with little success. Then another \\&quot;Bald by Choice\\&quot; friend suggested a Panasonic and it only took one time and I was hooked. The prices are very good on E-bay and Amazon. This purchase was very good...good price, free shipping and delivery in just 3 days.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been a Norelco user most of my adult life (I&#x27;m 57). I even tried an expensive Grundig once and sent it back. Didn&#x27;t like it. This Panasonic is by far the best shaver I&#x27;ve ever used. The biggest advantage seems to be the RPM speed. It is just so clearly more powerful and that speed makes for a faster, cleaner cut. The engineering is great, too. The thing swivels and rotates and makes the Norelco individual shaving heads moot. It&#x27;s a breeze to snap off the head and blow out the hair.&lt;br /&gt;And because it&#x27;s waterproof, you can pour a little liquid soap onto the heads, watch it foam up and then rinse it clean as a whistle. Don&#x27;t need to do that every day but, say, once a week and you&#x27;re good.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m used to dry shaving and an electric so there was no adjustment there. I thought I might like using shaving cream, which you can do with this shaver, but I found it difficult to pull my face taut and get a clean line at the sideburns and mustache so I gave up on that. I haven&#x27;t even tried using it in the shower. I&#x27;m good with dry shaving.&lt;br /&gt;An anecdote? On Sunday afternoon, after not shaving since Friday morning, my beard stubble was itchy so I just did a fast pass on my face and loved the result. I would have never done that with my previous shavers. This thing is just that comfortable - I don&#x27;t dread shaving anymore.</li>
    <li> I was a long time, die hard Braun user. When my 7 series razor finally gave up I though I would just buy another one. However after reading many less than stellar reviews of the current Braun line up, particularly since their acquisition by Gillette, I decided to look elsewhere. The Panasonic ES-LA63 is where I ended up. It is significantly less expensive then the Braun (which I like)and then shave is REMARKABLE. In all my years of shaving I have always felt that an electric was a compromise from using a blade. Well have now been corrected. The LA63 is able to give me a blade close shave even when used dry with no skin irritation at all. It even works well on my neck, an area that even blades have failed me. Good work Panasonic! I&#x27;m definitely sold on your engineering.</li>
    <li> I am now a electric shaver convert ! I don&#x27;t have any more shaving rash and can now wear a tie. I use it in the shower. I don&#x27;t need to lather as I used to. All i have to do is wipe my skin with the soap, and then start shaving. I was also able to do a quick dry shave when I was camping and it still looked great. After about three weeks my girlfriend thought there was something wrong as my skin was now all smooth and shiny. I&#x27;ve even noticed some of my red spots have also softened as they now don&#x27;t have any regular irritation. If you were like me and haven&#x27;t tried an electric razor for a while, go and do ya self a favor, and grab this one.</li>
    <li> Owned for almost 2yrs and still works like it&#x27;s new!</li>
    <li> very close, clean shave. very pleased with electric shaver</li>
    <li> This is absolutely fantastic! I retired my Braun Series 3 for this one and I am glad I did! Normally by the afternoon I would have a scruffy sandpaper face but it&#x27;s still smooth. I also shave my head and the wider head took a little more getting used to but it did a fantastic job on my dome as well. I recommend locking the head in place for those who do this. With my old shaver my head always felt a little violated, however, this one was a simple buzz and rock on with your day.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this shaver for about 3 months and I&#x27;m disappointed with it. There are many areas of my face, e.g. underneath my jaw and my neck where I can&#x27;t get a decent shave. I always have to pull out my manual razor to finish the job. It&#x27;s okay for touch-ups but for a decent shave from start to finish I regret spending the money for this shaver.</li>
    <li> Feels solid and shaves smoothly. The higher speed motor vaporizes hair. I really like the floating head and % battery indicator light. Pop-up trimmer is small, but it works well. Anticipate this will last 10 years.</li>
    <li> Was very happy initially, excellent shave. Two montns later battery started failing. Got response for a company by email to send the shaver to Texas for a battery replacement, may take 10 days. I was not able to get  live rep to mail a replacement battery. Do not buy such expensive shaver with a bad battery</li>
    <li> The electric shaver vs razor battle has been back and forth for me since I was 16.  I have owned several electric shavers to include a Norelco rotary blade electric razor, Panasonic foil blade shaver, and most recently the Braun 8595 razor.  These shavers would work well for a while, but I just would not get the close shave I wanted, and I would end up going back to the conventional way of shaving while spending hundreds of dollars on disposable blades.  The Braun shaver was probably the best out of all the Electric shavers I owned to this point, but the fact that I had to buy the cleaning solution for it frequently became tiresome.  It is frustrating because I have sensitive skin, and electric shavers give me no irritation,and I do not get razor burn when I use them.  In the profession I am in I am required to look professional, so shaving is scrutinized closely.  In order to get the close shave I need, I have had to use a combination of my Braun shaver and Mach 5 razors because I do not get the shave I need from an electric shaver alone. I have to spend a decent amount of money on expensive shaving creams and after shave balms to help with that close, irritation and razor burn shave. The electric shavers work well in my face area, but always fail in my neck.  I have used electric shavers to shave my face, but use Mach 5 razors to shave my neck.  Because of my sensitive skin, my neck is always irritated after I shave.  With this said I finally broke down and became willing try the latest technology in electric shavers because the cost and time put into shaving were becoming a burden.  Armed with the desire to have a close, quick, inexpensive, and irritation/razor burn free shave, I began looking at reviews from various sites including amazon on the latest electric shavers.  The most important factor I wanted in a new shaver is its ability to give me a close irritation free shave on my neck as this has been my problem area for years. I looked at all brands to include Braun, Phillips, Panasonic, and Remington.  Because I currently owner a Braun Shaver, and based on the positive reviews of the Series 7-760cc, I began leaning heavily to purchasing that shaver.  It wasn&#x27;t until I read and article on line about Panasonic&#x27;s Arc series shavers about how it was designed to shave problem areas such as the neck and chin that I began looking into the Panasonics more closely.  The more reviews I read on the various Arc series shavers, the more I began to see that these razor may be what I have been looking for all these years.  I ruled out the Braun based on the price and having to deal with the cleaning solution again.  I narrow the search down to two shavers, the Panasonic ES8243A Arc IV and the ES-LA-63 Arc IV.  Both have overwhelming reviews and both are rated and 4 1/2 stars.  The LA-63 is about $50 more, but still considerably less expensive than the Braun.  Based on what users have said in their reviews, I felt the LA-63 would suit my needs in shaving.  I bought the LA-63 two weeks ago.  In its first task, I had not shaven in a week and had a considerable amount of facial hair.  The Braun I had had issues with snagging my hair when it got too long.  The LA-63 had no such issue and shaved very smoothly, plus I used it in the shower where as my Braun could not be used wet.  The shaver shaved very quickly too, taking only 3 and 1/2 minutes.  Under my old shaving routine, it would have taken about ten.  I was amazed at how smooth my face was after I was done shaving.  The best part is that I had little irritation and no razor burn.  I did experience some irritation, but this was expected as there is a period of adjustment whenever a new electric razor is used.  The shaver also cleans easy because you can use hand soap and do not have to rely cleaning cartridges.  The 5 minute quick charge is also a nice feature.  Though there were many positive features, the shaver let me down in one area, the neck.  The shaver could not clean up all of my neck and left several patches of hair.  I tried going over these areas several times, but only caused my self irritation.  I had to used a conventional razor to shave my neck area.  This was a big disappointment because one of the reasons I bought the razor was the Arc series shaver was designed to tackle the neck hair.  I did not want to give up on the razor yet.  I figured I would give it some time and try shaving wet and dry, and use different types of shave creams.  The results were that I still got a close, smooth shave on my face, but the neck still was a problem area.  Shaving dry did help get a little close with the neck, but it still was not perfect.  It was about to give up on this razor when I discovered Aramis Lab Series Electric Shave Solution.  Using this product in combination with the LA-63 gave me that close shave on my neck I need without razor burn or irritation.  I now have no complaints about this razor and it is the best electric shaver I have ever used.</li>
    <li> I bought the ES-LA63-S in May 2010 from a local store, and the comfort and closeness of the shave far surpassed the Braun Series 7-790cc Pulsonic Shaver and numerous Norelco shavers that I had used previously.  I especially liked using it wet with standard shaving cream, which provided a shave that was 99% as close as a Gillette Fusion razor.  I liked it so much, I bought one from Amazon for my wife to use on her legs and she likes it much better than the Norelco unit she had before.    Unfortunately, after four months, my ES-LA63-S developed problems with the display where most of the segments were illuminated all the time, making it impossible to read the state of charge or any of the status flags.  It did work OK right after charging, but after using it the next day, it was back to the mixed up display.  So I called Panasonic Customer Service and got directions to completely discharge and recharge for 8 hours.  (As before, it worked after charging, but returned to the scrambled display after the next use.)  The agent told me if that didn&#x27;t help, to return it for exchange.    So at my expense, I sent it UPS to the Panasonic Exchange Center in Texas, where it arrived on Oct 5th.  Two weeks later, I received a replacement shaver: an ES8249S!  I don&#x27;t get how they think this is a comparable unit (lower list price, only one motor, and with the annoying charging/cleaning station).  If this is comparable, why do they even bother making the ES-LA63-S?  They enclosed a form letter apologizing for the substitution in order to provide the \\&quot;highest quality and most timely service\\&quot;.    They also included a URL for their customer satisfaction survey, which, needless to say, didn&#x27;t get a glowing response from me.  I&#x27;ll see if I hear back from them.  I&#x27;m not sure if I have any recourse, other than to write reviews like this!</li>
    <li> So far so good. I haven&#x27;t had the razor but a few weeks; but for the money and the cost of Gillette Razor blades how can I go wrong.</li>
    <li> For the price I was expecting to be blown away. Lesser than that, I was expecting it to replace my cheaper and older Norelco rotary. It did neither. What the Panasonic has is build quality and speed. I give it two stars for that. I shave dry and I don&#x27;t have much facial hair, but my strands are thicker. This could be a \\&quot;beard buster\\&quot; for people who get 5&#x27;oclock shadows really quick and just want a touch up. That is not me. I&#x27;m looking for a full shave. The Panasonic won&#x27;t rip hairs out like Norelco, however, it does NOT clear hairs well in sensitive areas. The truth is that I had to use my old shaver to touch up what the Panasonic missed. Nobody should pay this much. If you expect yourself to be presentable, this won&#x27;t work! Thankfully Amazon let me return it! This shaver has a 30 day guarantee.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*update* I stand by my review. I have used electrics all my life. It just failed the test and couldn&#x27;t beat a cheap Norelco (one in which I&#x27;ve never replaced the blades I might add).</li>
    <li> Superior quality shaver</li>
    <li> Very, very good shaver.  It comes close to earning a 5 star rating from me.  Very close shave and reasonably fast.  Battery life is one thing that I thought would have been a little better.  Battery life is not bad, ........ it&#x27;s just that it is not quite as good as my previous Panasonic shaver.  I say &amp;#34;Buy it&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> good quality!! exceeds my expectations!!</li>
    <li> Bought this in early June &#x27;11 as a replacement for Braun&#x27;s most expensive model.  Was a Braun fan for 20-plus years, until that last one fell apart exactly 13 months after purchase. Too many small, weak, plastic parts used at stress points. In addition, the Braun required expensive replacement fluid cartridges in its cleaning system.  The Panasonic, thus far, works exactly as advertised. It shaves as well as the Braun, possibly slighter better than. The best feature is water cleaning - a relief after the time consuming, complex, noisy, and constantly-expensive process of the Braun. As a bonus: the battery charge on the Panasonic seems bottomless. I highly recommend this shaver.</li>
    <li> A lousy shaver, but give you a close shave.  May give you a little irritation either dry or wet shave.  A very good shaver if you can get it for less than 1/3 of MSRP.    Comparing to Norelco Arcitec 1050 (dry shaver):    * Better shaver in dry and wet mode      Comparing to Norelco 1280X/45    * Dry mode:  Norelco will give you a closer shave and no irritation    * Wet mode:  Panasonic is the winer (just 1%), but may give you a little irritation.  I don&#x27;t feel any irritation with Norelco 1280x/45 in wet/dry mode.    * Charger:  Norelco requires the stand to charge, not a good solution for travelers.      After 2 weeks of usage:  *  Wet mode:  I learn to use this Panasonic Shaver properly and don&#x27;t have any irritation anymore.  It does a better job than Norelco 1280x, it will give you      very close shave.  A very good product for under $80.00</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Panasonic electric shavers for years and have always been satisfied with them. This shaver tops any electric shaver I have ever used in terms of build quality and performance. I use Kanon pre-electric lotion with this shaver and receive the closest and most comfortable shave I have ever experienced; all within three minutes per shave. Don&#x27;t wait, purchase this product and start enjoying your daily shaving experience!</li>
    <li> ok does  not get all under the chin</li>
    <li> The 5-star review might be a little misleading.  Every Panasonic shaver I&#x27;ve owned (all triple-blade models) has given me a 5-star shave, and all give as good a shave as the ES-LA63.  I didn&#x27;t expect much (or any) improvement in shave quality because there wasn&#x27;t a lot of room FOR improvement.  I&#x27;ve owned the ES8224, ES8043, ES8807 and an ES7103 (which I got at for $35 a year ago).  The ES8807 is my all-time favorite shaver...small, precise, and easy to navigate...that shaver \\&quot;just works\\&quot; for me.  But I saw the ES-LA63 drop to an absurdly low price of $93 from Amazon and couldn&#x27;t resist.  The one negative with Panasonic for me has always been the Adams apple area because the middle trimmer blade sits up higher on Panasonics, causing irritation (and even cuts) in this area.  I think the ES-LA63 is a little better (I assume because the vibrating head raises the hair and doesn&#x27;t require as much pressure), but that is the only noticeable difference.      Bottom line...if you can still get the ES-LA63 for $93, go for it.  It&#x27;s their top-of-the-line, latest and greatest model.  But if the price jumps back up to $150 or even $130, you&#x27;re better off getting a cheaper triple-blade Panasonic like the ES-8103, which is currently a steal for $53 at Amazon.    Finally, Amazon had a limited offer of free 1-day shipping on this shaver.  I wasn&#x27;t in any hurry so a week would&#x27;ve been fine, plus I didn&#x27;t think there was any chance they could deliver on the one-day promise.  I placed my order the evening of 12/21, and to my amazement, my doorbell rang the evening of 12/22 and there was my shaver.  If only cable companies, electricians, and plumbers could be this reliable.</li>
    <li> I HAD PROBLEMS WITH MY BRAUN 7 SERIES &amp; NEEDED A REPLACEMENT.  I APPRECIATED THE POSITIVE REVIEWS &amp; PURCHASED THIS PANASONIC.  THIS IS THE CLOSEST SHAVE I HAVE EVER HAD WITH AN ELECTRIC RAZOR.  &amp; THE PRICE IS MUCH LESS THAN THE BRAUN (BTW - I SENT THE BRAUN TO BE REPAIRED - THEY SENT IT BACK FIXED AT NO CHARGE SINCE IT WAS UNDER WARRANTY, HOWEVER I HAVE NOT USED IT SINCE ITS RETURN SOME 2 WEEKS AGO.  DEF RECOMMEND THIS PANASONIC.</li>
    <li> I purchased this on a Black Friday deal in 2010, the list price was a little much for me.  My airline has recently lost my last electric (a hair pulling torture device made by Norelco).  I almost sent the airline a thank you card.  I have been using this shaver almost every day for one year, it is without a doubt the best I have ever used.  Previous electric shavers:  Purchased in 2000:   Braun bar style, sub par shaving and battery life. I swore off electrics for years after this razor  Purchased in 2005:   Norelco three head, I forget the model number.  This was a very good shaver, used it for years.  Purchased in 2009 (Old Norelco died, what a good razor):  Purchased new one, 8/9 Something series, almost $100, expecting something as good as the previous.  What I got was a hair pulling torture device.  If you went more then 1 day without shaving, it would punish you by randomly pulling hairs out while shaving.  I tried new blades, same problem.  I barely used this razor.  Purchased in 2010:  Panasonic ES-LA63  Pros:  - GREAT shave, closest shave on a electric, bar none  - DOES NOT PULL STUBBLE!!! (I cannot say this enough)  - Wet/Dry is nice, especially for cleaning  - Lots of shaving surface, shaves quickly  - Good blade life (got a year from the last set)  Cons:  - Cannot run while plugged in, this is inconvenient if you need a quick shave and the battery is dead  - Like all electrics shavers I have used, it struggles when stubble is long (2+ days) and on stubborn neck hair  - Blue LED is bright (i.e. flashes when charged) which is annoying at night  - Expensive!  Overall, this is the best electric razor that I have ever used.  I had originally thought the list price was a bit much, however I must admit that I would pay the list price ($120 right now).  If you have sworn of electrics, I would suggest you give this razor a try.</li>
    <li> I bought this shaver in 2015. I&#x27;ve bought several different models of Panasonic wet/dry shavers in the past. This one was by far the most expensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has also been the biggest disappointment. While my shaves were noticeably closer than with previous wet/dry shavers, here I am less than five months later with a non-functioning shaver, clearly due to a product defect and not from any damage I have done to it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A couple of weeks ago, it had appeared that a little water was someone getting into the LED read-out. It began to display incorrect information, for instance, lighting up all of the indicators at once so that I couldn&#x27;t tell how much charge was left. Within the past couple of days, the LED indicator stopped working altogether, displaying nothing, although the back-light still seems to work. And now the shaver won&#x27;t even turn on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another complaint: I realize there is a little more RPMs with this model than others, but the battery life was unacceptably low. With previous, less-expensive shavers, I could count on going at least a few weeks in between charges. With this model, I&#x27;ve been lucky to get more than a week on a single charge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very disappointing, especially considering that less than five months later, I&#x27;m stuck with it. No refund, no return.</li>
    <li> Used my Gillette Mach3 for the last time today ($2.50 per blade) two descent shaves per blade. Just received my Panasonic ES-LA63-s, what a great shave. I will purchase two more Panasonic electric shavers for Christmas one for my son and one for my son-in-law. Merry Christmas.</li>
    <li> How this product got 4 stars is beyond me. Don&#x27;t waste your money on it; you can buy a decent shaver by less than half price.</li>
    <li> Having used a Norelco shaver for more than 45 years, following the example set by my father,  I never anticipated switching brands.  Typically, I got a good shave from the Norelco&#x27;s and they were solid and long lasting.  I got a new Norelco a little over a year ago, replacing one more than 10 yrs old, and was disappointed with the shave, the lack of power and the light, cheap feel the new Norelco had in my hand.   When I saw the Gold Box sale combined with a rebate on the Panasonic ES-LA63 and the high level of reviews,  I decided to give it a try.   I can say without reservation that it is giving me the best shave I have ever had,  has plenty of power and I&#x27;m enjoying that I can shave in the shower.   I&#x27;m still on the first charge so I can&#x27;t comment on time between charges or battery reliability.    Highly recommended so far !!</li>
    <li> I use an electric shaver for convenience when I am not going anywhere \\&quot;special,\\&quot; or in between blade shaves. I have a tough beard, and use a Mach3Fusion blade when I really want a close shave.  I&#x27;ve had 3 Norelco shavers. The last one, a SpeedXL, finally suffered a slow death. Time for a change.  Past experience with a Braun  but found it merely adequate, so I was not about to fork over the big bucks for a shaver that seemed more intent to feature its cleaning cycle than on cutting whiskers.   Panasonic touted some newer technology, a nice design, and garnered good ratings, esp. here on Amazon&#x27;s review (thanks guys!)  I chose this model--this is one without the cleaning/charging stand-- because I did not see any advantage paying an additional one hundred dollars and then having to purchase cleaning cartridges.   So far this shaver excels in speed, comfort, and closeness, including longer neck hairs. Dry shave was good, smoother and faster than the Norelco, with less irritation. The wet shave with a gel foam rivals a blade in closeness, but going \\&quot;wet\\&quot; sort of negates the convenience factor.Maybe I will try it in the shower.  Cleaning is easy, so do not bother with the upgraded series. The trimmer works well, but is more awkward than the one on the Norelco.  I can not comment as yet on battery life and recharging characteristics.  Time will tell</li>
    <li> I also have a Braun 9595 and like it as well. However, I think this might even be better. I was planning on using it as a travel shaver, but like the Braun it&#x27;s a bit heavy.     It shaves close, doesn&#x27;t hurt, and and easy to clean.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used a rotary 3-head shaver for years and finally decided to try this standard shaver.  I&#x27;ve been using it for a month now and taken it on severl long business trips. So far it has worked well and I&#x27;m happy with the purchase.  I would recommend this shaver to anyone interested.  I love how easy it is to clean.</li>
    <li> Gives a very close shave for a electric razor.  Battery lasted 3 weeks with normal 1min or so shaves.&lt;br /&gt;Head is a bigger than wanted, but requires less passes to get the job done.</li>
    <li> Due to dementia, my husband of over 50 years could no longer shave his face and do a good job.  He frequently had knicks or a rash.  When I started shaving him I couldn&#x27;t do a good job and it was a messy and time intensive project.  He started to grow a beard and neither of us was happy with that.  I tried using another electric razor as well as his gillette mach something razor.  When I read in an Amazon review that this razor provided a good as well as gentle shave, I decided to buy one.  It has been one of my best purchases ever.  Takes about 2 minutes to shave him smoother than he could even when young - no skin breakouts and if the razor lasts a year it will have saved us money compared to using blades and shave cream.  We are both very pleased.  He enjoys my doing this for him and he&#x27;s more kissable than before.</li>
    <li> My best electric shaver yet, but I&#x27;ve only owned $30 shavers.  Not as boot as a blade but quicker and easier and I haven&#x27;t used a blade since getting this.</li>
    <li> I have found Panasonic ES-LA63-S Arc IV Multi Flex Nanotech Rechargeable Shaver to be the best solid will build shaver that Panasonic has come out with. So far gives one of the best shaves I have ever had from Panasonic. I have always used Panasonic shavers, although I have tried other name brand shavers I always ended up taking them back because none of them for me anyway can beat Panasonic shaver&#x27;s period. The price I got from Amazon and the $30.00 Rebate from Panasonic was a steal for the quality of the shaver I got. Would recommend this shaver to anybody, but everybody&#x27;s face is different too.</li>
    <li> First and most important, this is my first purchase of an electric shaver. I&#x27;ve used a blade for over fifty years, so bear in mind, I&#x27;m not comparing this shaver to any other electric shavers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I had to live with this shaver, I could, but a blade is both quicker and better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A lot quicker. The best time with the electric was two minutes, fifteen seconds. With a blade, I can easily shave in fifty to sixty seconds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And yes, better. With the electric, I found that their were certain whiskers that would not cut no matter what I did. I ended up pulling them out with a tweezers. Never happened with a blade.</li>
    <li> Great shaver.  On the expensive side but worth it.  Very smooth and quick especially when used with shaving cream</li>
    <li> I had not purchased a new electric razor in many years.  I alternated between blade shaving and the old electric shaver.  After getting frustrated with the results of the old electric shaver, I decided a new one is in order.  I did my research and read the reviews on this model and decided, for the price point, this was a good value. I am not disappointed at all.  Works really well with a thin amount of shaving cream, and cleans up quickly.  Very happy with the purchase.</li>
    <li> This DOES give a good shave, especially with Billy Jealousy shave gel BUT it is poorly manufactured: it is NOT built to last. I&#x27;ve had two break in two years. Buy something else. Even if your failure falls within the two year warrant (for me one did, and one was just days beyond), you will still need a backup during the three weeks it will take to get the unit back to you from their facility in Texas. Save yourself the hassel! Postscript: I have now had 3 break in 3 years! Boy am I stupid! Don&#x27;t be as stupid as me! Don&#x27;t buy this product.</li>
    <li> This was bought as a gift for my very picky husband. He is very happy with it.Gives a very close shave and recommends it to others.</li>
    <li> Bought this razor as a gift for my hubby. He loves it. Says it&#x27;s the best electric razor ever. He has very thick beard and says it does a great job!</li>
    <li> I purchased this item more than a year ago and I am completely happy with the performance of this shaver. It&#x27;s not a blade, which works well for me as I wasn&#x27;t buying a blade.  But if you want a good, comfortable shave that can you can use wet or dry, this shaver is an excellent choice.  It charges quickly and lasts for weeks without a recharge needed.</li>
    <li> Shaver wont operate while charging! Will see how long this will last.</li>
    <li> LCD went out after 10 months. Not cool.</li>
    <li> Great shave on heavy beard. Doesn&#x27;t slow down under heavy use. Top notch. I bought a new one after 3 years of daily use instead of buying replacement blades.</li>
    <li> I regularly use a blade razor for the majority of my shave and then use an electric shaver to clean up the nooks, crannies, and tender spots. I mention this to let you know that I&#x27;ve been using an electric for years so I have a good basis for comparison. The 2 critical features of an electric shaver to evaluate, in my opinion, are closeness of the shave and ease of use. The closeness of the shave for this razor is fine, it&#x27;s as good or better than my current shavers, which are a Panasonic and a Braun (one for home and one for travel). Unfortunately, it&#x27;s not as close as a blade shave. I&#x27;ve yet to find an electric shaver that shaves as close as a blade and after testing this shaver, I&#x27;m still looking. I will say that it is very comfortable to shave with however. It&#x27;s quiet and smooth, no pulling of the whiskers.  We&#x27;ll see what happens when the blades get dull but until then it&#x27;s completely painless to use. This applies to both the wet shaving and the dry shaving. I found no appreciable difference in the closeness of the shave between wet and dry. The ease of use is above average. The handle is comfortable and fits well in your hand. The lcd display is easy to read and has some good info and some useless info. It will tell you how much of a charge you have left and when it&#x27;s time to recharge (useful). It holds a charge for quite awhile. I&#x27;ve been using it for about 3 weeks now and it&#x27;s still operating on the charge it came with. It will also tell you how much time used on the current shave (useless). The blade head of this shaver is huge. It&#x27;s about the size of a tangerine which makes it pretty useful for the big areas of your face but pretty unwieldy for the areas like under your nose and around your sideburns. There is a pop-up trimmer for sideburns that works well, although I have a tough time getting it to line up straight. Overall it&#x27;s a pretty good shaver but loses points for the size of the blade head and for the very high price. I can&#x27;t imagine why anyone would want to pay that much for an electric razor. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this unless it was about $200 cheaper.ld want to pay that much for an electric razor. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this unless it was about $200 cheaper.</li>
    <li> Electric shavers  ----------------  If you buying an electric shaver for the first time, skip this section and read the next    Electric shavers basically come in 2 types - Rotary (philips norelco) &amp; foil (braun &amp; panasonic)    Rotaries are good for cutting longer hairs let us say you skip to shave over a holiday then start shaving on Monday morning. Foil shavers are faster and easier to adapt to, since they are very much like your gilette razors, but there are a few downsides - foils are difficult to clean since the hair gets trapped in the inner chamber and foil shavers give you more burn compared to rotary blades.     This is a foil shaver    About Panasonic ES-LA63-S  -------------------------  First of all, I am apalled by lack of product description by Amazon/Panasonic for this product on this product page (atleast as of Nov&#x27;2009).  There is a very informative comparision chart between all the Panasonic foil shavers on this page:     I would suggest that a buyer needs to browse though this product comparison list before jumping into a buy decision:  http://www.amazon.com/Panasonic-ES8109S-Vortex-Technology-HydraClean/dp/B000VKZMHK/ref&#x3D;sr_1_6?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;s&#x3D;hpc&amp;qid&#x3D;1257820434&amp;sr&#x3D;1-6    Shave Quality  :  Rotary shavers have never been able to offer me the kind of close shave that I have been able to get through this particular foil shaver.   I have tried cheaper foil shavers before, but almost always it has left me with razor burns.    East of use  : The flexible heads make it very easy to shave around the neck.  If you are graduating from a Gilette to this one - you will find that this is much easier to adapt to than a rotary shaver.  Someone even after 3 years of being with rotary shavers, I still get a bit fearful as I take my rotary shaver around the neck, but not with this Panasonic foil shavers    Hygiene &amp; Safety  :  Why is hygene all the more important in an electric shaver ?  You see the blades are so much close to your skin and obviously they do scrape offlive matter into an enclosed chamber along with the hair.  Now, if you these blades were not to be hypoallergic, they would encourage growth of these live matter along with bacteria.  But the Panasonic ES-LA63-S comes with hypoallergic blades which ward off growth of such bacteria and keep it clean, of course you have to do your due diligence of rinsing the blades in hot water and cleaning it.    Panasonic should have bundled the hydraclean system along with this shaver instead of creating a new model ES-LA93-K priced at $100 more than this.    Other features  : Not too worried about the other features such as battery life - it is not a mobile phone to be held in hand for hours together - almost ALL the shavers in the market today offer a charge to last for a couple of days, which is good enough.     -- Another important thing is to dual voltage operability if you travel to Asia/Europe and this shaver can work with dual voltages  -- 14000 rpm : the faster the foil vibrates, the more efficient it is in giving a clean shave on the very first run and this is currently the fastest in the market    Comparison to Braun  : Sorry, I do not have a clue as to how Braun shavers are - they make foil shavers too.  Remington and Philips make rotary shavers.   But I did do some research on foil replacements and found that Panasonic foils are less expensive compared to Braun foils - obviously Panasonic shavers will cost a lot less to maintain over the years      Value for Money  : An investment in a good electric shaver really pays over time - no price is small to wake up each day in the morning, get a clean shave in a minute or two and walk out confidently.  Not with a $20 shaver or even the most expensive rotary shaver will you get this kind of a feeling - I can tell you from my own personal experience.   I did not realize this until I started using the a quality foil shaver like this.</li>
    <li> The Panasonic ES-LA63-S gives an incredible shave, no doubt about it.  It&#x27;s not often I give 5-star reviews, but this razor earns it despite the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After opening the package, charging for a measly 1 hour, it was ready to go, and I took it into the shower with me that night.  I shave in the shower so this is nothing new, and I had been doing so with a \\&quot;lesser\\&quot; Panasonic wet/dry shaver, the ES8249K Arc IV Nano Vortex, which includes the cleaning system.  Worrisome when receiving this considerably more expensive shaver was that it did NOT include the cleaning base into which the razor is inserted.  But, for that night, I didn&#x27;t think about it.  I lathered up with shaving cream, switched on, and received, simply, the best shave I have ever gotten.  That&#x27;s no hyperbole - this razor managed to out-shave the razor I previously thought gave the best-ever shave, relegating my Arc IV to counter-queen status for a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I followed instructions and shaved for several weeks with the new razor alone, then tried the Arc IV again just to make sure.  What I noticed was surprising.  It&#x27;s not *after* the shave that the difference is so shocking.  It&#x27;s the shave itself that is surprising.  The ES-LA63-S shaves smoother and easier than the Arc IV, but the resulting shave is similarly close.  My wife can&#x27;t tell the difference, in fact.  But the during-shave experience is sharply different, and for those who have \\&quot;difficult beards\\&quot; or sensitive skin, I think this is the razor for you.  I have noticed, as one who suffers from, since switching over, less irritated skin and less missed hairs.  It manages to shave extremely close without burning at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the flip side, there&#x27;s the price.  This razor is considerably more expensive than even my Arc IV with cleaning system, which isn&#x27;t cheap.  But I wouldn&#x27;t complain about that - it&#x27;s a fantastic razor that also includes a great self-cleaning system.  However, with that cleaning system comes the repetive cost of cleaning filters.  If they do the job, and they do, I won&#x27;t complain.  But the razors themselves are equipped with Turbo mode created just to clean it of anything that dirties it, so this cleaning system does seem a little unnecessary.  Just pour some liquid soap on the head, hold the power button for a couple of seconds, and it will jump into Turbo mode for about 20 seconds.  Remove the foil/head cover, add more soap, put it in Turbo again, and you&#x27;re done.  With the Arc IV&#x27;s cleaning system, it would go through a 2-hour cleaning cycle and I&#x27;m not really sure what is going on that takes so long.  Is Turbo mode harder on the razor than the cleaner would be?  Only Panasonic knows, and time will likely tell us who lack the cleaning unit the answer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One minor quible: I simply do not understand why the digital readout is not visible while the razor is being used.  The Arc IV&#x27;s display remains lit while it&#x27;s on, displaying both the time the razor has been in use as well as the battery power remaining.  The ES-LA63-S&#x27; display goes blank, only to re-light once it has been turned off.  I simply don&#x27;t understand the point of that.  If it&#x27;s to preserve battery life, it seems a minimal trade-off.  I&#x27;d prefer to have the information available while I&#x27;m using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Speaking of battery life, in just over 3 weeks of pretty much every other day use for approximately 4 minutes each time, it has been recharged just once, and it required one Turbo-mode cleaning in that time as well.  If you&#x27;re looking for a low-maintenance wet-dry shaver and don&#x27;t mind the high cost of admission, I don&#x27;t think you can go wrong with this razor.s.  If they do the job, and they do, I won&#x27;t complain.  But the razors themselves are equipped with Turbo mode created just to clean it of anything that dirties it, so this cleaning system does seem a little unnecessary.

    <li> Background:  My facial hair grows in quickly -- 5 o&#x27;clock shadow type guy, and grows a full beard in a couple weeks.  I&#x27;m also pretty particular about what razors I use (and can use), sticking only to Gillette Mach 3 blades of one variety or another (tried the Schick Quattro, didn&#x27;t like it).  I&#x27;ve never had an electric razor, other than using a low-end model more than 15 years ago which never really did the job.  I was sckeptical an electric razor could do the job for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Immediately after starting to use this product I was impressed.  I get a very, very close shave with it -- comparable to a razor, and without all the effort and mess.  Plus, I find this to be a big time saver for me.  It takes me about 3 minutes to do the job, and it gets done in the shower which is even better in the mornings when I&#x27;m pressed for time (i.e. running late).  I&#x27;ve used it for almost 3 weeks so far, haven&#x27;t touched a razor balde since, and finding it fit into my routine more and more every day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Big, big fan of this electric razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;* takes little time to charge -- about an hour or less.&lt;br /&gt;* it lasts the whole week on one charge.&lt;br /&gt;* it gives  a very smooth shave and doesn&#x27;t irritate sensitive parts of my face/neck as razor blades do.&lt;br /&gt;* it is great to use in the shower&lt;br /&gt;* I&#x27;ve been using it for almost 3 weeks so far and still haven&#x27;t had to clean it (it has an indicator to you when to clean it)&lt;br /&gt;* I expect cleaning it to be super easy&lt;br /&gt;* the travel case is slim, and won&#x27;t take up any more space in my luggage than the razor itaself does.&lt;br /&gt;* pivot head / fixed head / sideburn edge&lt;br /&gt;* heft and size.  I have large hands, and this fits my mits well.  Good solid weight too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;* when recharging, the light is BRIGHT.  I dno&#x27;t leave it charging overnight b/c the light from teh bathroom is noticeable in teh bedroom.  Wow.&lt;br /&gt;* more on the above -- the light blinks too, which is doubly annoying&lt;br /&gt;* doesn&#x27;t do a great job on one part of my face, just under the jaw line.  I frequently have to do this part over.  Not sure if it&#x27;s the razor or me.

    <li> I have been using Panasonic shavers for more than ten years. I switched to Norelco and Braun and always came back to Panasonic. It gives me the most comfortable and closest shave. I have seen the gradual evolution of Panasonic shavers. This one is the best so far. The advantages over the current Panasonic shavers are    1. Pivoting shaving heads: The one I have can only rotate in one direction. This one can rotate in two directions. It does give you a closer touch, and hence a better shave.  2. Four shaving blades: It is one more blade than what I have. Surprisingly, it works better and requires less glides in the same area.  3. LCD display: This is more of a convenience feature. It tells you how much time is used in this shave and how much power is left.    It is not a revolution of Panasonic shavers, but it is a big improvement over the already great products. I like to use it wet because it is less irritating and gives a closer shave. I usually wet my face before I brushes I teeth. So the beards are soft when I shave. I need to apply soap or shaving foam for a smooth shave. My experience is that soap gives you the closest shave, but shaving foam is more comfortable and refreshing. You can try both to see which one you like.    Panasonic shavers are \\&quot;directional\\&quot; shavers. You need to glide the shaver against the growth of the hair to be most effective. You can try to feel the directions of the growth of the hair before and after the shave. After several trials, you will be good at it. I would not spend three hundred dollars on a shaver. But if I had known it is this good, I would not mind spending three hundred dollars on it. After all, you use it everyday. If it gives you a more refreshing start each morning, I would say it is well worth it.    Some reviewers say it is lacking a cleaning system for an expensive shaver like this. Well, you have to spend anther one hundred dollars for ES-LA93-K. It has a cleaning sytem.</li>
    <li> This was the Shaver I having been looking for! Great results! I received a gift card from my wife and children for fathers day with a note to checkout a site called The Art of Shaving. I did, then checked Amazon.com  saved $$ ...&lt;br /&gt;Thank You Amazon..</li>
    <li> It is so good. It&#x27;s the best shaver I have ever used. I&#x27;m so happy! It&#x27;s more clean than other brands.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B004FDYTEQ Panasonic ES-LA63-S Arc IV Multi Flex Nanotech Rechargeable Shaver]]Found this razor gave a very close shave. One charge will give 10 days use which is better than most.</li>
    <li> Great shave, after using a blade for a longggg time I have now found an electric razor that works, face and manscape. Great product!</li>
    <li> Have been using this for over a year. Works like a charm, especially for sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I bought this originally in 2010 from Amazon. Amazon replaced the unit under warranty when the cleaning unit malfunction light came on despite replacing the cleaning cartridge. The replacement unit failed after six months and was replaced by Panasonic (3 year warranty). Since then it has been replaced two more times for the same fault issue. When asked about a possible design flaw for the unit (waiting now for the fourth replacement) under warranty, Panasonic now states that they have had some many returns they cannot keep up with the replacements. I have been waiting close to two months for the replacement. I asked if they could replace with a different unit model that does not have this problem and am awaiting this replacement. I recommend the razor (it is very good) but spare yourself of the cleaning station issue.</li>
    <li> This shaver is a very good product. I especially like how the head pivots as it moves and contours to my face. It had good blades and is easy to clean. It holds a charge for a long time and is light and easy to use. I would recommend this shave to anyone. I have a light beard and only shave a couple times a week. But I think it would work fine for any guy, regardless of how often they have to shave.</li>
    <li> 90 dao got it. song gei daddy as a liwu. ta hen like it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m smitten by this shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shaves so close.  I used to use Braun shavers before (circular type), but this is my first time using a foil type.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love the fact that it&#x27;s wet/dry and I can use it with my shaving foam.  Gives a super close shave with no irritation at all!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Battery life is great too!!</li>
    <li> Very happy with this purchase.. It arrived quickly from o/s and is a great razor..  Very close shave. My skin is not irritated as with rotor razors..</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s Okay. Have had others before, the price was very good, but could shave faster with the old razor. I will continue to use it, but when in a hurry, use the old razor.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my husband - upon his request. According to him, this works well dry or wet. Since the skin on our faces is sensitive, he finds using a bit of soap or lather when shaving doesn&#x27;t irritate his skin too much. The Panasonic shaver works well and he feels gives him a good shave.</li>
    <li> I use Panasonic ES8243A, but my brother bought this model and I tried it. Panasonic ES8243A is very good shaver, but LA63 is better. I recommended this shaver.</li>
    <li> easy to use. bought it on sale. husband disability so this electric razor much easier than razor blad. and he says a close enough shave. not as close as razor though. but light to handle. quite user friendly!!</li>
    <li> I purchased this mainly for shaving my head.....the decision was between this and a rotary version but had read that the latter created more irritation.  I wanted an electric shaver as I was experiencing razor bumps if I wanted to shaved my head every day using a gillette blade.  I must say that using it for a month, I have found that I could shave my head every day without having any bumps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Compared to the blade, I must admit that the LA63 is almost as close as the gillette but takes longer to get my head clean shaven. A full charge lets me shave a full week before having to recharge.  My recommendation is not to perform any shaving without some form of lubrication.... a pre-electric is great way to get a close shave without irritation.  Wet shaving works great but I can do that with a blade.</li>
    <li> clean shave, easy to clean, easy to charge.  A little to expensive but if last long time it would be worth it</li>
    <li> I used ES8228, the LCD screen will not display all numbers after more than a year&#x27;s use. This is the biggest problem of panasonic shaver. I hopt this new one solved this problem. Good luck!</li>
    <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Charges quickly&lt;br /&gt;Smells good (you read that right)&lt;br /&gt;Works I guess&lt;br /&gt;Less likely hood of ingrown hairs if you have sensitive skin and wiry hair&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Poor performance below jaw line and neck&lt;br /&gt;Can be used in water, advise against it (dirty, discoloration after one use, complex cleaning nooks and crannies)&lt;br /&gt;GETS HOTTER THAN A MOTHER****ER shortly after being turned on&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Arguably creates as much or more skin irritation (sliding hot foil across your face) as my safety razor does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I guess it&#x27;s good if you are strapped for time in the morning?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;badger brush, prorasso soap/aftershave, merkur classic, feather blades - is very time consuming&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You just cant win~</li>
    <li> Initially, it gave a smooth shave, but within a month Panasonic had to send me a replacement. After a while, the motor would emit an &amp;#34;up &amp; down whining sound&amp;#34; &amp; won&#x27;t cut properly.&lt;br /&gt;They eventually sent me a better 5 blade unit. Will see how that one holds up.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay for an electric razor. I&#x27;ve used it for a few weeks. It gives a decent shave, but to be honest I can get a closer and better shave with a little battery operated (uses two triple A batteries)razor called Microforce which I bought at Wal-Mart for $10.00. It even came with an extra foil. If I had it to do over, I wouldn&#x27;t have spent the money on the Panasonic ES-LA63-S. I would simply buy a replacement Microforce when it became necessary. For the cost of the Panasonic I could have bought fifteen of the Microforce razors.</li>
    <li> That&#x27;s a Shaver I just needed!</li>
    <li> Prior to purchasing the Panasonic ES-LA63-S, I used Gillette Fusion ProGlide in combination with &amp;#34;Nivea For Men&amp;#34; shaving foam. The Gillette blade delivered a perfect closeness and made my skin feel very soft. However, because my skin is quite sensitive, I sometimes got red spots and cuts on my face when conditions were not optimal. I could mitigate this problem by shaving under warm shower and applying the foam for a longer period beforehand, but this whole procedure took a lot of time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A decade ago I had owned an electric shaver from Panasonic, but the results didn&#x27;t come even close to a neatly executed blade shave. At some point I stopped using the electric shaver and relied on the blade only. Thirteen years later, as technology has made a substantial advancement, I reconsidered buying an electric shaver again and I expected it to perform better than my old one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I compared the technical details and reviews of some high-profile models, and the new Panasonic ES-LA63-S not only had very good ratings, but was sold at a price much lower ($150) than originally. So I thought to give it a chance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using it for two months, I can conclude that I made a right decision by buying the new Panasonic shaver. Here are some of my experiences that I want to share with any potential buyers:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;During the first weeks, shaving dry delivered better results than my old Panasonic shaver, but the difference between Gillette Fusion ProGlide was still significant. The new Panasonic model can be used in a dry and wet mode. I think this is a big plus, because I have found that using the shaver under the shower produces a noticeably closer shave than using it dry, especially when I apply the foam in small quantity. Another reviewer has noticed this as well. After two months of using this shaver on a regular basis, I can attest that the dry method works better than it did initially: The shave is closer and it takes less time to complete it. The manual states that the skin needs about a month to adapt to a new shaver. I was skeptical about this statement when I read it first, but now it seems that there is some truth behind it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The question of interest for anyone is: How does the electric shaver fare against Gillette Fusion ProGlide for me personally?&lt;br /&gt;I would say that when used wet with the shaving foam, the Panasonic comes as close as 95% to the blade. I consider this as a very good result. The 5% &amp;#34;deficit&amp;#34; is only going to be noticed after one day, when hair growth can be already noticed after using the electric shaver, whereas petting the skin after using Gillette ProGlide still feels quite soft. However, that advantage comes at the cost of higher risk of irritations and cuts, which so far I have never had with the Panasonic shaver. I gladly accept the lack of irritations over the nuance in difference between closeness. Using the shaver dry produces a result of 85% these days when expressed in above numbers, which is still very good to me considering the time savings. Since I have owned the Panasonic shaver, I have never used the blade for my facial hair any more - only for hard-to-reach body and neck hair. Again, Gillette Fusion ProGlide is still the champion in the closeness category, where the Panasonic shaver is just almost as good when used in wet mode. However, given the lack of problems with skin irritations and the time savings, I would say that the Panasonic shaver has proved to be a better option for me overall.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other advantage of the electric shaver is that it retains its closeness over a longer time period than regular blades (which need to be exchanged for new ones more frequently). Even though the electric shaver requires a higher initial investment than a blade shaver, I think that the expenses break even at a point when the electric shaver still performs well. Cleaning the electric shaver is not a problem at all: Just put some liquid soap on the blades, activate the motors and rinse it with water. This will keep the shaver clean and will make it a pleasure to smell. The other model that comes with a cleaning station is not really needed in this regard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other reviewers have already criticized the battery life on this razor. I can indeed concur with that because I have found that a full battery charge provides energy for just about five 6-minute sessions (this is how long it takes for me to get a neat shave). This is not a lot, but on the positive side, the time to fully charge up the battery is short, too (just about an hour).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is my comprehensive list of pros and cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;+  Can be used in both dry and wet mode.&lt;br /&gt;++ Closeness almost as good as with Gillette Fusion ProGlide when used wet.&lt;br /&gt;++ No skin irritations and cuts&lt;br /&gt;+  Easy to use and easy to clean&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-  Short battery life (but it charges fast).&lt;br /&gt;-  When fully charged, the display blinks until the plug is removed, which can be annoying (although not a big deal).&lt;br /&gt;-  The motor is a little noisy, but not nerve-wrecking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s it for now. I think this shaver has deserved five stars given the highly appreciated positives and the fair purchase price. Should anything be added to my experience, I will update this review.</li>
    <li> I have changed my rating to one star and would give it less if I could.  In six months I have had to replace the shaving head twice.  I shave daily with shaving cream and have not abused the shaver in any way yet the head foil develops a hole (and it grows) that makes it unusable.  I have replaced the heads with genuine Panasonic heads from Amazon, yet the company agent says I must buy them from Panasonic directly at a much higher cost plus shipping - a ridiculous request.  The shaver does a good job, but I certainly wouldn&#x27;t recommend it due to the lousy foil head.</li>
    <li> I first purchased the Norelco Rotary for around $150.00 and was completely disappointed with its performance. This Panasonic is excellent quality and does a great job. The best electric razor I have ever purchased.</li>
    <li> This razor is the best electric razor that I have owned.  It provides a comfortable, close shave (although the neck area is still a bit problematic) and is extremely easy to use.  Cleaning can be accomplished quickly and with minimal effort.  I much prefer the simple soap and water rinsing that this razor periodically requires as opposed to the docking station with its messy and expensive cleaning solution.  The flexible head follows the contours of my face well, and its large size reduces shaving time.  The symbols on the electronic display are easy to identify and understand and the controls are comfortably placed.  The price of the razor is rather expensive, but I feel that it is well worth it.</li>
    <li> Closest and quickest shaves I have ever experienced. I have always preferred Panasonic over all other brands of shavers, and was very happy with my previous model. After 7 years the battery finally wore out, so I needed a replacement. Read a lot of reviews of this and other models. The head appeared large and looked awkward, and a couple of reviews said it was difficult to get at \\&quot;small areas\\&quot;.. However, I have not found that to be a problem, and I am shaving more closely, smoothly and quickly than ever before. This is my 3rd Panasonic shaver.</li>
    <li> I tried wet and dry shaves. Wet is smoother.  The head of the shaver is to big. It is hard shaving under the nose by the upper lip. And I would not recommend for shaving heads. I cannot shave the back of my head with this shaver. also the shaver is pretty loud. But very easy to clean which is a big plus&lt;br /&gt;Overall is it a good shaver for face/neck only</li>
    <li> Probably a great item but felt betrayed when the &amp;#34;super saver price&amp;#34; came out 3 days later $25 less from the Panasonic. I had ordered it but returned it unopened.  I will shop more before buying one again. I hate pricing games.</li>
    <li> After about 10 years of using Panasonic ES725, I bought this one. It looks cool, works pretty well, and I believe it gives you very short shave. But I found from the first day that it would never be better than my old Panasonic ES725. I don&#x27;t know why both Braun and even Panasonic have not been able to beat a very old model. The old ES725 gave me super close shave. Gillette Mach 3 was worse. Of course ES725 was not perfect. It missed long hairs (I used the trimmer to make them shorter and then shaved again).    With ES725, I spent less than a minute for a very close shave without much irritation for everyday shaving. For closest shave (very smooth skin, I don&#x27;t feel any texture), I spent more time though it gave me slight irritation. With this new Panasonic, I get almost always some irritation for just decently close shave. To get the closest shave, I spend many minutes and significant irritation.    So, do I recommend other product like Braun? No. Braun never gives me close shave (surely, it depends on personal preference).    One more thing. I also found that shaving quality depends on some luck. The perfect match between a foil and blades is required for super close shave. If you change your foil, the quality would drop or be improved. But that&#x27;s something that you cannot control. It is just luck. So I want to believe that the current combination of my Panasonic is not perfect and I hope it will somehow settle down over time.    &#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;    Update: 12/26/10    After the review, I happened to try &#x27;wet&#x27; mode. I used Gillette shave gel and found the shaving was very very comfortable and refreshing. I had never enjoyed &#x27;wet&#x27; shaving with my old Panasonic, because it was not very good for it, though it was possible. Anyway, I&#x27;m very pleased with &#x27;wet&#x27; mode and I&#x27;ve been &#x27;wet&#x27; shaving ever since, though it still is not as close as my old one. Anyway, I increased my rate from 3 to 4 stars.</li>
    <li> This shaver cuts smoothly and is powerful. Time spent shaving was also reduced. I had no trouble shaving between my nose and upper lip. The head really snugs close to my face. One word of caution is to not spend too much time cutting in one place. You might get a slight burn on your face.</li>
    <li> Pros - very close shave (have only used it dry so far), rivals a blade. It takes a few passes but the end result is smooth. It has a little trouble with longer hairs that lay flat, but the built in trimmer is sufficient to take care of them, and then the shaver can deal with them. The trimmer is a little light for full blown hair trimming but will get the job done if you don&#x27;t bite off too much at once. Charges quickly, maintains the charge for a long time and is good for weeks of daily shaving before a recharge is needed. Display gives percent charge remaining, and after shaving it tells you how long you spent shaving. Cleaning it under a faucet is quick and easy. I would expect a buildup of debris after a while, but haven&#x27;t had it long enough for that to develop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons - No charging cradle, and the shaver won&#x27;t operate while it is plugged in. For the price I would expect a charging cradle. And since it won&#x27;t run while it is plugged in, when the batteries go bad, it will be useless. The readout is a bright blue backlit LED that flashes while it is charging. I mean it is BRIGHT. I fit didn&#x27;t flash it could easily double as a nightlight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I am pleased with my purchase and would probably buy one again.</li>
    <li> My boyfriend had been using disposable razors for 25+ years.  His most recent favorite was the [[ASIN:B000052YHS Gillette Mach3]]. I had always wanted to buy him an electric shaver as a gift, but I knew how he felt. So when I asked him to give the [[ASIN:B002N5MHLU Panasonic ES-LA63-S Arc IV Multi Flex Nanotech Rechargeable Shaver]] a test, I was met with resistance.  He said that over the years he had tried shavers like this and could never get a close shave, so he was happy with his disposable.  Of course he was willing to try for me, so I asked him to give it a full weeks use, both wet and dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first day he used it dry, as he was running late to work and needed to clean up as much as possible.  He wasn&#x27;t immediately impressed with the closeness of the shave, but he did like that there was no irritation and it was easy to clean. I felt his face, knowing how it usually feels after a shave and it was nice, but I had to agree that the disposable did get closer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The next morning he decided to try it wet, in the shower.  We have one of the no-fog mirrors, so it was easy enough for him to do and again clean up was a breeze.  This time he was surprised; using the shaver wet provided him an incredibly close shave. As good as a disposable, but quicker and less mess.  Was this going to be \\&quot;THE\\&quot; razor that would eliminate the favored disposable?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He continued to use it, long after I had asked of him and still uses it to this day.  Occasionally he does revert back to his disposable for vacation, but this shaver converted my non-believer. No longer can he say that it&#x27;s impossible to get a close shave from an electric shaver.  I highly recommend this for any man to buy for themselves or for someone wanting to give one as a gift.</li>
    <li> This is the best electric shaver I have ever used.I look forward to shaving with this in the morning.It&#x27;s really close to a blade shave. You won&#x27;t go wrong with this one.</li>
    <li> I have a heavy beard and have had problems with electric shavers. Few months back I purchased Bruan Wet/Dry shaver which was best shave up till that point. Under neck and chin area it still took about 6 to 8 passes to get smooth razor feel.&lt;br /&gt;I was shocked when I used the Panasonic Wet/Dry this is the closes shave ever with electric shaver for me(age 69). For the first time I am getting a razor close shave with an electric. Not very pretty to look at, head is big, but man does shaver do the job. Cleaning is also a breeze, just couple of drops of hand soap turn on razor till lathers then rinse, that&#x27;s it. Great job Panasonic. Would definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> I had a Panasonic electric shaver about a decade ago and then grew a burly beard for 10 years. That shaver was great, but back then electric shavers just didn&#x27;t cut as close as a razor. It was time for me to get rid of the Castaway beard, and so I purchased the Panasonic ES-LA63-S Arc 4 for daily or every-other-daily use. I read some reviews on Amazon and Slickdeals, and made my choice. I couldn&#x27;t be happier. It&#x27;s a fantastic shaver, and cuts as smooth as a razor. I guess the multiple blades and RPMs really makes the difference. It&#x27;s light and easy to handle, not incredibly noisy, and charges super fast. I&#x27;ve mainly been using it dry without any issues. The little flip up trimmer is very handy and works great as well.</li>
    <li> it is a wonderful razor, quick cleaning, quiet and feel comfortable after shaving.&lt;br /&gt;i hope the battery can last long enough</li>
    <li> Shipped quickly. Packed well. Just as described.</li>
    <li> This Panasonic razor is the best electric razor I have owned. Having started with electrics, moving back to disposable multi-blade razors, and then mixing the two, the Panasonic is the best electric razor and gives an identical shave as a fresh multi-blade disposable razor shave. Except, you don&#x27;t have to throw this beauty away every 3-5 days, just recharge it. I use it in the shower every day and have not been disappointed in its shaving capability. A plus, no razor burn or ingrown hairs either. The pivot head is a masterpiece of design. There are more expensive electic razors. I doubt they compair in shaving performance as the Panasonic ES-LA63-S.</li>
    <li> My shavers have been electric since about 1970. Most have been Panasonic but I have used Braun among others. I keep coming back to Panasonic. This LA63 is the best so far. Most lose sharpness within 6 months, so I will wait and see if this shaver does better.The shave is quicker than those in the past and I have a box full of working shavers that take 9 to 10 minutes to get a close shave.</li>
    <li> Just as good as a blade</li>
    <li> Great electric shaver to shave your head. Shaves almost as close as a blade on your face. But if you are bald and shave your dome a wet shave with this is the way to go.</li>
    <li> Bought this based on reviews here on Amazon.  Love it.  I just had the quietest, smoothest electric shave I&#x27;ve ever had.  My skin isn&#x27;t the most easily irritated, but I had zero skin irritation, even when used completely dry.  I need neither shaving lotion nor aftershave with this... just hit the button and go.</li>
    <li> Got this when my old Norelco died. Gives me the closest electric shave (and in competition with the best blade shave too) I&#x27;ve had. I just need to take my time with it, not run it all over my face like a racecar, but slowly let it do it&#x27;s job and turn it different directions occasionally, especially on my neck. I can do it fast and still look presentable, but I need to slow down for the closest shave. Also, I shave dry. Love the under-faucet cleaning too. The plastic around the blade assembly feels a little fragile but great razor so far!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been around a while and used my fair share of electric razors. I thought the red welts on the neck and sore face went with the territory. But after using the panasonic those issues are history. The shave is amazingly close, I bought a new mid priced electric razor about four years ago but the panasonic has been huge leap in technology. Sometimes it&#x27;s worth paying a bit extra for quality.</li>
    <li> I got this razor from Amazon about 2 weeks back. Used it 2 times and was not satisfied with it. First time i tried a dry shave. Even after 4 or 5 times going over the same area on my face, there were still some facial hair remaining. The neck area was especially bad. Second time i tried a wet shave thinking that may do a better job. It was equally bad. Both times the shaver cut the skin above my upper lip. I was not satisfied with the razor and is returning the product.</li>
    <li> Got this for Xmas to replace another ancient Panasonic shaver. Loved the old one, but love this one even more. Close, clean shave with no nicks or irration. Quite, easy to clean and easy to charge. Would purchase again and highly reommend.</li>
    <li> I had used Norelco electric shavers for many years, and they typically would last 2-4 years before failing in some way. The Panasonic ES-LA63-S had received several good reviews, and while it was a bit more expensive than what I had purchased previously I thought I would give it a try - hoping for something that would last a bit longer. The shaver seemed well-built and substantial, and has a nice display giving charge status and time spent shaving. It seemed to me to be less comfortable than the Norelco, but not bad. The biggest disappointment came when after about 6 months of use, the display on the screen started to malfunction and show incorrect values. Then the battery started to weaken and only held a charge for a few shaves before requiring recharging. This week, after just over 10 months of daily use, the unit died completely. It is still in warranty, so I expect to receive a replacement for the out-of-pocket costs of paying to send the shaver to the service center. I ordered a new Norelco to use while the Panasonic is being serviced. I doubt I&#x27;ll buy another Panasonic shaver.</li>
    <li> Overall it&#x27;s good but still requires several passes to get a smooth shave and this is not low cost for a shaver that isn&#x27;t great - plus sometimes the display shows logo&#x27;s and notices that can&#x27;t be found in the manual - confusing.</li>
    <li> The shaver works very well, but the trimmer is no good.</li>
    <li> The best shave ever. This shaver leaves a very clean, effortless, and quick shave. I was using a popular razor cartridges brand for years, but since I shave every single day, at the end of the week my skin was very sore and always needed a couple of days to heal. With this shaver that problem is gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do wet shave using oil, this completely changed my life. The shave is as good as razor blade with near-zero skin irritation. At the beginning I tried dry and wet shave using shaving cream (both foam and gel), I obtained good results with those methods, but I found a bit of irritation after a few days of shaving in a row.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shaving oil eliminated all irritation, I just rinse my face with water, apply 4 drops of oil and I’m ready for a great shave every day. I also purchased the oil in Amazon, you can find it by the name “Shave Secret Shaving Oil”.</li>
    <li> I never write reviews, but this will be my act of charity for the week.  Yes!!  This shaver is great.  I have looked for at least 8 years for a shaver that would not irritate my upper lip and neck.  I have tried the best of braun, 3d, cheep electric razors, wet shave with a straight razor, shower shave with cheep razors, the best Gillette offers, and wet shave of course.  I can honestly say that for me, wet shave is always necessary and not something that just feels good.  If I don&#x27;t my upper lip and other areas will become so irritated I will not feel like a human being the rest of the week.  (because the irritation is so bad, I&#x27;ll think about it and be self concious). So let&#x27;s just say in simple terms....  With this shaver you can shave in the shower (a must anyway for me). With some olive oil and then aveeno therapeutic shave gel every day!!  No irritation unless you push to hard or go over sensitive areas too many times.  But I&#x27;m telling you with other shavers it was IMPossible to shave daily and I was concerned as I begin work with the air force in three months.  Now I shave daily!!  No irritation.  I now feel more confident, look more professional and honestly...  I now have a girlfriend that I really like.  This can be attributed to this shaver that can help a man feel comfortable in his skin.  So again,  this shaver is no joke!  I know it&#x27;s a pain in the a** to find true reviews and shavers that actually work for you.  I promise you this review is true and written from a real customer who is taking a crap right now and writing this.  Hahs.  Good luck on your purchase</li>
    <li> does the job but not that comfortable</li>
    <li> This is the best shaver I got so far.&lt;br /&gt;I use to use Narolco Shaver and did not know until I got this shaver that electric shaver can be this good.  With wet shave the shave is good as a razor shave if you take your time.&lt;br /&gt;Overall the shaver has proven it self and would buy it again. I hope the battery last a long time everything else is fixable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Barry</li>
    <li> I have a prior Arc4 (Panasonic ES8243A) for about 4 years.  Worked great but the trimmer stopped trimming.  Don&#x27;t really use the trimmer much but I saw it as a sign to replace the machine.  The old model is a great shaver but never did well under my chin.  I would normally shave that area with a Mach 3 razon and the rest of my face with the electric (more gentle on the face).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do not grow a heavy beard but I don&#x27;t shave over the weekend.  As such, I have a 2 or 3 mi limiters of facial hair by Monday morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This new shaver does a much better job on the Monday morning shave than the prior model.  However, both leave a few stragglers.  Thus, for Monday morning, I still use the Mach 3.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, all other days, and even under the chin, this NEW shaver does an AMAZING job.  Cleanest, quickest, smoothest, shave.  I usually (almost always) use shaving soap but the machine also works well even on a dry face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are in the market for an electric ... this is my recommendation.  BTW .. prior model is still shaving well ... but I&#x27;m degrading it to my travel model (taking it to the office for that once-a-year occasion).</li>
    <li> Always used Braun (serie3 and 5) shavers and was a little scared to swap it for a Panasonic. Should have done it already years ago, the shaving is better than Braun 3/5 series and battery holds up longer too. Couldn&#x27;t be more pleased.</li>
    <li> I have had several Panasonic wet/dry shavers, including the 7163, 7101 and 7243 and was pleased with each.  I have also tried a Norelco rotary shaver.  The LA-63 beats them all.  It is quieter and closer.  It delivers by far the best shave I have ever had with an electric.  I shave in the shower and it does a great job in less time than the other shavers I have tried.  I would highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I have been shaving for 31 years with razors and this one, FINALLY, gives me a smooth face - as if I had just used a blade! AND it&#x27;s LOW MAINTENANCE! There&#x27;s no cleaning fluids to refill every other month. It&#x27;s just the BEST SHAVER I&#x27;ve ever owned. Even my wife said &#x27;Oooooooooooooo&#x27; when she felt my face. :-)   Felt like a baby&#x27;s bottom! AMAZING! I recently bought a $150 Braun 550CC and expected (because of the price that this would be a good shaver. It was as dull as my 6-year-old Norelco. I took it right back and bought this Panasonic. AMAZINGLY SMOOTH SKIN after shaving with it the FIRST TIME. I DIDN&#x27;T THINK IT WAS POSSIBLE!! AND YOU CAN SHAVE IN THE SHOWER WITH IT TOO!! THANKS PANASONIC! YOU DID IT! You made the PERFECT razor!</li>
    <li> This shaver has made a believer out of a life long blade shaver. I have used several electric shavers throughout the years and have always been disappointed with the results.  I decided to take a chance on this shaver and am amazed at the results.  I will be mothballing my manual shaver and using this item exclusively.  It really performs better than razor for my face. No more cuts,pulling and face irritation from blade.  I use this in the shower with a little shaving cream.  Thanks panasonic for this product.</li>
    <li> Have never liked elec. razor&#x27;s but read the revievs and gave this one a try,I hated it the first time as it burned my neck,and the shave was still inconsistent.but gave it the 30 day try panasonic recomends and it is true you must learn to drive this Razor and in fact with cream and a wet nap it does give the smoothest shave .I love this razor , it is easy to clean,the display is easy to read and see when a charge is needed,the charge lasts me about 6 shaves,my 30 days will be up tomorrow and I am going to order one for each of my sons,that is my highest recomendadion.</li>
    <li> I have used a Braun electric shaver for many years and always felt that it was the top performing shaver on the market.  Then I was told about the Panasonic range and how good they are. After much thought I purchased the Panasonic ES-LA63-S rechargeable shaver being only second to the premium shaver in the Panasonic range. It is a remarkable shaver. It not only shaves faster and closer than the Braun but it is so easy to clean just by putting the foil and cutters under a running tap. The last Braun I had took 10 minutes to give me a close shave.  The Panasonic has halved that time and it took only two weeks for my 60 year old tough beard to completely adapt to it. The Panasonic runs much faster than the Braun and has an ability to give an amazingly close shave without causing any rash or discomfort. Once again no-one on the internet or in local retail stores could come close to the great price offered at the time of purchase by Amazon.com.</li>
    <li> I bought this shaver as a result of positive Whirlpool (AU) reviews.      it provides a very close shave dry-shaving, and is also very enjoyable used wet-shaving.    It holds charge well and is an excellent shaver.    Full points to Amazon for a speedily delivered item, well protected in the post.    CJR</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used Norelco shavers in the past.  They never really works great, always left something.  It was like a pre-shave in the shower which made the manual shaving with my Mach3 easier.  I&#x27;d heard about the foil Brauns and Panasonics, but never ended up getting one.  It&#x27;s a much closer shave than my Norelco could ever give.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then, this one was on sale with rebate for a great price.  I&#x27;ll never get another Norelco and will probably stick with what works, Panasonic.  It pretty much gets all my face hair, but isn&#x27;t as awesome at getting everything on my neck, guess that is what the manual razor is for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Updated! - The LCD on my shaver went bad.  I looked and there is a two year warranty and I&#x27;ve only had it around 1.5 years.  I sent it in for $10 shipped vis USPS, about 10 days later I received my replacement.  It was a brand new Panasonic ES-LA93-K, so they upgraded me!  Well, it appears the upgrade is only the base station, but better than nothing and now I have a brand new shaver!  I can use the base to give it an extra clean every month.  I like the black much better too.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this about 3 times a week for the past few months. Was hoping that the growth of my hair would have adapted to them by now. However, it seems that I have to spend about 2-3 minutes (shows on the counter) and a go over a few times before I catch all the hairs. The most problematic region is just under the chin and near the neck.     Overall, the shaves are very nice and close. Feels just as smooth as using a razor (I use the Gillette Power Fusion Razor) but was hoping to cut down time shaving with the electronic one which hasn&#x27;t happened.</li>
    <li> Good razor if you only plan to chave your face.  It doesn&#x27;t do the best job on the neck.  I&#x27;ve tried wet, dry, with/without shave cream and each time my neck is torn up and gets really irritated and I get major razor burn.  Back to a regular razor for me.</li>
    <li> just make sure you shave over the sink</li>
    <li> Works well.  I highly recommend liner drive speed controlled electric shavers.  The Power available display feature is very convenient. Don&#x27;t know how important the pivoting head is.  It seems fine.</li>
    <li> This is the perfect shaver. Upgraded from a Braun series 5 and this is vastly better. Only drawback is that you cannot use the razor when it&#x27;s charging.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve hated shaving for ten years, especially the neck area. A few weeks ago a coworker suggested I try a panasonic. I searched a little and found this one, with many positive reviews so I went with it. I could not be happier with it - I get a shave as close and smooth as with a blade, but without the irritation, cutting, and time. Highly reccomended.</li>
    <li> I love the razor because it gives a comfortable &amp; close shave with out irritation wet or dry.I have tried electric razors in the past but i never was satisfied with them. I feel that now i have a electric razor that i will stick with.</li>
    <li> Bought this shaver Oct. 2013 to replace my Braun. The digital readout  on this shaver went out. Was in the shower shaving when the shaver died, didn&#x27;t know the battery was just about dead because there was no digital read out to indicate this. Also my old Braun gave me a better shave ,but I liked the Panasonic for it&#x27;s ability to use in the shower.</li>
    <li> The best electric shaver yet!</li>
    <li> As usual, Panasonic makes great electric razors and this is no exception.  I will buy no other razor than Panasonic and this is well worth the money.</li>
    <li> I liked this shaver, and I feel like its a quality product but I have to say that after 2 years of using it I decided to switch back to braun instead of replacing the blades on this again (replacing blades happens to all electric shavers, this was no different).</li>
    <li> The best razor I ever owned. I have a Norelco and a Braun, and the Panasonic far surpasses them. The only reason it does not warrant the fifth star is that it does not come with a stand. ..... But, you will love the shave.</li>
    <li> This is hands down the best electric razor I have ever owned.  I have been using different brands of cheaper razors and they worked so so.  It took a long time to shave and really had to work to get a close (dry) shave.  Not anymore, this gives me a very close shave in under 2 minutes. Very satisfied with the Panasonic.</li>
    <li> This razor is nothing like the old school razors. I used to use a blade, and if you didn&#x27;t shave every day it took all kinds of time to do the job. With this razor it doesn&#x27;t matter, long or short beards.Cleaning is easy, just rinse in water. I can also get two weeks of shaving on one charge! Love it!  &#x27;&#x27;</li>
    <li> Works great for front and sides but has a real problem cutting the neckline</li>
    <li> Works great wet or dry.  I would have gotten the version with the stand charger if I realized it was not compatible with my old charger.</li>
    <li> This is very nice. I like it very much.</li>
    <li> I bought this mistakingly at a retail shop, thinking that its better than the Braun series 7 Pulsonic and discovered that its no better than my Braun series 7 older model fitted with the newer Brain series 70s optifoil for the past one year. The braun foils is better designed, longer lasting and stays sharper longer    for braun series 7 older model users, u just need to upgrade yr foil to the newer optifoil. WHile its true this panasonic shaves better than the older Braun series 7 with pulsonic smartfoil, it isnt any better than the new Braun series 7 optifoil.    And also consider this fact the Braun optifoil model was released in 2010, compared to this panasonic which is 1 year before.I amnot sure if panasonic has over the year made improvements on their foil quality but Braun sure did.      Initial impressions after my first shave with the new Opti-foil on the  older Pulsonic 790cc.    There is no question in my mind but that the newer designed Braun foil is a dramatic improvement over the older design. The shave, which lasted between 5 and 6 minutes was one of the closest dry shaves from an electric that I have ever received and even better than the older smartfoil braun. The neck area shaves better than the panasonic.and besides the panasonic tends to lose its sharpness after a while.  I was particularly impressed that it easily cut all of the more difficult to shave areas (jawline and neck). There was no irritation after the shave was completed and four hours later my face is still completely smooth.    I would rank this shave as equal to the wet shave with the Panasonic Esla 63S \\&quot;without\\&quot; the mess and cleanup.     Given the fact that Braun did not announce any speed change in their newer shavers, I can only assume that the \\&quot;intensive\\&quot; setting is identical to the \\&quot;only\\&quot; setting on the older shavers. And since Braun recommends that the newer shavers be used on the intensive setting for the best shave, I see no advantage to purchasing a newer Pulsonic or Panasonic esla63S    And besides that, the Braun foil is smaller in size and is easier to cut because of its small head compared to panasonic.    Put aside all the technical jargon, utimately its the foil which matters most</li>
    <li> This Panasonic razor is way over priced and over hyped.  I wish I had saved the money and got another Norelco.  The Norelco pop-up trimmer is so much better.  The Panasonic is very loud and you cannot watch TV without turning up the volume.  This razor shaves a little bit closer but not enough for the high price tag.  It is very bulky and hard to shave close around the lips and nose area.</li>
    <li> I had it for a year. Great shaver but just stopped working today.</li>
    <li> Happy with length of charge, but does not shave as close as Norelco unless really pressed against skin...do not recommend for the price.</li>
    <li> This is my second Panasonic shaver and I liked the earlier model better. The reason is that it picked up longer hairs better than this one.  With this one, I have to stretch my skin to get the longer hairs while the earlier model had some sort of hair catcher that just lifted them up.  The only other issue is that the trimmer is difficult to open. Other than these two issues, the razor holds a charge for up to two weeks, is easy to use, and does not irritate my skin.  I would purchase it again.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent razor.  It cuts close without chafing and works quietly and quickly.  As far as I know, it&#x27;s the best shaver on the market.</li>
    <li> I ordered this razor yesterday, and it arrived this morning.  Super fast two day service.  I have tried many razors from cheap Gillette double edge blades, expensive Merkur double edge, Shick, Norelco, Braun electrics.  And being the adventurous type, I thought I&#x27;d add this razor to my many shaving experiments.  It arrived about 10am with a 10% charge.  I plugged it in and left the house.  I returned just before 12 noon, and the razor was completely charged.  I hadn&#x27;t shaved yet, so I took it to the bathroom, loaded my face with coconut oil and shaved with my new razor.  It makes an odd noise, but it&#x27;s not loud nor disturbing.  It&#x27;s a little more weight than I&#x27;m used to when I shave so that was noticeable.  The shave took 4 minutes and 10 seconds according to the razor, and it was as good a shave as I&#x27;ve had with blades.  No irritation to speak of.  The head is a lot more bulky than my little manual razor, so that will take some getting used to.  I&#x27;m also not used to having to stretch the skin tight ahead of the razor.  But these are minor things.  After the shave, I put a little hand soap into the grill on the razor, ran it to make a foam, then rinsed it in warm water.  Then I opened it up and it was clean inside.  So.  The razor is heavy, but not too bad.  The head is large, but it moves all over, so it works well.  The noise is not bad either, and the shave was very good for my first time.  I expect I will get better with experience.  All in all, this razor was well worth the price.  I compared it with the other brands before deciding on Panasonic, and then I compared this model with the others.  There are others that perhaps will do as well, but for the price, this one came out on top for me.</li>
    <li> Expensive for an electric shave that doesn&#x27;t shave that close. it&#x27;s not that bad but you cannot replace it with a razer</li>
    <li> Great price on this and it&#x27;s perfect for the price.  Does a great job shaving and feels great in the shower.  Would recommend to others - get them while they last.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Panasonic shavers for nearly 20 years and have used numerous variations on their wet-dry shavers. This is the second one of this model I&#x27;ve had (ES-63). I don&#x27;t believe it is possible to get a closer shave than when this is used wet. I get such a close shave with this  shaver in the morning that I don&#x27;t have 5 o&#x27;clock shadow. I&#x27;ve tried several other brands of shavers including Remington, Norelco, and Braun shavers (several of each) but I keep coming back to the Panasonic. I&#x27;ve also tried several models of Panasonic shavers from inexpensive ones in the $50 range up through their top of the line $400 ones. The ES-63 seems to give me a great shave in about 3 minutes and works as well as the most expensive ones. The blades and screen have lasted about 8 months before needing replacement. The one I got two years ago had the computer screen go out after about 6 months, but it just tells you how long your shave was and how much charge is left, and it has never been an issue for me not being able to see it, although I prefer having it work. (I probably should have returned it under warranty, but I didn&#x27;t). Oh, I also have tried a few multi-blade manual razors but found the Panasonic electric was as good or better than any and a lot easier to use. You don&#x27;t need special shaving soap. I wet my face using a regular bar of soap. When done shaving I just rinse the shaver under the tap for a few seconds. I don&#x27;t like having to shave, but the Panasonic makes it a quick and easy process.</li>
    <li> I have been using this razor for about a week and simply love it! It shaves close. I charged the battery once as it went down a slight bit. Don&#x27;t waste your money on the Square Trade warranty, as the razor comes with a two year warranty and Square Trade simply duplicates it. The Square Trade warranty begins the day you buy the razor.</li>
    <li> The best shave from an electric shaver. Reliable as this is my fourth Panasonic Shawer in 12 years. Each one is better than the one it replaced.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s already more than two years gone, since I bought this shaver and it works as brand new, no scratches, battery - same power, blades - same sharpening.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this shaver!</li>
    <li> wonderful razor. best electric razor I have ever used&lt;br /&gt; easy to clean. Expensive but its sure worth the money</li>
    <li> It is not very often that I buy something that is just incredible. This shaver is totally incredible.    I have used nothing but Norelcos my entire shaving life (25+ years). Some were better than others. And then I bought an Arcitec. Biggest piece of crap I&#x27;ve ever owned in my life. I was so disgusted with Norelco for ripping me off with that $200 piece of junk that I bought this razor. Norelco has never made anything even close to this Panasonic.    Everything about this thing is so well designed and thought out that I am still amazed every morning while I&#x27;m shaving. Even after using it for nearly two months now.    It does have a pretty big head, although not as big as I expected after reading the reviews. You can allow the head to move and float with the curves of your face and neck or you can lock it and angle it yourself.    This is by FAR the best and closest cutting razor I&#x27;ve ever used. After nearly two months, it has yet to ever miss a single hair anywhere on my face or neck. It does take a couple passes and you need to hold your skin tight, but that is the same with all electrics. It takes me between 2-3 minutes to completely shave.    As a test, I went an entire weekend without shaving just to see how this thing would handle a good bunch of growth. No tugging or pulling like I&#x27;ve always gotten with rotary style Norelcos. Just completely smooth skin on both my face and neck. And it only added an extra minute to the shaving time. By the way the razor tells you how long you spent shaving each time in minutes and seconds, I don&#x27;t own a stop watch.    I tried a wet shave with it once. It was nice and probably more comfortable than dry, but it reminded me of why I&#x27;ve always used electrics. Very messy in my opinion.    The razor did actually irritate my skin for the first week or so. Not real bad but rubbing my hand across my face and neck would give me a prickly kind of feel under my skin. It did stop and now there is no irritation at all. I am left with only amazingly smooth and fast shaves.    Cleaning this thing is totally effortless. You pop the top off, put a few drops of hand soap on the blades and turn it on turbo mode. After a few seconds of it foaming up, you simply rinse it under running water and it is spotless. It is so easy that I do it every time I use the razor. After nearly two months it is just as clean as the day it was new. I&#x27;m so glad I did not spring for the extra $100 to get the cleaning station.    The battery charge lasts a long time. I get about three weeks of everyday shaves out of a single charge. The LED display is great because it tells you how much more battery power you have left. It is also the only battery razor I&#x27;ve ever had that the motor does not slow down as the battery goes down. It runs the same speed all the way down to when it tells you it is time to recharge.    About the only thing that could make this a better razor would be if you could run it with the power cord if the battery ever went dead. It is battery power only.    So if you are looking for the most amazing electric razor ever invented, I think I can safely say, you have just found it. How good is it? I give it TEN stars!!!</li>
    <li> Background:  Been shaving with blades for many years, but the cost of my preferred blades has increased over time to the point I started to look around for alternatives.    Last year I spent roughly 140 on blades.  Looking at the cost of an electric it seems that I would save some money (although not a lot) over a two year period including one replacement head.  Time will tell.    So, on to my thoughts about the LA63-S Arc IV:      The Good:  Shaves much faster than my traditional blades.    Fairly close shave when compared to my memory of using a rotary style shaver 15 years ago.    Battery lasts about 10 days for me, better than I expected.    Like the shave time duration feature - but likely because I love measuring things.    Can shave wet or dry - I seem to get a slightly closer shave when dry - but the wet shave is more comfortable to my skin.      The Weak:  Not as close as a blade.  The LA63 shave lasts about 14 hours, then stubble becomes noticeable.  I suspect this is typical of the electric shaver class - perhaps a bit better.    Head does not glide easily over my face - I have to concentrate to not press too hard or it will burn.        The Ugly:  Nothing really - at least not in the first month of use.      Additional thoughts:  Usage technique may matter a lot - and as I am new to foil shavers I might not be doing it \\&quot;right.\\&quot;  But so far the most effective technique (for me) is to use gentle small circling motions on the difficult area&#x27;s of the face:  under the nose, across the chin and jaw bones and around the adams apple -- rather than long sweeps across the face.  And less pressure is better - press too hard and you not only fail to get as close as you want, you might \\&quot;burn\\&quot; your skin.</li>
    <li> Panasonic shavers are great and good value for money. Doesn&#x27;t shave a couple of hard spots on the neck but they are hard with a razor as well. I would recommend this product for ease of use, very quick to clean, good battery and a good shave.</li>
    <li> I found the three top of the line electric shavers - Braun Series 7, Panasonic es-la63, and Phillips Norelco 3D -  to be so similar as to recommend any of them as excellent shavers, but each has its strengths and weaknesses. Too many reviewers are only comparing the closeness of the shave, but that&#x27;s only one factor of several that may be most important. Here&#x27;s my breakdown:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Closeness - Let&#x27;s start with the most popular category. If all you care about is how close you can shave, then I rate the wet-shaved Panasonic and Norelco even, BUT ONLY when coupled with a shaving oil/gel combo such as [[ASIN:B005ACNPLO Remington Alphagel Sensitive Shave Gel 5 oz. (Pack of 2)]] (there&#x27;s a cooling menthol version as well). Another way to accomplish the same thing is by using [[ASIN:B0023XF60Q SHAVE SECRET SHAVING OIL- THE BEST SHAVE EVER! 18.75ML]] topped with [[ASIN:B0032ANCUU Edge Shave Gel, Senstive Skin, 7-Ounces Cans (Pack of 6)]]. These provide the closest shave possible, but, of course, it&#x27;s messy, takes a lot of extra time, and can be a general pain. There&#x27;s no advantage in closeness to using non-oil shaving cream by itself.  Going dry-shave, I may give the tiniest of edges to Panasonic over Braun and Norelco, but all three are awfully close  - to each other and in quality of shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Speed - If you&#x27;re in a hurry and want to get in and get out with a dry-shave as quickly as possible, the Norelco wins. The Panasonic is next followed by the Braun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Comfort - I don&#x27;t have sensitive skin, but the Braun wins out (unless going wet-shave with the oil/gel as described above). The Braun has three speeds so you can go slower for sensitive areas and intensive on less-sensitive places. I just leave it set on intensive all the time and have no problem. The Panasonic is next followed by the Norelco third. The wet-shaving Panasonic and Norelco are the most comfortable of all if you want to put up with the oil/gel prep and clean-up time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cleaning - Any auto cleaning system is easier than manual cleaning. Just pop in the shaver and press a button. That said, the Braun is the only system with alcohol in its cleaner to sanitize as well as a detergent to clean and oil to lubricate. Norelco&#x27;s apparently has detergent and lubrication. From what I&#x27;ve been able to tell, the Panasonic solution is only a detergent. Manually, the Norelco is easiest to clean and you can duplicate the auto clean by pouring some of its [[ASIN:B002DHVAZW Philips Norelco HQ200 Jet Clean Solution]] in a dish or mug and whirring the shaver in it for 30 seconds after shaving. The Panasonic and Braun can be rinsed off under a faucet. The Panasonic&#x27;s special cleaning speed makes it slightly easier to manually clean than the Braun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maneuverability - If you have a moustache, goatee, beard, long sideburns, or whatever this is a very important category. The Braun is king here with the Norelco second and the larger-head Panasonic last.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Noise - You can hardly hear the Norelco at all. The Braun is a little buzzy and the Panasonic loudest although not irritatingly so. Still, a sleeping spouse nearby will appreciate you using the Norelco most.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Travel - The Norelco is last in this category because you&#x27;ll need to bring the charging stand with you. The Norelco soft case does not hold the stand so that&#x27;s a bit of a drawback. The Braun&#x27;s harder case gives it top honors over the Panasonic&#x27;s soft one, but the Panasonic has an on-off lock that the Braun lacks. Perhaps the Braun doesn&#x27;t need it because the case is harder, and also because the Braun is the only shaver that can run while plugged in with a depleted battery. The other two require a 5-minute charge to give you a few minutes shave. A fully-charged shaver gives you about 50 minutes in each.asier than manual cleaning.

    <li> This is an excellent razor, however Panasonic&#x27;s customer service is awful.  Hence my One Star rating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two weeks before my 2-year warranty was up my razor stopped working.  I called Panasonic, they found my order, and stated that it was under warranty and to send it in for repair or replacment.  Which I did.  Along with my Amazon receipt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seven (7) weeks later it is returned to me with a paper stating &amp;#34;Out of Warranty&amp;#34;, listing an incorrect purchase date.  7 Weeks to get back to me, and they did not do a darn thing.  What a huge waste of my time, I will never buy another Panasonic product again if this is how they treat their customers.</li>
    <li> I have been using Electric Razors for over fifty years and without a doubt this ES-LA63 is the best I have ever owned. I have not tried it wet, but the dry shave is extremely comfortable, no pulling of hairs, and the least number of passes over any part of the face to get a great shave.  The unit is very well manufactured and finished, it is quiet in use, light weight and easy to hold while shaving.  Highly recomended, and the Amazon price is as good as it gets, I&#x27;ve seen it priced at $400 in a fancy catalog.</li>
    <li> ES-LA63 is by far the best electric shaver I ever had and I tried quite a few of them including rotary Norelco&#x27;s and couple Panasonics. For the first time in my life I&#x27;m able to get a COMPLETELY clean shave on the neck with just 1-2 passes.  Highly recommended!!!</li>
    <li> I owned three panasonic shavers. All has big problems, I will never buy panasonic shaver again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;LA63------------LCD display messed after about two years. I didn&#x27;t use at wet state, so if you use at wet state, I think the LCD will stop working just after 1 year warranty.&lt;br /&gt;ES8228-------------LCD fade&lt;br /&gt;Other one----------------Ni-Mh Battery only keep very small electricity</li>
    <li> In this case, this razor is beyond what I knew was possible from an electric shaver. I have (had?) a Phillips electric shaver, and although it worked, it took forever to actually get every hair; I&#x27;d miss a bunch on my neck - always having to use a standard razor blade to clean up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Panasonic is amazing - quick and it easy, it glides along my face/neck and it doesn&#x27;t take 10 times to get everything. I remember powering this thing on for the first time, (and this was with 1% battery life mind you) the power this thing emits is crazy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was worth every penny paid, and I&#x27;d gladly buy another of this kind - don&#x27;t waste your money on cheap, circle-style electric shavers, buy this model, or one from the line-up of comparable Panasonic models - you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> This shaver gives me a close shave even when used dry. With little pressure and few passes, I get close to blade smoothness. I have a beard so the areas I trim often go days or more without trimming. Many electric razors fail when the hairs get that length and they merely flatten the hairs and glide over them. This one isn&#x27;t perfect but it&#x27;s much better than others I&#x27;ve used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pop up trimmer is nice, but its location limits its use. It&#x27;s fine for trimming burnsides, but it&#x27;s not in a good location for getting some stray hairs on the neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other problem I have is that battery life isn&#x27;t great. It drops about 10% with a use, and since I have a beard, that&#x27;s far less of a use than for many.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I get a close shave, and as long as I charge it regularly that&#x27;s about it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m glad I sprang for an expensive electric replacement for my low-end Braun - all the expensive extras on a high-end electric are not gimmics - it really is nice to have a lot of horsepower - a big head - a percentage battery left meter - a \\&quot;time-to-clean\\&quot; indicator. I used to dislike having to brush the trimmings out my my old razor after each shave - now when the \\&quot;wash\\&quot; indicator comes on I clean the thing under running water with liquid hand soap and it&#x27;s shiny new. I read in an article that men actually hate shaving (it&#x27;s not just me!) and anything that makes it better is worth the extra cost. Best of all, by buying from Amazon the razor wasn&#x27;t even that expensive compared to typical retail prices elsewhere.</li>
    <li> I have not used it very long but it seems to be OK.  Some minor problems are a few tugs on whiskers when using and the razor heats up a little when using for more than a minute.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Norelco shavers for about 23 years.  A few years ago, I tried the then latest Panasonic and didn&#x27;t like it.  I recently decided to try again and bought this shaver.    It is without a doubt the best electric shaver that I&#x27;ve ever owned.  The Norelco&#x27;s have always caused a little bit of skin irritation and often missed hairs, requiring me to go over an area again and again until it turned red.  This shaver causes NO skin irritation.  It also provides a much closer shave than the Norelco.  It does take slightly longer to complete a shave (about 5-6 minutes), but that&#x27;s only because I shave until my face is baby smooth (a feeling that my Norelco never gave me).    This is, hands down, the best shaver I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
    <li> I shave my head and face and this shaver is four times faster and significantly more comfortable than my old Braun.  Go for it.</li>
    <li> My prior razor was a Panasonic model 8249.  I&#x27;d give it 5 stars.  I purchased it a few years ago when Costco stopped carrying the razor blade I had been using, the Gilette 2-blade Sensor Excel.  When Costco stopped carrying the 2-blade Gillette, I was faced with the choice of buying much-more-expensive 3-blade+ razors or going to an electric razor.  I chose the electric route.  I then chose the Panasonic 8249, mainly because it could be used in the shower.    I was very pleased with the 8249. It shaved about as well as the Gillette blades, close and smooth.  After a few years, I needed to replace the foil and blades of the 8249.  I saw that this new model, the LA-63, cost not much more than the replacement foil and blade.  Since the price was not much different, instead of replacing the foil and blade on my 8249, I figured I&#x27;d \\&quot;upgrade\\&quot; and ordered the LA-63.    The LA-63 is a nice shaver but there is more drag than with the previous, 8249, shaver.  By drag, I mean that the shaver does not glide smoothly across the face.  I suspect that the extra drag is because the shaving area, the part the touches the skin, is larger than that of the 8249. I have no problem with the new shaver and it does seem to shave a bit closer.  Nevertheless, I believe the 8249 is better because it has less drag.  I shave in the shower and can reduce the extra drag by using more water to lubricate my face. Still, even with extra wetness, the shave is not as smooth as with the 8249.    Would I buy the LA-63 again?  Yes, without hesitation but if the 8249 were available, I&#x27;d buy it.  To me, the slightly closer shave of the LA-63 doesn&#x27;t compensate for its extra drag.</li>
    <li> This is the best electric shaver I&#x27;ve used. My experience includes two Brauns (5 and 7 series), one Norelco rotary, and another Panasonic (ES8103S). What I like about it: mainly the super-close, super-comfortable shaves, but also it&#x27;s easy to clean with soap and water without having the bulky cleaning bases and fluids, it has a comfortable, easy-to-hold grip, it massages the face with its vibrating head (which I believe also helps whiskers stand up), and effective sideburns trimmer. I&#x27;ve used it dry, with water and with Williams Lectric Shave - best shaves are with water or Lectric Shave, but it gives nice shaves dry. It does a nice job on those neck hairs below the jaw. Bottom line: it&#x27;s the closest to a blade I tried and it&#x27;s darn close!</li>
    <li> I use this shaver for my head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros: Works excellent dry or wet shaving. I usually shave in the shower, and I get an incredibly close shave, but it also works great for those times in the morning when I need to get in a quick shave in front of the mirror. This shaver is also very easy to clean, and charges quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: When wet shaving, sometimes shaves a little too close for the more sensitive areas, like the back of my neck. I highly recommend dry shaving for those areas. Does not get around my ears very well. I have to use a razor for that.</li>
    <li> I purchased this item because it had 4 heads or blades.  What a mistake.  Head is huge.  Pay attention to that because doing your upper lip is a chore.  It is just too big.  For a buck fifty it went back.  I got the three head model, $84.00, and i couldn&#x27;t be happier.  It is easier to use,  the head moves in and out with pressure, and that is a great feature.  Also, The head is smaller.  I mean, its still a three head but it is comfortable to use.  It cuts great, i would say as close as a blade.  It maneuvers around  your neck with ease and is very well balanced and comfortable in your hand.  I think this is the best shaver i ever had.  My last shaver was a braun and to be honest, it was ok.  but, Avoid this beast.</li>
    <li> After so much research bought this for hubby since he has a thick hair. So far he has been satisfied and his skin doesn&#x27;t get irritation when using it.</li>
    <li> Been looking for a razor I can use in the shower to shave my scalp.  This one is great!  Very little buzz vibration and no razor burn.  Shaves as smooth as a razor with just soap instead of shaving cream.  The marketing group missed the boat in not touting this for men&#x27;s scalps.  Great value.</li>
    <li> Thought this would be a really good electric razor  but it is not  my husband has to go over and over spots on his face and neck as well as use the clippers to get all his beard well shaved  Do Not spend the money</li>
    <li> i have asian hair, sparse bead with straight thick individual hairs.  this shaver works fantastic, it shaves really close and leaves no stubble.  previously had the panasonic 7103, which also shaved really close but died in less than a year.  will follow-up with how reliable this one is.  the shaver is very large and has a nice shiny dark grey finish.  there is some give when you lock the pivoting head in place.  like the soft touch vinyl/faux leather back.  fyi its made in japan.</li>
    <li> I have used Braun and Norelco shavers in the past, never even considered a Panasonic.  This is by far the best elecrtic shaver I have ever owned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it with Edge shave gel.  The shave is as close as a blade and shaves very quick.  Absolutely love it....</li>
    <li> I have avoided electric shavers for years for one reason or another but this product is excellent. Provides a clean, close shave without any razor burn or other harmful side effects. Easy to use and the best I have used to date. Very much recommend it.</li>
    <li> Every time I try an electric razor I usually have this initial burst of enthusiasm followed by disenchantment and an eventual return to a Mach 3 power wand.  My last bout with a midline Norelco ended the same way.  I liked it in the beginning but over time I really missed the closer shave I got with a blade(s).  I &#x27;ve been using this for a litlle while and it&#x27;s certainly the most expensive razor I&#x27;ve ever held let alone used.  It seems nice and substantial in your hand and gives off a pretty good air of quality (though I was expecting a little more pizazz to be honest.)  I use it wet in the shower and I usually do a quick wipe of shampoo or bodywash rubbed into the beard to prep.  It&#x27;s a better shaving experience than I&#x27;ve had with any other electric razor to be sure.  I have somewhat sensitive skin but experienced no real irritation except occasionally at the bottom of the neckline.  Otherwise it gives a nice close shave, comparable to a blade shave.  I&#x27;ll continue to use it for a while at least and see if it can ween me off of my triple blade addiction.  I didn&#x27;t see a big deal about the lack of dock or charging station myself though it apparently was an issue for others.  Pricing aside, it&#x27;s a very good quality device that definitely delivers a pretty good shave.</li>
    <li> These are my impressions of the Panasonic shaver after nearly a month of use.  I&#x27;ve previously used Norelco rotary shavers and Gillette Fusion manual razors.  This is my first experience with a foil shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DESIGN: The shaver is almost entirely silver, with an LCD screen on the front.  The screen shows what percentage you&#x27;ve used, and has icons which tell you if you need to charge it or clean it.  There is a power button on the front, as well as a lock button (so it doesn&#x27;t turn on accidently).  On the back, there is a setting where you can lock the head from moving.  The back also has the pop-up trimmer.  The shaver has a rubber material on the back so it doesn&#x27;t easily slip out of your hands when wet.  I liked the weight of it- it felt substantial without being heavy.  There is a clear plastic piece that covers the top foil part.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PERFORMANCE: Performance was excellent and I received the closest shaves I&#x27;ve ever experienced.  On my cheeks, sideburns, upper lip, and chin, the closeness of shave was terrific.  In just a matter of two or three minutes, my face would be baby skin smooth.  However, I will say it didn&#x27;t do as well of a job with my lower neck area.  I would have to spend extra time to get all the hairs on my lower neck to be shaved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was able to shave in any direction without skin irritation.  Even after I was finished, my skin felt no irritation and there was no need for any aftershave lotion or balm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One negative issue was that the shaver was louder than expected.  If you shave in the morning while your wife is sleeping, I could see this as a potential unintended alarm clock.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CLEANING AND MAINTENANCE: To clean this, you put liquid soap on the outer foil portion and hold down the power button for a few seconds.  It goes into a sonic vibration self-cleaning mode.  Then you remove the outer foil and do the sonic vibration again for the inner portion.  I found it to be easy to clean.  I would recommend doing this at least once a week.  I didn&#x27;t clean it for the first two weeks and the foil had a pretty bad odor to it.  Per the manual, you also need to replace the outer foil every year and the inner foil every two years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ACCESSORIES:  For a shaver in this high price range, I found the accessories to be severely lacking.  I would expect a stand for paying this price, as well as a decent hard case that fits both the shaver and the charger.  Instead, you get a very small soft case that only fits the shaver, and no stand at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is no doubt that this shaver is an excellent performer and will provide a very close shave.  The only issue is the high price point.  You could probably spend a lot less money and get a shave that is close enough.didn&#x27;t clean it for the first two weeks and the foil had a pretty bad odor to it.

    <li> Excellent product/...I don&#x27;t know how the Braun could be so much better @$250.  Good close shave and easy to clean as opposed to the Norelco which I have used for 40 years but  the latest model proved difficult  to clean and reassemble.  Highly recommended for the price&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Frank Smith</li>
    <li> Been shaving with a blade for the last 38 years.  Never found an electric razor that could give me a close shave over my entire face and neck including the best models from Remmington, Norelco and Braun.  All god razors but did not give me the shave I needed.  Reading the reviews all over the internet, I wanted to try the new Panasonic.  The wet shave really had me interested but the price was way too high for an experiment.  Amazon&#x27;s $100 discount led me to take a chance.  Very good shave from day one.  After a month it is a great shave!  As my face adjusts it gets better and better.  Just using water on my face,this razor gives me a shave that is 98% as good as a blade without irritated and sore skin.  My facial skin feels and appears much better. If you get a sale you will get a great shave and a better deal.  If not on sale, you still get a great shave.</li>
    <li> Great Shave... the best i ever owned and I have owne a lot of them.</li>
    <li> great performance. better experience than philips and braun. It feels better and shaves better than philips.Battery life is not that perfect.</li>
    <li> Outstanding closeness. No pulling. Fast shave in half the time of others. Large head great for shaving larger areas hard to manuever for detail. Cleans with water. Takes awhile to dry. If you want quick dry buy step up model with stand. Charges quickly and will last 10-12 days on single charge. It doesn&#x27;t get any better.</li>
    <li> Not the best product Panasonic has developed. Cuts skin even with shaving gel and foam. Very loud and noisy motor. Small trimmer is useless for anything due to its location. Would return if I could.</li>
    <li> So I don&#x27;t normally write reviews but I am so impressed with this shaver that I felt I had to do this.&lt;br /&gt;I have electric shaved for 30 years. I have always been a Braun user and been very happy. Not any more. This razor is incredible. It cuts every hair painlessly and quickly. My Braun would always leave hairs (especially grey/white ones), this catches everything with ease. I have very sensitive skin and here again this razor shines, much less irritation than before.&lt;br /&gt;Now to the best bit, the closeness of shave. I don&#x27;t think anything could cut any closer, it is incredible.&lt;br /&gt;I know tthis is slightly expensive, but in my opinion it is well worth it.</li>
    <li> I have used Norelco electric for years but found this Panasonic on deal of the day a couple of months ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using it for a couple of months I can say it is much better than any prior electric I&#x27;ve owned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very high speed, shaves smoothly and is easy to clean.  It&#x27;s a bit large and the ergonomics could be improved but overall I&#x27;m very happy with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course, no electric razor is as good as a blade but they are very convenient.</li>
    <li> I love this thing. I use it about every other day to every few days. It shaves as close as a manual razor. I never get cut. I&#x27;ve replaced the blades once so far. The battery lasts for at least a couple of weeks even though I&#x27;ve had it for over 4 years. I&#x27;m never going back to manual razors.</li>
    <li> Great Shaver.  Gives close shaves wet or dry.&lt;br /&gt;Finally replaced my Braun 8985 which follows several other Braun shavers over the years.&lt;br /&gt;New heads and cutters from Braun just &#x27;didn&#x27;t cut it&#x27;!!&lt;br /&gt;Easy to read electronics, and charges in 1 hours.</li>
    <li> I got it on sale, the price was right and the reviews were good. Tried to give it a chance, didn&#x27;t cut close, I&#x27;m a AA male, your suppose to give it a month or so for your skin to adjust, I started bumping up bad. Didn&#x27;t get as close as I thought it would using shave cream.&lt;br /&gt;The quality of the device is great, stays charged for a long time, works in the shower. I shave with a Wahl Detalier and a 5 Starr shaver, great combo, gets me smooth and keeps bump free 90% of the time</li>
    <li> This is the best Panasonic Shaver on the market so far. I had another one as a replacement from the manufacture and I liked it so much that I bought it when it was on sale although I still have almost new shaver. Very smooth and close shaver.</li>
    <li> My heart sank the first time I used this. I had read all of the positive reviews, and was so excited when I finally received it. I had a small amount of facial hair, and was ready to shave it off. After I made the first pass down my face, I yelped. It snags and pulls on even a very short beard. I barely use this now. It works okay if you&#x27;re shaving off a small dusting of facial hair, but otherwise it is pretty useless.</li>
    <li> I have owned electric shaver&#x27;s before but none of them compared to this. I was very satisfied I did not receive any skin irritation. I would recommend this to anyone I also felt it was priced very reasonable. I would recommend this shaver to anyone. I also found that a charged battery lasts several days which I feel this very important.</li>
    <li> I got my ES-LA93 on 09-01-2012 direct from Panasonic as a replacement for the Chinese made model which had to go into the shop twice.  Have not changed foil or cutter bars.  I change things when the red light comes on.  You do have to buy the soap dish and put in fresh water from time to time which goes into a separate container which snaps into place at the back of the cleaner/recharger unit right on top of the soap dish.  Never have taken to shower since back in 2012 there was talk of leakage and short circuiting.  When finished shaving I gently tap the shaver head with the foil onto the sink basin.  Makes the soap dish last longer, I would think!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I really really want to know is if the spare foil and cutter bars bought for &amp;#34;ES-LA63&amp;#34; will work in a &amp;#34;ES-LA63-S Arc4&amp;#34; Electric Shaver.  A Panasonic tech rep should have the answer to this question.  I&#x27;m buying the special price unit today but if the foil/cutters for the ES-LA63 won&#x27;t work in the  &amp;#34;ES-LA63-S Arc4&amp;#34; I&#x27;ll have to return the razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With my head in the clouds, I really never read all the blurb regarding this shaver, like it doesn&#x27;t have the box for cleaning and recharging.  That was a surprise when the shaver arrived.</li>
    <li> Power is enough, to shave very clean, cleaning is very convenient, with a period of time, feel the only regret is that voice is bigger, but this does not affect the use.</li>
    <li> It just didn&#x27;t do a good job getting the hairs on my neck. I still had to get the stray hairs with a regular razor. I also didn&#x27;t like how big the head was. It made it difficult to tell exactly where I was shaving (if I wanted to trim sideburns or around  my beard). I will say that it did a great job around my cheeks and that area was very smooth. So this razor will obviously work well for many, but not everyone. Luckily, Amazon is hassle-free when it comes to returns, so you might as well give it a try</li>
    <li> Definitely one of the better shavers made. Works well, but on my beard, does not gets the under jaw as well as the face.</li>
    <li> This razor is quiet, efficient, and well designed. Yes, it would be nice to have a battery charge indicator that shows the charge as the time the razor will run rather than a percentage of the charge in the battery. However, that is a quibble. It is, without doubt, the best razor I have ever owned and well worth the price</li>
    <li> This is my second Panasonic shaver. My previous one lasted several years. And I have no reason to believe this one won&#x27;t do the same. And this new Arc 4 model gets even closer. Love the LCD display with battery life, battery life is very good for road warriors, and contours well to my face. And for those areas I have a tough time getting close enough at first pass, I can easily go over an area multiple times without irritation. Wet or dry this thing is great. Wet, it works as well a traditional blade, and dry is great if you&#x27;re in a pinch.</li>
    <li> I have purchased hundred of products from Amazon. There is no product that has driven me to spend my time to write a review because every one of them does what is supposed to do. HOWEVER, this panny es-la63 is amazing and above my expectation, so I feel like I should write a review to help someone to choose a shaver. A little background about myself first, I have been using the braun 8985 for over three years. It has never given me the close shave I like because I would still feel the whisker after the shave. So I decided to get a shaver that can give me the closest shave. I bought the Philips 1250xcc first. I was not satisfied with its performance because it was hard to use, and it just shaved as same as my old braun. And I spent three hours doing reseach between the Braun 790 and the panny ES LA63. I finally picked up this shaver because I thought this shaver was cheaper than the braun and low maintenance cost. I can say that I am complete happy with this shaver. It gives me the closest shave I have ever wanted. After the first shave with this baby, my face was so smooth. I felt like that I have never had beard. Go with this shaver, YOU WON&#x27;T REGRET.</li>
    <li> Excellent performance - well worth the money. The multi heads gives a good close and clean shave. It is easy to handle and clean. It is water friendly and the battery lasts a good 7-9 days</li>
    <li> I hate shaving. I also hate not being clean-shaven, which presents a dilemma. For most of say, 45 years or so,I&#x27;ve preferred blades &amp; gel (Mach 3/Edge), which gives me what I want, but gets TEDIOUS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried a closet-full of electrics. The rotary \\&quot;lift-and-cut\\&quot; ones produce a perfect rash every time. The other top ones have either been disappointing in results, or make my face feel like a shop project.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After reading the other reviews here, I decided to try this one, and so far it&#x27;s a WOW.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THE GOOD&lt;br /&gt;Closest shave I&#x27;ve gotten with an electric (without including skin!).&lt;br /&gt;THE BAD&lt;br /&gt;Once rinsed, there&#x27;s no easy way to prop the head up so air circulates. Many nooks and crannies, takes a looong time to dry.&lt;br /&gt;THE ... WEIRD?&lt;br /&gt;Ergonomics. The head pivots well, better than you might think. It feels like you&#x27;re moving a floor polisher around, but it&#x27;s not hard to get used to. Sometimes I just hold it by the head, which seems to give me a better feel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;and ... THE EXTRA-WEIRD&lt;br /&gt;For a couple of years I&#x27;ve been using Nivea for Men Sensitive After Shave Balm. No alcohol, only mild scent, chamomile (whoopie ...) --- after I shave. Nice stuff, just enough moisture, not sticky, greasy, or gooey. I had particularly dry skin one morning, so I put the Nivea on BEFORE shaving with this machine, leaving a thin film. Absolutely incredible shave. WAY better than using this with Edge, or dry. For me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To each his own. Your mileage will probably be different.</li>
    <li> This shaver does not shave as close as my nerelco shaver. I was pretty disappointed considering all the 5 star reviews. Its not a bad razor but defiantly not with the money</li>
    <li> Been using an electric for around 4 years , for 3 of those years i was using the Braun 7 790cc that finally packed in probably due to my clumsiness ( suprised really it lasted 3 years the amount of times it slipped off my small sink ).&lt;br /&gt;Was going to get another 790 but got the LA63 for half the price of the 790 (only reason i bought it really ).&lt;br /&gt;First thing i was suprised with was the size , its not much bigger than the 790 i was expecting a huge head.&lt;br /&gt;My face is pretty bony with the odd acne scar so used to get pretty cut up using a cart or DE .&lt;br /&gt;First shave and it easily matched the shave from the 790 , the head got into all the hard to get places on my chicken neck.&lt;br /&gt;Its not any better than my 790 in closeness but i can happily go over areas on my neck a few times without any irritation , where the 790 would give me a bit of a raw neck if i was chasing a BBS shave.&lt;br /&gt;Had this nearly a year now and its still going strong , bought a spare foil and blade set but the blades are still as sharp as when new.&lt;br /&gt;Was a bit worried about the noise that some people have mentioned but its no louder than the Braun just at a different pitch.</li>
    <li> Bought without the charging stand. Battery life is pathetic and the head is so bulky that it is very difficult to shave around the neck.</li>
    <li> I got this as a gift for my husband and he loves it.  I did quite a bit of research before purchasing it, and it had really good reviews.  We were not disappointed!!</li>
    <li> I purchased this shaver after having used the Braun Series 5 for 5 years.  This shaver has me sold on Pansonic shavers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking for an electric razor to shave your head, I highly suggest this one.  I&#x27;ve tried other electric razors on the head but they take much longer.  I can do my whole head in 7 minutes with this one.  Powerful motor, easy to clean.  I hope it&#x27;s durable for years to come.</li>
    <li> I had seen comparisons between the ES-LA63-S and the Panasonic ES8243A (which I own also) and wasn&#x27;t too sure that I would see a tremendous difference, but decided that since my foil/blades needed to be replaced on the ES8243A, that I would give the newest model a try. People had said that the ES-LA63-S does a better job on the jawline and neck since it has the extra degree of freedom, and boy were they RIGHT! I noticed it right away! The locking feature, brighter LCD screen, and extra 1000RPM are a nice touch, but that doesn&#x27;t justify the upgrade enough for me like the extra movement does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have owned the Norelco Advantage, Panasonic ES8109S, Panasonic ES8243A, and now the ES-LA63-S, and never have I gotten such a close, comfortable, non-irritating shave from an electric for my sensitive skin. The rotary Norelco shaver really irritated my neck, and the other two Panasonics were certainly better than the Norelco, but I always had trouble with irritation on my neck since I had to go over the same area multiple times to get all the hairs. The ES-LA63-S puts an end to all of that! It not only hugs the neck and jawline so well, but feels somehow more gentle than its predecessors despite the increase in RPM. Shaving with the other two always took me 6 minutes or more wet or dry, but I can do a more thorough, less irritating job with the ES-LA63-S in around 2 minutes less time! I much prefer wet shaving to dry shaving also, and use Shave Secret oil because it allows me to see what I am doing in case I need to go back over a certain area and provides me with a slick protective barrier as well. I feel like the ES-LA63-S is \\&quot;rolling\\&quot; across my face because of the freedom of movement rather than my having to force the shaver along like it felt with the others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I would HIGHLY recommend this shaver even compared to its very similar looking predecessor - ES8243A - with the same looking \\&quot;4\\&quot; blades. It was a HUGE upgrade despite what it may seem from the pictures. WELL DONE PANASONIC - THIS IS THE KING OF ALL SHAVERS!ONE PANASONIC - THIS IS THE KING OF ALL SHAVERS!</li>
    <li> After just one use, I wasn&#x27;t convinced that this new Panasonic four-blade shaver really outperforms their excellent three-blade models.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This morning, though -- my second shave -- this shaver went to work like the little robot bodyguard Mr. Zurkon in Ratchet &amp; Clank, mowing down my whiskers the way Mr. Z. mows down bad guys. Except that the shaver did its work silently and with far less attitude!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seriously, this is the best electric shaver I&#x27;ve ever had, and I&#x27;ve had many over the years.  I can tell you that in my experience, the Panasonics with their high-speed linear motors outperform the Brauns, and the Panasonic curved blades and foil screens do a better job than the circular heads on the Norelcos.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With a built-in timer that shows you how long you shaved, this shaver accomplished its task in just 90 seconds -- that must be half the time my old three-blade Panasonic took to cover the same area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise, the trimmer on this model seems to work with less pulling than the one on my last Panasonic.  And no, you don&#x27;t need a cleaning/charging base to keep your shaver running fine.  Just put a drop of liquid soap on the head, activate the ultra-high-speed \\&quot;turbo\\&quot; mode, and rinse the shaver head clean under running water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I get the best shave dry, using the CVS pre-electric-shave lotion (the white, gooey kind -- Mennen has something similar, but a bit more expensive).  Just apply some of that, let it dry -- then let Mr. Zurkon do his job!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This isn&#x27;t the cheapest shaver on the market by a long shot, but I will venture to say that it&#x27;s the best.  Highly recommended.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ADDENDUM: I understand that Panasonic now has a FIVE-blade model, which could be even better (I haven&#x27;t tried that one myself, as Mr. Zurkon is still working fine).  So -- it is possible that this model no longer offers the VERY best shave, just a VERY good one...</li>
    <li> I have had some very good electric shavers, but this Panasonic ES-LA63-S Arc IV is absolutely FANTASTIC!  I have put away my Braun Shaver and its electronic cleaner bath device for good.  The Panasonic gives a much closer and smother shave, while not needing a \\&quot;bath device\\&quot; to keep it clean.  Also the Panasonic works wet or dry (even in the shower).  The shaver is much quieter than the Braun as well.  My advice:  DON&#x27;T BUY ANY OTHER SHAVER - THIS IS THE ONE!</li>
    <li> For me, performance trumps features, battery endurance, size, shape, etc. And on performance alone this shaver gets 5-stars! It replaces another brand, now 6-years old that admittedly was not a, \\&quot;pricey\\&quot; example of the craft. I am extremely impressed with the closeness of the shave that this razor gives: clearly closer than my other shaver and close enough to a blade (which I now use less &amp; less) that the difference is negligible, even judged 4-5-Hr after the shave. The manufacturer asks you to give it 30-days so your beard will \\&quot;adjust\\&quot; (align?) to the new shaver, but I was sold on the 1st use!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve not used it wet, though I have rinsed &amp; cleaned it in cold water. It is easily cleaned and required (and got) NO special treatment for drying. Following each shave, the LCD on the handle displays (briefly!): 1) time of shave and 2) % remaining battery power, Mine are typically 2&#x27;12\\&quot; to 2&#x27;32\\&quot; and the battery lasts, easily 14-shaves and more.</li>
    <li> Bought this razor after my last one (also a Panasonic - Vortex Hydraclean) died.  Bought the last Panasonic in December 2006, so almost four years.  The one before that was also a Panasonic wet-dry and lasted about four years as well.  For the price I would expect them to last a little longer.    This one does not have a cleaning station, but I really consider that a plus.  It cleans easily with a couple drops of soap then running under water.    I always shave in the shower (wet), so I cannot comment on the dry capability, but this shaver cuts quicker and cleaner than any other shaver I have used.  I get a good close shave in 2-1/2 minutes - even on my neck.      It is much bigger than any other shaver I have owned, but that has not been a problem.  I can get close to my sideburns and nose without a problem.  Originally used it with the head locked, but have switched over to keeping the head floating.  Seems like I get better contact.    Battery life is not as good as my last Panasonic, but is still good.  Looks like I will get a little less than two weeks (not shaving a couple days during that period).    Overall highly recommended.    April 2011 Update:  Screen on shaver malfunctioned.  Still worked, but screen was unreadable.  Contacted Panasonic via their online customer service and sent the shaver to their facility in McAllen, TX. Took about a week, but they sent me a refurbished unit.  So far so good there.  Not great thit failed so quickly, but they were responsive and got me up and running.</li>
    <li> have had this shaver now for about 2 weeks. previously used a norelco and a braun. i&#x27;d agree with other reviewers that this shaver is a little louder than other electric shavers. that being said, i think its given me the best shave of the others i&#x27;ve tried. i do have a light beard, and don&#x27;t know if those with heavier beards will have the same experience. all i can say is that i do like this shaver. handle takes a little getting used to but after a few days no prob. nice digital readout re remaining time, when to clean, etc. i&#x27;ve had other panasonic products and never been disappointed. i bought this without the additonal stand, which i&#x27;m not sure is truly needed. all in all best electric shaver i&#x27;ve had the pleasure of owning, and i&#x27;d recommend it.</li>
    <li> My husband likes this shaver quite a bit more than his previous one and I like the fact that it is much quieter.</li>
    <li> I have used electric shavers for over 57 years.  I have a heavy beard especially around the chin. My beard grows very fast[[ASIN:B002N5MHLU Panasonic ES-LA63-S Arc IV Multi Flex Nanotech Rechargeable Shaver, Silver]]. Now I can get a day and half before having to shave again. This is the best shaver I have ever owned.  I started years ago with Sunbeam then not in order Remington, Norelco, Panasonic, Braun and back to the new Panasonic.  This newer shaver cuts closer, smoother, faster than any previous shaver. With a beard that grows in different directions like mine you can hear the razor cut then feel what was uncut and change direction and the beard is gone.  It is very good around the neck and the trimmer is also good.  It is easy to clean, works real well and I like the bigger head.  Took no time at all to get the shave I wanted.  It is much better than I thought it might be. I had no break in time with this shaver.</li>
    <li> My Braun was 6 years old (2 on the current foil and cutter blades). It seemed like a good time to replace it with this shaver while less than 1/3 the recommended retail price.    Unpack it: Damn that&#x27;s a big head. Plug in the charger. A little awkward: the shaver end is polarized +/- and only goes in one way, but it&#x27;s not entirely obvious. Takes an hour to charge and won&#x27;t run off the cord. Oh well, figured it&#x27;d warn me (it does have a very cool LCD display) in time to keep from depleting the battery. Worst case I could get a \\&quot;quick charge\\&quot; in five minutes. (The old Braun would run directly off the cord when you ran the battery down.)    1st shave: Panasonic dry, it irritated my skin. Some bleeding. Stubble remained (I&#x27;m 52 been shaving with electrics all my life, I&#x27;m not new to this stuff!). Figured I&#x27;d give a wet shave a whirl next try. The shaver is lighter than I expected given its humongous size. The shaver head is ridiculously large. It really only has 2 foil blades with a long-hair cutter in the middle and an extra permanent foil cutter next to it that some designer thought would be a good selling point \\&quot;Arc IV!!!\\&quot;. I could barely see myself behind the shaver head! (ok that last bit is exaggeration, but the thing is unnecessarily huge.)     2nd shave: Panasonic wet (soapy lather). I felt like a grown up lathering up my face and buzzing away. No irritation, but running my tongue over my mustache area I felt stubble. (sorry for the visual). Rationalized maybe I needed to \\&quot;get used\\&quot; to it.    3rd shave. Panasonic Wet. Started questioning what I was doing; after all the point of an electric is to skip the shaving cream ritual, isn&#x27;t it? Still had stubble. After drying off I got out the old Braun and quickly finished what the panasonic failed to do.    4th shave. Braun, Dry. Taking the same care I took with the new shaver to do a thorough job, the 6 year old Braun did a much better, smoother job, with no stubble remaining, with no fussing around with shaving wet.The old Braun has 3 cutters and its head is shaped like a racing car&#x27;s grill compared to the Panasonic Buick grill.    5th shave. Braun. Packed the panasonic up for return to Amazon. Sorry about that.    Think about it people: The Panasonic is discounted more than 50% to an actual price point less than equivalent quality Brauns and Norelcos. I admit I fell for the gimmick that I thought I was getting a three hundred dollar shaver at a fraction of the cost. I figured it&#x27;d be an improvement over a very used Braun. It wasn&#x27;t. You get what you pay for.    Granted, there are a lot of skin and beard types, but having used a couple Norelcos, one Remington, 2 Brauns, I know what to expect from a shaver. The switch to Braun 15 years ago was a completely better experience than what I had before. This time the switch to Panasonic was a step in the wrong direction.    It might work well for you, but don&#x27;t sell yourself on the idea you&#x27;re getting a deal.</li>
    <li> I have been a devoted Braun shaver since the early 1970s.  My last Braun shaver, one of the more recent models, was burnt out by faulty wiring while on vacation, so I started looking around for a new one.  I have been disappointed by Braun over the past few years.  I saw the quality of their shavers slipping and am not a big fan of those base cleaners that require you to keep investing in their products through the life of their shavers.      I read the reviews of the Panasonic shavers and after nearly 40 years decided to jump ship.  I am delighted with the Panasonic ES-LA 63.  It is about $100 cheaper than the Braun, gives me a better and closer shave, seems of better quality, is much quieter, and now I can dispense with those costly base cleaners.  I simply clean the Panasonic every other day by using liquid hand soap and running it through its cleaning cycle under the tap.     Braun is spending too much on advertising and too little on product quality and performance.  Don&#x27;t be fooled.      I have had my Panasonic for a couple of months now and couldn&#x27;t be more pleased. I have never taken the time to write a review on Amazon, but I am totally sold on this model shaver and wanted to pass it on.  Way to go, Panasonic!</li>
    <li> After a month using the ES-LA63-S, I wonder how Panasonic&#x27;s competition stay in business.  I use it with shaving cream (wet) and it&#x27;s just as good if not better then my Fusion blade and the smooth shave last longer! I had an older Panasonic I used wet and it was good but, didn&#x27;t do well on my neck.  That is not the case with this model, it shaves great every where. I have a Remington I paid over $200 for and it&#x27;s a piece of junk, not even close to the Panasonic.  If you are serious about getting a new electric shaver, get this one.  Hands down, it is the best, period!</li>
    <li> This was a Christmas Present.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I shave my head and have a full beard.  This shaves as close as a blade when used with shaving cream.  I had a top of the line three head Norelco that was nowhere near as close.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does a good dry shave as well, but not as close as a razor dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Easy to clean&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I get about 7-10 shaves/charge&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The beard trimmer works but is not great.  The location makes it hard to see what you are cutting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Being a Wet/Dry razor, you can not shave with it plugged it.  This could be a problem whe the batteries start to die.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Worth the price.  The wet shave is as close as a blade.  Cut my morning shave time by about 5+ minutes&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;GaryDZ</li>
    <li> I received this as a gift from the wife and let me tell you I was excited. I saw the reviews, and had a crappy Norelco that tore my face to shreds whenever I used it. I was forced to use throwaway razors and the ones with the expensive cartridges.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I get this one, charge it fully, and then throw some shaving gel on my face (it says to treat yourself with gel/cream and feel the difference). I immediately thought \\&quot;wow, this doesn&#x27;t hurt at all, it&#x27;s not pulling hairs!\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course I quickly discovered the reason was because it wasn&#x27;t cutting AT ALL. I mean I went up, and down, side to side, and nothing. I was forced to settle for using my cheap Bic to finish the mess this crappy piece of junk left behind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am going to return this immediately. What a big waste of time, and a disappointment. At least I&#x27;ll save $155.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe you&#x27;ll have better luck than I did, or maybe I got a bad one, but beware.</li>
    <li> My husband is really surprised by this shaver.  Didn&#x27;t want to give up his old one that he had for 10 years, but same company and apparently same great quality.  He is very happy and so am I!</li>
    <li> I have been a Norelco rotary razor user ever since I could grow facial hair (almost 40 years). My dad used Norelcos and I followed his lead.  Never had tried a foil-type razor until I came across the ES-LA63 and read all the good reviews.    Talk about a difference! My beard grows rather quickly, and I would have to pass the Norelco over my face to freshen it up before going out in the evening.  No need with the Panasonic! From the first day I used it, I could tell that I was going to love it.  Takes a few days to break old habits of shaving patterns after using a rotary shaver for so many years.  The shave got better every day, and the time to complete the shave got less and less.  I&#x27;m down to 3 minutes or less now.  No issues with skin irritation or cuts whatsoever. I always shaved dry with the Norelco and continue to do so with the Panasonic...can&#x27;t imagine getting any closer by shaving wet with the ES-LA63.    Only beef I have is not with the razor - it is with Amazon&#x27;s shipping time.  I realize this product comes with Super Saver Shipping (sent via Postal Service - not the fastest).  But Amazon took 4 business days to ship it out.  They used to do better than that.</li>
    <li> Over the years I&#x27;ve mostly been an electric shaver guy.  I&#x27;ve had mixed results with blades, including a satisfied run in recent years with the [[ASIN:B003987CL0 Gillette Fusion Proglide Power Razor, 1-count Package]] and preceding Fusion Power line of blades.  This satisfaction was heavily diminished by the ever increasing price of blades ($45 for 14 at a warehouse club), and I once again decided to go with a more permanent solution.  While I&#x27;ve had good results with Norelco and Braun offerings, I&#x27;ve been most satisfied with Panasonic, so that&#x27;s mostly why I went with this shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I opted to get the best shaver I could for the $$$ by forsaking any charging station/cleaning apparatus, and thus far I couldn&#x27;t be happier.  The Arc IV is a funny looking shaver, abandoning the cleaner lines of previous designs for a more ergonomic (well if you exclude the challenges created by its immense head) approach.  The large head includes four cutters, but only two traditional blade blocks.  There are three foils, and a fourth row of blades for larger hairs, and the whole endeavor moves quite nimbly across my face.  The only real challenge is in relation to the size of the head, but you quickly learn how to wield this shaver like Thor would Mj&amp;ouml;llnir (or perhaps a bit better)!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those of you new to electric shavers, give it a week to ten days to allow for your skin to adapt to the shaver and vice versa.  You should get good results right off the bat, but it will get better once this break in is completed.  For those of you new to Panasonic shavers, it will work fine dry, but give a good wet shave a try.  You won&#x27;t be disappointed.  You won&#x27;t need any special goo, as just about anything (including a light bit of shaving creme/gel) will do.  This seems to yield a much closer and more satisfying shave.  Once done, simply rinse the bits of hair and any shaving medium off, shake it dry, and it&#x27;ll be ready for the next shave.  An occasional bath in a bit of soapy water will keep it nice and clean (it has a hyper fast cleaning setting).  One last tip, while this works well either wet or dry, a damp shaver (say one cleaned an hour or so before using) can be irritating on a dry face, so either wait until its dry or go all wet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as other details, it&#x27;s all good.  Charge times are modest; battery life is good; it locks off for travel; and its been a charm to use.  I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s a better shaver out there, but between Amazon&#x27;s and Panasonic&#x27;s (30 day trial period) return policies, you don&#x27;t have much to lose.p it nice and clean (it has a hyper fast cleaning setting).

    <li> I&#x27;ve used a Panasonic shaver for years, one like this but with fewer blades, fewer features. (But as I recall, it actually cost more than this one. So maybe that explains my issues.)  I replaced it after about 7 years only because the sideburn trimmer broke and because the replacement blades/foils had never delivered quite the shave the originals had.  But it still shaved better than this one (for me).  Your experience may differ, but I&#x27;m disappointed.  I haven&#x27;t tossed the old shaver yet.  That says something.  UPDATE:  After 3 months, it&#x27;s still terrible for me.  The head is too large; wet or dry, the shave is poor.  I&#x27;m still using my old (Panasonic) razor.  I haven&#x27;t tossed this one yet, but only because the sideburn trimmer on the back is usable. Otherwise it would be gone. Downgraded to one star.</li>
    <li> I have been used to the rotary shavers in the past, so this was a bit of an experiment for me, read the reviews and ratings, interesting that the newer models do not rate as high as this one. I am a happy shopper with this product and would recommend it.</li>
    <li> As I have aged, my facial hair has become progressively more difficult to shave.  Through the years, I&#x27;ve tried most of the top brands of shavers with varying success.  For a while, I heard Braun was the best and owned about three of them, but was never happy with the length of time it took me to shave or the closeness.  One of them had a battery that failed as soon as the warranty ran out.  The last one came with the cleaning system that requires frequent purchase of pricey cleaner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About ten years ago, I ran across a Panasonic shaver at Sharper Image that they guaranteed to be the best, so I fell for the hype and bought one.  It proved to be the best shave I had received up to that point and it is still working today.  I was sold on Panasonic.  But when I read about the reviews on the new ES-LA63-S on Amazon and their excellent price, I decided to try it out.  I&#x27;m very glad I did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, you&#x27;ll find glowing reviews of other brands - particularly the more expensive Braun - but I can say that I have never had a closer, more long-lasting shave, nor have I been able to shave more quickly than with this Panasonic.  I&#x27;m even shaving with gel now for the first time ever.  You can virtually go two days between shaves.  And the neck area below my chin has always been a problem area with whiskers needing to be cut and recut from a variety of angles.  It usually takes me as long to cut that area as the entire rest of my face combined.  No more.  My neck is shaved smooth just as quickly as any other area and I can complete a very close shave in no more than four minutes.  Cleaning the shaver is a breeze as well - no need to buy gimmicky cleaner refills.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now my greatest problem is what to do with all the extra spare time I now have away from shaving.  You will not be disappointed with this product.  Best ever.</li>
    <li> Nice Close Clean shave.  Gets the job done right!!  I am a man that needs to shave every day, so I need a good shaver that will last.  Definitely feels good against my skin and my my wife likes how soft it leaves my skin.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin, so I get razor bumps easily. I have tried manual razors, norelco shavers, braun shavers, and 2 other panasonic models, this one is BY FAR the best of all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ES-LA63-S VS ES8109S&lt;br /&gt;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Both shavers provided an extremely close shave (when new), the BIG difference is that the ES-LA63 doesn&#x27;t cut my skin at all. I shave against the hair direction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I won&#x27;t compare the ES-LA63-S against other electric shavers, because I dislike all the others, the LA63 is the only one that doesn&#x27;t cut my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THE GOOD:&lt;br /&gt;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&lt;br /&gt;1)Smooth and close dry shave.&lt;br /&gt;2)Excellent battery life - I shave 2-3 times per week and I recharge maybe every 2 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;3)It looks and feels great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THE NOT-SO-GOOD:&lt;br /&gt;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&lt;br /&gt;1)It might be just me, but I think the wet shaving is not for those with sensitive skin&lt;br /&gt;2)The trimmer is not very good, it&#x27;s just OK.&lt;br /&gt;3)It doesn&#x27;t do such a great job shaving the neck area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THE BAD:&lt;br /&gt;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&lt;br /&gt;I bought it 1 year ago and I can tell it needs new blades and possibly a new foil too. The price for both is about $46. That&#x27;s expensive. I&#x27;ll update this review once I purchase them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONCLUSION:&lt;br /&gt;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&lt;br /&gt;This may very well be the best option for those with sensitive skin. I still have to try the Braun  7, but I believe Panasonic is in a complete different league.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;RECOMMENDATIONS FOR THOSE WITH SENSITIVE SKIN:&lt;br /&gt;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&lt;br /&gt;1) Shave DRY at night before taking a shower&lt;br /&gt;2) Wash you face with a soap like the Neutrogena soap bar&lt;br /&gt;3) Apply a moisturizer (after shower)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This works for me, I don&#x27;t get razor bumps any more and my face looks great in the morning.</li>
    <li> I have used a few Remington shavers for about 30 years.  This is my first Panasonic shaver which I have had for 1 month.  This shaver is smooth feeling to the skin while shaving, delivers a close cut, and cuts most hair on the first pass, still need to go over typical tough areas like chin and neck.  Wife commented on how quite this shaver was compared to the Remington.  The lock-off feature is good for traveling.  After shaving the % of battery life is displayed for a few seconds.  One improvement would be to allow shaving while charging.  Looking at other reviews this shaver scored the highest.  Consumer reports however rated it 3rd.  I am very happy with this product and would recomend.</li>
    <li> Love this electric razor.  It give a smooth shave and does it real fast.  A big improvement over my previous electric razor.</li>
    <li> I purchased this to replace a Braun 7000 series.  It shaves much much closer than the Braun ever did.  The cutter head and foil technology is very similar to the Braun&#x27;s.  If the Panasonic has a shortcoming, it is the size of the internal battery.  My beard is light and shaving only takes around 120 seconds according to the display.  After five days or 10-12 minutes of total shaving time, the display indicates the battery charge is down to 50%.  These numbers have been constant for the eight weeks I have owned the shaver.  Knowing that LI-ion batteries do not like being fully discharged, I plug in the charger every five days or so.  Not a big deal I suppose and the shaver is fully charged within 30 to 45 minutes.  Note to Panasonic: The handle is somewhat skinny ever for my small hands so you could increase the battery size and still have a handle that fits the hand.  With this one change you would have a great product.</li>
    <li> My husband loves this shaver.  He gets a really close shave with it.  He says it is far superior to other electric shavers he has had in the past.  He attributes it to the high RPM.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in my late 60&#x27;s. About every  10-15 years I will try the \\&quot;latest and greatest\\&quot; electric shaver to see if it can replace my razor and golden priced blade cartridges.  Ultrafoil,fail; rotating blades,fail; floating rotating blades,fail. Tried one last time @ 3 weeks ago. Purchased this shaver, Used it the next day after I received it and haven&#x27;t looked back.  The razors and their precious cartridges haven&#x27;t been out of the drawer since the first shave.  Used my shaving gel until the can I was using ran out. Used a shave cream in a tube meant for razors until an oil I ordered on Amazon came in and have used that and another pre/after shave lotion I also ordered came in yesterday.  Both seem to work very well.  This shaver shaves as close as or negligibly as close as my razors. I love the fact I can rinse it and dip it in water.  I can shave without the mess and the possibility of getting a good nic. You can get a little nic but it wouldn&#x27;t require a steptic pencil. I highly recommend this product. I haven&#x27;t tried the Braun but I&#x27;m sure they are excellent. The fact that this can go in the water, go in the shower is a definite plus. If anything I wish that they made a charging/cleaning station for this model as they do for their other high-end shavers. Will most likely wait for a new model season to upgrade to a kit version of their best shaver.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t think I will ever go back to a razor. Might have to throw one of the disposable multi-blade ones in a toiletry kit for any emergency overnight travel.  But even that seems remote.&lt;br /&gt;Now then, does anyone know of someplace I can give all (have both major American brands) of the top of the line razors and cartridges I have sitting in my bathroom drawer?</li>
    <li> WOW...I have used norelco trip heads (high end ones) for years and this razor just blows them away! esp tough white parts of beard come away easily and leave my face smoother than it has been for a long time. I just dry shaved using the razor for the first time and I don&#x27;t even see the need for lather or water. I don&#x27;t know how long this will last but while it does I am a happy camper!</li>
    <li> Best shaver I have ever owned. Used for 1.5 years now with no trouble.</li>
    <li> Bought it to replace my trusted ES3000 which I had for many years.. would much have found another ES3000 but they are no longer available..&lt;br /&gt;This one is taking some getting used to but it does a good job shaving after all, thats what its for,,</li>
    <li> Excellent product! Gives you very close shave.</li>
    <li> It did not work for me.  I had high expectations for this shaver because of the reviews on line.  The shaver pulled my hair without cutting it.  After 4 days of trying it and having the same results that was it.  Very disappointed as I had a Series 3 Braun that worked much better than this one.  End result, had to return it.  My beard is also light, so this shaver should have worked.  I don&#x27;t see how this shaver will work on a heavy tough beard, not sure though, since I only have my experience with my light beard.</li>
    <li> My husband loves this razor! Uses it every day!</li>
    <li> 1 Percentage of power displayed.&lt;br /&gt;2 Easy to clean.&lt;br /&gt;3 Confortable in using.&lt;br /&gt;4 And the most improtant, nice price at about $90.</li>
    <li> I finally found the one.  This shaver is the best one I&#x27;ve ever had.  Definitely worth the price and more.</li>
    <li> My Favorite electric razor ever (after 45 years!)&lt;br /&gt;Bought one, it was stolen then bought 2 more because I was travelling back and forth between two countries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have even tried others AFTER I bought this on (just to be sure) and still prefer it!</li>
    <li> This is very good shaver for me. Razors is very sharp and cut very well. Also, the package contains all necessary items like a shaver case and free voltage (100-240V) power adaptor.</li>
    <li> When I bought this, I was thinking of going cheaper again, but am glad I spend the extra bucks ($100 on sale).  This shaver gives me the quickest, cleanest shave of all 5 electric shavers I&#x27;ve owned.  Like all of them, it does best on the face, not the neck, but it still shaves the neck better than the rest.  Plus it&#x27;s made in Japan.  And I like the display.  On the downside, I&#x27;m pretty sure the beard trimmer is next to useless (it works, but it&#x27;s hard to use).  My first two shavers were Norelco&#x27;s which were OK, but eventually died (switch on the first,  batteries on the second).  Then I bought a Panasonic made in Japan ES762, my #2 favorite shaver, which I used for 10 years until the batteries died.  I replaced it with a Panasonic ES7109, which was OK, but not as nice as the ES762.  When the ES7109&#x27;s batteries died, I was able to revive the ES762 by getting some affordable NiCad batteries with tabs from Digikey.  I will be keeping the ES762 because its beard trimmer is good, and it&#x27;s nice to have a backup, but it&#x27;s showing it&#x27;s age (~16 years old); for example, it&#x27;s no longer waterproof.  So when I saw the ES-LA63 on sale, I bought it, and hope it will last as long.  As mentioned at the start, so far I&#x27;ve been very pleased with it.  Update: still the best shaver I&#x27;ve used.  Unlike the ES7109, it will quickly shave away 2-3 days growth.  My old ES762 has been lonely.</li>
    <li> INCREDIBLE x99!!!!  I have been wasting years of my life not using this shaver.  I am bald.  I am able to shave my face and head in 4.5 minutes.  and the shave is close, I swear it is better than, using a 4 blade razor. I can not speak highly enough about the ES-LA63.  I hate my ring of hair I have. Going bald SU....STINKS.  I now can shave everyday in the shower because it is so quick and easy.  Even if I miss a few days the razor still goes through my thick (what I have left is still thick) hair.  The only issue, its not all roses, is around my adams apple and lower neck.  It took me a little while to figure out how to shave the area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried 5 razors over 5 months(I used the return policy to find the right shaver) to find the right one.  I would never have done that if I used the ES-LA63 the first time.  I hope this helps.  If you are trying to find a shaver, use this one first.</li>
    <li> This has worked very well delivering a better wet shave than a dry shave but both are very acceptable.  It has a little difficulty with the neck but I haven&#x27;t found a eclectric shaver that is good in that area.</li>
    <li> Got for my dad and he loves it! He sats it  does a great job but impressed how ir doesn&#x27;t pulk and sensitive to hisvskin  He was impressed with the shaver.</li>
    <li> This shaver should come with 0 stars. I used it twice and it did not cut at all. The 29.99 ones at Walmart work a lot better</li>
    <li> Amazing shaver! I had an older Braun shaver. Doesn&#x27;t even compare to this one. I have to say its we&#x27;ll worth the money. Before I fully switched to this shaver I was using a 4 blade shaver. While shaving with a blade is faster and generally gives you a somewhat closer shave, I didn&#x27;t like how my skin feels after. With this phillips shaver, I can get pretty much the same shave and stil have soft skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This phillips is pretty quiet, comfortable and efficient. Battery lasts for about 2 weeks. I generally shave every other day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t recommend spending money on the docking station. The cleaning cycle on this shaver is more than you need to keep the shaver fresh and clean.</li>
    <li> replaced my Es8163. used it for a week now with gel/foam.  very close shaving. and very smoth on the skin.  very easilly cleaned.  it appears a bit too \\&quot;plastic\\&quot; but otherwise it does the job</li>
    <li> This is a great shaver.This is my second Panasonic and I am a very happy Customer and very happy with Amazon.My only complaint is that I cannot import spare cutters and foil from Amazon as it comes up &#x27;cannot ship to this address&#x27;.I am in Australia and I can get the shaver from Amazon but can&#x27;t import the spares!</li>
    <li> I have tried electric razors over the years and found none that would work for me but came across ths one on sale on black friday deals in 2010 and for the great price I gave it a try and glad I did. I just ordered my second one for my son who has started shaving and is using mine. I said first time I see the shaver on sale I&#x27;m getting another one and that day was yesterday. I have read some reviews here and some complaine about the battery but I have had no issues, one thing that helps the battery is letting it run all the way down sometimes before charging will help and then charging it anyway mine last plenty long enough for me and it charges fast and I like the led screen. I did change the blades and foil top a couple months ago and made it like new and would say it would be a good idea to change those depending on your usage, mine was at one year and eight months when I changed my blades but will do it a little sooner next time.</li>
    <li> This shaver is one of the best, smoothest, quickest shavers I have ever used, I highly recommend this shaver, it&#x27;s quiet, and works like a charm</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had some terrible luck in the past with electric shavers, but this Panasonic is doing wonders. It&#x27;s easy to use, doesn&#x27;t yank the hairs out and cuts close to the skin for a smooth shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s easy to clean, tells you when it&#x27;s dirty and holds a charge for a very long time. No concerns about 5 day business trips anymore!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Charges fully within one hour, lasts for a long time between charges. The trimmer is small, but works great as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend to any other man who shaves regularly.</li>
    <li> I bought the Panasonic ES-LA63-s in May of 2011. It worked great, giving a shave that is very close to a blade shave. I useed the shaver for  about 3 months then a hole developed in the screen part of the shaver. Now it cuts my face when I try to use it.   Today I called Panasonic&#x27;s customer service and was transferred 3 times before I could speak with someone.  After I decsribed my shaver&#x27;s issue they said it was considered a consumer item and was not covered under the 2 year parts and labor warranty.  Because I paid (Target) $149.99 for this unit I am upset that it is now impossible to use, and they will not send a new screen. The  only option is to buy a new screen for $60.00. If this screen fails 2 or 3 times a year I would be better off buying a $29.00 shaver  and tossing it after one year!!</li>
    <li> Have used for about a month.  Replaced a Norelco and an old Panasonic razor with this razor.  It provides a nice close shave, has a very good battery life and is easy to clean.  Happy so far</li>
    <li> This shaver actually cuts closer than my Braun...faster rpms (15,000)and larger shaving head. I could never get a close shave before. Worth every penny, highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Had to replace my razor and tried this one.  I love this, I don&#x27;t have to use filters and soap to clean it which can be expensive.  My old one had a filter and cleaner to replace monthly and cost $11.00 each.  It died before Christmas and tried this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Quiet, close and smooth shave, no pulling, recharges fast and easy to clean.  According to instructions I only have to replace blades once a year.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> THIS REPLACED A SHAVER, A BRAUN, THAT MY HUSBAND HAS HAD FOR YEARS AND COULD NO LONGER GET PARTS FOR IT.  HE LIKES THIS ONE BETTER AND I NOTICED HOW QUICKLY HE IS DONE SHAVING.  GREAT SHAVER!</li>
    <li> My husband finally found a shaver he likes.</li>
    <li> A portable packaging, easy to use.simple sense is very good.</li>
    <li> Value! It&#x27;s for my beard!</li>
    <li> Used Braun razors for years and was not very satisfied.bought them because they were rated excellent. This panasonic out performs them all! Nice close shave without irritation. It&#x27;s a little big, but easy to handle.lots of battery time.</li>
    <li> Absolutely the best shave that I have ever gotten using this razor for ~2 months now. I use it completely dry, but it does have the option to wet shave as well. I have very sensitive skin and was getting pimples due to my last razor. Switched to this and after a few weeks of my skin getting used to it, my face is completely cleared up. Also love that I can wash it so quickly and easily using just water.</li>
    <li> In the last year I&#x27;ve purchased, and given away, the Braun 7 Series Pulsonic and the Norelco/Phillips 1250 Senso Touch. Both required at least 5 min to go over and over the same facial area and 12 hours later it was noticeable I needed a shave. This shaver does the job in 3 min, doesn&#x27;t have a silly (and expensive to refill) cleaning station and gets all the facial hair, the first time. Even the weird hairs at the base of your neck that required using the trimmer on the other shavers. Seriously, I&#x27;ve had it for two days and am in love with it. My only concern is how long the batteries will last. I had a Linear Panasonic about 10 years ago and the batteries only lasted for 2-3 years. Panasonic&#x27;s customer service made it impossible to get them replace/changed out. Hopefully they&#x27;ve learned. This is, without question, the most expensive of the top three shavers, but it provides the easiest and best shave. Only time will tell if it&#x27;s worth the extra money.</li>
    <li> Purchased this shaver in Nov 2012.  The shaver itself is very good on my fairly light beard and especially when compared with a Norelco.  After about 9 months, the LCD panel began to act up (a common problem I&#x27;ve since learned) and about a week or so after that started, it went completely out.  I called Panasonic and was directed to return it to their exchange facility in MacAllen, TX which I did.  About two weeks later, I received a call from Panasonic telling me that the unit would be replaced and to expect it in 5-7 working days.  Now, some 9 WEEKS! later, and after several phone calls and spending literally hours on hold, I was told that they were out of stock (same excuse they had given me four times previously) and that they would refund the price of the shaver.  I don&#x27;t have a problem with that decision but surely it should/could have been made much earlier in the process.  Most companies would have just upgraded me to the next higher model and been done with it.  As it is, Panasonic has lost a customer.  Although I really liked the shaver, I&#x27;ll be changing to a Braun.</li>
    <li> Nice soft shave on sensitive skin. Easy to charge. Lightweight and flexible head. Originally ordered at regular Amazon price, but razor was featured a week later on deal of the day! Amazon credited my credit card with the difference. No hassles whatever. Thanks Amazon.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used electric shavers for the last 30 years, most recently top of the line Philips shaver. I liked Braun one before, but it was too rough. This one cuts much closer and better in curved areas than Philips and it had good Made in Japan quality feel to it. Battery charge remaining display and shave timer are useful for long travels, as I don&#x27;t like to drag charger with me. Now I know it will last for 3 week trip on a single charge.</li>
    <li> Does what it says so far.  Very close shave.. I definitely recommend it.  Plus at the deal of the day at $99 i couldn&#x27;t resist.</li>
    <li> Initially, this razor quickly provided a very good, close shave - I would have given it 4-5 stars.  Four months later, however, it&#x27;s impossible for me to get a decent shave in under 5 minutes - and even then I&#x27;m not satisfied (I use it wet with shaving cream).  Replacement blades and foil are $50-$60, and are only supposed to be replaced each 1-2 years.  I called customer service 5 times before finally talking to someone who could assist me, and they want me to mail the razor back at my own expense then wait 7-10 days without shaving for the new one to arrive.  Beware of these great reviews - I think you will be sorely disappointed with this razor in the long run.</li>
    <li> 1.5 years later and I&#x27;m thinking about new blades.  They&#x27;re expensive but I guess not too bad.  I haven&#x27;t put a cent into shaving since I bought this.</li>
    <li> I had a Norelco at least 15 years that I loved.  It gave me a great shave, easy to clean etc., etc..  When it quit I bought a new Norelco due to the experience with the old one.  What a difference, it would not shave me, it actually took 7 to 8 minutes to get a bad shave.  It made my face sore.  I called the company and was told the head was new and improved and no other head was available.  I&#x27;m now retired so I put up with it because I can get away with shaving every two or three days, I thought.  My wife bought me the panasonic.  I&#x27;ve only had it a few weeks, but it is really nice. Nice clean shave in three to four minutes, no more sore face.</li>
    <li> Works great in the shower. Had it several months and no problems. Battery charge lasts a LOOONG time.</li>
    <li> This is a nice shaver, beats the comparatively priced BRAUN shavers I used before (the last one just fell apart on me, so I decided to switch after reading about many others complaining, I guess Gillette/Procter&amp;Gamble has finally managed to drive the Germans into the ground). Got three years of nice shaves when the LCD panel started going wonky. After 4 years it started cutting out under load on the 6th day of shaving for 4 minutes each, so I am guessing the battery isn&#x27;t holding more than 50% of the original charge anymore. Those two problems got the rating down from 5 stars. Since amazon.com offers these at such a good price I ordered a slightly cheaper model from Panasonic, the RAMDASH-3, which is much sleeker and lighter (but less sophisticated, i.e., no swivel head). I switched to electric wet shave when abandoning BRAUN, and I think the units cannot prevent some wetness from getting inside, and that is probably why the LCD panel went (it would still indicate when the charging is completed).</li>
    <li> I have used a rotary type for many years. But lately have not been happy with the results.  So I thought I would something different. Am very pleased with my  Purchase itgives a great shave..</li>
    <li> After 30 or so years of shaving this is the first electric shaver I&#x27;ve used.  The shave is not razor close but it is close enough to get by without my looking unshaved. What I do like about it is the ability to dry shave, which is especially good when the water is running cold and I&#x27;m in a hurry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The order process and delivery all were up to Amazon&#x27;s usual high standards.</li>
    <li> With all the hoopla the advertisement has about this razor and all its fancy gadgets, it STILL doesn&#x27;t cut as smooth as a 4-blade razor &amp; shaving cream. I experimented with both since I shave BOTH my face &amp; head. After using the Panasonic ES-LA63-S 4-blade electronic fully charged razor, I STILL had to over several parts of my face &amp; dome with a regular razor to get the stubble that this electronic one missed! A whole lotta hype for a whole lotta money and it ain&#x27;t worth it. Got myself a refund from Amazon.</li>
    <li> Either my beard is too tough and growth too intense or electric shavers can never be a good replacement for the traditional blades. I do not appear to have evolved sufficiently from our ancestors and suffer from a hairy body which extends to facial hair too. All my life I have experimented with different shaving gels, blades and shavers and I thought I had finally found a good electric shaver. However, after 7 months of usage I am going to revert to my earlier blades, but, this is easier said than done because the growth of the hair on your face changes and it takes a while to go back to manual blades.   Positives - the upper part of the face (upper lip and chin) get a much much closer shave than any blade  Negatives - 1) you still need shaving gels as dry shaves leave large patches of hair and are painful  2) The lower part of your face (neck and area below the jaw line and chin) still need to be shaved by blades as no amount of trying shaves that area cleanly  3) shaving time increases from 6 minutes to 20, and, on the days when you need to clean the blades and foil it takes 30 minutes  4) you need to keep going over the area again and again to get a close shave  5) while the upper lip and chin are smoother than they have ever been, somehow I look much darker after I have started shaving with an electric shaver.  6) If you decide to skip shaving for even one day then the next day when you shave is an extremely painful and lengthier experience - electric shavers are not meant for people who do not shave daily  Nothing against Panasonic - this review is meant for electric shavers in general</li>
    <li> This is the third Panasonic razor I have owned in the last 30 or so years and it is by far, the fastest and closest shave I have ever had--something to look forword to in the morning (at 70 years of age).  Prior to Panasonic razors, I used Schick, Norelco and Braun, all of which were just something to use to get the job over with--never did like safety razor, I bled too much.  Also like the way it holds its charge.</li>
    <li> This razor works great.  It takes just under 3 minutes to get a great close shave.  The sideburn trimmer works just fine.  The charge lasts about 2 weeks and cleanialso just fing is easy and not having the cleaning system is great.... IT&#x27;S JUST A SHAVER!!!  Very happy with purchase.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve just used it once so far and I am impressed! I&#x27;ll let my skin get used to it and once it does, I should never look back.&lt;br /&gt;Being made in Japan is also a huge plus - it feels extremely solid and reliable!</li>
    <li> 85刀特价入手，很好用，4刀头，刮的也干净，有超声波清洗，支持全身水洗，电池大概可用10天。&lt;br /&gt;Purchased at promo price $85. Pannasonic shaver is nice and useful. The package is simple. And support 110/220V worldwide.</li>
    <li> This shaver lives up to all of its positive reviews and fulfilled all my expectations. Clean and smooth shave that&#x27;s extremely close to the skin. I have pretty sensitive skin and this product works great.</li>
    <li> this is for my boss,he likes it</li>
    <li> Before I give father bought a, really great! This is activity, and bought a super high cost performance. Going to buy a bleum try next time</li>
    <li> Not a bad razor, but did not shave me any closer then any of my other electric razors. Also, I found it a little uncomfortable in my hand. I returned it.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my 92 yr. old father who is blind and can no long use a razor. We tried many brand and this one is the best</li>
    <li> New in box so I assumed the battery at least had some charge but it was at 0. Plugged it in too recharge. Has been charging for three days and still on 0. Will not even function more than a few seconds of shaving even with the razor still connected to AC power. It is broke out of the box.</li>
    <li> Have had this for awhile I&#x27;m guessing going about a year and a half now soon. I have to say it was hard at first switching from those popular brand name blades to a electiric kind. At first it was rough and my very sensitive skin was not happy. It felt awful after every shave. I didn&#x27;t give up as I&#x27;ve read &amp; been told you need time to adjust to such a difference. So I gave it time and am happy to say I got used to it not to long after the switch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shaver still works great and I took my time reading countless reviews on Amazon and many other places included all those mens ratings online. I will pay for a quality product but didn&#x27;t want to over pay either. This item was being sold for a good amount lower at the time then what it was first advertised. So at the lower price I took the plunged at the still high price for just a shaver. I will honestly say it&#x27;s worth the money and I&#x27;m sure the price should be lower by now as time goes on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I mostly use the shaver dry but have used it wet with shaving cream but I just don&#x27;t seem to like it wet. From going to a blade with shaving cream/gel to dry you would think I would want to use it with the wet function of it but I don&#x27;t. I will say clean up is very easy as I just run it through water and it gets clean fast. That was a big reason why I wanted a wet &amp; dry shaver as it&#x27;s just so much easier to clean. It still works great and I highly recommend this shaver &amp; brand. It charges very fast too! It also keeps the charge for a long time. That was another big selling point for me as I don&#x27;t like those 12 hours charging times for only 1 hour use. Who would be crazy enough to deal with that?</li>
    <li> This shaver is very gentle on my skin, gives a close shave and works well on hard to reach areas. I&#x27;m very satisfied with it. I do&#x27;nt know how good other shavers are, but I&#x27;m happy with this one.</li>
    <li> Is not a self-cleaning shaver. May have a high consumer reports score but it does no better than the shavers that are half price or ones that have a self cleaning system</li>
    <li> I have been with Remington for years and decided to switch to Panasonic for a try. This one just impressed me and you will never regret. Just wonder where can buy the cleaning solution.</li>
    <li> Great shaver, but the trimmer is a bit small. I have owned several Braun shavers. The last one was of poor quality, the trimmer mechanism broke almost immediately and the cleaning module was a PITA, expensive refills etc. The Panasonic gives a superior shave and cleaning it simply calls for putting detergent on the shaver head, running the shaver and rinsing under the faucet. I bought the unit for $100 which was much cheaper for a superior product.I am quite happy that I switched.</li>
    <li> Works great dry and even better wet.  Usually if you wait a day or two between shavesyou need to use a manual razor and shaving creme.  With this razor you still need the creme but you can use the electric.  It&#x27;s alittle noisy, other than that it,s great.</li>
    <li> I bought this Panasonic shaver more than a year ago. It is not right to immediately put a review after a few days of shaving, so I wanted to wait and really test it.  Well, over a year and this shaver works like a charm.  It does not shave as close as razer, but it is as close as you can get using an electric shaver.  And I have had a few of those and basically all the others were disappointment.&lt;br /&gt;The shave is very close; you would see the remaining charge on the battery; cut the story short, it is well worth every penny.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using electric shaver for 15 years now, I&#x27;ve tried Braun, Philips and some other Chinese brands, actually I was not considering Panasonic I really regret it now. With my older Braun shaver it took me around 10 minutes to finish and the previous philips is not better. Now with this great panasonic shaver it takes around three minutes, the lower neck area is still hard, but easier than the others. I&#x27;ve been using it for around 2 months now and I cannot be more satisfied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried the wet shaving and it did a great job but I think dry shaving is better maybe because this is the first shaver I use which can be used with shaving gel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing is base to hold it, the trimmer is small but I don&#x27;t care about it since I don&#x27;t use it at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conclusion: Great product, this is the best shaver I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
    <li> One of the bestshavor i ever had good good......fast and easy to use I had 2 blade before this one. Is much better</li>
    <li> I bought this Panasonic electric shaver in hopes of a close shaver that was similar to the XXXXXX brand electric razors. I really disliked using the 4 blade or 5 blade branded razors as I felt I could only use them 5-6 days before they became dull. These disposables were not only bad for the environment but really started to wear on my skin. I feel that I have to shave each day because of gaps in my beard. Enter the Panasonic device.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received it last week and immediately put it use. I used some gel shaving cream the first time and was amazed at how quickly and effortlessly the shave was.  Not only was the shave as good as the 4/5 blade overpriced disposables but no razor bumps. No more red neck for me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very pleased with my purchase. Panasonic, you just gained yourself a long term customer.</li>
    <li> I know it sounds crazy. Although I cannot use an electric razor due to my sensitive skin and I break out. I actually bought this for my wife so she can use it on her legs etc.. She is very happy with it. I bought it because I read about some women&#x27;s electric razors and how they did not have the long charge and also the rpm speed was not high enough and would mostly yank the hair out etc. I read on a few that they actually went out and bought mens razors. So I basically just skipped that and went here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros&lt;br /&gt;Price vs other razors of the same caliber&lt;br /&gt;Dry or wet shaving&lt;br /&gt;Easy to clean&lt;br /&gt;Fast charging&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;None so far</li>
    <li> Average shave. Nothing special. I had expected more in terms of its shaving closeness, I do like the ability to wash it with water.</li>
    <li> I satisfied this. I convenient because of this shaver. so good electric shaver for me. I use this every morning.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t like any electric shaver. I was forced to get one as a result of a medical procedure. I will admit that this shaver works well and gives a good decent &amp; fast shave. Not the same as a razor but OK.</li>
    <li> The Panasonic ES-LA63-S Arc 4 shaves about as close as any of the razors I&#x27;ve had over the years and WAY better than an electric I had years ago. It works great wet or dry, but definitely a little better with shaving cream/gel. Good ergonomics. Fairly good battery life and charges pretty quickly. For me, each shave uses up about 10 -  15% of the charge. I only shave once every 3 days or so because of sheer laziness, so it does take a little longer each shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first couple of times were kind of rough. Maybe my skin was too sensitive, but I had several cuts each time. The owner&#x27;s manual did warn that it was a possibility because your skin usually needs a bit of time to adjust. I&#x27;m glad I actually read that part of the literature and didn&#x27;t just send it back. Since the 3rd shave, not a single problem. Keep that in mind if you decide to buy this (or any other, I guess).</li>
    <li> I was not sure how to rate this shaver having never used one before. Other review seem to be true the battery life is not that long but does not seem like much of a hassle to me to charge it. Having never been able to shave on a consistent basis due to raver burn I have been using for three weeks straight and skin feels fantastic although it does not get near as clean as straight razor but seems like a good compromise considering I was shaving once a week.</li>
    <li> Pros&lt;br /&gt;Very close and quick shave&lt;br /&gt;Relatively quiet&lt;br /&gt;Long battery life&lt;br /&gt;Cons&lt;br /&gt;No corded operation&lt;br /&gt;Very big head can be made 25% smaller without affecting cutting surfaces&lt;br /&gt;Trimmer not very useful</li>
    <li> I was really nervous shopping for shavers because it seemed like every shaver had people who loved it and hated it.  I finally decided on the Arc-4 from Panasonic and I couldn&#x27;t be happier.  I had an old norelco rotary shaver and I was worried that switching to the foil system would irritate my skin, but I have had no problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used the shaver now for about three weeks.  I was able to go about 10-12 shaves before I had to charge it.  It definitely shaves closer than my old norelco.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did pick this model over the cheaper arc4 because of the &amp;#34;multi flex head&amp;#34; but honestly I locked it into position after the third or fourth shave and haven&#x27;t used that feature since.  You probably could save a few bucks by skipping this pricier model and getting the cheaper arc4</li>
    <li> The BEST thing I use in a daily basis. You can use it wet or dry. I wish I could of known about this electric razor a long time ago. Before I was using a regular razor I would get razor cuts &amp; skin irritation. Not no more thanks to Panasonic Electric Razor 👍👍👍</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this for about a year and a half, and use this to shave my head, not my face. I use it every morning, and it works fine. It gives me a close shave. Not as close as a blade, but this doesn&#x27;t cut my head up either. I charge it about every 2 or 3 weeks. The LCD display has recently started going wonky and is pretty much useless at this point for anything except for battery level, but that&#x27;s fine as I never used the display much anyway.</li>
    <li> Shaves close. A little louder than some others, but does a great job. Clean up is quick and easy. Good weight and feel. Holds a long charge, with a very quick recharge. Best razor I have owned.</li>
    <li> I was really impressed when I first purchased this shaver after being a Norelco user since I first began shaving back in the early 1970s. It gave a very close shave. I liked that it could shave using water and shaving cream. I also liked that it monitored the charge and that recharging was done quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, within six months the shave became more inconsistent and there were places, particularly on my neck, that I had to shave three to four times before it was totally clean. Within a year, more trouble spots occurred that I started using my son&#x27;s razor when going to an important event. I&#x27;ve had the shaver about 18 months and its clear that it needs new blades. However, the cost to replace the blades is more than buying a new low-end Panasonic or Norelco shaver. Even my Norelco blades lasted longer. Would probably get a cheaper model next time that doesn&#x27;t cost as much to replace the blades.</li>
    <li> Shaver works, but it takes several strokes to properly shaves. Its acceptable, though.  I guess I should have spent more money for a higher performing shaver.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always heard of an electric razor that can shave as close as a blade, but I&#x27;ve never achieved such a result until I bought this razor. Very close, comfortable, even shave. I highly recommend this razor.</li>
    <li> Beautiful appearance, body wash is very convenient, very comfortable when shaving, cutter head fit the face, with the face contour turning, good design, shaved very clean. Very satisfactory</li>
    <li> This shaver gives the most comfortable and close shaves that I have ever gotten with an electric. Since I have sensitive skin, I have used a Norelco Nivea Shaver for years. When I checked out replacement blades for the Norelco last month, I found that the price had more than doubled to OVER $100, just for blades! The Nivea lotion cartridges that it used have always been pricey as well (about $30 for a 3-pack which lasts about 2 1/2 months).&lt;br /&gt;  So, I thought for over $100, I may as well get a new shaver. After a LOT of research, I had read nothing but stellar comments on this Panasonic. So I decided to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;  Pre-shave lotion: I have never liked the smell of &#x27;Lectric Pre-shave lotion&#x27;, so I decided to try the Rite-Aid equivalent (Renewal for about $3). It does not have an overpowering smell that clashes with my after shave lotion. Using this first, the Panasonic glides over my skin, and gives an extremely close and comfortable shave! I have not had a smoother, closer shave since I switched from a blade over a decade ago! The Panasonic leaves NO red-skin or irritation on my face or neck! I&#x27;ve been using for about 3 or 4 weeks now, and am VERY pleased with it.&lt;br /&gt;  A couple of days ago, the display showed the icon that indicates it needs cleaning. Once again, the Panasonic has a very simple AND economic method for cleaning. Just squirt a little liquid hand soap on the top, run it in Turbo mode for about 30 seconds, then remove the foil and rinse it out with water. Simple and economical!&lt;br /&gt;  The bottom line:  I am very pleased with this shaver. Comfortable, CLOSE shaves, easy maintenance. I would buy it again in a heartbeat!!</li>
    <li> I gave this 5 stars due to the fact I had little redness on my face after shaving.  A lot of other products, when I tried to get a clean shave, would leave my face red and especially certain areas.  I read on consumesearch.org that this one was supposed to be especially good for those people with sensitive skin and they were definitely right.  I have only just begun to use this product so far but it is very, very promising.  The trimmer also works very well.  It takes little time to charge up which is nice.  I know some people have a problem with not being able to use it while plugged in but at least the it charges quickly.  So far, if you have sensitive skin, I would recommend this product.  If that changes, I will update my review but so far so good.</li>
    <li> I have not bought an electric shaver for more than 15 years and bought this Panasonic after reading the reviews on Amazon. I was sceptical about this &amp;#34;new breed&amp;#34; of shavers, but it is the best I have owned. The wet shave gives is nearly as close as a blade and it doesn&#x27;t irritate your skin. I am currently in the transition phase from blade to electric. I still have to cleanup a few rogue hairs on my neck with a blade, but all in all happy with the purchase.</li>
    <li> The main thing that attracted me to this shaver was the ability to shave wet or dry.  I do find I shave more dry as it is more convenient but the wet shave with shaving cream gives a closer shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not as close as a blade but as you get used to the shaver the closeness is pretty good.</li>
    <li> Great buy for the money. My hubby loves that the charge lasts days and he can now shave in the shower !!</li>
    <li> My husband has not used an electric shaver in about 30 years, he loved it.&lt;br /&gt;It is so easy to use.</li>
    <li> I have always had a hard time shaving due to thick beard that grows quickly for me.  I have always used an electric shaver with 2 blades or a 2 or 3 blade manual razor.  My last electric shaver was a Panasonic ES8103S which worked to remove most of my facial hair after 2 passes, but it took 5 minutes or more sometimes and I always had to use manual shaver too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Panasonic ES-LA63-S is a sharper and faster electric shaver than I&#x27;ve tried ever before.  The face of the shaver is twice as wide as I&#x27;ve used before and is a bit awkward to use, but I&#x27;ve gotten used to it now.  Around my adam&#x27;s apple &amp; the joint why jaw bone is below my ear don&#x27;t shave very well, but that&#x27;s the case for most electric shavers I&#x27;ve tried.  I use this shaver perpendicular on my mustache area and not vertically which seems to help.  Otherwise my mustache area cuts me above my lips a lot.  The shaver cut my skin all over for the first few times, but it went away with time and it doesn&#x27;t cut me at all now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have to clean the shaver by taking of the head of the shaver and wiping the hair out of the blades with a stiff brush every 3-4 days otherwise it won&#x27;t cut.  But, I&#x27;ve had to do that with every other electric shaver too.  I have to clean the shaver sooner than other shavers, but it has faster moving blades and seems to remove more hair than other shavers.  I sometimes have to do 2 passes with the new shaver, but not every day.  It shaves faster than other shavers &amp; is fastest one I&#x27;ve ever used.  I gave it 4 stars, because it&#x27;s not perfect, but it&#x27;s very good &amp; removes all my hair with thorough use.  I&#x27;m satisfied.  I was going to get the braun series 7 shaver with the vibration feature, but it seems too hard to clean.</li>
    <li> When the music fades&lt;br /&gt;And all is stripped away&lt;br /&gt;And I simply come&lt;br /&gt;Longing just to bring&lt;br /&gt;Something that’s of worth&lt;br /&gt;That will bless your heart&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I’ll bring You more than a song&lt;br /&gt;For a song in itself&lt;br /&gt;Is not what You have required&lt;br /&gt;You search much deeper within&lt;br /&gt;Through the ways things appear&lt;br /&gt;You’re looking into my heart</li>
    <li> Fast smooth and non irritating shave. Not as loud as my older version Panasonic. Takes a little time to get used to the size especially shaving around your nose area, you just have to get the right angle.</li>
    <li> Love it It gives a great shave.  Wish it was a bit smaller, making it easier to put in my travel case</li>
    <li> I had not used an electric shaver for many years, so perhaps I expected too much.  The superlative reviews convinced me it was worth trying, though I do not think I would have purchased it had I a chance to try it first.  Essentially it is like most electric shavers--a convenience item.  To get a clean shave it is still necessary to use the regular shaving cream and a sharp manual razor.  You will not get it with an electric shave.  Certainly it is not worth the list price, but for less than an hundred it could be considered.&lt;br /&gt;It takes a lot of passes over one&#x27;s face to get an acceptable shave.  It does not hurt or pull, and increasing pressure has no effect.</li>
    <li> Best electric shaver I have ever used. I used Norelco for 50 years, but was not really happy with last one. Decided to try this Panasonic and am glad I did.</li>
    <li> This is a great razor very smooth and easy to use. The battery life really holds on and I like the flex head as well.</li>
    <li> My strategy is simple, wait until Panasonic comes out with new models and buy the old model.  So while they are up to 5 blade systems, this was my upgrade from 3 to 4.  And wow, this gives a really close shave.  I&#x27;v just replaced the blades on my 3 blade Panasonic shaver and this one blows that one away.  So by all means you can spend $299 on the latest shaver or stay one model behind.  I&#x27;m sure the 5 blade system is great but for the money you can&#x27;t go wrong with this one. By the way, no cleaning system on this one.  Hardly even used it on the last one so just hold the button in, and run under water with a little liquid soap.</li>
    <li> My first electric razor in years since my last. Not disappointed. Performs as expected. An extremely close and smooth shaving result from this unit. Only gripe for me is that the on/off switch is often pushed while shaving. A small annoyance.</li>
    <li> Best electric shaver made.  My father had one and after i tried it once - I had to buy one too.  It&#x27;s not cheap - but well worth the money...</li>
    <li> This is the best shaver I have ever owned.  It surpassed my expecations when I replaced my Braun.  Amazing shave</li>
    <li> Great shave. Very pleased with closeness of the shave. The battery indicator is big enough to read and works well.</li>
    <li> Nearly the sane as my fusion razor! The noise is a bit loud but ok. Much convenient for daily use.</li>
    <li> The Panasonic ES8243A was my best razon until I got this one. I had it about a year and a half and then saw this razon on sale for  slightly more than it would have cost me to replace the blades and foil...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I figured why not and grabbed this. The 1st shave was a lot closer and my wife noticed immediately, it&#x27;s bigger, the head rotates more, it rotates faster and you can tell just by the louder hum it is stronger. I wonder what the five blade will be like, that may be my next one. :)</li>
    <li> My first shaver upgrade in about 5 years.  This gives me a close shave, is the easiest electric razor that I have cleaned thus far, and performs well.  Prior to this, I have used round-blade shavers, and I am now a convert to this style of shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It seems loud when I have to get up very early in the morning, but generally does not seem to be a problem if I get up at a decent hour.</li>
    <li> Does a terrible job on neck area.</li>
    <li> I really like the Panasonic shavers. My first one was a Brown which was also great but not water proof. Then I got a Panasonic which broke after many years. I then started using my backup Panasonic shaver and bought this one as a new backup. Now I mostly just use this shaver and use my other Panasonic as a backup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hardly use it under the shower as the cleanest shave is after you take a shower and the skin/hair is dry. However, because the shaver is waterproof you can simply put some soap between the head and blades and run it under flowing water. That gives it a good cleaning avoiding the VERY costly self-cleaning units. If you need to ultimate cleaning than add some alcohol to it.</li>
    <li> I like a clean shave daily so I bought this foil razor, hoping for faster shaves and some monetary savings in the long run. Huge disappointment. I never used it dry, but even wet it takes at least three times longer than a disposable. The quality of the shave itself is terrible. Even shaving every day, it snags my hairs as often as it cuts them. I am forced to use a disposable to &amp;#34;clean up&amp;#34; what this razor leaves behind. Icing on the cake? After a single shave (~15 minutes), the battery is at 60%.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a week of earnest attempts, my face is entirely butchered. I understand my hair is thicker than most peoples&#x27;, but this is still pretty ridiculous. 1/5 stars for anyone capable of growing an actual beard.</li>
    <li> does a great job  close to a blade if you use it daily  dry or wet</li>
    <li> In my forties now, I&#x27;ve never used an electric razor before this month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This year, I started shaving my head, and I went through a few different razors and all caused problems (bumpy head).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, decided to try an electric razor and this one was recommended on a few sites as a decent head shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it in the shower and after a week of use, seems to live up to its waterproof claim.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also shaves surprisingly smooth.  Shockingly smooth in fact.  The razor is behind a metal grid, so how is it possible that it shaves so smooth?  the marketing material has some mumbo jumbo about how the mechanism pulls up hairs to make the cut which allows for a smooth shave, but it also sounds like magic to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re like me and on a razor, but wondering what an electric is like, this is a pretty good one to start with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s durable&lt;br /&gt;Battery runs for a good 40 minutes or so&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s waterproof&lt;br /&gt;It charges fast&lt;br /&gt;Shaves real smooth&lt;br /&gt;Is easy to clean and maintain (get spare blades now, might as well)&lt;br /&gt;Has a travel pouch to help protect it some.&lt;br /&gt;Battery indicator is pretty useful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since this is the only one I&#x27;ve ever used, I&#x27;m probably not the best judge of how good this is compared to others, but it&#x27;s hard to imagine being disappointed with something this effective.</li>
    <li> Very good shave and saves your skin also.  Battery last two weeks between charges.  Easy to use on both face and neck.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used a Panasonic for 13 years with the same blades. The battery still holds a great charge. So when I figured it was a good time to get a new one, I opted for this. Great shave. Quiet, and I charge this once a week. It shows charge level which is nice. The extra blade makes the head a little bigger and a little more efficient but I&#x27;m Glad I didn&#x27;t go to the 5 blades version.</li>
    <li> Have used this for about a month now and I really like it. My girlfriend appreciates that it gives a much closer shave than the Norelco it replaced. Shave time is quick too.</li>
    <li> Rather pricey , so won;t be able to assess the value for a few years.. Working fine new. a soft zippered case holds only the razor, not the charging cord.</li>
    <li> I like the shaver very much and I am using it in the shower, ok so far. Have use it awhile before you learn how to use it on your type of</li>
    <li> seeing i never in my nursing career shaved did not get a clean shave do better with regular razor sorry</li>
    <li> Item arrived on time as promised, works great wet or dry!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been a Norelco user for the past 25 years and like the shave; however, the newer shaver line has a head that pops off while shaving.  I figured maybe it was the first of the line, so I purchased a new one about 2 years later ... same issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I then did some research and came across the Panasonic.  This razor is fast and comfortable and gives a nice, close shave.  The head pivots in all directions and the straight edge pop-out blade is great.  Strongly recommend this unit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did look at some of the other units, but none of the &amp;#34;additional features or options&amp;#34; justified an $80 - $120 jump in price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only drawback is that it is a bit loud.</li>
    <li> did not work well and was not giving a good shave.. returned it and got a full refund as promised..</li>
    <li> Not as smooth as I would prefer.Does not cut beard with ease. Tried many razors.  This one is ok. Thanks</li>
    <li> TL;DR: A great electric razor. I recommend to buy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I came from a Braun 7 series. I decided against another Braun because the company was purchased by Procter and Gamble and the replacement foils I purchased were of terrible quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I came across this electric razor after reading countless reviews. I like in line razors instead of three round head razors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let&#x27;s start with Pros and Cons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Great foil and close cut.&lt;br /&gt;Great Dry shave. Better than my Braun&lt;br /&gt;Fast charging. 5 minute charge will give you 10 minute shave if in a bind.&lt;br /&gt;Nice design and small as well as light.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;A bit loud. Not as loud as my old Braun but loud&lt;br /&gt;Can&#x27;t shave while charging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My first week of shaves. The shave is quick and cuts very close. My skin is not pulled and I don&#x27;t use shaving cream or the like. I would like to get some Kiss My Face shaving gel to try out and see how that treats my skin as well. The shave gets the areas in one motion with little need to go over an area twice. I grow a pretty fast beard and even after a weekend of no shaving this cuts right through.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good shaver and I would recommend.</li>
    <li> We gave this item as a Christmas gift only three months ago.  Already, the rechargeable batteries have stopped holding a charge.</li>
    <li> BEEN THINKING ABOUT REPLACING MY OL&#x27; PHILLIPS NORELCO AFTER TEN YEARS OF SERVICE.  READING OTHER ONLINE REVIEWS OF THIS PRODUCT AND DECIDED TO GET ONE.  PRIME SERVICE DELIVERY HAD IT HERE IN NO TIME.  CHARGED IT UP, WHILE ALLOWING MY STUBLE TO GROW JUST A TAD BIT LONGER.  TURNED IT ON AND WENT TO TOWN.  WOW!!! WHAT A SMOOTH AND CLOSE SHAVE.  I KEPT FEELING WHERE THE STUBBLE USED TO BE AND THERE WASN&#x27;T ANYTHING THERE.  YOU GOT TO TRY IT.  SIMPLY AMAZING!!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s been awhile since I have used an electric. The last two I had were both Norelco with rotary heads, so this is my first foil shaver. So far, so good. I have shaved twice using the Kiss My Face cream and warm water and I&#x27;m getting a very close shave with no post-shave irritation. The shaver charges completely in an hour, so hard to beat that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Both shaves have been with 2 days growth, sometimes you get a better shave when the beard is longer.  Whenever I shave next with just one day, I&#x27;ll report if any degradation.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t want to invest over one hundred dollars on a razor. Now I am glad that I did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recently got injured and a normal blade shave would take me a long time and cause serious issues in my hand and shoulder. Now I can use this quickly and get a shave just as close without all the hassle in a fraction of the time.</li>
    <li> Worse purchase I ever made.  Does not shave wet or dry.&lt;br /&gt;Irritated my face for the weeks it tried to get use to it, my doctor told me to stop using it.&lt;br /&gt;Went back to my 10 years old rotary razor which does a better job.&lt;br /&gt;Appears to have four blades and really has only two.  I can&#x27;t believe the 5 star reports.</li>
    <li> I use this razor dry. I find that it does a good job if I press hard on the neck area. and the trimmer works well.  It was on the higher price side, but if it lasts it will have been a good investment.</li>
    <li> I am a 63 year old woman and I had tried every possible way to get rid of hair. I was really tired of using regular razors (every day!). I had bought various women&#x27;s electric shavers over the years, and got terrible results. I tried waxing and it was extremely messy and  expensive. I tried an expensive gadget I bought from an infomercial (called No!No!), and it was total junk (I returned it). It cost over $200 and is worthless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this shaver! I&#x27;m glad I decided to go with the men&#x27;s version this time. It is well worth the extra cost. The floating head is great so it works well for underarms, bikini area, anywhere! The instructions say not to expect the best results in the first 30 days since your skin needs time to adjust, but I haven&#x27;t used it for a week yet and the results are perfect. I love it, and highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> Unless you wish to shave for about 15 minutes and still get a poor shave stay away from this Panasonic shaver.  I gave it my best shot for three months and it does not shave close and misses many whiskers.  I haven&#x27;t had a good shaver since my Payer died.</li>
    <li> While long hairs may still take a bit of extra effort, this shaver has been my best all around experience to date. My results are close enough with little to no skin irritation. The simplicity of cleaning with some liquid soap and water is wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used a Braun single foil shaver since the 1980&#x27;s and have also tried Philips rotary shavers. The Braun did a great job on the short hairs and got very close, but long hairs were next to impossible without using a separate trimmer. The Philips did a better job of the long hairs, but yielded much more skin irritation. This Panasonic ES-LA63-S has been a pleasant update experience.</li>
    <li> This is my second electric shaver in 45 years.  So it has been 45 years since I last used one.  This shaver seems to do about as well as I would expect any electric shaver to do.  Much better than my Remington did 45 years ago.  I got it for a fast shave when I am in a hurry.  I have been using only it for two weeks now, but I still think I can get a closer shave with a razor and a cup of shave soap (although not by much).  I can get in around my nose better with the razor.  My beard is continuous from my lip into my nose. Most people will not have that issue.  Sure works a lot better than they use to.  No discomfort or irritation at all.  Even the first time out of the box.  Take 5 minutes for a clean shave.  Can get 10 shaves before recharging.</li>
    <li> Bought as a gift for my husband.  He loves it, although he says the beard trimmer is weak/borderline useless.</li>
    <li> My son loves this razor. Seems to cause less skin irritation after shaving.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never been an electric shaver fan, but happy I purchased this.  I can now shave very quickly and I haven&#x27;t had a cut in a long time!  I plug this in before a trip and it can easily last about two weeks of daily shaving for me.</li>
    <li> a gift for,he like it very muuuuuuuuuuuuuch!!!!!!!!!&lt;br /&gt;I thank I will buy it again,for myself!&lt;br /&gt;real good items!&lt;br /&gt;amazing!&lt;br /&gt;wow</li>
    <li> This is by far the best electric shaver I have owned. It gives a pretty close shave for an electric shaver. No electric shaver will ever compare to an actual razor. This one works great for me. My only issue with it is it runs kind of loud. Other than that I love it.</li>
    <li> ****October &#x27;15 Update****** Do NOT Buy *******&lt;br /&gt;The shaver sputtered and died within 3 months. A nasty shock for me, but quite convenient for Amazon as their return policy is only for 1 month. If you are considering this, or for that matter, any other Panasonic shaver, do keep this fact in cognizance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shaves are close on the face. However, with this razor, shaving on the neck is a close shave with daily bleeding from scrapes and nicks. Do want to give it a month as the cuts are not deep, and the skin is regenerative with pain lasting only a hour after shaving. Though that made me take of couple of stars off its otherwise stellar handling.</li>
    <li> I was really happy with the 8103.  Used it consistently for about 2 years.  Recently upgraded to this bad boy.  I must say, the added RPM&#x27;s really cut down my shaving time AND gives me a much closer shave than the 8103.  Would highly recommend this model for anyone with sensitive skin.  Very happy customer!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m coming from an [[ASIN:B001DNE3KQ ES8103S]], and was hoping for this to be an upgrade.  Unfortunately, it isn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The good:&lt;br /&gt;- Quick and easy to clean&lt;br /&gt;- Quieter than the ES8103S (though not by too much)&lt;br /&gt;- Nice grip&lt;br /&gt;- Rotating head (though it&#x27;s a minor difference for me)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bad:&lt;br /&gt;- Unless hair is only 1-2 days grown max, it requires several pass overs, often pressing quite hard&lt;br /&gt;- No noticeable improvement in shave speed or quality over ES8103S&lt;br /&gt;- Possibly worse, and certainly not better, trimmer than ES8103S&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s about it.  The shaver itself isn&#x27;t terrible, but I purchased it solely to upgrade my ES8103S, and aside from being really easy to clean (just pop the top off, turn it on, and move under the facet for like 15 seconds, and presto, clean), it isn&#x27;t really an upgrade.  I&#x27;ve been using this for several months now, and I still believe it takes longer to shave with this shaver, and the results are no better than before.  A disappointing 3/5 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m no expert on shavers, but I just feel like there&#x27;s got to be a more effective shaver out there that&#x27;s at least somewhat similar in price.</li>
    <li> The last 3 have been gifts to our family members for the holidays, and they all likes it a lot.&lt;br /&gt;Finally got one for myself!</li>
    <li> Shaves smooth and clean and doesn&#x27;t burn your face when on too long , not like the braun 5 I used to have it burns</li>
    <li> WOW is what i am going to tell you. I have over the past 50 years used Norelco razors.  I could never get a good clean shave. I would buy new blades but still no success. A friend of mine told me about the Panasonic ES-LA63-s Arc4 razor.  It is the first time I have a good clean shave in all the years.  The grip fits nicely in either hand. This razor has a high speed motor.  It has a turbo cleaning system.  Its the easiest razor to clean. This razor can be fully charged in an hour.  This would be a great graduation, birthday, or Christmas gift any man.</li>
    <li> This thing has a ton of reviews so let me just add my notes.  It is good and worth your money.  I had a Braun pulsonic before this, the 9000 series.  That thing was LOUD; literally hurt my ears every day for years.  Well it finally died and I went to this and first thing I noticed was how quiet it is.  Now it has no cleaning station and I thought I would miss that but you know what - the sonic mode and soapy water method of cleaning that this shaver has works perfectly fine.  And the shave, well it is good too.  On par with the braun and maybe better.  It is nice this can be used with water and shaving cream.  Doing so I think gives a slightly better shave but not so much that it&#x27;s worth doing every time.</li>
    <li> I actually prefer the dry shave with this shaver it is easy to use and clean. As well i have no issues with the charger.</li>
    <li> Great shaver, but shavings fall out through the grating when turned horizontal or upside down. Always leaves shavings on my neck and collar.</li>
    <li> My husband is very happy with his razor.  He enjoys a close shave and it is easy to clean.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband. He loves it! He shaves with it almost daily and hasn&#x27;t had the noticeable skin irritation that he had with other electric shavers (even after he used them for a while). The shaver gives a nice, close shave, and is reasonably quick. He uses it primarily as a dry shaver. No problems with the battery after ~3.5mo.</li>
    <li> I have used a handful of low and high end rotary razors for the last 10 years, embroiled in skin irritation and frustration.  They left me wondering if I just had bad skin or if I was bad at shaving.  As a man, thinking that you may be bad at shaving is a low blow.  So I decided to give up shaving for a year, until accepting the need to look a little more presentable, so I bought this razor.    I can now get a wet shave in 3 minutes without irritation or clogging up the razor.  What wizardry is this?  I have to use a lot of shaving cream (enough so that passing the razor over my skin still leaves behind shaving cream), but this razor can handle that no problem.  And the enormous shaving surface gets the job done quickly.  I have curly facial hair, so it doesn&#x27;t get every single hair, but I just use the beard trimmer on those few stragglers.    5 gold stars.    Update: 8 months later:  Still love this thing.  I wet shave with barbasol cream in 60-90 seconds and have no problems with irritation!  Still works quickly, cleans well, and holds its charge.  I still use a beard trimmer to cut the tough-to-get hairs to avoid irritation.</li>
    <li> This replaces my Panasonic ES-8243, which is still very good. (Blades were wearing out, and I decided to try the new shaver just for the fun of it.) The LA63 does give a very close shave, but it has an even wider head than the 8243, and feels a bit bulky. It also retains the somewhat awkward flip-up trimmer on the back side. That&#x27;s one aspect that Brauns do better, but overall the Panasonics give a better shave and are easier to live with.  All of the better performing Brauns come with the silly cleaning system, which wastes money and counter space. With the LA63 (or the 8243) it takes all of 20 seconds to run it in some warm soapy water in the sink, and then it is perfectly clean.</li>
    <li> This is a joy to use for shaving.  It works very well!  I used to never shave on the weekends because it was a chore, but with this shaver, it&#x27;s quick and close, and I find myself wanting to shave on weekends, go figure!  The head pivots up and down AND side to side to confirm to the shape of your face as you shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Feels well built and comfortable to hold in my hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve stuck the shaver head under running water to rinse it and it works fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At first my wife commented that this is an &amp;#34;ugly and bulky&amp;#34; shaver, but I don&#x27;t really think so, looks good to me.  The difference in size is because she was used to seeing me use a dual foil shaver, which tend to be more compact.  Can&#x27;t really compare since this has more cutting surface....difference between men and women tastes in design, I guess.</li>
    <li> Sure the battery runs down quicker than most but it also charges super fast, so I don&#x27;t mind. Besides, a full charge lasts over a week with daily shaving. I have never used anything other than rotary head shavers for the past  30 years; this thing blows them all away (sorry Norelco, but it&#x27;s true)!!  I even shave my head with it when I&#x27;m on travel. Glorious.</li>
    <li> It does the job very nicely.  It doesn&#x27;t hurt or pull.  You can clean it in the sink and use it in the shower.  A charge lasts a long time.  What more could you ask for?  Of all the electric shavers I&#x27;ve owned, this is my favorite.  I&#x27;d buy it again in a heartbeat.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great at cutting hair. I&#x27;m always done in less than three minutes, so only recharge every 10 days or so. It&#x27;s easy to clean with water alone.</li>
    <li> I used an older Panasonic model and this is a nice improvement. After eight years the old one needed to retire.</li>
    <li> Was looking for a good shaver to use in the shower for my head. I like a really close shave on my head, but I also like to get it done quickly. Previous shavers that I&#x27;ve had have taken forever to give me the close shave that I like. This one is no exception. I had to go over the same spot on my head (and face!) to get the kind of shave I wanted, and after I was done I was left with some pretty bad razor burn, despite using the unit in the shower. Would not recommend this unit for anyone who wants a quick, close shave.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product on the recommendtion of a friend.  I have not been disappointed.  It shaves very well, even the hard to shave parts of my neck that my old shaver never got well.  Excellent battery life.  Real easy to clean up!  This is a 5 star product.</li>
    <li> My husband has had this for three plus years now. He is very picky and this electric shaver is just well made. It looks top notch it travels snug in its carrying pouch highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always used Norelco rotary shavers in the past, and have had 4 that are in the $100-$200 range.  This is the first foil shaver and getting a closer and faster shave than ever before.  Read another post about using &amp;#34;kiss my face&amp;#34; shave lotion and shaving wet with that, and getting a shave that I think is actually closer than a blade.  No irritation at all on neck when using wet or dry, and no adjustment time going from old rotary shaver to this one.&lt;br /&gt;To clarify, I&#x27;m a man...wife&#x27;s account...so I&#x27;m referring to shaving face.</li>
    <li> I gave this shaver to my husband for Christmas and he loves it.  He says it works better than any shaver he has had and it shaves wet or dry.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t bought or used an electric shaver in years. They really never worked for me. Even though I have relatively light whisker growth, the shavers I tried were not effective. This shaver is different. I use it every morning (3 minutes) and it does its job. I have only used it as a &amp;#34;dry&amp;#34; shaver not the wet option. Of course, nothing beats a shaving cream razor shave but this comes close. I also like the fact  that there is no charging platform and the shaver is very easy to clean. I don&#x27;t know how this works on heavy whisker growth but for people with similar whisker growth as mine, I would recommend it highly.</li>
    <li> Best electric razor made.</li>
    <li> (UPDATE 11/20/13 - To research complaints about battery drain, I went ahead and did a battery drain test AFTER the display on my shaver showed \\&quot;10%\\&quot; of juice left.  It ran for a FULL 35 minutes beyond this point before conking out.  I think what&#x27;s happening is the display drops in 10% increments after each use, giving users the misleading impression that they&#x27;ve got little charge left especially when they hit the \\&quot;50% left\\&quot; mark.  Based on my \\&quot;battery drain\\&quot; test, this is NOT true.  The battery in this shaver is GREAT, holding a charge that lasts well within the 45 minutes touted on a single charge.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&lt;br /&gt;ORIGINAL REVIEW BELOW.&lt;br /&gt;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Until now, I&#x27;ve always believed electric razors could NEVER come close to beating hand-held blades. But this Panasonic comes very close - so much so that I rarely use a straight blade anymore!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Disclosure:  I do NOT work for Panasonic and I am NOT being compensated in any way for this review.  But this [[ASIN:B002N5MHLU Panasonic ES-LA63-S Arc 4 Mens Electric Shaver]] is pure, unadulterated awesomeness, blowing every competing Norelco and Braun shaver out of the water!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Very few people can afford $300 for this machine.  But when it comes up for sale for under $150, which is often - you should snap it up because it&#x27;s worth EVERY penny - and THEN SOME.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Unlike other electric razors, this Panasonic cuts so close without nicking up your skin that you won&#x27;t believe your eyes and you won&#x27;t believe your fingers when you run them over your face after each shave.  Neck hair will take longer to shave - but NOT too much longer compared to other electric razors.  (And I have coarse dark hair which grows quickly.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* A blue LED light clocks each session.  When you turn it off, it tells you how much battery life is left, i.e., 90%, 80%, 70%, 60%, etc.  You&#x27;ll get about 45 minutes of shaving on a single charge - or about 10 days worth of shaving without reaching for the re-charger.  (BTW, the reason this shaver won&#x27;t work with the cord is common sense!  Who wants to be electrocuted in the shower with the cord attached?)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Cleaning is a breeze.  Just press the buttons on the right and left sides of the head - and the foil framework comes off easily.  Turn your shaver on and hold the power button down for at least two seconds.  Your shaver will go into a \\&quot;cleaning mode\\&quot; whereby its blades will vibrate like mad, providing the cleaning equivalent of jumping to light-speed in a \\&quot;Star Wars\\&quot; movie - without rattling like the Millennium Falcon.  Just run tap water over the blades and all hair cuttings will vibrate off into your bathroom sink.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* I&#x27;ve tried this shaver in both wet and dry modes and its performance is superb.  However, shaving in wet mode with a thin cream such as [[ASIN:B004DU3V2M Kiss My Face Moisture Shave Key Lime Cream]] is supersonic awesome.  (Note, shaving \\&quot;wet\\&quot; makes cleaning easier because you&#x27;ll have less facial oil when you clean the heads after every use.)  Unlike Norelcos with rotary blades which pivot a little, the head on this Panasonic pivots up and down AND side to side, hugging your face in every direction.  It has two (2) motors.  One cuts up and down and the other cuts from side to side.  It&#x27;s great at getting rid of 99 7/8% of my neck hair and the nubs in both corners of my mouth.  (More about that \\&quot;1/8\\&quot; difference later.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* This shaver comes with a travel pouch and a locking switch (to prevent it from going on while traveling) - as well as a blade cover.  It also has a pop-up trimmer for bushy sideburns and mustaches.  The head can even be locked to prevent pivoting while shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Now, about replacement blades.  Do the math.  Panasonic still wins.  If you have to change blades every six-months-to-a-year - well, no offense, but you&#x27;ve got a genetic profile of a werewolf.  Most people with \\&quot;standard\\&quot; beards won&#x27;t have toreplace the blades on this machine for WAY MORE than a year, and I have a tough, coarse beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* The money you&#x27;ll spend for two (2) [[ASIN:B001159UMM Panasonic WES9068PC Men&#x27;s Shaver Replacement Inner Blades]] - is TINY compared to the cost of replacement blades for other electric razors.  This Panasonic takes two (2) replacement blades - which doubles to four blades - because two additional blades are built into the outer foils - which hook into the base of the replacement blades.  Note that the outer foil unit - [[ASIN:B002N5MHLA Panasonic WES9165PC Men&#x27;s Shaver Replacement Foil]] - does cost more to replace, but you won&#x27;t replace it often (unless you break or puncture it) - because the two blades built into them are designed to cut thicker hair.  These blades are comparable to what&#x27;s found on a trimmer for sideburns, but the foils protect you from getting nicked or cut.  (And I don&#x27;t know anyone who&#x27;s ever replaced the bigger blades on a trimmer.)  Don&#x27;t get me wrong.  You WILL change the two-bladed foil unit eventually, but in the long run, you WILL still save money compared to what it costs to buy one 18-multi-blade blister pack locked up in plastic cases in stores.  If you want to save even more money, buy the foil and the two blades TOGETHER - which are available in the [[ASIN:B002N5MHL0 Panasonic WES9025PC Men&#x27;s Shaver Replacement Out Foil and Blade Kit for ES-LA63-S]].  Buying this \\&quot;kit\\&quot; should save you around $20 to $30 than buying these items separately.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* I&#x27;m taking away a \\&quot;half-star\\&quot; (even though fractional-stars aren&#x27;t allowed here) - for one reason.  While this is the BEST electric razor I&#x27;ve ever used - note that in my first paragraph above, I said \\&quot;this Panasonic comes very close\\&quot; to beating a hand-held blade.  After a wet shave (which I recommend over dry if you&#x27;re not in a hurry) - I run my fingers over my cheeks, jaw bone and neck.  They slide like a sled on snow across my face and jaw line - and over 99 7/8% of my neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* But there are always one or two tiny spots on my neck this razor won&#x27;t completely get.  Now, you might ask, \\&quot;well then what&#x27;s the point of buying this [[ASIN:B002N5MHLU Panasonic ES-LA63-S Arc 4 Mens Electric Shaver with Dual Motor and Multi-Flex Pivoting Head]] if it&#x27;s not as good as a blade?\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* This is my response:  Shaving is one of the most aggravating and time consuming chores men face EVERY day.  The type of finish you will get with this [[ASIN:B002N5MHLU Panasonic ES-LA63-S Arc 4 Mens Electric Shaver with Dual Motor and Multi-Flex Pivoting Head]] is EQUAL to using a hand-held blade for, let&#x27;s say, four minutes.  Think about it.  During my hand-held \\&quot;blading\\&quot; days, unless I was headed to a special event - I did NOT spend as much time to get at every cotton-picking nook and cranny on my neck, especially the area below my ears.  I could still FEEL tiny bristles, but I could not SEE them.  When 100% smoothness was required, I spent more time WITH A HAND-HELD BLADE to get at those nooks and crannies anyway.  Hence the \\&quot;touch up\\&quot; conundrum.  Today, I STILL keep a hand-held two-blader nearby if perfection is my goal.  But most of the time, I don&#x27;t bother.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* One last thing.  Don&#x27;t mess with electric shaving kits which come with \\&quot;immersible tubs\\&quot; filled with expensive cleaning solutions.  Panasonic recommends just liquid soap and water to clean the heads.  (After shaving in wet mode, I don&#x27;t even bother with soap.  The residual suds from the [[ASIN:B004DU3V2M Kiss My Face Moisture Shave Key Lime Cream]] and a strong blast of tap water while the heads are in \\&quot;cleaning mode\\&quot; does the job for me.  If I want to clean after shaving dry, I just use a blast of tap water, no soap.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Yes, the $300 price tag is steep and yes, you get what you pay for.  But this Panasonic is almost always on sale for below retail.  For all these reasons, this [[ASIN:B002N5MHLU Panasonic ES-LA63-S Arc 4 Mens Electric Shaver with Dual Motor and Multi-Flex Pivoting Head]] still gets a STRONG four and one-half stars./&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* But there are always one or two tiny spots on my neck this razor won&#x27;t completely get.  Now, you might ask, \\&quot;well then what&#x27;s the point of buying this [[ASIN:B002N5MHLU Panasonic ES-LA63-S Arc 4 Mens Electric Shaver with Dual Motor and Multi-Flex Pivoting Head]] if it&#x27;s not as good as a blade?\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* This is my response:  Shaving is one of the most aggravating and time consuming chores men face EVERY day.  The type of finish you will get with this [[ASIN:B002N5MHLU Panasonic ES-LA63-S Arc 4 Mens Electric Shaver with Dual Motor and Multi-Flex Pivoting Head]] is EQUAL to using a hand-held blade for, let&#x27;s say, four minutes.  Think about it.  During my hand-held \\&quot;blading\\&quot; days, unless I was headed to a special event - I did NOT spend as much time to get at every cotton-picking nook and cranny on my neck, especially the area below my ears.  I could still FEEL tiny bristles, but I could not SEE them.  When 100% smoothness was required, I spent more time WITH A HAND-HELD BLADE to get at those nooks and crannies anyway.  Hence the \\&quot;touch up\\&quot; conundrum.  Today, I STILL keep a hand-held two-blader nearby if perfection is my goal.  But most of the time, I don&#x27;t bother.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* One last thing.  Don&#x27;t mess with electric shaving kits which come with \\&quot;immersible tubs\\&quot; filled with expensive cleaning solutions.  Panasonic recommends just liquid soap and water to clean the heads.  (After shaving in wet mode, I don&#x27;t even bother with soap.  The residual suds from the [[ASIN:B004DU3V2M Kiss My Face Moisture Shave Key Lime Cream]] and a strong blast of tap water while the heads are in \\&quot;cleaning mode\\&quot; does the job for me.  If I want to clean after shaving dry, I just use a blast of tap water, no soap.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Yes, the $300 price tag is steep and yes, you get what you pay for.  But this Panasonic is almost always on sale for below retail.  For all these reasons, this [[ASIN:B002N5MHLU Panasonic ES-LA63-S Arc 4 Mens Electric Shaver with Dual Motor and Multi-Flex Pivoting Head]] still gets a STRONG four and one-half stars.</li>
    <li> It is my first electric shaver. I think I prefer blades. They get a closer shave. With this, it seems I am shaving every day. With a Mach3, I can get away with shaving every other day</li>
    <li> I had used the previous version of this shaver for about 3-4 years, until the battery got to the point that it wasn&#x27;t holding a charge very long, and it needed a whole new foil head again. Rather than buy the parts, I decided to upgrade to this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The previous one I had also included the charging cleaning station. I found that to be more of a pain to use than anything else. The charging station was nice, but I found myself not using the cleaner that often, and not willing to continually purchase the cleaning/filter packs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This one is just the shaver, and I much prefer it. The cleaning station is not worth the extra expense up front or down the line. I simply take a little dish soap and run it through the shaver every couple weeks, and let it dry. Works fine and saves me money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This one does do a better job at cutting my facial hair as well. I have fairly thick and rapid growth, and it cuts smoothly with no snags or pulls. It still requires a couple runs over the same spot to get it all, especially if I don&#x27;t shave for a day or two, but it is not that bad. The end result is very smooth though, and I experience little to no facial irritation, which is something I would have from time to time when using a blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do use Remington pre-shave powder sticks, but not every time. That seems to make a difference as well. I typically shave right after I shower. I have tried it wet, and it does work well that way too, but my eyesight is no longer good enough to shave without the use of glasses. Thus I cannot shave in the shower, and when I use shaving cream outside of the shower I still need glasses to see in the mirror, and end up getting cream on my rims during the process. Thus for me this shaver provides the absolute best dry shaving experience I have ever had.</li>
    <li> Product Very good, price very good, delivery very good.i get the shaver before I leave, the design is good, but this kind of design maybe easy to broken .</li>
    <li> This was a good electric shaver and probably the best in its class but I don&#x27;t like shaving for 5+ minutes to get all the hairs. I returned it and went back to manual.</li>
    <li> Overall a good shaver. It does miss hair if your beard is several days old. I would recommend this razor.</li>
    <li> I replaced my old 8109 with this after many years of solid performance. The way Panasonic tiers their models, this one seems like it&#x27;s the 2nd from the top. It contains one extra cutting foil compared to the next model down so I expected shaving performance to be noticeably improved. It&#x27;s not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It seems to be equally as effective as my old 8109, but not noticeably better. Still, these Panasonic razors are the best I&#x27;ve ever used. And I say that as someone who has had the Braun and Norelco before. This model is fine, but I think you can save a few bucks and go with the next model down without seeing any real difference in performance. Replacement blades and foils might be slightly cheaper too on the lesser models.</li>
    <li> its good,and i really like it. so does my dad ,its really a wise choice to buy this shaver, ,,</li>
    <li> Anyone who wastes another dollar on ANY Norelco shaver will be kicking themselves after purchasing this one. Norelcos are overpriced, terrible for your skin and are usually in the garbage or in for repair within two years. This Panasonic is the BEST shaver Ive owned in 25 years. I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Needed a razor that wouldn&#x27;t cut while I was on a blood thinner. Past experience with electric was not as good as blade. I&#x27;m having much better luck with this wet shave. Still not as good as a blade but getting better with more use. Great for knocking off stubble when in hurry.</li>
    <li> This is the third (may be fourth) Panasonic shaver that i have had as I like to shave whilst showering. My previous shaver was the Panasonic five head shaver and it was an improved shave over the previous models however it stopped charging.&lt;br /&gt;I reviewed the latest shower suitable electric shavers and decided to purchased the cheaper Panasonic four head model. I was pleased with the quality of this shave.&lt;br /&gt;After some months the five head began to charge again. I was then able to compare the quality of the five head and the four head models. I could not determine any difference. Based on this my view would be to go with the cheaper model and maybe chance the blades a little more often however as the blades last around a year this is not a big cost.&lt;br /&gt;With regard to costs - from time to time I have used traditional disposable blade shavers and by, my calculations, the purchase cost of the disposable blades over a two year period is about equal to the purchase cost of the Panasonic with the replacement blades required over that period.&lt;br /&gt;With regard to shave quality - I find that the Panasonic shave is closer and notably less damage to the skin. I use a good quality shaving cream Crabtree and Evelyn - not a foam - which is very cost effective as only a small amount is necessary with a pot lasting up to six months. A foam is not required because the shaving action causes to cream to foam as the shaving progresses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have noted some comments on battery life, or perceived lack of it. I would support the statement that there are about five shaves per charge and that the shaver can not be used whilst connected to a power supply. I seem to recall that older Panasonic versions lasted longer.&lt;br /&gt;I have also observed that all reviewers state that the Panasonic has a closer shave than other brands, even blade shavers and with less skin damage. I have used&lt;br /&gt;other brands and this observation I firmly support.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So the question would seem to bethe purchase criteria priorities - close shave or charge convenience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The answer would seem to be in the discussions on battery charge management.&lt;br /&gt;From the discussions would seem that the answer is to keep the charge maintained as high as possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the premise that removing the beard is the purpose of shaving then it would seem that using the Panasonic and charging it after each shave delivers the best outcome. From the information offered on battery life management it would seem clear that at the least, this does not harm the battery.</li>
    <li> best shave I&#x27;ve ever had from an electric razor.  good battery life.  easy to clean</li>
    <li> Panasonic have won gold in the design and shaving results from this shaver. This is the closest shave Iv had with any electric shaver over many years and is identical ( for me ) to a wet razor shave. I only use it dry and 3 minutes later smooth skin ! Really good. as I shave every day I don&#x27;t know how it would handle a 3 day growth but with patience I guess it would do an excellent job.</li>
    <li> I tried a battery shaver a long time ago it was a waste of money the shave was not close to the skin. I have been using Gillette Mac 3 for the past 6 years I was very happy with it close shave I shave only 2-3 times a week. Now I have a job where u must shave everyday so it started to get annoying . So I decided to try again with this ES-LA63 all I can say is wow . I have been using it for 2 months now everyday and I love it it does take a little more time but it is well worth it . I use  neutrogena cream it gets the closest shave. To get the closest shave I use up and down motion and left to right after. I have very sensitive skin and I never had an issue .</li>
    <li> I have very thick facial hair that also grows very quickly. I have been using different Gillette cartridge razors for last 14 years. However, I got tired of paying hundreds of dollars for cartridges and switched to DE razors. I like shaving with the DE razor! The DE razor provides a good quality shave, and razor blades are really cheap. However, the shaving process can take up to 15 minutes, and I do not always have this time. I needed something that I could shave with in less than 5 minutes. As a result, I have decided to purchase this shaver as an addition to my DE razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Initially I was very skeptical that any electric shaver could deliver a good shave in a reasonable amount of time. I used a Braun shaver about 14 years ago, and I was very unsatisfied with its performance, and this was a reason why I switched to Gillette. However, after reading all the good reviews for different electric shavers, I have decided to give them a try with a hope that electric shavers&#x27; technology has advanced since my last Braun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Based on my research, I have decided to purchase this Panasonic shaver. I believe that this shaver has the best combination of price and quality. The quality of my first shave with this shaver was OK but not good. However, I read manual, and I knew that it should take my hair about 30 days to adjust to new shaver, so I did not expect much from my first shave. After just two weeks the quality of the shave improved significantly! So, this 30 day requirement is not a gimmick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this shaver for over a month by now, and I can say that this shaver can deliver a good quality shave especially if I do wet shaving. I have to admit that this shaver cannot give me a super smooth ﬁnish that I can get from my DE razor. However, the quality of shave is comparable to what I can get from G Fusion with a cartridge that has been used for 3-4 times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some Pros:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- I can get rid of my very thick facial hair inless than 5 min.&lt;br /&gt;- I have never had any irritations after shaving with this shaver.&lt;br /&gt;- It is very easy to clean, and the process takes about 30 seconds. So you do not need to spend money on cleaning cartridges. However, if you do prefer to use a cleaning station and cleaning cartridges, you do have this option.&lt;br /&gt;- You can shave 10 times (5 min each) on full charge.&lt;br /&gt;- It charges fast! In order to prolong the battery life, I follow recommendations on batteryuniversity.com and charge the battery when it has 50% charge left.&lt;br /&gt;- It is cheaper to shave with electric shaver than with cartridge razor.&lt;br /&gt;If you use this shaver every day for a year and trash it after this, each shave will cost you $0.24 (I got my shaver for 89$). However this shaver will most likely last for more than one year, so cost per shave could be even lower.&lt;br /&gt;DE razor cost per shave &#x3D; $0.02, given that you trash a blade after 5 uses.&lt;br /&gt;G Fusion cost per shave &#x3D; $0.62, given that you trash a cartridge after 5 uses. Gillette&#x27;s promise that one cartridge can last five weeks is laughable unless you shave once a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- The charger is 110 / 240 V, so you do not need to have any additional chargers if you travel abroad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have not discovered any significant Cons yet!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I am very satisfied with this product.</li>
    <li> I know this electric shaver is very highly rated, but my experience with it was not good.  After a lot of research, I selected this razor largely based on amazon reviews.  But after using it for over a month, I decided that it was subpar.  I only used it wet in the shower, trying multiple shave creams.  But after giving it much time, and fiddling with all sorts of techniques, I found it took longer to get a poorer shave than what I get with my gillette fusion proglide razor.  I had much more irritation with the panasonic than my experience with my traditional razor.  The panny did an awful job shaving the neck area.  I would often step out of the shower, look in the mirror and then have to shave the missed areas with a traditional razor....really, what&#x27;s the purpose ?  I don&#x27;t have a difficult beard by any stretch.  This shaver was a complete let down.  I don&#x27;t like writing negative reviews, but I need to be honest since this is not an inexpensive item.  Perhaps it works great as a dry shaver - I&#x27;ll give it the benefit of the doubt and 2 stars.</li>
    <li> Excellent electric shaver.  Does a really nice job.  I have shaved with a blade for years and finally decided to try an electric.  The first one I tried (different brand) just didn&#x27;t give me a very good shave.  I use this on in the shower, with gel, and get a great shave!</li>
    <li> Shave not as close as I would have liked or expected. Did poor on neck hair like my last electric razor.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been a rotary shaver man for 30 years.  I&#x27;ve always used various models of Norelco&#x27;s, and over the years, they do get more comfortable, and provide a closer shave, with each generation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This ES-LA63-S represents my first foil shaver.  And it represents the closest shave I&#x27;ve ever had with an electric. Despite the width of the four blade attachment, it moves around the face smoothly, comfortably, and a bit more nimbly than I would have imagined.  I&#x27;ve experience no razor rash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used it for about a month now, so still too earlier to tell if I&#x27;ll cross over to foil permanently.  But so far, I&#x27;m really enjoy the change of pace, and lasting longer into the day before the countenance of stubble breaks into the visible spectrum.</li>
    <li> This was a Christmas gift and my son loved it. What a close clean shave. He was impressed! Great buy!!</li>
    <li> I bought this a while ago but reserved my judgment for a while before writing a review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the beginning, it did a wonderful job (better than anything else on the market including Braun, Philips and Remington  - I tried them all). However, as time passed, it&#x27;s performance deteriorated and now it is performing just as any other electric shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the plus side - cleaning (using warm water) is easy. The buttery is holding charge for about 7-10 days and its performance does not deteriorate toward the low end of the charge cycle.</li>
    <li> Nice deal and high quality. It is more powerful than Narolco, and it suit the man with bushy beard very well.</li>
    <li> I have used this razor for about a month, under both wet and dry conditions.  I must say that it does such a good job under dry conditions this is the most used technique.  The charging system is quick and it holds a charge quite well.  I can get 8-10 shaves per charge.  The shave is very close and smooth.  Electric razors I have used in the past caused some skin irritation but this one caused none of that.  Would recommend it.</li>
    <li> Very good shaver. I can definitely say it gets a close as a normal razor which I never expected, but I guess the positive reviews are there for a reason. I love how it is water-proof which allows you to shave in the shower and provide a easy clean under the tap. I charge it only once in about every five times I use - battery is good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do get a few nicks here and there due to the close shave but from the reviews it seems it may take a while for your skin to get use to it. It has also improved my acne in areas where a normal razor would cause irritation and flammation. Razor is also slightly more noisier than I would hav expected but not a big deal. Overall excellent shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Very close shave, water-proof, good battery&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Slightly noisy (minor)</li>
    <li> I have used a the Panasonic wet/ dry for 15 years and as a product I find it the best of both worlds&lt;br /&gt;My only criticism of the above product is that it quite noisy</li>
    <li> I like this one very much, the best one I have used.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t think that I will use another one.</li>
    <li> Works excellent for at least one week without recharge. Very easy to clean under tap water for cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;You can also take it apart very easy for through cleaning if you feel like it. Great for wet or dry shavings.&lt;br /&gt;Best of all does close shave for my standard.I am very happy with the Panasonic brand.</li>
    <li> Quality is similar to the Panasonics that I have purchased in the past.  You can get a super close shave if you take it into the shower with you and soap your whiskers before shaving.  The ES-LA63 is quiet and I like the new display of time left in battery life.</li>
    <li> Not worth the price. My old Panasonic (the blue one) works better. I was hoping this new one would work better with the faster RPM&#x27;s. It left a lot of hairs unfortunately. Even after multiple passes too. I sent it back to Amazon and will stick with my blue one for now.</li>
    <li> I am not going to be able to add much to the other 635 reviews. I&#x27;ve been shaving for 35 years. I started out with a corded 2 head Norelco, moved to a foil Schick for about a month, then to a corded 3 head Norelco.  I stayed with Norelco for quite a while until they came out with the Aritec top of the line. That was it for me and Norelco. It was terrible, so bad, I am still not feeling like giving Norelco any of my money. I purchased a Braun 790 with the cleaning unit. It was a fantastic unit and I kept it until the cleaning unit failed and paint began to chip off. Now to the Panasonic, as good as the Braun but cheaper. Also, fantastic Japanese technology in the unit. What more can I say, cheaper than the top of the line units I have been buying for 20 years and just as good. I do use some lubricating spray after shaving and a weekly hot water cleanse with an occasional rubbing alcohol cleaning. You can do a lot worse with a lot more money.</li>
    <li> Every few years I try an electric shave and always find them too much trouble to deal with. I like to shave in the shower and this lets me do it. Easy to clean and charge lasts a long time. There was a note in the package that said use it for 30 days before judging it. I did and it does make a difference. After just a couple of weeks I was getting a great shave as good as a razor.</li>
    <li> I have tender skin, and all of my previous attempts to use electric razors have resulted in irritation and burning. So I&#x27;ve been wet-shaving in the shower with brush-and-lather and a blade for years and years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I&#x27;m trying very hard to reduce my water usage. Also, wet-shaving in the shower when traveling can be a challenge. So I thought I&#x27;d give electrics another try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have a mustache and goatee, and am mostly bald up top. I go for a smooth shave, but don&#x27;t mind some light stubble, so a good close blade-shave can last be two or three days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Panasonic does not irritate my skin, which is wonderful. But it doesn&#x27;t shave as close as a blade (I use Gillette Mach II), although it&#x27;s more than adequately close. I&#x27;d say that I need to shave again a day sooner with the Panasonic than with the blade. But it uses no water, takes about 4 minutes, and doesn&#x27;t burn my skin, so it&#x27;s all good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like how easy it is to clean, just rinsing it under water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m impressed with the battery. I&#x27;m getting a good 30 minutes or more of runtime per charge. We recently took a 3-week trip, and I brought just the shaver without the charger, and it lasted the whole trip (shaving every third day or so). The LCD readout is useful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, pretty much everything I could have wanted with no issues worth mentioning. No comment yet on blade replacement because, at my rate of use, I expect that to be a couple of years away.</li>
    <li> The best Panasonic razor yet...my third one.  I personally think it gives me a better shave that a blade.  I used the first two until the batteries would no longer take a charge and that was way more than 5 years.  Just think how much you save on razor blades and you won&#x27;t get cut and bleed all over everything.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my husband for Christmas and he loves it. He has very sensative facial skin. This shaver gives him a close and comfortable shave while not leaving irritation behind. He has tried many other electric razors but this is definitely the best yet.</li>
    <li> The shaver is very well, and the battery is good. When it works, the sound is a bit loud, and the price is favorable.</li>
    <li> This shaver is very smooth on the face, no discomfort and is nicely designed. I have no complaints and would highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I only gave it 4 stars because we haven&#x27;t had it long enough to do a full review. However, my husband has incredibly sensitive skin and he loves this shaver. He&#x27;s always used razors but they scuff up his skin and leaves him red and irritated. This shaver is so kind to his skin, it looks so much healthier and he is silky smooth! We both love it!</li>
    <li> Very good shaver, my husband loves it. Its almost an year but still going strong.</li>
    <li> I converted to machine shaving and I was not disappointed at all with the ES-LA63, in fact, it took a few months for my beard to adapt, but now it gives me an excellent close daily shave.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this razor for the past 2 months. It consistently fails to shave all the stubble, leaving a few untouched, specially from chin and neck area, no matter how many passes are made over one spot and in how many different directions/angles. I end up having to use a Gillette to complete the job hence contradicting both the purpose of a manual razor (close shave) and an electric one (comfort and saving time). The flyers that come with the product literally beg you to give it a months of exclusive usage to see the claimed results yet ironically offer only 30 days of satisfaction money back guarantee. For such an expensive shaver one should expect more.</li>
    <li> I wish that I had not bought this item. It just doesn&#x27;t get the job done. The charge is fine, but I don&#x27;t like having to cover the same area over and over especially under my chin, and mustache area.</li>
    <li> I had no idea an electric shaver could be so good.  I have had several Braun, Norelco and Remington products over the years but this is by far the best.</li>
    <li> My husband would never use an electric shaver because he said that it did not give him&lt;br /&gt;a close enough shave. This one does and he loves it.</li>
    <li> Well like the subject states, this was my first electric shaver in 25 years switching after switching from Gillette Powerglide 5 blade razors.  There are hundreds of reviews going over the features so I&#x27;ll just add what I drew from my experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- The most important tip above all tips is to read the manual before you use it.&lt;br /&gt;- When switching shaving methods for any razor, allow 30 days before you judge the shave. When I first started using it it was horrible, took me 8 minutes and I had to go over it several times and  I had patches of stubble and wanted to return it.  After a month, I&#x27;m down to 3-4 minutes and it is almost as close as my 5 blade shaver and I am totally pleased over all.&lt;br /&gt;- The shaver works much better wet if you pre wash and use some shaving lotion, I really liked the Kiss My Face product.&lt;br /&gt;- I also found it worked much better using Williams Electric Pre shave lotion to soften the whiskers before applying shaving cream if I don&#x27;t shave for a few days.&lt;br /&gt;- Use short slow, light, smooth and even strokes and go both directions until you can no longer hear it cutting any whiskers.  You will not get it to shave closer by pressing harder.  Electric shaves will never feel as close as a blade shave because it does not take off a layer of skin (which is healthier)  It does however pull the whisker up and shave under the skin for a better shave if you do it right.  They also recommend stretching your skin with your spare hand, but I personally don&#x27;t find it practical to do so when your using lotion it just makes it a mess and hand slippery.&lt;br /&gt;- There are a couple of spots that I can never quite reach.  So I use my cheap beard trimmer with it&#x27;s foil single blade shave attachment to get around my adams apple area, there&#x27;s just no way any full size electric shave is going to fit so the point is to use a smaller blade of choice.  The Norelco beard trimmers with this attachment are dirt cheap, can find one like my Norelco for under 20$.&lt;br /&gt;- Rinse the shaver off after each use, use some electric shaver lubricant and clean it good every two weeks.20$.&lt;br /&gt;- Rinse the shaver off after each use, use some electric shaver lubricant and clean it good every two weeks.</li>
    <li> great shave, great trimmer. for the price i love this thing. be careful when putting the head out the window to blow off the excess hair because the foil guard will fall out!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i have a very coarse beard and have to replace the cutter every 6 months, but i think that is a fault of my own and not the razor. best razor i have used yet and ive had the best norelco and braun.</li>
    <li> Given a 4 star rating instead of 5 due to the location and angle of the trimmer, which makes it difficult to see what you are doing when working on the bikini area.  However, the battery lasts a long time and has a indicator that lets you know how much time you have left before needing to be recharged.  It also works well with shaving the legs, giving a really close shave. Also, my husband likes to use it on his face, and he has never been a fan of electric shavers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recommend this product for men, and also for women who want a more powerful shaver that lasts longer than those designed for women.</li>
    <li> some one told me that la63 is the same sa la93.....but i am negtive.&lt;br /&gt;it works good.but can hardly clean my soft moustache.... i think maybe it is designed for the hard moustaches ?will....just waiting for my 790cc-4</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s good shavor&lt;br /&gt;But so powerful, I don&#x27;t recommend to sensitive skin&lt;br /&gt;And battery time is too short.&lt;br /&gt;I am satisfied with shaver</li>
    <li> Noticeably closer shave than the three blade shaver.  Don&#x27;t know yet about the longevity of the four blades in this shaver.  I&#x27;ve had this shaver about 2 months.</li>
    <li> After many years using the Gillette products I decide to give a try to the electric shavers, the first one I try one Norelco, then a Braun 3 series and finally this Panasonic, the Norelco was trash, the Braun was ok but for my sensitive skin was a problem but the Panasonic is near to perfection! I´m very happy with this shaver and I´ll recommend you to buy this one instead of other brands. The Panasonic head is much larger then the other shavers that I try and maybe at the end is a advantage. The ES-LA63-s is a really impressive electric shaver!</li>
    <li> Great razor, that shaves almost as close as a quad blade razor.  I have very sensitive skin, and most electric razors cause extreme razor burn.  This razor does not.  I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Been shaving for at least 30 years now and mostly with a razor and shave cream. I did however use various electrics both rotary and foil. I had an old Wahl shaver that I found to work the best the last time I used an electric. I decided to take it out and use it and being sold old an unused it did not charge well and the blade and foil need replacement. I was looking to replace it and decided to try this. After about two months-not impressed. First of all I can&#x27;t believe for this price it does not come with some type of cradle or stand. Even a non-charging stand would have been nice. As for the shave it self I don&#x27;t expect any electric to be as good as razor but this performs worse then the old Wahl working on only ONE of the it&#x27;s two blades!</li>
    <li> I used this shaver around 8 times so far. It works well, dry and wet. The way to clean it after each use makes it just like new every time.</li>
    <li> I use this razor exclusively for shaving my head in the shower and it works great. I will admit that it does not give you that crazy smooth shave that a razor gives, but I don;t care. I always found myself getting cuts and it would take days for them to heal... with this shaver I don&#x27;t have to worry about that anymore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have only had this shaver for 2 weeks and they say it takes a month for your hair to get used to it... so maybe after a couple more weeks it will give me an even closer shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ultimately though it gives a very close shave... just not as close as a traditional razor.</li>
    <li> When the battery on my Norelco started to no longer keep a reliale charge after 6 years, I decided it was cheaper to replace the entire machine than to replace its battery and blades. I had just referenced Consumers Report when Amazon put the one I had chosen on &amp;#34;Today&#x27;s Deals&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After several weeks use, I&#x27;d say it does a decent job - not a great job. It takes longer to get a smooth shave than the Norelco when it was new, but I can get one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trimmer works well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t shave in the shower, so the wet/dry is superfluous to me.&lt;br /&gt;.</li>
    <li> Just what I needed at the best price&lt;br /&gt;Would recommend to anyone&lt;br /&gt;Quick charge, close shave, easy to clean blades</li>
    <li> Ok, this is only my third electric shaver in my life. I have a Norelco 8894 XL jet black rotatory.  I had it since 2004, and it gave a very good shave, no complaints.  Recently, I lost most of the recharger indicator and the on/off button is starting to come apart.  However, it still strong and working.  So the hand writing on the wall said buy another one soon so we come the Panasonic ES-LA63-S.  I started exploring reviews and recommendations and it pointed towards a few models.  What I did was made a satisfaction index  by adding the 5 and 4 votes then divide by total number of purchases.  So actually the other model was the blue model with less features, higher priced and sightly higher satisfaction index.  The ES-LA63-S had the more features and when it came on sale it became my choice. So I got it about a month ago. It came with a charger and decent length chord, and a nice form fitting travel pouch, no cleaning brush or stand.  It had a small charge in it.  So a light went off and said do a shave off between the Panasonic and Norelco.  So I shaved one side with the Panasonic and the other side of face with the Norelco.  Now I have small features and so the area is slightly smaller then the average male especially under the nose.  So proceeding  I noted that the Panasonic besides looking awkward due to the size of it shaving head was actually easy to handle and maneuver especially around my mouth, under my nose and cliff chin, done in two minutes.  I repeated with the Noreloc which took more time mostly due to the smaller head and less blades.  It actually took a little more work to get the difficult areas.  Upon finishing with both I checked my face and the Panasonic shaved side was definitely soft and very smooth.  The Norelco shaved face side was only smooth, not very smooth, not soft feeling, however, good enough to look at.  In all the reviews I checked out noise levels and only got subjective reports. So I decided to check out the decibel readings with a good decibel reader.  The Panasonic checked in with a steady 77 decibels with the reading taken only a few inches off the head.  I did the same procedure with the Norelco and got a 65 decibels a few inches from the head. So neither reading is damaging to the ears, in fact it is around a loud voice. Now annoying factor is a separate issue as it isn&#x27;t very musical that is another story. I wasn&#x27;t annoyed at all, it has a pleasant hum.  Also I have fairly tender skin and I can&#x27;t really use a blade on it without a rash.  My skin experience using the Panasonic is my skin has very slight burning feeling, no skin coloration change, and over time I expect it will go down. I don&#x27;t use wet shave and so that is for you to check out. From what I read most users got a even closer or more comfortable wet shave then dry shave. Hey it depends upon you personal tolerances, tastes, and goals.  The only other thing don&#x27;t shave as it running out of power, ouch!  I learned the hard way when it stops then has you by the short hairs, it hurts when you pull it off your face, LOL!  So if you are one of those that believes you need to bleed the power dry don&#x27;t do it on your face.  So everything works fine, lots of power, easy to clean, and it just lays on its side on my sink.  Who needs a stand?  Idea for a stand, just buy one of those glassware art objects that can support it head down and you good to go.  Maybe if I think about it I may get a six month or one year check in how it goes.  Good hunting, my hunts over, bagged my game.  Oh, why a 4.5?  Because there is always one that is better out there. : ^ ))good decibel reader.

    <li> This razor is smooth, feels comfortable in one&#x27;s hand, has yet to pull or tug on any of my facial hairs, easy to clean (running it under the faucet) and the battery life is great.  I cannot give it 5 stars because it does not quite shave as close as I was hoping.  You can do a quick shave and miss some hairs or you can spend a lot of time getting everything.  It is by far better than my old nerelco (3 circular blade), but I guess I was hoping for a little better shave without having to spend a lot of time getting a close shave.</li>
    <li> I use it mostly to shave my head and it does a great job.  Once fully charged, I&#x27;ve was able to use it for 10 days straight (shaving time per day &#x3D; 20 mins)  while traveling and I still did not exhaust the battery completely.</li>
    <li> This shaver has has two fast motors and provides a very clean cut. One of the best electric shavers I have ever used.</li>
    <li> Very close shave,  Noise level acceptable.  Don&#x27;t know how long the cutter will stay sharp as I have not had it very long.  Battery length not as long as I would like however for my routine not an issue.</li>
    <li> It is loud but shaves really well.  Probably the best shaver I&#x27;ve ever owned. I wish the head was a bit smaller.</li>
    <li> It works very good. Easy uses, The price of the shaver is cheap. It&#x27;s better than Norelco brand  I love it</li>
    <li> Exactly as advertised, great quality product from Panasonic.  Great price and fast ship.  Wet/Dry feature was a priority for me and this is one of the best.</li>
    <li> Fast and nice job, this model is even better than three blades, I would chalenge Panasonic to do some thing better.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only owned two electric razors and once I switched from a blade, I&#x27;ve never looked back.  I bought the Panasonic a few months back after my other one&#x27;s battery started giving out.  It doesn&#x27;t cut as close as my cheaper MS 280 Remington shaver, but I like the speed at which it cuts and the fact that I can use it in the shower if I feel like it.  4stars</li>
    <li> I am not an electric razor person, but this one is superior to all those I have tried over the years.  Definitely recommended for those who go electric.</li>
    <li> My husband has coarse curly hair and this razor handles it no problem at all. The long hair trimmer is a little awkward but still works.</li>
    <li> I am using this shaver for a while, and overall it works great. The battery life is very good, the shaving is almost perfect. I mean to say that it shaves great, however despite of being multi-flex it cannot shave perfectly on the curves of the chin. Overall this is a wonderful product. I bought panasonic ES-LA63-S 4-Blade in a deal, and it worth buying in deal.</li>
    <li> This razor tops anything I have used in the past 50 years, including Braun, Payerlux, Other Panasonics, Grundig. It is very smooth, quick, quiet, easy to clean and holds its charge for at least a week of shaving. My beard is tough and in all directions but this beauty handled all with ease. The trimmer is also in the same league. A joy to hold and to use. What more could an oldie like me want?</li>
    <li> It shaves twice as well as my old razor with no irritation.</li>
    <li> I have a tough beard that grows very fast.  I also get crazy ingrown hairs.  I have never been able to shave every day.  Basically I&#x27;ve spent my life (I&#x27;m now in my forties) like a cast member from Miami Vice.  Most recently I had gone to old style &amp;#34;safety razors&amp;#34;, which were about the best compromise of quality, price and comfort.  However, I still could not shave daily without a great deal of discomfort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried shavers before and my father was a big fan. Between hand me downs and gifts I&#x27;ve tried top-end norelcos several times but they were always hard on my skin, under my chin, and left scores of the thickest hairs I grows scattered around my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recently I did some research and I saw that this model and the high-end Brauns were rated highly on a couple of sites.  I like that this one was priced right and it is good wet too.  I&#x27;ve had it a week now.  I&#x27;m getting an unbelievably close shave, I can shave as often as I like (daily or even more) and I&#x27;ve done it wet and dry.  I prefer wet when I have a minute to lather up, and when I do so the closeness of the shave is unreal.  Dry, I&#x27;ve tried a couple of pre-shave products and it&#x27;s really quite pleasant and doesn&#x27;t dry or irritate my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Really and truly, if you have ruled out these things because your beard is too tough or you&#x27;ve had bad experiences before, you need to give this a try.  It&#x27;s really amazing and so much less painful and expensive (in the long haul) than anything I&#x27;ve tried before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TIP:  Don&#x27;t use this if your beard already has several days growth. You&#x27;ll get best results with a day or two of growth when you first use it and then you can play around with what works for you.</li>
    <li> I purchased this item because I needed a close shave on my head. Its been great since I purchased it. I am able to use it wet or dry which is perfect. The battery lasts really long and it actually monitors how long i spend using it during each shave. Great product!</li>
    <li> shipping weight in USZCN 0.83kg；&lt;br /&gt;Chaozhi！Great razor for excellent price！&lt;br /&gt;Panasonic ES-LA63-S and Panasonic ES-LA93-K 4 Blade (as seen on the video) are basically the same shavers, they only differ in color, price and the cleaning-charging dock that is included with the later.The ES-LA93-K is the same level foil shaver that can do wet shaving while the Braun 7 790cc only supports dry shaving. Braun 7 790cc is like the Mercedez of shavers because of its technologically advanced features and quality.&lt;br /&gt;转运中国入库重量为0.83kg 仅供给位参考！ 相比ES-LA93-K 4，ES-LA63-S只是少了清洁桶，是除了790cc以外最好的选择了。。</li>
    <li> This shaver gives a very close shave, but mine just got defective after only 6 months. Although it still works, it shows garbled numbers on the digital display. I use it everyday, having to charge the battery every 3 days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One more vote of confidence for Amazon. I reported the situation and they one-day shipped a new one. Amazon with no doubt is the most customer-centric business on earth.</li>
    <li> Clean, quick shave; runs quite; great save time on one charge. Pop-up is slightly difficult to see behind the large head.</li>
    <li> The shaver is easy to use. The trimmer is adequate . If you need a better trimmer for nose hair I recommend a separate trimmer.</li>
    <li> I purchased this razor because of the good reviews.  I have a beard and only shave the neck area.  I could get a decent shave, but it took 6-7 minutes.  My 7 year old Norelco was doing the same in about half the time.</li>
    <li> I have had several Panasonic shavers over the lasat ten years. All have been pretty good. I use this one wet with just a bit of liquid hand soap instead of shave cream. Soap rinses away cleanly. Shave cream has lubricants that gum up a shaver over time.</li>
    <li> I like the shaver but the size is like trying to shave with a golf club. The other Panasonic(s) I&#x27;ve had were less cumbersome. They did add another row of blades with this model. Will have to see if I get the claimed 2 week run time per charge.</li>
    <li> Added 3.24.10&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve discovered this shaver works best with liquid body soap or hand soap instead of shaving cream.  With shaving cream you might end up with hairs missed especially in difficult areas such as around your adam&#x27;s apple.  In fact, with shaving cream I basically had to shave twice, and oftentimes I ended up taking out the blade razor to clean up what the electric shaver missed, but using the liquid soap I&#x27;ve had no problems whatsoever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Liquid soap is also what you&#x27;re supposed to use per the instructions to clean the foil and blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-------------------------&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Addition to my original review:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It pays to read the instruction manual.  Unlike prior electric shavers I&#x27;ve had, this one doesn&#x27;t need new parts very often--my Norelco for instance costs me about the same in new rotating shaver blade heads alone as my disposable cartridge blade shaver and requires a their own brand of shaving cream without option.  In fact, according to the manual, I only need to replace the foil and blades once every year or two!  So cost-wise, this shaver is not only better but costs less in the long run.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, once I became used to using this shaver it has been giving me shaves just as good as a razor but without all the problems.  Even when I haven&#x27;t shaved a couple of days, it mows down the extra stubble.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The is the first electric shaver that actually works as advertised, in fact better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lastly, the sonic cleaning feature really works as well too.  No special cleaners required; just put some hand soap on the foil and turn on the sonic clean under the tap; then open it up and do the same for the blades without adding soap--it comes out looking like it had been polished.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shaver even has indicators on its display for when it&#x27;s time to clean and when it&#x27;s time to replace the foil and such.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BOTTOM LINE: Worth the money if you want an electric shaver that wont disappoint as others are prone to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--------------------------&lt;br /&gt;My original review:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I especially like as an American man who has suffered many electric shavers over the years that have come to me as Christmas gifts is the fact that this one allows me to use the same shaving cream I like using with my standard cartridge blade shaver instead of something specially made for the particular make and model.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I realized it might spell the quick doom of this very expensive shaver to try it, but I just had to, so I used my shaving cream from The Body Shop rather than whatever might be recommended and the shaver did just fine.  I drowned it in water with the shaver on and it didn&#x27;t break down.  In short, I&#x27;ve given this shaver about as much abuse as I could and it just kept on going, a month later as well as it did on the first try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The durability of the parts has been outstanding as well, possibly because I was able to use shaving cream with it that protected face and shaver alike.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also like the cool gadget aspect of the design.What I especially like as an American man who has suffered many electric shavers over the years that have come to me as Christmas gifts is the fact that this one allows me to use the same shaving cream I like using with my standard cartridge blade shaver instead of something specially made for the particular make and model.    I realized it might spell the quick doom of this very expensive shaver to try it, but I just had to, so I used my shaving cream from The Body Shop rather than whatever might be recommended and the shaver did just fine.

    <li> [[VIDEOID:mo3RMHSRNYYYOWO]]Pros:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* Closest shave of any electric shaver I&#x27;ve ever used in my entire life.&lt;br /&gt;* Large, flexible head with multiple shaving foils is flexible and shaves my cheeks as closely as a straight blade does.&lt;br /&gt;* Waterproof and very convenient to use in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;* Easy to clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* VERY expensive!&lt;br /&gt;* Still can&#x27;t beat a straight blade when it comes to shaving my neck.&lt;br /&gt;* Large head with multiple shaving foils makes it hard to shave precisely, which makes this a bad shaver for shaping beards and sideburns.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conclusion:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the price, it should do a better job with the neck. You can get a shave that&#x27;s ALMOST as good from one of the Panasonic shavers that costs half as much, and you still need a good straight blade to finish the job. Because it&#x27;s the best electric shaver I&#x27;ve ever used, I will give it four stars, but it&#x27;s far more economical to get a cheaper Panasonic and a straight blade.</li>
    <li> when my earlier Pannsonic fell off the shelf and broke I went looking for a replacement....would up choosing this model and it shaves even better than the previous model....very happy</li>
    <li> This is the best shaver I have ever owned. I have been a rotary head guy for years and hated that with my sparse and fine facial hair I spent more time ripping the hair out than cutting it. This unit has been a godsend. It cuts very close and does not tug or pull at all. I have also yet to feel any significant razor burn or have an blemish outbreak following.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would say for 90% of guys though, the Arc3 would do just as well. I find that most of the time at nearly every angle I rarely engage the 4th foil. That said, this shaver is awesome and at the price I paid it was worth the investment over the Arc3 if only for 3 hairs a swipe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have not used it wet, nor do I really intend to, but if I do I will update. I am on my 5th shave and the battery is still at 60%, so for those light weight business travelers who want to leave the plug behind, you will be happy with the battery life of this unit. I would expect it to make it easily through a week long business trip without a charger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also before you get discouraged, if you are a rotary guy going foil for the first time, as with most foil shavers be sure to vary the angle of approach to best match the angle of the hair. You may think it is not working well until you do.</li>
    <li> After using a blade (or 4) for over 35+ years, I decided to go electric.  Best thing I ever did concerning shaving.  I thought I couldn&#x27;t get as close as a blade...WRONG.  It will get as close as a blade.  No skin irritation.  I don&#x27;t mind shaving (after a shower at night and then) again in the morning. Other brands must use their cleaning solution; this is easy: hand soap &amp; water. The head pivots in all directions, pop up trimmer.  The ES-LA93 comes with it&#x27;s own bowl for cleaning &amp; storage, but is it worth $100. more?  For me no.  I got a really good price from an Amazon dealer, so this one was even more attractive.  It&#x27;s a wet/dry shaver so I use shaving gel then shave.  Very smooth.  I&#x27;ll use this until it dies.  Then buy another.  No more blades for me.</li>
    <li> First, I have a tough fast growing beard. So even with a blade I get a five o&#x27;clock shadow. For the past 10 years I have been shaving primarily with electric razors. My first was a high end Norelco and since I had nothing to compare it to I thought it was okay. Until recently I&#x27;ve relied on my Braun 8995 for about the last 4 years. It did a great job and along with the self-cleaning unit worked flawlessly until I accidentally knocked the shaver off the bathroom sink. By the way I did have a dinner shadow but also have a Braun M-70 that I used to clean up. TheM-70 is an incredible low end shaver that accept for being a bit tough on the face gives a great shave.     That brings us to now. I thought about getting another Braun but they seem to have gone up in price and I wanted to move away from self-cleaning units. Not because they don&#x27;t work but because I felt a littlel guilty using chemicals and having non-essential waste to discard. That brought me to the Panasonic LA-63.    I charged it when I took it out of the box and tested all functions, shave, clean, sonic clean, lock and trimmer. All worked according to specifications. The shaver is big but quite comfortable in my hand. The head is big but I found it easy to manage all around my face becuase of the 360 mobility. I was pleasantly surprised how close the shave was. This was also the first electric shaver that did an adequate job on my neck and chin. I can&#x27;t say it&#x27;s as close as a blade but the differences aren&#x27;t worth talking about. Comparing to a blade shave where you go with the grain, as recommended, the panasonic for me was as good, but comparing to a blade shave against the grain, which I had to do, the differences aren&#x27;t that great with the blade winning by a hair. By the way when necessary I still use my M-70 for late day clean-ups.    If this shaver is durable and lasts it&#x27;s clearly the best I&#x27;ve had to date. Higly recommended.    Don&#x27;t pay $300, there are plenty of internet deals at half that price. At this cost the shaver is an excellent value even though it is not cheap.</li>
    <li> Outstanding close shave. Quiet motor and charges quickly. Fast Shipping too. Thanks!</li>
    <li> I bought this razor to replace my 5th Norelco Rotary shaver I have owned in the last 20+ years.  I bought it after doing allot of research on electric shaver, both rotary &amp; foil.  Plus different brands: Norelco, Panasonic, Braun, Remington &amp; such.  The features of this razor far out number the other brands!  The Wet/Dry Feature AND the Easy Cleaning are the things that most appealed to me.  After using it for a few days I noticed it was a closer shave than a rotary style!  It is much smoother (especially when shaving wet!)  And did not leave bumps on my neck like I get with a rotary or a blade razor.  I would have given it 5 stars if not for (2) things.  #1)  A stand would be nice (for when it&#x27;s drying) i.e.: a cheap plastic one.  #2)  I still use a blade razor to leave a cleaner side-burn line.  The razor will do it but 2 seconds with a blade leaves a cleaner line.  Overall I would highly recommend this razor!  But don&#x27;t take my word on it;  Do your Home Work &amp; see it is a better choice over a Braun or Rotary Style like Norelco.</li>
    <li> Update 7/17/17; Update 12/1/12; original review 10/9/10.  Update about 7 years later...  I&#x27;m still using this razor, though I&#x27;ve changed the foil and blades a number of times.   At this point the digital display is dead and the razor head is stained with soap/shaving cream that won&#x27;t come off. But it still works, holds a charge for a long time, and gives a good shave.   * * *  12/1/12  After two years I replaced this razor. Could you get more life out of it than two years? Definitely. Why did I replace it?  1. Mold, despite regular cleaning regime.  * After about 18-20 months, this razor started to get black mold on/in the plastic under the foil cover, on the part of the razor where the blades are attached. This part of the razor is a light color plastic, so it could be easily seen. It does not rub off; it is in the plastic and like a stain. I should add this problem emerged even though I ALWAYS took off the foil cover, rinsed the foil cap and blade area of razor after use, and left the two parts out on the counter to dry. I can only imagine that not doing this cleaning routine (a quick rinse and putting it in a drawer) would leave one with a very moldy razor.  * I tried cleaning the mold with a bleach solution, soap, and hydrogen peroxide. Helped but didn&#x27;t get rid of it. I&#x27;m sure the mold was also within the razor in areas that I couldn&#x27;t see.  * I think this was mostly a cosmetic issue, but I didn&#x27;t like the idea that there would be mold near shaving blades and my face.  * If you have a black version of this razor you probably have the same thing happening, but you don&#x27;t see it. It might be a good idea for everyone to give their wet razors a dunk in hydrogen peroxide or a bleach solution once in a while.  2. I upgraded to a model with a cleaning stand.  * As noted below, I didn&#x27;t really like that this razor didn&#x27;t come with some kind of stand. I knew that I wouldn&#x27;t put a wet thing in a drawer, and if I was going to leave it out on the counter, it felt like it should have a stand.  * Because of the mold issue, I upgraded to a model that would have a stand and the cleaning function. I am hopeful that the cleaning function will eliminate the mold problem with my new Panasonic razor.  * I will write a review of the new razor, but let me just say here that the stand is big, not very elegant, has very bright flashing lights (you won&#x27;t want it near your bedroom at night), and very noisy for about 5-10 minutes (sounds like a train, and in a quiet room feels as loud, no joke-- my wife hates it).  Summary-- Panasonic makes a great razor, but this mold issue was an unexpected disappointment.  10/9/10.  This is an excellent shaver and I&#x27;ve switched happily and probably permanently from blade shaving, only wishing I had switched years ago. But years ago (say 15 to 20) I had used a few different rotary Braun and Norelco electric razors that didn&#x27;t do a great job, and gave them up for blades. This one works differently, whether it is the ultrasonic or the blade style and motion, so if you think you have tried an electric shaver by trying only one kind, I&#x27;ve learned that you have to try all the different types. This one might be the one for you.  I shaved for years with Mach III blades, but even using high quality shaving cream, I came to hate shaving, that knife on my face, which I have to do every day, with a dark beard. This razor give a close shave and it is painless. I continue to shave wet, with no difference than with my blade, and have had no irritation, even with the very first use (so don&#x27;t be put off by that &amp;#34;you have to get used to it&amp;#34; warning). I actually look forward to shaving now, or at least don&#x27;t mind it at all. Granted, I still have my Mach III handy, to clean up a few missed hairs, but I do not mind the &amp;#34;extra step,&amp;#34; since I get a closer shave than I ever have, and without pain and any cuts. (My routine includes Art of Shaving or Body Shop shaving cream, excellent products, a small amount of cream lathered on with a damp shaving brush.)  Shaving is quick with this razor. Its rapid ultrasonic motion creates more lather when you use shaving cream, which makes the shaving even smoother. It takes a few minutes, and you don&#x27;t have to worry about getting cut.  Maybe you can get the same shave with one of the lower priced models, but I am so pleased with it that I don&#x27;t resent the price. I sometimes wish that I had bought a model with a stand however.</li>
    <li> Decent product but it takes much longer to shave than bladed razors. For my face, it doesn&#x27;t do a good job cutting all the stubble under my chin.</li>
    <li> It took Amazon a week to package up the shaver and ship and then another eight days to get from Indianapolis to the East coast. Not impressed. It is boxed nicely and includes a relatively cheap looking but roomy vinyl case. It uses the Lithium type battery but had a low charge when delivered. It took about an hour to charge it up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a larger shaver than many and is very noisy. My Norelco is silent by comparison. The shaver does a good job, about as good as you can get with an electric. It does take four or five passes for the closest shave, but does cut close. The display is informative, including a battery charge % indicator.  The shaver is made in Japan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know about durability yet.</li>
    <li> I love this shaver, and it&#x27;s a huge upgrade over my old Norelco.  Does an excellent job on my face and about as good as I&#x27;m going to get on my neck.  For the price, I think this may be one of the best values (plus Amazon had a $40 coupon to clip!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- Large shaving head covers a lot of area and does a very good job on my face.  Pivots or locks, depending on preference.&lt;br /&gt;- I typically shave dry and was very impressed with the closeness of the shave.&lt;br /&gt;- Charges quick, seems to hold the charge well (admittedly, its new, so that&#x27;s not terribly surprising)&lt;br /&gt;- Easy to clean&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- Cannot charge and shave at the same time.  To me, this is the biggest negative, by far.&lt;br /&gt;- Trimmer is awkward to use, will still probably use my dedicated one for close areas.&lt;br /&gt;- Large shaving head is nice, but its size can make it a bit tougher to handle at times.  For me, this isn&#x27;t a huge deal, but some might find it to be a negative.&lt;br /&gt;- It&#x27;s considerably louder than my old shaver, but nothing too bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m very happy with this one.  Good price, great shaver.  Doesn&#x27;t have some of the bells and whistles of other shavers (such as a cleaning/charging station), but it does a great job.</li>
    <li> We got this for my grandfather, who has Parkinson&#x27;s disease. This shaver has been surprisingly easy for him to use himself, and the battery has a nice long life each charge. The shape is easy to grip. It does give a nice close shave.</li>
    <li> Had a short &amp;#34;learning curve&amp;#34; with this one but now I&#x27;m very satisfied.Wet/dry....every time does the job.Much better than my previous Panasonic devices</li>
    <li> I have resisted using an electric shaver all of my life. I have given in to advertising about how wonderful various new models were supposed to be only to be disappointed: dry shavers simply do not give me the close shave that I want. When I ordered this shaver I wondered if I was making another mistake. The answer in a word is &amp;#34;NO&amp;#34;. This is a great shaver; great, close  shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recharges in about an hours and a single charge lasts a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend selecting a quality shaving cream which will lubricate your face to prevent dragging of the shaver across the surface. After shaving, while the shaver is still running wash it thoroughly to keep the device clean. I also pop off the screen and rinse it thoroughly.</li>
    <li> Work great shave in 1:30 mins</li>
    <li> I really like this product, the price is right, very easy to use, very clean beard! Next time I will buy it!</li>
    <li> My first electric shaver and I&#x27;m very impressed. It gives you very close shave as a regular razor. It is easy to clean and gives battery life on the screen.</li>
    <li> I have used both Braun and Norelco best models as they come out, and have not been overjoyed with either. I buy new models as they appear based on the manufactures claims as to how good these top of the line models are.They are not. The Norelco shavers (all of them) irritates my neck so badly , that I revert back to the Braun . Neither make has ever really given me a satisfactory shave. I received this Panasonic razor several days ago, and I am impressed with closeness of the shave. without causing any irritation. At this point, I can say that the Panasonic is far superior to either the Braun  or the norelco for both comfort and closeness of shave. Hopefully, it will continue to perform as stated</li>
    <li> This is an excellent razor. I had for years been using the ES8103S and this one is definitely a bit better. The ES8103S is a great product, and more affordable, but this guy is an upgrade. Seems to work really well wet or dry. You&#x27;re never going to get as close as a shave as with a manual razor, but this comes close enough and you don&#x27;t need to worry about shaving cream or nicks and cuts. The battery life seems really good, and the thing is small enough to toss in a bag for travel. Good stuff.</li>
    <li> Change my life. I can&#x27;t live without it. Is just perfect.</li>
    <li> Average shave. Comfortable, but it takes awhile to get a close shave. Easy to clean. Nothing more to say about it.</li>
    <li> Exceeded my expectations. Gives a close, effortless shave. Far superior to any shaver my husband has used. He loves it!</li>
    <li> My husband said the shave is smoother than any shave he&#x27;s had with an electric razor.  I Definitely recommend it!</li>
    <li> I recently purchased this item and I am new with electric shavers. The shaving result is really good. There are only few spots on my face and neck that I need to shave very carefully to get a clean result. However, I am experiencing shaving rash around my neck which is painful and annoying. I used this shaver for about 2 weeks now. I am not sure whether to keep it and give it more time or return it. I almost never had this issue with razor.</li>
    <li> I have used the triple-headed Norelco shavers for decades, but simply thought I&#x27;d take a chance on foil ribbon. This was a well-recommended product and I can say after a month or so that it deserves such a rating. The shave is very good and smooth. I find it quite easy around the nose and chin. Does really well with the neck, too. No irritation and it works really well wet.</li>
    <li> The best shave I have had with an electric razor. It does not lose power when the battery wears. Easy to clean.</li>
    <li> I have owned 4 of these shavers (gave one to my son).  The shave quality is superior to anything I have used in the past.  No question it has one of the closest most comfortable shaves, virtually identical to triple or four blade razors. No nicks no cuts with this cordless shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s the beef I have.  All 4 shavers experienced the exact same problems:  1. the LCD display goes haywire after about a year or so and...  2.  the power button sticks and causes the razor to stay on despite attempts to turn it off.  In addition, one razor experienced the LCD issue and when pressing the power button the shaver kept cycling between cleaning mode and shaving mode on its own.  This shaver is not built to last.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like the comfort and closeness of the shave. That is why I kept buying it even after all the issues.  However, after the 4th one died I bought the Panasonic ES-LF51. I believe the problem with the ES-LA63 is that it is NOT waterproof (even though its a &amp;#34;wet-dry&amp;#34; shaver).  The LCD is too cute and gives too much information (time shaving, battery level, other irrelevant data).  That&#x27;s why it fails over time.  I just need battery level. Why do I care how long it takes me to shave?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Panasonic ES-LF51 is waterproof and still has the 4 blade technology.  I have been using it for a little over a week and it yields the same close shave with a smaller shaving head. And the LCD only tells you battery level - perfect!  Hopefully it lasts longer than the LA-63.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve stayed with rotary shavers all my adult life because many years ago I got a closer and less irritating  shave with them.  My last was a Norelco XL on which I had changed the blades once and was thinking it was time to do it again because it seemed to be getting harder to get a close shave, particularly on my upper lip, right under-the-nose area.  First I looked at Norelco&#x27;s newest and most artfully &amp;#34;beautiful&amp;#34; model but saw that the blades were now positioned farther from the edge than on the older models.  That would make it even harder to get a close shave where I needed it most.  So I ruled out a Norelco upgrade just using reasoning.  With a shaver, function trumps art.  I also noticed that my old Norelco&#x27;s battery was needing recharging more frequently than it used to - maybe a sign that I&#x27;d have to replace it soon.  That left me with the scary thought of going back to a non-rotary shaver and the daunting task of reviewing all the other shavers on the market.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to take a chance and try out this Panasonic, figuring I had 30 days in which to return it if I didn&#x27;t like it.  I chose it because (1) I don&#x27;t like the idea of having a large black &amp;#34;sterilizer stand&amp;#34; out on the bathroom counter at all times, (2) it was cheaper, and (3) the bulk of the reviews were sufficiently convincing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After 1 full week am I happy with my decision?  Absolutely thrilled!  Since I&#x27;m so used to a rotary, the very first shave felt a little awkward but I saw that it shaved my upper lip area closer than I had seen it in a great many years.  The blades get a little warm where it works hard on that area but it does not irritate one bit.  Fantastic!  The manual tells me my skin and I need some time to adapt to the new shaver action.  I can&#x27;t speak for my skin, but each day I find that my shaving technique improves as I learn what I need to do differently from when I used the rotary - something about learning which way the hairs grow in different facial areas so I can shave &amp;#34;against the grain&amp;#34;, so to speak.  I&#x27;m catching on and taking a little less time each day - which reminds me that I love the timer readout.  I never knew exactly how much time a shave takes, as if it matters, but it&#x27;s an interesting bit of feedback to ponder while still half asleep.  The other functions viewable on the blue lit screen are useful and cool.  Best of all, I&#x27;m now getting the closest shaves I&#x27;ve ever had.  As I develop more expertise in shaving my own face, I suspect that I&#x27;ll start playing games trying to beat my speed record.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the down side, maybe only for me, I wish it came with a small stand to put it in after I rinse it off and some drops of water remain.  I don&#x27;t like laying it out loose on the countertop, so I stow it away in a drawer, but that&#x27;s a problem if it&#x27;s still wet.  And the cleaning instructions and pictures are somewhat contradictory and vague.  I&#x27;m not really stymied about how to clean the shaver, but it&#x27;s not because of Panasonic&#x27;s explanation.  Overall, after just one week, I&#x27;m very pleased with its performance.</li>
    <li> Very close and extremely comfortable shave. Not as close as the expensive blades but much closer than cheap razors. I have used wet and dry but more comfortable and closer wet.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband. He likes it with the exception that it will not really cut the last hairs on the neck so he needs to use a reg razor for those spots. Charges fast. Battery life ok.</li>
    <li> It was the first time I buy a shaver like that.&lt;br /&gt;I was expecting more time of batery and a better shave that it does.&lt;br /&gt;Finally is a nice shaver but i will wait for his development. Maybe if a continue shaving all day it can produces better resaults</li>
    <li> Many years ago I had a Pansonic Wet/Dry shaver and recalled good results with it.  I&#x27;m not sure why I switched, but I ended up going through countless Norelco Rotary Shavers for many years thereafter... feeling somewhat satisfied, but not completely.  And,, yes... I tried the manual shaver systems a few times but that never lasted very long.  I nursed my last Norelco through tons of maintenance, replaced parts and specialized cleanings for many years, but soon learned that it just wasn&#x27;t going to get back to where I wanted it to be.  As a gift, I received an Amazon Gift Card late last year and decided to find a new shaver.  I was almost ready to order the latest Norelco,until I saw the ratings on the Panasonic Razor.  I am ever so grateful that I made that decision.  This razor produces the closest, cleanest shave in a minimal number of passes I have ever experienced.  Even those hard-to-reach places on the face became simple and easy.  Clean up is a breeze!  You owe it to yourself to try the Panasonic brand!</li>
    <li> Like Panasonic says, it&#x27;s terrific, wet or dry.  I personally find that it works best when my face is wet.  Easy to use, easy to clean.</li>
    <li> I owned 3 blade Panasonic earlier for 5 years and I loved it. So I upgraded to 4 blade now.Item arrived on time. I was able to use the first time. After that it needed charging. Even after a full day of charge, I could not use it. Seems to be problem with the adaptor it came with. Need to return it.</li>
    <li> There seems to be some concern as to charge holding for this razor. I charged mine when I received it overnight May 11. I shave with it 5 times a week. I guess I am blessed with an easy to shave face as average time is 45 seconds or less. I just had to recharge the razor this past week on August 8 the razor finally reached exhaustion of the initial charge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Much as others have shared the cut is as close to shaving with a blade that I have found in an electric razor. I have tried wet, oil, lectric shave and dry shaving. Dry works quickest for me; yet oil gives a very smooth shave closer to the blade shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really enjoy shaving with this razor...</li>
    <li> Great Shaver. No skin irritation, Decent battery life Could be better but because it shows battery in %age you dont get caught off guard with a dead battery mid shave</li>
    <li> This is my first electric shaver in over 40 years. I have used the Gillette series with great success, but changed because I am to undergo a right shoulder replacement and won&#x27;t be able to use the blade as well. I&#x27;ve had the ES-LA63-S Arc4 for a bit over a month an am still getting used to it, but it comes very close to the blade as long as I use it &amp;#34;wet&amp;#34;. I am impressed and will probably not go back to the blade shaver.</li>
    <li> My last Panasonic still works, but since this item was discounted, I decided to invest in a new once. The Panasonic I had lasted about 4 years, so I expect this one to be as solid and last a long time. Easy to charge up, battery lasts a considerable amount of time. Good clean shave. And love that you can wash it in plain water, no special liquids needed, no sharpening or anything. The lock for travel is a convenient improvement over the earlier version I had been using.</li>
    <li> best wet/dry shaver i&#x27;ve ever purchased.</li>
    <li> Shaver really is good. However the LCD panel failed . It was still under warranty and I sent it back to Panasonic&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s been a month and I still have not received the shaver back Numerous calls have not been successful with Panasonic I am unhappy with their warranty service and customer relations&lt;br /&gt;To repeat the shaver when it was working was fine  However I cannot recommend shaver because of the poor service</li>
    <li> I hjave used Panasonic for about fourty years and this is the third one that I have owned. I tried others (Iwont mention names) but&lt;br /&gt;Panasonic gave me the best shave of all and it is so easy to clean.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks Panasonic!</li>
    <li> Having owned  Norelco and Remmington electric razors in the past, I did not know  how close a shave a GREAT electric razor would provide.  I love my new Panasonic ES-LA63 and use it most days in place of my blade razor.  Very easy to use and it gives a very close shave.</li>
    <li> It works great when my hair actually enters in to the grating at the top. But my facial hair lies flat and regardless of the direction I shave, most of it does not enter the grating and hence cannot be cut. Admittedly, it gives an extremely close shave to every hair that it actually does cut. But only like 40% of my hair gets cut on each pass. It takes like 30 passes to complete my shave. The head pivots nicely, but it doesn&#x27;t fix the basic problem I have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had this problem with cheaper electric razors as well. I thought I&#x27;d give something more high-end a try, but it didn&#x27;t work. I&#x27;ll go back to using disposables. The Mach 5 is okay, but my current favorite is the Shick Xtreme 3.</li>
    <li> After reading the reviews I was a little unsure if I would like it.  But, I have had this shaver now about a month and I can easily say that this is the very best electric shaver I have ever had, and that covers a lot of ground.  Previously, I had a Remington and before that a Braun unit.  But, this one is in a class all its own.  It gets everything!  I have never had a shaver that could get the wirely growth under my chin and on the neck.  I used to have to use the trimmer in conjunction with the shaver head to get that area clean.  But, this Panasonic does it all.  And, it is the most comfortable shave I have ever experienced.</li>
    <li> This beauty is perfect for those looking for a quick smooth shave. highly recommended for all men and great value for money!</li>
    <li> Panasonic ES-LA63-S Arc4 Men&#x27;s Electric Shaver Wet/Dry with Multi-Flex- Very good model, shaves clean and fast. Fast charhing! shaves cleanly, smoothly, quickly.</li>
    <li> After some bad experiences several years ago I gave an electric shaver another chance with the Panasonic and it works great.  It gives me a smooth shave with no burning or other problems with shavers I tried before.  It&#x27;s easy to clean and the charge lasts a very long time.  Love it.</li>
    <li> I travel quite a bit, so I stay away from razors that use cleaning/charging stands and/or special cleaning solutions.  I had used Braun razors for years, but many of their new razors had travel stands, which I did not want.  After reading numerous positive reviews, I decided to give Panasonic a try.  About two years ago, I bought a Panasonic ES-LT41-K.  While that razor worked well, I could never get more than 8 shaves out of a battery charge.  Rather than paying to pay for a second set of foils and blades, I decided to upgrade to a better Panasonic model.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This razor is absolutely fantastic.  The ES-LA63-S shaves even closer than my old Panasonic (both of which shave closer than my last Braun).  What&#x27;s really amazing is how many more shaves I get from a single charge.  With this new razor, I get 12 shaves from a single charge.  Interestingly, it not because the ES-LA63-S has a longer battery life, it&#x27;s because this new razor shaves so much faster.  The multi-pivoting head and the 4-blade system really seem to make a difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Fantastically close shave&lt;br /&gt;Displays the length of time for each shave&lt;br /&gt;Very easy to clean&lt;br /&gt;Shaves much faster than previous razors&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;None</li>
    <li> Outstanding shave, so easy to use, most enjoyable experience. Never had a foil shaver before. Definitely beats my last Norelco conventional model. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I give this razor 3 stars because it works, but that is about it. I am not very impressed with this razor at all. You have to go over areas over and over again since it is simply not very good. By far the worst electic razor I&#x27;ve ever owned.</li>
    <li> Provides a close shave especially when a little shave cream is used.  Easy to keep clean, just run under faucet without any cleaners or holders.  The head size is much more comfortable than the oversize Norelco 1255.  I bought the Norelco at Costco when they had a great deal, but the head is too big, is hard to clean,  and the shave was no better than my three year old Panasonic ES8103.  The Norelco went back to Costco and I bought the ES-63 here. Only bad thing - doesn&#x27;t get all the longer hairs.</li>
    <li> very nice shaver, very quick, does not miss spots, gives very close shave like a razor but a lot quicker.love it.</li>
    <li> I saw other reviews indicating that the display quit working after a short period of time.  My display quit working after 5 months. Looks as if water gets into the internal electronics.  Miss the battery level display and the reminder to perform the maintenance, but the shaver still performs.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had at least 10 electric razors. The best ones were good enough, but not as close as a razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is as close as a razor. I&#x27;m amazed. The holy grail of electric shavers. I can&#x27;t comment on reliability since I just got it but the feeling and results are a dramatic leap forward.</li>
    <li> Excellent. Design of this shaver is excellent and no other shaver even can come little close to this amazing machine.</li>
    <li> I have used Norelco triple header electric shavers for many many years and have seen the quality of that product deteriorate over the years as they have added more and more flimsy plastic parts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Panasonic is very sturdy and well built and is giving me a far far better shave than I ever achieved the the Norelco. I would heartily recommend it without reservation.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent shaver. It shaves as close as a blade. Very satisfied with my purchase, I hope it serves me as well as my old Braun.</li>
    <li> I had some history shaving. I have sensitive skin, courly hair and always issues with shaving. I had bough two Phillips/Norelco (not good enough), one Braun (worst of all) and this is my second Panasonic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I choose to continue with the Panny because the last one I used (3 years now on duty) only gave me great confidence a close and safe shave and keep working no matter the abuse. I never changed the blades nor the foil because Panasonic no longer sell shavers on my country (Chile). But I decided that I want to keep using the Panasonic shavers and pay for the replacemenet didn&#x27;t make sense since I have to import them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, the other brands don&#x27;t work for me, I need to import this top of the line model.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What can I say! it&#x27;s great, no issues, made in Japan! really fast (14000 rpm motor) very balanced. No risk for my skin. Great close Shave, awesome wet and dry functionallity and very easy to clean with regular soap and water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a shame that Panasonic is not doing it well on the market this days. The have allways made the best products on all categories (TVs, Audio (Technics brand), Shavers, etc.). I am sure that if they decide to stop making shavers I will buy 5 more and a ton of replacements to keep stock for the rest of my life! This brand has been the ONLY solution for my dayly  shaving problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My recommendation: BUY IT!</li>
    <li> Close shave.  Easy to use.  Doesn&#x27;t pull hairs.  Very good.  I&#x27;d recommend it.  Used a Norelco before and this is better.</li>
    <li> After years of bearded-ness b/c shaving tough whiskers is such a pain, I decided it was time for a new look.  For the last couple months I was using a $50 shaver from target and was getting a close shave, but getting bumps and redness esp on neck, so decided to try this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First couple days I thought about returning - it seemed like I got a closer shave w norelco!  But I persevered... and now 10 days later I am in love w this shaver.  Using it dry, getting a very nice shave and almost NO irritation.  I find that I need to apply a bit of pressure, but where there cheap shaver would have created all kinds of ouch, I can really work this one &#x27;till I&#x27;m smooth. :)</li>
    <li> This shaver leaves more shavings on your chest or T-shirt than what it collects in the shaver.I sent one back and they sent a new one and told me that&#x27;s the way it is .$135.00 thrown away in my book. It does give a good clean shave except for the mess.</li>
    <li> This is a fantastic shaver! I have used Norelco rotary shavers (high end, usually) for more years than I can remember--but the Panasonic provides the best shave I have ever gotten from an electric razor. With the Norelco, i frequently do multiple paases and use a blade in between to get a really close shave.If I have any stubble, the Norelco pulls and does not do  a good job. (Yes, I change the blades periodically.)The Panasonic takes everything in stride and does a perfect job every time. Buy it!!</li>
    <li> This is the best electric shaver that I have ever owned. I have thick beard and It gives a very clean shave compared to my old electric shavers.I had simple electric shavers in different brands like Philips, Braun, Remington and Whal. The only one which was giving a close and clean shave like Panasonic was Whal, but it was irritating my skin as well, but this is not a problem with this Panasonic.&lt;br /&gt;The Panasonic ES-LA63-S is a wet and dry shaver, so I can use it in the shower with even closer and cleaner shave. It holds the charge for about a week (I shave every day) and it is easy to clean.</li>
    <li> Best shave I have ever had.  Been using electric shavers for 15 years, this is way better than anything I&#x27;ve tried before</li>
    <li> Best shave I have ever had. No longer use straight razors or throw aways. This shaves closer than a razor although it takes about a month for your beard to adjust. I think it shaves closer as it starts beard growing straight out and razors lay the beard down. I always shave before bathing and i think this helps lubricate the shaving parts. No more five-o-clock shadow. This is my second ES-LA63. Last one lasted me about five years and battery was starting to not last as long. Normally I charge about every two weeks and shaving time is 4 to 6 minutes each time. Great for sensitive skin. I order replacement blades about every six months. When shaver starts to get warm as I shave, this tells me blades are dulling down. Tried  cheaper  electric razor first and it did not shave as well. This is an expensive shaver but worth every penny to me.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m an electric shaver lover. In fact, you might call me slightly obsessed with the devices (i.e. I have several). I like the Panasonic ES-LA63-S Arc4 for a few solid reasons:&lt;br /&gt;- it&#x27;s light&lt;br /&gt;- it&#x27;s easy to clean&lt;br /&gt;- it has a travel lock&lt;br /&gt;- it provides a smooth, comfortable shave&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To clean the shaver, simply apply a little liquid hand soap to the head, give a long press on the &amp;#34;On&amp;#34; button to activate the Turbo Clean and run it under hot tap water. When the Turbo switches off (about 20 seconds) remove the head and continue running the tap water onto the head of the shaver and inside the removed head (about 10 more seconds). Then simply shake off the excess water and leave to dry on the counter (I usually put it on top of a face cloth to absorb the water). About once a week I will spray Shaver Saver (either from Remington or Norelco) on the shaver&#x27;s head and run the shaver for about 20 seconds. This lubricates it and helps clean any mineral deposits from the tap water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Panasonic is a linear shaver that runs at 14,000 rpm (the fastest in class). It uses stainless steel blades on a swivel head that can be locked if desired. There are four blades, hence the Arc4 designation. The handle is ergonomic and therefore easily held whether over the sink or in the shower. Yes, you can use this shaver dry OR wet. I do not shave in the shower but on occasion I will shave &amp;#34;wet&amp;#34; over the sink by applying some shaving cream to my face. The resulting shave is extremely close and comfortable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only minor drawback is the size of the head which makes shaving the upper lip a bit cumbersome but certainly not impossible; it just requires a little patience. When we travel I always take the Panasonic with me since it is so easy to clean, light and has that travel lock.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Really, you cannot go wrong with a Panasonic shaver. This one is very affordable and one of the best foil shavers available today.</li>
    <li> great razor! I had earlier model in which the battery died. this one shaves as close as safety razor I used while waiting for this to be delivered. holds a longer charge and seems to get at the hairs under my neck  better. a slick razor. I also use Head  Slick , an over the counter lotion for shaving that provides a good  glide w/o any nicks or cuts. . I like fact I can use it as a wet razor.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always used Norelco in the past, although not in this price range.  The Panasonic is definitely different.  Shaving my upper lip requires going sideways rather than vertically to avoid snagging hairs, but it works fine that way.  It gives a very close shave dry.  I haven&#x27;t tried it with lotion yet.</li>
    <li> This Panasonic shaver definitely provides a great shave.  I&#x27;ve been using it for the past month and it has worked fantastic so far.</li>
    <li> It is easy to use, energy saving, although a little noise, the shaving results is very clean，my husband loves it.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a shaver to use on the mornings when I did not want to waste the time with using a regular razor.  Found this on a one day special and I am very happy with the shaver.  It does not cut as close as a regular razor but it does just perfect when I wake up late for a tee time and have to hurry to make it to the course on time.  The big test is that my wife likes the results better than my old Remington shaver and that&#x27;s what counts.</li>
    <li> the shaver part is awesome, works better than any other ive bought. but i have only bought ones under $80. being able to clean it under soap and water while running is a big plus. i removed a star only because the battery life is short i can get 4-6 shaves with it. its ok for home use, but if i went on a week long trip, i would have to pack the charger too.</li>
    <li> Great everyday razor that has held up longer than any other razor that I have purchased.  Relatively quiet and comfortable.</li>
    <li> Great macine, close shaving!!! I had a braun before and this one is mush better.&lt;br /&gt;Very strong battery and nice design</li>
    <li> This shaver is great. Beats the hell out of the Remington that died on me. Good shave, easy to use ... what else is there!</li>
    <li> I bought this last year and I think it&#x27;s the best shaver I&#x27;ve owned thus far.  The shaver head is kinda big but it does a great job of getting close without cutting my skin. It hasn&#x27;t irritated my face but I&#x27;ve been using an electric shaver for a while now.  This Panasonic has been a great shaver and that&#x27;s compared to my last Braun 8585.  And, I don&#x27;t have to pay for those cleaning refills!  That&#x27;s a plus!  I simply clean it after shaving by running the faucet.  Yeah, I don&#x27;t get that lemony scent but I also don&#x27;t have to pay $5 per cleaning refill and then figure out what to do with the refill container and leftover liquid.  So easy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Battery lasts me at least a whole week of shaving and recharging is pretty quick.  Only negative I&#x27;ve encountered is the flip-up trimmer.  For me, it&#x27;s not easy to slide the switch up to lock the trimmer.  Other than that, it&#x27;s been perfect!</li>
    <li> I finally found the one. This shaver is the best one I&#x27;ve ever had. it&#x27;s very good. Definitely worth the price and more</li>
    <li> I needed to purchase a new electric shaver because my old Braun 360 Complete battery was dying.  I had planned on buying another Braun because of the durability of the German built unit.... but after finding they discontinued my past model, and reading mixed reviews on it&#x27;s replacement - many of which rated the new Braun 7 Series poorly.... I decided to go with the Panasonic ES-LA63-S Arc 4.  Many Braun users seemed to be returning their 7 series in favor of the Panasonic, because they were disappointed in the cut and quality of the new Brauns.... and then raved about the Panasonic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway - I too am a believer.... so much more ergonomic to hold and use and it&#x27;s definitely quieter.  The shave is super close and comfortable.  What else can I say?  I love it.  Wish the blade and foil replacement parts were cheaper - because I see that they are kind of on the pricey side.... but, hey, you gotta pay if you wanna play.</li>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t allowed to use blade razor due to health related infection concerns due to cancer treatments so bought this razor.  I&#x27;ve always used blades due to thick stiff beard and I&#x27;ve been very surprised how well this razor has handled my beard!</li>
    <li> Only used this three days but love it, love it, love it.  Close shave- better than the Braun.  Like not having to buy the cartridges to clean the razor.  Just swish in a bit of hot water and detergent- less expensive to use too.  Braun model needed the blades changed every 6-9 months and the replacement was over $40.  This has replacements for less than a third of that.  Hope it holds up over time.</li>
    <li> The best electric shaver you&#x27;ll ever buy for the money.  Plus, the replacement razors are inexpensive.  You can&#x27;t go wrong with this product.  Whether you enjoy dry shaving or wet shaving;  this product does both with fantastic results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My friend is looking to buy a new foil razor.  I&#x27;ll be telling him to get this one.  If he doesn&#x27;t absolutely love it, I&#x27;ll buy it from him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll definitely purchase this product again!</li>
    <li> Decent deal for 1/3 the price of the arc5.&lt;br /&gt;Spring in head is too weak, so it doesn&#x27;t ever actually swivel.&lt;br /&gt;Misses a lot a hairs.&lt;br /&gt;Causes ingrown hairs just as much as any other shaver.&lt;br /&gt;Trimmer is useless for anything. Had to get a second trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;Incessant blinking is a terrible idea. Had to cover display with electrical tape.&lt;br /&gt;I should have gone for the 5. Perhaps they&#x27;ve corrected for those issues. Oh well, it&#x27;s too late now.</li>
    <li> This is a high quality shaver which works very well wet or dry.&lt;br /&gt;The only shortcoming is that it is quite large in size.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s been over a year since this purchase and I remain very pleased with the performance of this product. It is quick charging, provides numerous shaves between charges, works great dry and even better wet, the trimmer is fine for sideburns, the blades have yet to dull, and it&#x27;s very easy to clean and maintain. Other brands may also provide the same results but I will likely never know that firsthand because this electric shaver is a keeper.</li>
    <li> I read reviews on all brands, and settled on this one. I have used it only once. One side of my face dry and the other side wet with shaving cream. I prefer wet. It glides over my face with ease.&lt;br /&gt;I had used a Braun as a supplement to the blade until I could not get new foil cutters for it. The Panasonic is much more comfortable to use, and I will use it without interchanging with a blade.&lt;br /&gt; I only regret that it is chargeable. I would prefer one that operates like my old Braun-straight to 110v plug in.</li>
    <li> really good shaver, delighted with my purchase. It gets a nice and close shave and doesn&#x27;t irritate at all. Top notch!</li>
    <li> I think it is a great deal to me (i bought it at usd 89.99), No doubts the quality is very good.</li>
    <li> Very pleased and a little surprised by this razor. Have used Gillette 5 blade razors for years with complete satisfaction, but finally ran out of coupons and discounts. Tried Remmington King of Shaves to save some money. Those looked similar to the Gillette blades, but are not nearly as sharp after a couple of shaves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I&#x27;m camping for a few days on a military base and dreading the thought of shaving at 5:30 AM, in the dark, with cold water and my dull blades. I have a coarse, dark beard and wanted to look presentable amongst the clean-shaven soldiers at breakfast, but just couldn&#x27;t bring myself to shave. Hearing the buzz of an electric razor reminded me that there were other options.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried electric razors in the past, but always given up after a month or two because I always ended up with a 5-oclock shadow. Tried Remmington, Braun, Norelco and Phillips over the years. With the pricey Brauns out now, I began to think that the electrics must be improved or folks wouldn&#x27;t pay so much for them. After online research, the high reviews of the Panasonic Nanotech, I decided to give it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only reservation about this shaver was the clunky looking head. I was drawn to the reviews about the close shave, wet or dry options and the charge indicator which shows percent of charge remaining. After using it for a month, I must say I&#x27;m extremely pleased. Shaves are close, comfortable and it doesn&#x27;t get too hot or require a zillion passes to get a great shave. The pop-up trimmer is great for sideburns. The clunky looking head has a purpose, it pivots and eases shaving your lower jaw and neck. Didn&#x27;t hurt that the pricing was less than the Braun and that cleaning is fast and easy with running water rather than cleaning solutions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re considering giving up blades, I&#x27;d highly recommend this shaver as an alternative.</li>
    <li> Use this for face and head - Great dry or wet shaving and is reasonably close for an electric. get about 10 facial uses per charge, 5 if doing both head/face.</li>
    <li> Not as good as I expected. My Braun 7 series is slightly outperform the ES-LA63-S&lt;br /&gt;Quality and finishing are top notch</li>
    <li> I was used to my norelco shaver which is smaller in size. This shaver is larger is size. I do prefer the smaller shaver. The panasonic does give a nice shave but my norelco did a nice job when it was new. I purchased the panasonic on a recomendation of a friend. He is still my friend !.  Nice shaver though! 4 stars.</li>
    <li> I got away from using electric shavers a long time ago because none of them seemed to get the job done well enough. I took a chance on this Panasonic shaver, and I really couldn&#x27;t be happier with a shaver. I can vouch for when they say &amp;#34;use wet or dry&amp;#34;, that you really can use it wet or dry. Wet with shaving gel provides the closest shave, and it gets closer than any shaver I&#x27;ve used before. It works really well for a dry shave, too, except when it is humid or steamy in the bathroom and then it kind of sticks to the skin a little.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is also super easy to clean. You definitely don&#x27;t need to clean it every time you shave. Most days I just run water over it and it&#x27;s good to go. When I use shaving gel, I use a little liquid soap and cool water, and the blades and the guard look brand new!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This thing also charges ridiculously fast. It can go from a 10% charge to 100% in less than an hour. That is really convenient when you need a shave and don&#x27;t have hours to wait!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this is a great shaver for the price! I would recommend this, and will be buying another Panasonic in this shaver family when I need another one.</li>
    <li> Bad from the start Burned my facial beard and nick, left red welts all over my face, Please don&#x27;t talk about the cleaning function I know about the high speed for that.  I wouldn&#x27;t give this to my worst enemy, it&#x27;s that bad.</li>
    <li> The razor rips the skin.  It cut my neck badly.&lt;br /&gt;Also, it sounds like a motor boat.  The whole house can hear it.&lt;br /&gt;I do not recommend this product</li>
    <li> It is truly an amazing razor. Though I still use a blade to shave the top of my head and some high precision areas.</li>
    <li> I have tried many different electric razors, and this model is by far the most consistent and closest to shave of them all.</li>
    <li> Got this razor for my husband and he likes it.</li>
    <li> Seriously one of the best purchases I have ever made. I have a fairly thick beard but sensitive skin so everything else (Remington, Norelco, and multiple brands of razors) gave me razor burn and/or ingrown hairs. This shaver didn&#x27;t even cause me any problems with the first two week &amp;#34;adjustment period.&amp;#34; I highly, highly recommend this shaver.</li>
    <li> Awesome, best shaver I ve owned and I have owned quite a few, read about this machine on Top Ten Reviews and trust mi its good</li>
    <li> Worth the extra money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got it on a pretty good sale.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t have paid full price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Almost every guy I know is unhappy with his electric razor if he paid more than $100.  But if you get this one for less than $100, you&#x27;ll probably feel you got your money&#x27;s worth.  I do.</li>
    <li> I have had 3 previous Panasonic wet/dry shavers. In general, the linear blade design is superior to others I have tried. This model is a disappointment. Shaver head is so wide that for the contoured part of the face, only 1 side is cutting. The center part of the shave head doesn&#x27;t really do any shaving. This makes shaving take longer. After a couple months it is causing skin irritation. Battery life is also short. I get 4 maybe 5 shaves in 1 charge. I wish I could return it but I went over 30 days. I recommend the ES8103 or ES8109 models. Lower price, shaves in less time, gets just as close with no skin irritation.</li>
    <li> I am 47 years of age and been using a blade to shave for my entire life.  However, when considering the cost of a package of 16 Gillette Mach 3 Razors (about $35), I have found myself shaving every other day just to save money on buying refills.  Fortunately my face can tolerate a shave every other day without looking overly scruffy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;...but I wanted that clean-shaved look day in and day out and figured that perhaps switching over to an electric razor may be a better alternative, saving me money on blade replacements in the long run.  I would have never really considered going electric with the bad reputation such razors have had -- but I do think there have been great strides made in electric razor technology over the past decade.  When I heard about the Panasonic Nanotech shaver in a radio commercial I decided to take a look at the many reviews posted here on Amazon.  I was shocked at how much praise there was for this razor.  I just had to try it out for myself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I didn&#x27;t rush into this review.  I knew that I had to give my face 3 weeks to adapt from blade to electric.  So, I am giving you an assessment of the Panasonic ES-LA63 now three weeks post purchase where I have shaved just about every day since.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My initial reaction to using the Panasonic Nanotech shaver is that it&#x27;s extremely comfortable.  Its wide head covers a lot of area and to date I have never felt any pulling of hairs whatsoever.  No doubt, the experience of using an electric over a razor is more preferable as far as comfort and ease.  You never need to press down hard with the electric shaver (in fact you shouldn&#x27;t) and there is never the fear of cutting one&#x27;s self  (though I never regularly cut myself with the Gillette blade).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used the Panasonic both wet and dry.  I suppose I somewhat prefer to use it wet along with KING OF SHAVES ALPHA GEL which is sold here on Amazon and I HIGHLY recommend.  A minute amount of gel goes a long way and really adds comfort to the shave.  The only thing I noticed is that the shave seems to get better 5 minutes in as the skin and gel dries as there is more direct contact with the skin.  In essence, I think the dry shave gets you closer but I do love the initial lubrication that the shaving gel provides.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No doubt, this electric razor gives you a shave that is as close as a razor.  I run my fingers across my cheek and it feels super smooth as if just shaved with a blade. That being said, the Panasonic doesn&#x27;t do the job nearly as well across the entire area of the face and neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let me go back to the first day of using this razor so you can see how far I have progressed in three weeks....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On my first day, I used this razor dry.  I immediately got close, blade results across my face.  However, I found patches of unshaved hair where the face curves right below the ears towards the neck.  And the neck itself was a mess.  I had to repeatedly run the Panasonic across these areas several times, pulling the skin tight in order to achieve the best results.  My neck became red and bumpy from repeated passovers.  Initial total shave time was more than 6 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Three weeks later I would say the results have improved somewhat.  I have gotten my shave time down to 5.5 minutes.  I am getting more used to the problem areas that need more attention.  I&#x27;m doing a better job getting the side curves of my face below the ear.  However, I still have to put considerable effort into doing several passes to get small patches in the corners of my face..  The neck hasn&#x27;t really improved with the exception that it doesn&#x27;t nearly get as red and bumpy as it used to.  I can get 90% of all the stubble off my neck but there is always small areas that the razor just won&#x27;t cut and that I have to attend to with a dry blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ultimately, the problem with this electric razor is that you&#x27;ll still need to use a quick dry blade to pass over areas of your face and neck to do the job perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For instance, I have a goatee.  The Panasonic ES-LA63 does a good job of trimming around the goatee even with its large head.  I just turn it sideways and shave up and down along the goatee line.  However, it doesn&#x27;t do a good job of giving the goatee line definition.  For that I have to follow up with a razor just to define the line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Panasonic features a display which alerts you of remaining charge level and total shaving time.  Unfortunately the display goes off once you start the shave but comes back on as soon as you turn the shaver off.  There is supposedly an indicator letting you know when you need to clean the shaver.  I have yet to reach that point yet.  However, the Panasonic seems very easy to clean.  I always remove the cover and run water through the foil and blades after every shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been able to get about 6 6-minute shaves before the razor needs recharge.  My immediate concern is how many charges this baby is going to continually allow me before the battery goes sour and it has to be replaced.  I suppose if I get two years out of this Panasonic shaver before that happens I will have gotten my money&#x27;s worth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONCLUSION&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this Panasonic razor.  I so much prefer using it over a blade.  Even when it using it with gel and water I find it to be a much more satisfying shaving experience than using blade and water.  Using it dry is even better because you don&#x27;t have to deal with cleaning up the sink full of shaving cream and water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, I find it hard to believe that anyone is having completely satisfactory results using an electric razor over a blade.  Yes, the Panasonic does shave as close as a blade across the face.  However, when it comes to the neck and lower sides of the face, you aren&#x27;t going to see perfection.  Even looking at my neck minutes after shaving, I see specks of hair all over the place that the razor just could not cut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everyone&#x27;s face is different so I suppose I am part of the unfortunate sect that are going to have difficulty with the neck area.  Perhaps my face still has not completely adapted to the electric razor.  However, judging by some of the reviews I have read I know that the neck area can be a real problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Was this a good purchase?  Absolutely.  I love to shave with this thing.  Just have to accept the fact that I have not rid myself of the blade completely.  The Panasonic accomplishes 90% of the task but I still have to do a very quick dry swipe of the blade over certain areas of the neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: Now one week later (a full four weeks) I am seeing improved results in the neck area.  Can it be?  Is the Panasonic actually doing a good job on the neck?  It seems so.  I suppose the neck area took a little longer to adapt to an electic razor than the face area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am convinced that I will never go back to a blade again.  I love using an electric.  For all of you who are making the switch from blade to motor, just give your face 3 weeks and your neck and additional week to adjust.  It&#x27;s amazing how close this baby shaves.  Just hope this razor lasts at least 2 years.ee.  The Panasonic ES-LA63 does a good job of trimming around the goatee even with its large head.

    <li> After reviewing all of the electric shavers on the market, I decided to buy the Panasonic ES-LA63. I was not disappointed. It met every feature that was claimed and gave me the closest, cleanest without any skin irritation. I admit it took a week for my skin to get used to the new shaver and get optimum performance, but I&#x27;ve never had a better shave. Thanks, Panasonic.</li>
    <li> Up until now I&#x27;d gotton by with a cheap electric shaver.  When I noticed the ES-LA63 as a gold box special on amazon with a $30 mail in rebate it was too good of a deal to pass up.  This shaver is amazing.  It gives me a great shave even after not shaving for 3-4 days.  It&#x27;s motor powers through the thick chin hair without much of a problem.  It does a preatty decent job on the neck as well, although like all electric shavers it requires multiple passes in multiple directions.  It shaves really close and the LED display is a great touch as well.  I only have used it to dry shave so I can&#x27;t comment on how it works with cream or in the shower.  I hope that the blades and foils last a long time because replacement ones aren&#x27;t very cheap.  I&#x27;ve used this product for ~2 months now. A+ Product!</li>
    <li> Very close shave.  I have been using Norelco since when I started shaving, and was reluctant to try anything different.  The Panasonic gives a much closer shave with less irritation.  I feel much more comfortable shaving around the neck area with the Panasonic than my old shaver.  The dual pivot head allows it to hug my face very well.    And cleaning up is a breeze.  I&#x27;d recommend it.</li>
    <li> I received the shaver about 2 months ago.  The first shave was the best I&#x27;ve ever had. The ES-LA63 is a bit large in size than I&#x27;m used to but not overly so. I realy like the larger shaving head. Cleaning is very easy and a charge is quite fast. Best shaver I&#x27;ve purchased in the last 10 yrs.</li>
    <li> excellent shaver.  5-6minute comfortable &amp; very close shave.  works very well with shaver pre-shave oil.  delivery to UK efficient. a real bargain.</li>
    <li> What can I say; Braun user since 1985; Have used 4 Braun models averaging 5-7 years each; prices have risen dramatically on Braun shavers (last model, $70 Walmart, entry price today about $130-$150 for a 5 series model). Also very anti- the cleaning/soaking base - more $ to lay out for something that a quick shake into the sink takes care of.  Figured if I have to pay that much dough, I should be more shrewd and see the lay of the land. Have had good experiences with Panasonic phones and Plasma TV, so read reviews on Panasonic shavers, saw this model, took the plunge. A shave that used to take 4-5 minutes is over and done, closer and with less fanfare, in 2 minutes, dry.  All while sipping bourbon with the other hand. Charges faster, lighter, great ergonomics. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!</li>
    <li> After 2 years it still works great. Smooth and clean shave every time.</li>
    <li> A little bulky but I like it.</li>
    <li> I have tried several electric shavers in the past few months and have been disappointed in the ones I purchased previously.  Had to return them all because they did not work very well.  This Panasonic has been great, providing close efficient shaves.  I couldn&#x27;t be more satisfied.  I would highly recommend this shaver to everyone.</li>
    <li> I have been looking for an electric shaver for years that would do the job it is supposed to. Year ago, I had Remington shavers with the same shaver head as this one that worked wonderfully. I tried the Philips rotary shavers, but could never get a clean shave. This one works wonderfully with William Lectric Shave.</li>
    <li> Buy it for my freind and with the review that it&#x27;s better than Braun&#x27;s and quite cheaper than Bruan&#x27;s. He loves it!</li>
    <li> This shaver exceeded my expectations. Previously I had used the Norelco cordless 3 head but two died on me, so I went back to the razor.. have long been a two-blade razor guy, but I got tired of the scrapes and cuts and the time required.  But I decided to give this a shot.  I think it shaves closer than a blade in half the time.  It is a snap to clean in water.  Now I do not have to buy blades or foam or gel. It is also very quiet.  The 14,000 rpm is what gives it the smooth shave.  Really, I cannot gush enough about this Panasonic ES-LA63-S.  Give it a try.  You will not forget it.</li>
    <li> I have a heavy beard and have always had an electric razor for touch ups. They have never worked for my full morning shave.  This one does!  You can use dry or even better with gel.  Gives a close 24 hour shave. Awesome.</li>
    <li> I tried both Panasonic ES-LA63-S and Braun 790 and here is what I found after using Panasonic ES-LA63-S  for a month and another month using Braun 790.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Panasonic makes little more noise compared to Braun but in terms of closeness of shave, panasonic definitely has an edge over braun.&lt;br /&gt;2. Cost of Panasonic shaver is atleast 50 dollars cheaper than Braun.&lt;br /&gt;3. Maintenance of Panasonic model is cheaper than Braun model, panasonic requires soap to clean while braun keeps on displaying low hygiene level which can only improve after charging on braun cleaning system using a cartridge. I guess this is how Braun guys make money after selling. Need to spend atleast 5 dollars/month for cartridge&#x27;s vs panasonic zero cost.&lt;br /&gt;4. Overall any shaver has to perform the basic functionality i.e provide close shave, which panasonic exceeds over braun.</li>
    <li> What a great surprise! Quiet and shaves MUCH better than my old razor. Very comfortable shave...perhaps it&#x27;s the faster motor speed.</li>
    <li> Tried this in place of years of rotary shaver.  It takes much longer to shave and still does not get as close as rotary. I tried it wet and dry.  A little better wet but still not as close as rotary.</li>
    <li> Very good shaver. Nice improvement over 8229.&lt;br /&gt;the only drawback is much bigger head size. Sometimes not very comfotable to shave small parts of the face. But you can become accustomed to this.</li>
    <li> This is a great improvement from the previous 3-blade shaver I used before, a much closer shave and a much smoother skin.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t shave as well as the older panasic models. Still it does s decent shave takes as long as manually shaving with Razer.</li>
    <li> My Remington finally died.  After looking at reviews here I bought this over  a Braun.  Wow is all I can say about the first couple of shaves.</li>
    <li> I ordered 2 of these razors for my teenage boys.  They just love them. Easy to clean. Can use it wet or dry. Very close shave.  Hold a charge for a long time. Excellent razor!</li>
    <li> I bought this to replace my old razor and to try it out as a wet razor.  It shaves very cleanly either wet or dry.  I&#x27;m totally satisfied.  As to the negative reviews about how easy it is to damage the cutters or the screen - I&#x27;ve had no problem.  There is a plastic head cover which provides total protection.  As long as it is in place the screens are protected from damage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is annoying that the razor will not function when plugged in but it is what it is and not an issue as long as you don&#x27;t totally discharge the unit.  Simply looking at the indicator will tell you about how much charge is left so you don&#x27;t really have any excuse for not charging it up before it goes dead!</li>
    <li> Prior to this shaver, I had used a Phillips 2D Sensotouch shaver. The main problem I had with this shaver was the irritation it caused especially on my neck - every shave cause my neck to turn red and sometimes caused cuts. So with my purchase of this Panasonic, I was really looking for something that was much gentler on my face. 1 year later, here are some pro&#x27;s and con&#x27;s of what I&#x27;ve found.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- Overall, the shaver is MUCH gentler on my face! Occasionally there are some problem spots on my face that require me going over the area a good number of times and this often causes a little irritation, but nothing as bad as with my previous shaver.&lt;br /&gt;- The design of the shaver fits really well in my hand and is very comfortable to use!&lt;br /&gt;- Travel case is pretty nice. It&#x27;s not incredibly amazing, but it looks nice and seems pretty durable. Definitely handy when going on vacation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- The mechanism used to open the trimmer is not at all easy to engage. Sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn&#x27;t, seeming like it is locked in place. Not a huge issue for me, as I don&#x27;t use it much, but it can be an inconvenience.&lt;br /&gt;- The battery life for this shaver leaves much to be desired. Personally, I don&#x27;t get more than about 4-5 days of usage before the battery is dead, which is less than my previous shavers. Not awful, but if you forget to bring the charger on a trip, you might be in trouble.</li>
    <li> Wonderful. Have to shave my disabled husband and it has been taking so long and the results were not good.  With this one, it takes about 4 minutes and is the closest to shave with a manual razor we have had yet.  Absolutely recommend this razor.</li>
    <li> This Shaver&#x27;s LED screen does not work for more than a month.  I was just sent a replacement shaver because the LED screen would not display meaningful data.  The replacement worked for one month and now the LED screen again displays garbage.  From now on I may just use the $13 Panasonic travel shaver which gives as good a shave and doesn&#x27;t pretend to have a LED screen.</li>
    <li> always used razors to shave in the past this Panasonic  Electric shaver is great does an excellent job.</li>
    <li> Very quality electric shaver. I am very happy with what i bough :)</li>
    <li> You know, most of us men have to shave every day (unless we are retired, have a beard, or some disease that prevents facial hair), so one might as well have the cadallic on the market (or close).  This shaver is not perfect; there are a few things that slightly bug me:  first, the head is so big, it is difficult to get just under your nose with the shaver (but not impossible); second, it doesn&#x27;t do all that well with a dry shave and I have had a couple of times of mild razor burn (when wet, that is never a problem).    So, you wonder, why did I give it four stars?  First, it really does shave well in the wet mode, almost all of your face, and it even does a good job on my neck area (most shavers I have used fail the neck test).  You can use it wet or dry; I have always used a shaver dry, but I tried this one with water and shaving cream; it worked all right, maybe a tish better than dry shaving (and there is no chance of razor burn) Third, this unit is super easy to clean; you can put some suds on the foil, turn it on to turbo (just keep start button down for 20 seconds or less), and it will clean the unit.  You can pop the head off and also use this cleaning feature.  You can use water while you are cleaning it.  It always comes out sparkling clean (and cleaning doesn&#x27;t take but a few seconds).  Some people moan about you can&#x27;t shave with the shaver plugged in; you must have the shaver unplugged; this is a safety feature because you can shave with this unit in water (like in a shower or wherever), and Panasonic doesn&#x27;t want you to get electrocuted.  But they have a digital readout telling you how much juice is left.  When you get down to around 20%, you just plug it in.  When it gets charged (like under an hour), a green light flashes, telling you it is fully charged.  Hey, it&#x27;s great!  I have used Braun for years, and I even tried a Remington (nice shave but very cheap units), so I graduated up to this unit.  I hope to have this for many years without problems.  So far, great product.  I know this product isn&#x27;t cheap, but at least you are getting quality for your money.  It even feels like a well made unit in your hand.  When you look at the inside (underneath the foil cover), you see metal and quality,  not junk and cheapness.  If any problems develop, I will come back to this review and comment. I have updated and altered my shaver review.  After having it a couple of months, I am not as impressed; it doesn&#x27;t really shave as well as my cheap Remington dry.  Wet, it works well, but I prefer a dry shave as I like to look at the mirror when I shave.  Yes, you can do that, but it is messy with water and soap everywhere.</li>
    <li> Great product. Shave is pretty deep and completely harmless. If anyone is looking to buy this I have an extra open box Panasonic ES-LA63-S Arc4 that is completely clean at a much lower price. (by student.sellers)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/gp/offer-listing/B00HHE44A4/ref&#x3D;dp_olp_used?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;condition&#x3D;used</li>
    <li> The best electric shave I&#x27;ve ever had.  Easy to use and easy to clean.</li>
    <li> I never thought an electric shaver would be better than a high end four blade saftey razor, but its true.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After two months of use I would never shave with a blade again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This will roll over a zit without causing too much irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It will still cause razor burn around my adams apple if I am not careful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The head of the shaver is large and would not be good for precise shaving.</li>
    <li> So far so good best I&#x27;ve own. Let&#x27;s see how long  it going to last. Very close shave. use it with a cream. and wont irritate your skin. I use Mary Kay men shaving cream which is awesome.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 78 years old, which means I&#x27;ve been shaving for a long time. I started with a double blade Gillette razor (something most of you have never seen) and spent most of my life using a Norelco electric shaver. Nothing I have ever used even comes close to this Panasonic shaver. It&#x27;s the most comfortable, easiest to use shaver I&#x27;ve ever had. Wish it had existed when I was 40 years younger, but I&#x27;m very glad to have it for what I hope will be the  next 20 years of my life.</li>
    <li> I found this shaver quieter and shave much closer than my Braun.  I have owned the Braun for  few years and find that the shave was only close after about a 3 months after I changed the blades.  So far the shave is close and with no irration to the face.  I have owned the shaver for a 2 weeks and have used the shaver every day and the charge is 50%.  Good battery as of this writing.</li>
    <li> Having owned a number of Braun shavers prior to buying the Panasonic, I may need to consider myself an old dog with the new trick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just don&#x27;t seem to get under my nose the way that I could with the Braun shavers. The shaving head is much wider than I am used to and I just don&#x27;t feel the control. The head of the Panasonic moves easily to meet the contours of your face, which is great everywhere - except under my nose!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everything else about the shaver is excellent and certainly lives up to my expectations. The battery life is excellent!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If Braun continues to be difficult to find and service in my area - when the foil needs to be replaced it seems like the store that I bought the razor from does not support the old model, only the new. There oughta be a law!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If the Panasonic lasts well then I may buy another one - or if it lasts really well, I may not have to!</li>
    <li> This is the 4th Panasonic razor I&#x27;ve had and it is too bulky and is inferior to past Panasonic I&#x27;m owned. I took the protective cover off (not the plastic one) and it does better. I ordered a new blade and foil for my old one after I received this one and it does a better,smoother job. I do not recommend this razor.</li>
    <li> My old Braun Series 7 Shaver was getting rusty. Having read the Gizmodo reviews on shavers, I decided to try out different ones (taking advantage of various money back guarantees). I tried a Philips SensoTouch 3D model (all of their shavers in the same series perform the same way. Only differences are bundled products and maybe the finish of the product) initially. It felt very smooth, the shaver looked great and was quiet. But I could never get it to shave close, wet or dry. Braun Series 7 was on sale at Walmart, so I bought one and kept it in a box. Since I had Braun before, I knew how it performed. I wanted to try Panasonic, after reading mostly positive reviews. The shaver is great! It&#x27;s the closest shave I&#x27;ve ever gotten. With either Braun or Philips, I would have grown 5 o&#x27;clock shadow by later in the afternoon. With this one, it&#x27;s the next morning. But it doesn&#x27;t look as sleek as the other models, and do not come with a stand, which is a bummer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- Closest shave (compared to Braun or Philips) both wet and dry&lt;br /&gt;- Very easy to clean (will save money, not buying those cleaning solutions, which is a must for Braun)&lt;br /&gt;- Feels great in hand and nice carrying case too&lt;br /&gt;- Affordable vs. comparable Braun or Philips&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- Prices do fluctuate a lot, which few reviewers have already mentioned&lt;br /&gt;- Silver model does not look as nice as Braun or Philips units&lt;br /&gt;- No stand. It just lies on your bathroom counter.&lt;br /&gt;- I&#x27;ve also had few nicks and cuts. Maybe it cuts too close.&lt;br /&gt;- Only 30 day trial period - which wasn&#x27;t big deal, because it cut close from day 1.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, very satisfied. Panasonic makes solid everything, it seems...</li>
    <li> My last razor was a Panasonic also but it was 10 years old so this one is great compared to that.  Haven&#x27;t used it wet yet hope it&#x27;s as good as the old one.</li>
    <li> Great shave, no Irritation, and EASY TO CLEAN&lt;br /&gt;I have been shaving for &gt; 25 years, and have had several shavers.&lt;br /&gt;I was wary of Panasonic, they are not as well known as Braun.&lt;br /&gt;My last was a $300 Braun 3 series, complete with the cleaning station, which does not work at all.&lt;br /&gt;The major reason for purchasing Panasonic was VERY SIMPLE, it has a detachable foil from the Inner blades, and easy to clean either with a brush daily, or under the tap with some hand cleaning lotion.&lt;br /&gt;other than that, the shave is easy, its like vacuuming your face !  a great shave, I only have to go round my face once, so no irritation to my neck like before with Braun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Braun Issues:  This may sound illogical to some of you, but when you shave daily, and you simply cannot clean your shaver foil and blade, it gets blocked, blunt, and smells.  Washing under the tap, and even the cleaning station do not work.  I bought many of the brand new cleaning fluids for Braun and they don&#x27;t work.  I bought new $25 foil/blade combos every 3 months to fix the issue, which is expensive.  The idea of a combo foil and blade does not work, and Braun need to rethink quickly as they have designed an inferior product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*** Feedback report now after several months of use&lt;br /&gt;The Pana is just FANTASTIC.  its like vacuuming your face !  And with the ability to take apart the foil from the blade and clean with a small brush after each use is HUGE.  Braun made a real mistake in a combo blade/foil as you just cannot clean it.  I LOVE my Pana.</li>
    <li> The shaver works fine, bettery than my old Norelco.  Unfortunately the LCD screen died.In spite of this the shaver performs as expected.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my better half, and he is very happy with it. Says it is the best electric razor he&#x27;s ever had.</li>
    <li> Every guy&#x27;s face and beard are different, which makes reading and evaluating reviews difficult. I have the awesome combo of extraordinarily thick and tough whiskers with an incredibly sensitive face. Blade or electric, I can&#x27;t shave everyday because it tears my face up (seriously). Even more fun, I&#x27;m more than a little OCD so when I shave I will grind and shave until my face and neck are *smooth*. So I need a shaver that can handle my stubble on two to three days of growth without destroying my face or being too painful. The Panasonic ES-LA63 was great! I only used it wet, and the large head (and it is large) was not a problem for me. I loved it! Totally five stars, even though it&#x27;s true the battery life is not great and it is loud as a lawn mower, but I didn&#x27;t care about that if I got the things I was looking for. Not only did I, but got as good a shave as with a blade with less pain and skin irritation. Then it started to crap out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I bought this on Amazon, I had read about the LCD going out problem, and I found advice online on how to use and care for the shaver so that wouldn&#x27;t happen. It happened anyway. Into my second year of use (early 2012) the LCD display went out. Okay, that was irritating but not a deal breaker. I would rate it three, maybe four stars at that point, because by then I basically knew how often I needed to charge it and that sort of thing. I didn&#x27;t really *need* the LCD display, and it was still shaving Nirvana for me. But then a couple months later the shaver stopped holding a charge at all, at which point it became an expensive paper weight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want to gamble on the LCD/no-charge problem not happening to you, go for it. It&#x27;s a great wet shaver when it&#x27;s working. Just be advised that this could happen to you.</li>
    <li> The outer packing is like the old, damaged seriously, unlike new.shiping  is rapidly,.I am very disappointed, because I was bought as a gift.</li>
    <li> It worked as well as my previous Panasonic razor. Only downside is the size of the head. A little large and clunky.</li>
    <li> There&#x27;s a note inside the box that tells you that if it does not shave perfectly when you first get it, keep shaving with it for at least a month and your opinion will change.  Well that happened to me and I was glad I kept with it for the month, as it seems to have adjusted somehow to my face/beard  and now I regard this shave as the best I have ever owned.</li>
    <li> For 3 decades, I have been using sensitive skin disposable green razors-shave in the shower. Occasionally id try an electric rotary-different brands did not matter, would shred my skin type-elastic(?) Tried this foil type-did the 30 day trial period……love it/no more sensitive skin disposable green razors-fantastic. can shave on the go!!!&lt;br /&gt;Way too many purchase options-so I figured stay around 100 bucks. Panasonic always rates top on consumer reports</li>
    <li> I have enjoyed using this razor for almost 2 years, using it as a &amp;#34;pre-shave&amp;#34; before I cleaned up with a regular blade. I usually use it in the shower, and it really does a surprisingly good job for an electric. I highly doubt any electric razor can get as close as a regular blade, but this is pretty darn good. The trimmer portion is fair, and really not all that useful to me. Battery life is good and the razor charges pretty quickly. VERY odd that the instructions actually say to THROW THE RAZOR AWAY if you lose or damage the charging cord... WHAT? No replacement? Bizarre. All that said, after not quite 2 years, the display has taken a dive. This is more than slightly annoying, especially in a razor in this price range. If it held up it would have gotten 4 stars easily.</li>
    <li> This worked just fine for me. It shaved close, and performed well. It didn&#x27;t pull at my hairs, and it was quicker than using a blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, it caused me to break out on the side of my lips. I&#x27;m guess that&#x27;s more of a personal issue, and not an issue with the product itself.</li>
    <li> Shaves close and fast.  Motor holds speed when the battery is low.  Quiet motors.  Much closer shave than my previous electric shaver.</li>
    <li> Very good, I like, thank you</li>
    <li> This is a gift for my friend, and I am not supposed to open it. But the package arrived to be intact.</li>
    <li> Not as good as expected. Does not have 4 blades as ads appear to claim.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m only marginally satisfied with this product.  I have a very light beard and most electric razors do a good job for me.  I really have to work my neck over with this one to get a decent shave.  Does great on cheeks, chin, mustache.</li>
    <li> I have used it for 9 months and it still gives a close shave.  I shave with it after showering and have a dry face; I have not tried it wet.  I give the shaving part a 5 star. The size of the head does not bother me, it took several days to adjust to the larger size.  My trimmer is very hard to open; I can open it after several tries but my wife cannot open it.  Also the trimmer does not trim as well as other Panasonic Razor&#x27;s I have owned.  I give the trimmer 3 star, so overall I give it a 4 star.  I recommend it because it does give a very good close shave.</li>
    <li> Got this shaver for my dad for Christmas.  It has a $30 coupon and ended up costing $97.  For that price, it is very well built and my dad says he really likes it.  He was a razor user his whole life and now in his 70&#x27;s he found this to be much easier.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve loved using Panasonic wet/dry razors for over a decade. When it was time to retire my treasured Arc 3 shaver, I thought the extra blade with the Arc 4 would be even better, and the reviews all seemed to support this. It&#x27;s a false premise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The extra blade makes for a massive shaving head that isn&#x27;t ideal for shaving the curves of an average man&#x27;s face. It&#x27;s just too darn big, making shaving an even bigger hassle! Back to my sleek Arc 3.</li>
    <li> This is the best razor I have ever used.  I&#x27;m 51 and have used Norelco ( great job but chewed my neck up every time ) as well as Braun and Remingtom Microscreen ( Missed the hairs on my neck that didn&#x27;t grow strait out ) This one does a GREAT JOB dry and when used in the shower with BILLY JEALOUSY HYDROPLANE SUPER SLICK SHAVE CREAM Approaches shaving nirvana!  If I take a little extra time this will shave me as close or closer than a blade.</li>
    <li> I had an earlier version of a Panasonic shaver that was just OK, but I used it for three years or so with no problems, it just had a habit of not getting the hard-to-get hair on my neck area.  When I decided to get a new one, I was planning to get an Architec (sp?) because they look so cool but after reading many user reviews, I changed my mind.  My next idea was to get a top of the line Panasonic with the cleaning unit, but changed my mind there too because of not so great reviews about the cost of the cleaning system and the additional products needed and because i have limited space on my vanity area.  I am SO happy I bought this one.  The minute I started using it I could tell it was FAR superior to my previous shaver.  It shaves my face in a flash, even the hard-to-reach areas!  Really does a GREAT job!  And it has a \\&quot;turbo\\&quot; setting to use to clean it with a little hand soap which I am sure will be more than adequate.  I would highly recommend this shaver to anyone.</li>
    <li> I bought this shaver a month ago. The first time I used it I thought throw away my old electric shaver! I shave while showering and then I clean the shaver right there. So easy and no solutions to buy. I have had melagnoma on my face so it left a scar and this shaver works perfectly there. My old one took so long then it got warm. I told my brother about it and he loves his too. I love shampooing my whole face and shaving at the same time. I never did that before. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Having owned at least 5 Panasonic shavers over the past 20 years, I thought this one would be the best shaving and most advanced shaver I have ever owned. It turned out to be a decent shaver but after only three weeks the trimmer got jammed and the game was over. It is now back at Panasonic for a replacement. While it was working, the blades were fine but no closer than the older less expensive shaver I had for 3 years. The top of the shaver is indeed bulky and a bit hard to hold. The screen for reading remaining power etc. is the best I have ever seen so that was a plus. The shaver lasted much longer than any previous shaver which is because of the newer battery design. Overall, a fine shaver Made in Japan, but this defect tells me that the design of the trimmer is complicated and may be prone to jamming. Overall, I am using my old shaver right now and I like it better than I ever did while I was using it every day!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not as massive as some think. The narrow, but comfortable grip, makes the head seem big. Much quieter than my other shavers (Braun, Remington, Norelco). Clean, close and smooth shave. No pulling or irritation. Being able to rinse out the blades under the faucet is a plus. Very satisfied.</li>
    <li> Below is my initial review.  However, I&#x27;ve now had this for over a year.  I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;ll purchase another high end Panasonic, particularly if I intend to use it in the shower.  My previous version had the electronics quit about every six months.  I bought it from a store that let me return it, so it was a fair trade off to me.  However, Amazon doesn&#x27;t have such an extreme return policy, so when the electronics died after six months, I have to live with it.  I sent the first one back to Panasonic and they replaced it, and the replacement died after six months as well and is no longer covered.  Now mechanically it still works great, and the electronics on the ones I bought for my dad and uncle who don&#x27;t use it wet are still going strong.  However, a small part of why I paid so much for this razor were the electronics, and 6 months of use does not seem worth it.  If you intend to use it dry, I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ll be very happy.  But if you intend to use it in the shower, go for the cheapest Panasonic model you can get!  Oh, and don&#x27;t expect much sympathy from Panasonic, their customer support is not that great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**** old review ****&lt;br /&gt;I recently bought this for my dad based on how much I love mine, which is the LA93 version, the only difference is the cleaning/charging base.  This is the first electric razor I&#x27;ve owned that gives me the same feeling that I get when I shave with my Gillette Sensor (Braun Pulsonic Series 5 &amp; 7, and Panasonic Arc 4 Nano I&#x27;ve owned previously).  Don&#x27;t get me wrong, electrics don&#x27;t shave as close, and anyone who says different should be questioned.  However, with every other razor (even the excellent Arc 4), I still feel some stubble when I run my hand over my face and head.  This razor gets it so close that you barely feel that stubble.  Add in the fact that you can take it in the shower and use shaving cream and you have an extremely comfortable shave.  The design makes it look like it would be odd to hold, but in fact it&#x27;s very comfortable.  I&#x27;d say that it&#x27;s a little awkward upside down on your head, but if you switch your grip it&#x27;s not a problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One other thing I&#x27;d say is that if you don&#x27;t plan to keep the razor in the charger/cleaner every day, then buy this version and save the money.  The cleaner for the Panasonic&#x27;s doesn&#x27;t really seem as effective as that for the Braun&#x27;s.  However they&#x27;re much less expensive to run as they don&#x27;t utilize the special alcohol based cleaning mixture.  I will say that the cleaning cycle for it is much longer but not as noisy as the Braun&#x27;s.comfortable.

    <li> I used a Braun (top of the line prior to the Pulsonic release) for 5 years prior to buying this model. It is really important to note that the transition period and process from blade (I was coming from Fusion) to electric is not to be underestimated. First few shaves with the Braun were absolutely brutal. It took forever to shave the neck in particular. For me, it required about 2 months of sticking with it (with numerous moments of intense doubt along the way) for my beard to make the transition. Once I successfully crossed over to the world of electric, I was very satisfied with the Braun. Just recently however the switch began to wear out. After much research I decided to give this Panasonic a try. First shave I tried dry and with results slightly better than the Braun. Second shave I tried wet using some lathered bar soap. Simply incredible. The closest, most comfortable shave I have ever experienced, period. I have a beard of medium thickness, so keep that in mind. I can grow a legit beard, just not something you might see on beard.com. For me, this model kicks the Braun to the curb, especially for the price. That is purely on performance, let alone the fact that cleaning is so simple. You really do not need a cleaning station with this shaver.</li>
    <li> Finally a shaver that works. Best of all it takes only a couple of minutes to do a complete shave. Very pleased with Panasonic shavers. Beats the rest hands down.</li>
    <li> I bought this to replace my aging Braun and now that I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple of weeks I have to say I&#x27;m very happy with it.     I&#x27;ve only used it dry so far and it does a great job.    Cleaning is simple and much cheaper than the the cartridge system of my old Braun.</li>
    <li> Got this as a replacement for me old Norelco rotary after about 5 years of use.    Pros: close shave quickly, much smoother than my Norelco, tugs less, fewer missed spots and stray hairs    Cons:   1. Beard trimmer way underpowered, always yanks and tugs, vastly inferior to my old $40 Norelco&#x27;s  2. Price point.  For $100+, this had better be the best damn razor ever invented  3. Battery life.  I don&#x27;t have a very thick beard, but I only get max 2 shaves on a battery charge  4. Can&#x27;t use while charging.  Imagine a laptop like that...  5. Quality: beard trimmer broke (jammed up, won&#x27;t move), always took good care of this, never dropped it, just broke  6. Loud.  Really almost hurts my ear when I&#x27;m trimming my sideburns, etc    Ogverall: Disappointed.  Gets a much smoother and better shave than my old Norelco, but that&#x27;s all the good I can say about it.  It&#x27;s loud, flimsy, and clumsy.  Beard trimmer is terrible.  For this much money, I expected more.  For about $30-40, I may consider this a good deal.  This will likely be the last Panasonic I bother with.</li>
    <li> This is my second electric shaver. This replaces a Braun that is about 8 years old and had been dropped more times that I care to think about. I have shaved with this shaver about 2 weeks now, and I am still getting used to it. A little about my beard: My facial hair grows in many directions, which makes shaving a challenge sometimes. I was looking for the convenience of an electric shaver, but my sensitive skin requires the use of shave cream or some other type of lubricant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am still not at 100% sold on this, but I know that it sometimes takes time to get your beard used to what you shave with. A friend recommended shaving with Olive Oil, and I tried that today and had pretty good results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far, I am pleased with the battery life and charge time. I have read other reviews that stated this might be a problem, but it has not been one YET.</li>
    <li> My husband is very happy with this razor, says its a shave he&#x27;s never had before.  Definitely worth the money!!</li>
    <li> Purchased for Christmas gift.  I was hoping this shaver would work well for my boyfriend who cannot have facial hair due to his profession. He had to return because it did not provide a clean shave.</li>
    <li> It takes about twice as long to get a good shave with this compared to the ES8243A and especially the ES-LA63, which is my favorite. I ordered another ES-LA63 from amazon and took my ES-SL41-3 back to Target when it arrived.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This and the ES8243A are the best shavers I&#x27;ve ever had but the LA63 is the best of all. This thing shaves better, closer and quicker than anything else I&#x27;ve tried. There&#x27;s no comparison to the blades and multi-pivoting heads of the better shavers and the smoothness of the 63. The 8243 is similar but not as nice, it sounds and feels much more noisy, while the LA63 is a pleasure to use.</li>
    <li> Panasonic has lost me with this model.  I&#x27;m using my old model again.  This nree one does a terrible job.</li>
    <li> I have been using Panasonic wet/dry razors for well over 20 years.  I have loved everyone of them and this one is the best yet.  Quiet, good shave, and good trimmer.</li>
    <li> My husband is very pleased ...this is his second shaver in has purchased and he highly recommends to his friends.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my husband, he was getting tired of shaving with a razor everyday had been doing so for MANY years, he loves it!</li>
    <li> I tried every possible method of shaving with this razor and&lt;br /&gt;could not get a clean shave. The razor seems well made  and&lt;br /&gt;easy to clean but I guess I have been using a blade razor too&lt;br /&gt;long to switch.</li>
    <li> This shaving machine is absolutely great. it shaves as if you are shaving with a razor. very satisfied with it. the charging time is less than an hour. Totally it&#x27;s fantastic.</li>
    <li> My Dad has had a lot of problems getting a close shave.  The blades and parts were listed as $60 to replace.</li>
    <li> I have been using this shaver for about 5 times now. Before I was using the Braun Pulsonic Serie 7 shaver. Both will give you a close shave but the Panasonic shaves closer. The shave in the neck area requires quite a bit of effort though but overall I am very happy with this shaver. You can wash it under the water too and the battery life is very good. Quiet motor as well. Definitely recommends.</li>
    <li> I was going to buy the new lv61 or lv81 model that has 5 blades, but I just couldn&#x27;t justify spending $400 more for an extra blade (5 blades versus 4).  I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t because this is a fantastic shaver, and blows my prior Braun Pulsonic out of the water.  If there is an improvement in Panasonic&#x27;s new models, it&#x27;s probably marginal, and I can certainly wait for the prices to come down.    As someone who has to shave daily and used to feel like a cactus at night even after shaving in the morning, I think this shaver is amazing.  I can use it dry or in the shower (I haven&#x27;t noticed a big difference like other reviewers), and it gives me a shave that is super-close in only 5 minutes.      Cleaning is VERY easy.  All you have to do is remove the top cover, rinse it off under running water, and do the same with the blades.  It has a cleaning mode that vibrates the blades faster for cleaning purposes.  I was getting tired of spending $10-$20 every few months just to get replacement cartridges for my Braun Pulsonic cleaning system.  Trust me -- it&#x27;s a big waste of money, so don&#x27;t bother spending an extra $80+ for the more expensive version that comes with one (the shavers themselves are identical except for color).  All you will end up doing is spend more money every month or two for replacement cartridges.  Like I said above -- it&#x27;s so easy to clean under running water with the high speed cleaning mode.      So, I highly recommend this shaver for anyone who has to shave daily, and doesn&#x27;t want to spend a lot of time doing it every morning.  It&#x27;s the best shaver I&#x27;ve ever bought, and a fantastic value for the price (I paid $149.99).  I will be paying attention to future reviews for the newer 5-blade version, but honestly -- why pay $400+ more for that when this does such a great job?</li>
    <li> I have been using this shaver for the last 6 months now and have been totally disappointed with it. The head is so large that it is very difficult to maneuver it over the contours of the face. Most of the time it is very hard to shave off the hair in and around the throat and lower cheeks area. While shaving it also lets through hair through the cutter area which creates a mess. The only thing I liked about this shaver is the ease of cleaning. Don&#x27;t need any special purpose solution. Cold tap water and some hand soap is all you need. I would strongly recommend against buying this shaver.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used electric razors for years (mostly Remington), and they did a good job.  However, this Panasonic is a substantial improvement in providing a smooth, effective, quiet shaving experience.  I&#x27;m impressed, and would not hesitate to recommend it to others.</li>
    <li> Great Razor.  I will never use Braun or Remington again.</li>
    <li> Just shaved with this for the first time, and all I can say is WOW!  I have a habit of switching back and forth every few years between razors and electric shavers (not really sure why), and I got the itch to switch back to an electric.  After reading many reviews of several brands/models I decided to go with the Panasonic ES-LA63-S.  I did a wet shave with the [[ASIN:B000A5CPJ4 Billy Jealousy Hydroplane Shave Cream, 8-Ounce Bottle]], and it feels like I shaved with a razor.  I have fairly thick facial hair, and the hair on my neck grows in about 10 different directions.  I was totally amazed at how fast this thing zipped right through it all and how close the shave was.  I&#x27;ve never ever shaved my face so quickly with an electric shaver before.  Cleanup under warm running water was a breeze and totally effortless.  This is hands-down by far the absolute best electric shaver I&#x27;ve ever used!  I may just stay with electric from now on!</li>
    <li> Bought this as an early Christmas gift for my son.  Selected this one for the good reviews as well as the moderate price.  Upon receipt I charged it, tried it, and played with it for a couple of days.  I was really impressed with the construction, power, and features.  This clearly is in a different class than the Norelco and Remington shavers I&#x27;ve used previously.  Long story short, my son absolutely loves it.  Every time we hear from him he mentions how much he enjoys using it.</li>
    <li> I am using the panasonic product for last 7 years. I love it. This shaves my beard very smoothly. I am using this for couple of months....</li>
    <li> I was so excited to get this shaver. After reading all the reviews, I was sure this was going to do provide a (somewhat) close shave and not cut me up (a problem I&#x27;ve had with past electric shavers). I do, however, want to start with some positives. I know that my stars already provide my opinion about this product, but here&#x27;s some great things:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The LCD Battery Status: This was extremely helpful to see how much time I had left on a charge. It was incredibly accurate and shows the percentage of battery left. It also tells you how long you&#x27;ve been using it for that particular shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trimmer: Not sure what to call this, but the trimmer that sticks out the back is great for getting longer hair off so it doesn&#x27;t get caught and pulled out, hurting you when you shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cleaning: I felt like cleaning this was very easy to take apart, wash, and sit to dry. I&#x27;ve had shavers that I can&#x27;t get all the hair out, or they get messed up when I do try to rinse it. This never had that problem. Truly waterproof.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, what I didn&#x27;t like was when I actually shaved with the normal head. I will admit, I never tried to use shaving cream, and I kind of regret not giving that a go after seeing that that is what most people had the most success with. HOWEVER, this is supposed to shave dry no problem. That is not the case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I would try a dry shave, it would still cut my skin and leave me feeling very uncomfortable. It also left a lot of hair behind, meaning it was not a close shave AT ALL. It simply didn&#x27;t get all that I needed it to, making it take forever to finally get a good shave. I understand now that I should have used shaving cream, but I was under the impression when I bought it that it was not entirely needed. Again, a little misleading.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, my BIGGEST qualm is that the outer foil broke on me. What do I mean? It started chipping away to the point that if I tried shaving the metal would cut my skin, meaning I can&#x27;t use this anymore until I get more outer foil. Now, it doesn&#x27;t matter what you paid for this, though most say how expensive it is. I was hoping to get at least 6 (but wanting 12) months out of this before I had to replace the foil. Instead, after 1 month I can&#x27;t use this anymore. New foil here on Amazon is $60, meaning I&#x27;m in over $200 already on this razor. I&#x27;m scared to even buy new foil if this happens again. Very, very disappointed and frustrated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I contacted Panasonic and let them know how quickly the foil broke on me and was hoping they&#x27;d understand that this shouldn&#x27;t happen after only a month&#x27;s use. I didn&#x27;t want a refund on the shaver, but hoping for another foil to see if I was maybe shaving too hard (which I doubt). They told me that it&#x27;s disposable material that breaks down, so it&#x27;s not covered under warranty. I do understand that, and don&#x27;t blame them. Still, it&#x27;s frustrating that I bought this shaver and can&#x27;t use it after a month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just a thought: Avoid shaving dry with this. I really think it&#x27;s bad for the foil and doesn&#x27;t provide a good shave for the price. Once I get more foil and some shaving cream, I will possibly update this. I was going to give a 3/5, but I just don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s fair that this has never happened to me before with an electric shaver and I&#x27;ve always shaved dry. I understand if that&#x27;s not how it should be done, but I&#x27;ve never been told or shown otherwise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really hope this helps people make an informed decision and to use this correctly. Again, maybe I didn&#x27;t use it as it should have, but I don&#x27;t think that was the problem.</li>
    <li> My old ES4026&#x27;s battery was not holding it&#x27;s charge anymore and after getting my son a cheap Remington 5800, I started to look into getting myself a new razor.  My ES4026 wasn&#x27;t good with a full days worth of growth, but to clean up after a regular razor or for a small amount of growth, it really got close and smooth.    After much research and the fact that a cheap Remington did a pretty good job, I was so excited to get this LA63 figuring it would be amazing.  Well, it does whip thru a days worth of growth pretty well, but that&#x27;s pretty much it.  It does a terrible job on my chin and especially under my jaw bone area and neck.  I&#x27;ve been using it for the recommended 8 weeks or so and I&#x27;ve tried dry shaves, wet shaves, shaving creams, soap, and pre-shave lotions.  All with the same crap result.  Now if I want a close shave, I finish up with a bic razor or grab the old ES4026.    Also, it says you can use in the shower but  a few days after trying that, the led screen went out.  So much for that.  The head is bulky so it&#x27;s hard to get under the nose area and back of the jaw line.  Next time I&#x27;ll stick with the three foil type or go to the Brawn.  In fact, my son is home from college so I tried the Remington again and it had no problem getting my neck and chin area close.  Now I&#x27;m kicking myself for not just getting one of those.</li>
    <li> Bought in April, 2014.  Used daily for 6 months and love this shaver.  Have thick facial hair and half a head of hair.  Shave it all daily and get a very close, smooth shave every time.  Works just like the day I bought it.  Usually get three shaves between charges, since it is used for shaving my head daily as well.  Use it mostly dry, but have used it in the shower as well.  I recommend it with absolutely no reservations.  Heads above any Norelco or Wahl shaver I have used in the past.</li>
    <li> One of the best electric razors I&#x27;ve had.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband for Christmas about 2 years ago. I chose this model because it was highly rated by Consumer Reports. We have had no issues with it. It works very well.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had the Panasonic shavers for many years. I used to have to shave at least once per day for 20 years (figure that one out).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This particular one is my 4th and 5th one. I&#x27;ve had this one a couple years and then it stopped working, but I&#x27;ll say it was my fault that it stopped working. I got curious and bored one day and took it apart. I put it back together and it wont work anymore. I took it apart a few more times trying to make it work, but I guess there is something about taking it apart that it doesn&#x27;t like. I was surprised to see an an electronic circuit board in there. Anyways about the shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a very good shaver, you can shave on it every day for a couple years before changing the blade and foil set. I never had a problem with the batteries on any of these. I&#x27;ve had 2 of these. I just bought one to replace one that I&#x27;ve had about 2-3 years. I&#x27;ve had another high RPM Panasonic shaver before this for many years, I had it long enough to change the blades a couple times. The batteries and motors just keep running and running and running. I was looking for an excuse to buy a newer higher RPM one like this, but it kept going and going and going. When it came time to change the blades for the third time I decided to just buy a newer one with higher RPMs like this one. My very first Panasonic shaver which was over 10 years ago also lasted a few years of daily use. I just bought a new one when the blades finally went bad. But the first one was a regular speed shaver, it wasn&#x27;t high RPM like this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These days I shave about 4 times a week and it will last me about a month before needing to recharge it.&lt;br /&gt;I can shave about 14-18 times with this before needing to charge it. If the battery is dead and you need a quick shave you can shave with this while it is plugged in, or you can just charge it for 5 minutes and you will have plenty of power to get a full shave, probably 2-3 shaves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I never timed it, but it will charge from empty to fully charged in about 45 minutes. When I took it apart I seen that it was a round battery that was about 3 inches long. It had some custom pins on the ends of them, I guess to hold it in securely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I just got this new about a month ago I know it will be good for at least 2-3 years before it will need new blades or foil. I would expect this to last at least 4-5 years minimum before needing to look for a new one. By then new shavers will probably have Bluetooth or WiFi and some apps or something, who knows.</li>
    <li> Like all electric shavers I have owned, it simply does not compete with  a razor-shave. You can get close with this one, but it takes time. It is the best of the electric razors I have owned.</li>
    <li> Does a nice job, doesn&#x27;t give me the razor burn I got with my norelco rotary that I used for years. I use a pre-electric ( Afta) once in a while and that seems to get the shave even closer. Close as a blade? pretty close but a blade is still the best. That said this is the best, fastest,safest for day to day shaving. I&#x27;ve been using this razor for about 9 months now</li>
    <li> I just love to shave my face with this! Gets it feeling like a baby&#x27;s butt.</li>
    <li> Works very good with very close shaving, easily cleaned and battery charge very fast. The only problem is the big head makes shaving difficult in some areas like under the nose.I had some irritation at first week then it gets better after that.I recommend this shaver if you don&#x27;t have problem with the big head</li>
    <li> I love this razor. I have a very sensitive neck, and for the past couple years have been forced to only use trimmers and keep stubble, or a straight edge razor if I need to be clean shaven. Anything else, including past electric razors causes just too much irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have always wanted to try a higher end electric razor to see if it would work. This popped up on the deal of the day and I had to bite. It works wonderfully, and it definitely still causes me some irritation but for the first time I can actually shave in the morning (would always do at night so I could sleep through the irritation).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My shaves do seem to take longer than estimated, at about 7-8 minutes. But after that I have a near straight razor smooth shave! Cleaning is a breeze (just squirt some hand soap on the blades, hold the power button down and it will turn to turbo mode and rinse).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My one complaint which keeps this from being a five star... I have to charge this more than is ideal. Its not bad and should get you through a week away I think. I just hate hauling out cords!</li>
    <li> The Best of the Electric Shavers I ever have!</li>
    <li> The item arrived before it was scheduled. It works great, super clean shave - the best I&#x27;ve had and I&#x27;ve tried probably seven or so of them. Charges fast and maintains charge for a days.</li>
    <li> I paid $99.99 on an amazon daily deal special for this shaver and I am going to be comparing it to the other shaver I bought for my father but I have been using since it is amazing!  Panasonic ES-LV61-A [[ASIN:B005GNL5G4 Panasonic ES LV61 A Electric Multiflex Pivoting]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This shaver is a lot less expensive. We paid around $260 for the other shaver and I paid $100 for this shaver. If you were to compare the shavers the more expensive one (Panasonic ES-LV61-A) is obviously with out a doubt a better shaver. It took me around 5 minutes to shave my face smooth with this shaver which was around the same amount of time it took to shave with the other shaver. You can notice that you may have to take multiple passes depending on the way your hair grows and how thick or thin your hair is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall for $100 dollars it is an excellent shaver. We both used to have Braun shavers (their highest tier shaver) and also used to use the cleaning kit and always having to buy the cleaners. Honestly, using the more expensive shaver and now starting to use this one daily there is no difference between running water and cleaning everything out vs using the Braun or Panasonic expensive cleaning kit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope this helps someone and I believe this shaver is worth at least $200 dollars or less. You get what you pay for and if you purchase this one or spend the extra money for their more expensive shaver you will see what I am talking about after using it a few times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cheers!</li>
    <li> Husband uses it every day and with his thick hair it helps him make it through the work day.</li>
    <li> The shave is good and it took my face a few days to get used to it. The biggest complaint that I have is the ingrown hairs that it causes. I have not had them in years and since using this razor, I have had a ton. The pain of the ingrown hair and the blemish it leaves after it is removed is just not worth it.</li>
    <li> My ancient Norelco finally gave up the ghost and I was intrigued by the wet-dry concept and picked this up.  I am very happy with it.  The quality of the shave is very good - the first one in my experience that genuinely could be compared to a blade shave.  It arrived promptly and well packaged.  Unboxed and charged it up for a few hours and off we go.  Only warning I would pass on, I have developed the habit from shaving with a blade razor of shaking off the water after rinsing.  The large head on a small pivot did not like that motion, but it survived until I retrained my reflexes.</li>
    <li> after trying numerous shavers (both rotary and foil from different companies) have come to conclusion that impossible to get razor close shave with ANY shaver except a razor. anyone who claims they get a razor close shave is either working for the company or shaving peach fuzz. i shopped for a razor for my son who is 14 and has downs and getting the fuzz. so  i tried different razors on myself and him and this is the best i found. less neck burn (although i still got some) than the rotary and closest shave possible with an electric. but there was still stubble. and i can shave faster and closer with a razor, but this is for my son so will live with it.</li>
    <li> I’ve used several other electric shaver brands over the years (Remington, Norelco), most recently an old Braun that seemed to work best, but I thought I’d try the Panasonic when I got an email from Amazon about a sale price (and saw the consumer ratings).  My first shave was good, but didn’t seem enough of an improvement to me to warrant keeping it instead of replacing the head on my Braun again.  But by my third shave with it my wife and I were convinced--if you are careful to pull your skin back and move against the grain it really gives a very close shave without needing much pressure or many repeat passes.  I couldn’t duplicate this close a shave with the Braun no matter how I tried--and my wife agrees even with a new head the Braun never did as good a job.  It also seems to catch all the odd hairs very well, even close to the nose.  The higher pitched noise of the motor surprised me, I liked the quieter, lower old Braun sound, but I think it may be a sign of more speed and power and in any event I got used to it quickly.</li>
    <li> Works great and very clean cut.  Easy to clean just by running it under water.</li>
    <li> This  razor works as expected and guess it could really be 5 stars but it is difficult for me to get real excited about a razor.  It does what I expected and have tried using it wet, dry and with shaving cream and all is well.  Glad it didn&#x27;t cost any more than it did.</li>
    <li> Works excellent.  I have sensitive skin and I don&#x27;t get a rash using it.  It is quick and works well wet or dry.</li>
    <li> Best cordless electric shaver I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
    <li> a gift for my father. He said it shaves pretty clear</li>
    <li> Husband loves the razor!</li>
    <li> The thing about this razor that I had a hard time with was its size.  It is large and a bit unwieldy in the hand and the general feel is awkward.  Not very ergonomic and more like holding a hammer than a razor.  And because the blade surface is surrounded by so much material, it is hard to know exactly where the blades are shaving.  Would definitely not recommend if you are using this on your face and have any facial hair, such as a mustache or even sideburns that you want to get neatly around.      This shaver doesn&#x27;t allow for much accuracy in trimming around a mustache or near sideburns. As someone who normally shaves with a blade, but likes to have an electric just to do a quick &#x27;trim&#x27; for going out, on weekends or when I&#x27;m in a hurry, I found this unit to be too much of a hassle to use. I could spend 20 minutes trying to shave with this and still have hairs sticking out around my mouth or on my chin.   I got this to replace an older Norelco triple header, which I loved,  but couldn&#x27;t find blades for anymore. The Norelco never gave me razor burn or irritation but this one does.      For an angular face like mine, a regular blade gives a much better and cleaner shave, especially around the chin area and on my neck.</li>
    <li> Product arrived very promptly and as described. Very happy with vendor.</li>
    <li> This is a great shaver.  Years ago I used a Remington screen shaver but started having a lot of ingrown hairs.  I switched over to multi blade had shavers but ended up with some kind of skin irritation likely connected to rosacea.  A friend recommended this to me and I&#x27;m been pleasantly surprised.  I only use it as a dry shaver so cannot attest to the wet shaving experience..</li>
    <li> When I got into wet shaving using DE (double edge razor blades) an straight razors I never abandoned my love for a good electric.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My favorite electric for 35 years have been by Braun and the top of the line series 7 have proved to be the best razors of this type I&#x27;ve ever owned. That said I had great hopes for this Panny and had read great reviews both on and off Amazon - so I gave it a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because I&#x27;m also a head shaver, how the head foils float and move is essential for a decent shave. When it comes to getting a great shave on the old melon the Braun and my Norelco Senor-Touch 3D do an exceptional job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Electric razors are a highly personal item, so much of it is purely subjective what works beautifully for one can be torture to another. Skin sensitivity, elasticity, beard density, frequency, bone structure - all come into place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All considered I really wanted to like this razor and gave it a good three weeks to earn it&#x27;s stripes. But ended up returning it. In my case the razor has some fatal flaws.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) The head is far to big making shaving under the nose and above the upper lip near impossible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) The double motor does make for a powerful razor but it also heats up the head fairly quickly and was without question the loudest electric I&#x27;ve ever used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are minor complaints and I could have easily gotten used to them. However the design of the ARC razors is in my opinion pretty terrible. For say, head shaving, because of the high arch in the center of the foils you&#x27;re only making minimal contact of foil to skin of about an inch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can rock the razor side to side to cover more territory but this puts the foil at an odd angle and made it prime for hair pulling and razor burn. Not to mention it was extremely uncomfortable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To be fair this razor, like most all electrics was never promoted or touted as a head shaver. I was forcing the design by Panasonic to perform an application it just wasn&#x27;t constructed to do. And although some electrics are excellent at shaving the dome - this is the last one you would want to use for that purpose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the face and neck, the razor did a marginal job at best. Again, I fault the ARC design. It requires to much pressure and although the massive 4 foil head pivots with ease - if I have to spend this much time working with angles I would rather lather up and use a straight blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In fairness, it did do quite a good job on my face right out of the box, but the neck area seemed impossible to get smooth - and I would eventually end up going over the same area with my Braun to get rid of any stubble.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Without question there are many guys who love the ARC line. Panny  does make a Linear line of razors without the ARC and perhaps I&#x27;ll take one for a test drive one of these days.application it just wasn&#x27;t constructed to do.

    <li> I used Norelcos for 8 years they never gave me a close shave, and they were complicated to clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My Panasonic gives me a great shave, and it&#x27;s easy to clean. Just wish the battery lasted a little longer.</li>
    <li> have only had it a couple of weeks but, works great wet or dry</li>
    <li> Husband gets cleanest shave ever.  Will definitely be a money saver with the price of razors now a days. Arrived very quickly.</li>
    <li> I never had any luck with Electric Shavers especially with Norelco but this Panny Shaver is Great! It does what is says and does it very well. I have always had problems getting a good or close shave from any Electric shavers but this one makes it easy and close very close shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have had this for a month so far and have No Regrets and I now look forward to using it every few days. I have not tried the WET shave yet but will do so soon enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product and you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> This is a precision instrument, well made, worth the Amazon price. The shave is much better than my (old) rotary by far: smoother, closer, easier, less  irritation, no razor bumps. Dry or wet, but especially wet with a good body wash (Eucerin), it can&#x27;t be beat. Others have commented on the grip: it takes getting used to, but no big deal. The battery doesn&#x27;t last as long as my old rotary, but enough for a trip of a week or more. It is a cinch to clean, though that is not often necessary. One complaint only: there is no stand, it has to lie flat on my shelf; that takes up room, especially when it&#x27;s disassembled for drying. But I&#x27;ve dealt with that, too. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I had a 3-head Norelco for years but awhile ago it began not cutting well, and for a little more cost than new heads I thought I&#x27;d try this different design. Only had it a month, have only done it dry, but my wife likes the smoother shave and so di I. Unlock the swivel head and it goes over my chin bones easily. Still works fine on the original charge, which is good news for when I go on 1-2 week business trips. Could use a hard shell case for trips instead of the flimsy one.</li>
    <li> very good,i choose it between braun 790cc and Panasonic ES-LA63-S,in the end ,i buy this one ,it is so good</li>
    <li> Goods and goods description is consistent, very suitable for people in Asia, USA, the domestic express also very clear, the next time I will continue to buy the product.</li>
    <li> Product arrived very promptly and as described. Very happy with vendor.</li>
    <li> Nice close shave and not too loud. Consumer Reports and Amazon reviews both rated this razor highly and it is a nice razor for men.</li>
    <li> The blades and rasor? RETIRED FOREVER!  This has been an eye opener. Close shave in the shower, in the tub, walking around....FIRST! Unlike the Braun it does not throw shavings all over. SECOND: Unlike the best Braun it does not irritate no matter how close the shave. THIRD: Unlike the Braun it charges in one hour. FOURTH: Unlike the blades it pays for itself.&lt;br /&gt;RIGHT! Before l borrowed my Son&#x27;s and l had been told this Panasonic outdoes my four bladed razor l would have said &amp;#34;Are you out of your mind?&amp;#34;. Well, l am not. Neither am l pig headed to stick to a so called proven method of shaving which ALWAYS IRRITATED and aggravated. I cannot actually believe l look forward to using this shaver!&lt;br /&gt;As far as negative reviews are concerned, some of us must have forgotten the LEMONS we have had as cars. These days? It just happens.&lt;br /&gt;My Panasonic ended at the bottom of the tub twice and the led display is fine. Imagine how a Braun would have loved that bath!&lt;br /&gt;Finely, clearly stated on this shaver &amp;#34;Made in Japan&amp;#34;...checked a Braun lately?&lt;br /&gt;Sore at Braun you ask? If you had three of them retired, kaput in a drawer...would you be elated?</li>
    <li> Excellent shaver for the price. It does have a lithium ion battery (couldn&#x27;t find that listed anywhere). Works wet or dry for a clean close shave. One of the better side trimmers I&#x27;ve used as well.</li>
    <li> pretty good!...I have always used a blade and found this shaver to work amazingly well. Use with foam and water gives you a close shave. You do have to \\&quot;work\\&quot; at some of the tight spots but overall it is pretty good.</li>
    <li> Easy to shave. Leaves a clean soft skin without irritation.&lt;br /&gt;Works as described in the instructions.  Barely lose the charge.&lt;br /&gt;Easy to clean. Good price.</li>
    <li> Using this shaver you can be very sure of a clean shave in a few strokes every single time . After a couple of attempts, you may no longer need a mirror! You can virtually  move your hands across the face feel spikes of hair and after a few strokes at that location you will find the patch smoothen up. Even a person with poor eyesight can have a wonderful shave with this device. I would definitely recommend to try [[ASIN:B007QDXWR2 Panasonic ES-LA63-S Men\\&quot;s 4-Blade (Arc 4) Multi-Flex Dual-Motor Wet/Dry Rechargeable Electric Shaver with Nanotech Blades, Silver]].</li>
    <li> My trusty Braun shaver was starting to get a bit long in the tooth so I decided to see where modern electric shaving was at.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Picked up the [[ASIN:B002N5MHLU Panasonic ES-LA63-S Men&#x27;s 4-Blade (Arc 4) Multi-Flex Dual-Motor Wet/Dry Rechargeable Electric Shaver with Nanotech Blades, Silver]] (the model names are so confusing) and now find myself being drawn to the bathroom because I just want to keep shaving with it.  I&#x27;d actually forgotten what a close shave felt like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have non-sensitive skin with a course, dark growth.  The Panasonic glides through it all with balletic grace.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was curious about how the size of the shaver head would affect its dynamics around my face - it turned out to be no trouble and effectively probes into the difficult neck, under nose and upper sideburn areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dry shaving gives you a close shave.  Wet shaving gives you a blade-like closeness - beautifully smooth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve experimented with a wet face covered with shaving oil.  While this gives a close shave, the oil combines with the shavings and clogs the close-set blades.  Simply washing the face, rinsing and leaving wet works fine without any additional lubricant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cleaning the blades as per the supplied instructions works well (essentially holding under running water with a bit of hand-soap applied to the foil).  I tend to leave the foil cover off and leave to dry above a heating vent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended - eroding the reputation of babies&#x27; bottoms everywhere.</li>
    <li> This product is excellent!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This has really helped control my acne, especially on my neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s easy to use, the battery holds the charge real well, you can use it in the shower if you want, the guard easily comes off for easy cleaning and maintenance, comes with a carrying case (just wish it could easily accommodate the charging cable in the case too though)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only issue is sometimes when it misses/goes over a hair, it&#x27;s difficult the get the hair unless you go against the grain.</li>
    <li> After two weeks I like it.  Very close shave.  Holds charge well.  Easy to clean.  Well made.  I would recommend this.</li>
    <li> This razor lives up to all its advertising,very good close shave, easy to handle, can use it in the shower and clean it with plain old tap water.  Beats my earlier one with all the fancy cleaning solutions that didn&#x27;t work and gooked up the razor.  Good razor, good shave, easy to work with and would highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B002N5MHLU Panasonic ES-LA63-S Men&#x27;s 4-Blade (Arc 4) Multi-Flex Dual-Motor Wet/Dry Rechargeable Electric Shaver with Nanotech Blades, Silver]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My third Panasonic shaver. After looking to see if there was any other electric shaver that was better I decided to purchase a top of the line norelco shaver. After 15 days I know it was not as good and took the 15 day challenge and returned it. I looked at all the Panasonic shavers again and decided to go with the ES-LA63-S. I am happy with the shaver and its much quiter then the old unit. I did not want the base cleaning unit as I had it with the last shaver and stopped using it after a few weeks. I also travel too much to really use it and found it really didnt do anything that a good soap and rinse couldn&#x27;t do.</li>
    <li> I do not like this product. Before i owned a philips coolshaver, that i owned for at least 20 years. Thinking it was finally time to buy a new shaving device i based myself on the reviews. Ok nothing wrong with the delivery but the device itself is really so so so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I heard the device was easy to clean. But there&#x27;s no brush to clean it included. So don&#x27;t forget to buy a brush to clean this things.&lt;br /&gt;The device is immeasurably loud. If your wife is asleep you can&#x27;t use it in the morning unless she wears earplugs.  I was really shocked to the loud noice of this device. I don&#x27;t think the battery is that great, after every shave you notice the power and intensity of the shave going down quite a lot, meaning that your next shave won&#x27;t be so good, meaning if i want a good shave, keep uploading it to 100%. My 20 year old shaver loads quicker, and retains energy many time folds longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shave isn&#x27;t that great, ok it&#x27;s smooth, but i feel like i have to force it through my skin, and i end up with red skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was really suprised , especially by the high amount of great ratings this product had on this website. I am totally honest in what i experienced. Maybe this shaving device is nothing for me, maybe it is something for you. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it, i am going for a philips shaver again next time. Oh well. Oh yeah and because its really a straight shaver, it&#x27;s hard to go around the curves nicely.</li>
    <li> everything as advertised</li>
    <li> Outstanding product.  Despite packaging telling customer to give it 30 days for your face to adjust, this razor treats my face perfectly right from the first shave!  I&#x27;ve had a Panasonic wet/dry electric shave that I used for nearly 10 years.  I stopped using as it became less effective, but that&#x27;s because it was 10 years old!  It was outstanding for the first 9 years.  I love this new Arc 4, works fantastically and would buy it all over again.  I highly recommend.  I am a very happy Panasonic Wet/Dry electric razor customer.&lt;br /&gt;More pros: I&#x27;ve used for over a month from the first charge - that about 3 shaves/wk; shaves almost as close as a blade.  Only reason it isn&#x27;t quite as close is that the stubble appears in a shorter time.  If I had to, I could use everyday with no irritation.  Adjustable head is nice feature so it flows with face.  Charges rapidly - 1 hour.&lt;br /&gt;Cons: Feels more delicate so handle with more care than previous model.  The trimmer is in position that makes it hard to see where I&#x27;m trimming my mustache, but it works very effectively.</li>
    <li> This is a gift for my father. He is very fond of it.</li>
    <li> Excellent shaver, works well. I have been using for years (have changed blades) and will use as long as the battery dies. Remember to keep the battery charged after each use. Deep cycling reduces battery life considerably.</li>
    <li> This is the best shaver I&#x27;ve owned. Thick beard, but it gets every hair and is the smoothest and cleanest cut I&#x27;ve ever gotten. I&#x27;m the guy with 5-o&#x27;clock shadow 1 hour after shaving, but not since I started using this shaver!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Used Panasonic for 6 years, formerly used Braun exclusively. Been shaving &amp;#34;only electric&amp;#34; for 30 years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy it. Give yourself a week or two to get used to it, and you will love it.</li>
    <li> very good, clear clean</li>
    <li> This is a great razor. My hair is thick and difficult to cut but this razor has no difficulty at all getting the job done. Typically my shaves take four and a half minutes and this uses abuut 15% of the battery. Clearly the battery is not an issue as a couple of reviewers have suggested.</li>
    <li> The Panasonic ES-LA63-S works really well. Smooth, fast and close shave (not as close as a razor blade, of course, but close enough). The only thing I miss is the possibility of operating it with the AC cord, and not just with the battery (only 45 min). Still, I&#x27;m very pleased with the product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this shaver for 2 months now so I saw it fit to write a quick review. It says in the manual that you should give about a month for it to get used to your facial hair without using any other shaver and it should give you the best results thereafter (considering that return time is 30 days, not very ideal but let&#x27;s go ahead with it anyways). So I use it once a week and what I have seen is that it doesn&#x27;t shave everything. It shaves the parts above my chin (top part of my facial hair) very well and very smooth if i go over most spots 2-3 times and there are no irritations or redness. I can do this 3 ways: dry shave (neither machine nor face is dampened), could do it wet (either in shower or by dampening one or both), or using a shaving cream along with the machine although this doesnt seem necessary and usually tends to cause little bleeding in certain spots so i just recommend using it dry or wet without shaving cream). Results are pretty similar, at least for me for all 3 methods though. So the top part is an easy and fast shave (faster than using a razor) with different options. The parts on the neck though (below the chin) are a pain. It gets only some of it. Whichever of the 3 methods I use, none of them allow me to shave everything on the neck parts. On top of that, going over 2-3 times on the neck can cause redness (but not irritation) and also minimal bleeding and will take u a while to get things close to right (but it will never be fully right). I&#x27;ve tried the shave with little to a lot facial hair but I never get good results on the neck part so I gotta use my gillette fusion power razor to get the rest (I don&#x27;t wanna do that though since I bought these to avoid buying $30 cartridges for the razor). I do know these electric shavers (even worse ones) work for some ppl perfectly fine though so I guess it really depends on the type of hair you have - thin or thick, little or a lot, etc. I guess another plus is that it&#x27;s easy to clean and takes 30 seconds to a minute after each shave. Overall, for me its worth 3 stars because although it looks and feels like a quality product, since it doesn&#x27;t shave off everything on my face, it takes longer to shave now and is a little annoying. But the overall shave is better since it gets rid of most hair and causes no irritation. And even using the razor after doesnt cause irritation really because i have little work left with it. But for what it does for me, its a little pricey cuz i still have to keep buying razor cartridges, i just replace them less often now...</li>
    <li> I had a norelco 3 head shaver for years and wanted to try a different type.  I have had this for about 2 months now and it has been fantastic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros -  Comparing my old norelco, this one does get a closer shave.&lt;br /&gt;  Very easy to clean, just put some hand soap on it and turn on the sonic/turbo mode for 20 seconds, Done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons - It is quite a bit louder than the old Norelco, but it&#x27;s just noise.</li>
    <li> This shaver is GREAT !!!!  What I like is that you can take it in to the shower and shave with it. Dry is also ok. The shaver fit in my hand great. Also the Mult-Flex head is great. Because what ever your contour of our face is floats over it. I am no expert at shaving. I think you will be happy with this product.&lt;br /&gt;The best thing fast charging. You can also clean the shaver in the shower or that the sink. The only thing I don&#x27;t like is \\&quot; NO STAND \\&quot;  with the shaver.</li>
    <li> I was a long-time Norelco user and when it came time to get a new shaver, I did quite a bit of research and determined that this Panasonic shaver was the best. However, after a year and a half, I am retiring the Panasonic shaver and going back to the Norelco shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note that I normally use a shaver dry, not wet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the most part the Panasonic shaver works fine. However, the finer hairs under my chin wouldn&#x27;t get cut or at least not much. After several days of this, it would become quite noticeable. I&#x27;ve have to use a blade or the side-burns trimmer to cut them down to size and then re-shave. It was tiresome.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a whim, I just picked up a Norelco at CostCo and am impressed with how much better it is than the Panasonic shaver. It cuts noticeably closer and doesn&#x27;t leave any fine hairs uncut. I&#x27;d forgotten how well the Norelco shaver works. Granted, neither cut \\&quot;as close as a blade\\&quot;, but the Norelco comes closer and requires less time to do a shave.</li>
    <li> Best shaver I&#x27;ve ever had.  And I&#x27;ve had a few.  It has the fastest vibration.  it makes my old Braun look so slow.  Seriously my shaving time has been cut in half and it cuts so close, (especially if I use the Afta pre-electric shave skin conditioner)</li>
    <li> Best electric razor i have ever had, it make,s the whiskers disappear! GOOD JOB</li>
    <li> Great shaving performance, long battery life, and quiet. Just what I was looking for in a shaver. Haven&#x27;t tried the cleaning function yet, but looks straightforward.</li>
    <li> I purchased my ES-63-S from Amazon after reading reviews for a long time. I had to have surgery and needed an electric shaver which would take me away from the Shick 4 blade safety razor that I have used for years. I decided on this Panasonic for the claim that it gave a very close shave and I wanted to use shaving cream and so needed it to do wet shaves. I normally shave following my shower and knew that the safety razor would give the ES-63 some very good competition. I have been shaving 1/2 of my face with the safety razor and the other 1/2 with the ES-63 and I have to say that the electric razor comes very close to the safety razor and so would recommend for anyone pondering as I was.</li>
    <li> very good shaving without hurting the skin, it is quick, around 4 to 5 minutes, and neat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I particularely like the level of noise which is very low.</li>
    <li> Had Remington and Norelco shavers in the past but this leaves them in the dust. Closest shave I have ever had with electric shaver. Quietest shaver I have ever had also. And it charges in 1 hour and LCD display tells you how much battery life is left. Should get well over a weeks worth of shaves even shaving twice a day. You won&#x27;t be sorry you bought this shaver.</li>
    <li> This is the second Panasonic Men&#x27;s Shaver I have purchased. The first delivered very good service for about five years. But the charging of the battery was getting weaker to the point I was getting about four shaves per charge. Plus the blades needed to be changed, so here we are. This Panasonic ES-LA63-S is quite different from the other shaver I retired. It has a large cutting head, and does not rely on the cleaning &amp; charging box. I get a very good, close shave all over my face and neck, except above my upper lip. Since the shave head is so deep, it doesn&#x27;t seem to get this area as well as I would like. I use the shaver wet, with a thin application of shave cream. It is very easy to clean, and I like the fact that I don&#x27;t need the external cleaner. Space in a bathroom is too tight to have another one of those cleaner/charger boxes.&lt;br /&gt;I would purchase this shaver again, and would not hesitate to recommend it to a friend.</li>
    <li> I like to shave in the shower, so I thought I would give this a try.  It worked just OK.  The shaver left a lot of hair.  I always had to reshave with a traditional razor.  After 2 months of using this, the internal electronics stop working (my guess is its not so waterproof), and the razor won&#x27;t take a charge.  If you do buy this razor, be sure to save your paperwork in case you need warranty work.</li>
    <li> It works fantastic. Quick shave time and battery life is decent!</li>
    <li> While I was looking for a great razor, I did some research and this razor kept appearing at the top of everyone&#x27;s list. So I took a chance and spent the money and it was the best investment I have made. The shave is closest EVER. I have not had any trouble with bumps or adjustment periods and its a great cut dry!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bonus is it can assist with the shaved head as well, without the burning that normally happens with a blade head shave. If the replacement blades work as well as reviewed, I will not need to invest in another razor ever! Thank you Panasonic!</li>
    <li> Excellent Shaver  shaves very close and very fast  plus it recharges quicky and is 100% water proof so you can enjoy your shave in the shower  Only  Niggle is that its quite Noisy plus included with the shaver is a nice black travel pouch i got the shaver at a reasonable price directly from Amazon.com and it was Delivered promply this is my third panasonic shaver and i personally think they make the best Electric shavers out There another bonus is its Dual Internatonal voltage plus Moustache Trimmer !</li>
    <li> I have been enjoying this shaver for over a couple of months.  I wish that I actually purchased this before when I started to look.  I never thought that an electric shaver would actually cut so close as a razor.  I hope that they do not stop producing this shaver.</li>
    <li> very good, it&#x27;s very useful and easy to use.</li>
    <li> Of all the electric razors that I purchased over the years, this is by far my favorite.  It shaves closely and is very quick. I also like how easily it cleans.  Would definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> Excellent all around shaver. Close shave and good features.</li>
    <li> This review will address a DRY SHAVE ONLY as I&#x27;ve never used this product for a wet shave. I purchased it to replace a Braun 7505 that I&#x27;d had for years. The reviews on Amazon were so overwhelmingly positive for the ES-LA63 that I decided to order it online, which I prefer not to do with razors b/c it makes returning them more difficult. I have a thick beard and was hoping this model would reduce the shaving time I had with my Braun. I was disappointed. After using it for a month I&#x27;m sorry to say it takes me longer to shave with the Panasonic. At a $300 MSRP that&#x27;s just not acceptable (I got it on sale for $150).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For men with lighter beards this razor may work just fine, but I still think it&#x27;s overpriced. My sense is that you&#x27;re paying for bells and whistles you don&#x27;t really need: e.g. the detailed display with battery life and cleaning notification. Also, the head is quite large. It&#x27;s fine on my cheeks but not so good on my upper lip, chin and neck. Also, the trimmer is smaller than on Braun shavers and it&#x27;s difficult to deploy it. I have to push quite hard to get it to pop up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just purchased a new Braun 380s for half the price of the Panasonic ES-LA63 and it outperforms the Panasonic. Again, every man&#x27;s beard is different, but from my experience this razor is overpriced and overrated. I&#x27;m sticking with Braun.</li>
    <li> This is my 4th (over 15 years) panasonic linear wet dry shaver and they keep getting better. I am amazed at how quickly and closely this one shaves my face.</li>
    <li> It was great until after 2 years of use she began acting weird then when I opened it I was shocked by the prescence of water inside all of the shaver and on the battery. I am really disappointed</li>
    <li> This actually does shave my head closer then my 5 blade razor but in order to do that it takes 2 to 3 times as long. I used it wet in the shower, Didn&#x27;t seem to do as good of a job dry. Other problem I had was the frequency I needed to cut my hair. If I didn&#x27;t do it every other day it took even longer. So a great shave on my head with exceptions.</li>
    <li> I returned my first shaver within two months because the LED screen became scrambled but cleared up when allowed to dry for 24 hours. I use the shaver in the shower and it is kept on a rack above the shower head but water does get into the workings of the display. The new razor does the exact same thing but the shave is great and now it&#x27;s been 2 years and the battery still lasts 2 weeks with me shaving my bald head every day.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t worry about wasting the water because we never use more than the minimum we&#x27;re charged for. It&#x27;s time for me to buy another because I know it&#x27;s just a matter of time before the batteries give out and it needs new blades and foil.</li>
    <li> First week of ownership, but this is the best electric shaver I&#x27;ve ever owned.  As close to a blade as I&#x27;ve ever felt.</li>
    <li> This is my third Panasonic shaver, and easily the best. Aside from the bulkier head of the Arc 4, I have no reservations saying this is a vast improvement over my old Arc 3. It glides much easier and I only have to make a couple of passes to get to smooth skin. Hardly any irritation, although I&#x27;ve also recently switched up my products to include King of Shaves shave oil and a higher quality shave lotion. Still, of all the electric shavers I&#x27;ve ever used, from Norelco to Braun, Panasonic has always been hands down my favorite. Hence, this being my third one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t mind not having the cleaning station. I don&#x27;t have the counter space, and having owned a few shavers in the past that included them, I find it to be more of a nuisance than anything. The cartridges and the filters and the noise. Soap and water does just as well.</li>
    <li> As a long-user of older, similar-style Panasonic razors, I&#x27;ve been very unhappy with this one since I started with it.  I&#x27;ve given it a 3-week trial now (long enough for my skin to &amp;#34;adjust&amp;#34;) and continue to have the same issues.  I have 2 main problems with it:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. The shave:  when I shave dry (as I did with my previous Panasonic), the thing doesnt give a very close shave. If I press down a little harder, I cut myself or get that surface &amp;#34;burn&amp;#34; kind of cut that oozes blood a little bit.  When I shave wet (with water and shaving cream), it really cuts me deep.  This has been my main issue, and hasn&#x27;t gotten any better with time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. The head on this thing is HUGE.  Makes it very difficult to shave your upper lip and in the curves of your neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;ve found this thing to be extremely disappointing and do not recommend it for the price.</li>
    <li> Did  not give a close shave. Expected more from the wet shave but this was not very good either. If you are seeking a close shave buy another razor.</li>
    <li> My old Panasonic gave a better closer shave. Sent it  Back.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used electric shavers for 50+ years. I&#x27;ve tried several models from all the major brands. This is the best yet. I get the closest, most comfortable shaves I ever have. It&#x27;s not cheap, but as as an Amazon Gold Box special it was nicely discounted. Great shaver, super deal!</li>
    <li> It shaves good but not as close as Norelco lift and cut shaver which I am replacing.&lt;br /&gt;Does not get the hair on my neck, have to press hard to get them.</li>
    <li> Husband loves it.  No more nicks, face is nice and smooth.  Shaves while watching the news.  Makes a great gift.</li>
    <li> Great gift for my friend! Great price for me! Great tool for my friend!&lt;br /&gt;My friend said he loves it very much!</li>
    <li> This is the best electric razor I have ever owned. KUDOS TO PANASONIC!!! Before this razor I was using a Braun (admittedly an older model) which did an okay job. But back to my Panasonic ES-LA63-S razor. The shaves I am getting from this razor are second to none! They are as good as the best blades on the market today. And, that was right out of the box. No waiting 30 days as the owners manual suggests to get the best results. Due to the newness and unfamiliar shape of this razor, it did take a few days for my hands to familiarize themselves and get the right feel on holding and handling it but, now it is USER FRIENDLY!</li>
    <li> I bought a smaller, cheaper Panasonic shaver 2 years ago.  Just when I needed to buy a new head for it, and was wishing I had bought a more expensive model, Amazon cleverly send me a notice that this one was on sale!  The new head would have been about $30, and this was just $100, so I sprung for the extra $70 and now own one of these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like the earlier Panasonic that I&#x27;ve owned, it&#x27;s a very rugged machine.  It&#x27;s completely sealed, so you can shave in the shower, although I don&#x27;t.  But you can also clean it by removing the head and running it under a running faucet, which works great.  This one has a larger shaving head than my previous one, so it shaves more quickly.  It also swivels nicely to track your face, making shaving easier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can&#x27;t shave while it&#x27;s charging, but in 5 minutes it&#x27;ll charge enough to shave you, so that&#x27;s not really a disadvantage.  It has a gauge so that you can see how much charge is left.  I don&#x27;t take the charger when I go away for just a weekend--I&#x27;ve never come close to using all the charge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It comes with a nice case that protects it well.  I wish the case also held the charger, for those longer trips.  But it doesn&#x27;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another nice feature is the lock on the power switch.  When you turn it on, you can lock it on so that it won&#x27;t turn off while you&#x27;re shaving if you happen to bump it.  Also, when you&#x27;re traevling, and if like me you may not have brought your charger, lock the power switch in the off position so that your luggage doesn&#x27;t turn it on and discharge it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I think this is a terrific product at a reasonable price.</li>
    <li> Very quiet, fast, and really hugs the curves of your face well. Works dry, with shave gel or foam for a close, comfortable shave with NO RAZOR BURN, no matter what you may be shaving.</li>
    <li> I have had two older models both with the linear motor. I have the es-la63, BTW the es-la93 is the same shaver plus the Vortex stand (plus display extras for the cleaner). Great  product. Note the Braun as well as the older Panasonic&#x27;s  do not incorporate a convex arc in the foil shape. I think this is a key feature here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shaver is much more usable without the \\&quot;foil frame\\&quot; where the black foil \\&quot;carrier\\&quot; is exposed. This way the shaver is much easier to get closer under the nose and easier to see what you are doing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just remove the foil frame then remove the foil carrier from  the frame. The foil is not reversible so note the orientation, the lone hair cutter goes toward the trimmer.  Then snap the carrier (only) back on the shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But what to do about securing the cap? I made an elastic \\&quot;chin strap\\&quot; to hold the cap on. Using one of those hair bands with a hole (3/16 drill bit BY HAND) where each release tab \\&quot;bulge\\&quot; is. The \\&quot;chin\\&quot; being that area under the pivot.  Just knot the band on the outside of the cover just like you would for a hat strap. Also if you cut the, now unnecessary, corners with a pair of dykes the cap goes on easier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; For the longer and stubborn  neck hairs use the trimmer but drag it up your neck (upside down) with the foil facing down. This shaver now is a Five Star!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I thought the blank display while shaving was an oversight but if it  showed the time I would check it often and slow my shave time.</li>
    <li> There is so much to love about this razor,my last razor was a Panasonic ES7109 that i thought&lt;br /&gt;was a pretty good preformer but the ES-LA63-S is better in every way from the 4-blade cutting&lt;br /&gt;system to the shaving head that will move up and down and side to side to follow the contours&lt;br /&gt;from the neck up to the face and 14,000 cycles per minute cutting rate that results in a close stright razor like shave!</li>
    <li> I got this for my husband, who shaves his face and head every day.  Every few months he needs a new razor. Here&#x27;s a hot tip: find the most recent model, then find the most recently retired model - that&#x27;s the best deal!</li>
    <li> I had a previous Panasonic foil shaver for 4 years, so I knew these held up (I did replace the heads a couple of times). But when we dropped that and busted it, I thought I&#x27;d try out this 4 blade version. I thought the last one was great, but this one is phenomenal.  VERY easy to use, fantastic shave (far better than a blade), quiet, and holds its charge longer than my old one. Use some shaving gel and this shaver, and you&#x27;ll never switch back.  And at least this one can be purchased without those silly cleaning mechanisms. I had one for my old one and used it maybe 5 times. You can clean them very easily with soap and water, so those cleaning docks are just a gimmick.</li>
    <li> Great Razor. Close shave and very smooth. Very easy to use. I use it with shaving cream and really works for me.</li>
    <li> I love it. very nice look and solid finish and feel. very close and smooth shave. specially using with foam or gel it really does and awesome job. I would recommend.</li>
    <li> I bought this razor a little over a year ago and I am loving it this far.  My night job requires that I be clean-shaven and I was sick of using the cheap, disposable 2-blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can keep it in my backpack and use it anywhere!  It is an incredibly close shave when used dry, and it&#x27;s not rough on the skin either.  One full battery charge lasts through six or seven uses, and it&#x27;s incredibly easy to clean (just run it under warm water while using the &amp;#34;turbo mode&amp;#34; every fourth or fifth time).</li>
    <li> Does the job pretty well,if you don&#x27;t shave for a few days It may struggle a bit and take longer to get a clean shave,and the size of the shaving head seams a bit bulky for tight spots,but overall does a good job and I would recommend this shaver!!!</li>
    <li> shen qi de shen qi.bu shi zhong guo ren kan bu dong.&lt;br /&gt;bi na ge bolang de hai yao hao yong ne .</li>
    <li> I have not used an electric shaver since the mid-1980&#x27;s.  When I was in college, I used a blade, had a decent Trac-II compatible razor, and stuck with it for decades.  However I have found myself cutting my face more and more lately, so I thought I would give an electric another shot.  I read reviews and found this one to be the best bang for the buck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I am very happy with this shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From what I have read, there are good and bad aspects to all of these products.  The bad that I read didn&#x27;t seem so bad, and people liked the shave they got, which is why I went for this one.  There may be better ones out there - I don&#x27;t know where one goes to &amp;#34;try out&amp;#34; electric shavers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I like:&lt;br /&gt;- Shave is close, albeit not as close as a blade, but apparently it never is with an electric.&lt;br /&gt;- Wet/Dry compatible.  I thought I would be shaving in the shower.  After a few weeks, I am more comfortable shaving before I get in the shower, so wet/dry is not as important, but still getting it wet is not something I have to worry about.  Also helps with my next point:&lt;br /&gt;- Can be cleaned simply by taking the foil off and running under water.  Very simple, and no bulky stand, outlet required, cleaning solutions or cartridges to replace.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I don&#x27;t like:&lt;br /&gt;- Takes longer than I thought it would to shave.  This may not be any better with any other electrics, though.  I have to go over my face on multiple angles to get a close shave.  It probably takes just as long with a blade, and I had to go up and down that way too, but I thought the process would be quicker.&lt;br /&gt;- It will not handle multiple days growth.  The first time I tried it out, I had 3 days worth of growth and it took a LONG time and many passes to get it all.  Even then, there were definitely spots where I noticed afterwards that I had missed.  Granted, this was the first time I used it, and perhaps I would have a better idea of how to tackle that kindof beard with this thing now that I have used it for a month, but I&#x27;m sure it would not be my usual 3-4 minute shave.  This is another issue that I would not be surprised to be the case with ANY electric shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Battery life is worth mentioning.  They say it will last 45 minutes, which is definitely top end.  I would estimate it at more like 30.  It tells you how long it has been on each time you turn it off, so I know I&#x27;m using it for 3-4 minutes a shave, and I won&#x27;t get 10 shaves out of it.  This does not bother me very much, as I shave with a blade on Monday morning, then use the electric Tuesday through Friday, then plug it in, but I definitely think it is worth pointing out to maintain buyer expectations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having not tried another electric shaver in the past 28 years, I don&#x27;t know how this compares to others, but I would be very comfortable recommending this to a friend.</li>
    <li> The closest shave in my experience with electric razors that included my Braun and Norelco. The shave is right up there with old fashion blade shaving. I have only used this as a dry razor in the first couple of months. I was a little concerned how close of a shave that I would get under my nose with such a large head on the razor. It hasn&#x27;t been an issue at all. It&#x27;s also very good about keeping the whiskers/stubble contained in the razor. My Braun would sprinkle whiskers everywhere despite cleaning it every day. I only clean this Panasonic 1 time a week. Easy. The battery lasts about 10 shaves or so which is the longest of any razor that I used. The noise level is acceptable. I have been loyal to Braun but this Panasonic has converted me. Try it and you will believe too.</li>
    <li> I recently purchased a 8103s (another panasonic shaver) and was extremely impressed by the quality of the product considering the price.  I was so impressed that I wanted to upgrade to a better shaver (it didn&#x27;t get the hairs under my neck however), so thanks to panasonic&#x27;s liberal return policy, I went for a more expensive and higher spec model: the esla63s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is an amazing razor.  I shave my head daily, as well as my face, and when used wet, it cuts close, comfortable, with no irritation or cuts- period.  Now, the best part is that it actually cuts the hairs on my neck, which like most men, tend to be the most sensitive spots, as well as the thickest hairs.  It cuts them close, not perfectly, but damn close- i&#x27;d venture to say closer than with the grain.  Now, everywhere else on my face is just as close as close as shaving against the grain.  Unless you stretch the skin, you really couldn&#x27;t tell the difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For head shaving:  The razor cuts through the hair effortlessly.  The biggest advantage that this shaver has is that: 1.) the head swivels in all directions, and 2.) the shaving head is larger allowing for a better indication of when all the blades are touching the skin.  The 14,000 rpm motor is a big upgrade over the 13,000 motors, and the second motor in the razor head does dramatically help the shaver get hairs that earlier models miss.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t go with a dry shaver ever, nor would I waste my money on a cleaning stand.  Just use Dawn, antibacterial soap, in a coffee cup with slightly warm water to clean the shaver.  The cleaning cartridges from panasonic are basically just that anyway.  As far as the comparing it to the Braun 790- the esla63 wins in terms of specifications hands down, has one more blade, and can be used wet- plus it&#x27;s cheaper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It won&#x27;t cause razor bumps, because it cuts the hair the same way a straight razor does, at skin level, without an angled cut.  This makes it perfect for sensitive skin, individuals who get break outs, as well as those with curly hair.  I couldn&#x27;t recommend it enough.  It&#x27;s worth the price.</li>
    <li> The LCD display broke after only owning this product for three months. While the shaver performs well, it&#x27;s pretty ridiculous considering the price I paid for this to happen. Do not recommend at all!</li>
    <li> After one year of smooth shaving experience with pleasure, it died last week without any in-advance signal, it could not be turned on or activated, nothing from LCD even connect the power cord. I seldom wet shave and did baby the shaver all the time, no water or condensation inside.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For such an expensive shaver over 150, I had expected much more than only a-year life span. Considering the online purchase, have to bargain with Panasonic about warranty. Anyway I turned to my 8-year workhorse -- Braun 8585 after installing new head.</li>
    <li> Best electric shaver by far!</li>
    <li> I have been using the shaver for about two and half years.  This is the best electric shaver I have ever used, but the LCD display has a problem.  It breaks down every 4 or 5 months although the saver works fine.  I called Panasonic Customer service and they told me to send it for repairs.  I did not send it for repairs because I heard that they do not actually repair your shaver but send you another refurbished shaver, which I think is a very unhygienic practice.  I have found a simple solution to fix the problem - open the razor, remove the battery and let it dry overnight and then reassemble it.  It fixes the LCD display.  I think either overcharging, using it after the battery level is at 10% or moisture causes the LCD display to break down, although I never found any moisture inside the shaver.  I do not understand why Panasonic cannot fix this simple problem.  Except for the LCD issue I would have rated it 5 stars.</li>
    <li> Keep your blades, you&#x27;ll need them.  The Panasonic LA63-S like many other highly-touted electric razors does not shave nearly as close as a Schick Hydro blade or the popular Gillette Fusion and much less satisfactory than a good double edge.  I have used, in over 45 years of shaving, razors from Braun, Norelco, and Remington.  All, including this one, exhibit certain features that claim a better shave and and they all do what they claim...simply, they cut whiskers.  Where they all fail is in the closeness of the shave.  If you&#x27;re not too concerned with feeling stubble a couple hours after using the Panasonic, or any other electric regardless of cost, electrics may be appropriate for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The LA63-S is probably one of the better shavers with decent build quality, easy claning, and without the extra burden of cleaning stations, liquids, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Is it worth it?  Yes, provided you understand it is not a substitute for a blade.</li>
    <li> I have had at least 10 different Panasonic wet/dry shavers over the past many years.This one is the best yet. Here&#x27;s why:    1. Virtually no vibration against skin when in use  2. Swivel head is better designed than on their previous shavers; this one actually follows the contours of one&#x27;s face instead of moving all over the place  3. Quiet  4. Faster shave time, due to increased CPMs to 14K  5. Ultra smooth shave. The other Panasonic wet/drys were great, but this one approaches the closeness of a straight edge. It was worth paying for the upgrade and the ES8103S Arc3 I was using still works fine. I use a Gillette five blade power glide razor on my face and neck (shave down) and then shave with the wet/dry. This is the only way, regardless of electric razor, for me to get a close shave. My skin is too sensitive to shave up on my face with a blade.  6. Long time between charges. I can go 3 weeks without recharging. Including cleaning mode after shaving, I probably use it between 1.5 - 2 mins/shave (shaving with a blade first helps reduce the time I spend with the electric, I&#x27;m sure).</li>
    <li> Great razor. I would recommend it anyone.</li>
    <li> Wow...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just received this razor today and used it on both my FACE and HEAD. 100% impressed with the closeness of this razors shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been shaving my head for almost 10 years now with a strait razor because thats the closest shave I could get. Until this razor, I havent used an electric in almost 6 years - and my last one I wouldn&#x27;t dream about using on my head and it often felt like it was just pulling the hair our on my face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Panasonic ES-LA63-S Arc4 Electric Shaver has completely changed my opinion on electric shaving. I cannot go against the grain on my face because of how sensitive my skin is. Because of that, this razor actually gives me a closer shave with NO irritation. My head is another story. I can go in any direction i like on my head with a straight razor for the closest shave.... no way can an electric razor get that close, right? WRONG! This electric razor gets 99% as close as a straight blade with NO IRRITATION. I can barely feel a little stubble if I really press firmly on my head and move my fingers against the grain. So impressed! 1000% recommend!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also used &amp;#34;lectric shave&amp;#34; before shaving.</li>
    <li> Good Product. I actively recommend to you.</li>
    <li> Been using this for over a year now and its the best razor i&#x27;ve ever owned.  I might buy another before they stop making them.</li>
    <li> The shaver foil tends to get hot when shaving during dry mode...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So best to use during showers as water can act as a lubricant..Its like those high-speed machining if you work in CNC industry, you will need coolant to keep the temperature down and also prolong the lifespan of the cutters. Other then that, I think its a really  good electric shaver.</li>
    <li> I have others shavers: Panasonic, Braun, Norelco and all are good to excellent, depend the aspect that you want to describe, but all worth the money without doubt. Now this new one from Panasonic is one of the best in all the aspects: head and face: perfect shave, very smooth and fast, easy to clean and have a plus, is silent (like the Norelco), thing that helps in the early morning shavers. An excellent product, very solid, well made. Hope last long years (My last Panasonic lasted 12 years!).</li>
    <li> It was good for me with heavy beard.</li>
    <li> My first Panasonic Shaver and I&#x27;m very happy with it. Close and easy shave - easy to clean - battery holds a good charge. The device is also very light and easy to hold. I&#x27;ve been a high-end Braun man for decades - this Panasonic is more economical and I&#x27;m overall happier with the performance. Only been using for a few weeks, but so far so good.</li>
    <li> I have previously used Norelco and Braun electric razors because I have sensitive skin. The Panasonic is more comfortable, quicker and produces a closer shave than any electric razor I have ever used.</li>
    <li> My third and best yet Panasonic electric shaver.</li>
    <li> Like most electric shavers I&#x27;ve purchased, this one worked really well right out of the box. Very close shave for an electric. I was a very happy camper.&lt;br /&gt;However, after 7 or 8 uses I found the shaves were not as sharp and close as when the shaver was brand new, although they were still acceptable. It seems like the blades became dull pretty fast.&lt;br /&gt;In summary, I&#x27;m a little disappointed because I thought by paying extra for this pricier model, the long term results would be better than my experience with other electric shavers. I genuinely wanted to be very pleased with this shaver but it was only &#x27;okay&#x27;.  Not a whole lot better than others I&#x27;ve owned; so I&#x27;m sorry to say I was a bit disappointed.</li>
    <li> Shaves closer than my previous 3-headed shaver.</li>
    <li> ive had this shaver now for about 3 weeks, its amazing! ive used many shavers before and they all have sucked, this one has done a great job and it  feels great on my skin!  highly recommended</li>
    <li> a gift for my father in law. it&#x27;s okay.</li>
    <li> Did not imagine an electric shaver would give such close shave without any skin irritation and the beauty of it is I can use my shaving gel. Battery lasts for a week then ten days. I highly recommend this shaver.</li>
    <li> I still prefer a blade, but when you are in a hurry, this is superb.  Five more words required.  One</li>
    <li> Great great razor it does shave close I love it thanks</li>
    <li> I have tried many electric shavers and wanted to get something really good after the last one broke.  Didn&#x27;t want to go top of the range though, and found this one had most of the features of the top of the range model at a much better price - so I grabbed it.  Works great, very happy.</li>
    <li> This is best electric shaver ever!</li>
    <li> A great razor! I have used Braun and Norelco razors over the years, and I would have to say this is the best shaver to date! Especially when used with the shave oil: Shave Secret! Try it!</li>
    <li> I owned an older Panasonic model that I had for almost 10 years and was very happy with it. The construction of the ES-LA seemed less substantial when I first received it and after less than 2 years, the beard trimmer has stopped working and the cheap plastic is starting to discolor to a dark brown. Additionally, the shave is not as good as my previous model, the beard trimmer is way too small, and the bulk of the head makes it awkward to use and to store. I don&#x27;t see any benefit for paying extra money for this model.</li>
    <li> I must say it gives a great shave, BUT the LCD failed after 9 months, so they replaced under warranty. Then the same LCD problem happened after 6 months, so they they sent another replacement. Then that one failed the same way after about a year.  I give up, going with Braun next.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using electric shavers over thirty years and this is the first one I&#x27;ve used that is efficient enough so that I don&#x27;t have to occasionally shave with a blade.&lt;br /&gt;Most of us who have used electric shavers know that there are usually one or two areas that the shaver tends to overlook, usually at the neck line.  Over the course of a few days, it really starts to show and you then have to break out the razor to clean up.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks to the super high motor speed and extremely well made blade assembly, I haven&#x27;t had to.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s also the fastest shave I&#x27;ve had.  I usually finish in under two minutes (the display tells you how long it has been on and then displays remaining battery life in percentage).&lt;br /&gt;When you look at the various models, you&#x27;ll see others that are basically the same unit but includes stands, cleaning systems, etc.&lt;br /&gt;This model just included the shaver, charger, and soft case and I&#x27;m glad I didn&#x27;t get the other options.... and I save a lot of money.&lt;br /&gt;Considering I don&#x27;t have to buy expensive razor blades, I&#x27;m saving even more despite having upgraded to one of the higher priced shavers.</li>
    <li> This razor doesn&#x27;t work any better than the Braun I purchased for $45. Save your money! Make the right choice!</li>
    <li> yes its expensive, but I like the quality of the shave. the charge lasts several days, also easy clean up</li>
    <li> I changed over to Panasonic after using Philips Norelco Arcitec for 5 years. Here are the results&lt;br /&gt;Pros - more power, faster, bigger coverage area and reaches trick ares without much hassle. Does not pull hair, better trimming blade. Charges faster. Cost half.&lt;br /&gt;Cons - Less battery life than Philips, the cut hair does not completely remain in the collecting chamber and end up sprinkling all over the face. The head does not detach completely for safer wet cleaning.</li>
    <li> History:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used electric razors when I first started shaving.  Then I went back-and-forth between wet/blade shaving and electric razors.  Then I tried a couple of the various &#x27;wet shave&#x27; electric razors about 7-10 years ago, my experience was awful (lots of irritation, poor shaves, difficult to clean).  My facial hair is fairly coarse and thick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I was doing the Gillette  5-blade cartridge wet-shave for many years, and that was okay...not great since the cartridges are quite expensive, but the shaves were okay, and didn&#x27;t irritate my skin THAT much, I could get a few shaves out of each cartridge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then, about 6 months ago I got intrigued with all this new elitist &amp;#34;old-timey badger hair brush, double-edged safety blade shave&amp;#34; trend that has become quite popular, with people claiming that this old method actually yields the best shaves.  With all of the videos on You Tube showing big, burly guys with the thickest stubble imaginable shaving their face after bragging about their badger hair shave brushes and fancy blade holders, I was all but convinced that I&#x27;d get the best shave that way.  Wrong...I tried many razors, many creams, soaps, gels, methods, etc., and I couldn&#x27;t get a shave that was EVEN as close and comfortable as when I was using the Gillette cartridge razors.  Sure, double-edged blades ARE cheaper, but my face couldn&#x27;t have cared less about that fact...even after 3 weeks of double-edge razor shaving, the irritation never subsided.  Not to mention that shaving took a frickin&#x27; LONG TIME between foaming a soap with the brush, applying the soap with the brush, shaving, and then having to go over areas again because the single safety blade didn&#x27;t seem to shave adequately closeclose at all...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My experience with this razor:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, feeling discouraged that I&#x27;d find a comfortable, easy shave at all, I started looking up wet-shave electric razors, and came across this Panasonic ES-LA63-S Arc 4.  I shave wet (with a shave gel) with it, and it gives me the absolute BEST shave I&#x27;ve ever had, and even when I have 2 days of stubble, shaving with it is easy and the gel provides an excellent reduction in friction.  Even with a couple days stubble, I can finish a wet/gel shave in 5 minutes.  The shave is closer than almost any shave I&#x27;ve ever had, and I don&#x27;t notice any irritation/discomfort with this razor; doesn&#x27;t even seem like my face had to &#x27;adjust&#x27; to the razor, which is uncommon when changing shave methods.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-Easy, comfortable, and FAST wet (gel) shave&lt;br /&gt;-Comfortable to hold, nice weight&lt;br /&gt;-Easy to disassemble and clean&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-Doesn&#x27;t last a million years on a single charge&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seems like reviews complain about two things with this razor:  The short battery life, and the fact that the razor won&#x27;t operate while the charging cord is plugged in (i.e., if it runs out of battery while shaving, you can&#x27;t plug in the cord and continue shaving).  First, with the short battery life (~50 min), I don&#x27;t have too much of a problem with that.  I can usually finish a shave after 5 minutes of use, so I can typically get at least a week of shaves from the razor.  And plugging the razor in for ~5 minutes yields enough charge to get at least a shave in (from completely dying).  Regarding the fact that the razor won&#x27;t operate with the charging cord plugged in: this is because the razor is designed to operate wet (in the shower/bath)--OF COURSE it shouldn&#x27;t be operated with an electrical cord under wet conditions, so that feature is disabled due to safety.</li>
    <li> I gave it a rating of 2 stars because it grabs individual hairs and yanks them out -- quite painful.  They  urge you to use it for a month before returning it but I can&#x27;t put up with in yanking out hairs for a month to see if it will quit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do like the way you clean it.  It is more convenient than my previous Norelco.  But, I liked the way the Norelco shaved better even if you don&#x27;t count the pulling out hairs which it would also do after the blades got dull</li>
    <li> I like shaving variety;  therefore, I will use an electric razor for a while and then a regular razor/shaving cream a while.  Most of the time it will be electric due to the sheer convenience of not having to use shaving cream and continuously rinsing the razor in the lavatory.  My experience with electric razors has been Norelco and Remington early on, then Braun for the longest time but never a Panasonic until now.  I liked the reviews I was reading on the ES-LA63-S Arc 4 and due to the age of my Braun and the high costs to maintain it and keep it clean, I ordered one.  I read information about allowing time to pass to allow you and your new razor to become accustomed to one another.  I knew the second day I was holding in my hand something I liked. I think I learned enough tricks over the years using an electric shaver that my break-in time would be predictably short.  I already knew that too much pressure on the shaver against the face caused the shaver to get uncomfortably hot.  Likewise, I was &amp;#34;up on&amp;#34; shaving against, with the grain, and across the grain to get an all around close shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only the Braun&#x27;s shave resembles the Panasonic&#x27;s but in my opinion is not as good, nor is the Panasonic as heavy.  I did have to train myself to hold this shaver correctly with my thumb above the power button to avoid cutting it off at unwanted times. Complaints I have read in other reviews concerning poor battery life are not what I am experiencing as I will get about 6 shaves per charge shaving once daily.  I appreciate the fact it will not run connected to the power cord, which was not an oversight on Panasonic&#x27;s part but a planned safety feature because you can use it while you are in the shower.  If charging only 5 minutes gets you your next shave, you shouldn&#x27;t need to plug it in while in the bathroom except to recharge it and then for an hour.  Bottom line, I already know I like this shaver and have your good reviews to thank for purchasing it.  The least I can do is try to furnish a review to those who buy later a reason to do so.  I may shave with gel or shaving cream in the future but it will only be out of curiosity as I am getting a very smooth, close shave dry.  Money well spent and I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> I ordered this after seeing it being sold in the Gold Box deals. This is the first time I am using an electric shaver and I must say I don&#x27;t find it very useful. The shape of the head is such that it does not reach to every point on the face easily. It also takes much longer to shave with this as compared to my older shaver. The battery is also disappointing. While the manual and product description says 45 mins of battery time, in my experience it does not last more than 25 mins and that is barely enough for 3 shaves since average shave time is also on higher side. Overall, I won&#x27;t recommend this product for its price.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this shaver!  It shaves as close as a razor, it has a comfortable &amp;#34;bulk&amp;#34; to it, and is VERY easy to clean.  The replacement screen and blades are inexpensive on Amazon (screen every year and blades every 2 years).  I use it as a wet shaver which makes it a bit more messy but I feel it&#x27;s worthwhile as it makes the experience very comfortable.  I am currently using canned Neutrogena shave cream but I&#x27;m eager to try Dollar Shave Club&#x27;s Shave Butter (I used this when I was using a razor and absolutely loved it).  Your skin will need a few weeks to adjust to this shaver but that&#x27;s to be expected.  You will not regret this purchase!</li>
    <li> Due to my sensitive skin I could only shave once a week.  After some serious research I decided to give this product a try.  This coupled with the Lectric Pre-Shave has changed my shaving life.  I am able to shave every other day and that is an amazing feeling.  Before this I have been using the Gillette Mach 4 coupled with Proraso sensitive skin shaving lather, pre shave balm, and post shave cream.  I am even able to run my razor over my face after the initial shave with the Panasonic if I want to tighten up that smooth feeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have sensitive skin preventing you from shaving with any regularity then this is the shaver for you!!</li>
    <li> This is my first electric shaver EVER! And I must say I am very pleased. It takes a while to get used to but once you get the hang of it you&#x27;ll be shaving quick and efficiently. I bought this because shaving with razors really hurts my skin and makes me break out. Thankfully this shaver does not cause problems for me. At first the after feeling was odd but you get used to it and its no big deal. I didn&#x27;t have any problems with the unit charging slow like some people reported, and the charges hold fairly well. I really have no complaints. Give it a go y&#x27;all!</li>
    <li> Just started using this shaver and am liking how it gives a clean close shave. I have sensitive skin and so far no irritations. Great buy</li>
    <li> Just got it before Christmas and I like so far.Does better than my old Norelco.&lt;br /&gt;But it&#x27;s charge last 2 weeks and the Norelco lasted about a month.&lt;br /&gt;The trimmer works better though.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for last 3 weeks and overall is not even close to the Brun shavers in many ways such as keeping the full charge, the noise, and the fexibility and confort of the shaver head. It takes me twice as long with this shaver to shave verses the Brun..</li>
    <li> Have had it for about a month and still getting used to it ... haven&#x27;t yet found the perfect &amp;#34;lubricant&amp;#34;.  But am very pleased with the package overall.  Gives a nice, clean finish with very little effort.  Doesn&#x27;t last a full 18 hours like the blade did, but a quick &amp;#34;touch-up&amp;#34; shave for a night out is an easy fix.  I changed from blade shaving because sun-induced skin lesions were being exacerbated by the blade.  The ES-LA63-S has been much more skin-friendly.  Old Norelco and Braun electrics weren&#x27;t &amp;#34;cutting it&amp;#34; [sic.] and were sent to Goodwill.</li>
    <li> I have been using an electric shaver for about 3 years, since I got tired of bleeding like a stuck pig every time I used my Mach3, and paying $40-50 for new blades every few months. I got a Panasonic ES7037 wet/dry for only 20 from the Egg place. I liked it better than the razor, but it took 8-10 minutes of going over and over each area, pressing harder, pulling skin- a real chore. It worked slightly better in the shower, but still took a while, and wasn&#x27;t all that close a shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got an e-mail from Panasonic, who were selling this shaver for 105 just before Xmas. It was 131 on Amazon, but then a 30 dollars off coupon magically appeared, and I pulled the trigger.  Really glad I did. I charged this baby up (it came 40% charged and took only a half-hour to hit 100), glanced at the \\&quot;manual\\&quot; and hit the On switch.  2:49 later my face was smooth as silk. Being used to the long rough shaves with the 7037, this was like going from a Lada to a Lexus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The features are fine. I don&#x27;t really care how long I&#x27;ve been shaving, but battery remaining (in 10% increments) is handy.  It beats 3 little blinking LED lights. It charges fast. The locking head is nice: I mostly use it in the locked position, as I find that works better for me. The large size of the head is not a problem, as some reviewers have stated. I have a relatively small face, and have no trouble shaving my upper lip at all. Manual cleaning is quick and easy, I just rinse and dry, and only use the soap &amp; turbo cleaning every other time. It&#x27;s very low maintenance. I actually bought new blades for the 7037 once, but it did not seem to make any difference in its performance. I don&#x27;t think $50 for new blades and a foil (if needed) every 2-3 years is all that bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t speak to the longevity of this shaver, or its water-resistance, as some have noted the LED display winking out. I use it dry, and try not to let any water get near the LED screen during cleaning. And it is no noisier than the older electric I had, only much higher pitched. But I have it turned on for about 1/3 the time. I am extremely happy with this shaver, glad I bought it (at a reasonable price), and would highly recommend it to any man inclined to electric shaving. There is always an adjustment period going from razors to electric, but going from an older, cheaper, electric as I did, this was a huge upgrade.the older electric I had, only much higher pitched.

    <li> Got this shaver for my husband for Christmas and he loves it and so do I. Very smooth shave and none irritating. I think his only complaint is that his beard doesn&#x27;t grow fast enough so he can use it more often.</li>
    <li> My husband has  owned many Panasonic Shavers over the years and he says this is the best one by far.</li>
    <li> I used to use Norelco rotary razors way back when, but they never shaved very close. For a number of years I just went back to a blade, but shaving everyday with a blade tears up my skin. This razor, when used &amp;#34;wet&amp;#34; (with shaving cream) works almost as good as a blade, without any of the skin irritation. I use the Neutrogena shaving cream, which is not foamy--you just need a small dallop about the size of a dime, and some hot water, and 3 minutes later my skin feels great and is nice and smooth with no irritation.</li>
    <li> This is the best electric shaver I have ever used. Dry or wet, the results are amazing. Cleaning is very simple.</li>
    <li> My husband loves this razor. He has a very tough beard and it works great.Would and do recommend it to everyone.</li>
    <li> After reading a lot of consumer research I went with the Panasonic ES-LA63-S.&lt;br /&gt;Its a wet and dry shaver, doesn&#x27;t need an expensive cleaner kit - its a snap to wash under the hot tap - and recharges quickly for a two weeks worth of use. The screen tells you how much charge you have left and how much you have put back when you are charging. The shave is smooth and comfortable. I have been using it about a month with no issues so I don&#x27;t know yet about how it will hold up over time but it feels and looks well made.</li>
    <li> It is better then most but still does not give a seriously close shave without pushing onto my face really hard many times.  I clean it and add shaver spray for the blades. But I can see it is not the best Panasonic. I must pass over my face 3-4 times, other Panasonic shaver were must better, but they were $400, so you do get what you pay for. Next shaver I buy will be the highest price Panasonic.</li>
    <li> This is my first electric shaver. I changed as I was experiencing irritation from conventional shavers. The shave from the Panasonic is just as good as a mach 3 shaver. very happy</li>
    <li> This shaver works really well and cuts hair perfectly. There are a few spots that I have to go over multiple times but overall it is a quick and easy way to get a wet or dry shave. It is also extremely easy to clean!</li>
    <li> OH yeah, I bought this for my friend, and he said it&#x27;s very good and useful, I give this 5star.</li>
    <li> This product is very easy to use, it is recommended that you buy. The price is very good, very clean shave.</li>
    <li> I send it as a gift to my dad,hope that he will be glad with the cool big guy, LOL。</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this product in my hand for less than 24 hours, and as for the product itself, it seems fine.  But dear shopper, let me warn you of a caveat emptor:  Panasonic customer service.  It&#x27;s abysmal.  Firstly, they ask you to register your 2 year manufacturer warranty either online or via mailing in a warranty card.  This being 2014 and all, I opted to go to their website.  They ask you for the serial #. Then their form tells you that the only serial # on the damn device doesn&#x27;t have enough characters (needs 9 - 11 digits or \\&quot;blank\\&quot;) but the serial # on the shaver they sent me is only 7 digits long (and no, I am not confusing it with the model #).  Do I leave it blank and then have my service denied when something goes wrong?  To find out what to do, I call the 1-800 number listed on the warranty registration card.  I wait for 25 minutes to talk to a human being, except the person who answers tells me she is at the audio products department and will have to connect me over to the shaver dept.  35 minutes later, I&#x27;m still on hold (annoyingly enough, a message came on 30 min ago informing me that my \\&quot;wait time should be less than one minute\\&quot; --- yeah right! ).  I can&#x27;t imagine what a headache it would be actually getting this obscenely customer-hostile bureaucracy that can&#x27;t even provide the correct phone # on the product literature that comes in the damn shaver box to file a warranty claim, but rest assured, any warranty or promise of service from Panasonic is purely theoretical.  If this thing breaks, be expected to spend easily the purchase price in your pain and hassle before even getting to talk to a human being about what is wrong with your shaver.</li>
    <li> great for face, not great for neck, though just use the trimmer part to get my neck and smooth it down the little more with the overall razor.  Water proof is very nice and cleans easily.</li>
    <li> Great shaver not as close of course as a blade. But the next best thing and did not irritate my husbands face. We are both happy with this shaver. Yes, we would definitely recommend it!!! And no irritation can&#x27;t beat it.</li>
    <li> I originally bought the Panasonic ES-LT41-K which offered a shave no better than the inexpensive little Braun I use for traveling.  Then I bought the latest, greatest Norelco, which wouldn&#x27;t even hold a charge much less give a decent shave. So I upgraded to this Panasonic model for another $42.  Does it shave better than the ES-LT41-K?  Yes, but the difference is not significant. And one had better shave every 24 hours because if you skip a day, this electric shaver is worthless.  You will have to use a straight razor.  I will say this without equivocation, my Schick disposable razors shave better than this $120 Panasonic electric shaver. If straight razors did not irritate my neck, I would never bother with these electric shavers. You shouldn&#x27;t either.</li>
    <li> Very pleased with the motor speed. My previous panasonic shaver would start out running fast but quickly slow down as the battery drained. Very happy to say that this one keeps running at top speed. Been using it for a few weeks and battery is showing 30% but it still shaves like it&#x27;s at 100%.</li>
    <li> This razor is a huge improvement from my previous razor but as close as a blade shave? No.&lt;br /&gt;It takes about 6 minutes to complete my shave and you really need to go over and over again to do a reasonable job.&lt;br /&gt;You would think with todays technologies there would be a more effective shaver out there. I have yet to see it.</li>
    <li> and I strongly prefer an electric razor made for men for my bikini area and legs over the pitiful selection of women&#x27;s razors. I just received this a couple of weeks ago so I will have to come and update in 6 months or so. So far, I have only tried the dry shave and it was great for what I wanted. Love the trimmer. I have EXTREMELY sensitive skin which is why I only can use electric razors for bikini and this was close enough without irritation. Nice razor. Previously owned a Panasonic with 3 blade, would have to look up the name. That razor was good enough for a couple of years then the battery started not holding charge. Will update this review later.</li>
    <li> It works fine.  It seemed like it worked better at first than the Braun razor that it replaced but a year later, I think that it no longer shaves as closely as it used to.</li>
    <li> Best price and quick delivery.  This unit is better than the Braum and is half the price.  Use it for two weeks with a little water on you face and you&#x27;ll get  very close shave.</li>
    <li> This replaced a panasonic that is no longer available.  He decided he likes it better, despite his first impressions. He is happy.</li>
    <li> Second shaver of this type.</li>
    <li> Though this model does give a very close shave, I find its head way too big to accurately figure out where it is shaving, especially with a beard. The designers seemed to purposely make this head larger than it needs to be.</li>
    <li> This is a great shaver.... much better than the older model. Clean and a comfortable shave. Works great with a special hydrating conditioning cleansing gel I made for it. Wow! what an amazing adjunct. Hope to make this product available very soon for anyone who wants to experience an awesome shave without irritation.  When you rinse off your skin, the hydration stays behind, with a softer after feel too. No silicones, petroleum  by-products or illusions are used. This real combination of actives penetrates and hydrates deeply and the skin takes advantage of it. When the shave is over your skin is really different and better for it. Special sugars, in the form of a saccharide, with unique moisture binding amino acids, attach themselves to the skin&#x27;s structure. This water binding molecular mechanism with  B vitamin combinations minimize skin stresses and irritation during and after your shave.</li>
    <li> A great razor.  Battery life is a little on the low side, but I am seldom far from a place to charge it.</li>
    <li> Best shaver I ever purchased.  Recommended to a friend who still uses a razor.</li>
    <li> Well, mine died this morning after 22 months. Funny, as I just threw the box out with all of the info last week!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using Panasonic wet-drys for well over 20 years, and this model is pretty heavy compared to the others. Nice shave, but for $150+, I&#x27;d expect it to make it past the 2-year mark. Unfortunately, I am dependent on a wet electric, so I&#x27;ll have to hold my nose and buy like my 8th Panasonic wet-dry, knowing it will ultimately fail and I&#x27;ll be writing another dissatisfied review about it here. Guess I&#x27;ll have to go up a model with the ES-LV61-A and drop $266 and hopefully it will last 3+ years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Panasonic razors shave well, but really suck in terms of reliability. It&#x27;s just a matter of when, not if, you&#x27;ll be buying another one.</li>
    <li> My father likes it very much!</li>
    <li> This foil shaver by Panasonic has really changed the way I shave. It is easy to clean, it is rechargeable, and it I can use my favorite shaving cream while I shave. With the ergonomic design, wet and dry use, I can shave in the shower, or I can shave on my way to work. Either way, the battery lasts a long while, it can be easily cleaned under running water, and the swivel head really gets into those hard to reach spots that I didn&#x27;t get with other electric shavers.</li>
    <li> fantastic electric saver for face/head</li>
    <li> I got this for my boyfriend for Christmas. It&#x27;s a bit big, but he says he loves it. It does take some getting used to, especially if you&#x27;re used to an old-fashioned straight razor shave. It&#x27;s pretty light though even though it&#x27;s big. Comes with the charger and leather case. I would say for the price, it&#x27;s definitely worth it.</li>
    <li> The wet/dry shaving system is the best. If you don&#x27;t feel like putting on shaving creme, who says you cant do this in bed or while waiting at a red light! It is that easy. I have had to replace this the blades/foil part twice in 2 years. The outer foil vibrates giving you the closest shave. There is also a trimmer which is great to get your sideburns. Over all awesome electric razor and good as a gift!</li>
    <li> This unit provides a close shave with minimal effort.  I use it in the shower after applying shaving gel and appreciate the ease and convenience.  I don&#x27;t find it to be too loud.  It can easily go a week between charges.  If an extra-neat shave is required, I still make a quick pass over the longer, more sporadic hairs on my neck, where the razor seems to leave a few stragglers.</li>
    <li> shaves super fast and super close. However, it is probably not for people with alot of neck hair as it can takes a few strokes to get all the neck hairs. also it gets hot pretty fast. All in all my first dry shave was super close.  I have tried brauns and norelcos and this panasonic..It&#x27;s the best electric razor you can buy (maybe besides the arc 5 panasonics).</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for almost a year now and I just love it. One of the best electric shavers I&#x27;ve ever used. Very pleased with this purchase.</li>
    <li> Been using this for about a year. It is acceptable, but (a) is very very noisy, and (b) I have to keep shaving over the same spots many times to get a uniformly smooth shave. I thought I was upgrading from my older Norelco, but in fact the Norelco outperformed the more expensive Panasonic. Will not buy another Panasonic.</li>
    <li> Dear Panasonic:  I am returning my Model ES-LA63-S for replacement.  As you see by the accompanying receipt, I purchased this shaver on December 11, 2013.  I purchased it as a birthday gift to myself to replace the Panasonic ES4283A that I purchased on August 31, 2012, which was a replacement for the Panasonic ES8103S I purchased on December 31, 2009 as a replacement for the Panasonic ES8243A purchased on April 15, 2009.  This last was a replacement for the ES8152NC I bought on July 13, 2006.  In fact, I bought three of these, including two for my sons.  My purchase history goes back further, but you get the picture.  Why you may wonder have I acquired so many Panasonic shavers over so short a time.  There are five main reasons: 1) The close shaves they give are unparalleled.  2) I like to shave in the shower, thus all of the models I have bought are wet/dry.  3) The motors have never failed, although one or two of the recent ones have at times wheezed as though out of breath.  4) The blades last for a reasonable time.  5) The displays do not last.  What happens to the displays?  There is an assortment of failures that begin as small quirks such as a missing diode in a number--for example a 5 may display without its top so that it appears as an upside down question mark--to complete failure, which is the case with the one I am returning.  Until this most recent purchase, I convinced myself that I had just been unlucky with the displays.  However the one on this razor began to fail after only two months and like the others the severity of its failure progressed.  The failures were tolerable at first and through the years I had become accustomed to Panasonic&#x27;s kludge digitals, so I overlooked them.  But then one day everything displayed--blade change, wash, charge, and the time readouts went haywire.  Recharging brought new variations on this failure.  And then nothing at all displayed.  So, having invested many hundreds of dollars in Panasonic wet/dry razors, the displays on all of which have failed, I decided to return this very expensive one (I also still have its two predecessors if you would like them).  Thanks,  Terry Gilliam  PS Within a week of returning this razor for repair, I received a new one to replace the old.  6/27/2015 update: Nearly seven months after receiving it, the replacement is still giving the usual great shaves and the display is working perfectly.  I&#x27;ve added a star to my original review.  If it lasts a year, I&#x27;ll add another.  7/5/2016 update:  Well, it didn&#x27;t last a year.  The replacement failed within a month of my June 27 update.  The good news is that Panasonic replaced its replacement shaver with another new one.  The unfortunate news is it failed as well.  Throughout, the issue has been the same.  The display goes haywire in 4-6 months.  When I returned the latest replacement I was given this lesson: &amp;#34;Our warranty covers two years from the date of original purchase or 90 days from the latest replacement date. Your two-year warranty has run out and so has the 90 days.&amp;#34;  What really rubbed me the wrong way was that several weeks after sending in the shaver I had heard nothing from Panasonic, so I had to call them to find out status and to get the aforementioned lecture.  When I asked about repairing my shaver, I was told &amp;#34;It wouldn&#x27;t really be worth it; we recommend buying a new one.&amp;#34;  I will.  But it won&#x27;t be a Panasonic.  It seems the product reliability and the manufacturer&#x27;s 90-day warranty are well matched. I&#x27;ve changed my rating to match my experience with the product and manufacturer.</li>
    <li> Overall it&#x27;s a nice product. I have very thick coarse hair and nothing will beat a razor. Compared to a $40 dollar Remington electric shaver that I have had for years, the Panasonic cuts marginally better. The front LED display is a nice touch. If you already have an electric that you are satisfied with, it may not be worth the extra price.</li>
    <li> I got this for my gift to myself this year and believe me, this is the best 98.00 spend ever!!!! This is my first electric shaver that i have kept more than 4 weeks my other ones did not make it 2 weeks and were returned.   I am very pleased with the performance so far and i am looking to be the same for many years to come.   I strongly recommend this shaver</li>
    <li> Got this to replace my ancient Panasonic 2 head linear shaver (ES8801).  Frankly, more heads aren&#x27;t better.  The head assembly is bigger and only goes one way when you are using it.  The clipper is smaller and sharper and because it is hidden behind the head you can make a mistake easier.  I use it, but have still kept my EX8801 in service for trimming.</li>
    <li> I really like the shave that this razor gives.  I just returned a Norelco razor that did not work and got this one instead.  While I was waiting for the Panasonic, I had 3-days whisker growth.  This razor shaved right through all of that dry in less than 5-minutes.  Great shave and did not miss a thing.  The one bad feature of this razor is that the slider button to push out the trimmer attachment gets stuck a lot and it takes a few tries to get the trimmer to flip out.  Either there is something wrong with the trimmer mechanism or something wrong with my razor.  Not going to return it for that.  Overall really like this razor.</li>
    <li> After using a norelco for years, I was at first impressed with the charge time.  The shave was about the same, but with the oversized head I found it really difficult to shave around goatee and mustache.  Never tried it wet, but after using it for a few weeks, I decided I really didn&#x27;t like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, I tried to take Panasonic up on its &amp;#34;30 day money back&amp;#34; guarantee.  At first they told me to contact Amazon (which since I followed their instructions and used it for 30 days, it was outside the Amazon window).  So I told the rep I just wanted my money back.  It turns out that that only applies if the razor is defective, and then it only covers parts and labor.  Their policy is not to give &amp;#34;money back&amp;#34;, and seem to indicate that was an Amazon policy, not Panasonic.  I told them it says it right on the box.  They escalated it for me and said I would get a call back, but that is their policy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They should print &amp;#34;MONEY BACK GUARANTEE&amp;#34; on the box if they don&#x27;t want to honor it.  Just my thoughts.</li>
    <li> Bought this shaver based on Consumer Reports reviews. I have to say, this is the best electric shaver I&#x27;ve ever owned. The foil is so thin, my beard is cut right down to the skin. Of course, it&#x27;s not like a blade shave, but it&#x27;s damn close to it. My neck whiskers grow in all directions, so the shaver doesn&#x27;t do as well there, but it&#x27;s close enough so I don&#x27;t look like I haven&#x27;t shaved my neck. I have not used the shaver wet yet - only dry. But I don&#x27;t use a pre-shave; all I do is wash my face and neck with soap and water and rinse real good. The battery charge lasts about a week for me. And I like the reminder in the display that tells me when it&#x27;s time to clean the shaver (I use warm water only and let it air dry). I highly recommend this electric shaver. I was very pleasantly surprised with its performance.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband as a deal of the day from Amazon on the spur of the moment.  Score, he says it&#x27;s great!  His exact words: it gives a very close shave either wet or dry, is easy to clean, and is compact thus perfect for travel.  He has an average beard and I&#x27;ll vouch for the close shave.  It replaced a Norelco, and he prefers this model because you can run it under water (or just use it in the shower) and it&#x27;s clean.  Quick, easy, great shave &#x3D; perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And I thought Panasonic only made electronics.  Not so, try this.&lt;br /&gt;P.S. - I suggest a no fog shower mirror too.  The two make a great gift!</li>
    <li> This replaced a 3 year old 2 blade Panasonic shaver, and I am so happy I purchased this one.  It gives me an incredible close shave and is very gentle on my skin.  Very happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> I am not required to fill in these reviews when I shop at a local store; I simply do not return if something is wrong.</li>
    <li> This is the absolute best investment i&#x27;ve made in quite sometime. I&#x27;ve been in the Navy for about 10 years and i&#x27;m used to shaving with a razor every day, with irritated/red skin as a result. It took my skin about 1 week to get used to the Panasonic shaver but smooth sailing after that.</li>
    <li> had seen comparisons between the ES-LA63-S and the Panasonic ES8243A (which I own also) and wasn&#x27;t too sure that I would see a tremendous difference, but decided that since my foil/blades needed to be replaced on the ES8243A, that I would give the newest model a try. People had said that the ES-LA63-S does a better job on the jawline and neck since it has the extra degree of freedom, and boy were they RIGHT! I noticed it right away! The locking feature, brighter LCD screen, and extra 1000RPM are a nice touch, but that doesn&#x27;t justify the upgrade enough for me like the extra movement does.</li>
    <li> I have have used Braun shavers for years, but I have had problems with my last two breaking prematurely. I tried this one and it was better than any shaver I ever had. It gave the closest shave in the shortest time, with the least irritation. It is easier to clean, without any expensive cartridges, just using water and soap. It fully charges in just 1 hour.</li>
    <li> Awesome razor! I have used them all, most recently Braun, and believe that the Panasonic ES-LA63-S is the best razor I have ever used.  I realize a razor is highly personal item and what works for one may not apply to another.  For me, the high speed motor and consistent motor speed (does not slow down as the battery wears down) is critical to a good shave every time. With the Braun, I could get a good shave but it took forever and you had to shave the same area many times before a good smooth shave was achieved.  With the Panasonic, one swipe and you are done and I believe the smoothness of the shave is superior. I shave dry but have been told that the wet function but have been told it works even better.  Cleaning is a snap and comes out very clean without using a special cleaning solution or cleaning machine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The list price at the Panasonic website would have priced me out of purchasing this razor but the price at Amazon was in my range.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am very pleased with the razor, recommend it to everyone and did not find a better price from a reputable seller than Amazon.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a nice shaver. Better than before used. But sounds a little higher. Cleaning is very simply. My colleague like it too.</li>
    <li> This electric razor provides a smooth shave.  My beard is relatively light but coarse grey.  Multi blade and double edge razors were causing multiple nicks and cuts on sensitive skin.  This electric razor shaves dry almost as close, with little to no irritation, and no nicks or cuts.  Have not tried it in wet shaving mode but I&#x27;m certain it would perform well.  I&#x27;m extremely pleased at the function and multiple shaves from one charge.  Easy to clean and maintain.</li>
    <li> In less than a year, the display has gone bad. The razor still seems to work ok, but I cannot tell how much juice I have left in it. Also worried that the unit itself will fail. I used it primarily in the shower. Maybe the seals on this model aren&#x27;t up to the task. I probably would not recommend this model to a friend.</li>
    <li> I have tried electric shavers before, but could never make the switch. This razor is comfortable, close shaving and recharges quickly.</li>
    <li> great product. Much better than cheaper ones</li>
    <li> Smooth shave, very comfortable, easy to clean. Better than my previous electric razors, which included Remington, Braun and Norelco razors.</li>
    <li> As a woman who shaves occasionally, was tired of my cheap female shavers (~$30 each) dying every year.  Looked for the best wet/dry shavers on the market and noticed the positive reviews from men and other women for this Panasonic. Swallowed my misgivings about the price and decided to try it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line, this is the best shaver ever and worth every penny.  The tilt action is smooth, the head didn&#x27;t disrupt my skin and the clean up was easy.  Only downside is that the color and styling are too masculine for my taste, but since that&#x27;s who Panasonic is targeting, can&#x27;t complain about it.  Would suggest that Panasonic duplicate this shaver in pink and market it to females. Would open a whole new segment for them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My husband&#x27;s eyes lit up when he saw it because his old razor finally died the day after I opened this.  He tested mine and after a week, he still hasn&#x27;t given it back!  I&#x27;m ordering him one for Christmas.</li>
    <li> I was looking to buy a premium Panasonic if it&#x27;s price ever got reasonable, but this one came along at a good price. Wet or dry is good. Cleaning is good. Shave is close and smooth. Get 10 3 minute shaves. charge is quick. I rate 4.5 stars. better than my DE.</li>
    <li> Let me first say that I have very particular skin when it comes to shaving. This may be a great razor for most men but it was terrible for me. I did a good deal of research when I was choosing an electric razor since I was switching from a blade with the hopes that it would be easier on my face (I asked several people, inculding dermatologists, who all said electrics were easier on skin). I was willing to spend some money since I would be using this so often (I shave about three to four days out of the week).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let me also disclose that I have very thick, and dark facial hair. That being said, not only did this razor not get as close as a balde, it left PATCHES of hair all over my neck and chin. AND, my face broke out terribly! Yes, I seemed to have an alergic reaction to this thing! I gave it two weeks, hoping my skin just needed to get used to it, but it only got worse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This may be a great razor for most but if you have sensitive skin, razor bumps, or any other sort of complication this may only make things worse for you.</li>
    <li> Great shaver, been using mach 3 for years, this one does the trick. use it daily and no problems. seems to be more even than manual, and the grow back is better.</li>
    <li> Really disappointed with this shaver ..I&#x27;ve had cheaper ones that had closer shave ..I bought this and was really excited but tody I shaved and it cut me I&#x27;ve never experienced a thick cut on my neck lol it has horrible dry and wet shave power  returning and going all out I&#x27;m buying the norelco</li>
    <li> BEST shaver I have ever used. I love how you can change out everything, screens, blades AND the battery!&lt;br /&gt;Goodbye Norelco, it was a good 40 year run for you.</li>
    <li> It was time to let my Braun electric shaver go.  It was getting old and loud, wouldn&#x27;t hold a charge past a day or two, and wasn&#x27;t cutting well.  I started doing research about a new Braun shaver, but was reluctantly open to other brands.  While reading reviews on electric shavers on Amazon, this product caught my eye.  It had a large number of reviews and, more importantly, it had a large number of positive reviews so I bought it.  Thank you to all the people who posted in-depth and thoughtful reviews especially those comparing different brands/models, which I read and considered before making my purchase.  I&#x27;ve had this shaver for under a week and it is simply the best electric shaver I&#x27;ve ever had in 25+ years of using an electric shaver.  Amazing:  it works both wet (with water plus a shaving cream/gel/foam) or dry like most other electric shavers.  I&#x27;ve been using it with a shaving gel and it works great.  I can shave my entire face in much less time than I ever could with my Braun -- I&#x27;m done in a matter of minutes.  I get a much closer shave than I ever had using an electric shaver.  The sound of the device (a whine akin to a dental cleaning tool) isn&#x27;t too bad at all.  It isn&#x27;t perfect on hard to reach spots on the neck or under the nose, but that&#x27;s no big deal given the other benefits.  So... so far, so good.  Very good!</li>
    <li> My husband says it shaves very close and he loves it.</li>
    <li> Loving the design.  Great product and closer shave than the previous Braun series 5.</li>
    <li> I very much like this razor and had used in almost daily for about 2 to 3 years but then the battery starded to not hold a charge.  The original battery was charged only after having run down all of the power I would consider replacing the battery but could not find any available batteries to match the original.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for recommending this item to someone considering a wet/dry razor I most likely would do so but caution them about potential battery life.</li>
    <li> I have been a long time user of Norelco and Braun products.&lt;br /&gt;I could never get a close enough shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Braun was good at the face, the Norelco was good at the neck&lt;br /&gt;Never had one that could do both well&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So after looking at reviews and prices, I thought Id give this a try&lt;br /&gt;It knocked my socks off&lt;br /&gt;It does both areas well, and its incredibly close&lt;br /&gt;I think its the high speed of the motor&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only knock is a small one&lt;br /&gt;I cant use it when its plugged in&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s some sort of safety or power interlock&lt;br /&gt;Not a problem except its not documented in the user manual anywhere!&lt;br /&gt;So if it doesnt run for you, check that&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Handling is a bit different, as Im used to the feel of the Norelco, but for this close a shave Ill adapt&lt;br /&gt;Ive seen other reviews complain about the location of the trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;I have no issues with it, its easy to use as well&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great investment for the money&lt;br /&gt;My old shavers are headed to the great recycle bin</li>
    <li> This is my third wet/dry shaver from Panasonic and the best one of the three.  I started using Panasonic shavers approx. 20 years ago and each has performed well. First was a two blade, then three and now with four.  Each one was better than the last, but this one is by far a closer shaving machine. I believe that the five blade one is a little pricey, but if I can get 4-5 years out of this one it will be more affordable.</li>
    <li> Prior to this razor, I owned a Braun Series 7 razor that cost at least double what this Panasonic cost me.  And I must say, the Braun was one of the worst I ever owned, and this is by far one of the best.  With the Braun, I had to go over areas multiple times, but not with this guy.  No razor burn.  Just a great product.</li>
    <li> I find the razor comfortable and easy to use. Provides a very close shave and does not heat up excessively as the old models did. I am looking forward to long term use and it appears through Amazon that replaceable parts are easily obtainable.</li>
    <li> Bought this for $94 back in December 2010, when it also had a $30 rebate, which made it a steal at $64.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using it for the past two years and haven&#x27;t had any problems with it. I don&#x27;t have the thickest of facial hair and only shave maybe once every 4-5 days, so I can&#x27;t say how it will work for those with extreme facial hair. I also only do dry shaves, and have found nearly no irritation after use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The trimmer on the side is really nice too, I use it for sideburns, which it effortlessly glides through.</li>
    <li> So far so good.  I&#x27;ve had the shaver for about three weeks now and haven&#x27;t had to recharge yet (averaging about 3-4 shaves per week).  Really close and effortless shave.  Haven&#x27;t had to clean it yet so can&#x27;t comment on that.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting a much better shave than my Braun was giving me.  I had settled for a mediocre shaving experience and didn&#x27;t think this would be much different but received it as a gift so I gave it a trial.  As it turns out, this is one of the best shavers I&#x27;ve used in a long time.  I know it takes time to get accustomed to most shavers but this one felt good and provided a great shave from day one, which was about 3 weeks ago.  I can only expect the shaves to get better as time passes.  I had been using a Braun Series 7 790cc which is around twice the price but no where near twice better.  As a matter of fact the Panasonic ES-LA63 gives me a better shaving experience than the Braun (the whole cleaning system hype is not worth the extra $).  The ES-LA63 is easy to use.  Easy to clean.  Extremely comfortable to hold and glides across my face like no other shaver.  One of the best things about this shaver is that it shaves my neck and jaw line without having to go back and forth a million times like I always have had to do.  A wonderful surprise of a shaver that I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I have tried it twice since its arrival. First one as dry shaving and second one as wet shaving. I prefer for dry shaving.&lt;br /&gt;May be  I need to be more used to it with this shaver.&lt;br /&gt;Everything went fine with my first shave (dry shaving) except some hair left behind on my neck and Its hard to make close and clean shave on my neck.&lt;br /&gt;I did wet shaving for my 2nd shave. I felt it is not as good as dry shave for me. Same thing again, it is not close and clean for my neck.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know may be I need to learn some technique to do it for my neck.. I will try to learn in my future shaves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only one thing is that when i did wet shave, i used some force on my mustache and i have some friction burn at the edge of my upper lips and some bleeding on my mustache skin... I hope this is due to my inexperience with this shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cleaning and maintenance is very good. Very easy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would prefer to buy with cleaning station but it cannot ship to oversea for the model with cleaning station.</li>
    <li> Pro&#x27;s - 1) Gives a good shave, 2) A wonderfully high speed and strong motor.  3) It handles long hairs better than I expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con&#x27;s - 1) Big and bulky head that takes getting use to (I&#x27;ve learned to &#x27;pull&#x27; the razor, instead of &#x27;push&#x27; it.), 2) battery doesn&#x27;t have as much shaving capacity as previous razors I&#x27;ve owned.  3) Small trimmer.. but works well&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve always used &#x27;low end&#x27;, single-shaving-screen, razors and typically enjoyed them until they totally wore out (not that I EVER enjoyed shaving!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; After my old &#x27;all-time FAVORITE&#x27;  Panasonic ES-SA40 (no longer produced!) was dropped on it&#x27;s screen onto a tile floor (No replacement parts) I started looking for a replacement, as the battery was dying after almost 6 years of continuous use, any way,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A purchased a Braun Series 1 190S.  What a pathetic waste of money (I&#x27;d used Braun successfully in the past).  The motor was SO WEAK, it would literally bog to a stop on my chin and mustache whiskers!  The screen was much more irritating to the skin than the Panasonic also.  After less than 10 shaves I gave it away.  It&#x27;s probably in the land-fill now.  This new ES-LAY63-S Arc 4 doesn&#x27;t even know there IS a &#x27;load&#x27; on my chin/mustache whiskers!  I love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Sorry for the rant*  I purchased this Razor for much cheaper than normally advertised, as it was on sale and also there was another discount that applied.  I still paid 3x more than any other razor in my life (I&#x27;m 69)... but it&#x27;s a keeper.  Maybe it&#x27;ll last until I won&#x27;t need one any more!  :)</li>
    <li> This is probably my fifth or sixth Panasonic and by far the best. Yes, this is also my most expensive but well worth the price for the job that it does.</li>
    <li> I have owned three Panasonic wet/dry shavers in my life. The first one was magnificent.&lt;br /&gt;The second one was poor, it had a charger stand, and the metal contacts rotted away in no time.&lt;br /&gt;This one appears to be terrific so far. We shall see.&lt;br /&gt;I do not understand quite how they cannot emulate the Sonic toothbrush idea where the charging system requires no metal contacts, but is purely inductive through plastic covers..&lt;br /&gt;But I suppose the problems are different mechanically. I like the shaver for now.</li>
    <li> prefer a Gillette razor and shaving cream; also takes too long to get an acceptable shave; even then it&#x27;s not as close and doesn&#x27;t feel as good afterwards as using a razer.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t use it while charging!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Very good but not in the shower,unless you are alone</li>
    <li> I purchased it for the guy in my life and he didn&#x27;t like it.  He tried it for a couple of weeks just to see if he could get adjusted to using it.  Nope!  It took too long to shave, it misses spots so he has to go back and shave it again and again.  Because it took too long to shave properly, my guy decided to return it and go back to the good ol&#x27; razor.  BTW, my guy isn&#x27;t hairy.  He shaves about 2-3 times a week.  He wanted to like this shaver so badly but just couldn&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> This is my fourth Panasonic linear razor.  This one is a bit larger than my last 3 blade model.  It works a little better and the new battery seems to last twice as long.  The indicator shows how long it as running and you have to wait for it to see battery % left which should always be displayed graphically IMO.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The larger size makes this harder to pack and seems less maneuverable.  It was a great deal, but I might actually lean towards going back to a 3 blade model the next time around.  Which will be many years away..</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t shave too close.  My husband doesn&#x27;t like it.  Not worth the money</li>
    <li> Of the many electric shavers I have owned, this gives the closest shave of them all. Quiet operation. Another quality product fron Panasonic.</li>
    <li> this shaver is really good. Probably not enough positive praise on the net for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve now had it for maybe 2 months, and it shaves just as good as the day i got it. My neck hairs stick to my skin a lot and lay very flat, but this shaver tends to pick up most of them in a few passes. Still have to pinch my skin to flip up some of the really annoying ones, and only a razer seems to get these!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the LCD display for me is a gimmick, and don&#x27;t really care how long i took to shave. The cleaning function works well and is really quick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the flip up hair trimmer is good but a little bit unergonomical compared to my previous razer.</li>
    <li> Was looking for an electric shaver for my head because I kept getting nicked with razor...this has done the trick. Recommend it</li>
    <li> As a former razor shaver I felt the need to change.  This shaver seems to do the job adequately and is time efficient - which is what I wanted.</li>
    <li> I love panasonic razors.. but the problem with this version is the blades I bought are not sharp, unlike the past ones that had a great close shave.  This is my 3rd one in 4 years</li>
    <li> Back in the day, Victor Kiam, who owned Remington, used to advertise his microscreen shavers on TV with the slogan \\&quot;Shaves as close as a blade, or your money back!\\&quot;.  Back when I bought one, some twenty years ago, well, lets just say if people really held him to his guarantee, his company would have gone bankrupt very quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Advance forward to the present - since then I&#x27;ve owned a Braun, one of the earlier Panasonic wet/dry&#x27;s (ES762), one of the earlier Braun self-cleaning models (5709), the Panasonic ES-8043 with the 13,000 RPM motor, and now with this model I&#x27;m on my third Panasonic.  The ES-8043 completely blew all of the previous models I&#x27;ve owned straight out of the water.  The motor was the biggest difference - very fast, and it would just keep going, not slowing down until the battery was actually fully discharged - unlike earlier models where it would slow appreciably after the first few minutes of shaving.  The other big difference was the shaving head tilting side to side.  Previous models I&#x27;d owned had fixed heads, or heads that pivotied forward or backwards.  I found the side-to-side pivot on the ES8043 to be much more helpful.  The one downside to the ES-8043 was the narrow pop-out trimmer, much narrower than on earlier models - well fitted for sideburns, but more time consuming for removing longer hairs on the neck.  Still, this shaver did such a good job I found myself rarely needing the trimmer with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now enter the ES-LA63-S.  Panasonic has done themselves one better.  The motor is even slightly faster than the ES8043.  The head now pivots both side to side and forwards and backwards (superb!).  The trimmer is still narrow, and now its a little bit harder to engage (the head needs to be straight so that it can be locked, and the trimmer then can pop-up), but I need it even less than before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing about this model is that the shaving head is HUGE.  I thought this would hinder me, but it hasn&#x27;t been a problem atall.  Its not difficult to manuever in the tight areas, such as in the area between the upper lip and the nose.  I think the shaving head pivoting in every direction really compensates for the larger size when it comes to the tight areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once again the motor just goes and goes, and does not slow down until the battery is dead - indicated with plenty of warning by the bright blue illuminated display.  I have not had a problem with the battery life - the only thing I can say is that I think the charge indicator on the display is calibrated incorrectly, or intentionally made to error on the side of getting you to recharge the shaver sooner.  I intentionally ran it down until the batter died.  The display shows the charge status in 10% increments.  I noticed that in the 20-100% range, the indicated charge goes down by 10% every 4-5 minutes.  But I was able to run the shaver for 15-20 minutes more once 10% was indicated.  The motor did now slow at all until the very end, when it slowed down over the last 3 or 4 seconds before shutting off completely.  I wonder if other reviewers who have complained about battery life have let it run down all the way, or are just basing their beliefs that the battery doesn&#x27;t last as long as claimed without letting it run down all the way, instead deciding its time to recharge when the indicator says 10%?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cleaning it is very easy.  Rub a little soap on the foils, and turn the shaver on in cleaning mode (hold down the power button until the motor shifts to the ultra-fast speed) while running it under warm water from the shower or faucet.  Remove the foils, and run it in cleaning mode again for 20 seconds under the shower or faucet to clean the inner blades.  As of now I&#x27;ve had the shaver 3 weeks, and doing this after every use I&#x27;ve got it spotlessly clean - absolutely no shaving residue on the foils or around the inner blades at all.  This same shaver is available for more money with a cleaning station.  At first I wondered if it was worth the extra money to buy that model, but there is also the ongoing added expense of buying the cleaning solution from Panasonic, and this shaver is pretty easy to clean manually with a pretty minimal effort.  So I would say get whichever version floats your boat, but know you won&#x27;t go wrong with this model&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the actual shave, I&#x27;ve used it both wet with shaving gel, and dry, and it is astoundingly good for an electric.  Every part of my face is shaved closer than before with the ES-8043.  I really can get that \\&quot;as close as a blade\\&quot; shave over most of my face - I&#x27;m not kidding, I cannot tell the difference between what this does to much of my face versus what I get with a Gillette Mach 3 blade - well, except for the difference that my face is not irritated with the Panasonic and with the Gillette it often is.  The traditional trouble spots for me (corners of the jaw, neck) are not quite as good, but they&#x27;re much better than I got even with the ES8043.  Overall, I am very very pleased.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Right now, this \\&quot;4 bladed\\&quot; series of Panasonics are not the latest model.  There&#x27;s an newer, more expensive series with 5 bladed shaving heads.  I haven&#x27;t tried them, and I can&#x27;t imagine they&#x27;re any worse.  But if they&#x27;re really any better than this model, I&#x27;d say Panasonic has pulled off a miracle, because I can&#x27;t really imagine an electric working any better than this.</li>
    <li> If you are like me, in the morning I am stumbling around in search of my coffee and trying to do the things I need to before I am off to work. Shaving is a pain in the you-know-what. So this was my motivation for buying the Arc4. I received this electric shaver and plugged it in, in an hour it was charged. (I am used to waiting 12 hours.) I have thin skin and a medium beard. This shaver did a great job out of the gate. I was surprised that I felt no pulling or cutting. Just the whir of the blades. Although I have just gotten this, I am really happy with it. My shave left few if any whiskers remaining, and my time to shave was nothing compared to using a razor and shaving cream. Admittedly, using the razor gives a little closer shave, but this is plenty close for me ! Great buy.&lt;br /&gt;1/16 Update: I have owned this for a year now and I am even more happier with it ! I started using Williams Lectric shave lotion and this electric razor shaves as close as a blade ! I am super happy with this product.</li>
    <li> 2nd one in 5 years.  Works great as a dry then wet shaver.</li>
    <li> Makes the morning shaving routine much more simple and effective.</li>
    <li> Wonder why it can&#x27;t charge and shave at the same time?</li>
    <li> reliable, good shaver</li>
    <li> We weren&#x27;t sure how he&#x27;d take to this. He was a long time disposable razor user and likes a close shave.  We read several reviews and thought we&#x27;d give this a try.  It performs as promised.  Definitely a keeper.</li>
    <li> I have used Panasonic razors for many years.The quality of this product is outstanding. My previous Panasonic razor is 10+ years old and still works, so I debated replacing it.  I am so glad that I did. This product is better than I expected.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> having read one reviewers comments about NO MANUAL being vailable from Panasonic, I figured I would see for myself......&lt;br /&gt;DO NOT BOTHER, IT JUST DOES NOT EXIST!!!!! AM i GONNA PAY OVER$100.00  WITH NO SUPPORT???&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;Not Bloody Likely\\&quot;!!!!</li>
    <li> I have had 5 or 6 electric razors over my lifetime. This is by far the best one I have ever seen. I read the reviews before I bought this razor and found one of them a little humorous. The person said that something about the shaver (I do not remember what) did not work exactly right but they were not going to send it back because it gave the best shave they had ever had from an electric razor. Now I know what they mean. I have not had any problems with it and it does give a great shave, almost as good as a blade and a lot easier. The only thing I don&#x27;t like about it is that the battery needs to be recharged frequently, but it says that in the product info. For me that is about every 5 shaves, but I shave very carefully and it takes a while.</li>
    <li> Second Panasonic shaver, the first one passed down to my son. This is one great razor with very long battery life.</li>
    <li> I bought this razor for my husband for his birthday. He has alopecia (little bald spots) on his head and finally got fed up with trying to cover them with hair cuts, so he shaved his head. He has dark hair so he needs a really clean shave so the spots don&#x27;t show up. He has been very pleased with this razor and the skin feels super smooth after use.</li>
    <li> This shaver shaves closer than any I&#x27;ve used in the last thirty years. It takes some time (8 -10 min) but you can get just as close a shave as with a blade. Battery is only good for three shaves between charges.</li>
    <li> Received package as promised.  Thanks.</li>
    <li> Crap product. Doesn&#x27;t odd much at all. Just wasted $200+</li>
    <li> It is a great razor. Very easy to use and clean and gives a smooth shave.</li>
    <li> Simply AMAZING!&lt;br /&gt;I have been using an old Panasonic shaver for about 5 years now.  I upgraded to the ES-LA63 Arc4 and used today for the first time.  I have never gotten such a close shave before.  I always used a pre-electric shave lotion and I didn&#x27;t this time and did not even need it.  Ver, Very close comfortable shave.  You can&#x27;t go wrong.  I bought it on cyber Monday here on AMAZON and it was a great deal!</li>
    <li> This is my second one.  When on special they are not much more expensive than replacement shield and blade.  I use it in the shower with Taylor of Old Bond Street shaving cream.  Both are a real treat. I started cleaning this off with a washcloth after each use and it still looks new.</li>
    <li> Good shaver for the price (&amp;#60;$100)</li>
    <li> Using now about a month.  Minimal adjustment of my skin time.  I switched from rotary razor, that fairly consistently yanked my skin when I used it (probably old and not very sharp).  But compared to the rotary razor I had, this one far superior.  Close shave, no razor burn.  What more do you need.</li>
    <li> Great shaver! It does  a much better job than some of the lower powered Panasonic shavers that I have used.</li>
    <li> This shaver is everything and more.  My husband loves it. It gives an amazing close shave and cleans nicely.  Plus it does hold a charge for several days.  He can go over a week without charging it.  So glad I found this. Worth the money...</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had Panasonics and Braun electric razors forever. The Braun is very good as is this model of Panasonic. Too bad that the travel case is not large enough to hold the charging cord and adapter but, all in all, a very good razor. The 3 cutting surfaces do indeed make the shave fast than the Braun 2 heads which is the good point. The larger head however is somewhat awkward when shaving under the nose.</li>
    <li> There is nothing bad to say about this shaver does better then any shaver I have had before. Out of the 6 shavers(3 different brands) before this one I would have to say this is the best all around out there. I have yet to find a shaver that does my neck with any consistency they always miss spots but this shaver only misses two tiny spots which is way better than any I have used before. The one star missing is for the fact I had a 3 blade Panasonic that worked just as good as this one so I wouldn&#x27;t have upgraded if for the fact the queensland healer didn&#x27;t need a chew toy(I wished it was plugged in when he went for it)</li>
    <li> Read the online comparisons and reviews and decided the Arc 4 was the best bang for the buck.  Got a screaming good deal from Amazon so I replaced my old Norelco with this gem.  So far, the shave is better and more comfortable than anything I have used.</li>
    <li> In all the years I&#x27;ve owned electric razors - none has  ever been this good and without causing  skin irritation.  Great product.  Forget Braun and Norelco - get this one.</li>
    <li> I have used Panasonic razors for years, always had good service from them. This model is the best yet very quite, smooth and easy to clean.</li>
    <li> I actually liked this shaver and it gave the closest shave I&#x27;ve gotten from an electric shaver.  Unfortunately, it had two design flaws.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first flaw, and most important, was the spring mechanism is part of the shaver itself, unlike my previous Braun shaver where the spring is part of the replaceable blade.  Also, there is only a small plastic piece that holds that spring mechanism in place in the Panasonic.  During cleaning, I will remove the blade and the last time I did it, the plastic piece had broken off and the spring flew off.  I found the spring but there was no way it would stay in place without the plastic piece which made this shaver useless - without the spring, there&#x27;s nothing to push the blade up against the screen.  I took off two stars for this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other flaw is, you cannot use this shaver while it&#x27;s charging and the battery life isn&#x27;t that long.  The shaver is light in weight so I don&#x27;t know why they wouldn&#x27;t put a larger battery in it, especially since you can&#x27;t use it while charging.  But I still don&#x27;t understand why you can&#x27;t use it while it&#x27;s charging.  I took off a star for this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not affiliated with Braun, but since that&#x27;s what I was using before, I&#x27;m back to it.  At least it works.  I never had a spring fly off of it, and even if it did, I would only be out the blade part (which should be regularly replaced anyway) and not the whole shaver.</li>
    <li> Very fast and effective shaving. Easy cleaning. Just to pass under water. It is caught well in hand during shaving.</li>
    <li> Great shaver. I switched to this from actual razors and the results are awesome. Nice smooth, clean shave. I had a problem with real razors tearing up my face and this electric shaver took care of that problem. It leaves my face smooth and healthy looking. I get several shaves on one charge. Cleaning is relatively easy. The shaver is capable of charging using 110 or 220 which is a nice feature if you travel a lot.</li>
    <li> The shaver worked very good on my cheeks , gave a very close shave even better than the conventional blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But left a lot of hairs on my neck area , when i tried again and again , gave me bad bruises.&lt;br /&gt;I tried the wet shave no better either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But i think it will be good for people with thin hairs . I have very thick hair.&lt;br /&gt;Returned the shaver after trying for 1 month .</li>
    <li> The head is a bit bigger (going for more blades) but it was a bit oversized for me. I like my other models that I had previously better (3 blade models). I love the ability to wash the unit and keep it clean and it works very well.</li>
    <li> I tried others but this are the best, I&#x27;m so happy to get this razor because I feel my face more clean  and softh</li>
    <li> I should have known that any electric razor can cause folliculitis, and that standard razors do better with this problem. Therefore, its uses are limited to my own legs and underarms, and trimming a friend&#x27;s beard. In those places it is great.</li>
    <li> This shaver performs very well and is replacing an older Braun unit that I have used for years.  I am getting a good shave, alightly better than my older Braun unit.  It charges quickly and is much easier to maintain/clean.  Soap and water does it.</li>
    <li> This is a great razor.  Close shave and quick.  After looking at several different places, Amazon was the lowest price.</li>
    <li> very good ,low price but high performance, its made in japan,&lt;br /&gt;i use this band for 8 years ,my good choice</li>
    <li> I am happy with it but it is not that much better than my previous model a es8243. I do like the wet/dry option that both models have</li>
    <li> The Arc series of wet and dry shavers from Panasonic are the performing that I have ever used.  I strongly recommend them.  The foils and cutters usually last 4-6 months.  I use a liquid hand soap in the ultra vibrate mode to clean the heads.  Works great.</li>
    <li> I got this for myself for Christmas after looking at the overall reviews for many different shavers. My last shaver was a German brand that was also highly rated but turned out to be a bit of a disappointment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I charged this up as directed when I opened it the day after Christmas. So far, almost 3 weeks later and after daily shaving I am still working on that initial charge. I am at 40% remaining power and the motor seems to run as it did when fully charged. I cleaned it a couple of times under water as directed and found it comes out like new. I tried to shave in the shower a couple of times but did not care for it much. The shave was close enough but after shaving for more than a half century dry it is too different.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the way this holds in your hand. It seems quite natural and the pop up trimmer works just fine for my needs. As long as the quality holds out I think I will be enjoying this razor for many more years.</li>
    <li> I bought this razor in June 2011, and used it pretty much every other day since then.  My prior razor was a Braun Pulsonic, which I liked very much, but the trimmer broke just after the warranty was up.  After that, I decided to see what else was out there, and I decided on the ES-LA63.  The first thing you notice about this razor is the really big shaving head.  I thought that would be good, since it would mean a faster shave.  But, it didn&#x27;t turn out that way.  The head is just too big to be maneuverable on my face.  The shaving head tilts and moves in all directions, but I just couldn&#x27;t get it in some parts of my face.  The blades didn&#x27;t seem to be as sharp or cut as well as the Braun, even when the Panasonic was new.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really wanted to like this razor.  The trimmer is good, and the controls are useful and friendly.  It can be used in a wet (with shaving oil or shaving cream) or dry mode, which is good for convenience.  It washes easily with liquid soap and water - you don&#x27;t have to have a cleaning module, although there is a model of this razor that has that if you want it.  Personally, I would rather save the money and just wash my razors with soap/water.  The motor on it is pretty quiet, and the shaver build quality is outstanding.  But, the razor just didn&#x27;t shave as well as my old Braun, and that&#x27;s the bottom line.  You might find it just fine, but I like a really close shave, since I only shave every other day.  After a few months, I&#x27;ll review the Braun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I purchased a new Braun for Christmas, and I think I will be much more satisfied with it, even though there is nothing really wrong with the Panasonic other than it&#x27;s not as good for me as a Braun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Your mileage may vary, and probably will.</li>
    <li> Starting to get a close shave after 50+ years with the latest blade razor.  Takes me about 2.5 minutes for a full facial shave using soap and water as a preconditioner.  The shaver felt clumsy at first but now feels great.  Great price, great razor.</li>
    <li> Great razor. Shaves close  and very easy to clean with running water. Recharges super fast. The display is easy to read and gives you usable information. The pop-up trimmer works great. I can&#x27;t  report on durability yet but I have used it almost daily now for about 3 months with no problems. I think it gives you about a 90-95% closeness as compared to a blade but saves a lot of time and it&#x27;s easier on your skin so you might shave a little more often due to the convenience. This is the first electric I&#x27;ve owned in about 20 years and I can say they are vastly improved so if you are one that hasn&#x27;t tried one in a while you will probably very pleased with it&#x27;s performance and features. I forgot to mention that I have only used it dry so far but it can be used wet as well.</li>
    <li> I have been unable to shave with a regular razor for well over a year now do to changes in my skin and that come along with a graying beard. I decided to take the plunge and try this highly rated electric shaver and I am amazed at the ease in which I can shave with minimal irritation. Mind you I have only had the shaver for 24 hours but I have shaved twice with it and so far so good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only gripe is the &#x27;neck beard&#x27; as some others have commented on. It misses some of those hairs with consistency. I am going to stick with it as reviews and industry says for about 30 days and see if that one and only issue resolved itself. I will be doing a follow up review as time passes.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had a lot of electric razors including several from Panasonic. This one is by far the best. It cuts close and is comfortable. I have to go over my face far fewer times with this razor.</li>
    <li> I have over the years used all of the major brands of shavers and have been let down. Braun (2), Remington, Norelco, etc. All given me the same results, mediocre performance. I accepted that I would be forced to use foam and a razor. By the way, I also tried all of the fancy razors too. two blade, three blade even four blade, I tried them all. Well, after reading the positive reviews of the Panasonic Arc 4, I convinced myself to give it one last try. I have to say, it was an excellent decision. This version from Panasonic does everything I expect from a shaver and more. I have a very troublesome spot under my jaw that even the razors could solve. I was always left with 80 grit sandpaper under my chin. Well no more.&lt;br /&gt;  I really am impressed with the Panasonic. Three minute dry shaves give me the results comparable to a razor. Quick and smooth. In addition, you get the bonus of being able to use this shaver wet! Yes, I didn&#x27;t believe it but I decided to give it a try. Wow, even more impressive. Very quick and I do believe it is even closer than a razor. I love the ease of being able to clean it just using water and a little soap. Easy to clean and maintain.&lt;br /&gt;  I travel several times a year and the Panasonic Arc4 will really solve the necessity to carry the disposable razors. I am looking forward to going on another cruise and taking this shaver along. Being able to use it dry or wet is a big bonus. Also, the ease of cleaning will add greatly to a carefree vacation. The Braun cleaning station with purchasing cleaning cartridges, ( gets real old, really quick), was a constant inconvenience. Plus, what do you do on vacation? Everything about this shaver is a positive.&lt;br /&gt;  So, go out and buy the others, spend more money, but if you want performance, the satisfaction of getting a close, excellent shave, and being able to use it wet (shower, sink) or dry, plus the convenience of very easy cleaning, then you deserve to get this shaver. It definitely works for me and I am very satisfied.&lt;br /&gt;  By the way, I ordered it on a Thursday afternoon, paid an extra $3.99 (pocket change) and had it in my hands the next day! Wow, talk about customer service! Amazon is the best, and whenever I need something, Amazon is my first destination to shop. By the way, Amazon also has the best price! I saw the same model listed as high as $200.00 on another site. Thanks Amazon, you box with a smile on it always puts a smile on my face!</li>
    <li> great product. Would reccomend for guys that are folicly impared. Great product for to use instead of using a blade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;D</li>
    <li> After reading the highly rated reviews, I had high expectations.  This shaver does not shave close over the lip or along the chin, even after a long shaving process.  It gets hot if you use it for very long.  It expects to be cleaned every 2 times.  The cleaning process really uses up the battery.</li>
    <li> As a Panasonic fan it is what I expected.&lt;br /&gt;This shaver replaced a Panasonic shaver that just got old.&lt;br /&gt;It is the best I&#x27;ve ever used and that doesn&#x27;t surprise me.&lt;br /&gt;Good shavers are not cheap but I was pleased with the price&lt;br /&gt;on this one. If you&#x27;re looking for a good shave this will do the trick.</li>
    <li> With good reviews I thought that I&#x27;d try this shave last December.  My wife keps conplaining that it looks as though I haven&#x27;t shaved and she is right.  I cannot get a decent shave with this model.  Foget teh neck, it is worse than terrible.</li>
    <li> this is a quite expensive shaver, but feels cheap, fragile, planned for obsolescence. doesn&#x27;t catch the hairs growing in weird directions, doesn&#x27;t shave well on a few days of growth, doesn&#x27;t work while plugged in. the trimmer is next to useless. overall its so so pricey for a mediocre flimsy product. sorry not impressed, do not recommend.</li>
    <li> I opted not to get the most expensive model with so-called automatic cleaning. I clean it every third day of shaving with just a little hand soap and rinse under the tap water. The charge lasts a week. the head comes apart in one click for easy rinsing. I can sit down and shave by feel. I did not expect that the shave to be as clean as a Gillette four blade razor.  It could if I wanted to take longer and used it in wet shave mode. I wanted something fast easy to  clean without the shaving cream and all that mess. This satisfies my need for a good fast dry shave.</li>
    <li> Used a rotary triple head for years after scraping through a shave cream razor era trying to get a close shave. Not much luck for complete close removal occurs now with gray becoming dominant. Another rating mentioned KISS MY FACE and this unit for a wet shave and for the past two weeks have been skin side up. Wet shave at the sink is what I find the best and because of logistics not in a shower. Unit is easy to clean after a wet shave making it sterile and battery charge to how close you want. Maker register site misleads a stand and travel grip not for this unit, otherwise a 5 star buy, especially with a stand.</li>
    <li> Now shaving occurs every other day instead of daily.  This provides the closest shave EVER, even compared with double edged old fashioned razor blades!  Forget anything cheaper, forget any other product.  This is rechargeable (and takes very little time to recharge), has a cord long enough to reach the outlet a ways from the sink counter, has indicator lights showing when it&#x27;s done (don&#x27;t have to try to squint to read gray digital readouts), is easily cleanable, and the blades lasted a full year shaving nearly every day.  Because my husband&#x27;s beard is blonde and slow-growing, he only has to shave e/o day now.  Thanks for a premium quality product.  We won&#x27;t be changing to anything else now that we&#x27;ve discovered this!</li>
    <li> Had an earlier model of this razor which, after many years, began to sound tired so I stuck with the same basic thing.  Much quieter, smoother and faster shave.</li>
    <li> This is my 3rd ES-LA63-S. One of 3 failed after only 1 year of use, but I bought a 2nd since this shaver really works as advertised. It gives a very close, irritation-free wet shave. The 2nd shaver still functions after 2 years, so I plan to replace the outer foil and blades and use it as a spare. This unit was purchased for immediate use. Though pricey, this shaver is highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Best electric shaver I have used.</li>
    <li> Shaves clean and withough snagging.  Pop-up trimmer works good.</li>
    <li> Worked very well the first year, then started to have problems and totally died 6 months before the manufacturer&#x27;s stated warranty period.</li>
    <li> Well made shaves close.  The side burns cutter could be a little more robust but does the job.  Of course the price of $99.99 was just right.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> I like it, I really do.  I&#x27;ve spent thirty years with a razor because old electrics left me itching.  This doesn&#x27;t.  It shaves close, comfortably, holds a charge well and is easy to clear.  A winner.</li>
    <li> THE SHAVER IS ALL THAT IT SAYS AND I AM VERY PLEASED TO DATE.  I WOULD PURCHASE A PANASONIC SHAVER AGAIN WHEN THE NEED ARISES.</li>
    <li> this thing is awesome... usually i have a 5 o clock shadow at 1... now at 6pm.. i love it</li>
    <li> Much better shave than Norelco. However the rechargable battery died and I could not get it replaced locally. Called customer service  at Panasonic which is a joke. I was told I cant replace the battery as it has to be done by a tech. I would have to ship it to them ,I asked the cost and they couldnt tell me until they got the shaver.What nonsense.&lt;br /&gt;In the meantime I have to use my older Norelco which sucks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To sum up Panasonic has a great product but their customer service is a disaster.</li>
    <li> Purchased here on Amazon December 2010&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found this Panasonic esla63 electric razor on Amazon  right after Xmas with a $93.00 sale price and a $30.00  mail in rebate. So why not pop for a new less than $65.00 razor that was garnering pretty good reviews? I have 2 braun electrics, both 7 series and wasn&#x27;t satisfied with either. I even ordered new blades and replaced them myself and they worked for a good 2 years. The problem with the Brauns were/are that I always had to go back over my neck area with a traditional blade razor to get at the pesky remaining hair that was left and to get that real close shave! My beard is medium thick with some rough spots under the chin and reverse hairs or whatever its called, like the ridgeback.&lt;br /&gt; It was becoming a nuisance so I began searching for good razor reviews and this one stood out.&lt;br /&gt;After using this Panasonic for two years without shave cream I would say I am surprised  at how close it shaves and efficiently so,  I am 100% satisfied.. Just a few passes over my face and its done, COMPLETELY! I can skip a shave on weekends but this razor whacks 2 day  beard growth like a hot knife through butter. Its so damn amazing I only need a charge every two weeks!&lt;br /&gt;Seriously, the battery lasts that long. The charge lasts for over 10 shaves and I take on vacations without the charger, its worry free.&lt;br /&gt;NO MORE BLADE RAZORS! I wish I had this a long time ago!&lt;br /&gt;This thing has a huge head but I became accustomed to its size rather quickly. It charges fast and cleans easily. I am glad I didnt pay extra for the solution bath. The sink water and soap method is effective enough. If I would have paid more I would still be extremely happy with this purchase, Its worth $150.00 if you cannot find it on sale for less its worth every penny anyway ITS INCREDIBLE!&lt;br /&gt;use it wet or dry...

    <li> Have used thesE for many years because they are the oldest sweetener available and have no harmful chemicals to cause concern...&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended! Thank you for the opportunity to review!..oh. and the Amazon service is a now standard of excellence !!! Well Done Amazon!!!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok, the product itself is built quite well, but if you&#x27;re expecting a clean shave, this just doesn&#x27;t really do it compared to a blade.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this razor.  3 disclaimers.&lt;br /&gt;1.) Some people like rotary razors. If that&#x27;s you, ignore this review. I tried the top of the line Norelco and hated it.  This is a foil razor -- I&#x27;ve had lots of Brauns and Panasonics.  This is the best foil razor I have ever had.&lt;br /&gt;2.)  There are thousands of reviews of electric razors and you will find passionate defenses of and eloquent attacks on each.  Obviously faces differ.  Bottom line: find someone who had the kind of razor you used to have (and liked).  Their reviews will probably be most accurate for you.  Mine have been high end Braun and Panasonic.  My old Braun was falling apart -- even with new blades.  This is the replacement.&lt;br /&gt;3.)  Some people like the &amp;#34;auto clean&amp;#34; features -- they raise the price about $90, give you a big stand into which the razor fits, plus you have to buy expensive cartridges or washing fluid.  Most of them don&#x27;t disinfect.  (I think the Braun may)  Some of them smell disgusting -- the Norelco fluid smells like the cheapest nasty body spray you&#x27;ve ever smelled.  The manufacturers obviously have an interest in getting you to buy a renewable -- think printer toner -- rather than just a device.  They claim it has benefits on efficacy.  Interestingly, I&#x27;ve seen no empirical study beyond the ad copy that the auto clean features actually increase the life, efficacy or cleanliness of the razor over just rinsing the blades with warm water and liquid hand soap (not detergent) every week or so.  If you disagree, and want the auto wash feature -- I admit it sounds cool -- this isn&#x27;t the razor for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why do I love it?  It shaves closer with no tugging or pulling.  It has &amp;#34;nano tech blades&amp;#34; which sounds like marketing BS but it is actually similar to the really fancy blades on the Gillette wet razors.  They really are sharper.  I typically to a light shave with an electric and then shave with a Gillette 4 wet razor.  This was so good that -- even used dry -- it wasnearly as close as the wet razor.  Trimmer is small but very good. Bottom line: superb product.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used a Braun 360° for the past 5 years. It was never very good so I always followed it up with a standard Gillette razor. Recently the foil on my Braun got a hole in it so I figured I&#x27;d get a new electric and picked this one. After three days of not shaving my Panasonic ES showed up. I was a little concerned since my beard was a bit long but I figured since it&#x27;s a wet/dry shaver I&#x27;d give it a shot. I fully charged my razor (it took a bit less than 1 hour), lathered up with just liquid-soap and water, and ran it over my face. Wow! It took a little bit of time and pressure but 5 minutes later my face was as smooth as if I&#x27;d used a razor blade. Without a doubt this is the best electric razor I&#x27;ve ever used.    I considered the Arc5 but it&#x27;s too pricey and I don&#x27;t think the price warrants the extra money for me. Don&#x27;t bother with the cleaning stations; They take up too much counter space and you can just use a little soap and water every so often to clean it.    I&#x27;ve only had it a week so it&#x27;s possible I will run into issues but so far I&#x27;m extremely pleased with my purchase.    Update:   After a few weeks of using the razor I&#x27;ve noticed that after using it dry, it leaves my face smooth, but I can still see the stubble just under my skin. And once I step into the shower the heat causes my hairs to raise up and I can feel the stubble so I&#x27;ve been going over it with a razor blade afterwards.     When I tried to use the razor in the shower it didn&#x27;t do as good of a job as my first shave at the sink with a longer beard. Specifically, it didn&#x27;t do a good job of picking up my hairs that were stuck against my neck. For now I&#x27;ve gone back to my previous use of a dry-electric shave before showering and using a blade in the shower.    I still love this razor. It&#x27;s the best electric razor I&#x27;ve ever used. It shaves my face pretty well in less than 3 minutes. I would buy it again in a heartbeat.</li>
    <li> a little loud, but my husband loves this shaver. He had a Braun before and really liked this step up.</li>
    <li> Leaves some whiskers when shaving every other day. Blades do not appear real sharp but does an okay job.</li>
    <li> very good &amp; powerful!</li>
    <li> Whole life, I have used razor for shaving. Being a first time user of electric shaver, very pleased with the performance of Panasonic ES-LA63-S. It works as expected. I highly recommend to any one.</li>
    <li> This shaver is excellent.  It is the third electric shaver purchased, and by far cuts the closest and gets all those stubborn hairs.  It is as close to a manual blade as I can find.</li>
    <li> I previously had tried many different electric shavers and had never been quite pleased with the results.  I was displeased with multiple units I&#x27;d tried from Braun and Noreleco and kept going back to a Mach III.  Too much irritation or hair pulling. The only unit I&#x27;d been some what pleased with was a Panasonic linear unit that wasn&#x27;t wet dry. I decided to roll the dice on this unit after reading rave reviews everywhere.    I got this nearly two years ago and I have to say it continues to be fantastic. I use it to shave both my beard and my head. It shaves well enough dry that I don&#x27;t feel I need to use water or shaving cream. In fact I prefer a dry shave as there is much less irritation. With shaving cream it is almost as close as the trusty Mach III with none of the potential for nicks and cuts and much less irritation. The battery life is pretty good, and it can make it through a week of quick shaves, and it charges very quick. It&#x27;s fairly easy to clean as well. I haven&#x27;t had any issues with blade or foil longevity. Added bonus, it&#x27;s one of the Panasonic models that&#x27;s still made in japan.    True it costs a pretty penny and it&#x27;s not on sale very often. The side burn trimmer is not the greatest, but acceptable. My only other gripe is that if you don&#x27;t shave for a couple of days it won&#x27;t do as good as a job and it pulls hairs, but honestly that&#x27;s to be expected. I use it in combination with a philips trimmer when I get lazy to rectify that particular problem.    If you&#x27;re on the fence, just get it, especially on the somewhat rare occasion it&#x27;s on sale for under $100.</li>
    <li> Nice razor for an electric but don&#x27;t expect a clean shave. You wont get one.</li>
    <li> The best razor I&#x27;ve ever owned</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m impressed. After about two weeks my hair adapted to the shaver and now my shaves are almost as good as with a manual razor.</li>
    <li> Husband loves this. Uses daily for past year.</li>
    <li> Gave this as a present to my son, and he loves it. Best of all - he&#x27;s been clean shaven since Christmas ;-))&lt;br /&gt;Probably the perfect shaver, even better than my classic Braun...</li>
    <li> Great product, except that the battery does not hold a charge after 22 months of use.  The reliability of the battery should be improved.  Disappointed!</li>
    <li> it is everything i hoped for.\\&quot;i never expected it to work so good\\&quot;.I LOVE THIS RAZOR  easy to clean,full charge in 1 hour,last about a week.NO RAZOR BURN.</li>
    <li> This was given as a gift.  Young man had been using a razor which was not giving the needed results.  He says he absolutely loves it.  One month in, it does not tug and gives a smooth shave. No problem with battery life.  He can&#x27;t believed he used a razor for so long.</li>
    <li> The shaver looks good and fits nicely in the hand. The weight is comfortable. The shave is mediocre. It requires many passes over the same area to remove most of the hair. The shape of the shaver head does not permit hair removal in the nostril area. The noise level is higher than preferred but not objectionable. The battery requires recharging after two or three shaves. No charging stand is provided with the shaver. A case is provided for storing the shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Panasonic is just an average run of the mill type of shaver with no outstanding characteristics but neither is it terrible. It seems to be a bit overpriced for its level of quality.</li>
    <li> I like the shaver.  I can tell it has a lot of power which makes the shaver  more efficient.  Like every electric shaver, it struggles on the under the chin hairs on the neck.  You would think that for the price, my whiskers would magically disappear.  All in all, I am happy with the purchase.</li>
    <li> Excellent shaver. I think it worthwhile to mention that if you lose or break the charger, replacement will be, in my experience, nearly impossible.  I don&#x27;t think that problem is an accident.</li>
    <li> Gives a nice shave at a reasonable price. Tells you when to wash the shaving head and when to recharge. The battery recharges very fast. Good value all around</li>
    <li> It is a gift for this Christmas 2014- I don&#x27;t know because I have not given it yet.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had Braun shavers and this actually replaced my older Panasonic that was stolen on a business trip. It is even better than my older Panasonic Arc shaver and way better than my Brauns. If I shave with my Braun, I could run back over my face with my Panasonic and it would shave more off. If I reversed the order, the Braun would not pick anything up. Very quick shaver too as I don&#x27;t need a bunch of repeated passes.</li>
    <li> Died after 2 years. Replacement screen too expensive. The screen starts to wear after 6 months. Replaced and kept the old one. I manage to extend the life ofthe screeen by switching sections frm the old screen. At the 2 year mark the battery died and the shaver did not work aymore. Changed to my old rotary style shaver</li>
    <li> Great razor!!!  Gives a very close, smooth shave!!!</li>
    <li> Way too noisy...Didnt cut any better than my old Norelco....I just returned this and bought new heads for my Norelco.</li>
    <li> This razor doesn&#x27;t shave as well as my 2005 Panasonic three circular blade electric razor, which I unfortunately lost. Make sure that when you wash it you let it completely dry out before returning it to the case. Otherwise you will end up with a funky smelling razor that needs a lot of TLC to return to normal smelling status.</li>
    <li> Bought for my hubby and he loves it.</li>
    <li> This is my second shaver, working well.</li>
    <li> Save your money, this shaver is  garbage.  First off, the shave quality drops off significantly when the remaining power drops below 70%.  Secondly, I&#x27;ver gone through 2 foils, both having developed small cracks that lacerated my skin.  This piece of crap is junk...do not buy!!</li>
    <li> I am older than dirt ( 70+) and had not used an electric shaver for decades before I bought the Arc 4. I have shaved with a Gillette Fusion Power razor and blades forever and have always been pleased with the quality of the shaving experience.&lt;br /&gt;However, I grew tired of having only one shaving option. I selected the Arc4 because it is a wet/dry shaver and because of the many positive Amazon reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have used the shaver for about two months and am very happy with the results. I have used the shaver \\&quot;dry\\&quot; and \\&quot;wet\\&quot; with shaving foam, shaving oil, shaving cream, and shaving gel. So far I prefer American Crew shaving cream and Edge gel. I would not recommend shaving foam or shaving oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here are my user  \\&quot;ratings\\&quot; : 10&#x3D; great shave&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gillette Fusion razor  10.0&lt;br /&gt;Arc 4(shaving cream)  8.5&lt;br /&gt;Arc 4( shaving gel)  8.5&lt;br /&gt;Arc 4 (dry)  7.5&lt;br /&gt;Arc 4 (shaving foam)  4.0&lt;br /&gt;Arc 4 (shaving oil)  4.0&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This shaver is easy to clean and recharges  in less than 1 hour&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this shaver to my AARP friends and to those of you who will eventually have to deal with AARP membership as a option.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Review update: March 12, 2014&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I want to update my ratings now that I have had even more time to use the shaver. I continue to be very impressed: shaves well, relatively quiet, cleans in a couple minutes even with wet shaving, recharges in less than an hour, and the trimmer works fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Updated ratings:  10&#x3D; great shave&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gillette Fusion Razor  10.0&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Arc 4 wet  9.5&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Arc 4 dry  9.0&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have also found a new \\&quot;favorite\\&quot; shave cream: Cremo Shave Cream. It works as well as American Crew and costs about 70% less.</li>
    <li> I have been using this razor consistently since purchased. The quality of the razor and the shave it delivers is excellent. A few notes about the shaver:&lt;br /&gt;- charges rapidly&lt;br /&gt;- long battery life&lt;br /&gt;- great wet/dry shaving&lt;br /&gt;- ergonomically well designed&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those looking to transition, take the recommendation of using Shave Secret instead of shaving without any shave treatment. You will love the results!</li>
    <li> Panasonic makes the best shavers and this is the best one yet.</li>
    <li> This is approximately my 5-millionth electric shaver. I&#x27;ve had several Panasonic ones, one from Braun, a few from Remington, some from Wahl.. This is my 3rd or 4th Panasonic one (I don&#x27;t recall the exact model name of the first one because Panny likes to give their items really dumb model names with lots of numbers and letters) but it was about the same size and cost, and had about the same features.&lt;br /&gt;This one just doesn&#x27;t wow and in fact it barely gets the job done. My old Panasonic shaver (really, all of them,but in particular the most recent one) gave me a much cleaner shave, and did it with far fewer passes, too. It actually felt stronger too. This one you barely feel at all.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had this one for several months now so it&#x27;s not like my face has to &amp;#34;get used to it&amp;#34; first. No, it&#x27;s just not a good shaver.&lt;br /&gt;I like that it charges quickly (you can get a 10% quick charge within just 2 minutes or so, it&#x27;s very cool) but other than that there&#x27;s just nothing remarkable about this one. Unless it&#x27;s on a really steep sale, I don&#x27;t recommend it. It does no better than a cheap Remington I picked up for around 20 bucks a few years ago and kept around as a backup.</li>
    <li> I just received and started using this new razor. I have been using rotary Norelco shavers for many years, and in the past have tried foil razors, but they never matched the rotary razors. Not any more. Very powerful motor, unlike my current, anemic Norelco, and more powerful than any I have had in the past. Because of this., there is no pulling of whiskers. No cuts like from past foil razors. Closest shave of any electric I have ever used. While my Norelco is quieter, this unit is certainly not offensively loud to me. The only part of my shaves that require a manual razor is to shave where my sideburns and skin meet. The battery life has also been very good (although it is i new). I have been VERY pleasantly surprised by this razor, and I have only used it dry thus far. While I have only had it a short time, it sure seems like a real keeper.</li>
    <li> This gives a close, smooth shave. Even when used dry, on the first pass it cuts all my beard hairs: short and long, straight and curly. When used with hot lather it gives me the best shaves I&#x27;ve ever had.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You pay for it. The razor is expensive and the replacement cutters and foil are expensive.  But it&#x27;s worth it!</li>
    <li> Trimmer is difficult to handle, in an awkward place.  On-off switch must be locked or it will continually be switched off while you are shaving.  Cutting ability very good.  Clean shave.</li>
    <li> The shaver offers a pretty close shave (seems to match what has been advertised).  However, had I known that the shaver is totally dependent upon the battery—that the chord cannot be used when the battery loses its charge; I would not have purchased this model.  Given its very expensive price; I just assumed it would have such a feature.  Had it the option to use the chord to power the shaver, I would have given the shaver five stars.</li>
    <li> I had an old philips shaver that couldn´t use on shower, and it was making my skin itched, but now, with this Panasonic ES-LA63-S Arc 4 Shaver my skin is not getting irritated, and I can use it on shower what makes the process of shaving more light.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s great shaver on the world, i fell well with Panasonic es-la 66.  I using this shaver over one year and I like it so mutch.</li>
    <li> Works well. Easy to use.  My dad loves it and my father-in-law wants one too. Keeps a charge. Ergonomically designed.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this razor daily for about a month, having switched from wet shaving with a Gillette Mach 3 wet shaver on the recommendation of my son. I hated foil type electric shavers before--they pulled and left patches without endless passes.  With this razor I can get a dry shave as close as a razor in less time than a wet shave and with no irritation. It picks up longer stray hairs as well using the foil which makes it useful for other grooming tasks.  The trimmer is effective and safe as well. Cleaning is convenient and the battery easily lasts a week.  On the basis of a month&#x27;s use this appears to be a refined and well-built product.</li>
    <li> As most have noted, the shaver does an excellent job when working.  Unfortunately, between this shaver and another Panasonic (ES8243) I have owned, I have sent it to Texas for warranty replacement four times and once to NY for repair - which totals around $50 for my cost to ship to them (the ship back is their cost).  Each time the same failure occurs with the electronics malfunctioning, the razor turns on randomly and the display does not work.  Prior to these I used a Norelco Nivea razor which did not cut as well but never stopped working.  I really do like this razor&#x27;s performance but I wish they didn&#x27;t claim it was submersible and for wet use.</li>
    <li> This is the second Panasonic ES-LA63-S that I have owned.  Great product in my opinion!  Very reliable comfortable and lasts.</li>
    <li> I take blood thinner and as a result any cut results in excessive bleeding.  I bought this electric Panasonic E5 razor thinking it would give me a safe close shave. It does&#x27;nt even after the suggested 1 month \\&quot;give it time\\&quot; statement from the manufacturer it does not give me the close shave that I want.  I will go back to the risks of using a straight razor until I can locate a satisfactory replacement.  STAY AWAY!!!</li>
    <li> This shaver works very well, my second Panasonic electric shaver.  I received the ultimate compliment the other day when my coworkers and I were discussing electric vs. manual safety and he pointed out he thought I used a safety razor because of the close shave.</li>
    <li> Works great. It gets as close as a razor for me but the only difference would be the hair grows back a bit faster with this vs a razor. Doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin though I&#x27;m not too sensitive. I mostly use it dry but when I take it into the shower it&#x27;s even better. The battery life isn&#x27;t as long as my norelco that I had but 10 times better than the norelco. I get about 5 full shaves on it before needing a charge&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend it and would buy another if I broke this one</li>
    <li> pros:&lt;br /&gt;- close shave on most parts of my face&lt;br /&gt;- easy to clean&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;cons:&lt;br /&gt;- trimmer felt cheap, like I might break it every time I open it to use it&lt;br /&gt;- had difficulty getting in tight areas, like upper lip under nose&lt;br /&gt;- the head on this thing is huge - like shaving with a two-by-four&lt;br /&gt;- expensive&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;bottom line:&lt;br /&gt;- might work for some, but I was just never comfortable using it with it&#x27;s huge head, and was annoyed that it couldn&#x27;t get into tighter&lt;br /&gt;  areas of my face</li>
    <li> Have this shaver 5 days it&#x27;s great don&#x27;t waste your dollars on the 5 blade version I use it with edge gel and does a great job closer then my fusion Gillette  shaver very satisfied I do not understand why some are not getting the same results  I would recommend to all</li>
    <li> Just another not quite close enough electric shaver.  Very dissappointing. I like Schick hydro 5 blades as they give a very close shave.</li>
    <li> I guess this works for a lot of people, but not me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe it&#x27;s just my hair?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried an electric shaver 20 years ago and it didn&#x27;t work at all.  But after reading some reviews of this shaver, I figured the technology had improved.  It&#x27;s certainly a nice looking razor.  And it&#x27;s not loud.  And I like how the head swivels.  It&#x27;s just that it doesn&#x27;t actually remove any of my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s a slip of paper in the box that says (paraphrasing here), &amp;#34;Please don&#x27;t send this back until you&#x27;ve used it for a month.&amp;#34;  But I can&#x27;t go to work for a month with a hairy face.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been a blade user for over 40 years and decided to try an electric shaver. I read all the reviews and it came down to Panasonic vs Braun. I went with the ES-LA63-S primarily because of the price, performance and the ease of cleaning. I didn&#x27;t want the whole cleaning station thing and after using this shaver, I think they are totally unnecessary. I also didn&#x27;t think I would really use it for a wet shave, but I had a bunch of Edge shaving cream and gave it a try. Wow! Super close, smooth and comfortable.I would even go so far as to say that it gives a shave closer than a blade. Of course, I use it \\&quot;dry\\&quot; too, but like to use a pre-shave like Willimas Lectric shave or something similar. It holds a charge for about a week or seven shaves. Once it is down to about 20% I plug it in to charge. Also, I was concerned about being able to shave my upper lip close to my nose with such a big head on the shaver, but I&#x27;ve found that I have no problem at all. The only other thing that I would point out is that it really does take time to get used to an electric shaver. You have to perfect your shaving style based on your face and beard. Be patient and give it a couple of weeks. I&#x27;m very pleased with it.</li>
    <li> Superb shaver, best shave ever. Not cheap, but well worth the cost. I have tried every electric shaver on the market, Braun, Philips (Norelco), Remington, and this Panasonic leaves them all behind! It is well engineered and gives a superb shave.</li>
    <li> I recently retired my 8 year old Panasonic ES8228. It was pretty good, but it always struggled with the neck. The only way I could get a relatively close shave towards the end of it&#x27;s life, was using a full suite of wet shave products (pre-shave gel, shaving cream/brush, after-lotion). This ES-LA63-S absolutely blows it away. The dry shave was closer than a full wet shave with the old Panasonic, plus I can get through it in 2 minutes tops. Wet shave is marginally closer than the dry, just leaves a bit less irritation. The old one, the wet process would take a good 8 minutes, dry about 6. End of the day, even a dry shave with this, minus the neck, is as close as a safety razor shave, no doubt. The neck is the best I&#x27;ve gotten with an electric razor and it&#x27;s very close to a blade shave. No cons with this purchase, I should&#x27;ve done this years ago.</li>
    <li> He loves it!  I don&#x27;t know anything about razors but I thought this looked like a good deal for a pretty fancy razor.  He was a little intimidated by it at first, since the razor it replaces is over 10 years old, but I have heard him say nothing but good things about it.  He especially seems impressed with how fast it charges and stays charged.</li>
    <li> I bought this in May 2013 and I can proudly say this is one best products from Panasonic and a real &#x27;Made in Japan&#x27; one. I used a Braun before (Which was good) and Remington ( Worst). The Arc 4 does an excellent job and gives a clean shave. I have a thick beard and a dry skin (worst combo). So normally with a Gi****e razor I must shave every two days or the beard really thick I literally scream of pain while shaving. With the Arc4 I never had that problem, however one little issue (most common with most elec. shavers in the market) is it&#x27;s a little difficult to shave the neck area. I have to use the blade. The battery seems great so far. Maintenance is easy too, just put a little liquid soap on the foil and turn on the shaver, rinse under water and you are done.</li>
    <li> My husband absolutely loves this razor.  He had tried several electric razors in the past years and could never get used to using one so he always went back to a Bic razor.  He started using this and immediately noticed a nice smooth shave.</li>
    <li> Razor performs as advertised.  Still not close as a blade, but I have come to expect that to be the case.  Holds charge well, and recharges quickly.</li>
    <li> This razor does a great job.  I like that it can be used wet or dry.  Cleaning is very easy, and the display has an indicator when it is time to clean.  The battery gauge is useful since I like to charge it whenever it gets below 80%.</li>
    <li> I like being able to shave while in the shower.  Much easier to clean that way.  I had a shaver with shaving heads before this one and it was a big pain to clean.  As it got older it required more frequent cleanings.  This one gives a decent shave although not as close as I dream about.  I think the shave is actually a little worse with this one, but not a lot if any.  There is one annoying thing about this shaver is the position of the switch to turn it on.  When you hold the shaver to shave it is easy to hit the switch with your thumb and it shuts off.  You can lock the shaver in the on position, but so far I usually forget to do this until I shut it off, then I remember.  Not a big deal, but a slight annoyance.  Still early...if I encounter any problems or become even more pleased I&#x27;ll be back to update my review.</li>
    <li> The longer I use it the better it gets, wet or dry. Easy to clean, feels good, a pleasure to use but it is a little noisy. I shave early morning while my wife is sleeping so it can wake her. If noise is not an issue then I would highly  recommend it</li>
    <li> Bought my first Panasonic linear motor razor in 2001 and used it every day for about 10 years. Four years ago took it to my office to use occasionally when I forget to shave at home.  I have gone through three heads and one set of batteries and it still works fine. After taking it to the office, I went through several other brands and models and ended up getting this one recently.  This is the best one of all the rest.  What I don&#x27;t understand is why this brand is not sold in places such as w-matro and targeto?  I hope it will last as long as the previous one which is now 14 years old.</li>
    <li> Having read many reviews on which wet &amp; dry was the best I chose this model and what a brilliant razor it is.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Love this electric razor. It give a smooth shave and does it real fast. It&#x27;s better than Norelco brand I love it</li>
    <li> Excellent product, very close shave and very light, definitely I recommend this shave machine, very easy to use and cheap price.</li>
    <li> When used, the noise is too large</li>
    <li> Used a 4 blade razor until I received my LA-63. Am amazed at how comfortable and easy wet shaving is with this razor. The LA-63 follows the contour of my face and gives a close shave with minimal need for touch up. The trimmer works better than I expected, leaves a crisp clean trim line. I had a Panasonic ES7018 which gathered dust. This is like exiting the Dark Ages. My manual razor and blades are also packed away. Bought an extra foil and blades after several weeks of shaving because this is the way I am shaving in the future.</li>
    <li> I had used my Panasonic 8019 for about 6 years and it dropped it on the head and it&#x27;s just not right anymore.  I turned it into my traveler and it should be well suited for that.  I replaced it with this model and I must say I love it.  It&#x27;s quieter, faster and more comfortable.  I shave my head every 2 days with it and it works great.  I love the 14K rpm motor and it&#x27;s the only way to go.  If you&#x27;ve never tried this Panasonic, do it and you will buy your own.  I have nothing but positive remarks for this unit</li>
    <li> If I had purchased this at full MSRP ($300) it would not have gotten such a high rating.  I have yet to find an electric shaver that can tackle hair under my jawline and on my neck line.  Otherwise, on my face it does a very good job in chopping my thick black facial hair.  If done correctly it does indeed feel as smooth as a blade shave.  I recommend shaving up and down then turning the shaver 90 degrees and getting the stubborn hair at a perpendicular angle.  I give it 4 of 5 since it still has trouble with my neck and jawline.</li>
    <li> Great product. Effective in both dry and wet use. The head is large making shaving of mustache and sideburns more tricky but still effective. Very comfortable and easy on the skin. I had an ES8243 before. This one does a closer shaving and seems less noisy as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;- Good in wet and dry use.&lt;br /&gt;- Little to no irritation.&lt;br /&gt;- Fair price for quality.&lt;br /&gt;- Many shaves out of one charge cycle.&lt;br /&gt;- Very close and comfortable shaving.&lt;br /&gt;- Less noisy than ES8243.&lt;br /&gt;- Dual motor results in better shaving (personal impression from comparison to ES8243).&lt;br /&gt;- Lock of ON-OFF button is an useful feature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;- Large head requires more care when shaving mustache area and sideburns.&lt;br /&gt;- Carrying case is too small to fit both shaver and recharger (convenience aspect. Not detrimental to shaver itself).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend the product !</li>
    <li> i bought it for my dad but he hasn&#x27;t started to use it. I will update this review after he uses it.</li>
    <li> I gave it a 5 star rating simply because it gave me the best electric shave I have every had.</li>
    <li> Good shaver, even though now superseded by the 5-head design. BUT only if you shave every 1 or 2 days. If you sometimes, e.g., on vacation, let the beard grow longer, then you have to rely on the little pop-up trimmer and it&#x27;s pathetic. Much too small, and the main head gets in the way of moving it around your jaw. I use one of my older shavers, where the pop-up blade is the same length as the main set of blades. At the high price, this is very disappointing.</li>
    <li> Best shaver for a bald head that I have found, I owned 2 previous Panasonic models, all have been great and this one is even better! The only downside is the cost of replacement blades/foil. Shaver is tough and the battery seems to last forever.</li>
    <li> I have tried several different electric shavers over the years and finally found the one that really works for me. Several years ago I bought one of the first wet/dry models from Panasonic and I liked it. After that one stopped working it got replaced by other models as I tried to find one that would give me a closer shave. I finally went back to Panasonic and bought the ES-LA63-S. I have used it now for one month. This one can be used with equal efficiency dry or wet (I like to use it in the shower). Compared to my previous shavers from Norelco, Phillips, and Braun, this one works better. It provides a closer shave and it is faster. It takes me about 2 minutes to get a complete shave and it is very smooth without &amp;#34;skip areas&amp;#34; like some of the other shavers. The high RPM&#x27;s and multiple (4) blades of this shaver seem to make the difference in efficiency and ability to give you a very close shave. The battery life is very good and it charges very fast. I will keep this one for a long time.</li>
    <li> This is my third Panasonic shaver and the best I&#x27;ve ever had. My beard is not an easy one, with hair growing in all directions chaotically. The previous two razors (with two and three blades) never were able to shave a little spot near the mandible, close to the right ear. Well, this one does. And with a single pass.&lt;br /&gt;Pros: great value for the price, smooth shaving, quiet (in comparison with older models from Panasonic), easy to clean, duration of battery.&lt;br /&gt;Cons: should come with a charging dock and a small brush to remove the hair from the blades without the need for washing, the travel bag shoudl also fit the charger, in the case of long trips.</li>
    <li> As I mentioned in a previous review, I have been a Panasonic electric shaver user for over 20 years. I like the overall quality of Panasonic shavers and I think that they are the best electric shavers on the market. I have a heavy beard and they give me the closest shave with the least discomfort. That having been said, I was very disappointed with my previous Panasonic shaver (Model ES8077S Vortex Hydraclean System Electric Shaver) for two reasons: the shaver did not last as long as other ones I have owned (the rechargable batteries wore out way too prematurely for a shaver at this price level), and the HydraClean base unit was too large and bulky. As I said in my review of the HydraClean cartridges, the HydraClean system is an expensive gimmick.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have sinced purchased this Panasonic wet-dry shaver Model ES-LA63 (on sale at Target + a $25.00 rebate from Panasonic) and I am much happier with it. It is also much easier to clean by putting a few drops of SoftSoap on the foil head and rinsing it under the faucet at nano-speed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One more tip: Panasonic shavers frequently go on sale at discounters like Target and WalMart, and Panasonic offers rebates from time-to-time so it pays to read the circulars and shop around, especially around Fathers Day.</li>
    <li> I am very satisfied with the quality of these purchased items. They are not expensive, but are realy good, and I will recommend&lt;br /&gt;them to anybody...</li>
    <li> Excellent shaver. Best I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> Advertised as 4-Blade Cutting system.  I am not sure how they count the number of blades.......  It works, but disappointed that the &amp;#34;Marketing Term&amp;#34; of 4 blade is misleading.  I thought I paid premium for the 4 blades but I did not get the 4 blades.....</li>
    <li> I had been using a Braun shaver for the last 5 years.  Decided to try the panasonic based on the reviews.  Overall it works better than the Braun except for the mustache area.  Braun seemed to work better in this area.</li>
    <li> I bought this razor after having looked into the Braun momentarily. As everyone who reviewed that one critically had said they switched to the LA-63, I thought I&#x27;d give it a try. The \\&quot;minor\\&quot; inconveniences outlined in other reviews (that gave it 4-5 stars) seemed to be manageable, I would like to say that they are not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Many people say that \\&quot;it doesn&#x27;t do a good job on the neck,\\&quot; this is a major understatement. It does a terrible job on the neck, when it feels the convenience to do the job at all. The reason I switched to electric was to save time in the morning, I&#x27;m finding it takes LONGER to use this than a normal razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-The head is more than bulky, it&#x27;s like trying to shave with some sort of savage&#x27;s club. Forget sideburns, literally impossible to get a good line. A bit of hair around your forehead out of whack? Forget it again, you risk destroying your entire hairline.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Finally, and probably most disconcerting. This product doesn&#x27;t work when it&#x27;s plugged in. The genius who invented this feature must be a pretty malicious little devil who purposely thinks of ways to annoy people. It may be a \\&quot;safety feature,\\&quot; but as there&#x27;s a \\&quot;lock\\&quot; feature this becomes an unnecessary and bothersome redundancy. When I&#x27;m \\&quot;done\\&quot; shaving in the morning, and then catch a [few] little spot[s] that the tennis-ball-on-a-stick missed, I need to unplug it to embark on another journey. When you&#x27;re in a hurry in the morning this is a significant inconvenience as it&#x27;s fairy hard to plug and unplug [this is a good feature as it&#x27;s secure, however when combined with the non-functionality of being able to operate while plugged in, it becomes an ill-conceived inconvenience).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m unsatisfied with this product.</li>
    <li> My handicapped son has trouble with hand coordination, but was able to master this razor!</li>
    <li> Soft,smooth  and close shave. The 14000 RPM make the difference and does a great job.  I would recommand it to anybody looking to spoiled themself.</li>
    <li> This razor is amazing! My boyfriend kept getting rashes and little zits on sensitive areas on his neckfrom his old electric razor. I bought this electric razor and the rashes and little zits completely went away! He uses it in the shower and out of the shower (wet/dry shaver). It&#x27;s great! Highly recommend!!</li>
    <li> I read a lot of these reviews and they really helped me decide on this shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I first used it wet, in the shower with shaving cream. I had heard this was the closest shave so I gave it a shot. It was close but my skin was irritated. It could have been because it was the first time I had used it but since then I have tried it dry and it is amazing. It is easier to actually see the spots I have shaved clean and the spots I have missed. I have no irritation now and it might be the closest and most comfortable shave I have ever had. I would definitely recommend this to anyone who hates to shave with a razor.</li>
    <li> I purchased the ES-LA63-S as an upgrade to the 3-Blade ES8103S I&#x27;d been using the past three years.  I&#x27;ve been using electric razors for a long time, working through Brauns, Norelcos and Panasonics. My beard is coarse and dark, so it&#x27;s difficult to get to a smooth face with any of these razors. My hope was that the ES-LA63-S would shorten my too-long shave times, and leave me feeling smooth into the evening. Recently, I’ve been using the Lab Series Electric Shave Solution with both the old and new razors, which leaves my face smoother and less chaffed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used the ES-LA63-S for three weeks, and am now returning it. Its performance was no better than the smaller and easier to maneuver ES8103S - in fact, when I thought I was done with the ES-LA63-S, I found the ES8103S would still find areas of bristle to shave smooth. Even worse, my face had a stinging feeling and more nicks that I was used to finding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ES-LA63-S does have a very large head, making it challenging to move under the jawline and above the upper lip. I thought I might get used to it, but all I had to do was pick up and use the old ES8103S to recall how nimble that one is by comparison.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ES-LA63-S’s cutter blade is also more difficult to use – it is rather short and hides behind the massive shave head when trying to guide it using a mirror. The shaver does come with a nice zippered travel pouch. I also liked the lock switch – good to lock it off during travel, but I also had to use it while shaving to lock the razor on, as the on/off button is too easy to hit while shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In summary, this over-large, more expensive shaver under-performs the leaner, less-expensive 3-Blade shaver. I really hoped for this version to be a step up from the simpler model, but found it to be a real disappointment.</li>
    <li> Best I&#x27;ve ever had, although I don&#x27;t usually use the wet shave feature.  The battery life is good, and it delivers a close, comfortable shave.</li>
    <li> IT WAS A GIFT FOR A GRADUATION; I HAVE HEARD NOTHING BUT GOOD ABOUT IT</li>
    <li> Bought this for the bf in April of 2015. Three months later it&#x27;s not shaving as closely as it was after the first shave. He has to clean up the rest of the hairs with a razor. Could be better...</li>
    <li> Shave is closer than I expected from an electric razor especially when used wet. Easy to hold and holds the charge for numerous shaves.</li>
    <li> Recently retired and decided I was tired of always having to shower, lather and shave with a blade, so thought I&#x27;d try an electric. Bought this Panasonic ES-LA63S based on reviews and price. Not sure why I took so long to try an electric. Shaves pretty close with a pure &#x27;dry shave&#x27; but shaves very close after a shower and using Williams Lectric shave, or generic equivalent.&lt;br /&gt;Even though Panasonic suggested giving it a try for a month (to let your face get &#x27;adjusted&#x27; to the shaver) I had no discomfort from day 1 - although I like to think my skin is still relatvely smooth and I&#x27;m not heavy on the wrinkles (yet) and I suspect this contributes to comfort and closeness.&lt;br /&gt;I really like the timer - I shave on average in a minute, 45 seconds, and also like the charge indicator. I got over 3 weeks shaves from my first charge. LOVE the ease of cleaning under running water and the &#x27;hypersonic&#x27; cleaning feature. Includes convenient plastic protective cover and &#x27;leatherette&#x27; travel carrying case to protect and a well functioning &#x27;lock&#x27; switch to keep shaver from accidentally turning on in your luggage.</li>
    <li> I love it, Smooth running shaver. Works like it should. Best electric I ever bought.  I highly recommend it to everyone. For bald headed black males its perfect for head and face.</li>
    <li> This item not badCI prefer it.Looks pretty good,&lt;br /&gt;it just feels a bit large.Scrape clean.I like it.&lt;br /&gt;Give it a good.</li>
    <li> great product for cheaper then most other razors I use it on face and head ,great process all the way around</li>
    <li> best electric shave out</li>
    <li> Excellent closely shaving device in less than two minutes. This shaver is not only fast and efficient but also inexpensive.</li>
    <li> Got it for hubby for Xmas and he LOVES it!</li>
    <li> After a lot of research I purchased this shaver solely for the purpose of shaving in the shower.  I&#x27;ve experimented with shaving cream, soap and nothing and found that a thin layer of shaving cream produces a really close shave. Sometimes I have to hit the neck area a second time around.  I only shave every few days so it cuts through scruff impressively.  Overall, I&#x27;m very impressed with battery life, shave quality, and ease of use.  I am bummed that the price went down $50 (buy it now) from my purchase price. Other than that there are only three small complaints: the power button is in a spot where I keep turning it off accidentally. I&#x27;ve adjusted how I hold it so that helps. Second, the trimmer is very small and not great for body areas away from the face. My prior panasonic had larger &#x27;teeth&#x27; and larger trimmer which I prefer. And finally, it is hard to get the hair right under my nose because the head is large. I have to use a regular razor.</li>
    <li> bought this for my husband.  He has had electric razors that never performed as expected.  Not this one!  He loves the super smooth shave, ease of cleaning, and the fact he can take it into the shower.  A little pricey but worth every penny.  Will not be disappointed in this purchase.</li>
    <li> It cuts quickly and does pretty well when using it in the shower on a soapy lather but during dry shaves the ES-LA63 isn&#x27;t the most comfortable. It has trouble providing a uniform close, smooth shave. I also haven&#x27;t had much luck trimming under my nose. The trimmer is too small as well. Overall I&#x27;m not thrilled with this shaver but I&#x27;m also not completely dissatisfied either.</li>
    <li> good razor works great on everyone have 3 people using it keeps a great charge cuts the hair right off easy to use cleans easy</li>
    <li> This was a gift for my son. It arrived in good time and the price was excellent. He has used this several times and thinks he gets a better shave with this than he did with his previous rotary shaver. He feels it is a very smooth shave comparable to using a blade. He has pretty heavy facial hair. Happy with shaver. Also really pleased with the cleaning procedure-liquid soap and running water. Quick, easy, and convenient.</li>
    <li> I really like this razor, really well. I survived it, great. I am very satisfied, I hope next time there Promotions</li>
    <li> Recommend, very good shaver and  it is $20 cheaper than in TARGET.And it is made in JAPAN,not second world countries!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve done a lot of research to choose this one. I wanted a wet/dry, easy cleaning, go anywhere shaver. It didn&#x27;t work to me.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll tell how sensitive my neck skin is, I can only shave once a week, its the time to avoid folliculitis. I thought a nice shaver would solve this, my mistake. To make it worse, shaving results are poorer in the neck part of the beard, I always have to use Gillete (just a little) in order to give the final touch.&lt;br /&gt;Solution I came with: Laser session scheduled...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[Update] After a couple of months I have to review my anterior review. After three weeks of daily use my skin got adapted and I&#x27;ve got smooth dry shaving with much less irritation.&lt;br /&gt;Wet isn&#x27;t good at all, but I dont care, dry takes 3 minutes of my morning. Neck shaving still need rapairs with Gillete, so I&#x27;ll do the laser sessions just in that area.&lt;br /&gt;Hair picking hurts sometimes, but its rare.&lt;br /&gt;Really recommended!</li>
    <li> My husband says this is a great electric razor.  Nice, close shave, great trimming easy to clean and easy to pack.</li>
    <li> I love Panasonic electric razors.  Overall this razor is very good, but the head is too large to effectively reach tight places like under your nose.</li>
    <li> I was looking for away to cut costs of those expensive blades.  I bought the ES-LA63-S and could not be happier.  This gives a very smooth shave and no skin irritation.  Great buy</li>
    <li> This is a great shaver out of the box. After trying 3 Braun shavers, 2 other Panasonic’s I got frustrated and rebuilt my old $50 Remington and used it for 2more years. When it died I tried to buy a Remington replacement but they no longer make the shaver and $250 for a used shaver that cost $50 didn’t sit well with me. Therefore I bought this thinking it would be just as bad as all the others but it is by far the best shaver I’ve tried…ever. The Remington did some areas of my face better that this unit but overall it is better. 5 Stars for a great shave with no hair pulls.</li>
    <li> Always had panasonic shavers.  This model has a battery that drains really fast...much faster then my prior cheaper panasonic model.  Otherwise, great quality; does the job.</li>
    <li> Upon retirement, I switched to electric for the convenience.&lt;br /&gt;Panasonic gives a nice massage while nippy away at my growth.&lt;br /&gt;Takes a few more passes than the blade to get &amp;#34;close.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;Will get used to it.&lt;br /&gt;Clean with a blast from can of compressed air.</li>
    <li> I like Panasonic product, industrial design is very good, work or shaving, clean, not to stimulate the face, shave, wash directly, convenient</li>
    <li> I have been shaving for over 50 years, and I had never spent over $100 on a shaver until now, but boy am I glad I did on the Panasonic shaver!  It got top marks in Consumer Reports, which is how I came to know about it, and the testers were absolutely right.</li>
    <li> Quick, quiet and smooth. Great for shaving n shower.</li>
    <li> This was my first electric shave experience, and I almost gave up on electrics entirely and went back to the cartridges. Thankfully I stuck with it and found a keeper in the Sensotouch 3D.    Here&#x27;s what I know about the Arc 4: It does an awful job on my neck hair. I pass over time and time again and still see rather long hairs just sticking out, even when I shave twice. Shave, rinse, lather again, shave again and still the neck hairs. Really frustrating. My facial hair doesn&#x27;t approach anything close to Paul Bunyan levels of manliness or wirey-ness either.    This thing also chewed up the under part of my chin. Used it today and it felt like it was ripping skin off. Thankfully it just felt like it and I wasn&#x27;t gushing blood. But speaking of blood, the shaver gave me too many nicks and cuts for my liking, too.    Bottom line, it&#x27;s a pretty big disappointment considering the reviews and reputation of the shaver. The quality of shave and ease of use are not worth the high price of admission and caused more problems than anything.</li>
    <li> While this seems to work in the main facial areas, I find that after a few months, it does not shave all that closely in the areas below the jaws on the neck. Some single hairs are left uncut. So it would appear that it does handle uneven surfaces. Not very happy.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t seem to match up to higher costs and ratings.  Shaving while wet with gel don&#x27;t work well at all.</li>
    <li> gives a great shave but the on/off button is frequently hit by accident (bad location) and the charger cord is difficult to use (poorly designed plug head).</li>
    <li> Wow! Impressive shaver. I was skeptical to pay so much for an electric razor, but my wife had checked the reviews and this one kept getting high marks. Typically they say you should give a new razor two weeks so that your skin/beard can adjust to the new blade configuration. But, I have to say that my face LOVED the first shave, and everyone since. I have NEVER had a closer shave with an electric razor, and I have a  heavy beard. It does not pull. It holds a charge. It has an LED display that tells you how much charge you have left that is accurate. It is light weight and comfortable in your hand. I have used a rotary electric razor for 30 years, and I have to say, my wife is right, you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> My husband says this is the best shaver he has ever had (though it has to be said he has never spent this much on one before!). He loves this thing. He has sensitive skin so I chose this one because I found a review somewhere that said it is good for people with sensitive skin. But don&#x27;t think for a moment that that must mean it doesn&#x27;t do the job: my husband had basically never had a thoroughly clean-shaven face until he got this shaver, because some of his stubble is very tough indeed. Now he is perfectly cleanly shaved every day. He generally just does a dry shave, but sometimes he uses Kiss My Face Moisture Shave for a sort of wet shave with this shaver. (BTW, Kiss My Face Moisture Shave is another excellent product that doesn&#x27;t stink or upset sensitive skin.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the event that the shaver needs to have parts (blades??) replaced before the time the manufacturer states, I will update my review accordingly. My husband said that even a cheap Remington worked well for the first week (though it never got him any more clean-shaven than any of the other cheap shavers he&#x27;s had in the past) -- until the blade(s) went blunt -- though by &amp;#34;worked well&amp;#34; he didn&#x27;t mean that the cheap Remington got him clean shaven, just that it didn&#x27;t feel too bad or destroy his skin while leaving most of the stubble in place.</li>
    <li> My husband really likes it. It does a great job. I did read several reviews before I made this purchase.</li>
    <li> It is better than my last shaver and not expensive. But it does not reach my expectation. I think manual shaver is better.</li>
    <li> It does a great job of giving me a close smooth shave.  I love that you can get it wet and have a nice cool shave by rewetting it.  It is really easy to clean.  Just put a liquid soap on it and run it with a little added water on the blades.  No more brushes that get caught in the screen.</li>
    <li> I have tried many electric razors and none work well for my skin and beard type ( sensitive skin/thick beard).  This will be my last electric, I will be going back to a blade.</li>
    <li> Very happy with the shaver it also does my head very well. Battery life is good and I love the fact that you can get it wet in the shower.</li>
    <li> This was a Christmas gift for my son and he really liked it.  I bought extra razors to go with it.</li>
    <li> This shaver does a great job!  I was a satisfied Braun user for years until I lost the cord on a trip and found I couldn&#x27;t get a replacement cord anymore.  The price and reviews for this were both excellent, so I decided to give it a try.  Couldn&#x27;t be happier!  LOVE the option to wet shave...that alone is worth changing for!  Nice close, comfortable shave.  Try this Panasonic!</li>
    <li> Works as expected.  Holds a charge amazingly long.  I&#x27;ve probably had this for 8 months or so...maybe a year now.  I use it every day and charge it once every couple weeks.  Charges up very quickly and then I put the charger away again.  Nice for travel as well, since I don&#x27;t need to bring the charging cord.  Prior to this I had an older Remington.  This is superior in terms of technology, at least compared to my older model.  Bought this based on reviews.  Although I like how the Remington fit in my hand a little better.  More natural.  The big head on this makes it top heavy.  Not a big deal.  I got used to it pretty quickly.  *********************** Update April 2015 ************************** I&#x27;ve had this for a year now.  Still running strong and very satisfied.  I only charge it once every couple weeks, but my usage is probably every other day or so.  I recently took a 10 day vacation and it&#x27;s so easy to bring this vs shaving kit.  I didn&#x27;t bring the power chord, since it easily holds a charge all week.  I believe it still had 40% of the battery life when I returned home.  It&#x27;s already been a week since my return and still haven&#x27;t re-charged it.</li>
    <li> I did a lot of research on electric shavers online. There&#x27;s always positive and negative reviews on every single shaver out there. I suppose that&#x27;s because everyone&#x27;s hair is different, so different products work better for some than others. I myself am mostly Italian with very thick, almost black hair. My facial hair doesn&#x27;t grow really fast though. I settled on Panasonic because I got their Nose/ear hair trimmer and it cut incredibly closely with ease and without pulling hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; However, I was more than a little disappointed with their electric shaver. Especially for the price- over $100 when I got it. Not sure what it&#x27;s at now and don&#x27;t care to check. First I&#x27;ll start with the pros though:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Easy to clean- Doesn&#x27;t get much easier than this. Run it under water, or squirt some hand soap on the top and let it bubble up and wash it off. When you need to take the head off and clean the insides, a light goes off to tell you. The head comes off and goes back on very easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; The head can either be locked in place or bobble around freely. This creates much more maneuverability going around your chin and neck especially.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Very close shave- the finished results are an incredibly close shave. Smoother than I can get with a razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Now the cons are shorter, but much more important. Though the product is easy to use and clean, and the finished results of what it does get are incredibly smooth, it just doesn&#x27;t get everything it should. I have to go over every spot over and over and over again. And then on my neck and some parts of my face I end up just using a razor because this shaver simply wont get them. It&#x27;s very frustrating paying over $100 for a product that wont do what it&#x27;s supposed to. With how long it takes just to shave what it is able to shave, I found myself returning to the good old razor blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; In the future, I will be trying Wahl&#x27;s electric shaver. My barber uses it on me when he cuts my hair and it works extremely well with minimal effort. I&#x27;ll be posting a review of that one too when I try it.</li>
    <li> This is the best Electric Razor I&#x27;ve ever owned</li>
    <li> More comfortable, from the beginning, than I&#x27;d been led to expect.</li>
    <li> I have used 3 electric shavers my entire shaving career (25 years) - 2 remingtons and, most recently, a braun 3 series which died after only 3 years of moderate use.  I was definately not going back to Braun for that reason and had planned on revisiting the Remington line since I had 2 shavers that lasted me a combined more that 20 years.  I&#x27;m glad I checked out Panasonic and decided to spend a few more bucks on this shaver in particular.  I used it for the first time last night and was very impressed with the power and ease with which it cur through my 3 days of growth.  I prepped my face how I always do (scrub, dry, Remington Pre-Shave FaceSaver Powder Stick) and the process of shaving was very comfortable, although it took a little longer than normal, I anticipate that will decrease as I use it more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overal, I am extremely happy with this product!!</li>
    <li> I got it for my hubby who is a complainer.and he has yet to complained about this.&lt;br /&gt;Must be awesome!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Braun&#x27;s for years - had also tried a Norelco/Phillips with the circular blades, but this is hands-down the most comfortable, quickest and closest electric shaver I&#x27;ve tried - about 3 minutes to shave.  I bought it just over a year ago.  It has worked fine for 3-4 shaves a week.  I use it in the shower wet with a not-too-lathery shaving cream.  I&#x27;ve used it dry a couple of times while travelling and definitely prefer the wet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The large head and contour-following blades shave everything on my face quickly - even the bit right under my nose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mine developed an issue with the LCD screen going wonky and then quitting altogether after about 8 months - it still shaved, but I couldn&#x27;t tell how much charge was left.  Since the warranty was for 2 years, I boxed it up and sent it into Panasonic&#x27;s repair facility in TX and got a brand-new boxed LA-93 (same model, essentially but with the optional cleaning/charging base) in about 15 days.  Haven&#x27;t tried the cleaning cartridge on that yet, but the LA-63 was easy to clean with a quick soap and rinse.</li>
    <li> Excellent machinery. Holds a long charge.</li>
    <li> Excellend dry shaving and the wet shaving is damn close to the razor.</li>
    <li> Use it for about a month and you&#x27;ll love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was too rough on my skin the first time I used it. After I learned how to use it better it&#x27;s been working flawlessly</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used electric razor in about 30 yrs. well they&#x27;ve come a long way to work a lot better. I&#x27;m really impressed with this razor, they say it takes about 30 days to get used to using an electric razor. it&#x27;s only taken me about 10 days. if you wanna good razor then this one&#x27;s for you</li>
    <li> would have 5 stars if the manul was included  it said to read before using but  wasnt in the box  thay was bad</li>
    <li> wet your face, quickly rub a little soap over your face, wet the head of the shaver--waaaay better than using a dry shaver. good quality product. forget the braun since their replacement heads are pieces of junk since Phillips bought them out.</li>
    <li> This is the best electric razor I have owned.  I have had it for almost a year, and it has never let me down.  The charge holds very well and can last for several shaves.  It is easy to clean and maintain.</li>
    <li> In 1966 I was stationed in Germany where a neighbor, who worked for the Braun company, gave me an electric razor. Since that time I have only used an electric razor to shave with. The Panasonic is without a doubt a major improvement in electric shaving. It is better in all areas and should be looked at as a quantum leap in electric shavers.</li>
    <li> After I dropped my Panasonic ES-LA93-K, I replaced it with this razor.  Panasonic definitely knows what they are doing.  Wet or dry, this razor delivers a very close shave.  I get almost 2 weeks out of a charge.  This is easily the nicest razor I have owned so far.  Hard to believe you would not be impressed as well.</li>
    <li> I love everything about this razor.  Great shave.  Smooth.  Good battery.  I will definitely buy another when the time comes.</li>
    <li> best i have used. i have a sensitive face, less irritation than a blade. very close shave. battery has a long life</li>
    <li> Perfect shaver for Asians.I will recommend it to my friends.&lt;br /&gt;I have to say it is As good as 790cc.</li>
    <li> I ordered this for my husband rather than ordering blades for his Norelco. I read the reviews which were mostly positive.  It seems that the reviews were accurate &amp; my husband likes the shaver and it gives him a good close shave.  As pervious reviewers stated, this shaver is a bit noisy,  but if it does the job, and my husband is happy, then I am happy.</li>
    <li> I had tried electric razors on and off over many years but always returned to using blades. This razor has finally converted me to an electric razor. It does not pull, even if I go all weekend without shaving. No, it is not capable of shaving quite as close as a blade, but it is the best electric razor that I have ever used and I have not yet drawn blood using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Clean-up is a breeze and the battery life is decent. I generally charge the razor about once a week. I had a much cheaper Panasonic wet/dry model before and that experience was positive enough to make be expect that one of their higher end razors would be worth the money. I was right and I am glad that I did not give up on electrics.</li>
    <li> Very comfortable,my father love it.</li>
    <li> A good razor at a fair price if you can catch a sale. I&#x27;m not sure if you get anything better at the 150 or 200 dollar price points but this does a good job, is easy to clean, runs for quite awhile on one charge. The only thing that costs it a star is it will snag if you get too care free with the direction of your shave.</li>
    <li> First off, I love the razor.  I only use it dry.  I shave every day with it, but sometimes every other day on occasions.  It does a good job.  I really like it and will probably never go back to a regular razor. A regular razor would tear my face up when shaving every day, which is why I opted to try an electric razor.  This electric razor doesn&#x27;t aggravate, nick, or cut my skin whatsoever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Something that I have to do is go over and over areas to ensure all whiskers are cut and that they are cut as close to the skin as possible.  One or two passes won&#x27;t cut it.  Even with that said, it&#x27;s so much easier and convenient to shave with an electric razor.  I usually find that in 5 minutes time I can get a very close shave that is just about as close as a regular blade without the blood and shaving cream mess to clean up.  Really like the Panasonic razor.</li>
    <li> So far so good!  Used it about a month or two.  Holds charge much better than the about 5 year old Panasonic that it replaced, probably both because of newness and that battery technology has evolved (I&#x27;m pretty sure this uses a lithium ion battery).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A little bigger, but that is due to the two axis motion of the cutting head.  Cuts very close, is not too loud, and charges quickly.  Cleans fairly easily, and immersible to make that easier still.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If this continues to work well for a year I&#x27;ll probably upgrade the review to five stars.  I dropped one for expense - it was heady at $140 or so.  You can find open box ones for a little less.</li>
    <li> Have been using electric razors for years, and this one is the best.  Shaves close,  nice features and so easy to clean; just rinse it!  I liked my old Panasonic, but buying and using those cleaning cartridges was  a pain.</li>
    <li> A close shave at last.  Good performance and love the LCD</li>
    <li> Thus far, it has worked well.</li>
    <li> Works fantastic.  Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> My older shaver was exactly the same model.  Rather than get a new blade component, I thought I would order a new shaver which might be superior.  Not.  The same machine with the same shaving capability.  Best if used with a foam or shaving lotion, otherwise tends to irritate.</li>
    <li> Best razor that I&#x27;ve EVER had.  I hardly ever use a blade anymore.  Very close shave!!  Wouldn&#x27;t buy anything else!!</li>
    <li> I do not have a heavy beard.  It&#x27;s coarse, and even, but I can go without shaving for a couple of days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried this product wet, with and without shaving cream or lotion.  I&#x27;ve tried it dry as well:  My conclusion is this device is grossly mislabeled.  It&#x27;s not and never has been intended to use to shave facial hair.  It was likely a failed school project.  Or possibly a a device designed to exemplify the meaning of electrical inefficiency, or how loud something must be to cause permanent hearing loss over a prolonged period of time.  I won&#x27;t pretend to have the answer.  I know only this:  It is a dismal failure at shaving my face.  I can go over an area multiple times in multiple directions and it misses 20-75% of the stubble.  After a the time required to &#x27;shave&#x27; ones face; the irritation is worse than that of a traditional razor.  It&#x27;s extremely inefficient when it comes to power consumption, and delights in dying in the middle of a shave with no warning at all whatsoever.  The head is broad and laughable in its imprecision.  The trimmer is so poorly placed as to be utterly pointless, but at this point, I&#x27;m so disappointed I may be nit-picking.  I tried everything suggested and more to make it work correctly.  I did so with diligence past the point of return.  So I am stuck with this damned, over-priced noise maker.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical of the reviews. I&#x27;ve tried electric shavers of all sorts, mostly cheap ones. They all left my face feeling like I shaved with a belt sander. I am a believer now. This doesn&#x27;t pull, nick, scratch or abrade. It just leaves my baby face untouched. Really nice product.</li>
    <li> Very happy. Gives great shave</li>
    <li> I have been using this for over a month now as a replacement for a recent  Braun model (of which I had 2)  that kept dying.  Even though I had already been using an electric razor (the Brauns that needed continual repairs on which I finally gave up), it took about 2 weeks of using this Panasonic before I could say I was finally starting to get a really close shave.  The things I like about this razor: Very smooth shaving - no pulling, no irritation; very fast charge times, very easy cleaning; good balance for handling; solid construction; close enough shave (the Braun was marginally better, this is still really good); pivoting head.  Things that could use improvement:  Battery life - it is good but the Braun was better - I can get about 10 days vs. 14 days with the Braun on a charge - I hate travelling with chargers; the wide head makes it tough to get your upper lip under your nose - I need to do some careful maneuvering; the pop-up trimmer could be a bit bigger, and an even closer shave. Thus far, I have generally been happy with it.  At least it hasn&#x27;t died yet!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***Update July 24, 2015***&lt;br /&gt;I have been using it for about a year now, and it is still going strong.  Battery life remains decent, and the shave is still good. I am about to replace the blades and foil since it seems like I need to spend a greater time shaving now to get a close shave.  About a 1 year for a replacement baled and foil isn&#x27;t bad.  The large shave head and size  is more of an issue for me now, so I also just bought a Panasonic ES-LT41 to use for travel.  I have been happy with the quality of the Panasonic razors. This model remains a 4-star.</li>
    <li> CLOSEST SHAVE EVER! Just not a 5 star since the battery lasts only 5 or 6 shaves.</li>
    <li> This is my second Panasonic ES- LA 63. It is a great product</li>
    <li> One of the better electric razors that I have used, great buy for the money.</li>
    <li> Best Panasonic shaver to date. Absolutely love it! Far better than the ES 8243, and that was a great shaver!</li>
    <li> I have mostly used Braun razors in the past.  This Arc4 is superior.  It gives a very close shave.  Battery lasts a long time before needing the one hour recharge.  have not tried it wet. For the price point, this is a great option!  Check&lt;br /&gt;out the rating in Consumer Reports.</li>
    <li> Very pleased with the performance of this shaver.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m pleasantly pleased with how close I&#x27;m able to get with little irritation.&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this shaver.&lt;br /&gt;Richard</li>
    <li> very good product.super</li>
    <li> Bought for my husband.</li>
    <li> After using &#x27;other&#x27; electric shavers I am totally satisfied with the Panasonic.  It does a super job without the pressure that &#x27;others&#x27; required.</li>
    <li> Got seduced by the stars and reviews and purchased this item.  Here is my review:&lt;br /&gt;1. Extremely loud, did wake up my wife in the bedroom next door few times&lt;br /&gt;2. Bulky!&lt;br /&gt;3. Trimmer is rather small and not visible in the mirror reflection because of the large head&lt;br /&gt;4. Rub it too long on one spot and you feel the heat&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Moving on to something else.</li>
    <li> Covers a large surface area, making short work of stubble, but still gets to hard to reach places like under my nose. Close shave dry.  Battery life is excellent.</li>
    <li> I had purchased this to replace another Panasonic that I think was the same or similar. It never seemed to work as well as the first, and after only four months I replaced this one with a Braun (also reviewed on Amazon).</li>
    <li> Got this and the replacement blades for hubby&#x27;s Christmas present. He loves it.</li>
    <li> This electric razor is the best I have ever used. I used to have the model below it and it lasted me over five years. I finally upgraded to this one, and I am just as in love with it. It doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin, and I have sensitive skin when it comes to shaving.&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: After about two months of use, I woke up in the middle of the night and heard this random buzzing sound. I find my Panasonic razor sitting on the counter turned on by itself. I turn it off and a few minutes later it turns on by itself again. This happened so many times I eventually left it out on the patio so it could run its batteries out without waking me up. I gave it one more chance and charged it up. Same thing happens again. I&#x27;m guessing what happened is the water from the shower shorted it out or something. I always use my razor in the shower. My old panasonic razor that I upgraded from is still going strong after about 8 years. Total bummer...</li>
    <li> Still giving me a good shave after 3+ years.</li>
    <li> My husband normally shaves with cream and a blde, but he wanted to try an electric for the convenience. He had tried&lt;br /&gt;quite a few &amp;#34;top ratred&amp;#34; electric razors over the years, but was never satisfied with the shave. This Panasonic is wonderful!&lt;br /&gt;He hasn&#x27;t shaved with anything but it since receiving it. It produces a very close, clean shave with minimal effort. I highly&lt;br /&gt;recommend it.</li>
    <li> Having ventured out into the world outside of Panasonic as far as men’s shavers are concerned- let me say this- I’m not going back into that world. I have always used Panasonic shavers – and while they have not been perfect- in my opinion they are the best. I’ve tried Braun and Norelco and others and have not been satisfied at all. Recently I bought the Braun 3 series and shelled out almost $200. It is a fine shaver but it never came close to Panasonic. It did a good job overall but over I needed to go over spots many times- and progressively it took longer and longer to get the results I wanted. This did a number on my skin and during the cold dry winter months my skin would be very sensitive and sore, especially the area below my nose. I knew I needed to go back to Panasonic so I bought the ES-LA63-S Arc4.&lt;br /&gt;Off the bat the shaver looks very different form the other Panasonic models I’ve been used to. Its got a huge head- but it feels right and comfortable in your hand. I charged it a bit up to 30% and tried it out- the motor is superfast and its very quiet. The razors do a great job picking up everything even the hard stubbles above my neck- at 30% the shaver did a faster and better job than the Braun model. I was impressed already but really I expected the ES-LA63-S Arc4 to do well. Im glad I went back to the Panasonic shavers and I know my sensitive skin will thank me for it.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my brother, and he absolutely loves it.  He said it was the best shaver he has ever owned.</li>
    <li> After some 40 years shaving with various electric razors, I have been generally disapointed one way or another until now. I have come to believe that different faces will get better results with different styles of cutting heads and much will be a matter of trial and error.  For me, this Panasonic is fantastic.  My last 2 razors were Braun because I believed they were the best for a close shave, plus I liked the self-cleaning feature.  My last Braun 2 months ago, was terrible. It was the 2nd from the top of the line (replacing the next lower model which I had for 4 years). I got a good shave for about 2 weeks then it started actually pulling out hairs. Quite painful. It went back. Then I tried this one. I was hesitant because I thought the size and shape of the cutting surface would keep me from getting all the difficult spots. I was wrong. This unit is very smooth and close for my medium-tough beard. I have never used it wet or with lotion and it is still excellent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another concern was from other reviews that complain about the short battery life. That is either a bad unit or someone is doing it wrong. I have had this for nearly a month and I&#x27;m still on the first charge. It&#x27;s now 30%.  What I did was I shaved and ran it all the way down when I first opened it. Then I recharged it to max. I think this conditions the battery to hold a full charge. Even now at 30% it hasn&#x27;t slowed down and shaves great. It cleans easily by just pulling off the top and running under water. Time will ultimately tell, but I think I will enjoy this shave for many years. I highly recommend this Panasonic ES-LA63-S.</li>
    <li> Skin type: super sensitive&lt;br /&gt;Hair type: coarse&lt;br /&gt;Hair density: medium to heavy&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have happily owned a Panasonic ES8243A Arc 4 for the last 4 and a half years without complaint. Was time to order replacement blades so I decided to look at the new options available. Here is my quick review of the updated ES-LA63-S&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, Panasonic still makes the world&#x27;s best shavers. I&#x27;ve owned a very expensive Braun which did not get this close. Any Arc 4 is going to get you RAZOR CLOSENESS. I prefer using dry shave with a bit of &#x27;lectric shave to help the razor glide, without hindering my ability to pull the skin in various directions to help get a closer shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The ES-LA63-S is a terrific razor, but may not really be worth an extra $39 over the &amp;#34;older&amp;#34; ES8243A (at time of publishing it is $39). The cutting system appears the same. The now &amp;#34;thinner&amp;#34; foil is something I can&#x27;t really test.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The advantages are :&lt;br /&gt;-It is pleasantly quieter over the original model&lt;br /&gt;-The head has some additional tilting mechanism, which might be useful for some people (I prefer a rigid head so I can really control the damn thing. The LA63 is like a lexus, the ES8243 was more like a BMW in that regard, but you can lock the head and achieve the same.)&lt;br /&gt;-Brighter LCD&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shave, to me, is nearly identical. So identical I couldn&#x27;t tell you if this razor is cutting closer because the blades are new, or if because it has some enhancements.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a marketer so sorry if I don&#x27;t believe everything I read.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one Con : The head is like 30% larger than the previous model, but you don&#x27;t get anything additional shaving space...It probably just holds the mechanism for tilting side and back. Ok that&#x27;s fine, but see my comment about regarding control.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If money is an issue, grab the $99 ES8243A while you can - I promise you won&#x27;t be able to tell the difference. If you have the extra cash, get the brighter LCD, quieter motor, and more floaty head on the LA63.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are my 2 cents. Enjoy!</li>
    <li> Got this for my husband for Christmas and he can&#x27;t stop raving about the great shave he gets with it.  Best electric razor he has ever had!!</li>
    <li> hubby loves it! he is completely satisfied!</li>
    <li> Yep. That&#x27;s me. Until I spent 99 cents on Amazon&#x27;s ebook on electric shavers. I had to wait until I was 60 years old to find out for the first time in my life WHAT I should be shaving with. After reading the book, I kinda did something bad. I went to Target, bought this razor, got the BEST shave of my life for 5 days, then returned it. Next I ordered it for considerably LESS on Amazon and it will arrive this coming Thursday. In the meantime, I am shaving with my Norelco, which does a great job but burns the crap out of my neck. People at work ask me \\&quot;what happened to your neck?\\&quot;  They have learned now not to ask. Not only was there NO razor burn, but I have neck hair that grows parallel with my neck!  Hair too lazy to stand up?  Anyway, the Panasonic whisked it away like a duck in a tornado!  Want the BEST shave of your life?  It might not be THIS razor!  Read the book first. That is the key!!!  For ME the Panasonic ES-LA63-S is the BEST shave of my life. Find out what yours is. Read the book!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I only use electric and have owned a previous Panasonic model for the last 7 years.  My current shaver costs roughly the same amount as this one back then.  The difference between this model and the old one is almost indescribable.  The 4 blades glide over your face with no resistance as opposed to the constant grating/grabbing of hair.  It almost feels like the shaver isn&#x27;t cutting, but it feels just as close if not closer than a traditional shave...so much so that I now shave every other day as opposed to every day, there simply isn&#x27;t enough growth the next day to warrant it.  The larger head allows a quicker shave than before.  That being said the head is pretty large and you need to be a little more careful making sure you get to all the hairs on the upper lip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few notes if you are considering other Panasonic models:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-You don&#x27;t need the separate cleaner...I&#x27;ve had one before and when i did use it (not very often) it didn&#x27;t clean any better than simple soap and running water from the faucet, and it left an undesirable smell (you are putting this thing under your nose) that you had to rinse off anyway.  Plus it takes up space and you need to buy cleaner fluid.  Does not add anything other than $$$.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Number of blades.  Had 3 before and that size was a bit more manageable.  Not sure if the 4 blade cuts so well because of the number of blades or the newer technology.  The 4 blade is on the verge of being too big but it works for me so far (travel a lot and need all the space I can get).  I would sacrifice the size for the comfort.  I think the 5 blade would too big and too hard to maneuver on the upper lip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Price.  Extremely happy with purchase and would pay more for this to get the comfort.  I&#x27;ve had Panasonic shavers and they last (regular cleaning and replacing of blades every 2 years or so), never had an issue functionality wise (battery was good for the last 7 years).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line is I looked at all the reviews and knew I personally liked the foil type better than rotary and knew that Panasonic makes a decent, durable shaver, knew I didn&#x27;t need a separate cleaner and was hoping to get a marginally better shave than what I had now (didn&#x27;t want to invest any more money into replacement blades for a 7 year old shaver).  I got a huge improvement and couldn&#x27;t be happier with the purchase, so much so that I put a review here, something I have rarely do, especially a positive review.views and knew I personally liked the foil type better than rotary and knew that Panasonic makes a decent, durable shaver, knew I didn&#x27;t need a separate cleaner and was hoping to get a marginally better shave than what I had now (didn&#x27;t want to invest any more money into replacement blades for a 7 year old shaver).

    <li> Jaw is doing a great job. But in the neck makes it very bad. I have to get with a razor blade.&lt;br /&gt;Charging goes a very long time. You can shave 8-9 times.</li>
    <li> Early present of Father&#x27;s Day. Dad likes this shaver, said it is easy to use, and lives no shadow on the face.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned this razor for about a month now and I have to say I absolutely love it!  I used to stay away from electric razors because of how badly they irritated my skin, especially around my mouth and all over my neck.  I do not have those problems with this razor at all.  I&#x27;ve used it wet and dry and I have to say that both ways leave my skin feeling good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shave quality is pretty dang good, if you shave every day.  If you don&#x27;t shave for a few days more passes on certain areas are necessary.  That being said I usually shave every day and when I do this razor provides a shave equal to most of the traditional razors I&#x27;ve used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also of note for anyone with sensitive skin use an aftershave balm that is alcohol free!  A lot of cheaper after shaves have alcohol in them and that will cause irritation no matter how good of a razor you use.  I received some lavender aftershave balm from the Art of Shaving, it is crazy expensive but it is a good place to start looking.  The key is to get alcohol free!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The battery life is pretty good as well, I charge it once a week and have had no problems with the battery or charging cable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I have any problems with the razor I will be sure to update the review here!</li>
    <li> I have only bought 3 electric razors prior...all panasonic so I don&#x27;t have much base for comparison.  The 4 blade definitely shaves cleaner and quicker.  The head pivots in all directions but you can also lock it in one position if you want.  However like all the other panasonics, the display breaks down after a few months and I can no longer monitor the battery life.  I would buy again if the price was right.</li>
    <li> After a month, I really like this shaver.  I really liked my old Braun, too, but after 6 or 7 years it got noiser, started to choke on whiskers as the little hole in the drive unit wore larger(where the pin from the blade fits into).  I nearly bought another Braun, a Pulsonic, but after reading the reviews on Amazon, and realizing that this was a lot cheaper and I could quit the monthly alcohol-cartridge subscription, I gave it a try.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s great!  Smooth, quiet, cleans easily with liquid soap and water every few days, no $$ for cartridges.  Best of all, my wife can sleep in an extra hour without having the intermittent BUZZZ going off periodically, like the Braun used to do during it&#x27;s cleaning cycle.</li>
    <li> Gave to my son as a birthday gift.  He has a heavy beard and has stated that it works best in the shower.  He loves this item.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m sure this would have been just great but I ordered the wrong model number.  The return was easy and I will reorder the correct one once my credit goes through.</li>
    <li> I grew up with Brauns and the occasional Norelco/Philips. I came across Panasonic wet shavers about a decade ago. I have no interest in looking elsewhere. And don&#x27;t bother getting models with the separate cleaning apparatus. You don&#x27;t need it.</li>
    <li> Easy to use. Solid quality. I bought one 18 months ago. Just replaced the blades. Liked enough to buy another for a second home</li>
    <li> item is as described, it&#x27;s quality made, so far it&#x27;s holding fine and looks like it will last for some time.</li>
    <li> Efficient machine at very reasonable price.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend to buy it online since you make good savings vs shop price</li>
    <li> This replaced an older Panasonic, so I thought I knew what to expect.  Was I ever wrong!  I&#x27;ve used every conceivable type of razor, and this is the best.  Every beard is different, but after shaving, I have no sense of having just shaved.  This has a much bigger head than my old razor, but it&#x27;s much faster; it even shaves the bottom of my neck like a champ.  I don&#x27;t have any trouble holding or using it.  Two thumbs up, WAY up!</li>
    <li> This machine gives a great shave in the shower. The battery however performs poorly so the the razor needs to be recharged after three shaves on average. I had the same issue with my previous one and I had hoped a newer model would have corrected this problem but it did not.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only had this a month and it has performed perfectly.  You get a good, close shave either wet or dry with no pulling.  This unit moves up and down vertically or back and forth horizontally on a gimbal system.  Cleaning is easy and the readout is very good.  Also the battery life is excellent so far.  I haven&#x27;t had to recharge yet.  The price for this electric shaver is $300 on their website so Amazon affords a very good deal.</li>
    <li> I really like this and for the amount of money I had to pay it shaved as I was expecting it to.  It gets a real close shave like I want and I like how I can rinse it off in the sink.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great product: well built and produced in Japan.  Plenty of power and very responsive shaver.  It didn&#x27;t break my skin and works well with or w/o water.</li>
    <li> I read the reviews and this one got great reviews.  I&#x27;ve got a very light beard and some stragglers here and there.  This thing takes care of everything in 1-2 passes.  I couldn&#x27;t be happier with it.  The battery lasts forever, and I can do a full shave in less than 30 seconds.  Fantastic!</li>
    <li> If I could give this zero stars I would.  I purchased this yesterday.  Got it today.  spent 10 minutes running it up and down my neck. my neck is still covered in hair and now my neck is bleeding.  You can see this in the attached pictures.  It couldn&#x27;t cut ANY HAIR.  I don&#x27;t know if this product was defective or it is simply garbage but I am INCREDIBLY unsatisfied.  I am returning it immediately and will never be buying another panasonic razor.  Guess its back to the blades.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned a number of shavers. This is definitely my favorite. So solid and smooth. Comfortable shave every time. No pulling, no burns after. Love it.</li>
    <li> I bought this product for my father, and he said it is the best razor he ever had.</li>
    <li> nice shaver but a little noisy</li>
    <li> Shaver requires far too many passes, gets hot fairly quickly even if you don&#x27;t press hard. Massive head removes the possibility for any type of precise cutting, and also blocks your view when using the pop-up trimmer.  Annoying, loud, buzzing sound(more so than previous razors), cannot be used while charging, and it just doesn&#x27;t cut very close.  Oh and I almost forgot, if you have a fair amount of facial hair (2-3 days worth) it will periodically dump a bunch of hair onto you, basically making a shower afterwards mandatory.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only things I like about it is that it technically does work, so I&#x27;ll be able to physically shave until I get a new one, the battery life window is pretty cool, easy to clean, and it has pretty good battery life in general.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was my first razor of this style and I won&#x27;t be getting another, it&#x27;s a shame that I didn&#x27;t give up on it sooner as I cannot return it now, and it was far from cheap.</li>
    <li> My manual razors have been costing a lot of money to replace.  I asked for this for my birthday and it works pretty good. I use it wet with shaving cream and get most of the hair shaved off.  Then I use a manual razor for the finishing work. This will make my razors last a lot longer since I am not using them as much, just to get everything smooth. The BEST part about this method is that the panasonic with shaving cream does NOT hurt!  When you use a manual razor after 2 days of not shaving, there is irritation and pain and it hurts to shave.  Now I use the panasonic and it does not hurt.. then when I use the manual razor it does not hurt because there is hardly anything left to shave.  With the wet method I do not get a very close shave.  There are still problem stops.  I have not tested this razor dry. The razor works quickly and I can do the initial shave in about 2 minutes. It comes with a carrying case and it holds a charge for a long time.  It charges fairly quickly as well. Cleans out with water in the sink and I let it air dry for a few hours.  Easy to Clean, Works Well. Recommended</li>
    <li> Excellent product  ....need one  ?  buy this one</li>
    <li> This thing is pretty good.  Runs as well in the shower as dry.  It seems to me that electric takes longer than using a saftey razor, which I think I&#x27;m going back to for my face, but for my head this thing is pretty good.  I just have to use it every day or there are little strays.</li>
    <li> Great shaver.  When you use it as a wet shaver - it&#x27;s fantastic.  Very happy with purchase</li>
    <li> I bought this razor for my boyfriend, who has tried many other electric razors in his lifetime. This was by far the best one he&#x27;s ever had!</li>
    <li> Boy am I glad I bought a Panasonic razor!  Two years ago I bought a Panasonic ES8243 razor.  In a few months the LED began going out.  Then it stopped running all together.  I liked the way it shaved so much, even though it malfunctioned, I purchased a new ES8243A, which is noticeably better than the ES8243.  Quieter and closer, if that&#x27;s possible, every bit as close as a five bladed Gillette.  Then I decided to call Panasonic and tell them my first razor quit and that I had purchased a new one, but wondered what I could do about the old one.  They said send the broken one in and we&#x27;ll send you a new one with no charge.  Well, I just received the new one today, and it&#x27;s a brand new model ES-LA63-S, two steps up from the ES8243A.  I am so pleased with Panasonic!</li>
    <li> I was in the market for a new electric razor after my Braun just stopped working. I didn&#x27;t want another Braun for a few reasons. The cleaning system is a sham. You have to buy refills of the liquid and it doesn&#x27;t adequately clean the razor. The cleaning system itself also gets very dirty and almost impossible to clean. The shave quality was good but there are other razors out there that provide the same shave quality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I settled on the Panasonic and am extremely happy with it. It gave me a close shave almost immediately even though the instructions said it may take up to 30 days. What I really like is how low maintenance it is. It is extremely easy to clean. Just put some liquid hand soap on the top while its running and it cleans it very well. You can easily take off the blade and see that it&#x27;s very clean after washing. Very easy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only possible negative is that the razor head is large and it gets a little awkward shaving the upper lip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regardless I highly recommend this razor for anyone looking for a reliable product and doesn&#x27;t want to break the bank.</li>
    <li> I already  have owned  2 blade panasonic. But this one is awesome, less noise and great shave. Looks bulky though , but its light and easy to handle. I love the way it swirls</li>
    <li> For decades I have been under the illusion that only rotary shavers do not pinch you or cause nick while shaving.  \\&quot;Foil\\&quot; shavers were just going to be a lot of grief.  Then my rotary shaver just wasn&#x27;t satisfying me anymore so I decided to give Panasonic ES-LA63-S a chance.  The reviews I read on Amazon were just too persuasive!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From the beginning, I had no \\&quot;break in\\&quot; period.  I did not need a month to see the close shaves I was getting even without water and shaving cream.  However, I have used the shaver wet and my face seems to be as smooth as it would be when I did a blade shave.  Another important thing I realized was with my rotary shaver, I had quite a job to remove the revolving blades and the seat they were placed in to clean them and then to use alcohol and oil to get them back into fighting trim.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Panasonic is a breeze to clean.  I mean quick.  They have a nice printed instruction sheet with pictures that emphasize that point.  Yes, the sideburn cutter takes some getting use to, but I feel that with a little practice I will have no problem in trimming my sideburns and moustache.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Someone remarked that they wished that the case for the Panasonic shaver had room for accessories.  I have a small bag for traveling that easily takes my shaver in its case and my accessory charger.  The shaver&#x27;s case is so close around the shaver that it easily fits in my travel case, no problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From a rotary shaver user who finally has had his eyes opened to greater convenience and faster shaves.</li>
    <li> I replaced a one year old Norelco SensaTouch because it just would not remove the hair in the hard to shave spots.  I just love this Panasonic.  The head swivels in two dimensions, it works and gets all the hairs and it even has an plasma readout to tell me when to recharge it.  The 4-blade is likely the better model compared with the 3-blade but I bought the middle of the line due to cost.  I am most pleased and would recommend this unit as a superior design that has been developed to do what is was made to do, shave the face.</li>
    <li> Though the write ups don&#x27;t mention this being for a woman, I bought this for my wife and she loves it.  Using it dry is far superior to using a razor and she can use it anywhere she wants to with out mess.  It is very convenient and portable.</li>
    <li> Okay, I&#x27;ve had this razor for a little over a year now.  As long as you keep a relatively new foil on the razor, it gives a GREAT shave.  BUT, and this is the reason I did not give it five stars, you need to replace the foil every 5-6 months and, as another buyer has commented, this can get pretty expensive.  Because I can afford it, I can live with it, but it is a nusiance.</li>
    <li> Wished I had bought one sooner, great shave and easy in or out of shower.  Pricey and for the outcome it is worth it, but if it holds up like my last one it will be a great ROI.  Still use a razor every now and again but for the most part its all Panasonic 4 blade on days when I need to shave or touch up.  Easier to clean and keeps a charge a LLLLLOOONNNNGGGG time.</li>
    <li> This shaver works well for 1-day stubble. It takes a bit more effort for 2-day stubble. But it&#x27;s really not suited for 3 or more days. At that point you&#x27;re better off using a razor.</li>
    <li> Purchased as a gift for a friend.  Feedback is comfortable to hold and easy to use.  Recharging time is very quick and charge lasts through several shavings.  Being designed for wet or dry use is not only convenient but also saves damaging internal parts when getting it wet.  Doesn&#x27;t shave as close as a his razor but faster and very convenient for on the go shaves.</li>
    <li> Good product.  Arrived on time in perfect condition.  I have had shavers before and realize it is not the same as a razor.  This can be taken in the shower and is really easy to clean...which I like.</li>
    <li> Excellent electric shaver for your face but not as close shave for your neck.  Easy to clean just using tap water.</li>
    <li> Close shave whet or dry charge lasts a long long time love it I highly recommend it to any one looking for a high quality shaver well worth the price</li>
    <li> I have always been going back and forth with electric shavers. My skin is pretty sensitive, the last shaver I bought a Remington just completely tore my face up. If I shaved within a day or two of my last session my face was very bumpy and irritated, This shaver has been a godsend. I had a pretty expensive Braun before the Remington that worked ok but because of the discomfort I got from shaving I usually avoided shaving for as long as I could. Usually only once a week. The thing that always messed with me was shaving my neck. I always need quite a few passes to get all the hair and this ends up irritating my neck really bad. This shaver is so comfy that even though I have to make the multiple passes my face is still in pretty good shape. I have not tried a wet shave yet but will soon. Even just using this unit dry and having to make a lot of passes my face is still not that irritated. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> It has been so long since I have ever purchased a new electric razor that I did not realize just how far the technology in them has come.  Traditionally, I have used primarily a straight razor with an electric razor as a backup.  This electric razor provides such a smooth, close shave, that it is now my primary razor.  On the advice I picked up from other reviews, I also purchased Shave Secret Shaving Oil, which I believe helps lubricate the skin along with plenty of hot water.  Admittedly, I have not tried the competitive products,  but I still believe this is the best electric shaver in its class for the money.</li>
    <li> Great product and seller</li>
    <li> Replaced another brand of foil shaver with this one - working very well and seems to be well-built.  Shaves are close.</li>
    <li> Great razor. Gets really close and also shave my head with it.  No bumps afterwards either.</li>
    <li> So far I love this, kinda sick of the blade, and it works very well.</li>
    <li> It has a very strong power.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27; better than Philips for shaving but sometimes felt uncomfortable feeling for shaving.</li>
    <li> I have been using Braun shavers for at least the past 25 years and have been reasonably satisfied.  That is until a friend recently bought this Panasonic and told me how much he liked it.  My latest Braun was ready for some replacement parts, so I figured I&#x27;d give this a try.  It is unbelievable how much better a shave I get with the Panasonic than with a Braun.  Not only is it a closer shave, it cut my shaving time at least in half due to the larger head that just takes a few passes to get the job done.  I can honestly say that I look forward to shaving every morning !</li>
    <li> The razor is great.  Very smooth shave, much quieter than what we used before. Easy to clean.</li>
    <li> I bought it as a gift to my husband who like it very much! He looks younger than before because it could shave cleaner than others.</li>
    <li> I grew up in my teens, 20s, and 30s using the Norelco razors with the three spinning dealies, but switched to a Panasonic foil system maybe 5-7 years ago after comparing various models.  I’ve been using the Panasonic ARC 3 ES8103S during this period, until the battery would only last for 3-4 shaves.  It took about 5-6 minutes to get a full shave, and shaved well, except for the neck area, which seems to be a common complaint across the board with electric razors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did a lot of research this round, and this Panasonic ES-LA63-S Nanotech 4-Blade (Arc 4) seemed to be the best overall option:  high reviews, decently priced, no ridiculous cleaning system… but most important, higher RPMs and an extra blade or two than the model I had before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I turned it on it was very very quiet compaired to my previous razor, so I thought it would give a wimpy shave.  NOT TRUE!  It gives the closest shave compaired with any razor I’ve ever used – probably pretty darn close to a real blade, and no bleeding on my neck like a real blade!  Quite and very quick – my shave time went from apprx 6 to approx. 4 minutes!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> Excellent shaver, probably as close to and equal to a blade as you can get. Easy clean, cannot see the point of the extra cleaning systems.  Needs charging more than my previous shaver but works 10 times as hard!  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Multi-screen shaver provides a close shave (for an electric shaver), and very quiet. This is my 3rd Panasonic electric shaver and the best one I&#x27;ve owned, yet! However the head is a bit large.</li>
    <li> I bought the razor for my husband.  He seems to like it and feels it gives him a closer&lt;br /&gt;shave than his Norelco.  I use it periodically on my legs.  We both like that the razor&lt;br /&gt;can be used in the shower.  It is easy to clean.&lt;br /&gt;My husband does miss the cleaning brush he had with his Norelco.  I would have&lt;br /&gt;liked a more compact razor.</li>
    <li> Hi there. this is a great shaver but I have a question if someone can help me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Is it normal for the razor blade or shaver head to get hot when having a dry shave?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just bought a new one and it gets very warm. not the handle. im just talking about the blades</li>
    <li> I returned a Skull Shaver and am still awaiting a refund back on that, but this Panasonic did what the other shaver couldn&#x27;t.  It shaves my bald head.  The other one took so much work going over the same spots to get a clean shave, and was difficult to clean.  But this shaver makes quick work of the stubble to get a decently clean dry shave, and takes me about 7 minutes to shave my head.  Then it&#x27;s easy to either rinse it in the water or even easier imho to clean it out with the included brush.  I deducted one star because sometimes when I&#x27;m tapping the top piece in the sink to clean the screen, the screen falls out too easily.  It&#x27;s also too easy to accidentally hit the power button while shaving, so a switch might have been better.  I get about 5 shaves per charge.</li>
    <li> First time I shaved with this thing, it was a disaster. It was a rough shave and some bleeding.    Second time was better, but not perfect. The more I shaved the better the shaves got. I guess my skin had to get used to it.    Now it&#x27;s pretty much the same as a regular blade shaver but with less irritation.    I recommend washing your face with plain water and drying it with a towel, I found my facial hair stand out more that way, making it easier for the shaver and getting a close shave.</li>
    <li> It;s ok but not as good a shave as I have had with a razor.</li>
    <li> First electric shaver that gives a close shave all over the face! The previous Panasonic one had issues in the neck area.</li>
    <li> better than any weedeater i had before</li>
    <li> Just keeps on working great.  I recommend it.  Replacement blade and head is too expensive though.</li>
    <li> expected it to be better than the previous model I have (Arc4 E8243) but found it more irritating and no closer. I sent back as not better but on its own a fine shaver</li>
    <li> This shaver works great.&lt;br /&gt;Does not pull hair or clip you.&lt;br /&gt;I have tried many different shavers over the years.&lt;br /&gt;So far, this one was the best.</li>
    <li> Where has the Panasonic razor been my whole life.  It works really well and yes it is waterproof and yes you can really use shaving cream.  Nice close shave, not as close as a non-electric razor but very close.  Beats my Braun with no problem, much more gentle on the skin than my Wahl.  I am really happy with this Panasonic razor.  I shave in under 2 minutes and I have a thick beard.  Even if I do not shave every day the razor still works.  The battery lasts about 8 shaves for me and then charges in no time.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a replacement for my Remmgtn MS900, But this is even better...I highly recommend it!!</li>
    <li> Love this shaver. Gives a close shave.  I&#x27;ve been a loyal Panasonic use for 10 years now.</li>
    <li> Great shaver.  Very close and recharge is fast.</li>
    <li> What can I say which hasn&#x27;t been said already. Great shaver, does take a month to get used to the cutting process, but ultra powerful head cuts the whiskers away nicely. From my point of view, worth the money paid. Go for it.</li>
    <li> The shaving head on this product is huge compared to my last razor.  It takes some getting used to.  The shave is ok but upper lip access is limited.</li>
    <li> Excellent and well worth the price</li>
    <li> Very comfortable to use vs the Braun.Easier to shave under the chin. The best part about this shaver is how quick you can clean it. Just run it under water is all I do.</li>
    <li> This product lives up to the great reviews I read about it. It works great without irritation (in my experience at least). It is easy to clean and also charges rather quickly. I am very pleased with the value!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried several shavers from the cheapest to the top-of-the-line. This is the bottom line about this one (and all the other ones): You will spend AT LEAST twice as much time getting a similar shave to a razor blade. There is no going around it. You will NEVER get as close of a shave as you would get with a razor blade. One exception: if you have REALLY REALLY thick and fast-growing hair - then this may be of use to you and you may get close shaves. Otherwise, be prepared to spend 15-20 minutes and get decent shaves, but not super smooth ones.</li>
    <li> I started shaving my head with an electric shaver 4 years ago with the Panasonic wet/dry ES8077 vortex.  I loved my ES8077 and it worked well for me.  It had a cleaning system with it and I used that for awhile but then I got sick of buying the cleaning cartridges for it so then I just used hand soap on it and let it air dried which was very easy to do.  Anyway last Friday one of the two motors died on me so I needed another shaver fast.  I had my eye on the arc 5 but no way I was going to pay the $300+ for it.  I also was looking at the black model of this ES-LA63 shaver with the cleaning system but since I stopped using the cleaning system on my ES8077 then I decided to just pay $60 less and get this gray model without the cleaning system for $120.  Well, I got it in the mail last Wednesday and needed a good head shave for thanksgiving and it didn&#x27;t let me down.  Don&#x27;t let the arc 4 completely fool you though as there is really only two main blades and then there are two smaller ones it seems built into the foil, but it did the trick on my head anyway.  I also like the percentage of battery left indicator on the lcd screen as well.  Also, it was very quiet compared to my old ES8077 which was a very pleasant surprise.  I will only use this shaver on my head in the shower like my last one so I can&#x27;t really comment on shaving my face with it as I have a normal norelco for that.  Hopefully I don&#x27;t have any problems with this and it lasts me 4+ years at least.  I plan on replacing the blades and foil once a year.</li>
    <li> NOT AS GOOD As 3 rotating head shavers</li>
    <li> Great price and works great. It takes a little getting used to, but it definitely provides a nice, close, shave.</li>
    <li> Excellent shaver, dry or wet, without skin irritation.&lt;br /&gt;Plus points: shaves very closely and fast, cheaper than the top selling Brauns, easy to clean.&lt;br /&gt;Caveats: (Minor) Rather short battery duration. Can&#x27;t shave when plugged in  for recharging.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, one of the best shavers in the market.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned Panasonic shavers before. So far I&#x27;m happy with its performance. Everything works great, The on/off lock feature is helpful.</li>
    <li> I gave this as a gift to my husband after doing much research on best available in this price range and he absolutely lived it.He was using Braun series 1 before and this one is too advanced .</li>
    <li> I bought this based on reviews that it gives a smooth shave. So far it has performed as expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-Gives a shave almost as well as my 5-blade razor. The shaver gives a better shave when using shaving foam.&lt;br /&gt;-Easy to clean&lt;br /&gt;-Charge lasts a while&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- I still have to go and use my razor in some areas (i.e. corners of my jaw, where my head meets my neck)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I would recommend it to others</li>
    <li> Good product - works well wet and dry.  need to keep the angle right to get close and clean shave.  Though still looking for the perfect 5* razor that shaves clean and smooth with a single pass.</li>
    <li> This is the best shaver I have used. I am a Panasonic shaver user for years (10). I am giving 4 because the 5 blade might be the best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wonder why there is so much difference between 3 blade and 4 blade shaver. After using this one, I feel that 3 blader 8103/7103 are junk :) there is such difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend to anyone this. Bit costly though...</li>
    <li> I have to say I&#x27;m impressed,  I dislike looking unshaved but hate shaving so this shaver lets me shave every day without the hassle of a wet shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used shaving lather and used it wet for the first few days, but in less than a week I was shaving daily, dry, and with no skin rash or burn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like it.</li>
    <li> Love it........It has been years, make that decades since I used an electric razor.  Both the product and I have improved over that time.  This is a good product.  I really love using it:  No fuss no muss it just works.</li>
    <li> I have used Remington shavers for several years due to price and good performance. After extensive research and reading reviews I took a chance and spent more money on this shaver.  This shaver provides a very close dry shave that rivals my 5 blade razor shaving wet especially in around my neck where I have to make several passes with my blade razor. I do not go more than 1 day between shaving. This shaver also is fairly quiet compared to Remington.  I am now a Panasonic fan and ditched the Remington.</li>
    <li> I read a review for $3.88 Shave Secret shaving oil. I tried that with a regular blade and was so blown away that I put the Panasonic back in its box and shipped it back to Amazon.</li>
    <li> For starters, the unit did not have a 9-11 digit serial number printed on it so I could not register it with Panasonic for a warranty.  This made me wonder if it was a copy.  Considering how it performed, it might have been one.  It cut me more than my Gillette Fusion to the point where I was actually bleeding (I never bled with my Fusion).  Also, the shave was nowhere near as close!  I shaved both with Neutrogena&#x27;s Shave Lotion.</li>
    <li> It does what it is designed to do; however, it leaves a rash that is unbearable. I have been using for more than a month and the rash continues.</li>
    <li> It is one of thebest shaver I have owned, very close cut and does bald heads without having to use a razor.</li>
    <li> Not suitable for this price, not so effective</li>
    <li> For years I thought my trusty Norelco shaver was the cat&#x27;s meow. I would intersperse daily shaving with an occasional safety razor (Gillette Fusion) shave maybe three or four times a month just to remember the feel of a nice close, smooth shave. When the Norelco died after many years I sought electric shaver performance that would allow me to discontinue the use of a good safety razor. After reading both positive and negative reviews of various brands sold by Amazon I purchased the Panasonic ES-LA63-S. I frankly could not believe how close and comfortable my first voyage was with this shaver. I haven&#x27;t considered a safety razor shave since the Panasonic arrival about four months ago. This is not an inexpensive shaver; but worth every dollar in performance. The only two negatives are 1: no shaver stand and 2: the carry case could be a bit larger to accommodate both the shaver and the charger adaptor cord comfortably. I&#x27;m baffled why Panasonic didn&#x27;t include these low cost features with a classy product. Nevertheless, small potatoes once you have tried this shaver. Five stars. Enjoy!</li>
    <li> I have been a Braun user for many years. They typically lasted for years and when the razor finally did give out I would just get their latest and greatest. Point is, I&#x27;ve never had a shaving experience with another brand until now. The shave is very close. I like the fact that I can rinse the shaver after use instead of buying those alcohol cartridges about once a month.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this shaver for approximately two years. No complaints.</li>
    <li> A better performance than my old Braun 8000 series.&lt;br /&gt;It is light and feels high-tech in the comparison.&lt;br /&gt;Also it does not do majic tricks, like shawing neck (I usually end with razor-blading couple of tricky hairs there): it does the job pretty effectively and produces very smooth and &amp;#34;close&amp;#34; shaving results, especially on cheeks and mustage / around the lips areas.</li>
    <li> It works very well but is a little noisy. It is larger and more cumbersome than my previous razor but operates efficiently.</li>
    <li> Very happy with this shaver, the multi pivoting head makes it very easy to use. It&#x27;s easy to clean, and I get great results with it. I always dry shave and never get any irritation</li>
    <li> Does a great job, it&#x27;s a little noisy, but I get a very close shave. I would recommend it to a friend</li>
    <li> Almost as good as a (multiple) blade,very easy to use, minimal rash for the first week.  Cleaning and maintenance also very easy.  Significantly better than dry shaving.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using for a couple weeks now, I like it, but I&#x27;m not in love with it.  I will say, it performs substantially better than previous shavers I&#x27;ve used, and I have had both straight foil and the circular shaver for comparison.  No electric shaver that I&#x27;m aware of is capable of getting as close as a blade, but the trade off is that the stubble this shaver leaves seams a little softer, or less sharp, especially once 5 o&#x27;clock rolls around.&lt;br /&gt;The head does maintain good contact with the skin and I have to do fewer passes than I did with previous shavers, but because the head is so large, it makes actually seeing what I&#x27;m shaving, ie: sideburns, goatee, difficult to get really clean edges on.  Furthermore, the trimmer on the back of the head requires some clever angling in the mirror to see what I&#x27;m cutting.  Also, as with most, if not all shavers, the neck can be a bit tricky, requiring a few extra passes.&lt;br /&gt;Gripes aside, the battery does seem to have a fairly long life, I&#x27;ve only charged it once since I got it almost 2 weeks ago and is just approaching the point where it needs to be charged again, so 8-12 shaves on a charge is quite realistic.&lt;br /&gt;The motor is very fast, and not much louder than a sonic toothbrush.  That is to say, it&#x27;s clearly audible, but not likely to disturb anyone who isn&#x27;t an extremely light sleeper, if that&#x27;s a concern for you.  Furthermore, the vibration isn&#x27;t too obtrusive and it has a system that makes it run at full speed at all times rather than slowly fizzling out and pulling rather than just cutting.  The electronic display is kind of nice too.&lt;br /&gt;Since it is a wet/dry shaver, cleaning is super easy, and makes the other models with the cleaning station seam a little unnecessary.  The one caveat I would mention here is that the shaver has no flat surfaces and just kind of wobbles wherever it is set down, this would be the one reason I could see getting the cleaning station, but I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s worth an extra $100+cost ofrefills.  the solution I&#x27;ve worked out is to just leave it partly out of its travel case while it&#x27;s drying.&lt;br /&gt;On the whole, I can&#x27;t give it 5 stars for the reasons I&#x27;ve mentioned, it&#x27;s not perfect, but this is not to say that this is a much better shaver than many on the market, and the build quality and design do justify the cost, and I would still recommend this shaver.</li>
    <li> I needed to upgrade my razor after my old one started to get too old.  This has been a good razor so far.  With all the technology and layers of razors put into it I was a bit surprised that some hairs on my face still struggle to get shaven off.  I&#x27;m not blown away by the quality of the shave, but it effectively gets the job done.  The only other annoying thing is that you can&#x27;t turn the razor on to shave while its plugged in and charging.  So make sure enough of the battery is charged first if you need to use it.</li>
