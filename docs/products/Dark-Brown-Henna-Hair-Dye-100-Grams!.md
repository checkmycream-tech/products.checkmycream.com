      <li>Thanks for a great product!</li>
      <li>Use warm tap water for the henna.</li>
      <li>Let me begin this review by stating that I have been using Egyptian, Indian and Pakistani 100% henna for over 30 years with beautiful results that lasted a full 3 months.  </li>
      <li>I followed all directions, and even ordered 2 shades darker then my own hair.    </li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product and I can&#x27;t wait to order more!!!  </li>
      <li>so I&#x27;m pretty happy with the results.</li>
      <li>It covered up most of the chemical dye that I was trying to cover up</li>
      <li>it dye your hair ok?</li>
      <li>She (we) could not ask for a better product.</li>
      <li>The directions on most products say that a skin test should show any problems within 24 hrs.</li>
      <li>However the results are soooooooooo much better then chemical dyes.  </li>
      <li>However when I shampooed my hair after 24 hours my hair had more of a shine to it.</li>
      <li>yay!! :)</li>
      <li>I love this product as it gave me the color I wanted</li>
      <li>I really love how convenient this hair dye is and the fact that it doesn&#x27;t burn my scalp at all though.</li>
      <li>If I let it go 2 weeks, my beard is mostly gray again.</li>
      <li>After more than 6 months, I still have 1/3 of the package.</li>
      <li>It went on ok</li>
      <li>Color couldn&#x27;t be better, IMHO.</li>
      <li>In between colorings, I LOVE their Aloe Vera shampoo and conditioner as well.</li>
      <li>but they have made the henna work a lot better for me.</li>
      <li>Based on my experience, I&#x27;d have to say this would probably work better</li>
      <li>I am thinking about getting more to try again and leave it on longer.</li>
      <li>I did a bit of research, by the way, and learned that most henna/indigo distributors, unlike Harvest Moon, suggest mixing up the henna and indigo powders SEPARATELY and then combining.  </li>
      <li>I research more and found some important instructions  1.</li>
      <li>I followed the directions exactly on the package and could not have been more thrilled with how my hair looks.  </li>
      <li>Super easy!</li>
      <li>It was so easy to use</li>
      <li>Now it&#x27;s rougher, drier, and easily tangles and breaks.</li>
      <li>It cleans up easily with water.    </li>
      <li>I have fine hair</li>
      <li>I must wash my hair lightly after using henna or my scalp gets irritated.  </li>
      <li>I experienced the same severe reaction.</li>
      <li>I had to lather, rinse 3 times before my hair felt clean, then I had to apply a conditioner and let it sit for 5 mins to get the hair to feel tangle free.     </li>
      <li>The directions say to apply the product to clean hair, just after it dries after being washed.</li>
      <li>It feels great after years of dry, stretchy, almost barbie-like hair.</li>
      <li>to a nice, natural, rich brown.</li>
      <li>I needed to do what I used to do, and leave the whole thing on for another hour or more, or I needed to mix the henna portion sooner and let it sit.  </li>
      <li>I really want to love this product</li>
      <li>About 2 years ago, I found Henna Hut&#x27;s products and absolutely fell in love.</li>
      <li>and she woke with beautiful dark brown hair!</li>
      <li>My hair is usually very fine and soft.  </li>
      <li>This is a great henna for your hair - my hair is grey and it covers very well -</li>
      <li>with more white hair popping out - it&#x27;s easy to cover up and &amp;#34;pretend&amp;#34; I have highlights.  </li>
      <li>But since it doesn&#x27;t harm hair, its still worth it for me to dye once</li>
      <li>After all the damage that chemical hair dye did to my hair, I decided to try something more natural.</li>
      <li>Unlike chemical dye, the henna hair dye leaves my hair silky soft and in better condition than what I started out with.</li>
      <li>It does dye my hair great but my old Blonde highlights are coming through</li>
      <li>My hair feels soft and healthy too.</li>
      <li>I blow dye it right after patting with a towel  6.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve looked at several other Henna hair dyes, and this one is certainly the best bang for your buck.</li>
      <li>Now I have an overall color that is beautiful, dark and very close to my original.  </li>
      <li>One application will remove about 70% of the gray, and two more applications over the next two days will remove all of it.</li>
      <li>Since I did not feel this after the first couple of uses, in view of my experiences, it may of been in my head.</li>
      <li>If you follow the directions they would have known this and more than likely felt like an A</li>
      <li>I have used this product for exactly one year.  </li>
      <li>The first 2 times I used it</li>
      <li>I repeated the process two more times over the next week, and I see no difference in my gray hair color.  </li>
      <li>I do not need to dye the hair on my head yet, but when I do, this will be my first choice.</li>
      <li>The good news is that this combination beautifully toned down the red from all my prior years of using henna only.  </li>
      <li>Henna Hut had a lot of positive comments and seemed to carry a quality product.  </li>
      <li>I was very nervous about trying henna for the first time, but my damaged hair needed a change.  </li>
      <li>I used very warm water, mixed the appropriate amounts of henna and indigo together, applied to my hair, left it on for about an hour and a half, and rinsed out.  </li>
      <li>Usually the really cheap $1 shampoos don&#x27;t that that ingredient (save money :))  </li>
      <li>I wish I tried this product sooner, because not only was the color AMAZING, but it left my hair silky and shiny like never before.  </li>
      <li>Also use as much henna as you can  </li>
      <li>if this really makes a difference</li>
      <li>but my hair seems much bouncier and thicker when I use the whole package)  4.</li>
      <li>I followed the directions, and left the gel in for a full hour.  </li>
      <li>I not only followed the instructions to the letter, but had several exchanges with the seller to make sure what I was doing was correct.  </li>
      <li>It was a bit hard to use at first, but was better after I got used to the mushy texture.</li>
      <li>I decided to try this product because I wanted a change from all the red highlights and thought it would be nice to tone down to a browner hue.  </li>
      <li>Others I&#x27;ve looked at retail for $36 and are much more complicated to use than this one.&lt;br /&gt;I followed the instructions exactly and found it was such and easy process.</li>
      <li>About 8 months ago I bought a new package.</li>
      <li>I have two more packages of henna and 4 more packages of indigo that I&#x27;m now afraid to use.  </li>
      <li>Washed my hair twice with a clarifying shampoo, towel dried my hair, mixed the henna powder with warm water and applied.</li>
      <li>I have two more packages of henna and 4 more packages of indigo that I&#x27;m now afraid to use.  </li>
      <li>it looks very, very natural.  </li>
      <li>It will help processing for vivid shine and color.</li>
      <li>My stylist recommended we try this since it was all natural and would not hurt the new hair growth.    </li>
      <li>I did a lot of research to find a new henna provider after my old one stopped carrying it.  </li>
      <li>B0013ZGQNG RefectoCil Cream Hair Dye (NATURAL BROWN) .5oz]].    </li>
      <li>So if you plan on keeping it until it grows out go for it but for those that change their minds frequently beware.</li>
      <li>I am ordering directly from hennahut.com from now on.</li>
      <li>I was surprised by the smell of the henna.</li>
      <li>Then my boyfriend persuaded me to grow out my natural color</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have used this product for exactly one year.  I love the beautiful color and thus didn&#x27;t notice the downside.  My hair texture has changed drastically over the past year.  It&#x27;s so obvious now that I can see the older hair which has lost its natural curliness, and has become so delicate that it snaps and breaks at the slightest tug.  Today is 28 March 2011.  My hair is now half the length it was in March 2010.  I had high hopes for this product, but am now very disappointed.  I&#x27;m off to get a hair cut.  In the future, I hope to find a henna hair dye that is reliable, and as natural as the producers claim.</li>
    <li> For years I used \\&quot;Just for Men\\&quot; on my beard and moustache. About 8 months ago I bought a new package. The product caused such severe irritation and chemical burns that I nearly ended up in the Emergency room. In the stores in my area, I found nothing but \\&quot;Just for Men\\&quot; for sale, so I turned to Amazon and ordered [[ASIN:B0013ZGQNG RefectoCil Cream Hair Dye (NATURAL BROWN) .5oz]].    See my review of that product. I experienced the same severe reaction. I did some internet research and discovered that this is a major problem. It appears that the U.S. Government has banned the metal based dyes that had been used, forcing the manufacurors to change their formulas. The culprit is Phenylenediamine, or PPD. Nearly all current mens hair care products now use it. All across the Country, men are ending up in Drs. offices or emergency rooms, sometimes permanently scarred. Class Action Lawsuits are pending.    There is a sizable minority of men who are sensitive to PPD, so be very careful to do a skin test with any hair care dye product, EVEN IF YOU HAVE USED THE PRODUCT BEFORE, since they are changeing the formulas. The directions on most products say that a skin test should show any problems within 24 hrs. With the RefectoCil cream I did not have a reaction for over 40 hrs, but it was so severe I almost ended up in the Hospital.    Now on to the current product. It is not as convenient to use as the pre PPD \\&quot;Just for Men\\&quot;, but it works, and I have had no reactions to it. I am 54, with a full head of hair, and only a slight dusting of gray at my temples. My beard, however, is about 3/4 gray. I normally wear a moustache and goat-T, trimmed short. The product comes as a green powder that looks and smells like herbal tea. I use a rounded teaspoon mixed with a little water to make a paste about the consistency of yogurt. I use a plastic tea spoon to measure, mix, and apply it.    The first time I applied the product, I felt a slight burning sensation. Not enough to be a problem. Since I did not feel this after the first couple of uses, in view of my experiences, it may of been in my head. The directions say to apply the product to clean hair, just after it dries after being washed. I apply it about 15 mins. after showering, let it sit on me for about 45 mins, and then get in the shower again just to rinse it off. The mixed product is a green, herbal smelling glop. It has no smell after it is rinsed off. It does not stain the bath tub or anything in the shower. It does not stain skin, or drip or run if mixed properly. After rinsing, it does not stain clothes or bedding. It cleans up easily with water.    I wouldn&#x27;t want to get it on clothes, and I have never had that happen. I imagine that it would be a lot more messy for long womens hair, but that is not an issue with my beard. It doesn&#x27;t pay to be stingy with the product, because if you do not completly cover the hairs, the ends will not dye properly. Since the product is inexpensive, this shouldn&#x27;t be an issue. One application will remove about 70% of the gray, and two more applications over the next two days will remove all of it. I find this to be a good thing, because it allows me to control the amount of gray removed. I don&#x27;t want to remove all gray, I want to match my temples and head, looking natual.    When first applied, the gray hairs have a green tint, which fades away over the space of a few hrs. to a nice, natural, rich brown. Color couldn&#x27;t be better, IMHO. For maintenence, I trim my beard and apply the product once a week. After 7 days, the gray starts to become visible. If I let it go 2 weeks, my beard is mostly gray again. After more than 6 months, I still have 1/3 of the package. I do not need to dye the hair on my head yet, but when I do, this will be my first choice.</li>
    <li> Let me begin this review by stating that I have been using Egyptian, Indian and Pakistani 100% henna for over 30 years with beautiful results that lasted a full 3 months.  I decided to try this product because I wanted a change from all the red highlights and thought it would be nice to tone down to a browner hue.  I not only followed the instructions to the letter, but had several exchanges with the seller to make sure what I was doing was correct.  The good news is that this combination beautifully toned down the red from all my prior years of using henna only.  The bad news is that NOT ONE gray hair (I&#x27;m dark brown with about 15% gray) gave up being gray! So in addition to the hassle, mess and expense of doing this treatment (and make no mistake - it&#x27;s messy and time consuming) I will have to double up this month and do my regular henna only routine.  I did a bit of research, by the way, and learned that most henna/indigo distributors, unlike Harvest Moon, suggest mixing up the henna and indigo powders SEPARATELY and then combining.  Based on my experience, I&#x27;d have to say this would probably work better (the rationale probably being the same as why combining shampoo and conditioner together don&#x27;t work as well as shampooing and THEN conditioning).  Likewise, everyone else except Harvest Moon recommends wrapping the hair in plastic wrap and then covering with a shower cap and leaving on for a MINIMUM of 2 hours (Harvest Moon says their product works in less than one hour and is against wrapping.)  Leaves me to wonder if the gray hairs would not be gray had I followed the advice of the other henna/indigo distributors.  Here&#x27;s a good reference website:  [...]</li>
    <li> I followed the directions exactly on the package and could not have been more thrilled with how my hair looks.  I had colored it red some time ago with a harsh chemical dye and the ends were completely faded.  Now I have an overall color that is beautiful, dark and very close to my original.  I will definitely order again.  It was so easy to use and I saved money in the process.  Thanks for a great product!</li>
    <li> If you use this color it looks beautiful but do not try to lift it out!!! Bleach just turns it blue. So if you plan on keeping it until it grows out go for it but for those that change their minds frequently beware.</li>
    <li> The Henna was like green mud, when mixed up.  Very Messy and had a stong smell to it. It went on ok but when it was washed out my hair was the same color and the gray was not covered, which is the reason I bought it. However when I shampooed my hair after 24 hours my hair had more of a shine to it.</li>
    <li> I used this henna and followed the instructions literally.. I only put it 1 hour and 15 minutes long on my hair then rinsed it. My hair got darker, it turned dark brown without any rednees in it. I love this product as it gave me the color I wanted and I felt my hair healthier.</li>
    <li> I am allergic to hair dye so I had to purchase Henna. It does dye my hair great but my old Blonde highlights are coming through and it&#x27;s only been a month. But since it doesn&#x27;t harm hair, its still worth it for me to dye once a month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The biggest negative is the smell. It smells like cigarettes and you aren&#x27;t supposed to wash it for 24 hrs.</li>
    <li> I followed the directions, and left the gel in for a full hour.  I repeated the process two more times over the next week, and I see no difference in my gray hair color.  Of course, your mileage may vary, but this product did not work at all for me.</li>
    <li> A word of caution about this product.  I got it today and the label is completely different of what shows here.  It doesn&#x27;t say Harvest Moon anywhere, even the website showed in the product  is [...].  The picture they show in the amazon website is misleading, it says Harvest Moon and the package looks identical to the one I ordered 6 months ago.  The product I got today doesn&#x27;t look anything like that, It is blue, it doesn&#x27;t say Harvest Moon anywhere, it seems like a complete different company.  I thought the henna guys where the business in charge of the shipping and handling and the product was still produced by The Henna Hut, but it&#x27;s not.  I am ordering directly from hennahut.com from now on.</li>
    <li> I have dark brown hair with some gray.  Followed the instructions to the letter.  My gray hairs are now blue.  This product is a blend of henna and indigo with some other herbals.  The henna dye apparently takes longer to activate than the indigo so by applying the mixture as soon as it is mixed with water, the indigo is the only dye that affixed to my hair.</li>
    <li> I was surprised by the smell of the henna. From what I have read I was expecting something horrible, but it was really more grassy (almost like matcha), so I really enjoyed the smell. It was a bit hard to use at first, but was better after I got used to the mushy texture. Clean up wasn&#x27;t that bad after either. It covered up most of the chemical dye that I was trying to cover up so I&#x27;m pretty happy with the results.</li>
    <li> This is a great henna for your hair - my hair is grey and it covers very well - it looks very, very natural.  My hair is short and thin so I can do it myself.  However, if your hair is medium, long, or thick I would suggest you get some help.  Also if you have never had a henna please know, it is a gritty, sand like thick paste which is not really easy to apply and it should stay on your hair for at least an hour and a half.  However the results are soooooooooo much better then chemical dyes.  Your hair is soft and very manageable and the henna last as long as any permanent color.</li>
    <li> I read a lot of the reviews on this item before buying it. I&#x27;ve looked at several other Henna hair dyes, and this one is certainly the best bang for your buck. Others I&#x27;ve looked at retail for $36 and are much more complicated to use than this one.&lt;br /&gt;I followed the instructions exactly and found it was such and easy process. Washed my hair twice with a clarifying shampoo, towel dried my hair, mixed the henna powder with warm water and applied. Although it said to leave the product on for 1 hour, I left mine on for 2 since I have blonde roots. Surprisingly, it covered my roots great and I have consistant color all over.&lt;br /&gt;The smell might be off-putting to some users, although I regularly use a henna based shampoo, so I am used the the grassy/dirt odor it has. I follow up with a mixture of 4 parts water, 1 part apple cider vinegar, and a few drops of lavendar EO, which leaves hair shiny, conditioned, and smelling great!&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I would recommend this product to anyone and will continue to use it myself instead of chemical based hair dyes.</li>
    <li> I did a lot of research to find a new henna provider after my old one stopped carrying it.  Henna Hut had a lot of positive comments and seemed to carry a quality product.  I&#x27;ve been using henna/indigo on and off for years, and have always loved my results.  Usually I used a kit which had pre-combined henna and indigo for the dark brown to dark auburn shade I prefer.  Just mixed it up with hot water, allowed to sit for a few, applied, wrapped my hair in plastic and left on for 2 1/2 to 3 hours.  It covered my small amount of gray with red highlights and my hair was soft and shiny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I bought separate indigo and henna packets from Henna Hut, I followed their instructions. I used very warm water, mixed the appropriate amounts of henna and indigo together, applied to my hair, left it on for about an hour and a half, and rinsed out.  I must wash my hair lightly after using henna or my scalp gets irritated.  This has never been an issue with other henna preparations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, I got dark coloring from the indigo, but no red at all.  As a result, none of my gray went away.  The grays that usually turned into red highlights stayed gray.  The rest of my hair was nearly black.  I didn&#x27;t mind the darker color, but no gray coverage was annoying.  Then the entire texture of my hair changed.  My hair is usually very fine and soft.  Now it&#x27;s rougher, drier, and easily tangles and breaks. Even my hairdresser noticed the difference.  After doing some more research, I came to the conclusion that at least some of the problem is that henna apparently \\&quot;activates\\&quot; slower than indigo.  I needed to do what I used to do, and leave the whole thing on for another hour or more, or I needed to mix the henna portion sooner and let it sit.  Henna Hut does not tell you this.  Also, I have no idea why the indigo seems to have damaged my hair. This has never happened before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Henna Hut does not allow you to email them and ask questions.  You have to join their \\&quot;henna community\\&quot; and ask your questions in their forum.  So I explained all this there.  The \\&quot;Admin\\&quot; person simply asked what my order number was in response.  I had no idea, but I gave them my name and the bar code numbers on the backs of the henna and indigo packets.  Since then, every time I try to log on to the \\&quot;community\\&quot; my browser hangs up and I can&#x27;t access it.  I looked for my question on their forum without logging in, and it&#x27;s not there.  It&#x27;s like they don&#x27;t keep posts that look bad for them on the forum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My confidence in this company has plummeted.  I have two more packages of henna and 4 more packages of indigo that I&#x27;m now afraid to use.  Do not trust this company.community\\&quot; and ask your questions in their forum.

    <li> Beware if you are planning on using this to cover gray hair. I bought this because I recently had surgery that affected my hair (medications and anesthesia) made my hair very brittle and I began loosing it.  My stylist recommended we try this since it was all natural and would not hurt the new hair growth.    This product was a joke. My stylist mixed to specifications included with the henna, mix with water apply and wait 45-60 mins.  This stuff smells like baby food, and felt like mud on my hair.     After 60 mins he washed with water, per instructions.  My hair was limp, and dull. There was no color change to the gray hair, and the dark hair seemed a little darker, but not much.     I waited the 48 hours like it said before washing with soap (non dandruff shampoo since this could cause your hair to turn green) this was not on the packaging but was included from the shipper on invoice. I had to lather, rinse 3 times before my hair felt clean, then I had to apply a conditioner and let it sit for 5 mins to get the hair to feel tangle free.     So in the long run I ended up still having the gray hair. Which was the reason I ordered this to cover it. I followed all directions, and even ordered 2 shades darker then my own hair.    Guess I will use the remaining powder for tattoos or fertilizer in my organic garden.</li>
    <li> I have never dyed my hair with henna hair dye until now. I was very nervous about trying henna for the first time, but my damaged hair needed a change.  I wish I tried this product sooner, because not only was the color AMAZING, but it left my hair silky and shiny like never before.  I highly recommend this product and I can&#x27;t wait to order more!!!  AAA++++</li>
    <li> Works perfectly and better than chemical hair dyes do. I used this on my sister and her gray turned blueish green for the first few hours and she woke with beautiful dark brown hair! She (we) could not ask for a better product. If you follow the directions they would have known this and more than likely felt like an A** when they woke with brown hair. You have a customer for life and all of Harvest Moon products are awesome. I recommend all of Harvest Moon Shampoos as well.     I also want to point out we did not have to boil, cut, chop,boil tea, make coffee or microwave the henna prior. We also did not have to have to let the hair dye sit on the counter for 24 hours before using it. We just added water and applied. Super easy!</li>
    <li> Great color too! However, it is a difficult handling and time involved with powder henna. Try to use organic apple cider vinegar (ACV) on your hair before coloring. It will help processing for vivid shine and color.</li>
    <li> After all the damage that chemical hair dye did to my hair, I decided to try something more natural. About 2 years ago, I found Henna Hut&#x27;s products and absolutely fell in love. Unlike chemical dye, the henna hair dye leaves my hair silky soft and in better condition than what I started out with. I actually look forward to coloring my hair now. In between colorings, I LOVE their Aloe Vera shampoo and conditioner as well. It doesn&#x27;t fade my color and it conditions my hair like no other brand-name shampoo out there. It doesn&#x27;t leave any buildup either. All in all, this product is great. I recommend it to all of my friends and family. My cousin loves it too, (she uses the Red) especially after her allergic reaction to chemical dye. I am very satisfied with the result of this hair dye and will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> Followed the directions perfectly and the color looks great! I love it! Will definitely order this henna hair dye again. My hair feels soft and healthy too. Love not getting the harsh chemicals that come along with regular dyes! yay!! :)</li>
    <li> Im 23 and Ive used chemical dyes for 10 years now, sometimes every month. I was obsessed with changing its color. I would also curl my hair everyday to add to the damage. Then my boyfriend persuaded me to grow out my natural color so I did but my faded color was getting really ugly so I was so happy to find henna! I couldn&#x27;t believe that dying my hair could make it healthier. The first 2 times I used it it didnt work so well. I research more and found some important instructions  1. Wash you hair 2 times with a shampoo with the ingredient Sodium laureth sulfate. Don&#x27;t use conditioner  2. Use warm tap water for the henna. I leave it in for 2 hours... why not  3. Also use as much henna as you can  im not sure if this really makes a difference but my hair seems much bouncier and thicker when I use the whole package)  4. Wash it out with a shampoo without the ingredient Sodium laureth sulfate and use a deep conditioner. I leave the conditioner on for an hour or 2  5. Blow dry your hair for 15 minutes. I blow dye it right after patting with a towel  6. Do not use a shampoo with Sodium laureth sulfate until you decide to dye it again. Usually the really cheap $1 shampoos don&#x27;t that that ingredient (save money :))  Im not sure if some of these instructions make a difference but they have made the henna work a lot better for me. I have fine hair and I loose a lot of hair. My hair used to be so damaged that I would wake up every morning with a dreadlock on my neck. When I use henna my hair looks soft thick and bouncy. It feels great after years of dry, stretchy, almost barbie-like hair.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not Just for Men or Lady Clairol. You can see how-to videos on youtube so I won&#x27;t get into technical details&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does it dye your hair ok? Yes. It does. In fact I sort of like the fact that it doe NOT give you that monochrome every-hair-dyed-completely-solid  &amp;#34;Elvis&amp;#34; look. Some grey is still visible but it just makes it look more natural and a little more random. I can see where the the ladies might not like that but for men, or at least this guy, I have no problems with it. And it&#x27;s actually cheaper than  regular dyes. You can get several dye jobs out of one pack</li>
    <li> After reading all the good reviews about henna hut I bought athe three packs dye with application kit and their under eye cream. They sent two under eye cream in seprate packages charge me for shipping on both packages and no hair dye . I&#x27;ve called and email them, no one picks up the phone ever so I sent an email. They admitted that there was an error with the shipping they will rectify the problem and send me out the hair dye. It&#x27;s been two weeks and am still waiting all I get is they sent it out so I ask for a tracking number they can&#x27;t provide me with one. I feel like I&#x27;ve been scammed and rob out of 42 dollars I even ask for a refund but to no avail.</li>
    <li> with more white hair popping out - it&#x27;s easy to cover up and &amp;#34;pretend&amp;#34; I have highlights.  and it&#x27;s not so obvious, natural look!</li>
    <li> I really want to love this product and I&#x27;m hoping I did something wrong and maybe it will work if I try again and leave it in for longer. I followed the instructions completely but the grey hairs were not fully covered. I only have a small amount of grey around the temple area. I really love how convenient this hair dye is and the fact that it doesn&#x27;t burn my scalp at all though. I am thinking about getting more to try again and leave it on longer.</li>
    <li> it does not work no matter how you do it or how long your wait for the products to take affect.. don&#x27;t buy it.</li>
</ol>
