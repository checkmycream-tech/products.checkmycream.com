      <li>I honestly dont even feel comfortable using this ink.</li>
      <li>I have used many ink brands, and these inks, while cheap, are pretty damn good.</li>
      <li>Have already tried the ink out and it holds very well, beautiful color and looks great on the skin, definitely will buy more, and was shipped out quickly!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> My boyfriend bought this and so far all I ve heard is positive comments he just started working with color but what he has worked on the color looks great ! When he runs out will be buying from here again !</li>
    <li> Great color goes on skin clean and wipes easy.</li>
    <li> Very cheap ink smells like ammonia, the ink is very thin and when you shake it it bubbles up. Not satisfied at all I wouldn&#x27;t even use this to tattoo rubber skin. Wasted 19.00 on these paper weights! Also tried to find out info on contents of this ink and there is none nor is there an actual web site for this product so be weary.</li>
    <li> the colors are very good they attach to your skin strongly</li>
    <li> It is verry nice and good material</li>
    <li> It was as I expected 3</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure if product was really new? There was ink splattered all over all the bottles a big mess</li>
    <li> I have used many ink brands, and these inks, while cheap, are pretty damn good. Be warned though the caps/bottles are crap and after each use put that little plug back into bottle under the screw cap. half my bottles would seep ink out from under the pop cap on the top during shaking. Bad bottle, good ink. I have used it on several client including myself, I test everything on myself first, and the ink from these holds up just like the pro stuff. I have some other brands that are clearly more expensive and named and this ink beats some of them on quality of tattoo/color saturation. My least favorite color in the pack would be White, typical, and my favorite would be Dark Red, Black. If you really give these a try, a serious try they aren&#x27;t bad.</li>
    <li> Ok this ink goes in nice and looks good but you will get a infection from it I bought it because of all the good reviews and I tattooed my self and it got infected, but if u had a drop of witch hazel in every bottle it&#x27;s good I know it sounds crazy but I had the ink tested</li>
    <li> my daughter loves them packing was great no or spills thank you</li>
    <li> something had leaked in the package and the ink itself was so old the colors had begun to separate. I honestly dont even feel comfortable using this ink.</li>
    <li> Hold to the skin good the blues in this set isn&#x27;t all that all the other inks ate good I haven&#x27;t seen how it will hold up over time but will come back a review it an have made some other ink perches an will review them as well</li>
    <li> Great ink. Have had no problems. Mixes very well and truly holds it&#x27;s color. Clean up is also very easy, dial soap cleans it right up.</li>
    <li> inks stink, very watery. would not recommend these inks. very disappointed but u get what u pay for i guess.</li>
    <li> Yhis type of ink is fake ink no good no used for skin used for fake skin do not use this type of ink</li>
    <li> the ink stays very well</li>
    <li> Completely satisfied with shipping and item.</li>
    <li> The ink is a good brand, vibrant colors, as well as the bottles are decently sized!  I love this product especially with the price!</li>
    <li> Havent tried it out but ill let u no lol im gonna be the victim. Before I put it in other people.</li>
    <li> not bad for the price</li>
    <li> Inks fade before healings even done caps came broke some of the seals were broke the black just sucks the other colors fade little shipping was fast though</li>
    <li> Good ink and color.hopefully you will come out with more packages that have more colors</li>
    <li> Solid ink for beginners. Good price, good shipping,.good colors. My only complaint would be the black ink, but once you go kuro sumi, it&#x27;s hard to go back. Perfect for any aspiring artist out there.</li>
    <li> Really like the colors completely satisfyed</li>
    <li> I thought i would give this a go. Lots of colors very watery.&lt;br /&gt;This ink shouldn&#x27;tbe used on human skin. Im sticking with mothers ink from now on.</li>
    <li> Great idem received on time</li>
    <li> This needs to be banded, and tooken off&lt;br /&gt; because.... I looked down at all of this list of people talking, and some said the same stuff as deffert people!!! And said the exact same thing!!! as I&#x27;m Knowing it&#x27;s the same person, While the guy/girl is trying to get people to buy this craps! witch I can see it&#x27;s a scam.... plus I looked up what&#x27;s fake and wats not fake with inks, and this one is faked very big!! So this is why it&#x27;s faked badly, ok so one thing about forreal ink, its not supost to be sield in that see throw Shuramwrap , and another thing about real ink is, it duess not have the black top and a cork for the inside. the real one has a white top, And a seal inside not a cork. but the worse part about it is, it seems to be faked from a fake, and that&#x27;s bad. so I guess a lot of people lost, a lot of money. Dang😔</li>
    <li> I wouldn&#x27;t even give this sh*t one star, it&#x27;s freaking rank AF! Mold started growing in some of my bottles even with handling the inks with utmost care and sanitation. also the color doesn&#x27;t stay in skin, while the tattoo is healing the color just all scabs off. I learned my lesson and will only buy quality ink even if I am in a pinch.</li>
    <li> Great colors. The blues won&#x27;t mix very well but the rest are awesome</li>
    <li> ink is really watery. doesnt hold up. color hue and intensity is like reduced to minimum. cap is really cheap and doesnt lock in place, I had to tape it up,</li>
    <li> Clean ink but very thin!! thats bad for business!! needs to be thicker for a beautiful tattoo! may buy different ink later!</li>
    <li> Bottles leak and caps don&#x27;t stay on</li>
    <li> I wish u had some pastel colors too! But the colors u do have r very true!</li>
    <li> great color took to skin very well.</li>
    <li> I love these inks. They are almost as good as some of the top brands and are way cheaper and the containers are way bigger than i thought. They arrived fast and I used 4 of the colors so far and the outcome is great.</li>
    <li> They need to fix the ink cap leak problem and the ink is OK</li>
    <li> Great inks, never had a single problem with any of them. Have already tried the ink out and it holds very well, beautiful color and looks great on the skin, definitely will buy more, and was shipped out quickly!</li>
    <li> Color doesn&#x27;t hold in the skin.</li>
    <li> There was very minor leakage from one bottle. Otherwise, it would have gotten 5 stars. Good price, fast service and good product.</li>
    <li> We like the ink.  Arrived quickly and as advertised.</li>
    <li> Came fast. Using this for practice packinging came nice and neat. No problems.</li>
    <li> The ink doesnt stick to the skin. Completely ruined a tattoo because of the ink. Would not recommend this to anybody.</li>
    <li> I was suprised at how nice the ink absorbed into the skin, and the vibrancy after the healing process. I tested on myself before anyone else, and am really happy with the product. I was nervous since it&#x27;s not one of the BIG well known companies, but honestly a good buy. I have not used all the colors, I used blues, greens, and red.</li>
    <li> the colors are great they go in the skin very well but the reason I rated them so low is because since Ive used 4 colors 2 of the caps have broke.</li>
    <li> they are really good inks for the price. They saturate very well.And are really good colors. they are great for beginners to learn with and learn to conserve</li>
    <li> There is an fda recall on no-name Chinese ink with black lettering on a white label! always buy ink and other supplies from a reputable tattoo supplier!</li>
    <li> These inks are s***, they are grainy and almost solid and we&#x27;re leaking all over the place before even being used</li>
    <li> This ink did well. It still looks good after it healed... Will order in the future. Came on time too.</li>
    <li> The Premium Tattoo Ink Set, 15 Color 1/2 oz (15ml) each, OTW-A115, shipped fast and Have bright pigments, beware of the bottle once plunger is removed bottle leaks (everywhere esp, while shaking ... ).</li>
    <li> Awesome inks! I will use this seller again in the future.</li>
    <li> this ink holds up well... great investment. will order again in future. very bright pigments. love the colors. great bargain!! have used it 7 times already.. and the purple seems to be the popular color</li>
    <li> This was a present and the artist loves them</li>
    <li> These are nice colors and are bigger bottles than I thought they would be! Was very please when we received them! Would recommend!</li>
