      <li>Every woman I&#x27;ve introduced this product to has nothing but loved it!!!</li>
      <li>Excellent service!</li>
      <li>Excellent powder!</li>
      <li>Great product.</li>
      <li>So happy to find it.</li>
      <li>Great buy also.</li>
      <li>I love the blend of color and the matte flawless appearance after using.</li>
      <li>And my brush is a good one,</li>
      <li>Love this product!  </li>
      <li>Glad I did!</li>
      <li>It is amazing for evening out any blotchiness on your skin, as well as setting liquid foundation.</li>
      <li>I am so happy that it is available on Amazon.</li>
      <li>I apply it over my makeup to just kind of finish off the look.</li>
      <li>Works nicely - Around my area</li>
      <li>My skin looked more matte but the redness (which is very light) wasn&#x27;t diminished at all.</li>
      <li>I love how this stuff evens out my skin tone.  </li>
      <li>I love this powder...</li>
      <li>I love this product as a finishing powder.</li>
      <li>It was ok, but just didn&#x27;t do as well.</li>
      <li>love this product, have used it for years.  </li>
      <li>&amp; i love it.</li>
      <li>I love this powder.  </li>
      <li>I use Clinique Superbalanced foundation, then this powder on top of it.  </li>
      <li>it&#x27;s my favorite beauty product.</li>
      <li>Great... evens skin tones and makes my red face more even.  </li>
      <li>It sets my foundation and adds a mild glow that I really love.</li>
      <li>It is light feeling, corrects mild flaws and gives your face an \\&quot;all over\\&quot; hint of color.</li>
      <li>The old formula is great, maybe it&#x27;s the same</li>
      <li>Every time I used it the people asked me what I am using because my face looks fresh and iluminated.  </li>
      <li>Very long wait for this item but worth it as I&#x27;m very pleased with it.</li>
      <li>I have very dark circles under my eyes &amp; i use this powder on top of my concealer to set it, since it is very light weight.</li>
      <li>Thanks!</li>
      <li>I have since fallen in love with it, and was dismayed that Physicians Formula has recently discontinued the product.  </li>
      <li>I used this exact product probably about 5 years ago</li>
      <li>I love this highlighting powder, if you need to cover any imperfections, a small brush and the appropriate color corrected any blemish or redness patch on my face.</li>
      <li>It is so light that I barely feel it, or see it.  </li>
      <li>My skin is easily irrated and gets red.  </li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t show any color and doesn&#x27;t do anything for actual coverage (though it does kind of correct your general tone if you have redness, etc.), and I really like this.  </li>
      <li>Although it has been replaced with something similar, the new product does not contain as many correcting colors as this older product.  </li>
      <li>it really evens out my skin tone.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product to anyone!</li>
      <li>Very prompt.</li>
      <li>Love this product, add such a soft color over my make-up</li>
      <li>As all the other reviews said, this product gives a healthy glow to the skin.</li>
      <li>but they haven&#x27;t carried this particular one for a while.  </li>
      <li>and it does make you look super dry on certain areas</li>
      <li>I have noticed that many other makeup brands have something similar, but Physicians Formula was the first (I think), and the price is within my budget.  </li>
      <li>I originally bought and used this powder as a travel powder as it was smaller and more compact than my other loose powder, and it was highly recommended by a girl friend.  </li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t white me out like normal light powder, but would not say that this is the only thing I need for my face like one review</li>
      <li>This powder puts a nice finishing touch to your face, with subtle highlights.</li>
      <li>Regardless of how many other highlighters I try, I always wind up coming back to this!  </li>
      <li>and I loved it, it really helped even out my complexion but this time around I can hardly get any product onto my brush much less my face</li>
      <li>Love that I can order this online - hard to locate for sale otherwise -</li>
      <li>Like how it looks natural</li>
      <li>Looks so natural.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t need to apply too much of this to have it work well, and it doesn&#x27;t dry my skin.</li>

<li> Looks so natural.  </li>
<li> I don&#x27;t need to apply too much of this to have it work well, and it doesn&#x27;t dry my skin.</li>
<li> I didn&#x27;t try it on just bare skin yet but after seeing other reviews, I think I will!</li>
<li> Not only does it set my concealer, but gives added correcting to my dark circles.</li>
<li> I use green, then beige concealer over red blemishes, then finish by applying this all over my face.</li>
<li> I wear this now instead of wearing any other powder or foundation.  </li>
<li> I use the product as I would any other powder--to set my foundation and to keep T-zone shine at bay.  </li>
<li> I have very dull skin, and this powder imparts just a little color over my entire face, without being an obvious highlighter or color corrector.  </li>
<li> Not available in the stores anymore.</li>
<li> I have used this product for quite a few years</li>
<li> liter is an unbelievable product.  </li>
<li> this compact it hard to find.</li>
<li> Could hardly get any powder on brush.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;m an olive complexion, and it gives my skin a subtle glow without that ghostly hue in photographs that one of an olive tone sometimes gets from wearing a &amp;#34; Caucasian &amp;#34; version of translucent make-up.</li>
<li> They must&#x27;ve changed the formula, it&#x27;s not nearly as good as it used to be.</li>
<li> It is a translucent powder, I know a little deceiving, but once you try it and see the dramatic results it gives you&#x27;ll be tracking this gown forever!</li>
<li> This is a visually not so stunning product, but never judge a book by its cover!!!</li>
<li> So sorry it has been discontinued.</li>
<li> Hard to find in retail outlets :(</li>
<li> I hate feeling like I&#x27;m wearing a thick mask.</li>

    <li> Love this product, add such a soft color over my make-up</li>
    <li> Very long wait for this item but worth it as I&#x27;m very pleased with it.</li>
    <li> This powder puts a nice finishing touch to your face, with subtle highlights.</li>
    <li> I love this highlighting powder, if you need to cover any imperfections, a small brush and the appropriate color corrected any blemish or redness patch on my face. The only downside is I have combination skin and it does make you look super dry on certain areas so definitely don&#x27;t skip your moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I love how this stuff evens out my skin tone.  I use green, then beige concealer over red blemishes, then finish by applying this all over my face. It is so light that I barely feel it, or see it.  That&#x27;s what I want. I hate feeling like I&#x27;m wearing a thick mask.</li>
    <li> Love that I can order this online - hard to locate for sale otherwise - it&#x27;s my favorite beauty product.</li>
    <li> Great... evens skin tones and makes my red face more even.  Great product. will buy from again.thanks</li>
    <li> I wear this now instead of wearing any other powder or foundation.  Works weather it&#x27;s with my regular skin tone or w/ sun.  No need to use anything else.</li>
    <li> Works nicely - Around my area this compact it hard to find.</li>

    <li> Excellent powder! So happy to find it. Not available in the stores anymore. Great buy also.</li>
    <li> Love this product!  Use to buy it at my local Walmart store but they haven&#x27;t carried this particular one for a while.  I love the blend of color and the matte flawless appearance after using.</li>
    <li> This is the third one I buy.  Every time I used it the people asked me what I am using because my face looks fresh and iluminated.  I just can&#x27;t travel without it !</li>
    <li> Regardless of how many other highlighters I try, I always wind up coming back to this!  I&#x27;m an olive complexion, and it gives my skin a subtle glow without that ghostly hue in photographs that one of an olive tone sometimes gets from wearing a &amp;#34; Caucasian &amp;#34; version of translucent make-up.</li>
    <li> This is a visually not so stunning product, but never judge a book by its cover!!! Physicians formula multicolored hi- liter is an unbelievable product.  Every woman I&#x27;ve introduced this product to has nothing but loved it!!! It is a translucent powder, I know a little deceiving, but once you try it and see the dramatic results it gives you&#x27;ll be tracking this gown forever!</li>
    <li> I love this product as a finishing powder. It sets my foundation and adds a mild glow that I really love. My biggest problem is buying it. I am so happy that it is available on Amazon.</li>
    <li> Like how it looks natural</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t need to apply too much of this to have it work well, and it doesn&#x27;t dry my skin.</li>
    <li> They must&#x27;ve changed the formula, it&#x27;s not nearly as good as it used to be. I used this exact product probably about 5 years ago and I loved it, it really helped even out my complexion but this time around I can hardly get any product onto my brush much less my face and when I finally had, it was as if I did nothing at all. My skin looked more matte but the redness (which is very light) wasn&#x27;t diminished at all. The old formula is great, maybe it&#x27;s the same just an expired product idk but it sucked and I do not recommend.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for quite a few years &amp; i love it. I have very dark circles under my eyes &amp; i use this powder on top of my concealer to set it, since it is very light weight. Not only does it set my concealer, but gives added correcting to my dark circles. Recently, i could not find this in stores &amp; tried the similar product by Elf. It was ok, but just didn&#x27;t do as well. I highly recommend this product to anyone!</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t white me out like normal light powder, but would not say that this is the only thing I need for my face like one review said. You will still need blush or bronzer to highlight.</li>
    <li> Looks so natural.  I love this powder...had been buying it from CVS which is forty minutes away, and decided to check out Amazon.  Glad I did!</li>
    <li> Excellent service! Very prompt. Great product!! Thanks!</li>
    <li> I use Clinique Superbalanced foundation, then this powder on top of it.  It is amazing for evening out any blotchiness on your skin, as well as setting liquid foundation.</li>
    <li> I use this all the time... it really evens out my skin tone.</li>
    <li> As all the other reviews said, this product gives a healthy glow to the skin. It doesn&#x27;t show any color and doesn&#x27;t do anything for actual coverage (though it does kind of correct your general tone if you have redness, etc.), and I really like this.

    <li> love this product, have used it for years.  Hard to find in retail outlets :(</li>
    <li> I had to send back.  Could hardly get any powder on brush.  And my brush is a good one,</li>
    <li> I have a host of skin problems.  My skin is easily irrated and gets red.  This product works wonders and hides flaws seemlessly.</li>
