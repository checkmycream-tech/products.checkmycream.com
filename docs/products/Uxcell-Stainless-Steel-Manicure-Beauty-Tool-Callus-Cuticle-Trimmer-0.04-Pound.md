      <li>Works great.  </li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s a great product.</li>
      <li>It still works kind of okay, so that&#x27;s why I rated 3 stars.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Item accurately described; fast shipment; Great Seller!  </li>
      <li>I like it ok, but why is this coming all the way from Asia?</li>
      <li>but I&#x27;ve had a better looking one before but that one broke.</li>
      <li>One of my favorite manicure/ pedicure tools.</li>
      <li>One with any flexibility between the cutter and the handle works much better.  </li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>The tip can stab but it sure isn&#x27;t made to trim a cuticle (trust me</li>
      <li>BETTER THAN MOST OUT THERE.</li>
      <li>I am satisfied with my purchase.</li>
      <li>There is no flexibility to the handle so you can&#x27;t easily turn it or bend it at all to maneuver around the nail.  </li>
      <li>It works fine, but the picture is misleading.</li>
      <li>yes but cheaply made, no angle to it</li>
      <li>This is so sharp and amazing, better than anything ive tried sold in the states!</li>
      <li>And, the size and overall weight are good.  </li>
      <li>Glad to finally found one that is made with stainless steel and shape too!!</li>
      <li>Exactly what i needed.</li>
      <li>It is so much better than my last one.</li>
      <li>Really shape!  </li>
      <li>NICE AND SHARP.</li>

      <li>It was more than I had expected and exceeded my expectations on every level.</li>
      <li>This one is very sturdy and well made.  </li>
      <li>This stainless steel version is sturdy.</li>
      <li>not the same product i ordered b4 cheap</li>
      <li>Highest quality product and performs very well.  </li>
      <li>I went to Walgreen&#x27;s; paid $7 for one made by Revlon that works very well.&lt;br /&gt;DON&#x27;T</li>
      <li>Cutter piece is way too wide to be able to trim cuticles.</li>
      <li>It was a cheap piece of junk comprised of several pieces of layered metal....</li>
      <li>A true manicure &amp;#34;tool&amp;#34; - saves many a hangnail from becoming a horrid, painful wound.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Unfortunately, the blade isn&#x27;t as sharp as i had expected so that was kind of a buzz kill.</li>
      <li>This item came early and was packaged quite well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I did have to bend it a little, but it works very well.</li>

<li> This item came early and was packaged quite well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> I did have to bend it a little, but it works very well.</li>
<li> What arrived is a short, bendable metal tool set into a flat metal handle.</li>
<li> it&#x27;s a straight handle with a blade wedged into the end, you have to bend the blade which did nothing because there is very little neck on the blade</li>
<li> Similar to the other reviews, this tool really isn&#x27;t effective in cutting off the cuticles.</li>
<li> The picture shows a solid, single piece of metal and the description states it is approx.</li>
<li> so it took a really long time to get here.</li>
<li> 4 1/2 inches long.</li>
<li> It digs too deep and no matter how careful I am, I get cut.  </li>
<li> The sides that form the &amp;#34;V&amp;#34; with the blade are too long.  </li>
<li> It rests flatter than some other tools I&#x27;ve used and although I haven&#x27;t bent the tip like other reviewers suggested, I&#x27;m guessing it&#x27;s the only way to actually use this tool for what it&#x27;s meant for.</li>
<li> The design felt solid, but it wasn&#x27;t sharp.</li>
<li> This thing is compact (about three inches), fits into a DOVO man&#x27;s manicure/pedicure set almost perfectly, is sharp, works just as well as the plastic ones you&#x27;d buy at a local pharmacy</li>
<li> This definitely did the job of cutting your cuticles, but it would often cut a little more than that.</li>
<li> But, it is very sharp and the opening is very tiny</li>
<li> so you tend to push harder than you should.  </li>
<li> it is sharp and work quite well</li>
<li> The blade isn&#x27;t at all sharp.</li>
<li> wouldn&#x27;t recommend this item if you were looking for something particularly sharp.</li>
<li> At best it does a sloppy job and at worst it cuts.</li>
<li> I can&#x27;t tell if this is dull or sharp because the trimmer is too flat to get in there and trim hangnails &amp; cuticles.  </li>
<li> Believe the reviews...is very sharp.  </li>
<li> I did cause my cuticle to bleed a few times because it is so sharp.</li>
<li> I like this tool because it works--it is sharp, well-designed, and small.</li>
<li> The style had changed a little, but not the functionality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> WASTE YOUR MONEY.</li>
<li> Bloodied a few cuticles getting the hang of using it</li>
<li> It has no cuticle pusher at the other end, just a rather thick handle.  </li>
<li> It&#x27;s just a shame that these things are really not able, or designed to be resharpened.  </li>
<li> The tool itself is dull, ripping instead of slicing your cuticle.</li>
<li> It was two thick and blunt to remove anything.</li>
<li> flimsy, slow delivery.</li>
<li> , it&#x27;s sharp (it&#x27;s pointed metal); however, it&#x27;s poorly made and useless.  </li>
<li> and it&#x27;s very dull.</li>
<li> My cuticles aren&#x27;t tough to work on either.</li>
<li> Very poorly made.</li>
<li> Awful.  </li>

    <li> The sides that form the &amp;#34;V&amp;#34; with the blade are too long.  It digs too deep and no matter how careful I am, I get cut.  It has no cuticle pusher at the other end, just a rather thick handle.  At best it does a sloppy job and at worst it cuts.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t tell if this is dull or sharp because the trimmer is too flat to get in there and trim hangnails &amp; cuticles.  I&#x27;m going back to the drugstore for my trimmers in the future.</li>
    <li> What arrived was not what is pictured above. The picture shows a solid, single piece of metal and the description states it is approx. 4 1/2 inches long. What arrived is a short, bendable metal tool set into a flat metal handle. The length is approx. 3 inches. The tool itself is dull, ripping instead of slicing your cuticle.</li>
    <li> Very poorly made. Does not look anything like the picture! Much smaller than the advertised 4.5&amp;#34;. Cutter piece is way too wide to be able to trim cuticles.</li>
    <li> This item came early and was packaged quite well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately, the blade isn&#x27;t as sharp as i had expected so that was kind of a buzz kill. It still works kind of okay, so that&#x27;s why I rated 3 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this item if you were looking for something particularly sharp.</li>
    <li> This definitely did the job of cutting your cuticles, but it would often cut a little more than that. I didn&#x27;t notice at the time, but as my nails grew out, I could see the groove in my nails where it had cut into them.</li>
    <li> Item was not as pictured. I don&#x27;t think it was for cuticles at all.</li>
    <li> This didn&#x27;t work well at all. It was two thick and blunt to remove anything.</li>
    <li> What can I say, it does what they are made for but I&#x27;ve had a better looking one before but that one broke. This tool is all metal so it will never break.</li>
    <li> This is a great tool! I did have to bend it a little, but it works very well. I love it.</li>
    <li> a must have for your manicures</li>
    <li> I USE TO TRIM EDGES OF GEL NAILS AT CUTICLES. NICE AND SHARP. BETTER THAN MOST OUT THERE. RECOMMEND TO TRY.</li>
    <li> flimsy, slow delivery.</li>
    <li> Nothing breaks this. Exactly what i needed.</li>
    <li> This is so sharp and amazing, better than anything ive tried sold in the states!</li>
    <li> Similar to the other reviews, this tool really isn&#x27;t effective in cutting off the cuticles. It rests flatter than some other tools I&#x27;ve used and although I haven&#x27;t bent the tip like other reviewers suggested, I&#x27;m guessing it&#x27;s the only way to actually use this tool for what it&#x27;s meant for. I&#x27;ll be looking for an alternative stat!</li>
    <li> Really shape!  I have so many trimmers before that were dull and broke easily.  This one is very sturdy and well made.  Glad to finally found one that is made with stainless steel and shape too!!</li>
    <li> Item accurately described; fast shipment; Great Seller!  Thank You!!</li>
    <li> This thing is compact (about three inches), fits into a DOVO man&#x27;s manicure/pedicure set almost perfectly, is sharp, works just as well as the plastic ones you&#x27;d buy at a local pharmacy and you can steam heat/solvent/gas sterilize it without worry about melting/crazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought one for a travel kit I bought my world traveler son for his 21st birthday then bought another for myself.  The style had changed a little, but not the functionality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Would buy again.</li>
    <li> I am satisfied with my purchase. It is so much better than my last one. I did cause my cuticle to bleed a few times because it is so sharp.</li>
    <li> Does not work well. It hurt to try to use. My cuticles aren&#x27;t tough to work on either. This ships from China so it took a really long time to get here.</li>
    <li> The one I received is different from the one pictured.  It works fine, but the picture is misleading.</li>
    <li> I like it ok, but why is this coming all the way from Asia?</li>
    <li> This tool is metal yes but cheaply made, no angle to it it&#x27;s a straight handle with a blade wedged into the end, you have to bend the blade which did nothing because there is very little neck on the blade and it&#x27;s very dull. Got what I paid for.</li>
    <li> One of my favorite manicure/ pedicure tools. This stainless steel version is sturdy.</li>
    <li> not the same product i ordered b4 cheap</li>
    <li> A true manicure &amp;#34;tool&amp;#34; - saves many a hangnail from becoming a horrid, painful wound.</li>
    <li> This product does what it&#x27;s supposed to do - trim cuticles.  And, the size and overall weight are good.  But, it is very sharp and the opening is very tiny so you tend to push harder than you should.  There is no flexibility to the handle so you can&#x27;t easily turn it or bend it at all to maneuver around the nail.  I continuously cut myself with this trimmer.  One with any flexibility between the cutter and the handle works much better.  I had one of those years ago but can&#x27;t find another.</li>
    <li> It wasn&#x27;t even the same tool shown in the Amazon pic. It was a cheap piece of junk comprised of several pieces of layered metal.... not solid like shown above.</li>
    <li> Great product and service. Product arrived as advertised.</li>
    <li> Solid heavy-duty construction.  This thing is built to last.  I was impressed from the moment I took it out of the package.  It&#x27;s just a shame that these things are really not able, or designed to be resharpened.  I would recommend this nonetheless.</li>
    <li> Awful.  Piece of crap.&lt;br /&gt;Yes, it&#x27;s sharp (it&#x27;s pointed metal); however, it&#x27;s poorly made and useless.  The tip can stab but it sure isn&#x27;t made to trim a cuticle (trust me, I&#x27;m a doctor)&lt;br /&gt;So... I went to Walgreen&#x27;s; paid $7 for one made by Revlon that works very well.&lt;br /&gt;DON&#x27;T WASTE YOUR MONEY.</li>
    <li> The design felt solid, but it wasn&#x27;t sharp.</li>
    <li> Highest quality product and performs very well.  It was more than I had expected and exceeded my expectations on every level.</li>
    <li> The blade isn&#x27;t at all sharp.</li>
    <li> Works great.  Believe the reviews...is very sharp.  Bloodied a few cuticles getting the hang of using it but it&#x27;s a great product.</li>
    <li> it is sharp and work quite well</li>
    <li> I like this tool because it works--it is sharp, well-designed, and small. These are the reasons I&#x27;m giving it a great review!</li>
