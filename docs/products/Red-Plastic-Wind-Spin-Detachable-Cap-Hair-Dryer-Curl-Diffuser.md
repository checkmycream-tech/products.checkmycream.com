      <li>so it&#x27;s great for that tropical vacation.&lt;br</li>
      <li>It works great.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m kind of thinking nothing is the best except maybe some conditioning spray.</li>
      <li>Very happy with this seller and item lead time was very fast and in perfect condition</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m good</li>
      <li>It cost me more to make my daughter happy.</li>
      <li>, you get great curls, very fast.</li>
      <li>I knew it was to good to be true.  </li>
      <li>Of course this was a huge mistake!</li>
      <li>I love that the nozzle has a flap to change the direction the hair curls in as I like it to curl away from my face on both sides.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>love it.</li>
      <li>It is an interesting idea.</li>
      <li>LOVE</li>
      <li>make sure you check your dryer&#x27;s size</li>
      <li>It won&#x27;t fit on any dryer I can find!  </li>
      <li>Maybe if I had it for longer and get better experiance then it would work.</li>
      <li>I love this product.</li>
      <li>We were hoping for a better result, but it was only&amp;#34;so so&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>The best part is, it only gets straighter with humidity and more curly as it dries</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t been able to use it.  </li>
      <li>: This diffuser DOES NOT work with most sized dryers as advertised.</li>
      <li>This product works great, once you find the right hair dryer to fit.  </li>
      <li>diffuser also does not appear to work on the one shorter strand of side bang, therefore I think it is best for medium to long hair.</li>
      <li>It falls off of the hair dryer fairly easily.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s a cool product, but we have 3 blow dryers and no go</li>
      <li>but then i found another dryer in my house and that worked fine.</li>
      <li>It just gives my hair some wave and texture, which is fine with me.</li>
      <li>This, along with the BaByliss Pro BAB2000 Ceramix Xtreme Dryer, which has the perfect sized nozzle for this attachment (although I must admit the black part likes to come off</li>
      <li>I would not take this product even if it was free.  </li>
      <li>Cant get it ti fit our blow dryers.  </li>
      <li>it didn&#x27;t fit my blow dryer.</li>
      <li>I have 2 hair dryers and it doesn&#x27;t fit on either one.  </li>
      <li>This doesn&#x27;t fit on my dryer.</li>
      <li>What hair dryer does it fit and where do you find it?</li>
      <li>Wouldn&#x27;t fit it, either.</li>
      <li>I wish there was some device to secure it.  </li>
      <li>I was misled by the size listed as the opening, and it wouldn&#x27;t fit my dryer.</li>
      <li>I borrowed this same kind of device before, used it and liked it</li>
      <li>I love this product and definitely recommend it if you want easy, beautiful waves or curls without spending too much time.  </li>
      <li>The &amp;#34;Wind Spin&amp;#34; didn&#x27;t fit my primary blow dryer, but fortunately I kept an old back up that fit perfectly.  </li>
      <li>PROS:&lt;br /&gt;I was so excited to discover this.</li>
      <li>After drying, I lightly hair sprayed the curls and let my hair cool for a bit.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I was so excited to see this product.</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t get excited about this</li>
      <li>(It&#x27;s true, it doesn&#x27;t come with any), but I found that if you type in &amp;#34;wind spin curl diffuser&amp;#34; on youtube you&#x27;ll find a couple of tutorials that will help you.  </li>
      <li>Does exactly what it says it will do, quick &amp; easily.</li>
      <li>I couldn&#x27;t determine for certain if the attachment would work with my hair dryer, but with Amazon&#x27;s great customer service I knew I could return it if necessary.  </li>
      <li>I followed the review recommendations, selecting this one as the most highly rated.  </li>
      <li>fast and easy to use.</li>
      <li>and I wish him well and success</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had a digital perm for the past three years and it is the perfect styling tool for my medium length fine hair.</li>
      <li>But right now thats how I feel about it.</li>
      <li>So I will continue until I find the right one to use with this.</li>
      <li>That is the key, switching warm to cool, and not using high heat so as not to damage the hair.</li>
      <li>I switch back and forth from warm on medium to cool on medium or high to wind and set the curl.</li>
      <li>The first couple of times I used it</li>
      <li>Thanks!</li>
      <li>last year, for days when I wanted more of a curl without needing to touch up with a curling iron, I took to sitting in front of a space heater fan and coiling the strands with two hands..</li>
      <li>Once I got it on my blow dryer it worked pretty well</li>
      <li>It get too hot.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s exactly what I needed.</li>
      <li>So I researched more and found the Rosallini Red Plastic Wind Spin.  </li>
      <li>I will keep trying and if I get better I will come back and change my review.</li>
      <li>but I wish it had a bigger, more bell shaped tube</li>
      <li>i love that it&#x27;s long enough to fit all my hair!</li>
      <li>/&gt;For those of you who don&#x27;t know, a digital perm, or digi perm is a Korean hot perm method available at most Korean or Japanese salons for around $150-400 and takes from 3-4hrs.</li>
      <li>Even if I had to purchase a different hair dryer to fit, the cost of the &amp;#34;Wind Spin&amp;#34; and a good blow dryer would still be much less than $249.99!  </li>
      <li>but I think it could be easily glued on &amp; doesn&#x27;t keep it from working properly).</li>
      <li>Most often I put some product in my hair and let it air dry, but it takes a while and it takes even longer to do the whole blow out then</li>
      <li>With damp hair, Marc Anthony beach curl spray and a setting not too high that makes it too hot to hold</li>
      <li>This is a very convenient product to curl my hair every morning.</li>
      <li>Very bummed.</li>
      <li>I think in the end I will really like this product.</li>
      <li>But it fit the second blow dryer I tried.</li>
      <li>The larger sections gave me slightly bigger curls which I liked</li>
      <li>I actually wonder if that&#x27;s not what it was originally created for.</li>
      <li>The only thing to be aware of is making sure the dryer has the same dimension as the connecting part.</li>
      <li>Yes it dried the hair super fast with amazing curls, but over time it totally fried my hair which became like straw withlots of breaks and split ends.</li>
      <li>and all I was able to get was a slight twirl.</li>
      <li>It uses digital technology to perm the hair using hot rods, ensuring that they don&#x27;t get too hot and fry the hair.</li>
      <li>If you live in a warm climate it&#x27;s just spray, scrunch &amp; go (let air dry), but if you live in Chicago like me, blow drying is essential.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m trying a couple other brands with a different kind of attachment.</li>
      <li>Also, it would be nice if you could change the direction of the airflow without detaching it, as the dryer end sticks in a little too far, but it&#x27;s not too major of a problem.  </li>
      <li>I always thought I had super thick hair, but she explained to me that actually my hair is pretty fine, I just have a lot of it.</li>
      <li>I have to buy a new hairdryer for this product.</li>
      <li>It has HUGE rubber things on the inside that make the actual, usable opening much smaller.</li>
      <li>Also, since I have long hair I kind of move the diffuser up and down the strand to get the ends.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Since using this curl diffuser, my perm lasts longer than usual, saving my $$. &#x3D;)</li>
      <li>tried several times to the point where things got too hot and unmanageable.  </li>
      <li>I tried it so many different ways and different times and even used two different blow dryers.  </li>
      <li>It does swirl and curl the hair--but you need to make sure you use a small segment of hair each time.  </li>
      <li>This does work but you have to have strong hands as it is a bit heavy holding along with the dryer.</li>
      <li>The simple explanation is that it looks more natural than the frizzy perms of the 80s because it allows you to curl the hair from the ear down, making it look like you used a curling iron since you can choose a variety of barrel sizes.</li>
      <li>It takes a pretty small nozzle, but I got lucky with the one in my bathroom.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Yes I saw the air curler commercial and had to have one but did not want to spend a fortune to try (they sell buy one get one but it ends up costing a fortune with 2X shipping and handling). This does work but you have to have strong hands as it is a bit heavy holding along with the dryer. Also it has to be a dryer with a round and not oblong shaped dryer end. I had to switch dryers. I&#x27;m still experimenting with different gels and hair products. I&#x27;m kind of thinking nothing is the best except maybe some conditioning spray. I have long hair and did not have any problem with tangling.</li>
    <li> I returned it becasue it didn&#x27;t fit my blow dryer. I was hoping it would. It is an interesting idea.</li>
    <li> I dont know if its my hair type or what but I just cant seem to get my hair to curl. I&#x27;ve had it for about 2 months and I can&#x27;t get it. I dont know if I am doing something wrong. Maybe my hair isn&#x27;t long enough, its medium lengh below my shoulders. Maybe if I had it for longer and get better experiance then it would work. I am not giving up. I will keep trying and if I get better I will come back and change my review. But right now thats how I feel about it. Any tips please replay back and let me know. Thanks!</li>
    <li> I love this product.It works great.The only probelem I had was that it did not fit my blow dryer that I ordered with it. But it fit the second blow dryer I tried. It only works on blow dryers that have very small openings.Once I got it on my blow dryer it worked pretty well you must leave your hair in or a couple minutes and then spray it with somthing that will keep it in place or the curls will fall out. It makes very beautiful curls. love it.</li>
    <li> I have long straight hair.  All this product did was tangle and twist it.  It did not make one curl.  I tried it so many different ways and different times and even used two different blow dryers.  It was not even close to giving me any type of curl.  I put small pieces of hair in it and it just blew it around and it looked messy.  Then I put large pieces in it and it was worse.  Just an ugly messy look.  I would not take this product even if it was free.  I knew it was to good to be true.  Only way to curl hair is rollers or irons.  This product is ridiculous and trust me do not waste your money and get excited cause it is a joke!  If you have plain jane staight hair like me the only thing that works is curlers or irons.  Don&#x27;t get excited about this cause you will be disapointed like me.  In the process of returning this item that did not do what it said it was going to do.</li>
    <li> my daughter has long hair, but we couldnt quite figure out how to get this to curl it.  tried several times to the point where things got too hot and unmanageable.  shame</li>
    <li> This is great! The one &amp;#34;seen on TV&amp;#34; is cheap &amp; the design is poor. This can NOT be compared to that. This is great! Does exactly what it says it will do, quick &amp; easily.</li>
    <li> It does what it supposed to do, but because of the small tube, it doesn&#x27;t give big curls. It just gives my hair some wave and texture, which is fine with me. It&#x27;s not a magical product, but I like it.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t been able to use it.  I have 2 hair dryers and it doesn&#x27;t fit on either one.  Since this was cheaper than buying a hair dryer I guess this will just sit in the back of the closet. I read the reviews before and heard that you had to watch the size dryer you had but thought since I have an old small one I would not have a problem.  What hair dryer does it fit and where do you find it?</li>
    <li> I was so excited to see this product. Maybe it&#x27;s my hair type, but this product did not work. My hair is just past shoulder length and all I was able to get was a slight twirl. Waste of money. I should have returned this product.</li>
    <li> I followed the review recommendations, selecting this one as the most highly rated.  However, it does have issues.  It falls off of the hair dryer fairly easily.  I wish there was some device to secure it.  It does swirl and curl the hair--but you need to make sure you use a small segment of hair each time.  The bottom of the device also kept falling off.  We were hoping for a better result, but it was only&amp;#34;so so&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> PROS:&lt;br /&gt;I was so excited to discover this. Even after reading all the reviews, I&#x27;m not surprised it doesn&#x27;t work for some other people, but it&#x27;s exactly what I was looking for! I&#x27;ve had a digital perm for the past three years and it is the perfect styling tool for my medium length fine hair. I actually wonder if that&#x27;s not what it was originally created for. I love that the nozzle has a flap to change the direction the hair curls in as I like it to curl away from my face on both sides.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those of you who don&#x27;t know, a digital perm, or digi perm is a Korean hot perm method available at most Korean or Japanese salons for around $150-400 and takes from 3-4hrs. It uses digital technology to perm the hair using hot rods, ensuring that they don&#x27;t get too hot and fry the hair. The simple explanation is that it looks more natural than the frizzy perms of the 80s because it allows you to curl the hair from the ear down, making it look like you used a curling iron since you can choose a variety of barrel sizes. The best part is, it only gets straighter with humidity and more curly as it dries so it&#x27;s great for that tropical vacation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So....the challenge for someone who has only recently gotten accustomed to styling it, is that it can take awhile to dry. If you live in a warm climate it&#x27;s just spray, scrunch &amp; go (let air dry), but if you live in Chicago like me, blow drying is essential. Drying twisted strands into rope sections takes longer than you&#x27;d think. And I found to get them the most tightly wound, it takes two hands, or else you get these loose curls (check out styling videos on YouTube).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So last year, for days when I wanted more of a curl without needing to touch up with a curling iron, I took to sitting in front of a space heater fan and coiling the strands with two hands.. Of course this was a huge mistake! Yes it dried the hair super fast with amazing curls, but over time it totally fried my hair which became like straw withlots of breaks and split ends. I was using cotton moisture gloves and lotion to protect my hands, which should have been my first clue that this was a bad idea.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A digital perm lasts typically six months and since I live in a cold climate I took to only perming it in Spring so it would last through the summer. This year, I went to my Korean stylist for a re-perm. I always thought I had super thick hair, but she explained to me that actually my hair is pretty fine, I just have a lot of it. She thinned it out with the scissors so the curls would bounce and advised me to use a volumizing shampoo with a root booster spray, a leave-in conditioner for the ends, and a high quality deep conditioner once a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the past few weeks I have been using this new diffuser and I couldn&#x27;t be happier. It&#x27;s exactly what I needed. This, along with the BaByliss Pro BAB2000 Ceramix Xtreme Dryer, which has the perfect sized nozzle for this attachment (although I must admit the black part likes to come off but I think it could be easily glued on &amp; doesn&#x27;t keep it from working properly). The dryer has three speed setting switches AND three heat settings which means there are nine different combinations. I switch back and forth from warm on medium to cool on medium or high to wind and set the curl. That is the key, switching warm to cool, and not using high heat so as not to damage the hair. Also, since I have long hair I kind of move the diffuser up and down the strand to get the ends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For times when I really want volume at the roots, I simply dry the roots using a root booster spray (otherwise if I only focus on the ends the roots look pretty flat). After drying the roots,  If the rest of the hair gets too dry, I can simply spritz the ends and use this curl diffuser to get the curls back. Even after sleeping on them, the next day if they look too flat I just spritz them a little and use the diffuser a little and I&#x27;m good to go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Note: This diffuser DOES NOT work with most sized dryers as advertised. It&#x27;s actually pretty disappointing because it won&#x27;t work with either of my new travel driers, which means I can&#x27;t take it with me when I travel. Anyone know one that works?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The diffuser also does not appear to work on the one shorter strand of side bang, therefore I think it is best for medium to long hair. The shorter one flips out and gets all frizzy. In fact, the curls in general seem to get a little frizzy, but I&#x27;ve found it easy enough to run a shine pomade over them as a last step to combat frizzies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I mentioned, the black rubber part that covers the dryer nozzle isn&#x27;t glued on so it tends to fall off. No biggie as it works for now but I might need to glue it on later if the diffuser starts falling off. Overall I would recommend this to anyone with a digital perm.</li>
    <li> Still learning how to use it without my hair frizzing at the crown. But I&#x27;m stubborn &amp; I will continue to use it until I figure it out! Lol! I think in the end I will really like this product. It just might take a little while to figure out the right type of product &amp; dampness to use when drying my hair. I have extremely thick hair that I get thinned out with every haircut. Its just down my back a little but is in long layers &amp; is slightly wavy. I have all different types of hair products for the &amp;#34;beachy wavy look&amp;#34; that I&#x27;ve tried. So I will continue until I find the right one to use with this. There are lots of you tube videos that help out with this too.</li>
    <li> I followed the instructions and it did not wave or curl my shoulder length hair. Very bummed. Not sure if my hair isn&#x27;t long enough.</li>
    <li> Very happy with this seller and item lead time was very fast and in perfect condition&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend dealing with him and I wish him well and success</li>
    <li> I decided to give this a try after having had tried just about every method possible to get &amp;#34;beachy&amp;#34; waves and having little to no luck,  I figured it was cheap enough that I wouldn&#x27;t feel buyers remorse if it didn&#x27;t work.  I was pleasantly shocked when I tried it out for the first time and got the desired results!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I noticed a couple of people were complaining about the lack of instructions that come with it (It&#x27;s true, it doesn&#x27;t come with any), but I found that if you type in &amp;#34;wind spin curl diffuser&amp;#34; on youtube you&#x27;ll find a couple of tutorials that will help you.  I have pin straight &amp; REALLY thick hair, and figured out that doing small sections and applying a little bit of texturizing cream helps get the perfect shape.</li>
    <li> This product works great, once you find the right hair dryer to fit.  It takes a pretty small nozzle, but I got lucky with the one in my bathroom.  To bad it didn&#x27;t fit my travel dryer. Also, it would be nice if you could change the direction of the airflow without detaching it, as the dryer end sticks in a little too far, but it&#x27;s not too major of a problem.  Also if you have long hair, you can take the vented cap of the end to let it hang out.  That&#x27;s a plus.</li>
    <li> Does not fit hair dryer so I dont know if it works did not want to spend the money to send it back so I am just out the money spent for this.</li>
    <li> This doesn&#x27;t fit on my dryer.</li>
    <li> Great product! fast and easy to use. remember to dry your roots first so you get volume. the valve on the bottom allows you to change the direction of the curl. whether you want to curl towards your face or away. i love that it&#x27;s long enough to fit all my hair! LOVE IT!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;it wasn&#x27;t compatible with the dryer i bought but then i found another dryer in my house and that worked fine. make sure you check your dryer&#x27;s size so it&#x27;s compatible.</li>
    <li> This product is hard to use and did not curl my hair very well, You need alot of time to use this</li>
    <li> I love this product and definitely recommend it if you want easy, beautiful waves or curls without spending too much time.  My hair is long and thick and has some natural wave.  Most often I put some product in my hair and let it air dry, but it takes a while and it takes even longer to do the whole blow out then curl.  I have tried other products that dry and style at the same time and wasn&#x27;t completely satisfied with the outcome.  While doing research on the internet, I found a hair dryer with an attachment like the &amp;#34;Wind Spin&amp;#34; but it cost $249.99!  As intrigued as I was, the price was ridiculous.  So I researched more and found the Rosallini Red Plastic Wind Spin.  I couldn&#x27;t determine for certain if the attachment would work with my hair dryer, but with Amazon&#x27;s great customer service I knew I could return it if necessary.  Even if I had to purchase a different hair dryer to fit, the cost of the &amp;#34;Wind Spin&amp;#34; and a good blow dryer would still be much less than $249.99!  The &amp;#34;Wind Spin&amp;#34; didn&#x27;t fit my primary blow dryer, but fortunately I kept an old back up that fit perfectly.  I am completely happy with this product!</li>
    <li> This is a very convenient product to curl my hair every morning. I also get lots of compliments after making the curls with this. The only thing to be aware of is making sure the dryer has the same dimension as the connecting part. Since using this curl diffuser, my perm lasts longer than usual, saving my $$. &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> I borrowed this same kind of device before, used it and liked it so I was looking for one for myself.  This does what it&#x27;s supposed it but I wish it had a bigger, more bell shaped tube so I could get bigger curls.&lt;br /&gt;Suggestions:&lt;br /&gt;1.  The attachment fits only on smaller dryer openings.  I didn&#x27;t measure but I guestimate my dryer&#x27;s opening is 2\\&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;2.  I have long hair and had to take the vent screen off the bottom.  Before I took it off my hair twisted around and became a knotty mess.&lt;br /&gt;3.  You cannot hold this by the attachment.  It get too hot.  You have to use the hair dryer handle.&lt;br /&gt;4.  The first couple of times I used it, I grabbed smaller sections of hair which resulted in tighter curls.  The next time I separated my hair, which is thin, into three parts: left, back, and right.  The larger sections gave me slightly bigger curls which I liked more.&lt;br /&gt;5.  I dry my hair by moving the attachment up and down the section.  When I leave it in one place the ends of my hair do not curl enough.  If I leave it too far from my head, the roots don&#x27;t get dry enough.&lt;br /&gt;6.  After drying, I lightly hair sprayed the curls and let my hair cool for a bit.&lt;br /&gt;7.  DO NOT BRUSH YOUR HAIR.  You will ruin all your work.  I separate the curls with my fingers and &#x27;fluff&#x27; to finish.</li>
    <li> Sorry to buck the trend, but I think this thing is total garbage! Does it work in principle? Like gangbusters. With damp hair, Marc Anthony beach curl spray and a setting not too high that makes it too hot to hold, you get great curls, very fast. With shoulder length or so, not too long, they&#x27;re so cool, very different curls. The problem? It won&#x27;t fit on any dryer I can find!  I was misled by the size listed as the opening, and it wouldn&#x27;t fit my dryer. It has HUGE rubber things on the inside that make the actual, usable opening much smaller. So I bought the Revlon Nano Diamond, with a very narrow mouth. Wouldn&#x27;t fit it, either. Kept falling off of it, too. The only way I could see the process itself works was to have my husband hold the thing on while I did it. Pathetic. I suspect the half dozen or so I see that seem to have been cast from the same mold have the same problem. I&#x27;m trying a couple other brands with a different kind of attachment.</li>
    <li> Does not fit in any hairdryer. I have to buy a new hairdryer for this product. It cost me more to make my daughter happy.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my girlfriend as a graduation present. We had a little trouble at first because it didn&#x27;t fit her hair dryer, but we found one that fit after a little searching. It does it&#x27;s job. It drys your hair while it curls it. The curls however are short lived and fall out after a few hours. She still likes it though.</li>
    <li> Cant get it ti fit our blow dryers.  I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s a cool product, but we have 3 blow dryers and no go</li>
