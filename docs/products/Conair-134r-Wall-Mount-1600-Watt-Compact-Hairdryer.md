      <li>Also has a night light.</li>
      <li>I like the night light feature.</li>
      <li>both of which satisfy my needs.&lt;br /&gt;There is a night light feature that some will find to be of value - it goes off when you turn on a light or when the daylight is sufficient.&lt;br</li>
      <li>the night light is an added bonus.</li>
      <li>This one also has a night light that comes on automatically when the lights are out.</li>
      <li>and I also like the night light.</li>
      <li>They are especially nice for guest bathrooms because they are out in plain sight for use.  </li>
      <li>All the features are user friendly.  </li>

      <li>Convenient to have it available right on the wall and perfect for my small bathroom.</li>

      <li>Super product.</li>
      <li>This is a very good wall mount dryer that takes up very little space and works well on all hair styles.</li>
      <li>Easy to install, attractive, and takes up very little space.</li>
      <li>They also have plenty of blowing power (1600V), they are quiet, don&#x27;t take up room, they have a night light and they are very easy to install.</li>
      <li>The handle is easy to hold onto and it dries my hair fast after I get out of the shower.</li>
      <li>Quick delivery, powerful item for being compact, would recommend this hairdryer if you want a wall mounted one like in the hotels.</li>
      <li>and the motor burned out at the first use!</li>
      <li>The 1600 watts drys the hair real fast.</li>
      <li>Nicely designed but not enough temperature controls.</li>
      <li>The temperature of the hair dryer isneither to hot or to cool</li>
      <li>The night light is an added feature that has now replaced an old night light in the bathroom.  </li>
      <li>I got on the internet when returning from our vacation and found the same one that we liked at the motel.</li>
      <li>/&gt;So be sure to check the other listings as the prices can be much better.</li>
      <li>Love this wall mounted compact hairdryer, it doesn&#x27;t take up much room on the wall and has plently of power on high, and</li>
      <li>The price was right</li>
      <li>It dries my hair quickly, fits nicely in my hand, and is compact enough that it doesn&#x27;t take up too much space on the wall.  </li>
      <li>So happy to find the same brand, just what I wanted and used the same bracket which was a blessing.</li>
      <li>Just like a hotel bathroom only better....</li>
      <li>and this one is exactly what we needed.</li>
      <li>My need was for a wall mounted unit, similar to those found in most motels.</li>
      <li>I had my first Comair wall mounted dryer for 14 years</li>
      <li>/&gt;The other listings are treated as separate products by Amazon even with their own (positive) reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>just enough power on low, love the built in night light.</li>
      <li>Conair was easy and has a moderate noise level.  </li>
      <li>Nightlight is a nice feature, and the heat and air speed that is produced dries my thick hair quickly.  </li>
      <li>Only two heat settings which is fine for us.  </li>
      <li>REALLY ILLUMINATE ANYTHING, SO IT DOESN;T</li>
      <li>REALLY SERVE IT´S PURPOSE.......</li>
      <li>Reasonably priced.</li>
      <li>just enough light.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t take up too much room on the wallI</li>
      <li>Drys fast.  </li>
      <li>The nightlight is a plus but really for me the hair dryer itself is what counts.</li>
      <li>kind of creepy especially because in my small space the nightlight is reflected in the glass shower door, but does provide a nice glow without being too bright.</li>
      <li>Would recommend for anyone with quick and simple hairstyles.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this hair dryer.</li>
      <li>They work great for about a year and a half, then they start slowing down until they eventually stop working.  </li>
      <li>It was easy to install on the wall next to the mirror and got our old hair dryer off the counter with it&#x27;s cord constantly hanging around in places in the way.</li>
      <li>This is my second Conair wall dryer and the first lasted about 15 years.</li>
      <li>Sturdy wall mount will make sure it doesn&#x27;t come crashing down after daily use of removing the dryer.</li>
      <li>This one was working but we remodeled and I thought maybe I should get a new dryer since the old one was so old.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s powerful enough to dry my hair fast without damaging it.</li>
      <li>/&gt;So far, I think I have found the answer to my need for a wall mount dryer - and if it lasts for a number of years</li>
      <li>My wife loves not having to put away the old one.</li>
      <li>Also, there should be a cool down switch which does not exist.</li>
      <li>(low speed almost too low, high speed is about normal)</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Super product. Used one in a Holiday Inn Epress motel recently and tried to buy one at the motel but they were out. I got on the internet when returning from our vacation and found the same one that we liked at the motel. We tried to find it in various stores while on vacation to no avail. In fact, not many stores even offer wall mount hair dryers. This one also has a night light that comes on automatically when the lights are out. The 1600 watts drys the hair real fast.</li>
    <li> This hair dryer is great!  It is light weight and dries my hair very quickly.  It was easy to install, too.  The nightlight did not work on the hair dryer I purchased, but that doesn&#x27;t affect the quality of the hairdryer.</li>
    <li> NICE HAIRDRYER.........WORKS WELL AND MEETS MY NEEDS. THE ONY THING IS THE NIGHTLIGHT IT HAS  DOESN;T REALLY ILLUMINATE ANYTHING, SO IT DOESN;T REALLY SERVE IT´S PURPOSE.......OTHER THAN THAT...NO COMPLAINTS¡</li>
    <li> I LOVE this hair dryer, and I don&#x27;t have to worry about knocking it off where I keep it like I did my other hair dryer.</li>
    <li> We had been looking for a wall mount unit for a while and this one is exactly what we needed. Sturdy wall mount will make sure it doesn&#x27;t come crashing down after daily use of removing the dryer. Just like a hotel bathroom only better....</li>
    <li> I purchased this hair dryer month ago for my wife who was looking for wall mounted model like what she used to have when being in hotels. I made a search and ended up with this Conair model based on features, performance and customer reviews. Now she is asking me to order another one for the kids bathroom.</li>
    <li> I love my wall mount hairdryers!  I 1st discovered them when staying at the Sheraton Waikiki and had to have one.  I now have one in every bathroom &#x3D;\\&quot;s 3! They are especially nice for guest bathrooms because they are out in plain sight for use.  They also have plenty of blowing power (1600V), they are quiet, don&#x27;t take up room, they have a night light and they are very easy to install.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve purchased 3 over 5 years.  They work great for about a year and a half, then they start slowing down until they eventually stop working.  I would try other brands except not many other models available at this price.</li>
    <li> I had one of these in my master bath in my prior house.  Loved it.  Couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere but Amazon.  Just recently purchased and just waiting to get it up.  Works well and quickly.  And best of all, it&#x27;s on the wall.  Not on my counter and not in my cabinet and not in a drawer.  It is there and handy when I need it.  Would recommend for anyone with quick and simple hairstyles.</li>
    <li> I needed a wall mounted hair dryer and this one fitys the bill. It&#x27;s not as powerful as some free standing (low speed almost too low, high speed is about normal) but it does the job when the kids/grandkids come visiting. AND, it dries hair!</li>
    <li> My last two Conair wall-mount blow dryers were quality products that lasted about 12 years each.  I&#x27;m not expecting any less with my third.</li>
    <li> This hair dryer by Conair is really great. The handle is easy to hold onto and it dries my hair fast after I get out of the shower. The nightlight is a plus but really for me the hair dryer itself is what counts. It&#x27;s not too noisy; fits well in its wall mounted holder and the cord, if you wish, allows you to move it around somewhat without having to change wall outlets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Installation was a breeze; and this has worked well for some time now. I highly recommend this hair dryer.</li>
    <li> I have wanted one of these for such a long time.  I have a small cabinet in my half bath that does not have room for a hair dryer.  This product solved that problem.  Nightlight is a nice feature, and the heat and air speed that is produced dries my thick hair quickly.  Thinking about buying another one for my daughters bathroom!</li>
    <li> Arrived on time.  Easy to install.  Has good power.  Easy to use.  Convenient to have it available right on the wall and perfect for my small bathroom. My only criticism.....was happy to see it had the nightlight feature, but the nightlight looks like a weird, green eye....kind of creepy especially because in my small space the nightlight is reflected in the glass shower door, but does provide a nice glow without being too bright.</li>
    <li> Works great.  Drys fast.  No more cords all over my counter. Great value for the money. Conair has always been reliable for me so that&#x27;s why I choose that brand.</li>
    <li> This is a great hair dryer and it is nice and compact.  Easy to install.  If you like the ones at the finer motels you will love this one.  Also has a night light.</li>
    <li> I have had this same model for the past 7 or 8  years.  When my old one died, I had been so happy with it, that I replaced it with the same product.  It is a great dryer.  It dries my hair quickly, fits nicely in my hand, and is compact enough that it doesn&#x27;t take up too much space on the wall.  I love the nightlight feature.  I would definitely recommend this product!</li>
    <li> This is a very good wall mount dryer that takes up very little space and works well on all hair styles.</li>
    <li> After having gone through 3 models of a competing brand over a period of 4 years (the last of which lasted only 2 months), I decided it was time to find a different manufacturer. My need was for a wall mounted unit, similar to those found in most motels. While there are a number of manufacturers for hand held dryers, wall mounted options are limited.&lt;br /&gt;The Conair installed easily - but I substituted molly bolts for the mounts included in the package. The result is a very strong installation, but the supplied mounting options might also have worked as well.&lt;br /&gt;To keep the cord out of the way, I wrap it around the wall mount.&lt;br /&gt;I have had the dryer for 3 months and it is working fine. It has 2 speeds - both of which satisfy my needs.&lt;br /&gt;There is a night light feature that some will find to be of value - it goes off when you turn on a light or when the daylight is sufficient.&lt;br /&gt;So far, I think I have found the answer to my need for a wall mount dryer - and if it lasts for a number of years, I know I have.</li>
    <li> My wife loves the wall mounted Conair....</li>
    <li> Hi,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m ordering this dryer based on the reviews, but I thought I might mention that there are other Conair 134R listings on Amazon at various prices.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other listings are treated as separate products by Amazon even with their own (positive) reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So be sure to check the other listings as the prices can be much better.</li>
    <li> Love this wall mounted compact hairdryer, it doesn&#x27;t take up much room on the wall and has plently of power on high, and just enough power on low, love the built in night light. Quick delivery, powerful item for being compact, would recommend this hairdryer if you want a wall mounted one like in the hotels.</li>
    <li> This is just what we have been looking for.  We ordered another one for our new house (left our last one when we sold our house) and it was too big.  This is very compact and works great.  Now if you had really long hair you probably wouldn&#x27;t like it.  Only two heat settings which is fine for us.  Shuts off automatically when you hang up.  Reasonably priced.</li>
    <li> It is very convenient and I love the compact design.</li>
    <li> I bought the hair dryer specifically because it can be wall mounted. I am very pleased with the construction and drying performance and the night light is an added bonus.</li>
    <li> I did my research and this came as advertisted. Mounting was easy.  My wife loves not having to put away the old one.</li>
    <li> This product has my full recommendation.  All the features are user friendly.  The night light is an added feature that has now replaced an old night light in the bathroom.  The temperature of the hair dryer isneither to hot or to cool (kinda like the porage the 3 bears told about in their story).  My Conair is a replacement dryer and if something were to happen to the dryer I would not hesitate to purchase another one.</li>
    <li> My wife loves the convenience of having it next to the bathroom mirror. Easy to install, attractive, and takes up very little space.</li>
    <li> this is our second and last of this hair dryer. both made it just past the 1 year warrenty then quit! like the wall mount feature but not the hassle of replaceing it each year. piece of cra?.</li>
    <li> I originally bought one of these 16 years ago and it was time to replace. So happy to find the same brand, just what I wanted and used the same bracket which was a blessing.</li>
    <li> Purchased several.  I bought one for myself, two for my sisters, and one for a rental unit.  Works great and has a night light.</li>
    <li> I have installed several wall mount dryers in the past.  Conair was easy and has a moderate noise level.  It took all of ten minutes to mount on the wall.  Consider this dryer that is used by Motels...must be a REASON!  :-)</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s light and easy to use. I had my first Comair wall mounted dryer for 14 years and I love it.</li>
    <li> I loved this hair dryer.  It was easy to install on the wall next to the mirror and got our old hair dryer off the counter with it&#x27;s cord constantly hanging around in places in the way.</li>
    <li> Have you ever had a wall-mounted hair dryer?  This is great!  I will never have any other style hair dryer again!</li>
    <li> Wall mounted dryer was easy to install, and it works great! It doesn&#x27;t take up too much room on the wallI and I also like the night light.</li>
    <li> This is my second Conair wall dryer and the first lasted about 15 years. This one was working but we remodeled and I thought maybe I should get a new dryer since the old one was so old. Oddly, we moved the old one to another location and hooked it all up and the motor burned out at the first use! I guess I replaced it just in time!</li>
    <li> I have been wanting one of these for a long time. The price was right so I decided to order it. So glad I did. The wall mounting was super easy- not many tools required and it was installed in less than 5 mins! I like the night light feature. It&#x27;s not too bright- just enough light. It&#x27;s powerful enough to dry my hair fast without damaging it. I love home nice it is to have easy access to it without it being on the counter. Very happy!</li>
    <li> Nicely designed but not enough temperature controls. I think that it is important to control your heat. Also, there should be a cool down switch which does not exist.</li>
