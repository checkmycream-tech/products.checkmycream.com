      <li>That&#x27;s why I love it.</li>

      <li>Love this brand.</li>
      <li>Absolutely love the feel, look and smell of my hair after use.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Davines MeLu is the perfect combo for long hair.</li>
      <li>On top of that, it is so easy to detangle my hair after use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Overall a very good product.</li>
      <li>Fine for strong, healthy hair</li>
      <li>I have to say, i have tried anything out the for my hair, my hair is straight and very soft, but this shampooh and conditioner makes it even better, like baby hair!!I will recommend it to all my friends and family, IS A MUST BUY!!!!</li>
      <li>/&gt;Worse, I&#x27;ve tried 5 products in the Davines line and none of the containers are even full!</li>
      <li>This shampoo and conditioner makes your hair healthy looking, shiny and clean.</li>
      <li>testing!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have fine, wavy hair</li>
      <li>Did seem 100% accurate.</li>
      <li>When I received some davine&#x27;s products in my birchbox (absolute beautifying potion, which is amazing)</li>
      <li>Worth the money to be sure.</li>
      <li>My hair looks and feels great, and I only had to cut 1 inch.</li>
      <li>It makes my hair feel and look nice, but I really dislike the scent.</li>
      <li>i used their nourishing conditioner and absolutely love it, so i tried the melu shampoo and conditioner expecting to love them as much.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for many years and this was the first buying from amazon.</li>
      <li>Worth the price!</li>
      <li>Plus they are earth and animal friendly.</li>
      <li>The MINU was nothing special.</li>
      <li>Leaves my hair shiny and full, with no split ends or damage.</li>
      <li>to the review that the bottle isn&#x27;t full -- there is a line on the bottle that indicates the fill line for the bottle.  </li>
      <li>I will be ordering more very soon.</li>
      <li>I switched to this brand about a year ago and it is true to it&#x27;s descripiton.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t have a strong scent which I love, and it agree&#x27;s with my sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>but it keeps it soft and healthy and dare I say, easy to brush.</li>
      <li>you&#x27;re determined to try this, I&#x27;d fine a salon that sells it and get a sample first.</li>
      <li>My hair has started to change as I get older, and I find it drier and more prone to split ends than it was in my 20s.  </li>
      <li>Fast shipping!!</li>
      <li>That&#x27;s a first for me!</li>
      <li>It is worth the price and you will tell the difference before you finish the bottle.</li>
      <li>It reminds me of something that might be &amp;#34;ocean&amp;#34; scented... sort of beachy (not coconut) earthy sandy fresh air.</li>
      <li>and these are the only products I&#x27;ve found that make my hair soft and shiny, greatly reducing frizz.</li>
      <li>This shampoo and conditioner are 100% worth the price.</li>
      <li>This product does a great job of making my hair feel soft and smooth, without the heaviness you get from some other products.  </li>
      <li>She finally tried melu for the first time and fell in love with it!</li>
      <li>Long, healthy, lucious locks!</li>
      <li>My hair is about waist length right now</li>
      <li>The way it made my hair feel, the fact that you only need a little to get a lot and the smell of it (which is very strong, musky but probably an acquired thing) I wanted to try the Melu to see if I loved it as much</li>
      <li>I love this brand, and always come back whenever I stray.</li>
      <li>Smell is a bit different, not bad, its light.</li>
      <li>Makes my hair feel clean, light and shiny without feeling dry or brittle.</li>
      <li>I get a good lather with the shampoo and don&#x27;t have to use a ton of conditioner( which is usually an issue for me, since my hair goes to my waist.)</li>
      <li>You only need a little of the conditioner - it takes the tangles out beautifully.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s untangles and leaves my hair super sleek and soft.</li>
      <li>Rather it felt amazing during use in the shower, but as my hair dried...  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried a few different varieties of shampoo/conditioner and they have all worked great.</li>
      <li>They work very well with my hair-type.....</li>
      <li>i would not buy this again, but i would absolutely buy the nourishing conditioner again.</li>
      <li>After having this shampoo and conditioner recommended by a very in-the-know friend of mine, I decided to suck it up and give it a try.</li>
      <li>Otherwise, like me you&#x27;ll end up feeling really ripped off and stuck with hair care products you can&#x27;t use.</li>
      <li>These products must all have very intense/distinct smells to them.</li>
      <li>I use the whole Davines line.</li>
      <li>my hair is very fine and products tend to weigh it down.</li>
      <li>I have very long hair that gets tangled easily</li>
      <li>I also wish that the bottles came full, but just like the picture its only 5/6th full-ish....</li>
      <li>My hair has been transformed to silky, shiny, much more manageable and less staticky hair that I love to wear down instead of pulling up all winter.</li>
      <li>I recommend it highly.</li>
      <li>Davines brand hair products are my favorite, hands down!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This was to heavy for my hair I feel like it felt weighted down.</li>
    <li> Love this shampoo and conditioner. I have slightly dry, thin, brown to light blonde, long hair. Product keeps it healthy, shiny and moisturized. I blow dry with a round brush to a straight finish 3x a week. I use the whole Davines line. I also use the Oi Oil and Rosemary Extract Thermal Protection product (like a leave in conditioner) Plus they are earth and animal friendly. Worth the extra cash. Smell is a bit different, not bad, its light.</li>
    <li> These products do great things for my hair.  I love the way my hair looks, feels and smells when I use Davines.</li>
    <li> Davines brand hair products are my favorite, hands down! They work very well with my hair-type.....my hair is very fine and products tend to weigh it down. These do not. I love this shampoo/conditioner as well as the crystal fixative lacquer hairspray. I discovered this product line at my salon...had never heard of it before. Prices are a touch lower here on Amazon than in my salon, so I will continue to replenish by ordering from here when needed. Seller was prompt in shipping and I had no problems with this purchase.</li>
    <li> I was buying this at the Red Door Salon for a much higher price until they discontinued carrying the product.  I was so happy to find it on Amazon!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This a great product.  It leave my long, thick, textured hair manageable and soft.  On top of that, it is so easy to detangle my hair after use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As to the review that the bottle isn&#x27;t full -- there is a line on the bottle that indicates the fill line for the bottle.  As long as the shampoo comes up to the line, your bottle is full, even if it&#x27;s not all the way up to the lid.</li>
    <li> Did seem 100% accurate. I&#x27;ve been using this product for many years and this was the first buying from amazon. It will be my last.</li>
    <li> I have to say, i have tried anything out the for my hair, my hair is straight and very soft, but this shampooh and conditioner makes it even better, like baby hair!!I will recommend it to all my friends and family, IS A MUST BUY!!!!</li>
    <li> I will be ordering more very soon. Absolutely love the feel, look and smell of my hair after use.  I took the the travel size on my last trip and it was perfect.</li>
    <li> The conditioner made me break out in acne on the back of my neck. I do not like the tub style, I prefer a squeeze bottle. It&#x27;s not very special in what it did to my hair, any other drugstore conditioner will do the same thing. I ordered the MELU shampoo but they sent me the blue MINU. So I cannot review the green MELU shampoo. The MINU was nothing special. I could never smell it. Will not repurchase. Overall, both products made my hair tangle quite a bit.</li>
    <li> This shampoo and conditioner are 100% worth the price. I have very coarse, frizzy, unmanageable hair and these are the only products I&#x27;ve found that make my hair soft and shiny, greatly reducing frizz. My hair feels light and smooth to the touch, and smells great too. I&#x27;ve always listened to hair stylists and bought the products they recommend, but I&#x27;m never going that again. From now on, it&#x27;s all Davines Melu.</li>
    <li> I had purchased from the lady that did my hair until we moved - I had no idea that they had shampoo too</li>
    <li> Davine&#x27;s makes the best hair products! They were initially recommended to me by my hair stylist but I was reluctant to try because of the price. When I received some davine&#x27;s products in my birchbox (absolute beautifying potion, which is amazing) I was so impressed that I decided to try the shampoo and conditioner. I&#x27;ve tried a few different varieties of shampoo/conditioner and they have all worked great. I have very long hair that gets tangled easily and I immediately noticed a difference in the texture, shine, and manageability of my hair. I get a good lather with the shampoo and don&#x27;t have to use a ton of conditioner( which is usually an issue for me, since my hair goes to my waist.) The smell is a little odd but pleasant, it reminds me of the smell of bubble solution you use to blow bubbles with a wand.  Overall, I believe this brand is definitely worth the price; they have a lifelong customer in me. And they are cruelty free!! Love this brand.</li>
    <li> I have long color treated blonde hair that goes past my waist. I have used almost every product known to man over the years trying to find something that doesn&#x27;t strip my hair of the color while also keeping it manageable and healthy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Davines MeLu is the perfect combo for long hair. It cleans it well enough that you won&#x27;t have greasy hair the next day but it keeps it soft and healthy and dare I say, easy to brush. My hair used to take over 30 minutes in the shower drenched in conditioner just to get a comb through, now it takes less then 10 and my hair isn&#x27;t falling out or breaking from all the knots. Amazing is an understatement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downside is the smell. It isn&#x27;t great, but heck I&#x27;ll take it any day over a great smelling hair ruining shampoo or conditioner.</li>
    <li> i used their nourishing conditioner and absolutely love it, so i tried the melu shampoo and conditioner expecting to love them as much.  they are not nearly as moisturizing, actually... my hair felt dryer.  i would not buy this again, but i would absolutely buy the nourishing conditioner again.</li>
    <li> Great product.. Leaves my hair shiny and full, with no split ends or damage. Best shampoo and conditioner I have ever used and I have tried the gamut.</li>
    <li> I love it! I wish it wasn&#x27;t so expensive. I use it sparingly. The conditioner bottle is in a jar which isn&#x27;t in my favor. It smells great in my opinion. I also wish that the bottles came full, but just like the picture its only 5/6th full-ish....</li>
    <li> I have been trying to grow my hair out for over a year now and this shampoo and conditioner has made my hair so much healthier in spite of the fact that I still rely on a hair dryer and straightening iron on a daily basis.</li>
    <li> Only shampoo and conditioner I will use.</li>
    <li> I love this brand, and always come back whenever I stray. I ordered the Melu as I haven&#x27;t tried it yet. It makes my hair feel and look nice, but I really dislike the scent. It reminds me of something that might be &amp;#34;ocean&amp;#34; scented... sort of beachy (not coconut) earthy sandy fresh air.</li>
    <li> This shampoo and conditioner makes your hair healthy looking, shiny and clean. It takes very little so lasts a long time. I recommend it highly.</li>
    <li> I switched to this brand about a year ago and it is true to it&#x27;s descripiton. Overall a very good product.</li>
    <li> My hair has started to change as I get older, and I find it drier and more prone to split ends than it was in my 20s.  This product does a great job of making my hair feel soft and smooth, without the heaviness you get from some other products.  Would highly recommend to anyone with dry hair or brittle hair.  I also use their product specifically for split ends and have noticed a lot of improvement.</li>
    <li> This is the perfect shampoo/conditioner for my hair.  OH and they don&#x27;t do animal testing!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have fine, wavy hair and this doesn&#x27;t weigh it down, and has really kept my locks shiny and manageable.</li>
    <li> I love Davines, but this is not Davines. I have been using this product for several years so I know it well. It smells bad and suds like crazy. Melu does not create suds. That&#x27;s why I love it. Good shampoo should not do this. I have been scammed. I never write reviews but felt compelled to warn consumers. If I could give it no stars I would.</li>
    <li> I have hair extensions and this shampoo and conditioner always leavs my hair soft and silky with out the frizz. I wish I could buy it in larger quantities.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;GREAT!</li>
    <li> Horrible smell! Like the inside of an old ladies purse. My hair felt coarse after using shampoo and conditioner. I feel like I got a fake product from this seller because I&#x27;ve loved all other Davines products that I&#x27;ve used and purchased through other Birchbox or from Sephora.</li>
    <li> I have fine, straight blonde hair that falls below my shoulders and struggled this winter (which has been particularly cold and dry) with dryness, static, and dullness in my hair. After having this shampoo and conditioner recommended by a very in-the-know friend of mine, I decided to suck it up and give it a try. The price was a little scary - I&#x27;m not used to spending this much money on hair care products, but it was money well spent. My hair has been transformed to silky, shiny, much more manageable and less staticky hair that I love to wear down instead of pulling up all winter. I just ordered the larger sizes (at even larger scary prices) because this stuff is worth it. I don&#x27;t love the scent - smells a little chemical-y to me, but other than that, this shampoo and conditioner have made me a believer!</li>
    <li> This is the best shampoo and conditioner I have ever used on my badly abused hair.  My hair feels like silk now.  It is worth the price and you will tell the difference before you finish the bottle.</li>
    <li> Smells wonderful. Has silicone in it, which explains why, over several years of use, my hair has become dry and damaged. Fine for strong, healthy hair I&#x27;m sure.</li>
    <li> I love this conditioner!!! I&#x27;m new to the shampoo, but I&#x27;m sold. I have long hair, and got an hombre which really fried the bottom of my hair. Instead of cutting 5 inches off I tried this. I&#x27;m so thankful I did. My hair looks and feels great, and I only had to cut 1 inch. I use it daily and it still lasts me 2 months. It doesn&#x27;t have a strong scent which I love, and it agree&#x27;s with my sensitive skin. Also not tested on animals!!</li>
    <li> This is the best shampoo/conditioner I&#x27;ve ever tried on my hair. It was recommended to me by a friend of mine who is a hair stylist. The product is very smooth and when I get out of the shower my hair isn&#x27;t tangled at all! (It usually would be with any other product.) I love the smell too! It&#x27;s very light and refreshing.</li>
    <li> My hair has never looked better or felt better since I&#x27;ve been using it. Yes I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I got the Davine&#x27;s OI product in my Birchbox last month and I love, love, loved it. The way it made my hair feel, the fact that you only need a little to get a lot and the smell of it (which is very strong, musky but probably an acquired thing) I wanted to try the Melu to see if I loved it as much so I forked out the money and ordered it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell of this one turned me off- BIG TIME. Some reviewers described it as beachy- I think it smells like bad baby powder over perfumed teenage girl trying too hard (-).  I used it as soon as I got it and it made my hair feel just as good as the OI does (+). The smell is not as bad once I blow dryed my hair (+).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I&#x27;m going to hurry up and use this as much as possible and just order the other one for next time.  I should have just stuck with the one I was used to. These products must all have very intense/distinct smells to them.</li>
    <li> Worth the price! I only use when I&#x27;m styling my hair! Long, healthy, lucious locks!</li>
    <li> I love this product!!  I have been using it for the last two years.  I have long hair that reaches my waist and this product works for me.</li>
    <li> Item just as described! Fast shipping!! A+</li>
    <li> I love thus stuff! I have one vanity &amp; its my hair. I have long &amp; very thick hair. This leaves your hair feeling sift &amp; luxurious.</li>
    <li> LOVE IT!  Makes my hair feel clean, light and shiny without feeling dry or brittle. And I can go three days before washing again without that greasy look. That&#x27;s a first for me!</li>
    <li> I like all of the Davines products that I&#x27;ve purchased.  It&#x27;s not too expensive, but you can feel the difference the product makes.</li>
    <li> My hair is about waist length right now and I&#x27;ve been using this product for about a year now and it&#x27;s wonderful. It&#x27;s untangles and leaves my hair super sleek and soft. Just amazing product, I would pay to get this sent to me all the way from Italy if worst came to worst and I couldn&#x27;t find it here in the U.S.</li>
    <li> I am on the second bottle of this product now. My stylist used to use this at the salon and I kept postponing to buy it as its so expensive. I tried it when it went on sale at the salon.&lt;br /&gt;I have very dry thinning hair with  dry scalp. All other products I tried to strengthen my hair left residue causing more build up and flakes. One set of this shampoo and conditioner lasted for 3 months with 3-4 washes a week.&lt;br /&gt;When I ran out, I couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere on a deal. I switched to Loreal strengthening shampoo that came out recently. After 2 washes flakes returned. So I decided to spend more and buy this fom Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;Just after a wash flakes are gone and my hair has become soft again. I wouldn&#x27;t take another chance.Will stick with Melu even though is pricey.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have seen comments about the smell. I like the smell, it is very light. I have to admit that I do not know how men&#x27;s public restroom smells like.</li>
    <li> Melu shampoo and conditioner was for my mom. She has very dry fine long hair. She finally tried melu for the first time and fell in love with it! She says that it make her hair so soft. The only thing she didn&#x27;t like is the smell. She says it has a not so good floral smell.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s official - I thoroughly dislike this brand. I&#x27;ve tried several of the products and not one of them delivers - or even comes close to delivering - the claims made.&lt;br /&gt;The scent is awful - unable to describe  but certainly unappealing!&lt;br /&gt;Didn&#x27;t soften my hair one bit. Rather it felt amazing during use in the shower, but as my hair dried...  Well, it was in worse condition than before I used this stuff! I have no idea how its possible to make such an awful product, sell it for an insane amount, and still have people thinking its God&#x27;s gift.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m done experimenting, Terax is my choice!&lt;br /&gt;Worse, I&#x27;ve tried 5 products in the Davines line and none of the containers are even full! And the containers for the conditioner (strange little tub, like deli potato salad is packaged in) is so not practical. Cute? Yes! Workable? No!&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re determined to try this, I&#x27;d fine a salon that sells it and get a sample first. Otherwise, like me you&#x27;ll end up feeling really ripped off and stuck with hair care products you can&#x27;t use.</li>
    <li> My experience, since I bought it retail previously, is that it is diluted; so the value seemed great but it won&#x27;t last as long.  Your choice.</li>
    <li> My salon in NYC used this shampoo and I have been using it ever since. You only need a little of the conditioner - it takes the tangles out beautifully. Worth the money to be sure.</li>
