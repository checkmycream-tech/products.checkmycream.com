      <li>I have tried making my own.  </li>
      <li>I sometimes spritz some on my face and body as a kind of toner.</li>
      <li>This stuff is really strong but its amazing!</li>
      <li>The fact that it is so utterly natural is wonderful as most of these room sprays wreak havoc with my allergies.  </li>
      <li>Since I bought this in person, I was able to smell it before hand.</li>
      <li>spray it mostly on my clothes,&lt;br /&gt;And</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve try a better brand of this type of spray.</li>
      <li>I spray it on my pillow every night at bedtime and it smells great and is very relaxing.</li>
      <li>I love spraying some on my pillow before bed.</li>
      <li>This is the most authentic smelling lavender spray I have found.</li>
      <li>Love it</li>
      <li>I love my spray and it works well.</li>

      <li>This is the best essential oil ever.</li>
      <li>She has ordered two more.</li>
      <li>yes i bought this because i make the bathroom stanky in more ways that one</li>
      <li>but I love the mist and smell.  </li>
      <li>Love this spray.</li>
      <li>Many times have had those around me</li>
      <li>&#x27;I love the smell...&#x27; and not look to me for the answer.  </li>
      <li>I love the mist and smell.  </li>
      <li>I have tried many different brands and I have found this one to be the best.</li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>I would recommend this product to anyone who loves the smell and the calm evoked by good lavender.</li>
      <li>Beautiful lavender aroma, nice and strong to start, but doesn&#x27;t hang in the air very long at all (15 min?), nor does it stick around on fabric.</li>
      <li>Hopefully, it will relax you and make you sleep more soundly.  </li>
      <li>Not too strong, and VERY MUCH a TRUE scent of Lavender!</li>
      <li>This stuff has a strong lavender smell, which can be overbearing.  </li>
      <li>I love things that make me feel special and don&#x27;t cost a lot.</li>
      <li>I bought a couple of bottles out of curiosity and was really pleased to find it leaves a very refreshing, clean, vibrant scent.</li>
      <li>Otherwise, I&#x27;m in love with it, and I&#x27;m guessing I&#x27;ll run out fairly quickly.</li>
      <li>This is an excellent refresher for third-day hair, post-workout refreshment, or any time you need a little lavender scented lift.</li>
      <li>Some don&#x27;t smell as nice and are diluted too much.</li>
      <li>I can open a drawer weeks after I have treated my laundry, and am greeted with a pleasant lavender scent.</li>
      <li>The scent is not as strong, nor quite as pleasant as my old lavender pillow mist, but it has served me very well.</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s delightful for the few minutes right after you spray it on your linens.</li>
      <li>True lavender smell.</li>
      <li>A very reasonable replacement for my old favorite!</li>
      <li>This lavender mist is simple, authentic, clean.  </li>
      <li>Smells wonderful, just wish the scent would last a little longer.</li>
      <li>We really like the smell, better than some other lavender I tried, and it has become such a nice part of bedtime!</li>
      <li>I think it has something to do with the sprayer, because after the first couple pumps, the smell wasn&#x27;t in the rest.</li>
      <li>Will definitely be back for more.</li>
      <li>This spray works perfectly to provide a natural sleep aid, with just a few quick squirts into the air above my pillow.</li>
      <li>I rather reluctantly bought this lavender spray when my beloved pillow mist from Le Couvent de Minimes became increasingly more difficult to find.</li>
      <li>Has a chemical smell...not sweet and soothing like a brand I bought at the Mall near here.</li>
      <li>I spray it on my pillows and my face as I lie in bed ...getting ready to fall asleep.  </li>
      <li>Would recommend to anyone and price is reasonable.</li>
      <li>and it really helps.</li>
      <li>Lavender is even said to have antiseptic properties (among it&#x27;s many other uses).</li>
      <li>I use it as an air freshener, to mist my pillows and my clean laundry before I put it away, and I take it with me on trips to treat hotel beds to get rid of the funky hotel room smell (and to possibly discourage bedbugs).</li>
      <li>-----------short-lived, after a few seconds ,so if you spray the cushion it for a better fall asleep&lt;</li>
      <li>its a nice, subtle scent.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s scent is natural, and not over powering.</li>
      <li>It is much cheaper and does contain actual lavender, too, though!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a blend of 3 different lavender oils and water, so pretty simple.</li>

    <li> The container was- dent...fortunately do not mind it does not leaking&lt;br /&gt;...I love the mist and smell.  it will relax you -is intense.&lt;br /&gt;but -----------short-lived, after a few seconds ,so if you spray the cushion it for a better fall asleep&lt;br /&gt;you need to try harder to fall asleep quickly:)&lt;br /&gt;because the duration of the smell is quite short&lt;br /&gt;using it -on a yoga meditation.....</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve try a better brand of this type of spray. the price was cheaper for this one...but you can tell it is.....</li>
    <li> Great !  Smells awesome and was delivered quickly</li>
    <li> This lavender mist is simple, authentic, clean.  I have tried making my own.  Have tried purchasing from local lavender farms.  Not sure how it is done...but I love the mist and smell.  Many times have had those around me comment...&#x27;I love the smell...&#x27; and not look to me for the answer.  It is really a nice product.  Have discovered and using for over 10 years.</li>
    <li> A few sprays each night on my pillow and sheets before bed, and I sleep all night! Not too strong, and VERY MUCH a TRUE scent of Lavender!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay&lt;br /&gt;Came dented&lt;br /&gt;Put still stayed with it&lt;br /&gt;Smells Good&lt;br /&gt;I spray it mostly on my clothes,&lt;br /&gt;And my bed</li>

    <li> This spray works perfectly to provide a natural sleep aid, with just a few quick squirts into the air above my pillow.</li>
    <li> I use this every night before bed--I spray it on my bed linens and pillows. It&#x27;s so relaxing--and not overbearing like some lavender sprays can be.</li>
    <li> I spray it on my pillows and my face as I lie in bed ...getting ready to fall asleep.  I also spray it on my blankets and sheets!  I already bought another one so I don&#x27;t run out.</li>
    <li> I would recommend this product to anyone who loves the smell and the calm evoked by good lavender. It&#x27;s scent is natural, and not over powering. It is wonderful for freshening your bedding for guests as well as to promote a relaxing state for yourself just before you drift off to sleep.

    <li> What a great scent! This is an excellent refresher for third-day hair, post-workout refreshment, or any time you need a little lavender scented lift. I use this all the time and absolutely love it!</li>
    <li> This is my favorite lavender bed/body spray! Some don&#x27;t smell as nice and are diluted too much. This brand is really good, I use it for everything and never travel without it. I use it on my pillow, bedding, bathroom towels, or on my legs if I&#x27;m going outdoors/water my yard.</li>
    <li> Beautiful lavender aroma, nice and strong to start, but doesn&#x27;t hang in the air very long at all (15 min?), nor does it stick around on fabric.</li>
    <li> I like to keep a bottle of this in the bathroom... its a nice, subtle scent.</li>
    <li> I ordered this after my daughter s&#x27;s pediatrician recommended using lavender as part of the bedtime routine.  We really like the smell, better than some other lavender I tried, and it has become such a nice part of bedtime!</li>
    <li> This product is akin to acid. The container leaked and left a permanent ring in the finish of my dresser that is a 16th of an inch deep. Imagine what that would do to your skin!</li>
    <li> This is the best essential oil ever. I am using it with a diffuser and also wear it at the pulse points...cannot find a better brand of this. Send perfectly packed as this oil should be!</li>
    <li> I plan to never be without this product on hand if I can help it! I bought a couple of bottles out of curiosity and was really pleased to find it leaves a very refreshing, clean, vibrant scent. It&#x27;s basically 2 or 3 types of lavender oil and purified water, so I spray it all over the house, on furniture, clothing, inside shoes, and anywhere that needs a spritz of freshening up. Lavender is even said to have antiseptic properties (among it&#x27;s many other uses). And the best part--no chemicals or added perfumes. I sometimes spritz some on my face and body as a kind of toner. Be careful spraying it directly on fabrics, since it does contain oils...although I haven&#x27;t seen a stain anywhere I&#x27;ve sprayed. And as always, test on a small patch of skin before using on your face or all over.</li>
    <li> My mom loves this and sprays it on her sheets.</li>
    <li> I keep this spray by my bed and spritz about a half hour before I go to sleep. The relaxing beneift of lavender is lovely to drift off with and get a good nights sleep.</li>
    <li> This stuff has a strong lavender smell, which can be overbearing.  But I SWEAR it keeps mice away.  I&#x27;ve sprayed it on my door frames and windows to keep spiders and mice out of the house and it WORKS so well.  Haven&#x27;t seen one mouse in 3 years and spiders stay outside.</li>
    <li> I spray this everywhere in my house, including myself, my husband and our dog!!  Additionally I mist our sheets with it at night.  The fact that it is so utterly natural is wonderful as most of these room sprays wreak havoc with my allergies.  No sneezing  here and the bonus of every room in my house smells delightful.</li>
    <li> Smells wonderful, just wish the scent would last a little longer.</li>
    <li> This stuff is really strong but its amazing!</li>
    <li> I purchased this at my local farmer&#x27;s market. It smells great-just like lavender essential oil. It&#x27;s a blend of 3 different lavender oils and water, so pretty simple. Since I bought this in person, I was able to smell it before hand. I untwisted the lid to smell it, and all was great. When I got home, I sprayed it, and I did notice a vinegar like smell. I think it has something to do with the sprayer, because after the first couple pumps, the smell wasn&#x27;t in the rest. Otherwise, I&#x27;m in love with it, and I&#x27;m guessing I&#x27;ll run out fairly quickly.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this spray! I just bought my 3rd bottle. I use it every night before I go to sleep and it really helps. True lavender smell. Not over powering. Great price.</li>
    <li> Love it but it arrived all bent and damaged.</li>
    <li> I use this on my dog. He has the kind of coat that pick up every smell around. It&#x27;s nice to have him smelling good between baths. I just have to be careful to cover his eyes when I spray it on him.</li>
