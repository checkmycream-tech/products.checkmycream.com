<li> The makeup spatulas were what I expected.</li>
<li> and it&#x27;s too messy to mix on the back of your hand.</li>
<li> Not as expected and I don&#x27;t use it..</li>
<li> i think its a little pricy because i have gotten cheaper products for same quality from other suppliers.</li>
<li> I bought this for the spatula because I use a foundation that comes in a little pot.  </li>
<li> Yes it took a few weeks to deliver</li>
<li> I thougt I would be getting a small piece of metal.</li>
<li> Yay, no more yellowing of the nail and skin from mixing vitamin C powder.</li>
<li> And it&#x27;s very heavy.</li>
<li> You can use the spatula to scoop out the product (at least that&#x27;s how I do it).</li>

    <li> Easy to mix my foundation on...since I am in between most colors and easy to wash and sanitize...this is used instead of the back of my hand!!</li>
    <li> I bought this for the spatula because I use a foundation that comes in a little pot.  I love this spatula because I can control the amount I need.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s also very handy for mixing colors of makeup of various kinds.  Great little tool.</li>
    <li> Love it. Very cute, compact and durable. I like the included spatula.</li>
    <li> Way larger than i would&#x27;ve thought! Fast shipping, good price. + excited to start mixing some unique lip colors!</li>
    <li> It shipped out really fast and works perfectly for my kit it also comes with a plastic holder for it. Very pleased with it.</li>
    <li> Love this for mixing my foundations for a flawless face!</li>
    <li> Love this set.  Took a while for me to get it but it was worth the wait. It&#x27;s good quality and it came in a cute pouch. I am looking forward to blending foundations with this.</li>
    <li> This item was delivered very quickly. It was exactly as described and incredible for the price. I&#x27;ve been using this for a very long and don&#x27;t seem to have any problems! It&#x27;s a must have for makeup artists out there. The two ended spatula allows you to pick up any product and easily mix it onto the stainless steel palette. It&#x27;s also very easy to clean, what I usually do is wipe it down with rubbing alcohol.</li>
    <li> This looks just like the picture (with the thumb hole and spatula). It even came with a clear vinyl pouch that has a pockets for the palette and spatula. That was a nice bonus since it&#x27;s not in the product description. The palette looks the same on both sides and has a good weight to it. It&#x27;s very handy when you&#x27;re in between foundation shades and it&#x27;s too messy to mix on the back of your hand.</li>
    <li> This was larger than I had expected, but it works great!  It&#x27;s easier to mix cosmetic products with this than in the palm of your hand.  Yay, no more yellowing of the nail and skin from mixing vitamin C powder.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I needed for a great price!</li>
    <li> I use this to mix makeup and to apply makeup instead of applying it directly from the original containers. As a makeup artist this allows for me to keep my products sanitary.</li>
    <li> I love that i can just add my product right to this and apply my Makeup. You get both the palette and a spatula. Both have some weight to them. The spatula is a great tool to have when needing to retrieve that last bit of makeup.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure what happened with the reviewer who said the palette was missing the hole, but mine arrived exactly as pictured. It actually feels and looks higher quality than I expected. Stainless steel has a good weight to it and is useful for so many things. And, as another reviewer noted, it also comes with a vinyl pouch with a separate compartment for the spatula, which is a nice touch.</li>
    <li> This item is great for drama or makeup students.  It is good quality and arrived as described and on time as promised.</li>
    <li> Great for blending.  Excellent tool.  A must have if you like to blend your colors before applying.  Fun!!!!</li>
    <li> Perfect size, easy to use. Love the double ended spatula. Only one thing I noticed is, it&#x27;s a little heavier, than I thought it was going to be. Might be because, I&#x27;m still getting use to it. However, still pleased with my purchase!</li>
    <li> This is perfect for mixing foundation, concealer and lip color, etc. I was using a lid from an old jar of hair gel or the back of my hand and finger to mix. Very durable, I will definitely be using it daily. I am truly pleased with my purchase. Thank you!!!</li>
    <li> The makeup spatulas were what I expected. The makeup palette however was just a small sheet of metal with no hole, therefore making the picture very deceiving. It is still useable and a good fit for a woman&#x27;s hand but NOT what I expected.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always wanted this set and didn&#x27;t know I could buy one.  Came upon this while shopping on Amazon and it works perfectly.  I mix some moisturizer and foundation (sometimes 2 shades) together to make my exact concoction; perfect.  Easy to clean too.</li>
    <li> i think its a little pricy because i have gotten cheaper products for same quality from other suppliers.</li>
    <li> I just received this item today, however, it took a long time getting to me, and I love it.</li>
    <li> Wow, it is waaayyyy bigger than I thought it would be. I thougt I would be getting a small piece of metal. But nope! It&#x27;s huge! I love it! And it&#x27;s very heavy. The spatula is so handy as well. Especially if you have foundations that don&#x27;t have a pump. You can use the spatula to scoop out the product (at least that&#x27;s how I do it). I would definitely recommend this product!</li>
    <li> My niece is a Hollywood makeup artist. These were the prefect gift.  She loved the size and weight.  I may buy one for myself.  Great if  you mix your foundations.</li>
    <li> Yes it took a few weeks to deliver but this is the best quality I have ever had of these.. Bought a few cheap ones here in Ststaes.. Usually scrape easily or bend easy.. This is strong and the spatula is perfect!</li>
    <li> I love it! It&#x27;s easy to clean too. I have no complaints.</li>
    <li> I love this.  I use it with all my makeup applications and it is easy to clean without water.  (Just wipe dry and there you go!)</li>
    <li> Not as expected and I don&#x27;t use it..</li>
    <li> Love the palette, it is very good qualty. It was not flimsy at all, lime another one I own. Plus having the spatula with it was a bonus!</li>
