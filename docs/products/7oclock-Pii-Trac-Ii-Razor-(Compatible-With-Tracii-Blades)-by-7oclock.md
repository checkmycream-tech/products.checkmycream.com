      <li>Love this razor.</li>
      <li>LOVE IT and can&#x27;t beat the price and money</li>

      <li>This would probably be OK, except for the price.</li>
      <li>I am pleased with the razor.</li>
      <li>so I am so glad I found this product.</li>
      <li>that is heavier duty and feels better in the hand.  </li>
      <li>kinda cheap ... very light weight</li>
      <li>old one wore out great razor</li>
      <li>He was very pleased when I was able to locate a vendor for this particular razor.  </li>
      <li>Pleased with original purchase so just ordered another.</li>
      <li>Works great - even better than my last one.  </li>
      <li>It is lightweight, so easy to take for travel.</li>
      <li>easy to hold.</li>
      <li>My husband love these much better than the four blade ones and the price if right.</li>
      <li>this works just fine.  </li>
      <li>so it is alot lighter, but it works just fine</li>
      <li>As others have mentioned, the blade that comes with it is pretty much junk, but I am happy to have the handle.</li>
      <li>Smooth, easy to use, fits blades available in discount stores</li>
      <li>My husband used another Trac razor and picked up blades he thought would fit.</li>
      <li>I rated the unit a 3 star -primarily because it was constructed of lighter (plastic) material than I thought I was buying.  </li>
      <li>Cheap plastic,</li>
      <li>Cheap flimsy plastic.</li>
      <li>I was delighted to find that it not only looks like the old one, but the old blades, which I purchased through Amazon, match perfectly.</li>
      <li>I have retired my original to &amp;#34;spare&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;Travel&amp;#34; status.</li>
      <li>Product was in original packaging an goog working</li>
      <li>Works and feels just like my original Trac II handle</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using the original Gillette Trac II Rasor for more than 25 years and after purchasing the 7 O&#x27;Clock Rasor I compared the two Razors And can honestly say they are of the same quality</li>
      <li>It arrived quickly.  </li>
      <li>Finally did the long overdue upgrade to the Gillette Fusion Pro and it is excellent.</li>
      <li>The only thing that could make it better would be if the handle was metal, but it&#x27;s fine the way it is.</li>
      <li>Well worth the price.</li>
      <li>On time at the right price.</li>
      <li>It didn&#x27;t have the swivel effect the older handle had, but it did fit with the blades.</li>
      <li>An OK product overall.</li>
      <li>I couldn&#x27;t believe that I didn&#x27;t think of checking there first.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s just a glorified disposable, slightly higher quality than the cheapest ones.</li>
      <li>This is a chrome version of the original 1970&#x27;s brass &amp;#34;Trac II&amp;#34; razor system I grew up with as a young man.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s light (plastic), and the blade is not very sharp.</li>
      <li>like I said above, the unit works fine.  </li>
      <li>Would have liked a little heavier handle</li>
      <li>Highly recommended if you want nearly an exact replacement.</li>
      <li>Fast delivery and works really well</li>
      <li>I find that the blade wants to slide out too easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Fast shipping too.</li>
      <li>Fast delivery.</li>
      <li>Shipping was fairly quick and no other issues.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used a Trac II razor since they first came on the market, but needed a new one for my travel bag.  </li>
      <li>A lot cheaper to use, and the shave is just as good as the more expensive ones!  </li>
      <li>Bought the wrong blades at the store and didn&#x27;t want to throw them away; glad I was able to find this at decent price.</li>
      <li>Great handle, well made, you cant go wrong with this handle.</li>
      <li>After years of my wife buying me the wrong kind of blade at the drug store (I&#x27;ve have an Atra since I was 15), I ended up with a drawer full or Trac II blades.  </li>
      <li>Pretty much the same handle as what came with the Trac II decades ago.</li>
      <li>Exactly the same - the chrome-work, the ridges under the handle to hold it steady.  </li>
      <li>but I immediately removed it and slid a new blade into the frame.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Low price on hard-to-find item.</li>
    <li> This is a Track II handle made by Gillette, made by their Gillette India Limited subsidiary.  So it is not a substitute for your old Track II handle - it IS a new Track II handle.  Exactly the same - the chrome-work, the ridges under the handle to hold it steady.  And naturally the Gillette blades fit perfectly.</li>
    <li> If you have trac two blades left but misplaced your razor...this works just fine.  Well worth the price.</li>
    <li> It was just what I needed.  My husband had a buncl of tracII blades and I might as well use them.</li>
    <li> Great razor. The only thing that could make it better would be if the handle was metal, but it&#x27;s fine the way it is.</li>
    <li> My husband love these much better than the four blade ones and the price if right.</li>
    <li> I am enjoying using this blade handle.  Well-made handle, using with Trac-II type razors.</li>
    <li> My husband is Thrilled, thrilled, thrilled</li>
    <li> Wanted Atra II; got Trac II. My mistake and what a difference in shaving results.</li>
    <li> exactly what I wanted, expected.</li>
    <li> After years of my wife buying me the wrong kind of blade at the drug store (I&#x27;ve have an Atra since I was 15), I ended up with a drawer full or Trac II blades.  I bought this razor so I could consume that massive stockpile.  Now I will never have to buy another razor or blade again for the rest of my life.</li>
    <li> Great product fits track 2and clone blades</li>
    <li> Great, I love Trac II and when my handle broke I thought I was going to have to find a new razor, apparently Gillette doesn&#x27;t make Trac II handles anymore so I am so glad I found this product.</li>
    <li> I was happy to find this - and to discover that it&#x27;s as good or better than my original. As others have mentioned, the blade that comes with it is pretty much junk, but I am happy to have the handle. I have retired my original to &amp;#34;spare&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;Travel&amp;#34; status.</li>
    <li> Works with trac II as advertised.</li>
    <li> Love this razor. Gives close shave without the nicks and cuts of a safety razor.</li>
    <li> Cheap plastic, but it holds the blades so it works !  Would have liked a little heavier handle but you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used a Trac II razor since they first came on the market, but needed a new one for my travel bag.  This is perfect and it arrived early which was a wonderful surprise.</li>
    <li> It broke at the neck while sliding to load a new razor blade. Finally did the long overdue upgrade to the Gillette Fusion Pro and it is excellent.</li>
    <li> Not impressed with product- even less impressed with seller!</li>
    <li> Arrived much quicker than I expected. Product was in original packaging an goog working order.&lt;br /&gt;Worth the price because the amount of money that can be saved with the trac ll blades is enormous. ..</li>
    <li> After using this razor for a while, I&#x27;m not very impressed. It&#x27;s light (plastic), and the blade is not very sharp. Even when it was new, I had to go over my face twice, and I don&#x27;t have a particularly thick or wiry beard. I find that the blade wants to slide out too easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s just a glorified disposable, slightly higher quality than the cheapest ones.</li>
    <li> The razor came with a blade in place but I immediately removed it and slid a new blade into the frame.  The fit was perfect.  I am very pleased.</li>
    <li> Perfect fit for Trac ll blades. I had 20 new blades when my old old Trac ll deceided to break in two. Looked all over for a replacement and found  this one. It is plastic so it is alot lighter, but it works just fine and I can use my existing blades and save a few bucks.</li>
    <li> Not much to say about a razor. It is as described. Two good features; 1. It is lightweight, so easy to take for travel. 2. This slide in feature is far less likely to disengage than the other double razor with the clip in. If you are looking for a double razor, as opposed for the 3-4-5- razors, then this does the job. At home I first use the triple razor for getting the majority off fast, but then I have to follow up with the double razor, as it is all but impossible to get to the nooks and crannies with any 2+ razors.</li>
    <li> Just what I wanted. perfect.</li>
    <li> Worked great, had many blades and no razor for them, now I have the razor, and it has worked great.</li>
    <li> been using this same razor for years and too old to try something new…couldn&#x27;t find this razor anywhere else so thank you amazon.  I might even get the gold one in addition..</li>
    <li> My husband used another Trac razor and picked up blades he thought would fit. They did not. So I ordered this handle for the new blades.</li>
    <li> Received my new Trac II Razor and have used it to shave the past few days.  Works great - even better than my last one.  Glad to have a replacement for my old razor which finally broke due to metal fatigue.  Very satisfied with my purchase.</li>
    <li> My husband&#x27;s old razor had finally broken and locally we could not find this style.  He had plenty of blade cartridge refills, but now no razor.  :(  Also the newer style razors are more expensive.  He was very pleased when I was able to locate a vendor for this particular razor.  Fast shipping too.</li>
    <li> A VERY GOOD RAZOR NO PROBLEMS IT DOES WORK WITH OTHER TRAC ll BLADES I&#x27;VE BEEN USING TRAC ll since they came out</li>
    <li> My husband and I have used the TRAC II razor for the last 20 years....it&#x27;s a simple design, and easy to hold.</li>
    <li> Was not compatible with Trac II razor blades. Total waste of money!</li>
    <li> Great item. Took a little while to arrive however the end result was very positive.</li>
    <li> I rated the unit a 3 star -primarily because it was constructed of lighter (plastic) material than I thought I was buying.  That does not mean it is a poor razor but rather one that slightly disappointed me.  The razor cuts well, holds trac II blades as advertised.  I was mildly disappointed the razor blades did not pivot however like I said above, the unit works fine.  Shipping was fairly quick and no other issues.  An OK product overall.</li>
    <li> I lost my old Gillette razor while on a trip.  Could not find one anywhere in stores.  Ordered this one because of reviews.  It arrived quickly.  Perfect fit for my old Trac ll blades.</li>
    <li> Finally, a good razor without all the hype of 5 blades... 7 blades... etc.  A lot cheaper to use, and the shave is just as good as the more expensive ones!  Refill blades are a lot less expensive too!</li>
    <li> It was great to find my hubbys favorite razor as its not in stores any longer.</li>
    <li> Great razor - smooth shave.</li>
    <li> my husband liked it alot. said it did the job.</li>
    <li> not all that great .... kinda cheap ... very light weight</li>
    <li> Do Not Buy!............&lt;br /&gt;Takes 30-45 days to receive from India.</li>
    <li> Great handle, well made, you cant go wrong with this handle.</li>
    <li> It worked perfectly, and hubby was very happy to be able to use all of the cartridges he had.  Thank you!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the original Gillette Trac II Rasor for more than 25 years and after purchasing the 7 O&#x27;Clock Rasor I compared the two Razors And can honestly say they are of the same quality and I am very happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> These old razors are head &amp; shoulders ahead of the newer ones.  Long as I can still get the blades - this is my shave of choice.</li>
    <li> I have to agree with Mr. Bill Thomas - this is basically a disposable razor that you can replace the blade. Cheap flimsy plastic. This would probably be OK, except for the price. Let&#x27;s see - $9.85, minus $2.00 for packing/shipping, minus $0.50 for the razor &#x3D; $7.35 profit for BeautyMart.&lt;br /&gt;On the upside, it does hold my old Trac II Plus blades..</li>
    <li> Great inexpensive choice razor...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No complaints</li>
    <li> Smooth, easy to use, fits blades available in discount stores</li>
    <li> excellent performance</li>
    <li> Bought the wrong blades at the store and didn&#x27;t want to throw them away; glad I was able to find this at decent price.</li>
    <li> I recently purchased a 7 O&#x27;Clock Razor after losing my old (20 year +) Gillette Trac II while on vacation.  I was delighted to find that it not only looks like the old one, but the old blades, which I purchased through Amazon, match perfectly.</li>
    <li> old one wore out great razor</li>
    <li> There is nothing wrong with this handle.  My mom&#x27;s last one(same exact thing) lasted her over 20 yrs.  Its just that there is a generic handle being sold through Amazon for about a dollar less that is heavier duty and feels better in the hand.  Get this one or that one and I think you are doing pretty well, but I have to recommend the generic one over this one.</li>
    <li> Great item.  Pleased with original purchase so just ordered another.</li>
    <li> I was a little worried that the Trac II razors I had stocked up on earlier wouldn&#x27;t fit this after market handle.  They work great and I&#x27;m very happy with the razor.</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t have the swivel effect the older handle had, but it did fit with the blades.</li>
    <li> Works and feels just like my original Trac II handle I gave my grandson and he still uses that one. Decided to start shaving again after many years and this is what I like over the newer more expense junk out today.</li>
    <li> Perfect just what I wanted</li>
    <li> This is a chrome version of the original 1970&#x27;s brass &amp;#34;Trac II&amp;#34; razor system I grew up with as a young man.</li>
    <li> Works great. You can buy blades at Dollar General. I like safety razors the best but this does a good job if you like shaving with cartridge type.</li>
    <li> I looked for weeks in the stores when my wife&#x27;s broke (it was 30 years old.) Then I thought of looking where I get my blades. I couldn&#x27;t believe that I didn&#x27;t think of checking there first.</li>
    <li> On time at the right price.</li>
    <li> Yippie.  Finally found a replacement for my old Trac II which is about 30 years old.  Never tried one of those 3+ blade razors, and want to postpone spending the bucks as long as possible.  Plus I&#x27;m just plain stubborn.  What&#x27;s the big whoop about 3+ blade razors.  LOL</li>
    <li> LOVE IT and can&#x27;t beat the price and money I&#x27;m gonna save on blade&#x27;s now</li>
    <li> My husband loves this razor. He recommend it to his friend who also purchased one. I could only find them on line. Good quality and price.</li>
    <li> I could not find a TRAC II blade compatible razor in the local stores and I did look for a month.  I am pleased with the razor.</li>
    <li> Fast delivery and works really well</li>
    <li> This product is similar and comparable to &amp;#34;original metal head G2 &amp;#34;. I wanted a non- swivel twin blade and this meets my expectation.</li>
    <li> This is the best purchase I&#x27;ve made from Amazon so far. It works and fits perfectly the way it was designed.</li>
    <li> Fast delivery. no problem!</li>
    <li> Had been looking for this particular razor for my husband for a long time.  He&#x27;s happy now!</li>
    <li> Nice product even though it&#x27;s plastic. Pretty much the same handle as what came with the Trac II decades ago. Highly recommended if you want nearly an exact replacement.</li>
    <li> EXCELLENT! My dad has this razor too (the Trac ll) and had it for years. Those current razors out there (Mach lll, Fusion, Sensor) are GARBAGE &amp; blades are too expensive. You can get blades for the Trac ll or Atra cheaper AND YOU GET THE BEST SHAVE EVER! I told my dad after I bought this &amp; used it that it was the best shave I ever had..</li>
    <li> works well, blade slides off unexpectently</li>
    <li> Just like old times. Excellent product. This won&#x27;t be my last one.</li>
