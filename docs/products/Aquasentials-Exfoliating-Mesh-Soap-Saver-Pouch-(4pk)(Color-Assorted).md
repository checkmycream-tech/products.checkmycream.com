<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Did the job. It was good that it comes as a multi pack because they break easily. Also got a strange rash that possibly was related.</li>
    <li> Love these mesh bags.  Put your bar soap of choice in and use bag as a scrubby, exfoliating!  Soap suds up great in these bags.  Rise and hang to allow soap to dry keeping your soap out of water and lasting longer!</li>
    <li> Exactly what I was looking for.  I use one for the gym and one at home to catch all the little soap remnants,  just like grandma did.</li>
    <li> These work well for putting a bar of soap in. In Hawaii I purchased a lot of local soaps and needed something better than a washcloth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Make sure to squeeze out all the water when you shower as they have poor airflow and will not dry quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A full size bar of soap will fit.</li>
    <li> Love these, and the price is right on these.</li>
    <li> Hard to get a lather going.</li>
    <li> Nice price, works great</li>
    <li> This is the first time I have tried this brand.  I have been using soap pouches for years and have never had this problem.  The bottom of the pouch opened up and the soap was coming out from the bottom.  I am mailing it back to Amazon and getting a refund.</li>
    <li> These bags will last several months &amp; are good exfoliators. Mine started to unravel, but still works. I like a previous reviewers tip to turn them inside out and sew them for longer lasting.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t let out enough soap so it takes a while to wash your whole body, but I guess thats kind of the point.</li>
    <li> These are very nice! Thicker than my last ones.</li>
    <li> Purchased as a replacement for one that I had for months or years. These last weeks to months. The layers come apart easily but since they are inexpensive and come in a multipack, I can&#x27;t complain much. The layers are interconnected so you can&#x27;t just remove one.  They are slightly long for a bar of soap. I&#x27;ve found that they stay closed relatively well for me. The closure tends to mold in my very moist shower so a quick Clorox spray keeps it clean. I use Dove soap only. It lathers very well and keeps me feeling quite clean as I expect. I would recommend.</li>
    <li> Only use with super sudsy soap.</li>
    <li> These pouches are thick, many layers.  They open easily and accept more than one bar or all your slivers of soap.  They suds up nicely but because of the thickness take a little extra time.  When it comes to scrubbing, they do the job.  What I don&#x27;t like is that the closure do not work at all.  If you don&#x27;t hold it just right, keeping the soap at the bottom then the top opens up and the soap falls out!  If they weren&#x27;t as long as they are, they would not be usable, but since I can use them, I give them 2.5 stars.</li>
    <li> I bought these wondering \\&quot;how large is large?\\&quot;.  These are the perfect size for bars of soap.  There&#x27;s a couple inches from the draw string to the top of the bar inside.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The drawstring closes tight and doesn&#x27;t open by itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These things are so hard to find that I bought 2 packages.</li>
    <li> Love having the foaming of the soap that comes from the sponge.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used loves of these scrubbers over the years. This set of four seemed like a great deal... if the quality had been better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first one I used started to come apart at the sealed end after only 2 days of use. I figure that I got a bad one from the set, so I just grabbed anther and put it into service. This one lasted six days. Seriously?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will spend more next time and hopefully get what I pay for.</li>
    <li> Okay quality, but very rough feeling to the point you are scraping your skin just to get the soap to foam and come through the pouch layers. Tried using one for a week or two. Threw the rest out</li>
    <li> Love these soap bags! I put the smaller pieces I would normally just toss. And it exfoliates as well!</li>
    <li> Just right for the large bars of Fresh brand soap.</li>
    <li> fast shipping, just as described</li>
    <li> products are great; because you&#x27;re using a soap bar it takes a minute of swirling the soap inside the thing to get it sudsy, but thereafter its exactly like having a loofah. Bought 2 packs and would/will again should those run out.</li>
    <li> Love these.  I love that you can even put your little soap slivers in with the new soap bar.</li>
    <li> Awesome!  I make my own soap and used to buy soap pouches like this from Walmart.  They don&#x27;t carry them anymore and I was devastated until I found these on Amazon.  Good quality, with excellent exfoliating mesh.  Will definitely purchase again.</li>
    <li> use these to put leftover soap in and use in shower. Great investment instead of throwing those little soap remnants away.</li>
    <li> Love these. They help save your soap by allowing it to dry and keep out of water by hanging to dry.  Helps your soap to lather more.</li>
    <li> Ah ...not so great.  Put soap in and takes a lot of work to lather up.</li>
    <li> These seem to last longer than some of the other soap bags I have had in the past. I like that you get 4 of them for the price.</li>
    <li> Painfully scratchy (hard plastic). Weird shape. Difficult to fit product into. Takes a lot of effort to get any lather.</li>
    <li> These are so awesome now I don&#x27;t have to worry about getting new ones for a while.</li>
    <li> They work well!  Wish they were a little bit shorter as they are a little unwieldy due to the length, but I am happy with them.</li>
    <li> Great as a gentle loofa. Love it because it is a fast and easy way to exfoliate without needing to pump soap onto it. Makes great lather.  Uses all your bars of soap completely. Great for little ones too. Soap does not slide out of their hands and they can use as exfoliation or just use the nice lather made and use their own little hands. Have been using for years and will use nothing else. No mildew collection either. Can last several months with regular use.  Little ones do seem to go through them faster.</li>
    <li> These make your soap last a long time.  I would highly recommend these.</li>
    <li> I would buy it again, but I find the shape is not ideal.  I end up with a long skinny &amp;#34;bar&amp;#34; of soap.  However, it&#x27;s great that it allows you to use up all of the soap!</li>
    <li> Too thick to get much lather - I tore them apart and reduced the thickness.</li>
    <li> The idea is great, however they are to thick for a regular sized soap bar to really suds out of them. With them being so thick and big it was also more difficult to handle in the shower.  I did read some of these same comments before I ordered them, but figured I&#x27;d give it a try anyway, wound up returning them also.  I would think if they were only 1/2 of the thickness and 3/4 of the overall height it would be much better to work with.</li>
    <li> A bit like using a pot scrubber in the shower. There is a huge knot of mesh at the bottom of the pouch. I avoid that area so it is wasted material that sucks up soap. The mesh is multilayer so it often rubs against itself rather than you. Inefficient and irritating. But they are cheap and they get the job done. I will try something else the next time. But I will not throw the remaining pouches out.</li>
    <li> I bought these to make sure we are using our bar soap to the end.  We currently only use all natural bar soap, and since it is so expensive, you definitely want to use it til it is completely finished. These do take care of that job.  They also work up a nice lather and serve as storage for the soap as well.  The problem with these is that the tie on the end comes lose almost every other time we use them so we are having to constantly tie and re-tie them.  Once, the tie came off in the middle of the night while it was hanging in my shower and scared me!!  We&#x27;ll keep using them since they last a long time, but will probably look for a different brand when it is time to reorder.</li>
    <li> Looked for these in the stores forever before deciding to find them on line. Happy to have found them. will know where to look if I need more.</li>
    <li> Nice colors and just what I wanted for my soap bars.  Would recommend this product Nothing more I can say</li>
    <li> fast shipping not best quality but ok for price</li>
    <li> I had a ton of fancy soaps that I kept buying and not using.  We&#x27;ve been pretty frugal lately and I want to buy some fancy shower gels, but can&#x27;t justify it with the soaps laying around.  These have been ok for that purpose.  With some effort I can generate a nice lather in a variety of bar soap types but then it goes away fast and I have to work at it again.  It&#x27;s nice to have the exfoliating feature with a bar soap, but given the choice, I would rather use a shower gel with a poof.  This is definitely better though than using a wash rag or the soap on a poof, for better exfoliation.</li>
    <li> I bought these so I can shower at the dorm without dropping my soap in the communal tub. Rope fits around wrist. Easy to grab with same hand to wash self then just let go without it falling in tub and you trying to pick up the slippery bar of soap. My mother also likes the idea no soap goes to waste.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only thing we both feel the mesh netting  would of been better with just 3/4 layers of mesh. There are several layers I&#x27;m guessing so it lasts. That&#x27;s why only 4 stars.&lt;br /&gt;Mesh is soft to the tough but a little scratchy.......don&#x27;t know if that will change with use.</li>
    <li> Good quality product.&lt;br /&gt;Arrived in great condition as advertised.</li>
    <li> These are sturdy and hold a decent size bar of soap!  Nice sturdy rope attached so you can hang in shower!</li>
    <li> I really like that my soap is no longer directly hit by the shower water, so it is lasting much much longer than before!  I also like that it exfoliates while cleaning.  My husband says that it does not get sudsy enough, so I rated it 4 stars, but I think it gets plenty sudsy.  And they&#x27;re cheap!  They also work well for using every last bit of your soap.  When I first used mine, I got three of my husband&#x27;s soaps that he thought were too small to use and they were perfect for fitting in the pouch.</li>
    <li> I mainly use this to put my almost gone used soap bars in and when I have two or three, then it&#x27;s great.</li>
    <li> I love these - great for camping</li>
    <li> Had one similar to this before and loved it.  These are a little different from the other one I owned.  These have just nylon pockets where the other one had a exfoliating side as well as a nylon (smoother) side.  However, these will do the job of keeping the small pieces of soap to use to the end quite well.</li>
    <li> Love these Aquasentials Exfolianting Mesh Soap Saver Pouch. It is very strong. I recommend them. It really save on soap. These colors are beautiful.</li>
    <li> Cheap and it good enough</li>
    <li> Does exactly what it&#x27;s supposed to do. I like this 4 pack because I have several different luxury soaps and I like to switch them around before I use a whole bar up. So I keep the soaps in these different little pouches. Not only do they add extra suds, but they preserve the bars. You can hang them up to dry by the little strings on the end. Plus, they gently exfoliate. Really good purchase.</li>
    <li> I wanted something to use all my soap scraps up.  I like to buy handmade soaps and hate wasting the precious scraps.  This mesh pouch really works well for that use.  I put a few scraps in and it lathered up wonderfully.  I love that you get 4 mesh in the package.  The only downside I have is that the mesh is rather rough.  I am all for a good exfoliation but not every time I shower.  But it&#x27;s not a huge deal and the price on these is great.  I definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> These are a bit large and the rope is too small for the adjustable closure.  It slides down and the pouch opens easily making it difficult to use.  Not sure how this could pass their QA check.</li>
    <li> These contraptions are a great idea, but unfortunately, they are hard to use to actually wash your body.  They are rough and not puffy enough like a loufah to make it easy to get areas like your back.  They do seem to hold the soap just fine though.  I will continue to use them; however, after they&#x27;re worn out, I will probably just go back to using a washcloth.</li>
    <li> It is fairly difficult to get the lather going through this pouch and it has a large accumulation of the material on the bottom of the pouch that doesn&#x27;t help the function of the bag.  With that said, it was fairly priced for what you got.</li>
    <li> The first 2 I used had broken strings/plastic pieces within 2 days! I&#x27;m sorry I ordered 3 packs of these. And the strings won&#x27;t even hold a knot.</li>
    <li> I am so happy with these.  I buy a lot of fancy soaps from companies like Fortune Cookie Soap and Lush.  Sometimes they can be odd shapes and hard to hold on to.  These work great for any size or shape.  In addition, I they work for the jellies I purchase from Lush, Just cut a large piece of your jelly and stick it inside...no more slipping down the drain.  I would recommend to anyone looking to use irregular shaped soaps or jellies</li>
    <li> Works well, kind of rough at first but after a few uses it seems to have gotten to the right level of roughness to exfoliate but not be uncomfortable. The soap stays inside, no problems.</li>
    <li> Not a bad product all in all. They tend to fall apart fairly fast, but that&#x27;s not really an issue. Luffa&#x27;s aren&#x27;t ment to last very long and should be replaced monthly as it is. I love the way they hold my bar soap, a regular luffa can&#x27;t compare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I plan to buy more.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t care this product.  I felt it had to much material so it took a long time to lather and it was hard to keep it lathered.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I was looking for. No more wash cloths. Just put soap inside mesh bag, tie it up, and start lathering your body.</li>
    <li> Saw this at a friends house and wanted some for myself. Just like a normal loofa, it becomes &amp;#34;looser&amp;#34; after you use it for a while. Love this!</li>
    <li> Works very good. I save up the small leftover soap, stuff it in the pouch and when it is full I use it. Enough said. It works!</li>
    <li> These are soooo great! I use them all of the time!  I prefer bar soap because I am allergic to a lot of scents but I hate all the soap gunk that comes with it.  This not only gets rid of that but it makes your soap last way longer.  It&#x27;s way cheaper than buying body wash and it allows you to use more natural cleaning options, like goat&#x27;s milk soap. :)  These are great!</li>
    <li> Much rougher than previous ones I ordered!</li>
    <li> These are great for my bar soaps. Especially for travel. I put one loaded with soap in a ziplock and it&#x27;s easy to exfoliate while away from home. Also extends the life of the soap bar!</li>
    <li> Not my favorite but it serves it purpose. I would like it if it helped really exfoliate more but its okay for now.</li>
    <li> These soap sacks are large enough, but the string is too short to fit over the shower knob.  If the string was a couple inches longer, they&#x27;d be perfect.  How about some different colors?</li>
    <li> Not rough on the skin.  Soaps up nicely.</li>
    <li> These are nice, no more little pieces of soap left over.</li>
    <li> Slider thing falls off  making it so you can no longer close the pouch. This product is inexpensive but doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
    <li> Exfoliating soap pouches work very well.  Will buy again.  Also extra large so it fits all kinds of soap.  Constructed well so will not break in a couple of uses.</li>
    <li> These are much smaller than I expected and the material is not as soft as other loofa types like this that I have used before. Drawstring comes untied quickly and the plastic string holder gave out inside of a week.</li>
    <li> Nice set for the family, we each get our own color this way.</li>
    <li> These are wonderful. A modern answer to an age old problem: what to do with soap ends.  I would recommend these to anyone.</li>
    <li> makes our soap just disappear! not what i want at all.</li>
    <li> Maybe it depends on the type of soap you use, but I have a hard time getting very much lather to come through the layers of mesh. Additionally, the mesh is a bit too rough and exfoliating for my tastes, and leaves my skin feeling scoured rather than smoothed.</li>
    <li> Good quality. A little large for some of my soap bars but overall happy with product. I use them often and they last a long time.</li>
    <li> We use these all the time, it is great for the leftover bars of soap so that you can use every bit of the bar.  These are a little stiffer than the others I bought at a local store, that did not last for a long time. So hopefully they will last longer.  The price was awesome!!</li>
    <li> Does a great job of holding handmade soaps in the shower. Now my soaps have a chance to dry between showers...no more soggy soap.</li>
    <li> I had to actually stop using these because they were too rough on my skin.  And I know this will sound weird, but they were doing anything for the dry bits on my arms.  Not sure how it&#x27;s possible to be too rough and not rough enough...  But there you have it.</li>
    <li> Works pretty well.  A little difficult to put soap in but it is really good for exfoliating.</li>
    <li> The netting holds up pretty well but the toggle piece on more than one broke already so I do not reccomend this item.</li>
    <li> These are so thick that I find it hard to get suds from a new bar of soap.  I usually use liquid soap to get them started.  When its wet enough it works and it is a good scrubber.</li>
    <li> Everyone that I gave one to loves these.. they exfoliate your skin and leave it softer.. Even my son likes it for that reason..  Good for rough elbows ..&lt;br /&gt;Handy way to keep the soap even when it gets smaller.you aren&#x27;t wasting any soap...  having different colors makes you know which one is  yours.</li>
    <li> Love these they are nice an thick!! They are a hard to find item you used to be able to buy them at Wal-Mart but they no longer sell them. Some ratings say that the closures don&#x27;t stay shut but I&#x27;ve had no problems. They hold up very well</li>
    <li> Nice product. Love the draw string. Works great, thought it was different material, but that was my fault!  Works fine.</li>
    <li> Falling apart after a week of use. Great idea and is wonderful for that first week but after that the layers start to come off.</li>
    <li> I really like these and will continue to buy &amp; use them (prefer white) but they don&#x27;t last a long time thus the 4 stars.&lt;br /&gt;The way I have experienced them falling apart is they sort of come undone from the inside bottom. After a few months the outer layer comes loose. It&#x27;s easy enough to modify and the price is right. I don&#x27;t want to deter you from trying them out. I just wish they lasted longer. :-)</li>
    <li> The quality and material is great. It&#x27;s just a little too thick so the soap is hard to come out the mesh :(</li>
    <li> One of the pouches was torn but decided not to return based on the price. The texture of the pouch is rough that is not the issue what I don&#x27;t like is that the pouch does not allow the soap to lather.  Just disappointed.</li>
    <li> I wanted to like this, but I just can&#x27;t. Yes, it holds soap slivers well enough, but the shape is awkward. I think it would be better designed if this was a shower pouf design with a pocket in the center to hold the slivers, but with it&#x27;s current shape it feels like you&#x27;re rubbing a rolling pin over your skin.  It&#x27;s also pretty tough to get a lather if you only have small amounts of soap in it. It just wasn&#x27;t for me.</li>
    <li> We must have gotten the best batch of these ever made! We opened the first one and it has been going strong for two months. It&#x27;s shown no sign of wear at all. It&#x27;s still like the day we opened the package. Be careful when purchasing these—based on the photos I believe the ones that look soft and silky in the photo are the ones that fall apart quickly. These are somewhere between those soft silky ones and a loofa. One quick swipe under the shower head and it lathers up nicely. The fact that it lathers so quickly means we are definitely using less soap when we shower. My wife and I both noticed that the bars last much longer with these soap savers. We had tried a terry cloth soap saver before these and we would go through a new bar of soap in half the time. If I could, I would give these a higher rating!</li>
    <li> Hard to get the soap to suds up. (using classic irish spring bar soap)</li>
    <li> For those who use bars of soap this is great . You don&#x27;t have to worry about what to do with the small pieces of soap ,you put them in the pouch and there&#x27;s no more waste.</li>
    <li> I purchased these to use with some Raw African Black Soap which I also purchased on Amazon. You can find the product here:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00AJXYP22/ref&#x3D;oh_details_o00_s00_i03?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;psc&#x3D;1&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will never buy the soap again considering I found little hairs from the soap stuck in the webbing of the pouch. The pouches however are great. It takes a little work to get a lather going considering the thickness of the material, but once you get it started it&#x27;s all good. I like how secure the draw string is, so if you had multiple pieces of soap in it, there is very little chance of any falling out.</li>
    <li> Use these for all the small motel soaps we&#x27;ve collected on our travels - put 3 or 4 in a pouch and voila.  Like the different colors so husband and I can each have one.  Saves $ by using up all the soap remnants too.</li>
    <li> These are great for the shower.  I love being able to stuff the remains of a bar of soap into one of these and continue &amp;#34;easily&amp;#34; using the soap until it is gone.  Over time, the mesh does tear or pull away from the point that holds it all together, but for the price, even buying a bag of these every 6-9 months is still a good deal in my opinion.</li>
    <li> Allows use of every bit of your bar of soap.  Be careful about overstuffing these.  I used one for about six years and it never had a problem until I tried to put too many bar scraps in there, and then it came undone and I had to order new ones.  I love that they hang instead of sit in a puddle of water in my shower soap dish.</li>
    <li> It works ok. Its a little rough on the skin and the plastic thing broke really fast. But other then that it works alright.</li>
    <li> These are awesome! The make a great lather and exfoliate your skin well. My husband and I both like them.</li>
    <li> These soap pouches are both easy to use and handy to have close by when intense scrubbing is necessary.  They&#x27;re of good size and will hold quite a bit of soap. Even though they may seem full it&#x27;s still very easy to work up a good lather. These pouches are constructed out of nylon which in turn makes them quite good at scrubbing out deeply embedded dirt &amp; grim. Overall, they are well worth the price. I would recommend these to anyone. I&#x27;ve attached but a four star rating due to fact that even though these are good to have and work quite well, they, as anything else, have but a limited life span. In simple terms, there&#x27;s nothing perfect.</li>
    <li> The mesh soap saver pouches were exactly as described and what I was looking for.  One was immediately put into use and it did exactly what I wanted it to do - it made small pieces of soap useable!</li>
    <li> The soap pouch is well made. It have several layers of mesh material. The string is thick. inside of the pouch the mesh clothes are zip tied tightly. Used it for few days without issues. The pouch creates good amount of foam. Satisfied with my purchase.</li>
    <li> Works great, and saves soap.</li>
    <li> These work great.  When you get down to that last sliver of your favorite soap, you can slip it in this bag (with other soaps) and continue to use it.  The bag also seems to work well exfoliating too.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t believe I never used these before now.  I use scented soaps and they last longer and cheaper than soap on a rope.  Great for college also.</li>
    <li> Love these!  The price is awesome, extends the life of your bar soap. Once you get it onto a nice lather it&#x27;s amazing!! I highly recommend</li>
    <li> Great way to save money.I purchased these based on previous reviews.  They are a bit stiff a first but work great.</li>
    <li> I purchased some specialty soap in a little town store and saw these mesh soap bags.  I was interested until I saw the price of $6.50 each, so I decided to look on Amazon and here I get a 4 pack for a little over $5??!!  DEAL!  I gave one to a friend and another to my Aunt and they love them as well.  Only complaint, I wish they were tied at the end so I could hang them to dry in the shower.  I keep trying to tie the strings in a knot, but it won&#x27;t stay!  Other than that, I love these and would definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> I had these as a college student, I have these now for the gym, and will have them forever! Best way to use every last chuck of bar soap, and the best way to store that soap without messy soap holders. Love!</li>
    <li> Yeah, I know, it&#x27;s a pouch but these things are great for keeping your soap from melting all over your soap dish (the soap melts in the bag which helps them lather up) and the scratchy fabric is the best for exfoliating rough patches on knees, elbows and heels.  I had one I bought from the grocery store that lasted for years but these are nothing like that.  My first one broke in less than a week.  The bottom of the pouch is held shut with a zip tie and in this case the zip tie snapped which let the soap fall out leaving a long sharp piece of plastic to scratch my legs.  That&#x27;s too bad because I can no longer find this type of soap bag in the grocery/drug store.</li>
    <li> Love these.  You can put old soap pieces,  new soap.  It doesn&#x27;t matter.  It works great!!</li>
    <li> The improvements to these soap bags are noticeable and appreciated.</li>
    <li> I purchased these because we use mainly bar soap, and I&#x27;ve had a soap pouch before that I loved.  I was thinking I&#x27;d experience similar results with these, but I was wrong!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you use the pouch with a bar of soap inside, you end up with the equivalent of a sandpaper block. Even my boyfriend, who loves a really scrubby surface, said these were too rough and irritated his skin.  We tried decreasing the pressure, but then we couldn&#x27;t get any soap to come through the mesh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly disappointed with these (and the fact that there&#x27;s nothing I can do to get rid of them!).  I bet they&#x27;ll make good pot scrubbers, though!</li>
    <li> Update: Looks like the company may have listened to some complaints. The last of these we bought have been improved \\&quot;Really improved\\&quot; with larger string and a much better clasp to hold the bag locked. Should be a great improvement for the folks who had a problem with the bag opening up while in use. Still love these as they really prevent the loss of that extra soap and keep the drain from getting clogged with the bits that you always loose. Worth a try!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are the best invention since the soap. A real treat being able to not drop soap every day. Lather up very well also. Nice easy to store and you can hold on to them. For those talking about them not holding the string locked the factory did a poor job of working the string clasp. Untie the string and pull out of the clasp. Hold the button and re-insert the string and loop it through around the opposite side of the inner shaft in other words around where the other side string would normally go and then back around to the hole across from the first hole. Do the same with the other string. You may need a opened paper clip or something to grab the string to help it out of the back hole. With the strings crisscrossed around the button shaft they can&#x27;t slip past the little button flange that locks them which is why they slip loose. If you do that you will really love these. You can pull at the clasp after that and it won&#x27;t slide till you press the button.</li>
    <li> they work as intended and will hold a lot of soap. Its difficult getting others in the house to use them. So i pack their left overs into my pouch and use the soap</li>
    <li> This is an interesting buy...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;ve never used a Soap Pouch before, they&#x27;re amazing!  So easy to make lather super quick, and unlike a wash cloth, it doesn&#x27;t fold over itself or anything, and the soap is self-contained!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;ve used loofah versions of these, it&#x27;s not EXACTLY the same.  It definitely a little more plastic-y material to it, so a *slight* negative is it doesn&#x27;t feel like standard loofah on your body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, the positive to this, is that it holds together WAAAAAAY better.  My old loofah soap pouch would start shredding, breaking, slowly over use, which was ok, but would only last... 6 months? before it was tatters.  This is much stronger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So you do sacrifice a little of that &#x27;feel&#x27; for it holding together much much better, which I like.  Overall, awesome buy!!</li>
    <li> I realize after using these for a while that mostly you want your soap slippery, so this becomes a &amp;#34;second&amp;#34; bar out. Also, the knot and string get in the way quite a bit. I do like this for use with a natural mosquito repellant soap because I can really rough my skin up with it, so I&#x27;m using it but wouldn&#x27;t recommend it to others.</li>
    <li> I bought the 4-pack thinking that at least I will have more when the first one unravels. However, it&#x27;s been a few months and the first one is still going strong! Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Works great!!  I love these to put my soap in and get a great scrub all over.  The only small thing is that they smell a little chemical heavy when first out of the box.  I suggest a bright open airy space to rid of the fumes before you use :-)</li>
    <li> These are great! Way better than the cheaper ones I bought at Big Lots about a year ago that would come apart after just a couple of uses. Lots of suds, no slippery soap bar to slip out of the bather&#x27;s hands and have to be groped for before it causes a fall...</li>
    <li> These work well. We&#x27;ve had them for quite a while and haven&#x27;t had any trouble with them.  They have held up nicely. Each family member has their own color. Good for the kids and a much less expensive option than body wash, especially for kids.  One bar of Ivory lasts my kids a very long time.  You can use up every last bit of soap.  For a few bucks, well worth the money.  If these do ever fall apart, I&#x27;ll be buying them again.</li>
    <li> I thought these mesh bags would be a lot thinner but they&#x27;re so layered I don&#x27;t know how you would get any suds out of them. I took them apart because they&#x27;re also haphazardly put together and made 4 out of just one! That means you can pull out 16 of these mesh bags from this 4 pack! Just get some drawstring, tie it and you can reuse it until you need the next one.</li>
    <li> Little bigger than I thought but still works just as good.</li>
    <li> Just what I wanted.  great way to extend the life of a bar of soap/ the texture is just enough for an exfoliation</li>
    <li> If you haven&#x27;t replaced wash cloths with these, I highly recommend them. One color for each family member.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s tough to find these type of pouches.  I use handmade lotion bars and these help my bars stay intact longer.  They lather up very nicely and I&#x27;ve never had a problem keeping the soap inside.</li>
    <li> I have bought other brands that did not hold together beyond one bar of soap, but these do not have that issue. I have been using the same one for months and it is still holding up well. I even bought more for friends.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good scrubby loofa thing once it gets sudsy, but it takes longer to suds up a bar of soap than I would like. If it got sudsy more quickly, I&#x27;d give it a higher rating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll probably buy the product again.</li>
    <li> When we first went to a shower bench, I was looking for a safe way for my husband to handle his bars of soap, since this was his preference. I tried these, and they do exactly what they say they do.  But, he found them to be a bit rough on his skin.  We actually found a better solution in a book of bating hints that we ended up using, which is to place the soap in the toe of a nylon. This allows easy soaping and easy grabbing and hanging if need be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So if you want scrub power, these are fine, but if you want to wash with the soap itself, try a pair of ankle high nylons as an inexpensive practical solution.</li>
    <li> not as soft as I would like them, nice colors</li>
    <li> I purchased this to use with my homemade soap. It is great. It is a little rougher than I expected, but good to use on the rough spots, like feet and elbows. I use a softer type (also purchased from Amazon) for everyday use everywhere else. Will purchase again to use in a gift set with my soaps.</li>
    <li> Soap would not stay in because the sliip knot was faulty.</li>
    <li> Bought this set to use in my RV.  My son and his wife and I all shower/bathe and these are PERFECT to help us keep our soaps separate.  I am having to buy another set for us to use in our respective homes because we liked them so much when we go camping in the RV.  Well, actually, my son says we don&#x27;t camp in my RV, he says we are Glamping in my RV.  I might tend to agree with him lolz...</li>
    <li> I love these. I think for sanitary reasons, you are suppose to change out any bathroom loofa/sponge every month. But for this price, I don&#x27;t mind it. In addition to the affordability, they hold up really well. I have bought some from another seller that fell apart so I&#x27;m really happy these didn&#x27;t. It&#x27;s not too rough on sensitive skin but it&#x27;s also not too soft so it gets the job done. I would recommend these</li>
    <li> great job!  love the product.</li>
    <li> They are nice in that they hold all sizes of soap but they don&#x27;t lather very well. Like the colors and the price.</li>
    <li> These are multi-layer mesh and from my experience, do not work well at all. The soap fits well, but I can&#x27;t get any suds to come to the surface. If I could, I would return them and cannot recommend them at all!</li>
    <li> Love these. Hard to find in stores</li>
    <li> I use it every day Great for making your bar of soap last longer.</li>
    <li> These seem less available in B&amp;M stores lately, so I was glad to find them on A..one caveat: the nylon cable tie used to close the end of the bag has sharpe edges (inside the bag) that aren&#x27;t too cool for vigorous scrubbing!</li>
    <li> Long ago we stubled upon one of these at a local retailer and my daughter asked if she could have one.  I reluctantly purchased one.  SHE LOVED IT. When we went back to the local retailers we couldn&#x27;t find one anywhere.  My daughter suggested that we look on Amazon and low and behold we found it and in great colors also.  Everyone in the house gets one and it works very well for the showers at her dorm as well.  I&#x27;m glad I ordered it!</li>
    <li> I sell a ton of these....thank you!</li>
    <li> I really like these.  I like buying bar soap but they are so slippery they are difficult to use in the shower. These keep me from loosing the soap and provide light exfoliation.  I hang them from a hook to dry.</li>
    <li> These are pretty cool! I bought them for stocking stuffers for christmas-- giving two away and kept two for myself. I had never seen anything like this before, and they work really well! They&#x27;re a great way to actually make use of smaller pieces of soap instead of throwing it away... you know, when the bar of soap is pretty much dissolved down to nothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Though I don&#x27;t recommend putting one of those huge bars of soap in there-- stick to the normal sized bar soap so you can get a good lather.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, don&#x27;t know if it matters to anyone (didn&#x27;t matter to me) but the colors I got weren&#x27;t the same as in the picture. Wasn&#x27;t a big deal to me, but just letting you know.</li>
    <li> I have bought soap pouches that fell apart after a few uses so I ordered several, but these are so durable and well made that they will last a long while. Its a quality product manufactured like they used to make them years ago!</li>
    <li> Like others, I purchased these primarily as a way to use those leftover chips of soap that end up melting in the soap dish. Reading the reviews, I was marginally prepared for how rough they were but I was still a bit surprised. After a few uses, the roughness seemed to have lessened. I don&#x27;t know if that was just due acclimation or they if actually wore down a bit. As for the exfoliation benefits, that was a side concern, but after a month of using it, there seems to be a noticeable improvement in my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Three stars are because it was very hard to open the bag to refill it. One bag went straight into the garbage because I could not open it without cutting the cord (which I did try, but that rendered the bag useless as the soap kept popping out). So it&#x27;s a good thing there are more than one in a package.</li>
    <li> Walmart carried a version of this but if fell apart but I bought it til they no longer carried it I liked the concept. These soap bags last forever. They exfoliate keep my slippery soap from falling and I can use my soap until they end. I love this product.</li>
    <li> Love these.  Have searched for a long time to replace old ones that had worn out.  Finally found them on Amazon.</li>
    <li> too thick....wouldnt lather. Gave the others away and they didnt like it either.  Try Salux Nylon Japanese Beauty Skin Bath Wash Cloths you wont regret</li>
    <li> These are the best inventions!  Makes your soap last even longer!</li>
    <li> Love them much better than the ones I bought at walmart</li>
    <li> My daughter loved these.  They are very hard to find but great way to use up those little bits of soap we all have left, plus good exfoliating quality - not too harsh.</li>
    <li> Glad I finally found these.  My only complaint it the string comes untied easily.  I will buy more when needed.</li>
    <li> Great solution for what to do with those little slivers of soap.  The shape is a little awkward to wash with but only because I am used to the poof ball shape.</li>
    <li> If you in to saving money and a big recycle person this is the product for you. It saves me about 2 new bar of soap a year and I feel good that I am not dumping a useful item.</li>
    <li> Nice abrasion yet gentle.  Saves soap and a great feel in the hand</li>
    <li> I have used these for several years, first buying them at Walmart until they stopped carrying them. I learned very quickly that they last much longer if I turn them inside out and use a needle threaded with dental floss passing it back and forth through the netting to secure it to whatever is used to cinch the netting at the bottom. Without that step, the netting will pull out from the middle of the bunch rendering the bag useless. With that step, each pouch lasts me many months.</li>
    <li> I use one of these in the shower to scrub up with my bar of soap until they are all ripped. I am amazed on how long my bar of soap lasts since I started using these simple scrubber pouches.</li>
    <li> If you buy expensive beauty bars for your shower/bath, and are tired of throwing away 20% of them when they get too small - this is the answer!  Collect your &amp;#34;too small&amp;#34; bars into this mesh bag, and then when you have enough, use it as a soap-filled loofah.  I used to buy these in my local stores, but can&#x27;t find them anymore.  The price per item was considerably more.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t thing it would work as good as it does. Add a new bar of soap and an old sliver for them to rub against and you get a huge amount of lather and the soap lasts for months. it is best to hang from the cord so the foam dries in the pouch.</li>
    <li> The bottom of these has a very big gathering of mesh, about a 1&#x27; ball which is a little awkward when you&#x27;re trying to wash yourself. :/</li>
    <li> have bought a different brand in the past&lt;br /&gt;this set is the best I have ever purchased&lt;br /&gt;they are great on the skin for exfoliating&lt;br /&gt;and seems like they will last a lifetime&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;great buy&lt;br /&gt;and they make the soap life longer</li>
    <li> I bought these to replace some we purchased at a home and garden show.  These are much sturdier and work well.  They are easily big enough to handle a full bar of Dove soap.  The closure at the bottom of the bag is very secure..  I am always a little leery of the sliding closure on the top...this is where we have seen the most consistent failures.  These seem to be more robust and have lasted several weeks so far.  They work well in the shower or bath as an exfoliating scrub.  Overall we are quite happy with them.  By the way, it was cheaper to buy the four pack than to buy them individually.</li>
    <li> I purchased some frog suction cups from Amazon to go along with these... now all four hang securely in my shower, color coded for each of my children!  No more arguing over who&#x27;s using what soap... no more searching for washcloths!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, the mesh sometimes seems a bit scratchy when you&#x27;re soaping up ... but then again I like a good exfoliation!</li>
    <li> Great solution for those small bits of soap that are too small to use. With the variety of colors no confusion as to whose which one is.</li>
    <li> Ok...these were a bit strange at first.  It is a mesh...very squishy/slick.  But after using them for a while it is clear they work well and while other types wear out these are still going strong.  I like them.</li>
    <li> Everyone needs this! Gentle remove the days build up. Especially deodorant! Bars of soap and all your left over slivers can fit in here. Four different colors so you don&#x27;t have to share.</li>
    <li> Been trying to find replacement bags after my last one bit the dust. These are actually quite sturdy and should do well.</li>
    <li> I only used one of them and it came apart fairly quickly.</li>
    <li> Finally found a way to save money on the liquid soap that has been taking over shelves for well over a decade now and leave the shower with an experience as though I had paid for the liquid version.</li>
    <li> These soap saver pouches are great!  No more mess with soap sitting in a dish and the soap last longer!  The mesh material creates a light exfoliating on the skin every time you wash. I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> At first these worked, now it won&#x27;t stay closed, so the soap keep out!&lt;br /&gt;Very dissatisfied. I have had one before &amp; worked great.&lt;br /&gt;The button on these don&#x27;t stay closed&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> LOVE these things, too bad I can no longer find them at the store. So I gotta put them as add-ons.</li>
    <li> Great!  I use this for my expensive hand made goat soap to make it last longer.  It also dubles as a exfoliated and lasts a very long time</li>
    <li> It rubs the soap on its skin or else it gits the hose again!</li>
    <li> fell apart after 1 use</li>
    <li> These are great soap savers! Great way to conserve those expensive fancy homemade soaps I like. There is a drawstring at the top to keep soap inside. They do wear out after a year or two, but they are cheap enough. Look as good as the ones from Container store that I already have.</li>
    <li> Bought and resold these with my homemade soaps.  Sold very well to my customers and I used them at home.</li>
    <li> Received as advertised.</li>
    <li> FELL APART..NO GOOD..HAD TO SEW UP BEFORE USING...DRAW STRING WOULD NOT STAY CLOSED...</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t know how many we have gotten over the years but will continue to get these.</li>
    <li> Awesome value, these things end up saving you $$$ because you&#x27;re less likely to go through soap quickly. Makes any soap an exfoliating one.</li>
    <li> Not what expected, but will work.</li>
    <li> So far, so good! I like that I can use my soaps in this - I get the benefit of the scrubby loofah action while getting to use soaps that are nicer on my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, surprisingly, it doesn&#x27;t drip a whole lot and make a mess in the tub - thumbs up from me!</li>
    <li> I initially thought this was a cheap product and I was expecting more. Now it&#x27;s been 2 years and it&#x27;s a simple but really useful product! The mesh is very exfoliating. Each mesh bag has lasted months.  Exceeded my expectations!</li>
    <li> Who doesn&#x27;t want to save a few bucks by using those small pieces of soap that begin to fall through your fingers!  And these work!  We&#x27;ve been using them for a couple of months now, but one broke after just a month.  These are constructed using the same mesh scrubby balls you buy at your local wally world, except these have multiple layers, which is good. The top of the pouch uses a string and slide lock, but the bottom uses a plastic cable tie to hold it together, and the cable tie came off.  Not a real problem if you are savvy and have some ties in your garage, you can easily repair it by using a new cable tie. We also use them to add those small bars from our hotel travels too.  My wife said goodbye to those old mesh scrubby balls.</li>
    <li> wonderful for shower use....good way to use up soap chips....practical and attractive</li>
    <li> I drop my tiny, un-usable pieces of soap into one of these things and when there&#x27;s enough in there, I have a nice scrubby that suds up quickly.</li>
    <li> Does the job, but the knot in the pull string keeps coming undone so have shelf to put it on and not hang.</li>
    <li> Just what I wanted, and couldn&#x27;t find locally.  This is an old fashioned soap saver pouch (ie I had something very similar in the 70&#x27;s) and it does what I want - takes all the old slivers of soaps and makes them useable once more.  It&#x27;s a bit rough but not too scratchy, I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> Love these soap saver for my bar soaps.  I used to use a soap dish for my soap and it would get used quickly.  My soap in these soap savers lasts me anywhere from 4 to 6 weeks depending on the type of soap.  I am the only one using this soap, so in a family with more users you might use more soap.  I love this 4 pack, I use one in my showers at home and then one for traveling.</li>
    <li> Hold the little shards of soap that would otherwise break up and go down the drain.  This is good.  Beware though, these things are abrasive.  This is bad, but as advertised they are &amp;#34;exfoliating&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> These need to be shorter and a little softer.</li>
    <li> Quality of the mesh bag is good. Is refillable, and holds up with use very well.</li>
    <li> Love these. When you add a bar of soap they suds up beautifully and give some gentle exfoliation. Also it prevents the soap from getting glued to the shower caddy. The drawstrings pull tight and they seem to dry out well enough without become mildewy so far. My boyfriend loves the set I gave to him too. I&#x27;m not sure how often they should be replaced, but I&#x27;ll keep an eye on them to see when they start to get yucky (skin cells and all that). They are a little harder to suds up when there isn&#x27;t much soap left, but when you have a full bar it&#x27;s no problem, they are sudsy almost instantly.</li>
    <li> Received them fast. Looked just like what I ordered &amp; love them!</li>
    <li> These are pretty cool.  Saves the soap but I wish it was half the size.  It&#x27;s too long.  Needs to be the length and width of a bar of soap.</li>
    <li> Love the colors and gives a really good scrub down!! So cute! they are a bot brighter than in the picture, but in my case was great!:)</li>
    <li> Great value - You get all four!  I though I was just buying one.  The material is a little more scratchy than may last brand, but when its all wet and soapy, it really doesn&#x27;t matter.</li>
    <li> I bought one of these at Wal Mart and when I went to look for another, they had quit carrying them. I was delighted to find them on Amazon. They work great, soap lasts a long time, just enough &#x27;scrub&#x27; but not too much. Perfect, long lasting and a great soap saver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;** I got my order from Amazon promptly, and got the colors pictured! I am very happy with this purchase</li>
    <li> I love adding new bars when last bar is almost gone. Great soap saver. Will buy again as they last almost as long as the higher priced mesh soap savers. Cheap ones do not have the nice draw string to hold the soap from falling out.</li>
    <li> Holds very well, those little slivers of bar-soap.</li>
    <li> I found a different but similar product at a local supermarket that&#x27;s around 3&amp;#34; shorter than these and works 100% better. These have a giant pouch, but the last 3&amp;#34; or so is just one solid ball of mesh, which makes it really awkward to use. Hard to explain, but I wouldn&#x27;t purchase them again.</li>
    <li> Soap up great once you get them broke in.  Closure&#x27;s kind shakey.  I use the one in the kitchen for scrubbin&#x27; pots and it grooves the scene.</li>
    <li> Fell apart or string broke within the first week of using it. I&#x27;ve bought better ones at Walmart but had to resort to these when I could no longer find them locally.</li>
    <li> After reading the reviews I was a little hesitant about buying this, but I went ahead and did it anyway.  I am glad I did.  I suspect the manufacturer took note of the feedback and significantly improved their product.  It works exactly as it should, and the construction appears very solid -- I examined it thoroughly.  I&#x27;ve been using it a while (I&#x27;m on my second large bar of soap) and it seems to be holding up just fine.  I am still on my first one and I&#x27;ve have no problems at all.  As I have three more, I suspect I am good with this for at least a year if not longer.    In addition, the scrubby works great -- it&#x27;s scrubby and works as an exfoliant, but it is not too rough at all.  I use it on my face as well as my body and it leaves my skin smooth and feeling great.    Well worth the money and I recommend this product highly.    ***** 8/29/14  UPDATE  *****    I originally ordered this product on April 8, 2014 and have been using the first one every day since I received it two days later.  I have to say this product has already given me my money&#x27;s worth and more.  The quality issues written about in early reviews have clearly been addressed and my scrubby is holding up like new for the past four months.  Even with large bars of artisan soap it really works well.  Even when the soap gets soft, it keeps it inside and you just get a nice lather.  It&#x27;s not often that I update my reviews, but this product has really impressed me.    If you&#x27;re thinking of buying this stop hesitating -- this product doesn&#x27;t just work well, it does an excellent job.   Lest you think me a shill for this product please have a look at all my reviews -- you&#x27;ll see I am not.</li>
    <li> They are much rougher than I had imagined and I really don&#x27;t use them. A waste of money I guess. I was hoping for something to put all the &amp;#34;soap ends&amp;#34; into and be able to lather up using the cloth. I realize it says &amp;#34;exfoliating&amp;#34; but it really is too rough to use on my body.</li>
    <li> I have used mine several times and its great i also gave my son one because he uses diff. soap than i do and he likes it alot also . one of the reasons i got them is that to me it really does help with the dry skin and so far they r wonderful</li>
    <li> I love bar soap it lasts longer so is cheaper. I love these because you get your use out of the soap. Once a bar gets low you can add another one in there and just keep using it and it will continue to be used. The only things I dont like are the strings come undone easily and I cannot get them knotted again easily and two, my husband uses it too and one of the layers has come undone from the bottom. Good note is, these were from me and my husband , mother and father in law have stole them from me because it is a great concept. They are really good for scrubbing your skin vs. just rubbing soap on.</li>
    <li> Good produce it holds together very well, the plastic ring at the top should prevent the mesh from coming apart.</li>
    <li> These work well. The only negative I can find is it is a little yucky putting in a new soap bar with the soggy old one down in the middle.</li>
    <li> This was my third order of the soap pouches in about a two and half year span. They lather good, feel good on the skin and the company seals the bottom so the soap won&#x27;t escape. Much better than using just a bar of soap and you don&#x27;t have left over little pieces. It all gets used. I will continue to buy them as needed. They last long enough for me to get my money&#x27;s worth.</li>
    <li> I bought these since the one I got at walmart years ago was deteriorating. These are not as exfoliant/rough as that which is what I wanted instead but these are no terrible. I wish the had more room as the brand new bar is very tight and hard to get a good lather, sometimes I feel like parts of it aren&#x27;t scrubbing enough. If you just need a loofa type that holds bar soap though then this works great for that.</li>
    <li> Nice price.  Could be a bit bigger for the men with big hands.  Good idea to use up those slivers of soap.</li>
    <li> They work great and were exactly what I was looking for. The strings do tend to untie themselves making it hard to keep them tightly closed.</li>
    <li> This product I cant live without, not only does a great job of scrubbing, but create a great lather to yor soap. You get yo use every little bit of soap so there is no waste.</li>
    <li> They seem to work well but outer layer tears apart easily. Some are made better than others.  If you are using for a camping trip where they will be tossed at the end, they do the job.</li>
    <li> Some reviews I read prior to purchasing indicated they didn&#x27;t last long, but if you&#x27;re careful when using and don&#x27;t get too rambunctious with it, it works great and doesn&#x27;t come apart at all.</li>
    <li> These are too think to be of good use.</li>
    <li> Happy with this purchase.</li>
    <li> The bags were very large, and cumbersome to handle.  Too thick to receive any good benefit from the upgraded soap we use.  Would not purchase again.</li>
    <li> A little difficult to use in the shower due to the shape and size.</li>
    <li> I liked how sturdy they are.  They are thick mesh and stand up to repeated use.  They are bigger than the ones I could have bought locally and hold plenty of soap slivers.  I&#x27;ll be buying them again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve put one of these pouches thru a fairly long test period and I&#x27;m well pleased. Prior to buying this pouch I bought some flat, exfoliating bar soup pouches and they didn&#x27;t hold up well at all. It was hard to keep the soap bar in the pouch too. These pouches will lock in the soap. And the bars of soar last far longer than the previous, flat pouch and way, way, way longer than using no pouch at all. The savings in soap will easily pay for these pouches.</li>
    <li> I use these to put soap in for my family to use in the shower.  It helps curtail the soap mess but I had to re-sew the purple one since the bottom of it had a big hole in it where it had come undone.  It was still brand new and unused.  They work alright but I think I would prefer something a little softer as a scrub material and rarely use mine although the hubs seems to like his a lot.</li>
    <li> Love these pouches!  My husband is a soap hog, so buying body wash can be expensive.  This allows us to use bar soap and save $$.  I think they hold together well.  We have different colors for each member of the house and have only had to replace one time each in six months.</li>
    <li> SO CONVENIENT FOR THE SHOWER. GET A LARGE SUCTION CUP FROM THE HARDWARE STORE, STICK IT ON YOUR SHOWER OR TUB WALL AND HANG THE SOCK UP.  A BAR OF SOAP LASTS A LONG TIME USING THESE SOCKS AND THE GENTLE SCRUBBING  REALLY EXFOLIATES NICELY.  FILLED WITH A PRETTY SMELLING BAR OF SPECIALTY SOAP, THIS SOCK MAKES A GREAT GIFT!</li>
    <li> GREAT WAY TO SAVE ON BAR SOAP AND TO HELP KEEP THE BATHTUB FREE OF SMALL BITS OF SOAP LOVE IT AND YOU FOUR OF THEM</li>
    <li> These mesh soap holders are great for travel, dorm and gym showering. The soap slips inside and the mesh acts like a loofah/sponge and you can hang it up to dry. The doesn&#x27;t get mushy and the mesh dries quickly.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Works great. Super same day shipping. Got it in 4 hours after ordering.</li>
    <li> good value! usually pay this much for only one at my local drugstore. they don&#x27;t last very long. like all mesh pouches, they start to come apart. But for the price of 4 of them it&#x27;s well worth it.</li>
    <li> This is a great idea to save soap scraps and place them in this sponge and use it, however this tends to get a bit of bacteria on it as it sits in the shower, I try to hang it so that it does not get any bacteria or germs on it, but I still dont feel comfortable using it.  I did have some break outs and attested them to this, even though I dont know for sure this is the culprit.  I wont use mine any longer, though I am thrifty and thought this was a cool idea.</li>
    <li> These are really nice. I put my leftover pieces of soap into them and they suds up nicely. They are going to save me money in the long run. I love how the pull string holds the pieces inside.</li>
    <li> This was a gift so not sure how to rate it . I have purchased similiar ones from a soap/ candle store. They were about  same price but would have been more on this site if the shipping was not free. They looked to be as good of quality. I am happy with the purchase.</li>
    <li> In the past I&#x27;ve only used soap pouches that were single or double layer and made of a cotton based weave.  I knew these were multiple layers of plastic mesh but I thought I&#x27;d give this design a chance.  They just don&#x27;t work very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They have quite a few layers and do foam well, but it takes quite a bit of time.  Also, they&#x27;re so thick that the top doesn&#x27;t close completely.  Because of this, you have to hold it upright to keep the soap inside.  If they were shorter they would pretty much be unusable.  As is, they&#x27;re not the worst, but you&#x27;d probably do better with a more traditional design.</li>
    <li> They are a little coarse, but she likes them.  Does anything else matter?</li>
    <li> wanted the soft soap holder, didn&#x27;t realize the exfoliate hardness.  Will not use.</li>
    <li> These work great!  Needed to replace an old, worn pouch.  I use homemade soaps and the pouch is a great way to hold them and prevent them from turning into a gloppy mess.  It takes a bit longer lather  than the old one.  The best part, by using these, we no longer have pick hair out of the soap (yuck!)</li>
    <li> I began making my own soap and wanted a way to &amp;#34;save my soap&amp;#34;. These have been a perfect way to help me keep my soap from fading away. They help the soap foam up and dry up nicely between washes. I would highly recommend them. They work just as described. Thank you!</li>
    <li> Extremely rough on skin. Might as well be using a soapy cheese grater.</li>
    <li> I liked these better than the other brand I bought at a retail store. Excellent! And long lasting! Because no metal was used, there is no rust in the spring notch.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t much care for the shape of them, but they work well (especially for the price).</li>
    <li> I could do with the actual plastic mesh being a little less thick, however. Generating a lather can be the devil&#x27;s own task at times due to so much material between the water and the soap. You can definitely fit a lot of those little scraps in there, though...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 06/28/13&lt;br /&gt;I have pulled this down to 2 starts because the little plastic zip ties that they use to put this together have failed on 2 of the 4 that I got. This may be a bit better option than using those plastic bags tangerines come in due to a smaller hole pattern, but these are no great shakes.</li>
    <li> I noticed that if you put a half of a bar of soap in a pouch it lathers much more.  Great Product.  Saves soap/</li>
    <li> I was really happy to see these on Amazon. I had been looking for months in my local stores. My hubby loves these things, but the colors are a little girly in peron ( hence the 4 stars). Also, not sure how this brand holds up, but I&#x27;m just happy to have found them!</li>
    <li> My husband uses these with his bar soap. He loves them, and the soap lasts longer because the loofah material gets a good lather without wasting soap.</li>
    <li> Works well. Great buy for 4.  I have a problem finding these in the store.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t care for it but my wife does.</li>
    <li> These are nice and cheap but they ripped pretty fast. Each one can last about a month or longer.</li>
    <li> Awesome, I have to use special soap, and it is hard when it starts to get real small, this allows me to use every bit of it without waste and in the world today we can&#x27;t afford to waste a thing.</li>
    <li> This product fit my needs exactly. I was impressed with the quality and the price. If you need a soap bag, I recommend this one.</li>
    <li> Pouches are better than using poufy scrubbies. Keeps soap dry &amp; soap dishes clean.</li>
    <li> This item is pretty simple, so as far as I can see they can&#x27;t really go wrong with it. And it works exactly as expected, so I&#x27;m pretty happy with them :)</li>
    <li> Simply GREAT for use in the gym.</li>
    <li> The mesh soap pouch was very good and what I expected but the cord to tighten up the opening was not thick enough for the ball to contain the soap pieces.</li>
    <li> The mesh is already falling apart on one of the pouches after just using it for a short time.  I did not pay much for them.</li>
    <li> These work great for containing the soap bar, and getting a little extra scrubbing action when using the soap. They are a bit thicker than the ones we had before, so it takes a fair amount of agitation before lather will start coming through the mesh. I do think the thickness will mean they last longer, and they make much better loofahs because of it.</li>
    <li> Love these soap socks for my fancy, smelly soaps!  Lots of lather and makes the soap last much longer.  Hadn&#x27;t been able to find any for some time, so I was very happy to find this pack of 4.  So happy that I bought 2 of them!</li>
    <li> Not much to say here except for it exfoliates while extending the life of your bars.</li>
    <li> These are too scratchy and rough without adequate lathering. I hoped they would work like plastic loofah and body-wash; but they just don&#x27;t have that light frothiness with gentle abrasion. Even with high-lathering bars of soap. I prefer the netting bags for soap, and I won&#x27;t order again but they work well enough.</li>
    <li> These are very well made and come in lovely colors.  I just bought another 4  packages and will buy again.</li>
    <li> Great pricing, and exactly what I was looking for. I had received one of these as a gift in the past but lost it. Wanted to replace it, and found these on amazon. Great that it&#x27;s a pack of four for less than $2 each, I can put one in different bathrooms in the house and also save one for travel. Great that it is exfoliating, however my favorite part is probably how long it makes my soap last. In addition if you ever have purchased the soap that are cute and colorful but always break into pieces this is a great option to keep everything together and not lose half the bar.</li>
