### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Follow the instructions, and it&#x27;s their best waxing product by leaps and bounds.</li>
      <li>and i got a perfect result.</li>
      <li>and it worked great!  </li>
      <li>I used it and found it to work just perfectly.</li>
      <li>i find this wax to work best and hope it won&#x27;t get discontinued.</li>
      <li>This has got to be one of the best waxes I&#x27;ve tried.  </li>
      <li>Very good experience.</li>
      <li>I used this product with great satisfaction.</li>
      <li>Works great</li>
      <li>I gave it another try, and it worked great.</li>
      <li>Great for people who are worried about waxing pain.  </li>
      <li>Very handy for home use.&lt;br /&gt;On</li>
      <li>This product is good.</li>
      <li>It gets all the hair, and rinses off easily in warm water.</li>
      <li>My skin does not get irritated easily!  </li>
      <li>This is by far the best home wax kit I&#x27;ve tried (and I&#x27;ve tested most on the market).  </li>
      <li>Ok, so I got this product</li>
      <li>It is also most painless wax I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
      <li>so I used some of my muslin strips thinking they might get a better grip.  </li>
      <li>I enjoyed using it.</li>
      <li>sure you can see the hairs through the strip and wax to ensure that you aren&#x27;t using too much\\&quot;</li>
      <li>I think this is the best self waxing product available to the public.  </li>
      <li>but i can say from my experience that you always need the wax heated up well to be able to wax smoothly and painlessly.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s job well and cleans up easily.  </li>
      <li>Thankfully, the sugar based product does wash off easily with water.</li>
      <li>The wooden spatula and aloe lotion are great.</li>
      <li>I tried to quickly apply another strip, but still the wax didn&#x27;t pull off easily.  </li>
      <li>it goes on really liquid-y and when you rip it off stays mostly on your leg.</li>
      <li>I have loved sugar based waxes in the past and so was excited to try this version that was said to be great for sensitive areas.  </li>
      <li>And my hair is pretty fine.</li>
      <li>the product was great, just as those i previously bought in the store.</li>
      <li>Honestly, this is the only product I&#x27;ll use.  </li>
      <li>My hair normally comes out easily.  </li>
      <li>it heats up quickly, and stays hot for a while.</li>
      <li>just we have it follow the right method of waxing.</li>
      <li>I did need to apply the strip twice to some areas where there were stubborn hairs or multiple hair growth patterns, but this is easy to do -- if you work quickly, you do not even need to reapply wax, just press the strip into place again.  </li>
      <li>I could see the hair through it even if I used the whole tub all at once!  </li>
      <li>When I did exactly what I just described, all of the hair came off.</li>
      <li>I think if it&#x27;s too hot the wax is just too runny for it to grab anything.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had GREAT success with this wax, and apart from their apparently now discontinued white chocolate wax, it&#x27;s their ONLY wax I will use.</li>
      <li>It usually works as good as the salon.</li>
      <li>Also, it worked better for me when the stuff started to cool off a little bit.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been waxing for years, and while I have a preferred product, occasionally I try something new to see if I might like it better.  </li>
      <li>Really.  </li>
      <li>the shipping was fast.</li>
      <li>I saw another reviewer who said to use it VERY sparingly.  </li>
      <li>But, you really need to follow the instructions.    </li>
      <li>This does absolutely nothing.  </li>
      <li>Also, don&#x27;t wait too much.    </li>
      <li>The thing is, that you have to do it really, really fast.</li>
      <li>The others I&#x27;ve tried have been very difficult to remove when finished (leading to great difficulty once getting it all over my fingers in the process) whereas this washed off easily with water.  </li>
      <li>I have waxed using many different products and this I think is clearly the least effective.  </li>
      <li>As advertised, the clear strips make it easy to see whether hair has been removed and to avoid making \\&quot;mistakes\\&quot; when following a hairline.  </li>
      <li>I did not like it for three main reasons:  1.</li>
      <li>I highly reccomend this product and will continue using it.</li>
      <li>but the wax is clear!!  </li>
      <li>I have had problems with waxes not removing all the hair in one pull, but they usually do get a fair amount - just not all, so I have to use a second strip.  </li>
      <li>Oh, and the wax was very sticky and took some maneuvering not to make a huge mess.</li>
      <li>The only time I had difficulty removing hair is when too much wax was used, so apply it very sparingly.    </li>
      <li>Ok, the strips in this kit are absolutely worthless, but the wax itself is good.  </li>
      <li>I followed the directions precisely and even tried to alter it a little so that the results would be a little better, but nothing worked.</li>
      <li>I only flinched a couple of times, and I&#x27;m a real wimp when it comes to hair removal!  </li>
      <li>I bought this product thinking it would be better than the hard wax that I was using.  </li>
      <li>I tried the clear strips that came with the kit and also went out and bought cotton ones - neither one worked</li>
      <li>I wasn&#x27;t surprised -</li>
      <li>I think it was old.  </li>
      <li>If the hair is too short, no wax can really get it.  </li>
      <li>It was not the same as before it did Not work the wax was very watery</li>
      <li>I was very pleasantly surprised.</li>
      <li>The wax is the consistency of honey, which means it doesn&#x27;t \\&quot;grab\\&quot; on to the hair very well, and certainly doesn&#x27;t stick to the odd plastic-like strips.  </li>
      <li>This wax rinses off your skin easily, unlike Sally Hansen&#x27;s purple lavender wax that sticks to you no matter how hard you try to remove it.</li>
      <li>Your skin and hair CAN&#x27;T be wet, it has to be clean dry skin, without a recent shower.</li>
      <li>less waste and no need to buy more stuff.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not that messy because it washes right off with water.  </li>
      <li>Not a single hair came off.</li>
      <li>My only complaints are that the wax cooled very quickly, necessitating a several re-warmings in order to finish my legs, and that the kit comes with a very small amount of the plastic removal strips compared to the amount of wax.</li>
      <li>When you take the time for this project, go through the sticky mess, the ripping off strips, etc., to be left with hairy legs in the end, it&#x27;s really aggravating.  </li>
      <li>I followed all the directions, and tried to use as little \\&quot;wax\\&quot; as possible since it said to use very sparingly, but no matter what I did NO hairs came out.</li>
      <li>I did have to wait a little while for my hair to grow out, the first time I tried it the hair wasn&#x27;t long enough.    </li>

<li> It only took out a few hairs and left my skin irritated.  </li>
<li> I guess I&#x27;ll just throw it out and call it a loss because not one single hair came out.  </li>
<li> so...you can take it back to the bathroom without making a mess in the kitchen.</li>
<li> Worthless plastic that doesn&#x27;t press over body parts very nice and an equally lazy jar of sticky &#x27;wax&#x27;.</li>
<li> A word of caution: carefully read the instructions, do not overheat the wax, and test the temperature before use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> /&gt;That said, this beats spa and salon visits by a wide margin.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s too gooey, and it&#x27;s not really honey or wax but corn syrup.  </li>
<li> I should have listened to the other reviews.</li>
<li> I had to do it a LOT faster, and stronger then when I&#x27;m using my other wax.</li>
<li> The wax was dark yellow and too thick to spread even when I warmed it up.  </li>
<li> You spread on a THIN layer, press the strip down firmly and pull it back up as close to the skin as possible.  </li>
<li> Don&#x27;t waste your money - at least not if you have coarse hair.  </li>
<li> Then put the strip on immediately, and I rubbed it a little.     </li>
<li> I tried a thick layer...a thin layer, a super thin layer.</li>
<li> You end up with a sticky layer of wax on you and a wasted strip.</li>
<li> Ugh - what a waste of money.</li>
<li> Waste of money in my opinion.</li>
<li> Waste of time, effort and money/</li>
<li> The stupid clear strips in this kit just tore and barely removed any hair.  </li>
<li> It is by far the least painful waxing method I&#x27;ve used (including salon waxing), and yet the wax preparation is not especially sticky.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Really.  This does absolutely nothing.  It&#x27;s not that messy because it washes right off with water.  And there in lies the problem.  It does not remove hair at all.</li>
    <li> this was terrible. I followed all the directions, and tried to use as little \\&quot;wax\\&quot; as possible since it said to use very sparingly, but no matter what I did NO hairs came out. seriously maybe 3 in the course of an hour trying. the worst hair removal product I&#x27;ve ever tried. another reviewer said the consistency was like honey and that it didn&#x27;t seem to grip the hairs.. I totally agree. it goes on really liquid-y and when you rip it off stays mostly on your leg. I would NEVER buy again!</li>
    <li> This product did nothing for me.  I have waxed using many different products and this I think is clearly the least effective.  I followed all the directions and got no results.  Basically the wax just stuck to my legs and almost no hair came off where it didn&#x27;t.  Waste of money in my opinion.</li>
    <li> This has got to be one of the best waxes I&#x27;ve tried.  I did have to wait a little while for my hair to grow out, the first time I tried it the hair wasn&#x27;t long enough.    After that, though, it removed about 80% of the hair, the others probably still weren&#x27;t long enough.  It is also most painless wax I&#x27;ve used.  Great for people who are worried about waxing pain.  I highly reccomend this product and will continue using it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used several different wax kits over the years and this is by far the worst. Not a single hair came off.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been waxing for years, and while I have a preferred product, occasionally I try something new to see if I might like it better.  That said, I purchased this a week or so ago, and finally tried it out tonight.  I heated it according to the directions and applied it to my underarm.  I was skeptical about the strips, and when nothing came off I wasn&#x27;t surprised - so I used some of my muslin strips thinking they might get a better grip.  I should say at this point - I have had problems with waxes not removing all the hair in one pull, but they usually do get a fair amount - just not all, so I have to use a second strip.  Unfortunately this wax did not take off ANY hair - not a single one.  I tried it on the hair on my legs with, which of course is longer, and had the same pitiful result even with the muslin strips.  I was so disappointed with this product, I went to the company&#x27;s website to write a review, but the only option is to give a star rating.  If there was a \\&quot;0\\&quot; rating, that is what I would give this one.  Don&#x27;t waste your money - at least not if you have coarse hair.  If I can find my receipt I will be returning this to the store.</li>
    <li> I read the reviews for the product(which were not great) but i bought it wanting to try it myself. I used it and found it to work just perfectly. I heated up the wax in the microwave for about 40secs or so though the instructions say we can also use it at room temperature but i doubt that it will.(u&#x27;l need to heat up several times, whenver it gets cold) I have tried different wax before but i can say from my experience that you always need the wax heated up well to be able to wax smoothly and painlessly. Also, i used different wax strips.. one with pores(somehow i don&#x27;t trust the plastic ones).. and i got a perfect result. The wooden spatula and aloe lotion are great. i will recommend the product.. there&#x27;s nothing bad about it.. just we have it follow the right method of waxing.</li>
    <li> This product doesn&#x27;t work at all.  Did the manufacturer actually test this product before putting it on shelves?  It grabbed about three hairs and left 95% still intact.  How does this crap actually get in legitimate stores?  Seriously its bad.</li>
    <li> Ok, so I got this product and I got the same results as all those people who wrote the 1 star reviews.   Then I just thought, there is no way that a product would just not work like this.     I gave it another try, and it worked great. What you have to do, is apply the wax extremely thin. What I did is I applied it, and then with the edge of the applicator scraped the access wax off, so the remaining layer is super-dooper thin.  Then put the strip on immediately, and I rubbed it a little.     The next step, where it can go wrong is when you pull the strip off. The thing is, that you have to do it really, really fast. I had to do it a LOT faster, and stronger then when I&#x27;m using my other wax. Also, don&#x27;t wait too much.    Also, it worked better for me when the stuff started to cool off a little bit. I think if it&#x27;s too hot the wax is just too runny for it to grab anything.  When I did exactly what I just described, all of the hair came off. But, you really need to follow the instructions.    After all, I think I&#x27;ll use this product again, I only gave it 4 stars because it&#x27;s not the easiest thing to figure out.</li>
    <li> I do not have any difficulty waxing.  My hair normally comes out easily.  This did not work.  It only took out a few hairs and left my skin irritated.  My skin does not get irritated easily!  I am sorry I bought this!</li>
    <li> This product does not work. I read the instructions, applied the wax as directed, and tore off the strip, only to find ALL of the hair still under my arm. Not even one hair was stuck to the strip! And my hair is pretty fine. Oh, and the wax was very sticky and took some maneuvering not to make a huge mess. This is the second time I&#x27;ve had these issues with Sally Hansen; I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll be buying this brand again.</li>
    <li> I have loved sugar based waxes in the past and so was excited to try this version that was said to be great for sensitive areas.  However, after a lot of trial and all error, I&#x27;m not happy with this wax at all.      The wax is the consistency of honey, which means it doesn&#x27;t \\&quot;grab\\&quot; on to the hair very well, and certainly doesn&#x27;t stick to the odd plastic-like strips.  So when you pull the strip, not all the wax is removed and none of the hair.  You end up with a sticky layer of wax on you and a wasted strip. I tried to quickly apply another strip, but still the wax didn&#x27;t pull off easily.  Thankfully, the sugar based product does wash off easily with water. But if the hair doesn&#x27;t come out, it&#x27;s a useless product.    Also, the directions say, \\&quot;be sure you can see the hairs through the strip and wax to ensure that you aren&#x27;t using too much\\&quot; but the wax is clear!!  I could see the hair through it even if I used the whole tub all at once!  I saw another reviewer who said to use it VERY sparingly.  I&#x27;m willing to try again (since I already bought it) using even less wax, but I&#x27;m doubtful that it will ever work for me.</li>
    <li> I have tried this product about four times now since I bought it, each time thinking \\&quot;maybe it will work this time\\&quot;.  But it has disappointed me every time.  I guess I&#x27;ll just throw it out and call it a loss because not one single hair came out.  I even went out and and bought woven strips instead of the plastic ones provided, thinking maybe that was the issue.  It still didn&#x27;t work.  Ugh - what a waste of money.</li>
    <li> This is by far the best home wax kit I&#x27;ve tried (and I&#x27;ve tested most on the market).  As advertised, the clear strips make it easy to see whether hair has been removed and to avoid making \\&quot;mistakes\\&quot; when following a hairline.  I did need to apply the strip twice to some areas where there were stubborn hairs or multiple hair growth patterns, but this is easy to do -- if you work quickly, you do not even need to reapply wax, just press the strip into place again.  The only time I had difficulty removing hair is when too much wax was used, so apply it very sparingly.    I&#x27;d rate this a 3 out of 10 in terms of pain.  I was very pleasantly surprised. I only flinched a couple of times, and I&#x27;m a real wimp when it comes to hair removal!  I always feel like I&#x27;ll start crying when I&#x27;m at a salon! It is by far the least painful waxing method I&#x27;ve used (including salon waxing), and yet the wax preparation is not especially sticky.  The others I&#x27;ve tried have been very difficult to remove when finished (leading to great difficulty once getting it all over my fingers in the process) whereas this washed off easily with water.  My only complaints are that the wax cooled very quickly, necessitating a several re-warmings in order to finish my legs, and that the kit comes with a very small amount of the plastic removal strips compared to the amount of wax.</li>
    <li> the product was great, just as those i previously bought in the store. the shipping was fast. i find this wax to work best and hope it won&#x27;t get discontinued.</li>
    <li> I bought this product thinking it would be better than the hard wax that I was using.  NOT AT ALL. By the end of using this product, I was hairy and sticky. Waste of time, effort and money/</li>
    <li> doesn&#x27;t work - I tried the clear strips that came with the kit and also went out and bought cotton ones - neither one worked</li>
    <li> I think this is the best self waxing product available to the public.  It does it&#x27;s job well and cleans up easily.  Take a shower afterward and  any residue is gone.  I&#x27;ve been disappointed by other products.  Honestly, this is the only product I&#x27;ll use.  I hope they don&#x27;t discontinue it.</li>
    <li> This product is good. You just have to know how to use it and be patient. Very handy for home use.&lt;br /&gt;On the go you need something else. It usually works as good as the salon.</li>
    <li> Shave or just be hairy. This stuff isn&#x27;t the answer. Worthless plastic that doesn&#x27;t press over body parts very nice and an equally lazy jar of sticky &#x27;wax&#x27;. Boo, Sally Hansen! You ruin everything!</li>
    <li> It was not the same as before it did Not work the wax was very watery</li>
    <li> Because of the price compared to the competition, I tried the Sally Hansen Honey Wax kit.    I did not like it for three main reasons:  1. the \\&quot;honey wax\\&quot; is not sticky enough to do the job. It&#x27;s too gooey, and it&#x27;s not really honey or wax but corn syrup.  2. the \\&quot;corn plastic\\&quot; strips are really difficult to work with, and not flexible enough to work around knees and ankles.  3. When you take the time for this project, go through the sticky mess, the ripping off strips, etc., to be left with hairy legs in the end, it&#x27;s really aggravating.  Save your money and try something else.</li>
    <li> i&#x27;ve been waxing for almost 5 years now and this wax is wax. i didn&#x27;t like the hair remover strips it came with AT ALL. this plastic stuff didn&#x27;t adhere to the wax one bit. it even made it hurt to pull. i went to local beauty store and bought some strips there. THEN it worked. it heats up quickly, and stays hot for a while. that&#x27;s a plus! so...you can take it back to the bathroom without making a mess in the kitchen. for my arms, i only had to reheat it once. so bravo there. however, i&#x27;ve started to use a thicker type of wax that doesn&#x27;t require strips. less waste and no need to buy more stuff. i&#x27;ll finish off this container, but i probably won&#x27;t purchase again unless there was an insane sale on it.</li>
    <li> I used this product with great satisfaction. A word of caution: carefully read the instructions, do not overheat the wax, and test the temperature before use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, this beats spa and salon visits by a wide margin. Very good experience.</li>
    <li> This product does not work so well for me. I used it in areas that are coarse and not so coarse but it only removed about 10 - 0% of the hair. I followed the directions precisely and even tried to alter it a little so that the results would be a little better, but nothing worked.</li>
    <li> Ok, the strips in this kit are absolutely worthless, but the wax itself is good.  I used it with the cloth strips I had saved from a Nads kit, similar to these [[ASIN:B00198XSG0 Fantasea Non-Woven Facial &amp; Body Wax Strips]] and it worked great!  The stupid clear strips in this kit just tore and barely removed any hair.  This wax rinses off your skin easily, unlike Sally Hansen&#x27;s purple lavender wax that sticks to you no matter how hard you try to remove it.</li>
    <li> The wax was dark yellow and too thick to spread even when I warmed it up.  I think it was old.  I don&#x27;t recommend buying it online.  :-(</li>
    <li> Works great I enjoyed using it.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t work at all. Im disappointed. I should have listened to the other reviews. I tried a thick layer...a thin layer, a super thin layer. No results.</li>
    <li> The negative reviews say this wax gets no hair. If the hair is too short, no wax can really get it.  If it&#x27;s too long, it&#x27;s extra painful. Your skin and hair CAN&#x27;T be wet, it has to be clean dry skin, without a recent shower. You spread on a THIN layer, press the strip down firmly and pull it back up as close to the skin as possible.  If you pull away from the skin you can rip it away from underlying tissues and cause some pretty nasty bruising. I&#x27;ve had GREAT success with this wax, and apart from their apparently now discontinued white chocolate wax, it&#x27;s their ONLY wax I will use. It gets all the hair, and rinses off easily in warm water. NO residue. You&#x27;ll need to save up your strips because there aren&#x27;t nearly enough. Follow the instructions, and it&#x27;s their best waxing product by leaps and bounds.</li>
