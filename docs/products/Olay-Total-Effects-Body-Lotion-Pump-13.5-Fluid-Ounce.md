      <li>I would be willing to use the lotion if they came out with a fragrance free version.</li>
      <li>Good lotion to use after you shower or when you feel dry like cotton mouth.  </li>
      <li>I am sensitive to strong smells and find this to be a light fragrance.  </li>

      <li>I usually love Olay products, but Olay Total Effects Body Lotion hurts when I put it on after shaving my legs.</li>
      <li>Months later I&#x27;m completely satisfied with the results but finding it still too pricey.</li>
      <li>the fragrance is pretty stong though.</li>
      <li>Keeps me feeling soft and smooth all day.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This is, by far, the best lotion I have ever tried!! I KNOW that I won&#x27;t be trying any other brands, I found the answer I was looking for. This lotion feels cool to the skin, absorbs beautifully and leaves my older skin feeling silky and smooth. Pleasant smell too.</li>
    <li> Googled most soothing, non-greasy, anti-aging body lotion and this came up.  Got a great deal on Amazon by buying 2.  Very rich, absorbs in my dry, sun-abused 50 yr old skin, and even has a nice scent.  Highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I love all Olay products. I own them all from Olay body wash to body lotion to the entire face care line.  This product works well but the smell is so weird to that I can&#x27;t even describe it. All that comes to my mind is a bad outdated purfume. I do not have a sensitive sense of smell at all and the smell alone is why I am giving this product away. Unless people are reviewing about a different lotion than the \\&quot;total effects body lotion\\&quot;, I truly don&#x27;t understand how anyone could like it.</li>
    <li> I figured I would write a comment because I feel 1 star is a bit extreme for this lotion. I am almost out of my second bottle. I like this lotion for its moisturizing effects. the fragrance is pretty stong though. It would be the perfect lotion if the fragrance was toned down a bit. overall, I like it and will continue using it.</li>
    <li> I love this body lotion and what I like most is the way it makes my skin feel so smooth and hydrated.  And I don&#x27;t know what the other reviewers are talking about, I love the way it smells. This is a great price, I will definitly be buying this again.</li>
    <li> I love this lotion! It&#x27;s very gentle on my skin(sensitive skin) and does exactly what it says :) would definetly buy again!</li>
    <li> I love the lotion.  Works well for dry skin</li>
    <li> I was very excited to try this product &amp; although it did make my skin feel very soft, I was only able to use it once as the fragrance is extremely overpowering.  I strongly do not recommend this lotion for anyone who has asthma, allergies, or any sensitivity to strong fragrances.  I immediately got a headache right after using. I am unable to use this lotion for that reason.  I would be willing to use the lotion if they came out with a fragrance free version. Very disappointed!</li>
    <li> I still have not received this product. When I placed my order for this it did not say that the item was out of stock. I talked to a CSR and they assured me that the item would be stocked as soon as possible. This was last week mind you on the 14 to be exact. Plenty of time to restock the item if you ask me.</li>
    <li> Love this body lotion. I am in my 50s; the skin on my legs was very dry and dehydrated but this lotion has restored suppleness and added a glow with a sheen of microscopic glitter. Good value for money. Nice pump bottle.</li>
    <li> I love this lotion.  It does everything promised in the ads. Has a nice light perfume. Goes on smooth and begins to work instantly without leaving a oily substance on your body. I use it daily year around.</li>
    <li> I put this all over my body right after I get out of the shower. It definitely makes my skin super super soft &amp; silky! I love it!</li>
    <li> I usually love Olay products, but Olay Total Effects Body Lotion hurts when I put it on after shaving my legs.</li>
    <li> Great purchase. Was a great product and was shipped very fast. very happy with this product. it is everything as stated in the description plus more. I am very satisfied in it.</li>
    <li> The secret is out (and affordable) for soft, younger looking skin.  This lotion isn&#x27;t greasy and perfect for everyday use.</li>
    <li> I have tried several other lotions but always come back to this Olay body lotion (7).  It makes your skin feel very soft.  I have thrown out the other lotions.</li>
    <li> I used it for 2 weeks now and find this lotion to be very drying on my skin. Also, makes my skin feel more loose amd more aged and strech marks more pronounced. FYI, I use it daily after i use Olay total effects body wash. Both I will stop using.</li>
    <li> It does what it is designed to do.</li>
    <li> I had very dry skin until i started using olay total effects body lotion. I love this stuff and now i cant live without it!!</li>
    <li> This lotion has great product reviews.  The niacinamide is great for the skin.  I use along with AHA products.</li>
    <li> Love it...it moisturizes great and smells so good.  I&#x27;ve out it several locations through my house for easy access and convenience</li>
    <li> Good lotion to use after you shower or when you feel dry like cotton mouth.  smells good and clean and refreshing.  Though i wish they can make the scent a MANLY scent not just a female floral flowerly scent.  Olay anti age products all do work extremely well for their $$.</li>
    <li> I use the lotion every time I get out of the shower. I like that it doesn&#x27;t have a strong smell so it doesn&#x27;t compete with my perfume. A couple other reviewers stated that is has a strong odor.  I have never noticed this and neither has my husband.  It does really seem to help my skin&#x27;s elasticity. I have also noticed the crepey skin that was starting on my arms has diminished to the point where it is almost not noticeable any longer. It also helps with dryness more than any other lotion I have used. I love all Olay products and this one is no exception. It is a little on the expensive side for the amount you get, but I feel it is worth it.</li>
    <li> i ordered these two products on april 10,2012 and they arrived on time.i love the way they smell,not strongly scented as i read in the reviews. it glides smoothly on the skin and dries really fast, my only issue with this product is that its not as big as it appears on the website,i recommend that customers check the weight in oz/ml b4 so there are no suprises.otherwise the purchase was worthwhile.my greatest disappointment was with the olay total effects body wash,omg!!! it was as tiny as a feeding bottle, i wish olay could make it bigger, good price though.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this lotion for about a year and love it. I tried it because I&#x27;m a firm believer in Olay products. I was running low on the lotion so I opted to look for a better deal on Amazon and was happy to find this!  I use this lotion about every day so worth buying two bottles. I have found it keeps my skin moisturized, soft and young looking. I&#x27;m only 25 but I want to keep my skin in great condition and I think this lotion would be beneficial to all ages. I like to keep a separate bottle that I use once or twice per week which I mix 7 effects lotion with tanning lotion to keep my skin slightly tinted year round.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S. I also have the Olay 7 effects body wash which is wonderful if you are in a hurry and do not have time to put on lotion after the shower. Just use the wash and your skin will feel soft &amp; moisturized. Not as good as lotion but great for busy summer days when you have to wear dresses/skirts!</li>
    <li> Olay total Effects, seven signs of aging body lotion.  I absolutely love love love this product, I can&#x27;t get it in Australia, so I purchase it here at Amazon.  It is so easy to apply, I put it all over my body, it makes my skin feel and look so very smooth &amp; eventoned, it also smells so divine, I always get compliments about it.  I am 44 years of age and the Australian sun can absolutely murder your skin, and I have found that this body lotion is perfect for this climate, and ensures that my skin won&#x27;t dry out and wrinkle during the summer months.</li>
    <li> EXCELENTE PRODUCTO EXCELENTE CALIDAD Y SUPER ACORDE CON EL TAMAÑO  LOS FELICITO POR PRESENTAR PRODUCTOS DE ESTA CALIDAD JSIUDIUDF IYDFIUYF</li>
    <li> This lotion is okay, a bit too perfumed for my liking and I developed a rash when wearing it. I would not recommended for those with sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I did not like the smell of this lotion.  After two bottles, did not notice any extra results.  Going back to my previous brand.</li>
    <li> I absolutely looove this item.  The lotion is great and is not to oily.  Also smells amazing and is not to strong.  I wear this every day and have no complaints.</li>
    <li> I had an issue with dark circles under my eyes and dry skin and after using this product for two months there is a huge difference.</li>
    <li> Olay Total Effects makes so of the finest anti-aging products out there, and at prices everyone can afford.  I&#x27;ve tried alot of the Dept. store products and always come running back to my Oil of Olay.</li>
    <li> I bought this product at the encouragement of my friend&#x27;s sister. I&#x27;d prefer greener packaging and a fresher and longer lasting lotion. It&#x27;s also not easy to rub into my skin and I don&#x27;t like the scent.</li>
    <li> I love Olay Body Lotion. Keeps me feeling soft and smooth all day. Recommend to all to give it a try!</li>
    <li> I use this lotion daily along with the body wash.  It literally changed my skin after a week of using it.</li>
    <li> does exactly what it says.  I am sensitive to strong smells and find this to be a light fragrance.  Will defintelty buy again</li>
    <li> doesn&#x27;t seem to do anything for my skin,not pleased..have used olay products for years,this product would be my least favorite....</li>
    <li> My friend told me about this cream and she was right. It&#x27;s fabulous! My skin has never felt so smooth...it&#x27;s luxurious!</li>
    <li> This product is the best lotion I have ever tried, it is non sticky and it delivers its promise. it is so silky and smooth on skin, fragrance is lovely. I will definitely order this again.</li>
    <li> The only kind I buy. Works so well and it isn&#x27;t greasy.</li>
    <li> I am 28 and a mother of five wonderful kids, life has always been hectic so it wasn&#x27;t until recently that I decided to take better care of my skin. I use to work in a greenhouse...the effects? It left my skin nicely colored but my skin dried out quite a bit and was no longer as soft as it used to be. I had even some minor wrinkles in the corners of my eyes. So I used Olay&#x27;s 7 in 1 facial moisturizer first. It was priced at $23 for 1.7 oz.. pricey for me but thought I&#x27;d give it shot. Within a few weeks the lines were visibly minimized and my skin felt almost as good as my toddlers it was a very pleasant surprise. So I continued to use it and say more subtle but wonderful results in my skin. Months later I&#x27;m completely satisfied with the results but finding it still too pricey. So one day while about to purchase another one of the moisturizers I noticed walgreens had a sale on the same line but all over body lotion. So I figured since my skin wasn&#x27;t so bad lately maybe I can use this instead. So I bought it instead and took it home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since using these product I am more than happy at my decision to purchase it. It worked well on my face..I just didn&#x27;t like how it felt a little greasy when I applied it or the fragrance hence the 4 out of 5 stars. However, It had unexpected rewards. I have used Mederma,Coco Butter and various other creams to get my skin softer, more toned and minimize the stretchmarks I have acquired since having my kids. They worked only marginally well and weren&#x27;t worth the cost or time for me to invest in. After a month of using this lotion a few times a week on only a few problem areas. I not only got the softness and tone that I had wanted but noticed that beyond toned my skin was firming up and the stretchmarks had visibly diminished. Not only that but several of my childhood scars were almost completely non existent. So, startled by the results I decided to use it all over.. 3 weeks later I noticed the same results on everywhere else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have since recommenced this product to my friends and am considering giving this out as gifts to new mothers. i recommend you use this after a shower since that is the best time for your skin to absorb the lotion. For ten dollars it is more than worth your time and money for the results I have encountered. It may not have as dramatic results for you as it did for me...but even the minimal results are worth taking a shot!/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have since recommenced this product to my friends and am considering giving this out as gifts to new mothers. i recommend you use this after a shower since that is the best time for your skin to absorb the lotion.

    <li> I love this product.  I originally bought it in a local store and then once I was hooked, they stopped carrying it.  This will be the second time I have purchased the lotion from Amazon.  Other reviewers have mentioned it having an over powering or sour smell and I have never experienced that.  It has a light fragrant smell but in my opinion not over powering at all.  In fact, my husband even uses it and he doesn&#x27;t go \\&quot;girlie\\&quot; scented products.  I do have to say that it tends to go out of stock on Amazon a lot.  I was very excited when I got an alert saying that it was back in stock but am slightly confused as to why I have to wait for 1 to 3 weeks to receive it (just entered the second week of waiting).</li>
    <li> Pros: It makes my skin super soft&lt;br /&gt;  It does indeed brighten my skin tone&lt;br /&gt;  It has reduced the appearance of my stretch marks&lt;br /&gt;  It smells nice&lt;br /&gt;  It has evened my skin tone out a bit&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons: The smell is very strong and makes me a bit nauseous, but the smell does get a lot less strong overnight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over all a nice product.</li>
