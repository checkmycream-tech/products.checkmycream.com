    <li> My Gf loves this perfume and i must say I agree.</li>
    <li> Love it and fast speedy shipping</li>
    <li> This perfume is very hard to find and Amazon of course is the one place that has it and at a resonable price.  The scent is very nice and airy, but there is a downside.  The scent doens&#x27;t last very long.  When i spray iton it lasts maybe 2 hours and the scent is gone.  I initally found this in a perfume shop, but didn&#x27;t want to pay the high price.  The scent was lovely but once i bought it I was somewhat disappointed by it&#x27;s longevity.</li>
    <li> I purchased three for gifts. One of the bottles was defective and the issue was resolved right away to my satisfaction.. I am a very pleased in how it was handled!!</li>
    <li> I love this fragrance and sometimes it&#x27;s hard to find so I always buy two at a time when I find it.</li>
    <li> I love the scent, it&#x27;s my third bottle.</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this perfume. I am rather particular about what I wear. I like clean, fresh smelling things that are not overpowering and this fits the bill!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very happy with this, glad I could find it cheaper on amazon versus through perfume stores in the mall.</li>
    <li> I enjoy this perfume, because I don&#x27;t smell it on me like most perfume.  It smells great and fresh.  Most of my co-workers compliment my perfume.  It last for about six hours or so.  It has a fresh scent.</li>
    <li> Everything was shipped on time and the product came in as posted</li>
    <li> My husband gave this to me for a Christmas gift a couple years back I love the smell and get many compliments on it. It&#x27;s not a strong scent but stays with you all day</li>
    <li> Here&#x27;s a link to all the notes in this perfume: [...]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a deep fruity floral that works in almost any season and it&#x27;s awesome! The only problem I have is that the top notes fade faster than I hoped they would. The middle and base notes stick around for quite a while, though. I got this as a Christmas gift a while ago when it was priced at $80, and when I saw it for $20 here while I was looking for a spring/summer scent I knew I had to have it.</li>
    <li> It smells okay wouldn&#x27;t purchase it again</li>
    <li> One of my all time favorite perfumes. I was actually introduced to this fragrance about 8 years ago when I was living in New York as an undergrad. I actually bought it from a guy selling perfume on the street. I loved it and was never able to find again after it ran out. I was SOOO happy when I found this being sold on Amazon as I had tried multiple perfume stores and no one knew what I was talking about. Love that it&#x27;s not very popular and so you don&#x27;t find yourself smelling like anyone else. I also get plenty of compliments when I&#x27;m wearing it!</li>
    <li> Love. Love. Love. The smell is light and fresh. The price is just right too! A dealer quoted me $40! The only downside is that the scent fades rather quickly.</li>
    <li> Very happy to have found my perfume so easily! This was a gift a year ago and loved the scent.</li>
    <li> I love this perfume it smells great I always get asked what kind of perfume I&#x27;m wearing and where did I get it from.</li>
    <li> Love the scent, would have done five stars, just needs to last longer on the scent I seem to like all his parfums.</li>
    <li> Very good , quick delivery and exactly what I wanted .... I love it!</li>
    <li> It has a really nice, soft scent! For the price, this perfume is a great deal!</li>
