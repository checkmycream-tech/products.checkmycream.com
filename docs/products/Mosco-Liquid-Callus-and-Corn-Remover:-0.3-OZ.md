<ol>
      <li>great product!</li>
      <li>Amazon has the best price.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s incredible!</li>
      <li>very good product, works well.</li>
      <li>I think the callus n corn remover has done a good job on my feet!  </li>
      <li>It may work great for others.</li>
      <li>And works great..</li>
      <li>i know, lol.</li>
      <li>ive bought this product before and it worked great</li>
      <li>I have experienced great results.</li>
      <li>WORKS GREAT.  </li>
      <li>great deal would buy again</li>
      <li>really is great</li>
      <li>This product worked great.</li>
      <li>so you have to be very deft and drop it on your calluses immediately.&lt;br</li>
      <li>so that was good.</li>
      <li>good on 6th toe if you have one growing</li>
      <li>This product works good its almost like a wart freeze off but for getting rid of callus and corns.</li>
      <li>good product.</li>
      <li>GOOD BUY</li>
      <li>This one is the best, it works fast and you&#x27;ll receive great results.</li>
      <li>Love it!</li>
      <li>This is an effective way to remove callouses from my toes.</li>
      <li>If this happens, it will disappear on its own, with the help of some kind of ointment and discontinued use of the product</li>
      <li>I figured I would start in January to use this product to have nice toes by the summer time.</li>
      <li>Medicine is very effective and worth ordering.</li>
      <li>Another thing I was using most of my life Dr. Scholl&#x27;s corn remover never worked.</li>
      <li>so i guess i&#x27;ll have to buy more.</li>
      <li>i still have some more corns to remove</li>
      <li>The corns would swell up and the top layer would peel off.</li>
      <li>it did remove my corn but the liquid dries up even more the more i use it.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s getting better and better,&lt;br</li>
      <li>/&gt;You need a better way to store the medicine.</li>
      <li>I am glad that Amazon carries it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>better</li>
      <li>Which is not how I remembered it looking that day before after I peeled the top layer</li>
      <li>This is definitely the best price on the internet and believe me I checked everywhere!</li>
      <li>it might also helped that I used cushions afterwards so that more pressure isn&#x27;t place on the corns.</li>
      <li>Glad to have found this product here.</li>
      <li>: don&#x27;t apply it on the healthy skin.</li>
      <li>The skin on top of the calluses peeled away, but a noticeable callus is still there.</li>
      <li>worked better than going to see the doctors for 70.00 and thats just the beginning of costs to repair foot damage.</li>
      <li>Good product at right price</li>
      <li>when i get into the showere and scub my callus it almost removed the whole thing this coupled with a good foot scub works wonders</li>
      <li>The liquid dries very quickly</li>
      <li>Plus with my Prime membership and free two day shipping I have what I want almost immediately.  </li>
      <li>It is such a great product.</li>
      <li>and so far so good.</li>
      <li>This is why I love Amazon because I love a bargain as much as I love super high heels.</li>
      <li>It works amazingly but the only reason I didn&#x27;t give it a 5 was because it was very strong</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried dr. scholls corn remover consistently for more than 2 weeks and the corn was still there.</li>
      <li>I originally called a podiatrist for an oversized corn, but they wouldn&#x27;t see a first-time patient for that reason.</li>
      <li>(worth it to me though!).</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s good to have extra bottles on hand when you need it.</li>
      <li>Its good it actually removes corn</li>
      <li>But other then that great product..</li>
      <li>It works but dries out quick.</li>
      <li>the shipping was quick though.</li>
      <li>I love super hot, super high heel shoes.</li>
      <li>then I would get to the core and it would pop out showing fresh skin under it.</li>
      <li>Its effective but please be informed that this product CAN turn your skin white.</li>
      <li>but I must say after each time I adjusted shoe with more space and padding were old corn</li>
      <li>its some powerful stuff.</li>
      <li>but the corn just flaked up and peeled right off.</li>
      <li>but after 2 weeks, they peeled right off.</li>
      <li>It was with almost desperation that I tried the Mosco Liquid Callus &amp; Corn Remover, and I&#x27;m pleased to say that it eventually eradicated the callus entirely.</li>
      <li>It removed the corn but only the top skin.</li>
      <li>I would peel off in layers, add more Mosco and repeat a couple of days later..  </li>
      <li>This actually works pretty well however it more softens the corns then removers them</li>
      <li>While these shoes look really sexy on they can definitely leave your feet a bit battered</li>
      <li>And thank goodness no weird smell..</li>
      <li>I used the product the first day and could already see the changes, I thought my mind was playing tricks on me to make me believe it was working.</li>
      <li>When it turned white I could literally peel the top layer off which is what I did.</li>
      <li>A bargain on super high heels is nirvana</li>
      <li>recommend this be used in conjunction with a good foot scrub (or plain baking soda and bar soap) along with a moisturizer like Corn Husker&#x27;s or Kerasal for long-lasting results.</li>
      <li>So I&#x27;m corn free and now using this product on the darkened skin on my big toes from where it rubs against the shoe, but I almost have baby fresh toes</li>
      <li>After a few applications you can see peel the skin away on my corns which leaves me more comfortable throughout the day.</li>
      <li>First off, it took the product much longer to come than projected.</li>
      <li>really works</li>
      <li>After applying for a couple of days, I use a pumice stone and remove much of the callus</li>
      <li>I really like the outcome but</li>
      <li>I was hoping this product would help get rid of them, but it didn&#x27;t seem to do much.</li>
      <li>I have used this product for years and it works really well.  </li>
      <li>I have struggled with a chronic baby-toe corn for MUCH of my childhood and young-adult life.</li>
      <li>Thanks.</li>
      <li>It dries very quicky in the bottle.</li>
      <li>The Mosco  callus and corn remover works real good.&lt;br /&gt;Once</li>
      <li>but it works really well.</li>
      <li>Thanks Amazon/Mosco</li>
      <li>This stuff is VERY SMELLY!&lt;br /&gt;-</li>
      <li>Didn&#x27;t really work as well as I wanted it to.</li>
      <li>Product was delivered fast...</li>
      <li>it was ready to come it.</li>
      <li>I would purchase again, really easy to use just wish it didn&#x27;t dry out so fast.</li>
      <li>this is so much better then the other product on market.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a fan of the liquid corn remover but this particular brand is not the best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s the only product I know that actually removes the corn safely.  </li>
      <li>Tbh I wasn&#x27;t very consistent about it and used it on and off for 2 weeks expecting it to have the same result as dr. scholls.</li>
      <li>So I got in contact with the manufacturer and they assured me that it was normal and that I should keep using it so that the corn could fully disappear</li>
      <li>Should have just burned my feet if i wanted it to get more darker waste of my money</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Because I didn&#x27;t receive the liquid. Instead the bandaid style arrived.</li>
    <li> It works but dries out quick. I would purchase again, really easy to use just wish it didn&#x27;t dry out so fast.</li>
    <li> Well it seems to be working. But some of the corns seems to be taking longer to remove than the other. Just have to be patient. It helps me to walk around in sandals without being ashamed of my toes.</li>
    <li> I bought this product looking for a solution to my corns, one of which resently became painful. I chose to buy this product because out of all of the products on Amazon it had the least amount of negative reviews but that was a misjudgement on my part. First off, it took the product much longer to come than projected. When it finally came, however, I immediately  began using it. I have been using it religiously for two weeks straight with absolutely no results besides my corns sort of softening but not removing. Also the product left a prominant white residue on the areas where I applied it which made it impossible to wear sandals or walk around barefoot without embarrasment. Lastly after about a week and a half the product turned into a gooey almost gelatin like mess that was impossible to use! I am not happy at all with this product or the result.</li>
    <li> The item is not available in store anymore so i purchase online&gt; Never had any problems and the product is delivered within 3 days of ordering the product. Its always a new bottle. Would recommend buying from seller anytime.</li>
    <li> If your skin tone is tan get prepared for this product to turn your corn white!!  I&#x27;m five days into the product and not sure if it&#x27;s working.  The skin color makes it look worse than it was before, I had to hide it with band aids.</li>
    <li> it did remove my corn but the liquid dries up even more the more i use it. i still have some more corns to remove so i guess i&#x27;ll have to buy more. it does turn the affected area white but new skin grew back quick so that was good. also right after i bought i saw this at my local walmart so i could have just bought it there instead of waiting for it to arrive. the shipping was quick though.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not new to this product I&#x27;ve been using it for years and it work well for me tried other corn remover and they never works as well as mosco. will</li>
    <li> Its good it actually removes corn but it not permanent. They come back and you have to continue using.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> Hi I just got another bottle of this stuff from you this is one hell of a product it did get rid of a corn I had for years from walking with a bad foot over 30 years this is so much better then the other product on market. Thanks. Another thing I was using most of my life Dr. Scholl&#x27;s corn remover never worked. Hi all I can say is when I used it on my corn it took 18 days of putting it on and if it built up I would pick or file it down . Then I tried it about 18 days on my callus on side of foot which may of been a corn . Also worked but I must say after each time I adjusted shoe with more space and padding were old corn was this stuff really works I have used dr. Scholl corn remover for half my life on and off never worked this product really is great the stores should this on shelf space. I am not a doctor.</li>
    <li> great deal would buy again</li>
    <li> This product is mediocre. It dries very quicky in the bottle. It removed the corn but only the top skin. I could not use the product after this so I can&#x27;t state if it wil completely eliminate the corn:{</li>
    <li> Even though I used this as per instructions,It did not remove all of the callous so I had to purchase another product. I will not purchase this product again.</li>
    <li> I have used this product now for about 1 year. I have experienced great results. Dr. Scholl&#x27;s products are no contest in comparison. I love this product, they no longer sale it in stores in my area, so I was forced to seek it on-line through Amazon. I would not waste my money on any other products. I&#x27;ve tried other brands, they did not work. This one is the best, it works fast and you&#x27;ll receive great results. I will continue to purchase in the future if needed. Thanks Amazon/Mosco</li>
    <li> Forgot Dr. Scholls. Those foot products never work on my feet. They have nothing on this product. I have been using this product for years. I can&#x27;t seem to find it in any drug store.  If you want to remov a corn and you don&#x27;t want your toe to turn a different color, this product is for you.  It&#x27;s the only product I know that actually removes the corn safely.  I love this product so much that I bought two bottles as I was afraid I couldn&#x27;t find it again.</li>
    <li> I find this one works but it took mroe than one application , I used it with the small pads .</li>
    <li> This worked in 2 days, I applied twice one day the next day applied once than before bed it was ready to come it. It works amazingly but the only reason I didn&#x27;t give it a 5 was because it was very strong and it left a darker mark underneath. I&#x27;m hoping it fades away but other than than. This product is the one for you I promise you won&#x27;t regret it!!</li>
    <li> good product. thankyou</li>
    <li> ive bought this product before and it worked great but this last one that ive purchased cama dry and not guueew like its supoosed to...it didnt workk at all</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t really work as well as I wanted it to. Everyone is different. It may work great for others. I have stubborn toes!</li>
    <li> WORKS GREAT.  GOOD BUY</li>
    <li> Good product at right price</li>
    <li> I have used the corn remover since I got it and my corn still looks the same , not getting any smaller, it turns white when the medicine dries and then when I pull it off later it is just the medicine no removeral of the corn.</li>
    <li> When I was in middle school, I had about half a dozen warts on my hands. I tried all the Dr. Scholls bandaids for warts to no avail. After applying this product a few times, it worked! Now at 22, I got another wart on my thumb and am going to use this product again before they spread.</li>
    <li> Love it! It&#x27;s working! Corns be-gone! Finally a product that does something! Takes the corns away that you thought you&#x27;d never get rid of!</li>
    <li> I think the callus n corn remover has done a good job on my feet!  I,m seeing callus,s much less now than ever! Thanx!</li>
    <li> I put the Mosco Liquid on each day for 2 weeks.  The area started to peel and I was left with a large red bump that was very painful.  Will need to find something else.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years and it works really well.  It is not easy to find. I am glad that Amazon carries it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I now have 2 friends who want it too.</li>
    <li> this product removed my corn or bunion bumps that heels give you from long nights on your feet. worked better than going to see the doctors for 70.00 and thats just the beginning of costs to repair foot damage. i def recommend this product for any callus or bunion on feet.&lt;br /&gt;works good on 6th toe if you have one growing….ewww i know, lol. its some powerful stuff. great product!</li>
    <li> I tend to curl my toes and grind them into the carpet when sitting at my desk. This has left calluses on the tops of a couple of my toes. I was hoping this product would help get rid of them, but it didn&#x27;t seem to do much. I put it on a couple times per day for a few days. The skin on top of the calluses peeled away, but a noticeable callus is still there.</li>
    <li> I really like the outcome but the product dried up in less than a week and a half and I can&#x27;t use it anymore. I would buy it again and again.</li>
    <li> I had a persistent callus located at the crack between a toe and the bottom of the foot which was very difficult to reach. Nothing seemed to work at removing it. Some other products removed the outer layer, but never completely eradicated it, so the callus would regrow.  I even tried a foot scraper and a pumice stone, and neither helped. It was with almost desperation that I tried the Mosco Liquid Callus &amp; Corn Remover, and I&#x27;m pleased to say that it eventually eradicated the callus entirely. It took longer to do so than indicated by the product&#x27;s instructions, but that was likely because my callus was especially difficult to remove.</li>
    <li> It works!!! the corn hurts me a lot, can&#x27;t even walk,&lt;br /&gt;I applied it twice a day and it&#x27;s getting better and better,&lt;br /&gt;highly recommended!!!&lt;br /&gt;reminder: don&#x27;t apply it on the healthy skin.</li>
    <li> I had corns spreading all over the bottom of my feet due to my shoes. I wear rubber based shoes a lot without socks but that causes a lot of friction. I finally figured they seems to be corns. I wish I would have photographed the before and after. They were all over the ball of my foot and under my toes.  I used this Mosco Liquid every other day for a week on each spot, plus used a pumice to remove the build up and my feet look new. The corns would swell up and the top layer would peel off. I would peel off in layers, add more Mosco and repeat a couple of days later..  then I would get to the core and it would pop out showing fresh skin under it. It has since been almost six months and none of the spots have returned. This product worked great.</li>
    <li> Excellent product, it removed terrible corns I had.</li>
    <li> Product was delivered fast... And works great..I recommend this to anyone.. And thank goodness no weird smell.. Just makes your toes a little white.. But other then that great product..</li>
    <li> Burns and only single or use twice before liquid solidifies.  For the use,  it didn&#x27;t work as well as other name brands. Won&#x27;t buy again</li>
    <li> This actually works pretty well however it more softens the corns then removers them but it still helped with them all the same</li>
    <li> This is an effective way to remove callouses from my toes. The only problem is that the substance turns white when applied and it&#x27;s hard for me to comfortable wearing my toes out. I ordered regular 18% sacylic acid  and it&#x27;s the same as the active ingredient in this... Works just as well without the white residue.</li>
    <li> PROS:&lt;br /&gt;- Medication-wise, worked as well as those medicated pads.&lt;br /&gt;- I like that this liquid is customizeable - I have a few blisters right next to each other and those pads, having only a small surface area that&#x27;s medicated, wouldn&#x27;t work well for that. Plus the super sticky part didn&#x27;t work well on the bottom of my foot, always coming off a little and getting stuck on my socks &amp; shoes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;- The liquid dries very quickly so you have to be very deft and drop it on your calluses immediately.&lt;br /&gt;- This stuff is VERY SMELLY!&lt;br /&gt;- After a few months of use, the liquid congealed and dried into a jelly-like substance and became unusable.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s incredible! It work!</li>
    <li> Plain and simple, it works. And unlike Dr. Scholl&#x27;s, it doesn&#x27;t cake up and cause random, unsightly flaking of hardened skin. The applicator also has a brush on the end instead of a bare plastic stem. Dr. Scholl&#x27;s may work a day or two faster, but Mosco works *better*. It sloughs the skin instead of shocking it off. To piggyback what another reviewer said, it won&#x27;t turn your toes different colors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this be used in conjunction with a good foot scrub (or plain baking soda and bar soap) along with a moisturizer like Corn Husker&#x27;s or Kerasal for long-lasting results. Corns and callouses will always come back if you don&#x27;t take care of your feet.</li>
    <li> very good product, works well.</li>
    <li> Love that this product has a brush instead of a hard plastic  stick.  Medicine is very effective and worth ordering.</li>
    <li> This product was the only solution I could find for my corn. You have to apply it for about 2 weeks and the corn will vanish! It is such a great product. I tried other options as well like corn caps but they were all useless. This saved my life!</li>
    <li> The Mosco  callus and corn remover works real good.&lt;br /&gt;Once the bottle is open it dried out very fast. Only last&lt;br /&gt;a few days.&lt;br /&gt;You need a better way to store the medicine. The medicine&lt;br /&gt;is great!&lt;br /&gt;I lost money on this one.</li>
    <li> The first time I read about this I was skeptical. I used the product the first day and could already see the changes, I thought my mind was playing tricks on me to make me believe it was working. When it turned white I could literally peel the top layer off which is what I did. The next day I could see that on one of my feet the corn had went back to its original color but on the other corn it was white! Which is not how I remembered it looking that day before after I peeled the top layer off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got scared because I had a white toe and it looked hideous! I was terrified. So I got in contact with the manufacturer and they assured me that it was normal and that I should keep using it so that the corn could fully disappear and then it could heal. I did as told but the whiteness of it had me traumatized. I thought that that should be something of importance to let people know that that could happen when using this product. That was the only part I did not like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I stopped using the products after three days of usage because I could not stand to look at a white toe. After 3 days of not continuing to use the product and greasing it with Cocoa Butter Gel oil every night before bed, the color returned. I was shocked! I guess my other toe returned to its original color instantly because the corn was much smaller. Its effective but please be informed that this product CAN turn your skin white. If this happens, it will disappear on its own, with the help of some kind of ointment and discontinued use of the product</li>
    <li> I have struggled with a chronic baby-toe corn for MUCH of my childhood and young-adult life. If you have been through the same, I highly suggest considering this as a remedy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What happens is, this stuff pretty much scalds the dead skin of the corn and after a week or so, it will &amp;#34;loosen&amp;#34; so you can peel it off. I&#x27;m a fan of the liquid corn remover but this particular brand is not the best.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BUT, I do like the brush applicator. I just tossed the actual bottle and kept the brush applicator for the other brands of corn remover I use (that typically use the stupid stick applicator).</li>
    <li> This product works for me.  After a few applications you can see peel the skin away on my corns which leaves me more comfortable throughout the day.</li>
    <li> Worked well but dried out quickly in bottle.</li>
    <li> I have been using Dr. Sholls for years and this is much better, makes less of a mess and doesnt smell as strong.</li>
    <li> So I think some of the low scores made their comment prematurely. This product will make your toes look nasty, wherever you apply it to the corn the skin looks horrid, dry, dark, like a nasty raisin on your toe. I had been using it like 3-4 times with in a week in a half I figured I would start in January to use this product to have nice toes by the summer time. So needing to wear open toe heels I went to remove my nail polish before my shower and saw how bad my corns looked, dry and nasty looking. I&#x27;m not sure why I scratched at them but the corn just flaked up and peeled right off. So I&#x27;m corn free and now using this product on the darkened skin on my big toes from where it rubs against the shoe, but I almost have baby fresh toes I tell ya!.</li>
    <li> When I could no longer purchase this locally, I tried other products for the calluses on the bottom of my feet. Did not like them as well as MOSCO. I like the brush applicator. If I don&#x27;t use this periodically, my calluses build up and begin to hurt. After applying for a couple of days, I use a pumice stone and remove much of the callus and they don&#x27;t hurt any longer. Glad to have found this product here. Since I don&#x27;t have corns, can&#x27;t say how it works for them.</li>
    <li> Worked after one application</li>
    <li> This product works good its almost like a wart freeze off but for getting rid of callus and corns. I put it on at night before i go to sleep then when i get into the showere and scub my callus it almost removed the whole thing this coupled with a good foot scub works wonders</li>
    <li> I love super hot, super high heel shoes. The heel has to be at least 4 inches or I won&#x27;t even look at them. While these shoes look really sexy on they can definitely leave your feet a bit battered (worth it to me though!). The compression on your toes can create some vicious corns but this stuff removes them fast.  The smell is disgusting, which is to be expected, and it dries out fast after you open it but it works really well. I bought I single bottle because I wanted to try it before buying a six pack but this was much less expensive and since it does dry out quickly it&#x27;s good to have extra bottles on hand when you need it. This is definitely the best price on the internet and believe me I checked everywhere! I always do before I buy anything online and 8 out of 10 times Amazon has the best price. Plus with my Prime membership and free two day shipping I have what I want almost immediately.  This is why I love Amazon because I love a bargain as much as I love super high heels. A bargain on super high heels is nirvana (although sorry Amazon DSW has you beat there!).</li>
    <li> Should have just burned my feet if i wanted it to get more darker waste of my money i want my money back if i could rate it -0 stars i would</li>
    <li> i though this product was good until the liquid darkened the skin badly around the corns, would NEVER use this product ever again!  my feet look like they were in a fire now.</li>
    <li> Used religiously for corn. Didn&#x27;t deliver.</li>
    <li> I originally called a podiatrist for an oversized corn, but they wouldn&#x27;t see a first-time patient for that reason. So, I google&#x27;d and found this product. I based my purchase off of other Amazon.com reviews. Although the process was ugly looking, after a week there was a noticeable difference in size and then the corn could be removed completely.</li>
    <li> removed skin on corn but left dark mark on toe</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried dr. scholls corn remover consistently for more than 2 weeks and the corn was still there. It almost made me give up liquid removers completely but recently the corns on the ball of my foot reached a point where they started to hurt so I decided to try mosco version. Tbh I wasn&#x27;t very consistent about it and used it on and off for 2 weeks expecting it to have the same result as dr. scholls. but after 2 weeks, they peeled right off. it might also helped that I used cushions afterwards so that more pressure isn&#x27;t place on the corns.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for almost a week and so far so good. Not sure how long it takes for the corn to be removed but I see progress. However it made my toes look uglier than what they where. If I would have known i would have just left the corn alone and seen a doctor. My feet wasn&#x27;t that bad and now I&#x27;m ashamed of them.</li>
