      <li>and I love them.  </li>
      <li>We love them.</li>
      <li>I guess they&#x27;re okay.</li>
      <li>Most places I looked at had one for $5</li>
      <li>This is perfect for dance recital weekend when her hair needs to be in a bun the entire time.</li>
      <li>Better than a homemade rolled up sock as these grip the hair</li>
      <li>easy to use</li>
      <li>Easy to use and easy to take out.</li>
      <li>Easy to use</li>
      <li>My hair is a dark brown and blends over this perfectly.</li>
      <li>Do not buy this if you have fine hair.</li>
      <li>I have fine hair and it wouldn&#x27;t cover even the smallest bun.  </li>
      <li>I put my hair in a pony tail then put the donut over and pull the hair around to cover the donut, then secure it with another rubber band.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m happy with this product, whenever I don&#x27;t have enough time to do my hair</li>
      <li>Ok, i&#x27;m late to the party - but these are awesome!</li>
      <li>I use the large one mostly but have used all of them depending on what size</li>
      <li>I LOVE THE DIFFERENT SIZES, WORKS GREAT FOR DIFFERENT STYLES.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used them all in different styles and always get comments on how nice my hair looks.</li>
      <li>Makes nice, big buns!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m having a lot of fun playing around with these.</li>
      <li>She can make a very clean, professional looking bun with these.</li>
      <li>I had been using a rolled sock, but it just never felt right.</li>
      <li>that&#x27;s super straight) and use the buns for work.</li>
      <li>Love that they have different sizes too.</li>
      <li>We bought this set hoping one would be small enough, and it ended up being the perfect size.</li>
      <li>the large is not too large and the small still gives a good size bun</li>
      <li>These are such an easy cheat hair day tool.  </li>
      <li>They&#x27;re kind of too tight for my taste, but it does the job.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve bought some other buns in the past but these are the best!</li>
      <li>I won&#x27;t be using it, but for the price, can&#x27;t really complain about having two sizes that do work.</li>
      <li>With 3 sizes to choose from I was able to figure it out in minutes in my bathroom (i&#x27;m a medium) and threw the other two away.</li>
      <li>The big and medium sizes are great for medium-long hair, but I&#x27;m baffled how the small size could be used by anyone...</li>
      <li>These buns really help cut down my time in the mornings and my hair is up and super cute all day, even through my hour long gym workout and even if I decide to go out after work.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend for any dancer..or anyone looking to make nicer looking buns with their hair.</li>
      <li>It was pretty much what you see- no real complaints.</li>
      <li>It stays put all day and looks professional.</li>
      <li>I use the smallest one for my 3 year old and the biggest one for myself.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used all sizes, my hair is only past my shoulders, but the large one is HUGE and I can&#x27;t make it work well for me.</li>
      <li>Or, since the texture is rough, almost like velcro, it holds the hair enough to only use one light rubber band to hold the hair, so it&#x27;s not as tight, and no headaches.</li>

    <li> the large is not too large and the small still gives a good size bun</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very rough on the hair and could cause breakage.</li>
    <li> My daughter is at her dance studio 5 days per week, 3 times for ballet classes. She had been asking for &#x27;bun makers&#x27; for quite sometime. I found these at Amazon and took a chance. I wanted to help out the Easter Bunny. She loves them. She knows just how to use them , too. She can make a very clean, professional looking bun with these.She makes a ponytail, threads it through  bun holder, then wraps the excess hair around it  or braids it. It looks beautiful when she does it.  This is perfect for dance recital weekend when her hair needs to be in a bun the entire time. Great purchase. Highly recommend for any dancer..or anyone looking to make nicer looking buns with their hair.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this kit! I&#x27;ve bought some other buns in the past but these are the best! I have very thin hair (Asian hair that&#x27;s super straight) and use the buns for work. I&#x27;m out of bed and out the door (shower, makeup, walking the dog, etc) within 35 minutes. These buns really help cut down my time in the mornings and my hair is up and super cute all day, even through my hour long gym workout and even if I decide to go out after work. I use the large one mostly but have used all of them depending on what size I want my bun to be and if there are any fly-away pieces. Every lady should have a set of these!!</li>
    <li> Got this sooner than I expected. I&#x27;m having a lot of fun playing around with these. Most places I looked at had one for $5 and I got 3 for $10. Score!</li>
    <li> These are such an easy cheat hair day tool.  Love that they have different sizes too.</li>
    <li> Love these awesome bun makers! My hair is super thin and it&#x27;s hard to make a sock bun but this was the perfect fix! Easy to use and makes a beautiful bun!</li>
    <li> Love it! So easy to make a cute hair bun!</li>
    <li> I LOVE THE DIFFERENT SIZES, WORKS GREAT FOR DIFFERENT STYLES. THEY HAVE A FIRM RESILIANT TEXTURE SO THEY DO NOT SEEM TO SQUISH OR GO FLAT LIKE OTHERS I HAVE SEEN BEFORE.</li>
    <li> I guess they&#x27;re okay. They&#x27;re kind of too tight for my taste, but it does the job. I just can&#x27;t keep my hair up in a bun with these all day or else I get a headache.</li>
    <li> I use the smallest one for my 3 year old and the biggest one for myself. We love them.</li>
    <li> Makes an AWESOME bun for my competitive dancer!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m happy with this product, whenever I don&#x27;t have enough time to do my hair I use a donut bun and I looks awesome !</li>
    <li> My hair is a couple inches past my shoulders with some long layers. These did not work at all for me. I expected it would take some practice but it just wasn&#x27;t going to happen. I wouldn&#x27;t order this unless you have long hair that&#x27;s all the same length.</li>
    <li> Even the smallest bun was too big for me...  I have fine hair and it wouldn&#x27;t cover even the smallest bun.  Do not buy this if you have fine hair.</li>
    <li> Ok, i&#x27;m late to the party - but these are awesome! I&#x27;ve never tried a hair donut or sock bun before and this was a great buy. With 3 sizes to choose from I was able to figure it out in minutes in my bathroom (i&#x27;m a medium) and threw the other two away. I put it up in seconds, wears in my hair all day, and no one can tell its fake under my hair. Lifechanging! My hair is a dark brown and blends over this perfectly.</li>
    <li> I had a similar product for my little girl. her hair is very fine I was hoping to get a smaller size doughnut for her but when the set came their smallest size was the same as the one I already had. but I love to do hair and am happy with what I got and with an upcoming wedding in the family I may have a chance to use the larger doughnuts on someone else so I am still happy with the purchase. It was pretty much what you see- no real complaints.</li>
    <li> The smallest of the set was PERFECT size for my 4 year old. We bought this set hoping one would be small enough, and it ended up being the perfect size. Easy to use and easy to take out. My daughter&#x27;s hair is very fine, so this helped make it look like it had a lot of volume.</li>
    <li> These are larger than I thought they would be.  I usually end up using the smallest one because the others are so large and I don;t think my hair will wrap around them correctly.  Not sure if it listed the sizes or not, I was surprised when I received them.</li>
    <li> The big and medium sizes are great for medium-long hair, but I&#x27;m baffled how the small size could be used by anyone... I won&#x27;t be using it, but for the price, can&#x27;t really complain about having two sizes that do work.</li>
    <li> Love these! I have super-thin hair that slips around easily, so clips and bands are useless. To get these to stay in place, I use Acure dry shampoo on the ends of my hair, then roll it up in any size and it stays put.</li>
    <li> Perfect. The smallest size is perfect for my young dancer and the medium is great for me. Not sure if I will ever use the largest size, but someone with longer hair might.</li>
    <li> I had been using a rolled sock, but it just never felt right. I purchased these to keep my hair in an orderly bun and I love them! If I want it tight I put my hair in a pony tail then put the donut over and pull the hair around to cover the donut, then secure it with another rubber band. Or, since the texture is rough, almost like velcro, it holds the hair enough to only use one light rubber band to hold the hair, so it&#x27;s not as tight, and no headaches. I&#x27;ve used all sizes, my hair is only past my shoulders, but the large one is HUGE and I can&#x27;t make it work well for me. I&#x27;ve used them all in different styles and always get comments on how nice my hair looks. I hope they last a long time!</li>
    <li> easy to use and they do a good job</li>
    <li> I had just learned to make buns with these little bun makers when I bought these and I love them.  What a great item!</li>
    <li> Definitely helpful for making buns. They look well made but one started to fray after one or two uses. I haven&#x27;t (and may not ever) used the largest one. It&#x27;s really big.</li>
    <li> I wear the big bun for clinicals. It stays put all day and looks professional. Easy to use</li>
    <li> Wife is military and she uses these almost all the time for putting her hair up.  Better than a homemade rolled up sock as these grip the hair so it doesn&#x27;t move around and show the &amp;#34;sock&amp;#34; underneath during the day.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work for thin hair and not easy to use.</li>
    <li> Makes nice, big buns! It was perfect for my flight attendant costume hairstyle!</li>
    <li> just what we were looking for!</li>
    <li> I really liked these chignon bun sets, however, it took me a while to figure out how to use it. Once I figured out how to use it, it looked good.</li>
