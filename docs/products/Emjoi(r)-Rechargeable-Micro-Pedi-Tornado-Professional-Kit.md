    <li> I saw this on QVC and bought it on Amazon.  I am so glad I did.  It works great!  It does run through batteries, but a couple of double A&#x27;s are a lot cheaper than a pedicure.  And it&#x27;s so convenient.</li>
    <li> I have tried every thing on the market for my feet and nothing really worked ( I get muscle fatigue quickly).  But in the last two months I have taken my ugly, painful, bleeding, cracked and callus feet to clean and Baby Soft .  I can&#x27;t say enough about how well this has worked, and with so little effort.  This product has saved me from having to see a doctor for my feet.  I wish I could give it more stars. Thanks</li>
    <li> This product works like non other! It shaves off dead skin in a flash. Your heels feel smooth in seconds.</li>
    <li> I can now sit and watch TV and work on my feet at the same with no fuss or muss.  Anytime I urb my feet and find a rough spot, I just pull this out and correct it.  It also workd great on elbows.</li>
    <li> I had a battery operated one prior to this and there is no comparison!  This product is worth every penny.  I will never need to get a pedicure again, only if I want to be pampered.</li>
    <li> I love this foot-smoothing tool!  It is easy to use and I got immediate great results. I was so impressed that I bought additional ones for gifts.&lt;br /&gt;I believe I get better results with it than when I get a professional pedicure, and it is very gentle.</li>

    <li> I&#x27;m glad I purchase this item. I had seen the ad for the chemical peel.  The chemical peels are anywhere from $9.99 a pair or $19.99 a pair. So much waiting before you see results. No thanks!  This machine will last me a lifetime and I got immediate result the first time I use it. My feet have not looked and felt this good since I was a baby!  My feet and my husband feet look and feel better than when we use to go to neighborhood nail salon.  We was paying $30.00 each for the pedicures.  The technicians was using the razor blades.  Foot Doctor was using the scalpel.  Neither one was good for our feet.  This machine is very easy to use and there is not pain or risk in cutting yourself. If, you press to hard it stops until you release the pressure.  Very safe and healthy.  It is good for elbows and knees,as well.  This Emjoi Rechareabe Micro-Pedi Tornado is a must have.</li>
    <li> I bought one for my mom for Christmas and it does what it advertises.&lt;br /&gt;It makes taking care of callouses a breeze she even uses it on my Dad&#x27;s rough elbows.</li>
    <li> I love this product. I use it every night. My feet look and feel like they did when I left the salon after my pedicure. I love it!!!!</li>
    <li> This is the best pedi tool I have ever used! Really easy to use and effective in removing dry skin and calluses.</li>
    <li> Love this product.  Much easier and cheaper than going in for a pedi.  Be sure to keep plenty of batteries on hand.  They don&#x27;t last long.</li>
    <li> Did not do a thing for my feet the dead skin was not even remove what sooooooooooooooooo ever........ drop it like it was hot dump in trash</li>
    <li> I won&#x27;t have to pay for pedicures unless I want to! My feet tend to build calluses quickly - this tool works GREAT at removing them gently with no scrubbing. Love it and would recommend to anyone!</li>
    <li> As expected. Everything is fine.</li>
    <li> It works great! I love it and am happy I bought it. I highly recommend the Micro Pedi.</li>
    <li> This made my feet really smooth and soft. I would recommend this product to anyone who has some rough spots on their feet.</li>

    <li> I hav high arches (meaning faster callouses around the edges of my heels). So, for the last 30 years I have bought every callous &amp;#34;file&amp;#34;, from pricey to the ped egg.  Most did little and a few did a moderately good job. This is the first product that made fast and easy work of the callouses (not perfect, but far better than any other device or file that I have tried). I just hope the motor lasts!</li>
    <li> this works great but takes a long time, it&#x27;s like using a nail file on your foot and it is easier than manually filing so the end result is good but it just takes a long time.</li>
