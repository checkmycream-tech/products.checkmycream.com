      <li>Better if you find a stylist to apply it...</li>
      <li>Awesome product, definitely I will try it again.</li>
      <li>:)</li>
      <li>and they were great, but this is much cheaper</li>
      <li>One will work just to try, but 2 will have much better coverage.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I absolutely love the way my hair feels afterwards.</li>
      <li>I tried this product awhile back and was happy with the amazing results because the process was very easy and I thought to not have to leave product on my hair for 72-96 hours like most others want you to do was a breeze.  </li>
      <li>hair in warm water with shampoo Clean # 1 Kera-X System for up to 4 times.</li>
      <li>hair in warm water with shampoo Clean # 1 Kera-X System for up to 4 times.</li>
      <li>Made my hair shin ,healthy, and strong.</li>
      <li>Then I used a fine comb to make sure it was applied evenly.  </li>
      <li>For the price and how easy it was to do myself, I can’t complain.  </li>
      <li>Fumes are so strong that will make you cry</li>
      <li>The chemicals were so strong I couldn&#x27;t keep it on for 2 minutes.  </li>
      <li>Also instead of an application brush I just used a fine tooth comb to apply and spread the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>hair is now shiny, im able to blow dry it completely straight with no frizz and best of all...</li>
      <li>however with a little bit of heat, perfectly straight!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>And I used sulfate free shampoo</li>
      <li>I liked it so much i bought two for my mom.</li>
      <li>I have been using a Sulfate Free</li>
      <li>I’m very happy and anyone can do this themselves, therefore don’t waste your money going to the salon.  </li>
      <li>, Sodium Chloride Free Keratin Shampoo</li>
      <li>I have been using a Sulfate Free</li>
      <li>, Sodium Chloride Free Keratin Shampoo</li>
      <li>I have very wavy hair, a lot of frizz, and this is the ONLY keratin that works perfect...</li>
      <li>My advise: if you are applying it yourself, make sure you really work on the blow drying part and the iron, thats the key to a good result!</li>
      <li>Excellent product, same quality as the one I used to buy directly from Brazil.</li>
      <li>My hair isn&#x27;t as smooth as it was right after the treatment</li>
      <li>ml / 500 ml / 1Ly hair isn&#x27;t as smooth as it was right after the treatment</li>
      <li>&quot; So if you expect to have super bouncy volume hair</li>
      <li>But u can get a dry shampoo, spray it on &amp; ur good to go.</li>
      <li>My hair is straight and shiny when I want it then curls up easily after washing.</li>
      <li>and if i use enough mousee i have a nice relaxed curl look.</li>
      <li>Its soft, the color is more vibrate and its not frizzy one bit.  </li>
      <li>My hair was fine, and I believe it does the job, but I wont be buying this particular formula again.</li>
      <li>/&gt;UPDATE: 7/31/13 - I have now used this product for a month and it seems to be holding up pretty well.</li>
      <li>( you don&#x27;t have to do your whole head, that&#x27;s how stylists make money!).</li>
      <li>There were many complaints on the Agi Max products about the instructions not being in English.</li>
      <li>Follow the directions and if you have eye sensitivity make sure you are outside or in a ventilated area.</li>
      <li>First time to use keratin</li>
      <li>The process is a bit difficult so is best to use the help of another person.</li>
      <li>I will post updates as time goes by to verify the stamina of the product remaining consistent in the hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This is one of the best keratins I have used, the technique is so much easier, you don&#x27;t have to leave your hair dirty like for a week, with this one you one wash right away!</li>
      <li>I have only had this product in for 24 hours, still I am loving this system so far.</li>
      <li>I can just blow dry my hair and go which is something that I have NEVER been able to do.</li>
      <li>I can just blow dry my hair and go which is something that I have NEVER been able to do.</li>
      <li>I followed the directions and my hair was fantastic but for only 2 weeks.</li>
      <li>I recommend you spend your money on the real thing.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend it!</li>
      <li>This made it much easier to determine how much product to use on each section of the hair.</li>
      <li>Make sure all the hair is completely dry.&lt;br /&gt;Step 6:&lt;br /&gt;After brushed, divide the hair into four parts to start implementing the plank ceramic or porcelain, lock to lock.</li>

      <li>However, my hair came out soft straight and with NO FRIZZ!</li>
      <li>Agi Max wants to have the American market or markets in most countries, they need to send English instructions.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>The bottles kind of small though.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>As a hairdresser I was looking for something new that would give better results than the other products on the market.</li>
      <li>Said that, even tough it didn&#x27;t damage my hair, I couldn&#x27;t see a huge improvement either and results lasted for about 2 weeks at most.</li>
      <li>have tried other lower priced Keratin Treatments with mild success.</li>
      <li>I have been getting Keratins since 2010 and have spent thousands easily.</li>
      <li>but I notice that when I use the Brazilian Agi Max Hair Mask (which is no longer available, of course just my luck) that my hair is much softer and smoother than just other Keratin Conditioners.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> The chemicals were so strong I couldn&#x27;t keep it on for 2 minutes.  My hair feels like straw now.  I would not recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> This product does not work. I&#x27;ve had keratin straighteners done at the salon. This takes just as long without the results. I recommend you spend your money on the real thing.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s amazing ! My hair looks incredible and perfect ! Silky and it glows ! It was everything they said it would be !</li>
    <li> Excellent product, same quality as the one I used to buy directly from Brazil. Even included the gloves, will keep buying here every month or so.</li>
    <li> I love this product. I&#x27;ve been using it for about 7 years now. Anyone that said it doesn&#x27;t work, didn&#x27;t use it correctly. My hair is so soft and it lasts about 4 months if done correctly. It repaired my nephew&#x27;s hair that was burned. Great product!</li>
    <li> This product is great but the green one is AMAZING!!!!</li>
    <li> Used this product twice. Fumes are so strong that will make you cry so make sure to use a fan or a ventilated area. The process is a bit difficult so is best to use the help of another person. Said that, even tough it didn&#x27;t damage my hair, I couldn&#x27;t see a huge improvement either and results lasted for about 2 weeks at most.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m going to give this product another try with a new flat iron.  I used to get incredible results but recently was very disappointed.</li>
    <li> Horrible product! Just the smell of it will burn your eyes...</li>
    <li> Awesome product, definitely I will try it again. Agi max Brazilian meet all my expectation..</li>
    <li> After a lot of research, I decided to get the Agi Max Brazilian Keratin Kit and I can say that I am super happy with the results.  Although my hair is not straight (which I didn&#x27;t want and didn&#x27;t expect since you need to use the Japanese Hair Straightening Kit to obtain pin straight hair) my hair is relaxed and enriched with nutrients.  Its soft, the color is more vibrate and its not frizzy one bit.  For the price and how easy it was to do myself, I can’t complain.  The smell is strong but not as bad as others have stated, just make sure you have the windows open and a fan on.  Additionally, I watched countless Youtube videos and saw what the Brazilian hair dressers did.  I applied bottle number two as instructed but after applying it with the brush, used my hands to run it through to the ends.  Then I used a fine comb to make sure it was applied evenly.  I dried my hair with the product in with the blow dryer and then straightened it.  After ten minutes, I rinsed the product out and put bottle 3 (the conditioner) in and then because I don’t normally blow dry my hair in order to prevent damage, I let it just air dry and straightened it in the morning before work which took my approximately ten minutes as to the normally 45 minutes.  I’m very happy and anyone can do this themselves, therefore don’t waste your money going to the salon.  in.</li>
    <li> Not lasted long enough but smooth</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t bother with this product, unless you want to spend 1/2 a day on the computer translating the directions to how to use this product.Comes only with Spanish instructions.&lt;br /&gt;If Agi Max wants to have the American market or markets in most countries, they need to send English instructions.&lt;br /&gt;I am disappointed with Amazon for carrying a product without English directions.</li>
    <li> Well it did wonders for my hair but was too little product for the price. It was not enough for my whole head. I had to squeeze the last drop</li>
    <li> The best Keratin¡¡¡¡¡</li>
    <li> For starters, i am biracial (&amp;#34;half white and half black&amp;#34;). My hair is outrageously curly however the texture isnt coarse but rather a finer texture. My hair never makes nice curls, always a frizzy, thick mess.. and i usually love to straighten it because its easier to work with. The downside is having constant split ends and dry looking hair.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve gone to get keratin treatments professionally done 3 times. The whole $300 + 3 hour process, and not to mention the harsh fumes... is a pain but i usually was relieved with the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can positively say that i have wasted my time and money in the past going to professionals after seeing how amazing this product works.&lt;br /&gt;I am no hair stylist, just a 20 year old girl. The first thing that i (and seemingly may reviewers) noticed upon receiving this product was that the instructions are NOT in english. However following a youtube video for the product AND having the instructions written in simplified english by amazon in the product description (take a look!) made the process clear as day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did not want to mess up this product as i knew there would be some chemicals involved. Having a finer hair texture has prevented me from getting other types of relaxers/ perms in the past, my hair would fall out! I was nervous however took note that a majority of youtube videos showed people with finer hair textures using the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FOLLOW DIRECTIONS. Dry your hair completely when necessary etc. i did this process by myself with a mirror however the fumes are extreme and slight burn may occur when the product directly touches your scalp. Dont freak out and be in a well vented area! i waited out the hard parts and now have amazing results. I do suggest having a friend do the applying process (probably will make it 10x easier).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is now shiny, im able to blow dry it completely straight with no frizz and best of all...no flat iron needed! I used this product on december 25th 2014, it is february 5th 2015 and i can say the results are lasting! i DO have minor curl when my hair is wet and if i use enough mousee i have a nice relaxed curl look. however with a little bit of heat, perfectly straight!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very happy with this product. i have purchased again but the one without the strong chemicals (green bottle)</li>
    <li> Strong smell, but the hair at the end looks great! The bottles kind of small though.&lt;br /&gt;I like my hair now.</li>
    <li> I love it. Made my hair shin ,healthy, and strong. First time to use keratin and it will never be the last time.</li>
    <li> My wife was very pleased .</li>
    <li> I have been getting Keratins since 2010 and have spent thousands easily. The kit gives you enough product to retouch your roots ( you don&#x27;t have to do your whole head, that&#x27;s how stylists make money!). Be prepared to spend some time about four hours, to ensure great results. My hair is straight and shiny when I want it then curls up easily after washing. I liked it so much i bought two for my mom. Her curly hair was previously relaxed since she didn&#x27;t know what else to do. Since the treatment, it is like SiLK! Follow the directions and if you have eye sensitivity make sure you are outside or in a ventilated area. I will buy over and over.</li>
    <li> Hello I don&#x27;t like if Agi Max because it is very expensive and very small. I did not used yet. My long hair. What I do? Thank you. Marcia.</li>
    <li> Perfect; Recomended !!!</li>
    <li> The product is great. It is very expensive and also It needs to say the amount of formalin. Also it needs instructions in English</li>
    <li> This is one of the best keratins I have used, the technique is so much easier, you don&#x27;t have to leave your hair dirty like for a week, with this one you one wash right away!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m definitely not a complainer with beauty products.  A little discomfort is expected BUT this product was so toxic that it made my eyes water and my nostrils burn. I was kind of worried that it would be damaging to my lungs. I was determined to get through the treatment so I went outside to finish the application process.  My hair was fine, and I believe it does the job, but I wont be buying this particular formula again.</li>
    <li> Good, excellent product</li>
    <li> I followed the directions and my hair was fantastic but for only 2 weeks. And I used sulfate free shampoo and I did not swim at all. I wished that it would last minimum for 2 months. It is a waste of time and money.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing.  My hair is normally curly, although i am of European decent i would consider my hair curly like someone from Iran or south america.  This product loosens the curl giving it shine and manageability.  My hair usually takes 30 min to dry.  After the treatment it takes 10 min.  The treatment takes a couple of hours and i do this at home.  I absolutely love the way my hair feels afterwards.</li>
    <li> I have long, thick hair and next time I will need two of the No 2 bottle.  The fumes got pretty bad while putting the product on, but having the window open and all the fans going definitely helped.  Blow drying and using the flat iron produced very little fumes.  My hair is soft, pretty straight after just blow drying, and dries in a lot less time.  If you do have long, thick hair, for sure get 2.  One will work just to try, but 2 will have much better coverage.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had 2 blowouts done in the salon for $$$.$$ and they were great, but this is much cheaper and I have the same results, just sore arms.  :)</li>
    <li> I have very wavy hair, a lot of frizz, and this is the ONLY keratin that works perfect... Meaning after i wash my hair i dont even have to blow dry it or iron it, my hair will just stay straight all day no matter what and becomes very easy to style however you want! My advise: if you are applying it yourself, make sure you really work on the blow drying part and the iron, thats the key to a good result! Better if you find a stylist to apply it... The photo: blow dried only (right) and after whole treatment (left)... 1000000% recommended!!!</li>
    <li> best keratin treatment i&#x27;ve ever had</li>
    <li> I tried this product awhile back and was happy with the amazing results because the process was very easy and I thought to not have to leave product on my hair for 72-96 hours like most others want you to do was a breeze.  I have wavy curls that usually end up looking like Tina Turner wigs from the 80&#x27;s that is just frizzy and unmanageable and after I used this treatment on my hair I noticed my hair was extremely shiny, soft and my wavy curls were practically gone and drying and flat iron time that used to take 2 HOURS was practically reduced to 10-15 MINUTES!!!  The reduction in time alone was a miracle within itself but the true test was the humidity, sweating at the gym and getting my hair wet at the beach which was usually a nightmare was now eliminated!!!  I tried other products similar to this but I keep going back to this one because of the no waiting time to wash hair and the conditioner for this product eliminates that awful smell from the hair.</li>
    <li> As a hairdresser I was looking for something new that would give better results than the other products on the market. After reading some reviews I decided to buy it and I don&#x27;t regret it. This is what I was looking for and I will keep using until something better comes up. Highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> Product works well. But if u have really thin hair it will look really limp at the end of day. But u can get a dry shampoo, spray it on &amp; ur good to go. It doesn&#x27;t come with directions in English. But u can see the directions on amazon on the same page u bought it from. It has a step by step directions.</li>
    <li> There were many complaints on the Agi Max products about the instructions not being in English. This was not a big issue. I went to the website on the box, clicked on Produtos, Tratamento and Agi Max. I selected the Tratamento Kera-X System (Kit) and it gives you the manufacturer&#x27;s directions. I then copied the directions and pasted it in Google Translate (got to love the internet). Voila! English directions that weren&#x27;t very hard to get. The directions on the manufacturer&#x27;s website are almost exactly like the ones posted on the product description page of Amazon with a few slight differences. I pasted a copy of the manufacturer&#x27;s directions below so that you can judge for yourself. Also this product is an \\&quot;Intensive Nourishing Treatment Thermo which promotes the strengthening of the hair fiber, reducing intelligently and effectively the volume of the fibers.\\&quot; So if you expect to have super bouncy volume hair this is not the product for it. This product takes away waves, frizz and volume to straighten the hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;MY hair is EXTREMELY thick and almost down to my waist. My hair is also wavy and EXTREMELY frizzy. The tools I used were a tourmaline plate straightener cranked up to 450 degrees. I also used an IONIC blow dryer. Gloves and face masks are required with this product. Instead of a bowl I portioned out the Instant Restore bottle no 2 on a Dixie paper plate. This made it much easier to determine how much product to use on each section of the hair. Also instead of an application brush I just used a fine tooth comb to apply and spread the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried other lower priced Keratin Treatments with mild success. Other products make my hair softer and less tangled but I still had to blow dry and then straight iron my hair to get the waves out. Plus I still had some frizz.  I was hesitant to try this product because of the price but I had the extra cash so I gave it a whirl. Bottle 1 was simple, I mean it&#x27;s just shampoo your hair over and over until the bottle is gone. I had someone else apply bottle 2 for me (it was just easier this way). Make sure you use the face masks in a well-ventilated area because the fumes are bad. Also be careful getting this on your face because if you have sensitive skin like me it will burn a little. This is where the variation in directions comes in. Instead of immediately blow drying after the application of bottle 2 like the manufacturer states, I followed Amazon&#x27;s directions and let it sit for 20 minutes. After letting it sit I used my blow dryer and instead of trying to brush through my hair (because it was VERY difficult to do so), I just used my hands instead. Then I followed the Amazon directions and ran the flat iron at least 10 times over the hair (again face mask and well-ventilated area is a must). Then the last variation of directions was the temperature of water while rinsing bottle 2 out of the hair. I did follow the manufacturer&#x27;s directions on this one. Instead of room temperature like Amazon said I did it with cold water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like I stated before, I was really skeptical about this product because I have had mediocre results with less expensive versions of this product. In the end I have to say that I AM VERY IMPRESSED! When I bowed dried my hair the last time after bottle 3 with my fingers only I have to say that I didn&#x27;t think it was going to work. However, my hair came out soft straight and with NO FRIZZ! Granted I have only had this product in for 24 hours, still I am loving this system so far. As with other Keratin Treatments I am going to use Sulfate-Free, Sodium Chloride-Free Keratin shampoo and conditioner as is recommended. I just hope it lasts for a while because the process is tedious but hopefully well worth the effort. I will post updates as time goes by to verify the stamina of the product remaining consistent in the hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: 7/31/13 - I have now used this product for a month and it seems to be holding up pretty well. My hair isn&#x27;t as smooth as it was right after the treatment but I still have not had to use a flat iron at all. I can just blow dry my hair and go which is something that I have NEVER been able to do. Before I used this product I would have to blow dry my hair, which on average takes about 30 minutes. After blow drying my hair would be still be so poofy that I&#x27;d have to flat iron which would take an additional 60 minutes. No wonder I always just put my hair up! Now after treatment I can just blow dry it in about 15 minutes and go. I have been using a Sulfate Free, Sodium Chloride Free Keratin Shampoo but I notice that when I use the Brazilian Agi Max Hair Mask (which is no longer available, of course just my luck) that my hair is much softer and smoother than just other Keratin Conditioners. So far I am still impressed with this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Manufacturer&#x27;s Directions:&lt;br /&gt;Treatment Kera-X System (KIT)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This kit contains:&lt;br /&gt;Clean Shampoo No. 1, No. 2 Instant Restore and Finish Balm No. 3.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Action:&lt;br /&gt;Intensive Nourishing Treatment Thermo which promotes the strengthening of the hair fiber, reducing intelligently and effectively the volume of the fibers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Directions for use:&lt;br /&gt;Step 1:&lt;br /&gt;Wash hair in warm water with shampoo Clean # 1 Kera-X System for up to 4 times.
