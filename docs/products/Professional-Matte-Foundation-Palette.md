      <li>Great under light and on stage.</li>
      <li>The palette I purchased gave me a nice representation for the skin tones  I have been working on.</li>
      <li>This is by far the best matte foundation I have used to date.</li>
      <li>By far the best cream palette!</li>
      <li>Best professional make up, as I make up artist</li>
      <li>I very good but natural coverage.</li>
      <li>The seller sent the palette I purchased in time for a fashion event I ordered it for, and I was satisfied so I will purchase again thru them.</li>
      <li>I love this product.</li>
      <li>This foundation is full coverage and the range of colors allows you to mix to find your appropriate color that you need.</li>

      <li>and luckily we found it on amazon.  </li>
      <li>stays on nicely on the different skin types, and age ranges.under runway lights and photographers lights there was no melting.</li>
      <li>Definitely worth it for the size of each foundation, variety of color and amount of coverage.</li>
      <li>I used it on myself first</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d say that&#x27;s pretty reasonable.</li>
      <li>I can scoop out with a palette knife different tones from each removable button of foundation  and blend for the precise match to the client&#x27;s skin tone .</li>
      <li>I can contour really well with this pallette.</li>
      <li>I used with moisturizer and primers appropriate to models&#x27; skin concerns, and fixed with Laura Merceir translucent powder and urban decay makeup fixative so that may have helped as well.</li>
      <li>But then I used it on a client with normal skin and the product lasted all day.</li>
      <li>I recommend this to any professional makeup artist!</li>
      <li>but clearly I will get a lot of uses from it.</li>
      <li>I am a light skinned African American female and I tried to blend this palette to no end!</li>
      <li>Did not make one of the models with sensitive skin itch.</li>
      <li>Minimal creasing, I onlyI had to retouch smile lines after hours of model smiling for pics.</li>
      <li>Oh and I have dry to normal skin!</li>

    <li> Love this product! By far the best cream palette!</li>
    <li> I ordered this item a few months ago, they are not matte foundation and I decided to buy it because in the pictures there where shown it sais Kryolan and the result to be another brand, very disappointed, at the end not for the kind of product but for the lie.</li>
    <li> My daughter just became a certified makeup artist.  The foundation palette she received with her training was getting low.  She saw this one online and luckily we found it on amazon.  The product is amazing.  She tried it on herself and her face looked flawless.</li>
    <li> Best professional make up, as I make up artist I have always like to use the best!&lt;br /&gt;Gives I very good but natural coverage.</li>
    <li> My husband got me this palette as a surprise so of course I was excited to use it. I used it on myself first (i have an oily t-zone) it felt great! Very light weight! But by the end of the day around my nose and cheeks the product was gone. Used both primer and a setting spray. But then I used it on a client with normal skin and the product lasted all day. In all its a great foundation! :)</li>
    <li> This foundation is full coverage and the range of colors allows you to mix to find your appropriate color that you need.</li>
    <li> This is by far the best matte foundation I have used to date. And I can blend more than one color to match best with my skin tones. Love It!</li>

    <li> although I loved the texture of this product the colors did not work for me! I am a light skinned African American female and I tried to blend this palette to no end! It went on beautiful and felt like I had no makeup on but after a couple of hours it gave off a flat greyish cast....Not a good look....Anywho I tried adding a lil moisture to the mix to no avail...This may work for someone else but just not me..Oh and I have dry to normal skin!</li>

    <li> This palette is absolutely amazing! So easy to use and blend for the perfect shade. If you don&#x27;t have a spatula I would get one to mix it to prevent wasting product. I recommend this to any professional makeup artist!</li>
    <li> Great coverage and smooth application. Great shades to mix and match most skin color. Also great packaging. Don&#x27;t forget to prep your skin before applying.</li>
    <li> Warm tones, good for tropical countries like mine. The product is very fine, good cover without looking heavy on skin. Good for HD too.</li>
    <li> I love this product. It looks very natural but warning little goes a long way.</li>
