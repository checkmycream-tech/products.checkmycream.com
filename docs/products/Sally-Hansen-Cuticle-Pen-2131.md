      <li>Keeps nails strong and healthy.</li>
      <li>Ok, so let me first give you guys some background for an effective review.</li>
      <li>and it still works fine.</li>
      <li>It may sound like a lot</li>

      <li>but he just won&#x27;t take a bright pink stick with him.</li>
      <li>I love these cuticle pens but not when they&#x27;re old and rancid.</li>
      <li>I can honestly say that within 1 week I could see nail growth that I didn&#x27;t notice in the same length of time before adding the cuticle oil pen to my routine.</li>
      <li>I returned it right away.</li>
      <li>They make my cuticles so soft and smooth.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure that it improves the general condition of my nails, and it&#x27;s particularly convenient to carry around and use.  </li>
      <li>My nails naturally grow quickly, so I can&#x27;t atest to the quickness of the nail growth ingredient.</li>
      <li>And when I say my nails break or chip after a certain length, they do.</li>
      <li>She was really amazed.</li>
      <li>it goes fast so buy two at a time.</li>
      <li>but you wanna eat fast food every day.</li>
      <li>&amp;Modern.</li>
      <li>I was so excited to try this because of it&#x27;s simple application.</li>
      <li>Not only do you not apply enough to your nail, you can get a better coverage by using a cotton ball and some olive oil, but I have not seen a difference in my nails at all.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s convenient to take with you and use anywhere because it&#x27;s not messy and fast to use.</li>
      <li>so far NutraNail Naturals Nail Strengthener (which I bought as Whole Foods) works better, and I am seeing some improvement after a few weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:</li>
      <li>It takes only a few seconds to apply this and it keeps my cuticles nice</li>
      <li>After applying this twice daily my nails became strong and grew beautifully long.</li>
      <li>I like using this pen with soft bristles.</li>
      <li>I agree that it doesn&#x27;t last very long, but I think it&#x27;s worth it.  </li>
      <li>&lt;br /&gt;Works exactly like it should be not much to say about it!</li>
      <li>Just click the pen to release some of the liquid then brush it over your bare nail and cuticle and you&#x27;re done.</li>
      <li>As far as efficacy goes though - it does provide hangnail relief, but only temporarily.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Love these things.  They make my cuticles so soft and smooth.  Too bad they are getting so hard to find.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite cuticle treatment product out there. It makes my nails and cuticles look moisturized and healthy after use. It&#x27;s convenient to take with you and use anywhere because it&#x27;s not messy and fast to use. Just click the pen to release some of the liquid then brush it over your bare nail and cuticle and you&#x27;re done. It releases just enough liquid to wet the brush so it won&#x27;t drip all over the place. It dries in about 30 minutes, but I do things with my hands immediately following usage and it still works fine. My nails naturally grow quickly, so I can&#x27;t atest to the quickness of the nail growth ingredient. I&#x27;d recommend this product to anyone looking for nicer nails and cuticles.</li>
    <li> awesome very convinient...u can see results in even days.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this! The best for cuticles I have ever found.</li>
    <li> I bought this after seeing a recommendation on another site that tests these products. Not only do you not apply enough to your nail, you can get a better coverage by using a cotton ball and some olive oil, but I have not seen a difference in my nails at all.</li>
    <li> I agree that it doesn&#x27;t last very long, but I think it&#x27;s worth it.  I&#x27;m sure that it improves the general condition of my nails, and it&#x27;s particularly convenient to carry around and use.  I have seen improvement and a spurt in growth, and strengthening of my nails when I use it regularly.</li>
    <li> Yes just what I wanted, but I think they have discontinued this product.  I was happy to find 2 on line</li>
    <li> this item im not really sure about yet</li>
    <li> I have had at least 4 of these in the last few years. Great product for cuticles.</li>
    <li> I keep one at my office. I have to wash my hands a lot during the work day and my hands get dry. It takes only a few seconds to apply this and it keeps my cuticles nice</li>
    <li> I love these cuticle pens but not when they&#x27;re old and rancid.</li>
    <li> I like this cuticle oil pen. My cuticles look hydrated and healthy and don&#x27;t look so nasty and unkept up against my manicure. I try to use it after most hand washings and then follow with my hand cream all over my hands. I can honestly say that within 1 week I could see nail growth that I didn&#x27;t notice in the same length of time before adding the cuticle oil pen to my routine. It wasn&#x27;t crazy, WOW, this is a miracle product growth - but there was enough new length for me to be convinced that this product does measure up to it&#x27;s claims of helping with nail growth.</li>
    <li> I love this product. I keep one in the car and use it at stop lights. Keeps nails strong and healthy.</li>
    <li> Ok, so let me first give you guys some background for an effective review. I am a woman who goes to the nail salon every 2 - 3 weeks to get a Shellac (gel coated) manicure. As my nails grow, they tend to become easier to break. Therefore, I decided to try this pen to keep them from breaking and to grow my nails.  So I purchased this pen and used it after each time I washed my hands, daily. It may sound like a lot but it&#x27;s really not. For us women, we usually put lotion after each wash so just add this and rub it in as you are going back to work or whatever. I just wipe the solution along the cuticle and rub it in with my thumb. By the way this stuff smells good. After about 2 months of use, my nails were really long. And when I say my nails break or chip after a certain length, they do. But, not while using this pen. I have a friend I had known for over 15 years and when she saw my nails after the 2 months she said they were beautiful and asked if I had tips/acrylic. And I&#x27;m like no, I just take care of them every 2-3 weeks and use my cuticle pen by Sally Hansen. She was really amazed. She said to me that she had never seen my nails that long before. So for all those other reviewers who are having issues, you may have other nail issues like a lack of vitamins or minerals in your diet or something that wont allow the cuticle pen to do it&#x27;s job. Or, maybe you are just not taking care of you nails as well as use of the pen. It&#x27;s kinda like trying to lose weight by going to the gym but you wanna eat fast food every day. It ain&#x27;t gon&#x27; work! Toodles and happy cuticle pen shopping :)</li>
    <li> In terms of convenience, this cuticle pen is fantastic. Easy to use, easy to apply, easy to carry, and no mess. Full marks there. As far as efficacy goes though - it does provide hangnail relief, but only temporarily. And there&#x27;s just so little of it that using it repeatedly doesn&#x27;t make sense at this price.</li>
    <li> It soften the cuticles, but it is not able to push them back. I expected the side to be hard.</li>
    <li> This is a &amp;#34;pretty good&amp;#34; cuticle moisturizing pen.</li>
    <li> I love this for my cuticles, it really helps soften them.  I buy this all the time.  I highly recommend it. it goes fast so buy two at a time.</li>
    <li> Arrived before the estimated time. I love it. Stylish. Cute. &amp;Modern. All at a good price!!! Works perfectly!!!! Must have.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t come as a pen as advertised and that was the only reason I got it. I returned it right away. It comes packaged as a nail polish.</li>
    <li> Everything I wanted in a cuticle pen.. very practical and easy to bring everywhere. I like using this pen with soft bristles.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite cuticle product.  I am very disappointed that I can no longer find it in my local stores and will continue to order it on line as it is my first choice in nail care.</li>
    <li> Does not seem to stimulate growth, but it is a tidy way to deliver oil directly to your cuticles.  Clean application; easy to use.  It&#x27;s lasting well, and if it runs out, I will buy again.</li>
    <li> I have one for my hands and one for my toes.  It&#x27;s great.  Even my son uses it when he&#x27;s home.  If only it came in a different color, my son would use it when he was at the college dorm but he just won&#x27;t take a bright pink stick with him.</li>
    <li> I was so excited to try this because of it&#x27;s simple application. I used it for 3 days, morning and night, and my nails started getting weaker! I continued used and, still my nails peeled and chipped more than they have ever before. I don&#x27;t recommend this product. I am not affiliated with any nail products, but so far NutraNail Naturals Nail Strengthener (which I bought as Whole Foods) works better, and I am seeing some improvement after a few weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[[ASIN:B0073D1WJ0 Nutra Nail Nut Nail Nail Strength 0.5 oz]]</li>
    <li> Excellent product  I would buy it again, and recommend it to anyone looking for  especially for this price&lt;br /&gt;Works exactly like it should be not much to say about it!</li>
    <li> My nails are normally very weak and flakes before it has a chance to grow.  After applying this twice daily my nails became strong and grew beautifully long. My cuticles are kept neat and tidy. I love it.</li>
    <li> I love how the oil feels going on. You just twist one end and the little brush paints it onto the cuticle.  For good measure, I also rub it into the nail surface. I have no idea whether or not my cuticles are healthier or whether anything is growing faster, but it just feels like I&#x27;m doing something good for my hard-working nails. This pen&#x27;s almost empty so I&#x27;ll be getting another one soon.</li>
    <li> Love this cuticle pen. So easy to use and very handy.</li>
