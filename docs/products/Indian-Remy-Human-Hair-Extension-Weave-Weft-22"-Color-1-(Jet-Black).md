### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>(: amazing quality!!</li>
      <li>I have used hair extensions for many years and this is the best hair at the best price I ever have purchased.</li>
      <li>Good product, great price.</li>
      <li>What I liked,best was that the texture of the hair is very nice, smooth, and shiny.</li>
      <li>It was more like brown.</li>
      <li>It was more like 18 inches.</li>
      <li>The hair is okay</li>
      <li>Maybe if you were lengthening overall shorter hair two packs,would be good, if you wanted a very full look.</li>
      <li>These nice and smooth and super long :)</li>
      <li>Good quality-not as much as I expected in one package.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t think it was worth the money.</li>
      <li>It has a soft easy to menage texture.</li>
      <li>PEDI A PRODUCT REMY GOOD QUALITY OF 22 INCH COLOR BLACK</li>
      <li>Out of all of the 3 bundles purchased only 1 was ok</li>
      <li>I will be comming back for more extensions from here</li>
      <li>the product does not meet my expectations , what I get is not equal to the article published , although extensions are natural hair are nothing abundant , I do not think I have reached the product as chose</li>
      <li>Also the service provided by you was very favorable to me, thank you very much for your valuable attention.</li>
      <li>The quality and texture is great and it is slightly above average in quantity.</li>
      <li>good product, the only thing is that i ordered them black, i got red ones, i had to spend more to fix them .</li>
      <li>it didn&#x27;t come with much hair.</li>
      <li>much much cheaper then what youll find on other web sites plus since it a weft you can make your own sizes for clip in (what i use) and bound with some of your old hair and make it look thicker!</li>
      <li>For me, one pack was enough to get the desired thickness and body added to my own long hair.</li>
      <li>Definitely will buy more in the future!</li>
      <li>is enough for 3 layers, two for daily use and the other one for a good ponytail.</li>
      <li>I just received these early in the mail</li>
      <li>I ordered 22&#x27; and got like 12&#x27; because the hair completely thins out on the ends</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s soft.</li>
      <li>I was kind of disappointed the extensions were more like 18&#x27; long.</li>
      <li>I was bummed to spend on this one first off I ordered &amp;#34;jet black&amp;#34; and I recieved a dark brown.</li>
      <li>the product did not meet my expectivas , it seems natural hair and is not packaged properly, these products were purchased for sale, but now can not be sold because of its presentation</li>
      <li>First, I did not get black hair.</li>
      <li>the hair is soft and long but</li>

    <li> EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED WITH THIS PRODUCT</li>
    <li> I ordered this hair but I got the wrong color and it wasn&#x27;t Indian hair the hair is soft and long but Im not satisfied at all</li>
    <li> I have used hair extensions for many years and this is the best hair at the best price I ever have purchased. The quality and texture is great and it is slightly above average in quantity. You cannot beat this price! What I liked,best was that the texture of the hair is very nice, smooth, and shiny. Definitely will buy more in the future! For me, one pack was enough to get the desired thickness and body added to my own long hair. Maybe if you were lengthening overall shorter hair two packs,would be good, if you wanted a very full look.</li>
    <li> This hair is absolute crap! It falls out in clumps its very thin I ordered 22&#x27; and got like 12&#x27; because the hair completely thins out on the ends and I tried putting colour in them and nothing happened and I am a hair stylist so I know what I&#x27;m doing I would not recommend this hair!!!</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t expecting extremely high quality hair, but I was expecting at least what was stated in the product description- a weft that is 50 inches wide. &amp;#34;22&amp;#34; long weave - 50 inches wide - 114 grams of hair.&amp;#34; I measured and it turns out to be only about 27 inches wide. Otherwise, as stated by other customers, the hair is thin, but I expected that and that isn&#x27;t as big of a deal. It&#x27;s soft. It also isn&#x27;t the brand pictured, it comes in a plastic bag. I haven&#x27;t weighed it but it doesn&#x27;t feel like over 100 grams of hair.</li>
    <li> the product did not meet my expectivas , it seems natural hair and is not packaged properly, these products were purchased for sale, but now can not be sold because of its presentation</li>
    <li> I recommend this product. Also the service provided by you was very favorable to me, thank you very much for your valuable attention.</li>
    <li> Not as advertised. Out of all of the 3 bundles purchased only 1 was ok</li>
    <li> I was bummed to spend on this one first off I ordered &amp;#34;jet black&amp;#34; and I recieved a dark brown. Second Im suppose to be recieving indian remy hair it looks all blended with hair of red color almost. And it tangels awful! When washing it or even without washing it. I would not buy this ever again.</li>
    <li> I just received these early in the mail and I amazed with the quality!! These nice and smooth and super long :) much much cheaper then what youll find on other web sites plus since it a weft you can make your own sizes for clip in (what i use) and bound with some of your old hair and make it look thicker! But it comes a lot of hair and it&#x27;s thick! I will be comming back for more extensions from here (: amazing quality!!</li>
    <li> I was not happy with the product sent to me. First, I did not get black hair. It was more like brown. The length was 22 inches, but only a few strands were 22 inches. It was more like 18 inches. The hair is not human. It&#x27;s plastic!! The  weight says 114 grams, but I received 100 grams. This is NO INDY REMI! I would not recommend this product.</li>
    <li> The hair is okay I jus wish it wasn&#x27;t so thin</li>
    <li> Thank you my daughter was exited to receive her hair before her big day!!</li>

    <li> a lot of hair and really long. It has a soft easy to menage texture. is enough for 3 layers, two for daily use and the other one for a good ponytail. Good product, great price.</li>
    <li> I was kind of disappointed the extensions were more like 18&#x27; long. it didn&#x27;t come with much hair. But you get what you paid for. I don&#x27;t think it was worth the money.</li>
    <li> the product does not meet my expectations , what I get is not equal to the article published , although extensions are natural hair are nothing abundant , I do not think I have reached the product as chose</li>
    <li> Good quality-not as much as I expected in one package. Had to order another one. Haven&#x27;t actually attempted to style or put in yet.</li>
