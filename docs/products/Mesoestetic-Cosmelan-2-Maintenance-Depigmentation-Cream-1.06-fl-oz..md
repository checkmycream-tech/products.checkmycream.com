      <li>Amazing cream</li>
      <li>I have used Cosmelan 1 and Cosmelan 2 through my dermatologist and both products were extremely effective on my severe melasma.</li>
      <li>and I needed to adapt it to my own skin.  </li>
      <li>I exercise and eat fairly healthy.</li>
      <li>Make sure your Dr is using the newest addition and ask to see expiration date.  </li>
      <li>I love this stuff.</li>
      <li>Just like anything else we have to try many things till we find the cream that works for our type of skin.</li>
      <li>I always love this product to use...</li>
      <li>I really thought that my skin got better with this product!!</li>
      <li>Maybe it was too strong for my skin type.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s already made a huge difference in my skin...</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s still made a huge difference.</li>
      <li>the product it self is amazing and highly recommended but this one wasn&#x27;t original , i dont recommend buying it online</li>
      <li>It has a nice peeling effect that is working well on unclogging my pores and exfoliating old skin.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Few days into applying the cosmelan 2, I noticed a huge difference and to my biggest surprise it didn&#x27;t make as dry or as red as I experienced with the cosmelan I purchased from the doctor (a different strength in good way).</li>
      <li>I spend almost two thousands dollars, the results were worth it</li>
      <li>Did not seem as strong as it normally is</li>
      <li>don&#x27;t know how the other reviews are so good if they are using this product without the compound???  </li>
      <li>There is an original, older formula, a transition one (that does not work), and the newest one, which DOES WORK!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>my clients love the results with the regular formula.</li>
      <li>first tried another type of Cosmelan, I believe stronger than this at the doctor office.</li>
      <li>This actually caused more problems on my skin.</li>
      <li>MD gives you really fast results!</li>
      <li>; 135 LBS.&lt;br /&gt;I also have had many laser treatments that worked wonder and reduced my acne and scars, but every time I am outside in the sun for more than ten minutes, a sun scar develop and stay there till I treat it again!</li>
      <li>I originally purchased Cosmelan 2 directly from my Dermatologist.  </li>
      <li>Certainly didn&#x27;t for me.&lt;br</li>
      <li>It has worked very well for me</li>
      <li>I am very disapointed .</li>
      <li>, it&#x27;s really just exposing and bringing up all your build up.</li>
      <li>AND DAY COMPARED WITH THE REAL COSMELAN.  </li>
      <li>so much happier!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&#x27;</li>
      <li>I hope my experience help you decide which is better for your skin, just like other reviews helped me.</li>
      <li>If you have melasma make sure you try this first before you waste your money getting laser treatments.</li>
      <li>/&gt;I am 41 with long history of acne and problem skin, I have olive skin that gets light during the winter.</li>
      <li>I had the full treatment back in October 2013 and this purchase allows me to continue using as follow up treatments.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend.</li>
      <li>It gave me a new skin after burning the old one (literally).</li>
      <li>WHAT&#x27;S MISSING IN THE FINE PRINT!&lt;br /&gt;You will know if the product is compounded.  </li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t be surprised if you feel like it makes you break out in the beginning of use</li>
      <li>This Cosmelan is the real deal, but it can not be sold online with this compound- which is essential for it to work.  </li>
      <li>The product was a very different consistency, and seemed to work fast.  </li>
      <li>, I guess I have done so many chemical peels, and laser treatments  in the last few years that my skin no longer sensitive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I now have a clear skin thanks to this product as long as I keep</li>
      <li>: At home, easy to apply and use it as make up (if you like the natural look as I do)&lt;br /&gt;Pro: No more messy food at my bathroom, no more lemon wedges drying on my face and all kind of food like honey, etc</li>
      <li>used to have a very sensitive skin, I get red and itchy to every chemical products out there</li>
      <li>, I noticed the color is different, I first was reluctant to use it because the &#x27;after treatment&#x27; jar I got after the initial application at the doctor&#x27;s office made my skin very dry and flaky,</li>
      <li>This product really removed the dark spots on my face.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This did not work for me. It does make your skin peel however my areas of concern got darker. Maybe it was too strong for my skin type.</li>
    <li> I find this the best treatment that I have used for melasma.  It has worked very well for me but it took a bit of adjustment and I needed to adapt it to my own skin.  I recommend it.</li>
    <li> Absolutely perfect for my skin!</li>
    <li> This is NOT real Cosmelan.  This BURNS, HURTS, DOESN&#x27;T WHITEN, NOR DOES IT PEEL.&lt;br /&gt;NIGHT AND DAY COMPARED WITH THE REAL COSMELAN.  I BOUGHT THIS SOME 1 YEAR AGO, USED IT LIKE 3 DAYS&lt;br /&gt;AND ITS SITTING IN MY DRAWER. STAY AWAY!!</li>
    <li> The best melasma treatment!!</li>
    <li> Definitely worked for me. In a fews days it was noticeable.</li>
    <li> Amazing cream my clients love the results with the regular formula. MD gives you really fast results! Good Job . Mesoestetic USA !</li>
    <li> This product really removed the dark spots on my face. It&#x27;s expensive, but it pays off. I love this stuff.</li>
    <li> I have used Cosmelan 1 and Cosmelan 2 through my dermatologist and both products were extremely effective on my severe melasma. I purchased Cosmelan 2 on Amazon and it does not seem to be the same formula. In comparing it to the formula I bought through my doctor the effectiveness, color, texture and fragrance is not the same. I&#x27;ve been using Cosmelan 2 for over a year as maintenance and have had no issues. I have applied the product and left it on all day and there seems to be no effect whatsoever. I find this very disappointing as this has been the only treatment that has worked for me.</li>
    <li> This actually caused more problems on my skin. this was not for me. I will not repurchase this product again.</li>
    <li> I had the full treatment back in October 2013 and this purchase allows me to continue using as follow up treatments.</li>
    <li> Bought it for my grandma and she says it is one of the best ones out there. She didn&#x27;t complain about it so I guess it is working.</li>
    <li> I used the product for 3 weeks only and I already notice an improvement in my spot face. I think, soon I&#x27;ll be very pleased.</li>
    <li> Stats:&lt;br /&gt;I am 41 with long history of acne and problem skin, I have olive skin that gets light during the winter. I keep my hormones in check by taking maca, msm, vit C, and other vitamins. I exercise and eat fairly healthy. 5&#x27;7&amp;#34; 135 LBS.&lt;br /&gt;I also have had many laser treatments that worked wonder and reduced my acne and scars, but every time I am outside in the sun for more than ten minutes, a sun scar develop and stay there till I treat it again! I now have a clear skin thanks to this product as long as I keep using.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Con: This is not a cure for me (still looking for a cure for this nasty sun scars)&lt;br /&gt;Pro: At home, easy to apply and use it as make up (if you like the natural look as I do)&lt;br /&gt;Pro: No more messy food at my bathroom, no more lemon wedges drying on my face and all kind of food like honey, etc..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;History:&lt;br /&gt;I first tried another type of Cosmelan, I believe stronger than this at the doctor office. It gave me a new skin after burning the old one (literally). I spend almost two thousands dollars, the results were worth it but i had to stay hidden for one week after the initial doctor treatment. The results lasted for several months, and gradually as the summer came started to watch those noticeable dark sun spots on my cheeks and the sides of my face, I tried different home remedies that helped a little but needed a lot of work twice a day for over three weeks. Finally i got this rpduct, I noticed the color is different, I first was reluctant to use it because the &#x27;after treatment&#x27; jar I got after the initial application at the doctor&#x27;s office made my skin very dry and flaky, something I am not used because I always had normal to T zone oily skin, but worse, it made my skin red (sunburned)! But at that point I was fed up with the dark spots on my face and the occasional acne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Few days into applying the cosmelan 2, I noticed a huge difference and to my biggest surprise it didn&#x27;t make as dry or as red as I experienced with the cosmelan I purchased from the doctor (a different strength in good way). As I started following directions and applying it up to three times per day, I no longer had any type of itchiness, burning sensation or redness. It became my morning and night make up. I wash my face with black shea butter soap (yeap it is a soap unlike others that doesn&#x27;t dry the skin), put on cellfood oxygen gel following with the cosmelan 2 and the Aveeno positively radiant spf 30 moisturizer and that was the answer to my prayers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used to have a very sensitive skin, I get red and itchy to every chemical products out there, I guess I have done so many chemical peels, and laser treatments  in the last few years that my skin no longer sensitive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are experiencing redness and dryness, I recommend to use a very good moisturizer (aveeno is one of my fav, but Boby brown has good one too) Just like anything else we have to try many things till we find the cream that works for our type of skin. I hope my experience help you decide which is better for your skin, just like other reviews helped me.</li>
    <li> A product that actually works and works well, for melasma. Highly recommend. Hope it continues to be sold for a long time</li>
    <li> I originally purchased Cosmelan 2 directly from my Dermatologist.  The product was a very different consistency, and seemed to work fast.  When I ran out, I decided to save a few bucks and purchase on Amazon.  The new one is not nearly as effective?  Wondering if it is the same??</li>
    <li> mine experience was good!!!</li>
    <li> I always love this product to use...amazon.com is great.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very good! Excellent!</li>
    <li> Be informed before you spend your money on this product.  I did the Cosmelan peel 3 months ago and followed up with Cosmelan 2 cream for maintenance.  It worked like a dream and 85% of my pigment is gone after battling it for 10 years.  I needed to maintain results and continue using Cosmelan 2 cream.  I decided to order off Amazon to save money as this cream is very expensive...........&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; HOWEVER,  Cosmelan  2 should be compounded with .1% Retin A &amp; 6% Hydroquinone; which can only be done in a pharmacy with a DRs prescription.  This Cosmelan is the real deal, but it can not be sold online with this compound- which is essential for it to work.  THATS WHAT&#x27;S MISSING IN THE FINE PRINT!&lt;br /&gt;You will know if the product is compounded.  Here is what to look for:&lt;br /&gt;1) Prescription sticker on box with DRs name on it&lt;br /&gt;2) When you open the jar, there should be a separation of cream and liquid.  That is the compound that needs to be mixed together.&lt;br /&gt;3) After 2 or 3 days of use, your face will be slightly red.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know how the other reviews are so good if they are using this product without the compound???  Certainly didn&#x27;t for me.&lt;br /&gt;I am so passionate about the subject of melasma, as it has plagued my face for a decade.&lt;br /&gt;Do yourself a favor and pay the $225 from your DRs office for the Cosmelan 2 with .1% Retin A &amp; 6% Hydroquinone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* for those who are curious, I am caucasion (irish and Cherokee descent), Brown hair, blue eyes.  Slightly olive skin.&lt;br /&gt;* Also, Cosmelan has been through several FDA changes in the last several years.  Make sure your Dr is using the newest addition and ask to see expiration date.  There is an original, older formula, a transition one (that does not work), and the newest one, which DOES WORK!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good Luck!  Stop hating your skin and do the Peel and Cosmelan 2 compound!!!  Im so much happier!!!!&lt;br /&gt;&#x27;</li>
    <li> This cream irritated my skin to the point that I had to discontinue its use. Vendor wouldn&#x27;t take it back.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only been using this for a couple of weeks and it&#x27;s already made a huge difference in my skin...amazing stuff!! It&#x27;s lightened my melasma and it&#x27;s clearing my acne/scarring. It has a nice peeling effect that is working well on unclogging my pores and exfoliating old skin. Don&#x27;t be surprised if you feel like it makes you break out in the beginning of use, it&#x27;s really just exposing and bringing up all your build up. If you have melasma make sure you try this first before you waste your money getting laser treatments. Also, I only use it once a day and not even every day and it&#x27;s still made a huge difference.</li>
    <li> Did not seem as strong as it normally is and I have been using this product over a year.</li>
    <li> Perfect for the face skin treatment.  My mom uses it and works good.  stay away from the sun.&lt;br /&gt;she likes it.</li>
    <li> The item arrived correctly, but the expiration date will be in a short time. Just in 2 months !</li>
    <li> I really thought that my skin got better with this product!!</li>
    <li> everything was perfect!</li>
    <li> The pruduct is expired i had to send it back and spent $60 . I am very disapointed . Be carefful next time</li>
    <li> the product it self is amazing and highly recommended but this one wasn&#x27;t original , i dont recommend buying it online</li>
