      <li>Great Nootropic!!!...</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried every nootropic there is, and phenyl works best for me.  </li>
      <li>I find my ideal dose to be around 150mg.</li>
      <li>thats good!</li>
      <li>great product.</li>
      <li>This is a welcome addition to my anti-aging and cognition stack.</li>
      <li>I must address the side effects I experienced.</li>
      <li>Product works great.</li>
      <li>Happy to have this stuff to help me accomplish brainy functions.  </li>
      <li>but I do feel great</li>
      <li>Good customer service.</li>
      <li>There verion(white/offwhite) is still good.</li>
      <li>Keep u the good work liftmode.</li>
      <li>Liftmode still good quality phenyl.</li>
      <li>I love this stuff!  </li>
      <li>A bit pricey, but also vey effective.</li>
      <li>Or if you prefer to stack, this will add nicely to your preferred suite of &#x27;brain fuel&#x27;.</li>
      <li>Packaging is excellent, even the Certificate of Analysis is included, and shipping was fast.  </li>
      <li>Like piracetam, memory is enhanced and my verbal skills are more spontaneous.</li>
      <li>I am happier and have more energy....</li>
      <li>I enjoyed the effects piracetam</li>
      <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used it before working out and it increased my stamina and made me more mindful of my technique while lifting.</li>
      <li>I have more confidence.  </li>
      <li>This product made all the difference (and... yea I got the job).  :-)</li>
      <li>I can feel effects for sure.</li>
      <li>More information to clarify dosages might be helpful.</li>
      <li>but im glad I did.</li>
      <li>as someone relatively knowledgeable about nootropics and the like, liftmode is the best, cheapest phenylpiracetam supplier i&#x27;ve found on the market.</li>
      <li>It looks like I bought something very conspicuous, but it&#x27;s packaged great.</li>
      <li>Thus, many users of racetams have suggested taking racetams with an acetylcholine precursor like choline bitartrate.</li>
      <li>With 500mg-1g of choline bitartrate, I can consume this dose and experience outstanding nootropic effects and enjoyable stimulation with no side effects whatsoever.</li>
      <li>The main side effects I&#x27;ve encountered are those which I&#x27;ve also experienced with piracetam.</li>
      <li>piracetam (and now also phenylpiracetam) opened the floodgates in my mind to allow my thoughts to flow more easily.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve experienced the exact same side effects with phenylpiracetam and actually to a greater degree because of its remarkable potency.</li>
      <li>Some people react better to other nootropics, but if you&#x27;re one of the people that phenyl does work for, this is the best quality I&#x27;ve found.  </li>
      <li>I find that taking this several days per week has greatly improved my ability to get things done and process information much better than any ADD med I have ever taken and at a much better price.</li>
      <li>This Product is excellent and at least 100x more potent than sunifiram (IMHO)</li>
      <li>Liftmode is a fine company.</li>
      <li>I quickly feel motivated, focused, and confident.</li>
      <li>Great supplier; shipped quickly and professionally packaged.</li>
      <li>have noticed a huge increase in almost every aspect.</li>
      <li>While I enjoy being stimulated, I can appreciate the lack of stimulant-related side effects like anxiety and insomnia.</li>
      <li>The LifeMode Phenylpriacetam is a fantastic supplement.</li>
      <li>One of the primary reasons I wanted to try phenylpiracetam is that I had read that it&#x27;s rather stimulating.</li>
      <li>This stuff is really quite amazing.</li>
      <li>Phenylpiracetam is by far superior to piracetam for a number of reasons.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m able to work more rapidly while still producing high quality material.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Combined with the stimulant component, I find that my thoughts flow not only more easily but also more quickly.</li>
      <li>The beta-phenethylamine backbone of phenylpiracetam is probably responsible for the compound&#x27;s stimulating effects as many beta-phenethylamine derivatives (like amphetamine) elevate dopamine by interacting with its transporter.</li>
      <li>I can confirm that this is true.</li>
      <li>Love this product, super fast delivery.</li>
      <li>Shipping was quick.</li>
      <li>I know this is going to take my creative level to new</li>
      <li>The magic of phenylpiracetam lies in the way the mild to moderate stimulation adds to the strong nootropic effects.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>and I find that&#x27;s its a potent and powerful combination for an action packed work day.</li>
      <li>I found that this is not only an effective way to prevent the side effects of phenylpiracetam, but it also enhances the nootropic effects.</li>
      <li>I have nothing to compare the product to but it has been more than satisfactory and I see no obvious problems.</li>
      <li>you are interested in NOOTROPICS, you should get this one while you still can, because it works quite well</li>
      <li>Exactly as advertised.</li>
      <li>While phenylpiracetam isn&#x27;t a particularly potent stimulant, the stimulation is delivers is a key component to its cognitive-enhancing effects.</li>
      <li>I prefered the brown stuff they had in the beginning, but everyone says its not pure enough, even though the brown stuff was the best by far.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s been found that they enhance the activity of AMPA glutamate receptors as positive allosteric modulators (ampakines).</li>
      <li>This review is from: Phenylpiracetam (Carphedon) - 10 Grams (0.35 Oz) - 99% Pure - FBLM (Health and Beauty)&lt;br /&gt;If</li>
      <li>The effect feels somewhat global in that I feel like my entire mind is working better and that different parts of my brain are communicating more efficiently.</li>
      <li>and I didn&#x27;t like how much I had to take to achieve the desired effects.</li>
      <li>Above all, it delivers all of the desired nootropic effects of piracetam with a unique twist.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m going to order one of the other products that many reviewers say works in conjunction with this one.</li>
      <li>I had such a determined energy level that I made sure we edited the entire manuscript.</li>
      <li>It has a strong bitter taste (no surprise) when taken with water.</li>
      <li>First, it&#x27;s highly potent so an effective dose (100-200mg) can be placed in a capsule and any unpleasant tastes are completely avoided.</li>
      <li>But, to me, the stimulation delivered by phenylpiracetam is nowhere near the magnitude of an amphetamine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Piracetam itself pretty much completely lacks any stimulating effects.</li>
      <li>All of my cognitive were sharper-retention of information, processing new information, understanding relationships between concepts.  </li>
      <li>Very professional.  </li>
      <li>From what I understand, many of the other racetams also lack stimulating qualities although I have only ever tried piracetam and phenylpiracetam.</li>
      <li>Since I work a ten hour shift in a high call volume communication center and compete with coworkers who are a third of my age, I find this product most helpful.</li>
      <li>However, it&#x27;s been hypothesized that they may also increase the brain&#x27;s usage of acetylcholine (probably an indirect downstream effect) and that the adverse effects of large doses may be related to an increased demand for acetylcholine.</li>
      <li>The feeling is actually similar to adderall in terms of motivation and processing information except it&#x27;s much smoother.</li>
      <li>My brain is like alive with all kinds of activity.</li>
      <li>I was convinced I had a learning disability or even early dementia.  </li>
      <li>Wow, the reviews were not lying.</li>
      <li>So far they are two for two...</li>
      <li>Also I have found that this causes intense thinking- sort of like drinking ten cups of coffee</li>
      <li>As such, these compounds are more active in the central nervous system.</li>
      <li>After I increased the dose to 200mg the results were profound.  </li>
      <li>The quality is high, the company is solid, and I will buy this product again.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Again your milage will vary regards to racetams and choline in general.</li>
      <li>There is a general sharpness of thought and clarity of mind.</li>
      <li>To me, phenylpiracetam and choline bitartrate is essential combination in order to get the most out of this extraordinary material while avoiding any unpleasant side effects.</li>
      <li>At work I feel way less anxious to where I can speak my mind to people and not get taken advantage of my natural people pleasing personality and when I do have loads of work to accomplish, I don&#x27;t feel overwhelmed and I am able to prioritize and just knock things out one at a time.</li>
      <li>I also do not like the extra white stuff from new star, has no potency to it</li>
      <li>I recommend taking no more than 100mg in the morning along with your other favorite nootropic supplement.</li>
      <li>I started using this product, first at low dose as I am a smaller person with minimal benefit.  </li>
      <li>As I said before, phenylpiracetam has very few stimulant-like side effects although I&#x27;ve experience mild insomnia on occasions when I took it too close to bedtime.</li>
      <li>While the Chinese can be trusted to make plastic toys and phones and general walmart wares, I&#x27;m not so keen on ingesting their pharmaceuticals.  </li>
      <li>I have used several of the other supplements in this family of cognitive enhancers, and this one is really the only one you need.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> It is a powerful racetam and one may want to start with very small amounts every other day. Be careful stacking this. I will always have on my shelf .... Liftmode is a fine company.</li>
    <li> Wow, the reviews were not lying. This stuff is really quite amazing. I took a scoop in a bit of Blueberry juice when it arrived. About three hours later (5pm), I went to help my friend edit her manuscript. Let&#x27;s just say I was so focused that she was giving me the side-eye. It was like being on another level. I had such a determined energy level that I made sure we edited the entire manuscript. Finished a little after 1:23am.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was on fire and basically took over the entire project. My poor friend sort of sat there and only chimed in when I would ask her a question about her story. I am hooked. I know this is going to take my creative level to new heights.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: This is like my third day on this and I am ASTONISHED. I stayed up all night working on some business documents. It&#x27;s 12:20 in the afternoon and I&#x27;m still focused and working. My brain is like alive with all kinds of activity. It&#x27;s almost creepy. One thing I&#x27;ve noticed is that this makes me alert. I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s supposed to have that effect. I didn&#x27;t even drink my usual cup of coffee yesterday and I&#x27;m still going!!! I&#x27;m going to order one of the other products that many reviewers say works in conjunction with this one. I forgot the name but you can find it by reading the other reviews.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff!  At middle age, I changed my specialty in health care.  I was convinced I had a learning disability or even early dementia.  I was needing to read information 3 and 4 times before I understood what I was reading.  I knew my performance was much less than optimal and was worried that my contract would not be renewed.  I researched  memory enhancing supplement carefully (thank you reviewers!).  I started using this product, first at low dose as I am a smaller person with minimal benefit.  After I increased the dose to 200mg the results were profound.  All of my cognitive were sharper-retention of information, processing new information, understanding relationships between concepts.  Also my anxiety improved considerably.&lt;br /&gt;Yes, sleep is disturbed, but I am working on that.  Otherwise I have not had any side effects  I will stay on this long term.</li>
    <li> I stack Phenylpiracetam (300-400mg/day) with Jarrow CDP Choline (one capsule at 250mg/day) and LiftMode Picamilon (100-200mg/day) [All products can be purchased here on Amazon.]  I have a slight, but noticeable improvement in memory function, recall, and general cognition.  I use a prescription medication that has a common side effect, which makes you &amp;#34;search for words.&amp;#34;  This has improved as well. In all, cognitive enhancement compounds are not a panacea, but they have worked in my case.  The quality is high, the company is solid, and I will buy this product again.</li>
    <li> A bit pricey, but also vey effective. I have used several of the other supplements in this family of cognitive enhancers, and this one is really the only one you need. Or if you prefer to stack, this will add nicely to your preferred suite of &#x27;brain fuel&#x27;. Great supplier; shipped quickly and professionally packaged.</li>
    <li> I take one 90mg scoop (included) and it gives a little mental boost with no noticeable side effects.  I went to sleep within an hour of dosing - try that with Ritalin,  Adderol or any of the other prescription ADHD medication.  Happy to have this stuff to help me accomplish brainy functions.  Packaging is excellent, even the Certificate of Analysis is included, and shipping was fast.  Very professional.  The only reason it doesn&#x27;t get 5 stars is because it is made in China.  While the Chinese can be trusted to make plastic toys and phones and general walmart wares, I&#x27;m not so keen on ingesting their pharmaceuticals.  Quality control and accountability are not words associated with China.  In this case I may be wrong, and Liftmode does appear to be a professional outfit.</li>
    <li> I have experimented with several nootropics and appreciate their subtle improvement in my recall and typing speed. LiftMode&#x27;s phenylpiracetam is a level up from piracetam. Like piracetam, memory is enhanced and my verbal skills are more spontaneous. Phenylpiracetam adds a subtle feeling of energy and confidence that merges with memory, thinking, and verbal skills.  Since I work a ten hour shift in a high call volume communication center and compete with coworkers who are a third of my age, I find this product most helpful. This is a welcome addition to my anti-aging and cognition stack.</li>
    <li> Love this product, super fast delivery. I needed something to help me focus with a big job assessment coming up.  This product made all the difference (and... yea I got the job).  :-)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried every nootropic there is, and phenyl works best for me.  Some people react better to other nootropics, but if you&#x27;re one of the people that phenyl does work for, this is the best quality I&#x27;ve found.  Don&#x27;t forget to take your choline with it!</li>
    <li> Product works great. Exactly as advertised. Shipping was quick. Good customer service. Had to look up dosing on internet though - maybe include sheet with suggested dosing and how to take (with food, mix in drink, etc?) next time???</li>
    <li> Liftmode still good quality phenyl. Other suppliers are not consistant. There verion(white/offwhite) is still good. I prefered the brown stuff they had in the beginning, but everyone says its not pure enough, even though the brown stuff was the best by far. I also do not like the extra white stuff from new star, has no potency to it and I just got sent what I believe is corn starch from nootrabiolabs, it has a starchy taste not very water soluable and burns black instead of meltin. Keep u the good work liftmode. Tks, Billy Stacy</li>
    <li> The LifeMode Phenylpriacetam is a fantastic supplement. Purchase to occasionally stack with Oxiracetam and I find that&#x27;s its a potent and powerful combination for an action packed work day. Your milage may vary on racetams and this one is prone to tolerance buildup. The commonly recommended schedule is 3 days on and 1 week off to avoid tolerance. I recommend taking no more than 100mg in the morning along with your other favorite nootropic supplement. Examine (dot com) has dosing and advice for all of the racetam supplements. Personally, I stack it with Oxiracetam, Alpha GPC, CDP Choline, DMAE, Rhodiola Rosea and Arctic Cod Liver Oil in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Again your milage will vary regards to racetams and choline in general.</li>
    <li> This review is from: Phenylpiracetam (Carphedon) - 10 Grams (0.35 Oz) - 99% Pure - FBLM (Health and Beauty)&lt;br /&gt;If you are interested in NOOTROPICS, you should get this one while you still can, because it works quite well and the twits at Amazon seem to ban the racetams on a regular basis.</li>
    <li> great product. works as advertised. keeps individual alert for extended periods of time. as someone relatively knowledgeable about nootropics and the like, liftmode is the best, cheapest phenylpiracetam supplier i&#x27;ve found on the market.</li>
    <li> it don work for me as i espected i will no buy it again. don&#x27;t believe everything you read here.</li>
    <li> I received this item by mistake instead of PEA but im glad I did. This Product is excellent and at least 100x more potent than sunifiram (IMHO) I can feel effects for sure.</li>
    <li> I had been eagerly awaiting my chance to try phenylpiracetam after everything I&#x27;d read about it. I have relatively limited experience with the racetams. I enjoyed the effects piracetam but I hated the taste and I didn&#x27;t like how much I had to take to achieve the desired effects. Phenylpiracetam is by far superior to piracetam for a number of reasons. First, it&#x27;s highly potent so an effective dose (100-200mg) can be placed in a capsule and any unpleasant tastes are completely avoided. Above all, it delivers all of the desired nootropic effects of piracetam with a unique twist. One of the primary reasons I wanted to try phenylpiracetam is that I had read that it&#x27;s rather stimulating. I can confirm that this is true. Some online reports I had read compared the stimulation to Adderall but I feel that this is an exaggeration. Unlike caffeine, the stimulation from phenylpiracetam is definitely dopaminergic in character so I can see why some might make such a comparison. But, to me, the stimulation delivered by phenylpiracetam is nowhere near the magnitude of an amphetamine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Piracetam itself pretty much completely lacks any stimulating effects. From what I understand, many of the other racetams also lack stimulating qualities although I have only ever tried piracetam and phenylpiracetam. As expected, the addition of a hydrophobic phenyl group to a molecule increases it lipophilicity and ability to penetrate the blood-brain barrier. As such, these compounds are more active in the central nervous system. Prime examples of this are phenibut (beta-phenyl-GABA) and phenobarbital. Regarding phenylpiracetam, adding a phenyl group to the 4th carbon of piracetam results in the same effect of enhanced brain penetration but it also changes the pharmacology by imparting a beta-phenethylamine backbone to the molecule. The beta-phenethylamine backbone of phenylpiracetam is probably responsible for the compound&#x27;s stimulating effects as many beta-phenethylamine derivatives (like amphetamine) elevate dopamine by interacting with its transporter. While phenylpiracetam isn&#x27;t a particularly potent stimulant, the stimulation is delivers is a key component to its cognitive-enhancing effects. The magic of phenylpiracetam lies in the way the mild to moderate stimulation adds to the strong nootropic effects.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After taking phenylpiracetam, the stimulant and nootropic effects appear simultaneously. I quickly feel motivated, focused, and confident. For me, this is the extent of the stimulation elicited by phenylpiracetam. While I enjoy being stimulated, I can appreciate the lack of stimulant-related side effects like anxiety and insomnia. The nootropic effects of phenylpiracetam are virtually identical to piracetam but stronger. There is a general sharpness of thought and clarity of mind. I always felt like piracetam (and now also phenylpiracetam) opened the floodgates in my mind to allow my thoughts to flow more easily. I find that my analytic powers are enhanced and I&#x27;m able to make connections that would probably be difficult otherwise. The effect feels somewhat global in that I feel like my entire mind is working better and that different parts of my brain are communicating more efficiently. It also seems to enhance my memory and ability to learn. Combined with the stimulant component, I find that my thoughts flow not only more easily but also more quickly. I&#x27;m able to work more rapidly while still producing high quality material.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now I must address the side effects I experienced. As I said before, phenylpiracetam has very few stimulant-like side effects although I&#x27;ve experience mild insomnia on occasions when I took it too close to bedtime. The main side effects I&#x27;ve encountered are those which I&#x27;ve also experienced with piracetam. Large doses of piracetam often gave me a moderate headache and an unpleasant dazed feeling which counteracted the nootropic effects. I&#x27;ve experienced the exact same side effects with phenylpiracetam and actually to a greater degree because of its remarkable potency. With phenylpiracetam, I begin to notice these side effects when I exceed 100mg. Generally it starts with a headache but the dazed feeling becomes noticeable as I approach 200mg. The pharmacology of the racetams is thought to be complex. It&#x27;s been found that they enhance the activity of AMPA glutamate receptors as positive allosteric modulators (ampakines). However, it&#x27;s been hypothesized that they may also increase the brain&#x27;s usage of acetylcholine (probably an indirect downstream effect) and that the adverse effects of large doses may be related to an increased demand for acetylcholine. Thus, many users of racetams have suggested taking racetams with an acetylcholine precursor like choline bitartrate. I found that this is not only an effective way to prevent the side effects of phenylpiracetam, but it also enhances the nootropic effects. To me, phenylpiracetam and choline bitartrate is essential combination in order to get the most out of this extraordinary material while avoiding any unpleasant side effects. I find my ideal dose to be around 150mg. With 500mg-1g of choline bitartrate, I can consume this dose and experience outstanding nootropic effects and enjoyable stimulation with no side effects whatsoever.</li>
    <li> This review is after receiving two orders from LiftMode. So far they are two for two... I received both orders within a week of placing the order - thats good! The product was also to my satisfaction.</li>
    <li> I find that taking this several days per week has greatly improved my ability to get things done and process information much better than any ADD med I have ever taken and at a much better price.</li>
    <li> I was extremely skeptical about trying this.  I researched quite a few nootropics before buying this and I could not find a single negative review. When I opened it up and it was a tiny jar and little tiny scoops I didn&#x27;t know what to think.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let me start with it may be one of the worse things I&#x27;ve ever tasted, so chug a smoothie or something to wash it down. There&#x27;s two little scoops with a card telling which one for the mg you want. It looks like I bought something very conspicuous, but it&#x27;s packaged great. It kicks in faster and smoother than a cup of coffee and especially adderall. The feeling is actually similar to adderall in terms of motivation and processing information except it&#x27;s much smoother. There is a noticeable rush of energy without jitters or anxiety associated with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have noticed a huge increase in almost every aspect. After taking it I had to scrape ice and snow off my car. It increased my tolerance to cold almost to the point where I couldn&#x27;t even feel the coldness in my hands. At work I feel way less anxious to where I can speak my mind to people and not get taken advantage of my natural people pleasing personality and when I do have loads of work to accomplish, I don&#x27;t feel overwhelmed and I am able to prioritize and just knock things out one at a time. It also has some antidepressant effect to it. It doesn&#x27;t seem to be addicting but I do feel great overall.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used it before working out and it increased my stamina and made me more mindful of my technique while lifting. I feel like I can go on and on a out this product. It is perfect.</li>
    <li> Great Nootropic!!!...I have more confidence.  I can work out at the gym for longer.  I am happier and have more energy....I have tried a few companies with a similar Nootropic and this one feels like the purest of the Racetams.</li>
    <li> Title says it all; it shipped with-in an hour or two of ordering. I have nothing to compare the product to but it has been more than satisfactory and I see no obvious problems. Well recommended.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m using this as a way to avoid desensitization from the use of Galantamine for lucid dreaming, so I don&#x27;t at this point have a way for ascertaining if it works. It has a strong bitter taste (no surprise) when taken with water. More information to clarify dosages might be helpful. Also I have found that this causes intense thinking- sort of like drinking ten cups of coffee but without the nervous system causing shakiness. Rather than using the little scoops to measure dosage, I just use a teaspoon, taking about a quarter of a teaspoon at a time.</li>
