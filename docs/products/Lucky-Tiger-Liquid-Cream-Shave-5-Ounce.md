<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Shaving cream never did the trick with my thick beard and sensitive skin.  I tried them all but they always failed and I ended up with a 5 o&#x27;clock shadow by noon or my face was all torn up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lucky Tiger was given to me as a Father&#x27;s Day gift a few years back and it&#x27;s all I use now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It gets my beard soft and prepped perfectly for a good shave, keeps my skin protected and has a very light citrus aroma which is pleasing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve long been a fan of the luck tiger line of products, and this one met all o of my expectations. Easily one of the best shaving creamsi I&#x27;ve ever used, and the price can&#x27;t be beat!</li>
    <li> Not much of this product is required to enable a very smooth close shave. I like this much better than the usual aerosol shaving creams.</li>
    <li> Used it with my applicator brush. Lathers well. Very close shave. The razor feels like it glides better than the generic brand shaving creams.</li>
    <li> Use with a bowl and brush for AMAZING lather.</li>
    <li> i really enjoyed this product!! The only thing that I would ask is to for the liquid shave cream and aftershave to have the same smell as Lucky Tiger Hair Tonic. Short of that, I was very happy with my purchase and will continue to include it in my daily shave routine.</li>
    <li> Nice product.  A little on the liquid side, but with a little work it will provide a suitable foam.  Nothing very thick but it is effective.  The smell is a nice pleasant lemon or citrus smell.  I enjoy adding it to my shave cream rotation.</li>
    <li> I have tried other brushless creams and this one is tops. Wash your face and get the beard as hot as possible with hot water. Just a little cream in the palm and rub hands together to warm the cream and rub well into the beard. Keep the excess in one hand for a second pass. Excellent cushion and leaves the skin felling soft and smooth. If you are used to canned goo, then this will take some practice, but it&#x27;s worth the effort!</li>
    <li> A penny sized amount in the palm of my hand is enough for my brush to completely lather my face. An even soothing lather that beats any canned shaving cream and more pleasant than cakes of soap. Definitely will be reordering this.</li>
    <li> Update:  Ok I switched to double edge shaving, not in the shower, and like this stuff even better. I&#x27;m now using it with a brush in a mug. Lathers and moisturizers very well. Very small amount works fine. Great mild smell. Very convenient for travel. Still highly recommended.  Original: I have used this for several years. I typically use it without a brush in the shower. About 1/2 penny size is sufficient for a very close shave. Unlike aerosols, this actually lubricates your face. A brush is not necessary. The bottle seems small, but, if used sparingly, will last several months. You don&#x27;t need a lot. Also recommend the face tonic. Soothes dry skin with very mild scent. These folks make good stuff.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m no expert at shaving, hell I use disposable razors from Costco. This stuff works. It&#x27;s quick and easy and all natural with no propellants in it like other stuff. It only takes a dime size amount to generate enough to shave. I&#x27;ve tried other products similar, I&#x27;ve used pressure can stuff I&#x27;ve even tried the bar and cup method. This worlds as good as any. Can&#x27;t say it makes shaving enjoyable but I hate shaving. It has a fresh smell that&#x27;s not overwhelming and doesn&#x27;t linger. Give it a try.</li>
    <li> Hubby and 18 year old love this</li>
    <li> This is the best shaving cream ever. You&#x27;ll have less ingrown hair, and smoother skin. Hair seems to grow back finer. This cream is not just for guys--ladies, this will leave your legs smooth and shiny--you will not have to shave as often.</li>
    <li> This is a great shaving cream that has a pleasant scent that is not overwhelming.&lt;br /&gt;I have fairly sensitive skin and experience almost no razor burn, even shaving against the grain, using Lucky tiger. And the bottle will last a long time, you only need to use a pour the size of a nickle on you palm to get more than enough lather for a shave.</li>
    <li> Updating my original review a couples weeks in:  Firstly, I&#x27;ll say that the smell is growing on me each time I use it.  I can&#x27;t place the smell, exactly, but do find that I&#x27;m liking it more and more.  Secondly, I have had a lot more success getting a good lather with it than I did at first - I think starting with a slightly wetter brush and being a little more forceful/energetic when working the brush to build the lather really makes the difference.  At any rate, I can raise a nice, thick lather pretty quickly with my (synthetic) shave brush.  A small dollop will easily produce enough lather to coat my face 2-3 times, so i can do a couple of passes with lather.  Works great.</li>
    <li> I love this product. I was introduced to it by one of the boxes of the month clubs. I found it was cheaper here on Amazon. The scent is nice, the product isn&#x27;t too heavy, and I get a nice shave. Definitely a keeper.</li>
    <li> This Lucky Tiger leaves you that old familiar dry skin feeling afterwards. It smells good. Makes a medium thick lather and spreads well. It&#x27;s a good product but I&#x27;ll most likely try something else next time.</li>
    <li> I shave at least twice a week, face and head, and I&#x27;m always looking for a better shaving product. The lucky tiger is one of the best I&#x27;ve found. the small bottle size would lead you to believe that you&#x27;re not getting as good of a value, but its deceiving. It takes so little product to get a good lather that one bottle last me almost a year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just take a dime size bit of the shave cream, and rub onto a wet face. Wet being the key ingredient. It&#x27;s a little thick, but the water really makes it lather up. Its best used directly out of the shower. Also, if you&#x27;re shaving for a long period and the leather seems to go away, just water your hand a little and rub over the face/head, and it lathers back up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition to value it also works great. Pleasant smell, great lubrication for the blade, very rarely do i get razor burn when using Lucky Tiger.</li>
    <li> Got this as a sample in a Birchbox about a year ago. Replaced it as soon as it ran out. It&#x27;s my favorite shaving cream I&#x27;ve used.</li>
    <li> I started using this product when I was in Afghan, and didn&#x27;t generally have hot water.  When you&#x27;re stuck with cold water, this is a lot smoother and far better than anything else I&#x27;ve used. If you don&#x27;t have a brush, you can lather it on your face directly. Also, it&#x27;s much lighter and more compact than carrying a can of shaving cream. I still use if at home as well, and it leaves a smooth feel.</li>
    <li> Works better without a brush.</li>
    <li> first the superficial . i love the packaging. i like the way it looks on my sink.now to the more important. I get a very nice smooth shave much better than what comes out of a can. i wet my face spread a little soap and then apply lucky tiger i enjoy using a shaving brush to work up a nice lather and i get a very smooth shave.</li>
    <li> This is a simple review, I tried Lucky Tiger based on the other reviews I read, they were right. I love this shaving cream, it does not take alot to get a good workable lather and the result after the shave is excellent. I use this in combination with the Lucky Tiger Aftershave.</li>
    <li> Great citrus smell, doesn&#x27;t dry out too quickly, really close and smooth shave.  The best I&#x27;ve tried.  Cool retro label pictures don&#x27;t hurt anything either.</li>
    <li> I use with Conk brush.  About the best that I have used.  Gave some to friend to try and he also said it was the best he had used with a brush.</li>
    <li> Baby smooth shave with natural ingredients.</li>
    <li> I love this shave cream.  I just put some in my hand and rub it around a little.  Works for me.</li>
    <li> Great shaving cream, after many years trying different  shaving creams i tried Lucky Tiger and have never used anything else since</li>
    <li> Tried numerous cram shaves and I like this very much.  Product stays moist on your face, rinses easily and offers more than sufficient lubrication.  Scent is mild.  The old-style packaging is great!</li>
    <li> Best Shave Cream I&#x27;ve ever used!  I wish more stores carried this!  Leaves my skin extra soft and a provides a wonderful close shave.</li>
    <li> Works well and smells great - just what I had hoped for - So glad to see the &amp;#34;Lucky Tiger&amp;#34; brand again</li>
    <li> This is the first time I have tried Lucky Tiger shaving cream.  Aside from the small threaded cap, I love this product.  It lathers well, provides a smooth shave, and has a nice smell.  Will continue to include it in my shaving kit.</li>
    <li> My first impression was. Wow that doesn&#x27;t look like a very big bottle for the price.&lt;br /&gt;Then I readied my beard, squeezed a dime sized drop into the palm of my hand and began working it with my badger shaving brush. Within a few seconds, I had a handful of thick creamy lather more than sufficient for my initial shave and a second pass. If you try to rub this cream directly on your face, you will probably waste a lot of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I might actually get a years worth of shaves out of this little bottle.  In the long run, I think it might be cheaper than either aerosol creams or hockey puck shaving soaps. At least for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The soap smells nice, leaves my face feeling clean, and the label adds a certain air of nostalgia to my bathroom shelf.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this and will definitely buy it again.</li>
    <li> Lucky Tiger liquid shave cream is an decent shave cream. Has kind of a faint citrus smell. Lathers pretty well. Not my top choice for shaving cream but is defenitly better than some I&#x27;ve used. For the price I would recomend to try it out at least once.</li>
    <li> Great stuff. Keeps me front getting bumps or burn. Easy and quick to put on, but slick enough to deal with a double edged safety razor.</li>
    <li> This is the best shave cream ever. I&#x27;ve tried a bunch of others, but nothing compares. It takes just a little, but provides a really clean, close, smooth shave. I have it on auto order so that I never run out.</li>
    <li> Tough to find anywhere but on-line, except that I have found a barbershop or two that carries their products and that is where I first discovered this.  I have used many shave products in my life but none have been as good as this.  And when many lotion style shave products tell you to use about a dime size drop for your face, they usually require quite a bit more.  This product truly does work with just a minimal amount for the whole face.  So, in turn, this becomes quite a value.  A bottle tends to last me about a year&#x27;s worth of shaves!</li>
    <li> I received this as a gift. Love it! I agree with S. Stroup much better than the usual aerosol shaving creams. All for organic skin products.</li>
    <li> Nice smell and lather.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t get razor burn! This stuff is amazing, it lathers nice and thick with only a dime sized amount, and I had enough to do a three pass shave. I will buy again!</li>
    <li> It took me awhile, but I finally found myself loving this product.  It truly is awesome!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Important:  I wasn&#x27;t blown away by this product until I used it with my shaving brush and bowl.  Just a small amount and some water produced a rich and foamy, yet substantial lather that protected my face and gave me a smooth shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend using it with a shaving brush.  I started using it with just my hands and rubbing it on my skin but it doesn&#x27;t build up an effective lather that way and I found myself using more than I should.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another thing, love the smell and feel of the shave gel.  It doesn&#x27;t smell or feel chemically like the shaving foams/gels in the can.  And its faster and less messy than the shave soaps I use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this with a safety razor with no issues.  It&#x27;s awesome, take my word for it and order it, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.  Highly recommend using a shaving brush with it though.</li>
    <li> Just a great shave with this every time. Make the razor just glide over your face without nicks and cuts.</li>
    <li> I love the smell and feel of this shaving cream. Lots of orange and clove scents abound.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it in a super mix with Proraso for a really great shave. Plenty of tingle and a fascinating lingering scent.</li>
    <li> Works great, feels good on my skin.  Doesn&#x27;t foam up quite as vigorously as some other shave creams, but more than enough to do the job.  Recommended</li>
    <li> Shave cream is very smooth and lasts an extremely long time.  This sized bottle has lasted my husband a year and a half with a bristle brush. Well worth the cost.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband, but he didn&#x27;t care for it.</li>
    <li> My fiance used this at a friends and was obsessed immediately.  I have this on auto send because it&#x27;s the only thing he will use now.</li>
    <li> Lucky Tiger is a neat little brand, offering good value wet shaving products featuring a citrusy,  old-fashioned fragrance. I first received this shave cream as part of [[ASIN:B0015WH3MK the Lucky Tiger gift set]] -  I&#x27;m now stocking it in my medicine cabinet permanently.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s economical, too - I find only a quarter-sized squirt of cream shave gives me a full, rich lather for my entire face and neck. Very smooth and luxurious, it helps the blade glide across my face and lop off whiskers with no drag or discomfort. Probably has soothing agents in it to protect skin before and after the blade passes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;See my \\&quot;How to shave like a pro\\&quot; guide for more great products from Lucky Tiger and others.</li>
    <li> Only thing I use that works the best!</li>
    <li> Great product.  Got some for Xmas and really like it!!!!</li>
    <li> This shaving cream will make your face smooth and also make you have six pack abs. It is quite literally the best shaving cream ever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, you squeeze a bit out and it sorta reminds you of something on XXXtube, but lather up, wait 5 seconds, and then lather some more. It&#x27;s the second lather that causes the magic. Smooth as butter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will never use anything else on my face.</li>
    <li> This is a fabulous shave cream when used with a brush.  When I first used it, I followed the instructions (against my better judgement) and applied it with my hands.  Definitely didn&#x27;t get a great lather. I used a double edged Merkur safety razor, so I am used to getting a great shave every time.  Today I used my badger brush and whipped some of this up in a bowl with a little hot water and BOO YA- amazing.  This stuff smells awesome and it has a healing quality to it as you shave, almost like a lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely recommend this one for wet shavers.</li>
    <li> I read all the reviews and reviews from other sites and the product still exceeded my expectations. Lucky Tiger gave me the smoothest shaves ever compared to soaps and Proraso cream. It works best if you use a bowl and brush, but you can just apply it with your hands if you want. This product does not have a strong scent and dries down to a clean smell only.</li>
    <li> great smell, no need for a brush, much better than that stuff that comes in a aerosol can</li>
    <li> I have been using the Geo F. Trumper Almond Shave Cream. I wanted to try something different and new. So I gave the Lucky Tiger Liquid Cream a try. I have to say this stuff works pretty well in terms of cushion/slickness. It also smells great, if you like citrus. The scent is pretty light though, so you don&#x27;t have to worry about it, if you are going to wear after lotion/cologne. I will buy again! The price and performance is right compared to other high-end shave creams.</li>
    <li> This is a very smooth shave, using a silver tip badger brush, I can whip this into a killer lather in 6 seconds.  It provides a great shave.  The lather is not as thick as Speick or Tabac or other creams I have tried, but it provides a smooth shave and I can shave faster with the thinner lather.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is very light citrus, and when paired with the face tonic (Highly Recommend, especially for summer shaves) provides a pleasant scent that is not overpowering.  I work in a hospital and have to go light on scent for that reason, and I have yet to have a problem.  I have had the bottle for 8 months and have used 1/4 of it or less.  It lasts a long time when used with the brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good buy and great product.</li>
    <li> Agree with pretty much everyone else.  When used with a shave brush it works just as good as any product on the market, and you don&#x27;t need to use much of it.  If you use it brushless, as advertised, you need to use about three times as much product and don&#x27;t get as good a lather or shave.  Great American-made product though.</li>
    <li> I tried another shaving product since I ran out of Lucky Tiger.  I was not unhappy, just tried something different.  That was a less than satisfying experience and I am back with Lucky Tiger.  It is the best</li>
    <li> Nice, rich lather, wonderful aroma! I love Lucky Tiger!</li>
    <li> Gives a great lather and a very smooth shave....you will not be disappointed.</li>
    <li> If used with a shaving brush, this orange-scented liquid forms a thick and cushiony lather that is a delight to use. Follow with Lucky Tiger after shave or bay rum  and you are set for the day! Truly a nostalgic experience...</li>
    <li> Simple and effective. Subtle but nice smell. One bottle lasts long than I expected. My skin feels better after using for a couple of months.</li>
    <li> Been using this for 6 years - better than any chain store brands svailable</li>
    <li> I really don&#x27;t like shaving, but I love having a really smooth face.  So, if I have to do it, I spoil myself.  I shave with a Feather Stainless razor and Feather double edge stainless blades.  I use an extra large Kent silver tip badger brush.  I have a horn lather bowl and a pewter shaving mug.  I might as well be the Duke of Windsor.  Unfortunately, I am not.  The one thing missing in my routine was a satisfactory soap or cream.  I&#x27;ve tried many soaps and creams and few were even as good as Colonel Conk bay rum soap for $3.99.  Then I chanced on Lucky Tiger Liquid Cream Shave for 15 bucks.  Squirt out a bit into a bowl and whip it into a thick lather with a warm brush.  It gives a smooth, knick free (or as knick free as is possible) shave.  The blade just glides across the skin.  As an added bonus, the packaging is very 1930&#x27;s and your friends will think you&#x27;re cool when they use you bathroom.</li>
    <li> I have to say I love this stuff. I bought it from Amazon due to the great price after receiving a few samples from another company.  Although I was initially only intrigued enough to go ahead and purchase a couple of bottles I am now sold on this stuff!  The samples were tiny and I didn&#x27;t have a shaving brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This shaving cream lathers beautifully if you use an actual shaving brush (badger bristle, etc).  It smells really nice although not to strong but best of all it leaves my face looking and feeling years younger.  I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this shaving cream and am planning on trying out a few more of the &amp;#34;Lucky Tiger&amp;#34; products.</li>
    <li> Travel: You can transfer an ounce into a small bottle and it will easily be enough for a few months of shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Value: One bottle of this is all I need for a year of shaves.  If you want lather to the point that your face looks like a cappuccino, this is not the product for you.  If you just want a great shave, I would highly recommend.</li>
    <li> This cream shave whips up really nice after working it with a brush for a couple of minutes.  I would recommend to anyone.</li>
    <li> No kidding. This stuff is better than fancy soaps and a brush. It lathers nicely, Doesn&#x27;t have a girly smell to it and yet isn&#x27;t heavy with sandalwood or other perfumes.&lt;br /&gt;I like that:&lt;br /&gt;It has been around (probably unchanged) since 1935&lt;br /&gt;It lasts me about 2 months using it once per day&lt;br /&gt;It is made in the good old USA</li>
    <li> The scent is just ok but the quality is second to none.  I will most certainly buy again just because of the quality.  This bottle probably lasts 9 months or so....</li>
    <li> Great shaving cream, a little bit go&#x27;s a long ways and it&#x27;s good to match the sent with the aftershave lotion. I bit expensive for me.&lt;br /&gt;Four Stars.</li>
    <li> Best shaving creme I ever used. I am 75 years old</li>
    <li> I used this product 20+ years ago and found it to be the best shave product on the market. Lucky Tiger then discontinued it and I went with Probaso, or C.O. Bigelow. I discovered on Lucky Tigers website that they have put it back in production. Searching on Amazon led me to lower prices.&lt;br /&gt; A little dab will do ya if incorporated with a brush. It has a pleasant manly scent and leaves your skin as smooth as a baby&#x27;s butt.</li>
    <li> I typically use a brush and shaving puck but sometimes I just want a faster shave.  This is a great product that gives a very good shave and is fast to apply.  It comes out as a thin cream but instantly lathers up on your face.  It can actually get a bit stiff towards the end of the shave so it requires your razor to be very wet.  The scent is very pleasing but light... it disappears quickly.  Great product.</li>
    <li> Definitely one of the best shaving creams I&#x27;ve used. As others have posted, a little bit of the stuff goes a long way. Using a proper brush to lather it onto your face will get the most of the cream, but applying it directly with your hands works well too. I felt like it gave me a consistently good shave while I was using it - was sad to see the bottle run dry. Will likely be replacing it soon. The aftershave lotion is a great pair for this cream, too.</li>
    <li> Best shaving cream I have encountered.  Leaves my face smelling great and smooth. A little goes a long way which is a big change over drug store brands.</li>
    <li> ever since I decided to start shaving with a safety razor the biggest thing has been finding the perfect shave cream. This is it! I searched for awhile and finally got a sample of this stuff in one of my burchboxes. it smells wonderful and leaves your face smooth and moisturized. the glide you get from this product is on point and the lather is great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the seller is pretty awesome too. I&#x27;m currently working with the military in the middle east and I hadn&#x27;t received the item for awhile and I contacted the seller and without hesitation they resent out the order and I received it within 5 days. great service, great product.</li>
    <li> Have tried a lot of shave creams like many here.  Started with Taylor of Old Bond street like many and have tried at least 2 dozen various ones over the years.  At first, i was opposed to tried a liquid cream, but glad that i did.  found best when you work up a lather with a brush using a shave mug, then apply.</li>
    <li> its great so long as it stays wet, dries up too fast and adding water just dilutes it. Sorry but Neutragema (not spelled right) from Rite Aid is better.</li>
    <li> I started DE shaving over a year ago, and everyone recommended Proraso. My skin would always start bleeding and get irritated at the end of my shave-it was very frustrating, but I kept blaming my technique.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That all went away when I switched to this shaving cream from Lucky Tiger. No more irritation, no more knicks or bleeding. It helps me get a really close shave and is very easy to work into a lather. It doesn&#x27;t last quite as long as my Proraso did, but it&#x27;s well worth it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Be sure to use with a brush.</li>
    <li> Whom ever came up with the concept of applying this with bare hands, must have never used it. That said, a very small am amount in the bowl with a little hot water and ten seconds with a good banger brush and it makes a great lather. The result is a fantastically smooth shave. The smell is very faint and pleasant. My beard is rather tuff and my neck prone to razor burn but with this no issues at all. I will buy this again but so little is needed for each save, the reorder will not be any time soon.</li>
    <li> Lasts a long time for the amount you need to use to make a good lather.</li>
