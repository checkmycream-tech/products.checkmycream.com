      <li>I love this enhancing product.</li>
      <li>Love this product..</li>

      <li>so I can&#x27;t be too sure..</li>
      <li>( where most of us out line with eyeliner ), using a sweeping motion, go from the inside of the eye to the outside.&lt;br /&gt;So</li>
      <li>not so many eyelashes falling out.  </li>
      <li>Okay what this is designed for, is to increase growth and strength of the eye lashes.</li>
      <li>Asana claims that their serum provides a 400% greater result than &amp;#34;typical lash enhancers&amp;#34;.</li>
      <li>and I am glad that it did not cause me any irritation.</li>
      <li>these products do not do magic.</li>
      <li>Now she&#x27;s in love with it.</li>
      <li>After the first week they are also noticeable longer, I couldn&#x27;t be happier with the results!!!  </li>
      <li>love the the bottle is soooo huge.</li>
      <li>and I already see my lashes becoming longer and darker.</li>
      <li>Just started using this product, but its an easy application and has never irritated my eyes.  </li>
      <li>Directions are easy and application is a breeze.</li>
      <li>First of all, I received a promotional code to purchase this product, so I got an amazing deal.</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t experienced any irritation when using this product - which is a BIG plus in my book!</li>
      <li>I have used it for a few days and the applicator is the perfect size.</li>
      <li>: I received a sample for free in the hope that I would mention it on my blog.</li>
      <li>I loved that method because it was healthy and promised results within a short period of time.</li>
      <li>so I&#x27;m very pleased so far!</li>
      <li>It is super easy to apply.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Actually I have been using this serum every morning and night when my lashes are clean ( and I even barely wore mascara for it to be more effective).</li>
      <li>I was so excited to use it...</li>
      <li>I am so excited to receive this eyelash growth serum.</li>
      <li>Goes on smoothly and dries quickly.</li>
      <li>As a male, i have some thinner lashes and eye brows and this seems to make a good difference in the thickness.</li>
      <li>I use personally and believe will be good for others.</li>
      <li>Prior to that, I used Lilash (which I have to say was better than Latisse for sure).</li>
      <li>I have used this now for several weeks and you can see that my lashes are becoming more full.</li>
      <li>Have only used a couple times and already working its magic!</li>
      <li>It has a success rate of 96% for all who use this serum to gain thicker and stronger lashes.&lt;br</li>
      <li>but I would say it&#x27;s worth a try.</li>
      <li>i love it so far, cant wait to see the difference</li>
      <li>Works super fast!</li>
      <li>Also, I like this one because it has a super fine tip brush for precise application both on upper eyelashes and bottom eyelashes.</li>
      <li>However, it&#x27;s not always the most comfortable thing to put on, to wear for hours on end and to remove at the end of a long day.</li>
      <li>I have sensitive skin and this product has worked fine for me.</li>
      <li>This is seriously the most amazing product.</li>
      <li>The fine tip works amazing especially on the bottom eyelashes since mine are really short and delicate.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Most similar products have either 3ml or 5ml.</li>
      <li>Two thumbs up for this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received one or more of the products mentioned above for review purposes.</li>
      <li>I have been applying the serum 2x/day (if I remember, but always at least 1x/day), and I am happy to report that I feel I am seeing a change in my eyelash growth.</li>
      <li>was my first time trying ant type of serum, for my lashes.</li>
      <li>; They want you to be 100% satisfied with this product so they are offer a 6 month money back</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll give it more time &amp; see if it made a bigger difference.</li>
      <li>First, I am trans....</li>
      <li>Neither of them can claim that there has actually been any growth to their eye lashes, but they are 100% sure the eyelashes are much thicker and stronger</li>
      <li>Regardless, I only recommend products or services I tried personally and believe will be good for my readers.</li>
      <li>have medium to long eyelashes, I think this serum did help them to look more fuller- added volume.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I received my order fast</li>
      <li>Very dissappointed.</li>
      <li>Fast shipping.  </li>
      <li>I cant wear mascara really,  </li>
      <li>but they didn&#x27;t do much.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a FAN and highly recommend!</li>
      <li>but I haven&#x27;t noticed much difference as of yet.</li>
      <li>It took about 3 months to really see results with Lilash, and it looks like maybe it&#x27;s not being sold anymore.</li>
      <li>This serum is reasonably priced (around $27).</li>
      <li>really like this product</li>
      <li>use caution when putting on I accidentally put too much and it leaked into my eyes when I blinked.</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t really noticed much change it but will continue to use it.</li>
      <li>and I appreciate reading and giving honest feedback about products that regular people like me use on a daily basis or consider buying.</li>
      <li>I love how falsies look on me, like any other woman.</li>
      <li>I was really excited with the product and see a difference and waiting patiently for a larger growth.</li>
      <li>My eyelashes are short and nothing special..</li>
      <li>Within 2 weeks I had my full lid of eyelashes back.</li>
      <li>The serum is easy to remove much like any other tyep of makeup.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> my eyelashes seem thicker, hope it continues to work</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never used a product like this before, so I wasn&#x27;t sure what to expect. I thought I might have some irritation, but after a minute, you don&#x27;t even realize you put anything on.</li>
    <li> This is the BEST eyelash serum I have tried! and I have tried a lot. First, I am trans.... I love cosmetics and that is my passion since I am a stylist for the film industry. As a male, i have some thinner lashes and eye brows and this seems to make a good difference in the thickness. I am NOT sure if they are actually growing more but I have only used it for a week or so but I see great results that I like. Very happy with this. I also use it twice a day if that matters.</li>
    <li> Burns if it gets in your eye and greasy. I only use at night but really haven&#x27;t noticed a difference. It&#x27;s been about 2 months now</li>
    <li> Love works like a miracle!!!</li>
    <li> Okay what this is designed for, is to increase growth and strength of the eye lashes. It is not an over night fix. The serum is supposed to start showing progress after a couple of weeks use. It has a success rate of 96% for all who use this serum to gain thicker and stronger lashes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The girls have been using this for about a month now. It is super easy to apply. Directions: Simply apply nightly from the base of your lash-line or your eyebrow roots after cleaning and rinsing your face. Mascara use does not negatively impact the serum. The serum is easy to remove much like any other tyep of makeup. Neither of them can claim that there has actually been any growth to their eye lashes, but they are 100% sure the eyelashes are much thicker and stronger now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The girls are very happy with this serum and it will be added to their make up routine at night after taking all their make up off. They want to keep the fullness of their lashes and this is getting the job done for them. Not to mention that this comes with the &amp;#34;TOTAL ASANA GUARANTEE&amp;#34; They want you to be 100% satisfied with this product so they are offer a 6 month money back guarantee.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for a serum for your eyelashes or eyebrows to make them fuller, thicker, or even longer this serum is for sure a great buy. As I said it is not an over night fix but it has worked for both the girls so I do recommend this product if you struggle with weak eyelashes. I would like to thank Asana Beauty for sending me this product for the girls to try and leave an opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure of Material Connection: I received a sample for free in the hope that I would mention it on my blog. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I tried personally and believe will be good for my readers. No other form of compensation was received. I am disclosing this in accordance with the Federal Trade Commission’s 16 CFR, Part 255: “Guides Concerning the Use of Endorsements and Testimonials in Advertising.&amp;#34;nd Testimonials in Advertising.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Maybe i need to give it more time, but i&#x27;ve only noticed a slight difference in the length of my eyelashes. But it did make a difference, even though slight, they gained a lil bit of length. I&#x27;ll give it more time &amp; see if it made a bigger difference.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for a few weeks now and no noticeable result.</li>
    <li> I have applied this product as instructed for two weeks  now and it does not work. When this product gets in your eyes it burns and blurs your vision for several hours even after rinsing the eyes out thoroughly with water. Even when it doesn&#x27;t get in your eyes the vapors stung my eyes. I won&#x27;t be using this product anymore.</li>
    <li> works great. good product!</li>
    <li> First of all, I received a promotional code to purchase this product, so I got an amazing deal. I was not expecting the tube to be as large as it is, which is awesome! I have been applying the serum 2x/day (if I remember, but always at least 1x/day), and I am happy to report that I feel I am seeing a change in my eyelash growth. At first I thought it was just a mind game where I so wanted my lashes to be growing that I tricked myself into thinking they were longer.&lt;br /&gt;As I continue to use it, I am clearly seeing growth specifically on the lashes closest to my inner eye, near my nose. These lashes are typically short and hard to get mascara on, but they are growing now!&lt;br /&gt;After applying the serum, I do notice that my eyelid right above the lash line feels slightly cool, but it isn&#x27;t an unpleasant feeling. I haven&#x27;t noticed any other negatives.&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to use this product and will purchase again!</li>
    <li> This product doesn&#x27;t do anything!!  I am so disappointed.  I&#x27;ve used it for over 2 months now and nothing has changed with my eyelashes. They did however offer a refund to me.</li>
    <li> Been using this product for a couple of weeks. Saw an improvement in the length of my eyelashes wishing a couple of days. Works super fast! Would definitely buy it again.</li>
    <li> I bought this product 1 month ago and have used it twice a day and I have gotten NO results  what so ever. I am very disappointed in this product and hope no one buys it.</li>
    <li> Not seeing any results</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s fair for people to take people money and product does nothing it say !</li>
    <li> Doesnt smell or irritate my eyes. Goes on smoothly and dries quickly.</li>
    <li> Just started using this product, but its an easy application and has never irritated my eyes.  Will update with my results!</li>
    <li> This is from my blog!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll try almost anything to make my lashes longer. Before I tried this id put castor oil on my lashes twice a day. I loved that method because it was healthy and promised results within a short period of time. I had tried a few other serums in the past from Avon but they didn&#x27;t do much. I was pretty excited to try this because of my past experiences with Asana products. I&#x27;ve applied this day and night for almost a month and the results where staggering! My lashes where almost two times longer than before and while they weren&#x27;t as thick as I anticipated, they looked much fuller than before. It&#x27;s much less messy than castor oil and absorbs a lot quicker. Asana claims that their serum provides a 400% greater result than &amp;#34;typical lash enhancers&amp;#34;. I will say that it&#x27;s worked much better than any of my previous lash enhancers. It doesn&#x27;t exclude many ingredients, a few that stick out to me are Hyalouronic acid, biotin, vitamin E, and various variations of Glycerin. I love the bottle&#x27;s tight seal (that prevents spillage). I Honestly do not have almost any negative things to say about this. I wish the serum came in a small package with directions (just for the sake of people who are inexperienced). This serum is reasonably priced (around $27). Remember that your purchase is completely risk-free! All of Asana&#x27;s products have a 100% satisfaction guarantee.</li>
    <li> So far, it&#x27;s great! My eyelashes are short and nothing special.. It&#x27;s looking darker.. But I just started using it so I can&#x27;t be too sure..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m hopeful though! It hasn&#x27;t been itchy or anyway irritating so that&#x27;s good too!</li>
    <li> I was really excited with the product and see a difference and waiting patiently for a larger growth.</li>
    <li> Received this item on time and packaged well. I have used it for a few days and the applicator is the perfect size. It hasn&#x27;t irritated my eyes which I was afraid might happen so I&#x27;m very pleased so far!</li>
    <li> I have tried this for about a month.  I have been unable to notice any changes in my eyelashes.</li>
    <li> I already see a difference</li>
    <li> product unfortunately caused discomfort and irritation plus burning sensation when applied to lashes. I discontinued immediately and received my refund.</li>
    <li> I have used this now for several weeks and you can see that my lashes are becoming more full. This is the best eyelash serum or eyelash enhancer I have used so far. I have just applied it at night and in the morning but I worry that it&#x27;s coming off on my pillow case or something. But it seems to be working. I can recommend this eye lash enhancer and I will follow up on this after my daughter tries it for a couple of weeks.</li>
    <li> I have just been using it for a week now and I am glad that it did not cause me any irritation. I can see some changes already and I can&#x27;t wait to see the results after few months.</li>
    <li> 10 days after I started to apply that product, I have seen no change on my lashes. But, I have waited quite a time to make a fair comment.&lt;br /&gt;Actually I have been using this serum every morning and night when my lashes are clean ( and I even barely wore mascara for it to be more effective). But, unfortunately, my eyelashes did not even enhance 1 mm. I am sorry that it didn&#x27;t work. I was so excited to use it...</li>
    <li> I have only used this product a few times and have noticed that it has helped when removing makeup. not so many eyelashes falling out.  This product has no scent and did not irritate my eyes.  I was worried that it may burn but that was not the case.  I have very short eyelashes so I am anticipating the results.</li>
    <li> I suppose it is too soon to see drastic results but I haven&#x27;t noticed much difference as of yet. I will continue using to see if there has been any improvement. Thank you.</li>
    <li> It burned my eyes a little when I used it so I stopped using it</li>
    <li> I am so excited to receive this eyelash growth serum. I have very short eye lashes, and I either wear mascara or false eyelashes when I put my makeup on. Masacaras are annoying to take off especially those waterproof ones. False eyelashes can be too dramatic for everyday makeup looks. This is the ultimate solution to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This eyelash growth serum is truly amazing.  I have tried a few different brands that is available in the makrket already. None of them seems to help grow my natural lashes really. I have tried the Loreal eyelash growth serum and it was like a very thick and tacky gel that make my eyelashes really sticky. Also, I like this one because it has a super fine tip brush for precise application both on upper eyelashes and bottom eyelashes. The fine tip works amazing especially on the bottom eyelashes since mine are really short and delicate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tube has 7ml growth serum so you get the best value of your money. Most similar products have either 3ml or 5ml. This one will last quite a while and until you can see a big difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like this product and I received this product at a discount in exchange of a honest review.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for a few weeks and I already see my lashes becoming longer and darker.</li>
    <li> Im not sure if it doing anything.. I cant wear mascara really,  thought this would help.. Sometimes  it hurts my eyes.. Is that normal.</li>
    <li> This did not work for me at all.  I used it at night after washing my face, and again in the morning before applying my make-up.  After 3-4 weeks there was no difference at all.  Would not recommend this product.</li>
    <li> When I started using this product I had zero eyelashes on my upper left eyelid. I&#x27;ve tried everything since December of 2014. Within 2 weeks I had my full lid of eyelashes back. This is seriously the most amazing product.</li>
    <li> Love this product. I can see the difference with my lashes. Will buy again once I&#x27;m out.</li>
    <li> love the the bottle is soooo huge. I am still using it. I haven&#x27;t really noticed much change it but will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> To start, this serum does not have color. It  is a clear gel type formula. The directions state to apply the serum, directly to the upper lash&lt;br /&gt;line ( where most of us out line with eyeliner ), using a sweeping motion, go from the inside of the eye to the outside.&lt;br /&gt;So that answers two of the questions listed before the reviews.&lt;br /&gt;The product comes in a tube, just like a regular mascara would. It does contain 7ml of serum.&lt;br /&gt;As I opened the product I did notice it does have the faintest smell.&lt;br /&gt;It comes with a nice wand, with a brush tip for application. the brush tip is comparable to the size of most liquid eyeliner wands.&lt;br /&gt;This was my first time trying ant type of serum, for my lashes. I was of course worried about this item getting into my actual eyes!&lt;br /&gt;It I applied it according to the instructions, it did start to dry immediately. I also set in front of a fan just to help speed it along.&lt;br /&gt;I have medium to long eyelashes, I think this serum did help them to look more fuller- added volume.&lt;br /&gt;I received this item for review purposes, no compensation was involved. These are my photos and the statements above are my opinions.</li>
    <li> Lashes can make or break our makeup. It takes one&#x27;s makeup look from simple to extra fabulous! Needless to say beauty lovers, like yours truly, will love this product! I love how falsies look on me, like any other woman. However, it&#x27;s not always the most comfortable thing to put on, to wear for hours on end and to remove at the end of a long day. This product is a permanent approach to having dramatic lashes - and I love it! I haven&#x27;t experienced any irritation when using this product - which is a BIG plus in my book! Two thumbs up for this product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received one or more of the products mentioned above for review purposes. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I use personally and believe will be good for others. I refuse to review or endorse products that I have not or will not personally try. Needless to say, I may be a product reviewer but my thoughts are real and none of the things I say on my reviews are made up or fake - they are all based on my experience/s with whatever product I am reviewing. I’m just a regular consumer and I appreciate reading and giving honest feedback about products that regular people like me use on a daily basis or consider buying. My views and opinions are from a customer/end user’s standpoint.</li>
    <li> Love this product.. Have only used a couple times and already working its magic! No complaints here!!</li>
    <li> Really it&#x27;s too early to tell. So far I haven&#x27;t noticed anything. I&#x27;ll check back in a month and let you know.</li>
    <li> I received my order fast I really can&#x27;t tell yet not used it enough to tell yet</li>
    <li> I have been using this for the past three weeks with no results. Very disappointing.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping.  I was given this product at a very good price in exchange of a good review.  I&#x27;ve been using it for a week and I like it so far</li>
    <li> !I was very pleased with this product!  I noticed after using it for several days that my lashes looked fuller.  After the first week they are also noticeable longer, I couldn&#x27;t be happier with the results!!!  This is a wonderful product and would highly recommend the product to those who have skimpy lashes, you will not be dissapointed!</li>
    <li> I have been using this for 6 days now I apply it in the morning and let it dry before I put any make up on. I also tried it on my eyebrows on spots that have a hard time growing from frequent plucking. I can definitely notice a difference in them. I can&#x27;t wait to see after 30 days! use caution when putting on I accidentally put too much and it leaked into my eyes when I blinked. And it Burns! I have sensitive skin and this product has worked fine for me. No irritations whatsoever. I did a before and after pic.</li>
    <li> Seeing results already. Recommend it</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used a couple different &amp;#34;enhancers&amp;#34; before. Recently, I used Latisse (for an entire year) with very disappointing results. Prior to that, I used Lilash (which I have to say was better than Latisse for sure). It took about 3 months to really see results with Lilash, and it looks like maybe it&#x27;s not being sold anymore. I&#x27;ve been using Lash Enhance for about 3 weeks now and can already see results which is just mind-blowing to me. My lashes are longer and seem to be thicker. I use it on my brows which have been over-plucked and can see new growth in areas that never grew with Lilash or Latisse. I&#x27;m a FAN and highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I bought this product for my wife as present.  She used it and liked it because it works. She said thank you for buying me this product. Now she&#x27;s in love with it.</li>
    <li> Biggest waste of money! Didn&#x27;t do anything! Very dissappointed. Only gave a star because it&#x27;s required. It doesn&#x27;t deserve even half a star!!!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s been about 1 month and I am just now starting to see results.  My lashes are a little darker and seem to be growing but not as fast as expected.</li>
    <li> This product did help my lashes grow a little. They also appear darker which makes them stand out more. I started seeing results on the third week.</li>
    <li> Very nice product have been using this for quite some time now and I can actually see the difference.</li>
    <li> i love it so far, cant wait to see the difference</li>
    <li> Made my eyes burn and no results</li>
    <li> I love this enhancing product. Directions are easy and application is a breeze. I can&#x27;t say for certain if it has caused longer lengths just yet because I havent used it long enough but I would say it&#x27;s worth a try. I&#x27;m a fan of other products by Asana Beauty so I expect great results with continued use of this product.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff! I have noticed growth in my eyelashes over a one month period.. This Asana eyelash serum goes on clear and does not irritate my eyes. I would recommend this to a friend/family member.</li>
    <li> My daughter loved it within a week she noticed her lashes were getting thicker  and a little longer. I will definitely buying one for myself.</li>
    <li> these products do not do magic. I like them as long they do not cause irritation, this one does not cause burning or tearing. You have to use them for a long time to get the desired result. I see some density in the eye lash. I have not seen any longer eye lashes yet!</li>
    <li> Been using this for a few weeks now, and I can&#x27;t say that I am seeing any significant changes. Will continue to use until its all out, and update, if needed.</li>
