### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>excellent body spray cant get any longer in canada.</li>
      <li>a truly great product, i plan on ordering from then again!</li>
      <li>Awesome!</li>
      <li>Smells delicious!</li>
      <li>JUICED BERRY IS VERY PLEASANT AND NOT OFFENSIVE</li>
      <li>I love it!!</li>
      <li>It smells amazing!</li>
      <li>Through Amazon we were able to locate some, and our Granddaughters were  very happy Christmas morning.  </li>
      <li>This is the most wonderful smelling body spray I have ever had.</li>
      <li>Very pleased with the purchase and timely delivery.</li>
      <li>I gotta buy more when I run out!</li>
      <li>Always satisfied with Amazon!</li>
      <li>All time favorite scent!</li>
      <li>When you shake the bottle, you get a beautiful bursting top note of tart raspberries, with the sweet strawberry lingering pleasantly in the background.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Judging by what I&#x27;ve read online, this seems to be getting discontinued, but you can be sure I&#x27;ll hit up the Internet as soon as my bottle runs out!</li>
      <li>I decided I had to have a bottle of my own.</li>
      <li>this is literally one of the most amazing scents ever...</li>
      <li>Either way, if just sprayed right out of the bottle, you get a wonderful sweet strawberry smell (or raspberry if you go all the way to the top layer without ever shaking).</li>
      <li>I love this scent.</li>
      <li>My favorite scent.  </li>
      <li>More raspberry than strawberry, like the lotion, but still some strawberry in there.</li>
      <li>we will be buying more for sure</li>
      <li>but I thought I would give it a shot since I love raspberries.</li>
      <li>Most candy scented fragrances are over powering but this one is not and you get a wiff of it every time you move.</li>
      <li>She loves and I love it.</li>
      <li>Will definately buy more.</li>
      <li>I love this smell.</li>
      <li>Our Granddaughters love this fragrance.  </li>
      <li>Glad Amazon carries it; VS hasn&#x27;t carried it for years.  </li>
      <li>I would have bought more</li>
      <li>since i&#x27;ve been wearing it i have been getting so many compliments on it&#x27;s scent.</li>
      <li>I love love love this body spray...</li>
      <li>so I was glad to see it was available for purchase.</li>
      <li>I was taking a huge chance with this since I&#x27;ve never smelled it before or tryed it</li>
      <li>This scent is fabulous.</li>
      <li>I was so excited until I sprayed it.</li>
      <li>Thank you for getting it to me fast and easy.</li>
      <li>thanks for having it available</li>
      <li>I also have the body wash (which I rarely use) and the body lotion (which I ran out of and decided not to re-purchase).</li>
      <li>Decided to try it and really have enjoyed the soft fragrance.....</li>
      <li>The price was very reasonable as well.</li>
      <li>Thanks again!</li>
      <li>but I knew it wasn&#x27;t exactly like the one I had before.</li>
      <li>Exactly like the lotion.</li>
      <li>This most definitely falls into the fresh and real category.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>first borrowed a few sprays off a friend a couple summers ago and loved it so much</li>
      <li>Will most likely need to purchase again real soon.</li>
      <li>Lasts a super long time, well worth the money!</li>
      <li>I love this scent and it was becoming very hard to find it in the stores anymore</li>
      <li>Originally the perfumes contained two differently colored layers that you would shake up to smell both fragrances at once.</li>
      <li>It smells just like berries and lasts longer than most other body sprays I have tried.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m very picky with berry scents, as they can either smell fresh and real, or totally oversweet and synthetic.</li>
      <li>Great job with this one Victoria&#x27;s Secret!</li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re looking for a fresh, soft scent that LASTS, this is definitely it!</li>
      <li>also, the seller shipped it on time, and it even came early!</li>
      <li>i have no clue why victoria secret discontinued it, but it smells SO amazing</li>
      <li>This one has a soft lucious candy scent.</li>
      <li>I bought this product from Amazon after trying one directly from the VS store.</li>
      <li>They were all too harsh and the one that I did purchase...had a strawberry scent to it like Juiced Berry, but didn&#x27;t last nearly as long and definitely didn&#x27;t smell as good.</li>
      <li>I tried to find a new scent that smelled similar to the Juiced Berry and nothing even compared!</li>
      <li>It was so disappointing cause a co worker thought this was the perfume she had on, and she smelled like the most delectable sweetness, this definitely was not the right smell!</li>
      <li>I always get compliments on the scent - it&#x27;s not overbearing; subtle and sweet.</li>

<li> Nowadays it seems as though there are still two layers, but they are the same color, and the bottle only makes it look like the old formula due to the packaging.</li>
<li> It does smell the same, but it doesn&#x27;t last nearly as long.</li>
<li> It was not like the other one I had, similar scent</li>
<li> I first bought this years back at Victoria&#x27;s Secret and when I ran out a few months ago and went to buy it again, the store said it had been discontinued.</li>
<li> And it turns all pink</li>
<li> Only a few sprays and it lasts all day unlike other body spays that you have to spray a bunch of times throughout the day.</li>
<li> I purchased two different scents for my wife and I am not sure which one I prefer to smell.</li>
<li> This formulation isn&#x27;t the same, and so I&#x27;m not sure if VS changed their formulation before they discontinued this product, but I&#x27;m not a fan.</li>
<li> A little pricey.</li>
<li> Took a little bit</li>
<li> I can not fine it in the stores.</li>
<li> It is so hard to find now.</li>
<li> is so I can at least purchase it online!</li>
<li> it was not Victoria&#x27;s Secret</li>
<li> Been looking everywhere for this since Victoria secret stopped selling it.</li>
<li> This product smells like a badly kept nursing home</li>

    <li> Awesome! Always satisfied with Amazon!</li>
    <li> My daughter loves this .</li>
    <li> Decided to try it and really have enjoyed the soft fragrance.....daughter and I both are using it.  Will most likely need to purchase again real soon.</li>
    <li> This product smells like a badly kept nursing home it was not Victoria&#x27;s Secret</li>
    <li> I had juiced berry before &amp; I was looking everywhere but couldn&#x27;t find it. Amazon had it &amp; I was so excited until I sprayed it. It was not like the other one I had, similar scent but I knew it wasn&#x27;t exactly like the one I had before.</li>
    <li> I love this scent and it was becoming very hard to find it in the stores anymore so I was glad to see it was available for purchase.</li>
    <li> This scent is fabulous. I purchased two different scents for my wife and I am not sure which one I prefer to smell. This one has a soft lucious candy scent. Most candy scented fragrances are over powering but this one is not and you get a wiff of it every time you move. She loves and I love it. Will definately buy more.</li>
    <li> Is this the one you gotta shake ? And it turns all pink</li>
    <li> Our Granddaughters love this fragrance.  They both wanted some for Christmas.  We did not know that it was a discontinued fragrance.  Through Amazon we were able to locate some, and our Granddaughters were  very happy Christmas morning.  Thanks again!</li>
    <li> one of the only body sprays that doesn&#x27;t cause my asthma to act up, plus smells like berries and yummy!</li>
    <li> I bought this product from Amazon after trying one directly from the VS store. The one from VS had a sort of oil mixed in, and that made the product smell stronger and last longer. This formulation isn&#x27;t the same, and so I&#x27;m not sure if VS changed their formulation before they discontinued this product, but I&#x27;m not a fan. It does smell the same, but it doesn&#x27;t last nearly as long.</li>
    <li> This is the most wonderful smelling body spray I have ever had. It smells just like berries and lasts longer than most other body sprays I have tried.  The price was very reasonable as well.</li>
    <li> Been looking everywhere for this since Victoria secret stopped selling it. I love it!! Took a little bit but I finally found it!</li>
    <li> I love this smell. I can not fine it in the stores. A little pricey. I would have bought more but it was too pricey with shipping and handling if it was cheaper I would have bought another one.</li>
    <li> Very pleased with the purchase and timely delivery.</li>
    <li> I was taking a huge chance with this since I&#x27;ve never smelled it before or tryed it but I thought I would give it a shot since I love raspberries. It smells amazing! Exactly like the lotion. Only a few sprays and it lasts all day unlike other body spays that you have to spray a bunch of times throughout the day. More raspberry than strawberry, like the lotion, but still some strawberry in there. I gotta buy more when I run out!</li>
    <li> I love this scent. It is so hard to find now. Thank you for getting it to me fast and easy.</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re looking for a fresh, soft scent that LASTS, this is definitely it! I always get a ton of compliments whenever I wear this body spray (from men and women)...I also have the body wash (which I rarely use) and the body lotion (which I ran out of and decided not to re-purchase). I first bought this years back at Victoria&#x27;s Secret and when I ran out a few months ago and went to buy it again, the store said it had been discontinued. I tried to find a new scent that smelled similar to the Juiced Berry and nothing even compared! They were all too harsh and the one that I did purchase...had a strawberry scent to it like Juiced Berry, but didn&#x27;t last nearly as long and definitely didn&#x27;t smell as good. After all of that, I looked online, found it on Amazon, and bought 3 bottles of it! I love love love this body spray...nothing like it on the market and I do hope they&#x27;ll continue to make is so I can at least purchase it online! Great job with this one Victoria&#x27;s Secret!</li>
    <li> JUICED BERRY IS VERY PLEASANT AND NOT OFFENSIVE BUT IT DOES THE JOB. ALL MY GUEST ARE NOW BUYING IT. I WILL CONTINUE TO PURCHASE IT.</li>
    <li> Smells like it was intended for children! The smell literally chokes you. It was so disappointing cause a co worker thought this was the perfume she had on, and she smelled like the most delectable sweetness, this definitely was not the right smell!</li>
    <li> I would recommend to anyone! Smells delicious! All time favorite scent! Lasts a super long time, well worth the money!</li>
    <li> When I received it smelled like rubbing alcohol, like they had forgotten to add the scent to it - I returned it</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very picky with berry scents, as they can either smell fresh and real, or totally oversweet and synthetic. This most definitely falls into the fresh and real category.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I first borrowed a few sprays off a friend a couple summers ago and loved it so much I decided I had to have a bottle of my own. Time went by, and I totally forgot about it. Several months ago, however, I was in VS and saw this sitting on the shelf, with a sale going on no less!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over that time, I also forgot about the idea of combining the two layers by shaking. Originally the perfumes contained two differently colored layers that you would shake up to smell both fragrances at once. Nowadays it seems as though there are still two layers, but they are the same color, and the bottle only makes it look like the old formula due to the packaging. Either way, if just sprayed right out of the bottle, you get a wonderful sweet strawberry smell (or raspberry if you go all the way to the top layer without ever shaking). When you shake the bottle, you get a beautiful bursting top note of tart raspberries, with the sweet strawberry lingering pleasantly in the background.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Judging by what I&#x27;ve read online, this seems to be getting discontinued, but you can be sure I&#x27;ll hit up the Internet as soon as my bottle runs out!</li>
    <li> My favorite scent.  Glad Amazon carries it; VS hasn&#x27;t carried it for years.  I always get compliments on the scent - it&#x27;s not overbearing; subtle and sweet.</li>
