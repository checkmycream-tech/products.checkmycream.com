<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> This is the only way I can brush my hair. It doesn&#x27;t weight it down like the &amp;#34;It&#x27;s a 10&amp;#34; did, either. I have very fine, knotty hair. This is a life saver!</li>
    <li> This product is good but overpriced. I discovered Mane N Tail detangler for 1/4 the price which is a slightly better product.</li>
    <li> Love product It conditions and makes combing easier. Can&#x27;t believe how pricy it&#x27;s gotten in a year.</li>
    <li> I use it on my very curly hair..it detangles within 3 seconds really a lot fatser than it says,,,get it NOW!!</li>
    <li> My daughter&#x27;s long hair has been a nightmare to detangle. One visit to our hair salon and I watched the stylist brush through her hair in no time using 7 seconds. I was sold! Since then, the only reason she gets to keep her long hair is because of this product. It never feels greasy when dry and works like a charm.</li>
    <li> I really enjoyed using this product, it was great detangling my hair and providing moisture. This product was kind of pricey, but it lasted a few months and made my hair soft. I would recommend this product to anyone with tangled or dry hair.</li>
    <li> I am so happy I found this conditioner. It is the best stuff on the market and truely leave your hair detangled right away.</li>
    <li> Love this conditioner smells really good and helps hair be very soft when blowdrying.Its also cruelty free.</li>
    <li> Hmmm.  For some reason, this product has more than one listing on Amazon.  The review below is the same as one I just left on another page for the same thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this product for probably 4-5 years and just love it. Just a few spritzes after washing my hair and I can glide a comb right through it. Without this stuff, I get tangles and breakage. A bottle seems to last awhile too - you don&#x27;t really need to use very much.</li>
    <li> Effective and easy to use.  Have used Unite for several years and love it.!  Works quickly, leaves the hair feeling and looking natural.  Never greasy.  Manages the fly away hairs and frizzy look.</li>
    <li> Best product and shipped fast! Thank you so much!</li>
    <li> I have fine hair that gets greasy very easily.  I don&#x27;t like to use conditioner since it weighs my hair down and makes it oily, but I do need to use something to protect my hair from the blow dryer and straightening iron heat I subject it to on a daily basis.  This leave in spray is wonderful - I can easily comb through wet hair after a few sprays and feel a difference in my hair when I use it.  I recommend it to anyone looking for a light and effective leave in conditioner and detangler.</li>
    <li> This is the very best hair protector, shine enhancer, detangler ever.  I love this product and so does my hair - it looks super shiny and clean and the style holds for days.</li>
    <li> Leaves my hair looking very healthy,soft and shiny. Works amazingly on color treated hair. I put mine through the ringer, blow dry , flat iron, or curling iron everyday. This product makes it look like my hair never gets touched by a hot tool.  Worth every penny, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful product.  It makes brushing though my long color treated hair much easier after the shower.  It smells terrific, people always say I smell so good after I use it.  It leaves my hair soft and healthy looking and easier to manage.  I love it!</li>
    <li> I thought it couldn&#x27;t possibly be as good as the reviews said but I was pleasantly surprised.&lt;br /&gt;Believe the reviews, this is awesome!</li>
    <li> Both my daughter and my wife use this product and they can&#x27;t ever let it run out! It is very expensive but, #1 it&#x27;s worth it, #2 it lasts for a long time. Unite 7 Seconds Conditioner does not weigh down their fine thick hair and they can comb right through it after a shower. 7 Second Conditioner simply makes life a lot easier for tender headed people. You will not regret trying this product!</li>
    <li> Great product…..love it.  Recvd promptly.  Will purchase again.</li>
    <li> I swear by this stuff!  Being a blonde, it&#x27;s a must to have a great detangler that isn&#x27;t heavy on your hair.  For some reason they upsale the hell out of this product on here.  You can purchase this right from the makers on their site for $26 AND for the 8oz size!  Just a tip I just learned after coming on here to purchase....(my hair stylist used to have it at her place, but they had to stop carrying it due to a contract issue with the company, not sure what thats about)</li>
    <li> If someone ever told me that this will work in 7 seconds I would not believe it. My hairdresser gave me a sample so I tried. It works in 7 seconds!</li>
    <li> The best detanger I&#x27;ve ever used.  I refuse to comb through wet hair without this stuff!</li>
    <li> I really love this leave-in conditioner. I have thick curly hair. This product makes my hair soft and smooth!</li>
    <li> My hair is pretty damaged from bleach and coloring- this really changes everything. My stylist recommended it to be especially because I end up going a long time between cuts. Really helps keep down the breakage.</li>
    <li> Great product. Smoothes tangles without weighing hair down or leaving a residue. Hair is silky, soft, and healthy looking PLUS it contains protein.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing but I can&#x27;t believe it has doubled in price since the last time I ordered.</li>
    <li> The greatest conditioner/detangler. Ever. Far exceeded my expectations. Leaves my hair feeling soft and silky. My hair looks healthy and beautiful. Love it!</li>
    <li> Our daughter has coarse tangly thick hair, but this stuff makes it so so much easier to comb out.  Thank you Santa!</li>
    <li> Great product just too darn expensive for my budget.</li>
    <li> I really love this leave in conditioner. I have very cores and dry hair, and this smooth&#x27;s and conditions perfectly. The only thing I don&#x27;t like is that it is so expensive. The first time I bought this product online the price was very good, then the next time I searched for it, the price had doubled. I won&#x27;t be buying this as much.</li>
    <li> Love it, Love it, Love it!!  Leaves my hair soft and manageable and no overpowering scents, just lovely - people hug me and say, &amp;#34;Your hair smells soooooooo good&amp;#34;:)!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use to buy it at a Beauty Salon near home but they no longer carry it, so my niece, who is a Salon hairdresser said to go on Amazon to find it as they have everything?  I did and so glad I did:)!! The only shock I got is that it cost twice as much through Amazon than when I purchased (for years) at the Beauty Salon?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still Happy I found it though!</li>
    <li> I have really thick, curly, &amp; course hair &amp; I don&#x27;t know how I ever brushed it without this stuff.</li>
    <li> Amazing leave-in.  Got a sample at my hair dresser&#x27;s and I was hooked.  I was in the hospital for 1 week in bed rest and no shower privileges.  My hair was in knots when I was about to shower.  I sprayed this on my hair and it detangled my head full of knots with minimal effort.  Wonderful product!  It&#x27;s worth every penny! It also makes yor hair smell amazing!</li>
    <li> A little goes a long way.  My hairdresser uses this on my hair and it is magic.</li>
    <li> I cannot live without this, my hair just doesn&#x27;t detangle well without it! I&#x27;m not sure how I made before this product! Just kidding, but seriously it&#x27;s an awesome leavin detangling conditioner. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> This is one of the best leave in detanglers that I&#x27;ve used. I originally purchased it at a spa (which is now closed) and on amazon once I ran out. The smell is my favorite -- fresh and clean. I love to spray this on my hair before bed or going out.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been full on bleaching my hair for 3+ years with minimal damage thanks to 7 seconds! Highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> love love love, i have color treated hair that i subject to curling iron on a daily basis!  My hair is nice and soft !</li>
    <li> This is expensive but worth the money. The smell is wonderful and it only takes a couple of squirts for entire hair.</li>
    <li> This is the only detangler I have tried that works for my hair. I love the smell too.</li>
    <li> I was introduced to this product by my stylist and I loved the way it made my hair smell and feel.  When i loved out of the area I had to rely on the samples she had given me. When the samples ran out I was thrilled to find it on Amazon. Love this product!!</li>
    <li> First time this product was used was at a salon by my stylist.  Made my hair silky smooth!  Kinda expensive, but definitely worth it.  It brings out the shine in your hair you never knew you had!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! Great purchase, super fast shipping and great price. Thank you!</li>
    <li> Followed  the instruccions and i got an awesome,shiny, smooth hair, specially after my hair is dry, love it, goodbye to tears when i style my hair</li>
    <li> I love this conditioner!  I have long fine hair and this takes the tangles out without weighing it down or making it feel &amp;#34;goopy&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;I spray the middle to the ends of my towel dried hair (not on my roots or the skin because I need all the volume I can get there).  Wait literally 7 seconds or more then comb through and blow dry. Love it!  I am 47 and my hair is down to almost the middle of my back but it is fine so conditioning is critical for me.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a big fan of Unite products in general. This leave-on conditioner detangles and smooths without feeling oily or sticky. I use it daily on my fine, mostly straight hair before blowdrying.</li>
    <li> This is the product that made me want to try the whole Unite line!  Usually my hair is too thin and fine to use a leave in conditioner.  7 Seconds Conditioner/Detangler is amazing.  Hair looks healthier and shiny but not greasy:0</li>
    <li> I think I got a knock off, smells good but doesn&#x27;t add up to the hype. Won&#x27;t buy again.</li>
    <li> You will love this spray. Just a few spritzes and the kids are in heaven when you brush their hair after bath.</li>
    <li> Seller shipped this item on time, item was as advertised.</li>
    <li> great seller. The product is as described. will order again. Thank you!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for over a year and I  love it.  Does a great job as a detangler and leave in conditioner.</li>
    <li> I was purchasing UNITE products from my salon for my thinning hair.  Going online to order what I generally use has saved quite a tidy sum.  It&#x27;s a great product and getting it at a better price is a bonus!</li>
