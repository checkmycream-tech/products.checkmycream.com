      <li>This product is great</li>
      <li>it doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin at all and since using it my skin looks great.  </li>

      <li>I love this moisterizer!  </li>
      <li>I am so glad I did!</li>
      <li>P.S. I also use this moisturizer under and around my eyes, they love it!</li>
      <li>don&#x27;t feel this is as moisturizing as the all over ultra repair, but it&#x27;s nice.</li>
      <li>Have purchased this product from a store before and really liked it.</li>
      <li>It is very moisturizing, excellent product...</li>
      <li>Is a good product but does make my face breakout more.</li>
      <li>it seems and this is by far the best</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried many brands including philosophy, murad, clinique, neutrogena, aveeno, etc.</li>
      <li>My skin was flawless and all of a sudden</li>
      <li>I love this product</li>
      <li>Love it..</li>
      <li>and I love this as well.  </li>
      <li>Thought this one for face (and pricier) should be even better.</li>
      <li>Obviously it goes great with the FAB cleansers!</li>
      <li>Surprisingly, this product irritated my skin, making my face hot and itchy.</li>
      <li>Best moisturizer I&#x27;ve ever found for dry winter skin.</li>
      <li>Love this project and the seller was so quick!</li>
      <li>I couldn&#x27;t believe that it was so light, yet so potent.</li>
      <li>This product improved my skin from the very first application and has left it nearly flawless after a week&#x27;s use.  </li>
      <li>This one has so strong  chemical smell.</li>
      <li>I decided to try this after becoming a huge fan of [[ASIN:</li>
      <li>I sought an answer and first bought this at Sephora, but found it cheaper on Amazon :)</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m 63 years old with skin that is getting more and more wrinkles and is drying out.  </li>
      <li>so if your skin is &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; sensitive or even normal, this would be a great product for you.</li>
      <li>Every moisturizer I&#x27;ve used makes me look super shiny, almost immediately.</li>
      <li>I love that mask so much that it is one of the regulars in my rotation, despite being pretty promiscuous when it comes to beauty products.  </li>
      <li>It also leaves my skin perfectly hydrated all day long and is easy to layer under my primer, foundation and other makeup.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m on my 3rd bottle of this moisturizer and still loving it.</li>
      <li>After I had children, I found my skin to be a lot more sensitive.</li>
      <li>Once I started using this lotion I rarely have a blemish.</li>
      <li>Lightweight and easily absorbed.</li>
      <li>It goes on smooth, dries quickly, and makes my face feel super soft (and not oily).</li>
      <li>Even if I use it right before bed, it doesn&#x27;t stain my pillowcase.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s taken me years to discover the right products for my skin.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s amazingly lightweight and sinks into skin immediately - it almost has a gel-like texture rather than cream.</li>
      <li>I would recommend trying a sample in person first (at a store like Sephora).</li>
      <li>I have very sensitive and dry skin, and I need very good moisturizer, especially living in a place as arid as Colorado.</li>
      <li>Great product for daily use, but is not an intensive moisturizer for very dry skin.</li>
      <li>I do think I will want something slightly more hydrating come the middle of winter when the air is dry and my skin is more prone to irritation, but for the rest of the year this is perfect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>the caveat here is that I have SUPER sensitive skin</li>
      <li>After using my other face lotion for years, I switched to First Aid Ultra Beauty face lotion for something more moisturizing.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend!</li>
      <li>It really almost no scent to it which I like.</li>
      <li>I had been using [[ASIN:B000UO3GGQ Ole Henriksen Sheer Transformation Age Defence, 1.7 Fluid Ounce]] and had been pretty happy, but given my past positive experiences with First Aid Beauty I was curious to try more products from the brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I have been using this for awhile as my main Moisturizer for my face..</li>
      <li>I have very sensitive skin and could never find a moisturizer that didn&#x27;t break me out - until now!</li>
      <li>Would highly recommend.</li>
      <li>But great for dry winter air it doesn&#x27;t take much and us kinda thick.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t even use one full pump, but just do a sort-of half pump to get the right amount out.</li>
      <li>I have sensitive skin and it works very well.</li>
      <li>, it&#x27;s light, absorbs easily and doesn&#x27;t have any irritating ingredients.</li>
      <li>After two weeks of quitting this lotion, my skin is finally going back to normal BUT it will take months for a full recovery.</li>
      <li>B0083S44LM First Aid Beauty Ultra Repair Instant Oatmeal Mask-2 oz.]].  </li>
      <li>The oiliness has lessened considerably, the dry patches are gone and the one blemish I&#x27;ve gotten cleared up incredibly quickly.  </li>
      <li>It absorbs quickly and even though I have problematic skin (dry, sensitive and acne prone)</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t irritate my eczema/psoriasis and is very long-lasting and you only need a tiny bit to really saturate your whole face.</li>
      <li>but I&#x27;m too busy to go in a brick and water to pick it up.</li>
      <li>I have to apply it at least 5 or more times in a row in order for my face to feel somewhat moisturized.</li>
      <li>As a 25 year old professional woman, you can imagine my horror.</li>
      <li>One of the associates recommended it based on my biggest complaint that all the others just sat on top of my skin and never soaked in.</li>
      <li>I have sensitive oily skin.</li>
      <li>My skin can be very dry, particularly in the winter, and is very sensitive.  </li>
      <li>would highly recommend this to anyone with dry skin and sensitive skin issues.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried dozens of moisturizers for my dry, sensitive skin, and even the very expensive ones didn&#x27;t provide the right kind of moisture.</li>
      <li>No more flaky, rough patches, just smooth, soft skin.</li>
      <li>I have very sensitive, dry skin.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend to anyone with dry to very dry sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>Lightweight moisturizer, goes on thick, but quickly &#x27;dries&#x27;</li>

<li> Lightweight moisturizer, goes on thick, but quickly &#x27;dries&#x27;</li>
<li> I&#x27;m not sure if it was a real one.</li>
<li> It is the only brand I can find that contains ceramides without all the other harmful ingredients such as parabens.  </li>

<li> I am a little suspicious of the quality of this product, not the same consistency as the version I purchased from Sephora.</li>
<li> I need to share this to save other women out there from using this product.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve used other products that made me shiny but assisted in clearing my skin.</li>
<li> , some of the other reviews left here made me wonder if the reviewers had received a counterfeit product or a bad batch because I&#x27;ve never had a single issue with it being heavy, pungent smelling, or with it stinging my skin (despite my aforementioned sensitive skin).  </li>
<li> I received a half empty bottle of product!</li>
<li> so you don&#x27;t feel like you&#x27;ve just bathed in light crude oil.  </li>
<li> personally don&#x27;t like using this at night because i usually use heavy intensive night creams.</li>
<li> This moisturizer costs half than what I used to buy</li>
<li> This moisturizer doesn&#x27;t feel heavy</li>
<li> The cream was heavy in texture, did not agree with my skin type.  </li>
<li> There have also been a few times</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have been using this for awhile as my main Moisturizer for my face.. Love it.. Its lite and does not go on oily.</li>
    <li> Jury is still out...&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t feel this is as moisturizing as the all over ultra repair, but it&#x27;s nice.</li>
    <li> Used the one for body and loved it. Thought this one for face (and pricier) should be even better. Not for me :( It irritates my face badly. My skin is acne prone but never sensitive.</li>
    <li> I need to share this to save other women out there from using this product. After using my other face lotion for years, I switched to First Aid Ultra Beauty face lotion for something more moisturizing. I specifically asked the woman working at Sephora if it will cause break outs, she assured me no. A couple weeks after I started using it, I started to break out with tiny little acne bumps on my forehead. As a 25 year old professional woman, you can imagine my horror. My skin was flawless and all of a sudden I have teenage acne. It was horrifying. I didn&#x27;t even realize it was the lotion (stupid me, I thought it would be climate, what I was eating) after I went to the dermatologist to get benzoyl peroxide cream and an oral acne anti-bacterial medicine. After two weeks of quitting this lotion, my skin is finally going back to normal BUT it will take months for a full recovery. I am so utterly disappointed with this brand AND the Sephora worker who said this wouldn&#x27;t make me break out. BE CAREFULL.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t leave your face greasy!</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive, dry skin. I have tried several different lotions and none of them seem to work. I went to Sephora one day and the woman there recommended I try this. This lotion does NOT do ANYTHING for my skin. I have to apply it at least 5 or more times in a row in order for my face to feel somewhat moisturized. There have also been a few times it has caused my face to feel irritated and burn briefly. I personally would not recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I almost never write reviews, but I have to comment on this product.  I have peri-menopausal hormonal skin - oily patches, dry patches and lots of breakouts.  This product improved my skin from the very first application and has left it nearly flawless after a week&#x27;s use.  The oiliness has lessened considerably, the dry patches are gone and the one blemish I&#x27;ve gotten cleared up incredibly quickly.  I&#x27;m thankful every single time I use it.</li>
    <li> This one has so strong  chemical smell. Also I felt my face was burning when I tried it on.So bad....I&#x27;m not sure if it was a real one.</li>
    <li> Surprisingly, this product irritated my skin, making my face hot and itchy. I would recommend trying a sample in person first (at a store like Sephora).</li>
    <li> Had been using the body lotion and loved it!  Bought this to give it a try and I love this as well.  My skin can be very dry, particularly in the winter, and is very sensitive.  This product is great it doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin at all and since using it my skin looks great.  Would highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Best moisturizer I&#x27;ve ever found for dry winter skin. This is my second winter in a row using it, and I know I&#x27;ll buy another bottle next year, too! It&#x27;s amazingly lightweight and sinks into skin immediately - it almost has a gel-like texture rather than cream. I have extremely dry skin and it keeps my face moisturized all day long. No more flaky, rough patches, just smooth, soft skin. I highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I have sensitive oily skin. Every moisturizer I&#x27;ve used makes me look super shiny, almost immediately. This one didn&#x27;t. It lost a star because aside from keeping my face moisturized, they were no additional benefits. I&#x27;ve used other products that made me shiny but assisted in clearing my skin.</li>
    <li> Buy from a certified retailer. I am a little suspicious of the quality of this product, not the same consistency as the version I purchased from Sephora.</li>
    <li> I love this moisterizer!  It is the only brand I can find that contains ceramides without all the other harmful ingredients such as parabens.  I stopped using Cerave for this reason, however my face began to break out.  Once I started using this lotion I rarely have a blemish.</li>
    <li> Love this project and the seller was so quick!</li>
    <li> I love this product but I&#x27;m too busy to go in a brick and water to pick it up. Just when I thought, &amp;#34;yes I can order from amazon&amp;#34;! I received a half empty bottle of product! Warning!!!! I will never purchase another product from this seller! Don&#x27;t do it!!! You too will be out of $25!</li>
    <li> My face was used to very expensive, Dior, etc creams. After I had children, I found my skin to be a lot more sensitive. I sought an answer and first bought this at Sephora, but found it cheaper on Amazon :)</li>
    <li> Lightweight and easily absorbed. It really almost no scent to it which I like. The fact that it doesn&#x27;t feel greasy is a big plus for me. Even if I use it right before bed, it doesn&#x27;t stain my pillowcase. I&#x27;m on my second purchase.</li>
    <li> the caveat here is that I have SUPER sensitive skin so if your skin is &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; sensitive or even normal, this would be a great product for you.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for years</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried dozens of moisturizers for my dry, sensitive skin, and even the very expensive ones didn&#x27;t provide the right kind of moisture.

This moisturizer costs half than what I used to buy, it&#x27;s light, absorbs easily and doesn&#x27;t have any irritating ingredients. I couldn&#x27;t believe that it was so light, yet so potent. Highly recommend to anyone with dry to very dry sensitive skin. I use it over the Philosophy &amp;#34;Hope is Not Enough&amp;#34; oil. If you&#x27;re desperate, try that combo. It&#x27;s taken me years to discover the right products for my skin.</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive and dry skin, and I need very good moisturizer, especially living in a place as arid as Colorado. It doesn&#x27;t irritate my eczema/psoriasis and is very long-lasting and you only need a tiny bit to really saturate your whole face. I don&#x27;t even use one full pump, but just do a sort-of half pump to get the right amount out. Obviously it goes great with the FAB cleansers!</li>
    <li> The cream was heavy in texture, did not agree with my skin type.  Would not purchase this product again.</li>
    <li> Good product for the money</li>
    <li> Is a good product but does make my face breakout more. But great for dry winter air it doesn&#x27;t take much and us kinda thick.</li>
    <li> I decided to try this after becoming a huge fan of [[ASIN:B0083S44LM First Aid Beauty Ultra Repair Instant Oatmeal Mask-2 oz.]].  I love that mask so much that it is one of the regulars in my rotation, despite being pretty promiscuous when it comes to beauty products.  I had been using [[ASIN:B000UO3GGQ Ole Henriksen Sheer Transformation Age Defence, 1.7 Fluid Ounce]] and had been pretty happy, but given my past positive experiences with First Aid Beauty I was curious to try more products from the brand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This face moisturizer is quite awesome.  It absorbs quickly and even though I have problematic skin (dry, sensitive and acne prone) I found this didn&#x27;t give my skin any issues.

If you receive a product like that, to me it suggests something is wrong and I&#x27;d recommend pushing for a refund or a replacement.</li>
    <li> It is very moisturizing, excellent product...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend this to anyone with dry skin and sensitive skin issues.</li>
    <li> Best moisturizer!!! Not greasy and keeps my dry skin moisturized in the north east winter . I have tried every product out there it seems and this is by far the best</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin and could never find a moisturizer that didn&#x27;t break me out - until now! I love this moisturizer!! It goes on smooth, dries quickly, and makes my face feel super soft (and not oily). I would recommend this product to anyone</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m on my 3rd bottle of this moisturizer and still loving it. I have oily/sensitive skin so its tough finding a moisturizer that absorbs, doesnt irritate/clog my skin, and still hydrates. I&#x27;ve tried many brands including philosophy, murad, clinique, neutrogena, aveeno, etc. the list goes on. This moisturizer doesn&#x27;t feel heavy and i&#x27;m happy knowing my skin is hydrated all day!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;silky texture&lt;br /&gt;unscented&lt;br /&gt;quick absorbing&lt;br /&gt;hydrating&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;good for day not night&lt;br /&gt;no SPF&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I personally don&#x27;t like using this at night because i usually use heavy intensive night creams. Try this moisturizer, you&#x27;ll love it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 63 years old with skin that is getting more and more wrinkles and is drying out.  This face moisturizer does the trick.  It is affordable, does the job, and does not clog my pores.</li>
    <li> Have purchased this product from a store before and really liked it. However, I received a bottle from this company that was dirty and looked old. Thankfully I didn&#x27;t have any problem returning it.</li>
    <li> Lightweight moisturizer, goes on thick, but quickly &#x27;dries&#x27; so you don&#x27;t feel like you&#x27;ve just bathed in light crude oil.  Great product for daily use, but is not an intensive moisturizer for very dry skin.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin and it works very well. No scent for those with allergies. No skin irritation. Stays on skin even in humidity.</li>
    <li> I have tried dozens of moisturizers over the last two years and none of them could touch this one. I found it by \\&quot;accident\\&quot; while desperately searching through Sephora. One of the associates recommended it based on my biggest complaint that all the others just sat on top of my skin and never soaked in. I had never heard of this brand, and for the low price of $22.00, I decided to take a chance. I am so glad I did! P.S. I also use this moisturizer under and around my eyes, they love it!
