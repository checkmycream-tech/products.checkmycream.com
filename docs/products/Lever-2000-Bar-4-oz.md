<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This soap smells nice, washes easily (unlike many other kinds of soap and shower gel) , my skin seems soft and hydrated, and, of course,the price is unbeatable.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin, and the Original Lever 2000 is the best soap I&#x27;ve found.</li>
    <li> gets me clean. recommended, good value.</li>
    <li> I use this soap all the time I didn&#x27;t know I could find a bargan like that I will be ordering again.</li>
    <li> I buy in bulk. Great deal and lovely scent. Great!</li>
    <li> I have been on the search for a bar soap that I love. I always used to use Caress and Dial but I wanted something different. I recently purchased Ivory soap only to end up being very unhappy with it. My husband uses Irish Spring, so that smells more manly than anything. Haha. After going through bar soaps at the store, I decided to come home and see if I could find better pricing on the two I was looking for. It was either this specific soap or Lever 2000&#x27;s other bar soap made of Aloe &amp; Cucumber. I went with this one. I am one of those people who enjoy finding the better deal on products and saving money wherever I can. Everyone in my family uses something different to clean themselves when it comes to bathing. For me, this soap will most likely last me for an entire year. 24 bars of soap at this price is awesome and you don&#x27;t see these prices in a store. So glad this is offered on Amazon! I am very happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> The never ending box of soap :-) :-) :-)!</li>
    <li> We really love this soap at my house, and it&#x27;s very convenient to have &amp;#34;Subscribe and Save&amp;#34; keep us from running out.</li>
    <li> Lever 2000 is a nice smelling soap for me. It doesn&#x27;t aggravate my skin or leave a film. The real benefit and the big reason for the 5 stars are the great price found on Amazon and the quantity. It&#x27;s nearly Costco sized and cheaper than what I can find locally.</li>
    <li> Excellent product and price.</li>
    <li> Husband uses it - he likes it just fine, works like soap should. ;)</li>
    <li> Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-clean unisex smell&lt;br /&gt;-one bar lasts quite awhile (longer than Irish Spring-what I was using prior)&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-the soap fragrance does not last long on skin (definitely not as long lasting as Irish Spring)</li>
    <li> I like this soap a lot. It&#x27;s a good price and it lasts me a long time. I&#x27;m a 22 year old woman and I work at a grocery store. I have to move around a lot and I tend to get sweaty sometimes. This soap makes me feel fresh all day and the fresh smell lasts 8-9 hour shifts. I use it with a shower pouf and the lather is very good and it rinses off easily with out leaving a weird residue. I always use lotion after a shower though because my skin can get dry. I&#x27;d recommend it to anyone!</li>
    <li> really cleans and smells great</li>
    <li> For whatever reason just about every soap and fragrance breaks me out in a rash. After much experimentation to find the right soap, this soap does not cause me any issues. It is a fresh clean scent but not overwhelming after your shower. It also replenishes your skin with nutrients and minerals and it certainly helps me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It contains skin hydrators and leaves my skin less dry but fresh and clean unlike other deodorant soaps that causes my skin to get a rash and get very dry. It works for my wife and I and we use only this soap. Once you find something that you are not allergic to you don&#x27;t easily change to another product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This update is that I am still using this soap and it works well for me.  I like the fragrance and the way it foams up when I shower.  This is my favorite shower soap.</li>
    <li> works as expected, bars of soap in a box.</li>
    <li> Favorite soap, awesome that i got a good deal on amazon</li>
    <li> A wonderful soap for sensitive or dry skin.  It comes at a price as it gets used up more quickly, but worth it.</li>
    <li> This is the best soap I have ever used.  We always used the white bar that used to float until I read reviews on Lever.  Bought a box at the local big box store to compare.  Loved the clean rinse feeling!  Not going back to the white bar....and ordered 6 months worth from Amazon at a great price!</li>
    <li> Can cause slight dry skin if left to long on skin,</li>
    <li> My family loves this soap, and with this price I actually saved about the cost of four bars, hey, any saving is good in this day and time, and were clean!!!</li>
    <li> only bar soap the family will use.</li>
    <li> Good price. Love the smell.</li>
    <li> I like it b/c it&#x27;s good for keeping all my 2000 parts clean.  I can use it on my face and other parts.  All feel clean.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Lever soap for years, but don&#x27;t go to the warehouse store anymore.  I&#x27;m glad you can get this stuff on Amazon now.  Only problem is that my new dog likes to grab it out of the shower and chew on it so we now have to keep the bathroom doors shut :D</li>
    <li> I have used Lever 2000 every day for over 5 years and would not use another cleansing product for my skin. This brand was first recommended to me by my midwife while I was pregnant with my second child and kept getting bladder infections. Maybe TMI for some, but the midwife explained to me that using the &amp;#34;new&amp;#34; liquid body washes as opposed to the old-fashioned bar soaps was not the best for cleaning your skin. The bar soap with tallow (yes, rendered animal fat - definitely a yuck factor for a vegetarian) really does the best job of removing harmful bacteria, especially &amp;#34;down there&amp;#34; where body washes fail to kill bacteria that may be the cause of recurrent bladder infections. Lever 2000 is strong enough to clean but doesn&#x27;t sting and I can also use it for shavig. It rinses well even in our soft country water. Also acts as a great deodorant soap to keep smell away, I have been able to get rid of aluminum based deodorants. So even though at the time I was generally opposed to using animal products, the health of my body while pregnant came first, and I am glad I switched to Lever 2000. Scent is also not overpowering and I am VERY sensitive to artificial fragrance. I have recommended this product to friends who have also had bladder infection issues and all have reported less problems or no problems at all any more. As for myself, I haven&#x27;t had a problem since switching to Lever 2000, a miracle for someone who would get an infection at least  twice a year even with drinking lots of water and doing the whole cranberry blueberry thing too. I wish my regular doctor would have told me about this years ago!</li>
    <li> Really, this is one of the best &amp;#34;commodity&amp;#34; soaps if you ask me.  Leaves my skin clear, doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out, it&#x27;s residue free, and I come out of the shower squeaky clean.  Leaves me with a nice clean smell, not the smell of a weird cheap perfume that I get from some cheaper scented soaps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lever fits the bill very well.  Might not have the same exotic scents that the more expensive brands have, but it&#x27;ll sure do the job that it is intended for - to clean you up!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unless there is a sale at your local retail store (walmart, safeway, etc) you can be fine with buying on amazon, but in my case the price was not better.  In fact, I bought from amazon, and the same day went to safeway, only to find the same soap on sale for cheaper!  Oh well, only a few bucks.  If it wasn&#x27;t for the sale, prices would have been near identical.</li>
    <li> I find it unnecessary to shampoo my hair now.  Lever soap alone is good enough. It keeps my hair looking good and gives it a feeling of freshness. Only sometimes if need be, I use No Gray Quick Fix to cover gray areas,</li>
    <li> Good deal and fast shipping.</li>
    <li> Good Stuff! Not a whole lot to say, its soap, smells good and does what its supposed to do, gets me clean.</li>
    <li> What a great value for a wonderful product. This soap leaves you smelling fresh and feeling clean. Each bar is individually wrapped which makes storing easy and quick to grab and go for trips. I would recommend this to anyone and an even better deal if you subscribe and save.</li>
    <li> we love this soap and it&#x27;s a really fantastic price.</li>
    <li> Smells Fresh but not overpowering!  Most other soaps are either too poserful or too soft.  This is just right for me YMMV though.</li>
    <li> five star for good smell and good cleaning</li>
    <li> We like the nice subtle scent of Lever bar soap and the value for what I paid is great. Will continue to purchase if it comes back to the subscribe and save world.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve gone through a lot of soaps but none has ever performed well like Lever 2000 bath bar.  It doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin and I truly feel clean when I use it.  There are moments when I do feel a bit dry but not as dry as the other soaps that I&#x27;ve tried.  This soap was the soap of issue when I was in boot camp in the United States Navy.  I became rebellious and tried other soaps but came right back to this very soap today.  The soap isn&#x27;t perfumy.  It smells like a soap should be.  Great stuff, I use it everyday!</li>
    <li> I was searching for a good and cheaper alternative to the overpriced soap I use and this was a great surprise. Will definitely purchase again.</li>
    <li> Hey, this is basic, inexpensive bar soap. No grit, no color, no &amp;#34;cream&amp;#34; - just soap. It&#x27;s not organic. It&#x27;s not edible, probably. it doesn&#x27;t have a flowery scent. Or stripes. It won&#x27;t be found at the green market or the Ulta store (that&#x27;s a cosmetics store, gentlemen). It&#x27;s just soap. I like that. If you like bar soap in your shower, this is a great choice.</li>
    <li> I live the Lever brand of soap and was just looking to order online rather than running to the store. This was received as expected and performs like I&#x27;d expect from Lever. Nice sudsing, not too perfumey, cleans and rinses well.</li>
    <li> This is a good basic bar soap.  It has a clean, fresh scent and it rinses off easily.  Would recommend.</li>
    <li> Very pleased.  I was looking for a soap that didn&#x27;t turn our wash cloths green or blue.  Read the reviews for this one (a white, essentially non-perfumy soap at a reasonable price) and thought I would give it a go.  Very pleased.  Exactly what I was looking for!</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this soap.  It gets me very clean and it is a good price for 24 bars.</li>
    <li> Great Buy!!! About to purchase more.. &amp; has also recommend this product to others..Keep up with the great deals/bargains. It&#x27;s worth the purchase</li>
    <li> The synthetic nature of this soap (i.e. no animal fats used) and the fragrance of palm oil make it the most outstanding of all brands.  The easy rinsing to get it off is a very special attribute.</li>
    <li> Very reasonable price for this high quality fine milled soap! We all love the great scent of this original Lever 2000 soap, and we go through a 24 bar box rather fast!</li>
    <li> my husband has a dry skin problem. so far, this product is only one that doesn&#x27;t give him skin stress.</li>
    <li> A great way to purchase bar soap.  Has a clean soft fragrance.</li>
    <li> The seller did a good job of selling their great product to me.</li>
    <li> I ordered the 12 bar not the 24 one</li>
    <li> Have been using it for over 20 years and i was disappointed when Costco stopped carrying this product. I was glad to see it at a comparable price on Amazon. I like that it does not have and overwhelming fragrance and (according to my wife) leaves your skin feeling smooth and moisturized.</li>
    <li> Works as expected. My go to body soap</li>
    <li> OK it&#x27;s soap but this fragrance is very clean smelling and my skin has responded over the Dove I had been using.</li>
    <li> Before I used this soap, I was dirty. Now I&#x27;m not.</li>
    <li> My husband loves this soap. It&#x27;s the only one that will get him clean when he comes home from working on machinery all day long. I&#x27;m not so fond of it because it dries my skin, but we do live in a desert so not everyone may have that problem. It DOES get you clean!</li>
    <li> I have been using Lever soap for years and I will not even try another soap product. These have very limited smell, which I like a lot.</li>
    <li> This is the soap I usually use. It lathers well, does not shrink to much &amp; has a nice pleasant smell. It also rinses clean. I like it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Lever since it came on the market what seems like 15-20 years ago. continues to be awesome.</li>
    <li> Great price and fast shipping have it on the subscription items</li>
    <li> This smells fantastic and leaves my body feeling great, refreshed and clean. The bar size is perfect and lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> Who doesn&#x27;t love this Lever soap? Squeaky clean and smells great - Best price around!</li>
    <li> This is an excellent soap.</li>
    <li> Great soap and excellent size package. Get some for your household. My wife would be proud of my decision this time.</li>
    <li> delivered as described</li>
    <li> good value, Lever 2000 just makes me feel clean but without the heather price tag and unnecessary dryness and cologne smell.</li>
    <li> Smells nice. Gets me clean and pleasant after a very smelly workout.</li>
    <li> Lever 2000 soap has been a great soap for us for a lot of years. Doesn&#x27;t dry your skin out like other soaps. Love the fragrance. It is not an over bearing perfume smell.</li>
    <li> Use to be able to buy this soap at Costco, but no more. So glad I searched for it on Amazon.com. I really like this soap...mild, scent free, and very reasonably priced.</li>
    <li> Very satisfied. Item arrived as stated.Just as I expected. Item arrived in time. I was very satisfied with this order. Will buy in the future</li>
    <li> been using this for many many years.&lt;br /&gt;a very effective slightly anti-bacterial&lt;br /&gt;soap that was initially recommended by a physician.</li>
    <li> Great price. I&#x27;m not sure if I could&#x27;ve got cheaper at Costco or Sam&#x27;s, but I didn&#x27;t have to leave my house to find out.</li>
    <li> i love this soap !!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;no scent, and leaves your skin clean without the feeling ow lotion like many other soap out there.</li>
    <li> Love this soap and am always looking for a great price.</li>
    <li> I got this at a great price and the soap is not half bad. Honestly, I have bought worst soap at more expensive prices so I am happy with it. I have some fancy nicer smelling soap for when I want to smell good if I am going out with my girl or somewhere really nice but this does the trick most days of the week.</li>
    <li> Hard to find the Original scent Lever sometimes. This is a great buy for the price and last a long time. I buy only once every 12-18 months because I don&#x27;t use it exclusively but I have to have it.</li>
    <li> Great buy good soap cheaper than anywhere else</li>
    <li> I purchased these at Walmart, I have tried many different soaps and hasn&#x27;t stick to any of them till this one. It&#x27;s economical, we love the smell, cleanness and softness of the skin after shower with Lever.</li>
    <li> Ups messed up an now its a refund</li>
    <li> Good price on good soap.</li>
    <li> I find that the sent is and very perfume like.  Powdery sent, which smells clean, but something I am not really into.  It&#x27;s fine, but have more of an issue with the soap is drying.  I used in summer and was not flaking, but has that white dry looking skin, so would be terrible for me in winter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lathers really well and for the price is a value if you don&#x27;t get dry skin, or use lotion regularly.  I just will have to look for something more to my liking.</li>
    <li> Great Soap love the clean feel I get from it doesn&#x27;t leave a film on your body but just a clean refreshing feel I would recommend this to anyone who is allergic to scents</li>
    <li> I am used to Lever bath soap as it is way better quality than other soaps. I recommend it highly</li>
    <li> Lathers great, love the smell and I feel really clean after a shower. I wish the bar would last a little longer though, it seems to shrink fairly quickly.</li>
    <li> Need soap? How about enough to last you a year?  I don&#x27;t have skin allergies, odor issues, or anything unique forcing me to use special soaps.  I&#x27;m an average Joe-single-empty-nest guy who rarely makes it to the store.  That said, I love the subscribe and save aspect of Amazon.com.  You buy this freight-car of soap, and you set it up for home delivery every 6 months.  So what to do with all the extra bars?  I put the individual boxes each in a drawer so that my clothing always smells fresh.  The only down side is that sometimes you gotta pull out a few drawers to find your next bar.  Lever 2000 is creamy and leaves me smooth and fresh scented.  I don&#x27;t have a water softener, but it does it&#x27;s job equitably with very little fuss.  The bars don&#x27;t fracture (like some I&#x27;ve had), and when they get to a certain size you can &#x27;stick&#x27; one to the next bar.  Yeah, I&#x27;m thrifty too.</li>
    <li> I have been using Lever 2000 for many years.  For me, this is the best body cleansing product that also protects me the rest of the day.  I have tried the other soaps that claim to offer oder protection but they don&#x27;t work for me.  Of course they may for others but the scents, lather and protection Lever 2000 provide make me a believer and a customer for ever.</li>
    <li> Smells good, I like it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not too picky when it comes to soap. I&#x27;ll admit that I&#x27;ll use almost any brand. But my family does use a lot of soap and I needed an affordable bulk buy. This 24 count package was just what I was looking for. It comes neatly packaged in two different sets of 12. They are wrapped in plastic and then each individual soap also has it&#x27;s own cardboard box. I like this because they&#x27;re easy to stack, store, and are the perfect size for in a bathroom mirror or cupboard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The soap is quality stuff. Unlike other soaps that get soft and easily &#x27;erode away&#x27; in the shower, this stuff holds up really well. You can scrub just a few times on a washcloth and get enough suds to last you through your entire bathing experience. The smell is very light and not overpowering. That&#x27;s why I&#x27;d recommend this to people who are sensitive to smells- especially pregnant women and children. And this stuff definitely gets you clean. I feel squeaky clean the second I step out of the shower. It cuts threw grease and dirt like a pro and leaves you feeling totally refreshed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One bar typically lasts my family about a month. So this pack will last us TWO years! For only $16.00, I&#x27;d say that&#x27;s a really great deal! It&#x27;s great for kids because it isn&#x27;t overpowering. The smell is very subtle (almost non-existant) and the suds aren&#x27;t too harsh (in case of those bubbles accidently getting in the eye).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also lathers nicely, for women who use soap to shave instead of shaving cream. I use this soap and it works nicely. It hydrates my legs and keeps me from getting knicked by my razor. Not all soaps offer that sort of protection, so I really like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, high quality soap. And it comes in bulk! Win win!</li>
    <li> i was talking to a family member and telling them you can order anything online.  just then someone walked in the room and mentioned that they were going to walmart and if anyone needed anything.  the person i was talking to said they needed soap.  i asked what kind and how many.  they told me and i told them you can order that online.  they didn&#x27;t believe me so i whipped out my phone, went to the amazon app and ordered their soap.  i also order them some foot spray.</li>
    <li> Had not used this brand for a while.  Glad I bought it again...very clean, but not drying.  Will buy again.</li>
    <li> I DID USE USE THESE SOAP FOR A LONG TIME PREVIOUS YEARS.</li>
    <li> Shit-ton of soap. Buy it and never buy soap again. Well, I mean like 3-6 months at least depending on how often you shower.</li>
    <li> I have purchased this soap from Amazon.com before. I know that I will be purchasing it again. I like the soap and it is a great deal money wise. It came quickly. No complaints.</li>
    <li> great Product, and dont run out as fast with subscribe and save program will buy again.</li>
    <li> Since the day Lever 2000 came out I always loved the product. So, the only purpose of this review is to clarify that this listing is for only 12 bars. NOT 2 packages of 12 bars. ONLY ONE package of 12 bars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 07-23-2015:&lt;br /&gt;Actually, this listing is for a total of 24 bars (2 x 12bar packages). Amazon only ships one 12 bar package in error. Just something to watch out for.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t expect much from soap.  It needs to get me clean and be reasonably priced.  This soap satisfies the bill on both counts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update:  I&#x27;m a bit puzzled why Amazon isn&#x27;t shipping this product direct any more.  \\&quot;Customers have told us there may be something wrong with our inventory of the item, the way we are shipping it, or the way it&#x27;s described here.\\&quot;  Really?  Considering that there are only 5-star reviews for this product it would be nice if we could get a review from whoever had the problem so we know what is going on here.  I am definitely not paying $40 from a Marketplace Seller for this product if Amazon still isn&#x27;t selling it when I run out.  Fortunately that should not be for a couple years!</li>
    <li> not as chemically as other soap.</li>
    <li> Super fatty delivery.  I&#x27;m impressed.  Delivered as promised.</li>
    <li> we have used this soap for years.  I probably should have given it a 5-star, but it&#x27;s bath soap...</li>
    <li> It is a good soap for cleaning, but I found the smell somewhat perfumey.  I&#x27;m sure a lot of people would like that, but it is not my taste.</li>
    <li> Smells great, rich lather, doesn&#x27;t dry out skin.  Oh, and it cleans!</li>
