      <li>Nice price as well.</li>
      <li>Stay in hair nice and snug.</li>
      <li>My daughter has fine hair, so maybe you need thicker hair for this to look good.  </li>
      <li>This product does not work if you have very fine hair</li>
      <li>can&#x27;t wait to tey more styles.</li>
      <li>and everyone thought I went to the salon to get my hair done :)</li>
      <li>The teeth would not &amp;#34;catch&amp;#34; and then while piling hair on top of it, it would move all over the place.  </li>
      <li>I love these Bump-its...</li>
      <li>I love these darn things.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s like a pimple on the top of your head.  </li>
      <li>and Im satisfied with the results</li>
      <li>I have curly hair and should have known better to try something like this</li>
      <li>These looked better online.  </li>
      <li>I am so tickled and happy with this product, and highly recommend it!</li>
      <li>Sure gave my hair plenty of volume.</li>
      <li>These Bumpits are ehhhhhhh OK.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure this works</li>
      <li>However, you really have to use great hair spray to make the bump-it stick to your hair.</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t lose the instructions and it will be OK.</li>
      <li>So glad I found these again after 10 years!&lt;br /&gt;Love</li>
      <li>I lt came with 3 Bumpits 3 different sizes and a ever CUTE note that had the minion on it loved it !!!!!!</li>
      <li>The directions are ok.</li>
      <li>Teasing w/hairspray works much better and faster than this product.</li>
      <li>I really recommended since it is soo easy to use!!</li>
      <li>Blow drying and hairspray is required for the full effect!</li>
      <li>They slip off easily.  </li>
      <li>I bought this product in the hopes that I could achieve some volume in my fine, curly hair.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m putting these (and my dreams of fabulous retro hair) away in a drawer.</li>
      <li>you&#x27;re unsure of how to use the BumpIts, check out any of the YouTube videos available online.</li>
      <li>So the medium was the only size that looked attractive</li>
      <li>/&gt;But the thing is good.. for soft smoothy hair.......</li>
      <li>They are so quick and easy to use.</li>
      <li>Love these things so much!</li>
      <li>They fit in right</li>
      <li>Overall LOVE!</li>
      <li>The little one was great when I pulled my hair around the sides and put a barette in it.</li>
      <li>but Amazon made everything right as they always do.</li>
      <li>, it just slid right off, fell onto the floor, and broke into pieces.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Very real looking hair</li>
      <li>&quot; my hair by making my layers very short on top, therefore my hair cannot cover up the bump it</li>
      <li>, I just don&#x27;t use them on a daily basis as I have better things to do with my time than play with my hair all morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It is much easier to just tease your hair!</li>
      <li>My first time using these</li>
      <li>The bumpits are exactly how they were described.</li>
      <li>I have thin hair, so i do have to tease a bit and use a bit of hairpray, but in the end i think they still look amazing, much easier than trying to make my own \\&quot;poof\\&quot;...</li>
      <li>It was much easier to use than I imagined !</li>
      <li>If you need help on how to use it I really recommend going on youtube and looking at people&#x27;s tutorials on how to use a bump-it!</li>
      <li>Received fast after ordering and with no breakage or issues!  </li>
      <li>but I&#x27;m glad I finally bought this bumpit.  </li>
      <li>But doesn&#x27;t work for my hair which is quite a lot but lay flat at the top.</li>
      <li>I consider my hair pretty fine, not to mention the fact that the sides of my head are shaved (sort of like a mo-hawk, except I don&#x27;t spike it up in the middle)...</li>
      <li>After numerous tries by at least 3 skilled people I opted to tease and do an updo which came out great!!!!!  </li>
      <li>It comes in three sizes, but the largest size is so ridiculously large it makes your head look like you&#x27;re hiding a large tiara underneath your hair.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t have use for all of the pieces but certain ones worked for me</li>
      <li>Directions are fairly straight forward.</li>
      <li>These worked really well.</li>
      <li>really great~~~so its hit or miss and for me it was a miss_</li>
      <li>The whole point of purchasing these was so I</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know how it works, but I find it really wear.</li>
      <li>I have very fine dark hair and this product really helped to bump up my puff.</li>
      <li>They worked out okay, but the bump looked a little funny.  </li>
      <li>I would not recommend this product in particular if you are like me, just spending 5 to 10 minutes in the morning to get ready.</li>
      <li>Lazily thrown into the box, cheap plastic, didn&#x27;t fit into my hair at all and as soon as I tried to move my hair into place</li>
      <li>I prefer the middle sized one, since I&#x27;m not into the Snookie look, lol, and the little one is just too little for me, but overall I love these!</li>
      <li>The middle sized one gave me a super-Snookie bump, and the largest one had me at full blown Amy Winehouse.</li>
      <li>The largest size was a little too high for my taste but the other two are great.</li>
      <li>2-2.5in high (for the height) and</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this.</li>
      <li>we&#x27;re helpful they worked fine as I expected it to work.</li>
      <li>Make sure to tease your hair plenty, though, so that the little &amp;#34;barbs&amp;#34; don&#x27;t show through.</li>
      <li>Just wish it was a little longer to cover the sides better.</li>
      <li>If you have thick hair and a lot of hair spray they work amazingly well.  </li>
      <li>It took me a little while to figure it out, but now that I&#x27;ve played around with it, it is super easy and simple to use.</li>
      <li>I could never figure out how to get the little poof on my own, so finally got the Bumpit.  </li>
      <li>I really wanted to love this product and definitely went into the purchase with little hope based on the reviews.  </li>
      <li>but if you have a particularly large or small head, you may have some trouble fitting the two larger pieces that sit at the top or back of the crown as they are fitted for the average-sized head.</li>
      <li>Its much too big to be not visible.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I read a lot of iffy reviews, and so I waited quite a while before ordering. I wish I wouldn&#x27;t have. I LOVE these things! I consider my hair pretty fine, not to mention the fact that the sides of my head are shaved (sort of like a mo-hawk, except I don&#x27;t spike it up in the middle)... I didn&#x27;t have a problem using them at all. I didn&#x27;t even tease my hair.  I did however add medium hold hairspray prior to flipping my hair back over the bumpit. I found this sort of mattes the hair together so that the teeth of the bumpit don&#x27;t poke through. The biggest bumpit was pretty useless to me, but more because the width of the unshaved part of my hair is smaller than the length of the arch. Overall LOVE!</li>
    <li> If you have thick hair and a lot of hair spray they work amazingly well.  If not then don&#x27;t bother.  And you still have to tease your hair, so don&#x27;t be fulled into thinking this save your hair from damage.</li>
    <li> These work great. Part your hair, place on the part, fold hair over and adjust...voila! The little one was great when I pulled my hair around the sides and put a barette in it. can&#x27;t wait to tey more styles.</li>
    <li> I have really thin hair and it is a pain to get some volume in my hair and especially to tease my hair. This thing actually works despite the low/average reviews it has gotten. It made my hair look really good!!! I love this thing!!! However, you really have to use great hair spray to make the bump-it stick to your hair. I really recommended since it is soo easy to use!! If you need help on how to use it I really recommend going on youtube and looking at people&#x27;s tutorials on how to use a bump-it!</li>
    <li> It takes awhile to get use to how to properly put these in your hair.  There are lots of informative instructions with them and several size bumpits.  Definitely worth the few bucks I spent on them to accomplish what I needed.</li>
    <li> It was a good thing. But not suit for curly hair. I have curly hair and so i think my hair will break.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the thing is good.. for soft smoothy hair.......&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Excellent seller.............</li>
    <li> This product worked just like it said it would on the infomercials. I&#x27;m not really sure how to use the smallest one but the other two I use all the time. You can&#x27;t even tell they&#x27;re in my hair. I highly recommend this.</li>
    <li> I love these Bump-its... I have thin hair, so i do have to tease a bit and use a bit of hairpray, but in the end i think they still look amazing, much easier than trying to make my own \\&quot;poof\\&quot;... I prefer the middle sized one, since I&#x27;m not into the Snookie look, lol, and the little one is just too little for me, but overall I love these!</li>
    <li> I have very fine dark hair and this product really helped to bump up my puff. I don&#x27;t tease my hair (because it won&#x27;t tease) so I just blow dry my hair, separate the front, insert and clip up at the top/back. Hairspray should probably be used with this or after awhile the plastic starts to show through. Just wish it was a little longer to cover the sides better.</li>
    <li> It was much easier to use than I imagined !I&#x27;ve only used the medium insert, but it worked like a charm!</li>
    <li> These worked really well. I have very thick, heavy hair and they didn&#x27;t fall out. The largest size was a little too high for my taste but the other two are great.</li>
    <li> Works great in my hair! I love it! Couldnt be happier with this product! I use it everyday! Everyone should buy one of these!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t use them often but when I do, my hair looks awesome!!  Blow drying and hairspray is required for the full effect!</li>
    <li> This is the most useless thing I&#x27;ve ever seen! It was impossible to use it in some hair because it does not have any fixation on the head and even less hair. It is rubbish and I think this was the worst use of money I&#x27;ve ever done in the last year.</li>
    <li> Love it! I ware all three sizes and always get compliments. They are so quick and easy to use. Updews and everyday casual look. It fits any occasion. Tip of advice...if you see the spikes just push your hair forward and spray it with hairspray and Bobbie pin it. Spikes just mean you have it too tight.</li>
    <li> These Bumpits are ehhhhhhh OK. The hair inserts are smaller than expected and not incredibly well made (which I DID expect for the low price). The directions are the really good part of the product. It explains how to use the Bumpits well. So you get what you pay for. Don&#x27;t lose the instructions and it will be OK.</li>
    <li> They slip off easily.  The hairstyles shown are out of date.  The tiny one is hard to use and the big one is too big.  The directions are ok.</li>
    <li> These do not work what so ever. Do not waist your money!!!! Hair does not even cover the insert and I have VERY thick hair! Save your money!!!</li>
    <li> Received fast after ordering and with no breakage or issues!  Needed them for a pageant and they serve their purpose.</li>
    <li> My first time using these and they work like a charm. You have to be patient and careful when taking them out. I used the biggest one to give myself an updo for a ball I went to and everyone thought I went to the salon to get my hair done :)</li>
    <li> I love these darn things.</li>
    <li> These are so difficult to use. It is much easier to just tease your hair! I don&#x27;t use them at all and they are shoved into the back of my drawer collecting dust.</li>
    <li> It does what it says! Definitely volumizes. Make sure to tease your hair plenty, though, so that the little &amp;#34;barbs&amp;#34; don&#x27;t show through.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if its beause I don&#x27;t know how it works, but I find it really wear. It doesn&#x27;t stick to the hair and falls again and again. I would not recommend this product in particular if you are like me, just spending 5 to 10 minutes in the morning to get ready.</li>
    <li> Great seller  so i gave it three stars but product doesnt work on all hair types. I have thin long hair and it just wouldnt stay it looked very odd even when i teased it and used hairspray, but my friend tried it and she has very thick hair and it worked really great~~~so its hit or miss and for me it was a miss_</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on these, they&#x27;re cheap pieces of junk. Lazily thrown into the box, cheap plastic, didn&#x27;t fit into my hair at all and as soon as I tried to move my hair into place, it just slid right off, fell onto the floor, and broke into pieces.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Again, don&#x27;t waste your money, invest in a nice round brush and hair dryer to volumize naturally.</li>
    <li> So glad I found these again after 10 years!&lt;br /&gt;Love These!</li>
    <li> Comes w/3 different sizes. This requires a lot of work. I tried it a few times on different days, had someone else try it also. Watch several video tutorials on how to use the product but it still did not work like it&#x27;s advertised too. I have thick wavy hair and the teeth still showed through and it did not even sit in my hair. Teasing w/hairspray works much better and faster than this product.</li>
    <li> I bought this product in the hopes that I could achieve some volume in my fine, curly hair.  Unfortunately, this product was very visible through my hair unless it was placed so low that it just made me look like I had an alien head.  In addition, the teeth used to secure the comb to your hair were very difficult to detangle from my hair.  Bumpits simply didn&#x27;t work for me.  It seems that you need hair thick enough to achieve the same style without the product in order to use it.</li>
    <li> I liked it! I thought it&#x27;s a great way to bump your hair! I just wish it didn&#x27;t involve teasing the hair because that damages the hair follicles still.</li>
    <li> It took me a little while to figure it out, but now that I&#x27;ve played around with it, it is super easy and simple to use.</li>
    <li> The Bumpits I order we&#x27;re helpful they worked fine as I expected it to work. They fit in right I lt came with 3 Bumpits 3 different sizes and a ever CUTE note that had the minion on it loved it !!!!!!</li>
    <li> I used them for a show I was in and they worked like a charm. With a few bobby pins, I didn&#x27;t even have to worry about them shifting during the show.</li>
    <li> found this at local dollar store and thought I would give it a try. They don&#x27;t hold hair at all. I didn&#x27;t like how tall they are. Didn&#x27;t work at all for my thin hair.</li>
    <li> I bought these to try out for those limp-hair days. The first set I got had a broken piece in it but Amazon made everything right as they always do. Depending on your hair type and level of skill when it comes to fiddling with your hair, these may work for you or they may not. It&#x27;s a pretty small investment so if you&#x27;re curious, I would recommend trying them as there is a set of about four or five pieces and chances are, you&#x27;ll find at least one of them useful. I don&#x27;t have use for all of the pieces but certain ones worked for me, I just don&#x27;t use them on a daily basis as I have better things to do with my time than play with my hair all morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re unsure of how to use the BumpIts, check out any of the YouTube videos available online. A lot of reviewers complained that their BumpIts were totally useless, but in fact, they&#x27;re just not meant for all hair types. I have super-thick hair, and lots of it, so I actually didn&#x27;t even need to tease mine to get the piece to stay in, but if your hair is on the thinner side, then you will probably have to go all-out with the teasing and hairspray, in which case, getting the piece out may prove to be a nightmare. I would imagine it&#x27;s like getting gum out of your hair! Anyway if you have lots of thick hair, I think these would work and not show once placed, and provided you have enough hair to cover the piece!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing to note is that the components are made of a very rigid plastic, which isn&#x27;t a big deal if you&#x27;re only using the smaller pieces that are meant for the bangs but if you have a particularly large or small head, you may have some trouble fitting the two larger pieces that sit at the top or back of the crown as they are fitted for the average-sized head. I would think it&#x27;s more a problem if your head is too big than too small.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m always a little late to jump on any bandwagon but I&#x27;m glad I finally bought this bumpit.  My hair is fairly long, layered and naturally wavy/curly.  I have used this product a couple of times.  I really like to wear it with a ponytail for work because it just makes a ponytail look a little classier (I think).  Directions are fairly straight forward.</li>
    <li> I never thought I&#x27;d want these but they&#x27;re perfect for my hair for my Hawaiian wedding, I&#x27;ll be wearing a Haku and this is the perfect lift I need!!</li>
    <li> My hair is too thin for these to work</li>
    <li> Work great. Stay in hair nice and snug. Nice price as well.</li>
    <li> did not stay in my hair</li>
    <li> This product does not work if you have very fine hair like I do. It would not stay put in my hair nor could I get it covered sufficiently to hide it.</li>
    <li> Despite the not so good instructions it did not work as instructed!  After numerous tries by at least 3 skilled people I opted to tease and do an updo which came out great!!!!!  I paid $10 to have the darn thing expressed to me because I was out of town for a wedding.  It arrived a day late but in time for my event.  Awful product!!!</li>
    <li> These looked better online.  They worked out okay, but the bump looked a little funny.  My daughter has fine hair, so maybe you need thicker hair for this to look good.  Very real looking hair</li>
    <li> These bumpits arent bad, I was curious to see if they worked though theyre so cheap. They work well and Im satisfied with the results</li>
    <li> It comes in three sizes, but the largest size is so ridiculously large it makes your head look like you&#x27;re hiding a large tiara underneath your hair.  The small size is so tiny the &amp;#34;bump&amp;#34; doesn&#x27;t stretch across the crown of your head.  It&#x27;s like a pimple on the top of your head.  So the medium was the only size that looked attractive but then I couldn&#x27;t get it to stay in and I have very thick hair. The teeth would not &amp;#34;catch&amp;#34; and then while piling hair on top of it, it would move all over the place.  Ended up just tossing them.</li>
    <li> These ended up being a little bit too long for me to wear in my hair.  No matter the amount of manipulation I did on my hair, they still managed to show through and I have very long, thick hair.  I prefer the smaller sizes.</li>
    <li> Love these things so much! Save me so much time in the morning (: and always flawless! Will always love these!</li>
    <li> They were weird sizes, not long enough or too long.  Not high enough either.  I bought a set for all of our cheer team and no one will use them.  My advice, go to a store that sells them and check them out personally.</li>
    <li> The bumpits got stuck in my hair and broke multiple strands when I tried to get them out.</li>
    <li> The whole point of purchasing these was so I *wouldn&#x27;t* have to tease and damage my hair-&lt;br /&gt;and the instructions say to tease your hair to cover the bumpit&#x27;s teeth poking through your bump.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve fiddled with all the sizes for a while now and none of them are too impressive. The middle sized one gave me a super-Snookie bump, and the largest one had me at full blown Amy Winehouse. The littlest one made me look like i had a tumor on the back of my head.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m putting these (and my dreams of fabulous retro hair) away in a drawer.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m sure this works but I&#x27;ve yet to figure it out.</li>
    <li> These are a waste of my money. I have tried to use them and they are awful. Wast of money.</li>
    <li> I ordered these so I wouldn&#x27;t have to tease my hair anymore, but they are hard, uncomfortable, and simply do not work. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried teasing to keep this think in place but just doesn&#x27;t work for me.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve got it in my goodwill pile to get rid of it.</li>
    <li> I really wanted to love this product and definitely went into the purchase with little hope based on the reviews.  After purchase, I came out with no hope.  The tiniest size had potential, but either didn&#x27;t have enough teeth or was poorly designed so it didn&#x27;t stay in place (lifted up and moved around).  All of the other sizes made me look like I came off the set of Hairspray.  I also have a lot of hair and still found it difficult to fully cover the bump-it so as to not see it.  Total disappointment!</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work for my hair. Its much too big to be not visible. If you wear a wig under it, maybe then it works. But doesn&#x27;t work for my hair which is quite a lot but lay flat at the top.</li>
    <li> I was told these were difficult to put in. I had no problem at all. It was fun to wear for my Halloween costume, and who knows I might even use it everyday. Sure gave my hair plenty of volume. Great product.</li>
    <li> I bought it as a gift..it does not hold to the hair.</li>
    <li> the pieces slip and slide while under my hair and show through; I think my hair just isn&#x27;t thick enough though.</li>
    <li> I tried to like these but they just make your hair look strange, not volumized. My advice...don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> I have thick shoulder length hair and it wS hard to keep in and uncomfortable!</li>
    <li> This purchase was a waste of time and money for me.  I have curly hair and should have known better to try something like this, it is a nightmare to remove from my hair.</li>
    <li> The bumpits are exactly how they were described. I do not leave them in my hair all day.  I blow dry them in my hair after a shower to give it some volume.</li>
    <li> You must have extremely thick hair to cover the bumpit, which I do. My hairdresser actually complains about how thick it is each time she sees me. However, my hairdresser \\&quot;thins out\\&quot; my hair by making my layers very short on top, therefore my hair cannot cover up the bump it and I cannot use it.&lt;br /&gt;Your hair must be long and thick enough to have the combs at the bottom of the bumpit to stay underneath a part of your hair, while another part  of your hair reaches up from the front (approx.) 2-2.5in high (for the height) and then 2-2.5inches down the other side (to cover the bump-it completely not). If you do not have the thickness &amp; length to cover all of these at the crown, use of the bumpit will not be successful.</li>
    <li> 1. The sizes are bad:  The small one is tiny and the \\&quot;medium\\&quot; one is huge, so there really is no good medium-sized option.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. The shape is bad:  They are not shaped to make a human head still look human.  They&#x27;re only curved in the left-right direction.  From front to back there is a blunt rectangular dropoff, so it literally creates a BUMP on your head.  Seems like someone should make a hair volumizer that&#x27;s curved in all directions.  If anybody has heard of one, please let me know!</li>
    <li> I could never figure out how to get the little poof on my own, so finally got the Bumpit.  Such a waste of money.  Even after searching on youtube how to use it (the directions in the box are silly), the Bumpit looks ridiculous and the teeth still show through.  Such buyer&#x27;s remorse and paying the shipping to return it is not worth just throwing it away.</li>
    <li> I have had an issue with thinning hair for several years now, and usually have to use barrettes in my hair to cover the wide, extended  part down the back.  When I saw the Bumpits, I thought it was just one of those bad ideas for a bad product, but after seeing some demonstrations on YouTube, I decided to try them.  I followed the tutorial online: pulling some of my hair up, lightly spraying it with hairspray and letting it dry slightly, teasing it just a little, inserted the medium Bumpit, carefully smoothed the hair, and just stared in AWE at how pretty and fashionable my hair was!!!  AND I didn&#x27;t have to wear it UP to cover any embarrassing thin spots!!  I am so tickled and happy with this product, and highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> Perfect!!! Fit great and on time!!!</li>
