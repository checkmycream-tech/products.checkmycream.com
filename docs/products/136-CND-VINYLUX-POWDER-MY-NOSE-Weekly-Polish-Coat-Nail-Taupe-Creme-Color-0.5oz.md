      <li>This is the best neutral color yet.</li>
      <li>I did get the color grapefruit by CND and applied it over this one and it looks awesome together!</li>
      <li>I would like to see more colors on Amazon to buy!!!</li>
      <li>I have very fair Caucasian skin, and the polish is lighter than my skin tone.  </li>
      <li>Great delivery.</li>
      <li>I loved the Vinylux nail polish.....</li>
      <li>This is a great color, a nice pinkish tan.</li>
      <li>It lasts just about a week and does keep a good shine as promised.  </li>
      <li>I use this brand and love it, but this color streaks!</li>
      <li>Love this polish!  </li>
      <li>I bought this color in vinyllux after loving it in the shellac</li>
      <li>Still beautiful, and the polish itself is great: a real gel (&#x3D;strong!)</li>
      <li>Delivered quickly - love LOVE the color!  </li>
      <li>This is the nailpolish I go to when I want a nude shade and its so pretty with the best part that it last me literally more than a week with no chip!!!</li>
      <li>The color (Powder my nose) is more translucent than I hoped for but it is a nice color if I layer it 3 times.</li>
      <li>the colors are great in this genre of polish and should be applied exactly as directions state</li>
      <li>and you will love it.</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s much more ivory than nude.</li>
      <li>I like opaque shades better.</li>
      <li>Love the taupe color.</li>
      <li>and then this on top.</li>
      <li>along with the top coat, it doesn&#x27;t chip.  </li>
      <li>love it because of the durability.&lt;br /&gt;Now</li>
      <li>I love the color and it lasts forever even after cleaning with chemicals and having my hands in water.</li>
      <li>All in all I love the color and the durability of the polish</li>
      <li>but I actually love the color</li>
      <li>This polish stayed unchipped for more than a week.</li>
      <li>This color was more nude than it looks in the picture</li>
      <li>Make sure to purchase the top coat to ensure additional shine &amp; protection.</li>
      <li>You must use the top coat to.</li>
      <li>It lasts for over 7 days with the top cot.</li>
      <li>No matter how many coats I put on.</li>
      <li>Love this product.  </li>
      <li>Revlon is much better.  </li>
      <li>Perfect on its own for a clean look, but I tried it as a french.</li>
      <li>While the color is a nice natural color, that is about where the good things end.  </li>
      <li>I love the color but feel its a tad too pinkish once on the nails and would be too much against my ivory dress, but its a good color otherwise</li>
      <li>I have been searching for the perfect shade of a powder pink or a nude for my nails for my wedding coming up</li>
      <li>The color does not go on smoothly and with the top coat, it started peeling in two days.</li>
      <li>Applies evenly and dries very quickly.  </li>
      <li>that lasts and is easily removed with acetone polish remover.</li>
      <li>Most of the light pinks don&#x27;t look good on my skin tone, but this one is more like an ivory.&lt;br /&gt;Vinylux goes on thicker than nail polish and is different than nail polish.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s light with a hint of  taupe</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t go on smoothly, streaks so have to put 3 - 4 coats for even coverage.  </li>
      <li>It looked fantastic.</li>
      <li>Fantastic</li>
      <li>This polish will last a good week.  </li>
      <li>(I will be getting married outside the country and need to be able to do my nails on my own).</li>
      <li>Dries so quick.</li>
      <li>The color requires a lot of coats to look good, but the polish lasts a long time.</li>
      <li>It lasted a couple of days and came right off.</li>
      <li>As usual great service by Amazon.  </li>
      <li>polish lasted ok, as far as durability, but it was very streaky.</li>
      <li>Got the product I wanted for a very reasonable price.  </li>
      <li>color is lighter and has more white in it than appears on the Amazon pic.  </li>
      <li>I use the Cover Girl top coat with it and it lasts up to 10 days and comes off like regular nail polish.</li>
      <li>I applied regular polish over it and then used he Vinylux top coat.  </li>
      <li>It really does last longer than most nail polish.</li>
      <li>despite all the positive reviews, I could not get this polish on my nails without streaks.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>As promised, it does come off easily with regular nail polish</li>
      <li>First, the Vinylux completely lives up to its promise: dries very fast, and it just lasts and lasts on my problem nails.</li>
      <li>It really is a &amp;#34;powder&amp;#34; sort of color.  </li>
      <li>Like vinylux but was very dissappointed in the color.</li>
      <li>Even after a few coats, it is still very streaky and does not look nice.  </li>
      <li>Nice pale color.  </li>
      <li>I will have to,remove it and put on a different,  tried and true Vinylux color.</li>
      <li>Probably great using the Vinylux brand for base and top coat.</li>
      <li>This product doesn&#x27;t work,they say it last up to a week before chipping your lucky if you get 3days,would not use ever again</li>
      <li>I love this color, especially with a french manicure, but also as a stand alone.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;I will continue to order more of the Vinylux colors as this is the only type of polish I&#x27;ve been wearing for the last 6 months.</li>
      <li>I would highly recommend.</li>
      <li>This particular color is lovely but went on unevenly and streaky.  </li>
      <li>Nice thick polish.</li>
      <li>Although it&#x27;s not exactly what I expected, I think it&#x27;s a very sophisticated look</li>
      <li>the product did was was expected and lasted more than an entire week with no chips.  </li>
      <li>Usually my nails chip by the second day, but this easily lasts for 5 as long as you use the top coat.</li>
      <li>The color darkens over the course of a couple days and your nails start looking almost a light black.  </li>
      <li>Not sure it will last more the 4-5 days though</li>
      <li>This polish really does last a long time.  </li>
      <li>It shows up somewhat clear unless you add several coats.</li>
      <li>It does last one week and because of the natural looking color, you can get away with close to two weeks.</li>
      <li>Cause nails that split back and does not last near a week</li>

    <li> Applies evenly and dries very quickly.  The color darkens over the course of a couple days and your nails start looking almost a light black.  Hard to get off.  Revlon is much better.  I use the Cover Girl top coat with it and it lasts up to 10 days and comes off like regular nail polish.</li>
    <li> This is the best neutral color yet. Perfect on its own for a clean look, but I tried it as a french. It looked fantastic. I tried it also with Grapefruit Sparkle and it gave it its oomph.</li>
    <li> Love this polish!  Stays for a week too!</li>
    <li> Like vinylux but was very dissappointed in the color. It wasnt described correctly. It is very sheer. I like opaque shades better.</li>
    <li> the colors are great in this genre of polish and should be applied exactly as directions state and you will love it.</li>
    <li> Delivered quickly - love LOVE the color!  Not as pink as the picture - but I actually love the color - I would call it a buff color.  Because it is so neutral, when it starts to wear a little, you can hardly tell.</li>
    <li> It really does last longer than most nail polish.</li>
    <li> I loved the Vinylux nail polish.....It stays on for over a week!!  I would like to see more colors on Amazon to buy!!!</li>
    <li> It lasts just about a week and does keep a good shine as promised.  I plan to try other colors soon.</li>
    <li> This is the nailpolish I go to when I want a nude shade and its so pretty with the best part that it last me literally more than a week with no chip!!!</li>
    <li> I bought a bunch of colors from a beauty supply shop.&lt;br /&gt;I usually prefer dark colors, but once in a while I like a neutral, light color.  Most of the light pinks don&#x27;t look good on my skin tone, but this one is more like an ivory.&lt;br /&gt;Vinylux goes on thicker than nail polish and is different than nail polish. I need 3 coats of this to give it a matte look.  Let it dry a bit in between.</li>
    <li> This is the color to get when you want to &amp;#34;fake&amp;#34; that &amp;#34;naturally pink&amp;#34; healthy-looking nail color. I give three coats. It does last one week and because of the natural looking color, you can get away with close to two weeks.</li>
    <li> despite all the positive reviews, I could not get this polish on my nails without streaks.&lt;br /&gt;I gave it several tries, but did not get the results that I had hoped for.&lt;br /&gt;The polish lasted ok, as far as durability, but it was very streaky. I tried several very thin coats, but no success.</li>
    <li> This product doesn&#x27;t work,they say it last up to a week before chipping your lucky if you get 3days,would not use ever again</li>
    <li> Like the polish and products of Vinlyx, but it seems like if you keep it on for any length of time, it definitely weakens (my) nails.  Great delivery.</li>
    <li> It lasts for over 7 days with the top cot. The color (Powder my nose) is more translucent than I hoped for but it is a nice color if I layer it 3 times.</li>
    <li> Love this product.  Nice pale color.  Goes on well.</li>
    <li> This color was more nude than it looks in the picture</li>
    <li> This polish will last a good week.  I would highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Color on my nails like an ivory (not really taupe and no pink at all, as it might appear online).  Still beautiful, and the polish itself is great: a real gel (&#x3D;strong!) that lasts and is easily removed with acetone polish remover.</li>
    <li> along with the top coat, it doesn&#x27;t chip.  I am so hard on my hands / nails!  This polish stayed unchipped for more than a week.</li>
    <li> While the color is a nice natural color, that is about where the good things end.  The polish does not go on evenly at all.  Even after a few coats, it is still very streaky and does not look nice.  I did use it as a base coat.  I applied regular polish over it and then used he Vinylux top coat.  I dont know if that helped at all...I just happened to see it on a beauty blog.  Overall, I wont buy this polish again.  The streaks are not appealing, and calling this a weekly polish is laughable.  It lasted a couple of days and came right off.</li>
    <li> The color requires a lot of coats to look good, but the polish lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> I bought this color in vinyllux after loving it in the shellac but it&#x27;s much more ivory than nude. Seems to be holding up relatively well. Not sure it will last more the 4-5 days though</li>
    <li> I love this color, especially with a french manicure, but also as a stand alone.  It is sheer and comparable to Essie&#x27;s marshmallow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I&#x27;ve noted in other reviews, the CND Vinylux will last a week as promised and sometimes longer.  Make sure to purchase the top coat to ensure additional shine &amp; protection. As promised, it does come off easily with regular nail polish remover.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to order more of the Vinylux colors as this is the only type of polish I&#x27;ve been wearing for the last 6 months.</li>
    <li> I have been searching for the perfect shade of a powder pink or a nude for my nails for my wedding coming up (I will be getting married outside the country and need to be able to do my nails on my own). I love the color but feel its a tad too pinkish once on the nails and would be too much against my ivory dress, but its a good color otherwise and I will be using it just not for my wedding. I did get the color grapefruit by CND and applied it over this one and it looks awesome together! gives it a little shimmer. All in all I love the color and the durability of the polish</li>
    <li> I love the color and it lasts forever even after cleaning with chemicals and having my hands in water. It also lasted through 5 long days on vacation at a water park!</li>
    <li> First, the Vinylux completely lives up to its promise: dries very fast, and it just lasts and lasts on my problem nails. Fantastic formula.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This color is lighter and has more white in it than appears on the Amazon pic.  I have very fair Caucasian skin, and the polish is lighter than my skin tone.  It really is a &amp;#34;powder&amp;#34; sort of color.  Although it&#x27;s not exactly what I expected, I think it&#x27;s a very sophisticated look and I wear it a lot.</li>
    <li> color goes with everything</li>
    <li> This nail color was thick and seemed old&lt;br /&gt; I had it applied at the salon and it was gloopy and streaky. I could not use it, and to return it would add insult to injury because the shipping cost would make the purchase too expensive overall. Buyer beware.</li>
    <li> Horrible. Cause nails that split back and does not last near a week</li>
    <li> This polish really does last a long time.  Usually my nails chip by the second day, but this easily lasts for 5 as long as you use the top coat. This is a great color, a nice pinkish tan.</li>
    <li> I use this brand and love it, but this color streaks! No matter how many coats I put on. I would not buy this color again.</li>
    <li> This is a classic color that you can&#x27;t go wrong with. It shows up somewhat clear unless you add several coats. If you want it to show up as the color in the bottle You can do a gray color underneath of it and then this on top. That&#x27;s typically what I do. This polish lasts forever!</li>
    <li> the product did was was expected and lasted more than an entire week with no chips.  very happy with product</li>
    <li> The color does not go on smoothly and with the top coat, it started peeling in two days. Not what I expected.</li>
    <li> I heard about this product from a friend.&lt;br /&gt;I love it because of the durability.&lt;br /&gt;Now my nails can look as if I just had them manicured.&lt;br /&gt;I will be ordering this again.</li>
    <li> My girlfriend told me about this polish and had it applied at the nail salon. It stayed on and didn&#x27;t chip for 9 days. Decided to buy myself a bottle. You must use the top coat to. Love the taupe color. It&#x27;s light with a hint of  taupe</li>
    <li> Dries so quick. Nice thick polish. I used a non-Vinylux base coat and it peeled terribly. Probably great using the Vinylux brand for base and top coat. Will be trying that.</li>
    <li> Not worth the bother. It doesn&#x27;t go on smoothly, streaks so have to put 3 - 4 coats for even coverage.  In less than 2 days, it peeled off my nails. I will have to,remove it and put on a different,  tried and true Vinylux color.</li>
    <li> This particular color is lovely but went on unevenly and streaky.  I will return it.</li>
    <li> Did not go on evenly...</li>
    <li> As usual great service by Amazon.  Got the product I wanted for a very reasonable price.  Thank you.</li>
