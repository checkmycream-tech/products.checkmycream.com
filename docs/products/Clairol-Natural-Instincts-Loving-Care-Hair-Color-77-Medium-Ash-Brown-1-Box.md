<li> In comparison, there is no harm at all by leaving this stuff on too long.</li>
<li> The two part stuff lasts longer but one mistake - i.e. leaving it on too long</li>
<li> I have used this product for years because it looks so natural and washes out in a few weeks.</li>
<li> but unfortunately they are not available any more</li>
<li> The only problem is that it only lasts for a few days, which is what it&#x27;s meant to do.  </li>
<li> Unfortunately, out of desperation, before I found out about it I paid over $1500 for two years worth of Loving Care from a seller on ebay :((</li>
<li> I haven&#x27;t gotten any younger, but at least I&#x27;ve stopped making faces in the mirror.  </li>
<li> I would prefer Dark Brown 79</li>
<li> The product meets our expectations, However I must state that using it for decades I used to pay 10 times less than this time.</li>
<li> Clairol eliminating this product was a big, big disappointment.  </li>
<li> Duh.</li>
<li> I have to go to bed for at least 2 days while I recover.</li>
<li> Now I am stuck with 96 bottles of 3 year old hair color! :(</li>
<li> However the shipping cost is ridiculous.</li>
<li> I am one of a very small percentage of people that have a violent reaction to approximately 99% of normal hair dyes.</li>
<li> The newer version by Clairol is irritating to my scalp and not nearly so nice on my hair.  </li>
<li> My skin within minutes becomes sore and big welts develop which makes me so sick</li>
<li> To us it is devastating because my wife is allergic to all other products (including British substitute).</li>
<li> If you get it wrong your eyebrows and your mustache will be darker than you hair.</li>
<li> and oh boy will you be sorry.</li>
<li> It makes the hair look dirty and separated.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s too bad Clairol no longer makes this product.</li>
<li> It is awful!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Ordered for my mother and she loves it.</li>
    <li> The product meets our expectations, However I must state that using it for decades I used to pay 10 times less than this time. Over $100 for one item! It is unaceptable!!! What is the reason for such price? To us it is devastating because my wife is allergic to all other products (including British substitute).</li>
    <li> Did not care to much for this product.</li>
    <li> I just love Clairol Lovong Color #77 Medium Ash Brown. It is non permanent and washes out well with shampoos, without doing any damage to my hair. It gives my dark brown and gray hair a really nice warm golden glow. It is becoming  more and more difficult to find. I purchased my last 3 bottles at Amazon.com because I cannot find it at any local stores. Why is Clairol discontinuing this product?</li>
    <li> This item is no longer sold in retail stores, but while this seller still has some available we are glad to have the chance to obtain it.  We&#x27;ve used it for years--it is easy to apply, perfectly safe and has the desired effect.</li>
    <li> When my favorite hair color was discontinued, I was very upset, because it was the only product that I knew of that contained no peroxide as well as no ammonia. Then I saw it offered on Amazon and scrambled to buy what was still available. When it arrived the company kindly included notice that it was now being produced in the UK, and would continue to be available. I worried for awhile about whether the rest of the ingredients would be the same . Finally I overcame my anxiety, used the product and was over the moon with the results. I haven&#x27;t gotten any younger, but at least I&#x27;ve stopped making faces in the mirror.  :) Totally Pleased!</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t get this in any local stores.  So I needed to get it online came quickly but Shipping seemed pricy based on cost of product.    My mom however thanks you.</li>
    <li> Perfect in every way for those of us who are allergic to hair dye.  Keeps color for at least 8 weeks or more.  Very easy to apply.</li>
    <li> I am a guy. And I will tell you straight out that the \\&quot;for men\\&quot; hair colors are basically a reduced selection of the ladie&#x27;s products, and overpriced. Just buy the stuff for women - it&#x27;s all the same anyway.  This colorant is very easy. The two part stuff lasts longer but one mistake - i.e. leaving it on too long and oh boy will you be sorry. In comparison, there is no harm at all by leaving this stuff on too long. I tint my hair when traveling to business meetings where I think it will matter so I use it occasionally. There are a lot of warnings about putting this stuff near the eyes or on the mustache. Here&#x27;s what I can tell you: ALL of these tints are poisonous and should not be placed in your eyes. Duh. However, that said, I do put this tint on my eyebrows and my mustache. It is true that they don&#x27;t pick up the color as well as my hair, but for my purposes it&#x27;s good enough. I have the special a+b dye for those areas and it does work better, but remember the warning about timing. If you get it wrong your eyebrows and your mustache will be darker than you hair. Just try to explain that!    I purchased online because in my area the stores tend not to carry this temporary dye. Rather than waste time searching for it, I was happy to find a dealer at Amazon. However the shipping cost is ridiculous. I would have bought three bottles but not with that amount of shipping cost. There are hundreds of shades in this product line and men can mostly ignore the details, but will definitely find what they want.</li>
    <li> Covers well and lasts for a couple of weeks without washing out completely. It&#x27;s too bad Clairol no longer makes this product.</li>
    <li> The greatest hair color! It gives your hair shine, body, and conditions. Does not harm your hair. After having such a hard time finding this loving care at a fair price, I tryed the next step, which damaged my hair and felt like straw. Sooo grateful that Amazon now has my favorite color at a good price. Thank you Amazon! I have been using this color for 34 years! Very Grateful!</li>
    <li> I would prefer Dark Brown 79 but unfortunately they are not available any more so I have no choice but to use this product</li>
    <li> Stay away from the Clairol Beautiful Collection it leaves a waxy, sticky residue in my hair. It is awful! It is damaging to the hair to just comb through it. The waxiness lasts even after several shampoos, at which time all the color is gone anyway. It makes the hair look dirty and separated. It looks horrible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was told about this product that is just like Clairol Loving Care [...] I read the reviews and the women are raving about it. Unfortunately, out of desperation, before I found out about it I paid over $1500 for two years worth of Loving Care from a seller on ebay :(( Now I am stuck with 96 bottles of 3 year old hair color! :( I wish I had known!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found it here for 5.99 a bottle. it&#x27;s bigger then Clairol&#x27;s was too!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[...]</li>
    <li> This the only one product that I can use without cause allergy. When I use it my hair looks very nice , hidrateted and soft .</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years because it looks so natural and washes out in a few weeks. It makes my hair look shiny and healthy with no damage or dryness. I was quite perturbed when I could no longer find this product on the shelves in my local stores.  I Am very happy to have found a source that makes this product available for purchase again. Would highly recommend this product for anyone who likes natural looking color for their hair.</li>
    <li> Received this product very quickly and the item was as described.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this item to freinds and family.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B0013NFYO0 Clairol Natural Instincts Loving Care Color 077 Medium Ash Brown]]I have used Clairol Natural Instincts Loving Care Color 077 Medium Ash Brown for years with complete satisfaction. I use it once a week guaranteeing that the color remains strong.  I am one of a very small percentage of people that have a violent reaction to approximately 99% of normal hair dyes. My skin within minutes becomes sore and big welts develop which makes me so sick I have to go to bed for at least 2 days while I recover. This product is the ONLY one I have discovered which does not any side effect and I do not mind that I have to use it every week.</li>
    <li> This product was discontinued long ago, and I am still looking for something as good. They had the perfect shade matching my natural color and it did nor harm the hair.</li>
    <li> Thank heaven SOMEONE still has reserves of this product.  For those of us allergic to peroxide and ammonia, this hair color is a Godsend.  The newer version by Clairol is irritating to my scalp and not nearly so nice on my hair.  Loving Care leaves my hair manageable and soft.  Aaah.</li>
    <li> Great product for people who experience allergic reaction to other hair coloring products.  Clairol eliminating this product was a big, big disappointment.  If you are looking for a comparable product get in touch with Nationwide Campus.  There is now a company producing a similar product which you can purchase through them.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s so easy to use, the color is perfect (no reddish highlights) and it exactly what I need for the small areas of gray that crop up.  It&#x27;s also great to use for the whole head of hair.  The only problem is that it only lasts for a few days, which is what it&#x27;s meant to do.  I have used this for many years.  I wish Clarol would bring it back, and I wish the semi-permanent colors were this easy to use (no mixing).</li>
