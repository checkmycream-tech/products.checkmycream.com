      <li>I am very pleased with the performance of this shave handle.</li>
      <li>It is a nice close shave without spending a ton of money.</li>
      <li>This shaving handle has some weight to it and fits nicely in the palm of your hand.  </li>
      <li>but it was a nice novelty to try.</li>
      <li>, that&#x27;s a really nice razor\\</li>

      <li>This handle feels good and looks good for the right price.</li>

      <li>Fantastic product!  </li>
      <li>Provides for a much better shave then</li>
      <li>Love feel of razor</li>
      <li>I figured I would treat myself, and I am so glad I did.</li>
      <li>The heavier handle and shape gives a better feel in the hand when shaving.</li>
      <li>This handle is so much better than the Gillette one.</li>
      <li>However, based on their history of selling blades/cartridges, you&#x27;ll still be able to get Mach 3 cartridges for many years, even decades to come.</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s far more attractive</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t like the cheap handles at most stores.</li>
      <li>the Mach 3 heads snap easily into place.  </li>
      <li>I shaved with it for the first time last night and it feels awesome.</li>
      <li>Item packed securely and arrived very quick.</li>
      <li>So there you go, a good razor handle, and a personal protection device, what more can a man desire in a razor?</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this for anyone looking for a nice shave and also as a gift for any guy.</li>
      <li>not only looks great but is super sturdy.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll be honest, I was looking for a new Mach razor on prime and couldn&#x27;t find one-</li>
      <li>I figured it wasn&#x27;t worth reducing the rating by a star, given that it&#x27;s sucha great product at a great price (currently $15.99 on Amazon, which isn&#x27;t that much more than the original Gillette handle, which you would have trouble finding now anyway).  </li>
      <li>handle goes Gillette one better, as the handle is not only more attractive than the original Gillette one, but it&#x27;s heavier, which seems to lead to a slightly closer shave - yet without irritation.  </li>
      <li>Item shipped quickly as well from the vendor.  </li>
      <li>This is not only awesome and fits for the Mach 3, but it is very heavy and stylish.</li>
      <li>it is seamless and so very smooth but the ergonomic handle allows you to hold on to the handle in even the slippriest conditions.</li>
      <li>so I ordered right away.</li>
      <li>This handle has some weight to it and it is built very well!</li>
      <li>I have only tried it with authentic Mach 3 blades so far, but those fit perfectly.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Will not hesitate to recommend this to others that want a stylish, solid, shaving handle.</li>
      <li>I have gotten in the habit of checking the handle to make sure the top/bottom fit is tight before shaving, about once a week or so.  </li>
      <li>This item is pretty heavy and kind of slippery at times.  </li>
      <li>I had ordered the ergonomic handle and just received the \\&quot;normal\\&quot; straight one.</li>
      <li>Also the price is very affordable compared to the competition.</li>
      <li>Otherwise, it is a nice and heavy handle that does its job.</li>
      <li>Handle feels nice and heavy</li>
      <li>This shaving handle is nice and heavy and I can really feel the difference in my shave.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s stylish, solid, heavy, and comfortable in the hand.</li>
      <li>The curved handle may also be a factor in the improved shave, since it&#x27;s round (unlike the original Gillette which is essentially square handled) and may enable the blades to follow the contours of your face more closely.  </li>
      <li>The extra weight does give the razor more momentum I guess, and it feels smoother overall...</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product to those who want a sturdy handle to hold.</li>
      <li>The heaviness of this handle at first was disconcerting, but after a few go&#x27;s it feels better than the original handle... less plasticy.</li>
      <li>While not a perfect match to the set, this handle is great.</li>
      <li>Glad I bought this as replacement for my missing Mach 3 handle.</li>
      <li>It seems very masculine, like I could knock out a charging cougar with the butt end of this thing.</li>
      <li>After a while, the top part can become slightly loose, at which point you merely need to screw it more fully together.  </li>
      <li>Before, I was using an old Gillette handle that vibrated.</li>
      <li>When I received it and opened the box, the comment from my son was \\&quot;Wow</li>
      <li>The added weight is nice, but it almost too heavy and is a little akward.  </li>
      <li>I find typical store razors to be very light and almost disposable in the way that they perform and hold up to everyday use.</li>
      <li>I felt like I barely had to touch the razor to my face because the added weight  of the handle did all of the work.</li>
      <li>but light enough to allow you to be delicate</li>
      <li>I was a fan of its sleek design, but for the amount of money I spent on this, I hoped it would last much longer.</li>
      <li>This handle is really pretty and shiny and HEAVY.  </li>

<li> This handle is really pretty and shiny and HEAVY.  </li>
<li> So Mach 3 Turbo is a big winner for me; I plan to use it as long as Gillette keeps making the blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> Well I am fairly new to the shaving world and has been using plastic gillette mach 3 handles but those were 20-30 dollars and would need to be replaced every few months</li>
<li> Its a very well made product, but I find the handle to be a little heavy and cumbersome.</li>
<li> Although Fusion may shave a tiny bit closer than Mach 3, Fusion gives me a harsh razor burn feeling that lasts for several hours.  </li>
<li> As seen the price, it does not worth the expense to send it back...</li>
<li> No problem with the head coming loose.  </li>
<li> The handle is made from heavy solid medal.</li>
<li> it was heavy enough to get you a close shave</li>
<li> The only thing I didn&#x27;t expect is how heavy the handle is.  </li>
<li> A little heavy at first , but after a few days the heavier weight becomes less noticeable .</li>
<li> I disagree with other posts as the weight &amp; feel of the heavier handle offsets</li>
<li> This razor is an extremely sturdy and well made item.</li>
<li> If you hands are even a little wet this thing will squirm around in your grip.  </li>
<li> It&#x27;s not worth it to me to have a face like a baby (and do I even want that?)</li>
<li> It stripped out in less than two weeks.  </li>
<li> Heavy handle.  </li>
<li> and I was amazed when I found this handle for half the price of the plastic ones I am usually sold</li>
<li> Beware, this thing falling and smoking you in the foot whilst showering is pretty painful.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> The heavier handle and shape gives a better feel in the hand when shaving. Provides for a much better shave then the basic Mach 3 razor handle. I have only tried it with authentic Mach 3 blades so far, but those fit perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;Great product, I would recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with this handles look and feel. The handle is made from heavy solid medal. Glad I bought this as replacement for my missing Mach 3 handle.</li>
    <li> Great feel and weight. Awesome product for the price.</li>
    <li> Fantastic product!  I disagree with other posts as the weight &amp; feel of the heavier handle offsets it being a slick feeling finish as it&#x27;s a pleasure to shave with and the Mach 3 heads snap easily into place.  Item shipped quickly as well from the vendor.  I highly recommend this product to those who want a sturdy handle to hold.</li>
    <li> worked well for a while, but broke after 6 months.  I&#x27;m not sure why they don&#x27;t make these with higher quality..</li>
    <li> I received this shaving handle as a gift for Christmas. Before, I was using an old Gillette handle that vibrated. This handle has some weight to it and it is built very well! I shaved with it for the first time last night and it feels awesome. I felt like I barely had to touch the razor to my face because the added weight  of the handle did all of the work. I highly recommend this for anyone looking for a nice shave and also as a gift for any guy.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like the cheap handles at most stores. Was looking for a quality handle with some weight. This fits the bill!</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe that I never had one before. This is not only awesome and fits for the Mach 3, but it is very heavy and stylish.</li>
    <li> I have purchased a number of razors that fall into the $20 to $50 range. I find typical store razors to be very light and almost disposable in the way that they perform and hold up to everyday use. This razor is an extremely sturdy and well made item. The balance is perfect. When I received it and opened the box, the comment from my son was \\&quot;Wow, that&#x27;s a really nice razor\\&quot; I&#x27;m not sure that I&#x27;ve ever received a compliment on a razor before.</li>
    <li> This shaving handle has some weight to it and fits nicely in the palm of your hand.  Works with Mach 3 razors.</li>
    <li> This item is pretty heavy and kind of slippery at times.  Dropping it could chip tile or damage marble.  I probably would not buy again but it was a nice novelty to try.</li>
    <li> I never knew the handle mattered...After about 20 years of using lightweight plastic razors, I got this to replace a lost mach 3 handle.  The extra weight does give the razor more momentum I guess, and it feels smoother overall...This handle feels good and looks good for the right price.</li>
    <li> I was needing a heavier handle as my wife keeps dropping her razor and breaking it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This not only looks great but is super sturdy.  I&#x27;m really happy with the quality.</li>
    <li> This handle is so much better than the Gillette one. It make me want to shave.&lt;br /&gt;P.S. dont drop this on your foot. It is not plastic.</li>
    <li> I had to replace a broken handle from a shaving set that I have. While not a perfect match to the set, this handle is great. It&#x27;s stylish, solid, heavy, and comfortable in the hand. It takes Gillette MACH3 blades and the end screws out from the handle (for replacement blade holders I&#x27;m guessing).</li>
    <li> beautiful hubby loved it!</li>
    <li> Well I am fairly new to the shaving world and has been using plastic gillette mach 3 handles but those were 20-30 dollars and would need to be replaced every few months so I decided to go online and find a durable handle and I was amazed when I found this handle for half the price of the plastic ones I am usually sold so I ordered right away. When it arrived I was taken by the weight distribution of the handle it was heavy enough to get you a close shave but light enough to allow you to be delicate it was perfect, much better than those plastic handles that had me going all over my face. The look of this handle is gorgeous it is seamless and so very smooth but the ergonomic handle allows you to hold on to the handle in even the slippriest conditions. It locks perfectly into mach 3 razors and I could not be happier. This handle looks and feels like it will last a life time.</li>
    <li> The heaviness of this handle at first was disconcerting, but after a few go&#x27;s it feels better than the original handle... less plasticy. It seems very masculine, like I could knock out a charging cougar with the butt end of this thing. So there you go, a good razor handle, and a personal protection device, what more can a man desire in a razor?</li>
    <li> What can I say?  It comes I&#x27;m two pieces, with the part holding the blade screwing in to the handle.  It stripped out in less than two weeks.  Broke.  Kaput.  End.  Since I have to give at least one star, consider it given.</li>
    <li> Heavy handle.  Love feel of razor</li>
    <li> The added weight is nice, but it almost too heavy and is a little akward.  Perhaps I&#x27;ll get used to it overtime.</li>
    <li> This handle is really pretty and shiny and HEAVY.  However, what I didn&#x27;t expect is how SLIPPERY it is in the shower.  If you hands are even a little wet this thing will squirm around in your grip.  Beware, this thing falling and smoking you in the foot whilst showering is pretty painful.  I&#x27;m thinking of adding some grip tape to it.  I&#x27;m serious about that.</li>
    <li> I had ordered the ergonomic handle and just received the \\&quot;normal\\&quot; straight one. As seen the price, it does not worth the expense to send it back... Otherwise, it is a nice and heavy handle that does its job.</li>
    <li> Its a very well made product, but I find the handle to be a little heavy and cumbersome.</li>
    <li> A little heavy at first , but after a few days the heavier weight becomes less noticeable . Very nice handling .</li>
    <li> This handle is awesome. I&#x27;m a female, always used the Mach 3 razors. I&#x27;ll be honest, I was looking for a new Mach razor on prime and couldn&#x27;t find one- but this razor was. I figured I would treat myself, and I am so glad I did. It looks fantastic, it feels great in my hand, and its compatible with the Mach 3 razor blades that I like!</li>
    <li> Great design, good handle weight and very attractive. It is a nice close shave without spending a ton of money. I give this product the thumbs up!</li>
    <li> Gillette appears to have recently stopped selling Mach 3/Mach 3 Turbo handles in the USA.  However, based on their history of selling blades/cartridges, you&#x27;ll still be able to get Mach 3 cartridges for many years, even decades to come. But you need the handle to make the cartridge work.  This handle, the all-metal ergonomic from Boss, perfectly fits Mach 3 and Mach 3 Turbo cartridges.  Not only that, but it&#x27;s far more attractive (it&#x27;s truly a beautiful product that will look great in any bathroom) and actually shaves better for me than the original Gillette handles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I should also point out that I greatly prefer Gillette Mach 3 Turbo cartridges to any of the Gillette Fusion cartridges.  Although Fusion may shave a tiny bit closer than Mach 3, Fusion gives me a harsh razor burn feeling that lasts for several hours.  It&#x27;s not worth it to me to have a face like a baby (and do I even want that?), if it&#x27;s irritated for hours. So Mach 3 Turbo is a big winner for me; I plan to use it as long as Gillette keeps making the blades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This handle goes Gillette one better, as the handle is not only more attractive than the original Gillette one, but it&#x27;s heavier, which seems to lead to a slightly closer shave - yet without irritation.  The curved handle may also be a factor in the improved shave, since it&#x27;s round (unlike the original Gillette which is essentially square handled) and may enable the blades to follow the contours of your face more closely.  (Or legs or whatever you are shaving). Whatever the reason, it&#x27;s a great shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So what&#x27;s the tiny drawback here?  The metal handle is in two pieces which screw together.  After a while, the top part can become slightly loose, at which point you merely need to screw it more fully together.  I have gotten in the habit of checking the handle to make sure the top/bottom fit is tight before shaving, about once a week or so.  I figured it wasn&#x27;t worth reducing the rating by a star, given that it&#x27;s sucha great product at a great price (currently $15.99 on Amazon, which isn&#x27;t that much more than the original Gillette handle, which you would have trouble finding now anyway).  This is a five star product and if you like Mach 3/Mach 3 Turbo, then you really can&#x27;t go wrong here.</li>
    <li> This shaving handle is nice and heavy and I can really feel the difference in my shave. Also the price is very affordable compared to the competition. Nice workmanship and design.</li>
    <li> Nice weight for a comfortable shave.  No problem with the head coming loose.  You could apply a thread locker compound if it did.</li>
    <li> Excellent feel with weight to handle.</li>
    <li> Purchased from JCG Collection. Very nice shaving handle. Build quality appears excellent. Handle feels nice and heavy, it looks great too - polished chrome. Gillette Mach 3 blades fit perfect. Item packed securely and arrived very quick. I am very pleased with the performance of this shave handle. Will not hesitate to recommend this to others that want a stylish, solid, shaving handle.</li>
    <li> Met all expectations.</li>
    <li> Good quality handle that is great for the price.  The only thing I didn&#x27;t expect is how heavy the handle is.  It takes a bit of time to get used to.</li>
    <li> Perfect weight and balance. Fits perfectly in the stand.</li>
    <li> The razor&#x27;s head is detachable from the stem. I had this razor for only about six months before the screw strips wore off and the head wobbled uncontrollably, which was both dangerous and annoying. I was a fan of its sleek design, but for the amount of money I spent on this, I hoped it would last much longer.</li>
