      <li>Nice Night Cream</li>
      <li>Good product, but the product itself smells like it&#x27;s expired; there is discoloration on the top layer of the cream.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;ve always liked L&#x27;oreal and Lancôme products, so I decided to give this a try.</li>
      <li>This cream absorbs nicely.</li>
      <li>For the price, this product seems reasonably effective,  </li>
      <li>It sort of suits our kind of skin.</li>
      <li>L&#x27;Oreal is just as good at a better price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>If you like the very strong smell of rose, then you might like this product.  </li>

      <li>The scent is pleasant and not too strong (although it is significant), and it does not feel greasy.  </li>
      <li>It is a nice, easily spreadable consistency, and if a nice moisturizer is all you need, this one is fine.  </li>
      <li>The longer I&#x27;ve used it the better</li>
      <li>If I could use it with no smell, I might like it better.</li>
      <li>It Is everithing OK.</li>
      <li>but now I have tried Pond&#x27;s anti wrinkle cream (cheaper) and think I like it better.</li>
      <li>The perfumy smell is overwhelming.  </li>
      <li>I couldn&#x27;t ask for anything more.</li>
      <li>Love it</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I use this cream nightly and I dont know if its the cream, genetics or my optimistic outlook on life but people often think me 10-15 years younger than I actually am.  But don&#x27;t go into this expecting miracles, I mean you gotta have something to start with. Like take me for example, I already have a youthful glow and countenance and this loreal product just helps me keep it. You seriously can&#x27;t expect a topical face cream to bring life back into a face that looks like a moccasin so please adjust your expectations accordingly. Also this has a pleasant scent if that matters to you</li>
    <li> This product makes my skin very soft and blemish-free.  I&#x27;ve been using it for several years.  I am VERY picky about scents and this one is great.</li>
    <li> Great item not greasy takes very little of the product use, otherwise can last for a long time. Love it</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t think it works.  Sorry. Must be a special secret to activate this item.  Guess the proof is in the pudding.</li>
    <li> There is nothing negitive that I can say about this product!!!  It has just the right texture, scent and absorbability...not to mention price!  It does everything that it says its going to, from moisture to tightening!  Love it!!</li>
    <li> Very nice face cream...L&#x27;Oreal Paris Advanced RevitaLift Complete Night Cream, 1.7 Ounce....and a Great price of 13.00 I like it because it&#x27;s not too light or heavy and not greasy!~</li>
    <li> I just buy 2 of it. BUT one anti-forgery tag is open AND It&#x27;s not in the right place. Two products look resembled, SO I assume one of them was opened by someone or it&#x27;s a product defect. Since I have read most reviews about this product：Only one customer thought it&#x27;s forgery.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always been good about caring for my skin and staying out of the sun, but I started noticing some fine lines around my mouth, between my eyebrows and on my forehead after I turned 29. I didn&#x27;t want to spend a ton of money on a wrinkle cream and I&#x27;ve always liked L&#x27;oreal and Lancôme products, so I decided to give this a try. I&#x27;m happy to say it really works wonders. My skin is naturally dry, and this thick, non-greasy cream really moisturizes throughout the night, leaving my skin soft and smooth when I wake up. I also highly recommend using it on your hands, which age just like your face if you don&#x27;t keep them moisturized. I do have sensitive skin and it did sting a little the first couple times, but that&#x27;s because it&#x27;s a retinol product, which is essentially an acid that helps remove the top layer of skin. The stinging went away after the first few days of using it. I gave it 4 stars because of the smell. I don&#x27;t really like it and my husband hates it. I don&#x27;t know why companies feel the need to add fragrance to their products.</li>
    <li> I love this i works good 👍</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t end up using the product because it had a fairly strong smell that I didn&#x27;t like.  Others might not find it objectionable.  I prefer unscented products.</li>
    <li> I guess I really can&#x27;t give an accurate review of this product since I was unable to use it on my face. I do have sensitive skin, but for some reason was lead to believe that this product would not bother me. It did. A lot. Stinging and redness. So, it may very well reduce wrinkles, etc., but not on me lol. I bought it because I have heard very good things about it from other people. If your skin isn&#x27;t super sensitive , go for it. It will probably work. But if you tend to burn in the sun, have to be careful what you put on your face in terms of make-up or creams, etc., i def would  not recommend this for you.</li>
    <li> This night cream is a good weight and feels very comfortable.  I would recommend it as a reasonably priced quality product.</li>
    <li> I wish I had done some more research before buying this product and its daytime counterpart. I, like others, have sensitive skin, and this product made me break out like crazy. I didn&#x27;t just break out with regular white heads either. I broke out with blind pimples (the deep ones under the skin). It was really painful. This cream clogged my pores big time. I would love to say it was just bad skin care on my part, but I take serious care of my skin. I wash it twice a day and make sure to use only the best products and organic make ups on my skin. If you have sensitive skin, don&#x27;t use this product.</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin, and I&#x27;m not really sure how I like this product yet. It is very perfume-y and every time I apply it I sort of feel like my skin is reacting to it a tiny bit. I haven&#x27;t really broken out or anything from it, but it doesn&#x27;t seem very hypo allergenic. I&#x27;m going to keep giving it a try, but right now I&#x27;m not too sure I like it.</li>
    <li> I recognize that this product is made primarily for and definitely marketed to women. HOWEVER (hear me out here), as a guy in his late 20s who is beginning to notice the appearance of lines around the eyes and on the forehead, Revitalift Night Cream knows no gender.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started using this earlier this year and noticed a marked difference in the lines on the side of my face. I use this in conjunction with the Revitalift eye cream every night before bed and since using it, my skin feels healthier overall and helps to make me look less tired in the morning. The price on this is pretty decent, and significantly cheaper on Amazon than the Walgreens and Rite Aid by my house, even when it&#x27;s on sale.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This also has a nice, non-greasy cold cream consistency to it. Rubs right in, even over facial hair, and doesn&#x27;t feel at all sticky or oily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I&#x27;m wearing this stuff at night, no one knows about it (I supposed except for you, dear reader), but I&#x27;m here to tell you all: skin care isn&#x27;t just for the ladies. I wish more skin care companies would start marketing more towards men with products like this since we have just as much weird skin stuff as the ladies and we don&#x27;t need some stigma attached to wanting healthy looking skin!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used various night creams, but have settled on this, and am very happy.  Not too thick so that it makes your face feel like it&#x27;s got a mask on, but definitely thick enough for last through the night and I awake with my face feeling very soft.</li>
    <li> makes my skin red, makes my skin look worse..does nothing at all people..trust me..its terrible cream..look at other brand creams</li>
    <li> If you like the very strong smell of rose, then you might like this product.  The perfumy smell is overwhelming.  I don&#x27;t like the texture either. Its like cold cream..same texture as Noxema original. Kinda greasy too. Not for me.</li>
    <li> This night cream is an excellent moisturizer, and I would recommend this product to anyone looking for softer looking skin!!  Thank you.</li>
    <li> A wonderful moisturizer that I have used for about a year now. It seems to work as well as anything else I have ever used for keeping the wrinkles at bay and helping my skin look revitalized. Of course nothing can beat a good nights sleep and plenty of water, but I am happy with this product and will keep buying it.</li>
    <li> I started using RevitaLift Night Cream about a month ago and have been told by TWO different people that I look younger. With that kind of feedback, of course I love this cream!</li>
    <li> I love this cream! I have faithfully used this cream for several years now and never had an issue. It is thicker yet goes on smooth. It has a light, simple scent. It works wonders in the dry Colorado climate. Not to mention, it does not break the bank like so many other options.</li>
    <li> I like it, but can only use it on my neck, this cream is not for people with sensitive skin.  My forehead, chin and hairline broke out.  Neck area seems to be fine.</li>
    <li> Great product and delivery!</li>
    <li> This cream is great.  I have older, sensitive skin, and this cream blends in quickly and easily.</li>
    <li> I have used this for several years and have had many comments on how good my skin looks!  I also use the day cream.</li>
    <li> Worth the money, I have been using it for 6 months and I do not need to wear makeup to cover my dark circles.</li>
    <li> Works well, non greasy, no breakouts</li>
    <li> used this product for some wrinkles around my eyes. It really improved my skin. Wrinkles are not gone but visibly reduced!  great cream, only negative is the added fragrance, it&#x27;s not a deal breaker but why add it?</li>
    <li> I have use this moisturizer for quite a few months now and it is very good.  I put it on twice a day.</li>
    <li> Nice Night Cream Just What I Wanted</li>
    <li> Can see a difference after about a week or two. Help to reduce the apperance of fine lines I have around eyes, nose, chin, etc. VERY Good. Very effective. Highly recommend. I bought this, as I&#x27;d seen a show on TV where a Dermatologist was recommending certain products that have the same equal effectiveness as some of the products that are used in her office Facial Spa Treatments. The Dr said this is EXACTLY as effective as what they use in the Facial Spa and it much much lower in price! Worth it!</li>
    <li> I was always skeptical about anti-wrinkle creams. This product changed my view on the matter. After one week of using the cream I noticed definite reduction of fine lines around my eyes. It is quite thick so I think it will last longer than others. It spreads well however and the scent is subtle. I will definitely buy more.</li>
    <li> This product performed as claimed on package. Immediately my face had a \\&quot;glow\\&quot; and my face and my neck flesh has been plumping up and looking younger the longer I&#x27;ve used it. The smell others have mentioned does not bother me. After I&#x27;d been using it for a month a friend was complaining about her \\&quot;wattles\\&quot; so I told her about this and she is very pleased now (2 months later) with how her throat looks.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been a Clinique girl for many years, until my local store went out of business.  After trying several other brands, I landed on the L&#x27;Oreal RevitaLift cream.  I love it!  First of all, it does not have much of a fragrance. I have sensitive skin and this has never irritated my face. It&#x27;s a thick cream that really does seem to keep my face moisturized well into the next morning (I apply it at night).  I&#x27;m not certain of its wrinkle-fighting potential as I just hit 30, but based on the hydration, I imagine it would work very well to smooth out wrinkles. Hopefully it will hold mine at bay a while longer!&lt;br /&gt;Amazon&#x27;s price is actually a little less than buying this locally, which I also love.  One jar lasts me about 30 days, so it&#x27;s a great value as well.&lt;br /&gt;Overall, highly recommended.</li>
    <li> As I said about the day cream.  I have decided to use this product as my one and only night cream because of the wonderful smoothness I feel on my face when I use it and still in the morning.</li>
    <li> I love this product as a moisturizer.  The scent is pleasant and not too strong (although it is significant), and it does not feel greasy.  It makes my skin very soft and has not caused any breakouts (which I am prone to with some moisturizers).  I use it on my face and neck and have noticed some slight firming of the skin, especially on my neck.  I have been using tjis for about 3 months and I am very pleased with this product, especially for the price compared to others I have tried.</li>
    <li> Been using this cream for a couple of years. I like it. I think it works well. I always get people telling me i look younger than my age, of course i usually add a couple of years to my age. It really makes you appear younger lol!!!</li>
    <li> I was already using L&#x27;Oreal Paris Advaced RevitaLift Day Cream which I really like.  It has sunscreen built right into the cream.  So I tried the night cream and it fills the bill.  It has a cooling feeling when applied.  Relaxes your face muscles and invites sleep.</li>
    <li> I got this for my mom, she liked it so much she asked for another one.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s good,I like this.</li>
    <li> Love this lotion! Great price!</li>
    <li> best price and good for me</li>
    <li> This product has a good smell, and the effect must be used for a long time.</li>
    <li> get compliments after using for a while, it helps me, i am 61, use it on my face during the day and sometimes in the evening..i will order again as needed.</li>
    <li> I love this product. I&#x27;m still lung, but want to keep my skin in good condition. This cream absorbs nicely. My skin feels healthy. Not oily, not dry. I don&#x27;t have much wrinkling yet but I&#x27;ve noticed it has tightened the skin on my neck.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t recommend to buy from this seller since the cream was old. I can tell from the smell.  I was afraid to use it, so I went to buy a new one fro target.</li>
    <li> This is great for the price.  I love that it makes my face feel truly moisturized and hydrated.  I recommend it.</li>
    <li> I like it. I&#x27;m 38 and it&#x27;s really works. It&#x27;s soft and quite effective. I recommend it to everybody&lt;br /&gt;Good luck</li>
    <li> Great product. Offers good moisture.</li>
    <li> I have been using it for almost 2 weeks now.......initially my skin was breaking out too much but then it could be due to several other reasons too......I want to try it for a month now before I can conclude if it works for me!</li>
    <li> Very slightly gritty. I did not like the feel of it at all.</li>
    <li> I chose this rating because I do like it but I haven&#x27;t seen results yet because it&#x27;s just my 2nd day using it.. Hopefully i will see results but I do think there will be results that I will love. I would recommend this to family and friends</li>
    <li> The night cream works well, I used it with the day firming anti wrinkle cream. I think both would work best if put together with a moisture cream that feels silky.</li>
    <li> Very nice product with good price.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 34 and in the last couple of years have gotten crows feet around my eyes. After using this product for a couple of weeks, I hardly see the crows feet anymore. A friend even asked me what I use on my skin the other day. Nobody ever says that to me, so I think that speaks volumes for this cream!</li>
    <li> I bout this at CVS 3 days ago, along with the day time cream also.  Tonight was the 3rd night using it.  I had many fine wrinkles around my eyes and on my forehead.  I&#x27;m 39 btw.  I just looked in the mirror, and the wrinkles are not as deep as on day 1.  I&#x27;ll update after a few weeks.</li>
    <li> i switch off-- la mer, dermatologist recommendations, etc.  this is my &#x27;go-to&#x27; night-time moisturizer.  it is easy to apply.  my skin feels hydrated.&lt;br /&gt;  this is a great product for the $$.&lt;br /&gt;i have used it for 2 years.  no complaints, really.  it is good (to me) for hydration.  period.  it will not help in other ways.  no pore minimization, no dark spot removal.  it does exactly what it should.&lt;br /&gt;  absorbs quickly.  &amp; u can tell in the morning that your face is fresher, moist.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for years and this is my first time getting it from Amazon. The price was hard to beat and I order again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for years.  I&#x27;ll be 65 this summer, and no wrinkles anywhere yet.  I use retinol sunblock during the daytime too.  Revitalift doesn&#x27;t bother my eyes at all.  I put it on my eyelids and my neck as well as my face.</li>
    <li> Nice, rich cream that is not oily.  I&#x27;m getting older so don&#x27;t know how many more wrinkles I&#x27;d have without using this cream (but don&#x27;t want to chance it!).  Smells fine &amp; is absorbed quickly.</li>
    <li> Well another great L&#x27;Oreal product for age fighting. I purchased this product based on reviews and I use it every night. It keeps my skin smooth including my neck which has become a problem area as I have aged. I recommend this product to be used at night to fight fine lines and wrinkles.</li>
    <li> Non comenogenic, will not clog pores, absorbs well and leaves your skin feeling wonderful in the morning. I don&#x27;t recommend using around the eyes as it is heavy, night creams generally are, and can build up in the delicate tissue so use a eye gel in that area instead.</li>
    <li> I was hoping this was similar to the Lancome antiaging cream, but it just isn&#x27;t.  It is a nice, easily spreadable consistency, and if a nice moisturizer is all you need, this one is fine.  But if it is an antiaging cream you are looking for, I would not recommend this one.  At least it didn&#x27;t really do anything for me, and I would not buy it again.</li>
    <li> My face feels so smooth and soft since I started using this at night. I&#x27;m glad I bought it and will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a quality and affordable night cream that would moisturize my face, without upsetting my sensitive skin. If it also made me appear more rested, then that was a bonus, so I gave this stuff a try&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not sure how much reduction of fine lines it does, but my skin is well hydrated by my using it, which makes my skin look healthier. I have sensitive skin that burns/itches/freaks out easily, and this cream didn&#x27;t bother it one bit. I don&#x27;t put it on super thick, and it has a very light, nice fragrance (I don&#x27;t normally like fragrances, so if I say it&#x27;s nice and light, it&#x27;s really light).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t make my face feel greasy and my skin looks great. I&#x27;d recommend it and the price on here was a lot cheaper than Walgreens.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t say I was not satisfied but it wasn&#x27;t really what I expected either. Although it&#x27;s a good moisturizer, to call it a revitalizing lift is a bit of a stretch. However, it does make your skin feel hydrated and calm. All in all, a good product.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for well over a year and really love it!  Spreads easily over face and neck, non greasy, and my skin looks great in the morning.  That&#x27;s saying a lot for my 68 year old skin.  Would definitely recommend this product to anyone,</li>
    <li> I like the texture of this product and I like the smell, not sure if it has made me look years younger yet.</li>
    <li> Many years ago I read an article in a magazine that said that if a woman wanted to keep from getting crepey skin on her neck, she should use one of several products.  I decided to try the least expensive product: L&#x27;Oreal Advanced RevitaLift Night Cream (not Day/Night Cream).  I have been using this night cream almost every night for a long time.  Guess what?  At the age of 75 the skin on my neck isn&#x27;t crepey.  Good genes?  Maybe!  Good night cream?  Definitely!  (and yes, that is how you spell the word crepey.  I looked it up.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PS  I have purchased this cream from Amazon and haven&#x27;t experienced any problems with it.</li>
    <li> This is my staple. I stand by the night cream even more than my Oil of Olay. You can see the difference in the morning. It does reduce the lines and wrinkles. I&#x27;m never without it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 51 and my health is very important to me.  That includes my vanity.  :)  Hey, never seen anyone say they want to look like a prune.  I only use two other skin products and they are from Derma-e and Body Merry.  Generally because they don&#x27;t contain a lot of chemical goo and they work.  But I do use this exclusively on my neck even though the ingredient list isn&#x27;t fun to read.  I might dry Body Merry&#x27;s neck product at some point but this is literally magic in a jar.  I usually buy it for about $17 at the local store but today it was less than $10 on Amazon so I scooped it up.  I would recommend this product wholeheartedly.  I&#x27;ve actually tried two Perricone products and it&#x27;s as much marketing and gimmicks as anything else.  The top drug store products have the same ingredients and work just as good for 10-20% of the high-end department store products.  This product works wonders.  Period!</li>
    <li> AMAZING NIGHT TIME CEAM</li>
    <li> I saw the ad on TV. I can feel it working the min I put in on.It does&#x27;t feel heavy on my skin.I gave it a 5 star.I think, it is a very very good product.I would recomend to my friends.</li>
    <li> Wife likes it.  Nuff said.</li>
    <li> Works, however, in the morning my skin feels a little oily</li>
    <li> This moisturizer has a fairly thick consistency, yet does not feel heavy when applied.  It keeps my skin feeling hydrated at night.</li>
    <li> after using this product for 2 weeks now, I do see a difference.  Very good product for my face and neck.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the best damn night cream for under 20 bucks. Super hydrating and helps me look fresh every day.</li>
    <li> This is the best cream I&#x27;ve ever used.  Even after one week I could tell a difference in my skin.  It was smoother and softer.  It does have a light fragrance but it&#x27;s not over powering at all.  The longer I&#x27;ve used it the better my skin looks.  It makes your skin feel silky smooth after you apply it.  If your face feels greasy it&#x27;s because you&#x27;ve applied too much.  Just a little bit goes a long way.  I also apply it to the tops of my hands at night and they also look smoother and younger.  I have sensitive skin and this does not irritate it at all.  However, I can only speak for myself as I&#x27;ve used other products for sensitive skin and they were very irritating to me.  The price is good and it works.  I couldn&#x27;t ask for anything more.</li>
    <li> Saw it rated one of the best on GMA, when they were comparing products, and have not been disappointed.  I would recommend trying it</li>
    <li> It is a wonderful product on my aging skin.  Have used it for years and won&#x27;t switch.  cf</li>
    <li> I have used 3 jars of this and like it very well but now I have tried Pond&#x27;s anti wrinkle cream (cheaper) and think I like it better.</li>
    <li> I bought this product for my wife and 90-year old grandmother and both have thus far been extremely satisfied. Thank you!</li>
    <li> feel disappoint of the cream. I bought for my aunt and she review this was not the real L&#x27;oreal . AND PACKING DAMAGE OUT OF SHAPE</li>
    <li> I bought it for my mom, she loves it!</li>
    <li> It Is everithing OK. Tks</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years to keep my skin moist and soft after exfoliation.</li>
    <li> i have ordered this cream twice from amazon, as i have used it for years from drugstores.  thinking the first time was an anomaly, i tried twice, but i had the same experience.....this is not the same cream from a store.  i believe it to be a fake/knockoff.  the thickness is different, less creamy, and it is not up to par.  i would not recommend purchasing, and would stick to a store.</li>
    <li> This product works well for me.</li>
    <li> it has way too much perfume.  It&#x27;s too strong and I find it overbearing. Gives me a headache.  If strong scents don&#x27;t bother you I guess it would be nice.  I won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m just trying how it works. So far so good. My skin is very sensitive and very dry. Not many creams work for me. But this cream is working. It does moisturize well. My skin gets silky and smooth. Happy with the result. Even with a short time of using it.</li>
    <li> This cream smells great!</li>
    <li> A very nice and promising product. Just as advertised. Good job.</li>
    <li> I was using Olay Regenerist Night Cream, but it was out of stock when I ran out so I gave this a shot.  I have used it for about 5 months now and can tell a difference when I don&#x27;t use it for a few days in a row (which is pretty much only when I travel).  I&#x27;m 28 so I don&#x27;t have a ton of wrinkles (hoping to prevent them!) but my skin looks more elastic and glowy when I do use it.  I wouldn&#x27;t say it does anything to magical though.  I don&#x27;t like it *quite as much* as Olay but it&#x27;s a great product overall.  Not crazy about the scent, but that&#x27;s pretty standard with all night creams.</li>
    <li> I REALLLLY like this stuff.  I can&#x27;t take strong fragrances but I love this, it&#x27;s a little like mild Pond&#x27;s cold cream!  Yum.  I had been using Oil of Olay Renegerist night cream (love that they made an unscented one now)  for many years and it was nice, but I wanted to see some difference in my now 52 year old face (though I am lucky to have good skin and look 5-10 years younger).  Recently I struggle with the sagging jaw jowls (thanks, Dad) , ( ) lines around my nose,  and a few eye wrinkles.  Oh and those  &amp;#34;  lines on forehead between my eyes.  Well my normally clear face broke out like a SOB after trying Airbonne, and recently ROC did the same thing, though not as bad.  These were the worst breakouts of my whole life on chin, around mouth, everywhere really.  Was awful.  So I decided to look here and see how L&#x27;Oreal products were rated.  Lot of great reviews, and much cheaper (even in store) than Olay lines!  I could have gone with the Age Perfect selections, but that seemed a little strong scented for me (ssshhh, I opened them and smelled them all...).  So I ended up with this night cream, and the Double Lifting Face Treatment (red pump bottle  w/red gel and white cream that come out at the same time, and if you pay attention and pump slowly you can get them to come out evenly, so don&#x27;t complain because that stuff is worth every extra second it takes to do that!).  Anyway,  I use them both at night, this cream over the face treatment. Well even the first morning my face looked more youthful, plump, even, glowing, each day is better and better. I&#x27;ve only used these for 4 days and I can&#x27;t wait to apply because I can see how great it&#x27;s working!  Lines are softened, jowls are NOTICEABLY lifted up and more taut (that was my main concern), and I don&#x27;t know if it is this night cream or the Double Lifting Face Treatment pump stuff, but my neck and chest and décolletage look like real regular skin, not the skin of a chicken.  I saw that change almost IMMEDIATELY!I was going to return all of this stuff because I felt like my face was left &amp;#34;sticky&amp;#34;, and that is still true.  But my daughter pointed out that that is probably what is called &amp;#34;hydrated&amp;#34;, and,  &amp;#34;...anyway, who is gonna walk up to you and rub their hands on your face...?&amp;#34;  I read a review here that said I may be using too much, so I will try to use less and maybe I will get less sticky.  I want to highly recommend this product and even for you kinda sensitive skin and sensitive nosed people like myself, I am glad I didn&#x27;t get scared off my some of these reviews, because it turns out my face is finally flawless again, no zits, and I adore the fragrance, which is why I gave it a second chance.  Additionally, I got the Revitalift SPF 30 Day lotion, and I am returning it.  It left me way too greasy and uncomfortable.  I think I may stick to my Aveeno Positively Radiant Daily Moisturizer (SPF 15).  Just wish SPF was a little higher.  Stay out of the sun, kids...  I have fair skin and thus didn&#x27;t spend endless summers at the pool and beach (though I had my share of hideous sunburns, as there was no &amp;#34;sunblock&amp;#34; when I was a kid.)  But the result of not baking your flesh every day is that my skin and face has been saved and I am often told it still looks just like it did in high  school.  So, in the future, when the other gals in your class have deep lines and age spots on their faces and sandpaper skin and wrinkles even on their CHESTS, you will still be all glowy and young looking!  Plan ahead, and moisturize/sunscreen every day, even when you&#x27;re young!  (NECK AND CHEST TOO!  NO CHICKEN SKIN FOR YOU!)</li>
    <li> We like this product and regularly buy and use it. It sort of suits our kind of skin. Each person should figure out which is  best for their skin anyway.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this night cream for a year now and am very pleased with the results.</li>
    <li> excelent price quality</li>
    <li> Very good for dry skin</li>
    <li> The smell is strong and awful I don&#x27;t understand why they keep putting fragrance in face creams when people want natural and organic ingredients in there products.  The cream itself is thick and greasy I feel like it sits on top of my face and never absorbs even leaves a shine after I apply it.  Don&#x27;t know why anyone would give this five stars maybe because its cheap twelve dollar face cream and that&#x27;s what there basing the review on.  I give it one star because it didn&#x27;t break my face out.</li>
    <li> Definitely does not work, nice moisturizer but does not reduce wrinkles at ALL and I have extremely small barely noticeable wrinkles, so the fact that it can&#x27;t even do anything for them shows it sucks!</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t do much about what life does to change your skin texture as you get older, but this definitely is one of the better products, and is reasonably priced.  Goes on smoothly, but is thick enough to feel like you&#x27;re actually putting something on!  It&#x27;s not a magic potion but it&#x27;s got to be better than putting nothing on at night.</li>
    <li> Good product, but the product itself smells like it&#x27;s expired; there is discoloration on the top layer of the cream. I swirled it around with my finger and most of it went away. As far as performance, I&#x27;ve used it every night and it&#x27;s very moisturizing, does absorb easily, but not sure if I see really noticeable results so far. I will likely try other creams before purchasing this again.</li>
    <li> I have used this cream for a few years now and it has become my favorite by far. I also use the day creme.</li>
    <li> it is ok, but not as good as expected.</li>
    <li> smells good and moisture</li>
    <li> I use this from time to time on my face when I feel that my skin is too dry, and it&#x27;s a competent nighttime moisturizer. But one day I idly used it to moisturize my hands--and wow! This is far and away the best hand moisturizer I have ever found. My hands look and feel less rough, my cuticles are giving no more problems, and it even seems to be minimizing that callus caused by my wedding ring.  I would buy more for that use alone.</li>
    <li> Okay ladies I just bought this from Marshalls. Could have got it here cheaper! I used it for the first time last night. I immediately felt  a difference on my skin. I could tell the product was doing what it was suppose to. This morning my face feels smoother and it just has that refreshed feeling. I&#x27;m in my late thirties and I&#x27;m all about staying out of the sun and moisturizing now. Girls please stay out of the sun! If You want to have beautiful skin after your twenties then that&#x27;s my best advice.  Of course we all know about the risks of skin cancer to!  Not worth it!</li>
    <li> Without too much evaluation, because it is an international major suit, have been using it, I believe it is a good.</li>
    <li> + Is well absorbed&lt;br /&gt;+ Low price&lt;br /&gt;- Artificial flavoring</li>
    <li> This cream is pretty thick but goes on smooth I have been ordering on line because I get overwhelmed when I go to the local stores to find it on the shelves so many different types. The smell is really pleasant will keep it in my nightly regiment.</li>
    <li> For the price, this product seems reasonably effective,  but it&#x27;s efficacy is outweighed by its completely overwhelming fragrance.</li>
    <li> I was excited to receive this product with the Amazon price plus delivery.  But, my excitement faded when my skin began breaking out as though to say, no more of this!</li>
    <li> I love the way this cream feels on my skin and the way it makes it look.  BUT, I was very disappointed that I did not receive this item as pictured on eBay.  I received just the jar; the jar was not in the original package as pictured.  I contacted the seller and they basically said that&#x27;s the way they got it so that&#x27;s that.  It makes me wonder about the authenticity of the item when it&#x27;s not in its original package.</li>
    <li> This is definitely not some magical cream that is going to make you look younger over night. So those reviews that said something similar to that affect are lying. lol Overall its a good cream I guess. The smell isn&#x27;t terrible its a light scent. It goes on pretty smooth and isn&#x27;t too greasy. My skin feels smooth the next day. But in a few hours my face is dry again. So i put it on every night. I&#x27;ve been using it for a few weeks now. I don&#x27;t feel like its made my skin any better. I do have dry skin when it gets cold thats why I bought it. I wanted something good for overnight. So overall I had no problems with it. But its not amazing. It didn&#x27;t do anything different than another cheaper lotion would have.</li>
    <li> Bought this awhile ago, and it got lost in my cosmetic drawer until I rediscovered it about a week ago. When I apply it at night, I wake up in the morning with soft skin and very minimal under-eye circles-- to my surprise, I even noticed a difference the first night. Glad to have found this just before the weather turns really dry!</li>
    <li> Great cream, Do not expect miracles but it makes a nice change on the face. Smoother and fresher looking !!</li>
    <li> The cream arrived on time, together with other purchases. It was nicely packaged and in the same condition as those creams bought from a Pharmacy or a Woman&#x27;s Cosmetics department. I have used this product before so I did not have any problems or allergies with this either. Overall, its a decent purchase.</li>
    <li> Great cream, been using for a few years and works great for me, I have received many compliments on how nice my skin looks and have very few wrinkles for a 73 year old.</li>
    <li> Shipping was quick no problems w/ this order and I like Loreal face products alot they always seem to do what they say they will do and thats important to me. thanks again for the great customer service</li>
    <li> Another problem-free sale.  The item arrived in less time than expected.  It was just as it had been descibed.  Positive feelings abound.</li>
    <li> Great moisturizer makes my skin feel soft and refreshed. The scent might be a little much for some people it isn&#x27;t flowery or anything but it does have a distinct &amp;#34;lotiony&amp;#34; smell.</li>
    <li> I discarded it after using for 1 week  since it gave a horrible stale smell and too sticky to apply as a night cream. I was having doubts whether this is out-dated as it never gave a fresh fragrance as it should be with usual night re-vita creams.</li>
    <li> My wife loved it, so do I!&lt;br /&gt;L&#x27;Oreal Paris must take care and maintain the quality of this product in order to keep customer&#x27;s loyalty.&lt;br /&gt;I have same review since I bought both, day and night cream as a gift set for my lady.</li>
    <li> One thing I&#x27;ve learned over many years is that everyone&#x27;s skin is different, and no one product fits all.  And I&#x27;ve tried a lot of products.  For my skin (combination and sensitive), this night cream works well to moisturize and smooth, and helps control red blotches.  I use it on my face and neck.  It is light, not at all greasy and not heavily scented.  Why pay for perfume?</li>
    <li> I tried this instead of my usual Olay Regenerist and there is no comparison. This cream feels thick and smooth but after using a jar over the last month my skin looks dull and dehydrated. I am switching back to Olay.</li>
    <li> My favorite face cream at a price that&#x27;s better than stores!</li>
    <li> Feels great and I do think it is helping, which is what it is all about, right?!&lt;br /&gt;PG in CR</li>
    <li> I have been using it for a while now with no changes. I guess my wrinkles are too far gone.</li>
    <li> I chose this because I have used  other products from Loreal.  I would highly recommend it to friends and family.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  Keep my skin looking amazing.  Have used it for 8 years and I look younger than my friends for my age of almost 69.  Great product.</li>
    <li> It is about 2 years that I use this cream on my face, and I&#x27;m satisfied with that. It makes my face brighter and softer.</li>
    <li> Great price for a great product!</li>
    <li> didn&#x27;t like the smell.</li>
    <li> Great product under pressed makeup cover-up.  Does what it says.  Most importantly does not sting my eyes.  No harsh smell.</li>
    <li> I have oily acne prone skin. This product is not good for already oily skin. My acne got worse with just two night use.</li>
    <li> If I could use it with no smell, I might like it better. What I really want is hydration and I won&#x27;t buy this again, but it&#x27;s not awful, just not my cup of tea.</li>
    <li> I HAVE NOT TRYED IT YET AS SOON AS I TRY IT I WILL BE SURE TO RE RATE THE PRODUCT</li>
    <li> Wow my friend talked me into trying this, and I&#x27;m amazed of how much younger and the glow that has returned to my face</li>
    <li> Good product with good price. I use it every night and feel no more dry. I will buy another one soon.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff! I use on my neck too. Im only 21, but it makes a great moisturizer. Can&#x27;t use much though (makes certain parts of face break out so i just use on neck, forehead, lips, and eyes)</li>
    <li> Well, I&#x27;m okay with this.  It is a little thicker than I like in a cream and it seems that I have to use a lot to cover my face and neck.  The other products I have used, mainly L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s, are lighter and go on more easily covering my face and neck area with less.  I don&#x27;t think this works better than others I have used.  So, comparing it to other products like this, I would not prefer this over the others.</li>
    <li> I have used the product for a long time.  It is great!  I found it on Amazon for 1/2 the price and free shipping with my Prime account.  I am happy.</li>
    <li> Really helps my dry skin and smooths out wrinkles. I use it for both day and night because I&#x27;m allergic to SPF. Very good product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using day and night creams all my life.  When I was young I noticed how much younger one of my aunts looked than my others. So I looked on her dresser and saw Olay.  I&#x27;ve used both Olay and L&#x27;Oreal.  L&#x27;Oreal is just as good at a better price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No-one can guess my age correctly and I&#x27;m now 55 years old.  I look much younger.  I use this cream twice a day after washing.  If your young, do your old self a favor and moisturize.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This specific cream has a good weight to it.  I use about 2 swipes of finger and gently rub on my face and neck.  Don&#x27;t know about the lifting effect, haven&#x27;t seen any of that but it&#x27;s probably just another gimmick...  who knows</li>
    <li> My wife loves this product. She didn&#x27;t break out or anything. Her skin looks and feels better. She also uses the day time one as well. I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Very good product, but the scent could be much better.  One jar that I purchased actually smelled a little sour/old.</li>
    <li> muy bueno el producto y llego a tiempo, muy responsable el vendedor, me gusta el producto, sin más que decir</li>
    <li> I love this product as I have sensitive skin and cannot use many of the products sold today.  And it helps with the wrinkles!</li>
    <li> My grocery store and local Walgreens has stopped buying the night cream, but even if they did, at the store it&#x27;s 23.00 a jar, it&#x27;s a fraction of the price here, so i get all my L&#x27;Oreal cremes at Amazon. Even if you have to pay shipping, it still kills considering what i was paying for it. Win-Win</li>
    <li> Works great! Would absolutely recommend to anyone. I&#x27;ve been using this product for years. Worth the money for this product.</li>

    <li> I use this every night, it seems to be doing a very good job.  I&#x27;ve noticed less small wrinkles and a little goes a very long way.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great for my skin.</li>
    <li> Have had many comments that I look ten years younger.</li>
