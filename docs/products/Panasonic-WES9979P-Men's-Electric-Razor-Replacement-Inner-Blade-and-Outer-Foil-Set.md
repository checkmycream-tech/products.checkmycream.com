      <li>My only hope is that there is discount on these packages then I would buy more...</li>
      <li>Thanks, and I would recommend this product to anybody.</li>
      <li>I have used a number of these, and I get a very close shave each time.  </li>
      <li>My face is baby soft!!!</li>
      <li>Some viewers stated that they thought the outer foil looked different from the original</li>
      <li>The foil was a different color than the original.  </li>
      <li>I highly recomment the Razor</li>
      <li>Made like old shaver like new!!</li>
      <li>Now it&#x27;s just soft stainless steel.  </li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t help but laugh at people who buy those $100 shavers when this was only $30.00 new.</li>
      <li>Thought about replacing it, but decided to try new foil and blades.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Works like new</li>
      <li>The new parts will make the shaver work like new.</li>
      <li>Performed like new.  </li>
      <li>My shaver is now just like new with the replacement.</li>
      <li>After one year&#x27;s use, decided it was time to order new blade/screen.  </li>
      <li>Item received as shown in figure with origin of fabrication and very clear steps for installation.</li>

      <li>I&#x27;ve had the razor for several years and thins is the first time I&#x27;ve replaced the blades and the screen.</li>

      <li>I&#x27;ve tried higher end razors but the lower end panasonic single blade razors seem to get the closest shave for me.</li>
      <li>Product was exactly like as I expected.</li>
      <li>what I had to replace an is exactly the quality I expected.</li>
      <li>This package contaied everything I needed to put my shaver back to like new working condition.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Fits my shaver exactly as advertised and I only wish I had bought this months ago.</li>
    <li> Grandpa loved it great gift great awesome fits</li>
    <li> This head works for both my battery powered travel razor and my home use \\&quot;shower\\&quot; razor.  Simplifies purchases and storage of replacements.  Good quality and lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> Easy to install and renewed my razor. I would suggest not removing the foil from your razor head until after you lay out this foil to match the install. Push in from the bottom and it should lock into place with the 4 tab holes.</li>
    <li> Perfect! Matches my item perfectly. Gives close shave every-time!</li>
    <li> I keep my shaver fairly clean but I noticed it wasn&#x27;t shaving too close.  After one year&#x27;s use, decided it was time to order new blade/screen.  Well, needless to say, after installing the new blade/screen, the shaver was shaving as good as new!  Probably need to replace the blades/screen every 6 to 12 months.</li>
    <li> This is a great product, made to fit my battery powered shaver. I bought this package as a spare for when I need to change the foil and blade. It avoids being in the middle of a shave and having the blade and foil go bad, then not having a replacement on hand. Better to have a spare waiting when you need it.</li>
    <li> My dad, who has Alz, can still shave with this razor. Works well and is easy to use, price is right.</li>
    <li> What can I say, It replaced the original screen and blade. Works well.</li>
    <li> The part arrived quickly and fit perfectly. This Panasonic electric razor is one of the best I&#x27;ve had, and I have a very coarse beard.</li>
    <li> Easy to install, and beats having to buy a new razor. Works like new</li>
    <li> Product was exactly like as I expected. It fit perfect. Thanks, and I would recommend this product to anybody. Morgan</li>
    <li> Product works perfect. I&#x27;ve had my electric razor for @ 3 years &amp; try to replace these parts about every year. Great way to extend your razor&#x27;s life. Thanks for making my life a little easier!</li>
    <li> I puchased it for a spare replacement Shaver Foil and Blade Set for a Panasonic wet/dry Shaver  Model No. ES-SA40, which is one of the best mens Shaver I have ever used.  I highly recomment the Razor and I have not as yet had to use the Repacement Foil and Blade, but suspect they are the same quaulity.</li>
    <li> I bought this shaver for my teenage son who has just begun shaving and it works great. It is easy to use and clean.</li>
    <li> The shaver screen and blades were quick and easy to swap-out, and seemed to make a nice difference, though, in retrospect, I&#x27;m not sure it was time yet.  But it had been three years or more for the original parts.  Good parts, I guess!</li>
    <li> couldn&#x27;t use the screen - only the head.  the screen was horribly painful to use - went back to my old one combined with the new head</li>
    <li> Price, replacement blade and foil combo for, among others, Panasonic ES3831K shaver:  $18.18.&lt;br /&gt;Price, new Panasonic ES3831K shaver, which of course contains not only foil and cutter, but body, battery cover, cap, etc:  $13.77.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Instead of buying shaver plus replacement components, I&#x27;m buying two new shavers.  Too bad that when the first one gets dull it&#x27;ll just sit there, but I&#x27;ll be money ahead.</li>
    <li> i have had this machine for 2 years now and i change the blades every year. amazon didn&#x27;t carry the replacement before but now they do. they are a bit expensive here but what can you do.</li>
    <li> Works fine, but doesn&#x27;t seem as sharp as the last set I bought.  Will buy again though.  Would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Another great product by Panasonic...the foil and blade go a long time and even w/shaving my head they are unbeatable...the subscriber order shipping system Amazon uses is an excellent deal and very prompt.</li>
    <li> This is a great razor and probably the 5th or 6th one I have owned over the years. But, they are VERY hard to find.</li>
    <li> Perfect quality, reliability and durability. Item received as shown in figure with origin of fabrication and very clear steps for installation.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this foil/blade set for my Panasonic razor for 15+ years. I&#x27;ve tried higher end razors but the lower end panasonic single blade razors seem to get the closest shave for me. Unfortunately, it is impossible to get new razors (not sure if Panasonic discontinued but nobody sells them anymore), so I continue to buy the foil/blade set. Can&#x27;t beat it. I buy them three at a time to cover me for the year.</li>
    <li> Great. I also get my replacements from Amazon.</li>
    <li> My 15 year old Panasonic needed help! Thought about replacing it, but decided to try new foil and blades.&lt;br /&gt;I was very happy I did.  Smooth as silk.  Performed like new.  Very happy with replacement parts.</li>
    <li> My shaver is now just like new with the replacement. I was considering just buying another shaver but this worked out better and saved me money.</li>
    <li> The foil was a different color than the original.  Seemed like it may be a different alloy. So far (five shaves) it works well. Time will tell. The cutter looked exactly the same as the original.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nov 2012 update&lt;br /&gt;Replacement blade/foil combo getting dull after about 200 shaves. Disappointing. Original foil lasted longer. Replacement had a peculiar copper tint. Original foil did not look like that.</li>
    <li> Hmmmm.  Panasonic replacement blade/foil set (WES 9979P) costs more than the Panasonic shaver (ES3831K).  I&#x27;ve always wondered why.  I ordered a blade/foil set.  It came today.  Package for the blade/foil set says &amp;#34;Made in Japan&amp;#34; while the shavers always say &amp;#34;Made in China&amp;#34;.  Maybe that accounts for the price difference?  Maybe there&#x27;s also a noticeable quality difference?  We shall see.</li>
    <li> Great product.  The parts arrived perfectly.  I recommend the seller.</li>
    <li> I damaged the screen a couple of years ago but, as most people reading this know, it is a fantastic electric shaver. I can&#x27;t help but laugh at people who buy those $100 shavers when this was only $30.00 new.</li>
    <li> Works well if you are interested in just trimming and not a close shave. Disappointed that blade doesn&#x27;t work better around neck.</li>
    <li> this replacement screen and cutter are good but i notice that i don&#x27;t get quite as close a shave as with the original</li>
    <li> Muy bueno funciona todo bien encaja bien justo lo que buscaba y un buen precio ya todo bien con mi afeitadora</li>
    <li> Made like old shaver like new!! My face is baby soft!!! Well worth the money if your shaver is still working.</li>
    <li> Bought to replace my warn out one and it fits and works perfectly. I love this razor and with these replacement parts it should last for quite a while.</li>
    <li> Just what my husband wanted, so he is a happy camper.</li>
    <li> these replacementr items are working as expected.</li>
    <li> These are what you want for a great price. Avoid &amp;#34;Factory Warranty Center that claims to be affiliated with Panasonic. They over charge and send the wrong item then make it not make any monetary sense to send it back. Stick with Amazon. thought because the razor was discontinued that I was done. I looked again and scrolled down to see this item was available.</li>
    <li> i bought this for my \\&quot;back-up\\&quot; shaver when i bent the screen on it (ouch).  seems to work fine.  only problem i have is with the price, it&#x27;s almost as expensive as buying the whole shaver new (i buy at fry&#x27;s electronics in-store, when they go on sale)</li>
    <li> Because it is.  I get a smooth shave with anew set (everyone should remember that)great, great, great, great and great!</li>
    <li> priced reasonable and is what I expected. You get the replacement foil and blade at a good price. Very pleased</li>
    <li> It is a perfect replacement for the original foil and blade. The new parts will make the shaver work like new.</li>
    <li> For users of the appropriate Panasonic electric shaver, you can&#x27;t go wrong with this set.  I have used a number of these, and I get a very close shave each time.  In fact, I use the blade with a Panasonic portable, battery-operated shaver, and it works perfectly for me.  Oh, I forgot to mention:  I have a stubborn beard, and sensitive skin.  I use LectricShave as my preshave lotion, then shave.  Once my aftershave lotion is applied, my face and neck feel nice and smooth, with no blade burn.  I heartily recommend this blade set.</li>
    <li> works great, didn&#x27;t know my old one was that dull.</li>
    <li> Good product as expected. My only hope is that there is discount on these packages then I would buy more...</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s as dull as the used foil I replaced.  I&#x27;m returning.  The foil used to be nitride coated or something.  Now it&#x27;s just soft stainless steel.  I&#x27;m not sure that&#x27;s the issue but it&#x27;s certainly not like it used to be.</li>
    <li> This package contaied everything I needed to put my shaver back to like new working condition. The packaging doesn&#x27;t list it but it works for my ES-SA40. Some viewers stated that they thought the outer foil looked different from the original but mine didn&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had the razor for several years and thins is the first time I&#x27;ve replaced the blades and the screen. The only reason I had to change the cutting system is that it was damaged on a recent airline trip, probably because of rough handling by baggage handlers. The new cutting system is exactly like what I had to replace an is exactly the quality I expected.</li>
