      <li>now that am using it more</li>
      <li>This is the best facial highlight!</li>
      <li>Love  it.</li>
      <li>Absolutely  love this.</li>
      <li>it gives a more grown up look.</li>
      <li>I bought this in the color Moonstone, and it looks so beautiful and natural.</li>
      <li>I can either use a light amount, which does nothing, or I can add a bit more, which leaves my skin looking cakey.  </li>
      <li>br /&gt;It worked perfectly fine came right off</li>
      <li>I have pretty light skin</li>
      <li>It does not give my skin a natural healthy glow; rather, it looks like shimmery powder caked on my face.</li>
      <li>Worth every penny.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a beautiful highlighter for above the cheek bones and the inner corner of the eye.</li>
      <li>and it goes on smoothly and looks very natural.</li>
      <li>This highlighter is very visible on the skin.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s does not have too much shimmer.</li>
      <li>The product feels very flaky and cakey.  </li>
      <li>but I much prefer this one...</li>
      <li>My product was cracked upon arrival causing it to spill and make a huge mess all over the packaging and the box it came in.</li>
      <li>From what I have read so far, this seems to be an issue with this product as I am not the only one who received a damaged product.</li>
      <li>I tried Opal first which was too dark.</li>

<li> When I received this the product was broken into little tiny pieces...</li>
<li> I usually apply it on the tops of my cheekbones, my forehead, the bridge of my nose, my cupid&#x27;s bow, and a little on my chin</li>
<li> Not very please!!!!</li>
<li> It&#x27;s a daily part of my makeup routine, and this sounds so silly</li>
<li> The packeging sucks</li>
<li> i received a box of broken powder all over the place.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
<li> Seriously, you need this in your life if you don&#x27;t have it already!</li>

    <li> I love this highlighter!! My go to</li>
    <li> Absolutely  love this. Buttery, creamy, and perfect for my light skin tone. I tried Opal first which was too dark. But moonstone is just perfect.</li>
    <li> This is a legit product. The shimmer is soooooo beautiful did not come cracked or apart. So glad I chose Amazon instead of Sephora Such a great highlighter!</li>
    <li> The packeging sucks i received a box of broken powder all over the place.&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t even try it on anymore its all over the mailbox from inside.&lt;br /&gt;I would rate it less than a star if there was such a thing!</li>
    <li> This. Is. The. Best. Highlighter. EVER. I seriously don&#x27;t think I ever need to buy another one again, unless it&#x27;s a different color of BECCA. I bought this in the color Moonstone, and it looks so beautiful and natural. I have pretty light skin but I think it would go well with tanner folks too. It&#x27;s a daily part of my makeup routine, and this sounds so silly but I get excited every time I&#x27;m putting it on because it just looks so gorgeous - like I&#x27;m glowing from within. I usually apply it on the tops of my cheekbones, my forehead, the bridge of my nose, my cupid&#x27;s bow, and a little on my chin (I like the dewy look). I get compliments all the time and am always happy to recommend the product to my friends. Seriously, you need this in your life if you don&#x27;t have it already!</li>
    <li> I am so sad when I first got it&lt;br /&gt;It worked perfectly fine came right off&lt;br /&gt;And now that am using it more I notice that I pick up less and less product</li>
    <li> Great and worked as described.</li>
    <li> The product feels very flaky and cakey.  My other highlighter is a cream and it goes on smoothly and looks very natural. This highlighter is very visible on the skin. It does not give my skin a natural healthy glow; rather, it looks like shimmery powder caked on my face. I can either use a light amount, which does nothing, or I can add a bit more, which leaves my skin looking cakey.  I will definitely go back to my cream highlighter.</li>
    <li> Love  it. So shimmery</li>
    <li> This is the best facial highlight! I love it.</li>
    <li> Very good and on time</li>
    <li> My product was cracked upon arrival causing it to spill and make a huge mess all over the packaging and the box it came in. From what I have read so far, this seems to be an issue with this product as I am not the only one who received a damaged product.</li>
    <li> This is the best highlighter I have found. I receive compliments all the time now! Worth every penny. Moonstone is a good color for all skin tones.</li>
    <li> When I received this the product was broken into little tiny pieces... Not very please!!!!</li>
    <li> This is an amazing day time and night time highlighter. I add day time bc  it&#x27;s does not have too much shimmer. And I love the texture!</li>
    <li> I love all Becca products and tje Shimmering Skin Perfector in Moonstone didn&#x27;t disappoint. It&#x27;s a beautiful highlighter for above the cheek bones and the inner corner of the eye. I now want all the colors!</li>
    <li> Excellent Amazon seller/. Great product.</li>
    <li> I only have one other highlighter which is by Mac but I much prefer this one...it gives a more grown up look. Theres no glitter in it and it gives a nice finish. I see they have released this in liquid form so I may try that soon</li>
