      <li>They are so handy to have around</li>

      <li>And so far so good!!</li>

      <li>These are comfortable and leaves my mind worry free!</li>
      <li>Easy to handle and easy to apply.  </li>
      <li>Easy to put on and remove</li>
      <li>They fit snugly and are easy to put on and remove.  </li>
      <li>and I love that they are clear!</li>
      <li>Exactly what I wanted!</li>
      <li>Worth a try for a buck though.</li>
      <li>These bullet clutch safety backs work very well on earrings............</li>
      <li>They slide off the earring wire far too easily, so they barely helped keep my earrings on at all.</li>
      <li>these would be okay, but they don&#x27;t work well on typical earrings.</li>
      <li>They do not pinch your ears and are very soft.  </li>
      <li>I am always losing the backs of my costume jewelry and these have worked on every pair so far.</li>
      <li>The earring backings came on time and as expected, along with a cute little keychain!</li>
      <li>These feel like hard plastic instead of pliable silicone and not all of my earring wires fit into them.</li>
      <li>I always tend to lose the back of my earrings and came across these clear rubber clutch.</li>
      <li>but kind of small for clumsy fingers.</li>

    <li> I&#x27;m always running out of backs for my earrings or losing them. This was the perfect product for me and the price was awesome!</li>
    <li> Delivered promptly and these are great to use on all types of earrings.</li>
    <li> Now I won&#x27;t lose my hook earrings and I have replacements for my others!</li>
    <li> These bullet clutches are very small and at first I didn&#x27;t think they would work for the varied styles of earrings i have in my store.  They fit snugly and are easy to put on and remove.  I am pleased with this purchase.</li>
    <li> I bought these because earring backs are always getting lost.  These are an inexpensive alternative to the metal spring backs.</li>
    <li> very small and hard to get on</li>
    <li> I like that I got what I ordered just like how it was described however you can find it cheaper</li>
    <li> Exactly what I wanted! Need them for my wire drop earrings. Almost lost one of my favorites . Wearing them today!</li>
    <li> These backings are very comfortable.  They do not pinch your ears and are very soft.  I have thrown away all of my metal backings and only use these.</li>
    <li> These clutch backs are too small. I bought them to replace the backs on some of my post earrings.  They are about the same size as the clutches that come with the earrings.  I bought these because I have big fingers.  I thought they would be esier to handle they are not.  The price is so low I will not bother to return them.</li>

    <li> I threw them in the garbage. Did not fit any earings!</li>
    <li> Arrived promptly. Works on any earrings. Great purchase!!!</li>
