      <li>I&#x27;ve always loved color-changed polish, and this is beautiful.</li>
      <li>Great price, cool color and a great applicator!</li>
      <li>Like it quite a bit, but the Color Club holographic polishes are superior both for effect and durability.</li>
      <li>Easily my favorite bottle of polish!</li>
      <li>This one is great, goes on easy and with a good top coat lasts for over a week.</li>
      <li>LOVE KB Shimmer nail polish! :-)</li>
      <li>the plus side, the nail polish goes on easily, and it&#x27;s nice and shiny.&lt;br</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s basically a grape purple most of the time.</li>
      <li>Also used Seche Vite as a top coat.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Pigment of My Imagination is okay, but I was expecting something more.</li>
      <li>purchase.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I absolutely love the color.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m positively in love.</li>
      <li>I love this nail polish, the picture doesn&#x27;t do it justice.</li>
      <li>:)  </li>
      <li>I received so many people asking me what color was on my nails and where could they get it.</li>
      <li>So beautiful with indoor lighting and especially outside in the sun.</li>
      <li>Love this polish, it stayed on well and is really cool looking.</li>
      <li>The final product is smooth and looks great.</li>
      <li>I liked it so much</li>
      <li>This is a fantastic color</li>
      <li>I ordered more right away.</li>
      <li>In most light it looks either beautiful dark indigo/peacock blue or plum-toned purple, but then I move my hand and get a gorgeous flash of bronze.</li>
      <li>It looks so rich.</li>
      <li>Word of warning, stop staring at your mesmerizing nails!</li>
      <li>So pretty everybody love this color</li>
      <li>The color is true to the picture.</li>
      <li>The bottle of polish I recieved was not even a full bottle.</li>
      <li>My 2nd favorite KB Shimmer color!</li>
      <li>Love the colors but it isn&#x27;t the color I was expecting, it is more of a deeper purple than pink.  </li>
      <li>Basically, if you&#x27;re not looking at your fingernails at exactly the right angle in exactly the right lighting conditions with exactly the right colors around it, all you&#x27;re going to see is a grape purple color.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I think Tammy can get amazing results if she take a look at how others have gotten amazing results with polish with far less potential than this, very cool color.</li>
      <li>Will keep an eye out for future colors though. :)</li>
      <li>Really pretty</li>
      <li>I loved the product color and hoped to get a few uses out of it.</li>
      <li>I just did it this morning, so I don&#x27;t know long lasting it is, but so far I&#x27;m happy with the way it performed.</li>
      <li>Fast shipping.</li>
      <li>I was really looking forward to a nail polish that shimmered with a variety of colors, and I didn&#x27;t get that.</li>
      <li>It was only halve full.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s true that the yellow isn&#x27;t as visible as I wished, but there is still plenty of color shift.</li>
      <li>In rare situations it&#x27;s blue, and in even rarer situations you can sort of get it to look bronze.</li>
      <li>I thought I was buying a new product</li>
      <li>For 8.75 I expected the bottle to be full.</li>
      <li>This color is nothing like the picture---it is completely sheer---it took four coats to look like the model in the picture.  </li>
      <li>Anyone who knows X-chrome polish knows to layer them over  a quick dry smooth, not clumpy black, Then set the final dry nails with seche vite.</li>
      <li>This is an ultra-chrome which can be rare and expensive and flashes a rainbow of cyan, pink, orange and gold and in the right light a hint of green.</li>

<li> I&#x27;m sorry such a great product isn&#x27;t used as should be, and then gets poor results when used incorrectly.</li>
<li> This was my first time using anything from this company; all of the polishes (base coat, black, chrome, and topcoat) went on smoothly and dried in a reasonable amount of time (for nail polish).</li>
<li> you got frustrated, But your nails CAN stop traffic if you get the formula others have spent time learning to do to get desire amazing nails.</li>
<li> Works well with a dark base coat first and is very chip resistant.</li>
<li> so I could let my nails dry for a few minutes between coats and then for about an hour when I was done.</li>
<li> Since blue and purple are my usual everyday shades, I&#x27;d say I&#x27;m covered  </li>
<li> I&#x27;d expect five layers of polish to last a little longer, but I&#x27;ve had worse in that regard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> I hope people will not be afraid by one inexperienced and oddly inaccurate review.</li>
<li> I laid down a base coat, a thin coat of black (also KBShimmer)</li>
<li> I use a dark color for the base coat and applied two coats of this polish.</li>
<li> Tammy I&#x27;m sorry</li>
<li> I followed the instructions and applied a base coat, three coats of Pigment of My Imagination, and a shiny topcoat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> Very sad !</li>
<li> Very disappointed in amount of polish in bottle.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I bought from the company website, which is the only reason this isn&#x27;t a &amp;#34;verified purchase.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I absolutely love the color. I laid down a base coat, a thin coat of black (also KBShimmer) and then two coats of the chrome and I&#x27;m positively in love. (I also used the KBShimmer topcoat for extra shine and protection). In most light it looks either beautiful dark indigo/peacock blue or plum-toned purple, but then I move my hand and get a gorgeous flash of bronze. Since blue and purple are my usual everyday shades, I&#x27;d say I&#x27;m covered  :)  I just did it this morning, so I don&#x27;t know long lasting it is, but so far I&#x27;m happy with the way it performed. This was my first time using anything from this company; all of the polishes (base coat, black, chrome, and topcoat) went on smoothly and dried in a reasonable amount of time (for nail polish). I watched a couple of episodes of one of my shows so I could let my nails dry for a few minutes between coats and then for about an hour when I was done. The final product is smooth and looks great.</li>
    <li> This is a fantastic color</li>
    <li> They are great for women on the go. Don&#x27;t have time to change your polish often. It&#x27;s perfect. Beautiful color. Temperature changing polish.</li>
    <li> Product as described.  Great Buyer to work with.</li>
    <li> I received so many people asking me what color was on my nails and where could they get it. My neighbors thought I kept changing my nail color. This was definitely a hit.  It didn&#x27;t chip and stayed on for about a week.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping. My 2nd favorite KB Shimmer color! So beautiful with indoor lighting and especially outside in the sun. Works well with a dark base coat first and is very chip resistant. Tons of compliments. LOVE KB Shimmer nail polish! :-)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always loved color-changed polish, and this is beautiful.</li>
    <li> I love this!!! The color is true to the picture. It looks so rich.</li>
    <li> This polish is absolutely gorgeous! It&#x27;s true that the yellow isn&#x27;t as visible as I wished, but there is still plenty of color shift. Easily my favorite bottle of polish!</li>
    <li> Like it quite a bit, but the Color Club holographic polishes are superior both for effect and durability.</li>
    <li> Really pretty and I get lots of compliments.  I use a dark color for the base coat and applied two coats of this polish. Also used Seche Vite as a top coat.  Have had it on for a week with no peeling! Would definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> This color is nothing like the picture---it is completely sheer---it took four coats to look like the model in the picture.  Who has that time???</li>
    <li> I followed the instructions and applied a base coat, three coats of Pigment of My Imagination, and a shiny topcoat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the plus side, the nail polish goes on easily, and it&#x27;s nice and shiny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I was really looking forward to a nail polish that shimmered with a variety of colors, and I didn&#x27;t get that. It&#x27;s basically a grape purple most of the time. In rare situations it&#x27;s blue, and in even rarer situations you can sort of get it to look bronze. Those are all the colors. I think I might have once seen a deep magenta when I was holding my hand next to a magenta shirt. Basically, if you&#x27;re not looking at your fingernails at exactly the right angle in exactly the right lighting conditions with exactly the right colors around it, all you&#x27;re going to see is a grape purple color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The nail polish on one hand started flaking the next day, but it lasted well enough on my non-dominant hand. I&#x27;d expect five layers of polish to last a little longer, but I&#x27;ve had worse in that regard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pigment of My Imagination is okay, but I was expecting something more. I probably won&#x27;t wear it again.</li>
    <li> Love this polish, it stayed on well and is really cool looking.</li>
    <li> The bottle of polish I recieved was not even a full bottle. For 8.75 I expected the bottle to be full. Very disappointed in amount of polish in bottle. It was only halve full. I loved the product color and hoped to get a few uses out of it. I thought I was buying a new product but it sees like someone else used this product before me. Very sad !</li>
    <li> Love the colors but it isn&#x27;t the color I was expecting, it is more of a deeper purple than pink.  Will keep an eye out for future colors though. :)</li>

I think Tammy can get amazing results if she take a look at how others have gotten amazing results with polish with far less potential than this, very cool color. I hope people will not be afraid by one inexperienced and oddly inaccurate review. This is an ultra-chrome which can be rare and expensive and flashes a rainbow of cyan, pink, orange and gold and in the right light a hint of green. This rivals more expensive brands in quality and the time and effort that went into making it. Great price, cool color and a great applicator! Tammy I&#x27;m sorry you got frustrated, But your nails CAN stop traffic if you get the formula others have spent time learning to do to get desire amazing nails.</li>
    <li> I love this nail polish, the picture doesn&#x27;t do it justice. I have lots of nail polish and have been looking for a holographic color. This one is great, goes on easy and with a good top coat lasts for over a week. I liked it so much I ordered more right away. The color is just awesome. Try it ladies.</li>
    <li> It is perfect!!!  Works well, looks like it should and better!!  Word of warning, stop staring at your mesmerizing nails!</li>
    <li> So pretty everybody love this color</li>
