### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>the chrome finish is excellent .  </li>
      <li>Revlon makes great beauty products for ladies and or adults.</li>
      <li>but these will work if you like to cause yourself pain, LOL.</li>
      <li>This is a good pair of clippers.  </li>
      <li>but these work good.</li>
      <li>a good clipper don&#x27;t know why they called nipper</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s a good size.  </li>
      <li>End of good news.  </li>
      <li>Am very pleased with it</li>
      <li>OK, it arrived promptly, at a good price.</li>
      <li>The clipper curves outward, most clippers curve inward.  </li>
      <li>This toenail clipper is easy to handle</li>
      <li>Low price, great shipping.</li>
      <li>I got these primarily to do toenails which are thicker</li>
      <li>these are good and strong to cut nails and such you need</li>
      <li>However, I was hoping for something with more leverage; I really have to muscle the thing for it to cut.  </li>
      <li>the blades are really sharp and huge, it works really good, but be careful to do not cut yourself because you might do like me  :P</li>
      <li>A new pair of diagonal wire cutters worked better then these.</li>
      <li>Old one was better, but this one is sharper</li>
      <li>A better picture would have shown this clearly.  </li>
      <li>After 10 months, it broke down completely, now I&#x27;m happy to get a new and better one.</li>
      <li>I purchased a set at Wal-Mart for about the same price and these are far superior to that set.</li>
      <li>Great for thick nails.</li>
      <li>First time buying this brand.</li>
      <li>These are also good for people who have trouble reaching their toenails.</li>
      <li>So great care is needed to avoid cutting more than you want.  </li>
      <li>but was very dissapointed.  </li>
      <li>you can see light at the back of the cutter jaws.....</li>
      <li>This is a replacement for an older Revlon nipper (the spring broke).  </li>
      <li>This product is great for those toenails that are really stubborn due to thickness, fungus, or just plain old stubborn.  </li>
      <li>I ordered this expecting it to be brand new.</li>
      <li>completely satisfiecod with this purchase!</li>
      <li>The clippers are less expensive than many others but we were very pleased with these.</li>
      <li>It would cost almost the full purchase price to ship them back,  not worth the hassle.    </li>
      <li>And the cutters are not all that sharp or fine, takes a lot  of force and produces a rough cut.    </li>
      <li>I use them to cut my toenails and so far they&#x27;ve held up well but only used four times.</li>
      <li>The drawback is that it&#x27;s not very sharp at all.   </li>
      <li>Very sharp and works great on my one difficult to cut toenail.  </li>
      <li>It was ok for a short time, but never great.</li>

<li> Broke after 2 years of single person use...</li>
<li> It works no better than adequately for me, so I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for anyone who has thick or \\&quot;problem\\&quot; toenails.</li>
<li> The package was completely ripped open, dirty, and someone had wrapped the whole thing in tape.</li>
<li> cheap price for these cutters ,heavy weight tool, My only complaint is the cutter jaws are not perfectly ground .  </li>
<li> The basic form is identical to the ones I had 45 years ago, but the spring quality (to open handles) is worse.</li>
<li> the gap goes away with some slight squeeze  pressure .I</li>
<li> Six bucks wasted.</li>
<li> Pretty disappointed.</li>
<li> and if you dont have a very sharp clipper then there is a painful sharp shock when the cut is made.  </li>
<li> I found them to be very dull.  </li>

    <li> Both my husband and I can now clip our toenails without difficulty. We both have arthritis and the longer handles on the clippers make it easier for us to control the clippers. The clippers are less expensive than many others but we were very pleased with these.</li>
    <li> I got these primarily to do toenails which are thicker and if you dont have a very sharp clipper then there is a painful sharp shock when the cut is made.  I bought these specifically to prevent that but was very dissapointed.  I found them to be very dull.  A new pair of diagonal wire cutters worked better then these.</li>
    <li> First time buying this brand. I use them to cut my toenails and so far they&#x27;ve held up well but only used four times.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a quality item, no doubt about that, and it works.  However, I was hoping for something with more leverage; I really have to muscle the thing for it to cut.  Maybe I have have the world&#x27;s toughest toenails.</li>
    <li> I ordered this expecting it to be brand new. The package was completely ripped open, dirty, and someone had wrapped the whole thing in tape. Pretty disappointed.</li>
    <li> Made in India or Pakistan. The basic form is identical to the ones I had 45 years ago, but the spring quality (to open handles) is worse. Broke after 2 years of single person use... hence the reason I have backup pairs.</li>
    <li> This toenail clipper is easy to handle and it&#x27;s a good size.  The drawback is that it&#x27;s not very sharp at all.   It works no better than adequately for me, so I wouldn&#x27;t recommend it for anyone who has thick or \\&quot;problem\\&quot; toenails.</li>
    <li> Very sharp and works great on my one difficult to cut toenail.  Am very pleased with it, it does just what I needed.</li>
    <li> This is a replacement for an older Revlon nipper (the spring broke).  Old one was better, but this one is sharper</li>
    <li> Revlon makes great beauty products for ladies and or adults. This product saves you from having to visit a nail specialist.</li>
    <li> Low price, great shipping. recommended</li>
    <li> This is a good pair of clippers.  I purchased a set at Wal-Mart for about the same price and these are far superior to that set.</li>
    <li> It was ok for a short time, but never great. After 10 months, it broke down completely, now I&#x27;m happy to get a new and better one.</li>
    <li> cheap price for these cutters ,heavy weight tool, My only complaint is the cutter jaws are not perfectly ground .  you can see light at the back of the cutter jaws..... the gap goes away with some slight squeeze  pressure .I got these for an ingrown toenail (big toe) . cutter head is too big  to &amp;#34;get in there&amp;#34;. but these will work if you like to cause yourself pain, LOL. still they did do the job.&lt;br /&gt;  My guess for being  made in Pakistan this is the quality you get . the chrome finish is excellent .  for the price these cutters work and have a lifetime Revlon warranty.  I would have rated these 5 stars if the gap in the cutter head had not been there.....</li>
    <li> completely satisfiecod with this purchase!</li>
    <li> Great for thick nails.</li>
    <li> meets all expectations.</li>
    <li> these are good and strong to cut nails and such you need a good clipper don&#x27;t know why they called nipper but these work good. Sturdy will last longer.</li>
