      <li>Bright and beautiful.</li>
      <li>loved it, great color.</li>
      <li>so I&#x27;m very familiar with boxed hair color products and which ones work the best.</li>
      <li>Good to my hair.  </li>
      <li>I had waited a good 2 months before trying this color.</li>
      <li>The smell was real strong for him.</li>
      <li>I love this color!</li>
      <li>COlor is awesome and is exactly what I wanted!&lt;br</li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m very excited about this product !</li>
      <li>This dye is amazing.</li>
      <li>The color of this dye is amazing and for that reason I&#x27;ll continue to use it.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Received product fast and was very happy with it!</li>
      <li>One box gave a nice all over color.</li>
      <li>\\&quot; cool\\&quot; orange is \\&quot; warm - according to my pro colorist</li>
      <li>this is what causes buildup of \\&quot;goth\\&quot; ( purple ) or orangey ( warm) look in people)</li>
      <li>Great unique sultry look to catch a cute guy&#x27;s attention</li>
      <li>Hair feels nice, shiny and healthy after use.</li>
      <li>It does smell okay, not too perfumy or chemically, and I liked the conditioner.</li>
      <li>i give it more than 5 stars.</li>
      <li>No terrible smell or anything like that.</li>
      <li>I have been trying for years to find that perfect red, and every color I try, never is what they say on the box.</li>
      <li>love it.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yet, for chemical dye, one of my favorites for sure.</li>
      <li>I received this product free of charge as a promotional item from vidal sasoon however, my opinions are solely, my own</li>
      <li>Most reds just wash out in a couple of shampoos.</li>
      <li>i get many compliments on this color</li>
      <li>Have tried many before</li>
      <li>Love, love , love it.  </li>
      <li>Love this hair dye.</li>
      <li>but it wasn&#x27;t much better.  </li>
      <li>I have used Vidal Sassoon styling products on and off, but never till now tried their hair color, as I have been a faithful user of another top brand.</li>
      <li>and I always think how I could better spend that money!&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
      <li>and I must say that this is the most perfect red ever.  </li>
      <li>Absolutely fabulous!</li>
      <li>After applying color and letting it set for 30 minutes I rinsed it out and rinsed it out and rinsed it out some more.  </li>
      <li>Brighter than the ColorSpa that I was used to, but lovely and shiny.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I have no doubt in mind that if I didn&#x27;t leave the color in for 5 more minutes I would have ended up with orange hair.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m off now to buy some sort of hat for work until it either washes out, A LOT, or I can use some sort of brown color on top of it.</li>
      <li>To me, the box looks like a reddish brown, somewhat believable as a &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; color.</li>
      <li>The color so far is nice and bright.</li>
      <li>It smells better than this Vidal Sassoon, is cheaper by a couple of dollars, doesn&#x27;t make my head burn, and still gives a great color red from a box.</li>
      <li>I tried Vidal Sassoon&#x27;s Pro Series Hair Color, 5RR Medium Vibrant Red.&lt;br /&gt;First the good news..</li>
      <li>The smell is quite strong but tolerable.</li>
      <li>the 4 stars are because of the strong aroma.&lt;br</li>
      <li>What I liked about it is that is not overwhelmingly red since there are rules about that kind of thing at my school, like most others.</li>
      <li>Hands down the best color.  </li>
      <li>I should have done an allergy test before applying , but I have been using another haircolor without problems, so I thought it would be fine.  </li>
      <li>It will dye it quickly!</li>
      <li>I was horrified to notice that my hair fell out in a huge circle in the crown of my head.</li>
      <li>Which is fantastic if that is what you are going for, it just wasn&#x27;t for me.</li>
      <li>I used # 6 light brown</li>
      <li>then brilliant golden blonde highlights.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Rich.</li>
      <li>This is my favorite hair dye I was reluctant to try it at first because the brand is not as well- known as others like Feria or Garnier</li>
      <li>The color is a nice rich red, and it does not wash out like most reds will.  </li>
      <li>super smooth after rinsing out and using the conditioner it came with.</li>
      <li>and I would still recommend this to others with the warning not to have any special plans that do not require wearing a hat for a day or two.</li>
      <li>I would recommended it to anyone trying for bright red hair.</li>
      <li>now this is good news to me since I did not care for the final result anyway</li>
      <li>L&#x27;Oreal Preference and Excellence remain the favorites for ease of use, consistency of product, and true to description/picture color.</li>
      <li>color is true to the box and it lasts for weeks.  </li>
      <li>No bad odors&lt;</li>
      <li>Just radiant, stunning, shiny and overall beautiful red!</li>
      <li>I was mildly concerned when the color of the dye was sherbet orange, even after developing for a while</li>
      <li>Luckily I had no plans for the day and did manage to remove some colour with an alcohol pad...</li>
      <li>It is Amazing how RED this turned my hair and even after a couple weeks I still have undoubtedly bright red hair.</li>
      <li>I also use the same brand oil creme repair in jar &amp; it changed my texture from damaged to very healthy looking!!&lt;br</li>
      <li>my hair grows very fast -( have to color every 3/4 weeks!)</li>
      <li>and I liked the product in general,</li>
      <li>You don&#x27;t get a lot of product- buy one more than you would normally buy</li>
      <li>the color is still awesome (normally my reds fade a little by now).</li>
      <li>Gorgeous red, true color, high shine!</li>
      <li>I ended up dying it again a week later and was pretty happy with how it turned out, but it faded within a month (to a more natural shade, but that wasn&#x27;t really what I was going for).</li>
      <li>It is bright &amp; bold &amp; doesn&#x27;t fade brassy like some other reds do.</li>
      <li>The color has tremendous depth to it- better than most other reds I have ever used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I was impressed by the conditioner, which actually was really softening and the color came out just like the swatches indicate, a coppery-cherry red.</li>
      <li>It is an easy application and color is vibrant and lasts.</li>
      <li>It is such a gorgeous red that I wanted to be sure to let everyone know about it right away</li>
      <li>so if you gently massage your scalp after first dyeing and use gentle color safe shampoo it will come off.&lt;br</li>
      <li>let everyone know about it right away</li>
      <li>right?</li>
      <li>The smell is not bad at all, the color is perfect and on the sunlight gives a hint of reddish highlights that I love, but above all the softness it&#x27;s unbelievable, silky soft.</li>
      <li>If you can get past the smell it is a great product.</li>
      <li>vibrant rich colored</li>
      <li>(My hair was still very smooth the next day</li>
      <li>My hair grows very fast which is why I used it 6 weeks apart, but I will never buy or use this product ever again.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> i get many compliments on this color</li>
    <li> The color of this dye is amazing and for that reason I&#x27;ll continue to use it. However when I got into the shower it rinsed A LOT out within the first couple shampoos. I&#x27;ve heard that rinsing with vinegar will help the color stick so I&#x27;m going to try that next time. So we&#x27;ll see!</li>
    <li> This product burned my scalp immediately upon application.  I should have done an allergy test before applying , but I have been using another haircolor without problems, so I thought it would be fine.  Boy was I WRONG!</li>
    <li> In what seems to be an endless search for a replacement for my favourite.. now discontinued..  L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s ColorSpa I tried Vidal Sassoon&#x27;s Pro Series Hair Color, 5RR Medium Vibrant Red.&lt;br /&gt;First the good news.. the colour is great. Brighter than the ColorSpa that I was used to, but lovely and shiny.&lt;br /&gt;The bad news is that it COLOURS! It is now day 3 and it is still bleeding out. When I used it on Saturday, I spent 20 minutes trying to get it to wash clear with no success. In fear of growing gills, I gave up and wrapped my hair in a towel. When I removed the towel in front of the mirror .. I could not believe that my scalp was carrot orange!! NOT the look I was going for. Luckily I had no plans for the day and did manage to remove some colour with an alcohol pad... but no where near enough to want to leave the house.&lt;br /&gt;Sunday I washed it 3 times using different shampoos and it was somewhat better. Yesterday I washed again and was confident enough to go to work and this morning the orange is nearly gone.&lt;br /&gt;As I said.. the actual hair colour is lovely.. and I would still recommend this to others with the warning not to have any special plans that do not require wearing a hat for a day or two.</li>
    <li> Absolutely fabulous! This is a great product and the color is beautiful. Would highly recommend. It is an easy application and color is vibrant and lasts.</li>
    <li> I left the dye on for the maximum recommended time, and it still wasn&#x27;t as bright as I expected it to be. I ended up dying it again a week later and was pretty happy with how it turned out, but it faded within a month (to a more natural shade, but that wasn&#x27;t really what I was going for).</li>
    <li> I have been coloring my hair at home off &amp; on for 20 years- normally what happens is it builds up ( yes I do the roots but it seems to slide done anyway!) I end up going to a salon bc my hair starts looking goth! They have to strip it down finally bc my hair grows very fast -( have to color every 3/4 weeks!) I get tired of making appointments , waiting forever, etcetera go back to doing it at home again!  it costs 70-160 each time plus tips and I always think how I could better spend that money!&lt;br /&gt;Well this product does cover my stubborn gray ( read some reviews but I suggest leaving it on twice the time on instructions if u have gray!!) it looks very natural bc it isn&#x27;t purple based or orange based ( purple is \\&quot; cool\\&quot; orange is \\&quot; warm - according to my pro colorist this is what causes buildup of \\&quot;goth\\&quot; ( purple ) or orangey ( warm) look in people) I used # 6 light brown and it&#x27;s PERFECT! It comes out a med brown exactly like my natural color!! I still get professional highlights ( foils ) but I do not have to pay the 70-100 for base color now!! The foam helps keep it just on new growth!&lt;br /&gt;Btw , a very good colorist I used out of town ( ST Louis executive salon- Betty) showed me a great trick to get shine - put 2 pumps of moroccon oil (the blue/ orange brand!,) in your color as you&#x27;re mixing it ! It&#x27;s difficult w foam but I put mine in a bowl w a pump ( dime sized) mix it and then put it on! - I also use the same brand oil creme repair in jar &amp; it changed my texture from damaged to very healthy looking!!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very excited about this product !</li>
    <li> Gorgeous red, true color, high shine!</li>
    <li> I love this color! It is bright &amp; bold &amp; doesn&#x27;t fade brassy like some other reds do. Be careful of any skin contact though! It will dye it quickly!</li>
    <li> I got this product fro free from Vidal Sasson through Bzzagent to try it Very easy to use, no mess application which is suprising for a vibrant red hair colour. Hair feels nice, shiny and healthy after use. The only thing I didn&#x27;t like as much is the colour. It didn&#x27;t come out as vibrant as I expected it. Overall it is a 4 star product.</li>
    <li> I have been using boxed dyes on myself and others for over 25 years and have only been extremely disappointed in the results twice, and this is one of them. L&#x27;Oreal Preference and Excellence remain the favorites for ease of use, consistency of product, and true to description/picture color. I expected a true vibrant red from Vidal Sassoon 5RR Vibrant Red and got electric ORANGE. There is nothing red about the color, it is orange. It also severely stains the scalp and skin around the face. I used heavy duty hand cream around my hairline to protect my skin from dye, but the dye leached out and stained my skin anyway. It looks like someone outlined my face in orange hi-liter pen. DO NOT RECOMMEND.</li>
    <li> I loved this product, the red has staying power, doesn&#x27;t wash out to orangey red or brassy! I would recommended it to anyone trying for bright red hair. I purchased it here because the stores carry hundreds of browns and blondes but sometimes NO red.&lt;br /&gt;Received product fast and was very happy with it!</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t happy with this haircolor.  It turned out woody woodpecker orange.  I left it on for the same amount of time that I&#x27;ve always left haircolor on my hair.  I ended up having to go to Sally&#x27;s Beauty Supply and buy 2 additional toners to tone the orange down.  I even did a strand test, so the results were not what I wanted at all.  I have tried Vidal Sassoon 6R in the past and it was fine ... so, I&#x27;m not sure what happened.</li>
    <li> Love, love , love it.  COlor is awesome and is exactly what I wanted!&lt;br /&gt;The color is true to the box and it lasts for weeks.  Most reds just wash out in a couple of shampoos.</li>
    <li> Calling this my signature color.  Bright and beautiful.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been a fake redhead for over 30 years.  Hands down the best color.  Rich. Doesn&#x27;t fade (like all reds do). Good to my hair.  Those of you getting too dark shade are leaving it on too long.</li>
    <li> Love this hair dye. Have tried many before but none last as long as this one and leave my hair looking as healthy. I received this product free of charge as a promotional item from vidal sasoon however, my opinions are solely, my own</li>
    <li> I have been working with someone&#x27;s hair bringing it to a beautiful red for quite a few years.  I always choose a base color, medium and highlight.  The favorite choice has been intense red base with COPPER tones, a bright intense light copper, and then brilliant golden blonde highlights.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The combination is gorgeous and perfect.  The problem has been that the base tones that look best were all discontinued and nothing has worked- it is either too cherry red, too faded, or too brown.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recently I got the RR6 which is also termed Runway Red for the base color and I must say that this is the most perfect red ever.  The color is intense vibrant copper red - the only way to explain it is like mixing ketchup and mustard.  The color has tremendous depth to it- better than most other reds I have ever used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you like the color of the girl on the Wendy&#x27;s commercials- this would be a decent choice.  It coordinates well with L&#x27;Oreal Mega Red in Light Intense Copper (which is level 7).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OBSERVATIONS&lt;br /&gt;- You don&#x27;t get a lot of product- buy one more than you would normally buy&lt;br /&gt;- Intensely colored- THIS COLOR STAINS.  Use stain resistant product around hairline&lt;br /&gt;- Works more intensely on virgin hair, than previously dyed hair- absolutely NO skunk line at the roots&lt;br /&gt;- Will run for a little while when you wash your hair&lt;br /&gt;- No burning- has a cooling sensation after initial tingling&lt;br /&gt;- No bad odors&lt;br /&gt;- Conditioner is concentrated and amplifies color beautifully&lt;br /&gt;- Gloves are different than usual- have good grip to them but fit tight&lt;br /&gt;- I have not gone through the boasted 8 week period yet but will update when I do&lt;br /&gt;-  Will dye skin so if you gently massage your scalp after first dyeing and use gentle color safe shampoo it will come off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Runway Red is a new color as of January 1 2014 so it will be making its way to the market widely eventually.  It is such a gorgeous red that I wanted to be sure to let everyone know about it right away so you will know what to expect.  The color on the box is pretty accurate, but you need to block out the red border around the photo.  It throws off the perception.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HAIR USED ON- medium fine hair- long- down to center of back.  3 inches of virgin hair- dark golden brown and the rest previously dyed copper hair which faded to a brown auburn.  Results were even dyeing from root to tip- VERY unusual for a red dye and worth mentioning.to let everyone know about it right away so you will know what to expect.  The color on the box is pretty accurate, but you need to block out the red border around the photo.  It throws off the perception.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;HAIR USED ON- medium fine hair- long- down to center of back.  3 inches of virgin hair- dark golden brown and the rest previously dyed copper hair which faded to a brown auburn.  Results were even dyeing from root to tip- VERY unusual for a red dye and worth mentioning.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite hair dye I was reluctant to try it at first because the brand is not as well- known as others like Feria or Garnier (the latter having a nasty tendency to cause dry scalp and irritation) however I was driven to try it after my grandma who had been dyeing hers for 12 years with the same brand switched to it with great results. I have light brown-blonde hair naturally and although i have dyed it 7 times I had waited a good 2 months before trying this color. I loved it!!! There was no mess at all it did not run or stain the floor/counter/my skin and it was very gentle, did not have that strong smell that most chemical dyes give off (it was subtle and non-stinging) One bottle was enough to cover all of my thick hair (goes abut 4 inches past the shoulder) and I experienced no irritation and was able to wash out almost all the &amp;#34;leftover&amp;#34; color in 15 minutes. I was impressed by the conditioner, which actually was really softening and the color came out just like the swatches indicate, a coppery-cherry red. What I liked about it is that is not overwhelmingly red since there are rules about that kind of thing at my school, like most others. Just radiant, stunning, shiny and overall beautiful red! Great unique sultry look to catch a cute guy&#x27;s attention ;) I know I did!</li>
    <li> I have been trying for years to find that perfect red, and every color I try, never is what they say on the box. either to orange or to brown. FINALLY, a red that matches the box. I bought 5RR. Now if the color lasts like it says it will, I will be a fan for life!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will update this review in a few weeks and let you know if its still as red.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downpoint is it feels like it has less dye than a normal box of the other brand, but thats because how creamy it is. If you have alot of hair, you may want to consider buying a extra box. I normally use 2 boxes for whole head, and a litle left over, but this time the 2 barely covered it all, and i really worked it and combed it through to stretch it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Update*&lt;br /&gt;3 weeks in, and the color is still awesome (normally my reds fade a little by now). The only thing I don&#x27;t care for (though I will deal with for the color), is how much, no matter how many times you rince the water clear, it &#x27;bleeds&#x27; the next time you wash it. Just adding product or a water mist won&#x27;t do it, but a shower will.</li>
    <li> I bought 5RR (medium vibrant red) and just colored my hair. I&#x27;ve been coloring my hair for 25 years and have used every single \\&quot;drugstore\\&quot; brand (all four Loreal lines, Garnier, John Frieda, Revlon, all varieties of Clairol) and almost every single shade of red available, from mahogany to light copper to those intense reds by Feria. I was mildly concerned when the color of the dye was sherbet orange, even after developing for a while (usually it&#x27;s a dark purple or wine shade with other brands) and even more concerned when I kept rinsing out sherbet orange in the shower. And then, I removed the towel from my head and... MY HAIR IS ORANGE, BRIGHT ORANGE!!! And I mean ORANGE, not orange like Ginger Kids orange, but fake, fluorescent orange. How on earth am I supposed to go to work like this?? After drying it, I got back in the shower and washed it a few times, but still my hair (and scalp thankyouverymuch) is BRIGHT ORANGE, literally like one of those funky colors you buy and you have the choice of neon pink, blue, purple, green, etc. Somewhere between a brand new penny and orange sherbet. I&#x27;m off now to buy some sort of hat for work until it either washes out, A LOT, or I can use some sort of brown color on top of it. I know I should just wait a week or so and then go to my hairdresser to fix it, but frankly I&#x27;m too mortified to show it to her. On the plus side, I probably won&#x27;t get hit by any cars in the crosswalk...    Independent of my color problem, one of things I did notice is that there wasn&#x27;t a lot of color solution even for my hair (somewhere between short and medium length), so if you have hair longer than 1 inch long and you&#x27;re not convinced by my review to STAY FAR AWAY, you may want to buy two boxes (complete waste of money). It does smell okay, not too perfumy or chemically, and I liked the conditioner. My scalp was stinging when the color was on it though, like with Garnier, which doesn&#x27;t happen with Loreal or John Frieda.    ----------    Follow-up later: I went to my stylist for advice and she said I looked like a Cheeto... Natural Instincts and clarifying shampoo didn&#x27;t help. After one week, I dyed it ash brown and finally, the saga was over. I am forever sticking with L&#x27;oreal.</li>
    <li> loved it, great color. works perfectly. i give it more than 5 stars. color is wonderful. cover grey really well.</li>
    <li> I have used Vidal Sassoon styling products on and off, but never till now tried their hair color, as I have been a faithful user of another top brand. This time because of a hard to pass offer, I decided to go for it, I&#x27;ve just finished using it and before I forget the feeling, I came to write the review. I am totally happy and pleasantly surprised, even my stubborn gray are gone, something that my previous brand not always did. The smell is not bad at all, the color is perfect and on the sunlight gives a hint of reddish highlights that I love, but above all the softness it&#x27;s unbelievable, silky soft. I totally recommend this product, and I guess I found a new favorite.</li>
    <li> love it.  I get so many compliments on the 5RR red red red.</li>
    <li> I have very long hair and I was so glad I ordered two boxes of the Medium Vibrant Red. I will say it was easy enough to apply it. No terrible smell or anything like that. The red that it turned out is not like the box. To me, the box looks like a reddish brown, somewhat believable as a &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; color. However, my hair turned out RED!!! Envision the little mermaid level of RED!!! Firetruck engine RED!!! Which is fantastic if that is what you are going for, it just wasn&#x27;t for me. I did like how the dye made my hair feel afterwards and I liked the product in general, I just was not prepared for the amount of red that I was in for! So use it, but be aware, you will have very very very red hair when you are done!</li>
    <li> I have naturally dark hair, almost a matte black color. I&#x27;ve tried every type of box colors under the sun but none would actually change my color. Right now I have a few blonde streaks from highlights that have grown out. When I colored my hair with this one it definitely changed the highlights. I love how the overall hair came out. looks like I put red high/low lights in. My hair is right past my shoulders, so I should have bought 2 boxes but didn&#x27;t. One box gave a nice all over color. Only time will tell how long the red will actually stay in. Very happy with this purchase!</li>
    <li> the 4 stars are because of the strong aroma.&lt;br /&gt;My husband helped me with my hair because it is long. The smell was real strong for him. oh the color I used was 5RR medium vibrant red. right now it is still wet and I just combed it. The color so far is nice and bright. I can&#x27;t wait to see it dry but I don&#x27;t like to use my hair dryer. If you can get past the smell it is a great product.</li>
    <li> This is the worst hair color I have ever used.  The day after I used this my hair turned orange,  This has never happened to me before!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been dying my hair red for over 10 years. I&#x27;ve tried literally every brand and shade of red so I&#x27;m very familiar with boxed hair color products and which ones work the best. The reason why I tried this one is because it&#x27;s new and it was on sale. I specifically tried 5RR Medium Vibrant Red and here are my pros and cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;-Very vibrant rich colored red.&lt;br /&gt;-Hair super smooth after rinsing out and using the conditioner it came with. (My hair was still very smooth the next day too)&lt;br /&gt;-Good price. (Because it was on sale at time of purchase)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;-I had a burning feeling on my head (throughout the 10 years of using boxed color I&#x27;ve never had any burning sensation before)&lt;br /&gt;-Smell was awful (most boxed hair colors have intense smells but this was the worst)&lt;br /&gt;-While coloring hair turned orange for a little bit (I was a bit scared that it was going to turn out to be orange but I gave it another 5 mins and it turned dark, this may be the reason why my head burned BUT colorwise I&#x27;m glad I waited longer because the orange color was really scary looking)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In conclusion I gave it 3 stars because I still feel a little bit of burning on my head. I kept the color in my hair for 30 minutes which is the max that the instructions suggest. I was also very scared that I was going to end up with orange hair given all the other reviews I read. I have no doubt in mind that if I didn&#x27;t leave the color in for 5 more minutes I would have ended up with orange hair. I think I&#x27;m just going to stick with the less intense Garnier Nutrisse R3 Light Intense Auburn. It smells better than this Vidal Sassoon, is cheaper by a couple of dollars, doesn&#x27;t make my head burn, and still gives a great color red from a box.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a Stylist and tried this color to see if the Red would remain in the hair after washing. I used it two times in a row 6 weeks apart to cover some silver coming in around the hair line around my face. I was horrified to notice that my hair fell out in a huge circle in the crown of my head. I have very thick hair and when the stylist I go to does cut my hair about every 6 weeks because I have a short razor cut she always compliments on how thick  my hair is.  My daughter mentioned that I looked like I had a bald spot in the back of my head.  I told her it&#x27;s the way I sleep on that side of my head at night I had not styled my hair that day yet. However I took a shower and blew dry my hair and low and behold  right in the back of my head was a huge bald spot.  I can feel stubbles of the hair trying to grow back in but in the mean while I&#x27;m stuck trying to cover this bald spot and I am furious with this product.  The color is a nice rich red, and it does not wash out like most reds will.  I highly recommend you use this product with caution and watch for hair loss after continued use. My hair grows very fast which is why I used it 6 weeks apart, but I will never buy or use this product ever again.  I am so embarrassed having this huge bald spot in the middle of my head the crown area. If I were not a stylist I would be at a loss at how to fix my hair to cover it up for the most part, but the circle of hair loss is so big that some bald does show through no matter how I style my hair.  I do not recommend this product for anyone, just because it has the Vidal Sassoon name on the product does not mean that you will not experience hair loss.  Beware and use with caution. I would never use this product in a client&#x27;s hair for fear of losing my license.</li>
    <li> I have been using this brand for a quite while.&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;- Color does lasts longer (not exact weeks, varies by season) than any cheaper retail priced ones.&lt;br /&gt;- Chemical smell is minimal to be bothered.&lt;br /&gt;- My scalp is not affected in any way to use this brand for a year or so.&lt;br /&gt;- Availability &amp; Convenience : Every drug store carries (Duane Reade, Rite Aide, CVS etc. )&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;- Color choice : I have a natural dark/medium brown.  First time I bought &amp;#34;Dark Brown&amp;#34;. My friend asked me if I dyed my hair &amp;#34;Black&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;Second time, I bought &amp;#34;Medium Brown&amp;#34;,  I asked the same friend what color I have on.  My friend said &amp;#34;Not black, right? Uh... dark brown?  So, some how I have to choose &amp;#34;Light Brown&amp;#34; for my natural  &amp;#34;Dark/Medium brown&amp;#34; hair.&lt;br /&gt;I never had this Off-color problem with any other brands I had used.  Otherwise I didn&#x27;t have to go through &amp;#34;trial/error&amp;#34; time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- In comparison of long term use with other brands/alternative natural ingredients: I like this for the above reasons (Pros part), but still not healthy in the long term use.  So I will give it a break to go back to messy henna in between .....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yet, for chemical dye, one of my favorites for sure.</li>
    <li> I bought this at Target because it had a $2 coupon attached making it only $5. It is Amazing how RED this turned my hair and even after a couple weeks I still have undoubtedly bright red hair. Mind you This is without using color safe shampoo, protein fillers, or replenishing shampoos but only cold water when washing. Also it didn&#x27;t damage my hair any further which was dyed a mere two weeks beforehand. This is my go to brand for red hair from now as it has convinced me to maintain this red for at least 3 more months with maybe one or two more dye sessions.</li>
    <li> DO NOT buy this hair coloring unless your intention is to look like Wilma Flintstone.  After applying color and letting it set for 30 minutes I rinsed it out and rinsed it out and rinsed it out some more.  The water never came clear.  I soaked my head in the tub to try to rinse, my water turned orange.  I got out but it wasn&#x27;t much better.  My scalp, the edges of my hair line and my ears were orange.  I&#x27;ve never had a hair coloring not want to rinse out and never have they dyed my skin.  The following day I decided to wash my hair in the tub and soak it out, I washed three times.  My water was very orange but the color of my hair is AWFUL!!!  Will never purchase again!</li>
    <li> This dye is amazing. Came with so much product. Covered my hair that&#x27;s almost down to my butt. The smell is quite strong but tolerable. Would recommend this to anyone!</li>
    <li> I have been coloring my hair both professionally and personally for over 20 years.  Most recently, I used lightest brown over my highlighted hair.  I have very resistant grays.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used a brush and applied to my roots carefully, starting first with the side and the forehead since that&#x27;s where the most resistant grays are.  I left it on for the appropriate time.  I did not find the application process or the smell annoying.  The instructions were clear and helpful.  The conditioner afterwards was great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The downside is that the color started fading after a week with the grays starting to peek through.  I&#x27;ll need to do the color again in about 10 days  so the total time it&#x27;s working for me is roughly under 3 weeks which is not long enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you have resistant grays, you may want to consider another product.  I need to switch stylists and brands frequently because my hair doesn&#x27;t respond to the same product when I use it over an extended period of time.</li>
    <li> It was great but only last for a few weeks which it does actually dye my hair the beautiful red ever</li>
    <li> It concerned me when I was shaking this bottle to use it and the hair dye was a kind of salmony pink color unlike all the other medium red dyes I have used of other brands that turned an much darker shade upon mixing and application. I have been dying my hair for over 10 years now and that color was not a good sign.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a red head who colors her hair to retain the vibrant coppery auburn hues of her youth the final result was NOT what they picture on the box and was more a IRONMAN red color not at in any way natural looking and not the color I was expecting. I am not upset, it is not permanent but I will never buy this product again..I will go back to using Clairol or L&#x27;Oreal who both have much more natural looking shades of red than this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also I spent like 20 minutes rinsing my hair out and it still never \\&quot;ran clear\\&quot; and is already washing out..now this is good news to me since I did not care for the final result anyway but I would be angry if I actually liked this color.</li>
