      <li>However, if you don&#x27;t use it for the full 24 minutes, you&#x27;re not going to get the best results.</li>

      <li>Great system, I need to use it more.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This system really helped improve my skin, clearing up my dark scars, but you have to be consistent and patient.</li>
    <li> MY opinion is that it takes entirely too long for even ONE treatment. I did not see positive results.  I only experienced bad results as in ingrown hairs on my chin.  I returned this and MY opinion is not to purchase tis until it has been streamlined to shorter treatments.&lt;br /&gt;ONE treatment for just color is supposed to be 24 minutes!  Moving something around your face for that long is not fun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Try a microneedle light roller. I saw great results quickly.</li>
    <li> I will review this product after 30 days of use but even at only the second day of use I see a difference.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m using it for a short while only, but it shows some improvements on my skin, especially with the acne.</li>
    <li> I bought this to treat acne and acne scars. Followed the instructions for 3 months and I have not seen any results.</li>
    <li> I took my time to submit a review here since I really wanted to thoroughly test this product first in order to give a honest opinion. It has been more than 2 months now that I have been using this system daily. When I mean daily, it&#x27;s every single day for both the red and green lights. Honestly, I still have to see any results. The spots on my face which were the reason why I purchased this are still there. No changes in color or size whatsoever. Although, I don&#x27;t have that much visible wrinkles, my face did not seem to have any noticeable improvements from using this system at all. Which makes me wonder about the glowing reviews I have been reading here. Some of them say the results were immediate like within a week even a day! I know results can be subjective depending on the condition of the skin but 2 months of daily usage and no results at all????  C&#x27;mon.... Is it just me or this product doesn&#x27;t really deliver what it promises to. Disappointing!</li>
    <li> I am a tanned colored women and it has helped with my hyperpigmentation around my mouth and on my chin.  Very simple to use.  You must email the customer service department for any additional questions about how to use the item to be  most effective on your skin color.</li>
    <li> I can tell this gadget is doing something, I&#x27;m just not sure if it&#x27;s making me look younger. It appears mostly to even out my skin tone. It will zap your tan right off. It will not do anything for small broken capillaries, but I knew that. It takes a long time to do the entire process, which makes me not want to do it. It does cut out on me sometimes, and I have to beat it or unplug. Oh, it do think it may also work a little to help acne and reduce pore size.</li>
    <li> I have used the System almost daily for several months, now all of a sudden it isn&#x27;t working correctly. If I move it a little it stops, so not sure if its in the cord or something else. Any one else have this problem? The price was a lot for me as I am a senior on a fixed income, so I can&#x27;t replace it.&lt;br /&gt;NOTE: I did contact customer service, and my System was replaced quickly with no questions. Great Customer service. Thanks so much.</li>
    <li> I bought the Aurora system on september/2014, following use instructions... for the first 2 months at least 4 times a week... in regular bases my skin tends to breakout because is oily, and i noticed that i don&#x27;t have pimples as frequent as used to since i started to use the device, and my acne spots has clear up a bit but no completely disappear, is not MAGIC, many reviews claims thats their skin is wonderful after the treatment but i&#x27;m not lucky enough to see that kind of result.    Acne is my primary concern, i&#x27;m 38 and i&#x27;m blessed with not much wrinkles (only one between my eyebrows), i normally use blue and green lights.    The therapy is time consuming, every full cycle is 24 mins per color, so if you use  3 colors you need to spend 1 hour and 12 minutes each time, and i recommend buy a pair of googles (not included) to protect your eyes especially with red lights because is pretty intense.    To sum up, you could expect an improve in your skin if you use the system very constantly, but in my personal opinion if you have serious skin problems like cystic acne or spot due to health condition is better go to visit a doctor.</li>
    <li> Tried for a while. I didn&#x27;t really see the results.&lt;br /&gt;So I decided to see yet another dermatologist, and that what really cleared all my acnes.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t see how anyone can stand to use this so often. I really thought I would be excited to use it but it&#x27;s just annoying and time consuming so I only used it probably 10 times and stopped. Obviously that doesn&#x27;t give it enough time to work, so I don&#x27;t know if it works or not. I&#x27;m writing this review to say that if you want to buy this (since it&#x27;s so expensive) be sure that you&#x27;re definitely going to put the time in to use it &amp; also you for sure need goggles. The green and blue light HURT my eyes, even when I shut them and it made it difficult to use as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t think the system is junky, as other reviews have said that it looked. I don&#x27;t think it really matters anyways how it looks, but lots of people have said it works wonderfully &amp; others say it hasn&#x27;t done anything so if it doesn&#x27;t work you can sell it on ebay as I did lol</li>
    <li> So far I have used this product 3 times and I love it. It is light, durable, and feels great! I am amazed at how much light comes off the attachments. I am also seeing changes in my skin. I was skeptical but I can see my crows feet disappearing!!!</li>
    <li> Do it everyday and you will see the results. Although, doing it everyday might be painful but if u want to see results, DO IT EVERYDAY.</li>
    <li> I adore this device. I&#x27;m not 100% if it does any good, but the power of suggestion is real and I like to think it&#x27;s helping to diminish old acne spots and keep the new acne spots from being as horrible as they could be.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 43 and have been getting ridiculous, huge zits, about 1 per month for the past few months.  They are so embarrassing and do not go away with all the normal zit remedies.  I used the blue light therapy at night and when I woke up the zit was 50% smaller and the redness was 80% gone.  The next night I used it again and the zit decreased another 50% and the redness was completely gone the next morning.  You can only use this 3-4 times per week, allowing your skin to rest between uses, so I got out of the routine and quit using it since after the 2 days I was easily able to cover up the tiny bump with makeup.  I can&#x27;t believe how well this really works!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;** Update after 2 months-  The blue light does not work on every pimple.  Some of them come back in the exact spot a month later (hormonal?) Some require more blue light than others.  Also, I have been using the red and green light twice a week with good results.  My skin looks much better without makeup.  The color is more even and smoother than before.  I think the sun spots on my cheeks are also fading.</li>
    <li> After using it one time it would not re-charge. Fortunately, Amazon helped me get a full refund on this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried dozens of products to control my acne and nothing really worked. The Aurora light is really a lifesaver. What everybody knows is that blue light kills acne. What many don&#x27;t know is that blue light works best in conjunction with red light. While blue light kills acne bacteria, red light reduces redness and increases collagen production which helps prevent acne scars. So my regimen is as follows - 3 minutes of red light, followed by 3 minutes of blue light per affected area. For the first month I used the light every day. Now, after I&#x27;ve seen substantial progress, I use it about 3 to 4 times a week. I think after it&#x27;s completely gone, I&#x27;ll use it just once or twice a week for maintenance.</li>
    <li> I used for about 2 weeks according to instructions, and then the light died. I reached out to the company a few times via their website. Asked how I could purchase another light and was that normal. No response. Now, it just sits collecting dust. I also checked with my dermatologist. He was luke warm about using light therapy to reduce dark spots. I should have contacted him prior to purchasing. Spend the money on getting a facial.</li>
    <li> I have researched and considered several light therapy devices before deciding on the Aurora. I am very happy with my purchase and have noticed substantial improvements after just two weeks of use. The 3-minute timer feature is really helpful and you can do treatments while reading, watching tv or whatever. The green light seems to be brighter than the two others (probably because it is perceived by the human eye as such), so I got a pair of goggles for a few bucks at the tanning salon that I frequent.</li>
    <li> I was inspired to do this review because of some of the negative feedback I read here. I have an amazing story to tell about this product. To keep the history part short, I basically suffered from pizza-face acne since I was 11 years old, and it never stopped even once all the way up to 19 years old, which was when I bought this product. I never really tried any creams or anything that promised to clear skin, because I didn&#x27;t trust them. I decided to get the Aurora after seeing a review of it on youtube, mostly because it was expensive ($150 at the time). Just the mentality that expensive &#x3D; good. I got it on October 2013, which is when I took my &amp;#34;before&amp;#34; picture. Now, in addition to the light therapy, I also bought the &amp;#34;aztec clay mask&amp;#34; on here, which has extremely good reviews, and combined the two. Basically what I would did is that I would steam my face by boiling water and putting my head over it, then I would use the mask, and then I would just the light therapy. If I remember correctly, the light therapy said to use it consistently for 8 weeks or something, and then do it less and less. I actually did it for much less than this, I think I did it consistently for 1 week, and then I started doing it every 2-3 days, until I stopped completely around December. Sometime in January, my face was *completely* clear. I had stopped using the light therapy a few weeks before this, so I didn&#x27;t immediately think that was the cause, I simply thought that it was one of those extremely rare days where my face would be sorta clear for a day or two. But by March my face was still super clear, and I started to wonder. I did not use the light therapy again all the way until August of 2014, which is when 1 or 2 pimples began breaking out again after a staggering 8 months of clear skin. I have no doubt that it must have been the light therapy what did it, or perhaps the 3 combination of things I did (steam, face mask, light therapy), because I didn&#x27;t change a singleaspect of my lifestyle whatsoever. I still eat junk, I still sleep a lot etc etc. Right now I was just googling about this product again because I&#x27;m thinking of beginning to use all 3 lights for added benefit, and that&#x27;s when I came across this review page. Anyway, I&#x27;ve added a before and after picture. The first picture was taken on October 2013, and then second on June 2014. Both are completely unedited.</li>
    <li> I really appreciate this device! I have been trying anything to lighten up my age spots for years, and this really worked. I&#x27;m not that old (48), but I seemed to inherit early age spotting from my Dad. (thanks dad). I&#x27;m an author and will be heading out for my first book tour plus making some Youtube videos and I had been looking for something to hide the age spots plus some redness on the sides of my face. I went to Clinique and other skin joints in the mall, and they said there was nothing they could really do besides hide it with coverup. I thought the Sirius Aurora was worth a try and after a couple of weeks, I really noticed a difference in my skin. I&#x27;m really happy and wish I&#x27;d tried this long ago, not sure if it even was around that long ago. It&#x27;s easy and painless with no messy creams or looking like a clown. Thanks again for a great product!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been very diligent at using this little device 2-3 times a week, only green and red. Always start with the red, finish with green. The results were obvious 2 weeks in, 4 months later the change was quite dramatic and for the better. Seriously, nothing short of miraculous. Let me put it this way: I&#x27;m 36 and am now getting carded consistently for the first time in my life.</li>
    <li> I have tried this out on my face and on my daughter&#x27;s. Works well. Does decrease redness. Product seems made well enough. No issues there. I was happy it was an FDA approved therapy.</li>
    <li> I like this, but I took off a star because it&#x27;s kind of a pain to do your entire face. I ended up getting a Illumask and I use this for spot treatments with the green light. However, if you have the patience, LED really does work. It did make my skin look whiter though, some of my friends were commenting on how pale I have gotten. But that&#x27;s a small price to pay for beautiful skin!</li>
    <li> Love the product, but poor quality.  I would recommend anyone interested in this product read all the low reviews to see the issues with customer service and the product malfunctioning within weeks of purchase.  Let me start with the positives, this product works!  My son has acne and this product worked like  magic and he will use it while he watches tv.  I use the red light and green lights for anti-aging and age spots and have seen a noticeable difference to the positive for both.  I use almond oil on my face and then use the red and green lights.  The negatives, the product started working on and off with in three weeks of purchase.  This is an expensive purchase to malfunction so quickly!  I had a feeling the malfunction was related the electrical cord so I tried some other cords I had at home and viola it worked again! I used a netgear adaptor I had in drawer. Radio Shack would probably have a quality replacement cord as well.  I think the company needs to address this issue or vastly reduce the price for crappy quality.  Hopefully my fix will help others.</li>
    <li> Ok, so I&#x27;m used to going to the tanning salon (high pressure, for the full time) and getting instantly better looking skin (more even toned, less inflammed spots).  I think I had slightly high expectations for this product, but it does improve skin if you have patience.  I&#x27;m only using it for acne (mainly the blue and red lights), so I can&#x27;t comment just yet on the anti-aging and hyper pigmentation benefits.  Overall, I do like this product and will continue to use it, just don&#x27;t think you&#x27;ll have perfectly clear skin after a couple of days.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t see any results from this gadget. A waste of money. sorry i bought it. Gives a pretty light show</li>
    <li> So far so good.&lt;br /&gt;I purchased the Srisus SS-77 Aurora Light for myself and my teenaged son. He and I have been using it three times weekly over a six week period so far. He ( age 15) uses the blue light for his acne, me (age 54) the red light for aging skin.&lt;br /&gt;We are both are seeing some positive improvements and looking forward to more.&lt;br /&gt;We have traveled with the unit and have even dropped it once or twice without any negative affect to its workablities.</li>
    <li> I really rate LED Light therapy.  The Aurora Sirius is fabulous &amp; saves hundreds in salon treatments. Light therapy is becoming the latest beauty/ anti-aging treatment.</li>
    <li> so to begin with I have hyperpigmentation issues due from sun damage and acne scaring. I will state I am skin care specialist(esthnition) I did like the product. If you are consistent you will see results; this isn&#x27;t a  miracle lazer by any means. But if you do what you should be doing to take care of your face you will be impressed(drinking lots of water eating right using sunscreen ect).  I like the blue light for acne. Consistent use will prevent future breakouts. And it can help heal current break outs. Blue light helps inhibit the over production of melinin (what make your skin darken) I havn&#x27;t noticed anything with the red light yet but i havn&#x27;t been using it consistently. tips for using- I have it plugged into where I use my computer next to my bed. its easy to use the only thing i think is strange is the \\&quot;mode\\&quot; it comes with. the light is steady, and the other mode flashes not sure what that is supposed to be accomplishing. This light is very bright so don&#x27;t look in it. other than that. I wouldn&#x27;t buy the expensive ones since you can find some out there for around $70. so best of luck</li>
    <li> If you want a lasting improvement in a couple of weeks - definitely give Aurora a try. If you are looking for immediate results - look elsewhere. It takes about twenty minutes a day, four times a week and is definitely worth it. Considering that you can do other things while holding the device to your face - it&#x27;s very convenient. I would give it at least 4 weeks for noticeable improvement to appear. What I did was take photos of my face every few days because some changes are so subtle, you don&#x27;t see them at first with a naked eye. They accumulate over time and then become readily visible.</li>
    <li> It is great. I am in my early 40, I have a bit of acne scarring, still some acne, a bit of too wide pores (combination skin). It reduces pores, light (not very deep scarring), skin is just glowing. It helps to stop inflammation in newly appeared pimples too! I am using it for 1.5 months and I am really impressed with an effect. First weeks I had a feeling that skin looks a bit plumper, but just because of a bit of tiny swelling under  and traumatizing by light. It is a very slight feeling, nobody notices for sure, only myself, knowing a bit of technology of microdermabrasion. They traumatize skin to produce new skin cells. But what is good, then this feeling disappears in a while, and you have just improved skin noninvasive . I have a problem: I would like the cord would be longer, and now at the moment it has a glitch, stops working, switches off by itself when it is not meant to. I have checked all cord&#x27;s plugs and it still does the same. But even with this technical issue I admit: this is a great purchase.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m almost 40 and I&#x27;ve been discussing options with my esthetician.  She suggested a bunch of very expensive laser treatments to target some wrinkles, 2 very large spots on my face (that I got while pregnant) and improve my overall complexion including minimizing my pores.  I told myself it was going to be my 40th birthday gift to myself.  In the meanwhile, I started researching do-it yourself devices.  This product came up on my search and I thought to myself, everyone says the blue one works - so at the very least I could keep my acne at bay.  I&#x27;ve been using it for a month now and I can say that my acne is so unnoticeable, my pores are smaller, the spots on my face have lightened - one is barely even there now, my wrinkles look like they did a few years ago and my over all skin complexion is noticeably better.  The downside is that you do have to use the product regularly.  Every single day you have time to sit down and relax - read a book, watch TV, sit outside (near an outlet - it&#x27;s corded), you need to use it.  I use red first, green second and blue last.  I do my whole face (even adding some zones) with the solid light, then do it all over with the blinking light.  If I&#x27;m short on time, I just do the solid light.  Everyone is different, and will use it differently.  In my opinion, if you can devote the time, it&#x27;s worth a try.  At the very least you get some peaceful time to yourself.</li>
    <li> Broke 2 months in. Non refundable. DO NOT BUY!</li>
    <li> Did not match the description at all...not a happy customer.</li>
    <li> After 3 months of use, I feel that this purchase was a waste of money.</li>
    <li> Love it! Saw results in one week</li>
    <li> I am the queen of skeptics.  However, I was a desperate skeptic when I purchased this Aurora Light Therapy System.  Battling acne into my forties, I have truly tried everything prescription and over-the-counter.  Worse, my teenage daughter has had a terrible time with her own hormone induced breakouts.  We have both used this product two or three times a week since purchasing.  Both of us show marked improvement with very different types of acne.  Reading other reviews of acne sufferers, I have noticed that they tend to not use the red/infrared light disk provided.  Although this disk is shown on the literature with the product to help with signs of aging, I have discovered that it tends to help speed the healing of pimples that have already \\&quot;crowned.\\&quot;  The open pore and redness seem to heal much faster when I use the blue acne disk and the red disk together.  Other reviewers are correct when they mention that the process takes a long time during treatment, but when I think about all the time I have wasted on products that don&#x27;t work - or even about one bump that won&#x27;t go away for over two weeks - it is worth the time. I hope that Sirius is working on developing an entire light-based face mask that will accomplish everything at once.  Until then, I am thrilled to have this product.</li>
    <li> I used this item for three months exactly as instructed and I did not see ANY benefit from it at all. I contacted the manufacturer to see about any kind of refund and they will not respond. BIG WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY.</li>
    <li> I have been using the Aurora for approximately three months and I can see a major improvement in my skin tone. It does what it promises and I love what it is doing for my face. My skin tone and texture have improved tremendously. I have noticed that my skin feels plumper and smoother, my complexion has a healthy glow now. I have recommended this product to many friends. The device is really easy to use and changing treatment panels literally takes a couple of seconds.</li>
    <li> I have tried micodermabrasion and that does practically nothing for my skin. This is the only product that has an impact on my acne scars and current acne. If you have tried everything else to no avail, please consider giving this a try. It is an affording home treatment system that can be used over and over rather than having to waste all your money for treatments at your dermatologist&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;Highly Recommended!</li>
    <li> Just got yesterday,I used it twice and twice today, can realy see a difference in my acne. Along with the acne free face wash.</li>
    <li> I did not notice significant changes in my skin using this product but I have to admit that I could not consistently use it due to the time it takes to do a treatment. I&#x27;m not sure I would ever have the time to do this with enough frequency for it to produce any benefits.</li>
    <li> I have purchased Sirius SS-77 Aurora because my son had really bad problems with acne. We tried everything, absolutely everything! There was a period when he didn’t want to go to college as everyone was laughing at him. He didn’t believe anything would work, but we kept trying until Sirius Aurora gave us an amazing result! In 2 months his face has cleared and my pretty boy gained his confidence again! It works!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had acne since I can remember, it will come and go, but I&#x27;ve almost always had at least 2 zits at all times. I got the Sirius Aurora as a present about 3 or 4 months ago and it has completely cleared my face within a matter of weeks. I was really skeptical of the aurora light at first, but after a week I was getting no new zits, and after two weeks my face was clear. Months later I still get the occasional zit, but as long as I stay on top of my treatment it goes away quickly. I&#x27;m very happy with this product and I&#x27;m quick to tell anyone that asks about how I got my face so clear to try it out!</li>
    <li> I thought I was gonna have to wait a while to post a review so I could see effective results ... Wrong!! I didn&#x27;t expect much and I didn&#x27;t even know if I&#x27;d be one of the people it&#x27;d work for ( Cus nothing ever works for me). So I got it and used it that night. For about 5 nights I used just blue light and I could tell some big zits were forming and they didn&#x27;t get as big as usual, so that was good enough for me. Then I added the red light in before the blue and WOW!! Whole new face in two days!! I could cry I&#x27;m so happy!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And it says wait 24 hrs between uses but personally I say just do what you think will work for you. I use it every night and for a shorter period every morning. Yeah it takes time but if you say you want results and you don&#x27;t put in the time then you didn&#x27;t want it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;LOVE IT</li>
    <li> I bought this product directly from the Sirius website.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really really wanted this product to work. When I received it, I was so excited! I have very little acne so I thought using this would help clear my face and make it perfect. The lights are really bright which was a good thing, it had to work right?! Unfortunately after using it for a couple of days, the light on the red wand suddenly was not bright anymore; It became very dull. Not just that my acne got worst (maybe because it was bringing some of the old acne up to surface, I don&#x27;t know).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I immediately contacted the Sirius customer service and boy, they were mean! I wrote a kind email simply asking why it the wand dimmed down and their customer service told me it was impossible and that I was lying... I was fairly offended so I requested for a refund. The shipping was not refunded so I only got a part of my money back but no point keeping a product that doesn&#x27;t work and especially from a company that has no respect for their customers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I believe light therapy works if you have the patience for it but I don&#x27;t believe in this company and I will never buy their products again.</li>
    <li> Great system, I need to use it more.</li>
    <li> after 6 months of using, simply no effect what soever. I have fair skin, blonde hair and I used it every other evening</li>
    <li> I really can&#x27;t say whether the product works if you use it regularly because it takes at least a half an hour per use of sitting and rubbing it on your face. I didn&#x27;t have the time, or the patience for it and also didn&#x27;t find the handle to be very comfortable for the amount of time it needs to be held. There are similar products that supposedly achieve the same results in a shorter time but this one came with different colored light attachments and was at a great price. I didn&#x27;t realize how long it needed to be used before I purchased it but if I had would have paid the extra for one that would have been more time friendly for me. Just be prepared to put the time in if you buy this one and it will probably work fine.</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t sure the Sirius SS-77 would really work, but the previous reviews on the product convinced me to try this system.  I have had allergies/skin irritations around my eyes and mouth for nearly four months and have used many products and prescriptions.  I have faithfully used the red light, as directed, for over a month now and am very pleased with my progress.  My skin went from flaky and chapped and irritated to smooth and pliable.  I&#x27;m in my late 50&#x27;s and the only reason I haven&#x27;t given this a five star, yet, is because I&#x27;m optimistically waiting to see the progress (less pronounced wrinkles) around my eyes and forehead.  I know several other reviewers complained about the time needed to use this product.  It is so easy for me...I simply use it while I&#x27;m watching tv or listening to music...I find the time relaxing and the heat comforting.  My only complaint is in regard to the cord...I haven&#x27;t had any issues with it, but it seems hard rather than flexible...hopefully it is durable.</li>
    <li> Light therapy really works for your skin... I had owned 2 previous tools that i purchased elsewhere and altho i liked what the light did the tools did not hold up.. They broke ... And they were much more expensive and i couldn&#x27;t change the light heads.. I love that feature about this one... So far so good for me with this one....i like it....</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a sucker, tried this out with no results after regular use. The time required to do the treatments is not worth wasting along with the money this thing costs.</li>
    <li> I just received this gadget yesterday when I got home from work. Excitedly I opened the package. (Be careful cause if you open the wrong end and pull out the contents it doesn&#x27;t have a top cover and I dropped one of the colored discs. oopsy!!!) It didn&#x27;t break, but I was mad it was exposed like that.&lt;br /&gt;I am 42 years old and since stopping the pill 10 years ago I have had breakouts, some small and some erratic mostly hormonal I believe. Recently though for the last couple of months I have broken out on my chin like crazy. I get rid of one and another 2 pop up. sometimes they are clusters of two or three that make one big zit!! UGH!! my jawline also is affected once in awhile as well.&lt;br /&gt;In fact, last night I noticed two more nice size ones were popping up. I just could not take it anymore. I should be thinking of wrinkles at my age not zits!! I can&#x27;t even use that stuff cause I seem to break out. For awhile I was using peroxide on a cotton ball to stop the spreading on my chin. It helped for a while the it just had no effect. I use potato juice sometimes also and it helps if you catch them early enough or use the juice as a compress.&lt;br /&gt;I now have scarring all over my chin, can&#x27;t wait to see that disappear!!&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I showered before I went to bed used alba deep clean astringent to remove dirt and makeup that seeps into the pores and patted my skin. Wiped off the discs with alcohol and of course I put on goggles I bought to protect my eyes from the UV and bright lights.(the sunbed goggles, peepers)I used it according to the direction, starting with the blue-light, then green then the red. That was my preference. Not sure if there is an order they recommend cause I didn&#x27;t notice one. It takes time to do all together and when I woke up this morning I gave it another zap for three minutes on my chin only on pulse mode, did my regular routine with lotion and make-up.&lt;br /&gt;It is noon now and I just looked in the mirror and felt those zits that were popping through ( they were gonna be whoppers) and I can honestly tell you they have been reduced in size!! WOO HOO!!! I am so thankful I took the chance with this product. It was hard. It was a little pricey, but well could be worth it. So far so good. There were also only three reviews on this when I purchased but I did like what they said and I am giving it a shot. I will post again in a week or two and hopefully with the same great feedback.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Okay...I received this thing last Tuesday. Today is Thursday the following week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is awesome. My chin is about 85% cleared up. The bumps are almost completely flat. I have been only using the blue and green discs. The red can wait.&lt;br /&gt;Even the hyper pigmentation is clearing. I think at this rate it should be completely cleared in two weeks or hopefully less.&lt;br /&gt;I have been treating my face with both applications once morning and night since I got the thing. Their recommendation is 3-4 times a week but I am and was desperate for results. I did skip a am or pm once or twice. Still excellent results. Once they are cleared I will go to using 2-3 times a week and start using the Red disc for fine lines and wrinkles.</li>
    <li> I have acne problem and I have used Tanda Zap before, which also uses blue light and worked for me. So I bought this device since it&#x27;s a lot cheaper than Tanda Clear+. I have only used the blue light in the system and it&#x27;s very effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing I&#x27;d like to point out is, I don&#x27;t use it as the instruction said, rotate blabla... I just put it on my face where I have pimples, for 6 min, and then move to another area. This is actually what I do when I use Tanda device. I don&#x27;t believe in the rotate clockwise counterclockwise crap, just put it on your area that has acne for at least 6 min, other wise it won&#x27;t be very effective. My pimples get smaller on the next day and disappeared on the 3rd or 4th day if I treat it for 6 min/day.</li>
    <li> So many good machines available these days.  This one is great.  It may work like a lazier, but it doesn&#x27;t&lt;br /&gt;burn your skin.  It head is for a different purpose.  Remove those fine line Ladies!  If you are younger, it work&lt;br /&gt;for breakouts on your skin and dries them up.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve suffered from rosacea since I was a teenager, and with numerous acne scars my skin looked like the surface of the moon. After using the light for two months all I can say is WOW! This system worked like a charm. My skin looks brighter, healthier, my acne is gone, and my skin looks smooth. I am more confident now, and I can show off my beautiful skin to the world. I would recommend this to everyone who wants to have beautiful skin.</li>
    <li> After years of problems of sever acne I have tried everything. I&#x27;ve been to many dermatologists and prescribed so many washes and antibiotics and still couldn&#x27;t get rid of it. After watching the Bethanny Show on tv, I saw her dermatologist cure 2 women of chronic acne! So I decided to call that Doctor in New York and see what exactly he had done for them. I live about 2hrs away from NY so it was pointless to try seeing him cause it would take countless visits. The practitioner suggested to buy the Sirius SS-77 Aurora Light System! I did and it has changed my life! Not only does it work but it also is soothing and calming. I use the blue head and the red. I haven&#x27;t used the green yet. The doctor&#x27;s office also suggested trying accutane. I haven&#x27;t started it yet cause I want to see if the Aurora is all I need. Anyone with cystic acne is crazy not to give this a try!</li>
    <li> Bought this through a groupon and product stopped working before 90 days. Groupon just tells me to contact Sirius and they can not do anything about it. I have been trying to reach customer service for two weeks now and no one seems to care. No reply so far, neither by phone or email. Terrible experience with both groupon and Sirius!</li>
    <li> After one night the timer broke!. I was hoping it would work....I asked for a refund, and they deducted $11.00. you would think that for somethig that didn&#x27;t work, you would get your money back...oh well, hard lesson</li>
    <li> Around the time I went to college, I began to develop cystic acne.  It seemed to come on around the time of my period and would take forever to go away.  I can say that I had tried everything under the sun to treat it.  This is the only thing that has gotten rid of the cystic form of my acne.  The only problem is that you have to be super consistent with it.  I have to use it every other day.</li>
    <li> I bought this item at end of March and have used it about every day. I most generally use all three of the lights. It seems like the hyperpigmentation on my cheeks have lightened. The past month every time I go to use it the unit shuts off unexpectedly causing me to have to turn it back on. Now as of July 14, 2015 it will not even turn on. I am very disappointed with this. I would have expected this to last much longer. I want to buy a different LED light system but not sure which one, don&#x27;t want end up with another ineffective product</li>
    <li> Works beautifully on your skin if you are dedicated to a regime of holding the light to your skin (maybe when you are relaxing or watching T.V). The green light feature lightened up my dark spots quite a bit. However, there seems to be a problem with the cord because after a while, the light keeps going off prematurely. I love the light but I think the cord needs be to be improved. I also think that a cordless model would be so much handier.</li>
    <li> The Sirius Lights System is very relaxing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price is great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3 color lights&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Blinking Mode and Continues Mode&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Auto Power Off&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks!</li>
    <li> I am not sold on this product, the green light stopped working after two weeks. When I contacted them about the product, I never heard back from them. Regretting my purchase.</li>
    <li> I am 48 and have some sagging  under the eyes, pigmentation from the sun, and larger pores from oily skin. I have used this system with the red and blue lights for about a month and can see a huge difference. My pores are almost invisible and my skin really has a &amp;#34;glow&amp;#34; to it. The sagging under the eyes is greatly reduced and laugh lines around my mouth are much less noticeable. I am really impressed that such a small handheld device could pack such a wallop in terms of results.  It is easy to hold and  use; in some respects it would be easier if it were not handheld,but then it would not be portable so I can&#x27;t complain.  Very pleased and would buy again. .Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> great at keeping my adult acne at bay. the red light is great for fine lines . i really had doubted it would be such a great product. the other ones similar are so high priced, but this is really nice. i worked at salon and make up artistry for years. must have. use regularly. product came quicker than they said it would. everything in order. i shop amazon because of it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for about three weeks, and now have considerable swelling on my bottom lip, up over my top lip, and more so under my bottom lip. I&#x27;m now afraid to continue using it. I have only used it for half of the suggested amount of minutes, not the 24 minutes suggested, and only twice a week, and have kept it moving in a clockwise direction.&lt;br /&gt; I so wanted to try it for fine lines and small non-active acne bumps. Would appreciate hearing from from anybody else who may have had these kinds of problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After posting this I&#x27;ve done more research and believe that some of the swelling was caused by using tooth whitening strips, but made worse by the use of the LED device.&lt;br /&gt;I will cease using both and then use one at a time to determine which is the most responsible. Just be careful if you use the strong white strips and then use the LED device.</li>
    <li> It is very time consuming, and you have to use it on a daily basis to really see results. After using it for about 3 months it stopped working, and now i have no use for it. I would have loved to continue using it if they had not send me a defective unit.</li>
    <li> Other then the awful customer service and therefore not knowing if I am doing this in the most efficient manner for my skin conditions, the product works fine and seems to be helping the tone(brighter) and texture(firmer) of my skin. Once in a while the red light will shut off on me but it always turns back on.  As far as acne goes, I still break out at different times of the month, but overall there is less redness and reactive break outs then before I started using this. It&#x27;s been about 2-3 weeks of using so far, almost every day(supposed to wait 24 hrs in between tx&#x27;s) or every other day, so time and patience are a huge factor if you are going to buy this and want fast results.  I have not used the green light yet but will use it on the sun damage on my shoulders and back once my face is under control from the other two lights. I do use a ton of supplements for my skin and top quality products so I cannot say for sure which has been helping the most, but the combination of everything has given me noticeable results.</li>
    <li> If used as directed, you should see results. My acne has improved dramatically. I tried many things and this has helped. I also use the red light, it is supposed to increase collagen to lessen wrinkles, I have noticed it plumps my lips as well. I am hoping to eventually lessen my use of benzoyl peroxide products once my skin is completely under control. I have been using this for over a month, there are instant results that fade between uses but it seems like I make small gains that are more significant with each week.</li>
    <li> I think I saw results from the first treatment and my skin tone definitely looks more like it did when I was younger.  Can&#x27;t wait to see if the green light diminishes the large freckles I got from using a tanning bed 25 years ago.</li>
    <li> I used this for a few months but wouldn&#x27;t say it was much use.  It&#x27;s made with cheap and flimsy materials and become unusable after I accidentally sat on it.  Even when the product was brand new, rubbing the light disc to close to your body would cause the electrical connections to short and stop the program.  If you were in the middle of a timed therapy session you had to start over not knowing where you left off.</li>
    <li> I used this for less than 30 days, and one day it wouldn&#x27;t turn on, so I returned it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m also wary that they included a green head - there hasn&#x27;t really been the research to show that green LEDs do anything for your skin, good or bad.</li>
    <li> I saw no improvements at all.  Very time consuming too. And much too expensive. I would not buy it again.</li>
    <li> Finally, after trying lots of creams and lotions with no results and then happily stumbling upon this system I have blemish free, smooth, healthy and glowing skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s easy to use and the seller delivered it super fast. I am very impressed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m happy that it is non-invasive and subtle, although I was concerned at first that it wasn&#x27;t actually going to do anything, but even though I&#x27;ve only been using it a matter of weeks I have seen solid results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love the fact it is portable and I can use this &amp;#34;on the go&amp;#34; and work it in to my day. It also has long-lasting and durable treatment panels so unlike creams that you have to constantly buy, or other treatments that don&#x27;t last long, this will just keep on going.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t recommend enough!</li>
    <li> I called Sirius customer service and they are the worst.  I needed to replace the electrical cord which was faulty and they kept promising they would send it and never did even after several inquiries and even though it was covered under warranty.  Meanwhile, I read from other Amazon customers that they had good customer service from LightStim, their competitors, which had no problem sending them a power cord free of charge.  Sirius product is good but if you have a problem with the unit, your on your own!</li>
    <li> We bought this for my father who has diabetic neuropathy in both feet.  He has been going to an outpatient PT for a few weeks with little to no improvement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We found this product and have started using it.  After the first treatment pain has gone down considerably.  After two weeks protective sensation has been restored in a few locations and is getting better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The rehab is considering getting some for their patients at this point.  My dad has been able to cut down on some meds and can sleep and move around a lot better.  Very thankful and I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using it for about 2-3 weeks now and I love it! I&#x27;m breaking out less and my skin is healing faster than before! Sure the treatment sessions are a little long (24 min), but the results are worth it.</li>
    <li> I had modern acne and the light therapy system did a great job of clearing my acne. However, after two month the light device stopped working. This is my second device. And both devices stopped working. Very disappointing and waste of money. No customer support from the company and no warranty.</li>
    <li> green light seems to have a effect on skin. I like it</li>
    <li> I am a licensed esthetician and bought the Aurora at the Face &amp; Body Show more than a year ago. First off, it WORKS! I am very impressed with the results I have seen. In addition, I am very pleased by the company&#x27;s customer service. Shortly after purchasing the unit, it stopped working and even after trying some of the suggestions customer service provided - it would not work. I was ready to send it back when I found that a new unit was sent to me! Since then the unit has not failed me and again, I am so pleased with my results! Thank you for an affordable and extremely effective at-home treatment!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Katelyn</li>
    <li> I have not had a chance to use it as frequently as I would like but I did use the blue light on my daughter who had some acne and it helped her.</li>
    <li> It works great on pimples! If I start to get one and sit there and zap one spot for a  few minutes (with the blue light) it&#x27;s gone or mostly gone the next day. I haven&#x27;t noticed the other lights making any changes yet but I haven&#x27;t been using it as much as recommended either.  It is time consuming but you can watch tv while your doing it so it&#x27;s not too bad.</li>
    <li> This product is the best I’ve tried and it’s completely safe. I was a little scared to try this since it was new to me but I’m so glad I did. My skin is so much smoother looking since using it. Not only did it clear up my acne and shrink my pores, but it also made my wrinkles less apparent. It also gives my skin a nice even tone by getting rid of any discoloration. I like the large surface area making it easier to use on my whole face. I want to keep my skin young looking as long as possible and this is the best anti aging product I’ve tried.</li>
    <li> Even though I&#x27;ve seen substantial improvement in how my skin looks overall, I was really impressed what the Aurora did for my crow&#x27;s feet. Also, I really enjoyed using the device. It&#x27;s really easy and doesn&#x27;t feel like a chore. Very happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> This product does make your skin look healthier, but I can&#x27;t see any difference in the fine lines. If you want if for healthier looking skin this is for you.</li>
    <li> Black Male in late 20s who doesn&#x27;t have horrible acne or breakouts but discoloration (from years of bad products and no direction) and small bumps here or there that become very noticeable on my light skin.  I first got this right before I went overseas for work for 3 months.  Cool little led lights seemed to keep my skin in check more than anything else without drying it out, making it worse, or turning my face red.  The plastic cover over the leds seem sturdy enough, I&#x27;ve dropped them a few times and they haven&#x27;t shattered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So after doing my time consuming routine I just put a tea tree oil on afterwards (right after or the next morning) or proactiv green tea moisturizer and go about my business.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;I literally do get tired of holding this thing...  Check my timing per light.  AGAIN PER LIGHT&lt;br /&gt;Forehead - 3 locations (9mins)&lt;br /&gt;Cheeks - 2 locations per side (12mins)&lt;br /&gt;Mouth area - 1 location (3mins)&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes the side of my eye (temples) - 1 location per side (6mins)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think in the instructions it recommended 6inches from face... That honestly wasn&#x27;t effective for me, didn&#x27;t see much of a result so I repositioned it 1in from my face (this might also account for why I have to do so many locations) but it worked a lot better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also I think this might be a lil steeply priced... 89 is what I paid when I it should be more around the tune of 49 at the most... That&#x27;s just considering all you have is a simple adapter, a flasher in the hand unit, and then 3 plastic led heads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line - if you are a person with a big face (like myself) There are some units out there that are full face... kind of like a makeup mirror of some sort with leds lined throughout it.  I believe that&#x27;d be much shorter and much more effective.  Otherwise I would recommend this product to ppl with smaller faces.</li>
    <li> I started seeing resuts about 5 days .to achieve the maximum benefits you have to be consisstant. But most beauty products require some form of regiment and I think this device is a great tool to keep near .I bought mine after reading several reveiws I had already decided on one then I saw the Sirius Aurora , I am currently using it with a laser treatment and in about a month I hope I can tell you how it goes RJB</li>
    <li> I was very disappointed by by this device.  It did not make any difference.  I used it every day without fail,  It is very time consuming which if it worked I would not mind but it does not.  The reason I made this purchase was because I had used light therapy at a professional salon which worked well for me but was far too expensive and I could not sustain the expense I thought the Sirius would be ideal because it seemed to be the same idea but unfortunately It has been complete waste of time and money for me.</li>
    <li> This was my first time purchasing a light therapy system, after spending hundreds of dollars to get light therapy done at the spa,I decided to get a home kit. When the Aurora arrived I tried it out right away. I did the light therapy for an hour and continued daily until I saw results. I&#x27;m 15 days in and I have noticed fading fine lines around my eyes and mouth, I also have a problem area on my chin from where I use to acne terribly and those dark spots have started to fade as well. I&#x27;m really impressed with my Aurora  and I have told several family members and friends about the product so they can use it. If two weeks of using the Aurora has already faded fine lines and dark spots then I cant wait to see my skin after a month. I highly recommend this product to anyone who wants to reduce wrinkles and dark hyper pigmentation! Great product!.</li>
    <li> The Aurora Light Therapy seems to work well, although it may be to soon for actual results. It arrived quickly and it was a great value for the price.</li>
    <li> It was a surprise gift for my daughter in December 2012.  She is in her late 30s and was complaining about how her face was showing signs of aging--sagging, loss of skin quality and texture--and she was not at all happy about it.  A friend had bought a Sirius and was thrilled with it, so I decided to buy one for my daughter as a surprise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since my daughter received the Sirius, she&#x27;s been using it at least 2-3 times a week.  Today, people tell her that she looks 10 years younger and they can&#x27;t figure out what she has been doing to look so great.  You can really see the difference in the texture and quality of her skin.  This machine has even repaired sagging in the jowls and her &amp;#34;smile lines&amp;#34; around her mouth as well.  It&#x27;s hard to believe the improvements until you see photos taken a year ago compared to the photos today.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She has rosacea as well, and discovered that alternating the blue and red gave her dramatic results in greatly reducing that problem.  The redness and the tiny bumps that often come with rosacea--all reduced by a good 99.9%.  She truly loves the results!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since she lives out of state, I don&#x27;t get to see her in person often, but every time I do, I can see her face getting better and better.  It is truly a slow process that you won&#x27;t notice for months.  She says the key to seeing improvement is consistency.  Without using it every other day or so, she tells me that you won&#x27;t see the changes occur. It&#x27;s a beauty commitment, and you MUST follow the directions--and it will work!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The best thing to do to see the improvement yourself is to take photos of your face every week  on the same day, same place, same background, same lighting, same outfit--for 6 months to a year (she bought a blue piece of poster board and posed with no makeup on a chair--taking photos of the front and both sides of the face and the neck).  THEN in several months compare the first photos you took--with the current ones.  If you have used Sirius consistently, you WILL see the visible difference!  Don&#x27;t get discouraged, it takes time to repair the damage!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Today, she says it&#x27;s the BEST gift she ever received!</li>
    <li> I received this item yesterday.  It worked fine the first time and I had very high hopes, but when I tried to use it today, nothing.  Checked all the connections, checked the power outlet, and it doesn&#x27;t work.  When I looked it over more closely I could see scuff marks on the handle and other signs of wear on the unit.  It&#x27;s obviously used/reconditioned.  Sending it back.  Combined with some of the other negative reviews I&#x27;ve seen I think I&#x27;ll consider this a red flag and look for a different product.</li>
    <li> I got this mostly for acne.  I have never used the red light other than checking that it works.  I only use the blue light (almost every day) and the green every other day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve battled with acne all my life, tried all sort of different things, etc.  This light did NOT make my acne disappear, but it shortens considerably the pimple life-cycle.  I used to get these cysts that would brew deep under my skin for weeks.  When they did finally surface it would take days to heal after I popped them.  With the light use the whiteheads come to the surface within 1-2 days, and after I pop them they heal within another day or two.  (please no lectures about popping pimples!).  Smaller pimples either disappear or mature and die within 2 days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using the green light for a while only on one area where I have pigmentation, just to see if it works.  So far I haven&#x27;t seen any results.  I probably won&#x27;t stick to it for long since as other reviewers have said, this is very time consuming.  If they could come up with one filter that does all three colors at once, it would be great :D&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all I&#x27;m pleased with the unit and its price (got this from groupon).  No miracles though!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t see a difference, but didn&#x27;t get to use it long enough before the lights burnt out on one side. Expensive, time consuming and hard to sit still with eyes closed while rubbing this around your face for 20 minutes.</li>
    <li> Just an observation, reviews written before the 27th are pretty bad...I&#x27;d take the new reviews with a grain of salt.</li>
    <li> Great price and works like a gem. Best brand out there and I would buy it again for a friend.</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t be happier with this product. My daughter has been using one we ordered last year for her acne. Her cousin borrowed it for his acne and loved it. I told him to keep it and we ordered another. When I was ordering I noticed a review a lady had wrote about using the red light on her dads feet for neuropathy. My mom has that problem not only in her feet but also her legs and hips, so I ordered one for her too. She has been using it for a month now. It has made such a difference in the pain and movement of her legs &amp; hips. She actually attended my nephews soccer game. (something she would never have dreamed of doing before, it would be too painful) It has really changed her life.</li>
    <li> Seems to work.  Less convenient than &amp;#34;panel LED systems&amp;#34; that you can treat passively with, but if you are okay with carving 30 minutes out of your day to do some preventative maintenance on yourself. I can&#x27;t say anything against this product.  It just works.</li>
    <li> I personally own this product and recommend it to my clients.  As an esthetician, I use blue LED light therapy for acne, but to see the most benefit, one has to use it regularly, not just during facial services.  It&#x27;s an affordable home treatment that, with regular use, will give you firmer, clearer, brighter skin.</li>
    <li> So far so good, I like the 3 different heads and would recommend using goggles or an eye mask since the lights are very bright</li>
    <li> I returned this item, it takes a LONG time to use it with each separate light and I really don&#x27;t have the time..&lt;br /&gt;Used this only a couple times, think this would be best for someone who would be willing to invest a lot of time into getting some results&lt;br /&gt;For someone like me, I need just serums/ topicals that work faster and take last time to just slap it on...</li>
    <li> This is tough - really wanted to like this.  Have used it for several months now - I will admit I am not the best at doing anything really consistently, so take my review with a grain of salt.  I got this mostly for the acne blue light, though I use the others sometimes.  I while I do think my skin is somewhat better, I do not think it is miraculous.  It is easy to use, and I will go after my skin with the light when I break out (which I still do in my 30&#x27;s), and I do think the breakouts clear up faster now with the light.  I got it for a good price, so I would say for any improvement in skin I think it&#x27;s worth it.  It does take a long time if you&#x27;re going to use all 3 lights; not bad if only doing one.</li>
    <li> The first Sirius Aurora I was shipped didn&#x27;t work. It did take a few email with their customer service to have it replaced and it was very FRUSTRATING! However, I did eventually get a replacement and I am shocked and very pleased with how well it works! I had acne, acne scaring  (from the age of 12)and some pretty dark hyper-pigmentation/melasma on my face, as well as a lack of tone starting at my jaw line (I&#x27;m 45).  I have tired Tri-Luma cream, Retin A, Azelic Acid etc..all from my doctor as well as MANY OTC products. Nothing worked very well or had lasting results. I started using this in November and my acne is all but gone (Jan. 20). I do get the occasional breakout but one treatment with the blue light usually clears it up within one day. My scaring, hyper-pigmentation and melasma have improved at least 80% with use of the green light, (If you have discoloration on your face you KNOW how HUGE this is!) and the lack of tone in my lower jaw line and under my chin is much less noticeable with use of the red light. I am truly shocked at how well this thing works!  I thought I was stuck with \\&quot;bad skin\\&quot; for the rest of my life. I am very happy to say this does work! It does take time and commitment to do the treatments every other day at first..now only twice a week but it&#x27;s worth it. It&#x27;s totally painless and simple to use.  A side note: My husband thought there was no way it was going to work but he knew how much the appearance of my skin bothered me so he told me to go for it. About a month into my treatments one Sunday morning having coffee..sans Makeup..he started really checking out my skin and said \\&quot;Wow, your skin IS better\\&quot;. Now he tells me quite often how clear my skin looks:) People at work have noticed I&#x27;ve \\&quot;done something\\&quot; or say I \\&quot;glow\\&quot;. That&#x27;s pretty cool for someone who was so self-conscious about her skin for so long! If you&#x27;re sitting on the fence..TRY IT!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m in my mid forty&#x27;s and experiencing life changes.  All the sudden I started having acne break outs.  The doctor said it is from pre menopause.  I have tried lotions, creams, facial washes and antibiotics.  I was desperate and a friend told me about the Sirius.  I’ve been using the product for almost two months and I can see visible changes.  My skin feels smoother and I am noticing that the acne on my chin is starting to disappear.</li>
    <li> I am giving  2 starts because it only works from Oct 2013 until today, 7/13/2014, not even 8 months.&lt;br /&gt;However, for as long as it was working it served its pupose.  My skin was visibily clearer with even skin toned.  What it claims it does is all true.  I just wish it lasts longer than 8 months.  I used it 3 times a week during the first 3 weeks because my ANSR stopped working after 2.5 years that&#x27;s 30 months).  ANSR did fulfilled its promises and it died after the stated amount of hours of usage.  I paid about $150 for that.  So, with the price of Aurora Light Therapy System, and if it only works 8 months more or less, it should only charge us $150*(8/30)&#x3D; $40.  Granted it also has a green light which ANSR doens&#x27;t, I&#x27;ll be willing to throw in another $10.  So, this thing should cost us around $50 or less.  I am writing to Amazon.com for a replacement or a refund.  I am not happy with the ultra short lifespan of this system with the money I paid.</li>
    <li> As many others have stated you are supposed to use it every other day for about 26 mins per light. If you wanted to do all three (red, blue and green) it would obviously be over an hour. But it does clear up your complexion. I haven&#x27;t noticed any discernible difference to wrinkles though. You do get a nice glow the day or two after using it. Would recommend if you are willing to put in the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Others have said you can&#x27;t do anything else while using it. I have found you can watch TV or play with the iPad in a limited fashion. Certainly cuts down on what you can do but if you are going to watch something, and your significant other doesn&#x27;t mind the bright flashing (at times) lights, then you certainly can do both.</li>
    <li> The jury is still out on this one.  Looks promising.</li>
    <li> love it!!! it works very good for my skin.</li>
    <li> I have used the NuFace attachment with the &amp;#34;red&amp;#34; light.  It did not work....not sure whether it was because it had to be charged and it did maintain its charge well.  Sirius is a plug in and the charge remains consistent.  It is a great buy because not only does it come with a red light, but also a blue (for acne) and a green (for discoloration).  I would highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I was using it and it really does work. I did see results that I was happy with. I moved and got out of the habit now that I wrote this review Im going to get it back out and use it again. I have rosacea and I do everything that Im not suposed to do and I have young skin and Im 49. I do salicylic acid peels and it keeps the rosacea under control. I find when I treat my skin delicately I break out and it get terrible again. I use almond oil just a drop for moisturizer under some powder then just eyeliner and lipstick eyeshadow and mascara no foundation. I get some sun in the summer and that helps and in the winter the almond oil helps and the salicylic acid gets the the red off my nose and cheeks and any acne. This light therapy makes my skin smooth and plump. But believe me I have been around the block with my skin and this has worked believe it or not.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m extremely careful with light hitting my skin (I&#x27;m an OCD esthetician for nearly 20 years), but I&#x27;ve moved to AZ last year and get tan through my hat and tinted windows even with sunscreen on-it&#x27;s absolutely crazy.  Anyway, I developed some hyperpigmentation on my cheekbones, and my skin is pretty sensitized, so peels or IPL are too strong for me.  The right side is less hyperpigmented due probably to driving, but I can&#x27;t really even see the spots anymore on that side, and the left side has definitely faded so I am happy with my results so far.  I&#x27;ve only treated it a few times (I just use the non-blinking light since the blinking one drives me batty). I think with these devices it is important to not let them get too hot, since heat will increase inflammation which is the source of hyperpigmentation, and also to follow the directions, i.e. treat every other day.  It gets pretty hot and is painfully bright (be sure protect your eyes with this one) compared to my Evis Red LED, which is why I only gave it 4 stars. Keep in mind that for darker, long-standing hp this may only make a dent.  Photos are always better than the eye so I would take some-you&#x27;ll be surprised.  IPL is still the gold standard for hp and Mandelic acid seems to be promising especially for dermal/hormonal hp, which is hard to treat with a lot of other acids.  I do believe keeping the liver healthy has an effect on hp in general (liver spots are maybe called liver spots for a reason) which makes sense considering the vast amounts of hormones it synthesizes, and to keep it from returning being very strict is essential which a lot of people can&#x27;t commit to.  One has to decide what&#x27;s more important, fun in the sun or bright skin- Hope this was helpful!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for 3 month now. I don&#x27;t see any result. Don&#x27;t waste your money. After a while you will get tired and just stop.</li>
    <li> It helps but it takes so long to do my whole face that I got tired of using it. I wish it covered more area at a time. I will try to start using it again.</li>
    <li> OK I bought this in a fit of panic. I am  fair skinned, early 40&#x27;s,  and always  been told I had had fairly great skin, since I am careful about sunscreen, have used ROC Retin A for years and don&#x27;t tan,  but lately I have been noticing  that the  wear  was really  starting to show in my face in ruddiness, sagging, redness, fine lines and a tired look. I didn&#x27;t want to do botox, not my scene,  and I was kind of scared of IPL or lasers, since the $150 I could afford for it  meant it would not be performed by a  Board certified lisenced plastic  surgeon.... so.... I ordered this on semi- impulse,  after some research, then immediately felt like a vain ass.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The customer service is NOT very communicative. It took them several  weeks to ship, and they did not offer tracking info until I bugged them for it.&lt;br /&gt;When I use it, it makes me feel like an insane vain person as if I am Norma Desmond  in Sunset Boulevard. The lights are bright and it tales a long time to do my whole face.&lt;br /&gt;  I would DEFINITELY recommend  using protective eyewear like the kind for sunbeds, to protect your eyes.  The treatment area is large, so its awkward on my nose, for example. I block off  the extra light as best I can with cloth and my hands, but its rather inconvenient. You can sort of read or sort of watch a movie while using it, you can surf the net with it, do emails, I bet lame TV would be good with it, but anything else is kind of a no go.&lt;br /&gt;BUT....&lt;br /&gt; It works.&lt;br /&gt;I have used it 6 times, with all 3 lights. Apparently its best to use the red first, then the green, so I use blue after. I used it 3X the first week 2 days apart, skipped 5 days because of my crazy work schedule, then used  2X this week, 5 days apart&lt;br /&gt; Anyways  I  noticed a difference after my second use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;green light: I used the green light on an age spot that I had on my chest, and it is fading- slowly, but noticibly. It&#x27;s not gone all the  way but I expect it will be soon. My fair skinis getting very even toned and just radiant. A lot of the facial blotchiness I had  is  leaving.  I feel like I can use less makeup now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; red light :&lt;br /&gt;I have seen my forehead wrinkles and the line between my eyebrows  lessen considerably.  Like 3-4 years taken off.&lt;br /&gt;I am not seeing so much change in the lines around my eyes, but perhaps it will take more time.&lt;br /&gt; I have been using on my jawline and I see an improved jawline, less sagging. It is subtle, probably others would not notice it, but I notice it.&lt;br /&gt;I have some broken capillaries but they are not changing so far, if they do I will update.&lt;br /&gt;Overall my face is starting to look plumper and more youthful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Blue light- I have dry skin so its not much of an issue for me, but I had the occasional hormonal pimple and my pores were getting larger with age. But wow the blue light works on  the pores so they become invisible. Hormonal breakouts are ZAPPED. If I had oily skin this would be great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; So- yes I felt vain and crazy using it, and  yes the changes are subtle, probably others would not notice them- yet. But I know I look better and I am curious to see  how it will work over more time. The results persist, like I didn&#x27;t do it for 5 days, but the results lasted. I will update later if I get more action from it.&lt;br /&gt;I am not giving it 5 stars since the customer service is so  bad, and I haven&#x27;t  had it for long enough to get super dramatic results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like right now I&#x27;d say I feel better its a nice personal  thing,  Its definitely boosting my confidence, I think its taken like 2 years off so far but no one else is telling me I look amazing.&lt;br /&gt;If I can remove my age spot with it, and I see more facial improvements over time, i will revisit this review and let you know.&lt;br /&gt; ALSO FYI I don&#x27;t use product on my face when I use it, just bare clean skin, I do use a vitamin C serum after  and  ROC Retin A on days I don&#x27;t use it  and had no ill effects,I actually  feel like they all enhance each other.&lt;br /&gt; Hope this helps.  I am NOT a shill I am a real person. (-:</li>
    <li> Easy to use &amp; seems to be working on acne &amp; skin tone even tho I don&#x27;t use it as regularly as they suggest. Delivery was quick.</li>
    <li> I really hope I got a bum product. It wouldn&#x27;t turn on after a few days of use. I&#x27;ve sent two emails and left a voice mail message, but haven&#x27;t heard anything after two days. That being said,  it is the holidays so people are busy. This does seem to really do what they say. It does take a lot of time. I was tired of shelling out money for topical products that don&#x27;t do a thing. I already saw more results with this than all the topicals. I will update if I hear back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;update 12/31/12 i got my new system in the mail today. It&#x27;s working well. Use the red light first, helps blue and green absorb better (per Sirius CS).</li>
    <li> Worked very well on my dark spots! Would highly recommend!</li>
    <li> This product was not the quality that i expected and to be honest i dint expect good result. However, i used the sirius ss-77 aurora light as directed and got results in as little as two weeks. I would definitely recommend this product to anyone that suffers from hyper pigmentation and acne but you have to use it on a ritualistic bases. i promise the results are well worth the money.</li>
    <li> I was lucky enough to order the Sirius Aurora light from Amazon whilst holidaying in America Just before going to America Ihad a procedure called Airgent which cost over $3,000au. and was a complete waste of money leaving my skin worse off Since using my Sirius Aurora light my skin is glowing, softer than it has been in years Can&#x27;t believe for such a small price this beats expensive procedures hands down Also instruction manual is great and delivered expediently Thankyou.</li>
    <li> I bought this after reading the reviews. I tried Googling, Bing-ing and trudging up every review I could find before I spend the cash, but this was the only spot where people seemed to leave some good feedback. Regardless, I was really skeptical it would work for me, because the only thing that&#x27;s ever worked on my skin is dermatologist prescribed topical creams or peels. Well, hey, I thought I&#x27;d give it a shot. Background: I have very fair, combo oily/dry skin with mild to medium breakouts and scarring. I&#x27;m 25 years old. Not sure if that matters, but everyone else seemed a little more mature in their reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Red filter- Used it once so far. I noticed that my skin looked less red and splotchy afterwards. Plan to use it again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Green filter- Honestly... It says it&#x27;s for hyperpigmentation, but I didn&#x27;t notice any difference. Used it once. Maybe that&#x27;s the problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Blue filter- UN-FREAKING-REAL. I actually can&#x27;t believe it. It worked the very first time and I can&#x27;t stop using it. Like I said, I have mild to medium breakouts depending on how much I sweat working out, time of month, etc. and this stopped my zits after 1 use. The day this delivered, I had a huge zit forming on my nose- it really hurt to touch it and it was swollen. I used the blue filter exactly like the directions said, and it was LITERALLY GONE. I mean, gone. The spot where it was became flat, all the redness was gone and it didn&#x27;t hurt at all. I thought to myself, \\&quot;Wait until the morning and see if this actually worked.\\&quot; Still gone. I am not kidding. I&#x27;ve used it the most of all the lenses. I usually lay in bed and watch t.v. through my tanning-glasses-things (which I bought for $1.82 on Amazon for this, and you really need them) and use the tool.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Per another reviewer, you look really crazy using it. However, if you don&#x27;t use it for the full 24 minutes, you&#x27;re not going to get the best results. So don&#x27;t feel bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The tool itself looks and feels a little cheap. You have to leave it plugged in while using it, but the cord it long enough that you could use it anywhere and be comfortable. It is really bright and you need the tanning-goggle-things. Don&#x27;t go without, the light can be really annoying and I get paranoid about burning something into my cornea.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, in closing, if acne is your main problem, save up for your cash and get this. You will not regret it. If you&#x27;re looking for aging/hyperpigmentation help, you might want to stick to the dermatologist&#x27;s office.</li>
    <li> This product does work but the improvement is subtle and using the device is very time-consuming (doing it while watching TV or checking e-mail helps pass the time).  My face and under my chin are somewhat firmer,  and my hyperpigmentation has faded somewhat (I need to use less make-up to cover it up).  I will probably continue to use it for the firming, but there are other things that work faster to fade my hyperpigmentation (such as retin-a and tca peels).</li>
    <li> Love this!  I had ordered a cheaper light therapy device a couple of months ago, and I wish I had just saved my money for this one.  Easy to understand instructions.  Easy to use.  Love the pulsating feature!  I also really like that it has a timer, so you know when to move the device to another spot.  I know I am leaving the device on one spot long enough to be effective.  Also this is big enough, I can use it on some stretchmarks.  Does take a while, if you are using all three panels, and when you use the pulsating, you can&#x27;t really do anything but sit with your eyes closed, but that is just 3 minutes. I am already seeing improvments.  Well worth the money!</li>
    <li> I am an african american woman and I&#x27;m 35 years old. I used to have acne but I don&#x27;t any longer. I do have Seboreheic Dermatitis though and it makes my skin look like an orange from time to time...making it red and lumpy. My pores were extremely large too. Additionally, I had developed acne scarring from the past and hyperpigmentation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this product over a year ago and used it for a short period of time. And stopped. It seemed that the blue light made my acne worse...so I thought. At any rate, I recently started using it again because I became fed up with my skin and figured nothing could be worse than what it is now. I had severe dark areas around my mouth, under eyes, and hairline, redness from the dermatitis, and larger than normal pores. After using (all three lights) for about a week, my skin glowed like you wouldn&#x27;t believe. Then 2-3 weeks after using it, I noticed that the skin around my mouth was substantially lighter. So much so that you could see the circle tattoo from where I used to hold the device without moving it which was the wrong way to do it. But this went away fairly quickly after I began using it correctly. Now my skin looks noticeably more even. (visit their website to learn how to use it correctly)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the things that I noticed is that after awhile the glow seemed to be fading. So I decided to incorporate a scrub into my weekly regimen. That was the best thing I could have done because the results really REALLY came through after sloughing off all that dead skin! Its been about a month now since I started using all three. My acne scars are still present but much lighter. The hyperpigmentation is still there but much lighter but you can barely tell its there when I put my makeup on. AS a matter of fact, sometimes when I&#x27;m looking in the mirror, my skin glows so much that I think that I left foundation on my face from the night before. My pores look smaller but that may be due to the medicine I use from my doctorhelping out a little too which is to stop my skin from flairing. The blue light doesn&#x27;t flair my skin up like it was. It actually helps my skin to not be as red. And the red light seems to tighten my eyes. It doesn&#x27;t bother me as much as some people when I hold the device over my eyes without goggles while my eyes are closed (not sure if this will have negative results in the future though).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think I have seen results from all three lights but my favorite is the green because its like a natural skin peel. Its only been about a 4-5 weeks but I feel confident that with continued use, I will see my skin even out completely. I&#x27;ve gotten my first compliment on my skin about a week ago--I can&#x27;t tell you the last time that&#x27;s happened. I am addicted to this product now. I love, love, looooove this product. If I had to say one bad thing about the product it would only be that I wish they made a large stand-alone one that could be used on the entire body so can just shine it on myself and get the results. Now THAT would be magnificent. Hope this helps! ;-)</li>
    <li> Less expensive than the Dr. with the same results. Follow instructions and your wrinkles will begin to disappear. This is not an overnight wonder. But it does work.</li>
    <li> I think this product may have helped with reducing some breakouts but it is so cheaply made. I did not find it to have any positive influence on pore size or speeding up the healing of acne scar discoloration either. Several weeks ago the handle failed to keep the bulbs on, or would for a few seconds only and then the bulb would be out. I emailed the seller weeks ago to see if I could buy the handle only since I know the bulbs are not defective but I have not received a response. Too cheaply made for the price, in my opinion. ANSR beam was far more effective, perhaps too effective which is why such great effort was made to shut it down. Bummer. Hope to find another effective light therapy system eventually!</li>
    <li> Red head broke after first use. I really wanted to use the blue light for my adult acne but thought it was silly to keep it with out the red light option. I even email the manufacturer to try to get a replacement head before I returned it. They never responded!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried all three light sensors (for wrinkles, age spots and acne). I saw no results from any of them. A waste of money.</li>
    <li> had been getting light therapy at a salon and was very costly.  wanted to do something at home to maintain in between salon visits (spread visits apart) and was looking forward to trying this brand because it had all 3 interchangeable light wavelengths, highly portable, and priced right.  nice feature that beeps when ready for you to move to next section of face.  overall okay product but not as good as salon machine b/c at the salon, several lights are being pulsed throughout the treatment rather than one light at a time.  found that my face got quite red when used the red light (antiaging) for the programmed amount of time (I am fair skinned) and then did another light afterwards.  would recommend separating out exposure to each</li>
    <li> Background: I bought this in February -waited about 2-2.5 months to review, so my review is based upon use so far. I have also previously owned (and loved) the ANSR beam for a couple years prior to this purchase, so I can comment a bit on product comparison. Working in medicine myself, I&#x27;ll say the mainstream medicine/dermatology hasn&#x27;t yet been endorsing at-home light therapy products. But I&#x27;m using it myself due to frustration with expense and side effects with poor efficacy of over the counter and Rx skin products. I&#x27;m using this primarily for acne (comedonal, minimal cystic) but as I approach age 40, I&#x27;m looking for anti-aging effects as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aurora device: The product arrived as described, fast shipping (Thanks, Amazon!). The box contains the base unit, a wall plug-in adapter and three interchangeable light therapy heads. My first impression was that it&#x27;s very lightweight and felt almost \\&quot;cheap.\\&quot; I checked all three light heads to ensure function (they note that not all of the heads on the red will light visibly as it contains infrared also). The instruction card that comes with the product is brief and could be more in depth. The device has two buttons: on/off and mode. When you turn it on, it will light whichever treatment head that&#x27;s attached in \\&quot;steady\\&quot; mode. The instructions recommend treatment with the blinking mode for 3 treatments of 3 minutes each, so you have to switch the mode immediately, if you follow the exact usage directions. Then, the device beeps once every 3 minutes, to prompt you to move it to different zones on the face (outlined on the instructions). After 9 minutes on blinking, you should switch to \\&quot;steady\\&quot; mode and continue with various facial zones. After completion of the \\&quot;pulsating\\&quot; (I checked their term), then use 15 minutes in continuous (steady) mode. At the end of 24 minutes, the device beeps 3 times and turns off automatically. So far, mine has worked flawlessly. Changing the heads is easy. I believe Sirius recommendsusing treatment about 2-3 times per week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My use experience: As mentioned, I had been a dedicated user of the ANSR beam - clearest skin I&#x27;ve had in 20 years, with no dryness or other side effects. (I continue using a Clarisonic Mia and good facial cleansers, serum, etc.) However, the battery died on my ANSR and I went looking for a replacement. The ANSR company is currently out of commission (see my review there) - they did not get the FDA clearance for selling their device. The Aurora is FDA cleared. (FDA clearance or not was not a factor for my decision). The ANSR runs a 10 minute cycle, on a rechargeable battery - 5 minutes of blue light, 5 minutes of red light. I used it twice daily for 2+ years. It worked well. If you forgot to charge it, it will not run on a wall-plug in. You must wait for the battery to charge. The \\&quot;pro\\&quot; was it could be taken anywhere, even camping. Very small. The Aurora has a much longer treatment cycle - 24 minutes. I typically try to use it in the evening - blue one night, red the other. I do not have any areas of hyperpigmentation for trying out the green light. I have it plugged in next to my sofa and just watch tv while using it. I often get lazy about the recommended treatment zones and timing. I&#x27;ve tried to search some of the medical literature for use and don&#x27;t see clear agreement about duration/intervals of treatment. If you want great detail on the science and use, Sirius has a good website:[...] Now that I found I could just use a high-power AA rechargeable battery for my ANSR, I still go back and forth with both devices. They both work, both have pros and cons. I&#x27;ve taken my Aurora traveling but it will not go camping with me! I think the treatment interval is long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another interesting aside on this product: I thought we&#x27;d test the infrared and healing abilities with the red light head. My husband was getting some boils/folliculitis on his ankles, where the socks rubbed leg hairs. They were getting to thepoint of needing surgical incision and drainage. Instead, I asked him to apply heat and use my Aurora daily (just the 3 minutes) and within 2 days, they were noticeably improved. Only 1 experience, but I&#x27;m impressed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this helps. When I researched, this was also the most reasonably priced product. I see that the current price is up almost forty bucks from when I purchased here on Amazon. Still better than the competition.</li>
    <li> It takes time and patience but so far it does seem to help with acne. My son&#x27;s been using it for a few weeks and we can see an improvement in his skin.</li>
    <li> edited after a few more weeks of use*&lt;br /&gt;I bought product for a few reasons-&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;firstly, I don&#x27;t like to use any topical creams or treatments for my skin, it seems unhealthy and unnatural. Even though you look silly using this light therapy, I appreciate how it leaves your skin looking good immediately, and there&#x27;s no consequences besides the inconvenience of actually putting in the time. I have acne and a good bit of scarring on my face, mainly forehead and cheeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a guy and I don&#x27;t really need an expensive laser treatment item at my house, let alone going to a spa to pay ridiculous amount for something I could own. I read the blue light worked for acne and scarring, so I trusted the other reviewers. And the price was pretty perfect at $80.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been struggling with breakouts and bad skin for most of my teenage years, and it feels good to say that within a few weeks of using this product, my face has cleared up significantly and my scarring is quickly fading. It&#x27;s really amazing, and all I have to do is use this blue light every few days for about 25 minutes. The green light really evens out your skin tone and makes my skin look healthy even after all of the abuse my face has taken from the sun and topical treatments. Haven&#x27;t used the red light much, but I&#x27;m sure it must have positive results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you haven&#x27;t tried light therapy I&#x27;d recommend to anyone with acne or complexion issues to at least try this item. You can always return it if it doesn&#x27;t work for you, and I believe it to be much more effective and healthier than other methods, like the mountains of creams and ointments that have failed me in the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not being paid by this company, good luck.</li>
    <li> I am sure this product works well if it is used for a few months, but I just had to stop using it because it hurts my eyes. I wear tanning goggles and it still hurts my eyes, especially on the blinking mode and when I am on my forehead and upper cheeks due to the light that escapes from the side of the light plate. It also feels cheap, seems way over priced, and is extremely time consuming. Customer service has been easy to work with though.</li>
    <li> The jury is still out if it helps with fine lines and dark spots, but I love how it warms up and soothes during the winter months.  Crossing fingers to see if the fine lines start to diminish after continued use.</li>
    <li> I like this unit, it has a flashing pulse mode , a standard mode and a timer. It works well, and isn&#x27;t as strong as some light therapy machines which is a good thing if you have sensitive skin. I don&#x27;t like that it feels flimsy, so knowing that I treat this unit with kid gloves. It is a good unit for the money.</li>
    <li> Great product.&lt;br /&gt;Great price.&lt;br /&gt;Does exactly what it says.&lt;br /&gt;4 stars because it takes a while to get your whole face done.&lt;br /&gt;But other than that, very pleased.</li>
    <li> This light therapy system gave me results in about 2 days after I started using it . I noticed my pores were a little smaller and my skin looks hydrated and my wrinkles look better. The green light only lightened my dark spots a little bit ( I got dark spots on my face from my pregnancy).  I received the product quickly and my only complaints are- that the packaging could be better, when you open the box you have to make sure the plastic thing that holds the light system is facing the right side up, otherwise it will fall on the floor and the other complaint -on the flashing setting it triggers migraines for me.  I have to wear tanning bed goggles with a sleep mask on top of them.  On the continuous setting I feel fine though and don&#x27;t have to wear so much stuff on my eyes.</li>
    <li> I have had this product for a year and it still works great. I am 41 with sensitive skin. I had developed rosacea in the last few years and have some melasma. This product has cleared up my rosacea and lightened my melasma. My lines around eyes and on forehead are less noticeable. I do not use it as often as recommended because it does take a while to use. I normally just use the red light, but the blue light clears breakouts very well. I went to the dermatologist for my yearly check up and she was amazed my rosacea is gone. I asked about new anti-aging creams and she said I didn&#x27;t need them! She said I looked thirty, not 41 and to keep doing whatever I was doing. I&#x27;m not saying it is all due to the light, but it definitely helps!</li>
    <li> Used this product for a few weeks and stopped because it made me break out more. Disappointed since the reviews were so positive that it worked.</li>
    <li> i did love this product, but after 3 months, it stopped working.  Very upset, for the price it should have lasted more than 3 months!!   And naturally there is no returning it now, so is that planned to last only so long?   Rip off.</li>
    <li> The product does not always glide over my skin easily, so I end up making strokes instead of small circles. I would have liked more detailed instructions; when I went to the web site, the information was exactly that on the box. It does take a bit of time to give yourself a treatment, so not always a good fit in my schedule.&lt;br /&gt;I do see some change in my skin, and the product does seem good value for the money.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve noticed significant result in one week of using the light therapy system.  Freckles become lighter and pores become smaller.  It brings some hope to my prolonged skin problem.</li>
    <li> I love it!  I usually use Red light on me.</li>
    <li> Honestly, I did my research before buy it. It is excellent. I saw the difference in my skin since the first day. It looks more clear, radiant. Some people gave me compliments for how fresh my skin looks like. I am in my 20s, so I bought more as prevention, but still I can appreciate a better skin.</li>
    <li> This device was doing the trick, i was using it on my lips and cheeks and did see improvement in fullness. However, after four months of use, every other day for a half hour, it completely went dead. Unless you purchase it on the sirius manufacturer&#x27;s website, you are out of luck if it decides to stop working. the amazon vendor that i purchased it from will not accept returns after 60 days. Big disappointment for the price that I got only four months of use out of it.</li>
    <li> I thought this was a deal.  Unfortunately our daughter had one of those deep eruptions so I loaned it to her.  Since it worked so well, I let her keep it.  This is a nice gift for anyone who has ongoing skin problems.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem like it does anything.  The red had 3 lights not working after one use.</li>
    <li> This works amazingly well. I just wish that the company comes up with 1 light that does the work of all 3. It is time consuming, but if you want results, then it is time well spent. Will buy again</li>
    <li> very light weight, easy to use.  Have has great results with the blue and red light--green light for discoloration is taking a bit longer.</li>
    <li> Purchased this for my mom last year for Mother&#x27;s Day.  She&#x27;s getting a little older, and was trying to figure out how to take better care of her skin.  I&#x27;ve been doing red light and blue light therapy for a while, and I project about 10 years younger than my true age.  Thought this would be a perfect gift.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She has been using it daily ever since, and we can definitely see the difference in her face and skin.  Light therapy works for us!  The price on this is unbelievably low compared to similar models, and is a great value.</li>
    <li> I had a UV treatment for acne done at my local salon.  Afterwards I looked for something similar because I was pleased with the results.  I had my doubts since this was a different type if light.  Noticed a difference in my hormonal ache right away!  My face hasn&#x27;t been thus clear in years.  My sixteen year olon has been using the light therapy as well and is very pleased with the results!</li>
    <li> Buy this product on the weekend. Can cost as much as $139 during the week, and as little as $88.20 on the weekend. Don&#x27;t buy on a Wednesday like I did; you&#x27;ll get fleeced.&lt;br /&gt;The item also looks a lot like other LED systems offered on Amazon --  for a lot less than the Wednesday price for this product.&lt;br /&gt;Will not buy from this seller again. I don&#x27;t trust them. I don&#x27;t care whether this thing works or not...I feel like I got a lousy deal.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know what frame of mind I was in to purchase this but if it is too good to be true ... IT IS.  This is a ridiculous item and I don&#x27;t know about the ratings?  I don&#x27;t know what the guidelines are.  Are the people real or are they paid by company.  Because this does absolutely nothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;for all of you that are writing me thinking I couldn&#x27;t possibly have done it correctly or did I follow the directions,  did I use it long enough for what kind of condition were you using it for.  I used it for slight aging wrinkles, acne, etc.  The usual.  I used it for two months.  It did nothing nothing nothing nothing nothing.  Just because you had a great experience do not think that I am doing something wrong because it didn&#x27;t work for me.  I believe that all of you are eithing having a coincidental slight improvement in your skin or its in your head because it is so slight only you could notice with a magnifying glass.  I do not think that the strength of these lights could do anything at all there is no scientific proof that at this strength that it does.  Your just going by maybe it did help some in another setting with a stronger light.  This is just a flat out rip off.  Although if there are people feeling like it works.  Keep dreaming.  LOL  Don&#x27;t waste your time I can&#x27;t return because I used it to long to get the best result.  Junk science.!!!!!!!!!!!!!![[ASIN:B004REGO00 Sirius SS-77 Aurora Light Therapy System.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;marty66</li>
    <li> Short Version:&lt;br /&gt;There are a lot of claims about what different wavelengths of light can do for your health, acne, skin, etc.  I&#x27;m not here to argue any of that, but I will comment on the quality of the materials it is built with and how well it functions as a thing that puts out light and heat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The short version is, &amp;#34;Quite well&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Long Version:&lt;br /&gt;INFRARED&#x3D;YES&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s also important to note that this particular model includes actual infrared LEDs as well as LEDs that cast light in the visual part of the red spectrum. So if you&#x27;re specifically interested in IR therapy, this is the model for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WARMTH&#x3D;YES&lt;br /&gt;I purchased this when I had a really bad ear infection, and one of the things you can do to ease the pain and discomfort is to lay with the offending ear facing up and apply heat to it. I found this to be very helpful when I was trying to get to sleep.  So what I wanted heat without the danger of hurting myself, the hassle of having to re-heat something, or the annoyance of trying to wrap my head in an electric blanket in such a way that the heat would be where I actually needed it. The Aurora is the perfect size and shape for this application. And it does get quite warm, I would even say very warm.  Not uncomfortably so, and it&#x27;s not a malfunction that it gets warm. It&#x27;s supposed to do that.  I should mention that it&#x27;s the red bulb I&#x27;m talking about.  That&#x27;s the only one I&#x27;ve used because I was acting under the suggestion that IR therapy would help my ear infection heal faster and... I can&#x27;t find the other two bulbs for the life of me.  So I can&#x27;t comment on how warm they get.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FEATURES &#x3D; HELPFUL&lt;br /&gt;Aside from an on/off switch, the Aurora has two features, one that is pretty great and the other one I don&#x27;t know why it&#x27;s there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Firstly, it has an internal timer. So it will beep every three minutes.  This is to let the user know to move on to treat another area. Then, after about 24 minutes, the Aurora will turn itself off.  That&#x27;s pretty great for me, because I was in danger of falling asleep while holding it to my ear. It&#x27;s also great for somebody using it for facials, because they don&#x27;t have to keep track of how many times it has beeped before you know it&#x27;s time to stop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other feature is that the Aurora has two modes. 1. Always on and 2. Blinking.  I honestly don&#x27;t know what the blinking mode is for. I did find a use for it during my ear infection though.  I&#x27;d been advised that 40 minutes at a go was the maximum amount of exposure. (I don&#x27;t know what the consequences of going over that are.) So when my 24 minutes of &amp;#34;always on&amp;#34; mode was up, I would turn it back on and switch it to pulse mode for 24 more minutes of warmth, but only... say 12&#x27;ish minutes of IR exposure because it was blinking on and off... I can&#x27;t speak to the validity of this very scientific conclusion I came up with while in the throws of horrible pain and discomfort, but it sounds good and I felt like I had accomplished something which bolstered my morale.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, also, I like the design of how the bulb interfaces with the device and how you change them out.  The bulbs are held firmly and don&#x27;t wiggle around in the housing. Well done there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;IN CONCLUSION&lt;br /&gt;As somebody who owns a soldering iron I could probably make something for less money but significantly more time that doesn&#x27;t look as pretty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works, it works well.  You have to plug it in, it&#x27;s not battery operated, so the lack of mobility if something comes up while you&#x27;re using it keeps it from being 5 stars.  But I&#x27;m glad I bought it and am now using it on my face rather than just my ear.the Aurora will turn itself off.  That&#x27;s pretty great for me, because I was in danger of falling asleep while holding it to my ear.

But I&#x27;m glad I bought it and am now using it on my face rather than just my ear.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t see any difference after using, don&#x27;t think it works at all</li>
    <li> Bought this for my wife.  She had it less than a month before it stopped working.  There&#x27;s purportedly a 1 year warranty on the item.  We emailed Sirius several times, never heard back.  I recommend buyers find a similar product from a different brand and seller.</li>
    <li> Horrible! Don&#x27;t waste your money!! Doesn&#x27;t get better gets worse!! I thought it would be amazing since it got good reviews but is a piece of crap that&#x27;s cheap and doesn&#x27;t work</li>
    <li> UhhHHHH!!! BROKE. I think I used it 4 times, then it started randomly turning off during use. Returning it.</li>
    <li> This light worked great for about a week.  Then it would not go on using the blue light.  If it did eventually go on it would flicker off.  Other reveiwers said the same thing...I should have listened...I returned it.</li>
    <li> When I first opened the box, I noticed how light and cheap it felt. It&#x27;s made of very lightweight plastic like a child&#x27;s toy. It was fine for about a month, then it just stopped working. The box had no warranty inside. I would highly advise against purchasing this item if you&#x27;re thinking about it.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if I would like the product or not, because it was broken within the first 2 months. After several frustrating attempts to contact customer service, I was told I had to pay for shipping AND had to send my sirius in first. After reading several reviews of customer service, I tried to explain to the person that I was hesitant due to my experience and others with their customer service to send my system in first without a guarantee.&lt;br /&gt;She responded curtly and curtly, no they would not send a shipping label and no they would not send me a replacement first. that was her response, no and no.&lt;br /&gt;VERY FRUSTRATING. terrible customer service.</li>
    <li> And her skin looks great. I don&#x27;t know if Sirius Light System can take all the credit because she eats really well and takes care of her health (organic, veggies, fruits, nuts, low meat consumption and plenty of water and exercise).Theresa</li>
    <li> Cleared my acne. No joke. This thing really works.</li>
    <li> I love my Sirius SS-77 Aurora Light Therapy System. I use it every other night and can definitely tell a difference in my skin.</li>
    <li> Ive only had it for a month now, but using the red and green lights religiously daily, and was thinking it was making a difference but wasnt sure until a guy at work the other night said &#x27;you look... younger&#x27;. :)&lt;br /&gt;Cant wait to see 6 months from now!!</li>
    <li> It REALLY works! I was skeptical because of the low price but after four days of using the blue light, my adult acne and rosa is is 85% better!! I look foreword to trying the other lights. I didn&#x27;t give the 5 th star because some things could be improved. Instructions are both inside and explanation of lights are outside of box. They should be together and a bit better to understand. AdditionAlly, the chord needs to be designed better so it doesn&#x27;t pull out so easily..</li>
    <li> You need to do it every day.</li>
    <li> Light therapy was recommended to me for anti aging possibilities.  I have been using the Sirius for about a month and not really seeing any significant results.  Maybe it just takes awhile.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using the Sirius Aurora led light therapy system for only a few weeks, using it daily, green panel in the morning to illuminate my skin, and red at night to create collagen for lines and slight sagging in jawline area.  I have seen a change in my skin that I did not think I would see and it was evidenced by a picture I saw of myself taken very recently.  My skin had a glow to it and the lines were much less noticible and the jawline area has been tightened slightly.  I was amazed at how radiant my skin looked as well.  If I could post a picture, I would, just so you could see the results in so short a time.  I read other reviews before I purchased and decided to try the Aurora.  If you use it faithfully every day, you will see results.  I also wanted to mention that I had a problem with shipping due to no fault of the Sirius company but I emailed the company and they tracked the order and kept in touch with me so that I could make sure that I received my product.  The customer service rep, Stacey, I spoke to went above and beyond to help me with the shipping problem even so far as to ship a replacement free of charge if I did not receive it in the next few days of my order.  However, a few days later, I received it.  I had read other reviews who had comments about the company and their shipping and wanted to make this clear.  I would definitely purchase from Sirius Beauty again and also ladies if you use this system faithfully as I mentioned before, you WILL GET RESULTS AND YOU WILL LOVE THE WAY YOUR SKIN LOOKS!!!</li>
    <li> This company should realy think about some global advertising, because it is really a good product. I am using Aurora for a month and I can already say that it may be a revolution in treating acne. I threw all other, not working medicines. Firstly Aurora is the most effective, secondly it didn’t make skin damages, like izotetreina atrederm or other peelings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only price is in my country high, because of bad currency change rate. But i don&#x27;t regret this money, By now it is really the most efective product i ever used !!</li>
    <li> This is my first time trying a product like this and I didn&#x27;t know what to expect. I read about similar products that stop working after a certain number of uses but this one is to work for a lifetime even if you use it for hundreds of hours a week! I have used this device consistently 3 times a week since I&#x27;ve gotten it, and my skin is now looking so much better. I have no oily patches, my acne is almost gone and my pores are far less visible.</li>
    <li> The only complaint I have is the time it takes to do the teatments with this device.  Each separate light takes 24 minutes so to do the full set takes about an hour and a quarter.  I think I am getting some improvement of the tone of my skin although any really dark spots have not magically gotten really light.  Pores don&#x27;t seem very improved which confirms the fact that it is almost impossible to reduce them on older skin.  I will continue to do the treatments because multiple weeks of treatment may continue to show gradual improvement along with my other skin care routines.</li>
    <li> No problem with the seller, they shipped this very quickly. It was well packed and as described, but this product is \\&quot;eh-\\&quot;. I purchased this product on sale, I paid $118, (I think it still on sale), to help my skin produce more collagen. It feels very light, as if you are holding a toy, likewise the cord is kind of short. However, I didn&#x27;t have any problems with bulbs, plug or switch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It takes roughly 20-30 minutes for a complete cycle (forgot) , and depending on your schedule I think you can do it twice a week. I just feel that this routine is very time consuming. If you&#x27;re a mom, student, dad, professional or someone that is just busy in general, I think this product is a NO. I feel that the time allotted to complete a \\&quot;session\\&quot; was too much to see the difference, which by the way was VERY minimal, again  I&#x27;m speaking for the collagen production and not the acne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Likewise, I didn&#x27;t feel like it&#x27;s working, There was no immediate reaction, whether it was good or bad, it feels like I was just holding a flashlight against my skin. But if you still want to try this, you need to purchase an eye protector. It&#x27;s kinda hard not to look directly at the lights.</li>
    <li> I could never understand why no amount of amazing topical products could clear my acne completely. When my acne recently got worse, I realized it was not simply a &amp;#34;clogged pore&amp;#34;, it had to be driven by bacterial infections... A small, &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; pimple would turn into a creature with its own mind, especially if I made the mistake of popping it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If this sounds like you, then definitely buy this product. It does a solid job of preventing acne, and when I get a bump that feels infectious, I immediately spot treat it with the Aurora. The pimple stops getting bigger for a day or two then starts to get smaller and smaller.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tips:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It can cause headaches. Be prepared to keep your eyes closed when using it and try to use it more during the day when the light contrast is not so dramatic. Also, the pulsing light is worse than the &amp;#34;straight&amp;#34; light&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you do pick at your acne then use the light before and after so that the spread of the bacteria is less impactful (best advice is don&#x27;t pick of course, but easier said than done)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Smile! You&#x27;ve finally found something that will help. :)</li>
    <li> Like it so far.  Have been using it for a week and so far so good. Hopefully more improvements noticeable with continued use.</li>
    <li> The product arrived properly and on time. Worked correct at first use, but soon fell out, possibly caused by a lose internal contact. By tapping on the device it started again. Adapter, cable and connector were oke. It became worse the next day and we had to return the device from Europe to the US. It is a pity that there is no possibility for exchanging the product. Only refunding applies. I would however be more happy to get a correct working version. It is in principle a good product, which I like to have.</li>
    <li> It is light weight and easy to use.  I have only used it 4 times so I don&#x27;t know the long term results yet but these skin problems didn&#x27;t happen overnite so it will take time to erase time from my face and neck.</li>
    <li> basically I can see this device doing what it claims IF you put in the time... I however fall into lazy mode at 7pm  and showering and blow drying are the equivalent to climbing Mt Everest so doing a 24 minute LED light treatment sort of gets shuffled to the back of my list of priorities...  If you are wondering if this device is effective believe me when I say it is... Prob same quality as the $400... But be prepared because you HAVE to do it every other day to see results</li>
    <li> I have been using this for a week. I use the green light in the morning for my SEVERE hyperpigmintation, then i use the red light at night for aging. I&#x27;m devoted to using this for the next year on a regular basis in hopes it will help.  Lets see...i don&#x27;t breakout much anymore, but i did have a blemish yesterday and applied the blue light last night, this morning i woke up and the blemish was 50% less, so this is hopefull........oh wait, i did use the red light on a bruise on my leg, and it healed up 50% faster!!! ......so all in all, i&#x27;m hopefull this product will help with aging and especially with my hyperpigmination because chemical peels are expensive and botox and juvaderm have maxed out my credit cards in the past.....this poor girl needs an alternative. I will come back in a few months for another update, thanks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: i&#x27;ve been using product faithfully for a month for about 5 to 6 times a week, don&#x27;t notice anything yet with pigmination or aging, but yes on the acne, so i&#x27;m still hopefull. Will update again, I&#x27;m not giving up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2 MONTH UPDATE: I&#x27;m still using this about 4 times a week. I use the red light on my hands as well. I use all color plates. No significant change, nothing I notice. Still not giving up. I&#x27;m using the blue light for large pores on nose now, again no significant change, nothing I notice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4 MONTH UPDATE: I think its been 4 months now. Okay, I&#x27;ve been lazy using this product, i&#x27;m probably doing 3 times a week, and i was doubtful but still using it. However, I would look in the mirror and say to myself wow, i&#x27;m looking good, my makeup looks fantastic, my bf would say how great my skin looked bare faced. But with all that i was still doubtful this product was working. Then I got a bad cough and got tired and didn&#x27;t use this product for over 2 weeks, and i would look in the mirror and say to myself, i look horrible, and i put on more makeup and still looked really bad. I thought I better use my red light asap, and after just 3 days, i was looking better. Now i know this product works thru this experience, my face looks plumper, poreless and even skin tone. I still have serious hyperpigmintation from years of abuse so this product makes me look and feel better with constant use but without it, not even makeup can hide my dark spots. I will continue to use this product especially since I cannot afford botox or juvaderm right now. TTYL.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;8 month update: This product works!!! I use this product about 3 times a week.  However, one day I wake up and notice in the mirror my face is looking absolutly fabulous and I havn&#x27;t done any facials or anything lately other then red light therapy.  So I got lazy and stopped using it, then about 6 weeks later again i look in the mirror and notice I am hideous, my skin is blotchy, dull and saggy!!! wth, this is what I get for stop using my red light therapy, I immediatly use it and about 3 days later i&#x27;m starting to look better, i have decided to buy a bigger red light therapy because i am just lazy and taking 20 min a day to move this hand held product all over my face with a toddler in the house just isn&#x27;t convenient.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope you enjoyed my journey with this product.</li>
    <li> I have had acne for a very long time. It went away for the most part for a few years, but returned to plague me as adult acne. Throughout the years I&#x27;ve had acne I&#x27;ve tried all sorts of treatments to get rid of it: salicylic acid spot treatments, masks, accutane (worst decision EVER!), the clarisonic, but nothing worked... Until this. This LED light therapy system has done wonders. Note: the clarisonic worked to a limited extent, up until I noticed it was depleting my skin&#x27;s moisture and seemingly collagen too much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was looking into spa treatments and found that spa&#x27;s and doctor&#x27;s officers were using LED light therapy, so I decided to look into it. I read so many reviews, and research articles before finally deciding to give it a shot.  After all this handheld device is cheaper than one treatment from an aesthetician or doctors office. I was hesitant because my skin tone is light-medium (or tan coloured) and this seemed better for light toned people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My results (in reference to acne):&lt;br /&gt;Week 1 (evening use): didn&#x27;t see much of a change (there were some, but not noticeable to anyone but myself)&lt;br /&gt;Week 2 (evening use): half way through the second week I noticed large pustules/cysts disappear over night, but somehow another would just reappear in a new place (thought it might be because I was rubbing it on my skin lightly, so I stopped, and made it hover very close to my skin), noticed increased facial hair growth (this was the red light),&lt;br /&gt;Week 3 (evening use): most pustules/cysts continued to disappear overnight and reappear throughout the day in a new location (also tried microdermabrasion at the beginning of 3rd week), noticed hovering didn&#x27;t affect new zit appearances, so laziness lead me back to light contact with my face&lt;br /&gt;Week 4- now (aprx week 7) (every other day use): pustules/cysts that pop up no longer stand a chance -they disappear overnight, nor are they popping up again in new places&lt;br /&gt;For weeks 1-3 I used the bluelight every night, and the red and green alternating nights&lt;br /&gt;For weeks 4 to now (aprx week 7) I use only the blue light and green light every other night (or day).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You should know that around week4 I started taking hormonal treatments (birth control), so the fact that cysts no longer reappear in a new spot later in the day could be due to that. Though I doubt it, as hormonal acne was NOT affected by the light therapy by one iota. Dietary acne was also NOT affected by the light therapy system (ex. I took vitB12, which started this mess -acne caused solely by it is also not affected by light therapy)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tips:&lt;br /&gt;- To get the best results try steaming your face for at least 5min before light therapy treatments. (It could be the heat, or the fact that your pores are open)&lt;br /&gt;- using the device after showering also improved results&lt;br /&gt;- I tried microdermabrasion, this seemed to improve the results&lt;br /&gt;- in conjunction with a facial brush like the Clarisonic it also improved the results (Though I can&#x27;t use the clarisonic everyday as they advertise b/c it&#x27;s too harsh on my skin&#x27;s hydration/collagen)&lt;br /&gt;- follow directions and use lotions AFTER treatment (lotions often reflect light); I forgot about this once and so I was wondering why I didn&#x27;t see results the next morning as I had been, turned out I was so tired I put lotion on before starting the light therapy&lt;br /&gt;- I sometimes used the light therapy after a lemon mask which makes your skin more sensitive to light, but I couldn&#x27;t see any benefit to this, steams and microdermabrasion was a much more effective means to increase results)&lt;br /&gt;- I sometimes also used it after a facial scrub, you would think it would improve the efficacy of the light therapy, but it didn&#x27;t for me&lt;br /&gt;- most visible results when used in the evening (though it still worked if used in the morning, it just wasn&#x27;t so spectacular watching them gradually shrink vs suddenly shrunk acne in the morning -it was like christmas for a few weeks, I&#x27;d wake up excited to see if some zits had miraculously disappeared or shrunk)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What it did not help with for me:&lt;br /&gt;- hormonal acne&lt;br /&gt;- acne caused by dietary sensitivities&lt;br /&gt;-hyper-pigmentation: the green light therapy takes FOREVER on my skin tone to work, I&#x27;ve seen faster results from the one microdermabrasion session for my hyper-pigmentation than from the green light&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Warnings:&lt;br /&gt;-Red light caused an increase in facial hair growth for me (late 20&#x27;s), I looked into red LED therapy, and not only does it help with healing and wrinkles, but it is also a treatment for balding (alopecia), it even helps with genetic balding, so yay for bald people, boo for wrinkles... unless you&#x27;re a dude, or a chick who doesn&#x27;t mind growing some extra facial hair. Luckily it was peach fuzz and has since come off with a scrub or a mask I&#x27;ve used.</li>
    <li> I was excited to receive this product but upon first use I noticed the red LED came in broken:(  I now need to somehow track down customer service to have it replaced.  The other lights work great!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for less than 2 weeks.&lt;br /&gt;Due to the lengthy time required.  I usually only use one (out of 3) light a day.&lt;br /&gt;Didn&#x27;t feel any noticable improvement.  But my daughter (34) said after two days using (all 3 lights), it was noticable improvement of her face.&lt;br /&gt;Compare with the ANSR I used before, this product has larger area producing lights.  But this has to be plugged into power outlet for use.&lt;br /&gt;I have used two ANSRs.  Not a miracle, but easy to use and worked.  When I tried to buy the 3rd one for spare I&#x27;ve noticed that the price for ANSR went up 3 times (Isn&#x27;t that crazy?)  When I was using it, I might have felt not able to see how much my complex improved, but when I STOP using it, I noticed the difference.&lt;br /&gt;I expect this procuct works the same as ANSR but with stronger lighting.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll update later if there&#x27;s anything worth to mention.</li>
    <li> I felt compelled to write this review. I just bought this system in March mainly for acne and hyperpigmentation. I am African American with acne scars &amp; adult acne!! Yuck!!! I use it twice daily &amp; I can already see a decrease in pore size, oil production and skin texture.  I am pleased!!! This works for me!!! Much cheaper and more convenient than going to the spa. I have a very busy schedule being a Family Nurse Practitioner. I can do this while watching TV or reviewing charts!!! Again, I am pleased!!!</li>
    <li> i bought  it for my son and i used it too it cleared his acne in about a month but before that it made his skin less red. i love it for making my wrinkles vanish</li>
    <li> I hardly ever write reviews; however this one definitely needs to be talked about.  I&#x27;m 44 yrs old and still have trouble with my facial skin breaking out.  Sometimes my face looks like a teenager with pimples all over my chin.  At my age I don&#x27;t think women should still be getting pimples.  I&#x27;ve tried so many creams, cleansers, and other products and was ready to give up until I tried the Aurora Light Therapy System.  I&#x27;m very pleased with the results I&#x27;m seeing after a few uses.  The tone of my skin and wrinkles are slowly diminishing.  I&#x27;ve been smoking since I was 15 yrs old and have wrinkles around my mouth area.  Since I started using this system my skin is looking young and smooth especially around the corners of my eyes and lips.  I highly recommend this system to anyone that is having trouble with adult acne~~It&#x27;s been a lifesaver!  What&#x27;s even better is the price~~I finally found a system that actually works!!</li>
    <li> This light therapy treatment is definitely worth trying&lt;br /&gt;If you do not want to use creams or opt for surgical means then this is a great alternative&lt;br /&gt;Harmless to under layers of skin and general health. It is certainly  what I prefer to  use&lt;br /&gt;Recommended purchase</li>
    <li> I have only been using this for three weeks, but already noticed a subtle difference.  I use the red and green light.  It is time consuming, 25 minutes three times a week for the red and just six minutes with the green.  I use the green on the middle of my face for an extra glow.</li>
    <li> I love it. The blue light has improved my acne problems.</li>
    <li> The product was delivered in time and it works perfectly.</li>
    <li> I purchased this item for the blue light therapy (acne) and have found it is working great!&lt;br /&gt;The only issue I have is that my unit will not hold a charge, will not even turn on unless plugged in.</li>
    <li> After only 6 uses my teen has already seen a noticeable difference in her acne.  Wonderful, wonderful product.  It has also helped with the dark spots on my face.</li>
    <li> This product has done wonders for my acne and some acne scarring that I’ve had for years.  I kept getting break outs even though I use Proactiv on a twice daily basis and I’m an adult.  I was getting so angry and frustrated and decided to try this after one horrible break out happened all over my chin.  When the product arrived two days later, I used it immediately.  And overnight, the breakout seemed to go away.  I used it for a few more days all over my face and my skin has honestly never looked better since puberty.  I am so grateful that I tried this product and finally found something that works!  I feel like it has cleansed all the layers of my skin and eradicated my acne problem rather than just treating it topically.  I wish I had known about this product years before!  If you have acne that is causing serious self-esteem issues, buy this!  Don’t wait any longer to get rid of horrible, constantly re-emerging acne!</li>
    <li> It suddenly powered off during the middle of my session, then the bottom half of the lights wouldn&#x27;t light up again (I could tell through my goggles). I read more than once that this company was a pain to deal with, so I sent it back to Amazon for a refund the next day. Even if they did replace it, I didn&#x27;t want to deal with potential that it would just break again!</li>
    <li> I was highly skeptical when my dr told me to look into blue light therapy for daughter&#x27;s acne. I can not believe how well it&#x27;s working!! Simply amazing, it&#x27;s better than two years worth of trial and error antibiotics and creams. This one was the best price for what you get. I highly recommend.</li>
    <li> broken since out of box, never get chance to use it, i&#x27;m going to send it back. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS PRODUCT. I have tried other light therapy product and works very well, but it cost me $30 a month so I thought if I buy this product and after about 3 months I&#x27;ll be start to saving money, now I&#x27;m so disappointed.</li>
    <li> Not quite as effective as its claims.</li>
    <li> Check out LED plant grow bulbs instead.  They come in all these colors, or with mixed colors.  LED bulbs don&#x27;t get hot, so you don&#x27;t need them in a special device.  I bought one with 45 red LED bulbs and 15 blue LED bulbs for twelve dollars including shipping.</li>
    <li> I ordered this for myself, husband and son to use.  I have mild acne on my chin and my husband has some black heads he wanted help with.  My son has more severe acne issues.  All three of us have been using the blue light and all three of us have seen results after only a few uses.  I have also been using the red light and don&#x27;t notice  changes from that one although overall my skin is looking better.  But I definitely notice the blue light works on my break outs.  My husband complemented my skin the other day.  I notice a difference with my son, but his acne is more severe and will probably take more time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely worth the money with all the usage we are getting out of this little system.</li>
    <li> It really works! I have been using this Aurora light therapy for almost a year now. I wanted to wait to leave any feedback because this takes a little time to work. Collagen takes 90 days to repair it&#x27;s self so I wanted to use this first before posting a review. I mostly use the RED light attachment.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m in my 50&#x27;s so I believe I&#x27;m the perfect specimen for the RED light therapy. As we get older our collagen gets thinner and the elasticity goes away. The RED light helps rebuild collagen and elasticity. That&#x27;s why I think the RED light therapy works better for \\&quot;older\\&quot; skin. I can honestly say that this light therapy works! Yes it does take time but going to the gym once or twice isn&#x27;t going to give you a hot model body either!&lt;br /&gt;I did notice a difference within a week or two of using the light so yes you could get instant results but it&#x27;s the long term that I&#x27;m interested in. I use an antioxidant serum or cream BEFORE I use the light because it helps to glide the light better on my face and it also helps absorb the antioxidants into my skin for better results. Just make sure your lotion doesn&#x27;t have any SPF in it or it will block the light penetration.&lt;br /&gt;My skin color is more even and the lines on my forehead and eyes are less noticeable. I also love the warmth of the&lt;br /&gt;lights. I think it helps to relax my face muscles which help to relax my wrinkles and isn&#x27;t that what Botox does...relax the wrinkles?&lt;br /&gt;I know I must sound like a paid spokesperson but I assure you I&#x27;m not! I just believe in this system and I know my skin looks better because of it! Also, my husband always can tell when I used the light because he says my skin glows!&lt;br /&gt;Like I&#x27;ve said...I&#x27;ve been using this almost a year and I&#x27;m sold! I love love love my Aurora light!</li>
    <li> I just received this yesterday. Because one of the reviewers stated that it took forever to get the item shipped and received, I especially wanted to write in and say that I ordered it on Wednesday, and I received it on Thursday! I do have a Prime membership, but even without a Prime membership, you should not have to wait long to receive this item.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Soon after I received my package, I carefully cleansed my face and gave myself a treatment with the red light. I should mention that I am 68 years old, so I have lots of wrinkles and sagging to work on! Well, amazing! The next morning my skin was much tighter, wrinkles were diminished and sagging was lessened. I was really surprised, but if that is the improvement I get with just one treatment, I am thrilled!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to post my experience with this light treatment as time goes on.</li>
    <li> I really wanted it to work, had high hopes reading all the reviews.  Used it everyday according to directions.  After use would examine my face with reader glasses on.... no difference.  In the process of sending it back, hate to waste my money.</li>
    <li> I ordered this from the Sirius Beauty site a long while ago, and I noticed minimal results... helped my blackheads a little, but really didn&#x27;t do much for my acne. I followed the return instructions and returned it, well... wow. WORST costumer service. One month later after I sent it back I still hadn&#x27;t gotten my refund, I emailed them... no response. Email.... no response. Email.... finally got a response claiming they couldn&#x27;t find my oder, and they needed to the tracking number. THANK HEAVENS I paid the extra for tracking/insurance! Once I gave them the tracking number they magically &#x27;found&#x27; my order and said they&#x27;d refund me. Well, almost a month later still no refund. Emailed them again.... no response. Another email. Nothing. Another email threatening to contact Better Business Bureau and suddenly they got back to me saying they&#x27;d refund me right away. About two weeks later they finally refunded, but was charged me a restocking fee... which would have been fine, but I waited TWO months for them to get it together and they had the nerve to charge me a restocking fee after they strung me along for months. Anyways, I think the blue light is worth a try but I would NOT order from this company. Don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve ever had such horrible customer service.</li>
    <li> I am a big fan of finding products for at-home use that will improve my appearance, especially since I am about to turn 50. I have tried many in-office procedures, and know that they can really be EXPENSIVE.  Especially trying to keep up with Botox injections, which one needs about every 4 months.  I am trying to find alternatives.  This is a good product to use while you are reading, or watching television.  I have noticed the tone of my skin is better.  I have only been using it for a little less than a month.  I plan on using this when my boys develop acne, which I have a good idea they might, since I had terrible acne as a teenager.  I also have bought related products, such as NuFace, and Palovia.  I enjoy trying them and seeing how they perform.  This one was a great price, as well.</li>
    <li> decided I just didn&#x27;t have the patience to see if it would deliver results that I know I can get from one visit to my local laser treatment center. Yes, treatments cost more, but you can leave in less than 30 minutes with results that last 6 months to a year.</li>
    <li> As someone else pointed out earlier, many of the 5 star reviews are from people who are being paid to write good reviews.  Unfortunately I didnt realize this until after I ordered this product. I usually choose a product based on customer reviews and I didnt realize this was happening. I truly hope this light system works but now I have less confidence in Amazon&#x27;s customer reviews. I will update about the product after I have used it for a few weeks.</li>
    <li> I noticed that the box seems to be opened already and the equipment was already used up.  The packaging was opened and not sealed so I was hesitant to take it back but I went ahead and disinfect and used it.  You need to use it religiously, if not it doesn&#x27;t really work</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t expect the unit to be much for the price, but it worked and then some!  We are considering buying anothe one.</li>
    <li> I stumbled onto this little miracle by accident. Like most people I didn&#x27;t have thousands of dollars to spend on anti-aging or acne treatments. So I thought this would be a perfect solution. I really didn&#x27;t expect it to work as well as it does! I&#x27;m 44 and have the good fortune to have good aging genes but I&#x27;ve recently lost 40lbs &amp; I didn&#x27;t like my neck after weight loss. I primarily bought this for my 15yr old son, since like most teenagers he suffers from acne. Not only has his acne begun to heal , my skin is looking fabulous &amp; really firm!I&#x27;m so impressed with this light therapy that I&#x27;m going to buy one just for me. Yes it is time consuming but it is so worth it!</li>
    <li> This is the ONLY thing I have found clears up cystic acne. I have tried everything and it was so awful every time I saw myself getting one there was nothing I could do, and I knew it would leave a scar. Now I put the blue light on the spot twice a day, or not even, and it goes away. Seriously a miracle product, I wish everyone who got cystic acne would know about this!</li>
    <li> I like this it works well. Thanks.</li>
    <li> Compared to my Tanda unit. I like this one more, even though it is not cordless. The area of the light is larger and the intensity is brighter. After using my blue Tanda light for a year, I realized I needed something for my uneven skin tone so I had to have a green light. So glad this was available for that purpose. Gave my Tanda to my teenager.  For that reason, I would recommend this over Tanda, because Tanda does not make a green light. Also, the slightest drop of my Tanda unit results in a broken light head and I do not have $100 to keep replacing them, which I have had to do twice now. I&#x27;ve had no issues with this Aurora unit.</li>
    <li> I love using this light therapy.  I don&#x27;t do it enough, but when I use it regularly I do notice a difference in my pores and skin texture.  I think it works best when you have regular facials.  If you are working with clean skin it&#x27;s always best.  If I use it every night for a week straight I really notice my skin is clear and tight.  I use it on my husband too, when we use the blue light for a couple of days all the dirt comes out of the skin.  So some breakouts for a day or two and we make sure to exfoliate really well and then our skin is perfect!</li>
    <li> Product deliver on time and only tired it yesterday. Cant wait to see the result asap!</li>
    <li> Well I saw something similar to this on a shopping channel - thought I&#x27;d check Amazon for a competitive price and to read any reviews posted - I really don&#x27;t get this product at all.  I have tried to use it on a regular basis, but it is so boring to sit still for that long with your eyes closed - with that light flashing you can&#x27;t meditate - it&#x27;s not calming at all.  I used the green and red light attachments - nothing.  My skin is fine - I&#x27;m pretty old and I can live with a few lines - no other issues - so this was something I probably shouldn&#x27;t have bothered to order.  I would return it, but I do hate to do that - I think I&#x27;ll give away or sell it for 4.00 - that is about what it is worth.....  I am a junkie for skin care products and I also bought the Palo Via - which is torture to use - that one cost approximately 400.00 and it too is going away...  no benefits noticed at all -</li>
    <li> I have had this for not even a full 3 months. I followed the instructions and was very careful. I went to plug it in and nothing happens now. It is completly broken and unusable. I spent a good amount of money on this product and didn&#x27;t expect it to quit working for no reason within a few short months. Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> Started seeing results after just one week. Love the timer that tells you exactly when to move on to the next area, so I can read or watch tv while doing treatments. Switching treatment panels is a breeze. Just used the continuous mode so can&#x27;t comment on the pulsating mode. The light is not that bright, so there is no need for goggles unless your eyes are really sensitive.</li>
    <li> Useless...do not purchase....go get a facial.</li>
    <li> A few years ago I had a red light facial at a spa that seemed offered significant improvement on a dark spot I had on my cheek.  I tried to go back to get another a few years later and the spa no longer existed and I couldn&#x27;t find another local spa that offered this exact type of treatment (everyone wanted to push the fractional laser - which I had tried, but interestingly it did not offer as good of a result as I had with the red light facial a few years earlier).  Since I couldn&#x27;t find a spa that offered this particular service at a reasonable price, I began considering a home device.  I was very unsure if a small hand held home unit would be powerful enough to offer any results, and took a long time to finally decide to gamble my money on this model.  Though the strength of the light does not seem as powerful as the one I had at the spa, I did see improvement in my skin after my first use using the red light LEDs.  The most immediate thing I noticed was that the treatment seemed to help with the puffiness around my eyes (a common problem I have) ... after a full sitting with the Aurora, the puffy bags under my eyes are hardly visible.  Though the puffy lumps under my eyes are smoothed, the rest of my face seems to experience a slight plumping effect along with a bit of a glow.  Really - after just one use!  Granted, it&#x27;s about a 30-40 minute session, which is not a quick fix and it does seem that the benefits I get are temporary (by the next morning, my bags are back, and the plumpness is again diminished, but it&#x27;s nice to know that all I have to do is pull out my device again for another session to revive the that refreshed look).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for long term benefits, I am not sure yet.  I have another small dark spot, this time on the other cheek, that is not experiencing the same level of healing that I received from the spa facial, but it does seem to be getting some minor improvement.  I&#x27;m alternating between the red and green lights... but in all honestly,I&#x27;m mostly using the red so that may be why the dark spot isn&#x27;t fading as fast.  I&#x27;ll try to make more time for the green lights in the hope that I&#x27;ll see more improvement on the dark spot .  I don&#x27;t have acne so I don&#x27;t use the blue lights.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pros:&lt;br /&gt;This product does work -- I&#x27;ve seen visible improvements even after the first use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This seller offered the best price I could find, the product was new, as described and shipped promptly so I am very happy with the price and service.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cons:&lt;br /&gt;Time consuming.  Each session takes 30-40 minutes per light (which adds up if you are like me and want to use both red and green).  I wish it was just a little more powerful (like the red light facial I had at the spa) to maybe cut down the amount of time it requires.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I think it&#x27;s a good value because it does indeed offer some improvement to my skin, which is the only thing that keeps me motivated to find the time for it.  I wish I had enough time to use it every day, but I can only find time for a full session a couple times a week at best.  Some days, if I&#x27;m short on time, I&#x27;ll use it just on my under-eye bags in the morning.... then try to make a point of doing the rest of my face when I&#x27;m relaxing at home with a movie or watching TV at least once or twice a week.</li>
