      <li>I. Love.</li>
      <li>I love the idea that you can bend the handle, however when we went out of town and use it at my inlaws</li>
      <li>This is an excellent product, easy to use, and dries my hair quickly and gently.  </li>
      <li>It is very light and sleek, making it easy to manipulate and switch hands</li>
      <li>Warm and cool instanenously allows you to be in control for all hair types.</li>
      <li>out more air than the VS501&lt;br /&gt;Folds up for easy storage and travel&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Unlike another Conair I bought from Amazon years ago, this one has a cheap plastic smell that makes you worried that you might be touching something toxic.</li>
      <li>Compact and the handle folds up which my old one didn&#x27;t do, which is a great feature for traveling.  </li>
      <li>It is also very powerful without being overwhelming.</li>
      <li>Folds for easy storage.  </li>
      <li>Not as strong as I hoped, not as compact as I thought it would be</li>
      <li>They are all going strong.</li>

      <li>I have used it for months and works fine.</li>

      <li>Great blowdryer, I especially appreciate that it can fold up for portability.  </li>
      <li>I choose this after i compared with few hair dryers and very happy with this hair dryer...</li>
      <li>But, the most surprising thing of all is that my hair actually DOES shine when I&#x27;m done!  </li>
      <li>It blows through my hair like a strong wind and the temperatures range from hot to cool with a perfect warm in-between (my usual setting).  </li>
      <li>/&gt;It works great - warms up fast and the attachment it comes with helps me direct the air, so I&#x27;m not putting air where I don&#x27;t want it and making my hair poofy.  </li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s better than my old one which was a lot more powerful in</li>
      <li>It folds up, which is nice, and its lint guard just flips back and is easy to clean.</li>
      <li>Works really well :)</li>
      <li>This Ion Shine thing seems to be more than a gimmick, she really likes how it leaves her hair.</li>
      <li>Eliminates frizz quickly.</li>
      <li>Also shipped quickly.</li>
      <li>The Hot setting is comfortable.</li>
      <li>Very fast shipper too!  </li>
      <li>Light and strong enough for my hair because I just have fine hair....</li>
      <li>All round great blow dryer.</li>
      <li>More professional.</li>
      <li>/&gt;The Conair is a great buy with the features of a full size dryer packed into a small, fold-able, lightweight design.</li>
      <li>this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The handle and switches are positioned where your hand is holding the device far from where the dryer head is at the top</li>
      <li>Powerful.  </li>
      <li>It was very reasonably priced, quickly shipped and well packed.  </li>
      <li>used to just being able to switch settings on my blowdryer easily and continue to dry my hair without having to lower the blowdryer in front of my chest while it&#x27;s going.  </li>
      <li>High speed - dries hair quickly!</li>
      <li>hair dryer meets all three, plus the price is right.</li>
      <li>This dryer&#x27;s medium settings are just right.  </li>
      <li>It has 3 heat settings (cool, warm, hot) and 2 speeds (high, low), plus the cool shot button.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> When the right order did come, it was perfect !</li>
    <li> This is an excellent product, easy to use, and dries my hair quickly and gently.  The \\&quot;Ion shine\\&quot; element does seem to add a little something, but I can&#x27;t quite put my finger on it.  It was very reasonably priced, quickly shipped and well packed.  I am very pleased with the product.</li>
    <li> Lots of power behind the air, cool shot button AND cool setting, which I love because my old one only had the shot button which made me have to keep it held in entire time if I wanted cool air.......</li>
    <li> When I asked my wife to review this hair dryer, she said \\&quot;I dig it\\&quot;.  Have had it for a couple of months already, and it still works.  She seems real happy with the different settings...it apparently doesn&#x27;t fry her hair.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Bought this recently for a relative and used it a few times myself.  It is the best hairdryer I&#x27;ve ever used.  That may not be saying too much because admittedly I&#x27;m not big into hairstyling, but I&#x27;ve had to buy several new hair dryers (different brands) in the past year for various reasons, and this one was far and away much better than those.  After using it, my hair had no frizz, curled in the direction I wanted it to (by drying it with a round brush) -- which never happens with other hairdryers, and it stayed the way I wanted it to all day without the use of styling products.  I don&#x27;t know if that&#x27;s down to the ionic part, the ceramic part, or what.  I&#x27;ve tried dryers with the ionic feature alone, with the ceramic feature alone, and with both features together before, but they haven&#x27;t had the results that this one does.  The range of heat settings and airflow settings is great.  My hair doesn&#x27;t do well with dryers that only have high &amp; low, hot &amp; cold.  I need medium heat, medium air.  This dryer&#x27;s medium settings are just right.  The cold shot is good too.  On the negative side, it&#x27;s a bit heavy and it&#x27;s a bit long in the nozzle for me, so that my arm finds it difficult to reach over and dry my hair on the other side of my head without hitting my scalp with it.  But most dryers above the purely budget category are this heavy and this big, if not moreso.  I just wish that this brand were sold in the country I currently live in, but it is not (and it&#x27;s not dual-voltage).  Don&#x27;t let it put you off that this model is several years old now and isn&#x27;t in the \\&quot;hairdryer\\&quot; bestselling list on Amazon.</li>
    <li> I did quite a bit of research before pulling the trigger on a new hair dryer. I was a bit hesitant to get a fold-able travel dryer since their reviews don&#x27;t tend to be as good, however this one was the exception, which is why I went for it. The main features I was looking for in a new dryer was the weight, size, power and I would prefer it to be a ceramic dryer since they are healthier on your hair. My old dryer was the Vidal Sassoon VS501 1875W Ionic Sensor Touch Dryer. The VS501 lasted me several years and technically it still works. I&#x27;ve dropped it enough times that the front cover has broken making it a bit difficult to work the buttons. Below I have compared the two dryers:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conair 173RZ VS. Vidal Sassoon VS501&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conair 173RZ Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Lighter and smaller than the VS501, which is easier on my arm&lt;br /&gt;Puts out more air than the VS501&lt;br /&gt;Folds up for easy storage and travel&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conair 173RZ Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Not as hot as the VS501, but still drys hair just as fast if not faster due to the air flow&lt;br /&gt;Shorter cord than the VS501, which unless you need it can make it easier to store&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall Summery:&lt;br /&gt;The Conair is a great buy with the features of a full size dryer packed into a small, fold-able, lightweight design. The color isn&#x27;t my favorite, but the fact that it meets all my criteria and I can take it with me when I travel makes up for it.</li>
    <li> My favorite blow-dryer! Dries your hair fast (on Turbo setting) with minimal damage.     NOTE: For those with wavy hair, it tended to straighten out my curls a bit, but didn&#x27;t get rid of frizz so much.</li>
    <li> This is an OUTSTANDING hair dryer. What&#x27;s not to like?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife, who uses two different hair dryers to get the results she wants, is very picky.  And one of hers broke, and she gave me a long list of what a replacement had to do.  It had to have HOT hot, but adjustable down to cool. Cold shot would be good.  It had to BLOW, not just a little.  But it had to have gentle setting too. And when all was done, it had to leave her hair soft and silky, but not limp or frizzed.  And it has to not be heavy or cumbersome, but it has to last. What is a husband to do?  Why is it my job to find the perfect hair dryer?  But I did. This one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This hair dryer does it all. It is quiet but has powerful airflow, but adjusts down to soft zephyr. It has adjustable heat settings from really hot to warm to cool -- and cold shot button for good measure.  This Ion Shine thing seems to be more than a gimmick, she really likes how it leaves her hair. I tried it too, works for me also. And the handle folds against the body for compact storage. And the back pops open to clean the air filter grid. It is not too heavy, and not fragile either. Solid construction, good looks, should last a long time.  Like I said, what&#x27;s not to like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, the end of the story is that this is now her ONLY hairdryer, and I&#x27;m a hero.  :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What&#x27;s not to like?  Why buy anything else?  This has it all.  It&#x27;s a winner.</li>
    <li> My wife needed a new dryer and bought this because of the reviews. Its on the bigger size compare to the smaller dryers which we normally use. But its a slightly quieter as it does not struggle for air. The handle do fold to help with storing it everyday. Over all, we like it and hope that it last longer than other Conairs which we used before.</li>
    <li> Love it! The power, the light weight, the settings &amp; especially easy to pack because it folds up! I have fibromyalgia and my hands sometimes will not let me hold things. The grip on this is easy &amp; it&#x27;s light weight so it doesn&#x27;t hurt to hold it when drying my hair.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Conair hair-dryers for 20+ years. I stuck to this brand because they&#x27;ve always provided good merchandise that was a good value for the money. That long streak ended with this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;1. several different speed &amp; heat settings provide a useful array of options&lt;br /&gt;2. fairly inexpensive&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;1. there are two back filter screens; the outer one will not stay attached to the unit on the clip side, &amp; the closing latch is defective; I removed it entirely because it doesn&#x27;t seem to affect the operation of the unit considering that the second screen is built-in &amp; usable&lt;br /&gt;2. the hottest setting is not very hot&lt;br /&gt;3. the slide controls are not aligned well (they slip past the detents &amp; require too much force to push)&lt;br /&gt;4. overall cheap construction, even for this fairly low price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All of this results in a poorly made unit, &amp; not at all worth the price. A big disappointment for a dedicated Conair user. Time for me to look for another brand.</li>
    <li> I know some other reviewers have raved about this hair dryer. For me, it&#x27;s just okay. It gets the job done. I&#x27;ve got fine, thin hair, so most dryers will do that. And it does keep the static down a bit. I find it heavier and more awkward than my previous Sassoon dryer that used to have an ionizer function but does not now. The switches on this dryer are more difficult to work. They&#x27;re sliders that are only slightly elevated from the underlying plastic layer and have a narrow slightly elevated lip at on end that I suppose is designed to make them easier to move but doesn&#x27;t do much for me. It works, and I&#x27;m keeping it. But I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;d buy it again.</li>
    <li> A little disappointed.  This hair dryer is heavier than I expected and seems to take a long time to dry my hair.  Even with the diffuser, it blows my hair all over the place.  Guess I should have bought a compact hair dryer but was caught up in the \\&quot;ion shine ceramic\\&quot; gimmick.</li>
    <li> I choose this after i compared with few hair dryers and very happy with this hair dryer...Light and strong enough for my hair because I just have fine hair....I feel this is good for those with fine hair...</li>
    <li> Best. Hairdryer. Ever.  Blows hot, blows cold, blows hard, blows softly.  Folds for easy storage.  This one replaced an identical one I&#x27;ve used for years but dropped one too many times on the ceramic floor in the bath and finally managed to damage the folding mechanism so that it no longer would stay unfolded on its on.</li>
    <li> IT weighs a ton.  It has no \\&quot;blow\\&quot; power and takes FOREVER to dry my hair.  Once it&#x27;s dry, it&#x27;s flat.  Any natural waves have just given up the ghost, regardless of hair product used.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hate it. And I&#x27;ve replaced it.  Waste of money.</li>
    <li> This is a great blowdryer.  I had one before and this one is a little different, but it works great.  I love it!  Compact and the handle folds up which my old one didn&#x27;t do, which is a great feature for traveling.  High speed - dries hair quickly! Very fast shipper too!  Thanks! Love it!</li>
    <li> Light weight and very good heat control</li>
    <li> I received my Conair Hair Dryer and I love it. I had many other Conair dryer&#x27;s in the past and i find this one is a sure bet. Those flexible ones just don&#x27;t do the trick for me anymore. I like that it&#x27;s sturdy and it blows really well.</li>
    <li> This hair dryer isn&#x27;t top of the line but it is good for what you&#x27;re paying. My hair dries much more quickly and with less frizz than my old hair dryer, which is great because frizz is a definite problem with me. My hair looks more shiny and beautiful when I use this compared to letting it airdry. It folds up, which is nice, and its lint guard just flips back and is easy to clean. The concentrator attachment it comes with works well for straightening my stubbornly wavy hair.    Just don&#x27;t forget the turbo setting on the side of the dryer! I almost didn&#x27;t know it existed until I checked the directions for advice on using the attachment.</li>
    <li> My very long hair is hard on dryers. Despite being careful, once a month or so the air intake on a hair dryer will pull in a few strands which wrap themselves around something inside, causing the dryer to blow with less force.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If there&#x27;s a burning-hair smell, the dryer sometimes returns to normal once the hairs inside are destroyed. Or it may not. Experience has proven when there&#x27;s no smell, the hair has wrapped a mechanism which does not get hot. In that case, if the dryer doesn&#x27;t start operating normally within a minute or two, it never recovers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought the Conair Ion Shine at a drugstore, where the selection was not large, because I needed a dryer immediately. Of the half-dozen choices, this model boasted a hinged outer air intake filter over the regular one, filling me with hope that maybe my new dryer would not snatch the hair from my head and use the strands to commit suicide.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Right out of the box, the dryer blew with far less force than any I&#x27;d owned in years--and that&#x27;s a lot of dryers. So drying time was several minutes longer. (For shorter hair, the difference will be less, of course.) The hottest setting was uncomfortable, unlike other dryers, so I could use it only briefly when my hair was extremely wet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I did once stop a bit of hair via the hinged screen before it entered the second layer of filter, in only a few months it grabbed my hair, took it in before I could turn the dryer off, and pulled it out. The dryer barely pushed any air after that, and there was no hopeful burning-hair odor. Tanked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FWIW, the \\&quot;ion shine\\&quot; promised was undetectable. My hair was no shinier than with the many other dryers I&#x27;ve owned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This dryer may not present any problems for shorter hair, but it doesn&#x27;t have pluses to make it better than other, less expensive, dryers.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a lightweight, high-power hair dryer with lots of features (high/low, warm/hot, cold shot) ... and this one surpassed expectations. It is very light and sleek, making it easy to manipulate and switch hands/sides of head. It is also very powerful without being overwhelming. It dries my thick head of hair faster than my previous 3 dryers did. I can&#x27;t think of any criticism, except a curl diffuser attachment would have been nice.</li>
    <li> Have not used more than half dozen times, but find hair ultra shiny with more body than my previous small, folding hair dryer;  works well for traveling as it folds, but used as my only hair dryer as takes up less space.</li>
    <li> This is my third one of this model. One for me, one for my son and one for a friend.  They are all going strong. I love that there are so many options for the heating levels and blower speeds. It&#x27;s a great hair dryer!</li>
    <li> Cons: Too big to be a good travel dryer Not very powerful, even on the highest setting Takes a long time to dry my hair, and itâ€™s super short Does not seem very sturdy  Pros: Relatively quiet Decreases frizz</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m just a guy and my needs for a good hairdryer are the following:&lt;br /&gt;Good airflow&lt;br /&gt;Quiet&lt;br /&gt;Drys the hair quickly&lt;br /&gt;This hair dryer meets all three, plus the price is right.</li>
    <li> After several years of daily used, my trusty Conair 1875 finally quit on me.  Knowing that over the years there had been many an upgrade to hand-held blow-dryers, I spent about half a day reading through all the reviews on Amazon and checking out Consumer Reports (the latter being not much help in this area, I have to say).  This little jewel seemed to fit my needs:  quiet, light, multiple temperature selections and speeds, and a \\&quot;cool\\&quot; setting, too.  Plus, it had that fancy-shmancy ion stuff that&#x27;s supposed to make your hair shine (although my thought on that was, \\&quot;yeah, right\\&quot;).  I have to admit, too, that I am partial to Conair as I have found that they last for YEARS and provide a nice powerful flow of air that helps me style my usually short hair.  Well, this new Conair 173RZ Ion Shine Ceramic Turbo hair dryer is now my new love.  It blows through my hair like a strong wind and the temperatures range from hot to cool with a perfect warm in-between (my usual setting).  The slide temp/power selection system is not my preference, as my thumb sometimes slips and I end up with the wrong setting for a second, but I am getting used to it.  It gets my hair dry in less than a minute.  While the dryer is not what I would call a whisper, it is not as loud as my previous Conair and for that I am thankful.  A nice little extra is that it folds in half at the top of the handle - great if you have storage issues.  But, the most surprising thing of all is that my hair actually DOES shine when I&#x27;m done!  I have salt and pepper hair and the \\&quot;salt\\&quot; gleams like sparkling silver threads afterwards.  What a treat!  So, I gave this baby five stars and hope to have it around for four or five years like all the other Conairs before it.</li>
    <li> Great blowdryer, I especially appreciate that it can fold up for portability.  Very handy for those on the move.  Anyway it is quiet and works very quickly.  I have super thick, long hair so I know a good blow dryer when I find it.</li>
    <li> This is by far the best ion hair dryer on the market. I have used other ion hair dryers that would take about 7 minutes to dry my hair. With the Conair hair dryer it takes less than 5 minutes. It does not leave my hair feeling dried out like it would with other hair dryers. If you want a very efficient hair dryer then you need this one.</li>
    <li> it met my expectations, not too loud. works pretty well, i dont see any difference with the ionic technology, but it wasnt too expensive.</li>
    <li> Bigger than I thought it was going to be. Was hoping for a smaller one but thats what I get for ordering online! Works wonderful and I would recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> Great quality for the price. Eliminates frizz quickly. Very quiet, but very efficient and easy to pack.</li>
    <li> good dryer for the price</li>
    <li> Like the options this high tech dryer allows. Warm and cool instanenously allows you to be in control for all hair types.</li>
    <li> I have used it for months and works fine. I love the idea that you can bend the handle, however when we went out of town and use it at my inlaws place the blower on the back suddenly pop off and brake whatever inside :( and cant use it anymore</li>
    <li> Love the versatility of this blow dryer. It has 3 heat settings (cool, warm, hot) and 2 speeds (high, low), plus the cool shot button. However, on a very hot day I can still style my hair on cool without having to get my head hot or continuously hold down the &amp;#34;cool shot&amp;#34; button as is common in most dryers. Plus it has a folding handle, so it takes up less space in the bathroom and isn&#x27;t too heavy or too loud. All round great blow dryer.</li>
    <li> My wife finds this a good product and she has very thick mass of hair. I, alas, am bald.</li>
    <li> Great hair dryer. I like that it has a cool blowing feature because in the summer time I can dry my hair without heat. Works fine for me.&lt;br /&gt;The handle is a little big and awkward to hold when I switch it to my left hand but if I hold it up at the top it&#x27;s okay. The pros outweigh the cons for me!</li>
    <li> Great! Quiet, quick, pretty. Lots of setting options. Dries much quicker than my other dryer.  Less frizz too. Definitely my favorite dryer I&#x27;ve had. More professional. Also shipped quickly. I&#x27;d recommend.</li>
    <li> Conair 1875 Watt Ionic Ceramic Folding Handle Hair Dryer is compact but has the power to get hair dry in a hurry!  great price and fast delivery!</li>
    <li> Not as powerful as expected, but the fact that you can fold it really helps. Not the greatest but okay</li>
    <li> Quickly dries my short hair without over-heating. The Hot setting is comfortable. Maybe it&#x27;s the &amp;#34;ionic&amp;#34; feature that keeps the hair from looking flyaway during this winter weather</li>
    <li> Not as strong as I hoped, not as compact as I thought it would be but it&#x27;s better than my old one which was a lot more powerful in it&#x27;s better days until it went bad.</li>
    <li> I got this for my self I have a lot of hair and really frizzy curlier hair I need it something that will dry my hair on 20mint. not 1hr. like other dryiers amd this one does and if itson summer I just use the cold or mild heath and no sweet all good for all season and type of stile I want to do curlie or stray</li>
    <li> Awesome product.. I would recommend it to anyone</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s definitely not as good as the last Conair 1875-Watt dryer I had for 4-5 years. The dryer doesn&#x27;t feel as powerful and the high setting feels more like the low setting on my old dryer.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this dryer for about four months now.  I don&#x27;t use it every day, but I use it about 4-5 days/week.  My hair is chin-length, and it does the job well.  It doesn&#x27;t leave my hair overly frizzy, but I think my hair will frizz no matter what.  I know it can be bent for more compact storage but I don&#x27;t do that.  It&#x27;s pretty quiet and pretty light weight.  I&#x27;m happy with the purchase for the price and I&#x27;d buy it again.</li>
    <li> Product worked well while it lasted, but less than a year out, it is dead. My wife and daughter have long hair and it would occasionally \\&quot;shut off\\&quot; due to heat. This last time, it never came back. This is the shortest time we have ever had a hair dryer last.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s noisy.  I knew when I bought it that it wasn&#x27;t silent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works great - warms up fast and the attachment it comes with helps me direct the air, so I&#x27;m not putting air where I don&#x27;t want it and making my hair poofy.  I like that it has separate switches for temp and how fast the air is coming out.  The controls are side -by- side on the handle.  On the handle there is the option for warm and hot, and the one next to it has low and high.  There is a \\&quot;cool\\&quot; button on the back up by the mesh (when pressing this, it takes about 2 seconds for it to blow cool) - and on the side of the barrel there is the option for \\&quot;turbo on and turbo off\\&quot; - this gives 4 speeds of air flow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just make sure the handle is all the way up, otherwise it will start to fold down on you. It does sort of \\&quot;catch\\&quot; in two places, so it won&#x27;t close on your hand - there is also an inch and a half/two inch gap, so it&#x27;s impossible to hurt your hand. I use it on my hair and also on beeswax sheets for rolling candles.  Works really well :)</li>
    <li> It was much larger than I expected as it was to be used for travel.</li>
    <li> Unlike another Conair I bought from Amazon years ago, this one has a cheap plastic smell that makes you worried that you might be touching something toxic. To add insult to injury, the purple plastic of the iron is not the slick metallic looking plastic from the packaging, but rather a gaudy-looking pageant queen light purple.</li>
    <li> As of now no complaints, It&#x27;s quiet and does the job.</li>
    <li> his dryer replaces my old one which is cumbersome and bulkier.  Does a great job.</li>
    <li> lightweight, quiet, works fast &amp; keeps my hair feeling soft not all &amp;#34;dried out&amp;#34;.  handle folds for easy storing.  Glad I got it!</li>
    <li> I ordered this Conair Hair Dryer back in June of 2012.  I have had many Conair hair dryers over the years and have always been very happy with them.  I would get many years of use out of them before they finally succumbed.  When my previous hair dryer died I again wanted a Conair since I had good luck with them so I ordered this one.  I loved this dryer all the way up until today.  While drying my hair it just died after about 5 minutes of use.  My hair is not long, just below my shoulder, and usually takes me about 10 to 15 minutes to completely dry depending on time of year.  I thought that maybe I just blew the ALCI so I followed the Operating Instructions to try and reset it.  No luck.  So I let it sit for a couple of hours to then try again....still no luck.  It is dead.  Again, I have had other Conair hair dryers that lasted for many years with no problems.&lt;br /&gt;So because this particular dryer only lasting just under 13 months I am giving it the one star.  I haven&#x27;t given up on Conair.  I will continue to buy Conair hoping my next one will last longer.</li>
    <li> The blowdrying function works fine, but it&#x27;s quite big and heavy and the handle and the switches are poorly positioned that makes it even more awkward to use.  I&#x27;ve had blowdryers of similar size and weight, or even bigger, but I never felt so awkward using one as I did with this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The handle and switches are positioned where your hand is holding the device far from where the dryer head is at the top, the physics of it makes it weigh even more on your arm.  The heat and on/off switches are located at a spot where it is very difficult to push/slide with my thumb while holding up the blowdryer normally. To adjust the setting or to turn it on or off, I would have to lower it in front of me and carefully balance it with one hand to turn the switches toward me, often while intense hot air is blowing in my face, so that my thumb can be at a good enough angle to be able to push the switches without twisting a muscle in my hand.  Sometimes my arm would have already gotten too tired from using the blowdryer so when it comes time to adjust the heat or turn it off, I&#x27;d lean it on the bathroom counter to push the switch instead of doing the whole one hand balancing maneuver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m used to just being able to switch settings on my blowdryer easily and continue to dry my hair without having to lower the blowdryer in front of my chest while it&#x27;s going.  The motion is similar to someone trying to find the mute button on their TV remote when they hear their phone ringing. There is the same panic and irritation from wanting to stop the loudness and the hot air that&#x27;s blowing everywhere except at my hair, and having difficulty reaching or finding that off button!  To sum up, it&#x27;s just a pain to use.</li>
    <li> I. Love. It.  My new Conair 173RZ Ion Shine Ceramic Turbo 1875 Watt Hair Dryer is everything you could ever want in a blow dryer.  I have chemically straightened hair and it drys it very fast with no frizz.  Great ease of styling.  Powerful.  I don&#x27;t have to use the flat iron half as much after my hair has been dried with this dryer.  I highly recommend it!!</li>
    <li> I bought this dryer to replace my old one which seemed to be one step away from burning down my house. My old one had only two settings, low and high, and two temperatures. This dryer has the same settings basically, including a cool setting. The problem for me is that when on the high setting, it blows too forcefully but on low it is not really enough &amp;#34;oomph&amp;#34;. It does have a &amp;#34;boost&amp;#34; setting to the fan speed and I&#x27;ve been using it on low with the boost and low heat setting, since high seems too intense. It really is a fine dryer, but I guess I miss my old one. I certainly don&#x27;t notice improved smoothness or shine with this dryer. It folds nicely for storage but still seems sturdy.</li>
    <li> I have thick hair and it is really hard to get my hair dries in under 30 min but this hair dryer does it everytime. love the fact that the handle folds to save space and as its been dropped  a few times i know it is well put together and sturdy i would recommend tis product.</li>
    <li> This dryer is very cheaply made.  I used it once; did not work second time. I went to Rite Aid and bought a small Conair travel dryer (which I&#x27;ve had before). Great dryer!</li>
    <li> We purchased this as a Christmas gift for my mom since she needed a new one. it works great and does the job. no issues yet. it was packaged and looked brand new. Got here on time before Christmas as promised. thanks again.</li>
    <li> Bought as gift.....it is just as advertised, does work well &amp; durable for a year now!</li>
    <li> Nice and quiet and very powerful...dries my hair quickly and without any frizz thanks to the ceramic and ionic features.  Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I like this dryer but it is a little bit larger than I wanted.  Work really well and is not too loud.</li>
    <li> I am convinced that this is the best blowdryer ever. My shoulder-length hair is dry in no time at all (when the turbo is turned on). I had one that I loved for several years and immediately replaced it when it broke (after 10 years of daily duty).</li>
    <li> I never actually thought that a hairdryer could be different from any other hair dryers. Unbeknownst to me, I was sorely mistaken. This keeps the static out! And I admit that I have quite a mane of hair, and this drys it in record speeds. A lot of customization with temp/speed/air flow. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Works well.  The only complaint I have is that the switches are cumbersome.</li>
    <li> This hair dryer works really fast on Turbo and my hair feels very soft when it&#x27;s dry.  I really like it!</li>
