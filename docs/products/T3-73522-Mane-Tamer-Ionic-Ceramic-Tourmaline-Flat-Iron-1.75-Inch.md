      <li>so I&#x27;m hoping this one is just as good.</li>
      <li>The T3 ManeTamer is a fantastic product; it impressed me after just opening the box.</li>
      <li>I am very pleased with my purchase.  </li>
      <li>I took very good care of it and never wrapped the cord around it when traveling and kept it clean.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had this straightener for about a month now and it has been phenomenal!</li>
      <li>I LOVE THIS THING!</li>
      <li>It works great, and most importantly makes my hair LOOK great.</li>
      <li>it is light weight, great for travelling.  </li>
      <li>But I&#x27;m sure the upgraded version from T3 is just as good.</li>
      <li>They tell me it is a nice one and they like it.</li>
      <li>Comes in nice storage box.&lt;br /&gt;Good</li>
      <li>The cleaning cloth is a nice addition as the gunk can build up on these things, and it also makes for a nice pad to lay the iron on to prevent any kind of heat damage.</li>
      <li>So I put a towel over my shoulders and kind of suffered through it..</li>
      <li>Great product and worth every penny!</li>
      <li>The cord swivels, which is great, and it has a velcro strip attached to it like most laptop cords do, allowing you to easily fold the cord up for when you&#x27;re not using it.</li>
      <li>I had a T3 before but blew it in Europe - it was the wet-or-dry one and was really good, but now I&#x27;m glad it blew because this one is even better.  </li>
      <li>not as good as the original.</li>
      <li>I was told many salons use this T3 brand.</li>
      <li>Then bought this model which I love even more because the wider plates get the job done even faster.</li>
      <li>And I am sure that the seller and t3 will say it is my fault</li>
      <li>I absolutely love it!&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I am so turned off by the attitude of the manufacturer, that despite how much I love this product, I would be reluctant to purchase it again.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure there are comparable substitutes.   </li>
      <li>I love this Iron, it truly is a &amp;#34;one sweep&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>It even has a row of rhinestones on the handle which I love.</li>
      <li>THE PRICE IS MUCH BETTER THAN THAT OF A NORDSTROM OR HAIR SALON PLACE.  </li>
      <li>, rubes pay me 5 bucks for a chance at winning a poster of lady gaga that cost me $1.50 from amazon.</li>
      <li>able to curl my hair with this straightener</li>
      <li>My hair comes out much better using the Mane Tamer</li>
      <li>shipping was not speedy but not terrible</li>
      <li>Even better, when it rains, my hair does not frizz.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I really love that about this straightener.</li>
      <li>I now have another brand that I like much better</li>
      <li>i love the results of the iron, it straightens my coarse, frizzy hair perfectly.</li>
      <li>Hell most nights I just fall asleep on the couch still wearing the dickies I put on the day before.</li>
      <li>My daughter loves this flat iron and said it&#x27;s the best one she has ever had.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
      <li>Its the best flat iron I have ever use.  </li>
      <li>but I just was not that impressed with this flat iron.</li>
      <li>It is truly the best Flat Iron I have ever owned!</li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re considering buying one here on Amazon, I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ll love it, but do check with the seller first and be sure that they are \\&quot;authorized\\</li>
      <li>Did a great job at first, and I have been pretty meticulous about not wrapping the cord incorrectly</li>
      <li>Then it was fine for a while and now doesn&#x27;t heat again.  </li>
      <li>It does the job fine, but nothing to rave about.</li>
      <li>very hot water dripped out of the iron and burned my shoulders!</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t feel flimsy or cheap.</li>
      <li>If it was used someone else would have already filled out the registration.</li>
      <li>totally amazing, really.  </li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product to anyone who wants perfect, effortless pin-straight hair... FAST.</li>
      <li>It heats up super quick and I love the temperature controls.</li>
      <li>Well worth the price!  </li>
      <li>the original one is made in korea.</li>
      <li>chi straightener (the red holiday edition one which I hear isn&#x27;t as good as the original)</li>
      <li>This flat iron is great and so worth the money.</li>
      <li>and I love it just as much.</li>
      <li>I should also note that my hair is fairly shortat the moment, and I did not find the larger plate size to be a hindrance with styling..</li>
      <li>I went to sleep with it and in the morning, surprisingly, my hair maintained its straight form, and pretty much til the day I wash it again.</li>
      <li>Heats quickly and smooths hair easily.&lt;br /&gt;Wish</li>
      <li>Well, I quickly turned around and bought the replacement T3.  </li>
      <li>The sellers decription was right on, and shipping was fast...:)</li>
      <li>This is possibly the best flat iron I have ever come in contact with.</li>
      <li>I have fairly short hair, but this flat iron work perfectly.</li>
      <li>It turns on and the light blinks but it never gets hot.  </li>
      <li>It gets super hot very quickly, and is actually able to straighten my naturally wavy hair.  </li>
      <li>Wonderful shiny straight hair with very little effort on my part.   </li>
      <li>I have tried many straighteners and I bought this one because I was looking to try some new ones.</li>
      <li>I have been lookng for a new straightner, but wasnt sure which one to buy.  </li>
      <li>I first tried it with damp wet hair and it gaved me great result</li>
      <li>Defiitely my first choice!</li>
      <li>I have to pass over my hair a couple of times for it to be satisfactorily straight, but that&#x27;s fine,</li>
      <li>My hair comes out straight, smooth and silky and I haven&#x27;t had any heat damage.</li>
      <li>It is smooth and shiny and perfectly straight.</li>
      <li>IT IS WELL WORTH</li>
      <li>It mostly does the job but in my opinion, its nothing to rave about and for the price I expected a lot more.</li>
      <li>The price might seem a bit steep, but if you have stubborn hair, this product is SO worth the money.</li>
      <li>This flatiron heats up pretty quick and i would pass this over my hair maybe once or twice to get the desired effect.</li>
      <li>This product is all right.</li>
      <li>But if you&#x27;re going to buy this save the box and register it right away because yours will probably break too</li>
      <li>This straightener smooths them right out in minutes.</li>
      <li>I used it right out of the shower on towel dried hair, and it worked amazing!</li>

    <li> I had a T3 before but blew it in Europe - it was the wet-or-dry one and was really good, but now I&#x27;m glad it blew because this one is even better.  My hair comes out much better using the Mane Tamer and I don&#x27;t need to re-do it every morning as I had to with the wet-or-dry.  Even better, when it rains, my hair does not frizz.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried several other flat irons (Saphire, Maxiglide, and Instyler) and none of them compare to this one.  It blows the rest completely out of the water.  I Highly recommend this.</li>
    <li> Love that it works on wet hair.  I still have to pair it with my hair dryer but my hair is straighter, faster then the older T3 model that I had.  I worry about damage to my hair but it feels good so far and the results last for a second day.</li>
    <li> Having previously owned another T3 straightener that finally died after 9 years of use, I bought this yesterday.  I used it right out of the shower on towel dried hair, and it worked amazing! I have very long ( to almost my waist)  thick curly hair. It is smooth and shiny and perfectly straight. Recommend it!</li>
    <li> I love T3 products!!! This is my second one and I love it just as much. It works great on my wavy, frizzy, Florida hair. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> This is possibly the best flat iron I have ever come in contact with. The price might seem a bit steep, but if you have stubborn hair, this product is SO worth the money. I have thick, curly hair and have been trying to find a quality flat iron for quite some time. This is it. I literally only have to go over a section of hair ONCE (this has NEVER happened to me with other irons), which has cut my average straightening time in half. It works just as well, if not better, on towel-dried hair. You get the same pin-straight results, and the steam really seems to make my hair softer and shinier. The wet-to-dry technology itself cuts out the need for a blow-dryer.     Cosmetically, the product is very well manufactured; you can tell it&#x27;s a professional flat iron. It doesn&#x27;t feel flimsy or cheap. It even has a row of rhinestones on the handle which I love. The cord swivels, which is great, and it has a velcro strip attached to it like most laptop cords do, allowing you to easily fold the cord up for when you&#x27;re not using it. The product also comes with a little heat-resistant mat that protects your counters from the iron&#x27;s heat.     The T3 ManeTamer is a fantastic product; it impressed me after just opening the box. It works great, and most importantly makes my hair LOOK great. I highly recommend this product to anyone who wants perfect, effortless pin-straight hair... FAST.</li>
    <li> I actually bought this flat iron to replace the exact same model after I lost that one on a vacation. But before I bought my second T3, I bought an expensive iron from my local discount retailer.  Well, I quickly turned around and bought the replacement T3.  With my old and new T3&#x27;s, I am able to straighten my hair in just one pass (which my stylist says is critical to maintaining healthy hair).  My hair doesn&#x27;t catch in the iron and tug/break.  I&#x27;ve used the iron on my wet hair and found that it doesn&#x27;t work for my hair texture.  Now I exclusively use it dry. So glad to be back to using my T3!</li>
    <li> I just bought this item on Oct. 16th from Beauty Bonanza. They delivered it immediately! Great service. However the manufacturer, located in Gardena, CA does not offer good customer service at all! Not only were they short and dismissive when I wrote to them, but they refuse to allow me to register the product for warranty because Amazon is not an authorized seller. So, I just spent $135 (plus $5 shipping) and I can&#x27;t register it, so I now have no warranty. I think their policy is horrible! Everyone orders stuff online, so why wouldn&#x27;t you honor the warranty if the product is new?! If I have a registration card, it&#x27;s NEW! If it was used someone else would have already filled out the registration. I loved the T3-- this is the second one I&#x27;ve bought. I bought the first one online, too, but no one ever contacted me to say the registration was no good because I bought it on Amazon. I am so turned off by the attitude of the manufacturer, that despite how much I love this product, I would be reluctant to purchase it again. I&#x27;m sure there are comparable substitutes.   If you&#x27;re considering buying one here on Amazon, I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ll love it, but do check with the seller first and be sure that they are \\&quot;authorized\\&quot; or you may be disappointed if your product needs repair-- it won&#x27;t be covered.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m surprised after reading the (mostly) positive reviews here but I just was not that impressed with this flat iron. It mostly does the job but in my opinion, its nothing to rave about and for the price I expected a lot more. It does heat up fast which is a plus, but for my thick, coarse hair it doesn&#x27;t seem to get hot enough. It says it heats up to 450, and I think maybe I got a dud because compared to my previous flat irons, it didn&#x27;t seem nearly as hot and maybe that&#x27;s the problem. I use it on the hottest setting and it still takes several passes to get one small section of hair straight, it still leaves my hair rather frizzy and it frequently catches my hair in the plates and pullsa few out each time I used it. And this is just a small complaint, but the small little jewels in the handle fell out the first day I used it. Overall it seems a bit cheaply made, but I was desperate because my other flat iron died so I kept it. I now have another brand that I like much better and i&#x27;ll keep this one on hand for backup but I likely wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
    <li> After much research to find the best flat iron that is also not at an outrageous price, I found this T3. I had my eyes on the Sedu for a very long time too but I just couldn&#x27;t throw in a $100+ for a flat iron on my asian (non-curly) hair. If you&#x27;ve got coarse curly hair, the Sedu would work really well, and I have seen the results from a friend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This T3 is just like what I was looking for. I have hair that is slightly damaged and slightly straight but sleeping on my waist long hair really makes my hair \\&quot;weird\\&quot; in the mornings. I like the nice looking box that it comes in, with the velcro to hold the wire, I especially like the larger plates of 1.75\\&quot;. My first try was before I went to bed (because I can&#x27;t get up early enough to fix my hair in the morning). It took less than 20 mins to straighten and I&#x27;m happy with the results. I went to sleep with it and in the morning, surprisingly, my hair maintained its straight form, and pretty much til the day I wash it again. I also tried it with wet hair, you can hear the sizzles but it also straightens my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only drawback I had was it didn&#x27;t give me the shine I wanted. My hair still shines but just not as good as the just-stepped-out-of-the-salon shine, if you know what I mean. But it&#x27;s probably due to my damaged locks. I can now throw away my generic revelon flat iron and don&#x27;t have to feel guilty about it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I really like this. I was told many salons use this T3 brand.</li>
    <li> THE PRICE IS MUCH BETTER THAN THAT OF A NORDSTROM OR HAIR SALON PLACE.  IT IS WELL WORTH THE MONEY.  MY DAUGHTERS HAVE THICK,THICK, FRIZZY, CURLY UNRULY AND MUCH HAIR.  THIS TAKES ME HALF THE TIME THAN ANY OTHER IRON I HAVE USED ON THEM.</li>
    <li> not as good as the original. i thought i ordered the same one i had before. this one is made in china. the original one is made in korea. i wish the seller would have included in the description where it was made.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a shame this product is not in stock...I absolutely love it!&lt;br /&gt;I have very long thick Indian hair, which at baseline is wavy and frizzy and this straightener has completely changed the way I manage my hair.&lt;br /&gt;It is fully heated in about 2 minutes, and has controls to set the temperature...obviously I crank it up with my hair.&lt;br /&gt;The straightner can be used on damp hair, though I usually air dry it overnight and use it in the morning and it works great even if my hair isn&#x27;t bone dry.&lt;br /&gt;I have been able to cut my straightening time in half with this product.&lt;br /&gt;Plus it is light weight, great for travelling.  I would never leave home without it!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m also able to curl my hair with this straightener...check out youtube for instructions on how to do this!&lt;br /&gt;The plates are high quality and are easy to clean, especially with product build up since i use a number of products on my hair prior to straightening.&lt;br /&gt;I hope this straightener lasts forever because it looks like it&#x27;s not available anymore and that is a shame.  But I&#x27;m sure the upgraded version from T3 is just as good.</li>
    <li> This flat iron is great and so worth the money. I have very curly hair resistant to straightening. This got my hair completely straight in half the time and lasted for a week. I would totally recommend it.</li>
    <li> I have tried many straighteners and I bought this one because I was looking to try some new ones. This product is all right. It does the job fine, but nothing to rave about. I use it, but if I were to buy a replacement when the time comes, I dont think I would be buy it again. Overall, it does a decent job though.</li>
    <li> This straightener really does the trick. I usually wake up with funky bumps and waves in my hair from going to bed with it a little damp. This straightener smooths them right out in minutes. Great product!</li>
    <li> I love this flat iron, I had an old one that I had used for years.  Getting this new flat iron has cut lots of time from my hair straighting.  This flat iron heats up fast and has sufficient cord to move around.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a few months of using this flat iron, it wouldn&#x27;t stay turned on.  It would heat up but anytime I picked it up to use it, it would shut off.  I had to replace it in less than six months.  I will have to change my review with DON&#x27;T BUY THIS FLAT IRON.</li>
    <li> My wife has had this for 14 months.  Starting about five months ago, sometimes it wouldn&#x27;t heat.  A little shake and it would start working.  Then it was fine for a while and now doesn&#x27;t heat again.  Even though there is a two year warranty, you have to send them $14.99 and wait three weeks after they \\&quot;evaluate it\\&quot;.  And they will only honor the warranty if you register within 21 days of purchase.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Really disappointed with this product.  I spent a fair amount of money for a \\&quot;professional\\&quot; iron for my wife and this is far from it.</li>
    <li> In the reviews it was being compared to CHI so I bought it. Unfortunately this is nothing compared to CHI. i wish I had bought CHI which I did ultimately.</li>
    <li> I have very thick and coarse hair down to my lower back. After years of screwing around with a variety of less expensive, inferior irons, I finally grew some (balls, not hair) and broke down and ordered the T3. The price was really intimidating but I was desperate so I crossed my fingers and bought it. It arrived before the estimated date and when I pulled it out of its packaging, WOW! was I impressed.  For starters, it&#x27;s a quality-made appliance - nothing shoddy about it.  I ran right in, washed my hair, towel dried it and went to work... totally amazing, really.  Talk about FLAT! The steam is wonderful and it doesn&#x27;t damage hair - even the ends. I LOVE THIS THING! It&#x27;s cut my flat-ironing time in HALF! I would totally recommend this to anyone whose hair is resistant to regular irons. Well worth the price!  (P.S. I like it better on wet hair than on dry.)</li>
    <li> This is my second T3 flat iron and I love it. My first one (T3 83922) I had for about six years and I accidentally blew it out on a trip to Europe. So I decided to stick with another T3. I bought this one instead of the one I had before because it&#x27;s newer and it has great reviews. So far it works just as good as my previous one. It&#x27;s also dual voltage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have wavy hair with some curls, so when I wash my hair I let it air dry or blow dry it, then flat iron. I never flat iron my wet hair, even though it says you can, because my hair stylist said it&#x27;s really bad for your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please note that you CANNOT register this flat iron with T3 for warranty if you buy it from Amazon or eBay. Found that out after I bought it. Not a big deal because I had my last one for six years so I&#x27;m hoping this one is just as good.</li>
    <li> I am unable to really rate this item as I purchased it as a Christmas gift. I hope it will be well received!</li>
    <li> I have been drooling over this flat iron for a while and finally decided to fork over the money to buy it after my old iron broke. I&#x27;m very glad I did! I just received it today and immediately took it for a spin.   I first decided to try it on my unwashed and already dry hair (that had not been styled because my previous flat iron had broken).. it worked beautifully! Wonderful shiny straight hair with very little effort on my part.   So then I jumped in the shower because I was anxious to try it on my wet hair. I thoroughly towel dried my hair, but my hair is very dense and thick (not ethnic, but very very thick), and tends to absorb water like a sponge and therefore take forever to dry. But I did feel that my hair was as dry as I could possibly get it using a towel. So, I started to flat iron it with the iron at the highest temp (I know my hair won&#x27;t straighten otherwise), and I got kind of a nasty little surprise as I pulled the iron down my hair.. very hot water dripped out of the iron and burned my shoulders! That said, I can&#x27;t really knock the flat iron for that.. I think it might just be yet another annoying feature about my hair that most folks probably do not have to deal with. I know I read hundreds of reviews about this iron before purchasing and have not heard anyone else complain of this. So I put a towel over my shoulders and kind of suffered through it.. it seemed to take about two passes to mostly dry and straighten my hair, but it didn&#x27;t really straighten in at the angle or with the shine I expected. I did eventually get my hair dry, but did not get it looking the way I wanted, and I was sort of afraid to keep flat ironing it for fear of damaging my hair.   So I waited a few hours until I was certain my hair was totally dry, and tried again, and just like the first time I tried with totally dry hair, it was a great experience. Fast, perfectly straight, and shiny hair that looked just the way I like it. I should also note that my hair is fairly shortat the moment, and I did not find the larger plate size to be a hindrance with styling.. in fact, I think it was helpful in straightening my hair faster. It&#x27;s a pretty remarkable little gadget!  My plan is to continue using my T3 hair dryer to dry my hair (if you don&#x27;t own one of those, drop everything and buy one immediately!), and then style using this flat iron as usual. Despite the burning water dripping on my shoulder, I still think this product deserves 5 stars!</li>
    <li> Even though I actually bought this on myhabit(and paid next to nothing),  because its an affiliate I wanted to post this review! So I have extremely thick, dry, curly hair! I use it personally in combination with my electric hot comb to get the kinks out THEN I use this baby to make it sleek and shiny! Obviously if it can maintain my unruly hair then it is a MUST-HAVE especially for us in-home salon divas out there!</li>
    <li> I have used various straightners over the years. Remington, Chi , Revlon, but once i started using T3 I haven&#x27;t looked back. Started with the 1 inch, which was awesome, think I wore it out after about 2 years. Then bought this model which I love even more because the wider plates get the job done even faster. Prior straightners would take me upwards of an hour to get the job done, with this one my wavy, somewhat course hair is done in about 20-25 minutes max. It heats up super quick and I love the temperature controls. The cleaning cloth is a nice addition as the gunk can build up on these things, and it also makes for a nice pad to lay the iron on to prevent any kind of heat damage. All in all, I&#x27;d highly recommend the t3 irons! Defiitely my first choice!</li>
    <li> Greetings fellow amazonians my trailermate eugene brought this along when he moved in a week back. He uses it to put the crease in his pants. Since we work at a traveling carnival I told him that he doesn&#x27;t need to do this, but he is always talking about looking professional for his shift. Hell most nights I just fall asleep on the couch still wearing the dickies I put on the day before. I don&#x27;t think I would ever spend 200 bones on a small iron that puts creases in your pants, but who am I to judge, rubes pay me 5 bucks for a chance at winning a poster of lady gaga that cost me $1.50 from amazon. Thanks amazon for keeping eugene broke.</li>
    <li> This iron is great but it might by drying out my  hair a bit.  I don&#x27;t like to use it when my hair is wet because it actually straightens better dry.</li>
    <li> I have very course, thick hair that is very difficult to flat iron.  I loved this iron as it is a nice size, not too small or big, cut down my time, would heat up very quickly and kept a consistent temperature.  However I bought this in Oct 2012 and it has stopped working - only about 4 months. I took very good care of it and never wrapped the cord around it when traveling and kept it clean.  The one day it shorted out (frying a section of my hair in the process) and then stopped heating.  It turns on and the light blinks but it never gets hot.  So disappointed as this is a lot of money to spend.  As another poster mentioned T3 does not see Amazon as an authorized retailer.  But if you&#x27;re going to buy this save the box and register it right away because yours will probably break too</li>
    <li> I have purchased numerous flat irons in my day and this T3 is by far the most effective!  It gets super hot very quickly, and is actually able to straighten my naturally wavy hair.  It looks like a professional styling even after a few days.</li>
    <li> anyone else have the problem of the flatiron shutting itself off in the middle of doing your hair???&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;it keeps happening to me, over and over. i love the results of the iron, it straightens my coarse, frizzy hair perfectly. but it&#x27;s annoying to have to turn it back on every every couple of passes.  not sure if this is a defective unit or if that&#x27;s typical of this item.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;and now i read that Amazon isn&#x27;t an \\&quot;authorized seller\\&quot; of this, so the warranty isn&#x27;t valid???&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;did i spend all this money on a product that i have to turn on every minute?</li>
    <li> Its the best flat iron I have ever use.  I first tried it with damp wet hair and it gaved me great result</li>
    <li> Wasted money! Great reviews, expensive and dies after a year!  Now I have to purchase a new one! And I am sure that the seller and t3 will say it is my fault so why bother trying to return!</li>
    <li> Although I love this flat iron, it is NOT the dual voltage flat iron I wanted, even though the description says it is worldwide voltage -- very misleading.</li>
    <li> I took this to Europe this summer and it completely blew out the first time I plugged it into a transformer. It does not have world-wide voltage.</li>
    <li> I have fairly short hair, but this flat iron work perfectly. My hair is always shiny, not dried out, and the straightness lasts a long time, even through humid Florida weather. I would definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> does not work well when my hair is wet.  Just like a regular flat iron.  I prefer the Bellezza Lumino.</li>
    <li> Works well. Comes in nice storage box.&lt;br /&gt;Good quality. Heats quickly and smooths hair easily.&lt;br /&gt;Wish there was a way to clamp it closed when not in use.</li>
    <li> I bought two of these for less than what I had originally spent for the one I bought for my wife several years ago.</li>
    <li> I had owned a T3 previously and I loved it.  Unfortunately, I let the cord sit on the hot Iron, and it was unsafe to use.  I paid $125 for my last one, so I jumped at the chance to get this at such a great price.  I love that I don&#x27;t have to dry my super long hair all the way, before I use this iron.  The plates are nice and wide, and it makes hair straight and shiny!  It is truly the best Flat Iron I have ever owned!</li>
    <li> Love T3&#x27;s but the width of this one makes it a little hard on my thin hair, and I can&#x27;t really curl with it either. I would have rather had a 1\\&quot; because it&#x27;s easier on my hair and I can curl with it. I am considering taking it back.</li>
    <li> I have had several flat irons, and this one did work well for approximately 2-3 months...then it started turning off mid-use (after the first section of hair) and has since then become very frustrating to use. It now takes me 20 minutes to straight iron my hair, instead of 5. Did a great job at first, and I have been pretty meticulous about not wrapping the cord incorrectly so I&#x27;m not sure what went wrong. Unfortunately broke outside of return window, which is pretty frustrating. Would suggest going for other, higher rated flat irons.</li>
    <li> The girls were always forgetting their flat iron, got this on a special deal one day and now it rides in our RV...happy girls now. They tell me it is a nice one and they like it.</li>
    <li> I have been lookng for a new straightner, but wasnt sure which one to buy.  Not to mention I did not want to spend a crazy amount of money.  I am very pleased with my purchase.  The sellers decription was right on, and shipping was fast...:)</li>
    <li> I love this flat iron, I have bought others for a lot more.it makes your hair look like silk. How ever don&#x27;t flat iron your hair wet unless you have to, this flat iron is hands down....the flat iron that will damage you hair the least.</li>
    <li> I was very impressed by the reviews that I read about this product.  Unfortunately it does not work that well for me.  It takes multiple passes for a small section of hair to dry and be straightened.  So my choice was blowing my hair dry and then using a flat iron or continue using the Mane Tamer.  I continued to use the Mane Tamer and now my hair is dry and brittle. It feels like straw and my hair is several different lengths.  I expect that it will take close to a year to grown my hair back!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 1 week later:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is now 2 inches long all over.  My hair was a few inches below my neck and it was very healthy.  I have always taken care of my hair.  I am not very happy right now&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And it does not have dual voltage as the description states.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very Disappointed!!!</li>
    <li> I ordered this iron in October of 2012, it is no longer working just 4 months later.  It was a decent straightener while it lasted, but I would not get this product again. It does not last.</li>
    <li> My hair stylist recommended that I replace my cheap flat iron with this one and it&#x27;s made a huge difference. I have very long, thick african-american hair. My hair comes out straight, smooth and silky and I haven&#x27;t had any heat damage. Great product.</li>
    <li> My daughter loves this flat iron and said it&#x27;s the best one she has ever had.&lt;br /&gt;The shipping was not speedy but not terrible either.&lt;br /&gt;Overall the product and purchase are excellent.</li>
    <li> I have curly/wavy hair that is very thick and long, so straightening it is a long process. I had a 1 in. chi straightener (the red holiday edition one which I hear isn&#x27;t as good as the original) and it took a long time to straighten and never came out as good as I wanted, especially the ends.  My friend had the T3 micro and recommended it so I bought this one. I&#x27;ve had this straightener for about a month now and it has been phenomenal! It heats up quickly, only requires a couple pass-throughs for each section of hair and the ends fall smoothly together. I also love the 1.75 inch, especially for long hair.  Great product and worth every penny!</li>
    <li> For a while I was trying to figure out how I&#x27;d get my blow dryer overseas to work without shorting out, and then do the same with my straightener at the time, but with this, I can skip that step! I really love that about this straightener. The only reason I don&#x27;t give it 5 stars is because the &amp;#34;SinglePass&amp;#34; technology doesn&#x27;t apply to my hair - and my hair is not that coarse or curly. I have to pass over my hair a couple of times for it to be satisfactorily straight, but that&#x27;s fine, I&#x27;m used to having to do that. I would definitely recommend to anyone!  EDIT 11/1/15: This no longer heats up. I&#x27;d expect a styling product to last more than two years. :( I have a simple conair blow dryer that I bought from Walmart that&#x27;s over five years old. I can see why this is no longer for sale.</li>
    <li> I was very happy when i recieved my flat iron however, that happiness soon turned into pure anger. I only had it for three weeks and then it broke. I followed all of the care and use instructions, but now my flat iron will not heat up. I contacted the manufacturer and i was informed that ebeauty is not an authorized dealer for my t3 flat iron. Because of this, the manufacturer will not honor the warranty. They did offer me a replacement for $49.95. I paid ebeauty $129.95 for the flat iron. I am a single mother of two and I do realize that $49.95 may not be considered a lot of money for some people, but for me it is. I feel that amazon or ebeauty should pay for my replacement.</li>
    <li> Great product! Didn&#x27;t believe it would really work as well as others claimed. I was pleasantly surprised. Would definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> This product far exceeded my expectations. Great product at a great price.  I have thick long hair and did my hair in about 35 minutes.  Anyone who is thinking about this just go out and get it.  You won&#x27;t be disappointed,</li>
    <li> I love this Iron, it truly is a &amp;#34;one sweep&amp;#34; flat iron.  I also have a T3 blow dryer so I know their products are very very good.</li>
    <li> Constantly powers off. It will heat then as soon as I flat iron my hair, it powers off automatically. I need to constantly power it back on and wait for it to get hot.</li>
    <li> I am an A.American woman with curly (3c textured) hair and I saw a review of this flat iron on Youtube. It took me a while to decide if I really wanted to order this flatiron being I already have one (one that was mighty expensive). But after months, and a few inches of hair growth I decided to give this a try (my other flat iron was only 1&amp;#34;) because I needed a bigger flatiron. This flatiron heats up pretty quick and i would pass this over my hair maybe once or twice to get the desired effect. Once my hair was done, it was soft, silky, and very shiny! This flat iron definitely gets the job done and I couldn&#x27;t be happier with this purchase.</li>
