      <li>I have thin/fine hair and was hoping this would work as I&#x27;ve tried TONS of volumizing shampoos only to find they leave my hair feeling super dry and strawy.  </li>
      <li>What i don&#x27;t like about some volume shampoos is they make my hair feel like i just put conditioner on it, way too soft, but this shampoo make my hair feel rough, like it has texture, which is exactly what i want, body and texture.</li>
      <li>is a well known American brand producing high quality hair products for well over 40 years.</li>
      <li>I keep a short layered cut so that i can promote as much body and volume as possible.  </li>

<li> I like the Extreme and All Soft conditioners from Redken, and the Iron Shape flat iron spray, but the shampoos I&#x27;ve tried (this one, Hair Cleansing Cream, and Extreme) irritate my scalp.</li>
<li> i just wet my hair enough to style it</li>

<li> i just blow it dry with a diffuser, this adds volume.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve also found that it&#x27;s harder to style.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
<li> This shampoo leaves my hair fluffy for days after washing, whilst others seem to make my hair go flat on the head after 1 day.</li>
<li> plus point,is that very little goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;Redken</li>
<li> My hair stylist told me about this, she uses it too, she also has super thin hair (not fine hair, THIN hair, where you can see the scalp, she also suffer from thyroid issues</li>
<li> A little pricey</li>
<li> If your hair is dry and thin, this is probably not the shampoo for you.</li>
<li> no more floppy hair.</li>
<li> Just an ordinary shampoo.</li>
<li> Not great...</li>
<li> I have used it now for quite some time and never get tired of it.</li>
<li> unfortunately it made my hair feel worse</li>
<li> While the shampoo does make my hair feel fuller, it also feels dirty.  </li>

    <li> I have been using this product for years. It goes on easily and lathers wonderfully. Leaves your hair full and luxurious. Works great on thick hair---makes it more manageable.</li>
    <li> I thought this was an HG product, but after a week or two my scalp starting drying out, itching, and flaking. I like the Extreme and All Soft conditioners from Redken, and the Iron Shape flat iron spray, but the shampoos I&#x27;ve tried (this one, Hair Cleansing Cream, and Extreme) irritate my scalp.</li>
    <li> definitely did not have the salon grade results i expected - hair tangled easily and had to be washed every day</li>

    <li> I have used this for years. I have very fine hair, and I feel that it helps give it body. I also use two other products from this line (for fine hair).</li>
    <li> I am always trying different volumizing hair products and after trying this shampoo I am now a Redken fan. I use it with the Redken bofy full amplifying spray and my hair has so much more volume! This shampoo gives my hair new life. I go 2-3 days between washes and even after sleeping on it and re-styling my hair still has body. I definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> This shampoo offers the best volume I have ever gotten from just a shampoo.  Even when I don&#x27;t use a volumizing product or blow dry this shampoo still gives me great lift! I have a lot of fine hair and I prefer for my hair to feel really clean after I shower.</li>

I like to buy this on amazon as it is cheaper than buying it in the salon.

    <li> i have fine frizzy hair and this really plumps up the body in my hair and it lasts and lasts.  no more floppy hair.</li>
    <li> Just the product I have been looking for, will order more.</li>
    <li> While the shampoo does make my hair feel fuller, it also feels dirty.  I&#x27;ve also found that it&#x27;s harder to style.&lt;br /&gt;I give 3 stars because it does give volume.</li>
    <li> Since I can&#x27;t get Redken products at the grocery store or drug store, it is so convenient just to order them through amazon.  They come wrapped in plastic wrap so ther is no leakagemin the package.  The shampoo itself works beautifully on my baby fine hair giving it a lovely sheen and fuller body.</li>
    <li> Really good shampoo; pretty easy on your hair.</li>
    <li> Good shampoo, but a little pricey.</li>
    <li> I bought Redken Body Full Shampoo and it was wonderful. The first time I used it I noticed a difference in the volumne in my hair. I have used it now for quite some time and never get tired of it. occasionally I will mix it with another shampoo, but nothing matches it&#x27;s ability to clean my hair without stripping, and also give it body. Fabulous.</li>
    <li> Gives great volume n healthy shine to th hair.. And makes them easy to style.. Liked th subtle fragrance too..</li>
    <li> This shampoo is ok, but its not what I expected. I didnt see a difference in the volume of my hair. It does have a nice scent tho.</li>
    <li> Good I love this shampoo.,</li>
    <li> Not great...I have thin/fine hair and was hoping this would work as I&#x27;ve tried TONS of volumizing shampoos only to find they leave my hair feeling super dry and strawy.  After reading reviews on Amazon, I thought this product would be better....unfortunately it made my hair feel worse and I noticed more hair falling out after washing.  I would not purchase this again.</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo and the way it smells and makes my hair feel. Much better luck with styling my thin, fine hair after using these products!</li>
