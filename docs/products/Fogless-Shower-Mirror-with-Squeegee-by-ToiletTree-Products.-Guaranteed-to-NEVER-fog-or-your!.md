<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> although it works you have to dump and reattach- not worth it</li>
    <li> Great little mirror.  I bought this cheaper one to see if i would consider the larger mirror.  Im very impressed considering what i paid.  Only one small complaint.  I cant drain the hot water behind the mirror without taking it off the wall. It would be nice (and get some more mileage out of the suction cups) to have a drainage plug on the mirror.  But that&#x27;s not enough of an issue to dock it a star.  Good product guys.</li>
    <li> Works very well and does not fog up.   Fill the tank located on the top with hot shower water and there is no fogging. The best shower mirror I have used.</li>
    <li> The ToiletTree Products travel fogless shower mirror is a must buy for any guy that shaves in the shower.  I shave every morning and absolutely hate shaving outside of the shower.. I always end up cutting myself or my skin gets irritated.  Majority of the times that I shave outside of the shower nowadays is when I&#x27;m traveling so this product solved my problem.  I&#x27;ve been using the regular size ToiletTree fogless mirror for about 2-3 years now and I can&#x27;t even imagine shaving without it.  It makes everything easier and it really DOES NOT fog.  It&#x27;s so much better than holding a mirror.  Now the travel size version is a great addition.  This is honestly a great gift for the holidays for any father, son, grandfather, brother, uncle, cousin, etc....</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t fog up, but a bit small.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a mirror. It&#x27;s fogless. It&#x27;s great!</li>
    <li> It is just hard to find a good fogless mirror.  However, this fogless mirror is as good as they get.  Mine falls alot from a tiled wall and has cracked but it still works.  Also, nice to take on trips.</li>
    <li> Stays clear and the squeegee will make it last due to no water spots.</li>
    <li> It says it&#x27;s fogless but over time, it&#x27;ll fog in a hot shower. Not a big deal since the squeegee it comes with works very well. It&#x27;s been weeks and the suction cups on the back haven&#x27;t failed to stick onto the walls even after I moved and mess with it a couple times.</li>
    <li> This mirror would be better if it was like the larger foggless mounted mirror from the same company in that the mirror would slide out of a wall mount to be filled with hot water. The suction cups on the back of this mirror make it difficult to remove and replace easily. A better design would be a wall mount with suction cups and a mirror that slides in and out of that mount.</li>
    <li> This mirror is great. I bought it to use mainly for traveling and at school.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have only one minor problem with it.  It uses two suction cups in the back to hold in on the shower wall, which you have to unstick to fill and empty the mirror (if you don&#x27;t have a shower head on a hose). This can be a little annoying when the suction cups don&#x27;t want to unstick, and you have to be careful to to twist the back of the mirror too much since it is a thin plastic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, if the back of the mirror holds up over extended use it will be the perfect ravel mirror. It is large enough to see everything that you need to, and stays perfectly fog free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Apart from the back of the mirror feeling a bit cheap, I really like this product.</li>
    <li> It was just what I needed. It worked better than I expected.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband and it has revolutionized his shaving experience.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay, but not fogless</li>
    <li> This thing is awesome. I have had others but this one has been the best.</li>
    <li> Not really fogless. I can never see anything when I attempt to use it in the shower.</li>
    <li> Fogged up within 2 mins. Very disappointed with this one. It&#x27;s unusable it foggs so bad.</li>
    <li> The suction cups are very stable, and the mirror is a good size. However the mirror is not fogless or fog free. My husband uses this daily, but he basically has to use the squeegee to wipe the steam and then shave three strokes as quickly as possible and repeat the process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have not contacted the company back to let them know that the mirror wasn&#x27;t fogless so I can&#x27;t comment on their return or refund policy.</li>
    <li> Really like this fogless mirror. I travel a lot and use a straight razor for shaving. There is a night and day difference from shaving in the shower or at the bathroom sink. This mirror allows me to travel and have a true fog free mirror during my shave. Because you fill this with hot water it is truly fog free each time you shave. It doesn&#x27;t get that faded look or distorted look of some other fog free mirrors. Easy to put on the shower wall and easy to take off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only knock would be on the &amp;#34;wimpy&amp;#34; squeegee that comes with it. Their bigger version has a more robust one and sometimes this one almost feels useless. You use the squeegee to clear off the water droplets after filling it with water or if water splashes on this during the shower.</li>
    <li> You may correctly ascertain from the title that I am one of those people who hates shaving while not in the shower.  Even though I use the [[ASIN:B0062IWQVU Gillette Fusion Proglide 3-In-1 Styler Special Pack]] which is a BEAST when it comes to a clean, close shave (as well as trimmed side burns, goatee, etc. - I find I get a few additional nicks or razor burn areas when shaving by the sink.)&lt;br /&gt;As such - I rarely look my best while travelling (to the point I&#x27;ve often wondered why hotel chains don&#x27;t \\&quot;hard-pipe\\&quot; something like this contraption into the shower wall - just siphon off a bit of the water and have it flow through a mirror surface in there and make us all happy).  As they haven&#x27;t done so to date, I&#x27;ve purchased this travel shower mirror...&lt;br /&gt;Quick tips - first and foremost - you don&#x27;t have to remove it from the wall each day to fill it - if you use a gel can with a cap, that cap can be very useful for filling enough hot water into the reservoir that the fog disappears... also, the squeegee is a nice touch - cleans the mirror nicely after fill up...&lt;br /&gt;Anyway - I&#x27;m thrilled with the brand.  I used to buy other \\&quot;non-fog\\&quot; brands without the tank and wind up replacing them about once a year.  These are amazing, as you can see in other reviews I&#x27;ve written... So, bottom line, just go ahead and buy it - your face will thank you!</li>
    <li> Have been looking for a mirror that is fogless and portable, and this serves that purpose well without looking like a funhouse mirror. Shaving with it has been a joy so far and it&#x27;s nice being able to put all my shaving supplies in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Back after six months of regular use, and couldn&#x27;t be happier with this product. Recommended to a few other people I know who travel a lot and one mentioned the handful of 1 star reviews. I can confirm for you that all the one star reviews for this product must be from imbeciles that can&#x27;t read the product description that clearly states the small size, suction cup mounting, or the fact that you have to fill it with warm water each time. If you want something permanent or larger, ToiletTree makes a larger, permanently mounted mirror that may be more to your preference. In the meantime, their inability to read shouldn&#x27;t impair your decision to try this product. I can confirm the other reviews that state the company emails you to ask if there have been any issues or concerns. You can&#x27;t lose. Give it a try.</li>
    <li> Fill it with warm water, and it does great. No more holding it under the shower head every few minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had a few different mirrors over the years and dried water spots can add up to make it hard to see. The built-in squeegee corrects this problem, just squeegee when done.</li>
    <li> Decent design but it has a propensity to fall off the wall if you don&#x27;t re-seat it daily.</li>
    <li> Great mirror for those who shave in the shower.  You add hot water to the canister, and it keeps it fog free for quite a while.  My only complaint is that the little squeegee it comes with does not seem to hold on very well, and its always falling.  No big deal though.</li>
    <li> Nearly perfect.  This is absolutely fog-free.  I&#x27;ve seen some confusion on this in other reviews.  If you fill the chamber directly behind the mirror with hot shower water then it literally can not fog.  It works perfect everytime with absolutely zero fog.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You do not have to take the mirror off everytime to fill it up.  I fill a cup up with hot shower water and dump behind the mirror.  The warm water displaces the cold water.  No need to dump the water out after the shower, just pour more hot water in the next day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only issue I have had is with the suction cups.  The mirror fell off the wall the first two days after I got it.  I really pushed them down and it has not fallen down since.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the best shower mirror I have ever used.</li>
    <li> Had no idea that each time u have to add water to make it foggless.  Pain in the butt plus no place to put your razor</li>
    <li> I had installed the deluxe version at home and my first shave on the road I knew something was missing. This answers the bell. So convenient and portable but does the job perfectly. This will be in my travel bag forever. The creator must have been Italian as the product is the perfect marriage of form and function. Michelangelo and Leonardo would have been proud - and clean shaven! Che Bella !&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I want to order every one of ToiletTreeProducts !</li>
    <li> They got it right. The reservoir behind the merrier, when filled with hot water keeps the fog off the face, just as the description says it will. Some reviewers have commented on the plastic construction, but I don&#x27;t see that as a problem. Bottom line, it works. I would definitely buy it again.</li>
    <li> Impressive!  I had always heard that shaving while in the shower was better and smoother due to the softening of the beard and I&#x27;d always hesitated to buy one of these to test that.  Well, now that I have, I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll ever go back to the old routine.  All you need to know is there was steam everywhere except on this mirror.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint would be for a more permanent solution for those who want to keep it in one place.  In order to keep this working, the instructions indicate you have to fill the back with warm water each time...which means taking it off, emptying and then refilling.  Not a big deal, but enough for me to hit it one star.</li>
    <li> Best way to shave on the road or at home. No need for a squeegee but it does need a tiny hole in the water reservoir to drain it automatically. Use a hot needle or 1/16&amp;#34; drill.</li>
    <li> I have bought several fogless mirrors over the years. This one works better than any I have ever bought. Plus, the squeegee helps keep it clean. Great item!</li>
    <li> Received his last week.  Haven&#x27;t used It yet but so far everything that was described is correct.</li>
    <li> Very easy to use. The suction cups are very strong. The squeegee blade does not work very well. It removes the water but leaves streaks. You have to fill the back of the mirror with hot water to keep it from fogging up. It comes with a nice travel bag.</li>
    <li> It stays well in the shower and doesn&#x27;t steam up. It arrived before the due date. It is worth the money.</li>
    <li> This mirror was smaller than I initially expected but it will fit in a suitcase easily.  The overall quality is a bit on the cheap side but it will be better than not having a shower mirror when I travel.  I purchased the large version of this mirror from Hammacher for $50 and it was also cheaply made.  Hammacher offers a lifetime warranty so if it ever breaks (falls off shower wall), I can get it replaced free of charge.  If the larger mirror did not have a lifetime warranty, I wouldn&#x27;t pay more than $20 for it.</li>
    <li> We installed this in our shower as instructed and it still fogged up! Also, the top of the mirror has an opening so water gets trapped and mold grows...</li>
    <li> poor quality started leaking right away. suction cups are not very firm either. Despite that it is still useable</li>
    <li> My husband loves it. It stays attached and doesn&#x27;t fog up. Exactly what he wanted.</li>
    <li> This is a great product that actually works. I purchased it for my roommate for Christmas and he really likes it. I recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> Bought this to replace an old Sharper Image (remember them?) piece that was falling apart. This is1/2 the price that was and works much better. A ver ysimple concept that is effective. I have used it now for a couple months with no issues. It is smallish but adequate and I expect care of the mirror surface is important over time (no windex, etc).</li>
    <li> This is a very small regular mirror that is nothing different from any other -Does fog like any other regular mirror unless you add hot water each and every time you take a shower-Not impressed with this product.&lt;br /&gt;...................Save your money .............</li>
    <li> I have no clue how this product is the best seller on Amazon. The mirror fogged up on the first use, and continues to do so. Additionally, the suction cups don&#x27;t hold, and it falls almost every day. I would not spend even a penny on this product. You will be disappointed since it fogs!</li>
    <li> It a cheap way to have a mirror on the shower.  It&#x27;s not fancy by no means, but is exactly as advertised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Brian .</li>
    <li> product arrived and looked to be previously opened.  was missing the small mirror cleaner on bottom.  mirror is functionally fine - not happy with m ToiletTree Products.</li>
    <li> I use this every day, not just for camping. It has held up perfectly and will not steam up. This is a high quality mirror that you will like.</li>
    <li> Would be nice if it had drain holes at the bottom so I don&#x27;t have to dump the cold water out the next day.  I&#x27;ll drill some in.  Update 2 years later: replacing this with another more expensive one.  This thing fogs up all the time now and it barely usable.  Maybe it&#x27;s mineral build up on the surface, but my previous mirror worked for much longer.</li>
    <li> The mirror fogs swiftly. Even when wiped and cleaned it fogs again quickly. The suction cups are whimsical about staying</li>
    <li> At first, I was disappointed but then stepped back and now am happy.  Shortly:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mirror is smaller than imagined but it is a travel mirror.  I would ask the company to look at raising the price 10% and expanding the width by 1 inch.  Weight is good especially for airport travel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mirror is plastic which threw me at first after owning a $35-40 home shaving mirror but then looked at the fact that it is advertised as a travel mirror and the price was very low - no problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The big suggestion for the company is to put a bright sticker on the protective mirror coating (the one that the customer peels off on first use) with the sticker giving a short instruction of use:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**Fill mirror reservoir with hot water right before shaving to keep mirror from fogging&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It seems obvious and is probably written elsewhere but some of the reviews mention the mirror \\&quot;not\\&quot; being fog free and maybe they didn&#x27;t fill the reservoir or like me, didn&#x27;t use hot enough water at first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Small detail which may save some customer aggravation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall - a light, small travel mirror for a cheap price.  Want more?  Spend more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Additional review after many months:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mirror surface over time spots up so much that shaving is like looking at a reflection in a tin can.  Cleaning it with glass cleaner takes some scrubbing instead of an easy wipe and doesn&#x27;t last long.  Spots up too quickly.  I owned a different albeit more expensive mirror in the past and would rather pay the money for a mirror that doesn&#x27;t need this much work and is ready without all of the extra scrub work.  My advice after many months, skip ToiletTree and buy a better quality mirror.  Amazon has plenty for less than $20.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for the last month while traveling around the country, and it&#x27;s held up pretty well. I used this while staying at campsites, random friend&#x27;s houses, and hotels. After 30 straight days of mostly different wall types it never fell once, and always stayed fog free.  I made sure not to fill it until I was ready to shave, and then dumped it when I was done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only sad this is the plastic housing cracked on one of the corners, but I blame that on me packing and unpacking everything daily.  Really great travel mirror.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll keep this short an sweet. Quite simply the best fogless mirror I have ever purchased. I&#x27;ve tried many, and the fogless \\&quot;effect\\&quot; always seems to work only moderately well, plus the surface of the mirror always has that strange film on it that distorts your face.&lt;br /&gt;This product is ingeniously simple. You fill a reservoir behind the mirror with hot shower water. The hot water comes in contact with the back of the mirror, which GUARANTEES it won&#x27;t fog on you. This is physics, people. So the mirror doesn&#x27;t need that weird film, it&#x27;s just a regular mirror, which means it&#x27;s crystal clear and doesn&#x27;t distort the image of your face. It even comes with a small squeegee to clear off any water droplets.&lt;br /&gt;This is one of those rare products that&#x27;s both cheap and superior to the competition. Look no further, this is the one to get.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had several travel mirrors and this is hand&#x27;s down the best.  It really does work.&lt;br /&gt;AND, the customer service is exceptional.  I lost one of the suction cups, called them to see how much it would cost to replaced it, they asked for my address and in less than a week I received one in the mail at NO CHARGE.  Amazing.&lt;br /&gt;Unless I lose this mirror I won&#x27;t have to buy another one for a long time, but I will purchase other products from them.</li>
    <li> True it&#x27;s fog free.  But I wish it had a closer view.</li>
    <li> Because my husband travels often for business, I knew he would get lots of use from this product. He enjoys shaving in the shower because it gives him a closer shave. At home, he has the larger version of this product, but it isn&#x27;t quite as portable as this travel size. This mirror is small enough to occupy minimal space in your carry on or weekend bag and works just as advertised; you fill the chamber with water and say goodbye to fog. I highly recommend this product for anyone who needs a travel shaving mirror.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my friend, Sam for his birthday. This is a travel size and he has the bigger one in his shower and now he can take the smaller one when they go to there condo in the winter. He loves it!</li>
    <li> Fantastic concept which works perfectly. I own the home version but always wished for a small travel one. Very light, no issue packing it. Suction cups hold it to the wall and it doesn&#x27;t fall - as long as the surface is flat. If its a very rough surface tile, it doesn&#x27;t adhere. That happens very rarely, so just make sure you don&#x27;t put it on grout lines. Really a well designed, well executed product. By the way, the company is fantastic. I had a small issue with the home version, due to hard water spotting. They told me how to fix it easily, and sent me a new one anyway. Great people ADDITIONAL COMMENTS - I just purchased my third travel mirror. First I busted in my suitcase, the 2nd I left in a hotel. As you see by my third purchase, I NEVER want to travel without this mirror, even if I have to buy 10 of them!!. It&#x27;s fantastic, works exactly as exepcted. Good news is that they are priced VERY reasonably, so when you need to buy another, its just not a problem.</li>
    <li> This product is excellent. Large enough to see detail in your face, small enough to travel with everywhere. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, this is a TRUE FOGLESS MIRROR. Don&#x27;t buy anything that doesn&#x27;t allow you to fill it with water, because it will fog up. This one never does.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t fog at all if you follow the directions and put hot water in the space behind the mirror. The company was very responsive when I had a question as well. Great product for a great price!</li>
    <li> Great Product!  Would purchase it again the size was not too small that was something I was worried about just perfect</li>
    <li> This mirror fogged up the first time I used it and continues to fog up everytime I try to use it.  Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> Ok product, have not used it much. But it does what it advertises it will do. That is all one can ask.</li>
    <li> Seems to fog up right away unlike other mirrors that I&#x27;ve had that didn&#x27;t fog up until there was some buildup. Squeegee works okay too.</li>
    <li> product arrived within the specified time frame and was exactly as advertised</li>
    <li> I used the shower mirror for the first time yesterday and I&#x27;m pleased to say that it worked as stated in the Amazon listing.  I was surprised by how they keep it from fogging up - you just fill the reservoir behind the mirror with hot water and that keeps it from fogging up and works easily and effectively.  I can recommend this item without reservation unless you need a larger mirror - but if you intend to use it for travel, the somewhat small size is an asset.</li>
    <li> The mirror has been hanging in my shower for 10 days. The suction cups works perfect. Moreover, every time I have to turn the mirror upside down to pour water out, the suction cups do the job! Those ones could slide when you pull them, but don&#x27;t fall of! The mirror is really fogless! So now I take my shower in company with a nice person every time! ;)</li>
    <li> It actually works and  stays on shower wall.  Doesn&#x27;t cloud up.  Easy to pack and take away within us on vacation</li>
    <li> Excellent product for an excellent price. I have been looking for this for a while and you don&#x27;t see this type of product in regular stores.</li>
    <li> It wasn&#x27;t shown in description that you had to fill reservoir and mirror appeared larger than it is</li>
    <li> works as described no fog and the little squeegee is handy to wipe off after use.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried three different fogless shower mirrors so far. They were all random mirrors I picked up in local stores. Most of them work for a week or so then start to get dirty or water stains. You fill the resevoir with warm or hot water and then stick it on the shower wall. Mine has worked great for months. All I do is dump the resevoir and give it a shake after my shower...so far it doesn&#x27;t even have water stains. I haven&#x27;t had to clean it either....which is a good thing because some of these fogless mirrors get ruined if you use the wrong product to clean them with.</li>
    <li> Good size for home and travel - highly recommended. Looks like this will last the test of time - don&#x27;t leave him without it.</li>
    <li> I was excited about this purchase but it was a huge let down.  It fogged up the first time I used it in the shower.</li>
    <li> A bit let down at the small size, but it does stay fog free.  Suction cups work&lt;br /&gt;even in the hottest shower.</li>
    <li> This is surely not a fogless mirror, but it&#x27;s advertised as a fogless mirror, It isn&#x27;t difficult to make a fogless mirror.</li>
    <li> Good shower mirror for on the go and or home. I&#x27;ve used it once already and no complaints. Stays mounted on your shower wall no problem with slipping yet.</li>
    <li> This mirror works great.  I have it hanging in my shower - all I have to do if fill it up with a little warm water and it works perfectly.  It also came with a small travel bag and it&#x27;s very lightweight, so it&#x27;s perfect for business trips/vacations.  For the price, you really can&#x27;t beat it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this mirror for about a month now, and I still love it. It actually stays on the wall. I&#x27;ve never had anything with suction cups stay so well. You have to make sure to get the suction cups wet first, but after that it will not fall down. It&#x27;s the perfect travel size while still being big enough to be useful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(I received a Fogless Shower Mirror with Squeegee for the purposes of a review. I was not given any monetary compensation. All opinions are my own.)</li>
    <li> This travel size shower mirror is just the right size to hang in your shower, the section cups do a great job holding up the mirror. It comes with a carrying case for easy storage so if you are a person on the go it can travel with you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s easy to setup all you do is fill the inside bucket with hot water, as this makes the mirror not fog over, then when your done you have a squeegee to keep the mirror clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Makes a great stocking stuffer!</li>
    <li> What can I say other than it works!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve had this about a month now and its great.  Every morning I&#x27;ll take it off the wall, dump the old water out of the back pocket and fill it up again.  It has yet to fog doing this.  The suction cups work great too.  I have one of those plastic shower wall liners and it hasn&#x27;t come off yet.  The mirror itself is nice, very clear and somewhat magnified I think.  There&#x27;s not any distortion like other cheap mirrors.  I&#x27;d have to say my favorite thing about this mirror is what I overlooked when searching for something to shave in the shower with, the squeegee.  It&#x27;s truly been invaluable.</li>
    <li> This is the travel mirror, and I love it. It performs exactly as promised, and is large enough to show my whole face while shaving. Once filled with hot water, it stays clear for my entire shave. A plus is the soft cloth travel bag to protect the mirror&#x27;s surface. The included squeegee removes water drops quickly and easily. This is easily the best travel shaving mirror I have ever had.</li>
    <li> Wouldn&#x27;t stick to the shower wall and got pretty foggy.  Can&#x27;t tell you how many times this fell down in the shower.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with this product.  It has performed as advertised and I feel I will have many years of use from it.</li>
    <li> This mirror is tiny - around the same dimensions as a CD case. I wasn&#x27;t buying it to travel so that was a little surprising. Also requires you to fill the mirror with water for each use (when temperatures match, fog disappears), has a very tiny but helpful squeegee in the bottom. Suction cups are pretty strong, which is good except for when you want to fill the thing with water, then you have to wrestle it off the wall.</li>
    <li> I shave in the shower. When I started going for a more intricate beard design, it required a mirror. This one does the trick well. I just fill the well with hot water, which is what keeps it from fogging up (fog is just tiny droplets of water condensing on a cold glass or metal surface). Mine is slightly warped, making my face look skinnier than it is, but that&#x27;s actually handy for close-in shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You&#x27;ll want to take advantage of the little squeegee that you slide out of the bottom (shown in the main image). The mirror won&#x27;t fog up, but it will have water on it when you start. A couple of swipes of the squeegee and it&#x27;s clear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The suction cups work reasonably well with the tiles in my shower. Although you can store it that way, I would strongly recommend emptying the water out and storing it upside-down so it dries and airs out quickly so you don&#x27;t grow mold inside it. I put mine on a small plastic shower rack that airs well.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for something that did not leave a permanant attachment in my shower, but was not thinking about a mirror that would travel.  With low expectations, I ordered this mirror.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received it and tested it out pretty quickly.  You fill up the reservoir with warm water from the shower, use the included (attached) squeegee to wipe the water off the mirror, and then suction cup it to the wall, tile, or glass of your shower.  I did this right when I got in the shower, and did not turn around to shave until the end of my shower.  Surprisingly, the mirror was fog-free and clear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have since also used this mirror for traveling.  It is very lightweight, and does not take up much room in a suitcase (look at the dimensions - it is not a large mirror).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this for a travel mirror or for a general home-use mirror for shaving in the shower.</li>
    <li> I had the full sized one and loved it.  We bought a new home.  I was going to buy a new full sized one for my new bathroom.  Decided to try the travel size.  I was scared it would be too small, especially after being used to the full sized one.  It&#x27;s not too small.  My wife likes that it doesn&#x27;t have to be on the wall all the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you don&#x27;t want to permanently mount your shave mirror and want to be able to take it on the read with you, then buy this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you would rather have it mounted to the wall in your shower, then buy the full size ToiletTree one.</li>
    <li> Disappointed.....suction cups don&#x27;t hold.  Mirror dropped and cover broke.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only lasted a week</li>
    <li> Have tried many &amp;#34;no fog&amp;#34; shower mirrors for shaving. They have never worked for me. This one is different. It involves minimal installation, works simply and easily, and is low tech. Even the squeegee works well if you drip water on the mirror face. Only minor flaw is when only half awake, sliding the hot water filled mirror back onto it&#x27;s track takes a couple of tries. Not a big deal.</li>
    <li> I was somewhat skeptical but in reading another review of a different brand this one was reviewed highly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found that it works just fine and is a bargain at the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would buy another.</li>
    <li> I have the larger version in my home shower and it works great. The travel size is just right for on the road, and works just as well as the home version. I&#x27;ve had other shower mirrors in the past and there is no comparison, these Toilet Tree mirrors are the best.</li>
    <li> Add water like the directions say to and within a minute the fog was gone. This mirror does what they say it does.&lt;br /&gt; Size may be small, remember it&#x27;s not a vanity mirror.</li>
    <li> The mirror keeps falling, and when I am showing either at night or in the morning it makes a huge thump sound.. But I love the price, you get what you pay for .. I will try to figure something out with the suction cup.</li>
    <li> Works as advertised and suction cups hold very well.</li>
    <li> for years i tried different mirrors; this is the answer!  i keep a small plastic cup in the shower; and use it to fill the mirror with warm water each morning.  I leave the mirror up 24/7; i let the warm water force out the water that&#x27;s in there from the last use/shower.  the mirror has stayed up for 2 weeks without falling; so the suction cups have done their job too.  I plan to buy a second one now; i don&#x27;t ever want to be without this true fogless mirror.  Note: its only fog-less if you pour warm water into the chamber opening behind the mirror; otherwise it will fog-up on you.  The mirror still has a thin profile; even with the water chamber.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my husband and he loves it.  It does not fog up just as advertised.  We would buy it again.</li>
    <li> I got this because it seemed like a sound principal for a fog free mirror.  And it is.  However, whoever designed it didn&#x27;t think through everything.  You fill up the chamber behind the mirror with warm/hot water which helps regulate the mirror to the same temperature as your shower.  It sticks to the wall with suction cups.  The only way to empty and fill the chamber is to completely remove the mirror from the wall, dump out the old water, and refill it.  Now, right now this is fine, a few more steps than should be needed but no big deal.  But I know that those suction cups will fail shortly due to the constant on/off.  When they do I will not be purchasing this again.  All they had to do is provide a small drainage valve and a small removable fill cup.  They provide a squeegee, why couldn&#x27;t they provide that?</li>
    <li> I like this little thing. I bought it so I could shave in my dorm shower, instead of standing at the sink in the public bathroom of my floor. It definitely gets the job done. The mirror is very nice and crisp, and it doesn&#x27;t fog up when used properly. Added bonus - it gives me a place to hang my glasses while I wash my hair!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downsides I&#x27;ve found are occasional issues with the suction cups. First, they can be difficult to remove from the wall. I typically pull out with one hand and pinch with the other, but I&#x27;m worried that this will eventually cause them to deform and fail.&lt;br /&gt;Second, occasionally, one will not suction well. The mirror will start to tilt forward as the other cup holds strong for a few minutes, so when I notice this, I just press it back against the wall and everything is good. But I&#x27;m sure one day, both will fail and I&#x27;ll get to see how well the mirror deals with bouncing across the tile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nonetheless, still a very good mirror and product.</li>
    <li> We&#x27;ve had this shower mirror for almost a year now and it sill works great!  couldn&#x27;t be happier with it!</li>
    <li> A few weeks into this.  It has stayed clear and fog free to date.  My only issue is that you have to remove the suction cups, fill it up.. reattach it.. and then remove them again to pour out the water.. then reattach or put it on the shelf.  (i guess you could leave the water in for a day.. but seems more sanitary to empty it after each use)  If the suction cups were permanant and the mirror just hung on some hooks, that would make it easier to remove, seems like that would be an improvement on the current design.&lt;br /&gt;But with that said, the suction cups are holding up fine so far and the squeegee works great.  Mirror is a decent size and stays clear.  I am happy i purchased and would buy it again.</li>
    <li> Used it and works great</li>
    <li> This mirror performs quite well.  I would recommend it for the purposefor which  it is intended.  Shipping was prompt and it was securely packaged.</li>
    <li> This product does exactly what is says. I use it when I travel. Sometimes the suction cups are a little fickle depending on the surface. Remains fogless for the duration of my shaves.</li>
    <li> My husband has been using an older &amp;#34;fog-free&amp;#34; mirror since we have been together. Its never been fog free from day one. I was skeptical to even try a different one but I did it anyway. IT IS GREAT! The mirror sticks very well to our shower wall. I love the cute little squeegee it comes with. We love it and will always use this brand as long as we both shall live!</li>
    <li> Within a matter of seconds the mirror was completely fogged up. I would actually say that it was designed to fog up.</li>
    <li> The mirror works as promised.  It is fogless when hot water is added and is easy to hang.  I would recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> IT IS NOT FOGLESS, regardless of what the Amazon advertising and the Toiletttree box claimed. You would have to use the little squeegee every thirty seconds or so to keep it clear enough to shave. &amp;#34;Made in China&amp;#34; junk and Amazon (and have been a long-time customer) is slipping with their quality control and advertising.</li>
    <li> Works great. Sticks to the tub and no fogging up. Fast shipping. good packaging would highly recommend to any one needing a good shaving mirror</li>
    <li> This is what a fog-free shower mirror should be. So simple, yet Toilet Tree is the only one I have ever found that has got this right. Highly recommended!!</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t begin to tell you how good this mirror is. Actually I can,  I bought this as a time saver in the morning. The best shave is in the shower when your pores are open. I saw many different priced mirrors and this economical one. I bought it expecting it to fall off the wall the first day. It&#x27;s been on my wall for a week now. I would recommend to anyone looking for a fogless mirror.</li>
    <li> This is great no fog at all.  I made a small change instead of suction cups I used a chain and works great.  Thanks</li>
    <li> Sucks.  No two bits about it.  Fogs worse than anything I&#x27;ve ever seen.  I think it started fogging before I turned the shower on.  It&#x27;s that horrible.</li>
    <li> Very in the fact that you have to load and empty water out of a tiny reservoir to keep the mirror from fogging, which only works when the water is hot.</li>
    <li> This should be a perfect 5 star rating.  The only reason it isn&#x27;t is because some people cry about the size.  It says right in the product description how big it is.  So these people give it a bad review because they can&#x27;t read, simply as that.  The second reason people give it less stars is they keep saying that it fogs up on them.  While again if they would have read the product description or the directions that comes with the mirror, they would know to put water from your shower in the back.  Several different times I let the mirror fog up before I put the water in.  Guess what I need next. Add water like the directions say to and within a minute the fog was gone.  This mirror does what they say it does.  Im guessing its the owner of the company has got back with many different people to address problems they have with the mirror. You can&#x27;t ask for better customer service.  Thanks ToiletTree Products.  And its amazing how amazon removes comments because they don&#x27;t like what you have to say.</li>
    <li> Way smaller than picture shows. Was expecting maybe 10x10 not 5x4 and fogs first 3 seconds showers on.</li>
    <li> Bought the Fogless Shower Mirror for my husband.  He is thrilled with it.&lt;br /&gt;It works just as promised and he gets a nice, close shave in the shower.</li>
    <li> This is a small, fogless mirror.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you fill it with hot water as you shower...it will not fog. It is small because it is a travel size. It isn&#x27;t cheap but it isn&#x27;t poorly made which of course a cheap one would be. If you want a 100% fogless travel mirror...this is it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have the larger one as well and it works perfectly. The company sent a retrofit kit to fix a problem with the original mounting bracket. This company sets the standard for customer service from my experience with them.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had other fog free shaving mirrors in the past but they had a coating on them to make them work.  Eventually the coating failed.  As long as the water tank doesn&#x27;t fail this mirror should be fine since the meathod of creating a fog free mirror is based on heating the mirror.  Only criticism would be that the travel bag supplied should be water proof.  This would let you use the mirror and pack it in your suitcase without waiting for it to dry.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s true - most shower mirrors fog, but this mirror does not. It is a perfect size too. I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> This mirror fits perfectly in the company&#x27;s toiletry bag, which I also purchased. My husband uses this mirror whenever traveling and he&#x27;s been very pleased with it for over 2 years now.</li>
    <li> This mirror works perfect. It&#x27;s a small size but well enough for shaving. When fulled with hot water it&#x27;s impossible for the fog to appear. And the suction cups Works perfect as well. It was a very good purchase.</li>
    <li> Now this is the shower mirror I&#x27;ve been looking for. Using suction cups instead of an adhesive gives me the freedom to take the product anywhere I&#x27;m going. In the past, I&#x27;ve ordered the adhesive mirrors. They&#x27;re great, but as soon as you take the adhesive down, it can&#x27;t be used again. After ordering the same mirror 3 times in the past, I decided I&#x27;d switch to this brand. Also, if you have to deal with shaving the back of your neck, it&#x27;s convenient that you can take it down and use it as the second mirror. Overall, no complaints.</li>
    <li> In the shower depending on the surface of the shower like rough tile, the suctions cups do not work as designed, you spend a lot of time picking mirror off the floor of the shower. I can&#x27;t recommend for all surfaces..</li>
    <li> Works well, as its on suction cups it is easy to remove/move if needed, big enough for me so I use it at home rather than for travel, and I don&#x27;t bother to remove every time to fill up as I have a removable shower head I can just use that to fill it up on the wall.  Good product.</li>
    <li> I have has this for 2.5 years now. The suction cups still work very well. The unit has never fallen. It still works great, but there&#x27;s some soap scum on the mirror. If you don&#x27;t need to move the unit, get the bigger version. I got it at the same time, and the big one still looks like new with zero soap scum.</li>
    <li> very all purpose shaving mirror.</li>
    <li> Had this for months now and It works just as promised. Very Simple. Sticks to wall. No fog when filled with water. No complaints... best shower mirror I&#x27;ve ever owned.</li>
    <li> Small mirror but works well and never fogs. Simple to use, I found adheres well to glass but not as well to tile.  Overall pleased with purchase and would buy again.</li>
    <li> I have had the Toiletree full size fogless shower mirror for a while now in my home shower and it works great! Recently purchased this travel mirror from Toiletree and it is fabulous. It is compact and even comes with a nice travel bag to keep it from getting scratched. The suction cups work great. I use it at the gym and on the boat, and will take it with me whenever I travel. Plan to buy more as gifts for friends. Great product.</li>
    <li> Suction cups don&#x27;t stay attached to shower wall</li>
    <li> Great concept. There is an area behind the mirror that you can fill with hot water so the mirror won&#x27;t fog. This is different from other mirrors that are perhaps treated that eventually diminish. I would have given it 5 stars but I&#x27;ve notice the suction cups don&#x27;t hold the grip as well as I thought they would but it&#x27;s not a major issue, they hold out for hours but every other day I find the mirror on the floor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would buy again.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for almost two years now and have never had an issue with it fogging. I frequently travel and love the compact size. If you are rating this product at 3 stars or lower you are clearly not reading the directions. Simply FILL THE RESERVOIR WITH HOT WATER, pretty easy considering you are already in the shower. The hot water makes it impossible to fog up. Great product. Great value.</li>
    <li> Does not fog up if you follow the instructions and fill it with hot water before getting in the shower.</li>
    <li> Great looking mirror and an excellent size for the shower. My husband said that he often has to race to finish shaving before the mirror fogs up again after already wiping it off a first time. Wouldn&#x27;t call it truly fogless.</li>
    <li> This is a must. If you are looking at the picture look at the top of the frame..there&#x27;s a slot here where you fill it with hot water from the shower you are in and BAM you are off and shaving! Does not fog what so ever.</li>
    <li> It works great. Just fill it up with warm water and it will not fog up. I like the section cups used to hold it on the shower wall. I have purchased more expensive ones like this and the silicone adhesive gave out after a month. So far this has not dropped on a foot yet. The only thing I had to get use to is the size. it is a little small and my image is a tad distorted. Over all, great product for the price</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t buy this for a travel mirror, however I liked that it is the perfect size to keep in the shower.  The suction cups work great and stick to just about any surface.  However this is where the good qualities stop.  The quality is VERY poor.  When I first got the product I thought they sent an empty box!  Opened it up and thought I was going to break it.  It stayed fog free for about a week.  after 3 weeks it got cloudy and mostly unusable now!  Even if you are using this for travel, I would seriously consider paying a little more for a better product.</li>
    <li> Fog less... Makes me laugh. It comes with a tiny squeegee to remove fog  every couple of seconds</li>
    <li> This does everything is talks about. The only problem I had with it was it kept falling off the shower wall. So now I only hang it up when I use it and works great.</li>
    <li> I thought it might be too small, but it works great. My only issue is that it fell once. The suction cups are pretty standard though...so I doubt this will be a reoccurring issue.</li>
    <li> I purchased this mirror as a gift, so I&#x27;ll state off the bat that I don&#x27;t use it for shaving. From the males in the house who do use it for shaving, they love the size, it&#x27;s big enough to do the job while not getting in the way. The squeegee is nice for when there is spray back from the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like most suction cup shower accessories, it will fall at some point, however the construction is pretty sturdy so it will not break.</li>
    <li> My husband hates to stand at the sink and shave when we go on vacation.  His face stays moist from the steam in the shower and with the Fogless shower mirror this makes it perfect. I highly recommend it .</li>
    <li> I need to keep a little bowl in the shower because I need to pour in some hot water from the shower. and then.. NO FOG.. great item.</li>
    <li> This item isn&#x27;t bad and I don&#x27;t have really anything to complain about. It works like a charm.  The mirror isn&#x27;t glass but it does reflect just like a glass mirror would so no big deal. Plus I&#x27;m not to sure if you would want a glass mirror in the shower (what if is break and your in the shower and you step on the glass, right?). The reason I gave it 4 stars is bec it is really cheaply made but what can you expect the price is relatively low. I use it while im in the shower and it doesn&#x27;t fog up just as advertised. Overall I would recommend.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t know why so many people are complaining about the product when it comes with instructions on how to work the mirror and it&#x27;s incredibly fast. Great mirror, a good size, suction cups hold up nicely and it doesn&#x27;t fog when filled correctly.</li>
    <li> Everything that has been said is entirely true.  This design is so simple!  It works perfectly and even easier if you have a sprayer head shower.  I just tilt it to drain the water and then spray the new water in!  I initially bought this one because I wanted to test it before spending more on the home one and this one was perfect!  I have used it on 2 different trips and unfortunately left it in the hotel on my last trip :(  If they do not find it I will buy it again and possibly the larger one for my house as well!</li>
    <li> This mirror fogs up instantly, and you have to use the little tool to clear it. This only lasts for 10 seconds before you have to do it again. I can&#x27;t recommend this product</li>
    <li> If you add the water, it works great.  The only problem is that the suction cups don&#x27;t attach to shower tile with ridges, but that is not a problem for most of the hotels we use.  The suction cups work great in the standard hotel shower.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my boy friend and he loves it. The size is just right to use for travel or for every day use. The mirror is deffinately large enough to see your whole face in. And the big concern - it really does work! I&#x27;ve seen other fogless mirrors in the past and they just didn&#x27;t work or didn&#x27;t have a clear image. This mirror stays clear and has a regular glass like appearance so your image is not distorted. The suction cups actually suction really nicely, but if you are concerned about that picking up some weather proof command strips also work as they cups are removable : ) The squeegee is actually a really cute and nice touch - he liked that part as well. I thought it might be tacky or unusable but it wasn&#x27;t. We are both really pleased with this purchase.</li>
    <li> this product works as advertised.  I also have purchased several of the regular Fogless Mirrors for different showers.  they work as advertised, but just as importantly, the customer service from this company is superb.</li>
    <li> 1st mirror I&#x27;ve had out of many that actually does not fog up!!</li>
    <li> After purchasing a fogless mirror with that &amp;#34;nano&amp;#34; surface (and scratching it with very little effort), I gave this one a try. This one stays fog free because you have to fill it up with hot/warm water at the beginning of your shower. Not a big deal for me. Love the little squeegee as well. So far, so good! Great to be able to see myself in the shower now and shave properly! Would buy again!</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t fog at all, but mine seems to have clouded with age.</li>
    <li> This mirror is great and works well.  I think the back of the unit should be key-holed for quicker and easier removal from the suction cups to fill up the mirror with water.  I use this at home and it&#x27;s kind of a pain to remove vs sliding the mirror off via keyholes.</li>
    <li> I love it... but am about to order my third one in 2 years.  1 of the 2 suction cups failed and it falls into the tub enough times until it breaks.  I&#x27;m pretty sure I&#x27;d pay $5 more if it came with an extra set of suction cups for the convenience.  Granted, I use this all the time and not just for travel.  For travel only this thing could last forever.</li>
    <li> I am writing this after having used the mirror a few times.  Overall, I&#x27;m very happy - it has not fallen off the shower wall and it has stayed completely fog-free for my whole shower after I fill it up with hot water. It&#x27;s not a huge mirror but I can see my whole face for shaving, so for the price I can handle that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had a concern about the need to pull it off the wall two times per shower and posted a question. The President (great customer service!) replied that I could buy one of the other two models that have a different mount and sliding mirror.  While I consider that, I have figured out a workaround for now: I leave the mirror on the shower floor and when I get in I fill it up with hot water and attach to the wall. When i&#x27;m done I take it off the wall and turn it upside down so it can drain. A perfect solution would be an attachment in the middle back side of mirror where you could rotate to drain by turning upside down without taking it off the wall.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My last fogless mirror was one of the nanotech types. I tried two and after two months they each stopped working. I&#x27;ll update this review if anything changes with this mirror.</li>
    <li> Used as directed, and it does what it says. If you don&#x27;t change out the water, you will get fog on the mirror. It tells you in simple black and white to do that. It&#x27;s not that big of deal to have to change out the water every time you shower. If you&#x27;re tight on time, you most likely shouldn&#x27;t be shaving in the shower or skip altogether that morning, unless you&#x27;re in the military and work that day, then just dry shave and head to work :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t had any experience with the suction cups failing and having the mirror fall which is good because it&#x27;s a proper mirror, made from glass, not a piece of plastic like some cheaper &#x27;fogless mirrors&#x27;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the size as well. It&#x27;s just the right size for travel or permanent use.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used the mirror about 7 times, and it has been completely fog-free each time, throughout my shower and shaving.  It is easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only caveat is that the mirror is smaller than one might imagine from the picture -- the mirror is about 4 and 1/2\\&quot;  by 5\\&quot;.  Since I&#x27;m only going to use this for travel, being small and light is a plus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Being small and made of plastic, it&#x27;s worth up to the $13 that I paid on Amazon -- but not the over $20.00 that Brookstone charges.</li>
    <li> Very convenient, works great.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t usually do reviews but after first being impressed with the product, I have now also had occasion to be impressed with the customer service of the company.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all, I have bought one of the big versions for my home, one for my apartment overseas where I work, one for my grown son, one for my girlfriend to shave her legs- and now one to have with me when I travel on business and stay in a hotel room! Once you have one of these you&#x27;re just spoiled- you just don&#x27;t want to have to shave at a sink, you know?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second, just got this travel version out of the box and thought that over time, suction cups inevitably wear out or I will lose one so I might as well order some extra ones now rather that wait until that happens. I call the number on the paper in the box for the &amp;#34;Help&amp;#34; line and ask if I can order these, the guy says &amp;#34;Don&#x27;t worry about it- I&#x27;ll throw a handful in a package and send it your way no charge!&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THAT is why I wrote a review, and rated it a &amp;#34;5&amp;#34;!!</li>
    <li> Got this for my boyfriend because I was tired of him stealing my makeup mirror and leaving it in the shower when he shaved. He says he likes it, &amp;#34;it&#x27;s convenient&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> Only fogless if you take a cold shower.  Not impressed with the product.  Need a mirror that does not fog up in a hot shower</li>
    <li> Perfect size for travel or changing areas of use.  Suction holds better with this size unlike larger ones that don&#x27;t hold the suction and fall off the shower wall and break.</li>
    <li> finally a mirror that doesn&#x27;t fog</li>
    <li> Fantastic product.  I own the full size version too.  Love it!</li>
    <li> Even though I initially bought this for travel, I&#x27;ve now begun using it at home and find it is much better than the fogless mirror I was using.  I like the little squeegee and the suction cups work very well at home and on the road to hold it to the shower wall.  It works as soon as you fill the reservoir and is also crystal clear as a mirror.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: After using this mirror for many months(10) I have decided to lower my rating by one star because the suction cups have started to lose their ability to keep the mirror in place for more than a few hours.  The cups are beginning to harden over time and so air gets between them and the surface you are mounting it on (in my case glazed wall tiles - nice shiny surface, and cleaned frequently too).  I&#x27;ll be interested to see how much longer it takes to lose suction altogether.  I&#x27;ll update this again if/when it does.</li>
    <li> We travel a lot so this mirror was small enough to take with us wherever we go.  We have a small trunk so we have to cut back when we travel.  It&#x27;s also great in our travel trailer.  Small mirror for small shower but big enough to get the job done.  I recommend this product to who ever travels, college students  and who ever else needs to save on space.</li>
    <li> Works exactly as advertised and is the perfect size for travelling. I am happy with the product and recommend to any frequent traveller.</li>
    <li> Works great, just as described.  Don&#x27;t forget to fill the back with warm shower water and it will always be fog less.  Bought 2 of them, one for home one for travel.</li>
    <li> Nice and clean transaction</li>
    <li> Exactly as described and so far it is working great - no fogging!! Lightweight and the travel bag is handy too!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this item for the past month and I like the product. It does fog up but the squeegee and splashing a little water cleans up the fog. Overall I like it.&lt;br /&gt;Review Update: I was contacted by the seller explaining the mistakes I have made in making this product work for me. I am updating my review to 5 stars. It works perfectly as described. I will recommend this product. Looking forward to other quality products from this seller.</li>
    <li> needed a little travel mirror  purchased this and it does just fine for what I need. It was a good buy</li>
    <li> As a college student, I purchased this product a few months ago after reading a glowing review it was given here.&lt;br /&gt;I will have to say, it has lived up to expectations, and then gone beyond them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, the size of the mirror: It may seem small at first, since it&#x27;s meant to be a travel mirror, but for use in my shower it seems to be a perfect fit. I don&#x27;t find myself needing to move around a whole lot just to watch what I&#x27;m shaving. And, since it is not very large, it fits well in my backpack when I take it on trips, covered by a small cloth sleeve from the box.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mirror&#x27;s suction cups on the back keep it strongly attached, even when the rear reservoir is filled to the brim with hot water. It comes off of the tile only when you actually pull on it, and I have yet to experience it sliding down due to the weight of the water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also found it easiest to just leave water from one shower in the reservoir, and then pour hot water into the reservoir when it came time to use the mirror again (angling the mirror towards the wall, so that water doesn&#x27;t spill down the mirror). This forces the old water out, and then you have the mirror defogging itself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only (tiny) drawback I&#x27;ve found is that the provided squeegee, in its stored position, tends to get wet quickly and then won&#x27;t work as well at removing water from the mirror&#x27;s surface. This could just be due to how I use the mirror, though. When it&#x27;s dry, it works perfectly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely buy this product again.</li>
    <li> If only fogless mirrors stayed fogless throughout ownership.  We&#x27;ve been unable to find such a mirror in this world.  But this mirror has no metal parts whatsoever.  Many shower mirrors do you contain mental and a rust pretty quickly no matter what.  This may not be fogless but it is rustproof.  It also has a built-in squeegee that keeps it usable.  Not free from fog but you still can see your reflection a little bit and I guess that&#x27;s all we really need our else I would give it less stars.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product so my boyfriend could shave his face in the shower without worrying about cutting himself or missing spots. For my, it&#x27;s useful when I shave my underarms, and when I have a facial mask on. The product itself is a really innovative and creative idea, and setting it up is easy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The suction cups keep it in place very well (much better than other suction cup based products)!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only reason for 4 stars instead of 5 stars is because the squeegee doesn&#x27;t work well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: Would recommend if you shave in the shower or if you apply facial masks and need to see to make sure there&#x27;s even coverage.</li>
    <li> I received the Toilettree Fogless Shower Travel Mirror as a gift while on the Buddy Cruise. It is very light weight, easy to use and remained fogless during the shower. It was easy to pack as it comes with its own travel bag! I would not hesitate to purchase this mirror. Thank you Toilettree for a great product!</li>
    <li> I bought the original for home use and have had more than a year of completely fog-free showering!  I have used the travel one for a week and it is just as good as the home use one.  It is smaller than I thought based on the size of the home use mirror, but is just perfect for my huge head!  A little more than the others on Amazon, but I promise, it is well worth it if you value a no-fog shower mirror for shaving!</li>
    <li> The idiots aside who complain about &#x27;distortion&#x27; this is an ingenious little, highly useful tool that works precisely s advertised.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why on earth Sharper Image didn&#x27;t - back in the 80&#x27;s when they unleashed the shaving mirror in shower phenomenon - check the science is beyond me.  Only 25 years later, this company did the science and of course, the narrow channel inside the mirror MUST be filled with water at or near the temperature you ablute in.  Thus, no fogging.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I notice no distortion whatsoever and indeed the perception is probably caused precisely because the mirror material is a &#x27;super&#x27; optical grade of some sort that reveals details - including unpleasant ones about one&#x27;s face - that a normal mirror won&#x27;t reveal.  In a word - PERFECT little product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tips:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;. Do not leave you razor in the shower - that is if it has ultra expensive blades - disposables are fine - because the blades will rust.&lt;br /&gt;. When refilling, daily the mirror with warm water to shave, press once, twice, that&#x27;s it!  On EACH suction cup and the damn thing will never fall over.</li>
    <li> The promo says...with the hot water inside, the glass equalizes the temperature of the air, so it&#x27;s impossible for fog to form.&lt;br /&gt;Interesting theory, and I&#x27;d say there is less fog.  But there is still some.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as the suction cups, they work fine if the surface is tile.  If it&#x27;s painted (as in the case in my shower) they slip a lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So as I said, far from perfect</li>
    <li> The mirror stays fog free. The Small size is good for travel or even at home for hubby&#x27;s shaving.  Would recommend!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried many fog-free mirrors over the years, and they all worked to some degree, for a certain period of time, both of which were fairly little.  This thing is perfect - never fogs, mirror surface is clear as could be.  I just can&#x27;t believe something this simple hasn&#x27;t been done before!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s everything they say! Order the larger model because you&#x27;ll fall in love with this mini. It&#x27;s ok in this size but bigger is better!</li>
    <li> I purchased this travel mirror as well as the larger deluxe model for home use.  I have been very pleased with both.  This model uses small suction cups to attach to the shower wall, I recently used it on a week long trip and it worked as well as the home model both from a secure attachment perspective as well as being fog free.  I like that the travel model came with a small cloth bag to protect the mirror while packed.  I would have preferred that the mirror orientation be more of a landscape vs the portrait orientation but that is just a personal preference and obviously being a travel size impacts the mirror size.  I would highly recommend the product design and concept regardless of which model/size you are looking for.</li>
    <li> this is the &#x27;little brother&#x27; to the one i have mounted in my shower. it really does do the trick, NO FOG! really great and a great &#x27;stocking  stuffer&#x27; too!&lt;br /&gt;i LOVE mine!</li>
    <li> I got the item, does the job, although i understand it is made for travel, having something slightly wider would be nice, all made of plastic, seems like it could break if it fell from suction cups disconnecting and filled with water....does a great job at being anti-fog when filled with water and using in steaming hot shower. Only recommendation i can make is make it feel a little more sturdy and optional lid in case it does fall, water wont go all over the place, may make it feel more sturdy as well. overall good antifog mirror for travel purposes only, otherwise buy a bigger mirror</li>
    <li> I think the headline pretty much tells it all. If you think you want to try shaving in the shower, I can&#x27;t imagine this won&#x27;t work for you. The only thing extra that you need is a mug or a bowl or a showerhead you can direct to the back of this mirror. You just run hot water into the back of the mirror and it keeps it pretty much fog-free. When you&#x27;re done, pull off one cup, tilt it to the side, and empty the water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hardly need the little squeegee on the bottom, but it works if you want to or need to use it. I suspect the squeegee will die before the mirror, but I think they&#x27;ll both last quite a while. Hard water is prone to leave water spots, but just take it off the wall (suction cups) and wash it off.</li>
    <li> Wouldn&#x27;t even hang in the shower... And it&#x27;s not fogless by any means.</li>
    <li> Have been looking for fog free shaving mirrors for years, and have bought many other mirrors - which didn&#x27;t work - before this one.  This mirror, and the larger one from ToiletTree is/are THE best.  Work PERFECTLY and remains completely fog free even when all other mirrors in bathroom are fogged up.  Also remains fog free for the duration of a not-so-quick shower.</li>
    <li> One has to remove the mirror each time one showers which is inconvenient unless one is constantly moving.  Other than that, it works fine but is some what  over priced, in my opinion.</li>
    <li> As advertised. Got fed up with the aluminum-round, doesn&#x27;t really stick to the tile and gets misted up easily, supermarket then Rite Aid, then Bed, Bath and Beyond, then Sharper Image route. Came swiftly and it works. The mirror takes in a small amount of warm water that comes from the shower, and it does stay mist free. The suction cups do well on tile, the little squidgy whipping tool thing is neat to stop the h20 spots, although it seems like the rubber bit may tear away (not sure why this bugs me, but the mirror is well made. Seems like the squidgy should be a bit more sturdy), which would easily render the wiping bit useless (which seems necessary for maintaing it&#x27;s effective use); however, I guess it could be dried or wiped with a towel. For some reason I thought it would roll up for travel, but it&#x27;s solid and roughly the size &amp; width of a C.D. case, easy to slip into a bag. It&#x27;s nice to have on the road, little comforts I guess, although the guy looking back at me could be better looking. I have dropped it only because I was&#x27;t paying attention (soapy hands), and it did crack about 1/4 inch in the corner, but it still works well. Best mirror so far that I have come across in my years of shaving while showing.</li>
    <li> I use it on my glass shower door, so I have no issue with it staying.  I like the fact it has a slight magnification as well.  I have zero complaints about this mirror.</li>
    <li> My impressions based on a few days of use so far:&lt;br /&gt;Pros: It doesn&#x27;t fog.&lt;br /&gt;Cons: I realize that this is a &amp;#34;travel size,&amp;#34; but I wish it were a bit wider. Also, the suction cups do not work very well; I have to reapply pressure to them a few times per shower to keep them stuck. (And by the way, I have to get them nice and wet first. If I leave them dry like the instructions say, they don&#x27;t work at all.)</li>
    <li> Have owned the Toiletree Fogless Mirror and now that I found this traveling version, I absolutely love it! Comes with me to all my travel trips. It truly works and suction cups do hold up very well.</li>
    <li> Works as advertised but the suction cups don&#x27;t hold real well and it falls off the wall constantly. Stronger sections cups would be better.</li>
    <li> It does what it says. Note mirror is plastic so its not as good a a glass mirror. That being said, it&#x27;s still a very good reflexion. I liked to travel size; smaller and easier to pack. Suction cups work very well on a daily baisis, but will come off over long periods of time. I&#x27;m pleased with the product.</li>
    <li> Simple idea and a well made product that works great. I rarely have to use the little squeegee but just rinse off the mirror and fill it with hot water right out of the shower head.</li>
    <li> It works as far as becoming fogless once you put hot water behind the plastic mirror.&lt;br /&gt;Flaws: Its small... you cant see your full face... and the mirror surface is uneven.</li>
    <li> I love this travel mirror. It&#x27;s lightweight, clear and protected in the included bag. It fits easily into my shaving kit and the no-fog capability makes it easy to use.</li>
    <li> My husband loves this. He tried a shower mirror in a hotel and fell in love with it. Since he travels a lot for work, I got him this one for the road, and the deluxe mirror for home. It was a great Christmas gift. No fogging and easy to use! It came the next day, I was so surprised! Thank you</li>
    <li> This mirror works fine, but I wouldn&#x27;t call it fog-less.  It fogs up like crazy and you can&#x27;t see anything in it.  Perhaps, they call it fog-less, because it comes with a little squeegee, which does work pretty well, but in about 2.7 seconds it&#x27;s fogged up again.  Kind of scratching my head on this \\&quot;fog-less\\&quot; claim.  My roommate has one in his shower that actually stays clear, so I just don&#x27;t know...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Manufacturer emailed me immediately after I wrote this review and explained that I wasn&#x27;t using it properly.  On this particular mirror, you fill the back of it up with hot water from the shower at the beginning of your shower(I thought it was just a place to store your razor and such... oops).  This is what causes it to be fog-less.  When you do this, it does stay clear and is very useful for shaving.  Great Customer Service!</li>
    <li> Simply a fantastic product. So easy to fill with water....and suction cup to shower wall. I purchased 2 of them. One I use at home every day....and one I have stored for when I travel.</li>
    <li> Works just like described. Plan to order the larger one to put up permanently.</li>
    <li> The 2 powerful double suction cups did not work. I don&#x27;t know if it was because of the texture of the tile, but it didn&#x27;t stick, unable to use.</li>
    <li> Truly fogless shower mirror. Fill with hot water and it&#x27;s clear for a 10-15 shower &amp; shave.  It&#x27;s seems a bit thin, so I&#x27;d be really careful if you actually travel with this, but at home, I&#x27;m not concerned as it stays on the wall without risk of falling and breaking.  The squeegee is a joke, it&#x27;s too soft and just spreads water around. Not a big deal though. Serves it&#x27;s purpose and great price with no chemicals to treat the glass surface.</li>
    <li> I read a few online reviews indicating the mirror was a bit small. I must imagine those folks have big heads. This is plenty big for shaving, etc. The mirror is a bit warped when you move far away, but that is not the intent of this fine mirror. I am having a bit of issue keeping the suction cups adhered to my marble walls. I assume that is because they are a bit porous. Not a big issue though. I would image these would hold up well on tile. I was most impressed that the owner of the company replied to several comments. That is why I made the purchase. Very impressed with that kind of customer service. I manufacture custom copper sinks and give very personalized service. I am always pleased to see similar service out there.</li>
    <li> This mirror does not stick to the shower tile wall, it falls off.  The suction cups are not strong enough to hold it up.  Seems like even a little product testing would have dicovered this problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To make it work \\&quot;fogless\\&quot; you must fill and unfill a resevoir with warm or hot water.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve requested a return.</li>
    <li> It works really well. Other &amp;#34;fogless&amp;#34; mirrors I bought for my husband worked for a couple months but then stopped. We&#x27;ve had this one for about 6months and it works each time. I like that u just have to fill it with water in the back which it warms up the mirror, so u can decide when u want to use it. The squeegee which is attached at the bottom is useful when there are too many water droplets on the mirror. Really good fogless mirror.</li>
    <li> Mirror is MUCH smaller than expected. I guess I should have read the details more closely before purchasing. Overall quality is low. The mirror is distorted and looks like a funhouse mirror, but it is good enough to see your basic reflection for shaving at least. The squeegee that comes with it is a piece of junk. You have better luck blowing the water off the mirror than you do wiping it off with that thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The &#x27;fogless&#x27; aspect is a water reservoir that you fill every time you shower with hot water. This part works quite well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh and beware of hard water stains on the mirror itself. They set in and are very difficult to remove.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m constantly traveling and this mirror is absolutely ideal for me.  It doesn&#x27;t fog up, sticks firmly to shower walls and isn&#x27;t too small like the last mirror I had.  The pouch is a nice little bonus that keeps the mirror from scratching when in my bag. I definitely recommend it - especially for travelers!</li>
    <li> I have used a shower mirror for many years and the one I had finally got too old.  I am 100% happy with this mirror and in fact like it much more than my old mirror.  It is more compact and easier to pack for trips.  It is much easier to fill with hot water to stop the fogging and the image in the mirror is sharp and clear during the whole shower.  After I received my mirror and saw how great it was I bought two more - one to use everyday at home and a spare.  Since I just turned 70, I think I have a life time supply.  Stan</li>
    <li> It is simple compact easy to use and it works as advertised. Very good and inexpensive compared to others which cost much more</li>
    <li> This is completely anti-fogless.  It has one job...to be fogless and it does that incredibly poorly.  Very disappointed in this product!</li>
    <li> I have seen some negative feedback pertaining to this product and I don&#x27;t know why. This works fine. Doesn&#x27;t fog up. Stays stuck to the shower wall. Makes it easier to shave in the shower.</li>
    <li> What a piece of junk! Threw it away after ten minutes of unsuccessfully trying to make the suction cups adhere to \\&quot;the smooth surface\\&quot;.... Signed, Robert M. Letteau, Judge (ret.)</li>
    <li> Works really well, especially for the price.</li>
    <li> Fill it with hot water and it works great.</li>
    <li> I got the travel edition, mostly because it can be used in various showers, and I didn&#x27;t want to buy a new one when I moved, or put the permanent one on and find it&#x27;s in the wrong spot.  I gave it 4 starts because it falls off sometimes, and makes a loud noise.  Not a big deal in and of itself, but I fear it might break eventually from the falls.</li>
    <li> Product works as advertised!  Had a few scratches show up on one of my travel trips, but Toilettree took care of the issue with NO hassle.  Great company.  Will buy from them again.</li>
    <li> This may be first review here, and I&#x27;m compelled to write it because it is rare to find a product that really does perform exactly as hoped. This mirror works great! Once filled with hot water from the shower, it really does not fog at all. The suction cups hold the mirror in place on my glass shower door without the mirror slipping down during the shave, and it is easy to remove the mirror when I&#x27;m done. The included squeegee is a handy addition too, to help wipe off water that splashes/beads on it. I chose this version for home use over the larger one because I required a more temporary mounting option, and I don&#x27;t find the small size to be any problem at all. It is plenty large enough for me to see what I am doing, even when shaving my head.</li>
    <li> Great product, I have a larger version but I am beginning to think I like this size more.  Perhaps a mid size unit with a place to hang a razor and toothbrush?</li>
    <li> This is indeed a great item.  Easy to install, crystal clear mirror like surface, great for traveling.  ToiletTree Products, the manufacturer is as wonderful as all the reviews attest.  I hit them 3 times with loads of questions and they rapidly answered them all within a few hours.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> Works great!! No fog so far.  I&#x27;ve  had it 3 wks. Glad I went with the smaller one.  Perfect size for shaving in the shower.  Suction cups work perfect every time.</li>
    <li> Best mirror for in the shower</li>
    <li> I own the deluxe mirror for my home but hated shaving on vacation without it so I bought the travel size. The suction cups are strong enough to hold the mirror with water in the chamber and I haven&#x27;t had a problem with different surfaces in different showers. ToiletTree makes solid reliable products at a reasonable price. Thanks!!!</li>
    <li> The travel size fogless mirror is a great product. I bought it for my son as a gift. I received great service and it was a great price.</li>
    <li> This product does what it says it does.  It is a great size for travel (about the size of a Kindle Paperwhite).  All you have to do is fill up the reservoir with hot water and use the little squeegee to clean the water off and its ready to go.  I&#x27;ve had it for a couple months and have had no issue.  Great product!</li>
    <li> Product was OK but I was disappointed that the description of &amp;#34;travel size&amp;#34; wasn&#x27;t made clear in the description of the product. I thought I was getting a normal size mirror and not travel size. After I received it I looked in the small print description and it does say it there that its travel size. Just wished they would have called it a travel size fogless mirror in bold print description.</li>
    <li> I recently bought this for my boyfriend I was a little worried about the size. It does fog, I understand the instructions for it not to fog but it does anyway, it is perfect sticks on the wall perfectly and doesn&#x27;t slip off! I love it!</li>
    <li> This mirror is the perfect size for travel and every day usage.  It works like a charm to remain fog free throughout my shower.  I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Originally, I gave the product a bad reivew due to the mirror kept fogging. If only I had read the directions and filled the back cavity of the mirror with hot water then I would know this mirror works perfectly. However, you will need to refill the cavity each time you are ready to use it. I would recommend this to anyone in the market for a fogless mirror. Thank you to Toilet Tree Products for emailing on the directions. Much appreciated.</li>
    <li> THIS MIRROR SERVES NO PURPOSE, IT FOGGED UP EVERYTIME I TRY TO SHAVE. I THOUGHT IT SAID FOGLESS SHOWER MIRROR. BUT IT&#x27;S NOT SO TRUE ABOUT THAT.</li>
    <li> Mirror is just okay.  It still fogs up for some reason about 1/3 of the way from the bottom.  You have to replace warm water in the back slot before use each time.</li>
    <li> My husband uses very warm water to shower so very mirror I&#x27;d purchase would end up fogging up at some point (yes those mirrors claimed fog proof).  it doesn&#x27;t matter how hot the shower or the length of the hot shower; this mirror will NOT fog up!! And as a bonus, the suction cups on the back hold firmly to our tiled shower wall.</li>
    <li> Refill everyday or the darn thing falls off the wall.  This is what I have experienced anyway, otherwise, I can&#x27;t complain.</li>
    <li> I had the larger version and bought this for travel. Works great and to me the size is perfect. Ended up getting another to permanently replace the big one</li>
    <li> Was a lot smaller than I thought.</li>
    <li> We&#x27;ve been using this for years and just replaced it with a new one, as one suction cup was getting a little worn. However, that&#x27;s after years of almost daily use by two people. This is a great, very portable shower mirror that you can take with you anywhere you go. We had a couple of their regular shower mirrors before, but this one is so easy to put up and remove that we use it for home as well as travels. If you like shower mirrors for shaving, you can&#x27;t make a better choice than this.</li>
    <li> Works as described.  Nothing particularly great or bad about it.  If you like to shave in the shower, this is a good option.</li>
    <li> Really fogless!  I recommend this product.</li>
    <li> My husband had been requesting a new shower mirror. After looking at the stores and not having many options, I decided to try amazon. I didn&#x27;t want to spend the 25 or so dollars for the full size one that the toilet tree offers, so I opted for this travel size.  It is perfect! My husband was skeptical when it first came in but changed his mind after using it one time! He loves it!</li>
    <li> This is a great mirror for my husband in the shower. It is easy to use and does not fog up.</li>
    <li> This is a great little shaving mirror; I bought it for my husband, who wanted to simplify his morning routine by \\&quot;killing two birds with one stone.\\&quot;  Shave and shower. Done!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He says he likes this, because:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Mirror is big enough and is a REAL mirror, not just a polished surface.&lt;br /&gt;2. Suction cups grip tightly, so it stays in place.&lt;br /&gt;3. Lightweight so it doesn&#x27;t slip down the wall.&lt;br /&gt;4. Fill the built-in channel behind the mirror with warm water from the shower before you stick it to the wall.  Now it won&#x27;t \\&quot;fog up\\&quot; while you shave.&lt;br /&gt;5. Has a small squeegee that slides in and out of a groove in the bottom of the mirror frame.  Too many water droplets on the mirror while you&#x27;re shaving?  Squeegee them off &amp; you have a crystal clear view again. Easy to put the squeegee back with one hand.&lt;br /&gt;6. Travel bag makes for easy pack &amp; go.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s nothing fancy, but it works &amp; he says he&#x27;s happy to have something that maximizes his Efficiency Factor.  If he&#x27;s happy, I&#x27;m happy.  This was a relatively inexpensive shave/shower solution and it does its job well; a recommended buy!</li>
    <li> Just the right size, doesn&#x27;t steam up when water is in it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The mirror is clean and shaving in the shower is best.</li>
    <li> Well designed, works good, clear mirror, does not move on fiberglass shower wall, seems sturdy. I can recommend with confidence.</li>
    <li> actual size less than catalog picture shown  ok quality but question lasting more than 6 months before replacing;  no frame dimensions given  should have known</li>
    <li> I have been using a &#x27;fog free&#x27; mirror for years and had gotten used to having to deal with a cruddy reflection while shaving. Then I bought this and my shaving experience has been elevated to a new level. OK, maybe that&#x27;s a stretch, but I can at least see myself when shaving. The little squeegee which I thought was a joke of some sort actually works like a charm!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got the smaller &#x27;portable&#x27; mirror and use it for everyday use. Unless you have one of those extra large alien-style faces, this should work. I use the mirror on my glass shower door and the move it to the window when I&#x27;m done. It&#x27;s easy to pull off / or attach with the suction cups. This was one of those inexpensive items I was so glad I finally bought...</li>
    <li> This mirror is the best design ever.  It is simple and effective. Dump out old water, put in fresh hot water from shower and shave.  I am glad they did not even bother to put a plug at the bottom for draining the water as this would invariably have failed especially in hard water areas..  The squeegee works well.  This mirror, meant for travel, is my main mirror now.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t believe it would actually work at first but the mirror is truly fogless. My boyfriend loves it now he can shave in the shower instead of leaving a mess in the sink, and on top of that it got here days before it said it would arrive.</li>
    <li> This mirror was sold to me as a fogless mirror with a squeegee attached making easy use, however it became immediate clear (actually the opposite) the second I turned on the hot water to my shower that this was a false statement.  Within 30 seconds of turning on my shower the mirror was foggier than a swamp in Louisiana at dawn!  Then when I attempted to pull out the &amp;#34;sqeegee&amp;#34;, which I put in quotes for a reason, it was difficult to pull out of the bottom, pulling the mirror off the wall.  This was despite the supposedly amazing suction cups that will adhere to any surface (not really, I had to set up a hook and tie a string to the mirror).  The &amp;#34;squeegee&amp;#34; then basically smeared the fog around a little bit, not clearing it off really and withing 5 seconds it was completely fogged up again.  I know the price was low, but this was a waste of money.</li>
    <li> I bought this for every day use and it works great. Get the shower hot, pour hot water into the mirror and viola! No more fog. A squeegee is included to remove excess water or to speed up the defogging process. I&#x27;ve struggled with other shower mirrors but this is the best I&#x27;ve found.</li>
    <li> I stand corrected, I previously thought the mirror was not working as promised, however it does work properly, IT WILL NOT FOG and its PERFECT FOR TRAVEL, the only issue us you have to fill the back of the mirror with water everytime you shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ToiletTree provides exceptional customer service.</li>
    <li> update on mirror after 3 months&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the suction cups fail after a short time, and mirror falls off the wall.&lt;br /&gt;there must be better mirrors out there, this was the waste of $15&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mirror works well, just remember to fill with warm water.&lt;br /&gt;A Magnifier Mirror would be even better, if using to Shave in the Shower</li>
    <li> The fog free shower mirror works very well.  My husband uses it and now shaves in the shower which he says is easier to do.</li>
    <li> As the title states, this mirror works as advertised. It is small, but effective. I do not use it for travel, so I cannot comment on that.</li>
    <li> My husband loves to use this on his business travels :D Just loved the science behind it that the mirror won&#x27;t fog because of the water on the reservoir on its back is same temp on the bathroom. Amazing! Thanks toilettree!</li>
    <li> Works great. Just fill the thing with a little water. Glad it comes with the little pouch for traveling. :)</li>
    <li> There are plenty of reviews to attest to this mirror&#x27;s ability to be fog-free. This fit my needs perfectly. I wanted to start shaving in the shower but didn&#x27;t want to permanently attach it to the shower wall like the larger ToiletTree mirror. With hot water in the basin and a quick squeegee, this works like a charm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do wish that it was a little bigger. I wish they made one the same size as their permanent model, but with suction cups on the bag. Also, this thing needs a plug or something at the bottom that makes it easier to empty. I usually keep one suction cup partially disengaged from the mirror so I can tilt the water out. Alternately, I just leave the water in there and pour more hot water in one side during my next shower.</li>
    <li> Size is small but provides a pretty good viewing surface. Works well, this is a solid product that doesn&#x27;t fog at all.</li>
    <li> this product is a keeper! I&#x27;ve had a number of so called fogless mirrors over the years-this is the first one that is truly fogless. I like it so much I bought a 2nd for another location. George</li>
    <li> was an excellent purchase, the product met my expectations. product quality good, a good product, I recommend this product to other potential customers here from Amazon</li>
    <li> Just what I wanted. These fog free mirrors that use warm water are the best I&#x27;ve found and this one does the trick. Even has a nice squeegie&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d say the only way to make it better would be to separate the suction cups and mirror into 2 different pieces so it is easier to remove the mirror to fill/empty</li>
    <li> Overall, I am satisfied with this mirror. While it does fog up, I find that spraying it with hot water for a couple of seconds will clear it long enough to shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing to keep in mind is the size. This mirror is 4.75 inches x 5.5 inches, meaning that it is quite small. Also, it looks pretty cheap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the price, I think it&#x27;s a decent value.</li>
    <li> Mirror is not fogless, I&#x27;ve had mine for two weeks and it started fogging up on the third day. It gets the job done but it&#x27;s not &amp;#34;fogless&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> One of the suction cups will not stay on the glass.  The size is perfect.  You are suppose to fill it with warm water, he does not because of the added weight and the suction cups don&#x27;t work that well.</li>
    <li> This mirror is good.  I wish it had a place where the water drains out the bottom.  It comes off of the wall after every use to drain.  It does not fog up and seems to do the job!</li>
    <li> Shower shaving with a fogless mirror is so much better than the old way.  For my home a few months ago, I bought and mounted the shower mirror that sticks to the wall with silicon adhesive.  I was a bit leery of using the adhesive, but it went up beautifully and I am very satisfied.  I realize now that if I ever wanted to remove it, it would be very easy to remove all traces of the silicon.  The ledge to hold the razor is great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I had a positive experience with the permanent model, and since I am traveling quite a bit these days, I decided to also try the travel version of the fogless shower mirror.  Again I&#x27;m quite impressed.  It is smaller than the permanent model and very lightweight.  I was concerned about the suction cups working properly, but after more than a month of using the product on the road, everything is great, the suction cups hold it up beautifully, and once again, I am a satisfied customer.</li>
    <li> Great mirror, doesn&#x27;t fog up (so long as you place hot shower water in it as you are supposed to). The suction cups keep it up on the wall and let you easily move it around.</li>
    <li> This mirror works great for shaving in the shower.  Suction cups seem to hold well so far and with the chamber filled with the shower water it doesn&#x27;t seem to fog.</li>
    <li> This mirror does what it suppose to and it is large enough. Little squeegee included is handy as well. I placed it in our master bathroom shower, which works fine for me. Since we travel a lot, I can carry it with me everywhere and enjoy the convenience of having the mirror in the shower. Recommend.</li>
    <li> The mirror is great, it&#x27;s the right size, has a cool little squeegee, and works perfectly all around. It&#x27;s my standard everyday mirror as well as a travel mirror.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint is that in order for the defogging to work you have to fill the compartment behind the mirror with hot water - this requires removing the mirror from the wall, which isn&#x27;t by itself so horrible. The problem is that the suction cups work very well and there&#x27;s no easy way to pull the mirror off of the suction cups. So there is a minor struggle to get the mirror de-suctioned and filled with water each morning. This product could be perfected by allowing the mirror to be disconnected from the suction cups easily for filling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still an awesome product at a great price.</li>
    <li> Be aware of size : IT IS TINY!!! is NOT fog less either. Wish I wouldn&#x27;t have bought it. e</li>
    <li> I halfway expected a bit more.  Great product so far, just a little smaller than anticipated for the price.  Very well built, and great concept.  Haven&#x27;t shaved out of the shower since I have received it!</li>
    <li> The mirror is small and it fogs up... lol. It is built kind of strange.  The top has an opening, maybe to hold a razor, but fills up with water in the shower and no drain. I guess I give it 2 stars because at least it stays stuck to the wall, and to date, I&#x27;ve never seen a &amp;#34;fogless&amp;#34; mirror.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product because the gym where I work out has automatic shut off faucets with cold water only. Naturally, this made shaving not very fun. This product allows me to shave with hot water in the shower, and fits easily into my gym bag. It works perfectly as advertised!</li>
    <li> I have honestly used about 10 shower mirrors in my home.  All were horrible and did not live up to claims.  This one is GREAT!  It&#x27;s a travel mirror but I use it at home too.  What an awesome idea to fill it with water, you literally can&#x27;t even fog it if you try.  Honestly this product needs twelve stars!  You will not be disappointed.  I ended up getting there travel toiletries bag too and it&#x27;s awesome as well.  Your search is over.  Go get one now!!!  Great Christmas gift too!</li>
    <li> This exceeds my expectations. Works exceeding well!!</li>
    <li> ToiletTree takes the larger fogless mirror and makes it pint-sized for travel. I love the smaller size and the fact that it doesn&#x27;t fog up in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;This is a great mirror for anyone on the go, or even everyday use. We have the larger one and love it and this pint-sized one is great for our older kiddos to use in the shower.</li>
    <li> We already have a ToiletTree Fogless Shower Mirror in our shower. My husband loves his mirror, he uses it to shave every morning. He says his skin feels better if he shaves in the steam from the shower. I love his mirror because there are no longer shaved whiskers around the bathroom sink every morning. It&#x27;s been a winner for both of us.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He travels a lot for his job and misses being able to shave in the shower while on the road. He loves his new travel size mirror. It fits nicely in his travel case, the mirror is 4.75 inches x 5.5 inches. I&#x27;m hoping he just doesn&#x27;t forget to check the shower before he checks out of a hotel room. He would be pretty upset if he left this behind!</li>
    <li> I received this product to review on my Give Oh Giveaway Blog. I liked the mirror very much. It had easy instructions to follow, and it worked. It is great for my family because my tall husband can use it. I can lower it for me and we can put it down very low for the kids in the bath who actually can wash their \\&quot;WHOLE\\&quot; face because they can see it! :) It has been dropped a couple of times and it didn&#x27;t damage at all. Overall I am happy with this product.</li>
    <li> Product works with no fogging noted.  I use it both at home and on the road for shaving my head.</li>
    <li> I purchased this shaving mirror as I find it more convenient to shave/shower at the same time. This is a pretty cool mirror that certainly works as it&#x27;s supposed to. All you do is, just prior to shaving, fill the little resevoir with warm/hot water and your good to go. It&#x27;s involved science and physics, but basically the warm water in the resevoir keeps the mirror from fogging up. It also has a small \\&quot;squeege\\&quot; to help keep the mirrored surface clean. The suction cups seem to be adequate for the job. Included in the package is a travel/carrying type drawstring pouch so you can take the mirror when you travel. Overall you can&#x27;t go wrong with this product if you are looking for a economical, portable and competent fogless shaving mirror.</li>
    <li> This mirror is NOT fogless at all.  I got it in the shower and it fogs so bad you can&#x27;t even see yourself in it.&lt;br /&gt;When I received it I trashed the box as I opened it, so I couldn&#x27;t return it.  DO NOT BUY IT****</li>
    <li> Fantastic product.  Works as advertised.</li>
    <li> Works very well.  I thought it would be annoying filling it up with warm water every single time but it&#x27;s not, and it&#x27;s much better than dealing with anti-fog spray. Wish I would have had this sooner.</li>
    <li> I am very happy with the mirror. Have use it several times and has not fog up.  Would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Thank you for getting my product to me in a timely fashion. I have one of these myself and want to share it this Christmas with my son-in-laws. Great product that does what it&#x27;s supposed to do.&lt;br /&gt;Darryl</li>
    <li> I have been shaving in the shower for 30 years and this ia one of the better fogless mirrors I ever had</li>
    <li> I thought it&#x27;d be too small, but it turns out you don&#x27;t need a full sized mirror to shave your chin... I love it.</li>
    <li> ...and I was wrong. The mirror works with the recommended fix. I&#x27;d also like to commend ToiletTree Products for their insanely quick response to my post. I will update my review from 1 to 4 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OLD REVIEW:&lt;br /&gt;No idea how this can be considered a \\&quot;fogless\\&quot; mirror when it literally fogs up five seconds after I turn on the shower. To quote Kevin Sorbo: \\&quot;DISAPPOINTED!\\&quot;</li>
    <li> I bought this because it said \\&quot;Fogless\\&quot;.  It&#x27;s not.  It&#x27;s very small and the suction cups dont keep it on the wall.  I keep forgetting but I was going to return it.  Dont like it at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That was my first review....I still dont care for it.  Never returned it because we found out you had to add hot water to the back of it to make it work.  We did that and it does stop the fog.  I still dont care for it because it is not really big enough.  Cant seem to find that \\&quot;Perfect\\&quot; shower mirror.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my boyfriend.  But when it came in. I really thought it was going to be bigger. But it works</li>
    <li> I bought this mirror to replace the one I got for Christmas which included a radio which didn&#x27;t work and a fogless mirror which didn&#x27;t work. Well it keep falling off the tub and finally broke. I ordered this......  fill it up with hot water and it works. The science behind this make it impossible to fog. After I use it... dump the water out and set it on the side of the tube to dry. LOVE IT!!!!  Great quality!!!</li>
    <li> I have gone through countless fogless mirrors because the coating wears off eventually. I had tried all the tricks to keep them fogless to no avail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This mirror works everytime, and I am done purchasing fogless mirrors. Hooray</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure why all these mirrors say fogless.  All of them still fog up.  But it does the job.  The suction cups hold really nice.  I like it and would recommend it.....at least until a true fogless mirror is invented.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT: I was guilty of not reading the instructions.  Didn&#x27;t think a simple mirror required instructions, but I was wrong.  It&#x27;s not really a fogless mirror, but it does not fog up with the help of water in the rear receptacle.  It works great, and I modified my rating.</li>
    <li> Works great.  Best shower mirror I&#x27;ve ever had.</li>
    <li> Not bad. A little smaller than I thought it would be but it works.</li>
    <li> So far, this is a great little shower mirror. It&#x27;s easy to use and small enough to take along when traveling. It has been in use for over a month now and we are pleased with it.</li>
    <li> I love my no fog Mirror . It really works. What a great application of Physics. I would recommend this to everyone who likes to shave in the shower.</li>
    <li> This mirror works great.  I like this travel version better than ToiletTree&#x27;s other versions of this mirror, mainly because this travel version comes with suction cups and the other versions have to be glued to the shower wall.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first thing you do when you get in the shower is pop this mirror off of the shower wall and fill up the reservoir with warm water.  Once it&#x27;s full, stick it back to the wall.  Your mirror won&#x27;t fog up, due to the fact that there is warm shower water immediately behind the mirror.  Physics is great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is no spot to store your razor, so you&#x27;ll have to keep it somewhere else.  Other than that, it&#x27;s perfect.</li>
    <li> It does accumulates fog. but it is very portable and spacious. So its a good buy guys for its price.</li>
    <li> This works just like the larger size, it absolutely does not fog in the shower. I&#x27;ll never leave home overnight without it.</li>
    <li> I also own the home version and I just love it.  This is a great product if you travel like I do, it is great for the frequent road warrior.</li>
    <li> It works as directed and its stores easy for travel. Great for pragmatist minds because its truly functional. I would recommend this product but do take note of its size coz it might be smaller than what you want so break out the ruler and paper to check if you can live with that.</li>
    <li> I got this so I could start shaving in the shower and it&#x27;s been a great buy. It&#x27;s sold as the travel size version but it works just fine at home and does exactly what it says. So long as I fill it up with warm water it never fogs up and the included squeegee is a nice touch. It&#x27;s a good, simple little mirror that I&#x27;d highly recommend.</li>
    <li> My boyfriend loved this! I didn&#x27;t think it would work but it definitely does! He loves to shave in the shower and he can easily take it with him anywhere we go when traveling (:</li>
    <li> I won this mirror from an online contest but I would pay cash for it, its definitely worth it! It is a great product, easy to use, and does everything it says it should do. I love using it in the shower for applying facial cleanser instead of using the medicine cabinet mirror which fogs so easily.</li>
    <li> Fogless, really?  I don&#x27;t think so.  Why in the heck would there be a need for a little squeegee, if it didn&#x27;t fog?  This is a terrible mirror as well as it is too small.</li>
    <li> I got this for my boyfriend for his birthday.  I was afraid it would be too small at first since it&#x27;s travel sized but it&#x27;s perfect, it just fits your entire face.  Like other people have said, it needs to be filled with your shower temperature water in order for it to be fogless.  The squeegee is slid out from the side and works amazingly well, so well that sometimes i like getting water on it just so I can squeegee it off :).  It comes with a little cloth travel pouch that just fits the mirror so you can bring it with you wherever you go.  It&#x27;s fallen off my walls a few times, but only when I leave water in it for a while and leave the bathroom/forget about it.  It&#x27;s never fallen off when it&#x27;s empty or during the short period of times it takes my bf to shave.</li>
    <li> Not really fogless. But good reflective surface, sturdy build. Okay for kids to use with their Waterpick.</li>
    <li> Fill with warm water and done!!! Couldn&#x27;t be happier.</li>
    <li> Works great if you follow the directions to combat fog.</li>
    <li> I love this mirror. I had another mirror that just didn&#x27;t work as well so I tried this one. The well behind it makes it so it never fogs up. Just fill it up with shower water before you shave and your all set. Definitely recommend it to anyone who wants a good shave.</li>
    <li> This is my third ToiletTree product purchase. I have their oral irrigator and hair trimmer (best one I&#x27;ve ever used!). I love their customer service and how they respond to their customers. I knew if there was ever an issue with this mirror, any issues would be handled to my satisfaction.  I&#x27;ve never believed a mirror could be fog free except for the ones that are connected to the shower head to have warm water flow through them. This employs the same concept. Fill it with warm water which equalizes the temperature and it&#x27;s truly fog free. I liked this small travel size better than the larger ones with permanent adhesives.  I can easily move this anywhere I want and I love that option. The frame is very small so it&#x27;s mostly mirror. The mirrored part is 4.4 inches across and 5 inches long. I use it to brush and floss my teeth in the shower and I can easily see my entire face, head and top of my shoulders. The clarity is very good. We have very hard water so I&#x27;m sure to wipe it dry with my towel after I empty the reservoir. I noticed the suction cups can slide out so they can be replaced if they wear out. Nice feature!  I agree the large mirrors should have drain holes and cups to fill the reservoirs for those of us without removable shower heads. I&#x27;m not concerned about that for the travel mirror. I appreciate the included travel bag for the mirror.  In summary - great product! I&#x27;m very happy with it.  I think many negative reviews stem from people not reading and following the instructions and not properly caring for their purchases (e.g. knowing you have hard water and not removing the residual water from the mirror so then etching occurs.)</li>
    <li> This was a request from my secret santa partner -  so I hope the recipient likes his choice and the service was excellent.</li>
    <li> This works just like it should - you put the warm water in the back and the mirror stays clear.</li>
    <li> I use it every day in the shower works great last the entire time in the shower fog less is fog less.</li>
    <li> This product is exactly as advertised. Truly fogless. Even comes with a travel bag for easy storage when traveling. It makes shaving in the shower a breeze.</li>
    <li> This is a great product for anyone that shaves in the shower or just looks at himself or herself if your into that.&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t believe this hasn&#x27;t been around longer . What a simple idea and a great product . Well made!</li>
    <li> I am not one to write a review, but I felt on this product I needed to write something because there are some great things with this product and also some concerns.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like the size.  When I first opened the box and saw how small it was, I was a little shocked, but after using it for a few months now, I really don&#x27;t need anything bigger.  I also liked that it isn&#x27;t permanently mounted and I can still remove it to clean the shower.  I like how it doesn&#x27;t fog up.  After you put the warm water in the unit it stays clear the whole time you shower.  My morning routine has been simplified because of this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I have concerns over is the quality of the construction.  I have only had this product for a couple of months now and the mirror and the plastic that is holding the mirror to the unit is coming apart.  I am afraid that in the next couple of months I am going to have to buy a new one because they have totally separated from each other.  I don&#x27;t know if I received a defective unit or if this happens to all of them over time, but after two months I wouldn&#x27;t expect this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, today I am still pleased with my purchase.  I will have to monitor the mirror to make sure it is staying together.  I am hopeful I will not have to buy another one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Right after posting this, the President of ToiletTree Products sent me a message showing amazing customer service. I am already impressed with the company and with their ability to stand behind their products. Because of this I am changing my review from three to four stars. Thanks for taking care of your customers!</li>
    <li> Every bit as good as I expected and wanted. No issues. Small and compact, and the suction cups keep it securely attached to the tiles in my shower. Simple rinsing occasionally for very good visual while shaving.</li>
    <li> Perfect travel size, but slightly smaller than hoping to use regularly at home</li>
    <li> Very happy with this purchase... it has lasted several months and is going strong.  While it&#x27;s not made out of the highest-quality materials, it does the job perfectly.  I bought it just to use in my home shower rather than for travelling, but it does come with a little carrying pouch if you wanted to use it.  There is a tiny squeegee to wipe off the mirror once you fill the inside of it with shower water...again it&#x27;s not terribly high quality but it does the job just fine.  I would maybe go for a slightly larger mirror in the future if I were to get another one, but that&#x27;s just up to personal preference.</li>
    <li> not any better than the rest on the market</li>
    <li> Actually does work as a fog-free.  Mirror is smaller than I would have liked and its a little bit of an inconvenience to have to empty the water trough but it works so I like it.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t know how I lived without one of these. I&#x27;d prefer not having to fill the reservoir with water boiled in the depths of hell to prevent fogging - but hey, we do what we gotta do. For $15 bucks, this thing is high end irreplaceable convenience. I adore it. I don&#x27;t much fool with the squeegee at all, but if you fill it up with hot water it&#x27;ll last the length of the shower I&#x27;ve found, and I like long showers.</li>
    <li> 2nd purchase of this, my husband lost the 1st one. Best travel gift for men.</li>
    <li> For the price it seems fine. The suction cups are a bit weak; it&#x27;s fallen twice. (This seems to happen later in the day after the shower dries.) However, it hasn&#x27;t cracked and it is fogless.</li>
    <li> Nice mirror that does not fog. I gave it 4 stars because I thought the quality of the suction cups and the squeegee were not 5 star quality.</li>
    <li> Mirror really does stay fog free when filled with the hot shower water.</li>
    <li> I really do like this little mirror.  I didnt pay attention to it being a travel one but its still big enough to work with.  Ive been using it since the day I took it out of the box.  It works, you fill it up with hot water and I can watch all my glass doors and mirror fog up but this little mirror stays clear.</li>
    <li> Mirror is only good if you are right up on it because it&#x27;s bent.  It&#x27;s cheap plastic so it&#x27;s expected but a bit extreme in some spots.</li>
    <li> The feature keeps it fog free and easy to clean.</li>
    <li> Wonderful! I purchased two more of them to give away as gifts.</li>
    <li> The size and portability of this mirror is great. I really like that there is a squeegee attachment and suction cups making it perfect for the shower! The bag is nice and would pack well in a carry on or overnight bag! The mirror was shipped nicely and quickly!  UPDATE: After having this mirror a year or so all I can say is that its not fogless but the squeegee helps when it does fog up or you can wipe it with your hands and water. The suction cups hold well and it has stayed clean and rust free.</li>
    <li> I must say when I first received this product I thought and felt it was another basic mirror that fogged like crazy, but then the company sent me an e-mail and explained how it worked. I am a true believer now the mirror never fogs up. All you have to do is fill the back of the mirror up with warm water and ta-da! A fogless mirror. Great product I high recommend this for a home and or travel mirror.</li>
    <li> Where has this been for all these years!  I&#x27;ve been a long time shaver in the shower and I&#x27;ve struggled with foggy mirrors to doing it blind and hoping for the best.  This little beauty though provides the best and clearest reflection I&#x27;ve ever experienced.  The ease with which you can adjust the height and location in the shower is excellent.&lt;br /&gt;I do a lot of travel with my work and this is the perfect addition to my travel products.  It is light and the little pouch is perfect.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend it!!!</li>
    <li> I like it a lot. I&#x27;ve always wanted to move my shave into the shower. I&#x27;m going to use it at home and while traveling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downside to using this mirror in the shower is the potential to use a lot more water (versus shaving over the sink) during the time I&#x27;m shaving. There is a workaround though. I collect shower water in a plastic container to rinse my blade so that I can turn the water off during my shave.</li>
    <li> I realize this mirror is for travel really - but I don&#x27;t use it that way - I use it every day - I fill it up wiht hot water in the shower and press it against the tiled wall of our shower and I squeegy it once or twice to get the droplets out of my way - but really it&#x27;s clear with the droplets without using the squeegy - and it stays perfectly clear without fogging because of the water temp...very ingenius - love it - I take it off and put it on every day - I don&#x27;t leave it on the wall but I get the feeling it could stay there permanently if I wanted to leave it there...but it really takes me only a couple of seconds to put it away in the shower caddy and fill it up and hang it every time I want to use it  and then it&#x27;s not in my wife&#x27;s way - and i don&#x27;t have to worry about the housekeeper breaking it - it&#x27;s quite small - but I only need it to shave - I&#x27;m up close to it - so it&#x27;s more than adequate...I&#x27;ve been using it for a few months now - every day - no issues. I will buy it again if it breaks or I want a new one for whatever reason - I&#x27;ve never had one that works this well - everything I&#x27;ve tried before eventually starts fogging and you basically wipe down and keep wiping down while you&#x27;re using it - this one is refreshingly good!  Great product and I highly recommend it for the money - don&#x27;t expect some super nice high dollar deal for $19.99 of course! But for the money - cannot be beat in my estimation.</li>
    <li> I travel a lot and this mirror is exactly what I needed. I literally have tested on just about every shower surface ever made and it never falls. Its lightweight and compact so it is easy to pack. It also comes with its on bag to protect it from scratches. Most importantly, it never fogs up on me. Has just enough magnification so shaving in the shower is a breeze and easy to see. Buy it, you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> Does not meet advertising statements - it is not fogless and the squeegee is a joke. In fact it fogs up as soon as the shower comes to temperature. The only good thing about it is the size. If you will send me a box I will return it for a refund.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bill Peters AKA pt23pilot@aol.com</li>
    <li> Good suction cups too. It was actually a bit of a pain to take off the tiles until I realized the easiest way is to slide it down over the grout line and then it comes right off.  Like all similar designs, this won&#x27;t fog up but you do have to deal with filling it with water everytime you use it (if you don&#x27;t it fogs like crazy). Can&#x27;t say I&#x27;ve every used the little squeegee thing that comes with it.</li>
    <li> This product works as described; fill the reservoir with hot water and it stays fog-free for the duration of my shower.  The mini-squeegee is effective at clearing enough of the water from the surface of the mirror to see clearly.  The size is perfect for me; I don&#x27;t need anything bigger to shave.  I gave the product 4 stars because it not with out a few inconveniences.  The suction cups hold so well that it can be difficult to pop loose from the wall of the shower.  To minimize this, after I&#x27;m done, I slide the mirror up and off the shower wall.  I empty it and store it in the rack hanging in my shower until next use.  Other than that, great product for the price and I would buy one again.</li>
    <li> I have owned both versions of the toilettree fogless mirror.  i think this one is much better!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;it is very portable and sticks well in the shower. the suction cups are solid, never had any issues with it coming off. easier to fill with water, size is just right, easy to keep out of the way when not in use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;the &amp;#34;permanent&amp;#34; version is nice, but is too big (i dont need a spot to rest my razor) and gives you no flexibility if you need to shave in another shower, get the back of your neck, etc. Also when i removed it from my old shower it was a pain to get all the sticky gunk off, and then you have a useless product (unless you buy more glue)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;if you&#x27;re trying to decide between the mirrors i recommend NOT getting the LED lighted one (pointless) or the other permanent fixture version. the travel version has everything you need!</li>
