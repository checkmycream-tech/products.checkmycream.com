      <li>The trimmer alone makes this razor great.  </li>
      <li>The quietness is great.</li>
      <li>This Braun Series 3 370 is a great razor but there is another Braun Series 3 370 razor that you should stay away from.    </li>
      <li>Great value in today&#x27;s world.&lt;br /&gt;B</li>
      <li>So for the money this is a great razor</li>
      <li>but the company is great because after calling they sent me a series 5 at no charge.  </li>
      <li>After about 2 shaves with this shaver I had adjusted my shaving to the head angle for it, and it has given great shaves ever since.  </li>
      <li>Providing a case that can carry the shaver and charging cord would be great.</li>
      <li>i have found out that this was a great surprise in</li>
      <li>Great buy, good shaver.  </li>
      <li>Father in law liked it!</li>
      <li>This may be the case, judging from the many excellent reviews of this product.  </li>
      <li>I bought it because I thought Braun made good products but not this razor.</li>
      <li>It is vastly superior to the Remington foil razor I had been using before.    </li>
      <li>and I am thankful for good service and good product.</li>
      <li>Anyway he was thrilled with this shaver and has told me what a great shave</li>
      <li>I had a German-made Braun in the 1980&#x27;s and had good experience with it.</li>
      <li>790cc Pulsonic Shaver System, Silver]], which gave a good shave, but shook itself to death in 26 months.  </li>
      <li>The shave is smooth and close very happy with it&lt;br /&gt;Have</li>
      <li>and it is a good improvement with the lock position for mustache shaving and the battery level indicator.</li>
      <li>The razor arrived on time and in good condition.  </li>
      <li>Bottom line: Would recommend if you can get a good price.</li>
      <li>I bought this model because it offered a hair trimmer as well as a good close shave.</li>
      <li>I hoped I could dump the disposable blades for good by purchasing this.  </li>
      <li>Battery life is good.</li>
      <li>I get good close shaves with it and 1 charge lasts 7-8 shaves.     </li>
      <li>This Braun shaver gives a good, close shave.</li>
      <li>It is louder than the 370, but I can deal with that to get a good shave again.</li>
      <li>Good value for the price, very pleased with product.</li>
      <li>An exceptional product that will not disappoint.</li>
      <li>If you need to shave quickly this is the item for you!!!</li>
      <li>and I am very pleased with its performance.</li>
      <li>but all in all I am very satisfied with my purchase.</li>
      <li>It had a great trimmer, but most trimmers I have used have been acceptable.  </li>
      <li>Satisfied with this shaver - battery life is great, shave is close.  </li>
      <li>After checking out all the reviews on the Braun shavers I desided on this model and am very pleased with it</li>
      <li>I am very pleased with it.</li>
      <li>Sure, it&#x27;s great that they have a switch to drop 2 of the 3 blades, but on my shaver that feature stopped working well after a couple of weeks.</li>
      <li>Works great, glad I bought it.</li>
      <li>I am very pleased with the Braun shaver, but maybe it is because I replaced an aging Norelco.</li>
      <li>nice shaver, good price, but</li>
      <li>Honestly, I think the build quality of the Braun is superior</li>
      <li>Love it!</li>
      <li>This seems to make sense, except that after three months of use, I find that applying any pressure to the razor now causes the head to spontaneously pop off.  </li>
      <li>He recommends  it to anyone that wants a perfect shave and a charge in \\&quot;45\\&quot; minutes.  </li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re going to spend that kind of money, look at the 5 or 7 series.</li>
      <li>After three weeks of shaving three or four times a week in the dining room I&#x27;m thrilled with the Braun.  </li>
      <li>Absolutely the best brand of electric razor on the market.</li>
      <li>Thanks Braun, for this excellent choice again.</li>
      <li>I also would like to have some kind of protective cover for the head</li>
      <li>effcient, effective.</li>
      <li>A plastic cover for the shaving head seems like it would be a good idea to better protect the head.  </li>
      <li>It sure is good at pulling my hair our though, and giving me razor burn.</li>
      <li>It gave me a great  shave the first time!!</li>
      <li>New Series 3 370 works excellent as always.</li>
      <li>The best part is that with the floating head, it shaves closer, easier, more comfortably and more quickly than the 4775.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very pleased and would purchase this item again.</li>
      <li>A nice, smoothe shave and very easy to use--------much better than the Norelco it replaced.</li>
      <li>this replaced my old Braun, which was awesome.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> An excellent razor  - cuts smoothly and very quietly.  There was one small (plastic) part missing.  I tel Braun, but, they referred me to their parts department.  No major problem.  SES.</li>
    <li> As usual, Braun products are serviceable, shave pretty good and run a decent amount of time on a charge. Gone are the days however, when Braun Razors were the gold standard, small compact razors that fit in your hand and gave the best shaves possible. I still long for my Braun Flex 5010 but any you find have dead batteries that cannot be easily replaced, have to soldered. So I bought a second Braun Series 3 before they discontinue this model as a back-up. I don&#x27;t need it yet so it is a spare. My existing Braun series 3 runs fine, and I use a fine mineral oil to lubricate the cutters.</li>
    <li> This Braun Series 3 370 is a great razor but there is another Braun Series 3 370 razor that you should stay away from.    I had bought the other Braun Series 3 370 and it was bad right out of the box.  Thus I wasn&#x27;t sure if I should buy this one.  After reading the reviews and realizing I could return the unit if it performed like the other one I gave it a shot.      It is a great a razor.  A nice close and smooth shave.  I went an entire weekend not shaving to see how it would work after 3 days of not shaving and it still worked great.  Nice and smooth, no pulling and nice and close.  The only problem is finding a replacement cartridge.  I bought one right away as they seem to be hard to find.  They are a bit expensive but it seems that all replacement cartridges are expensive now a days.      So for the money this is a great razor and I highly recommend it.  But beware that there are 2 Braun Series 3 370 razors out there and they are much different from one another.  This one is great the other is a one star that you need to stay away from.</li>
    <li> There are lots of good things to say about this shaver, most of which are covered in other reviews (which caused me to buy this model).     Overall, I am happy with the purchase. It is very handy, especially for travelling, with its case and the stupid liquid regulations by the airline industry (no shaving foam, blah, blah).    My 2 cents to add to the general reviews:    Pro:  - the battery life is outstanding. I have used it for probably 10 shaves or more, and it is still going strong without needing to be recharged.   - It stays very nice and clean by simply using water to rinse the components.   - The long hair trimmer is very good.     Con:  - The shave is not as close as wet shaves with the Gillette Fusion 5 blade. I realize that you need to give your face time to adjust, but it ain&#x27;t the same.   - It also does not take less time than a wet shave, at least for me.     But overall, good product.</li>
    <li> I have been shaving with Braun products for 35 years, and have always been pleased, with the exception of the price for the replacement cutters/foils.&lt;br /&gt;However, this particular product is awful, it does not shave close enough, and good luck finding replacement cutters locally.&lt;br /&gt;Thankfully I saved my old Braun shaver, and as much as I tried to use this one (it was a gift) I eventually went back to my old one.</li>
    <li> I am still trying to figure out what the advanced hair-cutting technology is this shaver has. Having read other reviews of this product before I bought it, I thought this shaver would work well for my face. I have medium-thick facial hair when it grows out. I trimmed my beard to short stubble and tried to use this shaver to finish the job. After 5 minutes, I still had a face and neck of short stubble, but a nice case of razor burn developing made this one of the worst shaves ever. I had to finish the job with a standard blade razor. I let the razor burn calm down and tried the shaver again to see if it was a fluke for having just went from very bearded to clean-shaven. The second shave was a failure as well. I am not sure if this shaver ever clipped a single hair off my face, but it is truly good at making my face break out. I would not recommend this shaver to anyone who has sensitive skin or thicker facial hair.</li>
    <li> After 4 months of trying to make this shaver work, I give up. I cannot get a close shave. It irritates my neck. If I skip a day shaving, it&#x27;s worse. I went back to my old noisy Braun 5775 with the broken trimmer. I now have an expensive 3 370 trimmer. I have used Braun exclusively for over 20 years. I may have to change</li>
    <li> This is a great shaver !!!    I use it every day.  And it&#x27;s close to fine !!!!</li>
    <li> I bought this over a year ago to replace a 12 year old Remington 856 rotary.  This Braun 370 cost 3 times as much and doesn&#x27;t shave as close as the Remington which has 5year old blades.  The clipper stopped working a few months after I got it.  I now use my old shaver and this one just sits as a backup. Maybe the foil shavers just don&#x27;t work for me. It is definitely heavy and sturdy. Easy to clean. But doesn&#x27;t shave well.</li>
    <li> love the self cleaning, no irritation, really like the grip, handy zip travel case great price, and quality enough said</li>
    <li> It was time to replace my old Braun shaver (12yrs old)... so I thought I&#x27;d try something new this time and went with a Norelco which seemed popular.  Unfortunately, on the first try it left my chin with a lot of nicks and burns.  OUCH!    Decided to go with another Braun and got this one.. WOW, it shaves even better than my old one.. close and smooth.  Love it!</li>
    <li> Had the Braun model 4775 (series 3, type 5742) shaver for about 2 years when it started to get really hot when plugged in, and failed to hold a charge.  Found replacement NiCd batteries (they&#x27;re a modified AA type), which worked, but I broke the cheap plastic trimmer assembly while trying to figure out how to remove the batteries.  The trimmer assembly is only available through authorized repair centers, and only comes as part of the entire housing.  (For those attempting to replace the batteries, do not remove the sliding trimmer assembly.  Instead, use a torx screwdriver to remove two screws in the cutter housing and two under plastic caps at the plug end of the handle, then use a #2 pencil eraser to push the electrical pins and the whole mechanism will slide out of its housing.)  So (1) batteries wear out, just like cutters, and they should be simple to replace; (2) there are no instructions for battery replacement -- one has to go to a repair shop; (3) the trimmer is held together with plastic pins that snap off when you open it.  All in all a sad case of planned obsolescence.  The shaver works well when running -- not as well as the 790cc that replaced it, but well enough.  (Yes, I rewarded Braun for their shoddy design by buying another one of their products.  Hope triumphs over experience again.)</li>
    <li> The 3 370 shaver glides over your face easily but that may be because it isn&#x27;t shaving that close.  My old Braun (model 5525) still shaves well but wasn&#x27;t charging for as long as it used to so I bought this model.    I don&#x27;t like the fact that it has to have its own unique cord.  I bet they charge a fortune if you lose it.  Shaver doesn&#x27;t have a plastic head cover so you need to put it back into its hard plastic case to protect the shaving head.  The case doesn&#x27;t have room for the cord so it needs to be packed separately when travelling.  Easy to clean with running water for the head and a shaver brush (not included - keep your old one) for the shaver itself.</li>
    <li> Overall very satisfied. My only issue is that if you don&#x27;t shave every day then it seems to have more difficulty with my neck area.</li>
    <li> This Braun shaver gives a good, close shave. It has met my expectations so far.  I had a German-made Braun in the 1980&#x27;s and had good experience with it.</li>
    <li> We&#x27;ve tried several Braun shavers. There isn&#x27;t a bad one in the bunch. They all work well, keep a charge better than most, and shave gently. On the minus side, the 370 doesn&#x27;t shave as close as some, which we found a bit disappointing. It is easy to clean, straight forward and simple. As with any shaver, you&#x27;ll want to replace the head and foil (integrated) periodically. Braun suggests every 18 months. That&#x27;s a good estimation as they can become dull after a few months. We use Remington&#x27;s Shaver Saver spray which lubricates and sharpens the blade/foil set to ensure longevity. It helps but with consistent use, you&#x27;ll still want to replace the blade/foil as we mention. You can wash them in soapy water to get the fine hairs out but not sure we&#x27;d recommend using the razor for wet shaves.   Our only gripe is the expensive purchase cost. If you&#x27;re going to spend that kind of money, look at the 5 or 7 series. Overall, it is a competent shaver but not stellar and does not perform as well as the high line Panasonic shavers.   Pros: Nicely packaged, quiet motor. Cons: Not as close a shaver as Braun&#x27;s more pricey models. Bottom line: Would recommend if you can get a good price. Shaver will last a long time.</li>
    <li> For some reason when I used this razor my face would break out in a rash. Also if I went 2 days without shaving it would pull my whisker hairs instead of cutting them as I moved the razor over my face. I am going back to my old faithful Remington shaver.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t seem to be the same quality as older Braun shavers. It shaves well with a new head. The trimmer just popped off one day.</li>
    <li> I have used electric shavers for almost 45 years and this is the best yet.  I started shopping because local stores no longer stock replacement foils and cutters for my old Braun 3000.      I chose this mid-range product because the 7 series is way too expensive, the 5 series tilting heads seem too gimmicky and their replacement cutters cost more than $40 even though the foils seem to be identical in design to those of the 3 series.    The Series 3 370 is bigger and heavier than my old shaver, but the heft feels good and the handle design and rubberized gripping surfaces on both sides make it easy to hold and control.     I almost bought a series 3 340, but opted for the 370 for just $30 more because of the \\&quot;lock\\&quot; switch that lowers one foil and the middle cutter to make it easier to get at the area under the nose.  I&#x27;m glad I did, because it really does work.    What surprised me most is how much more comfortable the shave is with the 370 than my old shaver with its single screen plus cutter bar. The independent movement of the foils and center cutter probably contributes to that comfort. The new foil design gives me a smoother shave as well, and the middle cutter does a good job of scavenging the odd long whisker that had evaded the old shaver. (At my age they&#x27;re not black any more, so they&#x27;re harder to spot and so may grow to some length before I see them.)     Especially in the neck area I notice that I&#x27;m shaving cleaner faster and with much less irritation than before.    The pop-up sideburn trimmer cuts well and rises high enough that it is easy to see where I&#x27;m trimming.    Because all of the series 3 models have an indicator light to show when the battery needs charging, I did not think it would matter that the 360 and 370 can be operated while the recharging cord is plugged in.  That little bonus feature did turn out to be valuable though, when I forgot to charge it up and the battery went dead just when I was in a rush to touch up 5 o&#x27;clock shadow before heading out to a meeting.  I did not have to wait several minutes for partial charge to get me through a cordless shave; just plugged in, finished  my shave and headed out the door.    Another bonus is that the Series 3 370 is much quieter than the old shaver.    The only negative I have noticed is that this model comes with a nice zippered hard case, but there is no room for the cord in it, just the shaver.      By the way, the all-black 360 model is functionally identical, but comes with no case. Instead, it has a plastic snap-on foil protector that also shields the on/off button so it can&#x27;t get turned on in your shaving kit while traveling. For some strange reason, the 360 model costs $20 more than the 370.  Go figure.      Final note:  There is another Series 3 370 model listed for less money on Amazon, but it is an older design with different cutters and is not featured among current models on Braun&#x27;s web site.</li>
    <li> The Series 3 370 was the third Braun shaver that I purchased within one month. The first two shavers, which I quickly returned, were Series 3 340 models that had a major defect. At least a couple times a week, the shaver head would pop off while shaving. I gave up on the Series 3 340 shaver and decided to try the Series 3 370. The Braun 370 model is much improved vs. the 340 and I have only had the head pop off once during the last 30 days. The Braun Series 3 370 is a good basic shaver that gets the job done without any major issues.</li>
    <li> Have had this shaver for over a month now and it&#x27;s probably the best one I&#x27;ve ever owned.  btw - I also had the previous model 370 for two years and the new one is definitely much better: quieter, smoother, and gives a faster shave.  One minor knock is that it doesn&#x27;t work too well on long neck hairs (maybe a little better than the old model in this regard, but not by much). On that basis I actually would have rated it 4.5 stars if the rating system allowed for that.      Note that this shaver is especially good if you&#x27;re prone to ingrown whiskers/razor bumps like I am. The trade-off is that it doesn&#x27;t shave quite as close as other brands, such as Norelco, but the latter always gave me lots of ingrown whiskers. As far as I&#x27;m concerned it shaves plenty close enough and overall is a pleasure to use.  It&#x27;s also very easy to clean by simply rinsing under the tap.  I did not get the cleaning/recharge station - which seems like an unneccessary extra cost.</li>
    <li> This shaver is easy to handle and is very quiet but the quality of the shave leaves a lot to be desired.  Several older Braun models did a better job and that is why I decided to buy this new razor.  It quickly goes from the full charge to a weaker charge but it is still new and may take numerous recharge cycles to get a longer full charge.  One must constantly go back and forth over the same part of the face to get a clean shave.  My MS2 390 Remington razor at $20 less is much louder but does a quicker job.  However this Braun is easier to clean than the Remington.  Even an older Panasonic model shaved closer when it was new.  Amazon had a good price and was very prompt with the delivery.   ......3/3/10</li>
    <li> Had to finally retire my Series 6500 and am very happy with its replacement.    It is quieter and more comfortable. I am really pleased with the way it holds a charge. 5 days doing both face and scalp is a heavy load! Recharges in a flash.    Being able to wash it out still seems strange, but I&#x27;ll get over it.</li>
    <li> Have only had the shaver one month but it seems to work quite well.  Still does not always cut the whiskers that choose to grow laying down!  The trimmer could be more aggressive.  Was not sure it was even working the first time I used the trimmer.  A plastic cover for the shaving head seems like it would be a good idea to better protect the head.  It is a lot quieter than my past Remmington shaver.</li>
    <li> I needed a replacement for my old worn-out Braun. I read all the reviews and selected this one. I am very pleased with it. The floating heads do a better job in less time than my old one and it&#x27;s impossible to get a \\&quot;razor burn\\&quot;. Best electric shaver yet - and I&#x27;ve been using them for 50 years.</li>
    <li> Satisfied with this shaver - battery life is great, shave is close.  Since I&#x27;m used to a rotary shaver, still learning best technique for shaving with this one.</li>
    <li> After 2 months and few days the trimmer stops working due to a broken small part.&lt;br /&gt;I would not advise it to anyone.</li>
    <li> I purchased this razor for my \\&quot;Fiance\\&quot; for \\&quot;Christmas\\&quot;. He&#x27;s very meticulous. He loves it. He says it&#x27;s so fast and so close that he can hardly believe it.    His face feels like a \\&quot;baby&#x27;s\\&quot; behind. Ha    He recommends  it to anyone that wants a perfect shave and a charge in \\&quot;45\\&quot; minutes.  Perfect razor..  C.Cordova</li>
    <li> This shaver works very well. I needn&#x27;t trip my longer hair with trimmer. The center cutter blade can cut long hair, and the two other cut short hair. It shave very close to your skin.</li>
    <li> Nice shave, especially for a second shave of the day before evening meetings, going out to dinner, etc.  Also greast as a weekend substitute for my usual Mach 3 blade shave.  Reasonably close shave, easy to handle, nice features, and VERY QUIET compared to all my previous electrics.  I would definitely purchase this one again.</li>
    <li> I have used rotary head electric shavers for past 10 years, mostly Norelco, and once Remington. They were good in most part, but always found difficult to get close shave in neck areas. I was really getting tired of missing hairs on neck even after spending long time going back and forth in the area. It was causing irritation, and looking awkward at work. I purchased three Norelco rotary shavers in last three years. I was really considering going back to razor, and wet shave, but wasn&#x27;t quite convinced yet.    After reading some reviews decided to try a foil shaver.  Braun seems to have good reputation, and have a good line of shavers to choose from, and at the same time I didn&#x27;t want to pay arms and legs for a shaver.  After reading some, I opted to go with Braun Series 3 370 model.  It arrived in mail last Thursday, and I have been shaving with it since. I noticed a difference in shave immediately, I am getting closer shave especially on my neck areas. There are hardly any hair missed after a shave,  its smooth, and most of all it does not take forever to shave every morning.  I recall going over and over with my rotary shaver, and felt frustrated to find some areas just could not be shaved closely.  It seems the foil shaver from Braun is working for me, and it feels good to rub my hand over face after a shave to find smooth face without stubble or missed hairs. I have ordered another one for my travel need from Amazon today.  There are a few things I would suggest Braun to consider. Providing a case that can carry the shaver and charging cord would be great. Also the shaver is noisier then my rotary shaver, less noise would be welcome.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had two previous Braun shavers, both rather inexpensive, but quite satisfactory models.  The batteries on my 4765 finally almost wore out, so I bought this Series 3 - 370 as a birthday present replacement for myself.  It&#x27;s GREAT!  Incredibly smooth, quiet, and highly efficient, even at shaving (without even any special attention) the \\&quot;stubborn\\&quot; spot on my neck that has been very difficult to shave for years.    Keep in mind that I&#x27;ve only used basic model shavers in the past, so I can&#x27;t compare it to a \\&quot;top-end\\&quot;, expensive shaver, but the improvement over my previous shavers is tremendous.</li>
    <li> I bought this shaver for my 91 year old dad. It&#x27;s the best shave he&#x27;s ever had, and that&#x27;s a lot of years by which to judge!</li>
    <li> Had my other Braun electric shaver for years and had to finally update and purchase this model. I bought this model because it offered a hair trimmer as well as a good close shave. I have been using it for 3 weeks and I am very pleased with its performance.</li>
    <li> I had to buy four Series 3 32S cassettes to use as replacement shaver head cassettes about every 18 months. This should have been offered as a product I could use when I bought the Braun Se[[ASIN:B0006ZM4LC Braun Series 3 370 Men&#x27;s Shaver]]riss 3 370 Shaver.</li>
    <li> I have developed some medical problems and it became difficult to shave in the bathroom.  I knew that electric would solve my problem.  After three weeks of shaving three or four times a week in the dining room I&#x27;m thrilled with the Braun.  I don&#x27;t require a \\&quot;super close\\&quot; shave but it does very well.  I go with \\&quot;dry\\&quot; cleaning and I find it convenient to tap the hair out of the body and the cutting head.  My compliments to the chef, Mr. Braun.</li>
    <li> The razor arrived on time and in good condition.  It replaces a similiar Braun razor I&#x27;ve had for years.  It is a bit larger and makes more noise, but has improved features such as battery status LED&#x27;s.  It performs as expected.  I recommend it.</li>
    <li> Real close shave head smooth as a babys ass. Battery life needs to be a bit longer. Probably get 3-4 shaves before it needs charging. Upside its full charged in 45 mins.</li>
    <li> Piece of Chinese junk.Does not shave close even after going over and over. Price went way down after my purchase. These used to be made in Germany.</li>
    <li> This is one POS.  It cost alot and cuts very little.  I have to go over and over and over and over and it still does not cut the beard hair.  My Old Norelco with a blade I have never replaced after 10 years does a better job this this.    If you are going to by an electric razor get a Norelco do not waist your money on this Piece of S#*!</li>
    <li> Works great, glad I bought it. Have to trim the neck hairs sometime afterwards but overall, it&#x27;s a great product at a great price. I would highly recommend. I am still on my first charge and I bought the thing in late December!</li>
    <li> I was not impressed with the performance of this razor.  I&#x27;d like it more if it was half the price but for $100 I definitely expected a better shave.  I have a 5 year old Norelco that was around the same price and it gave me an identical shave as this newer Braun.  If I was going to spend a lot of money on a razor I&#x27;d get the 5 series or the 7 series.  I bought this one because it didn&#x27;t come with that cheap little automatic washing doc.  That turns me off from the Braun line.  All in all it&#x27;s a good razor, but prices too high for its overall performance.</li>
    <li> This was a gift for my son, to replace a 17-year-old Braun that I also bought him.  I read the reviews for many models and chose this one based on the positive reviews, price, and ease of use.  My son tells me he&#x27;s very pleased with his new gift.</li>
    <li> I love this shaver.  I replaced my Braun 5720 and hoped I was getting a comprable shaver but this one is much better.  I love the upper lip extension, it&#x27;s quiet and hold a charge much longet than the 5720.  Overal it&#x27;s the best shaver I&#x27;ve owned.</li>
    <li> Shaver is one of the best I have used in a long time.  Greatly improved over thier last model.  Would purchase again.</li>
    <li> This is my third Braun shaver and by far the best.  I get a fast close shave with little effort effort.</li>
    <li> This product is really awesome. Braun Series 3 370 is comfortable and very close shave. I would like to recommend this product to my firends.</li>
    <li> I wish I would have bought this shaver first, I have always used razors all my life until a bought \\&quot;X\\&quot; brand electric shaver for less money and was not happy with the shaver. After checking out all the reviews on the Braun shavers I desided on this model and am very pleased with it, I get a closer shave with the Braun then I was getting with the razors!  Bob</li>
    <li> I had been shaving with blades for 15 years prior to getting this shaver.  I am quite impressed with it.  It shaves as close as a blade, without the blood.  I like that it gets the difficult hairs on my neck without too much fuss.  My previous electric shavers, admittedly old tech, could never shave acceptably close, and would leave long neck hairs even after repeated passes.  It is easy to clean this as well, since you can rinse it off under the faucet.  I don&#x27;t see the point of those cleaning baths for fancier shavers, since this is easy and quick.  The battery (NiMH) holds a charge well, and even if it does run out you can just plug the shaver in and it will work fine.  My only gripe is that it is a little big for my taste; it&#x27;s somewhat of a handful.  But anything smaller probably would have trouble with power, so it&#x27;s better this way, I guess.</li>
    <li> I received the Braun Series 3 370 Shaver and it is a joy to use, fast and more comfortable then my old shaver.  I can get a weeks worth of shaving on one charge and then charge it over night and ready for another week.  Easy to clean and should last a long time.  Braun is the best.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been a devoted Braun shaver fan for 30 years, but this shaver have made me switch.  What a worthless shaver.  Fully charged it will start sagging after 2 minutes of shaving.  The only way I can shave with this one is with the cord attached.  The quality feels cheap, the plastic is brittle.  The hair trim peace broke after 6 months.  The shave is not close at all, and you have to really work at it to get a decent shave.  After 1 year struggling with this one, I bought a Panasonic one instead.  What a difference.  A smooth shave, and a battery that keeps the charge. So much for German engineering. What a disappointment.</li>
    <li> I bought this razor to replace a Braun 4700 Series that could only hold a charge for a few days.  After the initial charge I find that I am getting about 2 weeks of shaving on each charge.  The shave is close, important because I have a heavy beard.  I am not comfortable yet with the trimmer because I was used to the ease of trimming with my old Braun. So, it&#x27;s so far so good!</li>
    <li> Bought this to replace my old Remington. Still using the old Remington. This Braun doesn&#x27;t cut my facial hair no matter how short it is. It sure is good at pulling my hair our though, and giving me razor burn. If my wife didn&#x27;t buy it for me as a gift I would&#x27;ve smashed it on the counter the 10th time it pulled my hair out. P.O.S.! Expensive P.O.S. Don&#x27;t buy it.</li>
    <li> Women&#x27;s shavers just don&#x27;t work as well as men&#x27;s seem to, probably because men demand a better product, and have grittier stubble to remove on a regular basis.  This shaver works well on my legs, and that&#x27;s what I had hoped.</li>
    <li> I bought this model to replace an older Braun electric shaver that was having battery issues.  While this newer model is very quiet and cuts very effectively, it has one major design flaw.  When I try to shave under my jaw or chin, the head pops off - Very annoying.  I have to hold the head on to make sure that it doesn&#x27;t come off, especially since I&#x27;ve stabbed myself with the pins that are exposed when the head is off.    Other than this design defect, it&#x27;s a great shaver, including a very sharp trimming cutter.</li>
    <li> ... which I&#x27;m going to get repaired.    In short, the problem with this shaver is a head that&#x27;s too wide to do the job, at least for my face. Sure, it&#x27;s great that they have a switch to drop 2 of the 3 blades, but on my shaver that feature stopped working well after a couple of weeks. It took me several weeks of use to come to this conclusion. It worked OK on the short stubble but never really got the longer ones w/o a couple of careful swipes. And I liked it initially, but that feeling didn&#x27;t last.</li>
    <li> The screen on this shaver broke after only 7 months of use.  The older Braun shaver I had lasted 9 years without any problems, so this one was a big disappointment.</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with the Braun shaver, but maybe it is because I replaced an aging Norelco. It is faster, shaves faster, cleaner.  and more thorough than before..[[ASIN:B0020MMCB6 Braun Series 3 370 Men&#x27;s Shaver]] It was received 2 days sooner than promised.  Thanx</li>
    <li> This replaces a Braun 4775 that I&#x27;ve used every day for the last 5 years.  The only reason it was replaced was because the battery would no longer hold a charge.&lt;br /&gt;This Series 3 370 shaver is a big improvement over the 4775 in every respect.  It is quieter, lighter, and  because it&#x27;s handle is narrower it is easier to hold and to handle.  The best part is that with the floating head, it shaves closer, easier, more comfortably and more quickly than the 4775.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m very pleased and would purchase this item again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this shaver for over 6 months.  I have relatively thick hair and I don&#x27;t shave everyday but when I do, it takes a very long time to shave with this product... guess I should have spent more money to go with the 5 or 7 series.  Even after multiple passes on the same area of my face, this shaver often cannot cut some of the hairs on my neck and face.  If money was no object, I would&#x27;ve thrown this out pretty quickly, but alas, I am stuck with this for a while.</li>
    <li> This is an incredible electric shaver! It is the 5th I have purchased in the past 20 years, and by far the best. My last one was a Braun 5770 that needed new foil &amp; cutters, and the battery was beginning to slow down, so I decided to get a new shaver instead. My whiskers are heavier than average, but I can hardly feel the shaver on my face. I almost had to check to see if it was actually turned on. The lock for one side of the foil works very well when shaving the mustache area under the nose. Everything about this Series 3 model 370 is better than my previous 5000 series - the shaver head is more comfortable, the battery is Nickle Metal Hydride (not Ni-Cad), and the motor is smoother and quieter. And as always, Amazon&#x27;s pricing is better than local stores.</li>
    <li> i purchased this product to replace a 10yr old braun shaver.  the new one weighed half of what the old one was.  most of the parts were plastic.  the new bruan shaver was very quiet and shaved so much smoother than the old one.  the shave of the new one was much closer and so much easier on my skin than the old one.  i feel at this point the new braun will be a much better purchase to replace your older one.  i like how it has performed as of now and would recommend it to others to purchase it.</li>
    <li> This is the best electric razor I have ever used! A nice, smoothe shave and very easy to use--------much better than the Norelco it replaced. I understand the battery can be replaced when needed (unlike Norelco) so you do not have to throw away the razor when it runs down.</li>
    <li> I have owned Braun shavers for the past 15 years and have been very happy with their performances.  I had an 8-year-old Braun 7505 that worked well, but needed a new cutter and foil.  I also started shaving my head, and wanted 2 identical shavers to use (I use one in each hand).  I decided to apply the $25-30 for the new cutter/foil to buying 2 brand new 370 shavers, hoping that improvements had been made over the past few years.    I was wrong.  I really tried to like this shaver, but it is clearly inferior to the 7000 series (7505, 7526, 7680, etc.) in virtually all areas.    -The shave itself is not as close or comfortable than the 7000 series.  Be prepared to go over and over and over the same area of skin, and even then, you won&#x27;t get everything.  -The travel case is a joke, it fits the shaver but that&#x27;s all; no room for the charger.  -The cleaning brush is another joke, it is about 1/2 inch wide and about 3/4 inch long.  Why they even bothered to design and manufacture this miniature toy brush (suitable for a doll house maybe) is beyond me.  -The shaving head is WAY over-engineered and it is not possible to clean the cutters or foil with a brush--you can only run it under water or bang it on the sink to knock out whatever hairs you can.    I ended up donating two my new 370 shavers to Goodwill.  I went back to my 7505 (thank god I hadn&#x27;t sold it or given it away) and I bought another 7505 on Ebay.  I purchased two new cutters/foils for my two 7505 shavers and now I&#x27;m happy!  What a relief!  I should have done this in the first place, but again, I had hoped that the new Brauns were improved.    Although Braun is no longer producing them, you can buy 7000 series Brauns from a variety of places online.  At shaveroutlet dot com, you can buy a brand new 7680 body for $60, add a cutter, foil, and charging cord, and you&#x27;re good to go.  They have other parts too (carrying cases, cleaning brushes, batteries, motor drives, etc.)  Other sites for Braun shavers and partsare marbeck dot com, buyitnow64 dot stores dot yahoo dot net, and theessentials dot com.    I understand that Braun was bought out by someone else, and that may explain why their new stuff (the 370 anyway) is not as good as their original stuff.</li>
    <li> This product is everything its advertised to be.    I get good close shaves with it and 1 charge lasts 7-8 shaves.     It is vastly superior to the Remington foil razor I had been using before.    Don&#x27;t buy Remington, this is a much much better shave and I recommend it</li>
    <li> I ordered this particular shaver because of the \\&quot;long whisker trimmer\\&quot; feature.  They did not have this model and offered to send another model without the feature I wanted.  I declined and went to another site and ordered the model I wanted.</li>
    <li> This shaver is well designed and shaves close.  It&#x27;s great to be able to get it clean by simply putting it under running water.&lt;br /&gt;Great product at reasonable price.</li>
    <li> I just recieved this the other day and I love it. I was replacing me Braun 8985 that I was OK with, I&#x27;m picky and I&#x27;ve tried several other brands but the Braun always worked best for me. I like this model better because it does shave closer and smoother that my previuos model. Also its alot easier to clean under hot water as opposed to the clean and charge system. I&#x27;ve tried it once in the shower also with a bit of shaving gel and it did a pretty good job also. I did buy the 340 model about a week before at WalMart and it shaved well, but the shave head kept popping off numerous times, I don&#x27;t know if it was defective or not but I did return it. I then saw this model on Amazon for 9$ more that the 340 model and it is a good improvement with the lock position for mustache shaving and the battery level indicator. The 370 also came with a carry case that I use alot when I&#x27;m on the road.</li>
    <li> This new Braun shaver works well.  I had been using a Braun 6520 razor that was about 8 or more years old, whose battery was gradually failing.  I doubt that the new razor works any better than the old one did when new.  The indicator lights which show approximate state of battery charge are a good addition to this new shaver.</li>
    <li> Got a much closer shave with my previous shaving method, IE (Gillette Sensor, double blade). Ended up sending the Braun shaver back under braun&#x27;s 30 day MBG \\&quot;money Back Guarantee\\&quot;! I&#x27;m supposed to get a check back from Braun for a full refund sometime with ten weeks of sending the Braun Series 3 370 Men&#x27;s Shaver back to the company. Its been about three weeks now, and still waiting for a check.</li>
    <li> UPDATE 11/28/2011:  Below is my original review but I decided to post this update as I&#x27;ve had a major problem with this shaver in the three months that I&#x27;ve used it.  Other reviewers have noted this particular issue to be a problem as well so please be aware this is not simply a fluke in the unit I purchased.  The problem is that the head of the shaver is designed to be removed in order to clean the blades.  This seems to make sense, except that after three months of use, I find that applying any pressure to the razor now causes the head to spontaneously pop off.  This results not only in the hair clippings to spill all over, but if you&#x27;re really unlucky, the blades could get caught on your facial hair.  This seems like a very dangerous design flaw to say the least, and it renders the razor nearly unusable since you have to constantly fear the head flying off.  Please be wary before purachasing this product.  ---------------  This shaver is the first I&#x27;ve used in what I consider the &#x27;higher end&#x27; category (my previous shaver was a $30 Wahl shaver with zero features).  While the Braun is more comfortable than my old shaver, and has some really nice features, it still falls short exactly where the Wahl shaver fell short - it can&#x27;t get to difficult angles like under my nose and the chin line (despite there being a couple of features specifically for this function).  Pros:  -Comfortable, appeared to adjust well to the contours of my face in most spots  -Close shave (relative to my old shaver)  -Price (this is one of the cheaper shavers of this category)  -Ability to shave while the shaver is plugged in (this is a big one for me because I always forget to charge things)  -Extra features such as the &#x27;lock&#x27; that allows a more narror portion of the shaver to only be active when getting to tough spots like under the nose.  Again, while I list this as a &#x27;pro&#x27;, it&#x27;s still wasn&#x27;t accurate enough so I had to clean up with a razor.  Another feature I liked was the sideburn trimmerthat allows another arm to come up and shave the sideburns more easily than with the normal shaver setting.  Cons:  -Couldn&#x27;t get under my nose and also left some stray hairs along my chin line.  I&#x27;m sure this isn&#x27;t a big deal to some people (either because their face shape will make it easier to use or because they don&#x27;t care about stray hairs), but to me this was a big miss.  If you&#x27;re using a shaver you ideally do not want to have to use a razor to clean up; if that&#x27;s the case you might as well just stick to a razor.  Overall I would still recommend this shaver given the price point and the quality.  Just keep in mind you may need to keep your razor around (and since I have very limited experience with shavers, please take this review with a grain of salt - maybe there isn&#x27;t a shaver out there that can allow you to get rid of your razor).</li>
    <li> I received my Braun shaver and charged it following the instructions. The shave was so-so and nothing to write home about. More infuriating was the inability to register this piece of junk on their website. Following the link [...] braun.com/register and an insert for a contest [...] braun.com/win resulted in screens advertising the product but no where to register the shaver. I believe this is because they don&#x27;t want you to register so that when you try to get service or return the product they have no records. I&#x27;ll be sharing this information with the NYS Attorney General as I believe it is in violation of fair advertising and a blatant attempt to disable registration of their poor products. Enough said....yes, I&#x27;m not happy and Braun sucks!</li>
    <li> Braun made a number of improvements with this shaver, compared to my previous Braun model.  The ergonomics are better because the shaver head is angled from the body, similar to a safety razor, and the sides of the body are rubberized for a better grip.  They&#x27;ve also improved the charge indicator system with LEDs that tell you how many more shaves you might expect before recharging.  The long-hair trimmer is much more usable than my previous Braun, and the shaver case is better (my previous model had a cheap plastic case).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few observations: I get better results by pushing the shaver up rather than pulling it up.  You will want to replace the shaver head cassete at least every 12 months.  (Braun mentions 18 months in their manual.)  I used the first cassete for 10 months, but have decided that replacing it after six months is worth it for the closest, fastest shave.</li>
    <li> Great shaver, only negative comment is that the carrying case doesn&#x27;t have a spot for the charger or the cleaning brush.</li>
    <li> I ordered this shaver for my husband, who has had a stroke. Works OK but very disappointed because the blade on the long hair trimmer keeps falling off. Have only had it a few months. Would not buy this again.</li>
    <li> This Braun Shaver is without a doubt the best electric shaver I have ever used.  It is comfortable and gives a very close shave.  I love the feature that adjusts the shaving head so you can get closer under the nose.  The recharge time is short and lasts for the better part of a week.</li>
    <li> I bought it for my dad but he could not shave with it so I had to return it.The seller was excellent but the product did not work.I bought it because I thought Braun made good products but not this razor.</li>
    <li> I had a Series 5 for several years until the tabs holding the head wore down.  I like the Series 3 I bought in November 2011 considerably better.  It has a solid feel and lays well in your hand. It shaves closer than any of the half dozen or so electric razors I have owned for decades (Norelco, Schick, Remington).  I have a beard which cuts down on time per shave but I still have to shave cheeks and neck, where it does a smoother job with less irritation than any other.  Even on the first charge, the battery has lasted more than a month without re-charging. The head attaches to the body differently and that should solve the tab wear problem.  The trimmer alone makes this razor great.  Instead of the usual straight extension, it cuts at a 90 degree angle with respect to the razor&#x27;s body, which makes it incredibly better and easier to use especially on the lower end of the mustache next to the lips and below the temples.  The razor is not in the way of your line of vision when you trim!  In the past I also had to use a Wahl clipper as well - I no longer use it.  About the only thing I liked better about the old Braun was its charger stand.</li>
    <li> I been using a Braun model 5414 since the late 70&#x27;s.  This model survive the many years of use until the battery just gave out.  That was a 30 year model.  Finally I had to get a new one and was I surprised.  Much quieter, easy shaving and cleaning.  This shaver cuts well with my light beard. If your hair is thicker it may atake a secord or third pass to get it all. The quietness is great. I can carry a conversation with my SO and actually hear every word now. Overall this is an easy to clean, quiet shaver that does a good job.  Also I searched around for the best price. I bought this one from Amazon.</li>
    <li> I purchased this razor in August 2010 and I have been very satisfied since starting to use it.  I would have given it 5 stars but I really believe that only a regular razor deserves such a rating.  I have used micro-screen and rotating shaver head razors and they do not even come close to giving the shave produced by the Braun shaver.  In addition, this razor is quieter than others I have used.  I like the fact that you can plug in the razor and use it if you let the charge get too low.  I like the ability to &#x27;lock&#x27; the shaver head as this allows for a smoother shave at those hard to get to places. The only thing I miss, and this is a very minor issue, is a plastic shaver head cover.  Yes, the razor comes with a hard case to store it in when traveling, but I just like the idea of having something protecting the head when the razor is just sitting on the counter.  I highly recommend this electric razor and only wish I had switched to Braun many years ago.</li>
    <li> Good smooth shave and easy to use.  Charges quickly and holds the charge well.  Just wish there was a blade guard for travel and the carrying pouch was a bit larger to hold both the shaver and the charging cord.  Overall great product.</li>
    <li> About one year ago I bought this razor and a Remington MS2 390 together from Amazon. This razor never has shaved as well or as quickly as the Remington, even when I installed new blades and screens.</li>
    <li> I would give it zero stars if I could! I bought this shaver to replace my 15 year old Remington MS2 200 (which was still working btw). The integrated cutter on the Braun fell apart after only three to four shaves. What a P.O.C.! The reason why I replaced the razor in the first place was because my old one would not hold a charge for very long anymore. Ultimately, I just ended up buying a good old Remington (same model). Better to stick with what you know works. I am sure my new Remington MS2 200 will give me many years of good service, as it had in the passed.</li>
    <li> The shave is still the best, the closest.  I think it is the best made.  I did not need the fancy cleaning machine etc, just wanted the best shave that will last.  The only minor issue that I have is the slide up cutter can get in your way a bit, when shaving under your nose.  You just need to get used to it.  Overall, a great shaver so far.</li>
    <li> I had a Braun flex head shaver for over 20 years and was quite happy with it.  Unfortunately, it started to wear out and became very noisy.  The 370 is remarkably quiet -- a real pleasure.  It shaves well and the controls are easy to use.  The indicators for charging and power reserve are clear.  It&#x27;s also easy to clean by rinsing it under the water tap.  The only improvement I would make is to improve the ability to grip the shaver foil (head) so it could be tapped against the sink to shake out shaving debris.  As designed, it&#x27;s quite slippery making it a challenge to hold on to.</li>
    <li> Dont bother on this cheap china made product. lots of tug and pull after just a few months. the fluid that cleans the razor heads leak. the blade that edge the sideburns broke on mine after only 7 months and now the razor wont clean or charge. priced way too high for something very poorly made. take my advice and pass on this product!!</li>
    <li> I am not fully agree with all advantages indicated above, but I excited with battery capacity. I charge it only very 10-15 days, which is very suitable when you are in a trip - there is no necessity to carry adapter anymore + it has very cosy case.</li>
    <li> New Series 3 370 works excellent as always. This is the 4th Braun I have used over the last 35 years. Prices always seem high, but they are the only manufacturer I have every found that shaves without causing in-grown hairs</li>
    <li> I purchased the 370 as a birthday present to myself. I used an electric shaver when I was in my 20s and didn&#x27;t have much of a beard. Now I&#x27;m in my 50s and can still get away with shaving with a razor every other day. I wanted to treat myself to an easier morning routine and chose the 370 after a lot of research and had some high expectations for a quick, close shave.  I&#x27;ve been using for about a year now and am underwhelmed in the performance.  On a positive side, it is well constructed and sturdy with decent battery life. The negative is that it simply doesn&#x27;t shave close nor quick.  It took about a month for my face to become accustomed to using electric again (some Nivea skin balm helped). My facial skin may not be as tight as when I was younger, but is by no means sagging but I have to pull the skin as tight as possible before multiple passes to get any results. I&#x27;m meticulous about keeping the unit clean and oiled and recharge weekly.  It still takes me almost as long to shave as it did with a razor. In fact, I still treat myself to a razor shave on weekends.  Needless to say, I am disappointed with this purchase and wish I had tried a less expensive rotary instead.  Will probably pass this onto my teenage son at some point and go back to using a razor exclusively.</li>
    <li> I recently purchased this shaver for ~$70, and after only 2 weeks, I can definitely say that I am never going back to my Mach 3 and shaving cream again.  I no longer have any razor-burn, no more ingrown hairs around my jaw line, and I get a much closer shave than ever before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll start by saying that I&#x27;m a guy w/ relatively thin and patchy facial hair... I could grow a full goatee, I couldn&#x27;t grow a full beard if I tried.  Shaving with a razor every day almost wasn&#x27;t worth it b/c my facial hair is only noticeable if I let it grow for more than a day.  I did a lot of research, and this shaver kept coming up.  I chose it because of: 1) the price; 2) the reviews; 3) the size (I saw one in Target before I bought it); and 4) the features (see below).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The intricate foil pattern works well to catch most hairs in 1 pass... the neck and jaw line areas seem to usually take 2 to 3 passes, but again, it still gets MUCH closer than a 3-blade, or even 5-blade razor does.  The packaging says that you should shave BEFORE you wash your face, but I always shave after I take a shower and I don&#x27;t see how the shave could be easier or get any closer.  I use it EVERY DAY, which may be why I have had success with it thus far... foil shavers (from what I understand) don&#x27;t get long hairs very well, which I could see happening with this shaver.  There is the \\&quot;long-hair blade\\&quot; in the middle of the 2 foils that might be a saving grace, but I don&#x27;t think it would catch them very well in comparison to a razor.  Long story short, this razor may not be right for you if you don&#x27;t plan to shave every single day (or at least every other).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The unit is very easy to clean, and doesn&#x27;t get jammed up w/ hair like some shavers do.  I had a small electric razor (foil type) a while back that looked like a pepper shaker after a couple of days, forcing me to clean it w/ alcohol and a brush far too often.  Just tap it upside-down against the sink and about 90% of the hair particles come out, then take the head off (easily removed) and tap it with the blades facing up and the rest come out.  I also spray mine w/ lube/sanitizer spray every couple of days to keep it clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some of the features that I particularly like (that aren&#x27;t mentioned in the specifications) are: 1) the fact that there is a switch that lowers the 1st foil and the middle long-hair cutter so that you can get to your upper lip easier; and 2) there is a side-burn trimmer on the back of the shaver that you can click up when you need it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all, this is a great shaver, and a great price to boot!  I hope this review helps in your decision!</li>
    <li> This is the best electric shaver I have ever had and I have used electric shavers for the past 65 years. I have a tough beard--had to shave twice a day in the Army to avoid problems. After about 2 shaves with this shaver I had adjusted my shaving to the head angle for it, and it has given great shaves ever since.  Using the correct technique, this shaver picks up the stray whiskers I had to go back for before.  I also like the way the sideburn trimmer works.  My previous ones always were oriented for use in the same direction as shaving. I have always used foil type shavers, so I could not compare this one to rotary shavers.  I shave daily and it keeps a charge for over a week.  Now if the foil and cutter last a good while, it is all I would ask for.    Now for the negatives.  They don&#x27;t relate to the shaver or the quality of shave.  I would prefer a better case and maybe a guard for the foil.  My last shaver was also a Braun and I preferred the hard plastic case that came with it.</li>
    <li> Purchased razor on 4/5/2012 from Amazon. All the Braun literature recommended the head should be replaced in 18 months. I had to repace the twice in less than 12 months. The first head was replaced on 10/14/12 and the second head on 9/15/13. In both cases the screen wore away exposing the blades to the skin. It should be noted that the razor was cleaned and oiled per Braun recommendations. Contacted Braun on 9/15/13 and explained the problem to CSA, she became defensive and stated that the heads should be replaced between 9 months and 18 months even though all the literature stated 18 months. There is even a reminder light that comes on after 18 months of use. After about 30 minutes of back and forth the CSA agreed to send a replacement head free of charge, which is the only reason the razor didn&#x27;t get a 1 star rating. I was never happy with shave that I got from the Braun and have replaced it with a Norelco 803 that I am very happy with, I had used Norelcos in the past with no problems and should have stayed with Norelco. I would not recommend this razor or the new version because of the head issues.</li>
    <li> Braun series 3 370 shaver. I purchased this shaver in June of 2010. I have a light beard and use a shaving oil after washing my face. Had to replace the new head the following year in June 2011.  Now the replacement head needs to be replaced in 9 months.  Not acceptable with the replacement cost equal to 40/50% the price of a new shaver&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shaver must be run over your face multiple times for a smooth shave and still doesn&#x27;t shave the neck area well. I have to use the trimmer function daily under my neck.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cleaning system is bulky and expensive to use every 4 days.</li>
    <li> Still looking for electric shaver nirvana. Pros: Trimmer, fast recharge, cleaning solution just ok [added \\&quot;4711\\&quot; for better aroma], trimmer perfect for trimming wife&#x27;s hair in shower, holds charge forever, feels good in either hand; Cons: Head speed is slow, requiring multiple passes to cut this Cowboy&#x27;s stubble if more than three days. Wish the head speed was faster.</li>
    <li> I received my 370 as a father&#x27;s day/birthday gift from my girls. I&#x27;ve had a rotary for 19 years and have only replaced the blades once and it still cuts closer and faster than the 370. I&#x27;ve given it the benefit of the doubt and have continued to try it as the instructions say my beard needs to be trained. 9 times out of 10 I end up grabbing my old rotary as it takes the 370 too long to get the job done if ever. If it&#x27;s not fully charged it doesn&#x27;t even begin to cut. I am not impressed and will never own another.</li>
    <li> I was very excited to receive this razor in the mail. First, it runs through my facial hair like a beast. It isn&#x27;t lightening fast, but it sure does get the job done.  I rarely ever use the \\&quot;lock\\&quot; switch to pop down all trimmers except the front one.  The battery life is decent, and will last about a week with an average of about one or two shaves per day.  I really like the pop out trimmer, and am disappointed that it was hardly advertised. It is very large, and is designed in such a way that it is quick and easy to use.   I wouldn&#x27;t suggest cleaning this shaver out with soap and water, as it often causes it to become very un-lubricated. Braun includes what they call \\&quot;formula oil\\&quot; to remedy this, but the bottle is tiny and I&#x27;ve already used half of mine. So instead, I&#x27;ve been cleaning it by banging the head (which includes both the trimmers and the foils) against my sink, and then using the small brush to clean out the rest.  I wish this shaver would be able to cut longer hairs. Even with the middle trimmer, it still misses the tricky, flat-laying hairs on my neck. Oh well, no shaver is perfect I guess. I can just pop out the trimmer and use it to snag those hairs. But I still wish that this was the shaver that would be able to get it all, no matter how long the hairs were. Sometimes, if I have a long beard, I even return to a wet shave with a Gillette razor because that actually would take less time than the Braun.   Yet all in all I&#x27;m satisfied with this shaver even if I have my gripes.</li>
    <li> I am 73 years of age, had several electric shavers (including Braun), however, this is by far the best one yet.  It shaves closer, is quieter, and I couldn&#x27;t ask for a better one.</li>
    <li> Fast and power, are the words that I will use for this Braun Shaver, the time of charge is quick, the battery life is longer than others, with a normal maintenance the foil have a longer life, and the most important, if you have a irritable skin, this will fit you because the skin after shave will be without irritation.</li>
    <li> I ordered a electric razor and expected delivery in 5-7 days only to find out that it was just shipped after 6 days and may arrive after 15 days waiting.  I find this service to be unacceptable and will think twice about ordering from Amazon again.  Sorry, but service is everything.</li>
    <li> I used a rotary shaver for decades, and got tired of having to virtually sand the whiskers off in tight places. This shaver is effortless, smooth and comfortable. Both the blade retractor (for under the nose, etc) and the trimmer are easy to use and work well. I attribute the comfort to the sharpness of the three shaving heads and the angle.  Yes, I could have bought the self-cleaning model for a $100 more, but I&#x27;m willing to take 3 seconds to remove the head and run water over both the head and the shaver (it&#x27;s waterproof).   Great buy, good shaver.  One question is the battery life. The manual says 45 mins of shaving on a full charge, and I&#x27;m still on my third charge and am currently monitoring the total time to see if I&#x27;m getting that or less. If it truly lasts for 45 mins (about 10 days for me) then it gets a 5Star rating. For now I&#x27;ll give it a 4.    Update: After extensive scientific testing (I kept track of when I charged it) it appears that the battery lasts about 10 days of daily use. That&#x27;s as good as my previous shavers, and it runs at higher RPM, hence the smoother shave. I&#x27;ve also noticed that it fits my hand well, and I have hands like a bunch of bananas.</li>
    <li> Have happily used a Braun shaver for a few decades.  Initially it was to give me a smooth face.  Now, for better or even less, I shave my head and brush my beard. The 3 370 is probably my fourth or fifth and, as I expected of Braun, their best yet.  Comfortable. effcient, effective. Even shaving around my ears.</li>
    <li> I read several negative reviews along with many positive and decided to give the razor a try.  I have been using the razor for about a month now and have not experienced any of the negative items expressed in the reviews; no heads falling off, battery running down quickly, etc.  It provides me with a close, comfortable shave without going over and over my face.  I charged the battery for the first time about three days ago; at least three weeks shaving on one charge!  Cleanup is easy and quick but the tiny brush they provided is not worth much.  I also would like to have some kind of protective cover for the head but all in all I am very satisfied with my purchase.</li>
    <li> This model is surpizingly quieter than the previous two Brauns I have owned. The 370 isn&#x27;t the top of the line, but I can&#x27;t imagine cutting any closer or smoother. My only complaint I did not recieve a plastic comb protector with this shaver as I have in the past with the other shavers.  There is a hard cover case though that will work just as well for traveling.</li>
    <li> The biggest flaw in this design is that you can&#x27;t use it while it&#x27;s plugged in. So if you&#x27;re low on power or in the process of charging, you just have to wait. What makes things worse is that the charging doesn&#x27;t always work and the shaver gets overheated if you leave it plugged in too long. I just left it charging for a day, went to use it, and it said low power.    The shave itself is fine. Just wish they had done a better job with the whole power thing and in my opinion this is a deal-breaker.</li>
    <li> I have used a Braun 6520 shaver for several years, until it no longer kept a charge for more than a couple of days, so I decided to upgrade. I purchased a Braun 370 from Amazon and have used it for about six months. I no longer get a close shave and it takes twice as long to shave and it only holds a charge for a couple of days, so I switched back to my old Braun 6520. It is so much better and it seems to be holding a charge better, so I bought a new head for it. It is louder than the 370, but I can deal with that to get a good shave again. So thumbs down on the Braun 370. Rusty</li>
    <li> Really like the quiet operation.  Seems to shave well.  May take a little longer than the old 5000 I had, but there is no razor burn and the trimmer works well.</li>
    <li> I purchased a Braun Series 3-370 in expectation of a comfortable and close shave. It didn&#x27;t happen. I retain palpable beard after each shave and have to finish with my old Remington MS3 1000 which proves a closer and faster shave. True, the Braun is more attractive and has gadgets not available with the cheapo Remington,but they don&#x27;t add improvement to the finished shave.I give the Braun a \\&quot;3\\&quot; for its&#x27; functionality and appearance.</li>
    <li> I bought this after my old Braun could not be repaired for less than the price of this new one. But the system does not allow for *just charge as my old system and the lock button that lowers one cutter and middle doesn&#x27;t stay without my holding it with my thumb. It cuts nearly aswell as my prev unit, mostly when the effort is made to hold that lock button in. then it&#x27;s super, but tiresome. Okay razor.</li>
    <li> Iwas reaslly looking forward to receiving my Braun 370 electric shaver, and I was very pleasantly surprised at how quiet it ran when I first turned it on.  Then I tried shaving with it and found that I was getting nicked with almost every stroke.  Tiny cuts here and there on my face and neck.  So I turned it off and took a closer look at the foil.  I spotted two small areas that were open to the cutter blades and were rough to the touch when I ran my finger lightly across the surface.  That meant return the razor or order a replacement cutting head.  Since I had a Braun many years ago which I really liked, I decided to order the replacement head.  that was nearly two weeks ago and I still have not received the replacement.  It had better arrive soon, and the shave had better be a big improvement or I&#x27;m going to return the whole lot and demand a refund.&lt;br /&gt;Art</li>
    <li> I wish Braun made its electric razors like they used to ten years ago. The quality has dropped a bit but I have tried a more expensive Panasonic and a Norelco. No electric razor works as well as Braun.</li>
    <li> While shopping for a replacement foil and cutter for my old (ancient) Braun 5610, this shiny new one caught my eye. Now that I&#x27;ve used it for a few weeks, I can heartily recommend it. It&#x27;s quiet, gentle, has long battery life, and gives a great shave. A great value!</li>
    <li> I hoped I could dump the disposable blades for good by purchasing this.  After using it for a few months, the shave wasn&#x27;t as close as I&#x27;d like and, to get the shave as close as I wanted, I had to nick and pinch my skin in the process.  Additionally, it took longer to shave with this then it did a disposable blade.  I&#x27;m back to disposable blades again.</li>
    <li> I expected better from Braun.  One must run it over and over and over to get a decent shave.  Power button location ill-conceived.</li>
    <li> ...because Braun doesn&#x27;t bother to note which shaver model needs which replacement.  Not only is it not listed on the shaver itself, it isn&#x27;t even specified in the manual.  Of course, by the time you figure out that the replacement doesn&#x27;t fit the shaver, the package is opened, and now you can&#x27;t return it.</li>
    <li> I purchased this shaver a couple of weeks ago. I was using an older 1000 series Braun before this one. It was cheap and worked well for the $40 or so I orginally purchased for. The bad thing is that the replacement head is almost as expensive as the original unit. So I began to look for a new unit all together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I looked at most of the reviews and found that the earlier version of this same shaver wasn&#x27;t exactly great. The new version seemed to address some of the flaws the old one had and I decided for the $80, why not. I&#x27;ve been using this for a little over a week and it is very smooth over my face. No razor bumps or irritation (I must note that I never got razor bumps or irritation on my other shaver, nor do I consider myself having extremely sensitive skin).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As all shavers though, it takes me multiple attempts to get the neck area. It&#x27;s a pretty close shave for a shaver, I think it&#x27;s simply impossible to compare it to a blade. Another interesting note that I observed when looking at other reviews is that it lacked the ability to get longer hairs. For example, if you didn&#x27;t shave over the weekend and you let it grow out until Monday morning. I tested this out and to my surprise it actually performed the same as if I shaved the day before. naturally, it took a little bit more time, but that is always the case. I must note that my facial hair does not grow out like a grizzly so this may be part of the problem others had.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I opted out of buying theversion that had the base cleaner because I felt it was not worth the extra money. It takes you only a couple of seconds to run this under hot water. I do wish it came with a plastic cover for the shaver head, but that&#x27;s minor. Overall, i&#x27;m satisfied with this product and would recommend it to others. If you are a reasonable person and understand that this electric shaver is not going to give you the same shave as a knife/blade than I can guarantee you will enjoy it.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the worst electric shaver I have ever owned. Not too bad if you shave often, but a 2 day growth is very time consuming to shave.</li>
    <li> I like most aspect of this razor better than my old 7000 series which has been very serviceable.  At first, I didn&#x27;t think it shaved as close as the old 7000, however now I think it shaves closer with less effort.  It&#x27;s also trimmer and the razor head appears to be more durable than the foil head on the 7000.  I&#x27;m not too wild about the pop-up mustache and beard trimmer though.  It&#x27;s definitely a step down vs. the 7000 series Braun that I have.  The Series 3 370 will be easier to pack in a travel bag.  All in all, I&#x27;m very happy with it.  Razor head durability is the only question left for me to resolve.</li>
    <li> I bought this to replace my old Remington MS2-390.  This was almost $40 more so I thought it would be better.  Honestly, I think the build quality of the Braun is superior but the Remington gave a better shave.  I guess ultimately that is what you are buying these things for so I would prefer my Remington.</li>
    <li> Have used foil razors (Ronson and Braun) for 40 years.  This razor is very good but gap between the foil cutters is too wide to be on surface of upper lip at same time (perhaps to accomodate the long hair cutter set between them).  Gap on the 7505 Braun was much narrower/better for shaving.  Would like to have had a plastic travel shield for the foil screens and On/Off switch as leather case is too bulky.  Charge is lasting 16-17 days (med beard, shave twice a day).  No problem with the head popping off.  Find the &#x27;lock&#x27; /&#x27;unlock&#x27; slide changes the angle of the head cutters from flat to tapered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now after 2 years, very happy with the razor except for points above.  I get 17-18 days of shaving (medium density facial hair).  Usually take two swipes per day for cleaner/closer shave.  Much better than water, cream, razor, nicks, sticks and towel.  Recommended purchase.  My cutters/head are lasting 12 months plus at about $34 replacement price.  Easy to clean.  Not experiencing problem of head popping off unexpectedly.</li>
    <li> Absolutely the best brand of electric razor on the market. I had another Braun that lasted for 12 years, so I chose to stick with the same company. This is a great razor and it adjust easily to those hard to get at spots. I would highly recommend this one to anyone.</li>
    <li> I have tried several electric razors in an attempt to get one that makes me feel like I have been shaved.  I have finally found it - a Braun!!!!!!!  From the first time I used it I felt good about the shave.  The more I use it the better it gets or I get or both of us.  It is an outstanding razor or I wouldn&#x27;t be writing about it.  I will highly recommend this razor to anyone!  If you need to shave quickly this is the item for you!!! You will like a Braun Series 3 370 shaver.</li>
    <li> Okay, until my last shaver started to fall apart, a Remington triple screen, I thought I had a decent shaver.  The Braun is far and away a better razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d taken to plucking stray whiskers (yes, ouch), but the Rem trimmer had long ago stopped working.  While the Braun has a pop-up trimmer, I&#x27;ve not needed to use it, the area between the two screens has a trimmer that seems to catch everything that my old razor had been missing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The noise level surprised me a lot.  I&#x27;d never really thought about it, but the Remington didn&#x27;t seem loud, but if my wife and I were talking, she&#x27;d have to stop as the shaver drowned her out completely.  With the Braun I can still hear her walking around the bathroom and easily have a conversation.  Very quiet indeed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another thing that was very nice was being able to use the Braun right away out of the package.  You plug it in and it&#x27;ll run off the AC current rather than making you wait for a battery charge.  My Remington would die in the midst of a shave and I was left half-shaven.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, it&#x27;s quiet and actually does what it is supposed to do.  Very good qualities to have, yes?</li>
    <li> This shaver is absolutly fantastic for the price. I have owned my second one in the last 10 years and would certainly buy it again. The trick to a close shave is many light passes rather than trying to apply lots of pressure and less strokes. I can get a fantastic shave in about 10 minutes while watching the morning news. I would highly reccomend this product to anyone that wants the best value in electric shavers.</li>
    <li> What can I say, it&#x27;s a Braun razor - I have always been happy with Braun razors and this one is no different.  Close shave, it can be cleaned in the sink, is everything you might want in a razor.</li>
    <li> nice shaver, good price, but it does not give you a smooth shave.  pay a little more and get a better shaver.</li>
    <li> With a razor that costs as much as this one, you should expect superior performance and construction.  Unfortunately, that&#x27;s not the case with the Braun 370.  I have had it for less than a year and the trimmer has already come off it.  Pulling, razor burn and cutting have all been common occurrences and I have had to go back over various spots on my face numerous times during a shave in order to get all the hair off.  I got it as a present and it replaced a Panasonic which, fortunately, I still have.  The Panasonic gives much better performance and I plan to go back to it immediately.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a replacement for my norelco rotary which had become  dull after a recent sharpening. Also, it was not cutting the hairs on my neck, was difficult to clean and replacement cutter heads were  running $35 to $45.  I decided to try a new brand and even though the 370 was a little more, it is definitely worth it.  It gave me a great  shave the first time!!</li>
    <li> Great shaver.  Have not used an electric razor in years.  I checked some reviews of this shaver and most were positive.  I&#x27;ll add my \\&quot;positive\\&quot; to the bunch.  As close to a safety razor as you can get.  Holds charges well and easy clean-up. No problems at all, so far. Price is much lower than some others with horns and bells...probably no better shave.</li>
    <li> After extremely extensive research to find the correct shaver, my \\&quot;gamble\\&quot; with the Braun Series 3 370 completely paid off.  I was 90% sure it would be an \\&quot;OK\\&quot; shaver, based on the research, but the first time I used it, and ever since, it has far exceeded my expectations.  Shaving used to be a 10+ minute endeavor I only did every few days; a) b/c I don&#x27;t need to do it that often, and; b) it was such an uncomfortable experience.  Now, I&#x27;m down to less than 5 minutes and practically shaving every day.  It is washable under the water (big plus!), cleans off very nicely, and delivers a near perfect shave.  I think I may have gotten some minor under chin/neck acne due to the razor, but it&#x27;s really very minor in comparison to the near perfection it delivers.    Totally the best purchase I&#x27;ve made in a long time, and am very proud of it and would absolutely recommend it to any one who asks.  Thanks for reading!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Braun shavers for years and always regretted it when I&#x27;ve purchased another brand. This one is my favorite by far. It seems to have a larger \\&quot;footprint\\&quot; on the face and is so gentle that one doesn&#x27;t have to be particularly careful with it. Over a period of 3 weeks, not a single nick. I also like the one-piece shaving head, unlike previous shavers with two pieces to replace (screen and cutter). The only (minor) downside is the battery doesn&#x27;t seem to be as strong as previous shavers. Nevertheless, it lasts about a week, which allows me to just charge on weekends. And it runs while plugged in, so there&#x27;s no risk of being out of luck if the battery does become depleted. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> This would have been a five star review if I were grading only for ergonomics, design features, quality of construction, and battery life.  It has some great features:  Easy to clean under running water, comfortable \\&quot;feel\\&quot;, long battery life, pop up sideburn trimmer, and the ability to operate it with the the charger cord if the battery is down.  The only problem? - - - It gives a terrible shave.  I can go over my beard repeatedly, from all directions, and still have \\&quot;stubble\\&quot;.  No matter the effort I expend, I simply cannot get a good shave.  I have a fairly course beard and it may be that it&#x27;s simply not compatable with a foil shaver.  This may be the case, judging from the many excellent reviews of this product.  If that is the case, and if your beard is compatable with a foil razor, this product would be an excellent choice.  In the meantime, I have reluctantly gone back to blades.  I may, someday, try another electric with a different system.</li>
    <li> I bought this to replace my 5000 series Braun.  This one is quieter, lighter, shaves a little bit closer and has a battery status light.  It comes with a formed soft zippered case.  Keep your old cleaning brush however; the one supplied is too small to hold on to.      I did run across another razor with the same model number at a department store - but it was a very different looking razor.  If you&#x27;re shopping around you should be aware that there appears to be two different razors with the same model number out there.</li>
    <li> Braun does provide the best electric razors</li>
    <li> This is what I needed because there was a hole in the old one and I am thankful for good service and good product.</li>
    <li> this replaced my old Braun, which was awesome.  this was theoretically and upgrade, but was never as good.  My wife would always doubt I shaved or accused me of shaving poorly.  One vacation I forgot to bring it so bought a Remington that looks similar but was way cheaper - it was way better.  I would not recommend this.</li>
    <li> upon replacing my old worn out braun i decided to pick this mid priced bruan shaver 3-370s series.  i have found out that this was a great surprise in how quite and close shave this gave me, also came with case / brush &amp; oil.  i am very \\&quot;pleased\\&quot; to say bruan has not let me down in 30 yrs and this is my 4 shaver from them.  i \\&quot;highly recommend\\&quot; this shaver and also recommend picking a braun over a norelco any day!  i also owned 2-3 norelco&#x27;s and the 3 blade rotary system is no way even close to what the bruan flex shaver can do.  thank you!  hope this helps.</li>
    <li> It was exactly as described and has all of the features I wanted.  Great product right up to the moment I began shaving - then it became very average.  It eventually gets the job done but seems to take to long with to many repeated trips across my face.  I&#x27;m such a fan of Braun products in general, that I though I&#x27;d give this a try.  Now I&#x27;m thinking a should have stuck with a Norelco like rotary razor.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband and he loves this one.  Currently this is value for money.  Braun is made in Germany and a very reliable product.  He is planning to get the same brand (as far as it is still made in Germany) &amp; more advanced shaver next time.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been shaving with Braun products for the past 30 years and they continue to do a good job.  This \\&quot;middle of road\\&quot; priced product is well worth the money, especially if you are already a satisfied Braun user.  I don&#x27;t want all of the special feature for self-cleaning, etc. that cost you more in the long run to purchase cleaning solution refills.  Prior shaver was a swivel head type and I questioned this new style, but after shaving a few times it&#x27;s been no issue at all.  Shaves as close or better than my older model (however, not sure how much has to do new foil).  As for the statements of allowing a few weeks of shaving for your face to get accustomed to the shaver, I would think this has to do more with transitioning from a rotary head style to the typical Braun style.  When going from a Braun to a Braun, I don&#x27;t believe it&#x27;s an issue.</li>
    <li> I have been a Braun user for nearly 15 years and I was totally surprised by the Series 3. It was quieter; easier and smoother to manage, both on my face and to clean. The charging indicator lights makes it easier to view and charge when needed. This is a superb shaver at a very reasonable price, and should last me years with proper maintenance. Thanks Braun, for this excellent choice again.</li>
    <li> I was very disappointed in this razor, as it had high ratings and my expectations were high. It didn&#x27;t cut close, and my old drug store razor that I bought for $10 actually does a better job.</li>
    <li> they changed the foil and blade where the new style just clamps on and keeps on coming off while shaving.  but the company is great because after calling they sent me a series 5 at no charge.  this one has the clamp on the head as the series 3 had.  the series 3 at this time would not work well with me but the series 5 is very good.</li>
    <li> Exactly what my husband was looking for and a good quality product. Good value for the price, very pleased with product.</li>
    <li> Razor provides a Decent shave, pinches a little, I still run my razor over my face afterwards for a really close shave</li>
    <li> I gave this as a Christmas gift.  My friend was always complaining that his Panasonic ran out of juice when you least expected it, and you can&#x27;t put the cord in and shave, you have to wait for it to charge.  This Braun can be cord or cordless.  They seem to be hard to find nowadays because I guess guys like to shave while showering.  He didn&#x27;t want one of those fancy cleaner tubs or whatever that so many shavers have that many people have complained out.  Anyway he was thrilled with this shaver and has told me what a great shave he gets too.  So I am a happy gift giver!!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t like it...&lt;br /&gt;Doesn&#x27;t do dry shaving of high quality and takes lot of time with lot of patience and learning curve involve for dry shaving...&lt;br /&gt;Braun 7-720 is bit expensive.. but does far better job when compared.... even when compared to manual blade razor wet shaving...</li>
    <li> This razor does a good job of getting both longer and shorter whiskers, however it does not shave nearly as closely as others that I have had.</li>
    <li> The shave is smooth and close very happy with it&lt;br /&gt;Have used Braun shavers for decades&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The unit I purchased is Braun Series 3 370s3 Type 5774&lt;br /&gt;I do have some general comments:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[] Fits in the hand well&lt;br /&gt;[] The unit feels light and the sound is quite&lt;br /&gt;thus making you think its under powered or not working right&lt;br /&gt;[] On battery power the unit runs out of gas faster then prior Braun&lt;br /&gt;units I have owned&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[] This unit takes the new cassette head replacement&lt;br /&gt;foil and cutter is built into one piece the number is 32s&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[] The old style is two piece...one foil and one cutter&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[] I like the shaver and happy I got it&lt;br /&gt;but remember...this takes the new one piece cassette head</li>
    <li> At the very affordable end of the product price range this shaver does a great job.  It&#x27;s my third Braun over the past 25 years and provides the best shave of the three.  I love it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using foil shavers for over 20 years, all Remington, so I was a little leery of the switch but after using this for over a year this is better than any Remington I have ever owned.  Not only does it shave closer, the battery will still go a month before needing to be recharged!  I shave everyday and am still on the original shaving head.</li>
    <li> When I plug it to recharge it and to clean it it does not clean it at all I am very dissatizfied</li>
    <li> The good service with my similar Braun , Type 5 723 (about ten years old), motivated me to buy this shaver which appeared to be very similar.  It was much slower than my old one and difficult to get a close shave.  I got the cutting assembly (with blades and screen) and a new no-name battery for my old Braun which now works fine.  I should have returned the 3 370 but didn&#x27;t bother.</li>
    <li> On May 22, 2012, I purchased this razor @ Amazon.com for my husband. The Norelco we purchased in October, 2011, neeeded a new blade/cutter.  My son got one of these for Christmas and has been fairly pleased.  I should have read the reviews on this!  It has NEVER shaved as close as the Norelco and now is dull as can be.  We&#x27;ve cleaned it throughly, yet it still will barely cut his beard, certainly not a close shave and it take twice as long for him to shave!</li>
    <li> This razor is not as good as a low end panasonic. If you want a true Braun shave get a series 7.</li>
    <li> Razor is quiet, comfortable and close shaving.  Have used this product before and it is long lasting and maintenance free.  Amazon had a very good price and delivery&lt;br /&gt;time.  I would highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> It works really fine. Battery life is good. The shave filling is just like when your shave wuith regular blade shaver in the opposite direction of hair growth,</li>
    <li> I bought this shaver for my husband for the last Xmas in 2011. It does a lousy job, especially around his neck area. His skin is very sensitive and he states how much he hates this razor cause he has to go over spots multiple times. He&#x27;s even gotten cuts from it. In addition, It has some kind of self cleaning mechanism and he states that it doesn&#x27;t clean the razor well either. Well needless to say I will be buying a new razor and it won&#x27;t be a Braun again, that&#x27;s for sure.</li>
    <li> The shaver works fine, the only problem is about the case. You need to choose if you&#x27;ll keep the shaver or the cable/charger on it.&lt;br /&gt;But the shaver is good and looks strong, with fine batteries.</li>
    <li> This is the best electric razor I have owned. It trims my beard and mustache with ease. Great value in today&#x27;s world.&lt;br /&gt;B A Oceanside, NY</li>
    <li> Still works great after 5 years!</li>
    <li> With my old Braun razor sounding like an engine on its last legs it was time to shop for a replacement.  Haven&#x27;t bought a razor in years and was astonished to see $300+ Braun products for sale on Amazon.  I wouldn&#x27;t exactly call myself a cheapskate but paying hundreds of dollars for a razor is just not in the cards.  This unit works extremely well and I thought the price point wasn&#x27;t bordering on extortion.  It&#x27;s much quieter than my old Braun and charges up quickly.  I will echo other reviewers who lament the lack of a plastic cover for the pricey saving head/screen.  That small bit of plastic would cost Braun pennies to include and if I could, I&#x27;d give the company three stars for that lack of foresight.  Great razor overall and a good value.</li>
    <li> Father in law liked it!</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B0020MMCB6 Braun Series 3 370 Men&#x27;s Shaver]] I&#x27;ve been using Braun shavers for nearly 40 years; this is my 4th one. It is by far the closest and cleanest shave I have ever had. It is very quiet and glides easily over my face. The one problem I have is the location of the power switch. It is in the middle of the handle and has a very light actuating touch;as I move my hand to reposition my grip I am frequently turning the shaver OFF. It&#x27;s a little frustrating. All the other shavers had the switch located out of the hand grip area and had a stiffer actuating force. I would recommend it to the average person as a good buy.</li>
    <li> all the other reviews about the blades and trimmer are true but the shaver was still decent. it was turned terrible when the razor stopped working after 1 year the battery died. skip this POS</li>
    <li> Having used Braun single head shavers for years with variable results, when my Series 150 shaver wore out, I decided to move up the the 370 series. Being someone who is not prone to change, the first impression was skeptical. Why would two heads shave any better than a single head? Wouldn&#x27;t the second head make the shaver heavier and harder to maneuver? After shaving for a week, all my doubts are dispelled. The series 370 gives a close shave and my face feels smooth for hours. The motor is quiet and the shaver has the correct heft and hand feel for easy and precise manipulation on the beard. The trimmer pops up and is very useful for stray hairs and neck trimming. Battery life is a week under normal use. The shaver comes with a precise and well crafted zipper case that is firm enough to protect the shaver heads without requiring a plastic head cover. An exceptional product that will not disappoint.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work as well as my old three head roatary shave, so I pitched it after a couple of months and went back to my previous brand.</li>
    <li> [updated July 11, 2012]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Returned my [[ASIN:B0020MMCB6 Braun Series 3 370 Men&#x27;s Shaver]] to the manufacturer during the trial period.  It had a great trimmer, but most trimmers I have used have been acceptable.  Otherwise, the shave and NiMh battery were not so hot and the head does not flex.  My mistake, trying to go cheap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My previous shaver had been an old 5 series that still worked some; I&#x27;d give that one 4 stars.  I once went on a 15 day vacation on this NiCad shaver without the charger, when it was a decade old, no problem.  Just had to be sure to drain the battery and then charge completely (which I eventually goofed).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My new shaver was a [[ASIN:B003YJAZZ4 Braun Series 7- 790cc Pulsonic Shaver System, Silver]], which gave a good shave, but shook itself to death in 26 months.  It&#x27;s now extremely loud, but won&#x27;t drive either the current or previous head.  Trimmer was marginal, but good enough.  This shaver ran 79-80 db at six inches, close to ear damage volume.  Who knows what the equivalent vibrations were, transmitted through my face.  I decided to try something else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In June, 2012, I picked up a [[ASIN:B003YJB026 Braun Series 5-550cc Shaver System, Black and Silver]] on sale for one twenty at my local cost company.  Initially, I liked it&#x27;s relative quiet, but I soon became disappointed with the quality of the shave.  Shaving more carefully and taking about 50% longer helps.  I do like that the head is in two pieces (foil and cutter block), which makes shaking out the cuttings a snap.  If you are fair and young (light beard like I had in college), this model will probably be fine.  Older and tougher, not so hot.  On this and the Series 7, I use the cleaning solution about once a week and then cap the cartridge.  72 db at 6 inches, which makes it less than half as loud as the series 7.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Back to my cost company tonight, I snagged a [[ASIN:B0067D4RYY Philips Norelco 1255x Sensotouch 3d Electric Shaver, Black,Special Value Includes Extra Shaving Head Pack]] apparently a 1250x with the extra head, on sale for one five five with a fifteen mail in rebate.  (I still have my old corded Norelco from decades ago, won&#x27;t do my &#x27;stache correctly, so I have been dubious about these shavers.)  I&#x27;ll be posting my 2 star review tonight; this sucker is going back.  (What a relief to switch back to the Series 5, even if it is slow.)  The only really good thing about the 1255x is the noise: 67 db at 6 inches is about a quarter as loud as the Series 7.  (The decibel scale is logarithmic, not linear.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;------&lt;br /&gt;Update 8-12-2012:  my interpretation of the decibel scale was incorrect.  3db (not 6db) represents a doubling of the sound pressure.  I&#x27;m still using the 5-550cc, which takes at least 50% longer to produce an acceptable shave as my old Series 7.  My credit card provides an extra year of warranty and credited my full Series 7 purchase price to my card, so I&#x27;m probably going to spring for a new Series 7, keep the 5 as a spare.</li>
