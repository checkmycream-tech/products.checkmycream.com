    <li> This works very well and helps to heal quickly. Perfect for bug bites, small cuts, and scrapes. Just a little dab then rub it in. The smell isn&#x27;t that bad, not as strong smelling as full strength tea tree oil. It&#x27;s expensive but you don&#x27;t use a lot, just a little bit, so it will last a long time. Unless you&#x27;re accident prone.  ;-)</li>

    <li> I&#x27;m glad that this worked for others, however, in my case...I broke out in a rash that I&#x27;m still dealing with Two weeks later. There must be something in this ointment that I&#x27;m allergic to. I only wish that I could give it -1 stars.</li>
    <li> I have used tea tree oil as an oil in the past. This was my first time purchasing it in an ointment. I used it for a skin irritation for an 86 year old woman (skin irritation where skin is folded over on itself for long periods of time).  Unfortunately, after using it for 2 days, she got a red rash in the areas it was applied; it has gone away since I switched to using Calmoseptine on that area. I will keep it and try it for myself when I get a scratch or abrasion.</li>
    <li> Gave it to my son and he said it really works.</li>

    <li> I had a horrible rash under my breasts and I used this twice a day for a few weeks.  The rash is gone.  It does smell kind of funky...my husband said like Vicks. But it took away the rash with having to use harsh cortisone or other creams.</li>
    <li> This is a nice product I have used for a long time.  The &amp;#34;use until date&amp;#34; is always 2-3 YEARS from the time purchased.  This time, the vendor sent a product that was right up to the wire on expiration.  Don&#x27;t hesitate to buy it though - just ask the seller what day it expires.</li>
    <li> Everyone needs to have some Tea Tree Ointment in the first aid kit or your medicine cabinet. Period.</li>
