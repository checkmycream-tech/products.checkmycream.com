      <li>but she wants to try because she loved the look.  </li>
      <li>Easy to use.</li>
      <li>Without the tip, too easily burns.  </li>

      <li>good quality mechanics so far!</li>
      <li>I get great waves that last for days &amp; the glove saves my finger tips from burns.</li>

      <li>She has hair down to her butt, and this curls it quickly, as opposed to the curling irons with the clip on it, she&#x27;s done with it in about 5 minutes instead of 35.</li>
      <li>have long thin hair and curls seem to look much better on day 2 hair versus freshly washed hair.</li>
      <li>Makes curls very pretty and tight.</li>
      <li>It heats up very quickly and my shy of an inch waist length hair is easily done in less than 20 minutes.</li>
      <li>No regrets.</li>

    <li> I love my new curling wand..I get great waves that last for days &amp; the glove saves my finger tips from burns.</li>
    <li> Works very well! The curls stayed in my hair and are very bouncy. I also like the choice of having loose or tight curls.</li>
    <li> When rubber tip is on the end, it&#x27;s too hard to unwind your hair off,  Without the tip, too easily burns.  The glove is clumsy and irritating.</li>
    <li> Actually curls my girlfriends long thick hair. She has hair down to her butt, and this curls it quickly, as opposed to the curling irons with the clip on it, she&#x27;s done with it in about 5 minutes instead of 35.</li>
    <li> I have naturally wavy/curly hair however I bought this in order to enhance my hair on days when I want to wear it curly. While this doesn&#x27;t have any heat settings I have found that the 400 degrees F is perfect for my thick mane so I don&#x27;t particularly mind. It does get very hot though so I suggest always using heat protectant spray and the glove. It heats up very quickly and my shy of an inch waist length hair is easily done in less than 20 minutes. I also love that its tapered as you can manipulate the curl to be tighter or looser depending on your mood.</li>
    <li> Love this, but wish it had an auto-off feature in case it is left turned on.&lt;br /&gt;I have long thin hair and curls seem to look much better on day 2 hair versus freshly washed hair.</li>
    <li> I love this product but did not receive the glove. Already burned my hand twice and only used it once...</li>
    <li> Arrived on time and works perfectly. It does not have a heat adjustment.</li>
    <li> I love this wand!! but hands do get burnt easily so caution ;)</li>
    <li> Love it gets really hot but i love my new wand :)</li>
    <li> So I love this. I&#x27;ve burnt myself many times. Mainly because I am a klutz. I would definitely use the glove. I love the results this provides. It heats fast.</li>
    <li> I love this curling wand! It was exactly what I was looking for and gives me the best curls.</li>
    <li> this is a great tool for fast, natural looking beach waves. I don&#x27;t want to ever spend time with a curling iron and I want it to look natural. This does it. I might go with a bigger barrel if you have lots of hair (thickness or length), but this works for me. good quality mechanics so far!</li>
    <li> I really like this styling tool, but I&#x27;m still not very good at using it.  I actually wish that it came with two gloves so I didn&#x27;t have to put the wand down and switch hands... but maybe that just comes with practice.</li>
    <li> Perfect. Exactly what I wanted. Gets pretty hot, no hear adjustment but I just adjust the time I keep my hair on it. No complaints. I would buy this again and any other products from this brand.</li>
    <li> Terrible product.  One heat setting.  No wonder I couldn&#x27;t find any reviews online</li>
    <li> Pretty pleased with this product. For the money it does its job. Gets very hot though. Makes curls very pretty and tight. Would recommend to first time buyers :-)</li>
    <li> Worked well for purpose of needing a dual-voltage curling wand while on vacation in Europe. Overall was not as good of quality as compared to my curling wand used in the USA.</li>
    <li> Great curling wand. Easy to use.</li>
    <li> This curler is very good and the curls last for a long time.  Beware the heat and use the glove!</li>
    <li> Be careful not to burn yourself!!</li>
    <li> I bought this for myself but my above the shoulder length hair was too short for this to work so I took it to my daughter and used it on her long hair and it came out beautifully.  I&#x27;m not sure she can do it herself but she wants to try because she loved the look.  I read other reviews and comments about the various gloves that came with the wands and I thought this one was fine.  Its a stretchy mesh and not cumbersome.  I held onto the hair and not the wand because they say it could burn.  Before using a wand I would suggest watching a youtube video about it.  It helped me a lot.</li>
    <li> Love it but it already burned the crap out of my arm, it gets HOTT!!!</li>
    <li> Got exactly what I wanted.</li>
    <li> Love this product. No regrets.</li>
    <li> This makes nice loose waves and is easy to use after the first try.  I wish it had temperature settings because it gets SO hot and takes awhile to cool down.  I always use the rubber tip because I don&#x27;t pull my hair close to the end anyway.  I tried to use the glove but it makes it awkward to hold the hair.  I keep burning 1 knuckle, but I&#x27;m still adjusting to using this so hopefully that will stop.</li>
    <li> Took awhile to arrive from the seller, but does exactly as advertised &amp; my daughter loves it.</li>
    <li> Works great.  I don&#x27;t use the cool tip.  I ended up trading one of my daughters for her glove with a longer cuff on the wrist because I burnt myself a couple times.  Heats up quickly.  I would definitely buy it again.  I&#x27;ve been using it a couple months now.</li>
