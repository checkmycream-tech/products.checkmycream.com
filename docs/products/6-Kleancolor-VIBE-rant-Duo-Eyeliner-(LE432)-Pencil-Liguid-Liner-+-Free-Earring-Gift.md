<ol>
      <li>eyeliners are almost perfect.</li>
      <li>yes, I loved these eyeliners!!</li>
      <li>The colors are beautiful, very bright!</li>
      <li>Not as bright as I&#x27;d like the colors to be, but great quality!</li>
      <li>Beautiful colors,</li>
      <li>Colors are beautiful.</li>
      <li>an the Orange is gonna be great for Halloween</li>
      <li>Great price too.</li>
      <li>It has great staying power  waterproof and doesn&#x27;t smudge at all.</li>
      <li>they are bright and will not budge at all.</li>
      <li>This item has some good color others</li>
      <li>So good luck</li>
      <li>not so good</li>
      <li>The liquid liners go on smoothly and stay all day, and the automatic pencil liners while not being as bright, would also stay!</li>
      <li>Kleancolor should add more shades!</li>
      <li>The colors are bright and I love that each color features a pot of liquid color as well as pencil liner.</li>
      <li>This formula is soooo bright and more importantly stays bright until I take it off. :)</li>
      <li>However it&#x27;s almost like a thick/clay type of liquid that doesn&#x27;t go on very smooth.</li>
      <li>you cannot see unless you have a very light skin complexion...</li>
      <li>They are so bold and bright.</li>
      <li>im glad i ordered them</li>
      <li>I like to use the potted color for top liner and the pencil for bottom.</li>
      <li>Not so much neon but still great.</li>
      <li>The packaging is so cute and spunky.</li>
      <li>Love the liquid part to these liners.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s fixable, but you end up applying more layers of liner than you probably would have to make it look uniform.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s okay</li>
      <li>Seem great so far!</li>
      <li>If you don&#x27;t move quick and it drys, any more that you put on to correct</li>
      <li>i love these eyeliners, the colors are very pretty.</li>
      <li>Overall it was a great buy just for the liquid liner.</li>
      <li>Also side note, I didn&#x27;t get free earrings</li>
      <li>I bought them primarily for the pink/yellow/orange, and the colors IRL did not disappoint.</li>
      <li>The colors are vibrant with one stroke (liquid portion of the product) and wears so nice.</li>
      <li>I was so excited for these - but they did not work well for me at all.</li>
      <li>Not exactly like the picture but beautiful any way.</li>
      <li>On the plus side, however, that ensures that it does NOT come off, smudge, smear, or even fade, so it COULD be seen as a definite good thing.</li>
      <li>I loved the yellow for superhero day!</li>
      <li>The only good thing was the package came on time.</li>
      <li>the yellow is gorgeous but caused me to have a eye infection so i will not be purchasing this product ever again.</li>
      <li>So vibrant I love them.</li>
      <li>The colors are super pretty and unique as well.</li>
      <li>The colors are beautiful but the brush is way to stiff and does not allow to to apply without streaking.</li>
      <li>Pretty colors!</li>
      <li>The colors are absolutely stunning and even better than I expected considering the price.  </li>
      <li>Really pigmented for the place not bad</li>
      <li>All really bright colors, except for the purple as others have previously said in reviews.</li>
      <li>The green is my favorite color, but it&#x27;s more of an emerald than the bright minty green</li>
      <li>if you love eyeliner an want a different color</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s more aqua, heavier on the blue side of things.</li>
      <li>colors are ok but the liner starts cracking shortly after it dries.</li>
      <li>These liners are definitely exactly what I was looking for.</li>
      <li>Regardless, the colors are all still pretty</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t receive my yellow eyeliner which is very displeasing because that is the color I wanted most.</li>
      <li>The liquid half of these eyeliners are amazing.</li>
      <li>The eyeliners overall are very pigmented and easy to apply.</li>
      <li>Will slide off with a little warm water and gentle rubbing.</li>
      <li>The purple is also the least bright of the pack.</li>
      <li>The rest of the colors are also not as lightly bright as they appear, except for the yellow and pink.</li>
      <li>I really like the matching pencil eyeliner in the cap of each one.</li>
      <li>I expected more &amp;#34;neon&amp;#34; colors.</li>
      <li>Not really worth the money but lovely colors. /:</li>
      <li>But they are waterproof and bold enough</li>
      <li>I will need to play around with them, and I think they&#x27;ll make a good base for blending with a vibrant shadow, but on their own they are translucent.</li>
      <li>Ι bought a series of cosmetics of this line and it is one of the greatest mistakes of my life.&lt;br /&gt;REALLY BAD QUALITY</li>
      <li>The only way I can wear it is if I put my black eyeliner on first then the color on top.  </li>
      <li>I was really surprised by the pigmentation of these liners!</li>
      <li>So surprised by this product!</li>
      <li>I would have given it full stars IF the purple was more PURPLE, and if the green was actually green.</li>
      <li>My only complaint is that they kind of peel off when I take the liner off.</li>
      <li>Smudge-proof, super long lasting!</li>
      <li>The yellow and pink match the picture exactly.</li>
      <li>More than one came with the pencil side broken.</li>
      <li>Its super hard to apply.</li>

<li> Its super hard to apply.</li>
<li> I only have a few complaints; the purple is pretty faded, it&#x27;s not a highlighter color, like the casing assumes, and the green is NOT green.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s is a very long lasting product.</li>
<li> Was a little surprised by that, but not put off.</li>
<li> only one I&#x27;ve had any trouble with is the purple, as the applicator doesn&#x27;t apply evenly on that tube and it almost wipes away color as it applies it.</li>
<li> Only part I don&#x27;t like is that the applicator for liquid eyeliners are too stiff.</li>
<li> (green black an white), !!!!</li>
<li> I did receive a few of the \\&quot;crayon\\&quot; portions to be too dry to use...but the paint parts make up for it.</li>
<li> It was a let down.</li>
<li> it becomes a crumbly/chunky mess.</li>
<li> This next one isn&#x27;t so much of a complaint as confusion: When the eyeliner dries, it dries like a latex paint!</li>
<li> The green is quite a bit darker than the photo, not at all the pastel shown.</li>
<li> The colors came to me all dried out.</li>
<li> Waste of money,</li>
<li> , an the green 😁is almost out, cause ha that&#x27;s one of our school colors.</li>
<li> but like other reviewers have said the brush is way to stiff and it comes out to thick and clumpy.</li>
<li> Doesn&#x27;t dry thick or uncomfortable.</li>
<li> Hard to put on.</li>
<li> Just the purple seems dull..</li>
<li> the brush makes it really hard to apply so</li>
<li> outlike whiteout..too thick</li>
<li> Color payoff was bad and the overall quality is just bad.</li>
<li> Im like addicted to 5 Thangs!</li>
<li> As as you can see from my photo, the pencil part is a bit faint.</li>
<li> Applicator was stiff and worthless.</li>
<li> It steaks very badly and it Peels off and cracks throughout the day.</li>
<li> I was very disappointed when I received them in the mail.</li>

    <li> Colors are beautiful. Not exactly like the picture but beautiful any way. Hard to put on. The liquid you can peel off.</li>
    <li> So vibrant I love them.</li>
    <li> This item has some good color others not so good the brush makes it really hard to apply so i had to buy a brush so that i could apply this liner. the yellow is gorgeous but caused me to have a eye infection so i will not be purchasing this product ever again. the purple you cannot see unless you have a very light skin complexion... So good luck</li>
    <li> The colors are bright and I love that each color features a pot of liquid color as well as pencil liner. The green is my favorite color, but it&#x27;s more of an emerald than the bright minty green it appears to be in the picture. The rest of the colors are also not as lightly bright as they appear, except for the yellow and pink. The yellow and pink match the picture exactly. All of the rest of the colors are about two shades darker and not quite as neon as pictured.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only one I&#x27;ve had any trouble with is the purple, as the applicator doesn&#x27;t apply evenly on that tube and it almost wipes away color as it applies it. The purple is also the least bright of the pack. Regardless, the colors are all still pretty and I always get compliments when I use them. I like to use the potted color for top liner and the pencil for bottom. I would purchase this set again.</li>
    <li> Actually terrible. Colors were not even close to described. Applicator was stiff and worthless. Color payoff was bad and the overall quality is just bad. Would NOT recommend.</li>
    <li> The colors are absolutely stunning and even better than I expected considering the price.  My daughter even asks to borrow them.</li>
    <li> Love the liquid part to these liners. Great price too. As as you can see from my photo, the pencil part is a bit faint. Overall it was a great buy just for the liquid liner. It has great staying power  waterproof and doesn&#x27;t smudge at all. Will slide off with a little warm water and gentle rubbing. All really bright colors, except for the purple as others have previously said in reviews. Also side note, I didn&#x27;t get free earrings but I didn&#x27;t care either.</li>
    <li> The liquid half of these eyeliners are amazing. I bought them primarily for the pink/yellow/orange, and the colors IRL did not disappoint. The green is quite a bit darker than the photo, not at all the pastel shown. As for the pencil side of these duos, well, that leaves something to be desired. I will need to play around with them, and I think they&#x27;ll make a good base for blending with a vibrant shadow, but on their own they are translucent.</li>
    <li> I only have a few complaints; the purple is pretty faded, it&#x27;s not a highlighter color, like the casing assumes, and the green is NOT green. It&#x27;s more aqua, heavier on the blue side of things. This next one isn&#x27;t so much of a complaint as confusion: When the eyeliner dries, it dries like a latex paint! You have to literally PEEL it off (which hurts a bunch if you get it in your lashes) as makeup remover won&#x27;t do the trick. On the plus side, however, that ensures that it does NOT come off, smudge, smear, or even fade, so it COULD be seen as a definite good thing. Was a little surprised by that, but not put off. I would have given it full stars IF the purple was more PURPLE, and if the green was actually green.</li>
    <li> Ι bought a series of cosmetics of this line and it is one of the greatest mistakes of my life.&lt;br /&gt;REALLY BAD QUALITY</li>
    <li> I expected more &amp;#34;neon&amp;#34; colors. But they are waterproof and bold enough</li>
    <li> Really pigmented for the place not bad</li>
    <li> dries rubbery, peels off</li>
    <li> I was really surprised by the pigmentation of these liners! They are so bold and bright. The liquid liners go on smoothly and stay all day, and the automatic pencil liners while not being as bright, would also stay! The packaging is so cute and spunky. These liners are definitely exactly what I was looking for. My only complaint is that they kind of peel off when I take the liner off.</li>
    <li> The colors are beautiful, very bright! However it&#x27;s almost like a thick/clay type of liquid that doesn&#x27;t go on very smooth. If you don&#x27;t move quick and it drys, any more that you put on to correct it becomes a crumbly/chunky mess.</li>
    <li> yes, I loved these eyeliners!! Im like addicted to 5 Thangs! my hair-my eyeliner-my shoes-my nails- an my jeans. don&#x27;t ask why, I jus am! I loved the yellow for superhero day! an the Orange is gonna be great for Halloween, an the green 😁is almost out, cause ha that&#x27;s one of our school colors. (green black an white), !!!!anyways!!!! if you love eyeliner an want a different color/look, I suggest you buy these!!(: &amp;#60;3</li>
    <li> It sucks,the liquid side comes outlike whiteout..too thick and it takes forever to come off. The pencil side doesnt show enough color at all. Waste of money,</li>
    <li> colors are ok but the liner starts cracking shortly after it dries.</li>
    <li> The colors came to me all dried out. They look nothing like the picture. I was very disappointed when I received them in the mail. The only good thing was the package came on time.</li>
    <li> Not as bright as I&#x27;d like the colors to be, but great quality! Smudge-proof, super long lasting!</li>
    <li> i love these eyeliners, the colors are very pretty. they show well on the skin too. im glad i ordered them</li>
    <li> The colors are beautiful but the brush is way to stiff and does not allow to to apply without streaking. Its super hard to apply.I also received to colors that where open and leaking and seller never answered my emails or replaced them.</li>
    <li> So surprised by this product! The colors are vibrant with one stroke (liquid portion of the product) and wears so nice. Doesn&#x27;t dry thick or uncomfortable. The colors are super pretty and unique as well.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t receive my yellow eyeliner which is very displeasing because that is the color I wanted most. The eyeliners overall are very pigmented and easy to apply. I just wish I could have gotten all the colors that are shown.</li>
    <li> Only swatched. Seem great so far! Just the purple seems dull.. Not so much neon but still great.</li>
    <li> This formula is soooo bright and more importantly stays bright until I take it off. :)&lt;br /&gt;These eyeliners are almost perfect. I did receive a few of the \\&quot;crayon\\&quot; portions to be too dry to use...but the paint parts make up for it. Kleancolor should add more shades!</li>
    <li> These are not neons like it looks in the picture. .however they are bright and will not budge at all.</li>
    <li> Pretty colors! I really like the matching pencil eyeliner in the cap of each one. Only part I don&#x27;t like is that the applicator for liquid eyeliners are too stiff. As you apply it, an whitish line in the middle of the color happens. It&#x27;s fixable, but you end up applying more layers of liner than you probably would have to make it look uniform. It&#x27;s is a very long lasting product. Doesn&#x27;t run or fade.</li>
    <li> Beautiful colors, but like other reviewers have said the brush is way to stiff and it comes out to thick and clumpy. It steaks very badly and it Peels off and cracks throughout the day. The only way I can wear it is if I put my black eyeliner on first then the color on top.  Not really worth the money but lovely colors. /:</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s okay&lt;br /&gt;Not opaque</li>
    <li> I was so excited for these - but they did not work well for me at all. More than one came with the pencil side broken. And the liquid did not go on well. It was a let down.</li>
