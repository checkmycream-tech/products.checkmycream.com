    <li> My Father was a woodworker (among a million other things) and appreciated great craftmanship and a simple yet ornate taste. There was no question that this was the right one for him. Many thanks for creating something classy, beautiful, not flashy and tasteful. It looked so beautiful in the church during the Mass. Many, many thanks!</li>
    <li> Purchased this to hold my father&#x27;s ashes until we have a family gathering to scatter his ashes.  Very nice quality for a very reasonable price.</li>
    <li> Very quick shipping and delivery! Beautiful wood finish. Beautiful urn. The only two complaints that I had was:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A) The carved cross was slightly crooked.&lt;br /&gt;B) My father&#x27;s name was not properly centered on the engraved plate (it was offset to the left.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other than that, nice product.</li>
    <li> For the holidays I wanted to purchase an urn for my father&#x27;s ashes as a gift for my mother. I&#x27;m fairly inexperienced to anything of this nature and don&#x27;t have a whole lot of money to pay some of the prices that are requested. Dimensions and quality were another weight of stress on me but after hours of scouring and sifting through various websites and offer&#x27;s I was led to this one in the end.&lt;br /&gt;It was perfect! I&#x27;m very happy with it as is she and feel for those seeking likewise, will be too. 5 stars!</li>
    <li> beautiful and arrived in time for my Beloved&#x27;s life celebration</li>
    <li> The wood in this product is beautiful.  It is finished nicely and tthe size is perfect for it&#x27;s intended use.  My only complaint was the bottom of the box where the screws are was stained and varnished  with the screws in place. I had to pick the stain out with an ice pick to remove the screws.  After that I was able to remove the bottom cover easily.</li>
    <li> Beautiful product and extremely prompt shipping.</li>
    <li> Very pleased with the urn we purchased for our mom.</li>
    <li> Beautiful workmanship. We will treasure this for many years to come</li>
    <li> Very nice well made perfect for my husbands remains</li>
    <li> Not the finest quality woodworking, but is nice enough. Serves the purpose and looked good at the memorial service. A good product for use to be placed away in a vault. Might not be ideal for an at home presentation.</li>
    <li> So disappointed the one I received had a smashed in corner and a large whitish streak across the front. I am so embarrassed to use this urn, but time constraints don&#x27;t allow me to purchase another. I really do not recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This rosewood cremation urn is lovely. It has botanical carvings at the top and bottom edge, as well as a beautiful cross carved on the front side. We were extremely pleased with the product and the prompt shipping. It was received within a couple days of the order being placed.</li>
    <li> I was very pleased with my purchase. I&#x27;m very surprised how big it was and the detailing on it was beautiful thank you</li>
