      <li>It works amazing.  </li>
      <li>Works best when you have some hair on acalp -- but don&#x27;t need much.  </li>
      <li>I kind of agree...</li>
      <li>I honestly cannot find anything like it to make my hair look way thicker and fuller.</li>
      <li>Honestly, get some cover girl eyeshadow.</li>
      <li>The moisture on the sponge helps prolong Couvre and helps it distribute more evenly.</li>
      <li>Works ok.</li>
      <li>I am incredibly satisfied and would do it again in a heartbeat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please don&#x27;t get scammed.  </li>
      <li>I use hair fibers on top of this product to give a fuller look.</li>
      <li>Have been using it for many years.</li>
      <li>/&gt;this would be ok for just touching up roots</li>
      <li>You will be able to tell you are wearing goo in your hair.</li>
      <li>:)  </li>
      <li>I am using a powder that I like better.  </li>
      <li>good price and well worth the experience.</li>
      <li>Great product, works very well with Toppiks powder.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m so glad I found it</li>
      <li>Now I am confident and bald spots are gone.</li>
      <li>sure...</li>
      <li>You can also use a combination of Toppik with it and provide even better results.  </li>
      <li>It can be safely used along with Rogaine and Toppik.</li>
      <li>Much better than the sprays that came out, and easy to apply.  </li>
      <li>It really does a good job at concealing the areas in question and easy to apply I recommend it very much !!!</li>
      <li>It does require a kind of tapping on application when hair is still damp, but it&#x27;s easy to get the hang of quickly.</li>
      <li>The dosage is only available in 0.5 mg pills, even though research shows 2.5 mg is the ideal dosage for hair loss.  </li>
      <li>Washes off easily with shampoo.</li>
      <li>Easy to apply and will stand up to rain.  </li>
      <li>Any excess is easily wiped away.</li>
      <li>This strongly limits color rubbing off on sheets, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Voila</li>
      <li>I use this to mask my fine and thinning hair.  </li>
      <li>However they give you this HUGE @ss sponge to apply it..</li>
      <li>Some days you are only so brave.</li>
      <li>but I didn&#x27;t enjoy using a cream.  </li>
      <li>Most of the masking lotion was absorbed by the sponge applicator.</li>
      <li>I buy a cheap blush brush</li>
      <li>HAIR SPRAY lightly where fibers were applied.</li>
      <li>but it only takes a sprinkle and it looks great again.  </li>
      <li>My hair loss is right at the top of my head and you have to make sure you put it on very evenly or else</li>
      <li>so I can&#x27;t make a part and work along it -- and even I find Couvre easy to use and worth every penny.</li>
      <li>I love it and will certainly be using it again once I run out.  </li>
      <li>I feel so much better about myself now, thanks to COUVRE.</li>
      <li>I now have a full head of hair and intend to do a video review with before and after pics.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>some couvre will rinse out but most of it stays and adds body and covers the thinning area decently.</li>
      <li>Overall a great product and very helpful.</li>
      <li>Arrived quickly.</li>
      <li>The seller shipped quickly, product was just as I ordered,</li>
      <li>Arrived quickly and undamaged.</li>
      <li>I live in the Seattle area so this was so important!</li>
      <li>Some might find this useful; I did not.</li>
      <li>Without going into details about why I use this product, I will just say that it works and is worth the money.</li>
      <li>I started thinning at a young age, before shaving the head was stylish.  </li>
      <li>Right after the above step, hold about 4 inches from scalp &amp; shake on light sprinkle of hair fibers on top of scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Still a good seller; I like their other products.</li>
      <li>Avodart works many times better and costs significally less.  </li>
      <li>but this really darkens your scalp and gives the illusion of full hair.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m a healthy, vibrant, young at heart 64 year old &amp; 90 per cent of my hair on top is gone.</li>
      <li>I used to be able to apply and style with hair dryer and NOT LOOSE any volume to my hair...</li>
      <li>Very large bald spots were covered enough that you would be able to go out without a hat or a wig.</li>
      <li>Okay I even make jokes about shoe polish but this definitely worked for me.</li>
      <li>I tried most all of the hair regrowth products only to later discover most of them were a scam and resulted in me losing more hair when there are actually only a couple things that do</li>
      <li>then I would use more Couvre than regular use since the fibers will be coming off.</li>
      <li>&lt;br /&gt;any volume I suggest tying DermMatch first.</li>
      <li>Product was exactly as promised.</li>
      <li>ONCE YOU LEARN HOW TO NOT USE TO MUCH AND LEARN TRICKS ON APPLYING IT!</li>
      <li>It feels comfortable and pants doesn&#x27;t fit too low nor high.  </li>
      <li>You obviously need some hair for it to look good especially if you combine it with Toppix hair building fibers</li>
      <li>If you&#x27;ve ever been outside and experienced a big wind draft, only to go home and see that glaring bald spot in the mirror, you&#x27;re left to wonder how many people saw you like that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It come with a sponge applicator, which makes covering a large area of the scalp a breeze.</li>
      <li>You certainly get the coverage with this product</li>
      <li>but it stayed on very well and didn&#x27;t see any transferance.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> This is the best scalp fill-in product I&#x27;ve ever used. Completely natural looking, doesn&#x27;t flake off. It gives my hair a fuller, finished look from shampoo to shampoo. It does require a kind of tapping on application when hair is still damp, but it&#x27;s easy to get the hang of quickly. I have curly hair so I can&#x27;t make a part and work along it -- and even I find Couvre easy to use and worth every penny. Hope you try it. Sure beats those powder fill-ins, fiber pour-ons, and color sprays by a mile!</li>
    <li> DOES A GOOD COVER JOB ONCE YOU LEARN HOW TO NOT USE TO MUCH AND LEARN TRICKS ON APPLYING IT!</li>
    <li> I had thinning hair and bald spots at the back of my head due to some strong medications that I take for chronic RA. I was quite desperate as many friends and family members were starting to make comments about it. I read about COUVRE on the internet and decided to try it out. It will not regrow your hair but by masking the exposed areas of your scalp it makes the hair appear thicker and of course hides the balding areas. It can be safely used along with Rogaine and Toppik. I feel so much better about myself now, thanks to COUVRE.</li>
    <li> Arrived quickly and undamaged. Product was exactly as promised.</li>
    <li> MESSIER THAN THE PANCAKE POWDER TYPE TO APPLY BUT DOES A DECENT JOB.  TOO EXPENSIVE FOR WHAT YOU GET, i RECOMMEND GOING WITH THE PANCAKE TYPE</li>
    <li> works great when applied to damp hair ...you only need a little so it last a long time</li>
    <li> Without going into details about why I use this product, I will just say that it works and is worth the money.</li>
    <li> They need to bring back Couvre in Auburn! Topik fibers do not stay on the scalp!</li>
    <li> I am updating my review from 2 to 4 stars. This by itself would not quite do the trick but I after reading other reviews I decided to try this in conjunction with hair fibers. (Toppik, Fully, Cabooki, etc.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The two combined is a wonderful thing! I use Couvre when my hair is almost dry. I squeeze Couvre onto a small plate and run the sponge quickly under my faucet. The moisture on the sponge helps prolong Couvre and helps it distribute more evenly. Then after my hair is completely dry, I style it and sprinkle Hair Fibers on the spots I need and add a quick mist of hairspray. Great combination!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATED: I went swimming with the combo above and while the fibers fell out Couvre still stayed on my scalp. So if you do plan on swimming then I would use more Couvre than regular use since the fibers will be coming off. Still- very happy with product!</li>
    <li> Couvre really helped hide severe propecia issue. Highly recommend this product.Very large bald spots were covered enough that you would be able to go out without a hat or a wig.</li>
    <li> Couvre does the job, covering up all the bald spots.  I&#x27;ve used it for years and never had any skin or other problems develop.  I&#x27;ll keep using it until they come up with a real cure for baldness.</li>
    <li> Someone wrote it&#x27;s paint... I kind of agree... only it&#x27;s thicker.  Like liquid, shoe polish.  The odor isn&#x27;t offensive but you can smell it.  Reminds me of a shampoo like Nioxin.  Curious to see how long it remains.  I gave it all 5 stars because I think it does what it promises... but don&#x27;t think you can paint your bald spot and it&#x27;ll look like real hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only value I see in this as a second layer of skin if you&#x27;re already using a fiber compound like Nanogen, Toppik or Cabooki.  This Couvre would come in handy if you sweat or fell victim to a gust of wind because nobody, even the people being dishonest in the reviews, can convince me that a fiber product will withstand moisture or a stiff breeze.  And when that stiff breeze your hair fiber right off your head, you&#x27;re left with a huge, light skinned hole in your hair... like a leper.  That&#x27;s worse than a huge bald spot.  If you&#x27;ve ever been outside and experienced a big wind draft, only to go home and see that glaring bald spot in the mirror, you&#x27;re left to wonder how many people saw you like that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And I dare someone to prove to me that a hair fiber will stay on in a shower or pool.  Are you serious?  A little perspiration causes the hair fiber products to ball up like a water drop in a pile of dirt.  Now you don&#x27;t look like a leper... you look like a leopard.  How can you people lie like that?  Do you work for the company and post deceitful reviews?  HAIR FIBER PRODUCTS ARE NOT AT ALL RESISTANT TO WATER OR WIND.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, how do you guys get Couvre to last so long?  Do you have small, bald spots?  I had to use quite a bit of the stuff and can&#x27;t imagine this little tube lasting 6-8 months with even sporadic use.</li>
    <li> IDK what is up with all the high reviews but this was a big pass to me! Smells terrible and really does no coverage! I used it on wet and dry hair to see if there was a difference. Seems to be easier to deal with on wet hair but I just don&#x27;t see how that gaudy sponge you get is supposed to help. Even if you put on a couple layers it still won&#x27;t give any decent coverage. The formula is wet which is just weird to put goop on ur hair. I thought it would dry dark like a mask at first but it didn&#x27;t. Honestly, get some cover girl eyeshadow. I mix black and this dark brown together for my hair color and it works like a charm.</li>
    <li> ****BUYER BEWARE!!!****  Couvre has changed it&#x27;s formula.  I used this product for over 7 years and recently noticed the&lt;br /&gt;product has changed.  I used to be able to apply and style with hair dryer and NOT LOOSE any volume to my hair...&lt;br /&gt;or what little hair I have...LOL.  Now the formula is NOTICEABLY DIFFERENT!!!.  I tried the new formula only to&lt;br /&gt;find it weighs the hair down...not a greasy feel but ceratainly not the dry feel after blow drying.  I called customer&lt;br /&gt;service about it and they claim to have changed nothing....yeah sure...waste of my time anyways....it&#x27;s just a call&lt;br /&gt;center following up with you probably like they do the the 100&#x27;s of other products they push.  I now use DermMatch&lt;br /&gt;and will not go back to Couvre.  They lost a customer forever.  So....if you have fine hair and don&#x27;t want to loose&lt;br /&gt;any volume I suggest tying DermMatch first.</li>
    <li> It works amazing.  It has completely hidden my thinning hair.  I&#x27;m so glad I found it - just what the dr ordered.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff!!!  I use it while my hair color grows out to cover that hair line grey.  I wanted to let some users know how I apply it-may help.  I buy a cheap blush brush and I cut it down straight across about 1/2 inch before the metal band that holds the fibers. Then I push a little out of the tube and rub the flat brush end on it and then rub it around in my hair and on my scalp before I curl and hair spray my hair.  It is the best way I have found.  Hope this helps someone!!!</li>
    <li> Tacky consistency, messy. Still a good seller; I like their other products.</li>
    <li> Okay I even make jokes about shoe polish but this definitely worked for me. I think it could stand alone but on my trial run I also used toppic fibers to increase density. Even before I applied the fibers, my wife exclaimed &amp;#34;what did you do??&amp;#34; when I showed her the back of my head.</li>
    <li> I use this to mask my fine and thinning hair.  Every time I go to a new salon they are shocked at how I am able to hide it so well with this product.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> not noticed I&#x27;m missing hair, I feel safe, no one sees my fault, I recommend especially not with water drops</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for years now. I was so glad to find it! Everything else was messy. I use this with Toppik&#x27;s hair building fibers. I put this on my scalp. It colors the scalp and also because I am older and dye my hair, my roots are gray in between dying. This covers up the gray roots also. :)  I first put this on when my hair is almost dry but not quite. I start in the back and come forward rubbing it on my scalp. I have a lot of hair loss. Then I let it dry 10 minutes or so and then sprinkle on the Toppik. I comb my hair slightly and then style it. No one can tell I am bald at all and the Toppik&#x27;s helps to add the look of more hair and volume!! Between the two I can go up to a week without washing my hair if needs be. I have never never had a problem with it running in the rain. I live in the Seattle area so this was so important! In all it takes about a half an hour to do my hair. That includes rolling my hair! That isn&#x27;t bad at all. I can get ready in 45 minutes after washing my hair. I put makeup on while the Courve is drying and then finish my hair. I sometimes have to do touchups on the Toppik during the week in the very front near my scalp but it only takes a sprinkle and it looks great again.  I don&#x27;t have the mess I had when I used sprays and other products. I do have to wash my forehead and sides of my face in the morning because they may get a little brown on them but very very light and it&#x27;s minimal!! It never comes off on my pillow case either. I want to do a video for you to see how I do this. I haven&#x27;t gotten it done but it&#x27;s on my to do list! I can tell you even my Dr didn&#x27;t know! My kids didn&#x27;t realize how bald I had gotten when they saw me once when I had just washed my hair before I put the products on. I am so GLAD for these products!! I would have to be wearing a wig otherwise. You won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
    <li> I have used this lotion for over 20 years now, and it works very good.  I am not sure what I would have done without it.  I started thinning at a young age, before shaving the head was stylish.  I applied this lotion and it hid all the bald spots, even from close up.  Much better than the sprays that came out, and easy to apply.  It won&#x27;t run when your hair gets wet from rain, but it does shampoo out easily.  I don&#x27;t know about swimming, I don&#x27;t do much of that.  Some did rub off on my pillow case if I left it on overnight.  It did wash out though.  Overall a great product and very helpful.</li>
    <li> Product is supposed to be creamy but came out of tube very watery, runny.  Tried to disperse in tube to mix but still no difference.  Have used this product before and always a cream from tube.  This tube may have been outdated.  Unable to use at all.</li>
    <li> I really sympathize with everyone losing their hair so please please please, take the time to read my review and thank me in a couple of years!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About me:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am currently a 28 y/o male and I used this product happily for about 6 months after my second plastic surgery.  I wish I had discovered it years ago, but at least I did.  I started losing my hair in my early 20&#x27;s or late teens but didn&#x27;t realize it until I was 23 or 24.  Typically you don&#x27;t notice hair loss until you&#x27;ve lost at least 50% of it!  Anyway, I was devastated.  I used to model and was very popular amongst the girls.  I tried most all of the hair regrowth products only to later discover most of them were a scam and resulted in me losing more hair when there are actually only a couple things that do work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About Couvre:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is NOT a product that will help regrow your hair, but simply mask your thinning hair.  This will work well for both females and males.  Probably better for females since the more hair you have left, the better it works, so don&#x27;t cut your hair short or you will look silly!  It does take a little practice since you are basically putting makeup on your head, but once you get it down, man oh man will you be happy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I used it:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I typically used this product when I would go to yoga and I sweat A LOT!  Wet hair tends to make hair loss more apparent.  Otherwise I just stuck to Topic because, like all makeup, it can clog your pores resulting in zits!  If you don&#x27;t apply it properly it can run, but it wasn&#x27;t usually a problem once I got better at applying it.  Just don&#x27;t run your hands through your hair or let girls play with it a lot since you/they will smudge it resulting in black hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also used this in conjunction with [[ASIN:B000F5J24U Toppik Hair Loss, Thinning, Building Fibers 50 gm Black XLG]].  That stuff is also amazing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What really works for hair regrowth:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE read this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I mentioned, I tried everything, even the things that were almost obviously scams.  I now have a full head of hair and intend to do a video review with before and after pics.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Avodart is the only medicine I would recommend.  There is procerin and finasteride which are small and incredibly expensive prescriptions that do work, but the dosage is much too small if you do the research.  Avodart works many times better and costs significally less.  I order mind from Canada Drugs at a fraction of American prices.  This is also only available through prescription.  See, I am not endorsing a product I will profit from!  The dosage is only available in 0.5 mg pills, even though research shows 2.5 mg is the ideal dosage for hair loss.  This drug is typically used to keep your prostate small (bonus!!!) so you will probably have to explain to your doctor why you are requesting this drug.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The over the counter topical drugs have shown to work, but only at the crown of the head and the amount of regrowth is hardly worth the oily scalp and other side effects.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now... the other treatment I have undergone is actually plastic surgery.  I have had two hair transplants costing me a little over $10,000.  I am incredibly satisfied and would do it again in a heartbeat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please don&#x27;t get scammed.  The sooner you get on Avodart the sooner you can start regrowing your hair.  It can only recover up the the amount of hair you have lost in the past 5 years or less so seriously, it&#x27;s not something you can wait on if you are serious about keeping your hair.</li>
    <li> I have been ordering this product online for a few years now and I love it. I honestly cannot find anything like it to make my hair look way thicker and fuller. I have andorgentic alopecia and as a woman it is an awful thing when you can see your scalp because your hair is so thin- but this really darkens your scalp and gives the illusion of full hair. And it doesn&#x27;t wash off if you go swim or workout etc- only with shampoo! I would recommend you use it with the hair expander if you do have very thin hair.</li>
    <li> Messy, smells, and reminds me of paint. Some might find this useful; I did not. Dermatch provides a much better coverage method that is far less messy and odor-free. I threw mine out after using it twice. I also found using Loreal Smoldering Eyeliner pencils to give better coverage for small balding areas. http://www.amazon.com/LOreal-Paris-Voluminous-Smoldering-Eyeliner/dp/B005EIIAPA/ref&#x3D;sr_1_1?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1409845564&amp;sr&#x3D;8-1&amp;keywords&#x3D;l%27oreal+smoldering+eyeliner</li>
    <li> Good product!  Arrived quickly.</li>
    <li> You certainly get the coverage with this product but I didn&#x27;t enjoy using a cream.  Personal preference but it stayed on very well and didn&#x27;t see any transferance.</li>
    <li> I use this product as my base for toppik hair fibers. Couvre is great to cover up the skin that shows through the hair and is water proof so I can use my hair gels,grease, and oils. So what I do is pull the hair away from the bald spot and cover the bare skin with couvre. Then I use my hair products and brush/comb to style the hair. Then I go ahead and use my toppik hair fibers to make it natural. And after that I spray over it with hairspray to keep in place. I have very thin edges and have not been able to wear my hair straight back in a ponytail in years. Now I am confident and bald spots are gone. My best friend could not even tell that I had used a product and she was 2 inches from my scalp lol.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a healthy, vibrant, young at heart 64 year old &amp; 90 per cent of my hair on top is gone. I use three products that give me back all my hair naturally &amp; make me feel great (med dark brown color for all four):&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;. HAIR COLOR (ex: Just for Men)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;. COUVRE: Apply to bare part of scalp  after coloring, washing &amp; drying your hair. Use foam apllicator from \\&quot;middle\\&quot; of bald area and move to edges as there&#x27;s less left as you get there (so it&#x27;s not obvious). This will give scalp 70 per cent of color opaqueness needed &amp; take shine off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;. TOPPIK Hair Fiber: Right after the above step, hold about 4 inches from scalp &amp; shake on light sprinkle of hair fibers on top of scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;. HAIR SPRAY lightly where fibers were applied. This strongly limits color rubbing off on sheets, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Voila: You set the clock back 10 years. My confidence is sky high when I do this. If you want to keep the look for several days or even a week, use a do-rag at bedtime, or sleep on a brown-colored pillow case. Occasionally, touch up by sprinkling fibers where needed. Works best when you have some hair on acalp -- but don&#x27;t need much.  Otherwise, a little color may come off on pillowcase (very little though).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cannot live without it. Absolutely love it!!! Won&#x27;t leave home without it.</li>
    <li> Have been using it for many years. You obviously need some hair for it to look good especially if you combine it with Toppix hair building fibers</li>
    <li> It would be great but, the smell is just awful and people near me could smell it</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used the product for many years and it&#x27;s an excellent product for what it intent is. You can also use a combination of Toppik with it and provide even better results.  The seller shipped quickly, product was just as I ordered, good price and well worth the experience.</li>
    <li> I am rating this a 3. Dont get me wrong it is a good product and does do what it advertises. Please keep in mind this product is for people with minimal to medium hairloss. If you have a big gaping baldspot in the back like I do it will not work.. You will be able to tell you are wearing goo in your hair. So I took advice from another reviewer of this product and use toppik and couvre at the same time. Which works.. you cannot tell i have anything in my hair.&lt;br /&gt;The reason I gave it a 3 was because it is very MESSY more so than toppik. It is somewhat waterproof. I can go a day w/o washing my hair and I just rinse it under the faucet some couvre will rinse out but most of it stays and adds body and covers the thinning area decently. However they give you this HUGE @ss sponge to apply it.. I usually apply a drop to my finger tip and massage it in and then wash my hands and then let it dry while I am finishing my other cosmetic stuff in the bathroom .&lt;br /&gt;this would be ok for just touching up roots but when you have a big patch to cover it gets a little gummy and weighs your hair down and when it dries it does have a bit of a dry feel to it and your hair lacks luster.. I do make up for this however by getting shine spray by garnier which helps. Now I am going to try dermmatch. I just placed the order tonight so I will see how that works.</li>
    <li> Works ok. Can be messy.</li>
    <li> I found this product works very well.  It covers the area without being obvious.  I love it and will certainly be using it again once I run out.  This product lasts a  very long time.</li>
    <li> For anyone losing their hair, this is a humble way to keep it to yourself. Some days you are only so brave.</li>
    <li> Great product, which does a good job of hiding thinning area. I have used this product for about a year and plan to continue using it as long as it is practical.</li>
    <li> I have very thin hair in spots and a hairdresser recommended this as a method of camoflauge.  You rub it on the scalp and it washes out with shampoo.  It never runs or stains pillowcases and it really helps hide the thin spots.</li>
    <li> The color does not match as well as other products I have tried in dark brown.  My hair loss is right at the top of my head and you have to make sure you put it on very evenly or else it looks very fake.  I prefer the hair fiber products for my hair</li>
    <li> Great product, works very well with Toppiks powder.  Easy to apply and will stand up to rain.  Washes off easily with shampoo.</li>
    <li> My hair has been thinning since I was 25 years old and now my hairline is very thin. I&#x27;ve tried X-Fusion, Toppik, Dermmatch, Jerome Russell hairspray and Couvre.  The ones that work best for me were X-Fusion and Couvre, which I use them both together.  It&#x27;s easier to wet the sponge when applying the Couvre, as you can use more of the lotion in the bald areas. Then I add a little X-Fusion to add body and extra coverage.  Overall, I haven&#x27;t had any problems in the rain or swimming. I will order it again.</li>
    <li> Always good. Leaves behind some shine though. Wish they would tweak the formula to leave a matte finish.</li>
    <li> I usually wear small size, clothes. I took a chance to order xs just because some scrubs are one size bigger than my clothes.  Well it all worked out.  It feels comfortable and pants doesn&#x27;t fit too low nor high.  I will order this brand again.</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t cover the bald patch on my head. Most of the masking lotion was absorbed by the sponge applicator. It is still obvious that I am missing a patch of hair on my head. :( was really hoping this would work.</li>
    <li> Best option without paying a lot for hair transplants.</li>
    <li> Couvre is a good product. It come with a sponge applicator, which makes covering a large area of the scalp a breeze. Any excess is easily wiped away. DermaMatch got too expensive and dried out easily. Couvre is liquid and comes in a resealable tube, so drying out isn&#x27;t an issue. I will buy this product again and spend A LOT less.</li>
    <li> I am using a powder that I like better.  I thought I would try this but I would not buy it again. Way too pricy.</li>
    <li> It really does a good job at concealing the areas in question and easy to apply I recommend it very much !!!</li>
    <li> Wish it wouldn&#x27;t rub off. Can&#x27;t hug anyone without it getting on people. Embarrassing!</li>
    <li> This produce works very well, as it is intended.  It may be over priced, so I can&#x27;t say it is the best at this time.</li>
    <li> This works great to hide my bright scalp of my thinning hair. I use hair fibers on top of this product to give a fuller look.</li>
