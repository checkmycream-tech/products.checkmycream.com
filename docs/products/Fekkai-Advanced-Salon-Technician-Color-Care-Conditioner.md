      <li>Before buying, I debated spending so much on this Technician shampoo/conditioner, but the \\&quot;Best of Sephora\\&quot; award convinced me to spend the money to try them.   </li>

      <li>This is by far the best conditioner I have ever used.  </li>

      <li>The price tag was pretty hefty and it didn&#x27;t do that great of a job.</li>
      <li>It is a bit pricey, but buy the 16oz bottle...only $10 more than the 8oz bottle</li>
      <li>I cannot say enough good things about this conditioner--it truly is the miracle worker that everybody says it is!!  </li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m madly in love . . .</li>
      <li>&quot; I just switched back to the world&#x27;s best shampoo and conditioner.</li>
      <li>It also has waaaay more body.</li>
      <li>This the best result I&#x27;ve gotten with any hair products and I&#x27;ve tried countless.</li>
      <li>Personally I love the smell as it stays with you all day.  </li>
      <li>It has helped with about 40% of the split ends and my hair does look a bit more shiny.</li>
      <li>and I wouldn&#x27;t be able to tell.  </li>
      <li>It did not make my hair any better</li>
      <li>I have been using the Technician shampoo and conditioner for months now, and my hair has never been better.  </li>
      <li>My hair feels stronger, thicker, more shinny and incredibly healthy.  </li>
      <li>I love my hair</li>
      <li>bottles their $10 more than the 8oz.</li>
      <li>She has been using it for six weeks in the hopes that her hair will start looking better.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s rich but not heavy, makes my hair feel great even with washing every day, and smells nice too.  </li>
      <li>The shampoo also has a decent lather, unlike most pricey ones, and the conditioner has good coverage.</li>
      <li>From the first time I used them on my chemically-treated, split-end infested hair, I could not stop touching it!</li>
      <li>&amp; I know my hair will not only smell great (love the smell) but</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s also naturally wavy, but not the nice kind of waves...</li>
      <li>I am 49, fine hair but lots of it.  </li>
      <li>I have shoulder-length, fine hair.</li>
      <li>My hair is SO smooth.</li>
      <li>This product is fantastic.  </li>
      <li>Although this time I am going to skip the matching shampoo and use a sulfate free one.</li>
      <li>but this is totally worth the money:)</li>
      <li>TOTALLY worth the money!</li>
      <li>Even more notable, my husband, who doesn&#x27;t notice anything of this caliber until it smacks him upside the head, said \\&quot;Wow, your hair looks great!\\&quot; TWICE!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s perfectly conditioned and manageable, but after a week, same old blah!</li>
      <li>And the conditioner is rich, but rinses clean.   </li>
      <li>Also it has a very nice light frangrance that does not bother my friends who are frangrance sensative due to alergies.</li>
      <li>I also really like Fekkai&#x27;s Top Coat...</li>
      <li>My hair is full of life, body and shine.</li>
      <li>Good hair days were back again!</li>
      <li>The 8 oz bottles will go quick.</li>
      <li>but this conditioner makes it MUCH more soft and smooth.  </li>
      <li>I have not seen a split end since my last hair cut 2 months ago, and my highlights still look amazing.  </li>
      <li>Totally worth a try.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Background: I&#x27;m 40, have longer fine but decent amount of color-treated &amp; highlighted somewhat wavy hair &amp; because of a color snafu months ago my hair is stressed &amp; in some places I&#x27;ve even had some breakage..</li>
      <li>From the first few seconds of using the shampoo, to being actually able to run my fingers all the way through my hair with the conditioner, this product is amazing.</li>
      <li>I went right out &amp; bought it</li>
      <li>right after it&#x27;s color treated.</li>
      <li>I even tried my old conditioner and then the new kind</li>
      <li>Also, what&#x27;s important to me is that this shampoo and conditioner SMELLS GOOD, which is a big deal considering that most in this price range and above, especially restorative ones, smell like puke!    </li>
      <li>Normally, I have to spray special conditioners in my hair to get a brush through it with out screaming.  </li>
      <li>and I was very depressed about it!.  </li>
      <li>Definitely buying more.</li>
      <li>It is finally growing out without so many split ends.  </li>
      <li>and you get twice as much (and it lasts forever)!  </li>
      <li>more like a cross between a clown&#x27;s wig and  armpit hair.</li>
      <li>What&#x27;s funny is that I stopped using this conditioner after I ran out of the first bottle because it is quite pricey, but when I looked back at pictures of my hair while I was using it, I couldn&#x27;t believe how healthy and shiny it looked.</li>
      <li>Overall, I rate this product 5 stars, it is fabulous and if you have ever colored or heat-styled your hair, this is an absolute must-have!!</li>
      <li>The price is moderately high but defintely worth it.</li>
      <li>it is now pretty much fried</li>
      <li>It never feels squeaky when I&#x27;m washing it, and it is incredibly soft and full after styling.  </li>
      <li>I strongly suggest trying this product &amp; hopefully you have the same outcome I do.  </li>
      <li>I thought this conditioner would make a huge different</li>
      <li>This is a great hair day in a bottle everyday and I am only about 2 weeks into mine.</li>
      <li>and it doesn&#x27;t hold style very well.  </li>
      <li>once my hair was totally different:  smooth, shiny, and bouncy.  </li>
      <li>I really like this conditioner.</li>
      <li>I purchased this conditioner after reading the reviews because my post menopausal hair had really started looking damaged.  </li>
      <li>It has never felt this smooth in my entire life.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s much softer now and is regaining shine.  </li>
      <li>(&amp; I don&#x27;t use much anyway</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t need to use a detangler anymore because my hair is tangle-free straight from the shower.  </li>
      <li>This size is only available on line.  </li>
      <li>I am interested if I will get the same results when the humidity is full force in the summer...</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> What&#x27;s funny is that I stopped using this conditioner after I ran out of the first bottle because it is quite pricey, but when I looked back at pictures of my hair while I was using it, I couldn&#x27;t believe how healthy and shiny it looked. I can&#x27;t wait to start using it again!! Although this time I am going to skip the matching shampoo and use a sulfate free one. I totally recommend this!!!</li>
    <li> I have been using the Technician shampoo and conditioner for months now, and my hair has never been better.  I was having a very bad hair phase where it always seemed squeaky in the shower and very dull, flat, and limp after blow-drying.  I was using other salon products for color-treated hair at the time, but the bad hair persisted.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;After using the FF products, my hair has completely changed.  It never feels squeaky when I&#x27;m washing it, and it is incredibly soft and full after styling.  I have not seen a split end since my last hair cut 2 months ago, and my highlights still look amazing.  My colorist even commented on their longevity.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Basically, I can&#x27;t imagine using anything but this shampoo and conditioner ever again.  It&#x27;s rich but not heavy, makes my hair feel great even with washing every day, and smells nice too.  It&#x27;s solved my hair problems.  I think the Technician Glaze is great too to add extra shine; I like to put a little extra on my ends in the winter to fight static and dry air.</li>
    <li> I have hair that&#x27;s been dyed over and over and usually looks like a shag with extra frizz. I read the reviews of Frederic Fekkai but was intimidated by the price. I gave it a whirl and WOW. From the first few seconds of using the shampoo, to being actually able to run my fingers all the way through my hair with the conditioner, this product is amazing. I highly recommend it to those who are in constant search for shampoos and conditioners that make your hair look and feel salon fabulous. It truly works!</li>
    <li> [[VIDEOID:16006971]]Jean Yates, Amazon Vine Reviewer and author of Links, a jewelry design book which is coming out in January 2008, reviews the Frederic Fekkai Shampoo for dry damaged colored treated hair--all of which she has! And the Frederic Fekkai Technician Conditioner as well! This product is fantastic.  She has been using it for six weeks in the hopes that her hair will start looking better. And it DOES!</li>
    <li> No joke, this is honestly the best shampoo and conditioner I have used. I have been double processing my hair for the past two years. The bleach was killing my hair and my hair looked frizzy and lifeless. I was using Keratase Chroma until it ran out. The price tag was pretty hefty and it didn&#x27;t do that great of a job. I purchased this shampoo/conditioner 7 days ago and my hair condition has changed dramatically. I have had everyone tell me my hair looks great. The price is moderately high but defintely worth it. Buy the 16 oz. bottles their $10 more than the 8oz. The 8 oz bottles will go quick.</li>
    <li> I really like this conditioner. A little goes a long long way. Most other conditioners weighed down my hair or left it so baby fine that it was flat after blow drying. This conditioner is perfect! My hair is easy to style and it shines like crazy. I first bought the smallest size they make of this product and after using the entire bottle, I KNEW that this is the product for me. Now I can condition my hair and still have shine and body!</li>
    <li> My hair is color treated and dry. It&#x27;s also naturally wavy, but not the nice kind of waves...more like a cross between a clown&#x27;s wig and  armpit hair. For as long as I can remember, I&#x27;ve been using at least a palm-sized amount of conditioner in my hair, just to get it to lay flat. I have to wash it every day, because otherwise I look like a grease monster, which led to damage from hair dryers, flat irons, etc. My hair routine is typically a vicious cycle of sorts.&lt;br /&gt;I tried Fekkai on a whim, not really believing it would work. Even though I scoffed at the thought of only using a quarter-sized amount of conditioner, I did it anyway because this stuff is sort of expensive. I was really shocked at the amazing results I got from using this conditioner with the Fekkai glossing cream. My hair is SO smooth. I can&#x27;t stop running my fingers through it. I don&#x27;t mean to sound like some corny commercial, but I feel like \\&quot;I just left the salon\\&quot; or whatever.&lt;br /&gt;I bought the smallest size of this, since I didn&#x27;t know whether it would work, but I am definitely going to get the largest size as soon as the original bottle starts to run out.</li>
    <li> i have tried many hair products but the frederick fekkai technician line is the best for consistently good hair days, day after day. i have very fine, highlighted hair and it used to be very dry and never 2 good days in a row.  since using frederick fekkai technician shampoo/conditioner, its been a no-brainer and i can even let my hair dry naturally and it still looks great for work! also recommend the glossing cream as i keep a bit in a container in my bag to smooth through during the day or before going out at night - smells great. i always get compliments on it and you can even use it on your skin for a great smelling moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I wanted to try this product for over 4 years but just couldn&#x27;t justify the cost.  Finally, I broke down and bought the travel size of the shampoo and conditioner and there was just no going back.  Normally, I have to spray special conditioners in my hair to get a brush through it with out screaming.  I washed my hair, let it dry and then brushed it and had hardly any resistance.  My hair feels stronger, thicker, more shinny and incredibly healthy.  I can&#x27;t stop touching it!  I used to have to wash my hair every day and now I could go a day or two if I had to and I wouldn&#x27;t be able to tell.  I feel like a hair model!  I instantly got compliments on my hair from friends that didn&#x27;t even know I had switched.  This is ridiculously expensive and I&#x27;ll have to adjust my budget somewhere but I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ll ever give it up!</li>
    <li> I have long straight hair which isn&#x27;t too damaged but can be dry and I get lots of split ends. I thought this conditioner would make a huge different but I&#x27;ve been using it for 2 weeks now and I have to say it&#x27;s been kinda disappointing. It has helped with about 40% of the split ends and my hair does look a bit more shiny. But with the price paid, I expected a bit more than this (more hydration, less breakage). May be I had too high of an expectation. Would come back to other reasonably priced products after finishing this bottle.</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome.  Makes your hair softer than anything.  I even tried my old conditioner and then the new kind the next to see if I could feel the difference, and I can.</li>
    <li> This is by far the best conditioner I have ever used.  I have been dyeing my hair for years and it is now pretty much fried but this conditioner makes it MUCH more soft and smooth.  It is finally growing out without so many split ends.  I would reccommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> I have long curly hair that tends to be dry and picky. This is a great hair day in a bottle everyday and I am only about 2 weeks into mine. Definitely buying more. Well worth the extra $$$</li>
    <li> My hair looks fuller, softer, and shinier when I use this conditioner. It also has waaaay more body. I used this conditioner, along with the Technician Shampoo, a few years ago after receiving it as a gift; I always got lots of compliments on my hair then. Because of the price, I bought something less expensive, but not cheap, when I finished the bottle. Instantly my hair looked less full and wasn&#x27;t quite as manageable and I had my first bad hair day in a long while. After finishing that other brand (it starts and ends with an \\&quot;A\\&quot; and is famous for its natural ingredients) I broke down and bought bottles of the Fekkai Technician Shampoo and Technician Conditioner. Glorious! Good hair days were back again! Other people notice as well and I&#x27;m still getting those standard questions, \\&quot;did you get a haircut?\\&quot; or \\&quot;did you color your hair?\\&quot; \\&quot;Nope\\&quot; and \\&quot;not recently,\\&quot; I just switched back to the world&#x27;s best shampoo and conditioner.</li>
    <li> I was looking to try a new conditioner and came to read the reviews on the Fekkai Technician Conditioner.  All of ther reviewers gave 5 stars and claimed that this conditioner is a miracle worker, so I decided to give it a try.  While my hair has never been awful, I color it and use quite a bit of heat on it, so the ends get a little frayed and it doesn&#x27;t hold style very well.  Since I started using the Fekkai conditioner, my hair is like silk.  It has never felt this smooth in my entire life.  I don&#x27;t need to use a detangler anymore because my hair is tangle-free straight from the shower.  It also holds styles much better (no need to douse it in hairspray!) and my hair even looks good after I sleep on it!!  I cannot say enough good things about this conditioner--it truly is the miracle worker that everybody says it is!!  It is a bit pricey, but buy the 16oz bottle...only $10 more than the 8oz bottle and you get twice as much (and it lasts forever)!  Overall, I rate this product 5 stars, it is fabulous and if you have ever colored or heat-styled your hair, this is an absolute must-have!!</li>
    <li> I have used this hair conditioner for about a year and it&#x27;s the best stuff out there. My hair is longer than it has ever been and it keeps my hair from being damaged and it makes my hair color last longer. Strongly recommended! Also it has a very nice light frangrance that does not bother my friends who are frangrance sensative due to alergies.</li>
    <li> I have shoulder-length, fine hair. Before buying, I debated spending so much on this Technician shampoo/conditioner, but the \\&quot;Best of Sephora\\&quot; award convinced me to spend the money to try them.   These products are made for color-treated hair (which I have) and protect the color.     Well, I absolutely LOVE them both!  They do not flatten my fine hair down, and my hair really does look thicker and shinier.  Plus, both the shampoo and conditioner are so creamy and rich, you only need to use a tablespoon or so each time you apply.  The shampoo lathers up immediately, with only a small amount.  And the conditioner is rich, but rinses clean.   Due to my hair type, I need to shampoo daily or my hair looks flat.  Again, these products are protective, but don&#x27;t flatten out my hair.  I&#x27;m in love! TOTALLY worth the money!</li>
    <li> This particular shampoo and conditioner are, in all honesty, the best shampoo and conditioner I&#x27;ve ever used. From the first time I used them on my chemically-treated, split-end infested hair, I could not stop touching it! It was softer, smoother, and shinier then it had been in a long time!     Even more notable, my husband, who doesn&#x27;t notice anything of this caliber until it smacks him upside the head, said \\&quot;Wow, your hair looks great!\\&quot; TWICE! BEFORE I even said anything to him!    The shampoo also has a decent lather, unlike most pricey ones, and the conditioner has good coverage. A little goes a long way. Also, what&#x27;s important to me is that this shampoo and conditioner SMELLS GOOD, which is a big deal considering that most in this price range and above, especially restorative ones, smell like puke!    I&#x27;ve only been using this stuff for a week and I&#x27;m madly in love . . . we&#x27;ll see what the future brings!</li>
    <li> I purchased this conditioner after reading the reviews because my post menopausal hair had really started looking damaged.  I am 49, fine hair but lots of it.  I have my hair highlighted professionally about 6 times a year and I blow dry it every day.  I purchased only because I had a gift certificate to cover the cost (also purchased the shampoo) from the Sephora store.  Also, they said I could return it if it did not work.         Well, I have been using this since Oct 1 and I still have about and inch or so reamining of the conditioner.  It is the best conditioner I have ever, ever used and I have tried many!!  Use sparingly, you did need a lot.  Made my hair as amooth as silk and others have commented on how great my hair looks. Being a Spehora insider, I received a $15 off a $50 purchase pre-Chirstmas so I purchased the 32 oz size conditioner which I expect to last 8-9 months.  This size is only available on line.  I don&#x27;t plan on purchasing the shampoo again due to the cost.  Although it was good I don&#x27;t think it keep my color from fading and I can&#x27;t justify the cost of both.  I have tried the conditioner with other shampoos with the same spectacular results.          I am interested if I will get the same results when the humidity is full force in the summer...I&#x27;ll update the review then.        If you are worried about the cost try the travel size and see if this works for you.</li>
    <li> This range of products has completely changed my daily life. My hair is full of life, body and shine. I used to have to wash my hair every morning beofre the school run but since using the FF range of shampoo, conditioner and styling products my haiar lasts for 3 days!! The condition of my hair is totally different. Only problem is it costs about $35 a bottle over here!! TRY IT</li>
    <li> I tried this product out of total desperation.  I am mean to my hair, I have it permed, I have it colored and I also highlight it on a regular basis.  The abuse was beginning to show and I was very depressed about it!.  I longed for shiny, healthy-looking hair.  This product was recommended by a friend.  So far I have tried only the conditioner, but it&#x27;s so amazing that after only a few uses, I saw an improvement in my hair.  It&#x27;s much softer now and is regaining shine.  These products are expensive, but I find that I only need to use a fraction of what I use with those cheaper products.</li>
    <li> i was so intimidated by the Fekkai products, they are SO expensive, i was afraid to get something that didn&#x27;t work (a SHAM-poo) i bought a small bottle of this conditioner at Sephora for $8, a splurge, but if it didn&#x27;t work i wouln&#x27;t have paid $20 and i wouldn&#x27;t be stuck with the big bottle. It smells great and doen&#x27;t have that super greasy feeling most conditioners have. It left my hair incredibly soft. Totally worth a try.</li>
    <li> &lt;br /&gt;I was using a product that begins with a B- my hairdresser uses this line and talked me into buying it. It did not make my hair any better it was tangled- and made my scalp tingly- not in a good way- but then I saw oprah and decided to try Fekka &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I have very thick hair- and I wear it long which leads to tangles- not with this- this stuff is great!!! My hair is soft, voluminous, and shiney. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I know that the best things in life are free- but this is totally worth the money:)</li>
    <li> I used to have frazzled, dull hair that was breaking off from years of highlighting. After using this conditioner (and the FF shampoo) once my hair was totally different:  smooth, shiny, and bouncy.  now my hair looks like it did as a kid, before i became a highlight junkie.  and it does all this without being greasy/heavy, like a lot of the other conditioners designed for damaged hair. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;this is by far the best shampoo/conditioner combo i have ever used.  i just wish it wasn&#x27;t so expensive!</li>
    <li> I use the Frederic Fekkai conditioner as well as the hair repair mask and the two work wonders on my dry hair. I got my hair permed a while back and thought I would never see soft, shiny hair again until it grew out. Using this conditioner and the mask has done wonders. Personally I love the smell as it stays with you all day.  I am very sensitive to odors and cannot stand overbearing scents, so finding something that I can tolerate is a plus for me. I have had people tell me my hair smells great.</li>
    <li> Wow.  I receieved a sample of this from a major department store purchase or I probably never would&#x27;ve tried it, I think I had a sample of Fekkai&#x27;s glossing something &amp; it was too heavy so I didn&#x27;t bother to try their other products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Background: I&#x27;m 40, have longer fine but decent amount of color-treated &amp; highlighted somewhat wavy hair &amp; because of a color snafu months ago my hair is stressed &amp; in some places I&#x27;ve even had some breakage..ugh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a certified product junkie...I regularly Nioxin, Alterna, Matrix, Artec Kiwi, It&#x27;s a 10, Paul Mitchell &amp; Pureology (even the Purelogy Nano which is BIG $).  Well I used this conditioner, combed it through in the shower &amp; left in on for about 3 minutes &amp; holy cr*p what 12 yr olds virgin hair was this on my head?? I went right out &amp; bought it &amp; yes, it is more expensive but I reach for it over the 5-10 other previously mentioned products on my shelf-I said I was a junkie (&amp; I don&#x27;t use much anyway so I think that offsets the $) &amp; I know my hair will not only smell great (love the smell) but also I will be having a good hair day.  Maybe it&#x27;s the condition of my hair, my water, the moon...I dunno &amp; I don&#x27;t care.  Of course I will switch conditioners (Lord knows I have enough products to do that) once or twice a week but this will be my main conditioner for sure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Side note:  I also really like Fekkai&#x27;s Top Coat...I use that along w/a couple of Sprays of Matrix Biolage Shine Milk &amp; I&#x27;m good to blow the heck out of my hair then abuse my poor hair w/my big curling iron &amp; my hair doesn&#x27;t seem to suffer from all of the heat.  I may try the hairspray too once I run out of the dozen or so different bottles I have so I can justify it.  I strongly suggest trying this product &amp; hopefully you have the same outcome I do.  Best of luck.</li>
    <li> I was a little skeptical even after reading the reviews so I purchased  2 ounces to give it a try. I love my hair right after it&#x27;s color treated. It&#x27;s perfectly conditioned and manageable, but after a week, same old blah! My hair was color treated two weeks ago, and I tried the conditioner last night. This morning my hair looks and feels like I just stepped out of the salon. This the best result I&#x27;ve gotten with any hair products and I&#x27;ve tried countless. I&#x27;m sold on this one and want to try the shampoo next.</li>
