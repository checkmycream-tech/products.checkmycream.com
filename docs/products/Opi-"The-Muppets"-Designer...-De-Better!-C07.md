      <li>and I liked the results so much that I rushed out and bought a bottle shortly after.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s heavy enough to where it is best worn by itself (no under coat shade required).</li>

      <li>Nail polish very running, watery.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Got it during a pedicure at the nail salon and loved it. I tend to buy all the colors that I absolutely love, so now I have about half a dozen in rotation that can&#x27;t go wrong. This one is spectacular perfect for beach toes. It has a casual/nude-color vibe, but also some sparkly purple-tastic tones for dressing up.</li>
    <li> This color goes on wonderfully and it really pops! It reminds me a little bit of aluminum foil in a way, but it&#x27;s super pretty. I paired this one with the Muppets Devine swine and it was really pretty. Overall I love this color! Highly Recommended!</li>
    <li> I originally saw this polish at the nail salon I go to.  The color is great and so appealing.  I&#x27;ve gotten a lot of compliments on it.  I know it says Holiday but I think you can use it anytime.  You do have to rub a little harder to get it off because it has a glitter in it.  Other than that enjoy.</li>
    <li> Got this color in the Muppets box set as well and it&#x27;s just fantastic! The color is shimmery and not overdone, and it looks just fantastic with any outfit. It doesn&#x27;t wear off very quickly and the color goes on really evenly with only 2-3 coats. Very feminine and a total must for this holiday season :)</li>
    <li> Got this as part of the muppets OPI collection...love it!  So pretty and shimmery with great coverage.  All the muppets colors are good but this one is extra special.  It sparkles and shines and looks great.  Lots of compliments!</li>
    <li> Love OPI.&lt;br /&gt;Great Colors-Sometimes I&lt;br /&gt;wish you could buy Designer Series&lt;br /&gt;for a longer period of time. I don&#x27;t like&lt;br /&gt;to pay more than $11 for polish. But I&lt;br /&gt;do like their colors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you,</li>
    <li> This nail polish is great so far. It goes on very smoothly and come out really nicely. It&#x27;s sheer, so you definitely want two coats to make it pop. It&#x27;s a sparkly, metallic champagne color that I and all of my friends find gorgeous :)Like I said, it&#x27;s very metallic and one coat is very sheer. This may deter some people, but I would definitely recommend this purchase for a fun, subtle color!</li>
    <li> I like this color but like it better over another color for a slight added \\&quot;pop.\\&quot;. Alone is too metallic for my taste.</li>
    <li> This is one of those polishes that you just shut up, pay the cost, and get ready to receive compliments on your nails everywhere you go.  I *LUUURVE* this polish, it&#x27;s my favorite hands down, I never want to be without it, I wear it all year, and I will wear it forever.  Did I  mention that I love this polish?</li>
    <li> I almost sang w/ glee when I opened d package this came in....lolol. D color is vibrant n I luv it! I knew it wud av been a nice color but it exceeded my expectations. This has become 1 of my faves.</li>
    <li> I originally got this nail polish in the OPI mini-Muppets holiday set for Christmas. I didn&#x27;t try this color until March, and I&#x27;m sorry I didn&#x27;t!! I love the color!! It&#x27;s like a shimmery-champagne silver with tiny pink specks that glimmer in the light. I just had to buy a full bottle, this color is gorgeous!!</li>
    <li> Love the Designer De Better polish from \\&quot;The Muppets\\&quot; 2011 Holiday collection.  This neutral color works well intermingled with \\&quot;Getting Miss Piggy With It\\&quot; on alternate fingers.  Planning on buying several more bottles.  K Beauty Supply shipped my order fast, fast, fast!</li>
    <li> I had a manicure recently using this color and I liked the results so much that I rushed out and bought a bottle shortly after. It&#x27;s amazing!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The color is a silvery gold with tiny pink sparkles. Very creamy and smooth and shimmery. If I had to give it a name it would be champagne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It only takes two coats to get nice opaque coverage and it looks amazing on it&#x27;s own or when used for nail art.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This color will not disappoint!</li>
    <li> I love the OPI Muppets Collection and this is one of my favorites! It&#x27;s a gorgeous metallic light taupe, that you can easily wear any of the Muppets glitters over. Two coats over a base coat then a top coat, it lasts for over a week. This is one of the prettiest colors I&#x27;ve seen in a long time &amp; I get many compliments on it!!</li>
    <li> Love this color. It is a cool unexpected thick silver. Really great color on toes. Almost translucent but not really.</li>
    <li> This is a fabulous color for any occasion and it ALWAYS makes you look like you have a tan.  I recommend it to anyone.  It goes on smooth and two coats is perfect for an opaque finish.</li>
    <li> A beautiful mix of gold, silver, and a little hint of copper.  Shimmers and changes tones in different lights.  A favorite for the holidays.</li>
    <li> Beautiful color. It&#x27;s one of my favorites</li>
    <li> Perfect color to go with everything! Is a light champagne color created by fine white &amp; pin/red sparkles. Very satisfied with my purchase.</li>
    <li> OMG i love this polish i missed the Muppets collection and i really liked this color so i ordered from amazon and shipping was crazy fast it was three days and i love the color its like a rose gold and i love it.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this color, especially for toe nails. It also looks great on all ages and all skin tones. Definitely get some before it&#x27;s no longer available.</li>
    <li> This was my absolute favourite colour from the collection.  It&#x27;s a gorgeous metallic champagne with finely-milled red glitter.  Absolutely beautiful and perfect for the holidays.  Delivery took some time but I would definitely purchase from this seller again.</li>
    <li> beautiful color..goes with everything</li>
    <li> I get SO many compliments on this color. It&#x27;s an iridescent, silvery color but isn&#x27;t sheer.  It&#x27;s great for holidays, the beach, and everyday.  If it starts to wear after several days, you can go right over the top and not notice that you&#x27;ve touched it up.  Most colors you can see the edges of the old and new coat, but not with this.  It is a little difficult to get off, but Cutex makes a 2x stronger nail polish remover that works great on this polish.</li>
    <li> Pretty pricey,but I had 2 have it. My favorite.</li>
    <li> i discovered \\&quot;designer..de better\\&quot; in my local nail salon. immediately i came to amazon to buy it. this is my absolute favorite nail color, it is a cross between silver and blush pink. i am actually using it on my wedding day :) :) i bought 2 bottles just in case OPI discontinues it!!</li>
    <li> So pretty! Smooth, long lasting, just brilliant. I wish it weren&#x27;t a limited collection polish. OPI should put it in the regular rotation.</li>
    <li> ripped off 24 dollar is aouregous. Nail polish very running, watery. Don&#x27;t trust this seller.</li>
    <li> This is such a gorgeous color! If I have a special event to go to, this is what I wear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It goes on very smoothly, and makes my nails look amazing. It&#x27;s shimmery, sparkly, and has a nice feminine feel to it (without needing to be pink!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely in my top five favorite OPI colors of all time.</li>
    <li> I love the Muppets Collection by OPI! They are some of my favorite shades - they&#x27;re excellent for the Holiday season, dressing up for special occasions like birthdays, or anytime. This particular color has a tiny hint of bronze to it, sort of a platinum bronze with small sparkles. It&#x27;s heavy enough to where it is best worn by itself (no under coat shade required). I recently experimented with putting a larger colorful glitter polish over Designer...De Better! &amp; it turned out great! To me, this was the perfect New Year&#x27;s combo. Designer...De Better is also good for if you wan the color and sparkle of jewelry, yet don&#x27;t want to wear a ring on your fingers. I&#x27;d recommend this nail polish to anyone who is looking for a somewhat subtle and classy, yet sparkly/shimmering color.</li>
    <li> Love this polish!!!!! Its the perfect color that goes with every type of event from morning to night. It appeared to be new and unused &amp; I received my order like 2 days after ordering. Of course this made me even more pleased. I am super happy with my purchase I wish they had another bottle because i would have ordered both. Thanks for making this easy.</li>
    <li> This is a perfect color and goes with everything. I have gotten many compliments. Great for the holidays but also good everyday color. Glides on nicely and wears well. Stays on longer than any nail polish I have!</li>
    <li> Love Love Love Opi. Great consistency, easy to apply, professional finish and very long lasting. Put a top coat on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is such an amazing colour. - Silvery with the slightest touch of gold so could be worn with both. I wore it over Christmas and got heaps of compliments. Love it.</li>
    <li> Perfect bling for your fingernails! I get lots of compliments! It&#x27;s a pewter with a slight pink cast of glitter.</li>
    <li> This is a superfun silver polish, with silver microglitter, and little bits of pink and red microglitter for a surprisingly bright silver, with a kind of &amp;#34;sparks&amp;#34; effect from the reds...&lt;br /&gt;I used this the first time for a base coat, and was sad to paint over it...next time I&#x27;m going to wear it on it&#x27;s own...it has a fair amount of glitter going on, so I&#x27;d suggest using Q-tips rather than getting polish remover all over your fingertips with cotton balls, but whatever works!</li>
    <li> Totally Recomend this color! I wish it was available in stores... My favorite of the OPI line. I love it on my toes!</li>
    <li> My FAVORITE color of all time! I love the subtle hints of orange among all the silver! I use 2 coats.</li>
