      <li>I have shoulder length, baby fine hair, but as I am aging, I am getting salt and pepper hair growing in.  </li>
      <li>Quick, reliable, product as described. :)</li>
      <li>it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure:  I was given this product for free to test as a BzzAgent.</li>
      <li>It is very easy to use and tames my frizz in a way that no other product I&#x27;ve tried has been able to.</li>
      <li>I finally found something to allow my hair to curl instead of frizz when it gets damp, a nice mild hold for my very fine curly hair, but it seems to be discontinued</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s super light.</li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve tried a lot of different products, but so far, this one has been the best.</li>
      <li>(like I do), but please note that you&#x27;ll want to use a silicone-containing shampoo to clean this out of your hair, and it may make the hair resistant to taking curls/</li>
      <li>ideal for frizz on fine hair as it tames frizz without weighing hair down!!</li>
      <li>It is one of my absolute favorite serums.</li>
      <li>I tried this free because I am a BzzAgent, but it is well worth buying.</li>
      <li>, so I was glad to find some here on Amazon and ordered a whole bunch.</li>
      <li>It really helps with my fine, flyaway hair.  </li>
      <li>Most products are made for either fine hair or coarse hair, but not for both.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Nothing really worked without leaving my hair either super oily or super</li>
      <li>Was excited to find it on line works really well to keep hair shiny and not frizzy</li>
      <li>I have fine, wavy hair with a really oily scalp and live in a humid area.  </li>
      <li>I have tried many smoother products that work alright, but they still left a feeling of having product in my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Leaves my hair felling so soft and smooth and no frizzy ends.</li>
      <li>Someone at the factory needs to make sure the caps get screwed on properly.  </li>
      <li>I like this product because it keeps the hair at my part and crown soft and smooth.</li>
      <li>It was so smooth, but not heavy or greasy in the slightest.  </li>
      <li>My husband commented that my hair had a pretty look to it</li>
      <li>therefore I end up using way more than the frizzy ease in the red bottle.</li>
      <li>I get it at Wal-Mart for $8.97 plus tax, so the price on Amazon isn&#x27;t much higher with their Prime shipping and tax included.</li>
      <li>I have tried different products and the texture, most of the time, leaves my hair greasy and sticky.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried washing my hair very often, leading to frizz; I&#x27;ve tried just shampooing occasionally, with some combination of water only/conditioner/not touching it at all between shampoos; I&#x27;ve tried baking soda pastes.  </li>
      <li>The other Frizz-Ease formulas are too heavy for me, but this one&#x27;s perfect!</li>
      <li>It actually kept my hair frizz free through a 24 hour period where it rained, was humid, and I got pretty sweaty.</li>
      <li>Although the product showed some results on hair ends, it was largely ineffective for the frizz on the front.</li>
      <li>Solution needs to be applied to slightly towel dried hair for best results.</li>
      <li>While I received a sample of this product as a BzzAgent, I can assure you I&#x27;ll keep using and buying it as it really works for me!&lt;br</li>
      <li>when this offer came I was very intrigued.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Bottom line: I really like the results I get from using this product.</li>
      <li>Had to toss it entirely because you have to shake this stuff up before use and nearly all of the stuff that floated on top had been spilled.</li>
      <li>I am not liking this serum nearly as much as the original serum in the red bottle.</li>
      <li>the frizz I get after an intense workout is minimal, and it&#x27;s easy to get rid of it by just brushing again</li>
      <li>Regardless of whether I&#x27;ve styled it or simply let it dry on its own.</li>
      <li>Really leaves hair soft and manageable -- I use 10 drops and mix with a styling lotion and voila, it works</li>
      <li>But, it&#x27;s not damaging at all and does tame the frizz for the most part.</li>
      <li>I have had many experiences using product that was supposed to tame the frizzes.  </li>
      <li>The texture is thin and light leaving my hair smooth and silky.</li>
      <li>and I was so disappointed when it was discontinued, but this works great!  </li>
      <li>How exactly do you treat both at the same time?  </li>
      <li>While I color my hair to hide that, it doesn&#x27;t change the fact that coarser hairs are growing in with the fine ones, which results in an odd dilemma indeed.  </li>
      <li>I blew it dry, and right away I noticed how soft my hair felt and how shiny it looked.  </li>
      <li>do not waste your money on something you will not like</li>
      <li>My hair tends to get frizzy in any damp conditions, but Sheer Solutions really does the job to keep my frizzies under control.</li>
      <li>so it looked like it completely emulsified.  </li>
      <li>Leaves the hair soft, shiny and curly.</li>
      <li>sheer solution makes my hair straight, frizz is gone.</li>
      <li>So anyway, a lot of the natural oils have been stripped from my hair.</li>
      <li>The only time I need some kind of styling product is if I don&#x27;t let my hair dry enough before going to sleep, in which case it looks wacky from drying in weird positions on my pillow.</li>
      <li>It also does not give my hair the same nice silky texture at all, more of a greasy one; disappointed in this product.</li>
      <li>has normal, then mixed the Frizz-Ease</li>
      <li>the other hand, with the Frizz-Ease solution, my hair stays -- quite incredibly --  clean and frizz-free all day long.</li>
      <li>and I have a major frizz</li>
      <li>My hair is curly/wavy and frizzy like no other.</li>
      <li>The only complaint is that because it&#x27;s essentially straightening your hair, the rest of my hair is pretty limp and doesn&#x27;t hold a curl well in warm weather.</li>
      <li>I have fine hair and usually what happens is I am left with 1.</li>
      <li>(I know, some of you just died a little reading that), but about 15 minutes after showering I style my hair and then gently apply the Frizz Ease only to the surface.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have curly hair .  This is the best fizz tamer for fine hair</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s super light. Leaves the hair soft, shiny and curly. Some people flat-iron after it dries. I just leave it curly. I put about 1 Tbsp in my palms and rub it through, then comb. It goes on when you&#x27;re hair&#x27;s wet. I absolutely love this and recommend to my friends. The other Frizz-Ease formulas are too heavy for me, but this one&#x27;s perfect! I get it at Wal-Mart for $8.97 plus tax, so the price on Amazon isn&#x27;t much higher with their Prime shipping and tax included. At my Wal-Mart it&#x27;s in the regular shampoo isle (not in the salon). Not sure all the WMs would carry it, though.</li>
    <li> I have had many experiences using product that was supposed to tame the frizzes.  I have fine hair and usually what happens is I am left with 1. my hair having a waxed feeling that products didn&#x27;t work well and it didn&#x27;t style well, and 2. my hair so greasy the next day I looked like I was going through puberty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So when this offer came I was very intrigued.  I read my literature the evening before and the next day washed and conditioned my hair has normal, then mixed the Frizz-Ease so it looked like it completely emulsified.  Then putting ten drops on my hair I worked it through my damp hair.  The first day, I was running late so I didn&#x27;t have a chance to properly blow it out into a style, so I was curious how it would work.  When I tell you I could not stop touching my hair, or twisting a piece in my fingers.  It was like I was playing with someone Else&#x27;s hair.  It was so smooth, but not heavy or greasy in the slightest.  My husband commented that my hair had a pretty look to it that evening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So the next day when I had time to style I did so and my hair worked so well with the flat iron and curling wand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this product and will happily give out my samples and tell my friends all about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclosure:  I was given this product for free to test as a BzzAgent.</li>
    <li> I tried this free because I am a BzzAgent, but it is well worth buying. My hair is almost always frizzy, and this light weight formula worked great in it. It actually kept my hair frizz free through a 24 hour period where it rained, was humid, and I got pretty sweaty. That says it all!</li>
    <li> I have shoulder length, baby fine hair, but as I am aging, I am getting salt and pepper hair growing in.  While I color my hair to hide that, it doesn&#x27;t change the fact that coarser hairs are growing in with the fine ones, which results in an odd dilemma indeed.  How exactly do you treat both at the same time?  Most products are made for either fine hair or coarse hair, but not for both.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried a lot of products, but if I don&#x27;t get enough \\&quot;conditioner\\&quot; from a product, my hair gets frizzy and dry looking, and if I get too much \\&quot;conditioner\\&quot; from a product, my hair looks dirty and unwashed, and flat and lifeless.  I have tried many smoother products that work alright, but they still left a feeling of having product in my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because of all of this, I was skeptical at first when I tried John Frieda&#x27;s sheer solution to frizz control.  It looked greasy in the bottle and I was a bit worried about it being too heavy.  After washing my hair and towel drying it to dampness, I shook up the bottle and dispensed about eight drops in the palm of my hand, then applied it starting at the ends and working up a bit.  I blew it dry, and right away I noticed how soft my hair felt and how shiny it looked.  The real win on this though, is that you don&#x27;t feel the product in your hair at all, and it just feels like soft, naturally healthy hair.  I am sold and will be using the product from now on.</li>
    <li> I started using this product a couple of weeks ago, and I can see a pretty dramatic difference in my hair. I have fairly thick, waist-length, color-treated hair that I prefer to wear straight. However, the color treatment has made my hair dry, and I have to wash my hair every day because I get sweaty when I work out. So anyway, a lot of the natural oils have been stripped from my hair. Couple this with living in humid Georgia, and I have a major frizz problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve tried a lot of different products, but so far, this one has been the best. What I do is shower and shampoo in the evening, then work this through my hair (while my hair is still damp) and let it air dry. My hands don&#x27;t feel greasy at all after handling this product, and neither does my hair. Note: the product has two phases, so you have to shake it up before dispensing. (About twice a week, I also treat my hair with coconut oil for a half hour, and I do use shampoos and conditioners designed for color-treated hair.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product does contain silicones. This is great if you want your hair straight (like I do), but please note that you&#x27;ll want to use a silicone-containing shampoo to clean this out of your hair, and it may make the hair resistant to taking curls/styling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bottom line: I really like the results I get from using this product. It is very easy to use and tames my frizz in a way that no other product I&#x27;ve tried has been able to. The only reason I took off a star is because I have to use 50-60 drops to see results instead of the 10 recommended on the bottle. That means one bottle won&#x27;t last me a very long time.</li>
    <li> I like this product because it keeps the hair at my part and crown soft and smooth. The only complaint is that because it&#x27;s essentially straightening your hair, the rest of my hair is pretty limp and doesn&#x27;t hold a curl well in warm weather. But, it&#x27;s not damaging at all and does tame the frizz for the most part.</li>
    <li> I recently ran out of my John Frieda frizz ease so I ordered a bottle from amazon. I didn&#x27;t look at it for a couple of weeks because I still had some left in my previous bottle. When I opened the bottle I purchased you could see like three layers. When I shook it up, it looked even worse. It is supposed to be a sheer liquid. It looked like someone had put something else in the bottle to fill it up, as they didn&#x27;t mix and looked seperated before shaking. Gross. Needless to say I am not using this or buying from this seller again since obviously something was wrong with it. Buyer beware.</li>
    <li> A few things you will notice immediately, the lightness and smoothness of the product. Not oily or sticky. This is hands down the best product to straighten and control frizz in humidity and my go to for great hair. I have tried every product out there, Moroccon, Lanza healing oil, everything leaves my hair greasy and dry. Go figure. And this product is so hard to find. I will have bad hair if they discontinue!! Nooooooo</li>
    <li> My hair tends to get frizzy in any damp conditions, but Sheer Solutions really does the job to keep my frizzies under control.</li>
    <li> does not even look like it smellllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllls horrible i will never buy this again do not waste your money on something you will not like</li>
    <li> Quick, reliable, product as described. :)</li>
    <li> I have fine, wavy hair with a really oily scalp and live in a humid area.  It&#x27;s a bad combination if you want to maintain any sort of consistent style.  I&#x27;ve tried washing my hair very often, leading to frizz; I&#x27;ve tried just shampooing occasionally, with some combination of water only/conditioner/not touching it at all between shampoos; I&#x27;ve tried baking soda pastes.  Nothing really worked without leaving my hair either super oily or super frizzy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff, however, lets me finally have the best of both worlds.  I shampoo every day with no conditioner (I know, some of you just died a little reading that), but about 15 minutes after showering I style my hair and then gently apply the Frizz Ease only to the surface.  That&#x27;s the key for my hair--if I keep it on the surface, I control the frizz without getting too close to my oily scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will say though that I use significantly more than the directions indicate.  It says 10 drops, I use close to 30.  I&#x27;d call my hair medium length, I guess, but barely past \\&quot;normal/short\\&quot; mode (and this male standards by the way).  So for anyone with remotely long hair you may find yourself using up a bottle faster than you&#x27;d think by reading the label.  Then again, even 30 drops is not really a whole lot so it will probably still last a long time regardless.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One last bonus: I&#x27;ve found myself hardly ever having to use styling product(s) anymore.  I shower in the evening, comb/run my hands through my hair, put in the Frizz Ease afterward, then wait about an hour for my hair to be mostly dry before going to bed.  (I don&#x27;t do any kind of drying to help minimize frizz).  When I wake up my hair basically looks 90% of how I want it; I just do about 30 seconds of adjustment and off I go.  The only time I need some kind of styling product is if I don&#x27;t let my hair dry enough before going to sleep, in which case it looks wacky from drying in weird positions on my pillow.</li>
    <li> Keep hair shiny frizzfree without the oily feel of serums.  Buy it if they still carry it.  Great for straight hair. They should not have discontinued it.</li>
    <li> Love the product.  Works as advertised.  Great for use on curly hair to prevent frizz.  Had to order online because I can no longer find it where I shop.  Someone at the factory needs to make sure the caps get screwed on properly.  I ordered 3 and one had a loose cap which spilled out 3/4 of the product.  Had to toss it entirely because you have to shake this stuff up before use and nearly all of the stuff that floated on top had been spilled.</li>
    <li> I have hair that is determined to be frizzy no matter how healthy it is. This stuff does the trick. I combine it with the Kukui Oil curl cream from Organix. Expensive combo, but the results are impressive. I got this on clearance at Walgreens for $5.99.</li>
    <li> Although the product showed some results on hair ends, it was largely ineffective for the frizz on the front. Sadly, all the good reviews must have been for thick, coarse hair.</li>
    <li> ideal for frizz on fine hair as it tames frizz without weighing hair down!! Very concentrated so a little goes a long way!!</li>
    <li> can&#x27;t find it in stores any more. Was excited to find it on line works really well to keep hair shiny and not frizzy</li>
    <li> This doesnt control my freezy hair. When i put his on my hair it makes it feel stiky and groos.</li>
    <li> If you need some control on some frizzy hair I would defiantly recommend using this product. I purchased this along with the John Frieda Frizz Ease Shampoo and Conditioner and they have worked wonders- Finally I have my hair under control. Leaves my hair felling so soft and smooth and no frizzy ends. LOVE IT!!!</li>
    <li> I HAVE USED THIS PRODUCT FOR A FEW YEARS.  THEN SUDDENLY IT STARTED TO DISAPEAR FROM THE STORE SHELVES. I WENT INTO THE JOHN FRIEDA WEBSIGHT AND COULDN&#x27;T FIND IT THERE, EITHER. I WAS THRILLED THAT I FOUND IT ON AMAZON.  SHOULD GO BACK IN AND BUY MORE BEFORE IT&#x27;S TOTALLY EXTINCT! !</li>
    <li> While I received a sample of this product as a BzzAgent, I can assure you I&#x27;ll keep using and buying it as it really works for me!&lt;br /&gt;My hair (wavy/straight) gets frizzy very easily, often giving me the Einstein hairstyle look. (As you can guess, I&#x27;m not particularly delighted by that!) Until the John Frieda Frizz-Ease Sheer Solution, I hadn&#x27;t found any product that actually helped me permanently. And I have tried! Other serums, sprays, and a variety of products. Either it would solve the problem for no longer than a couple of hours, or would leave my hair greasy, or both!&lt;br /&gt;On the other hand, with the Frizz-Ease solution, my hair stays -- quite incredibly --  clean and frizz-free all day long. Regardless of the weather. Regardless of whether I&#x27;ve styled it or simply let it dry on its own. The product will even handle my post-gym hair: the frizz I get after an intense workout is minimal, and it&#x27;s easy to get rid of it by just brushing again the hair!&lt;br /&gt;All in all, I really recommend you try this product as it&#x27;s very convenient to use and apparently very effective too!</li>
    <li> Received the John Frieda Frizz-Ease Sheer Solutions Control as a sample product to test and review, and it has since become a staple in my daily routine.  It isn&#x27;t perfect (I have curly hair and still get frizz) but does a great job, and I don&#x27;t use any other styling products.  Solution needs to be applied to slightly towel dried hair for best results.</li>
    <li> I am not liking this serum nearly as much as the original serum in the red bottle. It is too watery therefore I end up using way more than the frizzy ease in the red bottle. It also does not give my hair the same nice silky texture at all, more of a greasy one; disappointed in this product.</li>
    <li> I love this product!  I just put a few drops in the palms of my hands and run my hands over my towel dried hair.  It really helps with my fine, flyaway hair.  It doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy film - just smoother hair.</li>
    <li> I finally found something to allow my hair to curl instead of frizz when it gets damp, a nice mild hold for my very fine curly hair, but it seems to be discontinued, so I was glad to find some here on Amazon and ordered a whole bunch.</li>
    <li> Actually, I had it sent to my grown daughter, since I like the product. The only trouble was that it opened in shipment,&lt;br /&gt;and so some was lost, and it was messy upon opening.  My daughter&#x27;s very easy going, and accepted it; however I&#x27;ve&lt;br /&gt;meant to tell you; I was sick for a while. I&#x27;m glad you asked. It wasn&#x27;t cheap! Thank you.</li>
    <li> Really leaves hair soft and manageable -- I use 10 drops and mix with a styling lotion and voila, it works</li>
    <li> This is a newer (in the last 1.5 years) product for me.  I used another &amp;#34;curly hair&amp;#34; Frizz Ease product that I loved, and I was so disappointed when it was discontinued, but this works great!  You do not need to use very much and works great with Serum.  I love and need this!!</li>
    <li> I received this product as a Bzz Agent and will definitely buy it.&lt;br /&gt;I have thin hair but leaving in FL it is impossible to avoid humidity and frizz. This product does wonders! I have started to use John Frieda&#x27;s SMOOTH START® REPAIRING shampoo and conditioner which also leave my hair beautiful. I wash my hair then put a few drops of SHEER SOLUTION LIGHTWEIGHT FRIZZ CONTROL and blow dry the hair around my face and a little on the back. That&#x27;s it! That&#x27;s all the work I do!&lt;br /&gt;The sheer solution makes my hair straight, frizz is gone. The texture is thin and light leaving my hair smooth and silky. I have tried different products and the texture, most of the time, leaves my hair greasy and sticky. That is over!!! and the best part is that I don&#x27;t spend more than 10 minutes styling my hair in the morning before going to work. I def recommend this product!!!!</li>
    <li> great product for frizz.  hope they never stop making it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this off and on for at least 6 years.  It is one of my absolute favorite serums. It is thick but doesn&#x27;t weigh your hair down at all.  The new bottle is a great improvement.  My hair is curly/wavy and frizzy like no other. This is great. You just need to figure out your perfect amount to use. I don&#x27;t apply it to my roots at all; I start probably a few inches from my roots and focus on my ends. I love it. loveeee it!</li>
