      <li>I love this stuff and almost bought it at Sephora but decided to check Amazon first and am so glad I did because I saved a lot of $$ buying it from an Amazon seller.  </li>
      <li>Your skin feels smooth and taut after using it.</li>
      <li>Leaves my face feeling smooth and glowing.</li>
      <li>Such a great product.</li>
      <li>Leaves skin bright and clear.  </li>
      <li>I rinse it off in slow circular movements to make sure all the residue disappears and the exfoliating factor of this product is awesome, left my skin baby smooth.</li>
      <li>Overall pretty good product.</li>
      <li>Really recommend!!</li>
      <li>Anyway, it does exactly what it claims, make your skin prepped for a special event.</li>
      <li>Well worth it.</li>
      <li>Yes it is worth the money.</li>
      <li>Gives skin a fresh, glowing appearance.</li>
      <li>It polishes my skin and really helps keep my pores clean.  </li>
      <li>This is a powerful cleansing mask, so you should mix it in with a more daily intended cleansing scrub.</li>
      <li>I like the white one the most</li>
      <li>It does exfoliate and your skin does feel soft and smooth after using it</li>
      <li>/&gt;It does have a bit of tingle when you first put it on, but it calms down relatively fast and makes your skin feel great for the next week after using it.</li>
      <li>/&gt;GlamGlow should ditch the large box, blend the leaves, stick this goop in a tube and repackage this as a foot scub.</li>
      <li>It really helps make</li>
      <li>I really had to lighten my touch applying this - you can feel it tearing at your skin.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I am very frugal and do not hesitate one bit buying this face mask.</li>
      <li>the kind that are embedded in your face that get big, puffy red and make your face itch</li>
      <li>Kind of a let down when you see this box that is the size of most 3.3 oz perfume bottles only to find a tiny jar</li>
      <li>Slightly messy, and leaf like so make sure you wipe all the residue off.</li>
      <li>And, no, I do not have sensitive skin - thank goodness for that!</li>
      <li>but ladies, there are many products out there that do the same thing and for much less.</li>
      <li>I have suffered through acne my whole teen life</li>
      <li>there are the tiny lava rocks that are really jagged.</li>
      <li>Leaves my skin soft and glowing.</li>
      <li>and my skin is always so soft and refreshed after use.</li>
      <li>I have never had as much success as I have with this product compared to every other one I have used.</li>
      <li>After trying it once there was a major improvement in my skin tone!  </li>
      <li>I would warn against using it more than a few times a week, will cause your skin to dry and start peeling...</li>
      <li>I happen to really like the smell of green tea, so that is probably why I like this product so much.</li>
      <li>At first I was skeptical about this mask since it isn&#x27;t cheap.  </li>
      <li>but if it is such a vital ingredient - wouldn&#x27;t you - oh, I don&#x27;t know - blend it up</li>
      <li>This item has a heavy tingle to it, but dont be alarmed, just means its being absorbed into your skin.</li>
      <li>My nose and chin were my problem black head problems and after using this product the first time, I no longer have any there</li>
      <li>When you first put this mask on it burns a little bit, but that is only because of the tingling effect...</li>
      <li>After using this they are like butter!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are much kinder, less expensive and better products for your face.</li>

<li> I love this mask you will not be disappointed!!!</li>
<li> I had some hard areas on my feet.</li>
<li> At least mine did.</li>
<li> I needed to pull out some freaking crazy blade tool -</li>
<li> That would not be bad - UNLESS you missed the part about the jagged rocks!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> and I&#x27;m now 26 and still have bad acne -</li>
<li> Very disappointed it did not do what all it said it would, or make it out to be.</li>

    <li> Love it will purchase again.</li>
    <li> It makes my face feel fantastic! Has minimized my blackheads and brought about a glow on my face!&lt;br /&gt;Love it!</li>
    <li> love this stuff. Does what it says. Leaves my skin soft and glowing. Great mask.</li>
    <li> Gives skin a fresh, glowing appearance. Works as described.</li>
    <li> I have only used my Glamglow Mud Mask for a few weeks, but it already makes my face so much smoother and softer.</li>
    <li> This rocks and does what it states!</li>
    <li> This product is amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it on Friday or Saturday nights when I go out, because it makes your skin pop. This is a powerful cleansing mask, so you should mix it in with a more daily intended cleansing scrub. Plus, the container only holds enough for between 4-6 masks total for, in my case $40. Well worth it. If you want to look like a movie star when you go out chasing tail, this stuff is money.</li>
    <li> Felt tight on the skin as it dried, and you could see dark spots after it dried where black heads were</li>
    <li> I just used this product for the first time tonight, and I cannot say more about it! I have never had as much success as I have with this product compared to every other one I have used. Although the &amp;#34;tingling,&amp;#34; or burning rather, sensation is a little uncomfortable at first, it does pay off. I used a small amount, as recommended, and a little goes a long way. My nose and chin were my problem black head problems and after using this product the first time, I no longer have any there it appears! I will use twice weekly as recommended for sure!</li>
    <li> THE BEST facemask I&#x27;ve ever used. Yes it is worth the money. I am very frugal and do not hesitate one bit buying this face mask. It really helps make ur skin look and feel younger! Love it!</li>
    <li> Tried product after a lot of great reviews and advertising. Very disappointed it did not do what all it said it would, or make it out to be.</li>
    <li> My face feels wonderful, does not dry my skin. Leaves my face feeling smooth and glowing. Would recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> I got a sample of this at Sephora and loved it, but really didn&#x27;t love the 69 dollar price tag. Looked on here and found it for 35!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does have a bit of tingle when you first put it on, but it calms down relatively fast and makes your skin feel great for the next week after using it. I rinse it off in slow circular movements to make sure all the residue disappears and the exfoliating factor of this product is awesome, left my skin baby smooth. Really recommend!!</li>
    <li> This item has a heavy tingle to it, but dont be alarmed, just means its being absorbed into your skin. I use this product once every 2 weeks and my skin is always so soft and refreshed after use.</li>
    <li> My favorite mask ever!</li>
    <li> Such a great product. Leaves skin bright and clear.  Slightly messy, and leaf like so make sure you wipe all the residue off.</li>
    <li> Everyone has heard of glamglow masks and most people love it. I like the white one the most but this is nice too. Compared to buying it from Sephora, Amazon has the best deals!</li>
    <li> At first I was skeptical about this mask since it isn&#x27;t cheap.  After trying it once there was a major improvement in my skin tone!  My skin was glowing.  Definitely an item I will splurge on!!</li>
    <li> I have suffered through acne my whole teen life and I&#x27;m now 26 and still have bad acne - the kind that are embedded in your face that get big, puffy red and make your face itch and they hurt to touch them. I love this mud mask! It smells great, and after using it my face feels really smooth! It does burn a little bit, but it&#x27;s a small price to pay for smooth and glowing skin.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff! Dries pesky overnight pimples. My sister loves it too. It is the only product that has given her results.</li>
    <li> I love this mask you will not be disappointed!!! and cheaper the getting it at Sephora!! but it from here its 20 dollars cheaper!!</li>
    <li> Absolutely LOVE LOVE LOVE GlamGlows&#x27; mud mask! You only need to dab a small amount and spread on your face, immediately you feel the tingling sensation. Your skin feels smooth and taut after using it. I would warn against using it more than a few times a week, will cause your skin to dry and start peeling...At least mine did.</li>
    <li> I received a jar of this to try out. It comes in an over-the-top box with two product inserts - just a bit much. Kind of a let down when you see this box that is the size of most 3.3 oz perfume bottles only to find a tiny jar inside.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On to the product itself:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all this mask has tea leaf bits that get everywhere. Now maybe it is just me thinking here but if it is such a vital ingredient - wouldn&#x27;t you - oh, I don&#x27;t know - blend it up so it goes ALL OVER the face and not just in blotches???&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then there are the tiny lava rocks that are really jagged. I really had to lighten my touch applying this - you can feel it tearing at your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product states it \\&quot;tingles\\&quot; - what I experienced was BURNING. And, no, I do not have sensitive skin - thank goodness for that! The burning subsided after about 3 to 5 minutes but never felt good. After my 10 minutes was over I had to remove this from my face without removing the skin from my face. They want you - not joking here - to use circular motions while removing. That would not be bad - UNLESS you missed the part about the jagged rocks!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My muslin cloth got roughed up from this - not exaggerating about how jagged the lava is. I did find the smell plesant enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I made the comment that this felt like foot scrub on my face. So, for S&amp;G&#x27;s I actually put it on the soles of my feet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s the BEST FOOT SCRUB EVER!!! I had some hard areas on my feet. Nothing so horrible I needed to pull out some freaking crazy blade tool - just rough. After using this they are like butter!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are much kinder, less expensive and better products for your face. If you want a great pre-pedi foot mask - this stuff is just the ticket.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;GlamGlow should ditch the large box, blend the leaves, stick this goop in a tube and repackage this as a foot scub. They would make millions that way!!!</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing. Love it!</li>
    <li> This product is definitely not worth the money. It does exfoliate and your skin does feel soft and smooth after using it but ladies, there are many products out there that do the same thing and for much less. Never again!</li>
    <li> I liked this mask but I only got to use it twice before my friend &amp;#34;borrowed&amp;#34; it and never returned it. Anyway, it does exactly what it claims, make your skin prepped for a special event. I will have to reorder again.</li>
    <li> Overall pretty good product. Isn&#x27;t all that it is hyped up to be but I would definitely repurchase it again for this amount.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this mask.  It feels so good on your face, and it does wonders for your pores.  I&#x27;ll definitely be buying this product again. Thank you!</li>
    <li> Order came thru like a charm.  I Love Amazon, it&#x27;s my all time favorite one stop shopping go to place.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff and almost bought it at Sephora but decided to check Amazon first and am so glad I did because I saved a lot of $$ buying it from an Amazon seller.  This product is amazing.  It polishes my skin and really helps keep my pores clean.  I love that there is NO aloe in it because I am allergic to aloe.  The smell is fresh and pleasant too.  I happen to really like the smell of green tea, so that is probably why I like this product so much.</li>
    <li> I wouldn&#x27;t spend the money on this again.</li>
    <li> Absolutely LOVE this stuff! Your face tingles and feels wonderful, and once you rinse it off, you can tell your face is glowing. I am very pleased with product and price.</li>
    <li> Great product.  I use it once a week and it makes my skin look wonderful. Takes just 10-15 minutes</li>
    <li> Great product at a great price. I paid around $44 compared to $69 @ Sephora! Product came NIB and works wonders for your skin. One of the best exfoliates I&#x27;ve ever used</li>
    <li> When you first put this mask on it burns a little bit, but that is only because of the tingling effect...once it dries and you wipe it off your skin feels so wonderful for a week. I also have really dry skin and I love how my face feels so smooth afterwards. I am also happy that I got it on Amazon cheaper than the store cost! Awesome product!</li>
