      <li>This is super product and great for working with crafts.  </li>
      <li>These cotton swabs are an ok product.</li>

      <li>I do wish that there was more cotton on the tip.</li>
      <li>Will be ordering more soon.  </li>
      <li>i have had better ones.  </li>
      <li>It really depends on what you are using it for, but I think these are great.</li>
      <li>I use for cleaning gun barrel and the cotton comes off the end a litte too easy.  </li>
      <li>they easily brake.  </li>
      <li>I use them to also clean the bottom of the Keurig water tank.</li>
      <li>I couldn&#x27;t find these anywhere in town to help clean my gun.  </li>
      <li>Need some of theese to clean the ears of our cats.</li>
      <li>suitable 4 light work only.  </li>
      <li>Nothing exciting here</li>
      <li>They only work OK, though.  </li>
      <li>Works exactly like you need it to.  </li>
      <li>I had hoped the cotton swabs were bigger on the end - more cotton.  </li>

      <li>I love the long length on these swabs.  </li>
      <li>No problems on shipping the swab itself is tightly wound so if you are using it to get into hard surfaces it is perfect without having to deal with fibers getting stuck in the surface you are trying to clean.</li>
      <li>The sticks could be a little stronger, but they work fine for detailed weapon cleaning.</li>
      <li>These do the job and are much easier to use than the q-tip size</li>
      <li>Works very well and is sturdy and withstands the time needed to get the gun cleaner.  </li>
      <li>so i didn&#x27;t expect much.</li>
      <li>Overall, for applying ointment and other creams, these swabs are okay at doing this.</li>
      <li>Makes it easy to get into the small spots.</li>
      <li>If you push these swabs too hard they will easily break.</li>
      <li>but they work fine for cleaning connections, hard to reach places.  </li>

    <li> Exactly as expected! Thank you</li>
    <li> I like them because of their length and strength and the tip is firm. Ideal for my use as a Field Service Tech.</li>
    <li> Works exactly like you need it to.  Especially in the throat.  It really depends on what you are using it for, but I think these are great.</li>
    <li> Great for cleaning the dogs ears</li>
    <li> Need some of theese to clean the ears of our cats. These do the job and are much easier to use than the q-tip size</li>
    <li> Nothing exciting here but they work fine for cleaning connections, hard to reach places.  I use them to also clean the bottom of the Keurig water tank.</li>
    <li> These cotton swabs are an ok product. I use them to apply ointment on hard to reach areas and they do work well for this use. I do wish that there was more cotton on the tip.

    <li> Had purchased some from the vet.  Used all of those.  Found these here.  Great quality and strong.  Will be ordering more soon.  I have used some of them to clean old sewing machines.  These can clean in other hard to reach places.  Not just for ears.</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t find these anywhere in town to help clean my gun.  Works very well and is sturdy and withstands the time needed to get the gun cleaner.  However, you do occasionally need a bigger piece of cotton on the end.</li>
    <li> This is super product and great for working with crafts.  I use it with my glass ball ornaments.  Will order more.</li>
    <li> i have had better ones.  u get what u pay 4. they easily brake.  suitable 4 light work only.  poor quality.</li>
    <li> Purchased for cleaning tight places in firearms, this brand was cheap, quality was bad and the cotton had chaff in it. Some of the stems were broken. but they were inexpensive so i didn&#x27;t expect much. Could not see a woman using these on there face. The chaff would scratch badly as it was very hard and in some pieces very sharp.</li>
    <li> I had hoped the cotton swabs were bigger on the end - more cotton.  I did not want a Q-Tip but a larger cotton end to &amp;#34;swab&amp;#34; with.  This was too close to being a Q-Tip.</li>
    <li> These 6 inch long wooden handle cotton swabs look great.  They only work OK, though.  I use for cleaning gun barrel and the cotton comes off the end a litte too easy.  For the price, though, they work just fine!!!</li>
    <li> The sticks could be a little stronger, but they work fine for detailed weapon cleaning. Makes it easy to get into the small spots.</li>
    <li> I use these swabs daily for makeup removal or to add atibiotic ointment to an open wound. I have purchased these swabs over 4 times now, and will continue to in the future.</li>
    <li> I was very happy with these--received more than I expected and at a very good price--needed a swab for applying petroleum jelly to a lesion--these are perfect.</li>
    <li> I love the long length on these swabs.  I use them for hard to reach places that need cleaning.  Works perfect everytime!</li>
    <li> excellent sale. great shipping</li>
    <li> I would buy it again. No problems on shipping the swab itself is tightly wound so if you are using it to get into hard surfaces it is perfect without having to deal with fibers getting stuck in the surface you are trying to clean.</li>
    <li> Serve the intended purpose however, they are NOT sterile and I will need to locate &amp; order sterile swabs when these are used up.</li>
