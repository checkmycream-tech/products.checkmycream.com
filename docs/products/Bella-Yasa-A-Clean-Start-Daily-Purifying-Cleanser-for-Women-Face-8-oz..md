<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Fantastic!!!! The face wash feels like silk going on your face and throughout washing! I was having a breakout right when I received the product (my skin has been inconsistent during pregnancy), and after the first use I noticed a difference! Very happy with it, very different from other face wash. The reason for four stars was because when I received it, it had leaked out so I didn&#x27;t get a full bottle.</li>
    <li> This stuff is AMAZING and I will be making this a staple in my beauty routine.  I have combination skin with a bit of acne and it doesn&#x27;t dry too much or leave my skin tight.  Great product!</li>
    <li> This is a pretty nice cleanser.  It has a very nice citrus scent!  It lathers up rather nicely!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use this one, instead of my oil when I&#x27;m using my sonic cleanser...  It produces a better lather, that my regular Cleansing Oil, just isn&#x27;t capable of producing!  I definitely prefer this when using it!</li>
    <li> Thank goodness I was able to get in on this deal! I love this cleanser. I can feel it work while washing my face and I love that refreshing feeling afterwards, my face feels clean and fresh and not dry! My complexion looks brighter, too. I&#x27;ll admit, I thought this offer could be some sort of con but took a chance after googling some reviews. Happy I took the chance, thanks!</li>
    <li> Keeps my face feeling clean and is very easy to wash my makeup off with this!</li>
    <li> First off, I am incredibly picky about the products I use on my skin. That being said, I absolutely love this cleanser. I use it at least once a day, but usually twice. Once in the morning when I wake up and then when I come home from work or school at the end of the day when I&#x27;m settling in for the evening. It makes my skin feel super clean, it doesn&#x27;t make my skin feel super stripped or dry after I use it.I also love the light, fruity scent it has. I would absolutely recommend this to anyone looking for a daily cleanser to work into their routine.</li>
    <li> Great product! Life saver when you can&#x27;t take rx meds to clear up acne!</li>
    <li> This really does feel refreshing on your skin!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used it for a few days, but so far i really like it. My face has tightened up, and my acne is starting to clear up. I love the citrus smell.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for a little over a week.  I do not have a problem with acne, but as a daily facial cleaner it has worked well.  I am not able to use regular body soaps as they dry my face out way too much and leave it blotchy and dry.  It is not gritty feeling like some cleansers.  It has a citrus scent, so that is refreshing.  It has left my skin soft, not greasy or dried out.  The bottle is sufficient that it would last you a fairly long time as it doesn&#x27;t take a whole lot to clean your face.</li>
    <li> This face wash is very good!  It has a very pleasant citrus fragrance and layers up nicely and leaves my face feeling very clean.  The label on the bottle does get weirdly sticky when  you pick it up with wet hands but what&#x27;s inside he bottle is great!</li>
    <li> I have been using  this for several days.  It is working well and extremely gentle on my face.</li>
    <li> This face wash is amazing and smells fantastic!</li>
    <li> So far so good. It seems to be helping my skin and it makes it pretty soft. Smells really good!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only been using a couple of weeks, but it seems to clean deep and tighten my pores, which is what I have been looking for.</li>
    <li> Great face wash.  Orange smell.  Would be better with some sort of exfoliation in soap.</li>
    <li> Cleared my acne so far...</li>
    <li> Smells great and is gentle on your face.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m only giving this 3 stars due to the initial &amp;#34;thick&amp;#34; feel of the product (more mask like than a face wash), almost like honey &amp; the fact that I&#x27;ve not used it for long enough to tell a difference in my skin.  I&#x27;ve used less and used more water, worked better and rinsed fairly clean. However, I do like more of a fresh &amp; clean feel than this provides. It does smell yummy though.</li>
    <li> This has a great fruity smell to it and isn&#x27;t too foamy and leaves my face feeling wonderful after!</li>
    <li> This product was used by my wife and she tried it for over a week and had more problems with acne. Unfortunately we had to return it but the smell was nice.</li>
    <li> This face wash is a great product! it is gentle, but it is not damaging to the skin.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you so much for providing such an effective face wash!</li>
    <li> So far so good with this face wash, i love the way it smells and leave my skin smooth, washes off real easy</li>
    <li> This smells great and works well.  My only complaint is that it is really thick so I feel like I scrub and scrub to get it off my face and eyelashes but the smell is wonderful and is a citrus smell.</li>
    <li> Have tried dozens of face wash products in the past 2 decades and this was honestly my least favorite – very surprised too in light of all the great reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) Though I didn’t like it, I forced myself to try it a couple of times in the morning and my face ended up breaking out and not feeling clean after each time. Have switched back to my Biore face cleanser after 3 days and this Bella Yasa bottle has been just sitting on my shelf since.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) The gel is very thick and doesn’t lather well, so it really feels more like I am trying to smear honey onto my face. I want a face wash that is easy to apply and makes my face feel fresh, but this one definitely doesn’t have that effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3) It also doesn’t exfoliate or feel like it is exfoliating because there aren’t any beads/exfoliants in the product. Bella Yasa sent me an automated email after my purchase suggesting that I combine the product with sugar for best results, but I wish it already had an exfoliant in it which probably would have made it feel less like honey to me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4) Although the product smells great (like Cactus Cooler if you ask me), it smells very artificial. If this is true then I’d rather have a non-fragrant face wash that was natural in its ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Judging by the automated emails Bella Yasa sent me after my purchase, they seem to have good customer service, but ultimately I really disliked the product. I have stopped using it after a few days and would not recommend it.</li>
    <li> This product did not work on my acne.</li>
    <li> I love this! the smell is so pleasant and it keeps my breakouts at bay</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t noticed a difference and it&#x27;s already been two weeks. What I did notice is the cheap packaging. The label on the bottle is sticky to touch and the ink is starting to run. It&#x27;s almost like the label was printed in someone&#x27;s home printer. I guess because the bottle wasn&#x27;t cheap I expected a little more with the packaging. I&#x27;ve paid less money for a known brand and the packaging was better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing I do like is the scent. It&#x27;s not too strong or nauseating. It&#x27;s fresh and pleasant. I wish I could return it but it&#x27;s too late now.</li>
    <li> Face feels clean only need a little</li>
    <li> Bought this for gran-daughter and she loves it, clearing up facial blemishes very quickly</li>
    <li> Omg, I LOVE this face wash! It smells great, goes on smooth, rinses easily and leaves my face feeling so fresh, clean and just all around great! I use it twice a day, and it doesn&#x27;t cause any irritation like lots of other cleansers out there.</li>
    <li> Very nice product, will buy it again</li>
    <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE this natural, good smelling, super cleansing, yet gentle cleanser. My skin has never felt or looked better!</li>
    <li> The product smells great and comes in a convenient packaging with the pump, but its not the exfoliation I was looking for. The texture is more of a semi-thick honey type, very smooth on the face. I was looking for a daily lightly exfoliating option to use with my Clarisonic Mia, and this was not quite a fit. I have used it now for about 2 weeks, and do not notice a real difference in my skin tone or breakouts. Also, the price is rather steep for this product.</li>
    <li> This completely cleared up my face! Great product!</li>
    <li> It does smell good--like fresh oranges...but the texture is sort of...slimy...like aloe, I guess. While the pleasant smell makes you want to use it, it&#x27;s effectiveness is questionable. I have a breakout on my chin )-: my daughter was also not impressed. It&#x27;s pretty expensive, so for my money we&#x27;ll purchase proactive again next time. The bottle also looks cheap. The color on the label ran in the shower ....( unimportant, I know, but when you pay for &#x27;boutique quality&#x27; you expect better.</li>
    <li> My sister rrwlly likes this. Helped her skin.</li>
    <li> nothing special. smells really good but as far as cleaning my face can&#x27;t tell any difference between this and any other similar other product. my expectations were higher for this product so buying this was a miss.</li>
    <li> Pretty good face wash but I must say it gets ur face super dry so I only use for night time. Also be aware when u apply to face it burns a lil idk if that&#x27;s normal but that&#x27;s the only thing I don&#x27;t like about it.</li>
    <li> I could not wait to try this facial wash.....so as soon as I received it, I tried it.  I love it!!  It smells so fresh and clean and it works beautifully.  It does not make my face feel all dried out - just pleasantly clean.</li>
    <li> The first thing I always do when I try out a new personal care product is open up the bottle to see how it smells.  When this came in the mail and I took a whiff, WOW - it was like a fresh squeezed orange!  I honestly cannot put in words how amazing this smells!  The orange oil is strong without being overpowering.  It makes me want to jump into a vat of the stuff!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this after coming home from a really long day at work when I also hadn&#x27;t slept well the night before, and frankly I was beyond exhausted.  I decided to give the facial wash a try after dinner.  To my very pleasant surprise, the citrus oils were so refreshing and invigorating that I actually suddenly found some energy to keep going for the rest of the evening!  Not only this, it did a fantastic job of cleaning - my face feels soft and smooth and looks great too.  This will definitely be my go to facial cleanser, especially when I need a little extra boost of energy (which let&#x27;s face it, is pretty much all the time!).  So happy that I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.</li>
    <li> Smells great. Nice product and quick shipping!</li>
    <li> Foams nicely and has a pleasant citrus scent. My face feels really clean afterward. Will update on how well it works on acne</li>
    <li> Bought this for my daughter, who has a lot of acne. This is a great facial cleanser and like many face washes that cause your face to break out even more, this product does not do that. She had no irritation at all. Thank you will def be purchasing more in the near future. NOTE: Item was purchased through a promotional discount.</li>
    <li> So far a pretty good cleanser.</li>
    <li> I got it to day. Have not tried it. But it had leaked  out in the plastic bag and in the box. So lot of it got out. Should I send it back? ?</li>
    <li> I liked this cleanser.  I bought it because of the salicylic acid.  I am older and have a skin tag and am hoping with continued use, this will take care of it.  It leave my face feeling very clean.</li>
    <li> Not bad, makes your skin feel soft, and smells nice. Thank you!</li>
    <li> I am liking this face wash. My face feels like it is clean afterwards without drying out. The only downside is that the bottle leaks constantly.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my niece who has problem skin. After using it for a little while, we can see a dramatic improvement in her skin.</li>
    <li> Best facial cleanser I&#x27;ve used so far. Smells nice, only need a little and lathers nicely, gentle, cleanses well and reasonably priced.</li>
    <li> Smells good. But has not helped my adult acne.</li>
    <li> Not only did it dry my skin out, but it also caused breakouts in places that I never get pimples. I continued to use it for a couple of weeks just to be sure it wasn&#x27;t some time of &#x27;purging&#x27;, but no such luck.  My face began to clear up immediately once I stopped using.  Maybe it works for some people, but not for me.  I meant to return it to get my money back, but its still sitting under my bathroom sink. Money down the drain :(</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t normally write reviews, but I wanted to share my feedback on this cleanser. I love how gentle and non-drying this cleanser is. It exfoliates without irritating sensitive skin. Obviously, treating acne is not &amp;#34;one size fits all&amp;#34;, but I have found this face wash to be an excellent foundation for healthy skin. It is also a great value! I was using another face wash for about the same price, but this big bottle lasted me three times as long! You only need a little pea sized amount because it is a gel cleanser. It also leaves my skin feeling soft...someone said it left their skin &amp;#34;tacky&amp;#34; which is really odd...maybe they didn&#x27;t use water? Anyways, I wanted to give you an honest review because there seems to be some FAKE one star reviews posted recently and it is really misleading. Try out the face wash whether you have acne or not...the salicylic acid is helpful for cell regeneration and calming redness :)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 52 years old and have washed my face with regular bar soap my whole life.  I really don&#x27;t have a lot of wrinkles for my age, but I thought, maybe, there&#x27;s something better out there, so I began my quest.  I read a lot of reviews and ordered a few different face cleansers from Amazon.  I stayed away from abrasive cleansers because they make me break out.  One highly reviewed product made my face so dry I couldn&#x27;t stand it.  Another bothered my eyes.  I, frequently, have allergies to cleansers and cosmetics, so that rules a lot out, but I don&#x27;t know until I try them.  Then I tried Bella Yasa.  First, I can say it didn&#x27;t overly dry my skin and it didn&#x27;t bother my eyes so I continued to use it.  Within a few days, I got up one morning and looked in the mirror and it caught my attention how bright my face looked.  I can&#x27;t put my finger on it but, I definitely, had a more youthful look.  Then I noticed that my skin began to feel different.  By the end of each day, it had a dewy feel to it, like I remember when I was younger.  Then some fine lines softened a bit.  I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s just a coincidence, but after using it a few weeks, a fellow soccer mom told me, out in broad daylight on the field, that I had a young looking face.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not saying it&#x27;s a miracle product, but I, definitely, see benefits and I will continue to use it.  I wash my face, neck, and chest with it.  It&#x27;s even faded some of the freckles on my chest that I have from years of sun damage. And, like other reviewers have said,  a little goes along way.&lt;br /&gt; I also want to address it&#x27;s effectiveness for acne.  Because I was so pleased with it, and I saw it had salicylic acid in it and claimed to help acne, I gave it to my 15 year old son who has moderate acne.  He&#x27;s been using it for a while now and I would say it&#x27;s helped, but, hasn&#x27;t cured it.  It&#x27;s working about the same as other acne products he&#x27;s tried.</li>
    <li> I have a combination sensitive skin. It made my skin too dry and skin started peeling off. I had to stop using this cleanser.</li>
    <li> i feel as though it is working well so far, time will tell</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very gentle with a clean smell and works well on my skin.</li>
    <li> I tried once and my skin is radiant and smooth that&#x27;s why I bought again and i will recommend to all my family and friends.</li>
    <li> I was expecting a clear clean fresh smelling product. Instead it is a sticky mess that leaves my face feeling tacky to the touch. I guess I would say. the product was a disappointment. Now I am leery of trying your other products.</li>
    <li> Nice packaging &amp; so far, so good as a cleanser. It seems to be quite gentle &amp; non-irritating and I love the scent!</li>
    <li> Based on reviews I ordered this cleanser.  I was very disappointed that it did not come in a pump bottle as shown, but has a flip top.  The label was sticky and irritating so I had to peel it off. These are the reasons for 4 stars.  A little does go a long way, so I am sure it will last a long time.  The smell is ok, a little overpowering for me.  I have acne prone skin due to hormonal changes, and have not noticed it clearing my skin.  I do think it cleans well.  I can also use it with my clarisonic. I have combination, mature skin (I&#x27;m 57) and it does feel tight and dry after cleansing but I&#x27;m good once moisturizer is applied.  It is a very thick, honey like gel, there are no micro beads for exfoliation.  I was looking for something to replace the proactive I have used for years.  This is not it.</li>
    <li> My teenage daughter loves this cleanser - it is efficient yet gentle.  She uses this in her daily routine, and I like it since the ingredients are not extreme.  Highly Recommended!</li>
    <li> Still using this faithfully and waiting for it to work. I guess maybe it&#x27;s not so effective for menopausal acne!</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t not work, would not purchase again</li>
    <li> I am returning the product.  It did not work.  My skin is too irritated.  The acne is even worst.</li>
    <li> I like the texture and smell of this face wash. The product did not leave my face squeaky clean or tight which is another positive. I wouldn&#x27;t purchase it again because it did not seem to be formulated for oily acne prone skin.</li>
    <li> As with most new face washes I approached with caution, I have very senative skin and adult acne. I do have to say after about 2 weeks on this stuff it really does do wonders. smells really good and a little tiny dab is more than enough do to your face/neck. Just make sure you follow up with a good moisturizer and you&#x27;re set. would buy again, wish I found this sooner.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m always a little bit hesitant to try out new facial washes, but I&#x27;m really glad I gave this product a chance. I like that this product has a pump, which makes it really easy to use. My hands are often wet when I&#x27;m starting to clean my face, so I appreciate that I don&#x27;t have to open a jar or pick up a tube to squeeze. This product also smells amazing. I love citrus smells! The scent is not overpowering at all, which is an issue I have with a lot of facial products. This product doesn&#x27;t provide tons of foam, but it&#x27;s enough to satisfy me. (I&#x27;m not a fan of cleansers that don&#x27;t foam at all!) After using it, my face feels very clean, but not as if the product has stripped away all the oil from my face. That&#x27;s a delicate balance. Cleansers that strip away everything can actually cause your face to overproduce oil. I really like this cleanser and would recommend it to anyone that is looking for a nice product with a clean scent.</li>
    <li> This is a great face cleanser, I love the fresh citrus scent and it makes my skin feel fresh and clean in the morning and hasn&#x27;t caused any irritation to my skin!</li>
    <li> I agree with everybody! It&#x27;s fantastic and smells so good you can&#x27;t wait to wash up! I recommend it highly.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. It works great and smells even better.</li>
    <li> love the way my skin feels when im done!</li>
    <li> I used this when I had my monthly breakout and it cleared up with in a few days. It has a nice scent and texture. Love it</li>
    <li> This is a really great face wash. I struggle with breakouts and was a little scared to try this, but the reviews were so great, I took a chance and got it. Sooooooooo glad I did!! I&#x27;ve made this my morning face wash in the shower. The pump is really nice to have since I&#x27;m in a rush in the mornings. I have been using it for ten days and I think it&#x27;s a really great addition to my skincare regimen. It doesn&#x27;t dry my face out and my flaking has almost completely gone away. I love the smell, it&#x27;s nice to have a face wash that feels like your being pampered. I will definitely buy this again.</li>
    <li> I have only been using this product for a week and my skin looks amazing. I had some small break outs and it has helped clear it up nicely!!!!</li>
    <li> I am loving this acne face wash. It is gentle and refreshing. So far it is working great. It cleans my face thoroughly and leaves it clean and smooth. It has also cleared my face from the acne and blemishes I had prior to using this product.  And it&#x27;s microdermabrasion particles are not abrasive to my skin. I highly recommend this effective product.</li>
    <li> Smells great and feels great on my skin.  I am looking forward to seeing how well it fends off my acne too!  I am hopeful about this face wash.  I also use on my shoulder area because i tend to break out there as well.</li>
    <li> I am semi-in love with this stuff. I know, a lot of times it is hard to believe the reviews you read on here but I assure you, I wouldn&#x27;t be raving about a product that I didn&#x27;t find fabulous. It has a great feel when washing off-it reminds me of the orange neutrag brand that I grew up with and has a similar smell-but more luxurious feel. It is also not overly drying which is something I have to watch out for. It&#x27;s hard to find a fine line between pulling all the excess oil off and leaving it simultaneously moisturized but Bella Yasa has done it. I will say, it took me a few washings to realize that I only need a tiny little bit for my entire face-so I really had to perfect my control to just get the little bittiest bit out so that I will have this for a long time. Which I will, because the bottle is seriously enormous. I didn&#x27;t even put in my head the perspective of the amount I would be getting here but I have to say I&#x27;m quite pleased now that I use it every. single. day. I was previously using Philosophy brand and a Posh exfoliating wash but with either one of those, I didn&#x27;t get that total clean feeling. Sometimes I forget to wash my face before I go to bed and I literally wake up feeling so grimy I can&#x27;t stand it. When I would wash with my former washes, I still felt like I had residual grime on my face. I had to use a toner to feel like it was stripped off but even then I felt a residue, or like my pores really weren&#x27;t getting stripped. Regardless of the fact that I was provided this product for an honest review, I did not receive compensation for what is written. I only promote products I use and believe in. I can genuinely recommend this to anyone who has combination-oily skin and wants the feeling of a clean, fresh face. You can take a drop and spread it thinly across your face and neck and rinse easily with cold water, to close your pores and give a nice glow. I could honestly go on and on about how it&#x27;s my new favorite beauty wash product.</li>
    <li> This wash is by far one of the products I&#x27;ve come around in a long time. My face feels so refreshed after using it that this will be my product for a long time. Very happy I gave it a try.</li>
    <li> My skin love this! I will be buying again in the future!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very happy with this face wash.  It produces just the right amount of lather on my face.  My face feels clean after I rinse it off.  I would definitely recommend it and buy it again.</li>
    <li> Great face wash!! I haven&#x27;t had any breakouts and makes my face feel clean and refreshed!!</li>
    <li> I have a very sensitive,acne-prone oily skin and have been struggling with it for the past 20+years. I have tried a lot of remedies including proactive, a lot of facial cleansers,derma sessions but this is the first time that i have seen real results in just few days. My pimples appear less visible and i notice that it shrunk in size. I tried to use this product with a microdermabrasion machine and the result was absolutely amazing!&lt;br /&gt;My face felt smoother and cleaner. I am definitely overwhelmed and satisfied with this miracle product.  This is the first time that i have reviewed a product online. Thank you so much for creating something that really works!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this face wash! I am cleanser snob too. I am super picky but I have to say this has became my favorite. The smell is light and fruity which I love. You do not need to use but just a little dab for it to clean your entire face. Definitely buying more once I start to run out.</li>
    <li> I am skeptical about all these great reviews. This stuff has made just about every pore on my face break out with a bump or whitehead! I have tried everything and never had this reaction to a product. No thank you!</li>
    <li> Energizing scent leaves skin feeling well cleansed</li>
    <li> Recently I had started having breakouts and wanted to start a skin regimen that:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1.  Did not clog my pores.&lt;br /&gt;2.  Provided deep cleansing and exfoliation without drying my skin and causing even more irritation.&lt;br /&gt;3.  Effective enough to rid my face of acne, but gentle for my sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the 2nd skincare product that I have ordered from Bella Yasa and again I am both pleased and delighted with the results.  The first use of Clean Start Daily Purifying Cleanser was fabulous!  The cleanser felt like silk gliding on my face and I could actually feel it working. This cleanser accomplished everything I needed and more!  It&#x27;s paraben and oil-free, so my skin feels fresh and clean.  My skin glows and looks healthier more and more everyday.  I&#x27;m so glad I found this great skin in a bottle!  I highly recommend this cleanser and other skincare products by Bella Yasa, your skin will thank you for it!</li>
    <li> I love this cleanser!!  A lot of acne face washes are harsh and dry out my skin, but not this one.  It leaves my face feeling clean, soft, and refreshed.  I highly recommend this product and this seller!  They are both great!!!</li>
    <li> Love the way it makes my skin feel and love the refreshing scent.</li>
    <li> Loving this face cleanser....it really makes a difference</li>
    <li> I ordered this for my teen who has had bad bouts of acne for several years now.  I have purchased her several different brands of cleansers that all claim to fight and/or control acne and never found one that truly worked.  From the very first use it has made her face feel soft and smooth and within a matter of a few days we saw a huge improvement in how it was treating the acne she had as well as kept break-outs at bay.  The formula itself is a gel and when you rub it into your face it becomes foamy.  The scent is a mild citrus/orange and does not dry out your skin like so many with salicylic acids do.  I would highly recommend but not only for an acne face wash but also for a great cleaner to get off all the grime and give your face a fresh appearance and healthy glow!  I was offered this at a discount in exchange for my honest review.</li>
    <li> The packaging for this product needs some serious improvements.  It arrived with the top popped (thankfully it didn&#x27;t leak in the box) and the purple ink on the label ran almost immediately in the shower.  I&#x27;m hoping that it doesn&#x27;t stain anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The face wash itself smells really good, love the orange scent.  The texture is OK too but It doesn&#x27;t leave my face feeling very clean.  Overall, I&#x27;ll be switching back to my regular product.</li>
    <li> Great smell...leaves your face feeling very clean and refreshed!</li>
    <li> To start with, this face wash has not disappointed. It has a very nice scent to it, that was surprising as I had no idea what to expect. This cleanser is thick, which is nice so a little bit goes a long way on your face with a nice thin layer. I have been using it for a few weeks now and my skin has decreased acne and feels smoother after I use this product.</li>
    <li> This product is Awesome</li>
    <li> When I start to use it for the very couple of days, my eyes have felt uncomfortable until I wash my face completely. I stop for a while and restart to use it. No problem now and work well with my skin. Feel more moisture after putting tones and lotion.</li>
    <li> I love this face wash. The smell is great, you only need a small pea sized amount. If you use it twice a day (morning and night) and try try try to not touch your face (still working on breaking that habit) you will notice immediately that it smoothes your acne and eventually your face just stops breaking out altogether. I have terrible hormonal acne around my jawline and neck so I usually concentrate it to that area. It&#x27;s pricey but like I said you use so little it will last forever</li>
    <li> Wanted to love it, but after a month of using it every day/every other day there was no change in my skin or postpartum acne problem. It&#x27;s says it exfoliates but there isn&#x27;t an exfoliant in it... had to use one alongside it.</li>
    <li> I like it so far, the smell is very nice, but not too strong, skin feels soft after wash as well!</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin; I have since I was a teenager. No matter how &#x27;gentle&#x27; facial cleansing products said they were, they would ALWAYS cause my skin to break out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was a little leery of purchasing this product, because I felt that I would have the same results -- broken out skin.  However, I was very wrong! This stuff is amazing! It works very well, but it doesn&#x27;t strip my skin of moisture, and most importantly, it doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin! I highly recommend this product to anyone with sensitive skin that wants an effective face wash.</li>
    <li> Love it! It really is a great product!</li>
    <li> Love how squeaky clean it leaves my skin.  Nice light scent not overpowering.  Creamy face wash.  skinny felt brand new in the morning after washing my face with this product.</li>
    <li> Refreshing scent and works great!</li>
    <li> I have really been enjoying this cleanser. I find that it gets in there and cleans my pores deeply. It also smells amazing which is a plus for me. I just wish it would lather a little more... I love a cleanser that lathers. Although I do know that products that lather often times contain extra chemicals to actually make the lather-- and I would rather stay away from that, so I don&#x27;t really mind the less lather with this cleanser. I have noticed my skin has started to become clear and I am loving that!</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this face wash....the citrus smell is amazing!! A little product goes a long way and my skin felt clean not stripped...</li>
    <li> This facial cleanser makes my face feel amazing. It smells great also! Just a tip - a little goes a long way. I will definitely order this again!</li>
    <li> I really enjoy the scent of this face wash. It cleans your face without over drying and leaves your skin feeling soft and smooth. A small amount goes a long way and it has a convenient pump for dispensing.</li>
    <li> I love this cleanser it makes my face feel soo good and clean after I use it. I Also love the smell of it not a harsh or perfume smell just a clean smell to me. It&#x27;s not an oily or greasy cleanser nor is it a harsh cleanser. I&#x27;ve noticed the difference in my pores and acne and am definitely  a believer in this face wash. Thank you for letting me test this product.</li>
    <li> It is a really nice and light cleaner, not too oily. I have sensitive skin so a lot of cleanser can leave me blotchy and irritated. Luckily, this one does not. I have very little counter space in the bathroom but this bottle fit perfectly next to my raised sink and has been helping me remember to clean my makeup off my face every night! I didn&#x27;t give it 5 stars, simply because I found that some of my waterproof makeup was not as easy to clean off (I have never found the perfect cleanser that is good for my sensitive skin and gets off waterproof makeup).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*Product received at a discount in exchange for honest review*</li>
    <li> The smell is very citrusy. Almost overpowering. But it does not last long once washed off. It does work great, my face feels clean after using and it does not leave an oily residue. It did dry my face out a lot though so I can only use it every 3rd day.</li>
    <li> Perfect face cleanser!  Not only do I use it but my teenage daughter does as well!  We both love it!</li>
    <li> Very gentle and effective face wash. I will be buying more when I run out.</li>
    <li> Makes my face look so much better! My acne has cleared up since I started using it! Great product!</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work for my sons acne at all. Did absolutely nothing for him. Diligently tried  it on his face and back with no results.</li>
    <li> UNPAID REVIEW:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t waste your money.  It smells great, but it isn&#x27;t any better/worse than neutrogena face wash for acne.</li>
    <li> I am only giving this 3 stars due to poor packaging. I have orange streaks all over my shower and have probably lost about 1/4 of the product to drips and runs. The cleanser itself seems to be good. I feel clean and refreshed after use and I like the orangey scent. Should reconsider packaging though. Can&#x27;t pack this in a suitcase!!</li>
    <li> I really like this facial Cleanser. It has a very refreshing smell to it! It is not overpowering. My skin feels nice and clean after I use it. I am going to buy this for my daughter. I will continue to use it and would recommend it to others.</li>
    <li> Smells fantastic, feels great on my skin. Washes off all of my makeup. Doesn&#x27;t leave a residue.</li>
    <li> Love this wash! Smells wonderful and a small bit washes my whole face. No weird feeling or residue afterward. Totally happy with this product!</li>
    <li> I have been looking for a good face wash that doesn&#x27;t dry my face out.  As I have gotten older, I have found that I am picky about what I clean my face with, so when I got this I was excited to try it out!  The first thing I noticed is that it is a bigger bottle than I was expecting. It looks as though I bought it in a high end store, the design of the bottle is very sharp looking!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I used it, I applied a small amount in the palm of my hand , added a little water and washed my face with it.  It smells FANTASTIC!  I found that my face feels really soft and clean afterwards.  I appreciate the fact that it is also an Acne wash, because I tend to have adult acne occasionally.  My teenage daughter is also using it now , for the benefits of it being an acne face wash.&lt;br /&gt;This has become a regular part of my routine for skin care and I highly recommend it for all ages!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this stuff for about a week and I LOVE it! I used pro-activ for years and finally stopped my subscription and have been searching for another cleanser. My face is so clear right now and feels wonderful. I love the feel of this when i&#x27;m using it and the smell is fantastic. This is a winner. I have sensitive skin and so far my skin has loved it.</li>
    <li> Just one pump works great to clean my entire face. I found my skin felt tighter and clean after using without feeling dry or greasy. I love this product and the fact that my face looks better after just a few uses. I really think it works better than my former method of cleansing. I will definitely purchase this again and recommend it to my friends!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m actually excited to write this review! I was thinking this would be just like any other cleanser but I was wrong. It smells first of all, like you&#x27;re washing your face with oranges. The smell is amazing! No medicinal smell at all. The wash is also thick so a little goes a long way. It&#x27;s really creamy. It feels luxurious, for lack of a better word, when you put it on your face, and I just can&#x27;t get over the scent. My face feels nice and I can honestly say, it does not leave it feeling dry. I wish I had a case of these! I have to share with my pre-teen so we dole it out little drops at a time lol.</li>
    <li> This product smells amazing and cleanses very well. It does not dry out my skin. It will become part of my daily skin care routine. Nice product.  Will definitely purchase again.</li>
    <li> This is a fantastic cleanser. Nothing else has kept my face this clear. The only downside is that my face feels really dry after using it, so I apply the vitamin E after. My face is looking better than ever and is soft and smooth.</li>
    <li> Face feels amazing after use, and clears blemishes and acne quickly</li>
    <li> Great product, gentle on my sensitive skin.Smells great and has a nice, thick and smooth consistency.</li>
    <li> Love the smell of this and it seems to be working really well! Very refreshing and leaves my skin feeling great!</li>
    <li> Works awesome and smells amazing. It is one of the only things that does not break my face out. It&#x27;s refreshing and I love to use it. Would recommend to anyone.</li>
    <li> I  brought this for my daughter and she said it was excellent in minimizing the oil that was surfacing through her skin on her face.  We have tried several products and we did see a significant change over a couple of weeks with this one.  We are still looking for the ideal product to get rid of the blemishes.  But this product  was a good start.</li>
    <li> Game on time just trying couple days now so far ok, to early.</li>
    <li> Nice citrus scent, not overly drying, thick formula. Great that it is a pump bottle so it is not a hassle in the shower and prevents you from using too much (you only need one pump).</li>
    <li> OMG!!! It is like a spa right in your hand. So smooth and doesn&#x27;t burn at all! Smells lovely! Leaves my face feeling so clean but still moisturized. I was ready for burning and scrubbing (for there to be granules of something in it). NONE OF THAT!! Just a warm relaxing sensation. Did I mention it smells great! And it doesn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling tight and itchy. I don&#x27;t have to put lotion on for hours! Strange out of a product that cleans so well! Usually I run to the lotion cabinet! One pump is enough to clean your whole face and neck and even earlobes. While it is for acne (which I don&#x27;t have), it does wonders on blackheads as well. We used it on my 15 year old&#x27;s back for about a week and the difference was amazing! It even helped clear up some of the infected or ingrown hairs on his face so we were able to easily pull them out with tweezers. It cleared the white &amp;#34;gunk&amp;#34; right out of the infected areas. I have tried other blackhead removing products and acne products for him and myself and nothing works like this. And did I mention the fragrance?? Wonderful. HEHE! Let me tell ya….my son HATES the skin care regimen but this is so easy. No toner, no scrubbing, no popping pimples and red dots everywhere. I don&#x27;t think anything would make this product any better. Throwing the rest of his &amp;#34;face stuff&amp;#34; away. This stuff is going everywhere with us!</li>
    <li> Great product and company  Thanks!</li>
    <li> My daughter loves this product. It smells very nice and has a really good feel to it.</li>
    <li> I have only very mild breakouts but lots of clogged pores and oily skin. I have been using this every day now and have really liked it. I used to use a daily cleanser and St. Ives as my exfoliate but this works better for me, it&#x27;s doing both and it&#x27;s better at it, plus I love that it&#x27;s in a pump and smells great.With my old face wash I could rub the dead skin off with my fingers because it would build up, this keeps the dead skin from building up.  I&#x27;m using this in the dead of winter and it has not dried my skin out. My skin feels a bit tight after my shower but that is the same with a lot of cleansers I use, once I put on moisturizer I&#x27;m fine. A little bit goes a long way for me and I haven&#x27;t had any issues with this. I am impressed that I liked it so well.&lt;br /&gt;I ordered this item as a sample for review and evaluation.&lt;br /&gt;Update: It has been months now and I am still using and loving this face wash!</li>
    <li> Use it for two weeks now. I love it. My skin feel clean, smooth, no dry out after using it. My pore is clean and getting smaller. Recommend!</li>
    <li> This is a great facial cleanser! A little bit goes a long way which is nice because I know it will last me a while even with twice daily washes.</li>
    <li> Not bad. Not drying and has a pleasant smell</li>
    <li> Bad news: I&#x27;m in my late 20s and still suffering from breakouts. Good news: I found this stuff.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This cleanser smells incredible. I&#x27;ve been using it in the shower, and I find that my oily T-zone isn&#x27;t so oily anymore. After using this, my face always feels really clean and refreshed- not dry and tight like some other cleansers have done to my skin in the past.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would still use this stuff even if I wasn&#x27;t breaking out. It&#x27;s good to treat, clean and moisturize your skin regardless :)</li>
    <li> This is one of the best facial cleansers I have used in a long long time. I love the way it smells and how it makes my skin feel. Leaves my skin so soft and smooth and clean. Its nice and thick, so you only need to use a small amount to wash with. Doesn&#x27;t irritate my sensitive skin. There isn&#x27;t anything I don&#x27;t like about this cleanser! Will definitely get again when this is gone.</li>
    <li> I really like this face wash.  It has a light, pleasant smell and feels mild and my face feels so clean.  It&#x27;s not drying and best of all, I haven&#x27;t had a breakout since I began using it.</li>
    <li> Good facial cleaner. I have sensitive skin and this did not break me out, it just cleaned my face. I was disappointed it didn&#x27;t help out my acne but still a good product.</li>
    <li> I am a guy I like other cleansers better</li>
    <li> I have very pale sensitive skin (like I blister every time I get my lips/eyebrows waxed) and my skin can also get very oily. I break out a lot and have used harsh chemicals in the past, but I was only further damaging my skin. So I decided to do some research and it brought me to this cleanser, I bought it and decided I would try it out. I didn&#x27;t get my hopes up because I have been through plenty cleansers and often found they were either too harsh/weak or didn&#x27;t fix my acne problem. However, I was pleasantly surprised when after two days of using this product I began to see improvement. I don&#x27;t use it every day, but every other day when I take a shower because the cleanser is thick and can be annoying to wash with just a washcloth. It also smells amazing- it smells very strongly of oranges which I liked (instead of that gross chemical smell). It leaves my skin feeling clean and soft and I do believe it could very well be safe enough to use as a everyday cleanser. My skin however has a habit of getting used to products (sometimes very quickly) and then they seem to stop working as good as they used to. So I conteract that by using two different cleansers. This one day and CeraVe foaming facial cleanser the other (with Nutrogena visibly even moisturizer in the day and CeraVe PM motisturizer at night) this combination works amazing for me and my skin continues to improve. I would definitely recommend trying this product.</li>
    <li> Works very well on teenage acne without drying out skin. My 16 year old daughter uses it daily and it has made a huge improvement in her skin.</li>
    <li> kinda stings my face, but does a good job.</li>
    <li> Crazy overpriced. Dried out my skin but made it oily at the same time. Very disappointed and wish I had never purchased.  The label is cheap, sticky, and the ink runs and discolors which kind of makes sense since the rest of this product is equally bad.</li>
    <li> I never knew what I was missing until I tried this face wash. It smells so good and is so gentle on my sensitive skin. I highly recommend this!</li>
    <li> A clean start daily purifying cleanser is my newest face wash, and i absolutely love it. I wash my face several times a day which creates one problem it causes my eczema to flair up, but i do not feel like my skin is clean unless i do this daily. Well with this face wash i do not have to worry about the eczema coming back, it moisturizes as it cleans leaving my skin fresh, rejuvenated, and clear. I love having someone ask me how old i am and they can not believe i have kids as old as i do. I will absolutely keep buying this face wash.</li>
    <li> I love that this is sensitive enough to use everyday, but I can still feel it working on my face. I can also tell that it purges my skin. I am very acne prone and this product is helpful.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this face wash. It smells amazing and it really leaves your skin feeling so clean and soft. I have super sensitive skin so I am very particular about what I use. This didn&#x27;t irritate my skin or cause additional breaking out like others have. I really love the pump because it just makes things easier. My daughter has also started using it and she loves it. We will definitely be buying more of this amazing face wash.</li>
    <li> This is one of the best face cleansers I&#x27;ve ever purchased. It&#x27;s so clean! I use a small dab and lather. The citrus fragrance is so nice and the way my skin feels is great!!!</li>
    <li> This face wash has a nice citrus scent and I like the way it feels on my skin. It does a good job of cleaning all the make-up off without stripping my face of the oils. But it&#x27;s just okay. I have really bad acne and this face wash didn&#x27;t clear it up, but it didn&#x27;t make it worse either. I wouldn&#x27;t purchase it again. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth the amount it costs.</li>
    <li> Not had time to use it very long but so far I like it.</li>
    <li> I have struggled with acne since right before I turned 30 so I am always trying out new products to see what works best for me. I liked this product at first , it seemed to work really well for me , but I put on more than usual one day as I was starting to have a breakout and it burned really badly and made my face red for an hour or so . Any time I used after that occasion I had the same reaction  , so I believe  I developed an allergy to it, when first using it though it worked well so I am still going to leave 5 stars as the manufacturer can&#x27;t control skin allergies.</li>
    <li> I love this facial cleanser. It makes my face feel so clean! It has really helped with my acne.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great, It has made my face younger looking. The only reason I am not giving a 5 star rating is because it leaves my skin feeling a little dry, but I put on my moisturizers and we are good to go.</li>
    <li> This product is quickly turning into one of my favorites! Now face washing doesn&#x27;t seem like a chore anymore. The smell is invigorating, compared to the medicinal smell of most purifying cleansrs, Gentle enough to use everyday yet strong enough to cleanse my skin of all impurities. Can&#x27;t wait to purchase more products!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cleanser with my konjac sponge in the shower every morning and I really like the smell! My skin feels cleansed but not dry afterwards .Very nice!</li>
    <li> A nice light citrus fragrance scent. I&#x27;m always leery of new facial products but I think I&#x27;ve found a keeper. It doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out and the exfoliant helps my skin feel smoother. I&#x27;m happy that it&#x27;s oil free and has not caused any irritation.</li>
    <li> This product really works if you have oily skin.  It does tend to dry out the skin so I only use it once a day in the morning. At night I use a hydrating night moisturizer.  My chin acne has really cleared up. So grateful I was able to buy this on their promotion of a dollar cost.  I will definitely buy this in the future and probably their moisturizer too when the product I&#x27;m using now is gone. Thank you Bella Yasa!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a week now, and I absolutely love it! I will definitely be buying more. It not only smells great but it makes my skin feel healthy.</li>
    <li> I just couldn&#x27;t get enough of this face wash! First off, it has an FABULOUS citrus fragrance that I just can&#x27;t get enough of. I open it to get a whiff every time I walk into the bathroom! This wash cleans the skin thoroughly and helps with breakouts without over drying. I am happy to recieve this product to review! I would recommend it as I love it!</li>
    <li> I used this product this morning. Amazing!!!  The citrus, papaya smell is so great in the morning. I put mine in the shower so I could use it daily. It feels soft and smooth and made nice bubbles. Did I mention how amazing it smells?!  Love this wash!!</li>
    <li> This smells AMAZING!! My favorite cleanser of all time. It is also easy to control the amount used so that you do not go through the very nice large sized product too fast. This is well worth the money and will last a long time. I combine this with a vitamin C serum and just love my nightly skin care regimen.</li>
    <li> Great product! Exactly as described! Would recommend!</li>
    <li> Nice scent, and is gentle enough to use twice a day.  The pump dispenser is also great.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t think this acne wash works very well. It made my face break out more than it originally was. I would not recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Great facial wash and smells good too!</li>
    <li> Pleasant smell, leaves face feeling clean and refreshed. Would definitely buy again!</li>
    <li> does it get worse before it gets better with this cleanser??!!</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive, acne-prone skin.  I always hesitate to try new cleansers, as I am afraid they will either make me break out or dry my skin out.  I was pleasantly surprised with this product.  My skin is not too dry, and I haven&#x27;t noticed any breakouts.  The scent is very pleasant as well.  I would recommend this product!</li>
    <li> Smells good.  Works fairly well but burns my eyes.  I mistakenly got the solution to close to my eyes and the burn was intense.</li>
