<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I am using this as a substitute for Tiger Balm. It provides instantaneous relief. I have tried every ointment out there for relief of muscle spasm caused by cervical problems and this is the best so far.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t produce the promised heat and the odor is overpowering. Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> Best cream my spouse has used for his chronic pain to date</li>
    <li> Been using this lotion for many years It is excellent for the purposes noted; however, another excellent use is to apply to any area of the body where skin is &amp;#34;itchy,&amp;#34; including sensitive skin around face and neck.  Excellent results with a cessation of the itch rapidly normally.</li>
    <li> I love this Body Heat. It really work fast!</li>
    <li> My wife is in serious pain. Body Heat helps her so much. When she could not get it for a few months as it was sold out everywhere her only option was to increase her pain medications which didn&#x27;t give her the relief she received from&lt;br /&gt;Body Heat. It was hard on all of us during that period.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you for fixing the problem it is really helping her again.</li>
    <li> This product was gone for a while and I really missed it. I love to use it in massage. The only thing about this product I don&#x27;t like is you can&#x27;t put it on apply any heat after you have it on. Like your heated table pad. It really turns up the heat of this product.</li>
    <li> This is the only lotion I have used that helps my arthritic knees to bend easily. It has made walking much easier.  I also use it on my back which I injured earlier this year. It eases the tight muscles. The scent is pleasant and not overpowering like some others. It&#x27;s a little expensive but worth every penny.</li>
    <li> Best stuff on the market works great for pains and aches. Used it for years. The smell of vanilla is great. You put it on and it worked for hours.</li>
    <li> Love this &amp;#34;special sauce&amp;#34;. Excellent  on stiff muscles.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve found it very effective for a stiff neck and sore back.&lt;br /&gt;I like the vanilla scent... Not too strong and relaxing.</li>
    <li> This Body Heat Vanilla rub works fantastic. And smells very good too! I bought some locally years ago and couldn&#x27;t find it in stores recently, so was happy to find online when I wanted it again. I like this product because it contains arnica, which I swear is a miracle; and aloe which is also amazing for ailments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My husband was surprised how well it worked on his hockey sore muscles the other night. In fact he has talked about it several times since, lol. I think he was hesitant to believe how hyped I was about it. Maybe because it smelled good, not nasty like other creams he has used for soreness. Anyway, now he loves it too!</li>
    <li> Would not use any other product.  I put it on where it hurts on my knees and go to bed.  I am able to sleep all night&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this for about 2 years.</li>
    <li> This rub really works well for me and the smell is quite pleasant (you can purchase unscented, but I personally love the vanilla).  You do need to ensure the bottle is shaken/mixed well before use.  It&#x27;s calmed minor aches as well as the neuropathy I experience in my hands and feet.  However, it does nothing for my husband.  That said, different strokes for different folks.  I found something that delivers for me and it&#x27;s now the only pain relief rub I use.</li>
    <li> This is terrific stuff!  Works wonderfully for aches and arthritis.  Smells great also.</li>
    <li> This stuff work and is great. I like the pump, I have a smaller size so I can refill for travel use. I tracked this down when I couldn&#x27;t find it locally. It does have a slight menthol smell but that is an  ingredient that helps stop the muscle pain. I have chronic whiplash so use almost everyday. It last a long time. The msm also appears to be a grade that actually works.</li>
    <li> Great product - I actually get it for my mom, who has problems with her sciatic nerve and this really helps with the pain.</li>
    <li> Good product but did not include pump top as pictured.</li>
    <li> I just received this in the mail. My legs and back are in bad pain so I was really happy to receive it. The problem is the scent is so horrible.  I thought it was going to smell decent and like vanilla.  To me and my family it smells like strong Pepto Bismol. Every one had to move away from me. I was hoping so badly I could use this. It did help help my pain for about an hour, that&#x27;s a big deal to me. I won&#x27;t purchase it again though unless some how I get use to the awful smell. It&#x27;s nauseating. I certainly don&#x27;t want to smell something so awful while I&#x27;m in pain. I don&#x27;t see how anyone could tolerate it. I put 3 stars because it did relieve some pain.</li>
    <li> Another great product from Aloe Life. Vanilla Heat is my go-to product for sore muscles and joints. Super fast shipping - thank you so much!</li>
    <li> Excellent cream for sore muscles/joints. It works.</li>
    <li> Works very well on lower back arthritis.</li>
