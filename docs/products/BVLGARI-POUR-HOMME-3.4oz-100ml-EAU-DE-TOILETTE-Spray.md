      <li>Scent last maybe 15 minutes at most and really doesn&#x27;t smell as good as most of my knock-off colognes.</li>
      <li>This is a review of the BVLGARI POUR HOMME EAU DE TOILETTE SPRAY product as sold by OTC in August 2014, and focuses only on whether the product was genuine and in good condition.  </li>
      <li>Obviously I think it’s a good product</li>

      <li>The fragrance is ok, I would say the same as original.</li>
      <li>(Or maybe it&#x27;s just the first part of the sentence that&#x27;s correct).</li>
      <li>I thought this would be no fake, no problem, coming from Amazon.</li>
      <li>Were the positive reviews planted by the vendor?</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this seller as well!  </li>
      <li>I was on high alert when the product arrived.</li>
      <li>: I have seen this item sold directly by Amazon.</li>
      <li>/&gt;This is not a review of the quality of the product generally.  </li>
      <li>I used to order it from another vendor, but found it&#x27;s a little less at Amazon and the service is faster and better.</li>

    <li> This is my favorite men&#x27;s cologne.  It smells fantastic on anyone.  I highly recommend this seller as well!  The price was unbeatable!</li>
    <li> This is a great product at a comparable price to other sellers.  It&#x27;s a classic fragrance that smells good on everyone.  I used to order it from another vendor, but found it&#x27;s a little less at Amazon and the service is faster and better.</li>
    <li> Smells good I just wish it would last a little longer</li>
    <li> WONDERFUL PRODUCT! ARRIVED IN TACT.</li>
    <li> Love this product.  Smells great. My wife loves this cologne on me and she&#x27;s very happy I purchased this item again.</li>
    <li> Great item and great experience!!!</li>
    <li> I love this cologne it came in timely manner thank you</li>
    <li> Bought this as a Christmas gift for my boyfriend. 100% sex appeal in a bottle, imo. Classy, sexy, refined, manly...I can&#x27;t resist this scent on him.</li>
    <li> One of the greatest smelling mens sprays, ever!</li>
    <li> This product (purchased at SV ENTERPRISES) has almost no durability, as a similar item purchased in a regular fragrance store (the fragrance itself is outstanding).&lt;br /&gt;*Update*: I have seen this item sold directly by Amazon. I thought this would be no fake, no problem, coming from Amazon. I purchased this again, and to my surprise this was even worse than the previous one. The fragrance is ok, I would say the same as original. But it lasts for the time it takes the spray to get to my skin (just enough for me to smell it). On the upside, I got refunded by Amazon, after a first contact, with no disputes.&lt;br /&gt;In conclusion, it seems it is hard to get a satisfactory item, if not by usual distribution channels.</li>
    <li> Definitely not worth the $60 odd dollars I paid. Scent last maybe 15 minutes at most and really doesn&#x27;t smell as good as most of my knock-off colognes. Dont waste your money!</li>
    <li> great price and got it quick</li>
    <li> One of the best clean scents a man can wear.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this cologne for some time now, and obviously am very happy with it. I don&#x27;t quite understand the 2 negative reviews claiming that the product sold was a knock-off of some sort. Mine said it was supplied by OTC trading, and after reading those reviews (after I&#x27;d ordered!) I was on high alert when the product arrived. I pored over the bottle and the packaging - comparing it to ones I already had which had been purchased at full retail. If these are copies, then they  are flawless copies. The scent seems the same. This internet thing is a minefield! Were the 2 negative reviews actually bogus reviews planted by who knows? Were the positive reviews planted by the vendor? Perhaps I am just a tool of somebody else. (Or maybe it&#x27;s just the first part of the sentence that&#x27;s correct). My brain hurts!</li>
    <li> This is a review of the BVLGARI POUR HOMME EAU DE TOILETTE SPRAY product as sold by OTC in August 2014, and focuses only on whether the product was genuine and in good condition.  The product I received certainly appears to be genuine and in excellent condition.  I was nervous about ordering from an on-line retailer that may offer counterfeit or stale goods.  That was not the case here; everything was correct.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is not a review of the quality of the product generally.  Obviously I think it’s a good product or I would not have ordered it, but you should try it yourself and form your own opinion as to whether it’s a good match for you.</li>

    <li> My husband loves this fragrance.  Reasonable price and good customer service, I have reordered this item a few times.</li>
    <li> Lasts about 2 hours. Thats the best that i can expect. Was shipped quickly.</li>
    <li> Good~&lt;br /&gt;Seller&#x27;s services is very nice^.^</li>
    <li> Fast delivery, great price.</li>
