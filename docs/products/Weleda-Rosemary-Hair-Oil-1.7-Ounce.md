<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> It is not a cure for my extra dry hair but when I use it, it makes my hair very soft. Beware of the allergies! I love it!</li>
    <li> It does make your hair softer and more moisturized I&#x27;ll give it that, but the Rosemary smell is just too overwhelming in my opinion....</li>
    <li> I used this for the first time this morning, and it left my hair looking disgusting even after being washed twice.  Will be returning this product if I still have the packing slick</li>
    <li> This really is a multi-purpose and natural product. I have just gone through my second bottle. I bought this originally for myself because I had itchy scalp. It helped and had the extra bonus of moisturizing my hair. I started using it on my daughter&#x27;s hair which is thick, curly and tends to get dry and frizzy. I rub a few drops into damp just washed hair starting from the ends and avoiding the roots. It works really well and  if you use it sparingly it does not make your hair greasy unless you have very fine hair then I would use it BEFORE washing as a mask. It will make your hair super soft after you wash it out. I also read that rosemary repels lice. Who knows...I love it.</li>
    <li> Love this and love the smell. Makes my hair soft and shiny but not greasy</li>
    <li> I have been blessed and cursed with extraordinarily thick, very coarse hair that is nearly impossible to control unless I keep it very short and use lots of product. I have decided to allow my hair to grow, which makes styling time horrible. I found this product a couple of months ago and am thrilled with how much it softens my hair. I personally don&#x27;t mind the smell as others have complained. But this is one of the only products I have found that truly tames and conditions my hair from straw-like consistency to soft silk. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> I have very light highlighted blonde hair, not natural of course lol. I have breakage, dryness, and my blonde locks can feel quite coarse at times. I&#x27;ve used deep conditioners (every kind) and as it may make me hair feel silky while rinsing it out and while its sill wet, once it&#x27;s dry it is still frizzy and feels somewhat coarse. I even contemplated chopping most of my hair to get rid of the damaged ends. But I have always had longer hair and I don&#x27;t like how I look with short hair. I then started realizing that your typical &amp;#34;deep conditioners&amp;#34; were not helping because of all the chemicals in them and I needed something natural to really penetrate my hair and help it. I tried coconut oil, that was okay. I tried olive oil treatment, that didnt make much of a difference... I then tried this rosemary oil. And oh my lord, it was amazing. Didn&#x27;t seem like much when it was on my hair, but after it was shampooed and rinsed out, it was amazing. I first shampoo&#x27;d my hair, put the rosemary oil throughout all my hair focusing on the ends, put on a shower cap and let it sit in my hair for 3 hours. The longer the better. Over night is great too. Then rinse it out with warm water, shampoo and use daily conditioner as usual... And voila. My hair looked so much more healthier, you could barely tell I had any split ends and was soft, silky with no frizz. And that&#x27;s pretty amazing since my hair is a dry blonde chemical disaster. My hair has improved drastically once adding weleda rosemary to my beauty regimen. It didn&#x27;t dull out my color either like olive oil does. You should definitely try it! You won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
    <li> This product is just awesome. My hair was damaged really bad because of the regular use of flat iron.&lt;br /&gt;I have used it just once and it works wonders.&lt;br /&gt;My hair has become very soft and manageable. No split ends and hair looks healthy and shiny.&lt;br /&gt;I just love this product and would recommend it highly!</li>
    <li> A little goes a long way, I put a few drops in my palm and mix in my Paul Mitchell Flexible Style glaze and it makes my hair feel softer.</li>
    <li> I READ REVIEWS ON THIS PRODUCT &amp; DECIDED TO TRY IT. TO START I HAVE CURLY HAIR THAT IS PRONE TO DRYNESS &amp; FRIZZ. THIS PRODUCT GOES ON NICELY IT&#x27;S NOT HEAVY OR OVERLY GREASY. IT ADDS A NICE SHEEN TO MY USUALLY LACK LUSTER  HAIR. THE SMELL IS FRESH BUT DOES FADE WITH TIME. MY HAIR AND SCALP JUST DRINK UP THIS GREAT OIL I LOVE IT.</li>
    <li> Weleda Rosemary Hair Oil was recommended to me by a friend.  And it was the best suggestion I&#x27;ve ever received.  Ater losing all my hair to chemo, I was nervous about how to treat my brand new -- and very diferent -- hair.  I didn&#x27;t want to start piling on all the products with the chemicals and petroleum bases, etc.  But I needed something or my dry scalp.  This product not only solved the itching problem, it has provided smoothing, without lingering \\&quot;oiliness,\\&quot; has encouraged continued healthy hair growth. And it smells good, to boot!  I use it twice a day, and couldn&#x27;t be happier.  My hair is kinky/curly soft and fine.  With this Rosemary Oil product I can do wash and go with curl or blow dry safely for a smoother look.  I can&#x27;t say enough positive</li>
    <li> I have been punished by karma I guess, because I have inherited pretty thin hair that tend to fall out easily. I have been looking for a product that improves hair growth. Don&#x27;t know if it even exists. Rogaine can&#x27;t be used by women, so well, bad luck. When I came across this product at my hair salon, it looked promising also being a natural product. I used it as directed for a month now and not only running it through my hair, but I also massage it into the roots. I don&#x27;t want to sound overly optimistic, but I think my hair is not falling out at the same catastrophic rate as it used to. That&#x27;s a good news. Now, the bad news is that this oil is well - oily. It takes 2-3 shampooing to wash it out. Small price to pay for good results.</li>
    <li> My hair falls below my waist and, naturally, the ends are a little dry.  I apply this hair oil and it really helps improve the look and texture of my hair.  It also lessens the static electricity and makes it easier to braid.  The fragrance is very light.  It reminds me of a garden.  I highly recommend this item.</li>
    <li> The box advertised is the older box which lists the original ingredients. I was miffed when they sent out Rosemary Conditioner oil. I called the company and she stated it was the same as before. I have used this for several years and this &#x27;conditioner&#x27; to me is NOT THE SAME. I think the fragrance is different and the texture and oil color is different. Seems the vendor has a clue because they state in small print actual box may be different. Generally I loved this product before it became &#x27;conditioning oil I feel like there was overt misrepresentation on the vendor&#x27;s part not to CHANGE THE PHOTO AND LIST THE CORRECT INGREDIANTS on the blue box. The company rep stated the green box and formula has not been in use for five years.</li>
    <li> I try to use only all-natural products and love many Weleda products. This hair oil is not an exception. My hair is very dry and frizzy and Rosemary Hair Oil helps to tame split ends and dryness. It smells great and really works as promised!</li>
    <li> This product moisturizes, reconstructs and gives more volume ( a least an impression) on my thin hair. I use it as hair mask about once or twice per week. I cannot use as a hair serum daily, because it does make my hair greasy and/or opaque.</li>
    <li> The quality of the product is great, but the consistency is too oily. Do not work on fine hair, too greasy, leaves a residue.</li>
    <li> I read about this oil in a magazine to use to restore dry damaged hair and to remove build up on the scalp on the hair, so I thought I&#x27;d give it a try. I followed the instructions- rubbed it into my scalp and hair thoroughly and let it sit for 45 minutes under a shower cap. I then shampooed and rinsed it as usual, and did put any conditioner in my hair. As soon as I got out of the shower I could feel the difference. My hair felt like and airy, clean and soft. It really did feel as though all the build up was gone and only my hair was left, happy and healthy. Two weeks later, my hair still looks and feels great, so I plan to use this maybe every 5-6 months as a recharger for my hair. Also, smells good!</li>
    <li> I wanted to use for my natural african american hair.  I was excited to get it, but it doesn&#x27;t state that it has nut oil in it on line.  SO I ended up giving it away.  I am deathly allergic to nuts.  I am glad I just happened to read the box when it arrived.  Otherwise I could&#x27;ve been dead.  Anyways, my sister inlaw said it works great for her and her baby&#x27;s hair.  I give it a 3 because it was a dangerous purchase for me, but would&#x27;ve given it a 5 because my sister inlaw loves it.</li>
    <li> I love this product. It&#x27;s amazing how well it works, really makes a big difference with my hair. Thank you.</li>
    <li> I really like the way this oil smells, but I think it is just not right for my hair. If I put even the smallest amount in my hair, it gets this heavy, greasy texture that is really unpleasant. Now I use the oil to scent henna hair dye, which makes it smell a bit better, but I don&#x27;t find it has any lasting effect on the scent or quality of my hair. That&#x27;s just been my experience, though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If your hair responds well to having oils added to it, this would be a good option. It smells great!</li>
    <li> Main ingredient is Peanut oil. There is nothing to say - it is cheap product in a cheap package. I don&#x27;t even think that it is &amp;#34;Made in France&amp;#34;  because the package looks like made in third world country.I&#x27;ll never buy anything from this company. very disappointed and need to search proper hair oil without bad ingredients. I made mistake to trust &amp;#34;Made in France&amp;#34; label.</li>
    <li> this is a great conditioner for my hair. I wish Target would start restocking it again. I have used it for 4 yrs.</li>
    <li> I love the smell. I don&#x27;t use it a lot, but it adds that extra sheen that I like to m hair.</li>
    <li> I always have a hard time finding it in stock but it really smells pleasant and works for me in conditioning my hair. I have African American 3c to 4a hair if that helps anyone, and I tend to prefer medium dense oils as too light is not moisturizing and too heavy just weighs mine down this is an in-between and a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> I love this oil but, this is Waaaaayyy  too over priced by the seller!! I&#x27;ve gotten this for half the price before.</li>
    <li> I love this oil, my scalp is truly healthier and my hair is even growing.  Most importantly it is for a great value compared to the in store prices.</li>
    <li> It is good to my dry hair, it can make my hair more moist and lustrous. I regards it is a good product!</li>
    <li> good for dry hair. natural product. have purchased before and plan to continue. use about twice a week on hair and scalp and wherever on your body that&#x27;s dry.</li>
    <li> pretty good and quick really like it, not too oily, helps hair and color :)</li>
    <li> I love rosemary, it is my favorite scent in the world, so when I found this product I was very excited to try it. Usually I stick with Paul Mitchell Super skinny, When I received this product the shipping was very fast, and I liked the bottle and how much product you receive for the price. But here comes the issues when I applied to this my hair, it was so heavy and greasy, and not at all what I was looking for. When I use a hair oil I am looking for something that will not weight my hair down , clump strands of my hair together and overall look terrible. My hair is mid back length, and very course and curly. I straighten it with a round brush and blow dryer , or straighter as opposed to leaving it natural and curly. I do not know if that makes a differences but this product was terrible on my straight hair.  I only used a dime sized amount, and I hated it. I returned this product immediately, and bought the Macadamia Oil instead.  I have no idea where all of these positive reviews are coming from, but I agree with the other reviewer on how greasy and heavy it made my hair.</li>
    <li> Worked beautifully on my curly hair. Treat my scalp and keep it moist. I no longer have embarrassing flakes falling down my face or shoulder! That was a great relief. No more flaky scalp! Yayyyyy</li>
    <li> This hair oil is pretty concentrated, so it only takes a a few drops per washing. One bottle lasts me a good 3 months or so. I mix this with organic jojoba oil in my organic shampoo to create my own 2-1 conditioning hair wash, and my hair looks great--natural highlights show through, it&#x27;s soft and silky, and I love how the rosemary helps with adding volume. The smell is not strong enough to overpower my hair, which is nice, and it gives it a clean, herbal scent. I love this stuff, and definitely recommend it!</li>
    <li> This product has the most amazing rosemary scent. It&#x27;s light enough for my fine straight hair but also works on my husbands dry curly hair.  It&#x27;s 100% natural and the best hair styling product I&#x27;ve found!!!  I ditched all my pomades and mousses and sprays. I now use a salt spray to give my straight hair some volume and texture, and the Rosemary oil keeps the ends soft and tames fly-always. Love this product!!!!</li>
    <li> opened it and tipped it over and spilled it .. nearly every drop gone just like that - so this is not a fair rating. Sorry</li>
    <li> I have fine hair, and wondered how this oil would work. (No one likes the greasy look!)  So far, this product has been great, and with a little effort, rinses out making my hair soft and shiny, without looking like an oil slick.  (To further enhance getting conditioning oils out of my hair, I have a trick:  When I am ready to rinse, I first take some conditioner, and put in my hair with the oil. Then i comb thru and rinse. I don&#x27;t know why this works, but it seems to assist with the rinsing process. Anyone with scientific factoids to confirm or {kindly, please} refute, I would love to hear it. )  In closing, I did not find this product to smell too strongly- it isn&#x27;t artificial at all, and smells deliciously of Rosemary.  I will continue to use it as an occasional hot oil treatment- lovely!</li>
    <li> This was exactly what i once bought from store but its cheaper here. This oil really helped me in reducing hair fall and the fragrance us really good. I just love this oil.</li>
    <li> I have used this hair oil now for the better part of 10 yrs. Apply to damp hair, or dry. Make sure though, that when applying to damp hair, you don&#x27;t overdo it. Your hair will be gross and greasy. Light application when hair is dry, it comes out of the bottle fairly fast. You can warm this up in a small saucer and use as a deep overnight hair conditioner as well. It smells really pretty.</li>
    <li> I have dry hair even when using organic baby shampoo and this product has solved my problem! I apply a few drops either before bedtime or 2 hrs before a shower. I brush it through and go about my business (no cap needed). So far my hair feels thicker and softer. I love the earthy scent and the fact that it contains no toxic ingredients ... unlike most conventional conditioners. The bottle&#x27;s small but overall I&#x27;m saving money with Weleda because I no longer need to buy any other conditioner.</li>
    <li> Love it, it works well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only issue is the opening of the glass bottle. It could be designed better. Sometimes I overpour or underpour.</li>
    <li> I add this to my conditioner and like the smell it leaves and has helped by hair grow more.</li>
    <li> My hair was very dry and frizzy.  I have been using it for over 2 years. My hair has become much softer and under control.  Even my hair stylist said my hair has been improved a lot and asked me the secret.  But it is not a magic oil.  It won&#x27;t change your hair texture after one use or a month. Be patience.  One more tip is don&#x27;t over apply onto the hair. It will make your hair oily and sticky.  The trick is divide the hair by section, apply only a bit (like a penny size) at a time on your palm, twist the hair with two hands by section from the top to the bottom and let the hair absorb the oil.</li>
    <li> I have been using this hair oil for about 2 years.  I loved it right from that start.  I have very long (middle of my back), straight, fine hair, but a lot of it.  My hair is pretty healthy but since it&#x27;s fine, gets tangled and static-y very easily.  This oil really helps with that.  It also cuts down on split ends, which makes my hair cut last longer.  It makes my hair SO soft.  Like I said I have very long hair and I still am on my first bottle, a little goes a long way. I transfer a bit at a time into a tiny rubber bottle I bought at REI so I can control how much I use.  I use 6-8 drops on my damp hair every time I wash it.  If you try to use it straight from the bottle you get WAY too much, or at least I always did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recently moved and lost the oil for awhile, and was using \\&quot;it&#x27;s a 10\\&quot; leave in conditioner spray.  I just found the weleda last night and man, my hair is so thankful.  I forgot what I was missing!</li>
    <li> I have been professionally coloring my hair for over ten years to get rid of the gray. Obviously, my hair has become dry over the years and I won&#x27;t be going &#x27;natural&#x27; for a while. I&#x27;ve used various hair products over the years trying to give natural shine and smoothness to my dry ends. I was at Target when I saw this product, and since I had been impressed with their hand cream decided to give this hair product a try. I really like the rosemary smell and it does go away after about an hour so it won&#x27;t get in the way of any fragrances. I&#x27;ve tried using it in a couple of ways, right after shampooing when my hair is wet and after I&#x27;ve styled and blown dry my hair. I prefer to only put a drop of two on my palm after blow drying as I&#x27;m able to spread it better without having too much in any one spot. It doesn&#x27;t weigh my hair down (even though I don&#x27;t have a lot of hair, each strand is thick) but I do have to use sparingly because when I did put too much in, my hair didn&#x27;t move the way I like it to. Weleda&#x27;s Rosemary Hair Oil makes my hair look less dry and adds shine making my hair look healthier.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m always looking for some really good, natural product to use to help my hair stay healthy.  I think that this product does such a great job of it.  I never would&#x27;ve thought to buy this if my brother hadn&#x27;t tried it, but it worked so well for him that I decided to give it a shot.  I have to say that my hair feels and looks healthier than it did before.  My hair is definitely anything but thin, but like many others, my hair gets damaged after combing and falls in the shower lose hair in the shower.  It doesn&#x27;t help that my hair is also pretty curly.  That being said, after a couple of weeks of using this product, my hair isn&#x27;t as damaged, and as a result doesn&#x27;t fall out as much.  I will definitely continue to use this product, and I recommend it as a deep conditioner.  What I do is put a bit on the tips of my fingers, turn my head upside down to increase circulation, and rub the oil into my scalp in circular patterns.  If I have a little left on my hands I&#x27;ll just run my hands through my hair so that I don&#x27;t waste anything.  I usually do this the night before I shower, and then I shower right after waking up.  I definitely recommend that you don&#x27;t put this is your hair if you plan on going out in a few minutes or without showering since your hair will look greasy after application.  Hope this helps!</li>
    <li> This product works great on my scalp. I would highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Great sheen and moisture without greasy residue. It smells like rosemary. A great oil for any type of hair.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately in the hair product world, it&#x27;s difficult to tell what works and what doesn&#x27;t, especially since every one&#x27;s hair is different. So naturally, I wasn&#x27;t sure how this stuff would work, since I don&#x27;t want my hair to be oily. I have to say that this is a GREAT product. As long as you don&#x27;t overdo the portion control, this can be used as an every day hair product (or like the box says, as a restorative treatment). It makes my wavy/curly hair soft without the awful frizz I normally get post-wash. At first I used a little on the ends (avoiding the roots where hair tends to get greasy), but I&#x27;ve since found that mixing a drop or two in with a small amount of another gel or creme based product is even better. My favorite so far is this product mixed in with some Giovanni Hair Straightening Elixir. Love it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve also been having minor scalp problems lately, so I tried this on my scalp to see if it would help. So far so good. I haven&#x27;t itched quite as much and my scalp feels clean and fresh. I would definitely recommend this product!</li>
    <li> This was recommended by a friend who has chemo hair, like myself, and it does a nice job of conditioning and adding shine.</li>
    <li> This is a real winner.  I have extremely sensitive skin, so there are very few products that I can use &amp; was very happy to find something that leaves my hair looking good.  It doesn&#x27;t make my hair greasy or oily looking or feeling at all, just moisturized.  I put a small amount in the palm of my hand then rub into my hair every day.  Very pleasant odor to the oil; wish they made shampoo with this fragrance.  My hair is coarse and wavy.</li>
    <li> Use sparingly or hair will be very greasy.&lt;br /&gt;I love the fragrance and I love how soft and shiny my hair is after use - I have very long hair and this helps to keep the tangles under control and split ends at a minimum.</li>
    <li> Left my hair a little greasy after washing...  Not sure any of the benefits of this product are proven,  and the smell is sickening.  I would not purchase again.</li>
    <li> I love the smell and the fact that it makes my hair so soft. I have to hide it from my husband because he loves putting it on his love.</li>
    <li> I love this oil!!!  I shampoo at night, and rub about a dime size amount on my hair after towel drying (the longest part of my hair is about chin length, the layers growing out).  I have naturally curly hair, and this brings the curl out better than anything I&#x27;ve ever used!  And in no way does my hair look oily.  Even though it&#x27;s an oil, it seems to be water soluble.  It doesn&#x27;t matter if I put too much in because, in the morning, I wet my hair in the sink to set the curl right.  If it seems like there&#x27;s too much, I rinse an extra few seconds.  It doesn&#x27;t take much.  This is the happiest I&#x27;ve been with any hair product I&#x27;ve ever tried!</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this oil and how it makes my hair feel. In transition from permed to natural afro hair and this product,  although a bit pricey for the size I do really like how it conditions my hair.  It seems like a better quality of rosemary oil and thats why I prefer it better,  to other rosemary oils.</li>
    <li> something in the oil made my hair dry feeling and i did not like it at all.  I color my hair so maybe that is why the ingredients and my tendency to have hair on the dryer side require a lot of moisture.  I have some other products that work beautiful and I am happy with, just not this one</li>
    <li> Works well for scalp dryness and for stimulating hair growth.</li>
    <li> I love this oil! I have very soft but tightly coiled hair that loves this oil. I needed something that would give a shine and help grow my hair  (currently at 8 inches from 6). I also love that a little goes a long way. In stores around town this stuff can get expensive. Nicely priced and prime eligible!</li>
    <li> My mom use this in her hair and she loves it.she will buy this product again I wish they made a bigger bottle though</li>
    <li> I have naturally curly hair that tends to be on the dry side. I use a Cowash, that I purchase on Amazon (As I Am Cowash), and use this wonderful oil when my hair is still wet. After drying my hair, I reapply a thin coat of this oil on my hair. It is wonderful. And, whether I leave my hair curly, or straighten it, it always makes my hair shiny and conditioned.</li>
    <li> Works great on hair and has grown out my edges. I love it</li>
    <li> I have been using this hair oil for over 5 years now...love it. Love the smell of it, love the way it makes my hair feel after I use it. I typically massage a large quantity on my hair before going to bed and wash it out the next morning. This oil Nourishes my hair and helps it grow nice and strong.&lt;br /&gt;May not be suitable for styling or wearing out as it does have a strong rosemary smell - which I do love, but oil is thick and might leave your hair greasy if you don&#x27;t wash it away</li>
    <li> The natural rosemary frangrance of this product is a lot nicer than any of the \\&quot;argan\\&quot; oil type products. This natural oil also is a lot more pleasant to use then any of the silicon enriched products like most of the argan hair oils. Try it, it is worth a try. I actually also use this for my big full beard and can highly recommend it for beards as well!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Weleda is a company that believes in being responsible for the source of their ingredients and does not believe in any kind of animal cruelty in either the production of the ingredients or testing of their products. I support responsible companies like this and all the products are top notch!</li>
    <li> This is a very loud oil but it last very long and its good great buy!</li>
    <li> I use this like twice a week and the outcome still shocks me. It has a bit of a smell but not to bad, for the price, why not?</li>
    <li> LOVE LOVE LOVE It! Honestly you will definetly see a difference in the strength of your hair. I add this oil in conjunction with my other fave oils and it works really well on my natural hair. This is hands down a staple Oil And im on my third bottle! I honestly can&#x27;t see my hair regimen without this product... And the smell is a nice aromatherapy freshness that is awesome</li>
