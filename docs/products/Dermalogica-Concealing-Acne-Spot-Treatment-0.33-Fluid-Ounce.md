### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>The best thing for my skin has been coconut oil, an exfoliating treatment (I like Sonya Dakar), 500 mg of Niacin (taken after dinner with a glass of non-dairy milk) when I have inflammation and Dermalogica Spot Treatment.</li>
      <li>Works especially good for hypodermic pimple, but some times take longer to get rid of blemishes.</li>
      <li>Color blends in perfectly into my skin for the perfect camouflage.  </li>
      <li>As a acne treatment the best thing ever.</li>
      <li>Excellent product.</li>
      <li>it works for my now beautiful brown skin</li>
      <li>Great product.</li>
      <li>This is a great product.  </li>
      <li>Works great good product</li>
      <li>Great treatment for acne and spot treatment for pimples- plus the cover up effect makes this product my favorite!  </li>
      <li>It is wonderful because it&#x27;s skin toned for just about any light skinned person</li>
      <li>it works wonder for my skin, my face and my complexion, thank you dermologica thanks a great price as well!!</li>
      <li>While I love sulfur spot treatment I do not feel this one is effective.</li>
      <li>yes, they&#x27;d better do it without color at all.</li>
      <li>Texture is smooth and goes on easy.</li>
      <li>I used this product at a friends house and it was smooth and settled into my skin tone after applying.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
      <li>I fall in the light- medium range and this just looked brown on my skin.</li>
      <li>, \\&quot;Dermalogica Clean Start Hit the Spot\\</li>
      <li>and I use the Bare Escentuals mineral foundation over the top of it to blend it in while it works its magic.  </li>
      <li>It is pricey, but I have been using the same tube for months, so really a good value.</li>
      <li>You&#x27;re better off buying Clean and Clear spot corrector and a Revlon ColorStay concealer.</li>
      <li>There are many other acne products that work way better than this stuff</li>
      <li>Personally my skin responds better to a benzyl peroxide formula.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve trying a lot of different blemishes treatment for adult skin, and none of them worked as effective as that treatment.</li>
      <li>The pain and irritation clear up so quickly</li>
      <li>Not even close to light enough.</li>
      <li>I find dermalogicas entire acne line to be extremely overpriced for how mildly effective it is.</li>
      <li>Works well to help clear up pimples without drying out the skin like so many other spot treatments can.</li>
      <li>or there&#x27;s a complete cure for breakouts!</li>
      <li>and the pimple is 3 times smaller, less swollen and all together looking better.</li>
      <li>I think a few new tones are necessary for this product to work for most people.</li>
      <li>I am in my early 40s and have a constellation of acne on my forehead in the summers that will not go away for anything.  </li>
      <li>Not good coverage as derma products should be better than what this can perform.</li>
      <li>have had acne my entire adult life.</li>
      <li>Great for reducing the time of ugly, red breakouts.  </li>
      <li>Put on the clear spot corrector and let it dry and then put on the concealer.</li>
      <li>The &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; colored product is so dark it would only work on very tanned skin and would still need to be blended with makeup.</li>

<li> Sadly it&#x27;s a very small tube that doesn&#x27;t contain much, but it not only minimizes my acne</li>
<li> I think this probably works about as well as any product with the same active ingredient, but the color is a match only for people with a medium to medium-dark skin tone.</li>
<li> Does not dry out skin as much as other spot treatments.</li>
<li> but this makes the skin too dry</li>
<li> The color of this \\&quot;concealing\\&quot; acne treatment does not match my skin at all, it&#x27;s a very dark orangy tan color closer to an umpa loompa than a human.</li>
<li> I use this habitually on breakouts and they clear up within at least a day or two.  </li>
<li> I also didn&#x27;t notice any results with shrinking a blemish one bit, such a waste of money.</li>
<li> so be real careful with application.</li>
<li> Never use other acne spot treatments!</li>
<li> but it did help a little</li>
<li> and I have very little scarring.</li>
<li> But usually works</li>
<li> This stuff seriously dries up my pimples faster than anything else.</li>
<li> A little expensive for a spot cream.  </li>
<li> Don&#x27;t waste your money to look bad.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve seen dermatologists, I&#x27;ve used expensive prescription products.</li>
<li> It was STICKY...and the color is this awful dark orange tan hue.</li>
<li> I was very disappointed.</li>

    <li> I&#x27;ve trying a lot of different blemishes treatment for adult skin, and none of them worked as effective as that treatment. Works especially good for hypodermic pimple, but some times take longer to get rid of blemishes. But usually works overnight.&lt;br /&gt;And yes, they&#x27;d better do it without color at all. But effect worths everything.</li>
    <li> A little expensive for a spot cream.  Not good coverage as derma products should be better than what this can perform.</li>
    <li> Great product. As a concealer no use at all. As a acne treatment the best thing ever.I  just put it on overnight and the pimple is 3 times smaller, less swollen and all together looking better.</li>
    <li> This is a great product.  It works well and has color to it so it conceals. I Would definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> While I love sulfur spot treatment I do not feel this one is effective. The &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; colored product is so dark it would only work on very tanned skin and would still need to be blended with makeup. There is no way this could be worn during the day. Personally my skin responds better to a benzyl peroxide formula. I find dermalogicas entire acne line to be extremely overpriced for how mildly effective it is.</li>
    <li> it works wonder for my skin, my face and my complexion, thank you dermologica thanks a great price as well!!</li>
    <li> works omg it works for my now beautiful brown skin</li>
    <li> Great for reducing the time of ugly, red breakouts.  Color blends in perfectly into my skin for the perfect camouflage.  Does not dry out skin as much as other spot treatments.</li>
    <li> This stuff seriously dries up my pimples faster than anything else.</li>
    <li> Color doesn&#x27;t blend well with my skin tone or makeup. Therefore can only use at night before bed but it did help a little</li>
    <li> Never use other acne spot treatments! This is the only one you need.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have had acne my entire adult life. I have used everything on the market. I&#x27;ve seen dermatologists, I&#x27;ve used expensive prescription products. The best thing for my skin has been coconut oil, an exfoliating treatment (I like Sonya Dakar), 500 mg of Niacin (taken after dinner with a glass of non-dairy milk) when I have inflammation and Dermalogica Spot Treatment. The sulfur kills the bacteria and a tiny tube lasts so long. The pain and irritation clear up so quickly and I have very little scarring.</li>
    <li> Works great good product</li>
    <li> The color of this \\&quot;concealing\\&quot; acne treatment does not match my skin at all, it&#x27;s a very dark orangy tan color closer to an umpa loompa than a human. I do not suggest wearing this out in public to conceal a blemish. I also didn&#x27;t notice any results with shrinking a blemish one bit, such a waste of money. There are many other acne products that work way better than this stuff, \\&quot;Dermalogica Clean Start Hit the Spot\\&quot; is one of them!</li>
    <li> Great treatment for acne and spot treatment for pimples- plus the cover up effect makes this product my favorite!  Texture is smooth and goes on easy.</li>
    <li> I use this habitually on breakouts and they clear up within at least a day or two.  It is wonderful because it&#x27;s skin toned for just about any light skinned person and I use the Bare Escentuals mineral foundation over the top of it to blend it in while it works its magic.  Will not stop using this until it&#x27;s discontinued or there&#x27;s a complete cure for breakouts!</li>
    <li> I am in my early 40s and have a constellation of acne on my forehead in the summers that will not go away for anything.  I have tried every acne and clearing product on the market but this actually helps.  Sadly it&#x27;s a very small tube that doesn&#x27;t contain much, but it not only minimizes my acne but I appreciate the added concealer effect!</li>
    <li> Generally a big fan of d products but this makes the skin too dry so be real careful with application.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Works well to help clear up pimples without drying out the skin like so many other spot treatments can. The concealer works well. It is pricey, but I have been using the same tube for months, so really a good value.</li>
    <li> I think this probably works about as well as any product with the same active ingredient, but the color is a match only for people with a medium to medium-dark skin tone. I fall in the light- medium range and this just looked brown on my skin. Not even close to light enough. I think a few new tones are necessary for this product to work for most people.</li>
    <li> EW. I used this product at a friends house and it was smooth and settled into my skin tone after applying.&lt;br /&gt;This MUST be a different formula. It was STICKY...and the color is this awful dark orange tan hue. I was very disappointed. You&#x27;re better off buying Clean and Clear spot corrector and a Revlon ColorStay concealer. Put on the clear spot corrector and let it dry and then put on the concealer. Don&#x27;t waste your money to look bad.</li>
