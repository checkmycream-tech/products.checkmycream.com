    <li> My 3 year old hated the taste of these and refused to take them.  She asked for me to buy her previous gummy vitamins so we have gone back to our regular brand.</li>
    <li> these vitamins taste awesome!  After a long vitamin search, I have found one that all my kids(and me ;)) really like. WHile it tastes like a gummy bear, it doesn&#x27;t taste as sugary and artificial. The only reason I didnt give it 5 stars is because the vitamin/mineral content is OK, not great. It is not jammed pack with extras, but it does provide the basics for a good multivitamin.</li>
