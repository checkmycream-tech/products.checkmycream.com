    <li> I have purchased Silicon Mix Proteina de Perla from a drugstore in New York. I have 3b-4a BSL hair and I was just as impressed with Proteina de Perla as I was with the original Silicon Mix (although I personally prefer the original). The product is relatively inexpensive, has a (strong) pleasant smell and works great. I would recommend use of the Silicon Mix products as a deep conditioner before straightening hair. It is not meant for co-washing (conditioner washes) but I have used a small amount of the product in damp hair to promote and encourage beautiful hold without cruchiness.&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;*Wonderful scent&lt;br /&gt;*Great for deep conditioning&lt;br /&gt;*Inexpensive&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;*The smell can be strong and overpowering to smell sensitive people</li>
    <li> This is the best thing I have ever used for my hair. I use it once a week for my treated hair (I have highlights) and it leaves it so smooth and shiny! My husband loves it when I use it. I leave it on for a few minutes and thats more than enough. I truly do recommend this.</li>
    <li> I used this product on my lace wigs and the result was absolutely fantastic.  It&#x27;s always a problem keeping the hair soft, shinny and healthy looking.  But so far, it&#x27;s done just that.  Just remember, a little goes a long way.  In my opinion, most Silicon products works wonders my wig products.</li>
    <li> I buy this for my daughter&#x27;s very curly and dry hair.  We apply it to wet hair and comb through leaving it in.  It dries very soft and holds the curls in beautiful defined form.  Best hair product we have used in 12 years.</li>
    <li> I love this conditioner.  It leaves my hair super soft and it smells great. i leave it in overnight for a deep deep conditioner. Works great.</li>
    <li> I tried Proteina de Perla after a good friend recommended it.  I really didn&#x27;t expect much.  It is amazing! It leaves my hair soft, shiny and super bouncy. Since I have been using it, I don&#x27;t have split ends or breakage and since I&#x27;m not losing hair, my hair is longer than it&#x27;s been in a long time and still growing! I simply cannot say enough about this product. I hope they never change it or discontinue it.  I&#x27;ll be a consumer for life.</li>
    <li> I learned about this product from my hairdresser and it has done wonders for my dry frizzy wavy hair. it has made my hair soft, manageable and less frizzy. no more split ends&lt;br /&gt;too. I mix it with my regular conditioner&lt;br /&gt;everytime I condition and it keeps my hait healthy.</li>
    <li> Great smell which lasts for days. Excellent when you need a mild protein treatment. Relaxed hair comes out soft and manageable. I don&#x27;t have to add moisture after deep conditioning under heat for 30 minutes.</li>
    <li> Arrived quickly and smells awesome!</li>
    <li> The beauty supply store in my town sells this but only in the 8 oz. jar and with how thick my hair is that only lasts me a week! I loved the conditioner but wasn&#x27;t happy about spending $6+ dollars every week. I was super excited to find this 60oz jar, I didn&#x27;t think it came this large! Needless to say this has saved me lots of $$$$ and once my supply is low I will definitely be restocking again, it has a light pleasant scent to it and it moisturizes sooooooo welllllllllll! I highly recommend it to anyone!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff and can&#x27;t see my life without it. I feel I can do whatever to my hair since I&#x27;ve found this stuff. I bleach and dye my hair and it would usually damage or break real bad but I use this stuff after I wash my hair and I deep conditioning under a dryer and protects and strengthen my hair wonderfully.</li>
    <li> I love it I&#x27;m hooded and will never use another conditioner makes my hair extra soft n it smells so good</li>
    <li> I very good product smells good and it works very good moisturizer. And it smells good.</li>
    <li> Great cream, fast delivery</li>
    <li> Every since I started on my healthy hair journey, I&#x27;ve been reading about the taboo of mineral oil on the hair and because of that I shied away from Silicon Mix Pearl Protein even though I heard good reviews.  After deeper thought and more reading I realized that any mineral oil in a deep condition will be washed out.  So, a few months ago I found this product in my local super market and decided to try it.  I have never had a deep conditioner give me such soft and manageable hair and silicon mix peal protein has been a mainstay in my regimen since.  I purchased 60oz because stores tend to run out of this product often and at the most inconvenient times.</li>
    <li> Love this product....starting using it years ago but couldn&#x27;t get it from the company....NOW that I&#x27;ve found it again will be using it on my hair always little goes a long way I bought the large bottle &amp;&amp; it was full to the brim love it!!!!</li>
    <li> Perfect product and arrivied in my home on time</li>
    <li> I have only used this once but I really like it.  It goes on more like a deep conditioner than a protein conditioner and leaves my hair very smooth and tangle-free.</li>
    <li> Silicon Mix Protein de Perla is one of my most loved staples. When some one ask me what treatment they should use for dry, breaking hair , I tell them to use Silicon Mix de Pearla for 30 min. With saran wrap and a plastic cap on top. Sit under the dryer for 30 min. The results are just amazing!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I luv the color of this product . It reminds me of the sea. It smells fresh and clean. Its thick and creamy so its great for thick dry, damaged, hair or any type hair. It&#x27;s great for straight hair wavy,curly,thick,thin, any type of hair can benefit from from this fantastic treatment. All Silicon Mix Treatments are the best Dominican treatment on the market. Silicon Mix treatment out sell all the other Dominican treatments. It&#x27;s my favorite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It works best if you use the shampoo, conditioner,treatment,leave-in. You get the best results when you use the entire line together. You are going to luv the results.</li>
    <li> I love the smell &amp; How it makes my hair feel.</li>
    <li> I use these produce on  every single one of me clients. The results are absolutely beautiful. The hair is left light, silky and shiny. I do recommend this product for African American.</li>
    <li> Excellent product! This is a whole lot better than the silicone mix bamboo conditioner.</li>
