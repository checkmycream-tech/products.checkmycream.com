    <li> This polish is beautiful!  I got the little set in my stocking &amp; had to rush out to get a full bottle before all the Christmas polishes disappeared.  Actually, I own a couple OPI Gwen Stefani nail polishes and like them all and I am not a glitzy person.  This polish works well on me with my yellow undertones in my skin.</li>
    <li> An amazing color!  Everyone should add this to their polish collection!  I never wear this that I do not get compliments daily!</li>
    <li> product is exactly what I wanted, item arrived  on time and in good condion</li>
    <li> I found this polish at nail salon yesterday and had to sing it&#x27;s praises. It is a deep red-violet shade that truly would work well with all skin tones. Yes, it is iridescent but subtle enough for day and fabulous for evening. I am very pleased-so much so that I purchased a bottle!!!</li>
