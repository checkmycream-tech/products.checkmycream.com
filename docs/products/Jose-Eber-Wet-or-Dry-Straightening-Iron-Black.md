<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Only thing I like about this straightner is it can be used on wet or dry hair. It works well for my occasional use to straighten bangs but would not purchase again. Looks cheaply made and I&#x27;ve seen better quality straightners at local stores for less money. Have to prop it against something to keep it from falling over when using. Does not look exactly like the picture. Would not purchase again.</li>
    <li> I highly recommend this Iron!!  It does not burn your hair.  I have used it WITHOUT a heat protecting spray.  It worked fine for me.</li>
    <li> This straightener is just as described.  I could use it everyday on my hair , damp or dry, without hair damaged look.  Delivery was fast.  I am very happy with this product line.</li>
    <li> I like it ,, it makes my hair very soft and straight I recommend this for u specially if u have difficult hair</li>
    <li> This is a purchase I have not regretted. I have fine, stick straight hair that never holds a curl for more than 20 minutes, even with a lot of hairspray. So why would I want a flat iron? A friend of mine who has similar hair told me about curling her hair with a flat iron to get pretty, loose waves that you see on all the celebrities. So one day when I was at the mall and got accosted by the kiosk salespeople I thought I&#x27;d try it. The woman showed me the technique and did a few curls, promising me it would hold all day without any hairspray. Yeah right, I thought. I took her up on that promise and walked around the mall for the rest of the afternoon, and then went home for the evening. Curls were still there. Next morning when I woke up the curls were STILL in place! Unbelievable. So I bought one. It really does work that well. The steam that comes out when you use it can be a little disconcerting (am I burning my hair?) but be assured it&#x27;s steam, not smoke! I find the flat iron works best  on hair that I&#x27;ve just blow-dryed, so slightly damp, and no need for any type of hairspray or styling product. Sometimes I think my hair looks even better after a night of sleeping on it. I&#x27;ve tried a couple of times with wet hair, doesn&#x27;t entirely dry your hair like they promised, and for me using a blow dryer is a lot faster. One star off for their supposed \\&quot;lifetime\\&quot; warranty. You have to show original receipt to get a replacement,  something I didn&#x27;t realize until after I had used the product for awhile, and after a year and a half I have no idea where that receipt is.</li>
    <li> Arrived dusty but seemed genuine. Had to buy an adapter as it is a flat 2 pronged plug. To be honest I&#x27;m quite scared of using it. If I try use the hotter settings it crackles a lot. I won&#x27;t leave it plugged into the wall as it gets warm and a light is constantly on but none of the settings are pressed. It doesn&#x27;t grip as tight as my ghds so my hand aches when I straighten my hair. The good points is my hair looks very shiny after using it and it curls well. Have my doubts as to how long it will last ...</li>
    <li> So like most women who walk through the malls I have become accustomed to shrugging off the kiosk sales people. Being in sales myself I am normally very aware of their tactics. Today however I forgot one of the golden rules... Don&#x27;t be a sucker! I decided to listen to what the sales woman had to say, telling myself that I wouldn&#x27;t be conned. She showed me the $300 price tag printed on the box... Then go figure she was gonna cut me a deal... One day only sale, military discount, blah blah blah. I got taken for $145!!!! Now I did get a \\&quot;free\\&quot; leave in conditioner, but she decided that because it was such a deal the $80 bottle of serum she was gonna throw in was now not included! Haha... Like a previous review says do not purchase this in the mall.     Now for the product itself... I just had my hair cut this morning and I flat ironed it with a Remington Wet to Dry which I have used for years. I came home after purchasing the Jose Eber Wet to Dry and I could feel and see the difference. I have yet to use the product on damp hair, but from what I can tell this will be worth the money I paid for it. Just wish I had done some more research first!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a former beauty queen who used to spend an hour on my hair in the morning- 45 minutes blow drying thick long hair and fifteen minutes attempting to tame it before I usually gave up and put it in a bun or ponytail. I saw this in the mall and my boyfriend encouraged me to try it.    I was extremely skeptical given that I know a lot about doing hair from my years as a Miss America pageant contestant, but it was amazing. You can take your hair from soaking wet to dry very quickly. I usually do one pass at home and bring it to work for a ten minute touch up before work begins.     I got mine at the mall for pretty near the price here on Amazon, plus that included a lifetime warranty and lifetime of them doing my hair anytime I want to stop in the mall and have them do it. Yes, it was a splurge, but a definite upgrade from my $70 flat iron from Sally Beauty that was breaking my ends. All across the day my hair was attempting to return to its naturally curly state with that flat iron- not with Jose Eber. Once it&#x27;s straight, it&#x27;s straight. The guy at the kiosk did my hair the day I bought it and the curls stayed in all day- and all night- with absolutely no hairspray. Amazing! I have never reviewed anything on Amazon but was so compelled by this awesome product.</li>
    <li> I actually spent $300 on this product but I don&#x27;t even care that it&#x27;s $50 now because of how great it is!!!! I towel dry my hair as good as I can then I use this iron and my hair comes out like it was blown dry and ironed but in a quarter of the time. I also color my hair VERY frequently and other irons would end up being the color of my hair after I was done. Right now I have blue/black hair and I have not once had to clean this iron because it took the color of my hair. I also noticed that other irons would create some buildup with the products I would use in my hair to keep my hair healthy and it would be very hard to get off but this iron does no such thing. If you don&#x27;t have time to blow dry your hair GET this product!!! its lightweight, effective, and for $50 bucks... your can&#x27;t beat that. I wish I would have found this iron before spending $300 but I don&#x27;t care.. I have an awesome iron and I&#x27;m happy with my product :)</li>
    <li> This is a great product, especially for the price.  I had never used one before, but changed my hair style so I needed one.  It takes a little time to learn how to use a straightening iron, but it&#x27;s not that hard.  One of my friends told me to make sure you get to the roots of the hair and give it a double &#x27;pressing&#x27; before starting down the rest of the hair.  That really helped. If you get your roots really good, right from the start, the rest of the hair comes out great!  I also found that if you tilt the iron so that you are lifting the roots up instead of pulling them down, your hair looks fuller and you avoid that &#x27;wet rat&#x27; look.  LOL  Of course, you have to divide your hair into small sections starting at the bottom and working your way up to the top of the head.</li>
    <li> There is no need to pay the $300 (or whatever price you can negotiate for this) at the Jose Eber Kiosk in the malls. They use high pressure sales tactics telling you that Amazon and other companies who sell this are most likely selling refurbished or second hand products. If you do your homework you will find that companies such as Dead Sea who sells on Amazon are authorized distributors of the products. If you buy from the Jose Eber Kiosk you WILL get the EXACT same product for 7 times the price you should have paid. They do offer a lifetime warranty but keep in mind you would have to break your flat iron 7 times to make up the difference in price. Make sure to tell anyone you know looking for a flat iron NOT to buy this iron from the kiosk.    Okay, so onto to review the actual iron. My hair is coarse and naturally curly but not in a neat way that makes it easy to wear curly hair, so I like to straighten it. Typically I use the Chi, which works the best on my hair and I also like the Babyliss line. Both of these flat irons are a bit pricey but work and not all flat irons work. Here are the highlights of the Jose Eber iron:    It leaves my hair very shiny sleek and smooth looking    It doesn&#x27;t break off my hair like the Chi tends to do    The comb that comes with it is amazing...and maybe why I like the iron (haven&#x27;t tried the comb with the Chi)    The wet to dry works but it makes my hair poker straight with no body at all so I never use. I blow dry to add volume but have used it on damp hair. Also with the wet to dry feature, it takes a lot longer than blow drying as the wetter your hair the more times you have to pull the iron through it to get it dry. My hair is thick and this was a long process and I didn&#x27;t like the results.    The curling part is difficult to get the hang of but works if you can figure it out (I can&#x27;t consistently do it). Again, the comb is the key here as the comb grips the hair tightly and the flat iron doesn&#x27;t have a tight grip on the hair. This is something that is easier to do on someone else than to do on yourself.     All and all I am very happy with the flat iron and super happy with the comb. The comb is not high quality material so I am concerned about how long it will hold up and I think it is a staple to liking this flat iron. I was one of the unfortunate people who got pressured into buying this at a mall Kiosk and have told all my friends to buy it from Amazon. Those who have all had great experiences and received the exact same BRAND NEW flat iron that I paid 7 times as much for.</li>
    <li> Bought this because my sister first had it and I loved it. I knew what to expect because I used it before and it&#x27;s still a great product. Gets hair really straight and I love its design.</li>
    <li> I bought this straightener for christmas as my ghd broke, i was so excited, however i was very disappointed! The straightener won&#x27;t turn on!!! it doesn&#x27;t work!!!! DONT BUY!!!</li>
    <li> Great product, my daughter loves it</li>
    <li> This is my second Jose Eber flat iron - I lost my first one and no other iron I&#x27;ve had can compare. It slides very smoothly down your hair so it doesn&#x27;t create those unsightly crinkles, and can be used on wet hair, while most other irons can&#x27;t. It is comfortable to use, with 5 heat settings, and is very durable.</li>
    <li> I was first introduce to this iron at a mall stand; I liked the demonstration so much I ended up buying it on the spot and I have been using it for about two years now, no issues at all!! Makes my hair shinier than with any other brand used... My younger sister tried it and loved it too, so I checked amazon before going back to the mall and here I found it at a much better price!</li>
    <li> I used to have a Jose Eber straightener that I absolutely loved, so when i saw this one worth over double the value on sale for $40, I decided I couldn&#x27;t go wrong.  This is not a bad straightener, but it does not squeeze the hair as tightly as the other I had (which is important for people with finer hair like myself).  If I had to do it over, I would look for the model I had owned before.  However, I plan on using this one until it kicks the dust.</li>
    <li> Great straightener Love the heat... It does the job fast and with a silky shine...</li>
    <li> Hello&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for deliver&lt;br /&gt;I want to say that i have problem with the straightening&lt;br /&gt;Its not working&lt;br /&gt;Only the lights are shine without heat</li>
    <li> After a friend of mine straightened my hair with her professional-grade straightener and I experienced just how sleek and smooth my hair could become, I decided I needed to invest in one myself. The only problem was hers cost a whopping 200$...and... as a college student I just don&#x27;t have that kind of money lying around.  I was amazed to find this on amazon for a mere 37$ since the original price tag was almost ten times that. I did some research on jose eber products and most people absolutely LOVED his curling iron, so I thought I would be getting the same sort of quality with his straightener. Unfortunately you get what you pay for and it was definitely not what I had envisioned.  ..The seller got it to me amazingly quick, though. I ordered it Wednesday morning and it arrived on my doorstep Friday afternoon! Talk about speedy deliveries! This was with the FREE supersaver shipping that normally takes ages. So obviously I was pretty excited. Unfortunately, as soon as I opened the packaging I could tell my straightener was not \\&quot;brand new\\&quot; as advertised. The packaging surrounding the straightener was torn where one would normally remove it--as if someone had already opened and tried it out. The straightener itself was dusty and the ceramic plates have scratches and two small purple-looking dots.   However, I didn&#x27;t really care whether my straightener was used or not as long as it worked on my hair! I have frizzy curls and loved the look that my friend gave me with her straightener. I had long ago stopped using my conair one because my hair would never get very sleek... Straight, yes. But I ended up looking more like a shaggy dog... Also I thought the wet-to-dry would make it easier for me to get ready in the morning. So, on to actual usage:    This straightener has four heat settings: 220, 200, 180, &amp; 160  With dry hair........  --Straightens fairly easily with a few swipes just like my conair. I divide my hair and straighten the bottom sections first. I did notice that my hair was softer than usual after finishing  which was a nice added bonus. Plus there wasn&#x27;t any weird smell that I sometimes got with the conair. BUT! I again got that shaggy-dog look and nowhere near the sleek hair that I wanted. This was with the straightener on 220.    With DAMP hair........(I waited a particularly long time after showering to straighten my hair just to make sure it was DAMP not wet. I even blew-dry a few sections of the back just to be sure.)  --I started on the 160 setting just because I was afraid of heat on wet hair. From the first swipe I could hear sizzling. My hair was straight and dry afterwards, of course, but at what cost..... I was too afraid to keep going with the crazy crackle-pops and steam it was making so I decided to stop there and blow-dry it all.     So finally.......    If you are looking for a cheap straightener marginally better than your average conair piece--go with this one. It&#x27;s 37$ for goodness sakes!    If you are looking for a professional grade product I suppose you really do have to bite the bullet and save up a ghastly amount of money for one.    I gave a star for quick shipping and a star for making my hair soft. Unfortunately this is not what I wanted at all and I kind of think it was used anyways.......</li>
    <li> Item arrived quickly and is perfect!</li>
    <li> I LOVE this flat iron. BEWARE... watch the pricing for this. I have noticed by other reviews that it has sold for as little as $37. I paid $57 and then 2 days later it was on amazon for only $45 by the same seller (H.F. Beauty). It&#x27;s so nice to just get out of the shower, towel dry my hair and then dry and style at the same time with this flat iron. LOVE IT</li>
    <li> I love this straightener! I originally purchased the signature series Jose Eber straightener last year and loved it so much I purchased the Pro series this year just to make sure I would not be without one if the first one quit working. I have not experienced any problems with either unit as both continue to work as well as when first purchased. I cannot tell a difference between the two as the results are the same using both irons, the settings, size, handling and features are so similar and the color doesn&#x27;t alter it&#x27;s use or usefulness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair dresser used it on my hair once and I was sold. I had never used a straightener before but what a difference it made. My hair is quite thick, on the dry side and has a mind of it&#x27;s own but with this straightener, it has body and is softer than it has ever been. I have been using it nearly a year now (almost daily) and my hair is no dryer than it already was.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After completing my own research prior to my original purchase, I agree with other reviewers who stated that Amazon&#x27;s price is much less than you will pay in the malls or beauty supply shops. Also, both orders shipping time was much quicker than expected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They are great products and I am completely satisfied with my decisions to purchase them!</li>
    <li> This is the best hot iron I have ever used.  Can do my hair which is shoulder length in 15 minutes.  Seems like it does not dry out my hair either it is so soft and silky after I am done.  Great item to get if you use a flat iron. My others took 45 mins. I really like this one.  Should buy another for back up I like it that much.</li>
    <li> This straightener is amazing! I never write reviews but had to for this one!  It literally dried and straightened my hair in seconds..and left it sleek and smooth all day.  I have thick fluffy hair and it came out so straight and shiny! must have this tool!</li>
    <li> I tried out/had other straightening irons before, but after I used this one I got rid of the others. It&#x27;s a really good product!</li>
    <li> Connect the product was on time and deal with the seller very sophisticated product is worth the experience&lt;br /&gt;Worth 5 stars</li>
    <li> This is the best straightener I&#x27;ve ever owned. Better than Chi or Corioliss! No snagging,  temperature control, and makes my hair soft! Use wet ir dry, thick or thin hair. It&#x27;s top of the line!</li>
    <li> this product was great, until it stopped working. Maybe the buttons are stuck or something but the product constantly turns itself off while in use. Disappointed.</li>
    <li> Does what it says…no sizzle is my hair is damp from a shower.  No frizz, one swipe and my naturally very curly hair was shiny, smooth and straight.  Can adjust the heat too</li>
    <li> I LOVE my flat iron I thought I loved my Chi until I used this!!! I am so glad I did not buy this in the mall what a rip off I was so close to paying over $100.00... Glad my husband stopped me and found it on Amazon.com for me... This really does leave your hair silky soft straight which is a miracle for me I have very course,curly hair and it stays straight for days I only go 2 days but 2nd day requires very little touch up even after a hot shower!!!</li>
    <li> Bulky,heavy and gets too hot even on low...It was supposed to have floating plates and come with a special comb according to other reviews; however, mine had neither.  It gets extremely hot on low and it is quite heavy.&lt;br /&gt;I SO DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS IRON!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I love my hair straightener, it works great with wet or dry hair, it does not snag or pull your hair. Your hair glides smoothly through the iron. I also like the 4 heat settings, I use the lower one when my hair is wet and higher when it is dry. Great product, I&#x27;m so happy I bought it.</li>
    <li> This is the same company as Jose Eber&#x27;s website but they will not honor the warranty because it&#x27;s on Amazon. Iron is very cheap looking and wouldn&#x27;t recommend. Very disappointed when compared to my Jose Eber infrared blow dryer that I love. Don&#x27;t know where the quality went on this one. Most disappointing was thei customer service agents. They NEVER told me when I called Jose Eber directly that they were in fact the same company. They use the same shipping fulfillment center. Instead I was told that they can&#x27;t guarantee the quality or of its a counterfeit or fake if sold on Amazon. So I returned the iron bought it directly from &amp;#34;Jose Eber,&amp;#34; only to find out it was the SAME company for 1/3 more money!! Will never buy Jose Eber products again after this experience. Everything was returned. I&#x27;m very happy with my Corioliss Wet/Dry infrared iron. Very high quality as opposed to rhos piece of junk.</li>
    <li> No guide as to how to use it, what temperature etc. No UK plug included (bought via amazone but ordered from UK account so it should ring the bell</li>
    <li> The straightener works wonderfully with my hair, it makes the process of straightening much shorter and lasts so much longer than my old Paul Mitchell that broke. So this is an awesome replacement and definitely an upgrade. I&#x27;ve been using it for about a month now. I would definitely recommend this straightener to a friend.</li>
    <li> I bought this straightener at a kiosk in the mall about... 7 years ago. I was in 6th grade then. I have used it on an almost daily basis since then. I find it does not work very well wet to dry which is fine. It&#x27;s not good for your hair anyway, no matter what claims are made. The straightener, however, does not seem to damage my hair. It works fantastic, is SUPER durable and hasn&#x27;t given me any problems whatsoever. I&#x27;ve gotten 7 years of heavy and consistent use out of it. I am currently shopping for a new one only because I have used this thing so much it&#x27;s starting to get tiny scratches and cracks that are pulling out my hair but don&#x27;t let this worry you. Again like I said I&#x27;ve used this for 7 years straight. Also, there&#x27;s been dozens and dozens of times I&#x27;ve left this thing by accident all day. So as long as you don&#x27;t break this thing somehow...it will last you forever! This is a FANTASTIC iron and I highly recommend. When I bought it, it was $120 but it&#x27;s so cheap now. I might buy another one to replace my old scratched up stained, smelly one because i love it SO much!!</li>
    <li> It is good but some time it burn the hair if you use it a lot , I prefer if it is made by ceramic.</li>
    <li> My hair is very thick and curly and I always had a hard time finding a straightener that could do the job... My friend recommended the Jose Eber Wet or Dry Straightener to me. I&#x27;m glad to say it does the job and it does it well... from curls to beautiful straight silk and shiny hair!!!</li>
    <li> I saw this at the mall kiosk for $300!  Got my daughter one from Amazon for $60.  I tried it and it worked so well that I threw out the other one I had and ended up buying myself one too.  It heats up quickly and evenly and leaves our hair straight and smooth.</li>
    <li> YES!  I think it works better with some type of heating solution or hair solution to make your hair shiny and manageable.  If you work with it dry or just with water, your hair won&#x27;t have that straight smooth shape that you would like.  I like this straightening iron better than any I have ever had, though!</li>
    <li> give u shiny and healthy hair style in short time!!!!!!!!!!!! i totally like it ... i will advice my friends to order it</li>
    <li> This is a great product! Does straighten perfectly and leaves hair looking shiny and healthy.</li>
    <li> I bought one for my daughter over 4 years ago for $250 from a salon.  TSA must have broken when going through her luggage.  It was immediately replaced by customer service. My sister tried it and love it so I bought her one, I hated borrowing my daughter&#x27;s so I also bought one for myself.  I ended up buying 3 of these at Amazon.  It smooths out your hair and keeps it soft all day long. Compare to what I originally paid for this, it is definitely a great buy at Amazon.</li>
    <li> My hair is a hot mess so many curls and frizzy this iron is the best my hair is so straight and healthy looking.</li>
    <li> NOT even a year old and it doesn&#x27;t work.  The power constantly turns off after only a few minutes.  I hate it.  DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT.</li>
    <li> works great daughter uses it and loves it. Wife sometimes and loves it</li>
    <li> I wish I had known this item was available elsewhere. I bought mine at a kiosk in the mall. Ended up getting charged 3 times for it. Horrible experience. But GREAT product!!! I have long, very curly hair. And after washing, I wrap it up in a hair turban to pull the majority of the moisture out. Then I blow dry it on low heat to pull the curls out. Finally I use the Jose Eber iron. I use the 3 of 4 setting on mine for the best results. I can curl my hair or straighten it completely with one tool. This product has eliminated a lot of irons I had in my drawer. What I really like is that the curls really hold. I curled my hair last night. Before bed, I pulled my hair in a very high ponytail &amp; wrapped a scrungee around it. This morning, I simply undid the scrungee &amp; finger combed my curls down. Gorgeous - if I do say so myself. I don&#x27;t like to use a lot of heat on my hair. But I don&#x27;t like having to wet my hair every morning when I wear it curly. The Jose Eber iron does not give the \\&quot;hot hair\\&quot; smell. I don&#x27;t need any product whatsoever. I apply a little of Alterna Bamoo Oil serum on the ends - just to protect them since they are the oldest hair. But that is it! No hairspray, gel, hold cream. Nothing. This iron is amazing...... Period.</li>
    <li> My wife knew of this products reputation. I surprised her with a new one since  her old flat iron had just died. She was so happy when she opened the gift. She  says it has just the right temp. and just glides through her hair. Very important  when straightening and other things with her hair. Great Product.</li>
    <li> This iron makes my natural curls dead straight but also leaves my hair feeling soft and silky. I would definitley recomend it for girls with natually curly hair.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks&lt;br /&gt;JL</li>
    <li> before purchasing I sent him an email to ask if it is 2 inches or one he answered it is 2 inches but after receiving it I found it 1.5 inch , also I received it with some smal scratches.I don&#x27;t think this item is original or authentic at all .[[ASIN:B002LE8P6O Jose Eber Wet or Dry Straightening Iron, Black]]</li>
    <li> I sen this flat iron back as it does not have the ability to steam, unless they count the steam it creates if you use it on wet hair. There is no place to add water to it. It&#x27;s too bad as the one I used to have that you can add water to was wonderful (Maxiglide). You get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> I used to have a flat iron just like this but it broke and I didn&#x27;t have the money to buy another one. All of the flat irons I bought afterwards were supposedly &amp;#34;really good&amp;#34; flat irons according to friends and my hairstylist sister, but none matched up to this one. Then one day I searched for it on here and couldn&#x27;t believe the cost. Needless to say I ordered it immediately. Received it within a few days and it&#x27;s all I expected it to be. I highly recommend</li>
    <li> I enjoy the flat iron alot,I got the item a day earlier then date i was given.The first day,the stickers that cover the screws came off,it pulls my hair on the edges when do a lot of hair at a time. It leaves it smooth and not dry like my CHI.I used it with my hair little wet and it does the job too. I really enjoy the flat iron.</li>
    <li> Product looked used or refurbished when received.</li>
    <li> I actually was really pleased with this product. I had yet to buy a straighter worth more than $30, because I don&#x27;t usually straighten my hair. I heard good news about this on though so i was convinced and i bought it. Best investment!!&lt;br /&gt;My hair actually stays straight, even hours after straightening and even after playing with my hair AND after putting it in a pony for a couple hours while i ate. (usually this would leave me a soft bump, and eventually my hair would wave about 4 hours later).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only complaint, even though it&#x27;s not completely the straightener&#x27;s fault is that I saw an increase in split ends, which is why I wouldn&#x27;t straighten before... It&#x27;s kinda heartbreaking but it&#x27;s partly the heat and partly i guess not using enough products to protect my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Give and take i guess. I only use this straightener when i really feel like having a lasting makeover.. but unfortunately i know i will pay the price with split ends... but that&#x27;s just me....</li>
    <li> My hair takes ages for it to dry, and using a both a hair dryer AND a flat iron damages it so much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still try to leave my hair to air dry for as long as I can, and with this straightener, at least I&#x27;m not worried too much if some parts are still a bit damp, since this is made to work with wet hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The results look much better and it takes less time to straighten my hair the dryer it is, of course.&lt;br /&gt;and also, my hair requires very high temperatures for me to get the results I want, and this thing gets EXTREMELY hot, so it works for me.</li>
    <li> Works very well. Takes a little longer on wet hair but faster then drying before straightening. Love that you can use in multiple countries</li>
    <li> I was sold on this iron after reading reviews and visiting Jose Eber website so I ordered two, one for me and one for my sister. Considering the price and the product description, I expected the iron to have easy to use temp controls and … o well… work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Firstly, they shipped me a straightening and a curling iron instead of 2 straightening irons. Nope did not want a curling iron. Secondly, the straightening iron was a HUGE disappointment. Why -&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- It is made of cheap looking plastic, and has cheap buttons and LED&#x27;s for temp settings.&lt;br /&gt;- its frustrating to press one button 4 times to get the temp setting you want.&lt;br /&gt;- its got a loose cord connection so only works when the cord is in a certain position&lt;br /&gt;- its blue light constantly flickers nervously when used with 120V&lt;br /&gt;-turns off unexpectedly while you are working with your hair&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would not even pay $20 for a product like that.</li>
    <li> I borrowed my daughter&#x27;s iron &amp; loved it do much, I just had to have one. It works beautifully and is not heavy.</li>
    <li> This is the greatest straitening iron EVER! I totally paid a lot more the first time I purchased this product,,,it was at the mall in one of the vendor kiosks, so you can imagine how expensive it was. Even after overpaying I still got my moneys worth. I had it for at least 5 years and I broke the handle, I freaked out because I could not read the product name so I googled the serial number and thank goodness I was able to locate it on Amazon. I strongly recommend this product if you live in humid areas, this iron leaves your hair sleek and very straight without damaging the ends. LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> What a deal! Really does dry and straighten my thick, curly hair at the same time. If there are any left, buy it now!</li>
    <li> I bought my Jose Eber Black wet or dry flat iron two years ago; I&#x27;m hair stylist and I have used many different ones; this flat iron has a really good quality, it makes hair look smoother ; shiny and healthier, every time I use it in a Custumer they ask what brand of iron I&#x27;m using. I recommend to anyone .</li>
    <li> very good muy buen producto de muy buena calidad. recomiendo este producto al 100%. muy buen juego se lo recomiendo</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m happy that the iron really easy to use... but the item looks like a second hand item. The plates are not aligned and there were scratches as well.</li>
    <li> Love the straightener! works quick and leaves my hair straight and looking great all day! Even my sister was apprehensive about it, but she loved it too!</li>
    <li> I bought only one at first , but when my friends saw it and used it they made me order two more of it ..it&#x27;s great with nice price</li>
    <li> Good. That&#x27;s all I can say.</li>
    <li> Really easy to use, good product</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this flat iron. I do not travel with out it. It straightens, curls and gives you the flexibility of any look you want. As a women with thicker textured hair i was afraid of buying this product for the cost. I was so pleased i bought one for my mother. I&#x27;m contemplating buying my sisters one for Christmas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, even if your hair is slightly wet (i usually dont fully dry my hair with the blow dyer because my hair is relaxed and highlighted) it comes out with so much volume and its healthy with no breakage.</li>
    <li> Iv&#x27;e purchased my share of flat irons, this one by far is the wost one I have ever seen! I purchased this 7 months ago and use it consistantly, it has dried and damaged my hair that it is falling off. I am missing significant patches.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is CRAP.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buyer beware.</li>
    <li> I had spotted one of these at a local mall kiosk. It worked wonderfully on my naturally curly hair, but it was just too pricey for my blood. So, I found one of these here &amp; decided to try it. Right when I took it out of the box, one of the \\&quot;stickers\\&quot; which was poorly glued to hide the screw at the joint peeled off. On closer inspection, I saw how poorly it was constructed &amp; began to wonder if it was the real thing. I then tried to plug it into the socket, &amp; I COULD NOT DO IT. I tried multiple sockets in my home and none would work. One of the prongs that made up the plug looked too large and wouldn&#x27;t fit any of the sockets in my home. I&#x27;ve never had this problem with any other appliance I&#x27;ve bought - I live in a new house, so I highly doubt it was an issue with my outlets. Needless to say, I couldn&#x27;t even plug it in, so I can&#x27;t say how it actually worked, but it wouldn&#x27;t surprise me if these were cheap knock offs. I should&#x27;ve paid more attention to the reviews warning of such. What an absolute waste of money. Buyer beware.</li>
    <li> Wanted the same results as in the mall, from GL direct I received the iron and it straighten my daughters hair it looked dry and did not keep the curl.</li>
    <li> I like the product.  It works as well as my CHI.  There is a buzzing sound once in awhile.  Great purchase.</li>
    <li> I bought this  to see if it would work on damp, potentially frizzy and wavy hair.  It straightens like crazy, leaving hair soft and with a shine.  It has four  heat settings.  I found that the third highest setting to  work just fine.  Only one pass is needed over each section of hair.  No burnt hair yet!</li>
    <li> I use this product daily to straighten my hair. When I received it in March 2013, it worked great.  I like the size of the  product and the weight of it is great considering I have RA and have to be cautious of what I try to work with each day.&lt;br /&gt;Over time, though, it started to malfunction by shutting off and then coming back on, then changing temperatures.  So this morning I decided I better contact Amazon. When I did I was informed the warranty expired April 9th. That was one short warranty. Lesson learned, if I order an item like this again from Amazon, I better read the fine print. I can pay to ship it back for a partial refund. If I want a new one I am responsible for the shipping and the total purchase. I am not happy about this. I&#x27;m in the process now of contacting TOL, Inc. customer service for Jose&#x27; Weber. If I&#x27;m reading it correctly I still need to send $24.95 but should get a replacement straightener.&lt;br /&gt;As far as the product goes, when I first received it, I loved it.</li>
    <li> got it in april and its only June and its already broke, I didnt drop it, get it wet or even let it over heat, it just turns on then right off, doesn&#x27;t even get hot anymore. I used It maybe a dozen times just cause I don&#x27;t like straightening my hair every single day and didn&#x27;t last that long !! no buneo</li>
    <li> Fantastic flat iron. Great quality.</li>
    <li> When I had some concerns about this product I contacted the customer service and I got fast response to satisfy me!</li>
    <li> it burned for no reason :( very low quality</li>
    <li> great product for me , easy and fast</li>
    <li> I paid the big bucks at the mall kiosk for this flat iron. I really really love it at first! My hair looked AMAZING! But after a couple months use, it started to get too hot, even on the lowest setting, and it FRIED my hair. So I took it back to the mall. The person at the kiosk did NOT want to warrantee it, but after a heated discussion she finally did, (for $30) and I took my exchange iron home. This one did the SAME THING! So I went back and did the same thing AGAIN, but this time I got a slightly different iron. I am now having the SAME ISSUE with the other model, too!! I have very healthy hair, (in fact, I have been asked to be a hair model) and have never had problems with burning or breakage. I am SO disgusted with this stupid OVERPRICED brand. Save your money. They aren&#x27;t worth paying the big bucks for a few months use, and the \\&quot;warranty\\&quot; is bulls***, too. They make you pay $25 to $30 for \\&quot;shipping and handling\\&quot; but even then, they give you s*** about that, too. Buy a cheap iron that you can return for your money back if it doesn&#x27;t perform. This one is junk.</li>
    <li> My hair is naturally wavy, and the bed head look isn&#x27;t a good look! I have been using this faithfully for the past 1 year and it has not given me any issues at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have never tried it with wet hair, it just scares me, so I just use it on my dry hair. The hair stays tame and straight for the whole day, unlike some other cheap straighteners.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I want to keep my natural wavy locks for the day, I will just briefly straighten my fringe on the lowest temperature. A one minute job and I am out of the door!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t use irons that often but when I use this one, it seems to leave my hair kind of shiny and sleek feeling.</li>
    <li> although hair must be mostly dry this does work great but do not think you can use it on wet hair because you wont get it dry enough to work</li>
    <li> Was not an actual new product, nor was it authentic in any way.  Did not have ceramic plates, had metal ones.  Repackaged knockoff.</li>
    <li> I bought it for my daughter. She has long thick hair and its perfect for her she loves it. I recieved it on a timely matter.</li>
</ol>
