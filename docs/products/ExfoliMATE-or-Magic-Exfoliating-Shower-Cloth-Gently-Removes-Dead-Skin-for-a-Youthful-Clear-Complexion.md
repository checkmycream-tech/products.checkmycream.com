<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I honestly thought it was just going to be for my face but no its for your whole body its work very well i loved it !!!</li>
    <li> I have received this product without charge/discounted price to give my honest opinion on it these that are expressed are my own. Pretty interesting product I must say didn&#x27;t know something like this existed! My husband is the one who uses it and so far likes it not sure if working as we just started with it either way good way to get dead skin off!</li>
    <li> Got this for free in exchange of a review. I got to say that this is really cool and it works great!!</li>
    <li> I really like the fact that this is a cloth in lieu of a sponge !  Great concept !  This cloth is easy to use. It is gentle and effective. It helps polish the skin. Rinse out before first use.  I use in hard to reach areas like the back between shoulder blades.  I take each end and go back and forth across the shoulders and back of legs etc.  There is a clearing lotion that goes with this use it to help keep your skin clear.  After using the cloth rinse it out.  I like the idea that after using I can hang in the shower.  It dries fast and does not get that funky order like a sponge does.  I got this fabulous exfoliating cloth in exchange for an unbiased beauty product review.  It is something that I will definitely use often !</li>
    <li> When I received the exfoliating cloth it was way bigger than I had expected. I wasn&#x27;t sure why it was so large and thought it would be awkward to use. When I took a shower after I put body wash on it and lathered it up, I quickly figured out that it is long in shape so you can use it across your back and rest of your body easily. It&#x27;s texture was nice, it was not too rough on my skin, but perfect texture to exfoliate my skin. I actually told my boyfriend after I was out of the shower &amp;#34;I feel so clean, that thing is awesome!&amp;#34; It left my skin feeling soft and refreshed. I would absolutely buy this product. I was more than impressed with its functionality, this is a million times better than a &amp;#34;body loofah&amp;#34; and I would not even put that in the same category as this product. This is in a category all it&#x27;s own. I&#x27;m impressed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this product for free in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.</li>
    <li> I really didn&#x27;t know what what to think of this cloth at first but I was able to get this product at no charge in exchange for an unbiased, honest review so why not change up my normal shower routine for a bit?&lt;br /&gt;Holy exfoliation nation! I couldn&#x27;t tell before actually using how well it could exfoliate. Far better than any loofah I&#x27;ve used in the past and it was able to reach every inch of my body with ease. The lather was good and rich. I even got curious and tried on my face. Everything is so smooth and feels so clean. Grateful for the opportunity to try this product and definitely reaping the benefits</li>
    <li> I think it&#x27;s handy - basically a non-scrunched up luffa.  Makes getting soap in/gauging and rinsing much more feasible.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve actually taken to using it in the shower fairly regularly.  Green wouldn&#x27;t have been my first choice, but it&#x27;s the company&#x27;s name so I can&#x27;t blame them for sticking with the theme! I didn&#x27;t order nor try their line of products that this can be used with as I don&#x27;t really suffer from the underlying issue.&lt;br /&gt;Bottomline, nice scrub cloth. It&#x27;s larger than you&#x27;d expect, but you&#x27;ll probably wad it up or fold it when you use it so it&#x27;s just right.&lt;br /&gt;(Note: I got this product free, no strings attached and offered to leave a review)</li>
    <li> Product as described and does a good job of scrubbing hard to reach areas like the small of your back. Gentle yet effective at helping scrub skin trouble areas.</li>
    <li> Like a long loofah! Feels great on my back, exfoliates well</li>
    <li> I have a couple other washcloths and shower poufs. I got this for free and it is way better, especially for cleaning my upper back. It isn&#x27;t too rough like of the other exfoliating products, but helps get the oils off.</li>
    <li> The customer service is top notch, which is the same as the cloth. It works great!</li>
    <li> This exfoliating cloth really is great for all of your body.I have big issue with  acne and this has help tons.</li>
    <li> very nice and scrubs the dead skin away very well!</li>
    <li> It is a good sized cloth. It does what it is designed to do. May want to purchase a couple.</li>
    <li> Loved this when I took a shower. Helped me clean my back easily</li>
    <li> This cloth is HUGE and we love it! It&#x27;s large enough to cover almost all of my husband&#x27;s back and the cloth is just rough enough to really make a difference! It dries quickly and lathers well with our body wash. The fluorescent green color is fun and makes it very easy to find in the morning! We did receive a discount on this product but price doesn&#x27;t change how well it works, nor does it effect my review!</li>
    <li> This cloth is easy to use and easy to clean. I thought the texture was great and it did get rid of acne that I had on my back, I tried this product for free but after seeing results I will continue to use this product and recommend to family and friends that have this problem.</li>
    <li> I was super hesitant to try this, because I had never even heard of it before. However, the description says that it cleans pores and follicles to banish blemishes and reveal a fresh glow. That alone made me say absolutely yes, I will try it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the second part of the description it says that it reaches tough to treat spots like your back your butt and your shoulders, I have no idea where that made me giggle, it&#x27;s kind of juvenile. But I still laughed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do know that exfoliating is a very important part of taking care of your skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Getting all of the dead skin off is vital to a woman or man&#x27;s healthy glow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Looking at the screen cause I had no idea that it would make my skin feel as fresh as it does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I exfoliated when I was in the shower with my handy green cloth. As soon as I got out, I used a toner, and then I used my moisturizer. My skin looked like it did when I was in my teens! I definitely was not expecting that outcome, but I am beyond happy that I was glowing like I did!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And after saying all of this, I can see how this would be amazing for somebody&#x27;s back, or other parts of their body that I don&#x27;t want to get into. You can smash this up like it&#x27;s a loofah, you can stretch it out like it&#x27;s a towel, you can fold it gently in your hands and wash your body. The different ways to use this is kind of amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; And when you&#x27;re done using it all you have to do is hang it to dry!&lt;br /&gt;I received this product at a discounted rate for an honest review.</li>
    <li> Having Adult acne is hard.  And it normally shows on the back.  This has been great and allows my back to feel smooth.</li>
    <li> This is one of the best things I have ever bought! It is so nice to be able to reach around to wash and exfoliate my back!</li>
    <li> This is my go to scrubber from now till forever. At first I thought it felt too soft to even expoliate, but once I used it in the shower wow was I wrong. Felt so clean afterwards, even washed my face with it gently. I love it and you will most likely as well.</li>
    <li> This works great! I was actually looking for a back loofah with a handle, but decided to give this a try. I like that I can use it to scrub my back, then scrunch it up like a mesh body puff to scrub everywhere else. It would be nice if it was 4-6&amp;#34; longer, though. I am a plus-sized woman, and it is a little awkward to use diagonally across my back.</li>
    <li> I received my body acne Exfoliating Cloth on April 15th 2015. I did use it that night. I wasn&#x27;t able to receive the scrub that comes with the cloth at the same time but did use another brand.  The cloth was a amazing even without is product scrub that comes with it. Called Butt Acne.  I am hoping to get the scrub as the cloth is very innovative and that your can use it to scrub with ease your whole back side.</li>
    <li> This exfoliating cloth is basically a loofah stretched out so you can scrub your back. It works great for its designed purpose and is not too soft or rough. The color is great, but some options might be nice as well. High quality and will not just fall apart or rip.</li>
    <li> I got this product with a promotional code and love it! You can feel that your skin is exfoliated after each use. It&#x27;s long enough to use with ease. Recommended for both genders!</li>
    <li> This acne cloth is HUGE. It makes it too big for it to be convenient for me to use and cutting it looks like it would cause it to ravel. It is a very open weave, and abrasive. I&#x27;m not sure I would be using more than once a week, but I am still giving it a 4 star review because this is all personal preference and has nothing to do with the cloth itself.</li>
    <li> I bought this for myself and lost it by the next day... my husband was sure it was for him! He couldn&#x27;t believe that it even work for someone his size (he&#x27;s 6&#x27;6&amp;#34;). It is great for scrubbing the your back and leaves your skin feeling smooth. I have also notice that my legs have seemed less dry since I started using this cloth!</li>
    <li> Finally had a sec to use this between the kids keeping me busy, and it&#x27;s awesome, feels relaxing( well for me) hits the spot. Makes u feel extra clean :) btw got this for a review!</li>
    <li> Full disclosure: I got this product for free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve use it for 3 weeks, it works as describe and clean the body well, it is easy to wash and dry quickly without leaving soap water in which is a huge pro in my opinion. The cloth should last much longer than standard bath sponge, those fall apart quickly! A little bit pricy, if I have to pay retail. But overall a good product if you don&#x27;t mind paying extra.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not intended for baby/child&#x27;s skin as it is a little rough.</li>
    <li> I didnt realize something so simple could work so good. It doesn&#x27;t take my to get it soapy and it&#x27;s easy to use. And I like the fact that it air dries so quick. I don&#x27;t have body acne but I use this for my back and I&#x27;m loving it!</li>
    <li> Great cloth that my wife loved!  She said it worked and felt great!</li>
    <li> I got this to try out and review and although it seems to clean ok I don&#x27;t see much of a difference in my skin! I have rough spots on the backs of my arms and was hoping to see a difference in the roughness! I feel like I get a good clean w this product but as far as making my skin cleaner n smoother I have to say I&#x27;m not very impressed!</li>
    <li> The cloth felt good on the body and is a good size.  But it got moldy in 4 days.</li>
    <li> really rough.not comfortable at all.</li>
    <li> Who would think that this cloth would be so AWESOME! I keep it hanging on the rail in the shower and use if for my face. You could use it anywhere and is a great length if you need to get those hard to reach places ;). As I said, I use it on my face and am so pleased. Great Product!</li>
    <li> This thing gave me a new level of clean. I&#x27;m at a point where I cannot shower without it, and if I go to the gym or out of town I will take it with me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, it dries very quickly, so it never becomes mildewy like a washcloth can. I believe it is synthetic material, but it is so finely woven, that it&#x27;s almost as if it grabs the dead skin off, but without irritating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know who invented this, but it&#x27;s pure genius. Keep up the good work.</li>
    <li> This is NOT what i expected. i didn&#x27;t expect it to be super long like it is. I tried it a few times and I just don&#x27;t like it. its very scratchy and rough not a comfortable or frequently use type product. super thin, long, rough and just not a good buy for me.</li>
    <li> I had one like this before and I love it!!! It exfoliates so well and is gentle at the same time. It makes it easy to scrub your back and basically any area of your body. Thanks!!</li>
    <li> This Cloth Does the Job and Deserves a strong solid 5 star.&lt;br /&gt;I got this as a gift and ive been using it since, this feels great its good quality and does a good job on removing old skin etc.&lt;br /&gt;it gives that extra fresh feeling after using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;its long and has several different advantages, i love that i can use it for all different part of the body.</li>
    <li> Works well? I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s working as intended but I keep using it.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have acne, but I use these cloths for general exfoliation. They work well at removing dirt, dead skin, etc. My only concern is that I wish they were a little thicker. They are however a good size for getting to hard to reach places like the middle of your back.</li>
    <li> Essential item in my bath</li>
    <li> If you have a hard time to reach your back with normal shower sponge, you must use it. This towel is long enough to reach your back and clean your body better than used.</li>
    <li> Durable exfoliating cloth works amazing to get dead skin off</li>
    <li> My son uses this and it seems to work well.</li>
    <li> Very plastic feel, as that&#x27;s all it is.</li>
    <li> I have a special wash that I use but it&#x27;s so hard to really scrub certain areas - especially the center of my back. I received this item in exchange for my honest review and I must admit that I wasn&#x27;t expecting much. I thought it would either be like sandpaper and destroy my skin, it would break/tear easily or it wouldn&#x27;t really do what I needed it to do but I was surprised. It is about 3 feet long and around a foot wide so it covers a nice area. It is an effective exfoliation tool but it isn&#x27;t so rough that it is flat out abrasive. I applied a bit of my wash and used it to scrub my back. It lathered well - better than it usually does to be honest. When I was done, I simply rinsed it off and hung it to dry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was pleasantly surprised by this product and would recommend to anyone in need of an easy to use exfoliation tool!</li>
    <li> This towel leaves me feeling smooth. I got to try this on a free review</li>
    <li> Works well. Material is thinner than I expected.</li>
    <li> Works well, easy to clean and dry. Nice to have something to reach all the little places on my back that I want exfoliated.</li>
    <li> Love this for helping clean my back</li>
    <li> Great product! Proper roughness !</li>
    <li> A great product.&lt;br /&gt; Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for a few weeks now and it works very well. Although I still get some acne on my back I believe it does work so long as I do it every day or every other day. Its very durable and hasn&#x27;t fallen apart despite my vigorous scrubbing. I use this cloth with Neutrogena Body Clear Body Wash.</li>
    <li> I like that I am able to get my back scrubbed well and that it dries easily and stays nice.</li>
    <li> Just received today on time. This cloth is really nice for exfoliating your skin. Its a little clumsy to use. I found rolling it up works better. One caution if you have very sensitive skin this might be rough on your skin. It does a good job and rinses well.</li>
