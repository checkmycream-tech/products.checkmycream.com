<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> shampoo does not foam and spray just saved my hair, I love it. been using for 2 years, and the hair grows healthy !!!</li>
    <li> At first I was concerned about the fragrance but after shampooing and sitting under the dryer, my hair smells beautiful! Had nice body and shine!  Will but again!</li>
    <li> The product smells wonderful and I really really want to use this, but  I am trying to figure out how to get the silicone/waxy substance to wash out of my hair. I have very long thick blonde dry hair.  The all in one shampoo and balm makes my hair greasy and does not leave a &#x27;&#x27;clean&#x27;&#x27; feeling.  I do realize this tends to happen with sulfate free formulas.  I know they are better for your hair and that is why I try to use them.  The This is the only thing I am unsure about with the product, the silicone build up.. The spray is wonderful though!  I do not know how I got through without this spray before.  It is better than &#x27;Its a 10&#x27; product in my opinion. I guess my advice to a buyer would be, don&#x27;t leave on the 1 to 2 minutes the directions call for...</li>
    <li> I have very curly hair that tends to be dry.  This is the best cleansing cream I have ever used.  It doesn&#x27;t foam, so don&#x27;t expect that, but it cleans well and keeps your hair soft and moisturized.  The oil spray helps to tame it down even more.  Love these products and highly recommend them for anyone with dry curly hair.</li>
    <li> This product is wonderful. My hair is somewhat curly, and its very hard to comb after I wash it. This product lets me comb my wet hair easy and it smells wonderful. Will be buying this product again.</li>
    <li> Good deal for both products; my hair smells good ala day long; can get enough of it</li>
    <li> I used to buy this through my hair dresser at the salon.  It is such a better price here.  I love the way it makes my hair feel!</li>
    <li> I recommend this product, it&#x27;s ver good.</li>
    <li> This product surprised me. It made my hair so incredibly rich, shiny and soft. It gently cleaned, detangled and conditioned all in one with just the balm shampoo. Then the leave-in sealed in themoisture and I loved the scent. Not over powering, just really good.</li>
    <li> I have curly, frizzy hair &amp; am always looking for a product to make my life easier. My Sister gave me these products as a gift. I Love them. The combination makes my hair easier to comb tangles after shampooing, easier &amp; faster to blow-dry &amp; flat iron. Smooth &amp; shiny when finished. Have order more for myself.</li>
    <li> Great product for  my thick, wavy hair! I love it!</li>
    <li> Awesome product I buy it for my girlfriend all the time and she loves it</li>
    <li> EXCELLENT.. My daughter is a hair stylist/ color specialist.  She received a free spray bottle of the hair treatment in mail. Used on her clients, and myself. Everyone loved it, so I bought this set.  Its the first and ONLY &amp;#34;all in one, shampoo /conditioner&amp;#34; product that actually does feel as though i&#x27;ve used a separate conditioner. It does not foam all up like a shampoo (read instructions), you leave on for a minute or two....then THOROUGHLY rinse....The smell alone is amazing, absolutely love this product.</li>
    <li> I heard my hairdresser talking about this product, so I decided to give it a try.  I have straight, long, thick blonde hair that has a tendency to frizz up since I live in a very humid place.  For the price, I was pleasantly surprised at how large the bottles were,  The scent reminds me of the smell from a perm, but is tolerable.  Immediately after the first wash, I could notice a difference in my hair while I was blow drying it.  It was super soft and silky, and not as frizzy as it normally is.  However, we have a soft water filtration system in our house, which already makes my hair slightly oily.  I noticed that this product increased the oiliness so my hair didn&#x27;t have as much volume as it normally does.  Using it only as a conditioner on the ends of my hair along with the treatment spray afterwards seems to still provide the softness and prevent the excessive oil.  I will definitely buy this again, and continue to experiment with ways of using it to get the right oiliness/frizz-free/softness combination.</li>
    <li> I found this product amazing! The results are everything they promise</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo. It is great. Reminds me of Wen. Smells good. Love that I use 1 product and I can brush threw my hair. Originally got it from my salan. Great buy Amazon!</li>
    <li> My hairdresser turned me on to these products by just using them on my hair.  I first fell in love with the wonderful clean smell that lasted til my next shampoo and the way it made my hair feel.  My boyfriend also loves the smell of this product. Glad I can purchase this product online now at a good price since my hairdresser can&#x27;t seem to order it fast enough.  Product arrived quickly and was exactly was I expecting! Will order again.</li>
    <li> Using this since 2 years but discontinued...will buy some more :(</li>
    <li> Shampoo is very good. I have weak, thinning hair and it doesn&#x27;t weight my hair limp. Cleans very well. I can&#x27;t say anything about the balm. It is neither bad nor good. Maybe someone with thicker hair would see the benefits of the balm.</li>
    <li> Keeps down the fizz in the dog days of summer. Great Product.</li>
    <li> I love this product - the leave-in has left my hair super super soft and smelling amazing. I&#x27;ve seen a great improvement in my hair after using Uniq1 now for at least 30 days. I also purchased the shampoo/conditioner and like it but I began by using it every day for a week. I found I definitely get better results when I use it 1x or 2x a week instead. All in all I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> Great shampoo and my hair is so soft. I love that it&#x27;s all in one. I don&#x27;t use the treatment spray much because my hair isn&#x27;t always in need of it but the little I&#x27;ve used does my the hair soft and actually added a lot of body.</li>
    <li> I love the conditioning spray. I&#x27;m not sure the all in one shampoo works any better than other similar products. That would be fine but I don&#x27;t care for the scent. It is almost a sage/musk kind of scent. I would not have purchased it had I known this.</li>
    <li> Only thing used on my hair.  Love this product.</li>
    <li> everything went as expected, great seller</li>
    <li> be aware there is no leather not requimended for oily hair  and after using this product going back to regular  shampoo my hair was very dry and unmanagable</li>
    <li> excellent product, fast shipping very professional</li>
    <li> This is a great product. Hair feels silky and last. I love this product and would recommend. It&#x27;s easy to use all in one.</li>
    <li> The hair products are amazing! They smell so good that when I bring them to the salon everybody comments on the beautiful smell.  The products make my hair feel and look amazing! Thank You.</li>
    <li> Fast delivery.  We love this product!</li>
    <li> I bought this thinking it would work well, but its very thick (hence the word &amp;#34;balm&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;It does not lather well at all and its a heavy product for my hair.&lt;br /&gt;I will say it does smell nice though, Just not for me</li>
    <li> i love this product i bought the balm shampoo to see how wondenful is i tell you later this is my 3rd time i bought the hair treatment my hair thanks it</li>
    <li> I realy like this product....</li>
    <li> the shampoo / conditioner 2-in-1 is a little thick, so rinse really well. other than that, i love the product. i&#x27;ve tried many spray in&#x27;s, and this one is by far the best. I have used this for years.</li>
    <li> great product exactly as ordered thank you</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing. Makes my hair feel and smell great. My hair doesn&#x27;t need to be washed as much because it&#x27;s getting less greasy from the shampoo.</li>
    <li> Thank you so much for the wonderful product!</li>
    <li> Love it. Makes hair feel thicker</li>
    <li> Shampoo a little too thick, but good.  The spray Balm reminds me of Biosilk in a spray form.  Smell and all.  I usually wash my hair everyday, but I can use a light spray ( not at roots ) and a quick blow dry, can get away without one hour hairwash/dry procedure.  Be careful though, but it does have an oily feel (silicone).  Don&#x27;t do the  roots or your bangs.</li>
    <li> Excellent.! My girlfriend loved it.!</li>
    <li> The shampoo is not good. But de cream is fantastic!</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t ever buy this stuff, I am blond and I started using it so my hair color would not stop out, this shampoo is horrible it has a weird build up, and when my stylist went to bleach out my hair it would not work we had to bleach my hair 3 time and it still is not normal!!!! I would never recommend this to anyone ever.</li>
    <li> Item delivered on time, was as described.</li>
    <li> I have a bit frizzy hair and got this product recommended by my hair stylist. I was amazed of how nice my hair came out so I bought it at the salon. I ran out of it and ordered through amazon. This is a great value because for about the same price of the hair treatment at the salon, I got the both shampoo n treatment here at amazon. I will definitely order again from tis seller!</li>
    <li> First off, this product smells fantastic, but most importantly it cleaned my hair (like a co-wash) without stripping the moisture.  I use the leave-in a lot.  As a bi-racial woman (African-Amer and Latino) my hair is greatly affected by the weather.  I look forward to using this product in the summer when naturals and twist-outs need extra care.</li>
    <li> Will continue to reorder!!</li>
    <li> These products are great for my hair which is very fine.</li>
    <li> I love these products! I use them both daily and my hair has never worked better. I have fine, long hair that is thicker than it looks. This protects my hair from using my hair dryer and straightening iron regularly. It is so much cheaper to get this through Amazon rather than Ulta :)</li>
    <li> I love this product, My hair as never looked better, I didn&#x27;t tell my friends that I was using it , but they noticed a difference , then I tell them all about Uniq One All in One Shampoo and Balm.</li>
    <li> I love the hair treatment but don&#x27;t really care much for the shampoo &amp; balm. But it smells really good.</li>
    <li> Great product.  Love the fragrance and the result to my hair, and the fact that I do not need to separate products, Shampoo and Conditioner.</li>
    <li> Great product and quick shipment!</li>
    <li> Love it! Smells amazing &amp; makes your hair so soft!</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. I am now a regular user on my straight ghair as well as my 2 daughters very curly hair. I love that I can use it in their hair and do not have to use any conditioner. All in one conditioning shampoo is great and makes washing their hair in one step a breeze. The All in one spray is a miracle for ultra curly hair that tends to tangle. I use to have to brush my aughters tangles out in the bath with conditioner in her hair but now I just spray a little All in one and the brush goes right through. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing. My hair is soft and healthy. I love it.</li>
    <li> I use wen and this is just as good</li>
    <li> This shampoo it&#x27;s amazing.  Leaves my hair soft and smells really good.</li>
    <li> Great product - hard to find!</li>
