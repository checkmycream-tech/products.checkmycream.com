      <li>I love it and hope this perfume will stay on the market for years to come.</li>
      <li>i received this product two  weeks after placing the order, and i must say, i&#x27;m quite pleased with it.</li>
      <li>I thought because this was the parfume, it would be better the the toilette, but it was not.</li>
      <li>and I am so glad I got it.  </li>
      <li>i&#x27;d thought versace might have a better formula--</li>
      <li>my wife loves it, i will buy more soon</li>
      <li>Vercase crystal noir has given me many compliments.</li>
      <li>This is one of my favorite fragrances.</li>
      <li>The Bestttt love the smell</li>
      <li>This is a decadent &amp; lovely fragrance.  </li>
      <li>, she uses it every day all most.</li>
      <li>Love the scent.  </li>
      <li>I was hesitant to buy a perfume online but was more than satisfied.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Amazon is great because for its products offers free shipping!</li>
      <li>It came earlier, everything was original and the quality was excellent!</li>
      <li>This perfume gets a lot of compliments, but more importantly, I really enjoy the fragrance.</li>
      <li>I love parfume a that more crisp and clean like a cologne, this one fits the bill!</li>
      <li>: there&#x27;s a good tip to know if the perfume you bought is brand new.</li>
      <li>Not too strong, not too sweet, just yummy.</li>
      <li>not the original.</li>
      <li>As always, just right for my gal!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not quite masculine, but it&#x27;s certainly an exotic and strong feminine quality that this perfume&#x27;s got.</li>
      <li>Got this at Amazon for a great deal less money than where I tried it out at a specialty shop.</li>
      <li>Applied over lotion and/or damp skin, it hangs around quite awhile and adds a sexy-but-(hopefully)-subtle presence that&#x27;s pretty unique.</li>
      <li>but if you like to smell fabulous I highly recommend!</li>
      <li>This is by far my favorite perfume.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s hard to rate a perfume since the perfect perfume for a person needs to mix with your body&#x27;s natural aroma.</li>
      <li>Funnily enough, I can never seem to smell this fragrance on me but everyone else does, so hey I&#x27;m not complaining :)</li>
      <li>HOPE it&#x27;s not a fake...</li>
      <li>if perfume sprayed on the first press, you were deceived.</li>
      <li>I bought the Eau de Parfum because that is supposed to have a higher real scent/oils/perfume content than Eau de Toilette...</li>
      <li>I  like strong perfumes that last on me.  </li>
      <li>Arrived very securely packaged and as expected.  </li>
      <li>This one really suits me.</li>
      <li>and they really are faster for lower prices.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend!</li>
      <li>and I absolutely had to get it.  </li>
      <li>#34;someone smells really good&amp;#34; &amp;</li>
      <li>I first tried this in Vegas at one of those fancy restaurant restrooms where they have every personal product under the sun for your use...</li>
      <li>I think it&#x27;s a little strong for some people, and might be off-putting.</li>
      <li>I subsequently bought the body lotion to layer it with the spray - seems to give it a little more lasting power.</li>
      <li>not floral, just plain CLEAN</li>
      <li>the first two sprinkles should be empty.</li>
      <li>one is one of my favorite for winter as well as Gucci guilty; Gucci guilty intense, euphoria original, obsession original</li>
      <li>I purchased this big bottle as a second one as my first bottle was purchased as a small bottle in a dept store so I could smell it first!</li>
      <li>As the product description says: &amp;#34;please consider that there are several factors which can affect the natural smell of your skin and, in turn, the way a scent smells on you.</li>
      <li>so heavy and same as many other scents.</li>
      <li>The scent is rich and complex, and it lasts for quite a long time.</li>

<li> and I absolutely had to get it.  </li>
<li> #34;someone smells really good&amp;#34; &amp;</li>
<li> I first tried this in Vegas at one of those fancy restaurant restrooms where they have every personal product under the sun for your use...</li>
<li> I think it&#x27;s a little strong for some people, and might be off-putting.</li>
<li> I subsequently bought the body lotion to layer it with the spray - seems to give it a little more lasting power.</li>

<li> I purchased this big bottle as a second one as my first bottle was purchased as a small bottle in a dept store so I could smell it first!</li>
<li> As the product description says: &amp;#34;please consider that there are several factors which can affect the natural smell of your skin and, in turn, the way a scent smells on you.</li>
<li> so heavy and same as many other scents.</li>
<li> The scent is rich and complex, and it lasts for quite a long time.</li>
<li> smells the same, but don&#x27;t last as long.</li>
<li> Similarly, factor such as dry or oily skin can even affect the amount of time a fragrance will last after being applied.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;One caveat as others have written, for some reason it does not last long...</li>
<li> No smell to it and didn&#x27;t last a long time.</li>
<li> Again, sold by Amazon, I already knew the product very well, so I would have known right away if there was something wrong with it.&lt;br /&gt;Great smell, spicy and romantic, lasts long if you buy the \\&quot;eau de parfum\\&quot; and not \\&quot;eau de toilette\\&quot; (the price difference is not worth not spending the extra money).&lt;br</li>
<li> This is not available in major departments stores as a perfume only as an ODT.</li>
<li> But, as I said before, there are other delivery companies to partner with</li>
<li> I can&#x27;t describe it any other way</li>
<li> but it seems as if this was watered down...</li>
<li> I received a 3oz bottle &amp; paid considerably less than I would have at a department store.</li>
<li> it&#x27;s heavy and spicy on my skin, with a little bit of silky vanilla sweetness.</li>
<li> It starts spicy and slowly tones down to a coconut fragrance with deeper richer tones of sandalwood.</li>
<li> ......I am a fanatic when it comes to fragrances</li>
<li> however, disappointed that it does not last long... :(  </li>
<li> It is not your basic boring floral!</li>
<li> i think i received a fake product</li>
<li> It&#x27;s  was a bad experience  .</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> i think i received a fake product but this could be just me who got a sampe that doesnt smell like what i see on a friend who got it from a different place.</li>
    <li> Best prices, where shopping in great.</li>
    <li> ......I am a fanatic when it comes to fragrances and I fell in LOVE with this scent!!!  A friend of mines wore it and I absolutely had to get it.  Although I know it smells different on everyone I still wanted it and I am so glad I got it.  Ever since I put it on everyone around me says &amp;#34;someone smells really good&amp;#34; &amp;#34;great fragrance&amp;#34; &amp;#34;what are you wearing&amp;#34; So I know I scored with this one.  Funnily enough, I can never seem to smell this fragrance on me but everyone else does, so hey I&#x27;m not complaining :)</li>
    <li> Again, sold by Amazon, I already knew the product very well, so I would have known right away if there was something wrong with it.&lt;br /&gt;Great smell, spicy and romantic, lasts long if you buy the \\&quot;eau de parfum\\&quot; and not \\&quot;eau de toilette\\&quot; (the price difference is not worth not spending the extra money).&lt;br /&gt;Testers are always a bit longer lasting! And cheaper...how convenient!... :-p&lt;br /&gt;Amazon is great because for its products offers free shipping! But, as I said before, there are other delivery companies to partner with and they really are faster for lower prices.</li>
    <li> I receive a lot of compliments when I wear this perfume. It stays on all day!</li>
    <li> not the original. The bottle is different from the one I bought from a Versace store when I was in Italy. smells the same, but don&#x27;t last as long.</li>
    <li> Wonderful! I get compliments on how good it smells on me all the time,even from strangers!</li>
    <li> One of my most favorite fragrances! Love, Love, Love this purchase!</li>
    <li> Smells nice, but in an hour the smell is gone!</li>
    <li> Just what my daughter wanted.</li>
    <li> I love Versace Crystal Noir because it gets good smell all the day and I can use it everywhere and everytime. My daughter also likes this.  I think that it is suitable for woman.</li>
    <li> I first tried this in Vegas at one of those fancy restaurant restrooms where they have every personal product under the sun for your use...and I thought hmmm let me try a squirt of that...Holy moly! it is delish! Not too strong, not too sweet, just yummy. As the product description says: &amp;#34;please consider that there are several factors which can affect the natural smell of your skin and, in turn, the way a scent smells on you. For instance, your mood, stress level, age, body chemistry, diet, and current medications may all alter the scents you wear. Similarly, factor such as dry or oily skin can even affect the amount of time a fragrance will last after being applied.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;One caveat as others have written, for some reason it does not last long...&lt;br /&gt;I HOPE it&#x27;s not a fake...I bought the Eau de Parfum because that is supposed to have a higher real scent/oils/perfume content than Eau de Toilette...I subsequently bought the body lotion to layer it with the spray - seems to give it a little more lasting power.</li>

    <li> Great graduation gift for my daughter.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve worn this perfume for a couple of years now, and I have mixed feelings. I quite like it myself - it&#x27;s heavy and spicy on my skin, with a little bit of silky vanilla sweetness. I&#x27;ve had two men ask me not to wear it again, however. I think it&#x27;s a little strong for some people, and might be off-putting. For myself, I love it! Applied over lotion and/or damp skin, it hangs around quite awhile and adds a sexy-but-(hopefully)-subtle presence that&#x27;s pretty unique. It&#x27;s not quite masculine, but it&#x27;s certainly an exotic and strong feminine quality that this perfume&#x27;s got.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s  was a bad experience  .</li>
    <li> As always, just right for my gal!</li>
    <li> Arrived very securely packaged and as expected.  No problems, great service.  Five stars!  Perfect!</li>
    <li> I was hesitant to buy a perfume online but was more than satisfied. It came earlier, everything was original and the quality was excellent! Most important, my wife was happy! :)</li>
    <li> This is one of my favorite fragrances. The value is amazing. This is not available in major departments stores as a perfume only as an ODT. Very good buy.</li>

    <li> The Bestttt love the smell and I brought it for a great price omggg!!! If you don&#x27;t have it go purchase it</li>
    <li> however, disappointed that it does not last long... :(  Perhaps its just me but it seems as if this was watered down...</li>
    <li> Best ever - compliments everywhere I go!</li>
    <li> this perfume smells soooo good. well, if you&#x27;re the type that likes flower or fruit perfumes, then this one isn&#x27;t for you. i received this product two  weeks after placing the order, and i must say, i&#x27;m quite pleased with it. it was well wrapped and in a good condition.&lt;br /&gt;good tip: there&#x27;s a good tip to know if the perfume you bought is brand new. the tip is you have to press on the bottle. the first two sprinkles should be empty. if perfume sprayed on the first press, you were deceived.</li>
    <li> I  like strong perfumes that last on me.  Fills my requirements beautifully.</li>
    <li> This is a decadent &amp; lovely fragrance.  I hv been impressed also with the value of my purchase. I received a 3oz bottle &amp; paid considerably less than I would have at a department store.</li>

    <li> Vercase crystal noir has given me many compliments. This is by far my favorite perfume.</li>
    <li> my own fault- i read reviews for an hour but never smelled it. so heavy and same as many other scents. i&#x27;d thought versace might have a better formula--but i guess not. gave me an instant headache. i gave it away immediately-- to a teen who will wear anything labeled &#x27;cologne.&#x27;.</li>
    <li> my wife loves it, i will buy more soon i cannot keep enough of it , she uses it every day all most.</li>
    <li> m like this item and recommending it to others, has very fresh and nice aroma, very feminine and light, it&#x27;s wonderful</li>
    <li> I love parfume a that more crisp and clean like a cologne, this one fits the bill! It smells like the freshest scent in the world to me! Not citrus&#x27; not floral, just plain CLEAN I can&#x27;t describe it any other way but if you like to smell fabulous I highly recommend! I purchased this big bottle as a second one as my first bottle was purchased as a small bottle in a dept store so I could smell it first! Highly recommend! Worth EVERY \\&quot;scent\\&quot; lol</li>
    <li> Love the scent.  Not too overpowering.  Got this at Amazon for a great deal less money than where I tried it out at a specialty shop.</li>
