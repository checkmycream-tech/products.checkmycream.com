      <li>Love it!!</li>
      <li>I LOVE THIS lipstick.totally intuitive and perfect amount of color.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It does not have good coverage, it looks like you are wearing lip balm, a pricey lip balm.</li>
      <li>It lasts a good while, but I reapply i every couple of hours, but I dont mind because its so moisturizing.</li>
      <li>I love this stuff!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s nice alone.</li>
      <li>It has a nice texture on my lips, but no discernable color.</li>
      <li>Nice gloss but no color.</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t let the blue shade scare you, it swipes on the most beautiful berry colour I&#x27;ve ever seen...works wonderfully on the apples of your cheeks as a coordinating blush as well!</li>
      <li>It works great as a stand-alone color for a more neutral daytime look, or on top of darker/brighter shades for more of an evening and going out look.  </li>
      <li>I wasn&#x27;t thrilled with the shade alone on my lips because I tend to like a more nude lip than a berry one...</li>
      <li>I was excited to try this because the reviews were good, but it doesn&#x27;t look like anything on me.</li>
      <li>Cool product if you look good in berry colors.</li>
      <li>I love how it leaves a bit of a stain on your lips that lasts all day.</li>
      <li>I love Lipstick Queen lipsticks, just the name alone,</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried many of these types of color change lipsticks.</li>
      <li>It also could be a tad more moisturizing.</li>
      <li>It feels more like a lip gloss or chapstick, but it gives you way more color than I&#x27;ve ever gotten from a tinted lip gloss.  </li>
      <li>Donate $25 to charity, it will be a better use of your money.  </li>
      <li>This is perhaps the most flattering lip color I&#x27;ve ever worn.</li>
      <li>This will become a staple in my make-up toolkit and a go-to favorite for sure.</li>
      <li>This is one of the most moisturizing lipsticks I have ever used.  </li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>if they added more beeswax, I think it would have better staying power.</li>
      <li>I hope this stays available long-term!</li>
      <li>one of my all time favorite lipsticks....</li>
      <li>The first time I used it my body temp must have been really high because the color was awesome.  </li>
      <li>Great product love the color change to natural lip color.</li>
      <li>This is the third Lipstick Queen product I&#x27;ve bought, and I&#x27;m very impressed with how smoothly all apply, and how hydrating they all are.  </li>
      <li>My new favorite lipstick!!</li>
      <li>this stuff nicely counteracts the natural drying tendencies of most lip stains), it will add a cooler shade to more red/orange products.  </li>
      <li>What fun--a navy product that would turn the exact shade of mauve perfect for each individual wearer&#x27;s skin tone!  </li>
      <li>The color was more of a gloss than a bold color was</li>
      <li>Ok doesn&#x27;t give off as much color as I would have liked---- the seller shipped quickly</li>
      <li>/&gt;Somehow it gives you just the perfect shade ~ your natural lips only better.</li>
      <li>If the color was more noticeable it would be worth the price.</li>
      <li>it doesn&#x27;t stain, but I do like that you can throw it on like a chapstick w/o looking in a mirror and know that it&#x27;s not going to turn a bizarre clownish color.</li>
      <li>I am kind of upset I paid this much for a product  whose color is so deceiving.</li>
      <li>Smooth.  </li>
      <li>This color is fabulous.  </li>
      <li>Not as much color as the examples I&#x27;ve seen, but it feels nice and adds a touch of color.</li>
      <li>Fantastic lipstick.</li>
      <li>However, because its consistency is so moisturizing and smooth, re-applying is harmless.  </li>
      <li>Feels like a nice high end lip balm to me.</li>
      <li>Worth every penny!</li>
      <li>I received my Lipstick Queen &amp;#34;Hello Sailor&amp;#34; lipstick, I was so excited to try this navy-to-mauve shade</li>
      <li>most of them turn WAY too bright pink and then leave a stain that lasts all day.</li>
      <li>Got one for my 85 year old mother who also loves the color blue and her favorite trick is to whip it out in front of unsuspecting friends and put it on her lips, without a mirror (a trick I have yet to master!!!).  </li>
      <li>Amazing color.better than Dior lipglow and better than givenchy black magic livs lips.</li>
      <li>In terms of moisturizing, it isn&#x27;t as good as many other lipsticks/glosses.</li>
      <li>Not only is this lipstick change color from blue to a lovely berry shade, its incredibly moisturizing.  </li>
      <li>I am fair with blue eyes.  </li>
      <li>, either my coloring (fair complexion, dark hair, light eyes) doesn&#x27;t work with this balm&#x27;s chemistry, or Lipstick Queen has duped me!  </li>
      <li>It really looks wild before you put it on, it is just as bright as the pictures show.</li>
      <li>his new, stylish outfit was invisible.  </li>
      <li>soft like a balm - and boy am I glad I hung onto it because I discovered that it looks AMAZING layered on top of other lipsticks.</li>
      <li>My first Lipstick Queen purchase and how fun!  </li>
      <li>It looks blue, but don&#x27;t let it fool you--the hue is nice.</li>
      <li>When you put it on it is like a clear, then it magically transforms your lips.</li>
      <li>love it brings out natural color</li>
      <li>Particularly, MAC Hue - which runs a little warm - gets reinvented with this popped in the center of the lip, and creates the perfect natural but fabulous lipstick color I&#x27;ve been looking for all my life!</li>
      <li>I so wanted to like this, I had heard good things other than having to reapply often.  </li>
      <li>The product is exactly as described and exactly what I was hoping for!</li>
      <li>I was pretty excited to try it, but honestly, for the price, it&#x27;s just not worth it.</li>
      <li>A crafty tailor didn&#x27;t have the Emperor&#x27;s new clothes made, so he told the Emperor</li>
      <li>Btw I am very fair skinned with dark blonde hair and bluish/grey eyes</li>
      <li>It creates a nice balance between natural and a little bit more pumped up color.  </li>
      <li>The price kept me from purchasing for awhile, and I&#x27;m glad I finally did.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s an interesting lipstick to use and definitely a conversation piece.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t know what to expect with a blue lipstick, but it&#x27;s really more like a balm.  </li>
      <li>It makes my lips a really pretty berry color.</li>
      <li>Unlike most lipsticks, this actually left my lips softer than before!  </li>
      <li>I really like this color!</li>
      <li>Looks blue, goes on the most fabulous shade of berry, not blue berry mind you, but a nice red berry color that compliments all skin tones.  </li>
      <li>This was my first ever Lipstick Queen purchase and now I&#x27;m hooked.  </li>
      <li>I love the color blue.  </li>
      <li>it&#x27;s like lip gloss, really what is this!</li>
      <li>Feels very moisturising too!</li>
      <li>Thie lipstick was more like a blue chapstick.  </li>
      <li>It falls on the Saint side if you&#x27;re familiar with Lipstick Queen&#x27;s sheer and full coverage lipsticks.</li>
      <li>It is very versatile and feels soft on the lips, so for me it makes it worth the price tag.</li>
      <li>but I don&#x27;t think it packs much in the way of color.</li>
      <li>One thing I would add is that it doesnt really whiten my teeth or anything, not in my opinion.</li>
      <li>It makes them look red and fabulous.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried many of these types of color change lipsticks. most of them turn WAY too bright pink and then leave a stain that lasts all day. but this one is the first one that actually turns a color closer to a slightly more muted plummy pink (my lips are very pale, it might not show up on people with very pigmented lips). it doesn&#x27;t stain, but I do like that you can throw it on like a chapstick w/o looking in a mirror and know that it&#x27;s not going to turn a bizarre clownish color. by the time you add the second or third consecutive application, the color will build up and have a *slight* lasting power. (that color will be 100% gone as soon as you eat a meal though.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;however, it has too much slip. I want to feel the protective layer (like burt&#x27;s bees lip balm), and if it feels like it&#x27;s gone midway through a cup of coffee, then that&#x27;s a major fail.  if they added more beeswax, I think it would have better staying power. too bad because this one has the best color! if lipstick queen changes the formula, maybe I&#x27;ll try again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(note: I have a similar product by jane iredale that lasts much longer. it&#x27;s more expensive, but maybe not so much if you don&#x27;t have to reapply as often.)</li>
    <li> You barely notice that there is any color on your lips but I will say that it does leave my lips feeling soft and as someone with sensitive skin it did no cause any irritation. If the color was more noticeable it would be worth the price. I do not think I&#x27;ll buy another tube when my current one is used up</li>
    <li> love it brings out natural color</li>
    <li> Thie lipstick was more like a blue chapstick.  Had hardly any color</li>
    <li> This is one of the most moisturizing lipsticks I have ever used.  Love it.</li>
    <li> It isn&#x27;t blue at all. It looks clear and I am kind of upset I paid this much for a product  whose color is so deceiving.</li>
    <li> Not as much color as the examples I&#x27;ve seen, but it feels nice and adds a touch of color.</li>
    <li> My first Lipstick Queen purchase and how fun!  It&#x27;s an interesting lipstick to use and definitely a conversation piece. Moisturizing and I like the color.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m giving 4 stars instead of 5 because I do wish the color was a bit less translucent. The pinky, purple, mauve shade it gives my lips is ever so slight. I&#x27;ve found that layering helps a bit.&lt;br /&gt;I would repurchase however.</li>
    <li> This is MY lipstick!  I&#x27;m very self conscious about my less-than-perfectly white teeth and this color is perfect for me.  I am fair with blue eyes.  I work in a dry environment, in the hospital.  I do reapply a few times in a 12 hour shift.  Very soothing and moisturizing.</li>
    <li> For $25.00, what I got was simply Lip Gloss, nothing more, very disappointed. Was supposed to have color and plump up lips but  did not deliver there.</li>
    <li> No color at all for the cost, does nothing for moisture, and requires frequent application.</li>
    <li> I was excited to try this because the reviews were good, but it doesn&#x27;t look like anything on me. It has a nice texture on my lips, but no discernable color.</li>
    <li> Would have given this one 5 stars if the color had lasted longer.  However, because its consistency is so moisturizing and smooth, re-applying is harmless.  Agree with other reviewers that it goes on as more of a plum color, however if you layer it with other lipstick or lip stain (hint: this stuff nicely counteracts the natural drying tendencies of most lip stains), it will add a cooler shade to more red/orange products.  This is the third Lipstick Queen product I&#x27;ve bought, and I&#x27;m very impressed with how smoothly all apply, and how hydrating they all are.  I highly recommend this brand.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! Just picked it up today. It really looks wild before you put it on, it is just as bright as the pictures show. Once applied, it looks very natural... it&#x27;s almost like a berry gloss minus the stickiness. Unlike most lipsticks, this actually left my lips softer than before!  I hope this stays available long-term!</li>
    <li> I wasn&#x27;t thrilled with the shade alone on my lips because I tend to like a more nude lip than a berry one...and while I saw it looked like a very pale pink on some wearers, I found my lips have too much pigment to begin with to pull off the same look. I did like the texture though - sheer, soft like a balm - and boy am I glad I hung onto it because I discovered that it looks AMAZING layered on top of other lipsticks. Particularly, MAC Hue - which runs a little warm - gets reinvented with this popped in the center of the lip, and creates the perfect natural but fabulous lipstick color I&#x27;ve been looking for all my life! It even corrects the texture for me. Worth every penny!</li>
    <li> Fantastic lipstick. Don&#x27;t let the blue shade scare you, it swipes on the most beautiful berry colour I&#x27;ve ever seen...works wonderfully on the apples of your cheeks as a coordinating blush as well! Non-greasy, and sheer, Hello Sailor is a winner!</li>
    <li> a sparkly shine that makes your teeth look whiter.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s awesome and makes your lips feel great.  It looks blue, but don&#x27;t let it fool you--the hue is nice.</li>
    <li> I will not buy this product again.&lt;br /&gt;It does not have good coverage, it looks like you are wearing lip balm, a pricey lip balm.</li>
    <li> Do you remember the childhood fable about the Emperor&#x27;s new clothes?  A crafty tailor didn&#x27;t have the Emperor&#x27;s new clothes made, so he told the Emperor his new, stylish outfit was invisible.  All the courtiers were in on it or afraid to seem unworldly so they raved about the new suit of clothes.  They created alot of hype in town and announced there would be a big event to show-off the new duds. The Emperor paraded around town in the buff. At first everyone was horrified the Emperor was strutting around nude, but they were too afraid to admit they couldn&#x27;t see the value in the new, much-hyped suit of clothes.&lt;br /&gt;When I received my Lipstick Queen &amp;#34;Hello Sailor&amp;#34; lipstick, I was so excited to try this navy-to-mauve shade the description promised!  What fun--a navy product that would turn the exact shade of mauve perfect for each individual wearer&#x27;s skin tone!  I applied this creamy, moisturizing lipstick and saw nothing.  I had first lined my lips with a neutral liner, so I decided to try again after I returned home later in the day.  After removing all my makeup that evening, I applied the &amp;#34;Hello Sailor&amp;#34; again on a naked lip.  Creamy.  Smooth.  Invisible.&lt;br /&gt;So, either my coloring (fair complexion, dark hair, light eyes) doesn&#x27;t work with this balm&#x27;s chemistry, or Lipstick Queen has duped me!  I&#x27;m returning this moisturizing but invisible lipstick.&lt;br /&gt;(c) KMS 2015</li>
    <li> I so wanted to like this, I had heard good things other than having to reapply often.  The first time I used it my body temp must have been really high because the color was awesome.  But ever since that first time, the color is barely noticeable.  I wears off within minutes and doesn&#x27;t make my teeth appear whiter as everyone said.  :(</li>
    <li> Thought this thing had a blue color...it&#x27;s like lip gloss, really what is this!</li>
    <li> This product is false advertising - it should state that it does not work on everyone and that if not, they can get their money back.  The product went on clear.  And stayed clear.  I even put it on just one lip and asked a friend if she could tell the difference and she said no.  In terms of moisturizing, it isn&#x27;t as good as many other lipsticks/glosses. In fact, it has the feel of Chapstick.  For $22+, I expected much more than this.  Would never buy from Lipstick Queen again.</li>
    <li> I really like this color! It is a great neutral shade! You can wear it alone or layer it over other lipsticks or stains to change them to a cooler shade! I would give this color 5 stars, but it has to be reapplied a lot if you are out drinking and eating - hence the 4 star rating. It also could be a tad more moisturizing. Still, I recommend it to both the girl who has a lot lip colors, or the one who just wants enhance their natural lips. It is very versatile and feels soft on the lips, so for me it makes it worth the price tag.</li>
    <li> Not only is this lipstick change color from blue to a lovely berry shade, its incredibly moisturizing.  I love how it leaves a bit of a stain on your lips that lasts all day.</li>
    <li> This is a sheer, moisturizing lip tint. It makes my lips a really pretty berry color. It&#x27;s nice alone. I havent tried it over another lipstick. When you put it on it is like a clear, then it magically transforms your lips. It lasts a good while, but I reapply i every couple of hours, but I dont mind because its so moisturizing. You really cant go wrong with this. One thing I would add is that it doesnt really whiten my teeth or anything, not in my opinion. Btw I am very fair skinned with dark blonde hair and bluish/grey eyes</li>
    <li> one of my all time favorite lipsticks....</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t like at all. Threw away. It was just a dyed chap stick.</li>
    <li> This turns a nice, subtle berry Colour on the lips. Feels very moisturising too!</li>
    <li> Cool product if you look good in berry colors.</li>
    <li> Great product love the color change to natural lip color.</li>
    <li> The blue color freaks people out when they see me putting it on!  But the resulting purply-pink is very soft and pretty for everyday.</li>
    <li> Awesome seller! Great product!</li>
    <li> This is perhaps the most flattering lip color I&#x27;ve ever worn. It&#x27;s not a gloss and not a full lipstick. It falls on the Saint side if you&#x27;re familiar with Lipstick Queen&#x27;s sheer and full coverage lipsticks. It doesn&#x27;t go on blue. It turns a very natural and flattering berry color. But it also soothes my impulse to want to wear blue lipstick. All in all, the best lipstick purchase I&#x27;ve ever made.</li>
    <li> I saw this lipstick in a magazine and I was a little skeptical that a blue lipstick would look anything but weird, but I was looking to try something different so I thought why not?&lt;br /&gt;This does not make your lips look blue!  It makes them look red and fabulous.  It feels more like a lip gloss or chapstick, but it gives you way more color than I&#x27;ve ever gotten from a tinted lip gloss.  Sometimes I layer this over a lip stain instead of chapstick if I really want to bring out the red.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m dying to try the other Lipstick Queen colors!</li>
    <li> The color was more of a gloss than a bold color was I was hoping it would be</li>
    <li> My new favorite lipstick!! This is a beautiful pink color that enhances your natural color without looking too pink.</li>
    <li> Excellent  product. Beautiful lip color!</li>
    <li> The blue color is very subtle and the lipstick itself is wonderful for dry lips</li>
    <li> This product does nothing that my Dr. Pepper LipSmacker doesn&#x27;t do. I was pretty excited to try it, but honestly, for the price, it&#x27;s just not worth it.</li>
    <li> This was my first ever Lipstick Queen purchase and now I&#x27;m hooked.  The packaging was new and not damaged.  The product is exactly as described and exactly what I was hoping for!</li>
    <li> Hello Sailor!!! Love it!! Don&#x27;t be afraid of the blue color in the tube.  You put this on and it turns into the perfect color! It&#x27;s moisturizing and looks beautiful!  I keep it with me all the time!  It goes with everything and looks wonderful!</li>
    <li> This is a really really really expensive lip balm. The color is negligible. If it wasn&#x27;t for the glossy shine I wouldn&#x27;t know I was wearing anything. Perhaps if you are pale with pale lips it would do more for you, but I feel like I just spent $24 on the Burt&#x27;s Bees Hibiscus tinted lip balm.</li>
    <li> This gives me just the hint of color that I&#x27;ve always been searching for - but without being too heavy.  I did have a little trial and error in the beginning though - the color seems to grow deeper after you apply - but now I know a little goes a long way.  Very happy with the purchase!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t know what to expect with a blue lipstick, but it&#x27;s really more like a balm.  It leaves the prettiest soft blackberry color on your lips.</li>
    <li> I was intrigued by the blue color, which turns to a lovely soft berry color when applied.  The texture is sheer and soft like a lip balm.  It works great as a stand-alone color for a more neutral daytime look, or on top of darker/brighter shades for more of an evening and going out look.  It creates a nice balance between natural and a little bit more pumped up color.  The price kept me from purchasing for awhile, and I&#x27;m glad I finally did.  This will become a staple in my make-up toolkit and a go-to favorite for sure.</li>
    <li> Ladies, this is a $25 lipgloss, no magic effect, only may be slight shine and darkening of the lip due to dalk gloss pigment. nothing else. wipes off in a hurry too.</li>
    <li> This is really kind of dumb and a waste of $25.  It barely gives a hint of a berry color.  As it dries a little your lips are just stained, so you have to continue to apply it to keep your lips moist.  If this was about $8-10 I would have given a few more stars.  Donate $25 to charity, it will be a better use of your money.  I wish I had.</li>
    <li> Ok doesn&#x27;t give off as much color as I would have liked---- the seller shipped quickly</li>
    <li> Ignore the strange color - it doesn&#x27;t turn your lips blue!&lt;br /&gt;Somehow it gives you just the perfect shade ~ your natural lips only better.</li>
    <li> This works great layered over almost all my lipsticks, and it does make my teeth look whiter.  I was skeptical, but I really could use a second tube to throw in a second handbag.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not impressed.  It is fun to pull out a blue lipstick but I don&#x27;t think it packs much in the way of color. Feels like a nice high end lip balm to me.</li>
    <li> Again this is nothing to write home about.  Would not repurchase.  It did not stain my lips and the color did not last and if this is the color for me I am in trouble.</li>
    <li> I love the color blue.  I love Lipstick Queen lipsticks, just the name alone, my goodness, I AM the Lipstick Queen!  This color is fabulous.  Looks blue, goes on the most fabulous shade of berry, not blue berry mind you, but a nice red berry color that compliments all skin tones.  Got one for my 85 year old mother who also loves the color blue and her favorite trick is to whip it out in front of unsuspecting friends and put it on her lips, without a mirror (a trick I have yet to master!!!).  She loves to see their shocked faces (BLUE LIPSTICK???!!!) turn to almost envy when they realize this is the shade they have been complimenting her about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even if you don&#x27;t like lipstick, get a tube for your Mom or Grandmother.</li>
    <li> I was disappointed. This looks like nothing on my lips. Nice gloss but no color.</li>
    <li> Amazing color.better than Dior lipglow and better than givenchy black magic livs lips.NO gross taste.the color is magnificent in every way.Beauty Bridge delivered lipstick immediately and IN PERFECT condition.I LOVE THIS lipstick.totally intuitive and perfect amount of color.</li>
    <li> Really like the way it feels and looks.</li>
    <li> Loved this product!  The slight blue tint was very flattering.  I would of given it a 5 star rating but $25 (+ shipping) is much to expensive for a lip gloss that has very little staying power.</li>
    <li> This is a lovely plum color, however wherever there was the slightest dryness on my lips, it looked dark blue/black.If not for that I would have kept it</li>
