<li> was a least 10 buck more</li>

<li> The beautyblender sponge came as white and not pink.</li>
<li> I ordered a second time and again received only a single sponge, no cleanser, no organizer bag.</li>
<li> and I thought a white one would start to look gross sooner than a pink one.</li>
<li> I compared it to my other inexpensive makeup sponges/blenders and it does the same job.</li>
<li> What I received was a single sponge.</li>
<li> However I have today received the \\&quot;kit\\&quot; with only a beautyblender bouncing up and down in the box by itself.</li>
<li> The travel kit did not come in a pink organza bag, but the beautyblender sponge came alone in its plastic case.</li>
<li> I wet it and then put the foundation on it.  </li>
<li> if you wet it everytime before you use it, it makes the liquid glides on ur skin</li>
<li> I did not even get the pink beautyblender I got a white one and was very small</li>
<li> I did not receive the cleanser to wash it definitely NOT WORTH THE BUY.</li>
<li> 1st time I&#x27;ve ever been let down by amazon.</li>
<li> I needed to buy a replacement beauty blender since my current one was looking old and dirty.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve done a lot of research on this blender as well as the black pro sponge.</li>
<li> doesn&#x27;t mess with the coverage.&lt;br /&gt;Recommend</li>
<li> I was almost sick to my stomach as I watched how much this cleaner took out!</li>
<li> &quot; I am very disappointed that I had to go through returning this item because I paid for more than what I received.</li>
<li> Whoever says they have dupes for this cleaner are ridiculous.</li>
<li> I specifically wanted a pink one because it gets really dirty</li>
<li> This was how the Beautyblender Travel Kit was described \\&quot;Product Includes: (1)Beautyblender &amp; (1)3OZ Blendercleanser in a Pink Organza Bag.\\&quot; sold by T &amp; T Enterprises LLC.</li>
<li> I probably won&#x27;t order from this seller again just because I have no idea what even went wrong.</li>
<li> disappointed because I am to give this gift in the am.</li>
<li> disappointed.</li>
<li> Stupid me didn&#x27;t read the reviews, if I had I would not havw gone with this buyer.</li>
<li> Very disappointed.</li>
<li> and it was packaged HORRIBLE!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> The item came the way that it was described and i absolutely love my beauty blender!! :)</li>
    <li> did not come with bag or cleanser just white beauty blender in the process of returning the item now</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve heard so many great reviews about the beauty blender on you tube, magazines etc that i decided to try it. I choose the travel size blender thinking this could be my \\&quot;sample\\&quot; but its bigger than i thought it would be, it&#x27;s a regular size sponge... this stuff evenly blends my full coverage foundation like a charm, it barely looks like i have foundation on !!!!  Like others said it&#x27;s best if you wet it everytime before you use it, it makes the liquid glides on ur skin, it&#x27;s amazing ! i&#x27;m going to order more it&#x27;s worth the money trust me, it saves you time the morning when you have to hurry to go to work or whatever cause this product is so easy to work with, leaves no streaks on your face and you litteraly look hairbrushed. and i&#x27;ve got comments on how great my skin looks.</li>
    <li> I love how my foundation looks with the beauty blender. I recommend it to everyone</li>
    <li> Ita Authentic and i research this company and this is an authorized seller confirmed on the beautyblender website. I like this product but its to pricey for an item that will eventually need to be replaced.</li>
    <li> I ordered this for a backup and for the cleaner. Whoever says they have dupes for this cleaner are ridiculous. I had a beauty blender from almost a year ago that I knew was not getting cleaned to its potential. I was almost sick to my stomach as I watched how much this cleaner took out!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve done a lot of research on this blender as well as the black pro sponge. I bought both as a gift. I haven&#x27;t gotten the review as of yet. That will come later. However buyers beware. The product list a 3 oz cleaner and organza bag. However. I received only the white sponge. That is my only reason for giving this a 1 star.&lt;br /&gt;Very disappointed because I am to give this gift in the am. There is no time for replacement.&lt;br /&gt;Very disappointed. Especially when I paid for express shipping. 1st time I&#x27;ve ever been let down by amazon.</li>
    <li> I think that this product is pricey for what it does. I compared it to my other inexpensive makeup sponges/blenders and it does the same job. You can easily find similar ones for cheap. Good product but not worth the money.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product and did not receive it complete. I did not even get the pink beautyblender I got a white one and was very small and it was packaged HORRIBLE! I did not receive the cleanser to wash it definitely NOT WORTH THE BUY.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a diehard beauty blender user. I can&#x27;t apply my foundation without it!</li>
    <li> The beauty blender itself is great. I swear by this product. It is pricey but in my opinion worth it. I needed to buy a replacement beauty blender since my current one was looking old and dirty. I turned to amazon to see if I could get a better price. I found this deal that included the beauty blender plus the cleanser for the price of what the beauty blender itself would cost at sephora. Stupid me didn&#x27;t read the reviews, if I had I would not havw gone with this buyer. This is my first time I got cheated on amazon. I received a white beauty blender in a plastic box. No cleanser at all! The product did not arrive as stated or shown. I specifically wanted a pink one because it gets really dirty and I thought a white one would start to look gross sooner than a pink one. I am very dissapointed and looking into how I can return this item. I will just bite the bullet and purchase it again at sephora.</li>
    <li> It says travel kit but it&#x27;s only the blender by itself. Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> This item is NOT what it is described to be. It&#x27;s described as the Beautyblender Sponge, with a bottle of cleanser and an organizer bag. What I received was a single sponge. The label on the bottom identified it as the Beautyblender Travel Kit, so I believed that I had simply received an incorrectly labeled item. I ordered a second time and again received only a single sponge, no cleanser, no organizer bag. I will not be ordering again.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product because the original picture showed a travel sized pink beauty blender with a travel size beauty blender cleanser. What I actually received was just a white beauty blender. THAT WAS IT! So I returned it, thanks to the helpful Amazon customer service. I probably won&#x27;t order from this seller again just because I have no idea what even went wrong.</li>
    <li> i likeee so much!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  is so good , u need to buy it .. es muy bueno tienes que comprarlo</li>
    <li> This product applys foundation smoothly. It uses way less foundation that many foundation brushes and creates a flawless finish. I have used with my full coverage and light coverage foundations- doesn&#x27;t mess with the coverage.&lt;br /&gt;Recommend this!!</li>
    <li> Love this! Product goes on smooth and looks flawless. Worth the money, defiantly recumbent investing in this! From a professional make up artist.</li>
    <li> DO NOT ORDER this product! My beauty blender was opened &amp; it DID NOT include the cleanser and mesh bag!&lt;br /&gt;I honestly don&#x27;t even think this is the real beauty blender! Beyond DISSATISFIED!</li>
    <li> This was how the Beautyblender Travel Kit was described \\&quot;Product Includes: (1)Beautyblender &amp; (1)3OZ Blendercleanser in a Pink Organza Bag.\\&quot; sold by T &amp; T Enterprises LLC. However I have today received the \\&quot;kit\\&quot; with only a beautyblender bouncing up and down in the box by itself.</li>
    <li> I love this beauty tool for so many reasons. The way it applies foundation, even coverage, easy to use, and the convenience! Best beauty thing I have ever bought!</li>
    <li> I use this to apply my foundation.  I wet it and then put the foundation on it.  Then apply to my face.  It is easy and works well for even coverage.  There is also a pink version but the white is the best.</li>
    <li> The deliver of this item was prompt. However, the item is not as described. I only received the beautyblender sponge, and nothing else. The beautyblender sponge came as white and not pink. The travel kit did not come in a pink organza bag, but the beautyblender sponge came alone in its plastic case. There was NO blender cleanser that came with the \\&quot;kit.\\&quot; I am very disappointed that I had to go through returning this item because I paid for more than what I received. Since the seller is a third party company that is only associated with Amazon, and not Amazon itself, Amazon cannot guarantee that this item will come as described.</li>
    <li> Only received a white beauty blender... did not receive the bag or the cleaning liquid... the description States it comes with all three things or how else would it be a kit ?</li>
    <li> Awesome item i got it for a great price considering thay everywhere else was a least 10 buck more but besides that it got here quick and i love my beauty blender!</li>
