      <li>Nice browns, good for summer.</li>
      <li>But when she uses her own make up brushes she says it&#x27;s amazing.</li>
      <li>This is a nice neutral palette, which would work with all eye colors.</li>
      <li>It’s a nice addition to my make-up, but I wouldn’t say it’s</li>
      <li>These are nice shadows for work.  </li>
      <li>Nice matte colors, no sparkle but long-lasting.</li>
      <li>Be prepared to use your own make-up brushes.</li>

      <li>And I love the colors</li>
      <li>I especially liked the simple instructions and</li>
      <li>I love these pallets.</li>
      <li>I really love the shades in this product.  </li>
      <li>They are very soft and have a beautiful texture to them.</li>
      <li>Of course, the best aspect is that it doesn&#x27;t crease as much as most eye shadow does after wearing it for few hours.  </li>
      <li>any Neutrogena product, this one is hypoallergenic and easy on the skin.</li>
      <li>These colors do not wear off easily.</li>
      <li>The colors are vibrant and look good with just about anything.</li>
      <li>I applied the eye shadow at 7:15 A.M., and it was still going strong at 5:00.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Please note that the Cool Plum palette appears more saturated/vibrant in the picture than it is.</li>
      <li>Their brushes worked fine for what they were meant for.  </li>
      <li>Shimmery eye shadow highlights fine lines on my lids and at the corners of my eyes.</li>
      <li>i remove the shadow my eye lids and skin feel great, not dry at all.</li>
      <li>The colors in this palette are fabulous.</li>
      <li>The color lasts all day and goes on smooth.</li>
      <li>So, if you&#x27;re looking for a very neutral palette, any one of these I think would work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have my own brushes but deliberately used their brushes for testing purposes.  </li>
      <li>The quality is great, it lasts long, doesn&#x27;t rub off easily and the packaging protects the product</li>
      <li>I received classic nude (#60), and I could not have asked for a more appropriate set, since nudes complement my olive complexion.</li>
      <li>I would guess that Classic Nude might be better suited for someone with more olive or warmer skin tones than my</li>
      <li>The eye make-up went on easy and was very pretty on my eyes.</li>
      <li>Nudes are what&#x27;s big for Spring 2015 and these look great with my blue eyes and fair skin tone.  </li>
      <li>At first I was concerned that the colors were disappearing into my skin, but once I had on all four colors, in the prescribed locations, the look was quite lovely (albeit neutral and not dramatic).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Fun product and extremely easy to use.  </li>
      <li>So  for the most part I like the colors in these palettes, though I think they could have a little more explanation on the back or on an insert as to how to apply them for best effect.</li>
      <li>This was very good eyeshadow that i got, the only problem was that the shades of the pallet looks darker in the picture but a little lighter on hand but still a good product i will use.</li>
      <li>I have been using Neutrogena products for many years, and generally associate them with cleansing products and moisturizers more than beauty/cosmetic products.</li>
      <li>Stay put and stay true.</li>
      <li>favorite palette is the &amp;#34;cool plum&amp;#34;, which really brightened my eyes (along with some mascara).  </li>
      <li>They stayed true to their color too.  </li>
      <li>Use other brushes, and this shadow is great.  </li>
      <li>Of the three color packs I received, Cool Plum flattered me the most, followed by Soft Taupe.</li>
      <li>would probably be a poor choice for someone who prefers more exotic and louder eye makeup, but a good match for those who would like their eyes, rather than their makeup, to be the first thing people notice.  </li>
      <li>much ore comfortable with the look</li>
      <li>I really like the color combination and the smooth texture.  </li>
      <li>My favorite color palette with my complexion was Soft Taupe.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It seems cost effective to buy this pallette with built in primer, but you are actually wasting money because it just doesn&#x27;t stay put.</li>
      <li>Lastly, this product is kind to my eye needs.</li>
      <li>Because I&#x27;m 53 years old, I love that there isn&#x27;t a lot of &amp;#34;shimmer&amp;#34; in the natural-looking shades in each combination.</li>
      <li>that&#x27;s safe for sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>This eye shadow compact is colorful and long-lasting.</li>
      <li>From my experience with it, I feel that the shadows are worth the money.</li>
      <li>Worth the price.</li>
      <li>My complexion is pretty light, so any color I put on my face tends to really pop out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>My favorite of the three palettes I got was the classic nude, followed by cool plum and soft taupe.</li>
      <li>They glide on very smoothly and actually stay put.  </li>
      <li>They are had a tiny bit of shimmer but were very light.</li>
      <li>I only wish they had a better applicator.  </li>
      <li>Although the compact includes specific instructions to wear each color at once, one can wear each color solo with lovely results.</li>
      <li>The applicator brush is designed to fit into the small case, which is handy.  </li>
      <li>The fact that there is a primer built in really helps the eye shadow to stay put!</li>
      <li>Great colors, long lasting.</li>
      <li>I have deep blue eyes and fair</li>
      <li>/&gt;These are definitely shadows that work better for a &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; or daytime look than a night out, but the effect really is quite lovely.&lt;br /&gt;These</li>
      <li>this is proof positive of that fact.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s simple, elegant, and easy to use--and lasts a long time so you don&#x27;t have to worry about reapplying.</li>
      <li>Application is easy enough, as is removal.</li>
      <li>As a person who loves makeup and likes variety, this was not a go to combination that I can use easily as even though it stays on the look is not dramatic enough for me.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll have to check out the stores to see if I can find a pure matte.</li>
      <li>I have very sensitive eye lids and most eye shadows make them red and irritated.</li>
      <li>I was sent three color packs to review: Soft Taupe, Classic Nude, and Cool Plum.</li>
      <li>My order included three of the six 12 hour eye shadow color combinations: Soft Taupe, Cool Plums and Classic Nude.</li>
      <li>product isn&#x27;t going to make me a huge fan of eye shadow, but I can recommend it to people who ARE into wearing eye shadow on a regular basis.</li>
      <li>My package came with a sheet listing which colors should be used on which part of the lid that I found very helpful.</li>
      <li>The colors are very neutral</li>
      <li>Unfortunately, it&#x27;s a really crappy brush.  </li>
      <li>very well.&lt;br</li>
      <li>And for me four shadows on at any given time was a bit much even if they were subdued colors.</li>
      <li>The colors are very neutral and not saturated.  </li>
      <li>but I also have very oily eyelids</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This was very good eyeshadow that i got, the only problem was that the shades of the pallet looks darker in the picture but a little lighter on hand but still a good product i will use.</li>
    <li> My wife is obsessed with this make up. She tells me that it&#x27;s the best she&#x27;s ever had. She doesn&#x27;t use the applicator that came with it. But when she uses her own make up brushes she says it&#x27;s amazing. The color pallets are perfect. The makeup stays on all day without the normal creases that other makeup has.</li>
    <li> Great colors, long lasting. Stay put and stay true. Hypo-allergenic. This is a nice neutral palette, which would work with all eye colors. Excellent eye shadows.</li>
    <li> Fun product and extremely easy to use.  I especially liked the simple instructions and how good it looked once applied. The quality is great, it lasts long, doesn&#x27;t rub off easily and the packaging protects the product very well.&lt;br /&gt;The colors are very nice and look great.&lt;br /&gt;Once i remove the shadow my eye lids and skin feel great, not dry at all. Worth the price.</li>
    <li> Well i have very very bad allergy, and i love makeup everytime i going out even just in gricery store, and ghis makeup i never fe&lt;br /&gt;T a ything with my eyes,, and it is soo beautiful too,, i buy w&lt;br /&gt;This again</li>
    <li> I really like the color combination and the smooth texture.  Of course, the best aspect is that it doesn&#x27;t crease as much as most eye shadow does after wearing it for few hours.  I would recommend giving it a try.</li>
    <li> Nice browns, good for summer. Stays put even in humidity.</li>
    <li> The item was completely damaged when I received it. Very disappointed!</li>
    <li> My order included three of the six 12 hour eye shadow color combinations: Soft Taupe, Cool Plums and Classic Nude. I love that Neutrogena offers a nourishing, long wear eye shadow with a built in primer that&#x27;s safe for sensitive skin. Because I&#x27;m 53 years old, I love that there isn&#x27;t a lot of &amp;#34;shimmer&amp;#34; in the natural-looking shades in each combination. Shimmery eye shadow highlights fine lines on my lids and at the corners of my eyes. At my age, I tend to stick with lighter colors in eye makeup in particular (the smokey eye look no longer works for me), so I use the highlighter or lightest shade on my lid, the second lightest color in the crease, and one of the dark shades as a carefully applied liner. The shadow goes on well, doesn&#x27;t crease or smudge during the day, and seems to last if not 12 hours, then at least for 8 without fading. I also haven&#x27;t noticed an itching or burning while wearing it. The only reason I&#x27;m not rating this five stars is because three of the four shades in each palette I received are pretty dark; I would have preferred more of a mid tone to wear with the light tone for everyday wear.</li>
    <li> Very nice set of eye shadows. The color combinations are very well thought out. The colors wear for a long time. The primer is the  key to the lasting effect. The included brush is a bit small but can work in a pinch if out and about and needing a bit of a touchup. Good stuff.</li>
    <li> So  for the most part I like the colors in these palettes, though I think they could have a little more explanation on the back or on an insert as to how to apply them for best effect. My favorite of the three palettes I got was the classic nude, followed by cool plum and soft taupe. My main problem was that they were very crumbly, especially considering that they contain primer. They staid in place for the most part but when applying then even very lightly little flecks would shower down on to my cheeks. And for me four shadows on at any given time was a bit much even if they were subdued colors. One of the containers came a bit damaged but I superglued the &amp;#34;glass&amp;#34; window back in and there wasn&#x27;t too much shadow loss.</li>
    <li> This eye shadow compact is colorful and long-lasting. Although the compact includes specific instructions to wear each color at once, one can wear each color solo with lovely results. I received classic nude (#60), and I could not have asked for a more appropriate set, since nudes complement my olive complexion. These colors do not wear off easily. I applied the eye shadow at 7:15 A.M., and it was still going strong at 5:00. Lastly, this product is kind to my eye needs. My eyes are very sensitive, which has prevented me from purchasing just any brand. I have always trusted Neutrogena for this reason, because the brand offers quality products for every person. Lastly, although I do believe the item is somewhat pricy, I undoubtedly know the set is worth it. Another bonus, since my using this set, nobody had ever noticed my eyeshadow at work (not that I expect anyone to do so), but it was nice receiving compliments not only for the shades but also for the subtle presentation on my eyes. I definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> The colors in this palette are fabulous. I got these for my teenage daughter and sge absolutely loves them. I would recommend definitelynbecause of the many choices there are for colors.</li>
    <li> I was sent three color packs to review: Soft Taupe, Classic Nude, and Cool Plum. My complexion is is Winter, which means that my medium-fair skin is complimented best by fabrics that are jewel tones, true red, black, grey, and pure white. Of the three color packs I received, Cool Plum flattered me the most, followed by Soft Taupe. I would guess that Classic Nude might be better suited for someone with more olive or warmer skin tones than my own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This kit is nice from the standpoint of an eyeshadow newbie because it comes with preselected palettes,  but overall it is useless. Built in primer just doesn&#x27;t work and this is proof positive of that fact. It doesn&#x27;t matter if I apply this shadow with the included applicator, a makeup sponge, or a brush. It is almost entirely gone in minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It seems cost effective to buy this pallette with built in primer, but you are actually wasting money because it just doesn&#x27;t stay put. Spend a little more and get eyeshadow primer and eyeshadow powder separately.  Not only will your eyeshadow stay where you put it but you will avoid a lot of the creasing/wrinkle exaggeration that happens without the primer. Also, get yourself a brush or at least a sponge. The foam tip applicators just can&#x27;t blend well at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am sad because I usually love this brand.&lt;br /&gt;Please note that the Cool Plum palette appears more saturated/vibrant in the picture than it is. It is more muted in person.</li>
    <li> Excelent for my skyn type And I love the colors</li>
    <li> These eye shadows have a very nice texture.  I don&#x27;t really know how to describe it other than to say they feel creamy but they don&#x27;t crease like some shadows do.  The colors are very neutral so if you&#x27;re looking from drama this is not the choice for you.  Even the dark color that serves as the liner is not really that dark.  These are nice shadows for work.  Nice matte colors, no sparkle but long-lasting.</li>
    <li> This review is based on classic nude.  I really love the shades in this product.  Nudes are what&#x27;s big for Spring 2015 and these look great with my blue eyes and fair skin tone.  I think it would look good with a variety of eye colors and skin tones.  My package came with a sheet listing which colors should be used on which part of the lid that I found very helpful. This product claims to be long lasting and have a built in primer.  Normally I used Too Faced eye shadow primer but skipped that to test out this product.  On a scale of 1-10 with 1 being no shadow left and 10 being it looks the same as if you just put it on l, I give the product an 8.  From my experience with it, I feel that the shadows are worth the money.</li>
    <li> I love these pallets. The color lasts all day and goes on smooth. The fact that there is a primer built in really helps the eye shadow to stay put! The colors are vibrant and look good with just about anything.</li>
    <li> I have tried three different palettes of the Neutrogena Nourishing Long Wear Eye Shadow.  The formulas are gentle, even for my very sensitive skin and reactive, allergic eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are definitely shadows that work better for a &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; or daytime look than a night out, but the effect really is quite lovely.&lt;br /&gt;These would probably be a poor choice for someone who prefers more exotic and louder eye makeup, but a good match for those who would like their eyes, rather than their makeup, to be the first thing people notice.  The colors are very neutral and not saturated.  On application, they remind me of a dry wash or tint.  At first I was concerned that the colors were disappearing into my skin, but once I had on all four colors, in the prescribed locations, the look was quite lovely (albeit neutral and not dramatic).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My favorite palette is the &amp;#34;cool plum&amp;#34;, which really brightened my eyes (along with some mascara).  My skin is very pale, very pink/ruddy, and my lashes and hair are dark blond (lashes bordering on black), and my eyes are grey (with a dark grey ring).  The other colors didn&#x27;t work as well, as far as accentuating my eyes, but I would guess that others with different skin and eye tones/colors may find the other palettes to be more complimentary for them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as &amp;#34;long wear&amp;#34;, I found these had faded quite a bit at around the 4 hour mark, though the darker accents in the crease and along the last line, were still visible they were not so fresh looking.  Sleeping in them for 8 hours found some dust and smudge on my lower lids, and little left on the top lids.  So not great for waking up and looking fresh for another person, but really, do we want to wake up next to someone who inventories such things?</li>
    <li> These powder eye shadows claim to be long-wear since they have a built-in primer in them. Personally, I did not notice that they are long-wearing but I also have very oily eyelids so I have to use a primer and a base with any eye shadow application. The shadows are pigmented, blendable, and very easy to work with. I did notice that they all have a hint of shimmer to them but it is very subtle. They are very soft and have a beautiful texture to them. They gave a very natural and pretty look on the eyes. I especially loved the cool plum quad.  If you have a question leave a comment and I will try to answer.</li>
    <li> This is a great day-time eye shadow. I have very sensitive eye lids and most eye shadows make them red and irritated. These shadows did not do that, even after wearing them several days in a row. They were truly long wearing. I didn&#x27;t experience any creasing. I even took a nap with it on and it stayed put! I am a very pale red-head and tried Soft Taupe, Cool Plum and Classic Nude. All are nice neutral color palettes that looked good on me. They are had a tiny bit of shimmer but were very light. That&#x27;s why I say they are good day-time shadows. I like a smokier eye for a night out. My favorite color palette with my complexion was Soft Taupe.</li>
    <li> I have been using Neutrogena products for many years, and generally associate them with cleansing products and moisturizers more than beauty/cosmetic products. I have never been disappointed by any of those products. Though I don&#x27;t often wear eye shadow, I thought I would give this product a try because I was offered a trial sample of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like any Neutrogena product, this one is hypoallergenic and easy on the skin. Application is easy enough, as is removal. The eye shadow seemed to stay in place without wrinkling for the duration of the days when I wore it. The colors were nice enough, but I definitely prefer the ones that are closest to a natural nude look. My complexion is pretty light, so any color I put on my face tends to really pop out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product isn&#x27;t going to make me a huge fan of eye shadow, but I can recommend it to people who ARE into wearing eye shadow on a regular basis.</li>
    <li> For someone with hooded eyes this eyeshadow is really wonderful. It stays on all day long and doesn&#x27;t rub off like a lot of other eyeshadows.</li>
    <li> I got 3 different packs of this eyeshadow.  Each one comes with instructions on the back (which I need my glasses to see) and two small brushes.  I love makeup and was really looking forward to these being my new everyday look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used the brushes they provided.  I have deep blue eyes and fair skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The positive side is the colors definitely stayed on.  They stayed true to their color too.  So, if you&#x27;re looking for a very neutral palette, any one of these I think would work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have my own brushes but deliberately used their brushes for testing purposes.  Their brushes worked fine for what they were meant for.  However, the smallest color is an eyeliner brush and the brush they provided didn&#x27;t work for that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did not wet the color.  Instead I used it as it was with the brush provided and I did not feel this gave me a smoky eye look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Instead, I used some liquid liner I had and some darker shadow.  Then I felt much ore comfortable with the look I achieved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re just starting with makeup and would like a very neutral look with suggestions on how to achieve it, this may be a good buy for you.  As a person who loves makeup and likes variety, this was not a go to combination that I can use easily as even though it stays on the look is not dramatic enough for me.</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin, so Neutrogena products are some of my favorites.  The colors are great, with helpful instructions included. The applicator brush is designed to fit into the small case, which is handy.  Unfortunately, it&#x27;s a really crappy brush.  Use other brushes, and this shadow is great.  The colors are good, it applies well and stays on without creasing.</li>
    <li> Neautrogena’s Nourishing Long Wear Eye Shadow was a competent make-up, but I didn’t notice any “longer-lasting” wear than my other Sephora and Urban Decay eye-shadows.  The eye make-up went on easy and was very pretty on my eyes. It’s a nice addition to my make-up, but I wouldn’t say it’s my favorite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The make-up brush is ridiculous though, they might as well not have included it. It is about the size of a quarter, I think I would probably get a cramp trying to use it on my eyes. Be prepared to use your own make-up brushes.</li>
    <li> (Written by my wife) I tried the Classic Nude palette and like it quite a bit.  My eyes look defined but not like I am trying to be a clown even when wearing all four colors.  They glide on very smoothly and actually stay put.  I only wish they had a better applicator.  I have a brush that I use that is much better, although I use the applicator that came with it for the crease and eyeliner shades.</li>
    <li> I got several different shades of this product (3-4 cases) and I really like them all. The product contains color for your lid, for above the lid, for the crease, and for by the lashes. The colors complement each other. The lid colors are lighter and the crease and lash areas are darker for a smoky effect. On the back of the case, there are directions on how to apply. This shadow stays on all day for me--sometimes if I don&#x27;t wash it off, it&#x27;s on the next day. It&#x27;s not hard to remove though. It comes off with a simple wash rag and water, but it&#x27;s nice that it will last all day, even if you happen to rub it (which I have done!)  I like the simplicity of this makeup. I have sensitive skin and I don&#x27;t at all react to this product. It&#x27;s simple, elegant, and easy to use--and lasts a long time so you don&#x27;t have to worry about reapplying.</li>
    <li> This eyeshadow works great.  I have oily eyelids (eww, I know, too much information) and regular eyeshadow does tend to slide down into my creases, but this stuff stays put.  The colors are well matched to each other too, and a set of 4 is very versatile in terms of the looks you can go with.  I just wish the one I was sent didn&#x27;t have shimmer -- at my age (50ish) I do prefer a completely matte eyeshadow.  I&#x27;ll have to check out the stores to see if I can find a pure matte.</li>
