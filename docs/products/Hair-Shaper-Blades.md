<li> They are indeed extra sharp.  </li>
<li> These blades are sharp, arrived on time and and will last about 7-10 shaves as I wear a beard.</li>
<li> Really sharp, and if you&#x27;re using them for personal use like shaving they&#x27;ll last 5+ shaves even if you have thick facial hair.</li>
<li> there kinda a toss up between the two they both start out with the first two blades been real sharp after that the other are kinda dull</li>
<li> Be very careful because it could cut you if you are not paying close attention.</li>
<li> Very sharp, i have no doubt about these blades.</li>
<li> you can only use them once then they start grating the face not good</li>
<li> I&#x27;m not sure</li>
<li> the skin have an ugly rash that resembles acne.  </li>
<li> but it was a crap shoot with all the blades to choose from as they dont state the size of the blade.</li>

    <li> I&#x27;ve been using a straight razor for 20 years.  When I used these blades, I drew blood four times, and the places where I didn&#x27;t actually nick the skin have an ugly rash that resembles acne.  I&#x27;m not sure what type chemical process, or metal additive would cause a reaction like this but I will never use these blades again.</li>
    <li> Super Sharp as intended. My hairline is fresh!</li>
    <li> This is exactly what my wife was looking for.  We were able to replace an old worn out blade with a new one and immediately had a chance to use it and it worked like it should have with no problems.</li>
    <li> Works like it should.</li>
    <li> Definitely Personna&#x27;s best blades yet.  They are indeed extra sharp.  I use these in a straight razor (using a natural shaving creme with mortar and brush), and the shave is extremely comfortable.  I have been shaving using disposable straight blades for about twelve years now, and this is definitely the best I&#x27;ve used so far.&lt;br /&gt;The price was below retail, and they shipped fast.

    <li> Quick delivery and product was in great shape but it was a crap shoot with all the blades to choose from as they dont state the size of the blade. It was not what I wanted.</li>
    <li> I came across a Weck surgical prep straight razor that uses these blades. I was given the razor over 30 years ago and when I ran out of blades, I just put it away. These blades are sharp, arrived on time and and will last about 7-10 shaves as I wear a beard. I recommend these, but have no idea where one could get a new razor to use them. I understand they are used primarily in shaping combs.</li>
    <li> I love these things. I use them in my hair shaper. Very sharp, i have no doubt about these blades.</li>
    <li> Great blades for weck straight razor.</li>
    <li> I am new to using straight razors and these blades have help with the conversion process. I have tried out 3 other straight razor blades, and this is by far my favorite. Be very careful because it could cut you if you are not paying close attention.</li>

    <li> But definitely only for the person who likes to live on the wild side.  Yesseree.  It takes a clear mind, a steady hand, and nerves of steel.  Not for environments where young children might be a distraction.  I have a Richard The Lion-heart beard and these puppies allow me to do all of the long straight lines, as well as the intricate cutouts.</li>
    <li> Great price.  I will buy these again as needed.</li>
    <li> Really sharp, and if you&#x27;re using them for personal use like shaving they&#x27;ll last 5+ shaves even if you have thick facial hair.</li>

    <li> I arch eyebrows a lot and these blades work very well!!....especially for the price!!!! Please be sure to toss them after each client!!!! They also make it easier for meti arch my own eyebrows!!</li>
    <li> there kinda a toss up between the two they both start out with the first two blades been real sharp after that the other are kinda dull you can only use them once then they start grating the face not good guess its marketing tack tick.was surprised personna was also made in japan</li>
    <li> works real well and lasts through many haircuts.  A box usually lasts me more than 4 months.</li>
    <li> The blades worked excellently in shaving facial hair.  Was taken on a mission trip to the Central America and was used to provide styling for the local populace.</li>
    <li> my mom was a hairdresser 40 years ago and these were the only thing she ever used to cut hair. When i told her I could get them on line  she was so happy. At 81 she still does her own hair and loves the blades</li>
    <li> Is exactly what I thought it was &amp; arrived as was stated.</li>
