      <li>They work perfectly.</li>
      <li>I was looking for a product to help with my nails and this was perfect.  </li>
      <li>The product works great &amp; makes a good gift item, however there are no instructions &amp; you have to figure out which side to start with.</li>
      <li>Loved the price here and the product.</li>
      <li>Ok,So I bought this buffer in hopes it would be as good as the ones they sell at the mall for $50.</li>
      <li>I have to say that I really love this thing!</li>
      <li>This looks like it would be handy to have around...and it would have been...if it worked.</li>
      <li>With the labeled four sides it is simple to use and works great!!</li>
      <li>Love them.</li>
      <li>This buffer should not cost more than one dollar.  </li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>These are OK</li>
      <li>that the difference between grits was more pronounced.  </li>
      <li>However, to find it quick and&lt;br /&gt;inexpensive was amazing.</li>
      <li>- I use this to smooth the tip of my nails, rather than the face</li>
      <li>and its cheap.</li>
      <li>-- this takes so long that your hand starts hurting, and I doubt it will be good for many uses.      </li>
      <li>Would have been okay if the sides didn&#x27;t fall off after the first use.</li>
      <li>(yes, some guys do care about their nails, specially when we have had nails problems like fungus on the past).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This was cheap all right, but doesn&#x27;t offer the rougher, more abrasive surfaces (available in say a Revlon nail file) which are useful for initial shaping.</li>
      <li>This is a great product for a few reasons:    </li>
      <li>its great, it gets the job done fast sonce its big and covesr ur whole nail with couple of rubs.</li>
      <li>They were right.  </li>
      <li>The block shines your nails nicely, but it is kind of difficult to figure out which one to use first specially for me that I am a guy</li>
      <li>Great product and so much more inexpensive than the version sold in shopping mall kiosks, yet does the same job as the more expensive brand</li>
      <li>So the product works well enough, and one side benefit is that since it isn&#x27;t that grittty, I feel safe throwing one in my purse and that it won&#x27;t scratch my glasses.    </li>
      <li>It does have pretty colors but does not do what it is suppose to do.  </li>
      <li>I did contact the manufacturer to determine which side to use first.  </li>
      <li>Buffing sides began peeling off the first day.  </li>
      <li>(guitarists need extremely smooth nail edges), which means I use the buffer more aggressively than most - but the adhesion of the strips to the block is much, much too weak for any application.  </li>
      <li>You can buff with orange as much as you want.</li>
      <li>I wanted a cheap nail filing tool since I play classical guitar.</li>
      <li>Thanks to Amazon, ordering is made simple.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Hello, thank you for the quick delivery, I really should have bought several because al of my friends want one too!</li>
      <li>They were selling these in the mall where I live for 10 times the price!</li>
      <li>/&gt;It lasts a decent amount of time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>High shine was the result of my guesswork.  </li>
      <li>I was told to go from dark to light.  </li>
      <li>and I dont know which color to do first, second,third, and fourth.    </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve only had a couple of these over the years and didn&#x27;t really pay attention to the brand.  </li>
      <li>You cannot get enough pressure onto your nail, so you must use it very vigorously for the smallest benefit.</li>
      <li>The only side that had any bit of worth was the pink side that shined....</li>
      <li>On the one I got, you can easily figure out which side you use first, pink, then green, then purple and orange last, for the final buff.  </li>
      <li>It arrived before it was suppose to and it is exactly like the one in the mall for half the price if not less.</li>
      <li>The price is hard to beat if you get free shipping.</li>
      <li>Spent too much time looking this up.</li>
      <li>I read a previous review before I purchased when the reviewer said this product doesn&#x27;t say which side to start with first.  </li>
      <li>is used last, but the teal, blue, and lime green sides all feel pretty similar.</li>

<li> The quality of the buffing is not good, because the interior block is much too soft.  </li>

<li> Just swipe once with pink, green and purple to start, so you can learn how much smoothing your nails need.  </li>

<li> I received this product a few days ago.  </li>
<li> the other sides that are supposed to even out the ridges in your nails did not work hardly at all.</li>
<li> There&#x27;s no discernable differences between the sides and after a lot of scrubbing there&#x27;s very little impact.  </li>
<li> It makes your nails shinny looking  Not to mention this product saved me from paying $7.00 in shipping and handling on other products I ordered through Amazon.com!!!</li>
<li> SHINEY you are ridiculous.</li>
<li> but these are quite bad.</li>
<li> I hate to say it</li>
<li> but I was  horribly mistaken!  </li>
<li> but they have turned out to be be terrible.  </li>

    <li> With enough buffering, you can get your nails SOMEWHAT shiny with this. Not nearly as miraculous as the ones at the mall though -- this takes so long that your hand starts hurting, and I doubt it will be good for many uses.      Of course, this is all assuming that I have been using the sides in the correct order, which I will never know because the thing doesn&#x27;t come with instructions!  I&#x27;ve worked out the pink is used last, but the teal, blue, and lime green sides all feel pretty similar.</li>
    <li> I thought these would replace the Dead Sea buffer but I was  horribly mistaken!  These pads fall apart after using them 3 times!  Save your money!!!</li>
    <li> Well to star with the product dont carry an explanatory guide of how to use each side of the nail buffer and provided you with a shining nails just for a short period of time. Even though the product wasn&#x27;t expensive after all (is a good thing about) at least.</li>
    <li> Would have been okay if the sides didn&#x27;t fall off after the first use. Wouldn&#x27;t buy it again</li>
    <li> Hello, thank you for the quick delivery, I really should have bought several because al of my friends want one too! Thank you.</li>
    <li> I read a previous review before I purchased when the reviewer said this product doesn&#x27;t say which side to start with first.  I thought, can&#x27;t you just tell by feel?    They were right.  The four sides are all extremely similar and I can&#x27;t tell which to start with either.  I&#x27;ve had buffers before that the difference between grits was more pronounced.  Three of these sides all feel the same.      However, I guessed at it (using the one grittier side to start) and buffed my nails while watching television.  High shine was the result of my guesswork.  So the product works well enough, and one side benefit is that since it isn&#x27;t that grittty, I feel safe throwing one in my purse and that it won&#x27;t scratch my glasses.    The price is hard to beat if you get free shipping.</li>
    <li> I wanted a cheap nail filing tool since I play classical guitar. This was cheap all right, but doesn&#x27;t offer the rougher, more abrasive surfaces (available in say a Revlon nail file) which are useful for initial shaping.</li>
    <li> There is no insturctions and I dont know which color to do first, second,third, and fourth.    This product does work though.</li>
    <li> This looks like it would be handy to have around...and it would have been...if it worked. The only side that had any bit of worth was the pink side that shined....the other sides that are supposed to even out the ridges in your nails did not work hardly at all. they are going in the trash!</li>
    <li> Read other reviews for instructions but mine is not the same color combination.  I have pink, neon green, turqoise and dark blue.  Spent too much time looking this up.</li>
    <li> This product is four sided but three of the four sides seem to do the same thing.  I can&#x27;t tell a difference in my nails after using this buffer.  I did contact the manufacturer to determine which side to use first.  I was told to go from dark to light.  It does have pretty colors but does not do what it is suppose to do.  I would not recommend.</li>
    <li> This buffer should not cost more than one dollar.  Buffing sides began peeling off the first day.  Granted - I use this to smooth the tip of my nails, rather than the face (guitarists need extremely smooth nail edges), which means I use the buffer more aggressively than most - but the adhesion of the strips to the block is much, much too weak for any application.  At 4 dollars per block, the cost is not cheap.  The quality of the buffing is not good, because the interior block is much too soft.  You cannot get enough pressure onto your nail, so you must use it very vigorously for the smallest benefit.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a product to help with my nails and this was perfect.  With the labeled four sides it is simple to use and works great!!</li>
    <li> If you&#x27;re looking for something to make your nails shiny, this is definitely not it. It does all its other functions, except for leaving your nails shiny, which is the reason why I bought it.</li>
    <li> I was disappointed to find that the nail buffer did not include instructions to indicate the order to use the sides (which one to use first, second, etc.).</li>
    <li> its great, it gets the job done fast sonce its big and covesr ur whole nail with couple of rubs. and its cheap. thats all i expect of my nail buffer!!</li>
    <li> The product works great &amp; makes a good gift item, however there are no instructions &amp; you have to figure out which side to start with.</li>
    <li> I have to say that I really love this thing! It has helped me for when I cant get my nails done, I can fix my nails and buff them and make them shine before I put polish on them.</li>
    <li> I received this product a few days ago.  No instructions were provided. I had never used this type of thing so did not know what side to start with. I googled and I think I figured it out. Seems me to that this will not last very long.</li>
    <li> Great product and so much more inexpensive than the version sold in shopping mall kiosks, yet does the same job as the more expensive brand</li>
    <li> This is a great product for a few reasons:    Even though it doesn&#x27;t come with instructions, I just used the other reviews listed below on how to use it.  It makes your nails shinny looking  Not to mention this product saved me from paying $7.00 in shipping and handling on other products I ordered through Amazon.com!!!</li>
    <li> This product works. It is no big deal that the blocks do not come with instructions.  On the one I got, you can easily figure out which side you use first, pink, then green, then purple and orange last, for the final buff.  Just swipe once with pink, green and purple to start, so you can learn how much smoothing your nails need.  You can buff with orange as much as you want.</li>
    <li> Saw one of these in the mall for over 20.00. Loved the price here and the product. It arrived before it was suppose to and it is exactly like the one in the mall for half the price if not less. Love it.</li>
    <li> Ok,So I bought this buffer in hopes it would be as good as the ones they sell at the mall for $50. These are OK but AS ALL THE OTHER REVIEWERS SAID noone could figure out the correct order of the sides when there are NO instructions and you have a LIGHT GREEN and A DARK GREEN. I went to rite aid the next day and found them for about a dollar AND LABELLED SIDES..SHINEY you are ridiculous.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only had a couple of these over the years and didn&#x27;t really pay attention to the brand.  These showed up on Amazon so I picked them up but they have turned out to be be terrible.  There&#x27;s no discernable differences between the sides and after a lot of scrubbing there&#x27;s very little impact.  I hate to say it but these are quite bad.</li>
    <li> This productis in nail salons everywhere. However, to find it quick and&lt;br /&gt;inexpensive was amazing. Thanks to Amazon, ordering is made simple.&lt;br /&gt;It does work and I gave one away as a gift. I recommend it to whomever&lt;br /&gt;buys it.</li>
    <li> They were selling these in the mall where I live for 10 times the price! They work perfectly. I got extras for my friends! Love them.</li>
    <li> The block shines your nails nicely, but it is kind of difficult to figure out which one to use first specially for me that I am a guy (yes, some guys do care about their nails, specially when we have had nails problems like fungus on the past).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It lasts a decent amount of time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They should write the numbers order instead of that black label with the branding.</li>
