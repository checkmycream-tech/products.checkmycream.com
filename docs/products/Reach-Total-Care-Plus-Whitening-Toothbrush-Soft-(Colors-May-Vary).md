### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using a nimbus toothbrush for about 6 months, but decided to try this because of the excellent reviews.</li>
      <li>Priceless.</li>
      <li>My husband and I both have these and after about two weeks of use, I can say that it&#x27;s the BEST toothbrush I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
      <li>I bought this while searching for the best toothbrush on Amazon.</li>
      <li>this is the best toothbrush i&#x27;ve ever used.</li>

      <li>:) Recommend!</li>
      <li>How can a toothbrush be AMAZING you ask???</li>
      <li>Compared to Sonicare, this brush measures up nicely.  </li>
      <li>It feels like every bristle is textured so it feels more abrasive, in a good way.</li>
      <li>and I am brushing like three or four times a day because it feels so nice.</li>
      <li>I was flipping though the Popular Science (PopSci) list of \\&quot;Best New</li>
      <li>It leaves your teeth whiter and brighter U will love it for sure!</li>
      <li>These we very cheaply made.</li>
      <li>That being said, it&#x27;s one of the better manual brushes out there.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had many of these now.  </li>
      <li>not electric performs way better</li>
      <li>but... let&#x27;s just say these are my favorite toothbrushes.</li>
      <li>I love this toothbrush.</li>
      <li>BUT NOTHING IS BETTER</li>
      <li>and I have ordered them two more times since then.  </li>
      <li>Whitening toothbrushes for about a year now and have been pleased with them.</li>
      <li>They just make my teeth feel nice and clean.</li>
      <li>Gets my teeth clean, feels nice on my teeth and gums.</li>
      <li>and my teeth feel very clean after brushing.</li>

      <li>Easy grip.</li>
      <li>Easy on my gums.  </li>
      <li>They ship fast also I love it!</li>
      <li>I would purchase these again if they were available for cheaps, though.</li>
      <li>Reach&#x27;s famous angled head helps greatly when brushing my back molars, and the rubbery texture of the brush provides superior grip, even when my hands are wet.</li>
      <li>The amazing part is it does live up to its \\&quot;whitening\\&quot; name.  </li>
      <li>design is super comfortable</li>
      <li>They get your teeth clean.</li>
      <li>This was very well made, and felt good on the teeth, and it was very well priced.  </li>
      <li>This is not a bad tooth brush by any means though.  </li>
      <li>This has become a family favorite, sometimes even preferred over the electronic brushes because the reach to the back molars is easy!  </li>
      <li>Although I agree it&#x27;s a nice design and easy to maneuver, it only took about five seconds to get 3 bruises on my gums.</li>
      <li>It is very nice, first toothpaste I have ever used that I actually feel refreshed after using.  </li>
      <li>The bristles are holding up very well; the handle is comfortable and well-designed.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;It is very slendar and will fit in any toothbrush holder.</li>
      <li>I think it&#x27;s overhyped, but it IS a pretty cool toothbrush.</li>
      <li>I never imagined that I would be reviewing or buying toothbrushes on Amazon, but this toothbrush is worth it.</li>
      <li>In the past after brushing, I would try to clean the plaque remnants along the gumline with floss or by scraping, but neither method is very effective.</li>
      <li>My whole mouth feels fresh and my teeth feel extremely clean, just like they do after my annual dental cleaning.  </li>
      <li>have tried a lot of toothbrushes looking for the right one</li>
      <li>Having a good toothbrush is among those little things.  </li>
      <li>love that they keep making different  kinds.</li>
      <li>Just received this toothbrush and used it for the first time.  </li>
      <li>just had my first visit to the dentist and for the first time was told my teeth and gums look great.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Surprisingly good whiteners for this heavy coffee drinker.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this brand and model for 6 months now, and I am seeing the gradual improvement in whiteness (from normal brushing without any other heroic measures) that the article mentioned.&lt;br</li>
      <li>i am not sure about the whitening part, but it&#x27;s definitely comfortable and very easy to brush with.</li>
      <li>and I think this will be my Favorite for a long time to come.&lt;br /&gt;------------------------------&lt;br</li>
      <li>These soft bristles feel great for a hard brusher like myself.</li>
      <li>I really hope Amazon maintains the subscription service.</li>
      <li>I gotta say I really like these toothbrushes.</li>
      <li>How much is there to say about a toothbrush?</li>
      <li>but I have noticed my teeth look so much cleaner and polished since I made the switch.</li>
      <li>I have sensitive teeth and gums and even some other brands \\&quot;gentle\\&quot; brushes aren&#x27;t as easy on me as this, or they don&#x27;t feel like they get my teeth as clean if they are as gentle.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I love this tooth brush because I have a small mouth and this brush can reach all around comfortably, it also has soft bristles that don&#x27;t scratch your enamel.</li>
      <li>Plus Whitening toothbrush is better at cleaning plaque along the gumline than any other I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
      <li>I find that these toothbrushes are particularly helpful in making my teeth feel extra clean.  </li>
      <li>Decent sized head.</li>
      <li>I use the Trader Joe&#x27;s brand natural toothpaste which is flouride free and has several beneficial plant extracts for the teeth and gums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>They seemed decent, just not functioning as advertised.</li>
      <li>highly recommended.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend these.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not sure if this is it, but it sure was highly ranked.</li>
      <li>I would recommend to anyone who needs a new brush</li>
      <li>a have been using this brush about 9 months now and switched to a new brush every three months.</li>
      <li>but then they stopped carrying them in the stores around where I live</li>
      <li>In a fit of brushing rage, I actually managed to break the tooth brush in my tiny child hands.  </li>
      <li>I previously owned one of the most loved and expensive toothbrushes here on Amazon [[ASIN:</li>
      <li>The bristles aren&#x27;t very soft either.</li>
      <li>I like this toothbrush because it is very soft, and cleans well.</li>
      <li>Not sure how much more I can say about it.  </li>
      <li>Wow!  </li>
      <li>Using the same toothpaste I always have, I noticed my teeth did lighten up within the first week of switching to this toothbrush.  </li>
      <li>Bristles are comfortable and fan out in a way that covers my teeth well and even has a little massaging action.</li>
      <li>So far I haven&#x27;t noticed any whitening affects, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;ll be too noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>My teeth feel without a film on them and the bristles are not too abrasive, though my dental hygienist said to always use soft</li>
      <li>It feels very &amp;#34;solid&amp;#34; in my hand and has a much more hard plastic feeling than a typical Reach / Oral-B toothbrush (which are covered in grippy material).</li>
      <li>I feel like it actually cleans my teeth, but the one gripe I have is that switching from my old toothbrush to this one is that it lacks a tongue cleaner on the non-bristle side.</li>
      <li>I recently purchased a new toothpaste as well off Amazon, a Colgate Optic White pack of 2.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I never imagined that I would be reviewing or buying toothbrushes on Amazon, but this toothbrush is worth it. The Reach Total Care Plus Whitening toothbrush is better at cleaning plaque along the gumline than any other I&#x27;ve tried. In the past after brushing, I would try to clean the plaque remnants along the gumline with floss or by scraping, but neither method is very effective. I am very pleased to have found a toothbrush that works so well. I had difficulty finding this brush in the size I prefer locally, but as usual, Amazon has what I need.</li>
    <li> I previously owned one of the most loved and expensive toothbrushes here on Amazon [[ASIN:B003QYFVRY Philips Sonicare Hx5351/30 Essence, Rechargeable, Power Toothbrush, White]].&lt;br /&gt;( I gave that up because its a mold incubater)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This toothbrush allthough not electric performs way better my teeth feel like I just had them polished at the Dentist everytime I brush. It does reach back well into those back molars. Best of all I did not have to spend a fortune to find out if I liked it like I did with the Philips.&lt;br /&gt;It is very slendar and will fit in any toothbrush holder. I like how it looks too , it looks like something from a&lt;br /&gt;high end store&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have tried a lot of toothbrushes looking for the right one and I think this will be my Favorite for a long time to come.&lt;br /&gt;------------------------------&lt;br /&gt;Update&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I a have been using this brush about 9 months now and switched to a new brush every three months. I use the Trader Joe&#x27;s brand natural toothpaste which is flouride free and has several beneficial plant extracts for the teeth and gums.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just had my first visit to the dentist and for the first time was told my teeth and gums look great.&lt;br /&gt;I was diagnosed with severe gum disease and bone loss 2 years ago so this was a big deal for me, daily flossing of course has had a major role in my improvement but I have noticed my teeth look so much cleaner and polished since I made the switch.</li>
    <li> The point of this toothbrush is to increase whiteness, but I haven&#x27;t noticed my teeth being whiter. In a fit of brushing rage, I actually managed to break the tooth brush in my tiny child hands.  It shattered into a mess of toothpaste and plastic. I would purchase these again if they were available for cheaps, though. They seemed decent, just not functioning as advertised.</li>
    <li> This is not a bad tooth brush by any means though.  I recently purchased a new toothpaste as well off Amazon, a Colgate Optic White pack of 2.  It is very nice, first toothpaste I have ever used that I actually feel refreshed after using.  Priceless.</li>
    <li> This is a great toothbrush.  The bristles are holding up very well; the handle is comfortable and well-designed.  The amazing part is it does live up to its \\&quot;whitening\\&quot; name.  Using the same toothpaste I always have, I noticed my teeth did lighten up within the first week of switching to this toothbrush.  The difference is about equal to 1-2 Crest White Strips.</li>
    <li> How can a toothbrush be AMAZING you ask??? My husband and I both have these and after about two weeks of use, I can say that it&#x27;s the BEST toothbrush I&#x27;ve ever used. It&#x27;s bristles almost feel textured and it envelops your teeth in a wonderful massage that is easy on your gums. My teeth feel cleaner than they ever have and I am brushing like three or four times a day because it feels so nice. I have sensitive teeth and gums and even some other brands \\&quot;gentle\\&quot; brushes aren&#x27;t as easy on me as this, or they don&#x27;t feel like they get my teeth as clean if they are as gentle.&lt;br /&gt;I found this on clearance at Target recently but now they are out. I really hope Amazon maintains the subscription service.</li>
    <li> It leaves your teeth whiter and brighter U will love it for sure! They ship fast also I love it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using a nimbus toothbrush for about 6 months, but decided to try this because of the excellent reviews. Although I agree it&#x27;s a nice design and easy to maneuver, it only took about five seconds to get 3 bruises on my gums. I may be just too used to the softness of nimbus. So if that&#x27;s not an issue for you, it&#x27;s a great brush. I, however, won&#x27;t be using mine anymore.</li>
    <li> How much is there to say about a toothbrush? Not a lot.. but... let&#x27;s just say these are my favorite toothbrushes. I&#x27;m not one to take preference to little things like this but there are few points about this particular brush that blow the others out of the water:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The design is super comfortable&lt;br /&gt;The bristles are dense and of varied height, they get into the grooves, and it just feels good on my gums&lt;br /&gt;It actually does whiten over time (I dont like using whitening toothpaste so this is good)&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s slim enough that it fits into my antique toothbrush holder&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t see these in the store a lot, which is a bummer, but I don&#x27;t mind getting them through Amazon since I can get a few at a time.</li>
    <li> I love this toothbrush. It feels like every bristle is textured so it feels more abrasive, in a good way. Only drawback is for some reason there is a hole in the handle close to where you close your mouth around the brush, so sometimes foam/spit can dribble out.</li>
    <li> Just received this toothbrush and used it for the first time.  Wow!  My whole mouth feels fresh and my teeth feel extremely clean, just like they do after my annual dental cleaning.  Never had a tooth brush that replicated that feeling before.  Granted I brushed for a bit longer than I usually do bc the bristles felt so nice and refreshing, but I still think this is a great toothbrush.  Highly recommended, esp considering it isn&#x27;t much more expensive than any other toothbrush.  For anybody who happens to see this- does anybody know what the \\&quot;tongue scraper\\&quot; feature of this toothbrush is?  I tend to like to scrape my tongue after brushing but didn&#x27;t because I don&#x27;t want to ruin the bristles.  The description speaks of a tongue scraper but I couldn&#x27;t figure out which part of the brush this was... ?</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had many of these now.  Surprisingly good whiteners for this heavy coffee drinker.  May be a bit rough if you have soft teeth.</li>
    <li> I gotta say I really like these toothbrushes. I always bought them but then they stopped carrying them in the stores around where I live so I came on here to buy them! They just make my teeth feel nice and clean. Also my dentist said my teeth look great. So it&#x27;s either the brush or the toothpaste (arm &amp; hammer baking soda and peroxide). Would recommend!</li>
    <li> I love this tooth brush because I have a small mouth and this brush can reach all around comfortably, it also has soft bristles that don&#x27;t scratch your enamel.</li>
    <li> The little things do matter.  Having a good toothbrush is among those little things.  Great price and seemingly great performance.  Compared to Sonicare, this brush measures up nicely.  You can buy 30 or so of these for the price of a Sonicare.  Seems simple enough to me.</li>
    <li> I was flipping though the Popular Science (PopSci) list of \\&quot;Best New Gadgets\\&quot; for Christmas 2010 in November, and I came across a listing for these.  At the time I though...  \\&quot;A Toothbrush?!?\\&quot;.  Everything else was electronic... and this was simply listed for the materials used in its design.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I couldn&#x27;t find any of these at a local retailer, I bought them at Amazon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a great tooth brush.  I&#x27;ve been using this brand and model for 6 months now, and I am seeing the gradual improvement in whiteness (from normal brushing without any other heroic measures) that the article mentioned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Positives?  Good angle. Easy on my gums.  Slowly removes stains over time with no major changes in tooth paste or routine.  Wears well. Using 2-3 times a day, holds up well for 2-3 months without bristles bending in odd directions.  (I could probably use it longer, but I just switch out my tooth brushes that often). \&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Negatives?  Hard to find outside of Amazon.com.  (or at least it was when I first started buying this model).</li>
    <li> We purchased these brushes because they are less expensive than most of the other options on subscribe and save. They get your teeth clean. I can&#x27;t say that I have noticed any whitening. The bristles aren&#x27;t very soft either.</li>
    <li> This was very well made, and felt good on the teeth, and it was very well priced.  Will probably order again.</li>
    <li> this is the best toothbrush i&#x27;ve ever used. i am not sure about the whitening part, but it&#x27;s definitely comfortable and very easy to brush with. highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Reach Total Care Plus Whitening toothbrushes for about a year now and have been pleased with them. The \\&quot;Plus Whitening\\&quot; part is a total gimmick in my opinion; I&#x27;ve seen no effect that I couldn&#x27;t attribute to regular cleaning and using a whitening toothpaste. That being said, it&#x27;s one of the better manual brushes out there. Bristles are comfortable and fan out in a way that covers my teeth well and even has a little massaging action. Reach&#x27;s famous angled head helps greatly when brushing my back molars, and the rubbery texture of the brush provides superior grip, even when my hands are wet. I&#x27;ll keep buying them as long as Reach keeps making them!</li>
    <li> These we very cheaply made. I guess you get what you pay for. I didn&#x27;t like the bristles or the handle.</li>
    <li> Very nice, as advertised.  Why do I have to type 16 words ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?</li>
    <li> Reach Total Care Plus Whitening Toothbrush is really good, I have always use a Reach toothbrush and I  love that they keep making different  kinds. I buy nothing but a Reach.</li>
    <li> Not sure how much more I can say about it.  The angle of the neck is definitely efficient in reaching the back teeth.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this toothbrush for a few days now and I can say this is a pretty good toothbrush. I feel like it actually cleans my teeth, but the one gripe I have is that switching from my old toothbrush to this one is that it lacks a tongue cleaner on the non-bristle side. So far I haven&#x27;t noticed any whitening affects, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;ll be too noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a big fan of Reach toothbrushes.</li>
    <li> The Reach name is for a reason. These soft bristles feel great for a hard brusher like myself. I like the design and the size of the head too (twss).</li>
    <li> It is a tooth brush and does the job it is supposed too.  I would recommend to anyone who needs a new brush</li>
    <li> Отличные зубные щетки, сделаны в Германии. Хорошо чистят зубы, массируют десны. Очень удобная ручка. Буду заказывать еще. Рекомендую всем покупателям.</li>
    <li> Easy grip. Decent sized head. Has lasted me three months at least. I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s whitened my teeth, but the ergonomics of it, makes it my fav. My go-to toothbrush from now on. :o)</li>
    <li> I find that these toothbrushes are particularly helpful in making my teeth feel extra clean.  I went by the reviews and I have ordered them two more times since then.  My teeth feel without a film on them and the bristles are not too abrasive, though my dental hygienist said to always use soft so that&#x27;s what I have used.  I highly recommend these.</li>
    <li> I USE IT WHEN I AM IN A HURRY BUT NOTHING IS BETTER THEN MY WATE PIX AND ELECTRIC TOOTHBRUSH BUT WHEN IN A HURRY OR ON THE RUN IT DOES THE JOB</li>
    <li> Great toothbrush. Gets my teeth clean, feels nice on my teeth and gums. The brush head feels like it has lots of bristles, the pattern of the bristles feels like it covers my teeth well and my teeth feel very clean after brushing. The hole where the thumb rest is doesn&#x27;t bother me like some other reviewers have said, I have had no issues with it.</li>
    <li> This has become a family favorite, sometimes even preferred over the electronic brushes because the reach to the back molars is easy!  I like their ease of use and the cleanliness factor under control!</li>
    <li> What a unique design! I bought this while searching for the best toothbrush on Amazon. I&#x27;m not sure if this is it, but it sure was highly ranked. I think it&#x27;s overhyped, but it IS a pretty cool toothbrush. It feels very &amp;#34;solid&amp;#34; in my hand and has a much more hard plastic feeling than a typical Reach / Oral-B toothbrush (which are covered in grippy material). It doesn&#x27;t seem to have a tongue scraper. I like the promise of teeth whitening, but 1 month in, have not observed obvious results. Perhaps I should tone down the coffee intake. :) Recommend!</li>
    <li> I like this toothbrush because it is very soft, and cleans well. I have not seen the whitening effects of it since I used whitening mouthwash at the same time, but I would buy it again anytime.</li>
