    <li> I had a serious nosebleed that landed me in Urgent Care at my clinic.  I had a package of NasalCease at home and thought it would be a good time to try it.  I went through all five packets in about 10 minutes.  They had no impact at all.  (Try QR for nosebleeds instead).</li>
    <li> I have fought nose bleeds most of my life. I have semi-annual or more often trips to the ENT specialist for help. These are the best and most easy to use method of stopping a nose bleed. I carry one in my wallet and a couple in the car. Usually one will stop a fairly small episode and I have used two on occasion when the bleeding is more profuse. The only problem is finding them other than online. Most drug stores seem to not carry them or don&#x27;t even know about them. I almost forgot to mention that when inserted there is some air that can still pass through which helps to cause the clotting and also is more comfortable than a complete plug in the nostril.</li>
    <li> It will stop more severe nose bleeds that you cannot stop just by applying pressure to the nose or if in public places where you would mind having your kid bleed all over the place. It is an alternative to cold packs if they are not handy.</li>
    <li> This product was totally useless for me.  Perhaps for a minor nosebleed it would be more effective but it is hard to see how.</li>
    <li> Great product. Stops nose bleeds immediately. I know because I have get some really nasty ones in the winter. Has other useful applications. I accidentally lopped off the tip of my finger and the only thing that stopped the bleeding was to tape one of the Hasalcease to the wound. Who would of thought ;-D</li>
    <li> NasalCease is very effective in stopping nose bleeds.  It is easy to insert, works quickly, and is better than other similar products.</li>
    <li> They work extremely well and were recommended by my ENT specialist. I am prone to some bad nose bleeds and this product put a stop to the bleeding immediately.</li>
    <li> great for stopping nosr bleeds better than any other product i had tried in the market place for this type of problem</li>
    <li> havent had a need to evaluate them as yet,</li>
    <li> My husband suffers from frequent nose bleeds and this is the only thing that has repeatedly worked to stop them.</li>
    <li> my husband uses these and the drug store doesn&#x27;t carry them.  they are great for someone with frequent nose bleeds.</li>
    <li> Works faster than other methods I&#x27;ve tried. Easily removed after bleeding stops. I recommend these in every first aid kit.</li>
    <li> Have seasonal nose needs due to allergies and Nasacease works great!</li>
    <li> My husband is on blood thinners and gets frequent nose bleeds, this stops them each time. Before I found these: he had a nose bleed that lasted over 6 hours before he would go to the emergency room. These are much cheaper and easier than a hospital visit. Less embarrassing too!</li>
    <li> Great product and we can&#x27;t find it in any local drugstores.</li>
    <li> My husband gets frequent nose bleeds and these are a god send.  He keeps them in his car, at work, at home, everywhere!  These are especially good when traveling and spending time in dry environments like planes and hotels.  They each come in their own package, like a band-aid.</li>
    <li> The product has reduced in size which creates gaps when placed in nasal passage</li>
    <li> Great service and looks like a good product.</li>
    <li> Maybe my nosebleeds are exceptionally heavy, but my nose bled right through these. I&#x27;ll stick with toilet paper or paper towels!</li>
