### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>It is the best for my skin.</li>
      <li>My therapists recommended Cica-care to me and said it was the best on the market.  </li>
      <li>Great product!  </li>
      <li>Very good service from the shipper but</li>
      <li>Great for reducing the appearance and thickness of scars.  </li>
      <li>Used to be a great product but it has changed.  </li>
      <li>and yet it did an amazing job to reduce my breast surgery scar!</li>
      <li>This is amazing!</li>
      <li>GOOD SERVICE.</li>
      <li>I am very pleased with the Cica-Care silicone patch.</li>
      <li>this by far is the best!  </li>
      <li>This site has a fair price and quick shipping.</li>
      <li>Easy to fall off but feels good, scars did gone light a lot</li>
      <li>Glad I listened.  </li>
      <li>The longer and more often you keep them on, the better your scar will heal.  </li>
      <li>i love this.</li>
      <li>So far so good!</li>
      <li>It is washable and reusable (follow instructions included with product), and you can cut it to fit, so you may be able to get more than one bandage out of each sheet (depending on the size / location of your scar).  </li>
      <li>It can be cut to any size to fit your need and it us very comfortable to wear at night .</li>
      <li>I think it will take the full 3 months</li>
      <li>The silicon sheet is very think in places and when I cut them to fit the keloid scar they often tear.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s worth the money, to me.  </li>
      <li>Fast shipping and good quality, low price.</li>
      <li>I had a keloid scar from my first c-section.</li>
      <li>I think my scar looks better than it did prior to my first c-section.</li>
      <li>Really help with itching and helped flatten out my large abdominal scar!</li>
      <li>Package showed up later but I finally received it and very satisfied.</li>
      <li>The hospital gave it to me to improve certain areas of my burn injury, and it seems to soften the skin or even flatten the grafted area.  </li>
      <li>Wife loves it it really works</li>
      <li>It really did help reduce the size and color of the scar, although it is still quite visible.  </li>
      <li>This is the real deal.</li>
      <li>So far I have seen no change in the skin texture.  </li>
      <li>Perhaps my results would have been better if I had started using the Cica-Care product immediately after the procedure which caused the scar, but alas, I was unaware of the product until much</li>
      <li>More importantly, it was thick and hard, and since it&#x27;s on my elbow, it made it uncomfortable to lean on my arm until I used this, then it calmed down and is much more like a normal part of my skin now.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend this product over creams, gels, or other patches.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;While it is self-adhesive, it can come loose with moderate motion, so depending on its location, you may prefer to use a secondary wrap to secure it.  </li>

    <li> does not stick well and saw little results. i have to use tape to hold it on</li>
    <li> Easy to fall off but feels good, scars did gone light a lot</li>
    <li> Wife loves it it really works</li>
    <li> Great for reducing the appearance and thickness of scars.  Used this with my OT (wore it overnight for weeks) and it brought the angry raised scar down into something much less noticeable.  More importantly, it was thick and hard, and since it&#x27;s on my elbow, it made it uncomfortable to lean on my arm until I used this, then it calmed down and is much more like a normal part of my skin now.</li>
    <li> Unsatisfied.  The order came with a different packaging, made in China. Need a very long process to refund it.</li>
    <li> i am still using it on my skin graft where I was burned.  So far I have seen no change in the skin texture.  I have been using for one month now..</li>
    <li> Very good service from the shipper but the product promoted a grang green smelling infection.  This product was used under the supervision of a veterinary.  I would not recommend Cica Care to anyone.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve recommended this to all of my c-section friends. This is the real deal. I have already healed after 10 weeks postpartum. I think my scar looks better than it did prior to my first c-section.</li>
    <li> Used to be a great product but it has changed.  The silicon sheet is very think in places and when I cut them to fit the keloid scar they often tear.  So a lot gets wasted.  I still need them unfortunately, but this product has become not so trustworthy.</li>
    <li> Really help with itching and helped flatten out my large abdominal scar!</li>
    <li> My surgeon recommended this and I have been using it for about three weeks and my scars from extensive foot surgery looks like a healing scratch.  The redness is even gone from my previous scars and you can hardly see it.now.  I have used other products and this by far is the best!  Yes it&#x27;s expensive but worth it and lasts quite a while.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t  know if this works or not but my surgeon said it was the only thing she would recommend after mohs surgery. It can be cut to any size to fit your need and it us very comfortable to wear at night . However it didn&#x27;t cone with any direction on how to yes at all. If the doctor had not told me I wouldn&#x27;t have known that it can be used over n over</li>
    <li> Probably the only scar minimized that works! Have tried numerous products. This one is the only one that fades and evens out keloids.</li>
    <li> it doesn&#x27;t seem to do anything.  I received them on a Wednesday and wore them 24 hours for 4 days.  it actually made my scar sore.  it like ., its just gel tape.  I am not sure if they have any medicine in them at all.  (I mean it says you can wash them)  $40. for tape .,  I could of bought duck tape.</li>
    <li> Used it for my recent scars from my car accident.  I  had 40+ staples removed and the scars were really deep.  Wish I could attach before and after photos to show the difference.  I can notice changes just after one night of wearing them.  The longer and more often you keep them on, the better your scar will heal.  Highly recommend this product over creams, gels, or other patches.  My therapists recommended Cica-care to me and said it was the best on the market.  Glad I listened.  So far so good!</li>
    <li> I am a Certified Hand Therapist and have used this for years for scar remodeling- it will help flatten/soften any scar when used properly. This site has a fair price and quick shipping.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping and good quality, low price.</li>
    <li> After being left with an ugly 2.5\\&quot; long keloid scar (about the size of my index finger) on the front/inside of my thigh, just above my kneecap, my dermatologist recommended this product.  It really did help reduce the size and color of the scar, although it is still quite visible.  Perhaps my results would have been better if I had started using the Cica-Care product immediately after the procedure which caused the scar, but alas, I was unaware of the product until much later.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While it is self-adhesive, it can come loose with moderate motion, so depending on its location, you may prefer to use a secondary wrap to secure it.  It is washable and reusable (follow instructions included with product), and you can cut it to fit, so you may be able to get more than one bandage out of each sheet (depending on the size / location of your scar).  (To save money, follow grandma&#x27;s advice:  measure twice, cut once!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our dermatologist now sends us home with a &#x27;starter&#x27; sheet after we have had a procedure which is likely to leave a visible scar.</li>
    <li> I had a keloid scar from my first c-section. I had to have another c-section for my second baby and my dr recommended using Cica care 4 weeks after surgery. At 6 weeks he also gave me cortisone shots in the scar, which had already started to keloid. The shots worked a little bit. But the scar didn&#x27;t flatten out and it was still itchy. I&#x27;ve been using the strips for almost 11 months now and half of my scar has flattened out. It&#x27;s taking longer than I thought, but this is so much better than having an itchy and painful keloid. Also, when I wear the strip, the scar doesn&#x27;t feel itchy. I can get about 6 months use from this pack.</li>
    <li> This is amazing! A plastic surgeon told me to get this. He said it would take 2-3 mos to resolve the scar. I noticed a difference after 3 days. I think it will take the full 3 months but I could not be happier!</li>
    <li> The hospital gave it to me to improve certain areas of my burn injury, and it seems to soften the skin or even flatten the grafted area.  It&#x27;s apparently not for all areas.  It&#x27;s worth the money, to me.  Reusable &amp; seems to last longer than the manufacturer says.</li>
    <li> Too expensive. For the amount of time and effort involved in using it, it is not worth it.</li>
    <li> This product is so simple and yet it did an amazing job to reduce my breast surgery scar! My doctor at the breast center was amazed and is passing on the name of this product to all of her patients. I am very pleased with the Cica-Care silicone patch.</li>
    <li> It is the best for my skin.</li>
    <li> i love this. i will buy this again. S2</li>
    <li> Great product!  It was delivered on time.  I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> Package showed up later but I finally received it and very satisfied. GOOD SERVICE.</li>
