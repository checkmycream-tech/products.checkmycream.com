    <li> I&#x27;ve used this mascara for a few years and it arrived absolutely dried.  I don&#x27;t know if I got a bad batch or what.  Very unhappy.  Otherwise this mascara used to be really great.</li>
    <li> This is the second time I have purchased this mascara and I really like it.  I really hate wearing mascara and this product makes me feel like I&#x27;m not wearing any mascara at all.  No clumping and I never have mascara smudge.  It&#x27;s also easy to remove.  I use Acne.org&#x27;s jojoba oil to remove all of my make-up including this mascara and it works great and great for your skin and eyelashes.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> While I do like the &amp;#34;tubular&amp;#34;, easy-to-remove qualities, this mascara has no volumizing features. For a redhead with delicate lashes, it barely registers. So if you like the super natural makeup look, this is the macara for you. Otherwise, you may want to go darker or another brand of cruelty-free cosmetic.</li>
    <li> This particular tube seemed to be old.  It was not as fluid as others I have purchased from Sephora or other retailers.</li>
    <li> Hate the brush- not great at applying</li>
    <li> Very disappointing. Dry and crumbly condition... almost like it&#x27;s old.  Unusable.  I don&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
    <li> Terrible, arrived and mascara was dried out! I couldn&#x27;t even use it once. What a rip off.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite mascara, and it&#x27;s getting difficult to find it in Espresso. Glad to have it.</li>
    <li> Use for years.  Great product.</li>
    <li> I love this mascara. It looks very natural, no clumps. It lives up to its name, &amp;#34;flawless definition.&amp;#34; HOWEVER, it only lasted about 5 applications before it was so dry that it was unusable. I was hesitant to buy it because at $18, it is high-priced for me. I felt I got ripped off with it drying up so quickly. Maybe it was nearing an expiration date or something? That&#x27;s not something you can check when buying it from Amazon though.</li>
    <li> Pretty good product.  Light weight and I like the brown shade.  The brush is great!  The mascara itself isn&#x27;t bad, but it can &amp;#34;flake&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;shed&amp;#34; a bit if you accidentally touch your eyes at one point in the day which is frustrating.  No irritation from the product itself, and seeing as I have allergies to a ton of scents, products, etc. that is a great thing.</li>
    <li> Great product- applies easily and is light and natural looking</li>
    <li> Outstanding. Came very quickly well packed n very good price.</li>
    <li> I normally love this mascara, but the one received is either empty or dried up...:(</li>
    <li> Clumps and flakes off!!! I could not wait to get home and wash my face. I have never had mascara flake off so much!!! Terrible!!</li>
    <li> Color good.  Used water on brush to apply.  I used it once a day. I generally find mascara to be irritating but this was far far less bothersome.</li>
    <li> This is terrific everyday mascara. It defines the lashes, to give them color on a minimal makeup day. You will NOT get volume or length out of this mascara. The coverage is light and holds up to an 18 hour workday, and the brush is good for coverage from base to tip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my go-to daily mascara, and I love it&#x27;s simplicity and reliability, and stands up well with my higher-end cosmetics. Well worth the purchase!</li>
    <li> Best mascara I&#x27;ve found - especially like the brush design</li>
    <li> As a redhead I don&#x27;t feel comfortable in black mascara so I love that this comes in a brown color.  It&#x27;s still fairly dark, but that&#x27;s the point of mascara with eyelashes as light as mine!</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t care for the wand and the espresso is too dark, it&#x27;s basically black, I was looking for a brown.</li>
    <li> I really like this mascara. It helps my lashes took fuller and longer.  The applicator is the best part. It keeps lashes separated with no clumping.</li>
