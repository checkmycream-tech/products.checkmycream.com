### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Its been 2 weeks now, and the skin on my neck is flawless!  </li>
      <li>Excellent shaver.</li>
      <li>I have 8 years using it, is magnificent.</li>
      <li>it starts tasting delicious, adhere!&lt;br</li>
      <li>/&gt;They are the best I&#x27;ve ever used;&lt;br /&gt;My</li>
      <li>Awesome.</li>
      <li>These work well and are a great price!</li>
      <li>them in good health!</li>
      <li>\\&quot;Great</li>
      <li>The sensation is great, as stated before, no hair pulling like the 3+ razor blades that i used to use.  </li>
      <li>I can take a personna razor and get a perfect shave very quickly without injuries every time with either one day of hair growth or a week&#x27;s worth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Good luck.</li>
      <li>Noxzema is good, but it&#x27;s not meant to drink&lt;br /&gt;Although SOMEtimes some enters the mouth, not the sink--but&lt;br /&gt;Before</li>
      <li>Well those days surely have passed!  </li>
      <li>/&gt;&#x27;Cause a new blade shaves best.</li>
      <li>and I still get a good shave just as easily.</li>
      <li>So glad to be able to order online!</li>
      <li>Best razor ever for sensitive skin</li>
      <li>A terrific source for what say are still the best disposable baldes.</li>
      <li>I said, MZ Photo sent me these 15 razors promptly - more than the order was meant to be.  </li>
      <li>Never use a razor more than twice.&lt;br /&gt;3</li>
      <li>The BIC Sensitive Shaver shaves smooth, close and no pulling or dragging (I can go for a day without shaving and still get excellent results).  </li>
      <li>MZ Photo noticed the misprint and \\&quot;did good\\&quot; by me by sending me more razors than they had to.  </li>
      <li>At that point, I was totally satisfied with the order itself (and MZ Photo&#x27;s prompt service).  </li>
      <li>I bought in bulk - - shouldn&#x27;t have to buy more for YEARS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>MZ Photo noticed the misprint and \\&quot;did good\\&quot; by me by sending me more razors than they had to.  </li>
      <li>So I have been experimenting with as many shavers as I can.</li>
      <li>These inexpensive razors are probably the best you can buy when you consider rock bottom price and overall  function.</li>
      <li>I sure wouldn&#x27;t want to try to get a refund from another vendor.&lt;br</li>
      <li>(Pack of 12)]]I have been using this item for many years without any problems &amp; have not come across anything that works as well.</li>
      <li>I love these blades.  </li>
      <li>BIC used to be top of the line in razor blade companies.  </li>
      <li>I think these are the best single blade razors out there.</li>
      <li>The Bic unclogs easily with a swish in water.</li>
      <li>Much better than multiblade razors which will clog with stubble quickly and  </li>
      <li>(3 free razors).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I use one every month, (30 shaves +) and will never ever switch for anything else, besides they are cheap, and can be found anywere.</li>
      <li>Great buy if you need to get rid of some extra blood!</li>
      <li>skin!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shaving razors are cheap to buy (about 19 cents per razor at the price of $28.60 for 12 packs of twelve razors each) and you can use them about three times before you have to discard them.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Follow the five and enjoy the champagne lifestyle on a lemonade budget.</li>
      <li>They give a smooth shave.</li>
      <li>face feels smooth and in no way abused.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>shaving razor works best when you wet your face first and apply shaving cream before using.</li>
      <li>I originally came to this page to buy the product, it was $7.95, MZ Photo was the merchant, and this was the listing shown:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve requested a full refund of $33.54 to the original payment method used on the order.</li>
      <li>I bought these at a store after reading the multiple good reviews on Amazon.  </li>
      <li>It also takes a lot more passes with the razor to remove the hair, which actually irritates my skin more than a two blade razor.  </li>
      <li>These are very mild razors only work best with little stubble.&lt;br /&gt;2)</li>
      <li>I just don&#x27;t think the money saved is worth the cuts and discomfort.</li>
      <li>These really do the trick; and they work even better with shaving cream specially designed for sensitive</li>
      <li>The price is right.  </li>
      <li>Bic makes great single blade razors for gentlemen who want a close shave despite the fact that they have sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>These are super mild razors nothing will change that live with the result put ANY pressure or rush it at all you will get cut.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall, these inexpensive, easy to carry razors by Bic give guys a great alternative to regular shaving blades when they have sensitive facial skin</li>
      <li>/&gt;That gives the impression to the buyer that they will receive more than that actually do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please either send me the rest of the razors or change your listing to reflect what the buyer truly receives.</li>
      <li>Since these were cheap and for sensitive skin, I went ahead and bought them.</li>
      <li>Shaving varies from one individual to another, so what works for me might not work for somebody else; but I am glad Bic makes these as an alternative to high-priced blades.</li>
      <li>but you have to follow a certain set of rules.</li>
      <li>I think the whole thing could easily be solved by titling this product \\&quot;12 packages with 12 razors in each package\\&quot;, and teaching the warehouse people how to read and do simple math.</li>
      <li>/&gt;*I was using a straight razor at the time.</li>
      <li>I have struggled with razor burn/bumps my whole shaving life.  </li>
      <li>I have given them far too many chances: shaving at every pressure and angle and direction combination possibly known to man, even going to the extent of pulling my face taut as if I were using an old-fashioned strait razor, and I either end up with not a close shave at all or cuts and razor burn all over.</li>
      <li>The first time you use a new razor blade, however, you must \\&quot;go gentle\\&quot; or even this blade will rip your skin to shreds.</li>
      <li>Many people think that only because its single bladed, its not as effective, but you get a closer shave, and just putting it in the water, it cleans immediately, unlike the other twin to 5 blades, hair gets stuck.    </li>
      <li>The shaving rashes are certainly not worse, and in fact I think they are a little better.</li>
      <li>The main problem is that these do not seem to cut as close to the skin.  </li>
      <li>Lastly, the blade does not last as many shaves as my normal disposable razor.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;ve used Gillette Sensor Excel to shave my face for years but am put off by the high cost of the razors (about a $1 each).</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t really know if they&#x27;re going to clear this up at this point</li>
      <li>I really don&#x27;t get how they are supposed to be for sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>I gave these to my dad and I will be buying my normal, multi-blade razors.</li>
      <li>I have not been able to find them for a very long time and boom, back again.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Apparently the right hand doesn&#x27;t have a clue as to what the left hand is doing at Amazon.</li>
      <li>Won&#x27;t have to go out and buy any new ones for years now.</li>
      <li>My skin seems to be very sensitive, I have problems with irritation, razor burn, ingrown hairs, razor bumps.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this for men who have sensitive skin.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Trust me--this has happened to me countless times when I was a bit too \\&quot;enthusiastic\\&quot; and shaved too close the first time I used a new razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I highly recommend never picking up a BIC razor unless I&#x27;m the only unfortunate consumer who continues buying the lousy varieties, but I have a strong feeling based on the numerous people reviewing and complaining about this product here on amazon that&#x27;s not the case at all, and BIC is simply no longer at the spectacular level of good clean shaving they used to be.  </li>
      <li>Evidently there is currently something about the number \\&quot;144\\&quot; in the product description that they don&#x27;t understand.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Pack of 12) had the same problem as your first order.</li>
      <li>Do not waste your time buying these!</li>
      <li>However, I figured, \\&quot;Surely this has happened often enough and long enough ago that they&#x27;ve got the bugs out of the system by now.\\&quot;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Single shipping box, all razor packs simply dropped inside, but no damage and prompt UPS, free delivery.</li>
      <li>The best razor for the money are the grey personna razors you get at dollar tree, 10 for $1 which have two blades and work extremely well and can last between 10-20 shaves, depending on how thick your beard is.</li>
      <li>\\&quot;Sensitive</li>
      <li>Straight razors are also called \\&quot;open</li>
      <li>No shaving action whatsoever.</li>
      <li>Seem like too much spend the extra on schick hydro 5 and hack</li>
      <li>I buy schick sensitive for like 3 bucks and lasts me longer than the pack of razors so just spend the extra.&lt;br /&gt;4)</li>
      <li>/&gt;Whether you have sensitive skin or not&lt;br /&gt;You</li>
      <li>They work as well as they did and do as good a job as the expensive razors.  </li>
      <li>Even so, I thought I&#x27;d have some fun with MZ - sending them a query to ask if the other 129 razors were coming under a separate cover.  </li>
      <li>Not a single new razor bump since I started the using the bic disposables.  </li>
      <li>No matter how much shave gel I used or how much or how little pressure I applied to the razor, I managed to cut myself every time.</li>
      <li>So I bought a huge box of these which I am still slowly working my way through.</li>
      <li>I only received 12 razors, the listing clearly says, \\&quot;12-Count</li>
      <li>had leaned up against it to see who was near;&lt;br /&gt;The moral, young man, is don&#x27;t shave with a beer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>the moral, young man: DO NOT SHAVE WITH A BEER.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Be light and slow.</li>
      <li>Something is seriously wrong if a no-name company can outperform a popular company like BIC.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> A terrific source for what say are still the best disposable baldes.</li>
    <li> I bought in bulk - - shouldn&#x27;t have to buy more for YEARS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, where did I put my razor?</li>
    <li> THESE ARE THE WORST RAZORS AND VERY DANGEROUS!!!  DO NOT BUY THEM!!!! I HAVE A SCAR AND WENT THRU A LOT OF PAIN...</li>
    <li> My skin seems to be very sensitive, I have problems with irritation, razor burn, ingrown hairs, razor bumps. So I have been experimenting with as many shavers as I can. This one constantly gave me cuts and nicks, it has no glide pad with aloe or vitamin E or anything, it has a horrible angle also. If you don&#x27;t mind a bloody mess, this shaver is for you. I would recommend the Schick double-blade over this one.</li>
    <li> Excellent shaver. Especially for men with ingrown hairs.  I have 8 years using it, is magnificent. ah! Shave only in the sense that leaves hair</li>
    <li> I was trying to save some money by buying disposable razors. Since these were cheap and for sensitive skin, I went ahead and bought them. They are awful. I really don&#x27;t get how they are supposed to be for sensitive skin. I hardly ever cut myself shaving. No matter how much shave gel I used or how much or how little pressure I applied to the razor, I managed to cut myself every time. Also, I noticed that the shave wasn&#x27;t as close, so I still felt stubble after shaving. I just don&#x27;t think the money saved is worth the cuts and discomfort. I gave these to my dad and I will be buying my normal, multi-blade razors.</li>
    <li> I have struggled with razor burn/bumps my whole shaving life.  Its been 2 weeks now, and the skin on my neck is flawless!  Not a single new razor bump since I started the using the bic disposables.  I love these blades.  The sensation is great, as stated before, no hair pulling like the 3+ razor blades that i used to use.  I actually don&#x27;t dread shaving anymore.  Try these if you have problems with burn/bumps, you won&#x27;t regret it.</li>
    <li> ABSOLUTELY no better shaver on the market, electric or otherwise.  I have used them all (single blade, double blade, triple blade, electric, etc.,etc.) and I always come back to this one.  The BIC Sensitive Shaver shaves smooth, close and no pulling or dragging (I can go for a day without shaving and still get excellent results).  The price is right.  Once in awhile I can find a 5 pack for a dollar and kick my self when I don&#x27;t stock up.</li>
    <li> This razor is the 9th wonder of the world, I&#x27;ve tried ALL BRANDS, even the m3 or shick crap, and its not worth it.  Many people think that only because its single bladed, its not as effective, but you get a closer shave, and just putting it in the water, it cleans immediately, unlike the other twin to 5 blades, hair gets stuck.    I use one every month, (30 shaves +) and will never ever switch for anything else, besides they are cheap, and can be found anywere.</li>
    <li> So glad to be able to order online! I don&#x27;t understand why there is this focus on multiple blades for razors - they need to keep it simple.</li>
    <li> These inexpensive razors are probably the best you can buy when you consider rock bottom price and overall  function. They give a smooth shave. Much better than multiblade razors which will clog with stubble quickly and  \\&quot;drag\\&quot; across your face and are hard to unclog. The Bic unclogs easily with a swish in water. The only downside to  this razor is its size makes it hard to get into your nostril area whereas the thin double blade razors do a better  job in this regard. If you have a tough stubble, life is about five shaves if you are concerned about comfort.</li>
    <li> I ordered 12 packs of 12 razors.  I only received 1 package of 12 razors.  I contacted Amazon and the seller.  I have not received a credit nor additional razors.  So, in essence, I paid $33.00 for a $3.00 pack of razors.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B00070QF0C BIC Single Blade Razor, Sensitive, 12-Count (Pack of 12)]]I have been using this item for many years without any problems &amp; have not come across anything that works as well.</li>
    <li> Ordered 12 packages of 12 razors per pack. Received 14 packages of only 10 razors per pack, and a single pack of 5 razors for a total of 145 razors. Seller was MZ Photo. Single shipping box, all razor packs simply dropped inside, but no damage and prompt UPS, free delivery. Having read other reviews I see some folks like this razor, others hate it. Obviously discrepancies still exist between stated 144, and what people actually receive. Personally, I like these razors, use one razor three times but clean and dry it after each use and make sure beard has been moist for at least 2 minutes, usually shave after a shower, and use canned shaving cream. No problems with nicks or cuts. Good luck.</li>
    <li> I ordered this bulk purchase of razors (144 razors) and then received only a single package of 12 razors.  I asked Amazon to investigate, but buyer beware. You will not get what is advertised for this item, and Amazon will blame you rather than the buyer. Somehow they let this scam stay up on their website.</li>
    <li> This is a split review.  The Amazon Marketplace merchant who fulfilled this order gets 5 stars.  Amazon.com gets MINUS-ONE stars.  Hence, my average of 2 stars.  Here&#x27;s my rationale.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I originally came to this page to buy the product, it was $7.95, MZ Photo was the merchant, and this was the listing shown:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bic Single Blade Shaver, Sensitive, 12 Count (Pack of 12)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;MZ Photo promptly sent me 5 Count (Pack of 3).  Now, I knew the price was so low that it had to have been a misprint.  Even so, I thought I&#x27;d have some fun with MZ - sending them a query to ask if the other 129 razors were coming under a separate cover.  After all, a \\&quot;pack of 12\\&quot; twelve-count of razors is 144 razors.  They replied that it was a misprint - that the page meant to reflect only ONE pack of 12-count (just 12 razors) but that they sent me 15 (3 free razors).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I said, MZ Photo sent me these 15 razors promptly - more than the order was meant to be.  At that point, I was totally satisfied with the order itself (and MZ Photo&#x27;s prompt service).  However, I finally sent a separate email to Amazon - asking them to fix the page to remove the erroneous and misleading description of the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazon&#x27;s reaction?  They sent me a refund.  I did NOT want a refund.  I merely wanted them to instruct their webmaster to FIX THE PAGE - to remove the erroneous and misleading info on it.  They removed part of it (the item&#x27;s basic description line at page-top).  But they left two other incorrect parts.  Scroll up this page to see what I mean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1)  Next to the price in parentheses is the \\&quot;per unit\\&quot; price.  Take that per-unit price and multiply it by 144.  You&#x27;ll see that it STILL reflects erroneous/misleading info.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2)  Further down on the page, you&#x27;ll notice four \\&quot;product features\\&quot; listed one per line:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Feature 1 -- \\&quot;Single Blade\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;Feature 2 -- \\&quot;Sensitive Skin Shaver\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;Feature 3 -- \\&quot;Great Value\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;...and (ahem)...&lt;br /&gt;Feature 4 -- \\&quot;Total of 144 razors\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still, after all this time, they REFUSE to remove the erroneous/misleading info - leading customers to believe they should expect 144 razors in the mail.  If Amazon did inform the webmaster of these errors, it makes me wonder if the webmaster:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) is universally stupid, or...&lt;br /&gt;2) is universally lazy, or...&lt;br /&gt;3) graduated from correspondence school on webmastering&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amazon.com&#x27;s REFUSAL to fix this page and remove erroneous/misleading data reflects poorly not only on them but on the marketplace sellers indirectly (and unfairly).  MZ Photo noticed the misprint and \\&quot;did good\\&quot; by me by sending me more razors than they had to.  And even though MZ Photo and I both contacted Amazon.com to tell them of this error, they just don&#x27;t get it!  For crying out loud.br /&gt;Feature 4 -- \\&quot;Total of 144 razors\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still, after all this time, they REFUSE to remove the erroneous/misleading info - leading customers to believe they should expect 144 razors in the mail.

    <li> BIC used to be top of the line in razor blade companies.  I remember in the day when they were the only company on store shelves.  Well those days surely have passed!  These razors cost me 10 dollars because I actually thought they&#x27;d last a few weeks.  I could only shave 3 times and they were so dull by the 3rd attempt, it literally took me 15 minutes to shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No kidding, these blue-handle razor blades I buy at the Dollar Store typically last me 4-6 months before they get dull.  Something is seriously wrong if a no-name company can outperform a popular company like BIC.  I highly recommend never picking up a BIC razor unless I&#x27;m the only unfortunate consumer who continues buying the lousy varieties, but I have a strong feeling based on the numerous people reviewing and complaining about this product here on amazon that&#x27;s not the case at all, and BIC is simply no longer at the spectacular level of good clean shaving they used to be.  What a shame.</li>
    <li> Bic makes great single blade razors for gentlemen who want a close shave despite the fact that they have sensitive skin. These really do the trick; and they work even better with shaving cream specially designed for sensitive skin!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shaving razors are cheap to buy (about 19 cents per razor at the price of $28.60 for 12 packs of twelve razors each) and you can use them about three times before you have to discard them. The first time you use a new razor blade, however, you must \\&quot;go gentle\\&quot; or even this blade will rip your skin to shreds. Trust me--this has happened to me countless times when I was a bit too \\&quot;enthusiastic\\&quot; and shaved too close the first time I used a new razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shaving razor works best when you wet your face first and apply shaving cream before using. I suppose, of course, that these razors could be used to shave body hair as well. I am not sure if women could use these razors--sorry about that!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, these inexpensive, easy to carry razors by Bic give guys a great alternative to regular shaving blades when they have sensitive facial skin and they must shave anyway. I highly recommend this for men who have sensitive skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Use them in good health!</li>
    <li> I only received 12 razors, the listing clearly says, \\&quot;12-Count (Pack of 12)\\&quot; \\&quot;($0.02 / razor)\\&quot; And, \\&quot;Total of 144 razors\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That gives the impression to the buyer that they will receive more than that actually do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please either send me the rest of the razors or change your listing to reflect what the buyer truly receives.</li>
    <li> You order 144 razors for $30.00 (or whatever the price), and they send you a bag of 12.  They say it&#x27;s 21 cents a razor and it&#x27;s actually over 2 dollars per razor.  What you think you&#x27;re buying is a bag containing 12 packages each containing 12 razors, but that&#x27;s not what you get.  Apparently, this has been going on for a very long time now, though I bought a large quantity of these things with no problems last year.  I think the whole thing could easily be solved by titling this product \\&quot;12 packages with 12 razors in each package\\&quot;, and teaching the warehouse people how to read and do simple math. Evidently there is currently something about the number \\&quot;144\\&quot; in the product description that they don&#x27;t understand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t think that you can go to another, non Amazon, vendor either.  Some of them, at least, will also send you 12 razors for some outlandish price when you are clearly ordering 144 per unit.  I checked with some other companies after this happened.  I sure wouldn&#x27;t want to try to get a refund from another vendor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE several days later.  I had ordered a number of this item for my brother who has a skin condition and requires a bag of 12 a day. As I only received bags of 12 for what was advertised as a quantity of 144 (described above), I returned all the bags, per amazon.  Then, get this: I was only refunded for 1 unit or one bag instead of all of the units for which I had been erroneously charged - a $30.00 refund instead of several hundred.  I don&#x27;t really know if they&#x27;re going to clear this up at this point and I&#x27;m really mad about it.  I won&#x27;t believe it until I see it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Apparently the right hand doesn&#x27;t have a clue as to what the left hand is doing at Amazon. You&#x27;d think these marketing geniuses could get this little problem straightened out - seriously.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FINAL UPDATE: They finally did refund all my money, but it took an inordinate amount of my time to fix a major mistake that Amazon created. I was relentlessin contacting them until they got it done. It is difficult to communicate with them by phone, but possible. The first two people in refunds did a partial, sloppy job with no follow through; they were the typical, tell-them-anything, get-it-off-my-back, somebody-else-will-get-the-return-call types. The third and fourth people, however, took responsibility, followed through, and got it done.  In the end, they finished the refund which apparently was quite complex (why?); but my God, what a stressful hassle, and I DIDN&#x27;T EVEN GET THE RAZORS in the end.  Very unhappy camper, returning to WalMart I suppose.</li>
    <li> Single blade, one stroke with the grain - close shave ... and it&#x27;s not some overpriced gimmick.  I use one per month without any problems.  Shaving varies from one individual to another, so what works for me might not work for somebody else; but I am glad Bic makes these as an alternative to high-priced blades.</li>

    <li> [[ASIN:B000TUMLA8 Noxzema Noxzema Medicated Shave Cream]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whether you have sensitive skin or not&lt;br /&gt;You might want to give these Bic blades a shot.&lt;br /&gt;They are the best I&#x27;ve ever used;&lt;br /&gt;My face feels smooth and in no way abused.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They seem to be wider than other blades.&lt;br /&gt;As for Schick and Gillette, they just don&#x27;t make the grade.&lt;br /&gt;I use the blade once then it goes in the trash&lt;br /&gt;&#x27;Cause a new blade shaves best. Hey, I don&#x27;t sweat the cash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, I&#x27;m not a scientist, chemist or such&lt;br /&gt;So my take on Noxzema won&#x27;t count for that much,&lt;br /&gt;But I know what I like and I like what I use--&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using Noxzema Shave since &#x27;92.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just one small suggestion: Don&#x27;t shave with a beer.&lt;br /&gt;I know it sounds crazy, \\&quot;Don&#x27;t shave with a beer,\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;But back in my teens I did shave with a beer.&lt;br /&gt;Ignoring dad&#x27;s warnings I severed my ear--&lt;br /&gt;(Today I use only one headphone to hear)&lt;br /&gt;And fate coined the moral, \\&quot;Don&#x27;t shave with a beer.\\&quot; *&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And yes, I have other examples of that,&lt;br /&gt;Like the time when I slipped in the bathtub--no mat.&lt;br /&gt;My left arm got broke and I busted my rear.&lt;br /&gt;The moral, young man, is don&#x27;t shave with a beer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But these come in 3&#x27;s so I&#x27;ll give you one more--&lt;br /&gt;The time when my shower door fell to the floor.&lt;br /&gt;I had leaned up against it to see who was near;&lt;br /&gt;The moral, young man, is don&#x27;t shave with a beer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And Noxzema is good, but it&#x27;s not meant to drink&lt;br /&gt;Although SOMEtimes some enters the mouth, not the sink--but&lt;br /&gt;Before it starts tasting delicious, adhere!&lt;br /&gt;To the moral, young man: DO NOT SHAVE WITH A BEER.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*I was using a straight razor at the time. Not a Bic. Straight razors are also called \\&quot;open razors\\&quot; or \\&quot;cut-throat\\&quot; razors.</li>
    <li> I used to use a variety of those expensive ones with extra blades and built-in shaving cream etc because I get terrible rashes from shaving my legs. Then a health magazine and a newspaper both ran stories which said that fewer blades are less likely to cause irritation, and that you might as well use a simple disposable. So I bought a huge box of these which I am still slowly working my way through. The shaving rashes are certainly not worse, and in fact I think they are a little better. I see no advantage to the fancy kinds.</li>
    <li> Like another shopper, I also received ONE package of 12 razors which averages $2.57 per razor. Had I received the 12 packs of 12 razors that I was expecting, the cost would have averaged $0.21 as the description states. Totally bummed now that I have to deal with a return and who has the time for that? It&#x27;s why I shop on line to begin with. My husband loves the razors so I guess one of us will pick some up from the local pharmacy.</li>
    <li> I bought these at a store after reading the multiple good reviews on Amazon.  I usually use disposable double blade razors.  I have found that these do not perform as well as the double blade razors I usually use.  The main problem is that these do not seem to cut as close to the skin.  It still looks like I have a day of growth after shaving.  It also takes a lot more passes with the razor to remove the hair, which actually irritates my skin more than a two blade razor.  Lastly, the blade does not last as many shaves as my normal disposable razor.  I have an average amount of facial hair and the blade lasts 2-3 shaves before it feels like it is just scraping my skin.  This razor might work for you as it did with some of the other reviewers, but in my experience, I&#x27;d go with another product.</li>
    <li> My husband and I just want a simple blade with no strip.  These work well and are a great price!</li>
    <li> Once upon a time my thick-hair growing man face and neck were in search of the lowest cost razor that can still get the job done. It was NOT these. The best razor for the money are the grey personna razors you get at dollar tree, 10 for $1 which have two blades and work extremely well and can last between 10-20 shaves, depending on how thick your beard is. I have concluded it is not worth going any cheaper than the personna razors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These bics, on the other hand, are pure garbage. I have given them far too many chances: shaving at every pressure and angle and direction combination possibly known to man, even going to the extent of pulling my face taut as if I were using an old-fashioned strait razor, and I either end up with not a close shave at all or cuts and razor burn all over. So I gave one to my wife to try on her legs she said they irritated her and gave her razor burn every time. I can take a personna razor and get a perfect shave very quickly without injuries every time with either one day of hair growth or a week&#x27;s worth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So if anyone out there knows of some secret way to shave with these, do tell.</li>
    <li> Got these at a CVS store while traveling, after discovering I forgot to pack my regular shaver in. And what a disaster these are! No shaving action whatsoever. After some struggle, I tried pressing it harder against my skin, got a cut and a skin irritation afterward, but it shaved nothing. Nothing at all. Period.  And no, I&#x27;m not a teenager having no experience in shaving myself. After having shaved my face for about half a century with all kinds of shavers, I can honestly state that these ones are absolutely the very worst I&#x27;ve ever seen and used.</li>
    <li> Vendor is reliable delivers product as expected. If you have used these razors before order with confidence and disregard the rest of the review. Curious about the razors themselves? Read on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are all I use now and for less than three bucks a month no professional male should go without these. Best razor ever for sensitive skin but you have to follow a certain set of rules. Seem like too much spend the extra on schick hydro 5 and hack away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) Shave daily. These are very mild razors only work best with little stubble.&lt;br /&gt;2) Never use a razor more than twice.&lt;br /&gt;3) Use name brand cream. I buy schick sensitive for like 3 bucks and lasts me longer than the pack of razors so just spend the extra.&lt;br /&gt;4) Be light and slow. These are super mild razors nothing will change that live with the result put ANY pressure or rush it at all you will get cut. Very hard to do with a razor this light but don&#x27;t forget this rule should have made it number one.&lt;br /&gt;5) Two passes max and never against the grain. Extra or against grain passes won&#x27;t get any closer and will cause irritation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Follow the five and enjoy the champagne lifestyle on a lemonade budget.</li>
    <li> Received order in a timely manner.  However, did not received the product advertised.  The product description said I would receive 12 packages with 12 razors in each package for a total of 144 razors.  What I actually received was 14 packages of 10 razors, for a total of 140 razors.</li>
    <li> Exceeded my expectations</li>
    <li> As advertised. 144 razors. Awesome. I think these are the best single blade razors out there. Each one lasts me several days at least. Won&#x27;t have to go out and buy any new ones for years now. By the way, shaving cream is a racket -- I haven&#x27;t used it for a year and I still get a good shave just as easily.</li>
    <li> This is definitely not as listed!  I received one package of razors.  Listing says 144 razors and all you get is one 12 count package.  Do not waste your time buying these!</li>
    <li> If you like the sight of blood or want to look like the victum of a knife attack these razors may be for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used Gillette Sensor Excel to shave my face for years but am put off by the high cost of the razors (about a $1 each). Since my face, specifically neck, is so sensitive I go thru one of those every few days.Trying to save a little money I purchased these 144 disposable razors figuring I could throw them away after a single use and still come out way ahead. Each time I shave now I have to plan on not leaving the house for an hour or two until all the bleeding stops. Great buy if you need to get rid of some extra blood!</li>
    <li> Had to argue at length with the Amazon rep until he finally read the product copy and admitted that I was correct in expecting 144 razors.</li>
    <li> I noticed other folks had had issues with not getting 144 razors, but twelve.  However, I figured, \\&quot;Surely this has happened often enough and long enough ago that they&#x27;ve got the bugs out of the system by now.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered this, carefully screen capturing the bit with the bullet point \\&quot;Total of 144 razors\\&quot; in case things got silly later on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They mailed me one bag containing twelve razors.  I contacted Amazon Customer Service; they had me RMA the twelve razors back and issued a replacement.  The replacement came: one bag of twelve razors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I contacted Customer Service again; they wrote this:  \\&quot;I&#x27;m sorry to hear the replacement  BIC Single Blade Shaver, Sensitive, 12-Count (Pack of 12) had the same problem as your first order. This usually doesn&#x27;t happen. Since it&#x27;s likely another replacement would arrive incorrect, I won&#x27;t trouble you with another replacement.  I&#x27;ve requested a full refund of $33.54 to the original payment method used on the order. There&#x27;s no need to return the item. You can dispose of it at your convenience.\\&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d have preferred to get 144 razors for $33.54.  On the other hand,  twelve razors for $0.00 is a heck of a deal; three stars for that!  Maybe they can make it up in volume.</li>
    <li> Used these for years.  I have not been able to find them for a very long time and boom, back again.  They work as well as they did and do as good a job as the expensive razors.  I am just sorry to hear that they are, or have been, discontinued.</li>
