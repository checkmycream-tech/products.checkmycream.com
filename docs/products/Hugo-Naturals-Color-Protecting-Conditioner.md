      <li>Nice smell and it leaves my hair nice and silky!</li>
      <li>Very pleased</li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall I am very pleased.</li>
      <li>I got this product as a sample in my ecoemi box and fell in love with it!</li>
      <li>love this conditioner!  </li>
      <li>I have been using all this chemically-laden shampoo and conditioner and mousse that I wasn&#x27;t enjoying, plus it wasn&#x27;t working!</li>
      <li>Make sure you rinse well!  </li>
      <li>This shampoo and conditioner both worked amazingly well on my hair.</li>
      <li>Makes hair silky smooth, smells great.</li>
      <li>Although this conditioner smells amazing and does moisturize</li>
      <li>The smell is nice</li>
      <li>It is a nice feeling to know we are not</li>
      <li>Nice conditioner, light weight, smells great, and I love that it is rated well on the EWG list.</li>
      <li>pleasant light scent.  </li>
      <li>It requires more work getting it into your hair, but I love it!</li>
      <li>I couldn&#x27;t be happier that I found something safe to use that I&#x27;m so thrilled</li>
      <li>Love, love, love this conditioner!</li>
      <li>Great and great rating on low chemical / EWG database!</li>
      <li>I googled it trying to see if it was too good to be true</li>
      <li>I quickly ordered it from Amazon and have been delighted with my find.  </li>
      <li>The smell is OK.</li>
      <li>I love the brand and that it is non- toxic.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s more like hand lotion than conditioner.</li>
      <li>it’s ok.</li>
      <li>I sure wished I&#x27;d known this before purchasing this &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; product.</li>
      <li>I love this conditioner.  </li>
      <li>I love the lotion but not the shampoo &amp; conditioner.  </li>
      <li>Could be better at detangling, but it&#x27;s certainly better than a lot of others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I like acure better.</li>
      <li>This is a fantastic product!  </li>
      <li>I did a lot of research on finding a conditioner with healthy ingredients.  </li>
      <li>but I will keep using until I find a better alternative.</li>
      <li>The conditioner is ok, but you use more.</li>
      <li>Great NATURAL ingredient shampoo!!</li>
      <li>My hair has a nice shine after using and is full.  </li>
      <li>It would probably be a product that men as well as women could easily use -</li>
      <li>I have hair that gets so darn tangled if I don&#x27;t use conditioner and was looking for a great low chemical one and love this one.</li>
      <li>But if safe ingredients are important to you, it is a fabulous option.     </li>
      <li>/&gt;However, throughout the day, with my hair type/oils, etc, the smell changes.&lt;br /&gt;I end up smelling like baked goods and brown sugar (interesting as it is Sweet Orange/Vanilla).&lt;br /&gt;Not</li>
      <li>I have fine, oily hair.</li>
      <li>It may be fine for others.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Scent is pleasant, but quite strong and will remain obvious throughout the day, so make sure you like it.</li>
      <li>Tried many natural conditioners but this one smells great and really does give my hair volume.</li>
      <li>I love that it is low on the toxic scale and a good price.  </li>
      <li>is that it is a really sweet strong smell when you are in the shower</li>
      <li>My hair was fairly lank and flat the rest of the day, but I think that was more because the shampoo did not get the scalp clean than the fault of the conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It is REALLY hard to find a good non-toxic shampoo that gives you good results so if you&#x27;re set on being strictly non-toxic this is a good option as long as you&#x27;re ok with your hair  </li>
      <li>I absolutely love the smell of this shampoo and conditioner and my hair has never felt so healthy and soft!</li>
      <li>It is a tad on the pricey side but totally worth every penny!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m so excited.</li>
      <li>once my hair has completely dried, it looks healthy and smells great, and I do not notice any negatives in the appearance of my hair.</li>
      <li>Rinses clean but still conditions.</li>
      <li>but I just don&#x27;t feel my hair got clean with these products.</li>
      <li>I love the smell, but it was very drying.</li>
      <li>I find anything more out about this product, but as of now it&#x27;s really the bees knees</li>
      <li>You have to rinse a bit more to really feel like you&#x27;re getting it all out, too...</li>
      <li>So far the best I&#x27;ve used is either Pureology (which is really expensive) or Dove (cheap but good).</li>
      <li>I have fine, oily hair and was looking for a natural shampoo that could help to condition my top layers, which were stripped and frizzing from weather and heat and lack of moisture in the air.</li>
      <li>The conditioner smells great, but the product is so thick it will not come out the flip top cap.</li>
      <li>I used it for the first time this morning (shampoo and conditioner), and no mousse and my hair was voluminous again!</li>
      <li>I have fine straight hair</li>
      <li>I was hoping to be able to add this to my list of conditioners and shampoos that are somewhat natural.  </li>
      <li>Please make sure you aren&#x27;t sensitive to it before you go all out and start using their products.</li>
      <li>I love that this is all natural and rated well with EWG.</li>
      <li>In efforts to find a more natural haircare solution I have tried no poo with baking soda with apple cider vinegar, hair soap shampoo bars, etc.  </li>
      <li>I came on to Anazon to order this again, and thought that it was worth leaving a review, since I&#x27;ve been using it for awhile</li>
      <li>Honestly, I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve ever used the same hair washing routine for this</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m using the shampoo also and my hair is so soft, shiny and healthy looking.  </li>
      <li>My normally tangly hair is easily combed after the shower.  </li>
      <li>The new formula does not have the nice slip like the old one did.  </li>
      <li>Though I do find that the lovely smell does not last all day and my hair tends to end up smelling like sweaty scalp, otherwise it would be a five star product.</li>
      <li>I will definitely buy more.</li>
      <li>My hair was baby soft and smooth.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Great NATURAL ingredient shampoo!! My boyfriend &amp; I check on &amp;#34;Skin Deep&amp;#34; it&#x27;s an app.  You can put in a product or scan a bar code &amp; it tells you  a rating on the ingredients. 0 being the best. This is rated a 0 &amp; one of the best , &amp; less expensive ones. Just like eating health / Organic is pretty pricey, so is getting all natural, no harmful ingredient  hair/skin care products. I highly recommend this shampoo , as well as checking out &amp;#34;skin Deep&amp;#34; app for your products or future purchases.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you,&lt;br /&gt;Jenni~</li>
    <li> This stuff works very well for a natural product, in combination with the shampoo. The smell is OK. I&#x27;m in Denver so my hair still appears dry and dull (thanks, hard water) but feels soft. My roots are never greasy with this product, which is saying something. I am pleasantly surprised.</li>
    <li> I recommend this for a child&#x27;s hair. It gets good marks from the Environmental Working Group and smells like cupcakes.</li>
    <li> Nice conditioner, light weight, smells great, and I love that it is rated well on the EWG list.</li>
    <li> I love the lotion but not the shampoo &amp; conditioner.  The smell is nice but I just don&#x27;t feel my hair got clean with these products.</li>
    <li> I had a horrible reaction to Hugo shampoo and conditioner. Please make sure you aren&#x27;t sensitive to it before you go all out and start using their products. Of course, everyone is different, but just a \\&quot;heads\\&quot; up.</li>
    <li> I am moving my family to all natural products slowly but surely. I was using another brand, but it didn&#x27;t lather well at all (which I heard is common with sulfate free soaps) and it left my hair really greasy. After using Hugo naturals I was floored. I googled it trying to see if it was too good to be true and if there was a scandal behind it or something but I couldn&#x27;t find anything. This shampoo does everything it says it does.  It smells amazing, lathers wonderfully and is volumizing. I couldn&#x27;t be happier that I found something safe to use that I&#x27;m so thrilled with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The conditioner is the same!  Just completely wonderful detangler and smells amazing. I think it smells like coconut but that&#x27;s not a complaint. It&#x27;s so reasonably priced too, I swear this has to be a scam or something. I&#x27;ll revise my post of I find anything more out about this product, but as of now it&#x27;s really the bees knees and I will continue to buy this over and over.</li>
    <li> It does take a little getting used to. It requires more work getting it into your hair, but I love it! My hair is so soft and manageable. I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Make sure you rinse well!  I hated this conditioner at first because I made the mistake of thinking that if I didn&#x27;t rinse thoroughly and left a little bit in my hair, it would continue to moisturize it (kind of like a leave-in conditioner).  Instead, it left a waxy residue that made my hair tangled and dry feeling.  But, if you rinse it all out, it works great!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I was confused that the ingredients listed \\&quot;butter extract\\&quot; even though it says vegan, so I emailed the company and they said, \\&quot;The ingredient&#x27;s proper scientific name is Butyrospermum Parkii (Shea) Butter or Shea Butter.  Ours is derived from the karite fruit on the African mangifolia tree.  Please rest assured that our entire product line is vegan, soy-free and gluten-free.\\&quot;  So it&#x27;s definitely vegan :)</li>
    <li> I have fine, oily hair. This shampoo and conditioner both worked amazingly well on my hair. The smell is fantastic, I could not possibly love it any more. My hair was baby soft and smooth. Seriously, it is like silk. And it&#x27;s bouncy! and it smells so good! Based on the reviews here I would have never even tried it.</li>
    <li> pleasant light scent.  Very pleased</li>
    <li> I have already reviewed the shampoo - suffice it to say that it was horrible.  Turned my hair into a giant matte, couldn&#x27;t get down to the scalp to get it clean, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, the conditioner saved the day.  Despite the crappy performance of the shampoo, this conditioner managed to smooth out the dry, tangled mess the shampoo had made out of my hair.  My hair was fairly lank and flat the rest of the day, but I think that was more because the shampoo did not get the scalp clean than the fault of the conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Scent is pleasant, but quite strong and will remain obvious throughout the day, so make sure you like it.</li>
    <li> I have searched high and low for a super healthy, super natural shampoo and conditioner product. The average person exposes themselves to a frightening amount of harmful chemicals through everyday beauty/health products.     This is by FAR my favorite natural shampoo product.    I will agree that it is not quite as effective as a typical shampoo loaded with synthetic chemicals. But if safe ingredients are important to you, it is a fabulous option.     The shampoo does leave your hair a bit tangled, but the conditioner compensates for that beautifully.    And the Vanilla/Sweet Orange smells SO good!</li>
    <li> I have fine, oily hair and was looking for a natural shampoo that could help to condition my top layers, which were stripped and frizzing from weather and heat and lack of moisture in the air. Although this conditioner smells amazing and does moisturize okay, I didn&#x27;t notice enough of an improvement with my top layers in comparison to other conditioners I was trying. It also didn&#x27;t help much with tangles and was a little more difficult to work through my hair. You have to rinse a bit more to really feel like you&#x27;re getting it all out, too... Other conditioners offered better results.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love the smell of this shampoo and conditioner and my hair has never felt so healthy and soft!</li>
    <li> I found a trial sized shampoo and conditioner at a whole foods store, and I absolutely hated it. I have fine straight hair and it just made my hair feel sort of greasy but at the same time dry and frizzy. So far the best I&#x27;ve used is either Pureology (which is really expensive) or Dove (cheap but good).</li>
    <li> I love this conditioner.  I have very fine hair and a lot can weigh it down.  This does NOT!  It has a nice scent (more vanilla than orange) and detangles wonderfully!  I love that it is low on the toxic scale and a good price.  Will buy again.</li>
    <li> The product was delivered on time and was everything I hoped for.  I had tried the &amp;#34;no poo&amp;#34; method, which left my hair dry and flat.  After using this product, I found my hair soft and shiny again!  I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I came on to Anazon to order this again, and thought that it was worth leaving a review, since I&#x27;ve been using it for awhile now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this conditioner!  In efforts to find a more natural haircare solution I have tried no poo with baking soda with apple cider vinegar, hair soap shampoo bars, etc.  I just missed that shampoo and conditioner experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So I checked environmental working group, and found this company to rank very well with them.  I bought the shampoo and conditioner and have been using both for over a year now.  Honestly, I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve ever used the same hair washing routine for this long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have lots of thin, curly hair.  As far as haircare goes, it&#x27;s pretty easy to please, all the aforementioned methods worked just fine.  I&#x27;m not looking to bring back the 80s, but pairing this with Andalou naturals hairspray gets millennium appropriate volume.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope this will be around for a long time - it&#x27;s got a great ingredient list and it works.  A win for me!</li>
    <li> I was honestly surprised to like this conditioner...most \\&quot;natural\\&quot; conditioners either leave my hair frizzy &amp; wild, or greasy &amp; gross.  This one did a good job at balancing everything...wasn&#x27;t too heavy, wasn&#x27;t greasy, didn&#x27;t leave me a dried-out frizzy mess.  Could be better at detangling, but it&#x27;s certainly better than a lot of others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said...I&#x27;m not wild about the way it smells.  Doesn&#x27;t smell orangey or much like vanilla to me.  It would probably be a product that men as well as women could easily use - it&#x27;s not a flowery perfumey smell, and the scent doesn&#x27;t linger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Note:  A little goes a long way.  I use much less of this conditioner than I do with others.</li>
    <li> The conditioner smells great, but the product is so thick it will not come out the flip top cap. I used the product, but had to bang it against the side of the sink ( like catsup) to get the product out of the bottle.</li>
    <li> When I switched to using more natural products I tried quite a few shampoos and conditioners, most of which I did not like. I initially did not like this one much either, but I forced myself to give it a chance and now I wouldn&#x27;t exchange it for anything else.&lt;br /&gt;When you get too used to using drugstore conditioners laden with chemicals, it is hard to start using a natural conditioner because natural conditioners do not have the silicones that give your hair that silky smooth texture you feel as you are rinsing it out. I was very used to that feeling, so when I would rinse my hair with this, I felt like it was drier and my hair would feel sort of tangled. The reason I do not mind it though, is because #1 it smells beyond amazing, i never had a conditioner smell as great as this and #2 once my hair has completely dried, it looks healthy and smells great, and I do not notice any negatives in the appearance of my hair. I think the fact that you aren&#x27;t applying chemicals to your head outweighs the silky feel that drugstore conditioners give your hair as you are rinsing them out.</li>
    <li> Makes hair silky smooth, smells great.</li>
    <li> This conditioner (along with the shampoo that goes with it) is great. It has an excellent Environmental Working Group rating, is organic, no animal testing, etc. My hair has never been shinier. The smell is a bit strange at first - like cake batter, but it goes away quickly. The price is reasonable for a natural product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall I am very pleased.</li>
    <li> Ive tried this product 5 times now and have been unable to rinse it out. Each time even after my hair dries it looks wet, greasy and dirty.  I was very disappointed because I love their shampoo!</li>
    <li> Is smells sweet and gives my hair volume without all the chemical crap in regular conditioners.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know if this is a new formula, but it&#x27;s too thick. It&#x27;s more like hand lotion than conditioner. I had to water it down to use.</li>
    <li> I WILL ALWAYS USE THIS PRODUCT, AND THE SCENT WITH THE ORANGE COMPLIMENTS THE VANILLA SOOOO WELL.. I BOUGHT 4 BOTTLES COMBINED WITH MY SHAMPOO</li>
    <li> I love the brand and that it is non- toxic. It smells great. My only problem is that it is not easy to wash your hair with as it has&lt;br /&gt;no &amp;#34;slip&amp;#34; or lather. My hair is also less manageable after use. It is REALLY hard to find a good non-toxic shampoo that gives you good results so if you&#x27;re set on being strictly non-toxic this is a good option as long as you&#x27;re ok with your hair  not being really soft and manageable.</li>
    <li> This conditioner smells amazing! Wish that worked well. I purchased this because I&#x27;m very nervous about all the crap thats in shampoos, conditioners, and everything else these days. It rates as one of the lowest on the Skin Deep Database which is important to me.  However, my hair feels dry and crappy (for lack of a better term) after I use this. Very disappointed but I will keep using until I find a better alternative.</li>
    <li> Please see my complete review under the shampoo. However, I did not in any way like this conditioner. My hair remained dry throughout and greasy at the roots after using it with the Hugo Naturals Volumizing Shampoo.</li>
    <li> The conditioner is ok, but you use more. The shampoo is not good at all.</li>
    <li> Great and great rating on low chemical / EWG database!</li>
    <li> Good product--wish we could get this combined with conditioner. but this works well. It is a nice feeling to know we are not</li>
    <li> works great, smells great</li>
    <li> I had an allergic reaction to this conditioner.  I&#x27;ve had minor allergic reactions to products before, but this caused a rash from my ears down to my stomach.  I&#x27;m not sure which ingredient in the conditioner caused me to react like this, but wanted to put a warning out there to others with sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I love the smell and the conditioner made my hair softer than the coconut version - not sure why.  I will definitely buy more.</li>
    <li> I bought this shampoo and conditioner a few months ago, and have used it a few times a week without issue, until a week or so ago. I have no complaint about the condition of my hair, rather regarding some of the ingredients used in this particular line of product (vanilla and sweet orange). Balsam Peru oil is a vary common allergen, and a very common cause of allergic dermatitis. I sure wished I&#x27;d known this before purchasing this &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; product. I too, as another reviewer noted, started with itching on the ears, working down the back of my neck, then throughout my entire body (minus my lower back, bottom, and legs :) ). I would also like to mention that, being pregnant, this terrible ordeal has been not only costly (I&#x27;m talking HUNDREDS in medical bills, as I ended up going to 4 or so doctors before one was able to diagnose properly what was happening to me), but the treatment involves STEROIDS. That&#x27;s pills and creams. Being pregnant, that is not without serious risk to the baby, let alone myself. Unfortunately, suffering the allergic/contact dermatitis and autoeczemization, I had no choice but to seek treatment (some of the side effects of these conditions being vomiting and diarrhea, causing me to lose 4+ lbs in one week). Now, I know not all people are going to react to things like Balsam Peru oil, but if you happen to take a minute to google contact dermatitis, or allergic dermatitis, and the common culprits that bring these conditions on, that particular oil is pretty much ALWAYS listed as a top offender. Why would this company put such a risky ingredient in their product? Especially knowing that most of their clientel are probably looking for products free from common allergens, like gluten and so forth? Seems pretty strange that they missed that one. ewg.org has cited these facts. Even Wikipedia (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balsam_of_Peru) states that &amp;#34;It can cause allergic reactions.[3] A number of surveys have identified Balsam of Peru asbeing in the &amp;#34;top five&amp;#34; allergens most commonly causing patch test reactions in people referred to dermatology clinics. It may cause inflammation, redness, swelling, soreness, itching, and blisters, including allergic contact dermatitis, stomatitis (inflammation and soreness of the mouth or tongue), cheilitis (inflammation, rash, or painful erosion of the lips, oropharyngeal mucosa, or angles of their mouth), pruritis, hand eczema, generalized or resistant plantar dermatitis, rhinitis, and conjunctivitis.&amp;#34; So, why has Hugo Naturals decided to put this in their product? Beware. I&#x27;m planning to contact the company next, and see about reparations towards the cost this reaction has incurred my family, not to mention the health of my unborn baby and myself.</li>
    <li> This was a great product before the formula was changed.  The new formula does not have the nice slip like the old one did.  I will be searching for a new conditioner once I finish my bottle.</li>
    <li> I was sad that this didn&#x27;t work out for me.  I love the smell, but it was very drying.</li>
    <li> I adore the smell of this conditioner on application.&lt;br /&gt;I like that it has essential oils and other beneficial ingredients.&lt;br /&gt;However, throughout the day, with my hair type/oils, etc, the smell changes.&lt;br /&gt;I end up smelling like baked goods and brown sugar (interesting as it is Sweet Orange/Vanilla).&lt;br /&gt;Not my personal preference, but others may appreciate.</li>
    <li> Love this low chemical conditioner. It works fantastically and smells great! I have hair that gets so darn tangled if I don&#x27;t use conditioner and was looking for a great low chemical one and love this one. It is a tad on the pricey side but totally worth every penny!</li>
    <li> I got this product as a sample in my ecoemi box and fell in love with it! It&#x27;s one down side is that it is a really sweet strong smell when you are in the shower but after you rinse it out the smell tones down to a sweet vanilla smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have stick straight and slick hair and it works well to promote some resemblance of body to it. I also use the conditioner with this product.</li>
    <li> I did a lot of research on finding a conditioner with healthy ingredients.  This Hugo Naturals Conditioner scored a 1 on EWG.org.  I quickly ordered it from Amazon and have been delighted with my find.  The conditioner smells absolutely delicious and  is creamy and silky.  I first shampoo with Acure Organics Shampoo Moroccan Argan Oil and Argan Stem Cell (also rated a 1 on EWG) and follow up with this conditioner. My hair has a nice shine after using and is full.  It&#x27;s all the whole family uses now.</li>
    <li> I live in the desert, so I switch to a lighter conditioner in the summer. Otherwise my fine hair gets flat and weighed down. This conditioner smells sooo good, and it rinses out well. I smell it nice and clear in the shower but there is no lingering scent once my hair is dry. It is just vanilla and orange scent, no flowers or musk in there, which is a good thing in my book. Because it works for me, I will pay extra for the scent and fewer chemicals. Picked it up at Sprouts for the same price as Amazon.</li>
    <li> it’s ok. I like acure better.</li>
    <li> Causes severe allergic reaction!  You&#x27;ll notice multiple other reviewers have had this issue.  I&#x27;ve never been allergic to anything and this caused hives that started at my ears and went down my neck to my chest just like the other reviewers.  I used this conditioner for about 3 weeks before the reaction occurred.  It is awful - benadryl, hydrocortizone cream, and prescription steroid cream do not work to get rid of the rash.  Like the others i had to take oral steroids.  That&#x27;s helped it but I&#x27;m still extremely itchy.  It&#x27;s awful.  I would not take a chance on buying this conditioner - it&#x27;s not worth it!</li>
    <li> I was hoping to be able to add this to my list of conditioners and shampoos that are somewhat natural.  This one is not going to make the cut.  It does not live the hair feeling clean.  The shampoo was even worse than the conditioner.</li>
    <li> I have been down lately mainly because of my hair! I have been using all this chemically-laden shampoo and conditioner and mousse that I wasn&#x27;t enjoying, plus it wasn&#x27;t working! I was sick of using this stuff that I didn&#x27;t want to use in the first place, but I used anyway because my mom bought it for me and it did make my hair very voluminous. But living in Florida, with all the humidity, my hair wasn&#x27;t taking it anymore. It just fell flat. So I gave up. I researched Hugo on EWG&#x27;s Skindeep database and found it to be relatively good for my body. Plus all the reviews on Amazon made me want to try it! I used it for the first time this morning (shampoo and conditioner), and no mousse and my hair was voluminous again! And it has stayed like that all day (currently it has been 8 hours). I&#x27;m so excited. NOW, remember that it is a natural product, so your hair is not going to be as big as a stylist at a salon can make it. But it&#x27;s WAAAY better than flat flat flat hair. Another plus, IT SMELLS AMAZING! (copied from the shampoo review, but same feelings for the conditioner!)</li>
    <li> This conditioner smells delicious and works well. My normally tangly hair is easily combed after the shower.  I love that this is all natural and rated well with EWG.</li>
    <li> Tried many natural conditioners but this one smells great and really does give my hair volume. Rinses clean but still conditions.</li>
    <li> This is a fantastic product!  I&#x27;m using the shampoo also and my hair is so soft, shiny and healthy looking.  I&#x27;m only using the conditioner on the ends of my hair, as recommended.  I tried combing all the way through, but then my hair needed to be washed every day.  Love, love, love this conditioner!</li>
    <li> Does not suit my personal purpose. It felt very strange on my hair and it did not leave it smooth and manageable. It may be fine for others.</li>
    <li> This is a decent non toxic conditioner. Smells great and gets the job done. I find that it leaves my hair feeling soft and fluffy and is definitely worth the money. Though I do find that the lovely smell does not last all day and my hair tends to end up smelling like sweaty scalp, otherwise it would be a five star product.</li>
    <li> Nice smell and it leaves my hair nice and silky!</li>
