      <li>Great purchase, as described by seller, fast delivery.</li>
      <li>It would make more sense to have the conditioner in a tube.</li>
      <li>I prefer \\&quot;it&#x27;s a 10\\&quot; miracle mask and their leave in spray conditioner as it is much more lightweight.</li>
      <li>Ok conditioner now.</li>
      <li>It felt softer, and it was much more manageable than yesterday at the salon.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Glad I found it.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> The product arrived very well, I enjoy it a lot!</li>
    <li> This surpasses any shampoo and conditioner l have ever used. You will not be disappointed! Leaves the texture of the hair extremely manageable and silky!</li>
    <li> Unfortunately when I started using this product my hair was already fried from the point of no return (sun in and then bleaching which I found out IMMEDIATELY fries your hair so don&#x27;t use sun in!!) but this product is amazing it makes your hair soft and smooth and for me at least work able for brushing which is all that&#x27;s important! For non-fried but extremely damaged hair I highly recommend it! The container is surprisingly smaller than I expected and try to leave it on a full 15 minutes as it suggests.</li>
    <li> Definitely on my top 5 list of best deep conditioners.  My hair hasn&#x27;t felt this good in years!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t really find that this is any different/better than the regular conditioner. Don&#x27;t get me wrong I like the regular conditioner, but I don&#x27;t think this is worth buying when you already buy the shampoo &amp; conditioner bottles.</li>
    <li> Woo hoo!  I took another reviewers advice: if your wet hair breaks, it needs protein...voila&#x27;. This was an amazing hair fix for both myself and my family.  Our color was enhanced, way less breakage, and it&#x27;s both soft, and full of body (and we have fine hair).  We have been using a very high end damage remedy line by Aveda, this helped bump it up immensely!  We did put it on dry, wrap it in damp heat, and leave it on for a good long while (in the sauna).  I will never again be without this product.  But I don&#x27;t think it will be needed often.</li>
    <li> this really fixes dry long hair, makes it shine</li>
    <li> This product definitely makes my hair smoother, softer and shinier. The only complaint I have is the container. It would make more sense to have the conditioner in a tube. It&#x27;s not very thick and it easily slops out of the sides of the jar. If you&#x27;re using it while you shower it&#x27;s easy for water to get in and dilute it. It&#x27;s also difficult to get the product out and put the top back on since it&#x27;s slippery.  I&#x27;ll still continue to buy it but I hate the jar. The consistency is really not thick enough for a jar. I&#x27;ve used bottle conditioners that were thicker.</li>
    <li> Best product I&#x27;ve found for taming a perm and restoring overprocessed hair.</li>
    <li> I like the way my hair feels since I have been using it. I not only follow the directions but use it as a leave in conditioner every othere day. I have bleached  blond hair and I constantly get compliments on how soft my hair looks..I am in my 60&#x27;s so that is saying a lot about this product.</li>
    <li> Was not happy..it arrived in package opened and all over</li>
    <li> Speedy delivery. Conditioner seems to be working pretty well</li>
    <li> Hair is extremely soft with this! Love this product!! I use it once a week after a deep cleansing shampoo and leave it for about an hour, then rinse. Amazing stuff!</li>
    <li> The Redken Extreme Strength Builder plus saved my dead snapping broken dry-damaged hair. My hair has been in a weave for 2 and 1/2 years back to back. Yesterday, i finally take out the weave. My hair was falling out in the comb like crazy. it felt dead and fragile. How depressing. Today, i used the Redken Extreme Strength Builder. My hair did not break! It felt softer, and it was much more manageable than yesterday at the salon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know it will take a few weeks for my hair to get back to normal. At least now, I&#x27;m not afraid to comb my hair, fearing a ton of hair will be in the comb. This product gets 5-stars because it works. I already re-order my second container. I can&#x27;t live without it.</li>
    <li> Like how it makes my hair feel.</li>
    <li> I have been a loyal Redken customer for many years, and was very disappointed to learn that the Deep Fuel product has been discontinued. I bought the recommended replacement product, Extreme Strength Builder Plus, and just used it this morning. I am throwing the remainder out -- it has the same overwhelming and unpleasant smell of cheap, China manufactured hair care products available at WALMART. There doesn&#x27;t seem to be any hair strengthening value, and the smell on my hair just won&#x27;t go away, in spite of two thorough washings. Redken used to be a professional, high quality and trusted brand. I won&#x27;t buy this again and will look for highly rated conditioning products by other manufacturers.</li>
    <li> Good deep conditioner!  I even put on dry hair at night and wash out in am</li>
    <li> I was looking for something that would repair my hair and make it more alive. This product did the trick. I have had people ask me what I using on my hair. We keep buying this product for sure and will recommended it to anyone.</li>
    <li> Makes my hair STRONG!!!!</li>
    <li> This is a new product in the REDKEN® Extreme(tm) haircare line it contains IPN (Interlock Protein Network) which is a combination of ingredients that work from the core to the surface to rebuild and repair the hair. It also contains Ceramides which is the intercellular glue which holds the hairs internal fibers together and cuticle scales down and 18-MEA which is the primary lipid that makes the hair surface shiny, smooth and water-resistant. The product has a gentle fragrance and light, Gel-Creme consistency that feels incredibly smooth, silky and luxurious. One treatment left my dry brittle color-treated hair strong, smooth and silky-soft with a natural shine. It does not contain Heavy Oils, Waxes or Silicone.</li>
    <li> Im on the journey to replenishing my dry, damaged, over processed hair.  One of my stylists recommended that I try this product along with the anti-snap.  Honestly, I felt like for the money that I paid for these...it wasn&#x27;t worth it.  Not a lot of results at all.  I&#x27;ve seen better results with cheaper products.  This was my first time trying it.  I must say that my hair felt really soft when i first rinse it out.  But in the end after I blow dry my hair it really wasn&#x27;t that great.</li>
    <li> Works beautifully. It came in the large tube (same ounces) and I prefer that because it&#x27;s easier than the tub.</li>
    <li> My hair gets very dry in the winter, and I&#x27;ve also started coloring it.  I have not used many hair masks before, but my hair clearly needed some hydration, so I decided to give this a try.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The directions say to apply this mask to towel-dried hair, and to leave it on for 5-15 minutes.  The first time I used this, I just applied it to my wet hair in the shower.  That didn&#x27;t give me good results.  The second time, I followed the instructions, and applied it after I got out of the shower &amp; towel-dried my hair.  I left it on for the full 15 minutes, then got back in the shower to rinse it out.  (If I had a sink that was suitable, I wouldn&#x27;t have had to get in the shower again!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The whole process was a little annoying, but I&#x27;m VERY happy with the results.  This mask made a big difference in how my hair feels.  It is much softer and less static-y.  I will keep using it every week!</li>
    <li> Made my hair shiny and stronger. Follow directions thoroughly.</li>
    <li> I really love the Redken products, this one especially. I have very fine curly hair, my hair is dry in the summer &amp; I use this and no more fly aways.</li>
    <li> This stuff is magic. After the first use I immediately saw and felt the damage repair it did to my dry ends. And it smells fabulous. Safe to use on colored hair.</li>
    <li> I recently noticed that my hair had become very brittle and easily tangled, I am happy to say that after a week of using this my hair has returned to its normally soft bouncy self. &#x3D;]</li>
    <li> Not a huge fan of the scent (smells like cream soda) and wanted something a little thicker for my hair.</li>
    <li> Really good... beautiful hair.</li>
    <li> For many years, I had always used cheap Walmart conditioners. I thought that they worked as well as the top dollar salon hair treatments, i was WRONG!! I bought this at JC Pennies and i will never go back to any other brand. I had dry, over processed hair, it was breaking off! After the first treatment, my hair felt so soft and looked shiny! I recommend leaving it on as long as possible! Don&#x27;t trust Amazon to give you genuine hair products either, always buy in store or from the manufacturer.</li>
    <li> The scent was ok, not too overpowering and it really make my hair feel nice.</li>
    <li> This is the best conditioner for severely damaged hair, my hair was a hot mess  damaged by my hairdresser.  I had severe  hair protein deficency from  relaxers, rinses that did not have protein  followed by  the ridiculous amount of heat applied to my hair  by the hairdresser, dewtroying my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I have returned to doing my own  hair . My hair has returned to what I remember it to be , smooth  and strong , no more snapping when I comb out or during washing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff is awsome  I recommend to add the  anti-snap leave in treatment as well. I  also  tried the REDKEN  olio and that is just an awsome  oil treatment.  Kudos to Redken.</li>
    <li> Though this item does contain silicones (which are not good for your hair, it coats it to make it look good but ultimately dries it out), the other ingredients really helped my hair.  My hair is bleached and has a large amount of damage on the ends. I ended up giving this product to my older sister who is experiencing damage due to hormone imbalances and it seems to be working very well for her as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t mind having my hair look a little &amp;#34;heavier&amp;#34; so i&#x27;ll just put the mask in and cover my hair with a plastic bag and beanie overnight.  I rinse it out in the morning and my hair feels great! I do this once a week along with a hot oil treatment once a week and aphogee hair reconstructor one to two times a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My sister on the other hand really appreciates volume, so she puts the hair mask on for an hour or two over the week end and then rinses it out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I personally believe that leaving it in as long as possible is the best, and for the amount this mask costs it is important to get as much out of it as possible.  If you hate having your hair feel weighed down after this mask but you need the rebuilding action, use as many natural products, such as certain dry shampoos, to give hair volume. I know lush has some really good products, but do keep an eye out because some of their things contain parabens!</li>
    <li> I have platinum blond hair that I achieved through multiple bleachings.  Needless to say  my hair was quite damaged.  I started using Redken Extreme when my hairdresser recommended it, and I am very pleased with the result.  My hair is now soft, shiny I haven&#x27;t had any issues with breakage.  My friend tried it on her hair, but didn&#x27;t care for it.  She complained about residue weighing down her hair.  Her hair was healthy to begin with though.  According to my hairdresser this product is intended for people with very damaged hair, and if you&#x27;ve been taking good care of your hair then you probably don&#x27;t need it (anything in Redken&#x27;s \\&quot;Extreme\\&quot; line, you don&#x27;t really need).  I love it though.  Best product to salvaged damaged hair.</li>
    <li> I bought redken when I was a teen and that was years ago.  I am back and happy I am back.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve read a review talking about this product and wanted to give it a try. It doesn&#x27;t make the same wonders that Alphaparf (the white one) treatment cream does for my hair. It&#x27;s as if I didn&#x27;t use anything different. I have oily thick dark hair. But I do believe when it comes to cosmetics we have to try and see how it works for ourselves.</li>
    <li> I love this product, it works great, but when I got it, the cap was cracked and over half of the product leaked all out.</li>
    <li> This did  nothing for my hair. It smells weird.</li>
    <li> My hair is extremely damaged. put this on for 15 mins and use some heat. It has helped some what.</li>
    <li> This works. It has helped the recovery of my hair tremendously. I would like the do this product with the technology that protects the hair from the iron head</li>
    <li> One of the best Redken product. My wife&#x27;s hair was damaged due to all her beauty center visits. With this product, it changed for good. The results are impressive. Good looking and soft hair once again. 2 thumbs up!!!</li>
    <li> This is AMAZING and truly makes my dull, lifeless hair shine!!! My go-to!!!!  I LOVE this!!!</li>
    <li> I bought this after reading reviews and watching YouTube beauty gurus review this product.  It&#x27;s an okay deep conditioner.  I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s worth the money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After use my hair didn&#x27;t really feel moisturized.  It felt dry and my curls didn&#x27;t seem to have much life after using this product.  I guess I use the softness of my hair to measure how well I think the conditioner took to my hair.  I didn&#x27;t really like it.  I used this when I ran out of my preferred deep conditioner.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s exactly what you supposed to receive. Redken have everything you need to make your hair feel healthy. Excellent choose. 100% recommended.</li>
    <li> It worked well but I wouldn&#x27;t buy again the price is too expensive. The container is smaller than it looks.</li>
    <li> So I&#x27;m black and bleached my hair starting last summer. Since bleaching my hair it had went from silky smooth to a rough kinky curly texture. It is VERY dry, has some breakage, and I find it hard to comb when it&#x27;s dry and not wet - still has moisturizer in it when it&#x27;s dried though. I was looking for something to soften it up and stop the breakage. I heard good reviews on this so I bought it. It cost me 26 dollars at the beauty supply store. I thought it would be a miracle, but honestly after trying it I was not that impressed. Yes it did soften my hair, but only for a day or two, then my hair went back to being hard to manage. I thought with people saying it saved their hair, that it was something that worked instantly but I guess you have to keep using it. There IS however, a product I remembered using that gave me the EXACT SAME RESULTS the Redken Builder gave for less money. It&#x27;s called Shea Moisture Raw Shea Butter Restorative Conditioner. I&#x27;ll put a link: http://www.amazon.com/Shea-Moisture-Butter-Restorative-Conditioner/dp/B0097OXE4O/ref&#x3D;cm_cr_pr_product_top&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That gave me the same soft hair and less breakage (for a few days) and cost me less money so I would probably purchase that instead. I think Redken is good but I&#x27;ll probably not purchase it again because of the price, and because I&#x27;m looking for a stronger product that works for longer than both - which was why I bought Redken in the first place, just didn&#x27;t work out though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;edit: 7/18/14 - I also found another product (For women of color and other women that works AMAZINGLY) and it&#x27;s Cheaper than Redken. I discovered this while coloring my hair black from Clairol Textures and Tones, the conditioner came as a mini in the box but it works better and for longer. I&#x27;m happy to report it comes in a larger size! It&#x27;s called Pantene Pro-V Relaxed &amp; Natural Conditioner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/Pantene-Relaxed-Natural-Conditioner-Moisturized/dp/B003USK2E8/ref&#x3D;cm_cr_pr_product_topef&#x3D;cm_cr_pr_product_top</li>
    <li> Love how it leave my hair</li>
    <li> It is a very good treatment and my haircare indicates it to me. Smells very good and work in my hair</li>
    <li> This product is awesome...My hair was so damaged due to too much heat application and after  applying this product ....my hair has become so smooth and soft... even split ends.</li>
    <li> When I received this in the mail it had exploded all over the packaging and leaked through it. I never was able to use it.</li>
    <li> Would give zero stars if I could... throwing $18 right in the trash. It&#x27;s runny, does NOTHING for my hair... if anything leaves it feeling worse that before. I&#x27;m not sure if this stuff is a knock-off or what... (Bought from &amp;#34;Buy Beauty Direct&amp;#34;) I ordered based on the good reviews and I needed a good protein treatment... THIS IS NOT IT. I will stick to &amp;#34;It&#x27;s a 10 miracle leave-in potion&amp;#34;. I do like the Redken &amp;#34;All soft&amp;#34; that I got at the salon... afraid to buy it on AMZ now though... if knock-offs are being sold here.</li>
    <li> I actually love this product.  I am black and have natural hair.  I used this and I did notice a big difference in my hair after the first use.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love the smell of this product.  I use it once a week as a hair mask for at least 5-7 minutes while in the shower.  It leaves my hair silky smooth and doesn&#x27;t weigh it down at all.  I have thick, yet very fine, straight blonde hair.</li>
    <li> This is one of the good redkin products I&#x27;ve been able to get from amazon. It looks like the picture...meaning it&#x27;s the new packaging design and not the old one (so it&#x27;s not expired) and it made my dry hair silk and smooth. Pricey.  May be worth it to you.</li>
    <li> A stylist recommended this product after my hair grew in very fragile and damaged after chemo. I use it once or twice a week to give my hair volume, body and bounce. I noticed other reviewers complaining about the thinness of the product but I&#x27;m not bothered by that. Nor do I care that it has to be rinsed out. I just wash my hair, towel-dry it, dip a couple of fingers into the Redken, work it into my hair, throw on a wrap and occupy myself for ten minutes before hopping back in the shower for a quick rinse. Every leave-in conditioner/moisturizer I&#x27;ve tried weighs down my fragile hair, so I&#x27;m very happy with Extreme Strength Builder Plus.</li>
    <li> This stuff saved my damaged, bleach blonde hair!! I use it once a week in the shower, makes my hair so soft. Nothing I&#x27;ve found compared</li>
    <li> Wrong item sent!  This is NOT the Extreme Strength Builder Plus. I received the Redken Fortifying  Mask instead which is a completely different conditioner. Item is not the same as pictured</li>
    <li> These products changed my hair. Yes, it is a little pricy, but you will see the difference in your hair.</li>
    <li> Not enough power of tenacity.</li>
    <li> This product made my hair very soft and strong. I have noticed that my hair is not shedding as much as it did before.</li>
    <li> This products works well. My hair turns out shiney and soft.  I have thin, colored hair and this products works well.  I only leave on for 2-3 minutes while in the shower and  it seems to work great for me.</li>
    <li> First let me begin by saying I am a hair snob. I take extremely good care of it and only use brands such as redken, bedhead, goldwell, purology, etc. Also, I never use heat tools so my hair is pretty healthy. That being said I try to use a mask once a week for some extra conditioning. I found that although this mask does smell great and deep conditions well it doesn&#x27;t fully rinse out of my hair and leaves a residue that feels almost greasy. I prefer \\&quot;it&#x27;s a 10\\&quot; miracle mask and their leave in spray conditioner as it is much more lightweight.</li>
    <li> My hair was very dry and brittle from being in Germany where the water is pretty bad.  I had also had highlights done over there as well and they damaged it further by applying the highlights to more than just my roots.  I had thought Redken would be great product and would make a difference, but it honestly did just the opposite.  I was not impressed at all, and stopped using it after two applications. My hair was very dry, the split ends looked worse than before and my hair looked incredibly thin.  I since have purchased the Kerastase and it is fabulous!! It has done everything Redken failed to do.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff, I have super fine and very long color treated hair.  This is the only thing I have ever found which takes the tangles out completely.</li>
    <li> I was looking for the product used at a beauty shop, but this is not it.  I&#x27;ve used it several times, but my hair is just as dry and lifeless as before.</li>
    <li> Best product I ever used.  Highly recommended.  Thanks.&lt;br /&gt;Mary Poppins.</li>
    <li> I have now used it twice, and my hair feels softer and looks shinier than it has in a long time!  I like the fragrance, which is great, because it is still noticeable now, 36 hours since I washed my hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know if it will actually build strength, but I will continue to use it weekly, since my hair now looks and feels healthy.</li>
    <li> Good price, quick delivery, what&#x27;s not to like?</li>
    <li> What a god-send this is. I have highlighted my hair for 12 years and always used salon products, hair professionally done, never used junk anything because I always said if you pay to go salon why go cheap on products and tools to basically wipe out your $100 dye job. Well about a year ago I went all dark brown, from blonde, hated it and went back to blonde in stages shortly after. My hair was never the same. Very dry and brittle and had to cut my hair often to keep the yuck off. My hair stylist and I tried everything and nothing was working. Ever since I started using this it&#x27;s like my hair is softer , silkier and not breaking. Looks like my normal healthy hair again. I used every other wash for a week in replace of conditioner. It never weighs me down nor feels greasy or thick. Love love love this. Worth the money a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> I really love it because it revives my hair every time I wash it!!!Very good for dry hair with the split ends,especially the blond and the highlighted hair.</li>
    <li> Love it&lt;br /&gt;Really made my hair feel so much better after coloring it.</li>
    <li> I am overseas and when I found out I could get this product on amazon I FLIPPED! I have naturally dry, thick hair (that is wavy or kinky underneath) that seems to never have recovered from years of dying. I don&#x27;t dare dye it more than twice a year now, but it still continues to hold a grudge. This product brings back it&#x27;s smoothness and shine. Because my hair is so stubborn about staying dry, I use it every other day to every third day (more than the recommended usage) and the cost is always worth it. The tub usually lasts me about 4-6 weeks using it every other day to every third day,  The smell is great and the results keep me dedicated to the Redken name. I have tried other products like Bedhead, Carols Daughter, Fekkei, Neutrogena Triple Moisture, and Pantene Pro-V, but they never give the same results. I would definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> I first heard of this product in a First for Woman magazine, it said that it was great for getting rid of flyaway hairs.  It smells really good, and is a good deep conditioner, but not so great for flyaways.</li>
    <li> I bought this product because I had previous success with other redken products. Ive used this product for about a month and I have to say I am very pleased. It really makes my hair feel like silk but not weighed down in any way. It smells very good and as soon as I run out of my Redken Real Control shampoo and conditioner I will purchase the Extreme products to replace them. I will definitely purchase this again.</li>
    <li> I love Redkin, I use All soft for shampoo &amp; conditioner, I bought this cus my hairs very long and Is dry at the ends, my only negative Is how I have to scoop It outta my hand &amp; Its runny, makes It a bit hard In the shower</li>
    <li> Not the same formula. Ok conditioner now. Nothing great.</li>
    <li> This product, along with the Extreme Anti-Snap will be all that I need for the foreseeable future. Glad I found it.</li>
    <li> great product but I am not sure if it work. my hair was left frizzy. but will keep trying it.</li>
    <li> I have been looking high and low for a deep treatment that contained ceramides and 18-MEA.  They are out there but this is the only one I have found to date not filled with silicones.  I prefer my deep treatments to be silicone free so my hair can really get in the goodness without the cones blocking any penetration of ingredients.  I am so happy.  Ceramides and 18-MEA are a must for damaged hair. This treatment is the best thing you can find for restoring hair back to strong and smooth.  A nice protein based conditioner with everything you need to add shine and strength.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product is a cool soft minty blue green.  Smells nice.  Not overpowering in anyway at all.  I just love it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My routine for this...Clarify with VO5 Clarifying Shampoo to remove any product buildup and leave hair open to take in the goodness of the deep treatment, apply Redken to damp hair..put shower cap on head and leave on 15 minutes.  Rinse.  I then follow with another deep moisture conditioner (no protein this time) mixed with raw honey and aloe, leave on 5 minutes and rinse.  I then coat slightly damp hair with a mix of coconut/avocado/emu oil, clip up and go to bed. Next day I wash the oils out of my hair with a conditioner only wash and my hair feel incredible.  My hair was very damaged, dry and tangly.  This treatment gave it such a nice change..  This makes my hair feel like new.  I plan on doing this every 10 days... I am that impressed.  Yes doing it this way takes a good 30 minutes but the results are worth every minute.  This will go a long way in helping me get my hair back to health.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This conditioner is excellent used on its own also..but when I have the time I like do the whole routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seller was so fast to respond when I had a question before buying.  Product came sealed and untampered with.  I am thrilled with this purchase.  No words seem to express well enough.</li>
    <li> Great deep conditioner, makes hair soft shiny and strong, I love the results. Lower price than the salon too!!</li>
    <li> Works ok I thought it would be better.</li>
    <li> This is amazing!!! I am in love with, I use with my my secure steamer for about twenty minutes. After I rinse it out my hair feels like heaven. Its does exactly what I needed it to do, repair and strengthen my relaxed hair but not overly fortify it. Plus after I use I have absolutely no breakage.</li>
    <li> Great price , great as a conditioner and shipping was fast.</li>
    <li> As long as I only use this, no more than a couple of times a week, it makes my hair feel strong and bouncy.  If used daily, it can make hair feel dirty or heavy.</li>
    <li> This is a great conditioner to replace the protein in your hair.  It really helps with elasticity.  I have been using this product for over a year now and have purchased it twice.</li>
    <li> This is a good conditioner...But truthfully, I don&#x27;t find it conditions any better than Redken&#x27;s All Soft Conditioner...and it is more expensive.</li>
    <li> THIS IS A REVIEW BY A BOT - APPARENTLY, MY ACCOUNT HAS BEEN COMPROMISED.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this product because my hair was completely brittle and so damaged. I put it in my hair when it is damp and leave it in overnight and when I wash it out my hair feels so soft and looks much shinier now. I will definitely be buying this again, a great buy!</li>
    <li> I love this conditioner, it made my hair smooth, silky, and healthy. I&#x27;m buying my next jar now.</li>
    <li> Great purchase, as described by seller, fast delivery. I am happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> TRIED EVERY HAIR PRODUCT. DON&#x27;T SEE THE HYPE MAYBE NOT IN THIS LINE. WILL TRY GOLD ONE.</li>
    <li> My hair is very dry and damaged and this conditioner has worked well for me. It was recommended by my hair dresser. I would recommend it.</li>
    <li> My thin low porosity hair is much stronger and is finally growing. Once a month with a heat cap does miracles! My new staple. Love love love the smell</li>
    <li> I Love this conditioner, it really makes hair soft, smooth and strong! I would recommend this product to every one!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried this product before.. Its great. But this seller got it to me the very next day after I ordered it. Amazing. Thank You Deva Concepts</li>
    <li> My hair was severely damaged.  This product has turned my damaged hair into beautiful, shiny healthy looking hair.  Very happy with this product.</li>
    <li> I use this product every day because it softens and helps smooth some of the damage done by weather, foiling and curling.</li>
    <li> I alternate Redken Shot phase and phix phase with Redken extreme strength builder for deep conditioning every Sunday night and I have totally noticed thicker, fuller looking, longer hair.  For daily shampooing and conditioning I use United hair products.  I am a hair product junkie since I straighten and blow dry my hair daily so anything that will help me keep hair on my head I have used and so far United and Redken have been doing the trick.  This product smells so amazing and will not leave your hair feeling weighed down and sticky like some other deep conditioners.  I leave this in for longer than stated in directions, about 30 minutes and rinse well.</li>
    <li> I really did not like this product at all. I am a fan of the Redken Anti-Snap, so I figured I&#x27;d like this for added strength to my hair. I absolutely hated this. I used it the first time and it seemed as though I&#x27;d lost more hair than usual when I went to style it. I pulled out at least double the strands than would normally. And it didn&#x27;t last just in the morning, as it seemed to be an all day occurrence. I thought that maybe it was just a one time thing, so I&#x27;ve used it twice since for a total of three times and the same thing kept happening. I&#x27;ll stick with their Anti-Snap, but this particular product is going right in the garbage. Do not waste your money.</li>
    <li> Smells great, very effective</li>
    <li> This stuff is great for over processed hair. If you blow dry and use curling tools I highly recommend to keep hair from Heat damage</li>
    <li> Just a regular hair mask, nothing crazy.</li>
    <li> I have baby fine bleached hair and I wanted a strong conditioner.  I found this one to be too heavy and it felt like a coating was left on my hair even after a good rinse.</li>
    <li> A stylist at a higher end solon recommended this to me. This may be the most important product I use to keep my hair healthy. I keep it in overnight and use it one to two times weekly. My hair is super fine. I dye my hair blonde, wash it, heat style it, and spray it with hairspray daily. This is my miracle cure for all I do to damage it. I&#x27;ve been using it for about four months now and my hair has never looked or felt healthier.</li>
    <li> This product seems to work very well for what it is designed for, however, the name is a little deceiving.  This product is designed for hair that is protein deficient, not for hair that is moisture deficient.  There is a big difference and before using this product, you should make sure you know which one your hair needs.  In my experience, most of the time my hair is dry and this product will only dry it out more.  However, I do use this a few times a month to add protein back into my hair (when it becomes ultra stretchy) and it fixes the problem right away.  I have fine, thin hair and can only use it once or twice and then I need to go back to moisturizing conditioners, as the protein tends to dry out my hair.  However, after one or two uses, my hair becomes strong again and I can go another month without needing it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave the product 4 stars because I found the name to be deceiving and it required me to do a lot of research into protein vs. moisturizer for hair, but I&#x27;d give it 5 stars for how well it works adding protein to your hair.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing! I use it once a week and my hair just feels so much healthier. A great buy.</li>
