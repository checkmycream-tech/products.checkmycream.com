      <li>Great product at an unbeatable price!</li>
      <li>Great color keeps my dyed hair looking great longer.</li>
      <li>The spring in the pump was kind of busted after shipping, but this stuff is great.</li>
      <li>This is an excellent conditioner to keep your color fresh and bright.  </li>
      <li>Very easy to use.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s always the most beautiful the first week or so, then starts fading.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a great alternative to dying my hair so often, and it&#x27;s very conditioning.</li>
      <li>It gives you an amazing rich color.</li>
      <li>Easy to use.  </li>
      <li>wonders and my color always looks bright, never dull.</li>
      <li>Intense color but stains easily.</li>
      <li>I also would advise to make sure you rinse really well or your scalp will be vibrant as well.</li>
      <li>VERY intense burgundy.</li>
      <li>Also, make sure you have time when applying bc you will have to rinse for a loooong time, if you don&#x27;t rinse til water is no longer red, your scalp may be stained.</li>
      <li>The result is shiny, healthy hair that has a boost of red.  </li>
      <li>This conditioner is amazing in all but the mess it can create.</li>
      <li>But I really like it.</li>
      <li>and this is the only product that has actually kept the color looking fresh while giving it a healthy conditioning.  </li>
      <li>I mixed some of each with the corresponding sulfate free color preserving shampoo and conditioner and</li>
      <li>my color looks fantastic 2 months later.</li>
      <li>Granted, it&#x27;s not the same color I got done at the salon, but it is a fabulous color in itself.</li>
      <li>Only precaution: immediately wash hands, scrub nails, and clean tub and basin afterward, as it stains.</li>
      <li>It does bring some color back into red hair and leaves the hair feeling clean and soft.</li>
      <li>Red color fades fast anyway and my hair just doesn&#x27;t hold color well.</li>
      <li>It also can stain your hands a bit so after the first time I used it I wore medical gloves the next time I used it.</li>
      <li>Very messy - be careful, it seems to stain even more than actual dyes that I use.</li>

<li> I&#x27;ll wash my hair, then put a couple of pumps of this in and let it sit for a few minutes while doing the rest of my shower routine, then rinse.  </li>
<li> this was broken and leaking in the bag</li>

    <li> VERY intense burgundy. My bathtub mat and my white towels are all stained pink now. Beware of dying your scalp.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent conditioner to keep your color fresh and bright.  However,  it is not very moisturizing.  To combat, I add a dollop of EVO with a dollop of my regular color protection conditioner and combine in my hand and apply to my hair.&lt;br /&gt;Works wonders and my color always looks bright, never dull.</li>
    <li> Very messy - be careful, it seems to stain even more than actual dyes that I use. But I really like it. It&#x27;s a great alternative to dying my hair so often, and it&#x27;s very conditioning.</li>
    <li> Very easy to use.  No plastic cap required.  Tones down orange, conditions, and revives red color.  Only precaution: immediately wash hands, scrub nails, and clean tub and basin afterward, as it stains.</li>
    <li> this was broken and leaking in the bag</li>
    <li> This product gives VIBRANT color so a little goes a long way. It also can stain your hands a bit so after the first time I used it I wore medical gloves the next time I used it. I also would advise to make sure you rinse really well or your scalp will be vibrant as well.</li>
    <li> The spring in the pump was kind of busted after shipping, but this stuff is great. Keeps my dyed red hair very red for very long.</li>
    <li> I have dark purple-red hair color; as expected, it faded to a blah brassy red within a week and a half. After spending $120 at the salon, I couldn&#x27;t justify going back so soon. I ordered this, and the Tressa Watercolors (in Crimson Splash). I mixed some of each with the corresponding sulfate free color preserving shampoo and conditioner and my color looks fantastic 2 months later. Granted, it&#x27;s not the same color I got done at the salon, but it is a fabulous color in itself. I wash my hair every other day with this.</li>
    <li> Great product at an unbeatable price!</li>
    <li> Every Fall I start coloring my hair red. It&#x27;s always the most beautiful the first week or so, then starts fading. Red color fades fast anyway and my hair just doesn&#x27;t hold color well. So I saw an ad for this product and decided to try it. It gives you an amazing rich color. It&#x27;s so color intensive that you have to wash your hands immediately after using it because it will stain your hands red if you don&#x27;t. It deposits color, but doesn&#x27;t cause any damage. I will be using it whenever my hair is red.</li>
    <li> This conditioner is amazing in all but the mess it can create. It does bring some color back into red hair and leaves the hair feeling clean and soft. But it stains EVERYTHING it comes into contact with so just be careful.</li>
    <li> Easy to use.  Doesn&#x27;t damage the hair.  I get one compliment after another.</li>
    <li> I have been dying my hair auburn for years and this is the only product that has actually kept the color looking fresh while giving it a healthy conditioning.  I use it once a week.  I&#x27;ll wash my hair, then put a couple of pumps of this in and let it sit for a few minutes while doing the rest of my shower routine, then rinse.  The result is shiny, healthy hair that has a boost of red.  This product keeps my color in the copper-red family, as opposed to purple-red.  I wash my hair daily and I think it slowly washes out, usually lasting about 4 days.</li>
    <li> Great color keeps my dyed hair looking great longer.</li>
    <li> It does brighten and makes hair red but it gets everywhere and, in my opinion, made my hair too orangey. Also, make sure you have time when applying bc you will have to rinse for a loooong time, if you don&#x27;t rinse til water is no longer red, your scalp may be stained.</li>
    <li> Intense color but stains easily. If it came with gloves I would have rated it 5 stars.</li>
