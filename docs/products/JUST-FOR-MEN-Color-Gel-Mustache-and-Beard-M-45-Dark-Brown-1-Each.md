<li> There is enough gel for multiple applications, usually around 3-4 total, depending on how much hair you have to cover.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> It works as advertised, but doesn&#x27;t last very long.  </li>
<li> It did cover the grey though.</li>
<li> No one knows I die my grey eyebrows with this gel.</li>
<li> recommend to anyone with grey or multicolored beards who want to look younger&lt;</li>
<li> For a darker brown, I usually leave the application on for a total of 8-10 minutes (the instructions recommend 5).</li>

<li> However, I have always admired the look of dark pubic hair on other men in the locker room and have always wanted to have that look for myself.</li>
<li> One thing about being blonde is that the carpet does match the drapes, at least in my case.</li>
<li> and it was almost black.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve been using this stuff for at least 10 years...</li>
<li> Not sure why that one guy had a bad skin reaction, but I guess all skin is different.</li>
<li> Sorry to that one guy, but they do tell you in the package to test a spot on your arm for 48 hours before using on your face.</li>

    <li> Not sure why that one guy had a bad skin reaction, but I guess all skin is different. I&#x27;ve been using this stuff for at least 10 years...about once a month. I have NEVER had a bad reaction to it, and it works great.</li>
    <li> Ok know u are not supposed to use for other things BUT this works great on my very blonde eyebrows. I have used for years and love it, yes I am a female.</li>
    <li> No one knows I die my grey eyebrows with this gel. The best way is to snip off the cotton from a cotton swab and mix the&lt;br /&gt;two dabs of gel in the tray and apply carefully.  Then after 5 minutes wipe off with paper towel and some liquid soap.&lt;br /&gt;If you use the cotton the gel mushed all over the eyebrow.</li>
    <li> So my beard grew in blonde in spots making for Patchy McBeardy. With super dark beard I wasn&#x27;t to concerned with the actual shade, but leaving on for longer than the recommended 5 minutes did make for practically black beard. I was also worried about rash/irritation since some sunscreens make me all red and burny. Didn&#x27;t have any problems with this though. Sorry to that one guy, but they do tell you in the package to test a spot on your arm for 48 hours before using on your face. The only downside is a little hair dye smell that goes away after a few washes. Good riddance Patchy, you will not be missed.</li>
    <li> Wow so easy so well priced so easy to use.</li>
    <li> One thing about being blonde is that the carpet does match the drapes, at least in my case. I have always had light pubic hair, which matches the rest of my body hair. Not a bad look if you like it. However, I have always admired the look of dark pubic hair on other men in the locker room and have always wanted to have that look for myself. After trying this product, I have definitely found the look that I&#x27;ve always wanted. I&#x27;m in my early 30&#x27;s and have been using this product for almost a year now with incredible results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All you do is brush in the 2 part gel, let set, rinse out with warm water, then wash the area with soap as normal. For a darker brown, I usually leave the application on for a total of 8-10 minutes (the instructions recommend 5). The color lasts a while but does begin to fade at around 6 weeks. I usually reapply after 4 weeks to maintain a my ideal look. There is enough gel for multiple applications, usually around 3-4 total, depending on how much hair you have to cover.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a great product despite the many people who experience an allergic reaction to hair dye products. If you do experience a severe reaction, stop using the product. If you do not experience a reaction, you&#x27;ll love the result. If you have always wanted darker pubic hair or if you have started to go gray, give this product a try. You won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
    <li> Just For Men Brush-In Color Mustache &amp; Beard, Dark Brown- $ 10.17 with Free shipping is not bad for this product, yes you can save yourself a little somewhere like wally world but by the time I drive there and back it averages out. I usually throw this in on some order I make from Amazon when I don&#x27;t need it right at the moment. It&#x27;s pretty simple here once you find the color you like as I cannot stand grey in my facial hair and this stuff covers it. Easy cleanup and last about 3-4 weeks depending on the length and how fast your hair grows but I do agree with most here set a timer for 5 minutes and wash it out after that as it gets DARK DARK after that. I also did not have any reactions to using it nor did I have any staining on the face. I am happy with the product!</li>
    <li> This stuff is the bomb, easy to use.  People that say it is a one time are just stupid.  I squeeze out amount I need and cap it keeping excess air in tube.  I get 4-6 colors from each box which last 4-6 weeks.  Color stays longer if I do once every 1-2 weeks as opposed to letting it all go gray.  I only use blonde though on myself, but bought this to touch up wifes roots which this stuff works great for stubborn gray.</li>
    <li> Worked as advertised. Pleasantly surprised.</li>
    <li> I bought this to use for tinting my eyebrows and it works great. I love that the dye is reusable, it lasts for a long time.</li>
    <li> works great&lt;br /&gt;will purchase again. recommend to anyone with grey or multicolored beards who want to look younger&lt;br /&gt;reasonably priced</li>
    <li> This is great stuff - you can play with the timing aspect and come out with a great color that will represent your age range. An awesome product.</li>
    <li> Does what it is supposed to do.</li>
    <li> This product works great.</li>
    <li> I have dark ash brown hair naturally and let me tell you, don&#x27;t leave it on for more than 5min. I left on for 10 min and it was almost black. It did cover the grey though. I am going to just hit the Grey areas next time and not put it all over first and just leave on for 5 mins.</li>
    <li> It works as advertised, but doesn&#x27;t last very long.  Also, follow the directions carefully or you will end up staining your counter top, towels, etc.</li>
