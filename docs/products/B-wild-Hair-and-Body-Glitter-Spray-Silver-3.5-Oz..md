      <li>but the delivery was excellent and I have full faith that this glitter will be awesome when I do get to use it.</li>
      <li>The odor is pleasant but it would clash with any perfume I choose to wear.  </li>
      <li>This product did not smell good and was a bit pricey.</li>
      <li>I bought this product for a fairy costume, after reading the reviews I decided to apply the spray right before entering to the banquet hall (parking garage) and it was the greatest idea.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad I got it in time for that!</li>
      <li>and you couldn&#x27;t feel that it was on you which I really liked.</li>
      <li>I love</li>
      <li>I found another brand that was better from Wal-Mart for $3 and smelled much better.</li>
      <li>We did spray this outside to avoid getting it on anything indoors and it worked perfectly.</li>
      <li>I spray it in the air and then walk under it, for a more finished look.  </li>
      <li>This product came to me after I paid more for the shipping than the product alone.</li>
      <li>so make sure you do not breathe while applying and step out of the cloud after.</li>

      <li>but it&#x27;s cool.</li>
      <li>i use for taking pictures and its definately cool</li>
      <li>Make sure that you spray it either outside or in a room without carpet.</li>
      <li>It covered very well and was very noticeable.</li>
      <li>worked really well - put it on my daughter&#x27;s hair for costume.</li>
      <li>Both showed the glitter very well.</li>
      <li>The spray is very shinny, I sprayed my hair, arms and dress and stayed all night, some of the guest also used the spray can and the nozzle never got clogged.  </li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t see the shimmer in my hair unless I look very carefully in the light.  </li>
      <li>It stayed on as long as I wanted it to, and then it washed right off.</li>
      <li>I was completely covered in glitter, and so is my bathroom, and my car...</li>
      <li>but put a little hair spray on top to hold it if you use it on your hair or it falls off down onto your face and clothes.</li>

<li> I don&#x27;t spray it directly on as this will give you an uneven look.  </li>
<li> I used this product once to test it to see if it worked aright and it did, but the next time i went to use it the press down part wouldn&#x27;t spray it would just leak out the side.</li>
<li> When you want to have that extra pizzazz, just sprinkle on a little glitter.  </li>
<li> I am not really keen on this product at all.</li>
<li> This  was a total waste of time and money.</li>
<li> My jacket and car seat had glitter on it for a little bit.</li>
<li> it you just want it to shimmer without it being stiff like that glitter hairsprays make it.</li>
<li> Not a happy camper!</li>
<li> /&gt;I was very disappointed as I was looking forward to glitter.</li>

    <li> I haven&#x27;t worn this out anywhere yet but plan to wear to the Renaissance Faires in my area as a fairie or elf.  This will also be great at holiday parties.  I&#x27;m glad I got it in time for that!</li>
    <li> I used this product once to test it to see if it worked aright and it did, but the next time i went to use it the press down part wouldn&#x27;t spray it would just leak out the side.</li>
    <li> The product arrived on time however, I used it twice and by the third time it no longer sprayed. The glitter gets clogged in the nozzle and it doesn&#x27;t come out. I wanted to use it for my wedding, but had to find something else to compromise.</li>
    <li> This product came to me after I paid more for the shipping than the product alone. When I rexieved the product I ssprayed the can once and the button got stuck and all tgis product leaked out and I did not get to use this at. This  was a total waste of time and money. Not a happy camper! bought this similar product at the grocery store in the isle of the holiday party makers!!!!</li>
    <li> LOVED IT!  When you want to have that extra pizzazz, just sprinkle on a little glitter.  I don&#x27;t spray it directly on as this will give you an uneven look.  I spray it in the air and then walk under it, for a more finished look.  EVERYONE loves it when I &amp;#34;sparkle.&amp;#34;  A must for those special occasions!</li>
    <li> Good product! Sprays silver glitter everywhere just used noxious fumes so make sure you do not breathe while applying and step out of the cloud after.</li>
    <li> perfect for my daughters dance competition!</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t actually had a chance to use it but the delivery was excellent and I have full faith that this glitter will be awesome when I do get to use it.</li>
    <li> Beautiful! but put a little hair spray on top to hold it if you use it on your hair or it falls off down onto your face and clothes.</li>
    <li> Love the glutter...but has a weird perfume smell</li>
    <li> Very good I love it.&lt;br /&gt;Ochen haroshiy blesk.&lt;br /&gt;Coke guzel.&lt;br /&gt;Juda yahshi.&lt;br /&gt;helli hub.&lt;br /&gt;Ziyaba achcha.</li>
    <li> This product did not smell good and was a bit pricey. I found another brand that was better from Wal-Mart for $3 and smelled much better. Both showed the glitter very well.</li>
    <li> by the time i got this it was almost all leaked all over the box it didnt even stay on the body im never purchasing this ever again</li>
    <li> I purchased this glitter spray for a Ke$ha concert, :D. I was completely covered in glitter, and so is my bathroom, and my car... but it&#x27;s cool. It stayed on as long as I wanted it to, and then it washed right off. Yay sparkles...</li>
    <li> this is a great spray for the face,body and hair i use for taking pictures and its definately cool i have gotten the silver and gold and the have 1 with both in one i spray on my wigs also can comb out great product sprays on lightly not heavy a mist of glitter</li>
    <li> I bought this glitter my body as regular glitter doesnt hold as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I tried to spray the tin, the nozzel did not work and spurs of liquid sprayed out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was very disappointed as I was looking forward to glitter.</li>
    <li> worked really well - put it on my daughter&#x27;s hair for costume.</li>
    <li> Perfect for my daughter&#x27;s dance recital.  Lots of sparkles.  We did spray this outside to avoid getting it on anything indoors and it worked perfectly.</li>
    <li> Just glitter. Looks great for a very short time then falls off. Wish there was something in the spray to make it stick.</li>
    <li> I bought this product for a fairy costume, after reading the reviews I decided to apply the spray right before entering to the banquet hall (parking garage) and it was the greatest idea.  The spray is very shinny, I sprayed my hair, arms and dress and stayed all night, some of the guest also used the spray can and the nozzle never got clogged.  Very happy with my purchase.  Will definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t see the shimmer in my hair unless I look very carefully in the light.  Also it does tend to go all over when you spray it so if you are dressed for an occasion you should wear something over your dress before you spray.  You have to shake it A LOT and then shake it some more or else you get no glitter.  The odor is pleasant but it would clash with any perfume I choose to wear.  I am not really keen on this product at all.</li>
    <li> I bought this for Halloween and it worked great! It stuck well to my skin and you couldn&#x27;t feel that it was on you which I really liked. It covered very well and was very noticeable. Make sure that you spray it either outside or in a room without carpet. It does go everywhere but easily came up with a swiffer sweeper. Some of the glitter does come off when your skin makes contact with something. My jacket and car seat had glitter on it for a little bit. It also works well in hair it you just want it to shimmer without it being stiff like that glitter hairsprays make it.</li>
    <li> Was perfect for my daughter&#x27;s dance competition!</li>
