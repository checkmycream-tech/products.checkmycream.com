      <li>It also felt great on my scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Awesome brush for s smooth blow out!  </li>
      <li>/&gt;After drying and letting my hair set a bit, I fluffed it a bit more with my hands, rearranging a bang or whatever to a very attractive smooth do!</li>
      <li>And, the bristles are great - not too many and my hair never gets tangled in it.</li>
      <li>love this brush!</li>
      <li>Nice, lightweight brush.</li>
      <li>this speeds up my drying time and gives that nice rounded look to the bottom of my hair.  </li>

      <li>Nice quality product.</li>
      <li>When I tried to use this brush on my own hair, I found that it kind of floated over the top and made it tangle and snarl my hair.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Things to like:&lt;br /&gt;- One-piece handle construction is pretty great.  </li>
      <li>don’t generally use brushes because of the thickness of my hair – working a comb through it in the shower is about the best it gets – and I never use a blow dryer.  </li>

      <li>/&gt;Disclaimer: I received this brush for free via the Amazon Vine program in exchange for posting my honest opinion.</li>

      <li>static</li>
      <li>I would like there to be a bit more grip so it would be easier to manage.  </li>
      <li>It is an OK brush, better made than Conair or Goody drug store brands.  </li>
      <li>Barrel is the perfect size for long bangs (I have the 4 ounce</li>
      <li>Able to unwind easily too.</li>
      <li>and she has tried so many things to get it as smooth as she prefers.</li>
      <li>My hair doesn&#x27;t get tangled in it and it lightweight and easy to hold.&lt;br</li>
      <li>It is easy to straighten and roll my hair under.</li>

      <li>-- I have A LOT of really fine hair) without creating a rat&#x27;s nest of tangles.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It did not tangle my fine</li>
      <li>I have fine hair, it is shoulder length</li>
      <li>This Smooth Operator doesn&#x27;t have that seam, and doesn&#x27;t snag on my hair.  </li>
      <li>If I use a smoothing product my hair dries smoothly, but without the product, this brush doesn&#x27;t seem to make a difference in texture</li>
      <li>Appears sturdy and holds the hair securely.</li>
      <li>Her preferred hair style is smooth with the ends curled either up in a flip or under in an all one length bobbed</li>
      <li>/&gt;After applying a light styling product, this is what I liked:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>/&gt;It is lightweight and comfortable to hold.</li>
      <li>It worked it&#x27;s smoothly thru with out pulling.  </li>
      <li>Initially she laughed when she saw the brush as she was thinking it was more suited to brush erm a dog&#x27;s hair.</li>
      <li>This brush is great for maintaing long, fine hair.</li>
      <li>Have been using with blow dryer or alone, effective particularly for shaping bangs and taming frizz.  </li>
      <li>Using this brush with argan oil is a great way to smooth curly, dry hair that tends to frizz</li>
      <li>hair was smooth and full after drying.  </li>
      <li>full time.&lt;br</li>
      <li>and I was concerned about the barrel becoming too hot and burning my scalp or skin accidentally.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This brush is perfect for my thick, curly shoulder length hair.</li>
      <li>This brush is super light weight which is awesome because a lot of barrel brushes are large and heavy.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It goes through wet hair easily, the barrel design allows good air flow and heats to speed drying.</li>
      <li>Super comfy to hold</li>
      <li>but the design of this barrel that heats up quickly dries the hair without damaging it.</li>
      <li>It is great for use on my straight coarse hair while blow drying.</li>
      <li>On the plus side, the ceramic did heat up quickly and got very hot.</li>
      <li>Avoid skin contact with the barrel, as it is very hot.</li>
      <li>Not even my fine straight hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Spornette Large Smooth Operator, 4 Ounce&lt;</li>
      <li>I like the Spornette Smooth Operator because it takes about 15 minutes to dry my towel dried hair using the Smooth Operator and my tourmaline dryer and my hair looks great!  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s the little things that make me happy.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t get caught on my strands which is important because I want to avoid breakage as much as possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>/&gt;This is actually so much better than my old brush that I stuck that one in a drawer for emergency use</li>
      <li>The handle is just the right size and shape.</li>
      <li>They liked using it and found that it was helpful in styling her medium long hair.</li>
      <li>/&gt;The bristled hair is great as it does not gather grime as her regular hairbrush (which she has to constantly wash).</li>
      <li>But when I have used it to blow out my hair, it gets it super straight without taking out all the body.</li>
      <li>I have long, fine straight hair and honestly this brush didn&#x27;t really seem to do much for my hair.</li>
      <li>The bristles are firm but comfortable and it&#x27;s very easy to use.</li>
      <li>I really like this brush and will recommend it to others!</li>
      <li>because the core does get hot, and I was not paying attention.).</li>
      <li>The brush is the perfect size - not too big, not too small.</li>
      <li>Color is pretty</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very easy to brush through wet hair.</li>
      <li>I really love the spornette large smooth operator round brush.</li>
      <li>After the first time I used this I noticed that I was going to love this brush to dry my hair.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a fun POP in the midst of all the neutral colors of other hair supplies I have. :)</li>
      <li>Its metal barrel heats up and dries the hair while the dryer blows heat to dry from the top.</li>
      <li>This is a plus when you are trying to get out the door fast.</li>
      <li>that has worked smoothly and not left my hair a tangled mess.&lt;br</li>
      <li>so I will give this away to someone with much, much longer hair.  </li>
      <li>But it also really fried my hair.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>my hair looked very shiny.</li>
      <li>The bristles pull through my hair with ease, and left my hair looking ultra smooth.  </li>
      <li>my waist length, straight hair, drying was a lot faster, and combined with argan oil-</li>
      <li>hair is fine but full, shoulder length, and heavily highlighted.&lt;br</li>
      <li>and you hair will end up sleek and smooth without needing to use a flat iron afterwards.&lt;br</li>
      <li>The Spornette 3&amp;#34; Smooth Operator brush cut my drying time in half and left my hair soft, silky smooth and super shiny.  </li>
      <li>The handle is long and comfortable for control.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;d say skip this brush, and look around for something a little more gentle.  </li>
      <li>It was a little large for my superfine hair, but definitely helped smooth frizz.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not really designed for people like me who have fairly smooth</li>
      <li>It produced a modern soft look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I picked this up because my sister in-law has it.  Here, an inexpensive roll brush makes quick work of drying my very thick hair.  It is easy to straighten and roll my hair under.</li>
    <li> Spornette Large Smooth Operator, 4 Ounce&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave this to my mom, who I care for and her aide to use to do her hair. They liked using it and found that it was helpful in styling her medium long hair. I noticed some bristles were missing as holes in the head of the brush were empty and looked like they shouldn’t be. It’s a nice brush but quality control may be an issue.</li>
    <li> I use a similar brush, and figured I&#x27;d give this one a try.  If you want really straight hair just from a blow dry, this is the brush for you.  But it also really fried my hair.&lt;br /&gt;I have long, wavy hair.  I use an Ionizing brush to straighten my hair normally.  This brush has a coated metal barrel that heats up while applying a blow dryer to it.  So obviously it gets hot.  However, it left my hair lank and lacking volume, and somehow frizzier than my regular drying brush.  I let my hair dry naturally whenever I can, but prefer a smoother look for work and when I know I&#x27;m going somewhere and want to look neater.  This brush frustrated me, since I felt like it really just damaged my hair and didn&#x27;t do much for the style.  There are better brushes out there that don&#x27;t get as crazy hot and help your hair look shinier and healthier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;d say skip this brush, and look around for something a little more gentle.  I really feel this brush is way too harsh for any hair.</li>
    <li> I have fine hair, it is shoulder length and I like to round brush my hair for volume and smoothness.  I do have a natural wave to my hair, which if left unsettled is a frizzy mess.  The brush doens&#x27;t look all that fancy, synthetic bristles on a round core.  The core does heat up...this speeds up my drying time and gives that nice rounded look to the bottom of my hair.  The handle is long and comfortable for control.  I thought perhaps the bristles might cause a snagging issue with my hair type.  After 30 some odd uses I have yet to snag or snarl my hair. (I did burn my ear once ...because the core does get hot, and I was not paying attention.). I use this in conjunction with a hair dryer, I&#x27;m happy with the results.</li>
    <li> The brush is lightweight and definitely helps dry hair.  It does not tangle hair as it is sparse regarding bristles.  I would like there to be a bit more grip so it would be easier to manage.  I had to keep putting the blow dryer down in order to manipulate my hair around the brush.  Other brushes are easier for me to handle but they don&#x27;t help hair dry faster like this one does.</li>
    <li> 3 inch diameter means for medium-long to long hair.  I have short hair so I will give this away to someone with much, much longer hair.  It is an OK brush, better made than Conair or Goody drug store brands.  This one is more &amp;#34;Pro&amp;#34; and lightweight, not decorative at all.</li>
    <li> Using this brush with argan oil is a great way to smooth curly, dry hair that tends to frizz easily.&lt;br /&gt;It goes through wet hair easily, the barrel design allows good air flow and heats to speed drying. The base of the brush part where it meets the handle doesn&#x27;t grab hair. Not even my fine straight hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For my waist length, straight hair, drying was a lot faster, and combined with argan oil- my hair looked very shiny. Curling the ends was beyond my dexterity though. It&#x27;s not really designed for people like me who have fairly smooth hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My daughter on the other hand has hair that tends to be dry, it&#x27;s very thick and a bit coarse, and full of loose curls and waves that fluff and frizz at nearly any change in the weather. It&#x27;s shoulder length and she has tried so many things to get it as smooth as she prefers. Her preferred hair style is smooth with the ends curled either up in a flip or under in an all one length bobbed cut.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This works great on her hair. I&#x27;ll continue using it for those rare times that I blow out my hair, but she&#x27;s going to use the brush regularly. It just does the job easily, and leaves her with the nice, smooth, non-frizzy or fluffy style she likes in a lot less time with less damage than drying and using a straightening iron.</li>
    <li> I have long, fine straight hair and honestly this brush didn&#x27;t really seem to do much for my hair. On the plus side, the ceramic did heat up quickly and got very hot. Also, I didn&#x27;t notice any extra frizz compared to my usual routine. On the negative, although the brush didn&#x27;t tangle my hair around the handle, it did seem to create small tangles/knots near the ends of my hair when brushing. The brush feels sturdy without being heavy and I didn&#x27;t see any missing bristles so it appears to be well constructed. Choosing a brush is fairly individual and while this one may work for others, it&#x27;s just not a perfect fit for my hair type.</li>
    <li> OMGoodness this brush is unbelievably awesome!  I am Latina and have thick long naturally curly hair.  The Spornette 3&amp;#34; Smooth Operator brush cut my drying time in half and left my hair soft, silky smooth and super shiny.  The bristles took hold of my hair and keeps it taunt without snagging or tangling.  The Ceramic barrel allows the hair to glide through the brush easily while the barrel actually heats up evenly allowing the Tourmaline bristles to release negative ions to close the hair follicles to a smooth finish.  I also want to mention that it leaves my hair static free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can actually have the same results as if you used a flat iron.  Apply a smoothing serum/heat protective product like Aragan oil before blow drying and you hair will end up sleek and smooth without needing to use a flat iron afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is lightweight and comfortable to hold.</li>
    <li> This brush is perfect for my thick, curly shoulder length hair. Its metal barrel heats up and dries the hair while the dryer blows heat to dry from the top. The brush is the perfect size - not too big, not too small. And, the bristles are great - not too many and my hair never gets tangled in it. It&#x27;s reduced my drying time!</li>
    <li> This brush is huge! Almost the size of my wife&#x27;s face or about 3/4. Initially she laughed when she saw the brush as she was thinking it was more suited to brush erm a dog&#x27;s hair. But she changed her mind after using this brush to dry out her long hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although she would like to have the brush slightly smaller, the large brush helps her pull her hair out and dries it much faster than her regular brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bristled hair is great as it does not gather grime as her regular hairbrush (which she has to constantly wash).</li>
    <li> Appears sturdy and holds the hair securely. Able to unwind easily too.</li>
    <li> I had backed away from metal based brushes due to the excessive heat and the way the bristles treated my hair.  I had a chance to test this brush.  My hair is below my shoulders.  It is mostly gray so I have at least my roots done every 4 weeks and high/low lights most of the time.  After the first time I used this I noticed that I was going to love this brush to dry my hair.  It worked it&#x27;s smoothly thru with out pulling.  The end result was a nice finish. I&#x27;m keeping this one.</li>
    <li> When I saw this brush, I thought it was something new and special.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don’t generally use brushes because of the thickness of my hair – working a comb through it in the shower is about the best it gets – and I never use a blow dryer.  When I tried to use this brush on my own hair, I found that it kind of floated over the top and made it tangle and snarl my hair.  It was not able to penetrate my hair to brush it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried this brush on my granddaughter to not much better ends, even though her hair is silky and smooth.</li>
    <li> I am quite satisfied with this brush.  Have been using with blow dryer or alone, effective particularly for shaping bangs and taming frizz.  Nice quality product.</li>
    <li> I needed to replace my old round brush, and this one met my needs. It is great for use on my straight coarse hair while blow drying. So far, stray hairs aren&#x27;t getting stuck around the barrel either, which was a problem with my old brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, I know it doesn&#x27;t add to the function, but I love the color. It&#x27;s a fun POP in the midst of all the neutral colors of other hair supplies I have. :)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a big fan of this brush and its construction - I have one trusty brush I&#x27;ve used for years on my bangs to get them just perfect and it has all sorts of hair wrapped around the barrel.  After using this brush twice, I threw away that trusty old brush and switched over to this one full time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Things to like:&lt;br /&gt;- One-piece handle construction is pretty great.  My hair doesn&#x27;t get tangled in it and it lightweight and easy to hold.&lt;br /&gt;- Color is pretty (yay for red instead of pastels).&lt;br /&gt;- Barrel is the perfect size for long bangs (I have the 4 ounce size)&lt;br /&gt;- Super comfy to hold&lt;br /&gt;- Barrel has open slots to dry hair quickly&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t have anything not to like.  I&#x27;ve tried a few different brushes from Ulta in an attempt to replace my old brush, but this one is the first to replace it!</li>
    <li> Great brush! I&#x27;d been looking for one when this appeared on the review list.  They sent me the 3&amp;#34; size which is a little big (I now have short hair) but works really well. The bristles are firm but comfortable and it&#x27;s very easy to use. The handle is just the right size and shape. Definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Nice, lightweight brush. It was a little large for my superfine hair, but definitely helped smooth frizz. I would buy again, but a smaller barrel.</li>
    <li> This brush is great for maintaing long, fine hair. The ceramic barrel quickly absorbs heat from hair dryer and helps dry long hair. Avoid skin contact with the barrel, as it is very hot.</li>
    <li> When I received this Spornette hair drying brush, I did not expect to like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was bigger than ones I had used, had odd little &#x60;sticks&#x27; to grasp the hair and I was concerned about the barrel becoming too hot and burning my scalp or skin accidentally.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair is fine but full, shoulder length, and heavily highlighted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After having used this brush I find I like it very much and will probably order a smaller size as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After applying a light styling product, this is what I liked:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It facilitated drying my hair faster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I did not feel any excessive heat from its barrel...actually it was not even noticeable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair was smooth and full after drying.  It produced a modern soft look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It did not tangle my fine hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t believe that the bristles will cause any breakage of my hair strands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After drying and letting my hair set a bit, I fluffed it a bit more with my hands, rearranging a bang or whatever to a very attractive smooth do!</li>
    <li> I love this brush for a few reasons. One is the handle which, as advertised, is a single piece that doesn&#x27;t catch and pull hairs.  Another is the bristles themselves. They are rather short and firm, which helps to smooth out my hair while massaging my scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve been using it to give my hair a sleek, pulled back look. In coordination with a good styling product, it gives my normally overly curly/frizzy hair a nice put-together look even without blowdrying. But when I have used it to blow out my hair, it gets it super straight without taking out all the body. The barrel is big enough that I can get all of my hair done in probably about ten minutes, which is a very short time frame for me.</li>
    <li> I have very long hair.  I like the Spornette Smooth Operator because it takes about 15 minutes to dry my towel dried hair using the Smooth Operator and my tourmaline dryer and my hair looks great!  My Spornette is the largest one and gives a very smooth sculpted result.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Supposedly the handle is designed so that hair doesn&#x27;t get wrapped around it.  I&#x27;ve not had that problem, but I have gotten hair stuck in the bristles.  That&#x27;s not a deal breaker; the amount of hair involved was insignificant, but did deserve a mention.  I&#x27;ve not had a problem with the brush getting too hot, but I&#x27;m very careful, too.</li>
    <li> My hair is about 2-3&amp;#34; above my shoulders, medium thickness, with layers.  If I had looked at this brush in person before ordering, I might have chosen a slightly smaller size, but this one is workable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been using this brush to blow dry my hair, focusing on the roots, and I can tell that it&#x27;s helped create volume.  I can feel that the brush heats up as I use it- not in an uncomfortable way, but enough that I can feel a bit of warmth with my hand.  I&#x27;m sure that the heated barrel speeds the drying process along, but my hair only takes a few minutes to dry normally, so I can&#x27;t really gauge how much of a difference that makes.  If I use a smoothing product my hair dries smoothly, but without the product, this brush doesn&#x27;t seem to make a difference in texture and I still need my flat iron.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had hoped to be able to use this on my 11 year-old daughter&#x27;s long, wavy hair, to help it dry faster, but that&#x27;s not possible.  The bristles on this brush snag the hair and turn it into a tangled knot.  I think it&#x27;s best suited to a cut and hair texture like mine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disclaimer: I received this brush for free via the Amazon Vine program in exchange for posting my honest opinion.</li>
    <li> I really love the spornette large smooth operator round brush. You wouldn&#x27;t think it would be evolutionary to create a brush that has a seamless handle BUT IT IS! This is the first round brush I have owned (and I literally have three others in my drawer right now) that has worked smoothly and not left my hair a tangled mess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have always been in awe of the blowout I get from my hairdresser when she uses a round brush and have bought several different kinds with different types of bristles and barrel diameters and have never achieved the same results. But this brush makes me feel like a pro. It glides easily through my hair (which is long  -- down to the middle of my back, and plentiful -- I have A LOT of really fine hair) without creating a rat&#x27;s nest of tangles. My fine hair typically ends up frizzy if I don&#x27;t use a lot of product to tame it and some brushes create more frizz but the design of this barrel that heats up quickly dries the hair without damaging it. When I was finished, in half of my normal drying time, my hair was soft, had a nice curl to it, and my arm wasn&#x27;t exhausted from trying to fight with the brush, my hair, and blow dryer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wholeheartedly recommend.</li>
    <li> Awesome brush for s smooth blow out!  Great price.</li>
    <li> This brush is super light weight which is awesome because a lot of barrel brushes are large and heavy. I use this to dry my mid back length hair. It&#x27;s very easy to brush through wet hair. It doesn&#x27;t get caught on my strands which is important because I want to avoid breakage as much as possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I&#x27;m brushing it through my hair, the blow dryer heats up the barrel of the brush which actually gets my hair drier faster! This cuts my hair drying routine down about 8 minutes. This is a plus when you are trying to get out the door fast. I really like this brush and will recommend it to others!</li>
    <li> A brush that doesn&#x27;t snag and break my hair - thank goodness!  My previous large barrel brush was a Spornette as well, virtually identical to this Spornette Smooth Operator, but my old one had a seam with a narrow metal band where the barrel met the handle.  I tried to cover the seam with a soft scrunchie, but that seam would still find my hair, grab it, and break it.  There are dozens of broken hairs stuck in that seam.  This Smooth Operator doesn&#x27;t have that seam, and doesn&#x27;t snag on my hair.  I LOVE IT.  It&#x27;s the little things that make me happy.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m mixed race with very long, thick, wavy hair and I have to say that I&#x27;m amazed by this brush.  The bristles pull through my hair with ease, and left my hair looking ultra smooth.  I checked the brush afterward and it did not pull out a lot of strands of hair while doing it.  It also felt great on my scalp.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you use it with a blow dryer, the core heats up.  (Hot enough to style, but I didn&#x27;t burn myself at any point.) I used a little heat spray and my hair ended up looking like I had flat ironed it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This morning, I used it just for basic brushing and I was thrilled with the results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is actually so much better than my old brush that I stuck that one in a drawer for emergency use only.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this brush!</li>
