      <li>These clippers are so easy to use.  </li>
      <li>easy to use.  </li>
      <li>The product works fine and was an added asset to my basket of nail  paraphernalia.</li>
      <li>/&gt;The lower part of the blade works fine, but the tips don&#x27;t meet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>this will do the job and suit you just fine.</li>
      <li>broke after 3 uses, cheaply made</li>
      <li>They are really cheap...</li>
      <li>Was excellent until my wife used it to cut her nails, now it doesn&#x27;t seem to be as sharp as when I first got it.&lt;br /&gt;If</li>

      <li>Ok product but would be easier to handle if larger</li>
      <li>They are no cheaply made , good product for the price</li>
      <li>Came looking banged up...not sure since it traveled a long way.</li>
      <li>Cheap quality and the middle part of it snaps off the first time you use it.</li>
      <li>The middle part gets worn and breaks easily...</li>

      <li>They&#x27;re definitely stainless steel.  </li>

      <li>sharp and easy to handle</li>
      <li>These are sharp and light weight.</li>
      <li>Very sharp and clean.</li>
      <li>If you are female and like to give yourself a real manicure, not just trim hangnails, do NOT waste your money.</li>

      <li>They are worth the wait which was shorter than expected.</li>
      <li>nice weight- not too thin or light, and the blade was plenty sharp enough for cuticle nipping.</li>
      <li>I am actually a man with big hands and this product is not particularly comfortable to hold - like many, but not all, products of this type.</li>
      <li>They have completely mangled my cuticles - to the point of bleeding - even more than the broken pair I was using.</li>
      <li>clippers were not sharp and pulled the skin.  </li>
      <li>They are not precise enough to cleanly trim anything.  </li>

    <li> PERFECT, JUST WHAT I NEEDED</li>
    <li> The tip of these cuticle nippers is small and not as bulky as other models.  The blades are also quite sharp and the handles require little effort on your part to maneuver them because they&#x27;re so lightweight.  Overall, good quality cuticle nippers at a great price.</li>
    <li> I am actually a man with big hands and this product is not particularly comfortable to hold - like many, but not all, products of this type. Otherwise it is a perfectly functional cuticle clipper.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used many cuticle cutter and all worked great. But this one is dull and doesn&#x27;t cut well</li>
    <li> This product works well, but it is pretty small. I&#x27;m a guy&lt;br /&gt;and this thing pretty small in my hands, making it a little&lt;br /&gt;difficult at times to work with. This is somewhat of a personal&lt;br /&gt;preference; but it can effect your satisfaction with this tool.&lt;br /&gt;It slips sideways in my grip to often because it&#x27;s just to small.&lt;br /&gt;We&#x27;re not pruning a tree in the backyard here, so if you have&lt;br /&gt;small hands this will do the job and suit you just fine. But, if&lt;br /&gt;you going after a hang nail on one of your toes and have your&lt;br /&gt;arms fully extended to reach your toes you may find yourself&lt;br /&gt;picking this tool up off the floor a few times.</li>
    <li> These are sharp and light weight. The quality of the product appears good too (I&#x27;ve only had them a couple of weeks.) All in all, I&#x27;m really happy with a great product at such a reasonable price.</li>
    <li> Its helpful for a manicure, use a cuticle cream to help decrease and push back the cuticles, then this to nip the edges and trim... like everyone else says... this IS about 1/2 the size I would expect it to be, but it does the job well enough.</li>
    <li> I found these clippers to be terrible: Dull and clumsy. Perhaps my experience is partly different from the other reviewers because I am female and so I prefer a 1/4 jaw nipper, but even compared to other 1/2 jaw,  the size of this one), these are awful. They have completely mangled my cuticles - to the point of bleeding - even more than the broken pair I was using. I wish I had just bought a $20 pair because that&#x27;s what I&#x27;m going to do now. If you are female and like to give yourself a real manicure, not just trim hangnails, do NOT waste your money. Buy a name brand like Tweezerman.</li>
    <li> This nipper is not new a not working it&#x27;s the worst nipper ever.</li>
    <li> plenty sturdy and worth the price. nice weight- not too thin or light, and the blade was plenty sharp enough for cuticle nipping.</li>
    <li> Came faster than expected ... They are no cheaply made , good product for the price</li>
    <li> accidentally bought two, costumer service wouldn&#x27;t respond, and to top it off, IT DOSEN&#x27;T WORK!!!!!!</li>
    <li> Much smaller than expected. Ok product but would be easier to handle if larger</li>
    <li> This is small, but definitely big enough to cut hangnails. I can see how it could be tiresome for some people to use, but I only use it for a couple seconds at a time (to cut hangnails) so the small size doesn&#x27;t bother me at all.</li>
    <li> The middle part gets worn and breaks easily...</li>
    <li> i use this all the time!</li>
    <li> The product works fine and was an added asset to my basket of nail  paraphernalia. I would suggest adding it to your basket as well.</li>
    <li> Ok, but took forever to get here!</li>
    <li> Product sent was not as pictured. This is what was sent: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B006WHOAHO/ref&#x3D;cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_8&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only one of the two had the edges properly aligned and both were poorly finished only where the edges were ground.</li>
    <li> Came looking banged up...not sure since it traveled a long way. Nipper casing was easy to open (not a good thing) and put back together as if never opened. But for the price, i will sanitize and disinfect and it shall serve, hopefully. Doesn&#x27;t appear dull or used by a person tho.</li>
    <li> Cheap quality and the middle part of it snaps off the first time you use it. Try soaking your cuticles in water for at least 3 minutes before clippiong them.</li>
    <li> Not flexible . Very stiff or tight</li>
    <li> For the cost if these in the stores..&lt;br /&gt;This works great for  me.</li>
    <li> They are really cheap... price matches quality.  I threw these away and got Revlon instead.  Would recommend trying something else.</li>
    <li> They were smaller than what picture shows.</li>
    <li> The nippers received have to prongs on the inside, not one like in the picture.  They&#x27;re a little uncomfortable to use, and after a few weeks of using them, a couple have had the hooking mechanism break making them unusable.</li>
    <li> This nipper was not sharp and it actually is not smooth in the cutting action. Might be better after oiled</li>
    <li> Too flimsy, but at the price, it&#x27;s not to be expected.</li>
    <li> They&#x27;re definitely stainless steel.  They&#x27;re coming from China, but the product I received was German.  Anyway, they work perfectly!</li>
    <li> just as described in the pic</li>
    <li> These are junk.  I bought a couple of these in 2011 when they were 9.79 each.  They are not precise enough to cleanly trim anything.  Now that the price is this low, I&#x27;d expect the quality to be even lower than the units I received.</li>
    <li> Disappointingly poor quality.  It should work ok for a short period of time.  It did take forever to ship and arrive.  I would suggest checking out slightly higher quality product with the ability to ship and arrive faster.  It took weeks.</li>
    <li> Good for ingrown nails.</li>
    <li> High quality, great service!</li>
    <li> sharp and easy to handle</li>
    <li> easy to use.  work great</li>
    <li> Too small for me.pLanning to exchange if I can</li>
    <li> good product  and good price..</li>
    <li> This is great. Very sharp and clean. Waited 3 weeks for it but totally worth it.</li>
    <li> Will not cut as I hoped it would, not very strong and bends when I try to use it. Not worth what I paid for.&lt;br /&gt;....:(</li>
    <li> Great nipper, stainless steel, made in Germany. Great Deal.</li>
    <li> I am a nail tech and can tell you these were the worst nippers ever</li>
    <li> I have been using this &#x27;nipper&#x27; for about a month and it is working great, I have bought similar products in the stores for years at 5x this price that have been terrible compared to this. May not be durable enough for a business or heavy use but otherwise is a great buy.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t beat it for a buck!  Amazing they can make it and ship it for $1.00</li>
    <li> great product, great seller</li>
    <li> clippers were not sharp and pulled the skin.  I would not recommend. I guess its true what they say you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> These are decent for household use, no complaints here! They are sturdy, effective, and easy to clean. I would buy them again if needed.</li>
    <li> Cuticles are nature&#x27;s way of protecting your nail bed and nails, but there are times when they&#x27;ve got to be trimmed.  Maybe they&#x27;re dry, cracked, peeling, whatever.  These clippers are so easy to use.  Just be careful not to overuse!!</li>
    <li> These clippers are made of German steel and are very sharp.  What more could you ask for in a set of clippers?</li>
    <li> Low quality - the blades are dull and the tension brace in the center is off so it keeps coming apart.</li>
    <li> It arrived to my home without manufacturer packaging, so the only packaging it had was the shipping envelope. This made me worry about how sanitary it was. It smelt badly, and the blades were dull causing snagging to my cuticles. You definitely get what you pay for here. It&#x27;s a waste of money.</li>
    <li> Excellent cuticle nippers and can&#x27;t believe the price.  These are much better than some I&#x27;ve paid  $20 for.  I just ordered two more pair. They are worth the wait which was shorter than expected.</li>
    <li> Recognizing that this item was extremely cheap, I thought, how bad can a simple cuticle cutter be? Well, it&#x27;s awful. The cutting edges are so dull they don&#x27;t cut anything. They pull my cuticles and hangnails rather than cut which makes everything worse. They also took a very long time to arrive. Not worth even the little bit I paid for them.</li>
    <li> broke after 3 uses, cheaply made</li>
    <li> The screw holding the spring popped out on my second manicure. If the screw hadn&#x27;t shot across the room and been lost I would have used some glue when I screwed them back together. This was a faulty design, the screw should have been thread locked into place at manufacturing.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t use to trim cuticles</li>
    <li> Great price. Perfect finish because it&#x27;s made in Germany but sold from China</li>
    <li> It really cuts the cuticles. It cuts small cuticles.&lt;br /&gt;It is cheap and do the work very good.&lt;br /&gt;Very good purchase.</li>
    <li> This is a great tool that I use when I can&#x27;t make it to get a manicure. The only bad point is that the little piece of metal that helps move the clipper open and shut broke. I can still use it, just not very easy at times. I only had it for a few weeks before it broke. I&#x27;d still buy it again. Just hope for a more stronger tool.</li>
    <li> When was the last time you bought something of substance for a buck and a half including tax and shipping?  This little snipper is adequately sharp and precise, and also fairly nicely finished.  The packaging says it is made in Germany.</li>
    <li> Skip these. Buy something else. Learn from my mistake. Oops - I bought 4!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The blades are not aligned so half of whatever you&#x27;re clipping isn&#x27;t clipped all the way through.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lower part of the blade works fine, but the tips don&#x27;t meet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t found a way to use this effectively.</li>
    <li> This helps me to keep my toe nails trimmed.</li>
    <li> Very nice to help  trim your cuticle</li>
    <li> Great product for manicures!</li>
    <li> Great deal on the price. Item was shipped from Hong Kong, but pleasantly surprised to see it was made in Germany. Very well made at a fantastic price. I cannot say that if repurchased, that same events would occur.</li>
    <li> Terrible. Dull and the part that cuts doesn&#x27;t actually touch all the way.</li>
    <li> works great for what I wanted</li>
    <li> Was excellent until my wife used it to cut her nails, now it doesn&#x27;t seem to be as sharp as when I first got it.&lt;br /&gt;If you have big hands like me you will probably find its tricky to manipulate.</li>
