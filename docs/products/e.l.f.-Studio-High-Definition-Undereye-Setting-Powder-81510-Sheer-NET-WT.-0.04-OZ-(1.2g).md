### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Perfect.</li>
      <li>And looks great!!</li>
      <li>But the best part of this for me is that it keeps my mascara and eyeliner from ending up under my eyes.</li>
      <li>The product itself is AWESOME!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m seriously impressed with almost every e.l.f.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s like they got together &amp; decided my best look was raccoon.  </li>
      <li>LOVE THIS!!!</li>
      <li>Good Product!</li>
      <li>Good stuff here!</li>
      <li>This is beautiful under the eyes to set concealer for no-crease all-day wear.</li>
      <li>Feels great.</li>

      <li>love it, love it, love it!</li>
      <li>I did give it 2 stars because I DO like the color, very light</li>
      <li>It is very light.  </li>
      <li>But there&#x27;s a huge difference between shimmer and glitter!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second!</li>
      <li>but it also says without concealer for a light concealing!</li>
      <li>but now I top it with this powder</li>
      <li>:) the price for this product is $3.</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>I like ELF products, for the most part</li>
      <li>I would also be impressed to see them release a yellow color.</li>
      <li>But I will not be buying more.</li>
      <li>this would be ok</li>
      <li>But, once applied LIGHTLY on top of concealer</li>
      <li>LOVE this.</li>
      <li>The only reason I gave this two stars was because of the shipping and seller, both of which were excellent.  </li>
      <li>Save the $6 you&#x27;d be spending on this for a better setting powder.</li>
      <li>It makes you look fresh and awake and bright.</li>
      <li>I also have Ben Nye and like the sheerness of this E.L.F. much better.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s an ok brush</li>
      <li>and this is the best product I&#x27;ve found to cover up my dark circles.</li>
      <li>this finely milled powder keeps my concealer from settling into fine lines.  </li>
      <li>LIGHT</li>
      <li>and it is such a great price.</li>
      <li>Just use a light dusting of it.</li>
      <li>LIGHT concealing may work for some, but def not for everyone.</li>
      <li>This powder blends in nicely and really does brighten.  </li>
      <li>Blends great instantly under eyes.</li>
      <li>I have right here on my hand!</li>
      <li>I wasn&#x27;t expecting the micro glitter flecks, and honestly they made this completely unwearable for me.</li>
      <li>This stuff is so cool</li>
      <li>and this is not a bad setting powder for the price.</li>
      <li>This product really helps to highlight your eyes while camouflaging flaws!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s light weight, easy to apply and stays on all day.</li>
      <li>I am pretty excited about using this product.</li>
      <li>It says right there</li>
      <li>Got my order very fast</li>
      <li>Being in my early 40&#x27;s, I am always looking for powder that sets my concealer, won&#x27;t cake or settle in my fine lines.  </li>
      <li>...for a higher end product.  </li>
      <li>The brush not so much!</li>
      <li>Soft n soothing, lightly shimmered powder.</li>
      <li>The price definitely makes it all the more tempting to buy, but don&#x27;t.  </li>
      <li>The only thing I don&#x27;t like are the glitter particles in it.. not terribly noticeable. ..</li>
      <li>Genetically, I have very dark circles and am very satisfied.</li>
      <li>Tap into the eye area, let it set a minute, then brush off excess with a large powder brush.</li>
      <li>I started using this powder since it is micro fine and sheer, it has been a real blessing.</li>
      <li>I have REALLY tested it too...</li>
      <li>I really don&#x27;t like this product.</li>
      <li>Really sets concealer and &#x27;pops&#x27; the eyes.</li>
      <li>Most ELF products are 3 bucks so be careful to not over pay!</li>
      <li>but the little brush that came with it is good for applying regular concealer.</li>
      <li>On a whim I picked up this super inexpensive powder for under eye use only.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s really great stuff for such a small price!</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t really sit in the creases under or near the eye.  </li>
      <li>It would settle into the fine lines (I&#x27;m 30 years old, so the lines are there but minimal).</li>
      <li>give a soft look.</li>
      <li>I thought it might not work as well with mature eyes, but y&#x27;know</li>
      <li>As far as just keeping the concealer in place, when I put it over my concealer all it does is make my undereye area look cakey.  </li>
      <li>Just use any old eyeshadow</li>
      <li>But the price is so good that basically it doesn&#x27;t matter they are giving you the wrong brush with it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Usually they crease because of the amount applied but this fixed that easily.</li>
      <li>All the fine lines disappear and ever high-resolution professional photography cannot detect any ugly fine lines in there with this product.</li>
      <li>I have normal to dry skin, but for some reason my eyelids are greaseballs.</li>
      <li>I have normal to dry skin .</li>
      <li>It has a VERY subtle shimmer to it (still 100% work appropriate, you never notice the shimmer) that hides any undereye circles.</li>
      <li>Works very well, especially given the price, but I really wish this didn&#x27;t have sparkles in it - they&#x27;re little and limited, but they&#x27;re there, and I don&#x27;t generally want to draw attention to my setting powder.</li>
      <li>Other powders are too heavy and settle in fine lines and this virtuallt eliminates that.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Works well, but it would be great if they got rid of the glitter flakes.  I would also be impressed to see them release a yellow color.</li>
    <li> Soft n soothing, lightly shimmered powder. Blends great instantly under eyes. AND YES it does make a difference in pictures. U will never think u need this till tried !!</li>
    <li> Love it! Got my order very fast</li>
    <li> Works great right under bottom lashes after you have applied mascara. Good Product!</li>
    <li> Being in my early 40&#x27;s, I am always looking for powder that sets my concealer, won&#x27;t cake or settle in my fine lines.  This is not that product.  It cakes really bad and will crease every soon after applying it.  Not to mention, the brush is terrible!  I had to use a fluffy eye make up brush to get the powder on.  What a pain.  In the description, it says you can use it with or without make up.  Not really.  Without concealer/foundation, it provided no coverage for dark circles.  I did give it 2 stars because I DO like the color, very light and it&#x27;s silky texture.  But I will not be buying more.</li>
    <li> very easy to use and looks nice</li>
    <li> Tap into the eye area, let it set a minute, then brush off excess with a large powder brush. Really sets concealer and &#x27;pops&#x27; the eyes. It makes you look fresh and awake and bright. Genetically, I have very dark circles and am very satisfied. I also have Ben Nye and like the sheerness of this E.L.F. much better. It doesn&#x27;t &#x27;settle&#x27; in my eye crease.</li>
    <li> I put it on last and don&#x27;t have issues with eye liner making it&#x27;s way under my eye. I have REALLY tested it too... during all types of partying and physical activity, works like a charm.</li>
    <li> I am pretty excited about using this product. I just purchased some additional make up that should work well with this.</li>
    <li> I like this.  It is very light.  Doesn&#x27;t really sit in the creases under or near the eye.  Great price.  I like ELF products, for the most part and this is not a bad setting powder for the price.</li>
    <li> This is beautiful under the eyes to set concealer for no-crease all-day wear. I also use it to set spot concealer on other areas of my face in a pinch... It&#x27;s really great stuff for such a small price!</li>
    <li> This stuff rocks.  Sets my concealer but doesn&#x27;t settle into lines. It also illuminates your eye area. Who doesn&#x27;t want that!  Love it!</li>
    <li> Not much difference in circles</li>
    <li> I think this definitely does brighten up my eye area and decrease creasing ( I use it with my Mac pro l ongwear concealer). The only thing I don&#x27;t like are the glitter particles in it.. not terribly noticeable. .. but they are there.</li>
    <li> This product really helps to highlight your eyes while camouflaging flaws!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s light weight, easy to apply and stays on all day.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been having issues with my sunblock &amp; concealer conspiring to remove my waterproof mascara.  It&#x27;s like they got together &amp; decided my best look was raccoon.  On a whim I picked up this super inexpensive powder for under eye use only.  Whoa!  This powder put my concealer in its place!  Now my mascara stays put &amp; this finely milled powder keeps my concealer from settling into fine lines.  Very pleased &amp; will purchase again.</li>
    <li> LOVE this. Before, I used a regular pressed face powder over my under eye concealer. It would settle into the fine lines (I&#x27;m 30 years old, so the lines are there but minimal). The e.l.f. setting powder doesn&#x27;t enhance my creases. Also, I haven&#x27;t noticed a excessive amount of shimmer/glitter as in other reviews.</li>
    <li> I started using this powder since it is micro fine and sheer, it has been a real blessing. Other powders are too heavy and settle in fine lines and this virtuallt eliminates that.</li>
    <li> I saw a youtuber review this and I just had to have it!  After my very first use, I was highly impressed.  I usually use my setting face powder and it always seemed to make my under eyes look darker.  This powder blends in nicely and really does brighten.  It didn&#x27;t crease and you didn&#x27;t notice the &amp;#34;glitter&amp;#34; after it had time to settle.  A little bit goes a long way so that little container will last forever.  I&#x27;m not a big fan of the applicator that comes with it, but it does work if you don&#x27;t have another brush to apply it with.  I&#x27;m seriously impressed with almost every e.l.f. product I&#x27;ve every bought!</li>
    <li> Have Tested for last two months with the little baby brush and sponge , brush  . Did clog inner eye pores and little zit from these.I have normal to dry skin . Bought target for $6 . i am instead using other eyeprimer.</li>
    <li> I should have listened to the woman who complained of the sparkles in it. It definitely has sparkles and they didn&#x27;t disappear as some people have said. Maybe if you&#x27;re in your 20&#x27;s this would be ok but it&#x27;s not good for my 50+ face.  I wanted something to set concealer and it didn&#x27;t do that for me. Would have rated it a 1 but the little brush that came with it is good for applying regular concealer.</li>
    <li> Good stuff here! Works well. I thought it might not work as well with mature eyes, but y&#x27;know what? It works great for setting concealer under the eyes. Just use a light dusting of it. Perfect. I don&#x27;t use the brush that came with it, however. I use a fluffier one. The color is perfect (I am fair) and the consistency is just right. Not cakey or thick.</li>
    <li> I am a huge fan of e.l.f.&#x27;s face powder, so I wanted to try this undereye powder, but was skeptical that I would just be paying for a smaller container of the same powder that they sell as all-over face powder. I am so glad I took the chance! I love this product! It has a VERY subtle shimmer to it (still 100% work appropriate, you never notice the shimmer) that hides any undereye circles. But the best part of this for me is that it keeps my mascara and eyeliner from ending up under my eyes. I have normal to dry skin, but for some reason my eyelids are greaseballs. I use waterproof mascara every day of the year and always use a primer both on my lids and under my eyes, but I was still experiencing some run by the end of the day. I still use a primer under my eyes but now I top it with this powder and I get zero makeup smudges under my eyes. The brush that comes with it really sucks, but what do you expect? Does anyone ever use included makeup applicators? Just use any old eyeshadow brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This also works well on blemishes. I put concealer on the blemish, then use this powder to set it. If it&#x27;s not covered I do another layer of concealer and then another layer of the powder. The teeny tiny bit of shimmer in this powder keeps it from looking cakey, even with a few layers.</li>
    <li> Works very well, especially given the price, but I really wish this didn&#x27;t have sparkles in it - they&#x27;re little and limited, but they&#x27;re there, and I don&#x27;t generally want to draw attention to my setting powder.</li>
    <li> This setting powder did a wonder to the creases, knock them down and scared them away. No longer are there creases.</li>
    <li> This stuff is so cool and it is such a great price. I love it. Feels great. And looks great!!</li>
    <li> GLITTER.  GLITTER EVERYWHERE.  If you dislike glitter, than run from this stuff.  I wasn&#x27;t expecting the micro glitter flecks, and honestly they made this completely unwearable for me.</li>
    <li> LOVE THIS!!! I&#x27;m 43 and this is the best product I&#x27;ve found to cover up my dark circles. The price is amazing and proof that you don&#x27;t need to spend a lot of money to look fab! Buy it. Try it! I always keep two on hand bc if I ran out I would cry. :0)</li>
    <li> bottle very small, the size of a sample size</li>
    <li> ...for a higher end product.  The price definitely makes it all the more tempting to buy, but don&#x27;t.  It was supposed to sort of brighten the undereye area, and set your concealer so it doesn&#x27;t crease.  I wanted to buy Laura Mercier&#x27;s Secret Brightening Powder, but after seeing this product that supposedly did the same job for a cheaper price I went ahead and got this one instead.  Now I wish I had just gone with its more expensive counterpart.  Not only does this NOT brighten the undereye area, it has glitter in it.  Why would you want glitter under your eyes for everyday wear?  As far as just keeping the concealer in place, when I put it over my concealer all it does is make my undereye area look cakey.  It&#x27;s also messy, but what can you expect from a loose powder?  The only reason I gave this two stars was because of the shipping and seller, both of which were excellent.  The package arrived earlier than it was supposed to.  The other reason I gave this two stars was because of the brush it comes with.  It&#x27;s not a very good brush, at least not with the powder.  But if you use it as an eye brush or a concealer brush, it works wonders because of its small size.  This brush also works well for applying concealer under the eyes.  Overall, I will not be buying this product again.  Save the $6 you&#x27;d be spending on this for a better setting powder.</li>
    <li> The product itself is AWESOME! The brush not so much! It&#x27;s an ok brush but it&#x27;s def not for this! You need a fluffy brush to apply it! But the price is so good that basically it doesn&#x27;t matter they are giving you the wrong brush with it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2 little things other reviewers wrote that I disagree!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First! There&#x27;s no glitter in this product. I have right here on my hand! THERES NO GLITTLER! There&#x27;s a shimmer to it! But there&#x27;s a huge difference between shimmer and glitter!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second! Another reviewer said that the instructions say to apply with or without  concealer. Yes! It does say that but it also says without concealer for a light concealing! LIGHT concealing may work for some, but def not for everyone. If you have darker circles... It won&#x27;t work for you. But that doesn&#x27;t mean the product is not good. It says right there LIGHT CONCEALING!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One final advice! Do not buy from this seller! :) the price for this product is $3. That&#x27;s what I paid at target! Most ELF products are 3 bucks so be careful to not over pay!</li>
    <li> I really don&#x27;t like this product. It could work well with others but with me no.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! I will keep ordering it again and again</li>
    <li> After seeing that this is slightly pink and having shimmer I became very skeptical about it. But, once applied LIGHTLY on top of concealer it somehow works wonders. All the fine lines disappear and ever high-resolution professional photography cannot detect any ugly fine lines in there with this product. It will also last a long time, since I only use a tiny amount each time. A must have in my opinion if you&#x27;re over 25.</li>
    <li> I have genetic dark circles and mix concealers to rid myself of them. Usually they crease because of the amount applied but this fixed that easily. I even apply less concealer now because this also brightens. You can get it for $3 at target so I suggest that, can&#x27;t beat it!</li>
    <li> love it, love it, love it! no caking effect. no build up. doesn&#x27;t make the lines stand out even more; which is great for me being in my 40&#x27;s. give a soft look.</li>
</ol>
