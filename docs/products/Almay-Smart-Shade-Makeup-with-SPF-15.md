      <li>I was very pleased with the foundation.</li>
      <li>there is one plus which is that the foundation makes your face feel nice, but it gives no coverage.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a good product but has some notable flaws.</li>
      <li>Additionally, it is very light coverage, so I get splotchy orange streaks on my face.</li>
      <li>I love this product.</li>
      <li>I ordered this makeup for my wife based on the price which she tells me is good for one 1-ounce tube, but it was the (pack of 2) that makes it worth the cost of shipping rather than just going to the store.</li>
      <li>ya&#x27;ll should try the almay tlc i love it</li>
      <li>It is an outstanding product.  </li>
      <li>Guess that is the \\&quot;magical</li>
      <li>It is magic.  </li>
      <li>Ok here&#x27;s the deal.</li>
      <li>I wanted to try this because it&#x27;s like magic.</li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s simply magic.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s more of a tinted moisturizer and sunscreen than foundation.</li>
      <li>it is magic.</li>
      <li>This is exactly what Almay smart shade liquid foundation does; it matches my skin tone perfectly.  </li>
      <li>Lucky to have located it here, so of course I purchased 10!</li>
      <li>It is important to shake the tube before each application; and I have not had any orange or streaking problem.  </li>
      <li>Goes on smooth and is lightweight.</li>
      <li>As described, smooth, non shine finish, doesn&#x27;t make you feel as if you are wearing make up.</li>
      <li>Love this my new favorite thing,blends well and looks great,I will always use this brand from now on.  </li>
      <li>The only upside was my 6 year old daughter thought I was hilarious-looking and laughed and laughed.</li>
      <li>This is the only one that does not make my fine lines more prominent, there is none of that caked on covering, and it washes off easily.  </li>
      <li>When I first saw it in my hand, I thought \\&quot;oh dear\\&quot; as it was a rather gray mess, but once on my face the shade matched wonderfully.</li>
      <li>I love that this foundation has a light and sheer coverage, and it  works better than my mineral make-up because it does NOT show.  </li>
      <li>I have used Estee Lauder for many years and was very reluctant to change.  </li>
      <li>The liquid foundation right from the tube is a light greyish white, it glides on similar to a moisturizer, and as blends onto my skin, the foundation transforms to a perfect match of my skin tone.  </li>
      <li>This is gentle enough for my skin, does what it promises (changes color) and looks good.</li>
      <li>Almay Smart Shade makeup is my favorite liquid foundation, and it is ironic because I love it for the same reason that some reviewers do not.  </li>
      <li>I read some reviews that this turns very orange, and that is completely true.</li>
      <li>this was my first time trying almay products</li>
      <li>I thought I would try a different product which has a more reasonable price.  </li>
      <li>No one is aware that I use any foundation at all, because  Almay Smart Shade foundation gives me a light and sheer coverage, that matches my skin tone to perfection.</li>
      <li>this stuff is really blah</li>
      <li>i really dont like this product.</li>
      <li>i&#x27;m very unimpressed.</li>
      <li>After washing the makeup off, the redness remained and my skin felt very sensitive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This is a light coverage foundation and should be expected to show freckles and/or blemishes.     </li>
      <li>i bought this at walmart because my normal makeup</li>
      <li>so i thought I&#x27;d try something new</li>
      <li>The first time I received it there was only 1</li>
      <li>I ordered this product because in the description it clearly states \\&quot;pack of 2\\&quot;.  </li>
      <li>The item clearly says, \\&quot;Pact of 2\\&quot;</li>
      <li>I have rosacea, so I have sensitive skin</li>
      <li>As another reviewer noted, this is not heavy coverage.</li>
      <li>I was under the impression that Almay was a makeup that is recommended for people with sensitive skin, another reason I choose this.</li>
      <li>It covers nicely, and stays with its color while I&#x27;m wearing it, but I still want to know its color-change secret.  </li>
      <li>I originally tried this foundation because I have trouble selecting the correct shade, and I was hoping that if I applied something close to my coloring, the foundation would be ‘smart enough’ to match my skin color.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m in the military and it lasted through a day outside in the hot sun!</li>
      <li>Due to my aging skin, every other foundation accentuates the fine lines that I have acquired with age.  </li>
      <li>I like this make-up, better than any other I have tried, but It is hard to get anymore, so not sure how much longer I can order it.</li>

<li> I like this make-up, better than any other I have tried, but It is hard to get anymore, so not sure how much longer I can order it.</li>
<li> and finding the right shade makeup is so hard.</li>
<li> I picked this up while browsing at the local drugstore to give it a try since it was much cheaper than my usual foundations.</li>
<li> I usually use Estee Lauder makeup which is very pricey.  </li>
<li> Far too dark.</li>
<li> I highly recommend this product, but I would purchase it your local store where it is at least 1 to 2 dollars cheaper than you can find it here.</li>
<li> Very strange.  </li>
<li> I finally gave up and received one less item that I ordered and paid for.</li>
<li> Getting it corrected is impossible, as they will ask you to return the \\&quot;one\\&quot; (for full credit) and they will re-ship the proper 2 pack.</li>
<li> This foundation is definitly not worth the 13-14 dollars.</li>
<li> Also, if the tube sits for awhile the product separates and at the end of the tube you may get all gray cream than does not turn to your skin color as you apply it, or you may get all dark brown that goes onto your face looking like mud.  </li>
<li> and so i got this when i used it the color went to, too dark for my skin</li>
<li> I mean, it&#x27;s effing cool -</li>
<li> I was having trouble finding a foundation to match my skin tone since the two shades I&#x27;ve used by other companies are no longer made.</li>
<li> not cute.</li>
<li> It also doesnt turn me orange which is a usual problem for my skin tone.</li>
<li> I use a little with other lotions as a base for my makeup, but only because I already have it.</li>
<li> right it feels terrible on your skin</li>
<li> Didn&#x27;t believe it would work as advertised - almay proved me wrong.</li>
<li> and i dont think ill be trying them again.</li>
<li> Not a good deal...DON&#x27;T ORDER!!!!</li>
<li> and i got the lightest almay has and second it blends terribly if you put some on and start to blend</li>
<li> and its so orange that it makes your eyes seem so dull!!!</li>
<li> I don&#x27;t how to read the expiration date, but I&#x27;m hoping it was a bad product pawned off on me.</li>
<li> I came to school and people had thought I got a terrible spray tan the day before.</li>
<li> Very disappointed!!</li>
<li> The shipping was terrible.  </li>
<li> and it feels terrible</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Far too dark. Not at all the same shade as what I bought in the store.</li>
    <li> I have rosacea, so I have sensitive skin and I need to cover some pinkish tones. This is gentle enough for my skin, does what it promises (changes color) and looks good.</li>
    <li> It is an outstanding product.  The shipping was terrible.  I finally gave up and received one less item that I ordered and paid for.</li>
    <li> Ok here&#x27;s the deal. This foundation is definitly not worth the 13-14 dollars. It turns your face ORANGE!!! I came to school and people had thought I got a terrible spray tan the day before. i&#x27;m very unimpressed. there is one plus which is that the foundation makes your face feel nice, but it gives no coverage. so basically its a mosturizer that turns your face orange!!! and its so orange that it makes your eyes seem so dull!!! i really dont like this product. this was my first time trying almay products and i dont think ill be trying them again.</li>
    <li> The item clearly says, \\&quot;Pact of 2\\&quot; but I only got 1. I ordered this makeup for my wife based on the price which she tells me is good for one 1-ounce tube, but it was the (pack of 2) that makes it worth the cost of shipping rather than just going to the store.</li>
    <li> I like this make-up, better than any other I have tried, but It is hard to get anymore, so not sure how much longer I can order it.</li>
    <li> Covers well. Doesnt break my skin out. It also doesnt turn me orange which is a usual problem for my skin tone.</li>
    <li> Goes on smooth and is lightweight. Color blends great with my shade of skin.</li>
    <li> I wanted to try this because it&#x27;s like magic. and finding the right shade makeup is so hard. I read some reviews that this turns very orange, and that is completely true. Additionally, it is very light coverage, so I get splotchy orange streaks on my face. not cute. It&#x27;s more of a tinted moisturizer and sunscreen than foundation. I use a little with other lotions as a base for my makeup, but only because I already have it. I would not buy it again. I mean, it&#x27;s effing cool - it is magic. But it&#x27;s impractical</li>
    <li> Review written by my wife, Carol.  I usually use Estee Lauder makeup which is very pricey.  I thought I would try a different product which has a more reasonable price.  I have used Estee Lauder for many years and was very reluctant to change.  I chose Almay based on price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Initially, the product is white and changes to a color to match an individual skin color.  I had to use quite a bit of this product for coverage.  This makeup caked on my face, and caused my skin to turn red. I felt like I was having an allergic reaction to this product.  After washing the makeup off, the redness remained and my skin felt very sensitive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After using this makup, I would not recommend this product.  I was under the impression that Almay was a makeup that is recommended for people with sensitive skin, another reason I choose this.</li>
    <li> The product is good. But do NOT order this 2-pack. Even though the packing list says \\&quot;2 pack\\&quot;, you will only receive ONE. Getting it corrected is impossible, as they will ask you to return the \\&quot;one\\&quot; (for full credit) and they will re-ship the proper 2 pack. But when the 2nd shipment comes, it again will only have ONE tube of makeup. The warehouse workers just don&#x27;t pay attention, it seems.</li>
    <li> I love this product. Perfect for light coverage that feels like you are wearing nothing at all. Yet, I can see that the product covers everything so well. It&#x27;s simply magic. I was so concerned when I recently ran out and could not locate it at either CVS or Walgreens. Lucky to have located it here, so of course I purchased 10!</li>
    <li> I have used this product for a couple of years but have always wondered what makes it change color as you apply it to your skin.  It covers nicely, and stays with its color while I&#x27;m wearing it, but I still want to know its color-change secret.  Also, if the tube sits for awhile the product separates and at the end of the tube you may get all gray cream than does not turn to your skin color as you apply it, or you may get all dark brown that goes onto your face looking like mud.  Very strange.  It&#x27;s a good product but has some notable flaws.</li>
    <li> This is a light coverage foundation and should be expected to show freckles and/or blemishes.     I used this product and the color that it transformed to was perfect for my skin tone. It also has sunscreen in the foundation which can&#x27;t be said for some pricier store brands. I had used clinique foundation before I switched to ALMAY and I will never go back! I highly recommend this product, but I would purchase it your local store where it is at least 1 to 2 dollars cheaper than you can find it here.</li>
    <li> Watch out...I ordered this product because in the description it clearly states \\&quot;pack of 2\\&quot;.  The first time I received it there was only 1 so I called Amazon and set up an exchange.  I received my 2nd order today and there is still only 1.  Not a good deal...DON&#x27;T ORDER!!!!</li>
    <li> Love this my new favorite thing,blends well and looks great,I will always use this brand from now on.  Love it.</li>
    <li> Was the problem the supplier or the Almay product??  I don&#x27;t how to read the expiration date, but I&#x27;m hoping it was a bad product pawned off on me. I&#x27;ve never had this problem with an Almay product before. It turned orange - Halloween orange in my hands, and of course, Halloween orange on my face.  The only upside was my 6 year old daughter thought I was hilarious-looking and laughed and laughed.</li>
    <li> I was having trouble finding a foundation to match my skin tone since the two shades I&#x27;ve used by other companies are no longer made. I picked this up while browsing at the local drugstore to give it a try since it was much cheaper than my usual foundations. I was very pleased with the foundation. When I first saw it in my hand, I thought \\&quot;oh dear\\&quot; as it was a rather gray mess, but once on my face the shade matched wonderfully. Guess that is the \\&quot;magical transformation\\&quot; stated on the front of the package. As another reviewer noted, this is not heavy coverage. You can still see some of the flaws your skin has underneath the foundation. To counteract this, I dabbed a bit of concealer on the spots I wanted to cover and then put the foundation on. Works well. For the price, this is excellent coverage.</li>
    <li> this stuff is really blah i bought this at walmart because my normal makeup almay tlc color was out so i thought I&#x27;d try something new and so i got this when i used it the color went to, too dark for my skin and i got the lightest almay has and second it blends terribly if you put some on and start to blend it will start to peel off if it drys before your done blending and if you get it blended right it feels terrible on your skin it also does not cover anything it just adds a orange tint to your face and it feels terrible ya&#x27;ll should try the almay tlc i love it</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t believe it would work as advertised - almay proved me wrong. I&#x27;m in the military and it lasted through a day outside in the hot sun!</li>
    <li> Does not work at all, all it did for me was turn orange. Very disappointed!!</li>
    <li> As described, smooth, non shine finish, doesn&#x27;t make you feel as if you are wearing make up. Non comedogenic and has spf. Products reached a bit earlier</li>
    <li> Almay Smart Shade makeup is my favorite liquid foundation, and it is ironic because I love it for the same reason that some reviewers do not.  I originally tried this foundation because I have trouble selecting the correct shade, and I was hoping that if I applied something close to my coloring, the foundation would be ‘smart enough’ to match my skin color.  This is exactly what Almay smart shade liquid foundation does; it matches my skin tone perfectly.  It is important to shake the tube before each application; and I have not had any orange or streaking problem.  The liquid foundation right from the tube is a light greyish white, it glides on similar to a moisturizer, and as blends onto my skin, the foundation transforms to a perfect match of my skin tone.  It is magic.  I love that this foundation has a light and sheer coverage, and it  works better than my mineral make-up because it does NOT show.  Due to my aging skin, every other foundation accentuates the fine lines that I have acquired with age.  This is the only one that does not make my fine lines more prominent, there is none of that caked on covering, and it washes off easily.  It looks perfect in daylight, and remains flawless in both candescent an incandescent light.  No one is aware that I use any foundation at all, because  Almay Smart Shade foundation gives me a light and sheer coverage, that matches my skin tone to perfection.</li>
