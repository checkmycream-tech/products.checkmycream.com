      <li>This was a great find!</li>
      <li>My dermatologist kept assuring me that washing my face with Cetaphil was the best thing for my skin, along with clindamycin and prescription antibiotics, but it never improved.&lt;br</li>

      <li>The skincare is very nice and has helped me to keep away my blemishes during pregnancy.  </li>
      <li>I have to say this stuff is amazing!</li>
      <li>, I use this face wash with coconut oil as a moisturizer and the results are amazing!</li>
      <li>And it has nice smell !</li>
      <li>It is so nice that I may continue to use it after I have the baby!  </li>
      <li>Safe and excellent product during my pregnancy</li>
      <li>I am still searching for a good moisturizer.</li>
      <li>The face wash doesn&#x27;t feel like it does a good job cleaning.</li>
      <li>I loved the fact that I could use it with no fear or doing harm to my baby.</li>
      <li>Good size for the price.</li>
      <li>My skin has never been clearer and I feel good about using it.</li>
      <li>For me it wasn&#x27;t as good as the Salicylic Acid based cleaners at preventing and treating acne.  </li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s good to go.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m very satisfied.</li>
      <li>Most face washes have that chemical smell, but not this one!</li>
      <li>Love this!</li>
      <li>and of course looked better!</li>
      <li>and I absolutely love it!</li>
      <li>Love this wash!</li>
      <li>Then I got Belli and within a week my skin was better than it had EVER been!</li>
      <li>This product made me break out more!</li>
      <li>I found this wash and my skin has never looked better!</li>
      <li>I have been using this cleanser fir 5 years and love it!</li>
      <li>The cleanser doesn&#x27;t foam much and though I&#x27;ve used non-foaming cleansers before (like DERMAdoctor&#x27;s Wrinkle Revenge cleanser which is great, but has glycolic which apparently isn&#x27;t great for preggos)</li>
      <li>while I love that it is good for helping with surface blemishes, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s cut out for helping with the sub-skin issues.</li>
      <li>Wish I could use something stronger on my oily skin, but this is good as it gets while pregnant.</li>
      <li>great product that keeps my skin clear through pregnancy and makes me feel safe to use it!</li>
      <li>I like that the ingredients are safe for pregnancy</li>
      <li>I tried this out with the thought that its safe for pregnancy</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t have it any more</li>
      <li>Love the smell and cleans my skin well</li>
      <li>I love this product.</li>
      <li>I read up about all the products and found it to be safe for baby</li>
      <li>/&gt;First, I LOVE the smell.</li>
      <li>and I still love it.</li>
      <li>I tried so many things, but wanted to stay with something safe.</li>
      <li>This has absolutely controlled my acne during pregnancy and leaves my skin feeling great.</li>
      <li>It works ok with my sonic brush too but just doesn&#x27;t foam.</li>
      <li>Love this product.</li>
      <li>I am so pleased with this product.</li>
      <li>I broke out even more.</li>
      <li>Love it</li>
      <li>It was a lot better than soap and water.  </li>
      <li>I couldn&#x27;t find anything that was safe to use during pregnancy to help</li>
      <li>love this product and it gives me peace of mind that it&#x27;s safe during pregnancy.</li>
      <li>so it might be ok on my skin.  </li>
      <li>Love, love, love it.</li>
      <li>This product would be great for pregnant women with mild acne.</li>
      <li>It smells good, produces a nice lather and washes my makeup off completely.</li>
      <li>I probably wouldn&#x27;t have ended up with as many marks and it would have been more comfortable pregnanacy.</li>
      <li>I like the refreshing light scent as well.</li>
      <li>The packaging for this used to be a pretty silver tube which I also liked, but I imagine it must have been more costly for them to produce</li>
      <li>Minimal breakouts and great complexion!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s also very mild and not overly drying.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t know if it is solely the result of the face wash or if getting farther away from the first trimester is helping, but I am loving this product</li>
      <li>It does not dry out my skin which is great.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s so natural, with a hint of citrus and tea leaves that is so pleasant.</li>
      <li>When I got pregnant my skin went nuts!</li>
      <li>I found it when I was pregnant, and I have continued using it since having my baby because my skin has never looked better.</li>
      <li>It has a great list of healthy ingredients, worked well with my dry skin, never caused breakouts!</li>
      <li>.. saw a huge difference in texture and smoothness..</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s hydrated and blemish free.</li>
      <li>My face outs smooth</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve read some great reviews of this stuff from multiple sources but after using this wash for a while... uh...</li>
      <li>It isn&#x27;t too harsh or anything, and used in conjunction with their spot treatment, it has worked great for me!</li>
      <li>Seemed to smooth out my skin some.</li>
      <li>I struggled with the resurgence of acne since becoming pregnant and it continued after having my child.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not just acne friendly...</li>
      <li>Definitely worth a try!</li>
      <li>Now that I have been using the product for over a month I have noticed a significant difference in my skin complexion.</li>
      <li>I feel like my face doesn&#x27;t get clean using this stuff.</li>
      <li>I have been using this cleanser for about 2 weeks, so far its working good on my skin, I feel fresh and hydrated.</li>
      <li>sorry)&lt;br /&gt;I think they should use pure plant products and list more specifically what the chemicals in the ingredients are.</li>
      <li>Cleared up pregnancy acne right away!</li>
      <li>I did get a full refund.</li>
      <li>Loved it and would definitely recommend!</li>
      <li>Natural and effective.  </li>
      <li>and it’s super gentle and refreshing</li>
      <li>(a little over a month) and have loved it!</li>
      <li>you&#x27;re in the market for a gentle, more natural face wash that smells nice, is gentle on your skin, and isn&#x27;t chalk full of chemicals (especially pregnant gals or anyone with major skin allergies!)</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Maybe I got a bad tube, but  this does not smell like lemongrass. It has a vague sulfur smell that clings to my nostrils and makes me nauseous after using it. I&#x27;m now in my 3rd trimester, and it hasn&#x27;t changed much. It&#x27;s controlling some of my acne, but for the price I can&#x27;t say I love it enough.</li>
    <li> At first I was skeptical bc I have to admit that I&#x27;m a sucker for the marketing ploy of foaming equals cleaning. This product doesn&#x27;t foam but it really does clean! I feel safer using this and it&#x27;s really kept my blemishes at bay. Ever since my first trimester I&#x27;ve been struggling with pimples and this stuff works without the potentially harmful ingredients for me and my baby</li>
    <li> I am so pleased with this product. It actually works and I&#x27;m grateful that I can be pregnant with clear skin and not have to use harsh chemicals to do so!</li>
    <li> Works like a charm! Very happy with this product.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work for me, the wash doesn&#x27;t lather at all but feels like it&#x27;s slipping thru my fingers and on my face. Broke out terribly while using this product- gave it a month to see if my skin would get used to it. Did not work. Would not recommend.</li>
    <li> I have PCOS &amp; was recommended to try this product, and from the other user reviews I was extremely hopeful it would help my skin, but it didn&#x27;t work at all for me. My acne situation hasn&#x27;t improved at all while using this. The product is also really thin and whether I use a lot of it of a little, it doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
    <li> This is the only face wash I use, pregnant or not! I started reading about how certain chemicals can be dangerous to your fetus when you are pregnant, even through your pores, so I researched this product. My skin has never been clearer and I feel good about using it. My baby is 9 months old now and I still continue to order it. I am breastfeeding and feel good that I&#x27;m not using anything harsh on my skin. I won&#x27;t use anything else!</li>
    <li> Love this wash! I have struggled with breakouts from the time I was 14 up until now (27) and pregnancy has just made my face worse. I found this wash and my skin has never looked better! Minimal breakouts and great complexion! I plan to use this even post-pregnancy. I ran out of this a couple of weeks ago and bought a cheaper product (Bella Bee)  to try to save money but my face just broke out again and then immediately cleared once I resumed using this product. Love it!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this a few times now, and I feel comfortable enough with it to leave a review.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, I LOVE the smell. Most face washes have that chemical smell, but not this one! It&#x27;s so natural, with a hint of citrus and tea leaves that is so pleasant. I have skin that isn&#x27;t particularly sensitive, but can dry out in areas other than my t-zone, and this hasn&#x27;t caused ANY drying, which is great! If I have to use any moisturizer, then I get way too oily, but this leaves my skin softer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for blemish control, I&#x27;m having adult acne issues the likes of which I didn&#x27;t even know were possible. I never had major acne issues as a teenager, so I had no clue what works for me and what doesn&#x27;t up until now. This hasn&#x27;t made everything go away (yet), but I&#x27;ve used it for about 2 weeks so I definitely intend to keep using it. I will say I&#x27;ve noticed that the angry red irritation has lessened, and that my acne tends to stay pink or flesh toned now, and more sub-dermis rather than white heads and black heads, which I can handle! It&#x27;s easier for me to hide them when they&#x27;re not red angry welts on my face. This stuff seems to calm my face down, and I love that! I&#x27;m happy with it thus far, and holding faith that it will continue progress in terms of beginning to help me clear up the acne too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will of course update this review in a few weeks on it&#x27;s success or not on that front!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re in the market for a gentle, more natural face wash that smells nice, is gentle on your skin, and isn&#x27;t chalk full of chemicals (especially pregnant gals or anyone with major skin allergies!), I would highly recommend this! It&#x27;s not just acne friendly... I wish I had known about this stuff long ago, it&#x27;s way better than aveeno and a few other &amp;#34;skin friendly natural&amp;#34; style brands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: (about 4 months later!)&lt;br /&gt;So I have been using this since January, and it&#x27;s now the beginning of May, and while I love that it is good for helping with surface blemishes, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s cut out for helping with the sub-skin issues. My angry welts persist, and I am having to alternate between this and one of the Cetaphil foaming washes. I feel like that one dries my skin out so much, which really sucks, but at the same time it helps with the welts, which is something this one lacks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I still really think this one is so gentle, and for someone like me who has to keep their face pretty clean, aka cleaning makeup off up to twice a day because it melts in Texas heat, and that&#x27;s when my pores are clogging... I really appreciate that this isn&#x27;t drying me out! Still loving the smell too!! Just wish it could handle the bigger acne issuesng with the sub-skin issues. My angry welts persist, and I am having to alternate between this and one of the Cetaphil foaming washes.

I really appreciate that this isn&#x27;t drying me out! Still loving the smell too!! Just wish it could handle the bigger acne issues</li>
    <li> upon finding out I was pregnant I developed quite a bit of acne. I chose this product as I wanted something as safe a possible for my skin and was happy with other reviews. I&#x27;ve been using this for about almost a month and am very satisfied! The acne has cleared up thankfully. It works ok with my sonic brush too but just doesn&#x27;t foam. I like the refreshing light scent as well.</li>
    <li> I wanted to love this product, but unfortunately it didn&#x27;t do anything for my skin. My skin continued to get worse during my use of this product - but because of pregnancy hormones, I won&#x27;t blame it on this product (although I will say that it didn&#x27;t help).</li>
    <li> I bought this during my first trimester of pregnancy when m face started to break out like crazy. It cleared up the majority of my breakouts and I only had a few pimples here and there, which was much more managable and of course looked better! Continued using it throughout my entire pregnancy and &amp;#34;4th trimester&amp;#34;. My face was extremely oily and always dry during winter months. This left my face smooth and soft. Loved it and would definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> Broke my face out more, likely due to over drying.</li>
    <li> Smells really good but has done nothing to help this horrid pregnancy acne :(</li>
    <li> Love, love, love it. I have crazy pregnancy skin right now so it&#x27;s hard to say what&#x27;s &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; (pre-pregnancy I was definitely on the oily side), however, it feels like it&#x27;s doing it&#x27;s acne control job and it&#x27;s not harsh. Skin feels a bit dry after washing but that&#x27;s pretty much every face wash I have ever used. I just apply day/night cream after and it&#x27;s good to go. I use it in conjunction with the spot treatment and my breakouts have definitely diminished. will buy again. B</li>
    <li> love this product and it gives me peace of mind that it&#x27;s safe during pregnancy. I&#x27;m going to order the body wash as well</li>
    <li> Awesome product still using after bsby born</li>
    <li> This product would be great for pregnant women with mild acne. I loved the fact that I could use it with no fear or doing harm to my baby. However, it did not help clear my acne. Since I have been pregnant, I have been struggling with severe, swollen, cystic acne, and this cleanser didn&#x27;t live up to my expectations. I am now trying an all natural tea tree oil regimen, which seems promising!</li>
    <li> I broke out even more. I was not even sure that was possible. What a dissapointment. Don&#x27;t waste your money, people.</li>
    <li> I have been using this cleanser fir 5 years and love it! I started when I was pregnant and just continued using. .it&#x27;s great for my acne prone skin.. saw a huge difference in texture and smoothness..I use it with moisturizer. Thumbs up!</li>
    <li> Used this product during my twin pregnancy and continue to use it while I am breastfeeding my boys. I have always had acne prone skin and this keeps it under control.</li>
    <li> It is alright, do not see much of the a difference.</li>
    <li> I have had trouble with acne since I was 15 years old. When I became pregnant it was way worse, I researched what products I could use and found Belli was approved by OB/GYN and Dermatologists. I started using it and it helped so much and I would recommend this product to anybody! I told my sister to get it to even though she isn&#x27;t pregnant. I am also no longer pregnant and continue to use this product. Thank you Belli!!!</li>
    <li> When I got pregnant my skin went nuts! I had terrible acne. I tried so many things, but wanted to stay with something safe. I tried Burts  Bees and other natural face mask home remedies, nothing worked! Then I got Belli and within a week my skin was better than it had EVER been! All I use is a tiny drop morning and night, the bottle is going to last me forever. I don&#x27;t think I will ever use another face wash, even after I give birth.</li>
    <li> Wish I could use something stronger on my oily skin, but this is good as it gets while pregnant.</li>
    <li> I really really like this stuff.  It has a great list of healthy ingredients, worked well with my dry skin, never caused breakouts!</li>
    <li> Started using this product hoping to help me combat some blemish issues I’ve been experiencing and it’s really done the trick.  I use it twice daily and it’s super gentle and refreshing and I can tell improvements have been made.  I would recommend this product to anyone needing a good face wash that will eliminate annoying blemishes.</li>
    <li> I bought this face wash in my second trimester, at a loss for what else to do for my skin. I&#x27;ve always had bad hormonal acne (I&#x27;ve been on Accutane in the past) and when I got pregnant, it went out of control. Coupled with the fact that I could no longer use any of my tried and true acne products and prescriptions, my acne really took a turn for the worse. I hated going out in public and I did not feel any of the pregnancy &amp;#34;glow&amp;#34; people were talking about. My acne hadn&#x27;t been so bad since I was a teenager and I had it bad: pustules, cystic acne as well as whiteheads that grew in clusters. My dermatologist kept assuring me that washing my face with Cetaphil was the best thing for my skin, along with clindamycin and prescription antibiotics, but it never improved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally after doing a ton of research online (my dermatologist and OB/GYN both were completely useless on this point) I decided to try this face wash. My skin has done a COMPLETE 180 since I started using this. I went from having a new blemish on my face every day to only getting one or two every other week, and when I do they are tiny whiteheads that can be easily taken care of. I don&#x27;t know if it is solely the result of the face wash or if getting farther away from the first trimester is helping, but I am loving this product and I hope it will continue working after baby is born.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wash my skin with this face wash twice daily with a Clarisonic Mia. I follow with Mario Badescu Glycolic Acid Toner (another lifesaver) as well as prescription clindamycin. I am still searching for a good moisturizer. I have also tried the spot treatment and it works very well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you were like me, at the end of your rope with your hormonal acne, give this a try!</li>
    <li> I bought this because I wanted something natural that wouldn&#x27;t harm baby...but when I read the ingredients I was disappointed. It contains some chemicals that I found to possibly be harmful to baby. I don&#x27;t have it any more or I would list them (sorry)&lt;br /&gt;I think they should use pure plant products and list more specifically what the chemicals in the ingredients are. For example other companies will have some long name chemical but put in parenthesis exactly what it is like (derived from beets, natural preservative) etc</li>
    <li> I have tried so many different face washes and because of my very sensitive skin, I&#x27;ve always had problems.  I tried this out with the thought that its safe for pregnancy so it might be ok on my skin.  It works great!  I use it once in the morning and once at night.  Every few days I add a little salt in my night time washing as a gentle scrub (just work it in for a few seconds until it starts to dissolve) and now I have no need to try to find a scrub to go with it.  Natural and effective.  You can also use a little table sugar if you don&#x27;t like the salt but the salt works best for me!</li>
    <li> I started using this at the beginning of my pregnancy in March of 2014. My son is now almost 7 months old and I still use this!  My skin has really never looked better using this. It&#x27;s hydrated and blemish free.</li>
    <li> Would give it 10 stars if possible. 19 weeks pregnant, didn&#x27;t want to use harmful chemicals, yet the hormonal  acne was getting out of control.this product was a godsend.</li>
    <li> This is the best face wash ever! I started using this with my second pregnancy and have not stopped! It has a pleasant smell and does not over dry. I use it with my Clarisonic and it cleans my face really well. Definitely recommend to those with bad pregnancy acne, looking for salicylic acid-free alternatives or those with adult acne that have tried everything else at the drug store. This was a great find!</li>
    <li> This did NOTHING for my skin during pregnancy.  In fact, it made breakouts worse and did nothing to clear them up.  I threw it in the trash before finishing the tube.</li>
    <li> I ordered this toward the end of my first trimester- after my skin had become a complete disaster.  This product definitely improved my skin- pretty much zit free again. Ill probably continue using it even when I&#x27;m not pregnant.</li>
    <li> I recieved this as a gift and I absolutely love it!</li>
    <li> It was difficult for me to give up my other facial cleaners when I got pregnant, but glad I found this! I have oily skin and moderate acne to start, so I was nervous to try something else. This has absolutely controlled my acne during pregnancy and leaves my skin feeling great. It doesn&#x27;t dry it out at all! Some products make my skin feel so dry and tight, but this is perfect. I would highly recommend using this facial wash while pregnant, and I plan to continue using it after I have my child.</li>
    <li> I ordered this as an acne wash during my pregnancy. It probably works for some, but didn&#x27;t work at all for me. The smell was nice but my acne didn&#x27;t go away, or even get smaller looking. I am sticking with my normal acne wash that I also used with my son.</li>
    <li> This product made me break out more!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using various acne products for fifteen years, and this is by far my favorite facewash. I found it when I was pregnant, and I have continued using it since having my baby because my skin has never looked better.</li>
    <li> I struggled with the resurgence of acne since becoming pregnant and it continued after having my child.  This product (in combination with the spot cream smoothed on my face 2x daily) helped clear the blackhead and red bumps that had covered my forehead and cheeks. I have a long history of using harsher and more toxic products, and this has controlled my acne just as well or better.  Prior to switching I was using a 2% benzoil peroxide cream 2x daily and that was not helping at all with bumps or red zits after a while.  This product cleared up the bumps completely and leaves only a few intermittent red zits here and there.</li>
    <li> does not exfoliate.  gave me little whiteheads</li>
    <li> SO disappointed. I wasted my money buying 2 bottles of this instead of trying one first. It made my acne so much worse! My whole face was a greasy mess.</li>
    <li> I have been using this cleanser for about 2 weeks, so far its working good on my skin, I feel fresh and hydrated. And it has nice smell ! Its gentle to my skin unlike salicylic acid . I would recommend it, however everyone&#x27;s skin is different!</li>
    <li> great product that keeps my skin clear through pregnancy and makes me feel safe to use it!</li>
    <li> I love this product. Especially because am pregnant, but I didn&#x27;t recieve the right product.  I did get a full refund. Still a little upset that I never got the facial wash :/  This facial wash is amazing to use when pregnant and even when your not pregnant!   I wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to buy it!</li>
    <li> Since getting pregnant I&#x27;ve been plagued by horrible acne and have been desperate to try anything that might give me a little edge on the havoc my hormones are wreaking on my face. I&#x27;ve read some great reviews of this stuff from multiple sources but after using this wash for a while... uh... I don&#x27;t get it. The cleanser doesn&#x27;t foam much and though I&#x27;ve used non-foaming cleansers before (like DERMAdoctor&#x27;s Wrinkle Revenge cleanser which is great, but has glycolic which apparently isn&#x27;t great for preggos) I feel like my face doesn&#x27;t get clean using this stuff. I have to use a LOT and then rub rub rub for quite a while. Even if this stuff worked well, I have a major issue with the smell. It has a citrus-y-chemical-y smell that smells a lot like dog flea shampoo.</li>
    <li> I have been using this throughout my entire pregnancy and am now on my third bottle. I like that the ingredients are safe for pregnancy and I&#x27;m not harming my baby at all. It does not dry out my skin which is great. I have had bad acne during this entire pregnancy. While using this as a daily face wash leaves my skin feeling clean and refreshed, I do not feel like it does much to rid my acne as a daily cleanser. However, I use this once a week or so as a mask and I have seen a noticeable difference in my skin from that. I will continue to purchase.</li>
    <li> I discovered this facewash when I was pregnant with my son but have continued to use it because it keeps my skin clearer than the harsher stuff.  I used to use a cleanser with salicylic acid but would still get marks here and there that I would treat with prescription strength acne cream.  Since I&#x27;ve been using this, I no longer use any acne cream.  The packaging for this used to be a pretty silver tube which I also liked, but I imagine it must have been more costly for them to produce so they stopped which is my only complaint.</li>
    <li> For me it wasn&#x27;t as good as the Salicylic Acid based cleaners at preventing and treating acne.  I still break out with this and the breakouts last longer.  It was a lot better than soap and water.  I like the peace of mind that it was safe for the little one.  After the baby was born I paired this with Earth mama C mama healing salve.  The combo works really well.</li>
    <li> This is my second pregnancy where I used this product! Love it</li>
    <li> This product worked great for me. I&#x27;ve always struggled with acne and I had a terrible flare up during my 2nd pregnancy (34 yrs old). I tried a few different products without success (including a prescription from the dermatologist).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a few weeks using Belli products, my skin is very clear. It&#x27;s also very mild and not overly drying. I&#x27;m very satisfied.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product since mid December 2014 (a little over a month) and have loved it! I noticed I was getting severe acne, like I used to have in high school, when I was about 10 weeks pregnant. I did not buy this product right away hoping my acne would go away once my hormones settled down after the first trimester. Unfortunately that just did not happen for me and I hit my breaking point with the way I looked when I was about 16 weeks pregnant. I read up about all the products and found it to be safe for baby so I went for it. I noticed a clearing up of my acne about 2 weeks into using the product. I use this product twice a day (morning and night). It was not a complete clear up right away and I still have scarring that will fade over time but overall my face has cleared up tremendously! I actually feel comfortable walking around without make up again! Now that I have been using the product for over a month I have noticed a significant difference in my skin complexion. I still get the occasional pimple from time to time but I will take that any day over the alternative. My face is so much clearer and I am so much happier because of it. I highly recommend this product for any mom to be who cant really take anything else without risk to the baby.</li>
    <li> I had a lot of problems with my face breaking out this pregnancy. Doctors don&#x27;t recommend other facial cleansers while pregnant because of the ingredients in them and some are hard on your more sensitive skin. This really helped keep my skin stay healthier. I still had break out, but not near like I had. definitely would recommend this!</li>
    <li> Seemed to smooth out my skin some. Will continue to use it throughout pregnancy.</li>
    <li> The skincare is very nice and has helped me to keep away my blemishes during pregnancy.  It is so nice that I may continue to use it after I have the baby!  To anyone that has mild-moderate acne and is thinking of trying this, I would say to definitely give it a shot.  It isn&#x27;t too harsh or anything, and used in conjunction with their spot treatment, it has worked great for me!</li>
    <li> So far it has helped me control the extra oil on my face in a gentle way and cleared up some of my acne breakouts during pregnancy. Needed to moisturize a little afterwards but not drastically like my face has reacted to harsh cleansers before.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t live with this product and the spot treatment. Saved me from hormonal breakouts throughout my entire pregnancy</li>
    <li> Ordered this wash in my 4-5th month of my pregnancy due to some skin issues that came up and it not only felt great on my skin but cleared up my issues. I am now 3 weeks away from delivery and it has kept my skin feeling refreshed, clear and didn&#x27;t dry it out like so many products can. You don&#x27;t need to use much so it lasts a long time too. I also used it like a mask a few times as suggested, I will be using this after pregnancy too! Definitely recommend it if you have any pregnancy related skin issues arise. :)</li>
    <li> This stuff saved my skin!! I&#x27;m on my 3rd pregnancy, but did NOT have pregnancy acne with my first two. I had tried everything natural and/or organic and nothing worked. It was acne worse than I ever had as a teenager. Within 3 washes, this stuff had my skin back to normal. Seriously, I could be a spokesperson for this stuff - it worked that well for me.</li>
    <li> I have to say this stuff is amazing! Wish I found it 14 years ago!  I had two prior full term pregnancys that resulted in a ton of stretch marks and loose skin, needless to say bikinis are out the window for me lol. But I&#x27;m pregnant now with twins (8months along now) I&#x27;ve only been using the cream once a day, it does say twice daily. Since using the Belli lotion my stretch marks arnt as painful, red or itchy as they were with my second pregnancy. My marks look great, they still look as faded as they did before my twin pregnanacy. Wish I knew about this stuff with my first kid I probably wouldn&#x27;t have ended up with as many marks and it would have been more comfortable pregnanacy. Definitely worth the money.</li>
    <li> This face wash saved my face during my first trimester, but I really wasn&#x27;t a fan of the smell (it&#x27;s a lemon scent with something else in the background).  However, I kept using it because my breakouts were horrible, and it really does work.  The entire bottle lasted about 4 months for me.  I don&#x27;t think I will be repurchasing another one, unless I absolutely need to.</li>
    <li> I started to use this face wash when I became pregnant and it helps my skin stay clear. It smells good, produces a nice lather and washes my makeup off completely. I will continue to use this product even post pregnancy. Update: I have now been using this produce for over 2 years and I still love it. I have always had acne prone skin and it continues to help keep my skin clear. I also have bought the Belli face scrub and I am really happy with that product too.</li>
    <li> Love this! Safe and excellent product during my pregnancy</li>
    <li> Bought this when I discovered that I was pregnant and could no longer use my regular face wash.  It works OK; however, it doesn&#x27;t control my acne nearly as well as my old face wash which had salicylic acid in it; however, it does a far better job then any of the other washes that I tried.</li>
    <li> I love this face wash for everyday use.  It smells fresh, is gentle on the skin, and keeps my face clear! Definitely worth a try!</li>
    <li> This face wash is great! Within a week it took my face from awful back to the pretty pregnant glow! I was even asked if I got a facial because of the difference!</li>
    <li> I had my baby almost a year ago and I still use this stuff.  I have breakout prone skin and this stuff works really well for me.</li>
    <li> I am 22 weeks pregnant now, I have been dealing with pregnancy acne pimples since a few weeks after I learned I was pregnant. I couldn&#x27;t find anything that was safe to use during pregnancy to help so I did some online research and learned of this brand and decided to purchase it. Best desission ever. My face outs smooth, doesn&#x27;t breakout anymore, I use this face wash with coconut oil as a moisturizer and the results are amazing! No more makeup for me!</li>
    <li> I wish I had heard of this sooner.  I normally use Neutrogena Acne Wash with so-so results, but needed something without salicylic acid to use while pregnant and found this. Either I&#x27;m just getting lucky with the hormones this time (#1 was a girl, now expecting a boy) or this is the best face wash I&#x27;ve ever used. It has kept my skin clear, and it&#x27;s been a while (Yay adult acne) since I&#x27;ve been able to say that. Good size for the price. I will continue to use this post pregnancy.</li>
    <li> Love this product. Used it during pregnancy and now after! So gentle</li>
    <li> For the price I didn&#x27;t notice much difference in my skin</li>
    <li> Overall, I&#x27;m not impressed. I appreciate that it&#x27;s supposed to be safe for pregnancy, but if that was not the reason I was using it, then I would definitely not buy it again. The face wash doesn&#x27;t feel like it does a good job cleaning. There is absolutely no exfoliation or sudsing, and I don&#x27;t feel super clean or refreshed after using it.</li>
    <li> I moved from Maryland to Texas a year ago and was pregnant shortly after the move.  Even before I was pregnant I was having trouble with oily skin that dried out easily during cleansing.  I&#x27;m not sure, but I think I may have hard water here.  I&#x27;ve had professionals flat out tell me it&#x27;s not possible to have both flakes &amp; oily skin, but that&#x27;s what I had going on.  The pregnancy started causing pimples.  I had tried at least seven different kinds of cleanser before trying this.  It&#x27;s the only thing that stopped me from breaking out on my face, and the flakes went away as well.  I&#x27;m getting ready to start using it on my shoulders and chest to see if it gets rid of those pimples too.  I should note that when I started using this I also started using a Clarisonic a few times a week, but I think it&#x27;s the cleanser that cleared everything up because I recently went a week without using the Clarisonic and my skin was still clear and flake free.  My first purchase of this lasted a 3-4 months and I just made my second one.</li>
    <li> Cleared up pregnancy acne right away!</li>
    <li> I ordered this face wash with the moisturizer by the same company during my 1st trimester when I was having terrible acne on my jaw line. I only used it for about two weeks because it made me break out even more and made my face feel very tight and dry after use. The one pro to this product was the smell, very nice. But I did not buy it for the smell!</li>
    <li> Love the smell and cleans my skin well</li>
</ol>
