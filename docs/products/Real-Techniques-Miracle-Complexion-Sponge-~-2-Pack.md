      <li>Great item &amp; superb price,</li>
      <li>Excellent product, love it!</li>
      <li>It is great for putting foundation and concealer on.  </li>
      <li>This is a nice inexpensive blending sponge for an awesome price!</li>
      <li>This blender is better than the beauty blender!</li>
      <li>Better get the two pack!</li>
      <li>Knew what I was getting because I have this product, and nowhere better to get it than AMAZON!</li>
      <li>The shape and texture of it is amazing</li>
      <li>If you want a nice even application, get this sponge.  </li>
      <li>I really love it</li>
      <li>I can tell that i would love it, because it does what it&#x27;s supposed to do.</li>
      <li>Love love</li>
      <li>I love the color too.</li>
      <li>This little blender is perfect for applying my makeup.</li>
      <li>u enjoy using it while puting ur foundation</li>
      <li>Many thanks...</li>
      <li>I wonder if  I just got a defective product and that this isnt the norm for this brand because i Love real techniques brushes a lot, and i dont see them creating a dupe sponge that falls apart with just water.</li>
      <li>While gently washing the makeup from the sponge using Oil of Olay gentle cleanser, the top of the sponge tore off.</li>
      <li>Better shape for fitting into tight corners, like around the nose.</li>
      <li>I would say it&#x27;s equally as good and half the price.</li>
      <li>when i added my philosophy soap (which is a very gentle brand)</li>
      <li>Works exactly like a beauty blender.</li>
      <li>I will say it doesn&#x27;t last as long however for $5 it is still by far and away a better deal!!</li>
      <li>fast shipping.</li>
      <li>This is so much easier than brushes any day, in my opinion.  </li>
      <li>Make-up goes on smoothly, they last forever!!!  </li>
      <li>It is nice and smoochy especially when its wet.  </li>
      <li>This the only &amp;#34;dupe&amp;#34; for the beauty blender that gets it right.</li>
      <li>and i find that the rubbery porous surface doesn&#x27;t soak up as much of my foundation as the traditional beauty blender!</li>
      <li>Save some money and go to Ulta if you have one near you.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not hard like the other beauty blender I owned.</li>

    <li> Knew what I was getting because I have this product, and nowhere better to get it than AMAZON! Best deal out there!</li>
    <li> I use this makeup sponge every day to apply my foundation.</li>
    <li> Excellent product, love it! fast shipping. The sponge is of very good quality.</li>
    <li> I just have to say this is the best makeup tool I have ever owned.  This is so much easier than brushes any day, in my opinion.  It is great for putting foundation and concealer on.  If you want a nice even application, get this sponge.  I&#x27;m still trying to figure out the best cleanser for it though.</li>
    <li> Saw this at walgreens only cost $2.99.&lt;br /&gt;Not recommended for this product.</li>
    <li> Just like the beauty blender save your money!! this is soft and doubles in size when wet. Works exactly like a beauty blender. I will say it doesn&#x27;t last as long however for $5 it is still by far and away a better deal!!</li>
    <li> BEST EVER!!!  Make-up goes on smoothly, they last forever!!!  Will only buy these from now on!!!</li>
    <li> I have bought these before and thought they worked well. This set does not appear to be the same quality. While gently washing the makeup from the sponge using Oil of Olay gentle cleanser, the top of the sponge tore off. What a waste for such an expensive product.</li>
    <li> Works wonderfully while blending out makeup.</li>
    <li> works as well as the beauty blender</li>
    <li> Its so filfy .. u enjoy using it while puting ur foundation</li>
    <li> Great item &amp; superb price, Many thanks...</li>
    <li> Greeeeeeeeeat sponge.  A total dupe for the beauty blender for half the price.  I have 8 and they last a long time and they don&#x27;t stain to much if you wash them at least after three days of using it.  Love love</li>
    <li> Um Ulta has this for $5.00 a sponge.  Save some money and go to Ulta if you have one near you.</li>
    <li> This blender is better than the beauty blender! Even if they were the same price i would still buy this one! The shape and texture of it is amazing and i find that the rubbery porous surface doesn&#x27;t soak up as much of my foundation as the traditional beauty blender! Game changer people!</li>
    <li> This is a nice inexpensive blending sponge for an awesome price!</li>
    <li> The product was torn a little  when i received it but i decided to use it anyway because it wasnt that bad and i had two of them. but once I used and washed it, it completely fell apart and now has little tears all over it after just one use, and i can tell that if i keep using and washing it the tears will get bigger and bigger. I wonder if  I just got a defective product and that this isnt the norm for this brand because i Love real techniques brushes a lot, and i dont see them creating a dupe sponge that falls apart with just water. and yes it started to tear while only using water to wash out my foundation. when i added my philosophy soap (which is a very gentle brand) it got worse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for the product it self I can tell that i would love it, because it does what it&#x27;s supposed to do. But If falling apart is the norm for this brand, that&#x27;s not something i&#x27;d keep buying or using. I&#x27;d rather spend the extra money on the brand that lasts the longest. So, I like it said I&#x27;m hoping that i just got a defective product. And I also dont want to use the second one and the same thing happens.</li>
    <li> I really love it but I would never in a million years pay this price for this sponge when it sells at Ulta and Kohl&#x27;s for about $6.50 or $7.00.</li>
    <li> It does the job, but a bit coarse compared to Beauty Blending Sponge. I&#x27;ll not buy it again.</li>
    <li> AAAAAmazing!! This little blender is perfect for applying my makeup. It&#x27;s not hard like the other beauty blender I owned. It is nice and smoochy especially when its wet.  No complaints!!!</li>
    <li> As soft as the expensive one. Better shape for fitting into tight corners, like around the nose. I love the color too. Not glaringly obvious I haven&#x27;t cleaned it within an inch of it&#x27;s life. I mean...it doesn&#x27;t show the stains that foundation can leave behind. Get the two pack. They do last a long time, but at this price? Better get the two pack!</li>
    <li> Perfect! This the only &amp;#34;dupe&amp;#34; for the beauty blender that gets it right. I would say it&#x27;s equally as good and half the price. I&#x27;ve repurchased several times over.</li>
