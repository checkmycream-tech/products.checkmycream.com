      <li>Great for travel, or stick a few in your wallet, purse, briefcase, office, or car.</li>
      <li>Economical</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m lazy and don&#x27;t like wrapping my fingers in the floss so these are great.</li>

      <li>Nice idea, but not sweet.</li>
      <li>Very convenient.</li>
      <li>Very minty and tingly on gums amd tongue.</li>
      <li>Ready to use anytime or place.</li>
      <li>After a dinner out I excuse myself to rest room and do a quick floss, then ready to head out for the night.</li>
      <li>Also the floss seems to not be quite as strong as normal floss or even the prior Glide product and occasionally breaks.</li>
      <li>So small and light</li>
      <li>but in private obviously), mainly because I have some gaps and a problem with a botched hemisection on my back two molars.  </li>
      <li>So thin and easy to slip into a wallet or pocket.  </li>
      <li>Feels cleaner than the little containers of floss and so much easier to have in your purse.  </li>

    <li> Great to have in my wallet for those moments when you need it but can&#x27;t find it. Good quality.</li>
    <li> Well, it&#x27;s dental floss..  I like to take it with me in my purse in case I need it.. Popcorn?? These are great, convenient and easy to use.</li>
    <li> My new favorite thing!</li>
    <li> I am using these for a humanitarian project. I opened a package and tried one and found that is was not as strong as the product that I keep in my bathroom drawer, but found them to be very acceptable for the price.  I have tucked a few of them in my purse for times that I need to floss when away from home.  They are going to work just fine for my project.</li>
    <li> really cool and handy.</li>
    <li> Perfect in all occasions</li>
    <li> Very handy!  Packaged in groups of 24 in small zipper bags.  Perfect for carrying in lunch box/bag, purse, overnight kit, car, wallet.  Great for work.  The floss is waxed and sturdy.  I would buy again.</li>
    <li> These are great for putting in your purse or having in your pocket.  My kids used to be able to use a whole roll of string floss by pull-pull-pulling it all out all over the floor.  Now that isn&#x27;t a problem anymore with these handy packs.</li>
    <li> Ready to use anytime or place. Pack in your pocketbook.pocket or suitcase.</li>
    <li> I used to buy the Crest packets, but they seem to have been discontinued.  These are cheap and functional - no complaints.  It&#x27;s not a foil packet so may not hold up as waterproof as the Crest ones, but that&#x27;s not important to me.</li>
    <li> Bought for our guests at our wedding. Great because they&#x27;re individually wrapped so there was no risk of contamination.</li>
    <li> Bought these to give out to patients at an inpatient hospital for a pilot to provide comfort items during their stay.  Having tried one for myself to test it, it has plenty of floss, is easy to use, no complaints received from the patients.  Well priced.</li>
    <li> This is an item for my husband who always looking for floss we were at a restaurant. He keeps one in his wallet and removes it whenever he needs it.</li>
    <li> Great product, I keep 3 of them in my wallet.</li>
    <li> GREAT PRODUCT!  So thin and easy to slip into a wallet or pocket.  So small and light it&#x27;s like a piece of paper.  I take with me everywhere.  After a dinner out I excuse myself to rest room and do a quick floss, then ready to head out for the night. Great product, highly recommend.</li>
    <li> These are great for on the go.  Very convenient.</li>
    <li> Nice idea, but not sweet. Very minty and tingly on gums amd tongue.</li>
    <li> What a great concept.  This is perfect for my purse without weighing it down.  I just throw a couple into my bag and it&#x27;s there when I need it.</li>
    <li> Great for travel, or stick a few in your wallet, purse, briefcase, office, or car.</li>
    <li> I am obsessed with floss and I&#x27;m constantly flossing my teeth (everywhere but in private obviously), mainly because I have some gaps and a problem with a botched hemisection on my back two molars.  I typically carry glide floss and G.U.M floss sticks so when I saw these I thought they would be ideal to keep in my pocket book for on-the-go travel.  Not so, unless the flosser has Jessica Lange type gaps between teeth, the dental floss will not work.  The floss is far too thick and I mean string-like thick.  The first time I used them I was afraid I would pull my teeth out.  So, bottom line, if your gaps are big go for it, but not for me.....</li>
    <li> Great for Travel&amp;#62;Work Locker</li>
    <li> I put them in welcome bags for a wedding</li>
    <li> Great product!  Reminds me of dental tape with a nice minty flavor.</li>
    <li> They are acceptable for limited uses, e.g., in ones wallet for an emergency. The floss itself claims to be waxed (and may be) but doesn&#x27;t seem to slip as smoothly as a Glide product which I used to use but is no longer available. Also the floss seems to not be quite as strong as normal floss or even the prior Glide product and occasionally breaks. The Glide floss group changed parent companies and their single use packets are no longer made so this appears to be the best that is available.</li>
    <li> Great idea. I used them in bathroom baskets at a wedding reception for the guests. Each one individually wrapped and sanitary for on-the-go use. Have extra to keep in my handbag.  Strong, did not fray when used.</li>
    <li> We have these stashed in the cars, end tables, nightstands, and in the bathroom.  Easy to open with just the right amount of floss.  Feels cleaner than the little containers of floss and so much easier to have in your purse.  Good purchase.</li>
    <li> Who knew these existed?  This is so handy.</li>
    <li> Quick delivery. Economical</li>
    <li> Convenient, waxed minted floss. Easy to carry. Sturdy packaging won&#x27;t tear open in your purse or pocket. Lightweight and not bulky. What more can you ask for?</li>
    <li> These were perfect for a contribution to a homeless shelter, the packaging was right and being a one use only item they provided what was needed at a great price, I will definitely purchase again for contributions and my own personal use.</li>
    <li> We used these in a dental wellness packet for our organization.  They went over really well!</li>
    <li> Great little floss packets. They make it easy to floss. I&#x27;m lazy and don&#x27;t like wrapping my fingers in the floss so these are great. They are a good price too. Helps motivate me to floss more and they are a tiny bit minty but not too much. Would buy again.</li>
