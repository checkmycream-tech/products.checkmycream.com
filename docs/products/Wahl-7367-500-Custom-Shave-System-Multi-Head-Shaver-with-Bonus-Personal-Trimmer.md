<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Excellent shaver, very practical. I use it almost on a daily basis and not only for my face but for my arms and legs. Easy to use and clean.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe more people don&#x27;t know about this. And why in the world would Wahl sell a separate &#x27;bump fighting&#x27; electric razor that doesn&#x27;t use the sensitive screen that comes on this one?!? THIS is the real bump fighter razor, not that gold one Wahl sells. That gold one uses the close screen- which will probably give you bumps if you&#x27;re prone to them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are prone to ingrown hairs- white, African American, etc, this Wahl razor is one of three tools that should be in your toolbox. The three are:&lt;br /&gt;1) Clippers like the Conair that can be used to leave some facial hair length, thus preventing any ingrown hairs. (But it&#x27;s hard to cut around the jaw line and next without nicking yourself!)&lt;br /&gt;2) Bump Fighter wet shave razor (I like this one a lot- close, but not too close. But it&#x27;s not sold everywhere, and you need replacement cartridges fairly often to help keep your skin clear from infection.)&lt;br /&gt;3) THIS Wahl razor using the SENSITIVE screen. (Simply works. Not too close, not too irritating, no bumps.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I believe the sensitive screen gets about as close as the Bump Fighter, but obviously doesn&#x27;t require the wet shaving process. Sure, it&#x27;s loud- really loud. But it works fantastically. My advice for bump prone shavers- try this Wahl one using the SENSITIVE screen for 1 week. Then throw the closer screens out that come with it. Never look back.</li>
    <li> Over the years I have tried many razors but Wahl shaves the closest. The long hair trimmer is much better than most I have used even on more expensive shavers. Another major advantage of this product is the replacement head and cutter is reasonably priced unlike other shavers where the parts can be as expensive as the razor. I had a problem with the first one I received but Amazon replace with no hassle!</li>
    <li> This Wahl 7367-500 Custom Shaver works great.  However, like ALL those that my husband has had in the past, it is very noisy.  VERY noisy.  Worth the money for the quality shave (he says), though.</li>
    <li> I have had this shaving system for several weeks and I am very satisfied with it&#x27;s performance. It gives a closer shave than any other electric shaver that I have owned. Great price.</li>
    <li> This is a very good electric razor. But I have a very thick beard and sharp jawline....I am also trying to go electric from expensive blades..... the transition has taken a few weeks for the upper part of my face.... but is not working at all for my neck...... If you are in this boat ....you may need to purchase a more expensive razor to get the job done otherwise......... it is truly great for the money....</li>
    <li> AFTER READING ALL THE GOOD REVIEWS ON THIS WAHL SHAVER I DECEIDED TO BUY ONE ON 6-9-2010. THREE WEEKS LATER THE ATTACHED TRIMMER LITERALLY FELL APART. I CONTACTED AMAZON AND THEY IMMEDIATELY SENT ME A REPLACEMENT. AFTER LESS THEN ONE WEEK OF USING THE NEW REPLACEMENT THE SHUT OFF SWITCH DIDN&#x27;T WORK. THE ONLY WAY IT WOULD SHUT OFF WAS BY LETTING THE BATTERY RUN OUT. WITH TWO WAHL SHAVERS GOING BAD IN LESS THEN A MONTH, THERE WON&#x27;T BE A THIRD. I&#x27;M RECEIVING A FULL REFUND AS OF 7-9-2010. ALSO TAKE NOTE THAT \\&quot;AMAZON SERVICE WAS EXCELLENT THOUGHOUT THESE PROBLEMS AND AMAZON WAS WHO I BOUGHT IT THOUGH\\&quot;. ALSO TAKE NOTE, I CONTACTED WAHL AND FOUND THEIR COMPANY LACKING AMAZON SERVICE.</li>
    <li> I bought this shaver based upon the reputation of Wahl supposedly being good quality. I didn&#x27;t mind paying over $60.00 for a decent quality shaver. I am terribly disappointed!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The construction is of light, cheap plastic. It does not have a solid feel to it. I could have lived with that if it gave a good shave. After charging the shaver for the required time I tried it out. It sounds like a lawnmower. It vibrates almost as much as the 5 hp vibratory plate compactor I use to compact stone with! My hand and face were both numb from the intense vibration after I finished shaving. As I went over parts of the jaw bone I felt my teeth tingling from the vibration.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It gave an okay shave. I&#x27;ve had better from a $20 Remington AND without the discomfort the Wahl gives!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is going back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Save your money and get something else.</li>
    <li> This shaver is okay. Not like I recall from years back. It seems less able to shave as well. It seems less noisy now but shaves slower; not as close/fast as before.  Surprising since it looks like the same shaver. Others have commented on the missed areas when shaving and I agree.  This would not be my first choice as a shaver. The price is okay but there are better shavers in this price range. I still have doubts as to whether this shaver is made in USA. The shaver itself might be, but it is not indicated on the unit.  Maybe the components are bought outside and assembled in USA.  Good luck with yours if you decide to try it.  You may like this shaver. But it is clunky and not a quality unit.</li>
    <li> I was glad to find the Wahl shaver at such a good price ($30).  I have owned two previous Wahl shavers and was disappointed when I could no longer find them locally.  It shaves fast and close with no irritation.  The trimmer is better than most I have tried - I used two Remingtons and a Braun before finding the replacement Wahl on Amazon.  I disagree with another reviewer about noise.  It&#x27;s quiter than either the Remington or Braun that I still have; but they have been used for a while and most shavers get noisier from continued use. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Since it comes with three heads - marked \\&quot;close\\&quot;, \\&quot;super close\\&quot;, and \\&quot;sensitive\\&quot;, you can almost certainly find one that will work well with your face and beard.  And if you&#x27;re lucky, like me, all three will do a good job, so you&#x27;re effectively getting two replacement heads for free.  The \\&quot;super close\\&quot; is faster for me and not quite as comfortable as the \\&quot;close\\&quot; - my favorite.  The \\&quot;sensitive\\&quot; is a little slower and doesn&#x27;t shave quite as close unless you spend extra time going over areas with heavy beard. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I get four to six shaves on one charge, depending on how much time I spend shaving each use. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;I do not think that the Wahl shaver is quite as durable as some others, but since it comes with a two-year warranty, you can count on two year&#x27;s service.  And hopefully when it finally wears out,you can find a new one at a good price.  At the price of $30, which is about the price of two replacement heads for competing shavers, I&#x27;ve been considering buying another one for the future.</li>
    <li> This product is the best shaver that I have used so far and I have bought a few. It provides a very close and clean shave.   Very nice product</li>
    <li> I have bought Remington and Norelco , the Wahl 4000 beats them all, screen or rotory. It has more power and I can get nine shaves on one recharge. The others I was lucky to get three.The only thing I do&#x27;nt know about is how long it will recharge, because I have only had it for one month.The others were terrible, they would only last about 11/2 to 2 years.If I get the 6 to 7 years they advertise, this is the razor I&#x27;ll always own!</li>
    <li> I was tired of shaving with a regular razor. I searched online for good, sturdy and affordable electric razors and I found the Wahl 7367-500. What a great choice: this rechargeable unit comes with 3 different foil heads for different degrees of closeness, a built-in trimmer and a separate personal trimmer that comes in very handy for annoying nose hair. And the price is just great: a fraction of what other more famous brands cost.  Let&#x27;s \\&quot;face\\&quot; it: the Wahl shaves very close, not as close as a regular blade of course, but no electric razor does anyway. However, if you don&#x27;t want to \\&quot;rip\\&quot; your skin off, use the Wahl: it is much easier, safer, more comfortable, less messy and more time-saver than using even the most \\&quot;cutting edge\\&quot; 3, 4 or 5-blade disposable razors. It does save money AND the environment!  I would definitely recommend this unit.</li>
    <li> We like this shaver.  The sideburn trimmer is only fair, but the shave is smooth like you expect from a Wahl.</li>
    <li> I have owned three wahl shavers and have been very pleased with their performance. The option of changing the foil head makes it easy to pick for my skin sesitivity. always is charged and ready to use.</li>
    <li> I have been using the Wahl razor for many years and I wanted to purchase a new razor.  I used to buy them at Sears, but they no longer sell them.  I ordered the Wahl through Amazon and received it within a few days.  Many thanks for the great service.</li>
    <li> I truly hate this shaver.  This thing is 1970&#x27;s technology.  It can&#x27;t cut longer hairs so I am constantly scouring my face for missed hairs.  The trimmer can cut a maximum of one or maybe two hairs at a time.  If you try to trim your sideburns, it tries to yank them out for you.  The head doesn&#x27;t pivot, so you have to concentrate to keep both blades on your face at a time.  It doesn&#x27;t even cut the hair that close either.  I don&#x27;t consider my beard that heavy so I would hate for someone with a heavy beard to use it.  If I skip a day, I dread using it because it will start to get jammed by the longer hair and start to yank them out (ouch!).      It is also noisy.  My last Braun was far quieter than this thing.  I just hate it.  The plastic is very cheap looking as well.      Overall, there are no redeeming features to this thing.  My theory is that other people have made the purchase and regret it.  They provide good reviews because they want you to endure the agony of using it as well.  I am toying with replacing it, but I am cheap and it does work albeit not well.  I also don&#x27;t have any clue of what to replace it with.  The new generation of shavers are expensive and will only last as long as their batteries.  AAARRRRGGGHHH!</li>
    <li> A week ago I never would have thought I would write this review.  First of all, I do not write reviews.  Second of all, I like German products in general and have been mostly satisfied with the Braun electric razer I used until it broke.  So, I was looking at buying the new Braun which costs $200.00 which I thought was a ridiculous price, so I took a &#x27;flyer&#x27; on the Wahl.  It&#x27;s the best!  I like it better than my Braun!  I like the flexibility of the twin head foil/cutter of the Wahl much better and because of this, I get a closer shave, more quickly.  With the Braun I would have to go over certain areas literally 4, 5, 6 times to really &#x27;get it&#x27;.  The Wahl sounds like a damn chain saw, because it has this sooped up American style car engine for a motor, but it shaves the closest of any electric razor and more quickly, than any I have ever used.  God Bless good &#x27;ole American engineering on this one!  Okay, the plastic housing looks cheesy and non-sexy compared to the Braun, but the Wahl is a loyal lover who satisfies the most.  You know, sometimes we Americans just get the job done.  So, I am writing this review because I think this is the best product and for sure at the best price so I believe it&#x27;s time to thank Wahl and for that matter, sincere and honest and solid American companies.  I do not work for Wahl.  I do not know anyone who does.  I do not even know what State they are in and I do not care.  Just keep up the good work!</li>
    <li> Very satisfied with this shaver, it is hard to beat Wahl, been using them for many years, would highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Here are the facts regarding this product. I have owned 2 of them in the past 11 years and have just ordered the third. They are more effective, less irritating and closer than any other brand of razor I have used in the past. At under $50 they are an astonishing bargain despite the plasticky appearence many others here have commented on. This price is compared to- for example, the $220 price tag I saw on a Norelco shaver earlier in the week. Even if they were sloghtly less durable (and my expereince says they aren&#x27;t) I could buy five of them before I reached the price of the Norelco.     Finally, I like the fact that these are still made in the USA. Given the absurd number of formerly American products now being banged out by slave labor in China, I am heartened that Wahl has not bowed to the pressure and is still paying American workers to make these. Frankly, the only way that is likely to continue is if the company sells shavers. So, I am buying one.</li>
    <li> This is the third Wahl shaver that I have purchased.  It does what it is designed to do, very well. The case of the new model is not as substantial as the older models; the fit of the parts is not very precise, however, it shaves just as good as earlier models.  It is probably not worth the MSR but it can be found at a discount.</li>
    <li> I used a Wahl 7040-614 Custom Shave 5000 for several years and never had any problems with it pulling my whiskers. Wahl has discontinued that model. I have tried 3 different Wahl models that are now in production and they ALL pull. I never know when it is going to do it but it pulls about every other time I used it. I sent one back to Amazon and got a refund and took one back to a dealer. I am getting tired of sending them back so I will just put this one in a drawer and leave it there. I am now using a Gillette safety razor. I think it is called the Mach3. It dose a great job and I will continue to use it. I will not buy another Wahl unless I can find the older \\&quot;Custom Shave 5000\\&quot;</li>
    <li> This is my third Wahl Shaver, I stay with Wahl because it&#x27;s the only one I have found with a screen with holes that are big enough to do the job right for me. I use the super close screen, the other Wahl screens and the several other brands shavers I have tried and returned, have smaller holes and I have to shave twice as long and still don&#x27;t get as good a shave.     Maybe this is unique to me but I doubt it. I would think the other brands would do a little research and development and come out with more screen choices also.</li>
    <li> For the price this is a great shaver, and with the three heads you can select the one that works best for your face.  In shaving where there is a few days growth, you have to make sure you don&#x27;t miss any hair, as it tends to miss a few if you&#x27;re not careful. Shaves quite fast with it&#x27;s larger head, and the separate heads can be purchased from Wahl direct, quite economically.</li>
    <li> I think I like this shaver.  There are some downsides:  It&#x27;s not pretty and looks cheap, so if you are into looks this is not the shaver for you.  It is also very, very loud so watch out if you don&#x27;t want to wake up the neighborhood.  The positives: it gives a very nice shave, much closer than the Phillips I had been using.  My face got used to the new blades in a few weeks and ever since then it has been perfect.  The battery seems to last a long time as well, as I will shave for a week before it needs a recharge.  Since giving a good shave is the ultimate test of a shaver, I consider this to be a good, solid purchase.  It also happens to be the only shaver I&#x27;ve seen that is built in the US.  The box says, \\&quot;Finely crafted in the USA of domestic and imported parts.\\&quot;  Doing a little research I found out it is manufactured in Sterling, IL.  Even though most of the extra components such as the power cord, brushes and trimmer are made in China, the shaver itself is a US product and I like that my money is going back into an American community.  I can&#x27;t speak for its longevity as I just bought it a month ago, but I&#x27;ll live with the bad looks and the noise for 5 minutes a day in order to get a close, comfortable shave I will have for the entire day.</li>
    <li> This is a very good deal as you get 3 different heads depending on closeness of shave that you personally desire, plus a bonus trimmer. It comes with warranty if you don&#x27;t like send back full refund, whats not to like.</li>
    <li> My trusty Norelco had died and I needed a replacement that wouldn&#x27;t cost an arm or a leg. I had read various consumer reviews that indicated Wahl was a good value, so I placed an order from a store selling on Amazon, The Natural Health Shoppe. The razor was delivered in a timely manner and I put it to the test. It did a fair to good job on my beard, though I wondered how someone with a thicker growth might have to keep going over and over a spot to get it shaved. It has a very loud motor that still seems a bit underpowered for the job, and the vibration the motor caused was annoying because I had to use this shaver longer to get the job done. In all, it was merely OK, and I decided to return it for a refund - and that&#x27;s where the second part of this review comes in.    I do not recommend The Natural Health Shoppe because they clearly have poor customer service. They waited 48 hours to reply to my initial request for a return label, then delayed another 72 hours in telling me that their policy \\&quot;forbids them from accepting personal care products as returns\\&quot; and sent me over to Wahl. This is clearly a bogus dodge to avoid providing customer satisfaction because any other store will accept such items for refunding, yet they alone cannot. A fair product, and a lousy vendor.</li>
    <li> Excellent buy best shaver and nose trimmer I have ever had and I love the different shaver heads options it makes for a more comfortable shave great buy you wont regret it.</li>
    <li> I used a Wahl electric razor for many years, literally until it wore out. Then I purchased a Norelco as friends had recommended it. I used it about a month, returned it and got my money back. Next came a foil Remington. Same story. Neither razor would shave close. I then ordered a Wahl Shave System 4000. It&#x27;s just like old times, a close, comfortable shave every time. And it cost less than the Norelco and Remington,</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned a triple blade rotary Phillips shaver and a Panasonic linear shaver and I reckon the Wahl performs better. It moves over skin and facial contours more effectively and handles the variation of neck hair and stubble with better consistency than either of those. The Wahl is also a much kinder shaver. The Panasonic in particular required careful operation to avoid skin burn. The deal overall is better because of the inclusion of extra foils and a nasal hair trimmer. It scores much higher than the Panasonic for me just in that it comes with a cord option. The rechargeability packed up on my Panasonic (replacing the batteries didn&#x27;t help) and that was the end of it.    The only gripe I have with the Wahl is that the price appears to reflect the quality of manufacture. It feels light, insubstantial and plastic. The other two were solid, weighty and durable. Although the Panasonic and Phillips didn&#x27;t shave as well, they each lasted a long time (10 years and 15 respectively). That&#x27;s why this Wahl is only the 3rd shaver I&#x27;ve owned. However, it&#x27;s less than a 3rd of the price of either of the other two. The Wahl is probably better value overall then, but if I could have that design with the solidity of the Panasonic I would&#x27;ve been happy to pay more.</li>
    <li> Pros:  1. Holds it&#x27;s charge way longer than I expected.  2. 3 foils choices.  3. I used to use the Super Close foil. Now I am happy with Close.  4. Price is fair.  Cons:  1. Need to chip away or jam several times to trim successfully.  2. Terrible for under arms.</li>
    <li> This is an amazing shaver. It provides me the closest shave I have ever had from an electric shaver. I have had all the over-priced Braun, Norelco, and Panasonic shavers. I haven&#x27;t been happy with their performance. This Wahl is the best: it is fast; it shaves close; and it is reasonably priced. However, I would have liked it better if it were a little less louder than it is. But I can live with it. I haven&#x27;t yet tried the trimmer; so I can&#x27;t comment on it.    If you are in the market for an electric shaver, just get it. You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> Best electric I&#x27;ve used .  closest electric I&#x27;ve used.</li>
    <li> This razor gives a close shave so far.  However, it is the loudest electric razor I&#x27;ve ever had.  Hopefully it has an industrial strength motor that will keep it going forever. I&#x27;m afraid to use this razor if my wife is still sleeping.  It would wake her up for sure.</li>
    <li> Originally I read the other reviews and was optimistic about purchasing this Wahl shaver. I have a pair of wahl clippers for my head and they work great. Not that this shaver doesn&#x27;t work... it does. Not as well as some panasonic or other makes, but it does work.    It&#x27;s extremely loud.  Now let me explain by what I mean by loud. It&#x27;s like a lawnmower. Earth shattering - who needs an alarm clock? Just turn this bad boy on and you&#x27;ll wake the neighbors. Get my point?    Poor quality materials.  This is just a joke really. Made in china junk. Poor plastic and the cover doesn&#x27;t even stay on over the blades.    Shave is just okay.  Used another panasonic model and it cut all the whiskers this wahl left behind.    Awkward to hold.  Very bulky and awkward in the hand. Makes it more difficult to shave, especially since it&#x27;s a foil. Much too wide! This thing is almost 3 inches wide. Might be good if you&#x27;re a giant but not on my face.</li>
    <li> The best men&#x27;s shaver I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
    <li> This shaver packs more power into a cordless shaver than I&#x27;ve ever gotten from a Panasonic or Norelco; it&#x27;s powerful enough that holding it while shaving can numb your fingers from the motor&#x27;s vibration. However, the shaver foils fail too soon, and usually while I&#x27;m shaving the top of my head, which means I end up getting a nice gash cut in my scalp about once a month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wahl needs to put some R&amp;D into toughening up its foils. Be prepared to spend $15 a quarter on replacement foils.</li>
    <li> This was a birthday gift for my son-in-law.  Said this gave him the BEST AND CLOSEST shave he has had using a number of different type of razors.</li>
    <li> He says this is the only brand shaver that does not give shaver burn.  Has tried others and always returns to Wahl.</li>
    <li> Before this shaver I had a Wahl 4400 for 6-7 years.  Loved everthing about it.  The charger ended up going bad and I thought it was the shaver. Oh well.  The 4400 still works great with the charger from the new one.  So I ordered the new one and it shaves great too.  However, the trimmer part sucks.  I think the blades are too far apart and not sharp so it grabs hair and skin.  The trimmer is pretty much unuseable.  I use the trimmer on the old 4400.  I would not recommend this shaver is you use a trimmer at all.</li>
    <li> Made in good old U.S.A. Have used the Wahl Shaver for over seven years and am satisfied with this new one.</li>
    <li> It is nice to enjoy a product and find the same thing again after years. It saves having to make &#x27;major decisions&#x27; and do mega research. Thank you Wahl for know what we guys want.</li>
    <li> I bought the Wahl 4000 to replace an older Wahl model that I loved because it cost less than replacing the cutters and screen.  The 4000 shaver seems to effortlessly suck the hair off your face without any sensation but, the trimmer is about as useful as a dull butter knife to remove hairs too long for the shaver. So, I&#x27;m still using the trimmer portion of my old Wahl.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a number of years, and am just preparing to buy the third. I wore out the first two. After two other brands of rechargeable razors, plus many traditional razors and shave creams, the System 4000 just cuts my beard more closely than any other product. My wife does not get scratched from my tough beard stubble, and that is the final test. The charge holds for about 5 days, so on travel I carry the stand-up charger. The pop-up trimmer works great. My only concern is that Wahl may some day stop making electric razors then what would I do? &lt;br /&gt;</li>
    <li> I purchased my first Wahl 4000 about 5 years ago. I think it is not only the best razor for the price but the best razor available. I have had Braun razors in the past but they are not as good as the Wahl.</li>
    <li> I know that this product works for some, but for me it did not. That is why I decided to return it. Wahl makes great products, but this product was not for me. My skin was too sensitive and the machine irritated it.</li>
    <li> I bought the product for a friend to use at the recommendation of a friend of his.  They have been impressed with how good it was for keeping shaved heads smooth with little to no irritation. Be gentle with the pieces.  One of the foils broke after a few uses.  The replacement was easily purchased (at a low cost) from the Wahl product Web site.  No problems reported since.</li>
    <li> I just ordered my second Wahl 4000 shaver.  I&#x27;m replacing a Wahl 4000 with a weak battery - it&#x27;s been two years - it&#x27;ll be a good spare once I get around to replacing the battery. Yes, the battery life could be longer, but overall it&#x27;s a good shaver for the price.  It shaves close, and I never get razor burn. I pulled out an old Remington I keep as a spare and I was surprised how much better the Wahl performs.</li>
    <li> I have had a Wahl shaver for about 10 years before it finally quit.  The new one I just purchased gets the job done just as well, but it feels so cheap in hand.  The trimmer functions okay, but the fit of battery holder is very poor and does not stay together.  I use my old Wahl trimmer.  Cheap materials are a disappointment, but performance is definetly as good as always.  Another plus is that it&#x27;s the only shaver made in the USA I believe.</li>
    <li> I was unable to find the Wahl Shaver I needed in over two dozen local area stores. Went online and found that Amazon offered exactly what I needed at a very competitive price. Initially talked with Amazon representative who was very courteous and helpful. Ordered online and received the product within 24 hours. I have ordered a multitude of books from Amazon through the years and now will ordering other products.  Tom Wilson</li>
    <li> The Wahl Custom Shave System Shaver is the best electric shaver I have ever used. It gives a better shave than shavers that cost three times as much. You can&#x27;t beat the price.</li>
    <li> very fast delivery, and my husband loves this product.  This is actually his 3rd Wahl shaver.  Can&#x27;t find them in the stores so thank you Amazon</li>
    <li> After trying several other well known brands of shavers, I will stay with the best....Wahl Shavers, because they are American made, do an excellent job, choice of shaving heads, they are quite, easy to use, unlike others, the shaving head and cutter bars last a long time and after daily use, Wahl Shavers will stay dependable and last for years.</li>
    <li> I have owned several Wahl shavers over the years and decided to replace my old one with this unit. Works great and nice close shave. It is a little noisier than the old one, but it&#x27;s not too bad. However, the nose hair trimmer is flimsy and made in China.</li>
    <li> im a cosmetologist and i love this, i do find it eaasier to spay client face or head with water before and while i shave them. this shaver is the best tool i have when i want to get a close up shave- using super close gaurd for ultimate closeness</li>
    <li> This is the only shaver my Dad will use. He goes thru one every couple years. Last one only lasted about 8 months and the switch went out and instead of letting me return it he had me order him a new one because he needed it right away. Dad is 76 years old and has been using this model forever.</li>
    <li> The Wahl 7367-500 is a good product. I just happen to have one that needs excessive charging. Like once every two shaves. Otherwise an ok product.</li>
    <li> I bought this shaver in July, 2007.  It gives a great, close shave.  The smoothness doesn&#x27;t last an entire day, but it&#x27;s far more convenient and less time consuming than using a razor.    The battery lasts a long time before it needs charging and the unit is simple to clean.    I like that 3 different heads came with the shaver, so I could find the right one for my skin.  I recently switched to the &#x27;very close&#x27; shave head, but after the 2nd use, the foil tore.  I emailed Wahl with the issue and received an IMMEDIATE response.  I just received TWO replacement heads yesterday at no cost to me (not even shipping and handling)!    In this age where customers are dealing with multiple phone menus and long waits to get a question answered or an issue fixed, this was EXTREMELY refreshing!  THANK YOU, WAHL!    It&#x27;s nice to buy a great product AND deal with a great company.</li>
    <li> Never having used a shaver before, I was amazed how close a shave I was able to get with this product, which I use after cutting the long hairs with a beard trimmer.</li>
    <li> I bought this model after noticing my barber uses it so figured it must be good and so far is great the cradle is easy to drop in to charge and its a close shave with no bumps never had any more irritation than usual from shaving.</li>
    <li> With a choice of 3 different foils you can&#x27;t help but get a great shave. This shaver performs best with a light touch. Haven&#x27;t needed to use a pre-shave</li>
    <li> Not what I expected.  I replaced it with a Panasonic.  The Wahl would miss hairs on my face. My barber shop uses these to trim the hair on the back of your neck.</li>
    <li> Wahl products are really good.  This machine works really good, but the add said that it will come with a personal trimmer which I didn&#x27;t received, that is the reason why I&#x27;m giving it 3 star and not 5.</li>
    <li> It works grrrrrrrate! I use the supper close and it is just like using a razoe. The trimmer works just as well.</li>
    <li> The Wahl 4000 electric razor I purchased through Amazon comes with 3 shaving screens.  I have been using the one for the closest shave.  It has been comfortable to use and closer shaving than the Norelco I was using before.  I have been very pleased with the results. &lt;br /&gt;   My only disappointment has been with the side trimmer (for use with trimming side burns, etc.)  It is not easy to use without pulling hair.  And it is not as effective in trimming as other razors I have had. &lt;br /&gt;   If you don&#x27;t need the side trimmer, this razor is the best I have ever had -- more like a \\&quot;blade-close shave\\&quot; than any other razor I have owned.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned Norelco, Remington, Braun, Panasonic, and Wahl. Of the lot, the Wahl has provided the closest shave with the greatest comfort. It has also been the most durable. It&#x27;s beginning to show its age now, so I probably will replace it soon, but after more than 10 years of reliable service, it&#x27;s still chugging along. I&#x27;m down to the last of three screens that came with the unit. The trimmer still works. The charger \\&quot;stand\\&quot;--a cheap little device that relied on gravity to make the electrical contact--never really worked well. I got tired of messing with it and just plugged the cord directly into the shaver. That worked fine for about 6 years, until the contacts in the plug loosened to the point wherein they wouldn&#x27;t work reliably. I cut the plug off and replaced it with a couple of crimp-style splice connectors, which I tightly crimped onto the cord but crimped only enough to make a snug fit on the shaver contacts. I&#x27;ve been running it that way for the past 4 years, and it works great. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;If that seems like a lot of fuss to endure for a shaver I&#x27;ve given a 5-star rating, here&#x27;s a bit of context that should help to explain. The other shavers I&#x27;ve used have never given me more than a few years of service before they died. Their biggest consistent deficiency was failure to hold a charge; with no way to connect the power cord directly to the shaver, that&#x27;s the end of the shaver&#x27;s useful life. While they did function, none had ALL of the Wahl&#x27;s advantages. Some were comfortable but didn&#x27;t shave closely enough; or shaved closely but ravaged my face; or didn&#x27;t have a trimmer; or pulled the hairs (OUCH!); or the screen was too fine or prone to clogging. The Wahl is the only shaver that had the best of all those features, and still provided a cord configuration that enabled me to keep the doggone thing running...and it&#x27;s still running! &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;So, if you&#x27;re not inclined to futz with a power cord, fair enough; deduct 4 years from my 10 years of reported usage, and there&#x27;s your basis of comparison. Of course, it has been 10 years or more since I tried any of the other shavers. Maybe they&#x27;ve all improved in that time...even the Wahl. But based on my experience with the venerable old shaver I&#x27;m still using, when it finally dies, I&#x27;ll buy another Wahl with confidence.</li>
    <li> My reaction when I opened this shaver was one of complete disappointment. It is the worst quality build of any product I have seen since the early &#x27;Made in Japan&#x27; days.</li>
    <li> shaver does what it says. The problem is not a machine malfunction but it gives my face bumps all over . I had to stop using it because it kind of burned my skin. It is very powerful and it does give you a clean shave, but the results after shave went bad for me. Maybe if your skin is not that sensitive, will do the job for you.</li>
    <li> I tried and it and REALLY wanted to like it.  The fast shave I loved!  However even after using it for 3 weeks I could not get a close enough shave to get myself to keep it.  Three stars because it is not bad, it just is not great either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This IS the bump free shaver just in a different plastic body.  Unless you need the made in China trimmer I would just get the black bump free one and save some money.  The foils are interchangeable per Wahl and the cutters are exactly the same as well.  I suspect the 5 star one also is the same other then you can&#x27;t return it but get a 5 year warrantee on it.  The warrantee is 3 years on the bump free while only 2 years on this one.  The shavers are made in the USA so you have to like that!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have thick hairs and this powers through them like it was nothing.  This and the Remington have been the only foil shavers I&#x27;ve found to have the power to be able to do this without the motor being taxed.  To be fair it has been at least 12 years since I&#x27;ve used a Braun or Panasonic so maybe they are better now?  After an under 3 minute shave my face feels mostly smooth.  Spending an extra minute or two doesn&#x27;t get any smoother.  The negative was that in under 6 hours, about lunch time, I really could use a touch up shave using the super close foil.  I do NOT want to shave twice a day!  While that was better then a Norelco for me in half the time it was not as good as a Braun or Remington where I go all day, 8 to 10 hours before I would need a touch up.  Using the Close foil resulted in needing a touch shave within 2 hours for me.  The sensitive foil simply was not useful for me at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It took a couple weeks of daily use to get those results.  It really did take at least that long to get used to the shave and get okay results without irritation.  In the third week there was no improvement to the closeness of the shave and I needed and wanted to stop there as I was done with it and was the last day I could still return it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I gave three stars because it was not as bad a shave as a rotary but not as close as a good foil shaver can and should be when you find the brand(s) that work for you.  If this one works for you I think you&#x27;ll like it after giving it time to get over the learning curve of using it and your skin adjusts to the foils.  It gives probably the fastest shave of any foil out there.  It is short on features but the ability to use it plugged in it does have and that by far is the most important feature to have.  The foils you can buy separately and they are cheap and a cutter/foil combo is well under $20.  Clearly Wahl and Remington are the value leaders!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fit and finish is the real negative.  Like GM cars of the &#x27;80, the plastic pieces of the body do not give the appearance of quality and the pieces do not fit nice and flush as they do on a Braun for example even though the Braun also is all plastic.  It doesn&#x27;t hurt the shaver but it does look cheap.  The bag is cheesy cheap as well and the charging stand literally fell apart just trying to use it.  Either include nice good ones or do not include them as it just makes the package appear too cheap making the buyer suspect of the quality of the shaver as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love my made in USA Wahl hair clippers but not the shave I got with this shaver.  Maybe they can make a different screen with holes more like the close one but a thinner screen like a Remington?  Probably that would be all it would take.</li>
    <li> I had intended to buy one of the Remingtons until I researched these consumer evals, which were jammed with horror stories about them.  One man suggested Wahl, which I had never heard of, and when he mentioned that it was the last American manufactured razor, that sealed the deal.  It came with 3 differently gauged foils.  The charging base was unassembled for some reason, which I quickly remedied with some model glue.  The cleaning brush is utterly worthless; the fact that I use an old toothbrush says it all. &lt;br /&gt; I have exceptionally bad luck with merchants, so of course, mine was the one that slipped through quality control and arrived with a misaligned grip.  This did not affect its performance, which is first rate, and I suppose most men could just grin and bear it, but I returned it for replacement as my relationship with merchants is essentially a state of war.  In summary, well worth the low price, in my opinion.</li>
    <li> Works great, shaves closer than my Remington and the replacement screens and cutter are better priced by far. Used over a month now and so far very satisfied.</li>
    <li> Positive: Shaves Close&lt;br /&gt;Positive: Quick Shave&lt;br /&gt;Positive: Comfortable Shave&lt;br /&gt;Positive: Easy to Clean&lt;br /&gt;Positive: No need for cord except to charge the battery&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Negative: Made in China but was Made in America&lt;br /&gt;Negative: Hair Trim Extension needs a redesign and can be uncomfortable</li>
    <li> This is a very good and efficient shaver.  This is a replacement for another Wahl shaver that I wore out over the years.  Since I was sent TWO of them, having ordered ONE but was charged for two, I have a spare if anyone is interested. With three different shaving screens, it will deliver a shave for any type beard.   Lloyd Woolley</li>
    <li> I am 76 years old. Over the years, I must have tried all brands of Shavers. Wahl has been the best ever. Got a great deal of this most recent purchase from Amazon. I always check Amazon first beefore I buy anything. Bob</li>
    <li> This shaver shaves closer than any shaver I have ever used. I also have a Wahl hair cutting kit that works equally well. Both are made in the USA. The price for both were very reasonable. I think that the rest of the makers of shavers (all foreign) will have a hard time beating Wahl for price, performance, and even for customer service that I see other reviewers have mentioned.</li>
    <li> Pros;&lt;br /&gt;1. Made in the US,&lt;br /&gt;2. Three choices for the replacement screens depending on skin type,&lt;br /&gt;3. Inexpensive replacement screens &amp; cutters if ordered direct from Wahl (double advantage)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons;&lt;br /&gt;1. Only fair trimmer. While better then the Braun design, this isn&#x27;t as good as the Remington Microscreen version,&lt;br /&gt;2. Uses a ineffecient &#x27;brick&#x27; transformer as opposed to a switching design which is what most of the better devices are using now. It&#x27;s not heavy, but it is still a old style transformer,&lt;br /&gt;3. Doesn&#x27;t seem to cut as well as the Remington, but better than the single head Braun. I perfer a head that is at a 90 degree angle to the body, not a 45 degree as this is,&lt;br /&gt;4. That separate round trimmer didn&#x27;t really impress me.&lt;br /&gt;5. Non repleceable battery (?).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Summery; With some modifications it would be a good shaver.</li>
    <li> This item is awesome, i&#x27;ve been looking for a shaver that would give me a close shave since I am not able to use razors and this electric shaver is doing a wonderful job.</li>
    <li> again wahl is the best for my husband, he has shaved with the wahl for years so he wanted to stay with the same one.</li>
    <li> The Wahl shaver works wonderfully. I&#x27;ve had mine since mid-January. The battery life is pretty good-used it for 2 1/2 weeks before charging(every other day NOT everyday). Its a close shave and the attached trimmer is really sharp and works great for getting those pesky odd hairs and for trimming the mustache.   There are a few drawbacks:   The attached trimmer is more difficult than it should be to open.  This shaver is LOUD. Its louder than the clippers I use to cut my hair!   The charging base is rather shoddy and comes apart easily.   Besides that its a great shaver and I highly recommend it.   I have no comment on the personal trimmer as I have yet to use it.</li>
    <li> This purchase was to replace my Dynaflex shaver which I have used for 13 years with only one repair. The grip of the 4000 is better than before and I would recomend it for anyone that prefers a foil razor.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried other brands, but the Wahl razor with Super Close screen has been the only razor that is effective with my beard. My beard grows in at an angle almost parallel to my skin and before trying Wahl about 10 years ago, I frequently suffered ingrown hairs on my neck.    My first Wahl lasted about 10 years before it would no longer accept a charge. After trying a triple head electric razor unsuccessfully, I bought my new Wahl and have been happy with it. The only drawback has been it&#x27;s slightly larger size which I dealt with by finding a slightly larger space in which to store it.</li>
    <li> After years of rebuilding my System 4000 shavers, I decided to break down and get a new unit as the cost for replacement parts this time were so close to the Amazon price for the new model. Still has the feature I like most of the electric shavers I&#x27;ve used, the different foil heads. I&#x27;ve tried other brands and still kept with the System 4000 for the better shave I get with the close and super-close foil heads. With the new model the shape is easier to hold and I think it is a little lighter. Seems that the cutters and foil heads are identical to the old in design, but then if they work why change right? This one isn&#x27;t made with too many &#x27;customer serviceable&#x27; components like the older version. Its ability to work corded is better than the 4000 model. The models I had of those were dead if the battery was dead, and wouldn&#x27;t work plugged in until the battery was charged. It is overall still worthy of checking out if you&#x27;re looking for a really good shaver.</li>
    <li> i find this a first class razor for me and must congratulate amazon on the fast delivery.</li>
    <li> I had avoided buying a new shaver to replace my old Remington Microscreen (bought at Fedco years before they closed, for those in Southern California just to show you how long I have owned that one). I never found any I liked, so I just kept the Remington going -- new batteries once, new screen and cutters, etc. I also didn&#x27;t like the fact that any new models, including new Remingtons, were made outside the U.S. and often in China.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I happened to stumble across this Wahl shaver, did a little checking, and found that it is well-liked by owners, and as a bonus is actually made in the U.S. Now, after owning it for a short while, I find that it is a great little shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I finally charged it for the first time since I originally charged it, which means it went almost a month on a single charge, and I use it almost daily. On the few times i let my beard grow a little I find that the different heads allow me to cut longer growth with no pulling at all; after the initial shave I switch to the closest head and finish off for a remarkably close shave -- better than I ever obtained with any other shaver or razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The build quality is excellent, it is very light to hold, and the pop-out trimmer works superbly. I hope this shaver is available for a long time, because if mine ever needs replacing, I want another just like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This may just be the best shaver available. And the bonus trimmer is quite nice as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: It keeps impressing me more and more. Charge lasts forever, and it shaves so amazingly close, I can&#x27;t even match the closeness with a blade razor. This may be the best shaver you can buy.</li>
    <li> I have used Wahl Shavers for years and have always been more than satisfied with their performance, quality, and reliability. I can get as good a shave and closeness as a manual razor. I always use the &amp;#34;super close&amp;#34; screen only. As an added plus  they are still MADE IN USA!!!</li>
    <li> I as a barber only require the best products. Most efficient and durable. I use it on many of my clients and 9 out of 10 ask me where they can buy one or if I can get em one... Only complaint was the nose hair trimmer that it came wit didn&#x27;t work...</li>
    <li> This is my 5th wall shaver and I am always satified with the product. &lt;br /&gt;It shaves close without razor burn and always gives a good looking shave.</li>
    <li> I purchased this shaver 6 weeks ago after being very happy with a Wahl 4400 which I retired after inexpensively rebuilding it myself several times over 6 years.  The new shaver arrived quickly direct from Amazon and the price was right at $40.88 including shipping and instant promo discount.  (It also included a bonus personal nose/ear trimmer of which I have a drawer full of and none work very well).  The shave is great and powerful enough for a week&#x27;s shaves on a single charge, but be aware that the powerful Wahl&#x27;s are louder than other brands.  Unfortunatly, the pop up trimmer snagged and pulled my sideburns and neck hair, so I returned it to Wahl for repair per their advice.  I received it back 3 weeks later along with a spare foil I had requested (although not the exact one I requested) to offset my $10 return shipping cost. Sadly, the pop up trimmer still snags hair, therefore I can only recommend the shaver if the trimmer is not important to you.</li>
    <li> Does a decent job.  Not as close as a blade. Has a hard time with hairs at the neck line that don&#x27;t grow in a uniform direction.  No irritation whatsoever.</li>
    <li> ...and a great bargain. Works well, charge lasts a long time. This is only my second razor in 30 years(the first was a Wahl too).</li>
    <li> i din&#x27;t get what the ofered in the pictures, the seller show this produc with a cool stand base support to recharge ur shaver, but intead you get a cheap ugly cable, no practical</li>
    <li> I chose this rating only because of the faulty on-off switch. Although this razor is almost as close shaving as a wet razor&lt;br /&gt;it is the bad switch that is very frustrating. I have to turn it off and on about 10-30 times to complete a shave OR keep thumb&lt;br /&gt;pressure on the switch which makes it really difficult to shave accurately. The irony of it all is that the faulty switch has progressively gotten worse with use.I should have returned it ASAP when it started malfunctioning.  I have had this about two months.</li>
    <li> I have tried many electric razors in my life time and this one is one of the best. You would think for the price that it can&#x27;t&lt;br /&gt;be as good as those much higher priced shavers but be leave me it is. Beleave me in my life time i have tried all the big name&lt;br /&gt;brands. The close and super close sreens are the two you should get. The Whal 7367-500 comes with all the heads you&#x27;ll need.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this same model razor for many years &amp; this new one really seems to work the best of them all.</li>
    <li> This is a good electric shaver.  I prefer it to the all black model that Wahl also sells.  This one is more durable with a seemingly more powerful motor.  I wouldn&#x27;t say that it shaves as close as a razor, but it&#x27;s very good.  I definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> I tried this shaver after a relative suggested it.  I liked that the razor itself is US made.  It shaves as well, if not better, than the more expensive imports and I have a fairly tough beard.  The personal trimmer that came with the system didn&#x27;t work.  I returned it to Wahl and they promptly and politely exchanged it.</li>
    <li> It shaves well, but the battery will not fully charge. Result lower cutting speeds, iffy results. Great shaver, bad results, knotty face.</li>
    <li> My husband owned a Wahl &amp; had it for years.  At least 10.  It finally wore out or got damaged in the many moves we did; although he was still using it just fine.  I surprised him with a very expensive Norelco (on sale) which he tried and just mentioned that he really liked the Wahl better - trying not to hurt my feelings.  He swapped his father for the expensive Braun, with the cleaning system, that dad got for Christmas and STILL wanted another Wahl.  So we gave the Norelco and Braun away &amp; I bought this Wahl for him.  He likes the different heads &amp; the overall handling of it fits his face with a good shave (as he puts it).  I even went so far as to buy him a second one to keep on our boat when we&#x27;re traveling.</li>
    <li> Wahl has consistently made high quality products in my experience and this is no different. I was looking for an everyday shaver that cuts close with minimal irritation. I found it and am very pleased.</li>
    <li> You have to go over the same spot over and over again to get it shaved and its not very close.  The close shave adapter that came with it was broken and I didn&#x27;t notice until I cut my head with the metal shards sticking out.  I&#x27;m giving it two stars only because of the personal groomer that I really like.  I would not recommend this to anyone if you really like a close shave.</li>
    <li> This is a great close shave! Being gentle with the machine and the attachments goes a long way!! The heads are awesome, stretches out the longevity of the machine and attachments. Careful cleaning prevents tearing the attachment screen. You get what  you need when you have separate attachments and don&#x27;t stress just one.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Wahl for years but at Christmas I was gifted a Remington MS280 Titanium.  Almost six months later I&#x27;m back to Wahl.  Sure it&#x27;s noisy but it gives a great shave and isn&#x27;t that what we are looking for?  No bells, whistles, or flat screens to watch the news while you are shaving.  Just a good shave (and made in America!).  Please keep making them Wahl and keep selling them Amazon.  A great product.</li>
    <li> This is the second Wahl electric shaver I have purchased for my husband.  He says it works well, and this time it came with a trimmer.  Great.</li>
    <li> Had item previously and was very satisfied. I only had to reorder when Nursing Home dropped it and broke it.</li>
    <li> Does not cut  too close I was thinking it was going to cut a little closer but it&#x27;s a great deal!</li>
    <li> Great shaver!  The design of the shaver head makes all the difference in the world plus having the convenient trimmer.</li>
    <li> I have used Andis for years to keep my head bald and I have been okay with the results, okay not thrilled.  I will never use clippers again, after using the Wahl shaver!!!</li>
    <li> BECAUSE IT HAS A GREAT RATING I HAVE NEVER OWNED ONE AND ITS THE BEAST OF THE BEST TO OWN THANKS SO VERY MUCH</li>
    <li> I was told by my barbers that Wahl was good. They used it as well on their customers so that was a sign for me to buy. When I did buy it, it gave me a smooth shave. It&#x27;s not rough on your skin either like clippers are.</li>
    <li> This was excellent value for the money got it quickly and worked well  and it was a great gift idea for the value</li>
    <li> I bought this shaver a few weeks ago. I have previously used Remington &amp; Braun. To be honest I had never heard of Wahl before but it was a good price at my local store. At first I thought the multi-head idea was just a gimmick but I have to tell you - I have never gotten as close a shave with any other shaver than I have with this one using the \\&quot;super close\\&quot; shaving head. I like being able to choose a particular head based on the level of growth. Although it feels plasticky (ok, it is plastic!) and somewhat cheap, the shave is remarkable and a real delight. Replacement heads and cutters are less than competing brands. I&#x27;m very happy with my choice.     UPDATE: FEB/2011: This shaver doesn&#x27;t fail to impress. It still gives a great shave. The blades last forever (still haven&#x27;t changed them!) and the Super Close foil gives an incredibly close, clean shave. I love it.</li>
    <li> Works  well!  Wahl makes good products and I have always been pleased with their efforts.  Would recommend to every one.</li>
    <li> Is easy to use and easy to keep bold. Material is kind of delicate but in average this machine works great ;)</li>
    <li> Bought this as a Christmas present for my boyfriend and he loves it  I totally recommend it for the man or woman in your life .</li>
    <li> Used once an foil heads split haven&#x27;t used since.Replacement is cheap but why bother. Great tool just those foil covers will not last long.</li>
    <li> I recently purchased this iten after having it used on me at a former barbershop a few years ago, I asked the guy where he got these shaver from...Well he wouldn&#x27;t tell me. Anyway I have searched over and over again only to just stumble to find it here on AMAZON. GREAT PRODUCT that not only did I buy one for my current barber which he loved it, That I did also get one. The only problem that I have with this shaver system is that it DIDN&#x27;T come with the charger stand for my shaver (NOT HAPPY ABOUT THAT) Overal a great buy..</li>
    <li> Have only  used for a couple weeks.. Seems as good as my last Wahl. Battery seems to hold charge longer time will tell. Has more vibration than my old ID Wahl but I like it and the price..</li>
    <li> To shave face and trim around ears. I have used Remington and Norelco shavers in the past, both of which outperformed the Wahl by far; customers should know that the Wahl is just not up to the competition. The worst thing of all was the trimmer on the shaver very hard to open I thought it was going to break.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Bob Albert</li>
    <li> Works very well. My only issues are with the foils, they break too easy. Charges well, last for a full shave and it&#x27;s easy to use and clean.</li>
    <li> My husband has used his Wahl razor for so many years that I&#x27;ve lost count.  It got to the point where he finally decided that he wanted another (seemed like the motor was slowing down).  The replacement was exactly what he wanted - motor back to full power and very pleased.  If this one lasts as long as the first one, it will be well worth it.</li>
    <li> This is my second Wahl 4000 (or 7367-500) Shaver.  The first one is about 7 years old and still runs fine but the battery doesn&#x27;t really hold its charge anymore.  Since I had to keep it on the charger nightly in order to use it, I decided to get a new one. I highly recommend them...it&#x27;s a good product.</li>
    <li> This is my second Wahl 5000 shave system! I have to admit: it&#x27;s not the best made product! The first pair I had, the blades kept coming loose. This pair, the charger doesn&#x27;t work! Thank goodness I have the charger from the first pair. But when you can get them working, they do a good job!</li>
    <li> Great Deal.  The Wahl  shaver cuts very well and a great deal.  I use it on my head too, love it.</li>
    <li> This product is for my son who will be leaving for college.  He loves them. He will use them at school.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a man that can not use disposable razors or straight razors because my skin is too sensitive and this is perfect. This is what my barber uses and thats the reason i purchased it. Great product and the bonus nose trimmer was also great.</li>
    <li> Every day my husband states this is the best razor I have ever used.  He has tried many others and continually praises his \\&quot;Wahl\\&quot;.</li>
    <li> After nine months I have to say this shaver was a mistake to buy. The first one had a broken switch, replaced by Amazon. The second one has gone through 3 foil sets in nine months, they get holes quickly. It shaves okay but the cord will not stay plugged into the shaver while using it. The trimmer rips the hair out if shaving the back of your neck. It is going in the trash as soon as I get a better brand of shaver. I try to only leave good reviews but I am not pleased this time....</li>
    <li> This razor is a fantastic product. It has a cord to charge, but runs on a battery. My husband loves it gives him a close shave. We will continue to use this brand.</li>
    <li> a little bit disappointed by the product because this product is not made for my kind of beard, there are some places that I need to put a very good pressure to shave which causes me to the iritation but I think it is going to be nice for my head.</li>
    <li> I have been using the Wahl razor for years.  I always loved them.  I&#x27;ve lost count how many I purchased.  The trimmer on my old one fell apart so I ordered a new one.  The trimmer on the new one will not stay open on its own.  I must keep my thumb on it to hold it open.  I feel ripped off.  I&#x27;m not going to spend the money on postage to return it.  I have ordered a number of these over the years from Amazon.  I won&#x27;t do that again.</li>
    <li> Purchased on April 7, 2013 and on this date October 14,2013 I could say that this machine is no longer working. From the date of pursuance I experienced problems with this item, but it at least worked. Didn&#x27;t pay it much attention to it but did notice after time the power and ability to cut diminished all together. Woke up today grab this horrible machine and went into the bathroom to use it, and nothing, no sound no movement no cutting now what. Very very disappointed&lt;br /&gt;Save yourself the trouble just don&#x27;t buy!&lt;br /&gt;Peace</li>
    <li> In the past I have always used regular razors but tried a couple of electric ones and did not like them. This is the first electric razor that I actually use on a daily basis. It gives a close shave. I also like the nose hair trimmer because it is rounded on the end and you can really use it without getting cut.</li>
    <li> The Wahl shaver is a good product and performs well. The multi-head option is what made me purchase this over some of the similarly rated shavers. This Wahl holds its charge and I can go a full week without recharging, while using it daily for about 5 minutes. As was stated by previous customers, this thing is LOUD! It sounds like a mini chainsaw, but the comfort level of the shave is not comparable to the loud sound.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ultimately, I would recommend this shaver; it is versatile and does a good job of shaving your hair to various lengths depending on which shaving head you use.</li>
    <li> I have used a Wahl Razor for several years and my wife had been buying them at Sears. They no longer carry them so she got on line and found it through Amazon. I like it because it is made in America</li>
    <li> In use for multiple years. Both items do really good job!</li>
    <li> Well the shaver was great while it lasted what happened was I had it for maybe almost 3 weeks when the battery inside died  would not hold a charge and I&#x27;m right now in the process of getting a replacement</li>
    <li> Bought for hubby.. He loves it.. He shaves his head bald so.. He said it works good!</li>
    <li> I never got it. It was sent to my son-in-law and he never got it. No one signed for it.</li>
    <li> Good shaver.... no complaints... it leaves a few hairs but easy shave with razor. trimmer is good for nose hairs.</li>
    <li> The shaver quit working completely after 30 days. Prior to that the trimmer would not snap back in place and it was louder than the lawn mower! Had to send back to Wahl for repair or replacement. Very disappointing. The last Wahl shaver we purchased was in 1995 and lasted all these years.</li>
    <li> I bought this shaver for my husband and he is thrilled with it. It is a great product and I would highly recommend it. He often only gets around to shaving once per week, and this electric razor zips through his thick whiskers like a lawn mower.</li>
    <li> This is my 2nd Wahl razor - I purchased one several years ago and really liked it.  I did have some trouble because the foil heads seemed to break easily.  Tried a few other brands of razors (in the $50-$75 range) over the last few years only to decide that I was most happy with the Wahl even with the foil head issue.  I was getting ready to head out of town for the weekend when my last razor finally died on me.  I couldn&#x27;t find one (a Wahl) in a local store, but knew what I wanted and decided to check Amazon.  They had it for a lower price than ordering it from Walmart and having to wait to pick it up at the local store.  So I ordered in Wednesday afternoon, and with our Prime membership along with a small extra charge for next day delivery had my brand new razor on my porch Thursday night when I came home from work.</li>
    <li> I was disappointed with the lack of quality of this Wahl shaver.  The trimmer opens properly but will not retract as it should.  On a positive note the rechargeable battery has great capacity between recharge cycles.</li>
    <li> This shaver has only one drawback.  It has no light to tell you when to re-charge it, so you either have to run it down or run the risk of cooking the battery.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;On the other hand, the shaver foil heads are one third the cost of Braun or Remington, and the shave is as good or better.  In the literature that comes with it, they warn you to shave for 3-4 times to condition your face, and this is true.  Also, you can get foil heads for three types of beard, which works well.   &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The purchase price is excellent compared to Braun or Remington, and the last one I had lasted 5 years.  I don&#x27;t know why this company doesn&#x27;t push these shavers more, as they are an excellent value for the money.</li>
    <li> The Wahl 7367-500 works great.  I use the meduim head attachment and I get a  very close and smooth shave just like my last Wahl which died after 4 years of use.  I don&#x27;t consider my last Wahl shaver lasting 4 years to be a problem given the price.  One thing though, the side burn trimmer is very loud and it can be quite disturbing to hear first thing in the morning.  I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll get use to it though.  For the price this is a Great shaver!</li>
    <li> Wahl still has a wonderful razor and I prefer it above others. It shave close and comes with 3 different screens to use at your preference of closeness. It&#x27;s convenient for us on the road as the size isn&#x27;t bulky and it doesn&#x27;t have any cumbersome attachments. This is my second Wahl replacing one I had for many years. Love it.</li>
    <li> I used it one time, placed it on the charger and it never worked again.  Now I face the added expense to pack and ship back for warranty repair. &lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Not happy with my internet purchase from your company.</li>
    <li> Its OK but it does put the beard on me once in awhile. But I only save every other day because of such sensitive skin on my neck. This does do the job very well and I do depend on it and like it.</li>
    <li> THE BEARD TRIMMER FUNCTION DOES NOT WORK. I WISH I COULD SEND IT BACK BUT I  THREW AWAY THE PACKAGING. HOW DID THIS LEMON GET OUT OF THE FACTORY?</li>
    <li> Best electric shaver I&#x27;ve ever used, period. I recommend it to anyone wanting a change from shaving with a razor.</li>
    <li> Only issue I had is that its a little bulky and this thing is really loud. I replaced my Panasonic-ES8109S. But I have to tell you I now get a clean smooth shave, without any redness or irritation on my neck. There are three heads that come with the unit: sensitive, close, and heavy stubble. I agree with other reviewers that Wahl is an overlooked player in the market. But you see plenty of Barbers using Wahl. If you compare the Panasonic one I had 3 head, wet/dry to this unit. I am trying to be funny and not rude, so here goes. The Wahl is like the street worker, not so pretty, but gets the job done fast! The Panasonic looked pretty, got it done, but not sure if the job was as good!!</li>
    <li> Because it is in all likelyhood not the best shaver on the market. It satisfies me, and I have recommended it to others.</li>
    <li> On off switch broke after a month.  Factory replaced quickly. Not sure yet how to rate.  Break quick &#x3D;1.  Replacement &#x3D;5. Overall. 3.</li>
    <li> A very good product. Just what was hoped for. It was a gift and a surprise so we&#x27;re all pleased.</li>
    <li> Gret item and works well.  I have owned several of these and in my opinion its the best electric shaver on the market.</li>
    <li> Many years ago, I had a Schick razor that I liked but it finally died, and realized they didn&#x27;t make that Schick anymore. So I tried a Remington, Norleco and a couple others, hated them all. PAUL HARVEY started advertising Wahl system and I decided to give it a shot. That was probably 25 years ago. My first Wahl lasted a few years and I bought another one, it also lasted a reasonable length of time. I decded to buy a Braun and to my disappointment, thru it away. About twelve years ago, Sears was discontinuing the Wahl shaver and had them on sale for thirty dollars, and I bought three of them. The last one is dying, so  I&#x27;ve only used the Wahl 4000 since and just now purchased another one, which is my sixth one. The reason I usually buy a new one is due to the battery starting to give out, and that&#x27;s probably because I put it on the charger after each use. They do NOT recommend that you do that, so I might try to change that habit and charge it every few days and I&#x27;ll see if this one will last more than about three or four years. So I&#x27;m glad they still make them and appreciate that they are still made in the good old US of A. So, that makes me a happy camper....so hang in there, Wahl Corp, you&#x27;ve got my vote, from a long time satisfied customer. Thank you, Paul Harvey!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, I throw the bonus personal trimmers in the trash, have no use for them.</li>
    <li> the shaver works great and lasts for 4 days of shaving, the main reason i bought it was that it is american made. does feel a little cheap-light and made of plastic. i like the heavy feel of my last remington, that wore out, better but could not bring myself to throw more money oversees. this one works very well and was also cheaper than alot of the other choices</li>
    <li> besides the fact that it was a smokin deal......&lt;br /&gt;I got a trimmer too&lt;br /&gt;it has 3 foils&lt;br /&gt;the replacement heads are MUCH cheaper than the competition and....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s made in the U.S.A.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;now you can&#x27;t beat that!!</li>
    <li> Great!!!!!!!!! I bought this shaver and it has beeen the best one.. No problems at all and works great. Must Buy this one</li>
    <li> Difficult to hold because of excessive vibration, nearly ear deafening and no matter which foil head is used, results are poor. The only redeeming quality in the purchase was the nose trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;If this is a made in America product, Wahl should not be proud of this product.</li>
    <li> I bought this specifically for my head.  I was looking for a &amp;#34;heavy duty&amp;#34; shaver that can get thru head hair.  This gets the job done.  Had it for 2 years so far with no issues.</li>
    <li> Good thing there is a variety of shavers.  My beard shaves best with this.  (For once the super expensive shavers don&#x27;t work so well on my beard.  The Wahl is great.</li>
    <li> Shaves better and cones with multiple shaving screens. Only drawback is long charge time for battery. But it is still better</li>
    <li> I have had Norelco&#x27;s all my life. the last one I bought failed to cut well after 8 months. tried this Wahl and was shocked at the close shave !!! I use a safety razor also and this almost matches the closeness. battery seems to go on for a long time. Wahl , u have a great product here !!!!</li>
    <li> This item didn&#x27;t work as well as I thought it would.  It didn&#x27;t provide a good shave.  I had to use my old flippers to finish shaving.</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s a torture to use this product, I would rather use a shaving cream and a shaving blade to finish the job faster.</li>
    <li> the shaver head is really hard to remove.i can hardly remove it yo clean as i am afraid it,s going to break. i only use the super close  head.i didn,t have this with my old one.it is the same as the new one.any help?&lt;br /&gt;thanks, F.D.CRAVER</li>
    <li> Although I don&#x27;t always shave with an electric shaver, I need one for those times when I&#x27;m in a hurry.  This one fits the bill.  It gives a quick, close shave.  I would recommend this razor for two maIn reasons.  One, it works very well.  Two, it is made in the USA.  The only reason I haven&#x27;t given it five stars is that I haven&#x27;t had it long enough to test its durability.</li>
    <li> Shaver works as described, has pop-up trimmer that works. Try all three of the shaving heads to see which one gives you the closest shave without skin discomfort.</li>
    <li> Very disapointed in the Quality.  Don&#x27;t shave as good--Don&#x27;t trim as good!  I wish I had not thrown my old Wahl Razer &amp; trimmer away--they did a better job then these new ones.</li>
    <li> Charged it like the directions said. Turned it on and used it for 5 minutes before it just shut off. Figured out that it would work if I jammed the button in but that&#x27;s not how it&#x27;s supposed to be and made it impossible to use. I don&#x27;t recommend this brand.</li>
    <li> So, I&#x27;m 22 and I&#x27;ve only ever used electric shavers which means I can&#x27;t compare it against a regular shave, but I&#x27;ll go ahead and write this review against the few other electric shavers I&#x27;ve used.  Of the last few razors I&#x27;ve used this one blows the other two out of the water; the first razor was a philips rechargeable with a cord, and the results weren&#x27;t great but it did well enough for my use, and the second one was a Remington cord only razor.  The philips razor was no longer usable when its battery died, having the cord connected to it was pointless when its battery died, and so after a year or two I ended up having to replace it.  It had very visible signs it was going to die before it did which included noticeably slower rpms and an even more noticeable poor job at shaving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Both the philips and the Remington were rotary shavers.  I bought a cord only Remington shaver when the philips ran out and I&#x27;d been using it for a few months prior to this Wahl razor.  It definitely worked better than the philips for the few weeks before it ran out but it never really impressed me.  Prior to getting this razor I had looked up the general differences between a rotary and foil electric razor.  Can&#x27;t remember the site but one of them outlined that a rotary razor is good for larger jobs with few and far between uses but not so great for daily shaves; then it went on to say that a foil razor is better for daily uses because they get closer shaves but require more maintenance cleaning.  I&#x27;m one of those blonds that can&#x27;t really grow large amounts of facial hair, the most I ever grow above my lip is a few small hairs and my neck and face hair is pretty crowded together but even after weeks of leaving it alone it would only produce hairs at max a quarter of an inch long which never really looked like a beard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was the foil razor I decided on because every foil razor &lt; $40 had poor ratings.  I got this as a Christmas present and, the first few times I used it, I could tell it was a little better shave than the old Remington but not as great as I&#x27;d hoped for.  I&#x27;ve been experimenting every day with the three different heads, using the trimmer before and after the shave, but the third thing I tried today works really well.  With the different heads I couldn&#x27;t tell a difference between the shaves at all but using the trimmer before and/or after shaving did make any left over individual hairs a good deal less noticeable while not being gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On my old rotary razors when I would try to go over my neck and face with different stroke patterns it never made a difference in the end result so it&#x27;s taken me a while to stumble onto this method.  I had been using this foil razor in only a downward or upward vertical stroke pattern and doing this several times over would not get rid of the stray hairs.  But when I finally decided to try running the head of the razor horizontally across my face and neck, every last hair disappeared.  My newly established ritual that works well for me is: to use the popup trimmer to trim all the hairs down first, then run the razor with the &#x27;close&#x27; head up and down my face and neck vertically once or maybe twice, and finally I run the razor across my neck and face horizontally once or maybe twice.  When I looked in the mirror the first time I&#x27;d finished this pattern I couldn&#x27;t tell I ever had hair on my face or neck to begin with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t used the personal trimmer yet but I&#x27;m sure I will eventually.  I&#x27;ve been meaning to get one because a couple of people have said before that I have some noticeable nose hairs sticking out.</li>
    <li> really great electric shave i am happy with the power and smothness. I am a baber and people say it felt better on the bald fads and face use</li>
    <li> I received Wahl  7367-500 custom shave. It&#x27;s looks cheep. I think it value is $10. $70 is too high. even though $50. Don&#x27;t buy it&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Painful shaving beard is caught in。</li>
    <li> I use this shaver every day works great real strong I will buy one for my brother. And will recommend this saver to all my friends</li>
    <li> I tried all three heads. the one that did not pull the hairs did not give a good shave and the other heads pulled too much. I&#x27;m not sending it back I&#x27;ll use it in conjunction with a razor.</li>
    <li> The Wahl shaver was a great deal. It gives you a close shave but keeps the skin soft. I would recommend this shaver to any man who needs a great shave at a fantastic price. It works better than the more expensive braun shaver that my son initially used. After reading the reviews from other customers who bought the Wahl shaver it was clear that he had a winner.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband, and he has really enjoyed it. It provides a smooth transition from shaving with a blade, and is easy on the face.  Fully charged, it lasts about a week, and is not bulky or inconvenient to leave out while charging.  His favorite feature is that he can choose how close it will shave. It&#x27;s also very easy to clean and easy to take on trips.</li>
    <li> Hi &lt;br /&gt;I bought this shaver based on customer reviews,,So much for trusting anonymous reviews.. First of all it&#x27;s cheaply made.....Motor is loud and slow compared to good shavers...had to glue charger together with super glue... one head on personal trimmer was broke.......poor quality shave even with the closest head it&#x27;s not close.....takes 15 hours of charging for a few minutes of shaving....If this truly is the last American made shaver it&#x27;s a sad commentary on what we are turning out......Try a Braun Free Control for a foil Shaver or a Norelco for rotory and forget this junk.....well the first shave wasn&#x27;t too bad and it&#x27;s all down hill from there.</li>
    <li> You would think that if anybody&#x27;s razor would have a good sideburn trimmer it would be Wahl, well, its not Wahl! &lt;br /&gt;The razor isn&#x27;t bad for the money, a little loud but holds a charge well.</li>
    <li> I also have an older model Wahl and really like this one.  Battery life is good and the shape is nicer to hold.  Nose hair trimmer also works well.</li>
    <li> The product was satisfactory . . . BUT there is something wrong, i.e. the shaver head is hard to release when pushing the button, and the protective plastic covering the head gets caught up on the trimmer blade when trying to remove the protective covering.</li>
    <li> Most durable and reliable razor I&#x27;ve ever used. Long lasting.  Wahl company stands behind their product, will even repair it and recondition it for small fee.</li>
    <li> The Wahl multihead shaver is a great buy. The multiple heads give me a choice each day. Since I have problem skin -- formerly eczema, rosacea, and seborrheic dermatitis ( explained at [...] ), now cured but still VERY sensitive -- I needed a shaver that doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin in some locations.     I read the instructions very carefully and adjusted my expectations as noted. This is my first foil shaver. I have used only a rotary type before. After three weeks of using the Sensitive head, as predicted, I could see no problems. I had got used to the shaver and it worked well.    The nose and ear hair trimmer has been very helpful too for those hard to get places.    The one problem is the volume of noise. I wouln&#x27;t dare use the shaver early in the morning, for fear of waking up my neighbors. (I live in a small apartment.) I am retired, so I can shave during the day and avoid the problem.    For men with serious skin problems, I would suggest what I am trying now: Use a hair trimmer, set to a very low setting, every few days instead of trying to use a shaver. That means a short stubble, rather than a close shave, but that is much better than tearing up skin that is already a problem.     I have used Wahl products before (specifically a hair trimmer that lasted for seven years), and I have always been pleased.</li>
    <li> This is the best shaver ever.  I have tried Remington, Braun, Panasonic, and find this is the one that gives the fastest and closest shave.  Add to the performance, the reasonable price, and you have an unbeatable combination.  I highly recommend this product.  Moreover, Amazon delivered my order to my front door without any delay and even sooner than I expected.  My total experience was perfect.</li>
    <li> I have tried them all. Latest was a Braun. It was the worst one of four brands I have had three Wahl&#x27;s and you can&#x27;t beat them. Amazon was the best price and was thrilled to find it there as I had been looking locally for a year.</li>
    <li> This is not my first Wahl Shaver and it won&#x27;t be my last. I shave everyday and these shavers run and run and run.  I get a close shave and my wife really does not want me using anything else.  I am not about to use a more expensive shaver when I get great results with the Wahl.  I highly recommend this cordless shaver.</li>
    <li> When I received this razor, I realized that I might overpaid for this product.  After charging for 24 hours, I attempted to shave with it, and my suspicions were confirmed.  I will admit that I skipped a day shaving, and that I have fairly coarse facial hair, but this razor stalled on contact.  After gently attempting to shave without overwhelming this razor&#x27;s feeble motor, the battery died halfway through the shave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I plugged it in to continue, and attempted to use the trimmer on the rear of the razor.  It seemed to cut okay, but when retracting the trimmer the small plastic pawls that guide it back into the body skipped the groove that they ride in on one side, and the whole mechanism nearly fell off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wahl makes good clippers, but this razor is a cheap, all plastic piece of junk.</li>
    <li> I had a Wahl shaver years ago but could not find a replacement.  This razor, although noisier than other I have owned is giving me a better shave than my previous two razors.</li>
    <li> Thanks and Godbless  Never forgot Jesus is the only way true and life, nothing impossivel for Jesus. I dont now you but Jesus now you and love you , his is the savior king</li>
    <li> I wanted to purchase an American made shaver. The previous electrics seemed to have a short shelf life.  So I purchased this Wahl Shaver.  Close shave definitely, However it sounds like a lawn mower and lots of vibrations to  it. I didn&#x27;t expect that. Time will tell how it works out.</li>
    <li> I have had this razor for a long time, it works great. I recommend it and will buy another one if this one ever breaks.</li>
    <li> i could not believe the poor quality of this shaver. I did not expect an American made product to be so crudely constructed and to work so poorly.  I f I did not know any better I would think it was made in East Germany 30 years ago. It is very noisy, the shave is painful and the retractable blade did not retract.  Shame on Wahl !</li>
    <li> no head cover. the head  stick when you try yo take it off.  this is not good  for any man that shave.</li>
    <li> I purchased this item based off of the reviews and the affordable price.  I have been using a gillette razor and the andis styliner 2 for shaving my face and head.  The razor tends to cause black heads and razor bumps and the styliner to me is more for touch up work than full shaves.  While this whal product can&#x27;t cut nearly as close as a razor, it did a good job.  It did leave serveral loose hair spots on my face so I touched it up with the edger that is attached to the shaver.  That combo worked well.  I had a very close shave.  I would reccomend this product for those of you whose skin does not respond well to a true razor shave.  I follow up my shaves with the bump patrol facial application and I don&#x27;t get any bumps. I also reccomend in addtion to the bump patrol you have the skin tone application by high time, to help lighten up any shaving blemishes you occur.</li>
    <li> Works great and gives a nice shave for a electric razor.  Like having the charger.  Wahl is the best kept secret as far as electric razors go.  I highly recommend the Wahl Razor.</li>
    <li> Good for use at home.  Not as good for travel.&lt;br /&gt;It gives a good, close shave but it&#x27;s very noisy and the battery needs recharging after only three shaves.</li>
    <li> I did not like this razor. Very loud and hurt my face. It has been in the drawer for months.</li>
    <li> This electric shaver is excellent. It has three settings to attach to make it a more comfortable transition from blade shaver. My girlfriend loves how smooth my face is now !!!</li>
    <li> Quality shows...unfortunately. I heard this thing was durable and reliable - it&#x27;s not. The back piece for trimming was broken/backwards out of the box, and eventually snapped off. The head works fine, but it&#x27;s difficult to use and takes more time than regular shavers. The bonus personal trimmer has a short life span as it eventually can&#x27;t spin up fast enough to cut anything. Next time I&#x27;ll spend more money on a proven quality shaver.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned 3 of the Wahl Custom Shavers specifically this model. It is an amazing shaver i have very thick facial hair which many other shavers cannot hold up against or get jammed which can be quite painful to have to pull it off my face with hair stuck in it. With the close head alone i get a perfect shave and i have to say closer than any razor I&#x27;ve every use. Great technique to get close is use your other hand to stretch the skin to get in closer, don&#x27;t over do it because you can break out from the heat and abuse on the skin but it works wonders.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With that being said the shaver probably has about a 1.5 year life span and this is with regular cleaning with a brush and the Oil/Cleaner/disinfectant spray. Also the battery life dies rather quickly on the rechargeable battery I think for the 2 previous shavers it was about a month or two then they stopped charging and only function if left plugged in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used this new one about three times and the charge lasted me two shaves but this is right out the box with out charging. Wahl has changed the AC adapter to a lighter and smaller one which is nice but the power plug does not sit securely in the shaver. I find that it kept falling out after about 20-30 seconds of shaving due to the vibrations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m hoping this 3rd one lasts longer due to picking up a separate trimmer to cut down long hairs rather than using the one built in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hope this review has helped some of you even though I do have some negative feedback about this product but it has been the best one yet and provides a very close shave and for that I gave it 5 stars.</li>
    <li> The price of this item almost doubled since the last time I ordered it.  I cannot see any reason for such an increase.  I will look elsewhere in the future.</li>
    <li> I have owned other razors but Wahl is still my favorite! It includes 3 foils which makes it a great deal!</li>
    <li> Been using these for over 13 years and just got my third one as the battery gave out and the power cord became damaged. Ive tried norelco, braun, and remington as i get them as gifts - nothing comes close at double the cost of my wahl. American made - just hope they can stay in business.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one issue i have noticed is they have been loud. But the one i just got seemed to have a different cutting blade and is very quiet compared to previous versions - looks like they might have tuned the blade to minimize harmonics.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;S as i go into the store and see shaver prices approaching $200 - i just have to &amp;#34;really?&amp;#34; Thanks wahl for keeping the sanity and providing a great product at a great price.</li>
    <li> this razor is not good at all does not shave close big and hard to handle will br returning as this not good</li>
    <li> The shaver was for my 74 year old dad. He will only use this shaver and it meet all his expectations. I would recommend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> My husband says the Wahl gives him a better shave and it is made in the USA.</li>
    <li> The 3 shields are wonderful, i.e. to have a choice. The &amp;#34;closest shave&amp;#34; shield is so efficient, so close in its shave, that my husband, w/dementia, can&#x27;t tolerate it:  amazing shave, though. The other shields offer alternatives and work so fine.</li>
    <li> I received the ordered Wahl Shave System, but the Foil Guard\\&quot; was not included in the shipment.  I would like Amazon.com and/or Wahl Clipper Corporation to send me a \\&quot;foil Guard\\&quot; that is missing from the shipment.  I do not have anything to cover the Foil Head of my shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Secondly, this product is way too loud when it is turned on for operation.  I am thinking of returning this product for REFUND.  The product does not live up to the way its performance is described.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*****THE WORST EVER SHAVER*****&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This shaver is not properly researched in the testing laboratory,not tested properly and for sure is not designed to shave men&#x27;s beard successfully.  It pulls my facial hair too much and BURNS afterward; even though I do not have sensitive skin.  I consider this a very BAD INVESTMENT &amp; Big Disappointment.  I will not recommend it to my worst enemy; this is how I feel after patiently trying this product more that 10 times to convince myself.  It just does not work for me and for my skin.  Secondly, there were missing parts that was not included in the product.</li>
    <li> Wahl has great products...does a good job and not as noisy as the old Wahl I had...charge lasts at least a week maybe longer.</li>
    <li> this is my second wahl shaver and I rate it#1 I would without hesitation endorse this unit without reservation-surpried that very few stores carry this shaver</li>
    <li> The razor shaves good and is easy to handle. It is a very good replacement for my older Wahl razor (5 years old ?). New razor also uses the same cutter heads and foils that already had for the old razor.</li>
    <li> It was exactly what I wanted and ordered.  Since the product is no longer sold in retail stores, I am glad that it is still available.</li>
    <li> The trimmer is very hard to engage and the cover over  cutters is hard to release.  any hints?&lt;br /&gt;otherwise it&#x27;s ok</li>
    <li> Ok so reviews are great but I have sent 2 of these back within a couple days of using. The on/off switch would barely work and the nose trimmer didn&#x27;t work and the pop up trimmer had to be forced up.&lt;br /&gt;Now the third one seems like the on off is going to give me problems. If so this goes back and that&#x27;s the end of Wahl.&lt;br /&gt;It does give a good shave so why can&#x27;t they fix these issues??</li>
    <li> All I can say is that my husband likes it, uses it daily and seems to have no problems with it.</li>
    <li> The shaver works well and I usually buy this brand.  The shaver itself doesn&#x27;t last a full 2 yrs and you have to replace the foils but overall its good quality.</li>
    <li> Shaver works fine.  I was surprised that it had 3 heads instead of some kind of adjustment.  I cannot get as close shave as I did with my shaver that rotated.  It is very loud but all in all it get the job done.</li>
    <li> Great item to shave my head. Been using it for about 2 years. the first 4-5 months I bought it, the battery didn&#x27;t seem to retain the charge. Contacted Wahl, they sent me a call tag. They got it fixed and even swapped the blade/foil for free.</li>
    <li> We purchased this for our future son-n-law for Christmas. He gets a nice and smooth shave with it.  He loves it and it was well worth every dime.</li>
    <li> Shorts out. Charging component registers but wont turn on</li>
    <li> This is my third Wahl shaver over many years. They last a long time and shave great. You get a nice close shave.</li>
    <li> very easy to use and very fast. I have used thjs model many years. Thjs razoris durable and very easy to clean.</li>
    <li> I purchased this shaver on July 7.  I have used it daily, and it gives a very good shave.  However, if you note in the third paragraph of my original review, I commented on how it felt cheap and that the cord wouldn&#x27;t stay plugged in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This morning, I tried to tighten the pins on the shaver.  I have been a computer tech and electronics repair tech for over 15 years, fixing computers, iPhones, iPods, etc. - needless to say I am cautious and very careful in my work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using a pair of tweezers, I tried to move one of the metal prongs.  It fell out of the shaver, rendering the entire unit useless.  In looking further, the plug itself was very cheaply made and the metal holding the prong was very thin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would not recommend this shaver to anyone at this point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(My original review - I gave it 4 stars originally)&lt;br /&gt;I have been using Braun or Remington shavers for years, and I stumbled onto info about the Wahl shavers and was intrigued.  I ordered this one, and when it arrived, I was impressed by the fact that it came with three different foils, graded for how close of a shave you prefer.  I tried the medium foil to start, but switched to the thinnest one \\&quot;very close\\&quot; the second day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It takes some getting used to.  All of my previous shavers have foils that are flat, while this one has one foil lower than the other.  After a week of use, it gets high marks for overall closeness of shave and ease of cleaning.  It&#x27;s also very powerful, and you&#x27;ll notice that it really vibrates your hand as you use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#x27;s what cost it the fifth star:  it just feels cheap.  Every time I use the trimmer head, it feels very plastic-y and I&#x27;m worried it will break off.  When I ran the battery down and switched to the power adapter, the fit on the plug for the power adapter was very poor.  It would not stay plugged in, and I finally had to change my hand grip on the shaver to hold the power cord plug in the shaver.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Inshort, I&#x27;m happy with the shaver.  Time will tell how durable it is.  I usually get four to six years out of a shaver, and I average 3 months out of a set of Remington foils.</li>
