      <li>Enjoy!</li>
      <li>If you have more questions - I&#x27;m an esthetician, feel free to ask me!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used this product for too many years to count.</li>
      <li>You will be more prone to burn.</li>
      <li>Also if you use just a wee bit more than you should it tends to be sticky and my foundations doesn&#x27;t settle as well.</li>
      <li>I have been using on and off for 8 years and every time I start using again fall in love with it all over again</li>
      <li>The puffiness is mostly from allergies.</li>
      <li>I love bioelements products.</li>
      <li>so much more.  </li>
      <li>Much better value d ones</li>
      <li>I love this stuff.  </li>
      <li>One word of caution with this one - make sure you use sunscreen as it makes your face susceptible to burning when in the sun after use.</li>
      <li>Company justified it be saying it was more &amp;#</li>
      <li>Great for my sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>but this is a very gentle and effective product.</li>
      <li>but I find this product works fine for my skin without additional moisturizer.</li>
      <li>Clean and easy application.</li>
      <li>But I&#x27;ve found that if you apply it while the face is still moist (i.e., after my power peptide) it goes on smoothly</li>
      <li>how smooth and youthful looking my skin is.  </li>
      <li>I am fair skinned and  have a clear complexion</li>
      <li>I have an almost full bottle that I am just going to have to trash now.</li>
      <li>What makes this such a good refiner is that it is alpha and beta - one</li>
      <li>I use Bioelements Quick Refiner after my morning face wash after my toner and Bioelements Power Peptide.  </li>
      <li>In desperation, I decided to try this Quick Refiner which is an AHA</li>
      <li>My esthetician only uses this line and they&#x27;re amazing...</li>
      <li>A key thing I love is that I&#x27;ve always had breakouts after waxing my facial hair, now after waxing I do a good wash and apply this, and no breakouts.  </li>
      <li>Worth the money</li>
      <li>This is the ONLY one that has worked effectively.</li>
      <li>Well worth the price.</li>
      <li>You can see it working right away.</li>
      <li>I first tried it in the travel package for oily skin.  </li>
      <li>I have found that this product does exactly what it says.</li>
      <li>I have combination skin with most of my imperfections being tiny whitheads all over my chin and cheeks.</li>
      <li>Makes my skin super soft</li>
      <li>and it really did make my skin glow</li>
      <li>I have very oily skin and this product over-dried it, making it oilier and caused me to break out.  </li>
      <li>so I invested in a whole bottle.</li>
      <li>and I follow up with my Bioelements absolute moisturizer and the stickiness is not a problem.  </li>
      <li>Highly recommended!</li>
      <li>My skin is so much smoother after using</li>
      <li>Much cheaper on Amazon than in my estheticians&#x27;s spa.</li>
      <li>This product really improves my skin.</li>
      <li>I have been using Bioelements products for several years but this is the first time I have tried the Quick Refiner.  </li>
      <li>in a move very unlike me, I ordered without reading the reviews and I am not surprised to come back to write my own review and find just about</li>
      <li>Does not provide enough true exfoliation.</li>
      <li>I have oily skin and as I have gotten older it</li>
      <li>Formula is much too drying, most likely due to high alcohol content.  </li>
      <li>While I never had any acne issues growing up, as I&#x27;ve gotten older, adult onset (blockheads &amp; whiteheads w/monthly pimple breakouts) issues have plagued me for years.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had pore problems all my life and this is the first product that is actually helping improve the appearance of my skin.  </li>
      <li>I use this product twice daily, it has improved my skin so much!</li>
      <li>The pores in my face have lessened considerably and blackheads and clogged pores on my nose have disappeared.</li>
      <li>I use this nearly every morning and the 3 oz bottle lasted over a year.  </li>
      <li>but my esthetician said that I may have purchased old stock...</li>
      <li>do!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have sensitive skin and have had problems wth</li>
      <li>I have very oily skin and get deep pimples around my jawline from stress.  </li>
      <li>This product keeps my skin clear, soft and even toned.  </li>
      <li>I bought this hoping it would help my flaky over 50 skin, but I developed a case of eczema after I tried it once.</li>
      <li>Wow, a product that actually works!!!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s only 3 oz</li>

<li> works from the inside out and the other from the outside in - covering all aspects of skin refining.</li>
<li> and you have little milia this is about the only product that I have found that will exfoliate the skin chemically to help get rid of milia and keep it from coming back.</li>

<li> I&#x27;ve been using this for two months and NOTHING has changed, not even slightly.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> received it on time and this is great stuff. I use it before bedtime</li>
    <li> I love bioelements products. I was introduced to them a few years ago and use nothing but them. One word of caution with this one - make sure you use sunscreen as it makes your face susceptible to burning when in the sun after use.</li>
    <li> My skin looks youthful and radiant! Amazing product! I have been using on and off for 8 years and every time I start using again fall in love with it all over again</li>
    <li> Amazing stuff! My skin is so much smoother after using</li>
    <li> Been using this product for years, I love it!</li>
    <li> Expensive but worth it</li>
    <li> Excellent service and this product is awesome!!</li>
    <li> been using this for years-love it but do not use by eyes-</li>
    <li> This product is excellent!  I have used it for 2 years under my moisturizer 3-4 times a week and it makes an incredible difference.  Worth the money and it lasts 2-3 months if used as suggested.</li>
    <li> Wow, a product that actually works!!!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s only 3 oz but it has a metered pump so it&#x27;s lasting long enough - I&#x27;d guess 3 months.&lt;br /&gt;I am totally happy with the results. My skin has cleared up and it&#x27;s not too harsh. I use it twice daily.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> Jury is still out on this. I have been using it for apx 4 months and don&#x27;t see any difference in my skin. I am fair skinned and  have a clear complexion therefore maybe this is way I&#x27;m not seeing a difference. Not sure I would order again. Also if you use just a wee bit more than you should it tends to be sticky and my foundations doesn&#x27;t settle as well. So now I am only using it at night.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff.  My aesthetician used these products and this is the best exfoliator I have used!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t use it but my wife swears by it! You know what they say, &amp;#34;Happy wife-happy life!&amp;#34; Buy it!</li>
    <li> Clean and easy application. I use this product twice daily, it has improved my skin so much! I have less breakouts, and doesn&#x27;t dry my skin out like other products.</li>
    <li> I ordered this on Subscribe and Save and I am so impressed! in a move very unlike me, I ordered without reading the reviews and I am not surprised to come back to write my own review and find just about everyone else feels just like I do!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have sensitive skin and have had problems wth AHA in the past but this is a very gentle and effective product. it has totally turned my skin around. I have combination skin with most of my imperfections being tiny whitheads all over my chin and cheeks. this has minimized the appearance of my pores, evened my skin tone, and given me a glow that I can&#x27;t stop raving about. I&#x27;m telling all my friends about this product. Highly recommended! Much cheaper on Amazon than in my estheticians&#x27;s spa.</li>
    <li> Great addition to your skin care. Great for my sensitive skin. Follow directions and be careful going in sun while using product. You will be more prone to burn.</li>
    <li> This product is a skin game changer. I do not splurge often on my skin but this makes a huge difference! You can see it working right away.</li>
    <li> Great product line. Makes my skin super soft</li>
    <li> I have been using Bioelements products for several years but this is the first time I have tried the Quick Refiner.  I am so pleased with it!  It made a noticeable difference in just one day.  I&#x27;ve had pore problems all my life and this is the first product that is actually helping improve the appearance of my skin.  I am a happy customer!!!  Would recommend this to anyone with similar skin problems and I will continue to use this.  You just can&#x27;t go wrong with this line of products!</li>
    <li> I use Bioelements Quick Refiner after my morning face wash after my toner and Bioelements Power Peptide.  While I never had any acne issues growing up, as I&#x27;ve gotten older, adult onset (blockheads &amp; whiteheads w/monthly pimple breakouts) issues have plagued me for years.  I decided to try this gel exfoliator and it works like nothing I&#x27;ve tried before.  Whiteheads are a thing of the past, blockheads were slowly eliminated as this stuff worked over several months, no more minor pimples (unless I don&#x27;t use regularly).  A key thing I love is that I&#x27;ve always had breakouts after waxing my facial hair, now after waxing I do a good wash and apply this, and no breakouts.  Now this stuff does have a sticky feel after applying.  But I&#x27;ve found that if you apply it while the face is still moist (i.e., after my power peptide) it goes on smoothly and I follow up with my Bioelements absolute moisturizer and the stickiness is not a problem.  A note - I use this nearly every morning and the 3 oz bottle lasted over a year.  Well worth the price.</li>
    <li> Use this in the morning and it takes away puffiness under the eyes. The puffiness is mostly from allergies.</li>
    <li> I have found that this product does exactly what it says. I will be ordering my second bottle as soon as this one is finished. The pores in my face have lessened considerably and blackheads and clogged pores on my nose have disappeared. I am thrilled to be able to recommend this product heartily. For those who find that this is drying, add a moisturizer and only use it at night. I have oily skin and as I have gotten older it I less oily, but I find this product works fine for my skin without additional moisturizer. I used to use  2% BHA products and even one at 9 percent (!) but found no improvement in the pores of my skin. In desperation, I decided to try this Quick Refiner which is an AHA and it is all that I could have hoped for. If you try it I hope you will be pleased with your results!</li>
    <li> I have very oily skin and get deep pimples around my jawline from stress.  This product keeps my skin clear, soft and even toned.  I first tried it in the travel package for oily skin.  I am hooked on the results.</li>
    <li> Great price, easy to apply, skin softer</li>
    <li> This even removes facial congestion. Love this product!!! For best use at night and wash off in the morning and you MUST WEAR SPF!!!! No exceptions.. You will have an absolutely flawless finish on ur face everytime!!!</li>
    <li> Fighting adult acne is awful. I&#x27;ve tried every product under the sun... Obagi, proactiv, retin-a, etc. This is the ONLY one that has worked effectively.</li>
    <li> Makes my skin glow. I get lots of compliment on how smooth and youthful looking my skin is.  I love bioelement products!</li>
    <li> I love it, was buying a very, very expensive refining gel from a fancy spa from California.....after 15 years I was so dissatisfied it turned to a watery mix in a tiny pump bottle that did not live up to my expectations.  Company justified it be saying it was more &amp;#34;organic.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;It was just watered down, smaller bottle, and way more expensive.  My esthetician recommended this product by Bio Elements and I love it so much more.  Much better value d ones so much more.  I use it everyday, though I don&#x27;t think you would need to.  Make  sure you use sun screen in the bright sun.</li>
    <li> this is great stuff!!!  i have oticed wrinkles disappear!</li>
    <li> Product helps turn dead skin over. It makes my skin look younger and healthier. I recommend using it with Hydroplenish.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for two months and NOTHING has changed, not even slightly. I didn&#x27;t get any tingling or any indication that this product was doing anything but I kept with it and still nothing. If I paid to have a one time facial with this stuff I would be furious! There is no date anywhere on the bottle so I can&#x27;t tell if it&#x27;s just expired or what.. I logged in tonight to find that I can&#x27;t return it. I have an almost full bottle that I am just going to have to trash now. ONE UNHAPPY CUSTOMER!</li>
    <li> What makes this such a good refiner is that it is alpha and beta - one works from the inside out and the other from the outside in - covering all aspects of skin refining. I&#x27;ve used this product for too many years to count. If you have dry skin and you have little milia this is about the only product that I have found that will exfoliate the skin chemically to help get rid of milia and keep it from coming back. Use it once a day only at night. One pump all over face, neck and upper chest should do it. Also the size is enough to last me a year. If you have more questions - I&#x27;m an esthetician, feel free to ask me! Enjoy!</li>
    <li> I bought this hoping it would help my flaky over 50 skin, but I developed a case of eczema after I tried it once. I don&#x27;t believe the two are related and once my face clears I will try it again. It does seem to be a nice product not to strong.</li>
    <li> I am a big fan of this line. This product really improves my skin. My face looks great! I am very happy with this buy</li>
    <li> Does not provide enough true exfoliation. Formula is much too drying, most likely due to high alcohol content.  I have very oily skin and this product over-dried it, making it oilier and caused me to break out.  I prefer straight glycolic acid products that are made to be put on the skin for a few minutes and then washed off.  This product is made to be &amp;#34;left on&amp;#34; and I think that adds to the drying problem.  Like the Bioelements line, but cannot recommend this one.</li>
    <li> My esthetician only uses this line and they&#x27;re amazing...when I&#x27;m at the spa. She gave me a sample of this and I used it for 2 weeks and it really did make my skin glow so I invested in a whole bottle. It&#x27;s been a month and I feel like it stopped working...I don&#x27;t know what happened but my esthetician said that I may have purchased old stock...I honestly don&#x27;t know what to think...</li>
    <li> Not as good as the quick refiner for eyes but still good</li>
</ol>
