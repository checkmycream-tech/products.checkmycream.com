      <li>Perfect transaction.  </li>
      <li>I.m still not used to it after a week, but it&#x27;s performance is excellent and I&#x27;ll stick with it.</li>
      <li>WONDERFUL  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been a soap and blade shaver until this Christmas, and shavers have greatly improved with this Noreco 735 model.</li>
      <li>Great deal.  </li>
      <li>great price.</li>
      <li>And this Razor does a great job for an electric</li>
      <li>Performs better than I thought it would, very good razor.</li>
      <li>All that to say, I&#x27;ll use this on the weekends but if I want a good shave I&#x27;ll have to stick to \\&quot;scraping my face\\&quot; with a blade.</li>
      <li>Very pleased.</li>
      <li>I am very pleased with my purchase.</li>
      <li>nice Feature Comes with a charging stand and if you forget to charge it plug it in and use it like a corded razor.</li>
      <li>gives a good and smooth</li>
      <li>Perfect replacement for my old unit.</li>
      <li>/&gt;this one is by far the best.</li>
      <li>Very pleased - nice smooth shave</li>
      <li>At first glance it seems great.</li>
      <li>I had a Norelco 6863XL for many, many years, replacing the heads about once a year.  </li>
      <li>I love them.</li>
      <li>I read many reviews before deciding to purchase this razor.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had the PT735 for a week and love the shave.  </li>
      <li>This a great improvement, cuts better and is much quieter.</li>
      <li>More comfortable, quicker shave, nice and close without ever nicking the skin.  </li>
      <li>The build is good, fits in the hand nicely, doesn&#x27;t slip, and doesn&#x27;t weigh too much.</li>
      <li>Nice item, quick shipping.</li>
      <li>easy to use.</li>
      <li>It cuts cleanly and quickly, and fits nicely into my hand.</li>
      <li>This shaver does everything right: close shave, smooth feel, easy handling, good trimmer, emergency quick charge, both cord and cordless operation.</li>
      <li>Still, a close, easy, comfortable shave.</li>
      <li>The Norelco makes shaving so much easier, and more economical.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I found this at kohls.com for $49.99 less a 20% off coupon with free shipping before a $5 mail in rebate so even with tax, at $37.40, it was a great deal in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The best electric razor that I have ever used .One tip,after you have finished shaving, wet the end and re-shave and you will be surprised</li>
      <li>About the only thing that I see as greatly improved is the battery as I can easily get a dozen or more shaves out of a single charge.</li>
      <li>The new one glide close, feel great next to his face.</li>
      <li>Definitely worth every penny</li>
      <li>It just glides and cuts so much better than the old one.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had a few electric razors in my day, and this is by far the best one I&#x27;ve owned.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been shaving with a multi-blade Gillette other popular straight edge for many years and thought I&#x27;d try an electric razor again</li>
      <li>only gripe with this model is the placement of the on/off switch - right where my thumb puts most of the pressure while using it.</li>
      <li>My first electric razor was a foil style razor in pre 1870</li>
      <li>Hubby really likes  it &amp; loves that he can rinse it off in sink!</li>
      <li>They are still \\&quot;okay\\&quot; but the closeness of shave is just about the same as it used to be many years ago.</li>
      <li>It feels even better than the last one.  </li>
      <li>But the shave is closer and way more efficient, with no shaver burn (which I tended to get with new cutters on the old shaver).  </li>
      <li>Nice stand and cord that plugs either into the stand or directly into the razor for when the rechargeable battery gives out (after about 5-10 years if it is like my last one).  </li>
      <li>Thanks Norelco.</li>
      <li>Thanks for Amazon refunding the purchase.</li>
      <li>I really like the ease of cleaning this shaver.</li>
      <li>Report back was this Norelco was better than his old one.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not sure if the person liked it.  </li>
      <li>Results are much better than previously used electric razors.  </li>
      <li>As another reviewer mentioned, the motor seems to run slower than on the older shavers.  </li>
      <li>But this new Norelco PT735 is # 1</li>
      <li>I wonder about useful life of the item, given the non-replaceable battery and limited life of Li-ION batteries.</li>
      <li>This shaver has a single light which, according to the directions, will warn me when it&#x27;s getting low, but I have no clue when that will be.  </li>
      <li>I have sensitive skin and razors used to wreak havoc on my face.</li>
      <li>His old Philip Norelco had for years fell apart from wear.</li>
      <li>Good deal for the Money can&#x27;t go wrong with this product</li>
      <li>Not as long lasting as a razor shave but quick and does the job for a day.</li>
      <li>most recent Norelco/Philips shavers, they may not be as durable as those of the past due to the lightweight and perhaps flimsier materials, but as long as one handles it without reckless abandon, It should last many years.</li>
      <li>,about two times a week run the entire razor head exposed  under cool water and your blades will last you a long time.</li>
      <li>The blades on this barely get through a beard.</li>
      <li>The only thing I don&#x27;t like as well (which led to the 4-star rating rather than 5) is that the old shaver had a series of lights which indicated the level of charge after each shave.  </li>

    <li> Perfect replacement for my old unit. Can&#x27;t understand the negative reviews.</li>
    <li> I brought this for my son. His old Philip Norelco had for years fell apart from wear. He said. The new one glide close, feel great next to his face. Thank you</li>
    <li> Nice item, quick shipping. AAAAA</li>
    <li> I bought this as a replacement for my last Philips electric razor that worked faithfully for 21 years without ever even needing to replace the blades!  It feels even better than the last one.  More comfortable, quicker shave, nice and close without ever nicking the skin.  Nice stand and cord that plugs either into the stand or directly into the razor for when the rechargeable battery gives out (after about 5-10 years if it is like my last one).  I hope to buy another one in another 21 years time!</li>
    <li> It was a gift.  My brother said he loves it.</li>
    <li> don&#x27;t waste your $. This thing leaves all kinds of hair after shaving the same area over and over.  Thanks for Amazon refunding the purchase.</li>

    <li> performs as advertised</li>
    <li> This is the best razor that I have ever used. It cuts cleanly and quickly, and fits nicely into my hand. I can use it either as a cordless or with the cord. I am very pleased with my purchase. I have used Norelco razors for a number of years, but&lt;br /&gt;this one is by far the best.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure if the person liked it.  I will find out. It was not cheap.  It arrived on time...I would recommend this item.</li>
    <li> I read many reviews before deciding to purchase this razor. At first glance it seems great. The build is good, fits in the hand nicely, doesn&#x27;t slip, and doesn&#x27;t weigh too much.

    <li> Can&#x27;t beat the closeness,comfort,ease of cleaning, &amp; price for this razor.Make someones Xmas &amp; buy one today!</li>
    <li> My first electric razor was a foil style razor in pre 1870 and I dis not care for it. I&#x27;ve been a soap and blade shaver until this Christmas, and shavers have greatly improved with this Noreco 735 model. I.m still not used to it after a week, but it&#x27;s performance is excellent and I&#x27;ll stick with it. It&#x27;s shave heads follow the face contour and give a shave that is close to a razor blade shave. I really like the ease of cleaning this shaver. Would buy it again.</li>
    <li> Great deal.  Perfect transaction.  Very pleased.</li>
    <li> I found this at kohls.com for $49.99 less a 20% off coupon with free shipping before a $5 mail in rebate so even with tax, at $37.40, it was a great deal in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used it a month and find it cuts close, is lightweight, quiet and the charge lasts at least a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like most recent Norelco/Philips shavers, they may not be as durable as those of the past due to the lightweight and perhaps flimsier materials, but as long as one handles it without reckless abandon, It should last many years.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t go wrong with a Norelco Razor, especially at this price. I&#x27;ve had a few electric razors in my day, and this is by far the best one I&#x27;ve owned. It gives a close shave and hasn&#x27;t given me any razor bumps which I usually get with electric razors. Definitely worth every penny</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Norelco razors for over 20 years now. I love them. I have sensitive skin and razors used to wreak havoc on my face. The Norelco makes shaving so much easier, and more economical.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only gripe with this model is the placement of the on/off switch - right where my thumb puts most of the pressure while using it. Even after a year of using it I still manage to turn it off a couple of times, every time I use it.</li>
    <li> Performs better than I thought it would, very good razor.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been shaving with a multi-blade Gillette other popular straight edge for many years and thought I&#x27;d try an electric razor again so I bought this one hoping they had improved over the years. Unfortunatley they haven&#x27;t. They are still \\&quot;okay\\&quot; but the closeness of shave is just about the same as it used to be many years ago. About the only thing that I see as greatly improved is the battery as I can easily get a dozen or more shaves out of a single charge.

    <li> This shaver does everything right: close shave, smooth feel, easy handling, good trimmer, emergency quick charge, both cord and cordless operation.</li>
    <li> Only had 2 days, checki back in a month</li>
    <li> I had a Norelco 6863XL for many, many years, replacing the heads about once a year.  I&#x27;ve had the PT735 for a week and love the shave.  As another reviewer mentioned, the motor seems to run slower than on the older shavers.
