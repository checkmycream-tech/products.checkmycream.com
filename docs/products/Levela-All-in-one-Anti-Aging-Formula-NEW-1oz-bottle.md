      <li>I&#x27;m thrilled with this product when used in conjunction with the BeauteMD.  </li>

      <li>Ok -- here goes.</li>

      <li>This product did keep my skin from getting more wrinkles.&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
      <li>and maybe she&#x27;ll have better luck.</li>
      <li>I used it for 7 days to make sure my skin wasn&#x27;t  just &amp;#34;adjusting&amp;#34; to it.</li>
      <li>and I love it.  </li>
      <li>My face feels smooth and the frown lines are almost gone!  </li>

      <li>Maybe it will work better for you.  </li>
      <li>I have ordered it more than once.</li>
      <li>I ordered my first bottle and loved the way it made my face feel.  </li>
      <li>It goes on easy and you can feel your pores tightening</li>
      <li>but the smell is too strong.</li>
      <li>Fine lines and wrinkles seem to vanish within days of using this product.</li>
      <li>The make up women put on their face covers up the fine lines and wrinkles not this product at all.</li>
      <li>After using this product for one week saw no decrease in wrinkles or fine lines on face at all.</li>
      <li>I have pretty excellent skin for being on the brink of 40 especially since I grew up on the beaches in South Africa.</li>
      <li>Much to my horror, when I looked in the mirror I saw more fine creases and wrinkles than I have ever had (even after a weekend of dehydration and partying!)</li>
      <li>It did a great job filling in my &amp;#34;laugh lines&amp;#34; in just a short period of time.  </li>
      <li>so it didn&#x27;t fit.  </li>
      <li>I would gladly pay the higher price to get the product I received before.  </li>
      <li>Nothing special .</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m getting a full refund.  </li>
      <li>Levela is a good product, but I am just starting to see some results.  </li>
      <li>Not one strand of hair is in a different place 14 days later -- supposedly when they took another picture showing the GREAT results!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m 50 and have had mild acne since I was 11.  </li>
      <li>Love this product - The moisturizer really work, you can feel it right away.  </li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t really have wrinkles to speak of, but I am always interested in making my skin look smoother, more even-toned and feel softer.</li>
      <li>The result are well worth the cost.</li>
      <li>worth the money.</li>
      <li>smile)</li>
      <li>just discovered after I wrote the first post that another $89.95 was charged to my checking account.</li>
      <li>I received at higher price on product website.  </li>
      <li>how much the cost will be!  </li>
      <li>I actually had many patients turned away from when I do their vitals.  </li>
      <li>First time user of Levela.  </li>
      <li>Get smart people.  </li>
      <li>worked very well.</li>
      <li>thanks</li>
      <li>and I really like the result it gave me</li>
      <li>THIS REALLY</li>
      <li>They never billed me, never let me know how much the product cost until I called them.</li>
      <li>I have used Levela for almost a year,and it really works will for me.  </li>
      <li>He agreed no change in wrinkles and that the smell was really bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>This is not an ethical company and I would advise anyone considering purchasing their product, to be careful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Do you really want to throw your money away?</li>
      <li>I appreciated all their help.  </li>
      <li>I rated this ok due to lightness of the product, I like the feel on my skin.</li>
      <li>No major changes yet, but the combo is still light and does not feel like it&#x27;s caked up.</li>
      <li>I am 53 and spent the first 35 years of my life on the beach and the wrinkles on my face and hands really showed it, but you&#x27;d never it know now!!!  </li>
      <li>Then a week or so in, I realized it actually had a pump on it, which I couldn&#x27;t get the product to dispense, so ended up taking the whole top back off and using it that way.</li>
      <li>It seemed to work ok but a little to pricy for me.</li>
      <li>I received the first shipment in October but DIDN&#x27;T OPEN IT, waiting for a bill letting me know how much it cost.</li>
      <li>I gave it to a friend since it was practically new</li>
      <li>Super dry in the morning...</li>
      <li>Very soft skin after using it for a month or so.</li>
      <li>I stopped using for a while and my face didn&#x27;t feel or look the same - back to using it regularly and love it.</li>
      <li>I discovered later that since the first order was over 30 days, the $89.95 could not be refunded.</li>
      <li>Waiting a few more weeks to see a major difference.</li>
      <li>I AM 77YRS OLD AND DO NOT HAVE A WRINKLE ON MY FACE.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Not only was my skin smooth and younger looking, my complexion was noticeably different!  </li>
      <li>This did nothing as far as I could see.</li>
      <li>So far my skin likes it</li>
      <li>After it is soaked in, I then apply the Beaute MD over my entire face and neck, and it doesn&#x27;t take th a t much of it either.</li>
      <li>TRANSPARENT PRETTY PINK LIKE A CHINA DOLL.&lt;br</li>
      <li>My family members, who live in a different state and I don&#x27;t get to see that often, noticed immediately!  </li>
      <li>This bottle has a false bottom near the top.  </li>
      <li>If you don&#x27;t get the same results, I would be very surprised.  </li>
      <li>This product is way too expensive to not be able to benefit from!</li>
      <li>And I haven&#x27;t even mentioned the crows feet and heavy eyelids and laugh</li>
      <li>I used a moderate amount, but it was empty very soon.</li>
      <li>I will see how long this lasts as far as the amount of product, to see if I purchase it again.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Nothing special . Expensive.</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS PRODUCT LEVELA. ALL MY FRIENDS AND 2 SISTERS WONDER WHAT I DID TO MY FACE. I AM 77YRS OLD AND DO NOT HAVE A WRINKLE ON MY FACE.&lt;br /&gt;MY SISTERS SAY MY SKIN LOOKS TRANSPARENT PRETTY PINK LIKE A CHINA DOLL.&lt;br /&gt;I JUST RAN OUT AND AM PANICY TO RECIEVE SOME MORE WHEN I GET SOME MONEY.&lt;br /&gt;I RECOMENT THIS PRODUCT TO ALL WHO READ THIS. COME ON GIRLS, YOU HAVE NOTHING&lt;br /&gt;TO LOSE BUT LOTS OF WRINKLES.</li>
    <li> I have used this product but order elsewhere.  When I received this is was dark beige in color, Not White as it should be, and smelled bad.  I requested a return and reordered thinking it might have been a bad batch.  Not the case.  I also returned the second purchases for a refund.</li>
    <li> Received bottles of Levela in jars without working pump compliant phoned to Leveta Five times asking for new product or new jars with working pumps they hung up on me every time I called poor customer service.&lt;br /&gt;J.C.</li>
    <li> It turned my face red and it didn&#x27;t feel moisturized at all. Super dry in the morning...I used it for 7 days to make sure my skin wasn&#x27;t  just &amp;#34;adjusting&amp;#34; to it. I gave it to a friend since it was practically new and maybe she&#x27;ll have better luck.</li>
    <li> Know that the results are very good.  And also very expensive.  Works out to at least $90 an ounce since the bottle is less than 9 ounces.  Half of bottle is hollow with plastic halfway down.  Still I liked the product with skin results very good.</li>
    <li> This products works well for me and I really like the result it gave me but the smell is too strong. This cream has a very strong bad smell. I actually had many patients turned away from when I do their vitals.  It&#x27;s also too expensive for the small amount of cream. It&#x27;s the smell that I stopped using this product.</li>
    <li> Love this product - The moisturizer really work, you can feel it right away.  It goes on easy and you can feel your pores tightening</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a few months and I love it.  The lines around my neck are almost gone and the skin is tighter.  My face feels smooth and the frown lines are almost gone!  LOVE THIS PRODUCT!</li>
    <li> Fine lines and wrinkles seem to vanish within days of using this product. My skin looks more youthful than ever before. I am truly a believer!!</li>
    <li> I love it! I have ordered it more than once. I don&#x27;t want to run out of it, because it really is a wonderful product that works immediately! I use it as a foundation and have received many compliments on my complexion!</li>
    <li> I like this product. Very soft skin after using it for a month or so. Wrinkle free stuff does not ever do what it claims but if it succeeds in soiftening and moisturizing then I like it.</li>
    <li> Try this instead: much cheaper and works great [[ASIN:B00ATFTNDG B00ATFTNDG]]  This worked great in the first 30 days I could see results.  Way cheaper also.</li>
    <li> This made no different at all. And it didn&#x27;t last very long.  I used a moderate amount, but it was empty very soon. I must say that there is a money-back guarantee--no questions asked.  I&#x27;m getting a full refund.  Maybe it will work better for you.  (I am 69. Perhaps there&#x27;s no hope for someone my age.  smile)</li>
    <li> I have pretty excellent skin for being on the brink of 40 especially since I grew up on the beaches in South Africa. I don&#x27;t really have wrinkles to speak of, but I am always interested in making my skin look smoother, more even-toned and feel softer. I put this stuff on following directions and had to moisturise within 10 minutes because my skin felt itchy and tight. Much to my horror, when I looked in the mirror I saw more fine creases and wrinkles than I have ever had (even after a weekend of dehydration and partying!) This is definitely not on my simple daily skin care regimen.</li>
    <li> Started Levela about 2 weeks ago and I&#x27;m using it in combination with AuraVie 3-in1 Rejuvenation system. So far my skin likes it and I do feel a little bit of tightening. No major changes yet, but the combo is still light and does not feel like it&#x27;s caked up. Waiting a few more weeks to see a major difference.</li>
    <li> Did not feel like, smell like, look like or work like Levela I received at higher price on product website.  Also, stopped pumping after 3rd day.  I would gladly pay the higher price to get the product I received before.  This did nothing as far as I could see.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 50 and have had mild acne since I was 11.  This product did nothing for my wrinkles but I didn&#x27;t have an acne breakout the entire month I used it.  When I ran out of the product, I started breaking out again.  I just reordered it as an acne medication not a wrinkle reducer.</li>
    <li> After using this product for one week saw no decrease in wrinkles or fine lines on face at all. ( none) this is a fake product, just another sales gimmick. Hand lotion works just as well to moisturize your skin. Would not recommend to any one.  The make up women put on their face covers up the fine lines and wrinkles not this product at all. Do not buy this product it does not work period.</li>
    <li> I have been using Splendyr along with Levela for several months. I asked my husband if he noticed a difference. He agreeded with me that my face is toner and softer. The result are well worth the cost. I will continue to use both products.</li>
    <li> Very good product. thanks</li>
    <li> WONDERFUL PRODUCT RESULTS IN A WEEK :-) I AM ALREADY GETTING COM[PLIMENTS ON MY SKIN THIS REALLY WORKS CANNOT SAY ENOUGH</li>
    <li> boo expensive doesn&#x27;t work</li>
    <li> I have had veins showing through my skin on my face since my 20s due to the strain of body building.  Makeup is useless in covering&lt;br /&gt;It up because I had to put it on so thick, it was less embarrassing to just let the veins show. I&#x27;m talking about small red spider-type veins and a overall reddish appearance (not rosacea - I have seen a doctor). Anyway, to cut through the chase, I saw a popular talk show which had tested a bunch of products and provided their results. They mentioned that Levela, used along with BeauteMD, showed excellent results so I decided to try them. I&#x27;d tried everything else!  It only took 4 days for me to start seeing results. Not only was my skin smooth and younger looking, my complexion was noticeably different!  My family members, who live in a different state and I don&#x27;t get to see that often, noticed immediately!  I must say I was so happy I was brought to tears!  For years I&#x27;ve endured questions from people, including total strangers, and ALWAYS children, about what was wrong with my face. Was I overheated?  Was I sunburned?  Did I need to sit down (I guess I looked l like I was going to pass out!).  And I haven&#x27;t even mentioned the crows feet and heavy eyelids and laugh/frown lines. Those are much, much less noticeable!  Like I said...I&#x27;m thrilled with this product when used in conjunction with the BeauteMD.  I recommend them to anyone and everyone!  Unfortunately, you can&#x27;t get the Beaute MD from Amazon, but the Levela is much cheaper through Amazon.  Oh yeah, I also use on the backs of my hands and they look years younger as well!  I swear it!!!  Give it a try!  If you don&#x27;t get the same results, I would be very surprised.  BTW....I am 53 and spent the first 35 years of my life on the beach and the wrinkles on my face and hands really showed it, but you&#x27;d never it know now!!!  Also, I use very little dabs as it goes a long way.  Small dabs around my eyes and on the creases of my mouth and forehead, and on my cheeks and nose. Just small dabs!  After it is soaked in, I then apply the Beaute MD over my entire face and neck, and it doesn&#x27;t take th a t much of it either. You don&#x27;t have to slather it on to get results!</li>
    <li> It seemed to work ok but a little to pricy for me. There is not much in the container - done already</li>
    <li> Not worth the price!  This bottle has a false bottom near the top.  Only lasted about a week.  It contains less than .5 of an oz.  Good product but deceiving.</li>
    <li> Deceptive practices used by Levela; they said it was sponsored by Dr. Oz, and it wasn&#x27;t. They asked online if I wanted to keep receiving the product for $89, and I said no. They sent me another bottle and charged my credit card  $89!</li>
    <li> I rated this ok due to lightness of the product, I like the feel on my skin. Goes on well under makeup. However, I had some packaging issues, it appeared the lid screwed off, then I couldn&#x27;t get the product out of the container. Then a week or so in, I realized it actually had a pump on it, which I couldn&#x27;t get the product to dispense, so ended up taking the whole top back off and using it that way. I will see how long this lasts as far as the amount of product, to see if I purchase it again.</li>
    <li> It broke me out after trying twice.  Merchant was great to work with though.  I appreciated all their help.  Excellent customer service if you need it.</li>
    <li> Still using it....Not sure there is much of a change</li>
    <li> Ok -- here goes. Have you looked closely at the pics of the blonde who supposed used this product? It has to be photoshopped. Not one strand of hair is in a different place 14 days later -- supposedly when they took another picture showing the GREAT results! Get smart people.  Do you really want to throw your money away?</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t click any stars and would never purchase this product again. In September, 2013, I ordered the sample for under $5.00 and was immediately charged. I received the first shipment in October but DIDN&#x27;T OPEN IT, waiting for a bill letting me know how much it cost. When the second order arrived, I immediately called Levela and discovered that the charge was $89.95. I returned both orders in one box the very next day and expected to be refunded $179.90. I discovered later that since the first order was over 30 days, the $89.95 could not be refunded. So I paid them $89.95 for NOTHING as they kept both products and did not notify me they were doing so.  They never billed me, never let me know how much the product cost until I called them. Lesson learned: don&#x27;t order anything until you know up front how much the cost will be!  This is not an ethical company and I would advise anyone considering purchasing their product, to be careful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I just discovered after I wrote the first post that another $89.95 was charged to my checking account. I only received a total of two shipments but was billed for three and refunded for one only. So my donation to Levela was a total of $179.90. Again, be very careful when dealing with this company. I was never told anything about a 30-day return policy or that charges were being made to my checking account. I only learned the cost when I made the call. This company needs to inform customers up front about costs, refund policies and charges being made to accounts.</li>
    <li> Made my face feel pasty, fell for the advertisements, but company is shady</li>
    <li> It does completely nothing to my skin and the smell is really, really bad. Please don&#x27;t waste your money like I did....</li>
    <li> Levela is a good product, but I am just starting to see some results.  The ads all give the impression that 3-4 weeks and you&#x27;re going to be AMAZED...  It&#x27;s helping, but I&#x27;m not AMAZED.</li>
    <li> The product did not seem to make a difference to any wrinkles or to the over all skin, also did not like the product smell.&lt;br /&gt;I would not recommend the product .</li>
    <li> I stopped using for a while and my face didn&#x27;t feel or look the same - back to using it regularly and love it.</li>
    <li> I ordered my first bottle and loved the way it made my face feel.  It did a great job filling in my &amp;#34;laugh lines&amp;#34; in just a short period of time.  With my second bottle I used it once maybe twice then the pump quit working.  I tried switching pumps but the bottles were different so it didn&#x27;t fit.  I contacted the company twice but never got an answer back.  This product is way too expensive to not be able to benefit from!</li>
    <li> This product did keep my skin from getting more wrinkles.&lt;br /&gt;The could be improvements made to the fragrance.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product to someone for maintaining their aging skin.</li>
    <li> I have used Levela for almost a year,and it really works will for me.  The delivery was great and very fast and the price was excellent!&lt;br /&gt;Thank you,&lt;br /&gt;Veronica Killen</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure if it works.</li>
    <li> First time user of Levela.  I have used it 3 or 4 weeks now and have not noticed any change in my skin other than it feels pasty and stinks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I asked my husband if he had noticed any change.  He agreed no change in wrinkles and that the smell was really bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope this helps someone save some money.</li>
    <li> very happy with this product. worked very well. worth the money.I would recommend this to anybody who needs it. thanx</li>
