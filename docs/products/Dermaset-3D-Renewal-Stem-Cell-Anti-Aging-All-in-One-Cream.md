    <li> I love Dermaset! The cream works great and really firms the skin. I love how it goes right onto the skin and is light so I apply it right before I go to sleep!&lt;br /&gt;The next morning I wake up and see and feel the noticeable difference in my skin.&lt;br /&gt;I also like that it doesn&#x27;t clog my pores or make my skin greasier, a huge plus because my skin is naturally more oilier!</li>
