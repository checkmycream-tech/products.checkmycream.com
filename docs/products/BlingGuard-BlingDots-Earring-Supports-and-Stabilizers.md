<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Exactly as described, was delivered fast.</li>
    <li> I have always used the ear lift brand, and these are a nice size for smaller lobes. They also stabilize the earrings better with the material being a little thicker.</li>
    <li> Works better than others I&#x27;ve bought.  Will buy again.</li>
    <li> If you want your earrings to sit perfectly on your ear, you need these!  They are the one of the best, as is Wonderlobes.  I really hate to see women wearing earrings, and their ear lobes are stretched.  Not a good look.</li>
    <li> Saw these on a national TV shopping channel and attempted to order. They were out of stock, so checked Amazon and was happy to not only find the product, but also at a lower cost. They work as described but I have difficulty placing them in the correct spot on the back of my ears. Plus when removing, several strands of hair stick to them . Nice case.</li>
    <li> They stick to the back of my earrings gumming up the screw. Would not recommend. Sticky everywhere on the earring your hair and fingers.</li>
    <li> I bought the Bling Guards along with the Ear Lobe Wonder Ear support patches. My left earring hole tore al the way thru. I didn&#x27;t know until I tried to put earrings on and couldn&#x27;t. That&#x27;s when I saw it had torn all the way. The Ear Lobe Wonder patches work great and do hold the earring even though the hole tore completely.. I use the bling Guards and Lobe Wonder patches together. They are like bras for earrings. No drooping, and your earrings stay perky!! Perfection! Cheaper than cosmetic surgery!&lt;br /&gt;These add the extra support to keep earrings in when the piercing has torn. It would also help those with stretched out piercings from heavy earrings. Now my earrings are perky and they stay in!!  What great inventions!!!  The BlingGuards are little round patches and you place them behind your ear, the back side of the piercing ( or lack there of in my case). The Bling Guards are thicker than the Lobe Wonders. I need all the support I can get. I think just the Bling Guards would work well!!  Then put your earring on thru the patch. They work wonderfully!  I always put the earring thru the back and thru the patches first. Then I put the earring in from the front. That way I can put them in easily. Remember, one of my piercings is torn all the way thru. I found that to be the easiest way for my situation!!  Brilliant and very smart product!!  They are super sticky, so I don&#x27;t worry about them falling off! You can even wear them for a couple of days!!</li>
    <li> These stabilizers work great! Only problem for me is that they don&#x27;t last long. Come off in the shower. Lobe Wonder works better for me.</li>
    <li> Clever earring supports.  They work great and are very easy to use.</li>
    <li> Works perfectly.  Only last 2 to 3 days before earrings start to hang down, but they are well worth the cost to wear my large earrings again.</li>
    <li> Couldn&#x27;t get my earring through them.</li>
    <li> Did not work for me. Sending back.</li>
    <li> I can now wear earrings again! These things are wonderful. I have very stretched earlobes &amp; thought I could never wear earrings again. They would hang funny or fall out! Now I can wear the most delicate to the most dangly thanks to these. I keep them on for a few days &amp; I keep them at the higher end of my earlobes. Eventually I&#x27;d  like to get surgery to repair my earlobes, but that won&#x27;t be for awhile, so I will never be without these! Even after the surgery I will use them because they reinforce the back of your earlobe. Your ear isn&#x27;t taking on the weight of the earrings, the Bling Guards are. Thanks for making such a great product!!!</li>
    <li> The hole in my left earlobe is stretched out and earrings droop badly, even the smallest. I have used the clear patches for several years. They are ok, better than without anything. I decided to try blingdots, even though they are twice the price of my clear patches. The blingdots hold the earring in my stretched out earlobe so well that earring looks just like in the other 3 ears. The blingdot lasts 3-4 days while the clear dots lasted 1-2 days, so the prices averages out to about the same. The blingdots don&#x27;t leave a sticky residue like the others I was using. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, the clear patches are ok for the money--the bling dots  just work better for me. I have already ordered another box of these and will continue to buy them in the future.</li>
    <li> These provide the support you really need with a stretched earlobe or when wearing heavier earrings.  I like them much better than the Lobe Wonder Ear Product as those are like thin tape, and this is more like a cotton patch. This is an excellent product that I highly endorse.  You pay a little more, but you won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> I had tried another kind before I found these NO comparison!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 65 and you know what that means for earlobes. I have a pair of heavy 3 stone studs. Didn&#x27;t expect it to work. So pleasantly surprised. My ears look way younger than me. Hahaha</li>
    <li> These are better than the other popular brand I tried.  They support a heavier earring quite well.  In fact, I use it on my ear that has an elongated pierced hole as well as my &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; ear to keep it from stretching.  To help the earring support stick properly, It is important to vigorously clean the back of the earlobe with alcohol and a cotton swab to remove natural body oils and/or left over adhesive after removing a support.</li>
    <li> Excellent!! I like these better then Lobe Wonder..I find that these are more sturdy and truly hold the weight of the earring.&lt;br /&gt;These are a must buy for all you ladies like me wearing beautiful but heavy earrings that are stretching the piercing.  Great Product...will never stop using these.</li>
    <li> I love this it really works. I used it for my sons wedding. My earing stayed in place. It really helps for sagging earlobes. Buy it!</li>
    <li> Hello,  I purchased these in hopes of helping with my ear lobes because I recently got my haircut very short and was self conscious about my ear lobes.  They did not help with my large chandelier earrings.  They did help with my diamond ear studs.  I must say I was a little disappointed.  I even tried to place two patches together to see if I would get the results they claimed.  I was unsuccessful.  The patches do however stay in place.  I would also suggest making these in brown and for people of color.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> These are great.  I use them daily.  I have already gone through 4 boxes and will continue to order as needed!</li>
    <li> I use these for wearing heavier earrings, especially earrings with wires.  They support the fragile cartilage of the earlobe, and make the earring &#x27;hang&#x27; and display better.  Even heavier earrings with posts, like the trendier large pearl-type studs.  They stick well, I can even wear them in the shower, and sometimes (not recommended by the manufacturer) wear them 2 days in a row.  They are pale beige (&amp;#34;flesh colored&amp;#34;), so women of color might want to use them with hair down to cover the back of the ears, if that is a bother.&lt;br /&gt;There is a similar product out there, &amp;#34;clear&amp;#34; colored, that I also use, especially when wearing the hair in an updo.  But the Bling Guards are of heavier, more supportive material, and are my favorites.  Never want to run out, so I buy multiple packs.</li>
    <li> This is exactly what I was looking for; I was pleasantly surprised.  I was a little skeptical but am very happy I ordered it.  I will buy again.</li>
    <li> Comfortable, easy to apply and much better than others I have used. They last for several days after application too without breaking down. I will be using these for a long time.</li>
    <li> No more sagging earrings, works very well, would recommend it to anyone. If your earrings are heavy or the holes in your ears are somewhat slit this product is for you.</li>
    <li> Bought hoping they would help keep my earrings from drooping, did not serve me well.  However, I was trying to use these to keep fake gauges pointing up, and they are huge.  So I&#x27;m not really using them for 100% their intended purpose, but I&#x27;m still left with a buncha useless blingdots :/&lt;br /&gt;Gonna have to think up another way to keep these gauges from drooping... probably one that costs less this time.</li>
    <li> totally awesome product!  arrived super fast, exactly what I ordered.  Gave two away and kept one pack for myself.  Love love love them!!  All of a sudden I can use my heavier earings that I have not been wearing for years!  Because of my bling guards I have a way more extensive earing collection!!</li>
    <li> Diamond stud earring that would never sit correctly now look fabulous. This works, simply said! Easy to use, happy customer.</li>
    <li> I have to say this is a really good product.  If you have earrings that are a bit heavy it is good to use the earring support.  This product is good would recommend to anyone.</li>
    <li> This is amazing!! Works exactly as described! My problem with earrings is finally solved!</li>
    <li> These work really well.  They support the heavy earrings and don&#x27;t droop.  However, I&#x27;m slightly allergic to something in the glue or product as I develop a rash on the back of my earlobe every time I use them.</li>
    <li> Bought these for my cousin.  She REALLY likes this product and was THRILLED that she could finally wear earrings again after more than a decade of not being able to.</li>
    <li> The only reason why I gave them 4 stars is that I have not tried them yet, but I can tell you that they arrived when expected. Also, I love the fact they are in a nice case. They are easy to store and will be easy to take along when traveling. They look like a sturdy option to help wear earrings.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried other brands of ear stabilizers and ended up not being able to use them for more than a few hours. These are truly hypoallergenic and have great staying power. My only suggestion is that they be offer in a brown shade as well for women of color who have short hair.</li>
    <li> These really are important to me by allowing me to wear earrings without having surgery to reduce the size of the piercing hole. (My toddler tugged on my earring one day years ago). They also last a long time for each use and are soft. I really like the case as well.</li>
    <li> In a word...Brilliant!  I have slits instead of holes in my earlobes.  With this ingenious product I can COMFORTABLY wear very heavy, swinging, big ass earrings all day with no pain/discomfort. These dots eliminate the look of a slit in my earlobe.  You should give them a try.</li>
    <li> Love this product! It works great if your piercing is stretched out from heavy earrings over the years!</li>
    <li> A much needed product for one whose earlobes hit her knees (almost!) and an excellent price!</li>
    <li> Amazing clever great product!!! I wear these bling dots all the time to support and protect my ears from big or somewhat heavy earrings. They are an amazing product ! Everyone who wears earrings needs to buy this!</li>
    <li> These are great stabilizers for my big, sometimes heavy, earrings.  My piercings are too low and over the years seem to have moved even lower, making earrings look like they were about to come out altogether.  The bling dots reinforced the holes and help the earrings sit higher (or at least appear that way) and my ear lobe to not look stretched.  In addition, the dots stay on for more than one wearing, through showering and hair-washing unless I remember/decide to take them off.  That means that one package of dots can last longer if you want them to, a good thing.</li>
    <li> Great product !!!!  They really work</li>
    <li> My 1st two attempts at using these dots weren&#x27;t successful.  I tried it again today....so far it seems to be positioned right ....so I will know more by the time I leave from work how well it works for me.</li>
    <li> this is a great product if you have pierced ears that have &amp;#34;stretched&amp;#34; due to wearing heavy pierced earrings; the earrings can now stay in place due to the earring supports. I recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I am somewhat pleased, but item doesn&#x27;t work quite as well w/ALL earrings as I expected.  I am using them in a manner &amp;#34;above and beyond&#x27; your instructions for one very heavy pair of earrings. I put one  bling dot in front (covered by large part of earring covering ear lobe and one bling dot in back- after earring is put through the pierced hole. It is working quite well.</li>
    <li> Thank goodness for bling dots !! I pierced my ear when I was 14 by myself and it was too low. Eventually the earrings that I wore made the hole bigger and it just split my ear. These are perfect for me to wear earrings again</li>
    <li> I would have given these a higher mark if they didn&#x27;t leave a little residue of the ear when you remove them, but they work better than any others I&#x27;ve tried.  They are thicker and stronger than the others and they really hold the earring right where you put it.  So, I don&#x27;t mind a little sticky residue that&#x27;s easily washed away.  :)  It can be a little touch putting the earring shaft through it so be careful to take your time.</li>
    <li> By far the best product I have bought! It really holds earrings in place and stays put shower after shower without leaving ay sticky smells or too much stickiness like thinner ones do. Delivery was fast.</li>
    <li> This actually save me from having surgery done on my ear. Which would have cost me thousand of dollars. This really work.</li>
    <li> I have a torn earlobe that makes my earrings hang lopsided. I tried these and they correct the problem. I can get them to hang even. once you get the hang of putting them (the dots) behind the lobe in the right location they stay put, for days if you don&#x27;t get them wet.</li>
    <li> Love these, they do just what they say they do.  I&#x27;ve been looking for something that would allow me to where stud earrings without drooping. One of my earlobs is split and with these you can&#x27;t see it AT ALL!</li>
    <li> Very satisfied with this seller!  The item arrived quickly and was as described.  I love the product.  It lives up to the claims in the ad.</li>
    <li> This is amazing. I have some heavy earrings I couldn&#x27;t wear and I can wear them comfortably now.</li>
    <li> these work WAY better than ear lifts.  perfect really!</li>
    <li> What a blessing to have this for big ear lobe holes</li>
    <li> So simple, so easy, and a fabulous product. My ear holes for earrings are stretched, and these provide a fantastic stabilizer to hold them flat and in place. Everyone must have these if you have pierced ears !!!</li>
    <li> Loving the Bling Dots, they are giving my ear lobes the support they need. No more sagging ear lobes.</li>
    <li> These are so much better than the flimsy plastic products. They are a foam backed product that allow you to wear your earrings securely where the hole used to be and not where it is stretched out to now. I wish I had these when I wore a small pair of diamond earrings (my father&#x27;s first gift to my mother many years ago), the earring and the backing fell through my ear and I lost them forever. Now, I always have this product on. And if you don&#x27;t change earrings often, you can wear a pair of these up to a week.</li>
    <li> Work just as described, and very comfortable.</li>
    <li> BlingGuard Blingdots are absolutely perfect, and they do the job.  I love them.</li>
    <li> Blingdots are a must have!  I have larger earlobes that droop when I wear heavy earrings, these dots have changed everything and now these new stylish earrings I use to not be able to wear look great on me.  They pull the earring up so that they hang perfectly and somehow they make the earring itself feel light as oppose to heavy.  They are a great find and a must have for your jewelry box!</li>
    <li> This is my 2nd order of Blingdots and I love them. The first day I received them I did a test with my heaviest earrings and wore a Blingdot on only 1 ear. A couple of hours into my day I was yanking off the earring on the non-Blingdot ear but the other earring felt 100% comfortable. I haven&#x27;t gone a day in dangles without them since. It&#x27;s a must have for all the mommies out there who&#x27;s kids have grabbed at their earrings enough times to have stretched your earring holes. Also makes a great gift for your girlfriends. Absolutely love them!!!</li>
    <li> Blingdots are a lifesaver for those heavy earrings that start hurting after just a few minutes. I can now wear them all night ! Also a great fix for my studs that always tend to hang down. They are now perfectly kept in place ! What a smart accessory.</li>
    <li> BlingDots have become an everyday staple for me. Whether I am wearing small or big earrings - the BlingDots make them look and feel great!</li>
    <li> Okay - so I just ordered these today. Such a great idea! I got some for me (heavy earrings give me a headache!) and some for my mom (she never wears her earrings anymore since they tug too much on her lobes). I&#x27;ll update my review once I get them - but I&#x27;m just so excited that there is a product out there for us! Now I can rock out my super cool (albeit heavy!) earrings!</li>
    <li> I saw these in a magazine.  I love them!  It makes all my earrings fit better.  I like to wear big, fashionable earrings but usually would end up taking them off because they hurt my ears.  They work so well for me that I ended up giving these to all my Mom, sisters and friends for Christmas.  They are such a cute and appreciated gift.</li>
    <li> BlingDots are an everyday staple for me! Whether I&#x27;m wearing my studs or my chandeliers - the BlingDots make them look and feel great!</li>
    <li> These work great for me.</li>
    <li> These ear supports are  superior.  I&#x27;ve tried them all.  My ear lobes are badly stretched, but the fact that these dots are flesh toned, makes my ears look better.  Earrning fit snugly.  I highly recommend BlingDots.</li>
    <li> These are the greatest !!!</li>
    <li> My earring holes stretched and became slits from wearing heavy earrings. I didn&#x27;t like the way it looked and just stopped wearing my earrings - but now I can. When I use BlingDots, I can wear all the fashionable and statement earrings I want without my earring holes stretching.  They are comfortable and my earrings look great !!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-- Barbara B.</li>
    <li> BlingDots are such a quick and easy fix, I no longer wear earrings without them.  They make my long statement earrings more comfortable to wear, and they always hang perfectly. I&#x27;ve purchased as gifts for all my friends!</li>
    <li> As described, no complaints.</li>
    <li> I started using BlingDots several months ago and they make a HUGE difference in the way my earrings look! BlingDots are a must have when I travel and they are VERY EASY to use! I highly recommend trying these out!!!! BRILLIANT PRODUCT!!!!</li>
    <li> awesome, does as it claims to.</li>
    <li> Fantastic!  Tried a different brand before but these are the best invention!  I was going to go to a plastic surgeon to fix my earring holes... No rush now!  Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Ordered these for my wife. She likes them. Very fast service.</li>
    <li> .Great Product.  Keeps the earing at the right place.</li>
    <li> The very best product I&#x27;ve found for supporting pierced earrings when the lobe is splitting.  Very comfortable and you get a lot of them</li>
    <li> These work as expected and boy do they stick to your skin!  I was able to keep them on for 5 days when I tried them.  I just scrubbed my ear around them during the shower and I was surprised that they still had to be pulled off when I removed them!  I do think they work better with post earrings, and unfortunately I don&#x27;t have any of them to try with these.  All my earrings are the click-top type or the ones that just slide in and dangle from the ear, not sure what they are called.  They are not posts.  Though these dots help with that style, there is still some drooping.  I am anxious to acquire some post earrings now and give these dots another try.  I&#x27;m sure they work better with the post back earrings.</li>
    <li> So much better than the thin ones! So happy to have found these. I wear them for days - great product!</li>
    <li> These are great! I have really small ears but I love long dangly earrings. These allow me to wear really great earrings and my ears don&#x27;t get stretched or hurt!</li>
    <li> Quality product as advertised.</li>
    <li> My daughter told me about earring backings and the way the improve the look and feel of wearing heavier earrings.  I am now savvy to that, and I&#x27;m spreading the word.  These are just what I wanted, and I love the little black storage box, too!</li>
    <li> Very pleased with delivery and product!!</li>
    <li> Nice. Comfortable.  Does the job!  Will probably need surgery to correct an enlarged piercing caused by an allergy to nickel in my silver earrings, but these will come in very handy until I can get the surgery.  Keeps my earrings in a good position so they do not slip to the lower end of the enlarged piercing.</li>
    <li> Thought it would be invisible,  too light for women of mahogany skin tone.</li>
    <li> These are fantastic.  Very easy to apply and they really adhere to your ear.  Will definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> After wearing heavy ear rings over the years the wholes are a little stretched. BlingGuard really holds my ear rings up and gives me that extra support. Fantastic product.</li>
    <li> Very thick. You only need one of these.</li>
    <li> Finally my earrings look good and stay in place and are infinitely more comfortable.  These simple to use disks have made it so much easier and fun to wear slightly heavy or awkward earrings.  EASY to use and they are completely reliable and invisible.  Just place them carefully on the back of ear lobe behind piercing and they stay in place, then place the earring as usual and poke gently through product!  They secure and stabilize and that is the last time you are aware of them..except that your earrings sit perfectly and comfortably!  PURE GENIUS..why didn&#x27;t I think of that??</li>
    <li> In the past I avoided large earrings because they killed my earlobes! I saw these on HSN and ordered some. They are fantabulous!!!!!! Earrings that previously hurt my delicate earlobes are now worn all the time with the BlingDots.....no pain at all. I highly recommed!</li>
    <li> They work.....just as expected</li>
    <li> I have several friends who have had problems with their ear rings tugging on their ears....I have had enlarged openings because I use to sleep in my earrings and these little disks have sure made wearing earrings a pleasure again...Thank you</li>
    <li> The Bling Guards did not disappoint!  I had to wear a heavy earring all day and it really lended me the support I needed to be comfortable. They also stayed in place until I removed them the next day.  I would definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> One of my best purchases.  You get a lot in the kit in a great container.  One of my piercings has a small tear on my ear.  I can wear all my beautiful earings once again--love it</li>
    <li> Works for heavier earrings!</li>
    <li> These are a life saver.  I can wear all my favorite earrings again.</li>
    <li> I love the BlingGuard Bling Dots!!!  Wouldn&#x27;t be without them!!!</li>
    <li> Stays on for days and days. Can&#x27;t even tell they are there. Helps hold earrings in place with no slipping. Great product.</li>
    <li> The wife likes these the best of what&#x27;s out there!  She says they&#x27;re a little thicker than the others, and that the adhesive is the best!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Prep the back of your earlobe with cotton and rubbing alcohol, allow to dry before applying these, and they&#x27;re good for days--even after hair washings!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;RayB</li>
    <li> Best invention EVER! I can now wear ANY earrings. I have very torn ear lobes from heavy earrings (during the 80&#x27;s) and could not wear earrings. Even my diamond studs were falling over. Now, with Blingdots I can wear anything. It also prevents having your ear lobes torn further. This is just a part of my morning routine and my daily wardrobe.</li>
    <li> Great item&lt;br /&gt;Thank you</li>
    <li> These are great. I have trouble losing earrings because my pierced ears are pulled. Earrings fall out easily. these guards securely hold my earrings in and do not fall off until I peel them off.</li>
    <li> I must admit, I had totally stopped wearing earrings over the past five years or so because they just hurt my ears.  I bought BlingDots on the recommendation of a friend who loves them, and I am hooked!  I have brought back many pairs of earrings from retirement, plus I am now buying earrings again.  Good stuff!</li>
    <li> Love these! work like a charm!</li>
    <li> Blingguard is amazing such a simple solution to stretched earing holes.they work perfectly!</li>
    <li> Wife loves them, they work very well and stay attached for days even through several showers.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t been able to wear heavy earrings for at least a decade.  I absolutely LOVE Blingdots!  I just pop my earrings through them and I can wear even my heaviest pair all night long without any pain.  I&#x27;m very excited for all of the new jewelery purchases I will be making this season.  Fantastic!</li>
    <li> Surprisingly useful!! These things have staying power!! They stay on for days, you have to pick them off!! WM has a thinner plasticy brand that comes off daily and is quite thin. These are much thicker. I have a hard time centering them but once they are on they are on. I am allergic to Nickel and over the years my ear holes stretched from pulling on my earrings when my earlobes got hot and itchy. I can actually wear a 6 gauge earring and these have enabled me to wear normal earrings for the first time in 25 years. No longer do my earrngs sag or look like they are hanging from the very bottom of my earlobes.</li>
    <li> I can now wear  dangeling earings.</li>
    <li> great help with heavier earrings. no pulling on lobes now.</li>
    <li> These work well, stay on your ears. Only with one pair of heavier earrings (the reason I bought them in the 1st place) did they fail. As long as you don&#x27;t have heavy earrings, they work.</li>
    <li> Useless.  Not stiff enough to do the job.  Not even CLOSE!  Do NOT buy or waste your money!!!</li>
    <li> These are amazing , I can wear dangly / heavyish earrings again. I am a huge fan and have given some to friends.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m already a huge fan of the BlingWraps, so I decided to try these BlingDots, too.  These are unbelievably great and super comfy!  These make my heavy earrings stand up straight and in place.  When I wore my heavy/large earrings without these dots in the past, I would obsessively check to make sure they were still on my ears at least every 20 minutes...like a nervous habit! Now, I wear the dots and my earrings feel really secure on my ear and I don&#x27;t have to worry about checking to see if I lost an earring. I am into this BlingGuard company...they seem to make quality products and I read on the package they&#x27;re all made in the USA! Even the boxes their products come in are super nice and reusable!</li>
    <li> Bling Dots are amazing!! I use them every single day, and they allow me to wear earrings again. For someone with torn ear lobes like mine, they&#x27;re vital. But they&#x27;re great for anyone -- I&#x27;ve got all my friends hooked on them. They keep studs in place and looking perfect, no drooping on your ears. And they help stablize heavier earrings so they don&#x27;t hang low or tear your ear lobes. I love them!!</li>
    <li> It was exactly as expected thanks</li>
    <li> I have several pairs of earrings that I rarely wear because they are constantly falling off - Blingdots has solved that problem! I wore one of my favorite pairs yesterday and they didn&#x27;t budge! Thank you for a solution I&#x27;ve been needing for awhile.</li>
