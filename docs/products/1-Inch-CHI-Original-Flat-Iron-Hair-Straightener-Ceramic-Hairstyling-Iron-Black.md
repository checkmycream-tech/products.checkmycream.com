      <li>Quick shipping and awesome flat iron</li>
      <li>It is very quick to get heated up.</li>
      <li>My hair has strong waves, the iron straightened them - and I can&#x27;t even see any bends.  </li>
      <li>Works fantastic on my permed hair.</li>
      <li>Quick delivery and reasonably priced!!!</li>
      <li>The iron is lighter than I expected and has no temperature adjustment, so I was cautiously optimistic that the straightener would do all the great things I heard about from friends and online reviews.  </li>
      <li>I received my order quickly.  </li>
      <li>finish straightening my hair, and it got hotter and did a better job than the brand new one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>

      <li>Shipping was VERY fast and the product was exactly as described.  </li>
      <li>100% authentic (my 2nd one, 1st one bought in 2006).</li>
      <li>I have purchased my first CHI in 2004, kept it all the way through college.</li>
      <li>first of all I received this product</li>
      <li>I love my flat iron and it arrived before the shipping dates.</li>
      <li>Shipping came fast and I can&#x27;t wait to use it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Taylor.</li>
      <li>Fast shipping.</li>
      <li>replaced it in 2009 with the exact same model CHI.  </li>
      <li>My hair is so soft and shiny.</li>
      <li>In the end I got out my 6 year old CHI (that I am replacing) and used to it</li>
      <li>If you dont have hard to straighten hair, this might still be okay for you, but I will definitely be switching to a different brand of straightener.</li>
      <li>It took less time than my old professional straightener and the end result is nicer.  </li>
      <li>will say, I have long thick coarse hair, so the heat issue is huge for me, I need a lot of power in a straightener, and CHI used to be the only brand that could accommodate that.  </li>

<li> a few weeks ago I decided it was time for a new one.  </li>
<li> Wasn&#x27;t expected until the following tuesday!</li>
<li> I got this one, and I am not sure it is the quality of CHI brand is not what it used to be, or these are cheaper than all the other CHI&#x27;s on amazon for a reason, but it did not get as hot as my other CHI straighteners have.</li>
<li> It came waaay sooner than expected.</li>
<li> and it Is small enough to travel with</li>
<li> Another bonus is the my hair feels silky - not a familiar feeling for me.  </li>

    <li> This seller was great, shipped quickly, as promised.  However, I am returning the straightener.  I have purchased my first CHI in 2004, kept it all the way through college. replaced it in 2009 with the exact same model CHI.  I had that one until a few weeks ago I decided it was time for a new one.  I got this one, and I am not sure it is the quality of CHI brand is not what it used to be, or these are cheaper than all the other CHI&#x27;s on amazon for a reason, but it did not get as hot as my other CHI straighteners have. It lost heat while using it, to the point where I could touch it, so I would wait for it to heat up again.  In the end I got out my 6 year old CHI (that I am replacing) and used to it finish straightening my hair, and it got hotter and did a better job than the brand new one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will say, I have long thick coarse hair, so the heat issue is huge for me, I need a lot of power in a straightener, and CHI used to be the only brand that could accommodate that.  If you dont have hard to straighten hair, this might still be okay for you, but I will definitely be switching to a different brand of straightener.</li>
