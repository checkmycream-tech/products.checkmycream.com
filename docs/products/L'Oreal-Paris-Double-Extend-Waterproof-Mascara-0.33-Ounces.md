      <li>Easy to apply</li>

      <li>Waterproof is important for me as I use a lot of eye drops and don&#x27;t want to have my mascara run down my face.  </li>
      <li>your lashes will look like they have fake lashes and at the same time they&#x27;ll look naturally beautiful.</li>
      <li>DOES MAKE YOU LASHES APPEAR THICKER AND FULLER, NEED TO REMOVE COMPLETELY BEFORE YOU GO TO BED</li>

      <li>I have really sensitive eyes and have not had any allergic reactions to the product.</li>
      <li>I was skeptical about this product, but it is easy to use, apply the clear/white first layer to lashes and then use the black/brown/whatever color you chose over it.</li>
      <li>Even if the mascara dries out it&#x27;s still worth it because it&#x27;s half the price of the Lancome with the SAME amount of primer in it.</li>

<li> Even if the mascara dries out it&#x27;s still worth it because it&#x27;s half the price of the Lancome with the SAME amount of primer in it.</li>
<li> so it&#x27;s harder to see, but when you put the mascara on it is very apparent on the lashes.</li>
<li> It helps the mascara stay on well during the day as well as giving some length to my lashes, which aren&#x27;t really short to begin with, but I find m lashes aren&#x27;t as long as they used to be when I was younger and when I wear dark brown eyeliner they sort of disappear.  </li>
<li> That side of the tube was completely dry.</li>
<li> LIKE THIS ONE, THIS MASCARA WAS SERIOUSLY NOTHING TO BRAG ABOUT AT ALL, AND THE BLACK DOES NOT COVER THE FIRST STEP UP</li>
<li> Double Extend Waterproof Lash Boosting Mascara, Black.  </li>
<li> This is less white than the Lancome</li>
<li> I did notice that the primer end almost seemed dry to me because I couldn&#x27;t see it, but when you rub the brush on your fingers they comeoff slightly wet.</li>
<li> The only thing I don&#x27;t like is that the black will flake some.</li>
<li> WOW your lashes will indeed look twice as long and thick, and you do not have to use a lot.</li>
<li> Very dry and clumpy.</li>
<li> Getting harder and harder to find the waterproof, however..</li>
<li> ALWAYS ON THE LOOK OUT FOR THE BETTER ONE, AND AS YOU KNOW YOU COME ACROSS SOME SERIOUS FAILS.</li>
<li> One side puffs up the lashes and the other darkens them.</li>
<li> I have very few eyelashes, but with this product my lashes look like I just left the salon</li>
<li> Was not happy because I believe it was old.</li>
<li> Upon arrival I was unable to open lash boosting (white section) of the mascara.</li>
<li> the black makes them show up.</li>
<li> The mascara (black section) had no issues with opening.</li>
<li> but he only problem is that it&#x27;s a little dry and the package is a little dirty outside</li>
<li> This one clumped, dried up in less than two weeks</li>
<li> This one beat them all, hands down!</li>
<li> I tried a few premium mascaras on my quest for a waterproof one one that didn&#x27;t smudge by days end, didn&#x27;t go on gloppy, and didn&#x27;t pull out a bunch of lashes during removal.</li>
<li> AND IT WAS NOT EASY FOR ME TO REMOVE EITHER</li>
<li> I have always had a hard time with mascara smearing even with waterproof, until a friend suggest this product.  </li>
<li> Sucks that they took this off the market.</li>
<li> Needless to say, I was totally disappointed in receiving what appeared to be old or used mascara.  </li>
<li> The ones you sent me were not able to be used!!</li>
<li> I wouldn&#x27;t say it looks as if I&#x27;m wearing false lashes or anything, but they do look improved when I wear this with another brand I wear with it.  </li>
<li> They all came dried out!!!!  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> They all came dried out!!!!  They are my favorite brand and I love the ones I bought originally at the drug store.  The ones you sent me were not able to be used!!</li>
    <li> The primer is what I wanted&amp; it&#x27;s as good as ever, but, I can&#x27;t believe I paid $33 for ONE tube! I assumed at that price there were more than one. Trust me I will never order again!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> DOES MAKE YOU LASHES APPEAR THICKER AND FULLER, NEED TO REMOVE COMPLETELY BEFORE YOU GO TO BED OR SOME LASHES WILL FALL OUT IN THE MORNING REALLY WEAKENS UR LASHES IF NOT WASHED OFF PRIOR TO SLEEP...</li>
    <li> It gives my thinning lashes a nice look the white end seems to make them thicker and longer looking then the black makes them show up. The only thing I don&#x27;t like is that the black will flake some.</li>
    <li> I used L&#x27;Oreal Splash Out and L&#x27;Oreal Lash Out for YEARS - ONLY mascara that would lengthen and darken my short, stubby lashes - plus the mascara would \\&quot;stick to\\&quot; the ends of my lashes, bulk them up AND keep them curled. Then L&#x27;Oreal discontinued the product. I&#x27;ve bought mascara after mascara and NOTHING worked liked Lash Out and Splash Out - UNTIL THIS PRODUCT! Hallelujah!!!!! This product lengthens, darkens, \\&quot;sticks to\\&quot; the lashes, bulks up the lashes AND keeps the curl! I HOPE L&#x27;OREAL DOESN&#x27;T DISCONTINUE THIS PRODUCT!!!!!!! And, I hadn&#x27;t heard about this product OR seen it advertised. I stumbled across it... GREAT PRODUCT!!!</li>
    <li> Awesome product. Gives the results it advertises. I have very few eyelashes, but with this product my lashes look like I just left the salon</li>
    <li> This has always been my favorite mascara. It used to be so easy to find in all the drugstores, now that there are so many other &amp;#34;new and improved&amp;#34; brands this one has gone by the wayside......glad for Amazon!!!</li>
    <li> your lashes will look like they have fake lashes and at the same time they&#x27;ll look naturally beautiful. IT&#x27;S A MUST!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a couple years.  I know the manufacturer can&#x27;t make claims but I can say that my lashes have not fallen out like before.  I use the white product then Mabelline full lash mascara.  It definitely makes your lashes look fuller; and I know I have more lashes now. I have really sensitive eyes and have not had any allergic reactions to the product.</li>
    <li> I have been using Lancome&#x27;s eyelash primer for the last year and I am finally out. I decided to try some of the drugstore brands and this works exactly the same as the Lancome. Even if the mascara dries out it&#x27;s still worth it because it&#x27;s half the price of the Lancome with the SAME amount of primer in it. I&#x27;m happy with it. I did notice that the primer end almost seemed dry to me because I couldn&#x27;t see it, but when you rub the brush on your fingers they comeoff slightly wet. This is less white than the Lancome so it&#x27;s harder to see, but when you put the mascara on it is very apparent on the lashes. Oh, I did not buy this on amazon.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a huge make up junkie (former freelance make up artist) and this is always my go-to mascara. I&#x27;ve tried plenty of brands ranging from drug-store labels to high-end brands, and I always end up going back to this one. Gives me nice, long, clump free lashes and never feels too heavy.</li>
    <li> Was not happy because I believe it was old. I have purchased this at local stores numerous times - and was always the perfect product for my eyelashes. This one clumped, dried up in less than two weeks and I tossed it away.</li>
    <li> Good one, but he only problem is that it&#x27;s a little dry and the package is a little dirty outside</li>
    <li> I love this product. It rates well on Environmental Working Group&#x27;s website. Reasonably priced and safer than most other mascaras.</li>
    <li> L&#x27;Oreal is a sister company of Lancôme. I love them both. Sucks that they took this off the market. The primer is amazing. The waterproof is a necessity in my life.</li>
    <li> Liked this, would try again</li>
    <li> I tried a few premium mascaras on my quest for a waterproof one one that didn&#x27;t smudge by days end, didn&#x27;t go on gloppy, and didn&#x27;t pull out a bunch of lashes during removal. This one beat them all, hands down! My new favorite daily mascara!</li>
    <li> Can never find it in the stores and when I do it&#x27;s at min $3 more.  This just shows up regularly when it&#x27;s time to change it out</li>
    <li> I have always had a hard time with mascara smearing even with waterproof, until a friend suggest this product.  I am delighted on how easy it is to apply and it comes off just as easy.</li>
    <li> One side puffs up the lashes and the other darkens them. Easy and simple. Product works and I would buy again.</li>
    <li> This works so much better for me than the brands with just the mascara.  I think the base coat does a great job of separating lashes and extending them so that the mascara doesn&#x27;t clump.  Waterproof is important for me as I use a lot of eye drops and don&#x27;t want to have my mascara run down my face.  :)  Getting harder and harder to find the waterproof, however..</li>
    <li> Maybe the 50th time I&#x27;ve bought this item (no joke). I&#x27;m a VIB at Sephora and love makeup - but no water proof mascara compares to this one from L&#x27;Oreal  - it always wins. Between tears, allergy season, or even rubbing the eye it stays put. The white primer coats nicely to add length and volume. The mascara is never clumpy like some waterproof ones can be. I&#x27;m a lifer of this product and even have it on &amp;#34;Subscribe and Save&amp;#34; with Amazon. TRY IT!</li>
    <li> I AM ALWAYS TRYING NEW MASCARA&#x27;S LIKE ALOT OF US GIRLS, ALWAYS ON THE LOOK OUT FOR THE BETTER ONE, AND AS YOU KNOW YOU COME ACROSS SOME SERIOUS FAILS. LIKE THIS ONE, THIS MASCARA WAS SERIOUSLY NOTHING TO BRAG ABOUT AT ALL, AND THE BLACK DOES NOT COVER THE FIRST STEP UP ALL THE WAY, I HAD WHITE THAT WAS SHOWING THRU FROM THE FIRST APPLICATION, NOT CUTE. AND IT WAS NOT EASY FOR ME TO REMOVE EITHER, I HAD TO TUG WAY MORE THAN ANYONE WANTS TO, TO REMOVE IT, I WILL CHALK THIS ONE UP TO LESSON LEARNED.</li>
    <li> Must be old product.  Very dry and clumpy.</li>
    <li> MAN I&#x27;M LOVING THIS EACH AND EVERY DAY.I LOVE IT, LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE IT.....TO ALL WOMENS BUY BUY BUY BUY BUY IT</li>
    <li> Great mascara. I just hope and pray it doesn&#x27;t get discontinued, like everything I seem to love (makeup wise).</li>
    <li> have been using this product for 4yrs now,have never had any problem with it running or smearing...would definitely recommend this to any one who wants to wear it for swimming,on a hot sweaty day working out etc...</li>
    <li> My favorite mascara ever!</li>
    <li> I initially purchased this because it&#x27;s EWG rating was pretty good and it&#x27;s price was right. I&#x27;ve since purchased 3 tubes! I have straight blonde lashes and this mascara really fills them out without ever caking up.</li>
    <li> Conditioner and mascara in one wand!  The waterproof version is perfect for sensitive eyes/contact lens wearers.  My favorite &amp;#34;drugstore&amp;#34; mascara.</li>
    <li> Loreal had a mascara and primer that worked better with thickening of lashes. This type did not do much thickening and separating.</li>
    <li> I was skeptical about this product, but it is easy to use, apply the clear/white first layer to lashes and then use the black/brown/whatever color you chose over it. WOW your lashes will indeed look twice as long and thick, and you do not have to use a lot. I love this and if you want longer looking lashes immediately--this is the product for you. Inexpensive too. Easy to apply</li>
    <li> I ordered L&#x27;Oreal Paris Double Extend Waterproof Lash Boosting Mascara, Black.  Upon arrival I was unable to open lash boosting (white section) of the mascara. The mascara (black section) had no issues with opening. Once opened with assistance from my husband.  That side of the tube was completely dry. Needless to say, I was totally disappointed in receiving what appeared to be old or used mascara.  I had no choice but to throw this item away.</li>
    <li> This mascara is one I buy as much as I can,  as i like the white primer that comes with it.  It helps the mascara stay on well during the day as well as giving some length to my lashes, which aren&#x27;t really short to begin with, but I find m lashes aren&#x27;t as long as they used to be when I was younger and when I wear dark brown eyeliner they sort of disappear.  I wouldn&#x27;t say it looks as if I&#x27;m wearing false lashes or anything, but they do look improved when I wear this with another brand I wear with it.  I learned on YouTube that wearing two mascaras make the lashes look longer too, and it works for me.</li>
