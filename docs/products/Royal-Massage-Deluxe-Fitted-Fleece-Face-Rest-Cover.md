    <li> This has been a great addition to my massage table.  It helps keep the client&#x27;s face a little bit more comfortable when laying prone.  It is nice to have your face against something soft and pillow like, instead of just the regular face cradle.  I have washed it (not putting it in the dryer) a few times and has not shrunk or fallen apart.  I am happy with this product</li>
    <li> As described very comfortable!</li>
    <li> bought it to have as extra to the table and cradle set I already had.  used it for awhile now and its just as fluffy and comfy as the day i got it.</li>
    <li> Love this. More comfortable than normal towel</li>
    <li> I was skeptical that this cover would solve my problem of having too hard of a head rest, (face plate? I&#x27;m an novice massage person) but it really does make a difference, and for 11.95, what a deal!</li>
    <li> No one likes &#x27;face cradle face&#x27; nor pressure to the face if you have sinus issues. Get this. It helps a little.</li>
    <li> Definitely made a difference on my face cradle; my clients had less marks on their faces afterwards, but still had noticeable marks. Clients also said it was more comfortable.</li>
    <li> This cover is made for the larger face cradles.  With very lax elastic, it slips and slides on mine.  Ended up paying money :( to have tighter? elastic put in.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift for my sister who&#x27;s studying massage.  The quality seems very good, but I haven&#x27;t seen how it holds up long-term.</li>
    <li> This face rest is not as fluffy as pictured.  I really need one so I will use it, but will order from another company for a thicker cover.</li>
    <li> It was exactly what I wanted</li>
    <li> I really like this product. It&#x27;s irised right and it truly gets the job done. Works great on my bed</li>
    <li> This is a great face rest cover! If you&#x27;re worried about shrinkage, was in cold water, with a little bleach, and line dry it!

Great price, and functions well!</li>

    <li> It&#x27;s so soft! I never enjoy laying prone on a massage table, so anything that makes is easier is a plus.</li>
    <li> Great size. It&#x27;s not bulky, and it fits the face cradle and leaves enough room to breathe. I think it&#x27;s increased the clients&#x27; comfort.</li>
    <li> The product in itself is very nice and soft but I ordered it, thinking it was an actual pillow. Remember it is only the cover, so it is empty and you need to pillow to put inside!</li>
