      <li>This bronzer is the best I have ever used!  </li>
      <li>Works great!</li>
      <li>I myself have a very very fair complexion, but this bronzer was perfect.</li>
      <li>So happy to have been able to get some of this discontinued product!!!  </li>
      <li>Anywho, I am happy with this one.</li>
      <li>Great color and great coverage :)</li>
      <li>Along with my face moisturizer and my fair skin looks &amp;#34; Sunkissed &amp;#34; to blend with my tanned body .</li>
      <li>I loved this stuff</li>
      <li>Always loved this shade.</li>
      <li>I am very pleased with the bronzer.  </li>
      <li>love it the color is great</li>
      <li>Better than a $50 concealer any day of the week!</li>
      <li>Fast delivery and happy with product!!</li>
      <li>This is nice though,</li>
      <li>really liked alot.</li>
      <li>found this product in a drug store, and apparently this product is no longer sold in most stores, so I am very happy that Amazon carries it.</li>
      <li>Always  bit of a gamble with the color-changing products, but this goes on easily and is fine when used sparingly, as it blends fairly well.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a good color though, but goes off quickly.</li>
      <li>:) I would recommend to anyone that likes to tan as well.</li>
      <li>This is more of a paste than a gel - was looking for something more translucent.</li>
      <li>sheer shimmer - bronze afterglow, which was always perfect.  </li>
      <li>It gave me a nice color but very natural wish</li>
      <li>Great color to wear with black and browns outfits.</li>
      <li>Was hoping for more of a gel which I had gotten in the past and really loved.  </li>
      <li>Love this bronzer, which blends easily and completely to create a natural bronzed look.  </li>
      <li>I really liked it, i used it for new year&#x27;s and it really looked natural.</li>
      <li>Exactly what I had been using, AND couldn&#x27;t find in the stores in my area.</li>
      <li>You have to rub in on your fingers to get the color activated first.</li>
      <li>Bottom line-if you have dry or combination skin, this product will give you the healthy glow you are looking for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t live without this bronzer !!</li>
      <li>i really.</li>
      <li>Usually , my body is somewhat tan , but I always use sun block on my face and chest ( I don&#x27;t need any more wrinkles ) !</li>
      <li>but it could use a little more staying power.</li>
      <li>A little pricey but glad to find it.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried other brands , but they don&#x27;t have the natural looking color of Almay !!</li>
      <li>It only takes a little tinkering to figure out how much to use so that it still looks</li>

<li> Very subtle, and looks pretty natural.  </li>
<li> Not overwhelming and not heavy.</li>
<li> Also, a little goes a long way if you like to blend as I do.</li>
<li> a bit orange y, just put on less.</li>
<li> But , not available in stores , at least in Fl. !  </li>
<li> Doesn&#x27;t look fake if you use it sparingly!</li>

    <li> I loved this stuff so I had to buy another! Works great!</li>
    <li> I really liked it, i used it for new year&#x27;s and it really looked natural. It gave me a nice color but very natural wish i really. really liked alot. Will definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t live without this bronzer !! But , not available in stores , at least in Fl. !  Usually , my body is somewhat tan , but I always use sun block on my face and chest ( I don&#x27;t need any more wrinkles ) ! So , I use just a dab of Almay bronzer..... Along with my face moisturizer and my fair skin looks &amp;#34; Sunkissed &amp;#34; to blend with my tanned body . I&#x27;ve tried other brands , but they don&#x27;t have the natural looking color of Almay !! I like to buy several at a time , in fear that it may be discontinued !! Please , keep this product ...... It&#x27;s a winner !!!</li>
    <li> Fast delivery and happy with product!!</li>
    <li> So happy to have been able to get some of this discontinued product!!!  A little pricey but glad to find it.</li>
    <li> love it the color is great</li>
    <li> Love this bronzer, which blends easily and completely to create a natural bronzed look.  I was relieved to find the availability of this product on Amazon since I can no longer find it on store shelves.</li>
    <li> Was hoping for more of a gel which I had gotten in the past and really loved.  This is more of a paste than a gel - was looking for something more translucent.</li>
    <li> Very subtle, and looks pretty natural.  Wish it stayed on longer though.  You have to rub in on your fingers to get the color activated first.</li>
    <li> I like this but it could use a little more staying power. It&#x27;s a good color though, but goes off quickly.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I had been using, AND couldn&#x27;t find in the stores in my area.</li>
    <li> I myself have a very very fair complexion, but this bronzer was perfect. Not overwhelming and not heavy. Also, a little goes a long way if you like to blend as I do. Great color and great coverage :)</li>
    <li> I use this product for an undereye concealer. I spraytan so I need something \\&quot;tan\\&quot; to cover my undereye circles and this works. STORY OF MY LIFE they no longer sell this at drug stores. GRRRRRRRRRrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr Thank u Amazon for always coming thru for me. :) I would recommend to anyone that likes to tan as well. Better than a $50 concealer any day of the week!</li>
    <li> Bottom line-if you have dry or combination skin, this product will give you the healthy glow you are looking for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Powder bronzers do not sit well on my skin, but this absorbs well and stays on all day.  I use it alone or over a lightweight foundation.  I exfoliate my face often so this product helps bring my complexion in line with the rest of my body.  It only takes a little tinkering to figure out how much to use so that it still looks natural.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found this product in a drug store, and apparently this product is no longer sold in most stores, so I am very happy that Amazon carries it.</li>
    <li> Always loved this shade. They used to have it in a diff pack but I guess it&#x27;s discontinued. Anywho, I am happy with this one.</li>
    <li> Always  bit of a gamble with the color-changing products, but this goes on easily and is fine when used sparingly, as it blends fairly well.</li>
    <li> This bronzer is the best I have ever used!  It takes on your skin&#x27;s tones and makes your skin look as if you are tan.  Doesn&#x27;t look fake if you use it sparingly!</li>
    <li> Not quite the same as the Almay  face brightener sheer shimmer - bronze afterglow, which was always perfect.  This is nice though, a bit orange y, just put on less.</li>
    <li> Great color to wear with black and browns outfits.</li>
    <li> I love that this bronzer adjusts to your skin tone and doesn&#x27;t make you look like you have clown cheeks or a fake tan.</li>
