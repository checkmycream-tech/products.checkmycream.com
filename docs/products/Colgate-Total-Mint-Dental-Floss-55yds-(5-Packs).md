      <li>meets our needs exactly</li>
      <li>I prefer the thicker floss because it cleans between each tooth more thoroughly with just one back &amp; forth motion.</li>
      <li>I love it the only one I found that glides between the teeth</li>
      <li>teeth are really close together and this floss gets right through without difficulty.</li>

      <li>It&#x27;s the only floss that I can get comfortably in between my teeth.</li>
      <li>Like it--sent fast</li>
      <li>but it slides through tight contact points very easy.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t snap, and it&#x27;s much more lubricious than other varieties.</li>
      <li>Very fast shipping and packaged professionally.</li>

      <li>Would highly recommend this.</li>

      <li>Highly recommended.</li>
      <li>I look for a long time until it was on the market in full size dispensers.  </li>
      <li>It never shreds like other cheap flosses.</li>
      <li>thank goodness I was able to find my favorite dental floss..it is impossible to find in a retail store or drug store.&lt;br</li>
      <li>It is widely available in Brazil and Europe, but it is more expensive there plus one needs to schlepp it then back to the US.</li>
      <li>This product is by far the best!!!&lt;br</li>
      <li>This is the only product that I can easily use with my tight teeth.  </li>
      <li>It is thin, yet very strong; I seldom break it.</li>

      <li>&amp; actually it is not too readily available at least where we shop.</li>
      <li>It slid easily between the tight spots in some of my teeth, all without breaking, or even shredding a little bit.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I love Colgate floss.its what you get from the dentist when you get your teeth clean but you can&#x27;t find it in the store.Amazon has it!</li>
    <li> ON TIME DELIVERY AND I AM DELIGHTED</li>
    <li> This is the only dental floss I&#x27;ve ever used that doesn&#x27;t break in your teeth.It&#x27;s very strong and thin enough to get to the tight places.</li>
    <li> LOVE THIS!!!  THE ONLY FLOSS I USE!!!  A BILLION STARS!!!!!</li>
    <li> This is the best dental floss.  Too bad we are reduced to buying it on line at a ridiculous price.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t find this floss in local stores? My hygienist recommended it &amp; offered me a sample size. I like it a lot because it doesn&#x27;t get stuck between my teeth nor does it tear, that&#x27;s my the criteria for a good floss! It&#x27;s not as smooth as the Glide, but feel that it cleans a bit better because of that?</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Received little samples in my goody bag from the dentist but was never able to find it for sale until now. My experience with Johnson &amp; Johnson Reach floss was frustrating because it would shred and break, leaving little pieces of floss stuck between teeth. This product NEVER shreds or breaks and glides without struggling. Is a bit more expensive but I&#x27;m finding that a shorter length will do the job. (You don&#x27;t need to take a really long strand to wrap around fingers to get leverage.) I don&#x27;t anticipate ever going back to Reach, not even to save a few cents. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> Quick delivery and product was as advertised.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Glide (easy to buy in bulk at Costco) for many years. My dentist gave me a sample size of this floss on my last visit. I found that it was easier to use under hard-to-reach places (I have a couple of dental implants now) with less trauma to the gums. Looked for it in my regular drugstores, but could NOT find it. Fortunately, found it right away on Amazon. Now I&#x27;m hooked on it!</li>
    <li> This dental floss cleans your teeth well and the mint flavor is great.  I will continue to use it as long as it is available.</li>
    <li> I have had problems in the past with dental floss breaking, as my teeth are close together.  However, this is the best dental floss.  The only problem is that it is hard to find in stores.  When I purchase it at Amazon, I had to purchase a multi-pac, rather than a two pack.  I have a very large supply of dental floss.</li>
    <li> meets our needs exactly</li>
    <li> What can I say?  This is the only product that I can easily use with my tight teeth.  I had to order a package of 5 because lesser amounts were not available.  This batch of floss will last me a long time.</li>
    <li> Yep, it&#x27;s dental floss and so my review can only be brief. It&#x27;s thin dental floss as opposed to the thicker yarn-type stuff. Like it--sent fast</li>
    <li> I am a self-proclaimed expert in dental floss.  This product is by far the best!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The floss is thin so that it can easily get into tight places between teeth.  It doesn&#x27;t not fray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered it online because I couldn&#x27;t find it in the stores.  I believe I got a sample from my dentist.</li>
    <li> Its my favorite floss I have found. I have really tight teeth so regular floss doesnt cut it. This is the stuff that got me to start flossing.</li>
    <li> My favorite floss, will never use another brand ever again. Its super gentle on your teeth and gums.</li>
    <li> like the floss  good price</li>
    <li> Dentist gave me samples and I loved it.  I look for a long time until it was on the market in full size dispensers.  Not slick like Reach, but still moves well through my very tight teeth.</li>
    <li> For husband because it makes him happy.</li>
    <li> Very smooth and slippery, gets in between very tight teeth better than any other floss I&#x27;ve ever used.</li>
    <li> Good product.  Good price.</li>
    <li> I purchased this floss because my dentist always includes it in the little gift bag at the end of a dental visit.  The Colgate floss from the dentist is slightly thicker than this one, therefore, I was a bit disappointed.  I prefer the thicker floss because it cleans between each tooth more thoroughly with just one back &amp; forth motion. This floss does the job, but I have to maneuver the floss back &amp; forth between my teeth several times to remove the food.  I really like the fact that the floss does not shred.</li>
    <li> This is the only floss that does not break or shred between my teeth.  I have had a difficult time finding it in stores lately.</li>
    <li> My husband thinks this is the best dental floss available &amp; actually it is not too readily available at least where we shop.</li>
    <li> The best floss. Only 1 minus- you can not find in stores .</li>
    <li> Why did Colgate stop making this?  I can&#x27;t find it in any local box store, drug store, or dollar store.  This is strong, doesn&#x27;t shred, glides smoothly, and is not too thick.  I used to get it from my dentist in 500 yard rolls, but that was too good to last.</li>
    <li> This is the only floss that works for me!  I have implants, as well as closely spaced teeth.  This is the only dental floss that gets between my teeth, doesn&#x27;t cut my gums, doesn&#x27;t get stuck, doesn&#x27;t fray or tear  and actually gets the gunk OUT.  Also got as a sample from my dentist and have been hitting him up for more since I can&#x27;t find in stores (and believe me, I have been looking forever)  I have tried every floss on the planet, and this one wins by a mile!</li>
    <li> This floss is great for tight teeth.  It is thin, yet very strong; I seldom break it.</li>
    <li> I originally received this type floss as a sample from my dentist and really liked it.  I then looked at the stores around me and couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere....was so glad to find it on Amazon.  I like it because it&#x27;s very thin and slick and can get between the closest teeth.  Very fast shipping and packaged professionally.</li>
    <li> thank goodness I was able to find my favorite dental floss..it is impossible to find in a retail store or drug store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;hopefully this will last me for a while..it&#x27;s good stuff.</li>
    <li> The Colgate Total Mint Dental Floss was delivered very quickly and it was exactly what I wanted.  I couldn&#x27;t have asked for better services.  Thank you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anne</li>
    <li> I got a sample from my dentist once and it was amazing. It slid easily between the tight spots in some of my teeth, all without breaking, or even shredding a little bit. I looked in store and they didnt have this anywhere. Glad I found it here! This stuff is the best dental floss I have ever used.</li>
    <li> I am a dentist and love this floss! (no one paid me to say this)</li>
    <li> I have been searching stores for this particular Floss with no success in finding it.  My dentist office hands out samples of it but they did not know where to buy it. I like it because it slides easily between teeth and is strong.  I do not have a problem with it breaking while I am flossing with it.</li>
    <li> I have a small mouth and so my teeth are close together and this is the best floss I&#x27;ve ever used to get in the tight spaces without shredding or getting stuck. Had to stock up online because it&#x27;s been discontinued.</li>
    <li> Excellent floss. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I will never use another floss. Gets in tiny crevices easily and cleans thoroughly. Doesn&#x27;t fall apart or feel flimsy.</li>
    <li> I have tried almost all the floss brands. I got a sample of this from my dentist and had to get more!!!&lt;br /&gt;My teeth are really close together and this floss gets right through without difficulty. I think it&#x27;s the best!!!</li>
    <li> First floss I&#x27;ve found that glides easily between my tightly-spaced teeth.  I&#x27;m very happy with this product.</li>
    <li> Not able to find this in stores. Works great on my tight teeth.</li>
    <li> I love this dental floss and I can&#x27;t find it anywhere locally. I hope they haven&#x27;t stopped making it already. This is the same kind my dentist&#x27;s office gives me a sample of each time I go in for cleaning. It&#x27;s the only floss that I can get comfortably in between my teeth.</li>
    <li> This is the one and only dental floss I can use and I am so glad I could buy it here. For a short time it was available at Walmart but not anymore. It is widely available in Brazil and Europe, but it is more expensive there plus one needs to schlepp it then back to the US.</li>
    <li> There&#x27;s a reason why dentists hand this stuff out. It&#x27;s the best floss hands down. It never breaks and it never gets stuck. I have no idea why Colgate doesn&#x27;t sell this stuff in the stores.</li>
    <li> Lots of dental floss so I won&#x27;t have to order it again in the near future. Also Prime free two day shipping to my front door, what more could you ask for? The floss is fairly thin which I wanted so I could floss in between a  couple really tight teeth I have. The flavor is subtle mint and at 55 yards one container has plenty of floss to last two months. By those calculations this order should cover one person for an entire year of daily flossing using just under 3 feet of floss each time.</li>
    <li> My dentist gives a sample of Colgate dental floss at our cleaning appointments.  I like it because it slides between teeth easily and rarely gets stuck.  I have a hard time finding the Colgate floss in local stores so I was happy to find this deal on Amazon.</li>
    <li> ...says it all, really. Can&#x27;t find this in stores...</li>
    <li> Like the other reviewer said, this floss is thin enough that I can actually get it between my teeth!  And it doesn&#x27;t fray or break apart. I too found out about this floss because my dentist gave me a free sample, and I too was unable to get it in local pharmacies and supermarkets, so I recommend ordering it from Amazon.</li>
    <li> Couldn&#x27;t find this in stores, thank you Amazon!  Great shipment of exactly what I needed.  Strong, doesn&#x27;t break.  Best floss I&#x27;ve used.  And I&#x27;ve been trying all different brands.</li>
    <li> This floss is good for people with teeth that are very tight together, but need a little friction to clean in between.</li>
    <li> Very quick delivery!  A+ product... My favorite dental floss, and I can&#x27;t find it in the store any longer... Would highly recommend this.</li>
    <li> Best dental floss money can by. It doesn&#x27;t snap, and it&#x27;s much more lubricious than other varieties.</li>
    <li> I love it the only one I found that glides between the teeth</li>
    <li> Great floss, hard to find in stores for some reason, even right after being given a sample at the dentist&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great.  I have some pretty tight gaps between teeth and other flosses don&#x27;t slide in nearly as easily as this floss.  It never shreds like other cheap flosses.</li>
    <li> My wife loves it. I think it is a little narrow but it slides through tight contact points very easy.</li>
    <li> This floss is like magic.  I can&#x27;t believe it is so thin and does not break.  Easy to maneuver in and out of teeth.  The time it takes me to floss has been reduced by about 20%.  I am not sure if the floss is made out of silk, but it does have the same feel of silk.</li>
