<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I have been using Renewing Eye Cream by Murad for one year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has done everything the product claims.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have seen a dramatic improvement.</li>
    <li> Thick but not greasy and very absorbant. NOT TESTED ON ANIMALS. Does it&#x27;s job perfectly.</li>
    <li> I love this product it worked great for me..but not my friend. She is younger than I am and had different skin issues, but the renewing eye cream worked wonders on her. I mix this with the vitamin c mask for lightening and skin renewal products and am thrilled with immediate results.  The murad website offers resources for specific types of skin aging and also a what is your skin type questionnaire to help you choose what is best for you.  I have used many murad products and have found the kits are a good way to try and see which products best suit me as I have hormonal and aging issues. Do your research and you will find a mix of murad products that should work for you.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only been using it for 2 weeks, nothing yet!</li>
    <li> Much less expensive then in the spa!</li>
    <li> Not rich enough for me, prefer a creamier cream. Probably will not purchase this product again. Do like that it&#x27;s not a jar but a tube dispenser.</li>
    <li> This cream is a must have for me.  Without it, my eyes are puffy in the am. I find the combination of the Murad Vitamin C in the am and this at night helps greatly with fine lines and dark circles around my eyes</li>
    <li> My sister told me that she has been using this product for more than a year.  She noticed that it helps to reduce her eye puffiness.  So I started using this less than a month ago.  I usually have a little bit of eye puffiness in the morning.  I noticed the under eye&#x27;s area looks better now.  However, I do not think it is good in terms of treating wrinkles around the eyes.  Actually, the Murad Intensive Wrinkle Reducer works well with eyes&#x27;s area too.</li>
    <li> delivered on time, it was a gift</li>
    <li> Buying at this quantity saves me a fortune and allows me to use excellent products on a daily basis. Thanks!</li>
    <li> doesn&#x27;t hurt the eyes and makes them look fresh</li>
    <li> I like this product for now. It has a pretty good consistency and seems to keep my eyes looking brighter.</li>
    <li> Love the Murad brand but this eye cream makes my face all sticky. Maybe expired?</li>
    <li> What a great deal!  The product was exactly what I expected and was just as advertised.  I will order this again!</li>
    <li> I love this eye cream . I tried not using when I ran out . Never again I could really notice wrinkles under my eyes after my make up was applied. I am 44 and people often tell me I don&#x27;t look my age. I use several of murad products . It makes a difference .</li>
    <li> murad eye cream is always best</li>
    <li> This my firs purchased Murad purchase and I love it! Large tube of Eye Cream will last me for long time. I just need a amount of the match head to moisture my both eyes. Recommended seller as well-great communication and service.</li>
    <li> Product arrived quickly. Looks and feels like the much smaller quantity I buy from the Murad website. I have been using the renewing eye cream for 2 or 3 years now. It works well with my skin maintaining a more youthful appearance. Love this product.</li>
    <li> Murad Renewing Eye Cream is my favorite eye cream for day and night.  I am so happy it comes in Salon Size.</li>
    <li> The best eye cream ever!</li>
    <li> i love this eye cream! the skin under my eyes has always been dry, even when the rest of my skin is on the oily side. this eye cream is very emollient and with continued use it feels like it has strengthened the skin around my eyes. i have noticed that the crow&#x27;s feet and other fine lines that were starting to develop have been halted and even reversed a little bit. mostly i just like how moisturizing this eye cream is.</li>
    <li> Expected results sooner.  Have not seen what it promised to do.  You can tell when a product works from the first try.</li>
    <li> I love this eye cream.</li>
