### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>, overnight is best</li>
      <li>&amp; I was happy!</li>
      <li>It is wonderful.  </li>
      <li>....this is not the best I have tried!</li>
      <li>This is a great product from a great company with good prices!</li>
      <li>The product is fantastic!  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve had this product for about a month and LOVE IT.  </li>
      <li>Not to sure about this product.</li>
      <li>It works better than stated in the blurb about it.  </li>
      <li>This is a wonderful product, for those of us with regular or occational blemishes that need to go away and disappear.</li>
      <li>It saved my face ! :)</li>
      <li>Dries the pimple upon, but does not irriate it more and seems to keep the site from becoming infected.</li>
      <li>I have pretty good skin....</li>
      <li>Best product I&#x27;ve used for acne and doesnt dry out my face!</li>
      <li>okay perhaps its to light for me</li>
      <li>It goes on easily under your make-up and almost acts as a concealer.</li>
      <li>My acne goes away quickly and it prevents acne well!</li>
      <li>Huge.  </li>
      <li>I use it along with the Rare minerals night treatment &amp; my skin has never felt or looked better.</li>
      <li>Absolutely worth every penny!</li>
      <li>Even if you have to pay full price.</li>
      <li>The company was quick to send me notice of order confirmation and shipping, as well as shipped on the date they said they shipped.  </li>
      <li>It quickly reduces redness as well as speeds healing time.  </li>
      <li>I did not notice a quick fix; even after 5 days.  </li>
      <li>A bit dissapointing, and smells horrible.....a side effect that I would be willing to bare if the results were better!</li>
      <li>Although it does cover a red spot (blemish) well because it is a light powder, and it made me feel better that I had \\&quot;something\\&quot;</li>
      <li>This product clears them right up, even the cystic.</li>
      <li>I have been breaking out there consistently since July leaving scarring.  </li>
      <li>When I make myself pretty, it needs to be covered up.  </li>
      <li>Consistent rash and acne.  </li>
      <li>I have tried many products and this is the only one that works.  </li>
      <li>I do not have a great deal of acne, you can consider it either moderate or perhaps even slightly moderate, moderate light acne, but this products gave me acne and more pimples than I had gotten at my peak in middle school.  </li>
      <li>The only thing I do not like about it is the strong sulfur smell.</li>
      <li>Let me first start by saying that I LOVE Bare Minerals/ Bare Escentuals products.  </li>
      <li>but it really didn&#x27;t see blemishes go away.</li>
      <li>RareMinerals recently changed the packaging from .07oz to .03oz, but didn&#x27;t significantly change the price on the new package.  </li>
      <li>Based on the reviews on this site, it would seem that I am in the minority, but I caution you if you do not have above moderate acne, this may give you even more acne or pimples than you had bargained for.    </li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product.  </li>
      <li>I was very excited to try the Bare Escentuals Rare Minerals Blemish Therapy kit, but I must say that I wasted my time and money on this one.    </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a little more than what I would normally spend</li>
      <li>Then I used it around the large pores and I can really see an actual differnce in the size; shrinking.  </li>
      <li>I was almost ready to call a dermatologist, when I was walking by a Bare Essentuals store and decided to give it a shot.  </li>
      <li>Purchased this hoping it wouldn&#x27;t cause my skin to dry out, like most other blemish meds.  </li>
      <li>I cannot use ANY of the over the counter treatments, even the ones for sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>I have extremely sensitive skin, it reacts to everything.</li>
      <li>They have my complete support from now on for these products.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve struggled for years with adult acne after the birth of my (now 6yo) daughter.</li>
      <li>It offers very little REAL coverage, and really does not make much difference as far as the duration of a blemish.</li>
      <li>I would highly recommend this to anyone, especially if you have extra sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>I love Bare Escentuals, but this product is a huge disappointment!</li>
      <li>It is a little spendy, but completely worth it to me as a dermatologist would have been much more expensive.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m 27 years old and have battled pimples for a long time.  </li>
      <li>I use only Bare Escentuals Make-up.  </li>

<li> I&#x27;m 27 years old and have battled pimples for a long time.  </li>
<li> I use only Bare Escentuals Make-up.  </li>
<li> but it is great for under your makeup and the smell is very faint and not noticeable after a few minutes.</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve been using this since it first came out (at least 2-3 years).</li>
<li> I use their spf 15 foundation, faux tan (instead of warmth or glee) and the mineral veil every single day for the last 5 years.  </li>
<li> This does dry the spot out some but that isbwhatbyou want it to so.  </li>
<li> This powder can turn a little spot invisible and something larger into a barely noticible bump and the whole time, it&#x27;s not making the issue worse.</li>
<li> I was actually worried when the price went down that it was being discontinued.</li>
<li> I have VERY dry sesative skin, some mineral mkp I can use and others burn my skin.  </li>
<li> : shrinks pores in about a week of solid use and shrinks acne spots in about a day and a half      Con: Smells a bit sulfurish since that is the main ingredient and is a little hard to take the smell on your face during the day</li>
<li> I will never use anything other than this product again.  </li>
<li> I had to use other products for that.</li>
<li> but it seems to take a little bit longer to help than other harsher products.</li>
<li> I did notice a slight smell that, I suppose, if you were to put all over your face you may notice it.</li>
<li> It smells a little from the sulfur.  </li>
<li> It has, in the past month of use, also evened out my skin tone slightly.</li>
<li> Everything from creams over the counter, scrubs, washes &amp; lotions, to proactive &amp; other expensive vitamins</li>
<li> I bought this and seriously; within four days it cleared my skin up.  </li>
<li> I don&#x27;t consider myself to have bad skin, few blemishes here, black heads there.  </li>
<li> Using this product certainly without a doubt increase the number and size of the pimples on my face and it made me look and feel terrible.    </li>
<li> and they make it worse.  </li>
<li> While I do not have severe or persistent acne, I have occasional nasty breakouts.</li>
<li> Shipping charges were outrageous for the small, lightweight package I received.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m sick of it.  </li>
<li> A bit disappointed.  </li>
<li> I hate acne.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I am 56 &amp; NOW I am breaking out.  Almost never did in my teens and 20&#x27;s.  I have tried the acne spot treatments, etc and they make it worse.  I have VERY dry sesative skin, some mineral mkp I can use and others burn my skin.  This does dry the spot out some but that isbwhatbyou want it to so.  Dries the pimple upon, but does not irriate it more and seems to keep the site from becoming infected.</li>
    <li> this product does seems to take some redness out, but it has a smell to it that i just can&#x27;t place. I recommend that you use this product at night.</li>
    <li> Absolutely worth every penny! Even if you have to pay full price. I have extremely sensitive skin, it reacts to everything. I cannot use ANY of the over the counter treatments, even the ones for sensitive skin. While I do not have severe or persistent acne, I have occasional nasty breakouts. This product clears them right up, even the cystic. I noticed an overnight difference in redness and size, and by day two they were all but gone. It has, in the past month of use, also evened out my skin tone slightly. I did notice a slight smell that, I suppose, if you were to put all over your face you may notice it. I would highly recommend this to anyone, especially if you have extra sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I use only Bare Escentuals Make-up.  Over the summer I used epil-stop on the peach fuzz on my chin area.  Big mistake.  Huge.  I have been breaking out there consistently since July leaving scarring.  Consistent rash and acne.  I bought this and seriously; within four days it cleared my skin up.  Then I used it around the large pores and I can really see an actual differnce in the size; shrinking.  It smells a little from the sulfur.  I highly recommend this product.  It saved my face ! :)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve struggled for years with adult acne after the birth of my (now 6yo) daughter. Everything from creams over the counter, scrubs, washes &amp; lotions, to proactive &amp; other expensive vitamins, NOTHING has worked ecxcept this product. I use it along with the Rare minerals night treatment &amp; my skin has never felt or looked better.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful product, for those of us with regular or occational blemishes that need to go away and disappear.</li>
    <li> The product is fantastic!  It works better than stated in the blurb about it.  It quickly reduces redness as well as speeds healing time.  I am 39 and have oily/delicate skin that is prone to the occasional, deep blemish.  I will never use anything other than this product again.  It is wonderful.  You can use it without foundation or powder and it does not show.  The company was quick to send me notice of order confirmation and shipping, as well as shipped on the date they said they shipped.  They have my complete support from now on for these products.</li>
    <li> Let me first start by saying that I LOVE Bare Minerals/ Bare Escentuals products.  I use their spf 15 foundation, faux tan (instead of warmth or glee) and the mineral veil every single day for the last 5 years.  I was very excited to try the Bare Escentuals Rare Minerals Blemish Therapy kit, but I must say that I wasted my time and money on this one.

I love Bare Escentuals, but this product is a huge disappointment!</li>
    <li> Not to sure about this product. I covers okay perhaps its to light for me but it really didn&#x27;t see blemishes go away. I had to use other products for that.</li>
    <li> My wife and kids use the belmish therapy on a daily basis. RareMinerals recently changed the packaging from .07oz to .03oz, but didn&#x27;t significantly change the price on the new package.  Needless to say, it&#x27;s a much better deal to buy the .07oz package if you can find it.</li>
    <li> I hate acne.  I&#x27;m sick of it.  When I make myself pretty, it needs to be covered up.  This powder can turn a little spot invisible and something larger into a barely noticible bump and the whole time, it&#x27;s not making the issue worse.</li>
    <li> Pro: shrinks pores in about a week of solid use and shrinks acne spots in about a day and a half      Con: Smells a bit sulfurish since that is the main ingredient and is a little hard to take the smell on your face during the day, overnight is best</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t consider myself to have bad skin, few blemishes here, black heads there.  I started using this and I noticed no difference in my pore size or clearness.  Does not work, its a gimmick.</li>
    <li> This is a great product from a great company with good prices! My acne goes away quickly and it prevents acne well! Best product I&#x27;ve used for acne and doesnt dry out my face!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 27 years old and have battled pimples for a long time.  I&#x27;ve had this product for about a month and LOVE IT.  I have tried many products and this is the only one that works.  It reduces a pimple overnight and the powder even acts like a concealer.  It&#x27;s a little more than what I would normally spend but I&#x27;ll never use anything else.</li>
    <li> Purchased this hoping it wouldn&#x27;t cause my skin to dry out, like most other blemish meds.  It did not &amp; I was happy!</li>
    <li> ....this is not the best I have tried! It offers very little REAL coverage, and really does not make much difference as far as the duration of a blemish. I have pretty good skin....during my cycle I get one or 2 blemishes and bought this to help. A bit dissapointing, and smells horrible.....a side effect that I would be willing to bare if the results were better!</li>
    <li> A bit disappointed.  Although it does cover a red spot (blemish) well because it is a light powder, and it made me feel better that I had \\&quot;something\\&quot; bareMineral on the blemish during the day...I did not notice a quick fix; even after 5 days.  Went back to using Tea Tree Oil at night.  Shipping charges were outrageous for the small, lightweight package I received.</li>
    <li> this product works well, it&#x27;s no miracle cure but it is great for under your makeup and the smell is very faint and not noticeable after a few minutes.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t think it actually worked. It also smelled a bit like sulfur.</li>
    <li> It goes on easily under your make-up and almost acts as a concealer. The only thing I do not like about it is the strong sulfur smell. It is even stronger than the sulfur treatment from proactiv. It seems to help my blemishs. It is not over drying but it seems to take a little bit longer to help than other harsher products. Overall I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this since it first came out (at least 2-3 years). I never want to be without this product. In my experience it works beyond belief on blemishes, spots, redness, hives, keratosis....practically everything. I&#x27;d bathe in it if I could. I was actually worried when the price went down that it was being discontinued. This product used to be $28!![[ASIN:B0014WJO96 RareMineralsTM Blemish Therapy]].</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve battled breakouts constantly since having kids. I&#x27;ve tried everything with no help. I was almost ready to call a dermatologist, when I was walking by a Bare Essentuals store and decided to give it a shot.  I bought it on a Thursday, and now on Monday my face is clearer than it has been in YEARS! I use it in the morning and at night, and the smell doesn&#x27;t bother me.  It is a little spendy, but completely worth it to me as a dermatologist would have been much more expensive.</li>
