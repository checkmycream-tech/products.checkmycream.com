      <li>well what more can i say its a pipe cleaner that works good price</li>
      <li>Nice product, but you need to pay attention to the description.</li>
      <li>I love this product and keep buying them if I need them because they work well cleaning my pipe!&lt;br</li>
      <li>My grandfather really enjoyed getting these at such a great price!!</li>
      <li>and they do the job just as good as the hard bristles, dip them in alcohol for best results.</li>
      <li>Thanks good quality aaaa</li>
      <li>Thought these would be softer, but they&#x27;re fine.  </li>
      <li>Randy&#x27;s pipe cleaners are an easy and inexpensive way to clean the nooks and crannies of a pet water fountain.</li>
      <li>Very useful in cleaning my sewing machine.</li>
      <li>Thank you so much! :)</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve also started using them to clean out the drinking slots in travel coffee cups (I drink my coffee with milk).</li>
      <li>I use these to clean my bong.</li>
      <li>Needed to clean out the O2 cannulr I use every day.</li>
      <li>Pipe cleaners, rubbing alcohol (90%+ minimum alcohol content), and table salt are all you need to clean ANY GLASS OR PLASTIC SMOKING DEVICE (bongs, pipes, steamrollers, bubblers, sneak-a-tokes, etc).</li>
      <li>Nothing special.</li>
      <li>This are nice and soft, but strong enough that they don&#x27;t bend too easily</li>
      <li>its perfect for getting into small areas of pipes, vaporizers to clean, the soft bristles dont prick your fingers which is a plus</li>
      <li>This time being the first I&#x27;ve done this, these Soft Bristle ones really did the job much better than I</li>
      <li>Perfect size to reach down inside all the tiny crevices below the bobbin holder and the soft bristles grab the dust and pull it right out.</li>
      <li>Bought both hard and soft to save shipping, neither are ideal for me.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall, these pipe cleaners really met my needs and would be recommended for computer cleaning purposes.</li>
      <li>Very dank.</li>
      <li>Maybe fine for crafts and other uses?</li>
      <li>I found that cleaners with hard scubbers embedded with thye cotton material holds up better.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Some bits of the soft material did come off from them, but that didn&#x27;t turn out to be a problem in my case.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Just pour maybe a quarter cup of salt down the neck of the piece, then fill approx 2/3 full with rubbing alcohol, then shake like your life depended on it.</li>
      <li>It was appropriately soft enough to apply the polish without scratching the plastic.</li>

    <li> I bought these for gun cleaning. They tend to disintegrate and leave bits and pieces behind in tight spots. Not very satisfactory for my purposes.   Maybe fine for crafts and other uses?</li>
    <li> Thought these would be softer, but they&#x27;re fine.  I bought them for cleaning lint from my sewing machine.</li>
    <li> We purchased these to apply polish to the inside of pinewood derby wheels. It was appropriately soft enough to apply the polish without scratching the plastic.</li>
    <li> Material pulls away from pipe cleaner complicating cleaning of the pipe. Useable but not the best. I found that cleaners with hard scubbers embedded with thye cotton material holds up better.</li>
    <li> I wish Amazon would state country of origin.  This is China made crap.  I would not buy it again, nor recommend it.</li>
    <li> I use these to clean my bong. The soft bristles are hard enough to remove stuck on resin, but soft enough to not scratch or haze the glass. Pipe cleaners, rubbing alcohol (90%+ minimum alcohol content), and table salt are all you need to clean ANY GLASS OR PLASTIC SMOKING DEVICE (bongs, pipes, steamrollers, bubblers, sneak-a-tokes, etc). Just pour maybe a quarter cup of salt down the neck of the piece, then fill approx 2/3 full with rubbing alcohol, then shake like your life depended on it. Guaranteed. Very dank.</li>
    <li> Randy&#x27;s pipe cleaners are an easy and inexpensive way to clean the nooks and crannies of a pet water fountain. I also like the fact that they are disposable, so you will not have a funky brush laying around to use time and time again.  I do not need to add funky brushes to my list of items to store in my household.  With this item, you use it and dispose it.  It works great!</li>
    <li> I will use these as movable candle wicks and have found that they work great. very good product for a good price.</li>
    <li> Great price! Great product! My grandfather really enjoyed getting these at such a great price!! Thank you so much! :)</li>
    <li> I have a PAX by PLOOME.  If you know what that is, then you&#x27;ll value this opinon:  its great.  Buy them, the value is good - and - there pipe cleaners!</li>
    <li> Nice product, but you need to pay attention to the description. The image shown is for a box of probably around 550 pipe cleaners. The individual bundles contain 44 cleaners. They ship 3 bundles per package (i.e. 3 bundles of 44 &#x3D; 132 cleaners or 1 row from that box). So, if the price quoted on Amazon is $5.40, and you order quantity 1 then you will receive 3 bundles and be billed $16.20. I ordered quantity 2 and was billed over $32 for what amounted to very few cleaners for the money in my opinion.</li>
    <li> I love them, they work great.</li>
    <li> Very useful in cleaning my sewing machine. Perfect size to reach down inside all the tiny crevices below the bobbin holder and the soft bristles grab the dust and pull it right out. Perfect!</li>
    <li> Needed to clean out the O2 cannulr I use every day.</li>
    <li> Thanks good quality aaaa</li>
    <li> came on time as advertised. product works well what more can i say its a pipe cleaner that works good price</li>
    <li> its perfect for getting into small areas of pipes, vaporizers to clean, the soft bristles dont prick your fingers which is a plus and they do the job just as good as the hard bristles, dip them in alcohol for best results.</li>

    <li> Standard. Buying name brand. Nothing special. Save money if looking for amazing results. Bought both hard and soft to save shipping, neither are ideal for me.</li>
    <li> I love this product and keep buying them if I need them because they work well cleaning my pipe!&lt;br /&gt;  sam jacksonville</li>
    <li> I used these pipe cleaners to remove dust from in between the fins of a CPU cooler. I figured that using pipe cleaners would be the easiest way to get caked-on dust off those things. This time being the first I&#x27;ve done this, these Soft Bristle ones really did the job much better than I anticipated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some bits of the soft material did come off from them, but that didn&#x27;t turn out to be a problem in my case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, these pipe cleaners really met my needs and would be recommended for computer cleaning purposes.</li>
