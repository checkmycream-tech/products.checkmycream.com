      <li>4 days later, still going strong and looks adorable!  </li>
      <li>The package comes with two full sets of decals.</li>
      <li>the tattoos arrived quickly but I bought them for a friend&#x27;s birthday gift</li>

      <li>Didn&#x27;t even last full</li>
      <li>I even put a clear coat over the tops of every finger hoping that the tattoos would stay on longer.</li>
      <li>Then I used a clear coat over all when done.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m in the medical field &amp; they did not withstand my normal hand washing</li>
      <li>I chose this rating because after I put the Steelers nail tattoos on not a single one stayed on all day.</li>
      <li>Not bad for the money but hard to put on the nails.</li>
      <li>The first time, it was rubbed off by the next morning, so it lasted less then 12 hours.</li>
      <li>The tattoos didn&#x27;t show very well over the black polish.</li>

    <li> Was not happy with them at all....I&#x27;m in the medical field &amp; they did not withstand my normal hand washing</li>
    <li> Stocking stuffer for wife.  Great for a female Steeler fan!</li>
    <li> This was loved very much by my daughter whom I bought them for, and they worked very well and were easy to use.</li>
    <li> I placed one small Steelers logo on each of my big toenails on Sunday.  I used a yellow nail polish underneath.  Then I used a clear coat over all when done.  4 days later, still going strong and looks adorable!  I wish I could put a picture with my review.</li>
    <li> Just a waste of money, never did use them.  Bought for a special occasion and was totally disappointed with them.</li>
    <li> My girlfriend loves it BUT it doesn&#x27;t last long as we thought</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t had a chance to use these yet since I&#x27;m waiting for football season but I have purchased from this company before and they look great and are easy to apply.</li>
    <li> bought these for my daughter in law she loved them as soon as theycame in she wanted to put them on</li>
    <li> These didn&#x27;t work. My 10 year old daughter was not able to get them on her nails. They were just very small hard to handle sticks.</li>
    <li> This was a gift for a coworker. She absolutly loved them as she is a HARDCORE STEELERS FAN! It came in other team themes however. fun gift idea for those football fans!</li>
    <li> There&#x27;s nothing like being a Steeler&#x27;s fan.  These are a great way to show support without being over the top.  It&#x27;s great for the working woman when paired with a french manicure.  They are a little difficult to put on only because they are smaller.  Positioning is also a little difficult due to the size, but it&#x27;s going on your nail so it has to be small.  I would buy these again every season!</li>
    <li> I painted my nail steelers colors...which are BLACK and YELLOW. The tattoos didn&#x27;t show very well over the black polish. Okay for clear nails I guess.</li>
    <li> Do not like these they don&#x27;t stick to nail a total waste of money</li>
    <li> the tattoos arrived quickly but I bought them for a friend&#x27;s birthday gift so I don&#x27;t know how well they work or if they work at all, but I sure hope they do!!!</li>
    <li> Daughter really liked.</li>
    <li> Not bad for the money but hard to put on the nails. Goes on the skin nicely.</li>
    <li> I have not used them yet.  I forgot to take them with me on the &amp;#34;Steeler Cruise&amp;#34;.  I think that the shipping &amp; handling charge for this&lt;br /&gt;item was excessive.</li>
    <li> I bought these for a Christmas gift so the person hasn&#x27;t had a chance to use them yet. What I can see from the packaging they look like they are good quality and will be enjoyed by the nfl fan they were bought for.</li>
    <li> I was really excited about these and very disappointed. I suppose it&#x27;s my fault for not realizing that these are tattoos, not stickers, the type you apply with a washcloth. I painted every finger except for my ring finger black and painted my ring finger yellow. I applied the tattoo on top of the yellow nails. The first time, it was rubbed off by the next morning, so it lasted less then 12 hours. The second time, I put clear nail polish on top and it stayed on for a couple of days- no problem, except that these tattoos will NOT go on without getting wrinkled or breaking! It&#x27;s too bad that these are not nail stickers, because they would be a much better product. Next time I want to do my nails, I&#x27;m going to have gel nails with a Steelers logo put on at a nail salon instead. After the cost of shipping, it&#x27;ll only cost a couple dollars more.</li>
    <li> Product didn&#x27;t even last an hour. My girls put on their finger  and within an hour they fell off. Didn&#x27;t even last full game.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t buy this product</li>
    <li> These are Very cute!  The package comes with two full sets of decals. I received them very quickly in the mail.</li>
    <li> Works Perfectly!! Not over done.....</li>
    <li> Perfect for my grandaughter who followed her dad&#x27;s lead and is a huge Steeler fan.  She cant&#x27;t wait for next football season to use them.</li>
    <li> I chose this rating because after I put the Steelers nail tattoos on not a single one stayed on all day.I even put a clear coat over the tops of every finger hoping that the tattoos would stay on longer. I would not recommend anybody to buy these, they are a waste of money.</li>
