<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Fifth time ordering it. The price is even better! Loving it everytime!</li>
    <li> Bought this for my mom! She bought this perfume when it came out and it&#x27;s her trademark scent&lt;br /&gt;The smell is amazing and it brings back great memories 💖</li>
    <li> This is my top favorite perfume!! I&#x27;ve been wearing this for years and I&#x27;m glad I can still buy it from Amazon.</li>
    <li> Always been my favorite fragrance I get so many compliments.</li>
    <li> Smells great but doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
    <li> this goes great with my body chemistry. love it love it love it.</li>
    <li> this is my 2nd favorite perfumes j lo did a good job with this one. I loved the way it smells</li>
    <li> I have used this perfume for many years and now its pretty hard to find. So happy to find it on here so I can continue to use my favorite perfume.</li>
    <li> This perfume is flower smell a got a lot of complements every time I use it....I love it it smell sooooooo!!!!!! Good :)</li>
    <li> I only buy this fragrance and any thing with vanilla scent. MOST smells give me a headache so it has to be light. And this is light enough for me and the person I buy it for. Glad to see I can still get it only b/c its no longer in the stores.</li>
    <li> One of my wife&#x27;s favorite perfumes @ an affordable price from Amazon.</li>
    <li> This is one of my favorite scents of all time.  I had to get it as soon as it came out a few years back and I have loved it ever since.  Nowadays, every celebrity has their own scents and they all start smelling the same.  Jlo is one of the originals and I am never disappointed with her fragrances.  I&#x27;ve tried a few others but this is by far the best.  It has a very light, fresh scent.  It doen&#x27;t smell grandmaish like others have stated but that is just my opinion.</li>
    <li> I cannot even remember how many times I&#x27;ve been approached by women of all ages asking for the name of my fragrance.  It is sexy, light, long-lasting and Not over powering or flowery.</li>
    <li> I love this product. The pricing was fair, and also the product arrived in a timely manner. I will for sure return to Amazon to purchase in the future.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a birthday gift for my future daughter-in-law.  It was the PERFECT GIFT!  She absolutely loved it!  AND she thought I was the best ever.  She said I really &#x27;outdid myself&#x27; this year.  She also said it was one of her best birthdays ever - and I had made it happen!  Thank YOU so much for the awesome product at a great price and super fast shipping!</li>
    <li> Timeless perfume. Always have loved it, always will. Great smell, grown. I wish it was never discontinued!</li>
    <li> After all the reviews I was tempted to buy without trying, lucky I didn&#x27;t! After spraying it had a strong bathroom cleanser overtone, after warming up a bit it ended up settling into a smell that I can only describe as \\&quot;old lady\\&quot; or \\&quot;nanna\\&quot; (sorry nanna, I love you really!), not what I expected.  Ended up buying Live Luxe instead which is lovely when it goes on and mellows to a lovely citrusy-sweet fragrance.  Guess it depends on the natural chemicals on your skin, mine just didn&#x27;t mix well with Still.</li>
    <li> This is my moms favorite perfume. I buy her a bottle every year and she falls more in love with it each year. Any concerns about it not smelling the same or being &amp;#34;old&amp;#34; can be put aside. I have now ordered two bottles from Amazon and I don&#x27;t have any complaints. Also the price can&#x27;t be beat when compared to those perfume stores. As far as the actual scent, it is a nice floral scent. I would recommend to those who like floral perfumes.</li>
    <li> I received this today and spritzed it on but.... it does smell kinda grandma-ish.  I can&#x27;t describe the scent.... I want to like it because I just ordered and received Glow and Live which are great!  This is not my kinda scent.  I keep smelling my wrist hoping that somehow the scent will change but ugh.  SORRY!  I should just spray the air and walk into it instead of direct spraying it.</li>
    <li> I so love this scent to me this is the best scent out of all J-lo perfume it last all day long and for a great price</li>
    <li> Great price,not easy to find in store&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> This was such a good deal. It took a while to get it, but it was worth the wait. The price was unbeatable.</li>
    <li> I bought this perfume for Christmas not knowing how it smelled. Jennifer Lopez&#x27;s perfumes are usually light smelling and beautiful, but this one is too strong and smells like an old folk&#x27;s home blew up. Everywhere.</li>
    <li> Great!  The scent is  one you fall for and keep on buying . Nothing else needs to be said. Just great.</li>
    <li> This has been the only JLO scent i have ever owned, and im in love with it! its kinda hard to describe, but it does not smell old-ladyish. it smells wonderful, the best in her collection by FAR!!!</li>
    <li> Love this scent. I couldn&#x27;t find this perfume anywhere .</li>
    <li> This was a great price for this perfume. It is a hard to find item. I have paid as much as $60 for the same size at perfume island in the mall</li>
    <li> Not the real fragrance! Does not last.</li>
    <li> smells so good stays in forever I love the smell I always buy it pricey but its so good .</li>
    <li> Bought this for my wife, smells like roses.  Awesome!</li>
    <li> My most favorite scent by Jennifer. You won&#x27;t be dissapointed with this. I received an undamaged product and it is THE REAL THING. The smell is unbelievably sexy and like no other. Fast shipping by a great seller. I highly recommend this for your &amp;#34;romantic and cuddling moments&amp;#34; with your significant other; just don&#x27;t bath yourself in it. It&#x27;s a magnificent and powerful scent. Look up Jennifer&#x27;s other scents, you will LOVE.</li>
    <li> I got this gift for my sister for Christmas..she luvvvvved it!!! sprays on strong and then gets light...very soft and pleasant smell; but remember every perfume smells different on every person!</li>
    <li> Very nice fragrance for day or evening wear.  I will purchase again.  It was perfect for her, evn during her pregnancy where she has been easily triggered to...well you know.</li>
    <li> It was very good thank you...</li>
    <li> Love it thank you😉☺️😊</li>
    <li> I think it was a good gift</li>
    <li> I was a little skeptic when ordering it cuz I thought maybe it was a scam but arrived on time and its not fake or imitation. Ive been buying this perfume from others for double the price, so I totally love the price!!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t usually write reviews on Amazon anymore since it seems many who read them view them as a chance to start an online bash fast if the review given doesn&#x27;t agree with their own personal opinion of the product...but, I wish I had paid better attention to the not so positive reviews of this perfume before adding it to my wish list.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, I put this on my Amazon wish list because I love Glow by J.Lo and since this got so many great reviews, I stupidly assumed I would love this one too. Like other reviewers have stated, it does smell a bit &amp;#34;grandma-ish,&amp;#34; for lack of a better description. When I first sprayed it, it just smelled cheap.After mixing with my own chemistry, it&#x27;s just ok, nothing special. At least it fades enough so that I am not one of those women strangling others near me with overpowering perfume. I have learned my lesson to first try a perfume before buying or putting on a wish list!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As with any perfume, it&#x27;s all about how it mixes with your own chemistry, so just be sure to try this one out first to make sure it&#x27;s a good fit for you.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately, for the first time I must rate negatively a product purchased from Amazon LLC. The inner package came completely damaged (actually torn and the liquid was leaking). It is unacceptable.</li>
    <li> My body temp usually \\&quot;burns\\&quot; most cologne/perfume.  At some point I can both smell the perfume and sometimes can taste it (have no idea why...).  So I tend to stick to body sprays from the likes of Bath &amp; Bodyworks.  A girlfriend of mine gifted this scent to me--claiming it to be too light for her.  It&#x27;s perfect for me.  I get a lot of compliments when I wear it.  Usually, someone will say, \\&quot;whoever smells citrusy--you smell really good!\\&quot;  It&#x27;s a strong enough scent for others to catch a whiff of it, but soft enough so that I don&#x27;t smell it unless I really sniff for it.  I&#x27;m on my second bottle now since I wear it on a near daily basis.  It&#x27;s definitely my go-to scent from now on.  I really appreciate that it is very pretty inexpensive.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite and is usually difficult for me to find it. The price to me is perfect for this and the bottle is huge compared to others. I love this fragrance. If you are looking for something that has a sweet smell this is for you.</li>
    <li> It smells good.  I was not sure what to expect because I had never smelled this fragrance before.  I bought it because of the reviews.</li>
    <li> Very nice and bigger then thought.  Very very light smell.  It came on time and well packaged.</li>
    <li> Perfectly as described, good product and fast shipping.</li>
    <li> This is the first J-Lo perfume that I have actually liked. It smells nice and flowery. The writing on the bottle is backwards though. I don&#x27;t get that....</li>
    <li> Smells amazingly fresh and clean. Great price, great product.</li>
    <li> One of my fav jams off her 3rd LP/ and the.fragance of STILL is soo romantic.On my skin,its a soft but lasting scent/and it smells like evening time.The bottle is sassy like Ms.Lopez.I love it!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my class reunion. I had many people comment on how fresh and light it smells. My husband loves it! It has become my \\&quot;go to\\&quot; fragrance.</li>
    <li> Was a gift, my nieces loves it</li>
    <li> I ordered this without even knowing what it smelled like. I wanted a less flowery smelling perfume and that&#x27;s what I got! It&#x27;s a great price for a large bottle of very nice smelling perfume.</li>
    <li> My wife loves this particular scent and it was cheaper to buy on Amazon. That s a win- win!</li>
    <li> This is a great perfume. I&#x27;ve always loved Jenifer Lopez&#x27;s perfumes because they are really good quality perfumes. This one is no exception.</li>
    <li> the best and long lasting sent</li>
    <li> I absolutely liked the scent! I was skeptical because sometimes celebrity fragrances can be too sweet which I love but are too overpowering. This is a nice balance of floral and classy. Once it settles it is quite nice and subtle. Can see me using it everyday as a casual scent for work! Excellent service, product, and packaging. Would highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Covers up the smell of pot perfect. Thank you jlo!!</li>
    <li> This is my signature scent and I&#x27;ve been wearing it for years. But it&#x27;s hard to track down a bottle, and then it&#x27;s hard to find one reasonably priced. Amazon has both! I get to smell great for half the price; it&#x27;s an awesome deal.</li>
    <li> Got my favorite perfume really cheap and really fast! No complains at all! It is a good deal! Love it!</li>
    <li> Luv the bold smell so good....been wearin this for so many years .....u cant beat this smell it last all day ...n ppl ask me wat am i wearin...i tell dem&amp;#34; sill &amp;#34; by jlo.</li>
    <li> Love the smell of this perfume. Receive lots of compliments!</li>
    <li> Arrived on time, smells great! Will buy again!</li>
    <li> Bought this for my sister as a gift for her birthday since she is in love with this scent and she was very happy, price was perfect and was shipped fast.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s my wife&#x27;s favorite perfume but I can find it here online for a better price than I can at stores.  When I can find it, it&#x27;s twice as high to buy in a department store than it is here.</li>
    <li> i bought this for my mom and she loved it. She said it smelled like a store perfume.And that it was a great deal and that she would buy more.</li>
    <li> Still by Jennifer Lopez is great. I love it so much I brought it as a gift for one of my friends. The delivery was great as well</li>
    <li> I loved the size and price of this, as this was a gift.  Friend was delighted with it, along with her other 2 gifts.</li>
    <li> Well worth any money spent. Love this perfume it makes me smell sexy</li>
    <li> This perfume is one of my favorites. I get compliments from random strangers about how good it smells. The price was just right.</li>
    <li> Oh Lord I bouht this perfume and I&#x27;m so happy, it is original and smell veryyyyy well. I love it.</li>
    <li> The smell is unique and so pleasant. I get compliments everywhere I go, and get numerous people asking what I&#x27;m wearing. I have and always will love this fragrance. JLO Glow is nice also, but Still is my fav.</li>
    <li> This is just the best scent ever made. I&#x27;ve tried many perfumes (I used to work at a high end dept store), but nothing compares to this. I&#x27;ve had more compliments than I can count, but the best, and most telling, of all would be my 1st date with my boyfriend. That night he said over and over \\&quot; you just smell so good\\&quot;. That was more than 4 years ago, and he still says the same thing. Not old smelling, not too strong.  Just slightly sweet, clean, fresh, and light. Lasts all day. I still smile when I lay my head on my pillow after a long day at work and home, and get that hint of freshness still in my hair. It&#x27;s amazing. No words can describe. If Jenny from the block is reading this, PLEASE never stop making this. It&#x27;s my signature and I&#x27;ve found nothing that even compares!!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been so curious about this perfume for so many years! The shipping was super quick--I received it within 2 days of ordering! I got a genuinely-factory sealed perfume box, and a beautiful 3.4oz bottle of the actual perfume! The smell is amazing! It is very fresh, a touch of citrus, slightly flowery, and has a floating scent of tea! Still is so feminine &amp; so unique! I love it! I am so excited about this purchase! I am so glad I was able to get such a deal on the 3.4oz, because I am obsessed! JLo&#x27;s perfumes have always been one of my most favorites! The scent lasts! I highly recommend this product! I included my personal photo as proof of how excited I am about this perfume!</li>
    <li> JLo Still should not be underestimated. This perfume was my signature scent when I lived in London and I can&#x27;t wear it without feeling absolutely happy and sexy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This perfume used to cost me $60 for a small bottle. I used my previous spray solely for special occassions but now with this 3.4 oz bottle, I can smell sexy all day, e&#x27;ry day!  I may slowly purchase more to ensure I&#x27;m stocked up for life. Would hate to lose this scent.</li>
    <li> &amp;#60;3&amp;#60;3&amp;#60;3&amp;#60;3I will never get tired of this scent! This is the scent i can use outside and in the office. It is nice that they still continue to sell/make it &amp;#60;3&amp;#60;3&amp;#60;3</li>
    <li> Arrived. Item is as specified. Very good.</li>
    <li> very nice will buy again</li>
    <li> I live this perfume,I get so many compliments, from men and women, they love the smell,and so do I.</li>
    <li> my personal perfume...plus the price was...awesome...love it !&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(I&#x27;m sorry, but...I don&#x27;t know what else to say...I&#x27;ve been using this perfume for...10+ more years...so...addicted ! )</li>
    <li> I love this perfume, great deal on price. I will be purchasing another as soon as I run out of it. thank you</li>
    <li> Love this perfume. So happy I can still get it on Amazon!</li>
    <li> I love this perfume! I had this a couple if years ago and all this time I had no idea its on Amazon.I&#x27;m so happy I can find it easily now! I just received it and it smells so soft and pretty...I really love this scent!</li>
    <li> Love this fragrance. Sad it&#x27;s no longer being made.</li>
    <li> I read the reviews, so I was expecting to really like this fragrance. Took it out of the box and sprayed it on my wrist.....nothing. Could barely smell anything!  Tried it again a day later and I really sprayed it on myself and my clothes....at last....a very nice pleasant scent. Doesn&#x27;t last however, although every now and then I would catch a whiff. I don&#x27;t want to over power anyone with my perfume....but I do expect to smell SOMETHING without having to bathe in this stuff. Maybe I got a bad bottle....but I won&#x27;t buy this again.</li>
    <li> Smells soooo good and the bottle is very beautiful. Next to the original Glow, this is my fave of Jlo&#x27;s. I just read a review on a diff website about a diff perfume that if you put Vaseline on your skin before applying your scent it will last all day and beyond. I want to try this trick bc I don&#x27;t smell this on myself much longer after I spray it.</li>
    <li> Smells like bug spray. I was looking for a light clean scent...this is not it! I tried it for a couple weeks thinking I just had to get used to it but i never did. It always smelled bad and really strong to me.</li>
    <li> I bought this perfume before from macy&#x27;s and the smell would last all day. I got it again from this site and it&#x27;s not original, it kind of smells the same but the smell does not last 30 minutes on...</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok, not what I expected.</li>
    <li> Use this on a daily basis smells so good. I bought it after smelling it on a coworker. Its the perfect combo not too strong and not annoying after a while. I will keep ordering this until I&#x27;m old and grey. My husband loves it and got lots of compliments on it.</li>
    <li> delivery was surprisingly fast.  Although I believe they are authentic, it has an off smell about it...like..old? I don&#x27;t know if that makes sense.  But the smell is definitely off.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite fragrance. Hope they never run out. Don&#x27;t know what I would do if they did. Happy</li>
    <li> My girlfriend loves this and I love her smelling like this.</li>
    <li> Amazingly sweet, light floral scent. I wear it almost daily, &amp; the stone accent on the bottle is also a nice touch.</li>
    <li> Love this perfume! I get so many compliments when I wear it. It makes me feel so sexy yum &amp;#60;3</li>
    <li> This is just the best scent ever made!!!!! OMG i love it.... I&#x27;ve tried many perfumes but nothing compares to this.</li>
    <li> This perfume will stay with u all day when I where it people stop me to ask what  I have on love it</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used it for many years! My husband had bought it for me because he like the fragrance so I have stayed with it.&lt;br /&gt;I have had many compliments on it.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my sister (it&#x27;s her favorite perfume) and she always gets so many compliments about the scent of the perfume and they always ask her what it is.</li>
    <li> This perfume was one of my faves,  and then it disappeared. It was nice to get it back!</li>
    <li> always loved this.. great price</li>
    <li> perfect,came just in time i love it thank you :)</li>
    <li> Great value and quick delivery.</li>
    <li> This is a really good perfume, was a gift for my mom, it is a sweet scent but also fresh  and light, it sticks to my mom really well.</li>
    <li> Soft, nice long lasting fragance. Gets lot&#x27;s of nice remarks &amp;#34;You smell so good &amp;#34; what are you wearing?  Etc.</li>
    <li> ive always loved this scent and im happy to now have the big big bottle since I preserved my 1 oz size for so long.</li>
    <li> Sent in 2 days, love it !!!</li>
    <li> the best smelling perfume ever</li>
    <li> THE BEST PERFUME EVER. I LOVE IT</li>
    <li> I love this perfume and it was a great price for the size. Ffor some reason there were a bunch of delays with the carrier. Finally got it today!😄</li>
    <li> I bought this for my wife, she wore this when we dated in high school, and she was thrilled to get it again. She couldn&#x27;t believe I was able to find it. Great product, outstanding value.  Delivery only took 3 days (it made it before Christmas) with standard shipping. Would definitely recommend this seller.</li>
    <li> I bought it for my daughter.  She loves it and the price is a good value.</li>
    <li> Amazing!!! So many compliments!!! I received so many compliments with this perfume, I suggest this perfume to the ladies, it has light scent that last all day long!!!</li>
    <li> This is one of my all time favorite perfumes which I must say is kind of hard to find now and days at the stores.  It has a very soft smell to it and have gotten many comments about it.  I noticed that the pretty smell doesn&#x27;t last all day like my previous bottle.  But I&#x27;m ok with that.  I still love it and would buy again.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing Still for 7 years and can go longer buy in a store. I like other perfumes but always go back to Still.</li>
    <li> Hard to find but here it is exactly what she wanted!</li>
    <li> I love it and have bought a total of 6.  It stays on you and have a lot people ask me what I am wearing</li>
    <li> I think the one that I bought is fake. I am a loyal user of J LO Still for over a year,the smell usually lasts long on my skin up to 3-4 hours, but this one wears off very quickly. It lasts less than 20 minutes and I have to spray again!! The original perfume usually smells very strong only with one spray, but I have to pray a few times to get the smell. Another thing I noticed is that it is spelled backwards on the bottle.. I am not happy with this. I just want to know whether the one that I got is original or fake.</li>
    <li> Fast delivery and just what I wanted...thanks</li>
    <li> Could not find this anywhere in stores! Loved that you offer large bottles!!! Such a good deal... I bought two!!</li>
    <li> Yes, I love it. Thanks . IS awesome.</li>
    <li> This scent will never get old in my book...I love it.</li>
    <li> This is my signature scent. It was delivered early!</li>
    <li> It is a great Perfume. I love it.</li>
    <li> I love the sent this is surely a good buy</li>
    <li> My favorite perfume at a wonderful price!! I will never pay the high price in a retail store again.</li>
    <li> A fragrance that leaves traces.</li>
    <li> This fragrance is beautiful. Very feminine and pretty. I&#x27;ve had many compliments.&lt;br /&gt;More importantly, I love it.</li>
    <li> Love this perfume!!  Smells warm and sexy.  Wish it lasted a little longer, fades fast.  I wear it all the time and will buy again.</li>
    <li> Grrrreat!!!!! Love this perfume....it&#x27;s seductive n sexxxxy! Came today n opened it up fresh!  I Love Amazon !!!</li>
    <li> This smells wonderful. Warm and cozy, smells like tea. I really like this. I&#x27;m starting to think you can&#x27;t go wrong with JLo&#x27;s fragrances.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite perfume and I could not find it in stores! I thought it was a lost cause but found it here. Thought it a little expensive until I got the bottle it is HUGE!</li>
    <li> My all time favorite perfume.  Jennifer Lopez has not made a scent better than this!  All others seem somewhat cheap, but this scent is awesome!</li>
    <li> This is my daughter&#x27;s favorite perfume and I ordered it for her Birthday. It came on time as promised and was a great price. She loved it.</li>
    <li> I love the smell great..</li>
    <li> Excellent ! You will not be sorry for purchasing this product. Very pleasant smell! The price is very reasonable also.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing this for many years. I had a major allergic reaction after using this particular bottle.</li>
    <li> Love this perfume I was told they stopped making it happy I found it here</li>
    <li> This was the perfect size for the price I paid! What a great value! I will definetlly order again and tell my friends.</li>

    <li> It took a little longer then expected to arrive, being that I am a Prime member. However well worth the wait I am super excited to have this scent in my hands again!</li>

    <li> Love it, scent is romantic and sexy</li>
    <li> This is the best perfume I&#x27;ve ever purchased and I just can&#x27;t get enough of it. Every time I wear it I received just amazing compliments and everyone says it&#x27;s smells so good. I hope they never stop making this perfume because it&#x27;s become my signature fragrances.</li>
    <li> Never had it before and g/f loved it. Not to bad for never smelling it before. Highly recommended for any woman!!</li>
    <li> Got it for my mom and she LOVES it! She gets compliments everywhere about how nice she smells. Got myself one too.</li>

    <li> This is my wife&#x27;s all time favorite</li>
    <li> Always great perfume every time I&#x27;ve ordered JLo&#x27;s still</li>
    <li> Too bad they took it off the market.  J Lo&#x27;s Still is not too strong and has a very pleasant scent.</li>
    <li> thanks it so expensive else where&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;walgreens stopped carring it.  they cost way more anyway.  so pleased.  thanks again.&lt;br /&gt;Jodi</li>
    <li> Great price for the size and packaging was excellent.  It turned to be a good place to go for hard-to-find items.</li>
    <li> Love it!&lt;br /&gt; Wearing it for years an still love the smell!</li>
    <li> Smells GREAT! I love it!</li>
    <li> I have had so many people tell me how good I smell and ask what I am wearing!! It&#x27;s a good everyday parfum, you only need a few sprays and it last all day. I looked for this scent in many department store and I was not able to locate it. Thank goodness for amazon! I would recommend &amp;#34;Still&amp;#34; this to anyone that like a stronger parfum,</li>
    <li> more then met my expectations.</li>
    <li> Love the time of delivery but the product itself was a little dissapointed</li>
    <li> One of my favorite perfumes of all time! Great price!</li>
    <li> Love this perfume and so does everyone else when I were it! I always get compliments on how good I smell. The best part is,is that it lasts all day,compared to others. Nice size bottle at a great price!</li>
    <li> Smells delicious. Very clean scent. Wanted to jump all over the girl I smelled this on. And I&#x27;m a girl...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Strongly suggest</li>
    <li> my fave forever! thanks for the samples. :)</li>
    <li> Love it. Nice perfume at a great price.</li>
    <li> Favorite perfume. Its getting harder to find. I always get compliments and no one can guess what it is. Ive been wearing since I was 16. Im 28 now. Great all year fragance too.</li>
    <li> Real perfume on time happy with order</li>
    <li> Bought for wife, she and I really like it</li>
    <li> This is my go to scent. I am frequently complimented on it. 1 of these usually lasts me more than a year, so I think it is a good value.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been wearing this perfume for 2 years now and I ALWAYS get compliments on it!  Normally I would be sick of a perfume by now but I still love it.  It&#x27;s not overbearing...very nice scent.  Almost daily someone near me says I smell so good.  Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I have enjoyed this scent for 10 years now.  Not too heavy, and smells delicious.  I always get compliments when I wear it.</li>
    <li> I always loved this perfume by J.Lo. It smells great and the bottle is pretty big. I would buy again.</li>
    <li> This perfume arrived SUPER quickly and in perfect condition: in a brand new, unopened box. I was nervous because I had read some reviews from people saying that they had gotten a knock-off or a perfume that didn&#x27;t smell like anything. This perfume smells nice; warm and sweet and lasts all day. I sprayed it this morning at 7am and now at 9:30pm, I still smell it just as strongly as I did 10+ hours ago. The bottle itself is a decent size (especially for the price) and looks very pretty on the vanity.</li>
    <li> This is my favourite parfum, great size, great price, excellent quality ! I couldn´t buy it in free shops so Im happy to buy it here!</li>
    <li> Like most perfume sprays it doesn&#x27;t smell good right when you spray it but a few minutes later and you get the light and pretty fragrance. I am not a perfume wearer except for this one. I find most perfumes to be too strong and overpowering. I really like this scent.</li>
    <li> Great price shipped fast</li>
    <li> I gave this perfume to daughter as a christmas gift and she loved it very much. Happy with the order.</li>
    <li> I will never buy a Jennifer Lopez-perfume, thru Amazon. This is the worse one I bought. I am not happy with it, I lost my money! I would like to return it and you can smell it. It smells very old and really offensive!! Please pass the note to the seller.</li>
    <li> this is my favorite perfume of all time. I love it. Many stores didn&#x27;t carry it, but i&#x27;m glad i found the bigger size here at the price that&#x27;s listed here. i am extremely happy with the purchase. it shipped pretty fast too</li>
    <li> Item arrived as described and is much cheaper than in stores like Macy&#x27;s, Kohl&#x27;s, Perfumania, etc.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this purfume! It has a very light and sensual scent to it. And I have gotten many compliments on this scent. Still is my go to purfume everyday and it never gets old! Do buy it. The delivery was prompt. And packaging was excellent. I will be purchasing from this seller again.</li>
    <li> This was an excellent purchase.</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE this perfume! I&#x27;ve owned J.Lo perfumes in the past (Glow, Miami Glow, Glow After Dark) that I received as gifts and I really cannot stand them! I had all but given up on \\&quot;J.Lo scents\\&quot; until, once again, my Grandmother gave me yet another J.Lo perfume for Christmas.It was Still. That was about 5 years ago. And I STILL love it! I actually ask for it now when I&#x27;m asked for gifts ideas. Lol But, this is NOT your \\&quot;grandmother&#x27;s\\&quot; perfume. It has a nice, sweet &amp; sexy scent..and I&#x27;ve never gotten more comments on a perfume than I have on this one! Both men, and women have commented on it... especially the men! And it&#x27;s like a magnet for them! Beware &amp; enjoy!!  haha ;)</li>
    <li> I have had try 3 others jlo perfumes but this one is the best I recived a lots of compliments</li>
    <li> Love this perfume!! One of my favorites!! Smells great! My go to perfume!! It&#x27;s one of Jennifer Lopez&#x27;s first perfumes and I will buy it as long as they sell it!</li>
    <li> I bought this with some hesitancy, not expecting it to be exactly the same as I&#x27;ve purchased in the stores.  However, I was pleasantly surprised and the size of the bottle was actually larger than I planned on!  Smells the same as what I&#x27;ve bought before, so I&#x27;m very happy.</li>
    <li> This is my FAVORITE perfume!</li>
    <li> I got a lot of compliments from men when I wore this but not my favorite fragrance. As far as amazon goes delivery was on time</li>
    <li> Excellent transaction, really fast delivery - thank you - Love it</li>
    <li> This is my FAVORITE perfume! I always get compliments when i wear it! And you can&#x27;t beat this price! Get one every year! A++</li>
    <li> i love this perfume. i started using it almost 10 years ago then got sad when i could barely find it in stores. so stoked i decided to give in to the internet purchasing. so glad i got it. and it came a day early! woot woot</li>
    <li> I do not normally leave bad feed back in this type of forum I would rather contact the seller first, however there is no where that I have found to do so. THIS is my favorite perfume and this does not have a scent! YOU spray it on and at first it remotely smells like &amp;#34;Still&amp;#34; Which is the only perfume I wear so I know what it is supposed to smell like.. Either this is a bad bottle or this seller ripped me off! I am a bit upset and would love to be able to find out what happened here! I need someone to contact me regarding this purchase I AM NOT ONE BIT HAPPY HERE!!!  VERY disappointed and would like to return this for my money back!! THIS WAS the only thing I had ever gotten on Amazon that was NOT as it was advertised.  Very saddened by this experience........... I want my perfume............ NOT a  bottle of water...............</li>
    <li> Sorry, not my favorite.</li>
    <li> This is a mine and my daughters all time favorite.  Smells great and lasts a very long time.  Beautiful scent.</li>
    <li> I really liked, good price, and smells sooo good!&lt;br /&gt;People usually ask me the name of it ...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ui ui</li>
    <li> Very satisfied and happy with my purchase.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love it !!</li>
    <li> Greaaaaaaat parfume. I love the smell. It&#x27;s soo nice and fresh.</li>
    <li> This one is the least overpowering of the cleb scents. Definleny well worth wearing, not to ment mention trying. Great!</li>
    <li> Smells like Jlo&#x27;s stinky vajayjay</li>
    <li> Smells good. Great price, good amount of perfume.</li>
    <li> I love this soft scent. It is also very long lasting.</li>
    <li> Smells pretty authentic.</li>
    <li> Nice scent, but not loud enough&#x27; or should I say, doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
    <li> I wish they didn&#x27;t stop carrying this stuff in store because it&#x27;s my favorite! Much better than the others (I think).</li>
    <li> We love the smell of this perfume and the price was the best on the internet. It was a great buy.</li>
    <li> i love the smell to this and the order came in on time. great present to give to someone. very nice</li>
    <li> I wanted to love this based on other reviews but I don&#x27;t love it.  I like it but I like  &amp;#34;Glow&amp;#34; much  better.</li>
    <li> I have a habit of falling in love with items that are discontinued. I am very happy i found this perfume. It is my go to scent for daily wear.</li>
    <li> Smell is soft and I cant smell it very often but others do. Highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> it was everything I expected.</li>
    <li> Totally love this smell! I always get compliments when I wear this perfume!</li>
    <li> This has always been my fave perfume.  It smells delightful.  I was impressed with the large size bottle and the low price.  Definitely ordering this again...</li>
    <li> I was hesitant to purchase it because of its low price and because it was one of those &amp;#34;celebrity perfumes&amp;#34;.&lt;br /&gt;Now STILL for Women by JLo is among my favorite everyday wears - delicate sent of flowers with a touch of honey. Very personal and intimate aroma which makes it part of you (not some loudly screaming sent which takes over the whole room and gives everyone a huge headache).&lt;br /&gt;Very happy with my new find! Defiantly recommend it!</li>
    <li> Happy with the purchase</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m satisfied with buying products from this store, recommend and hope to make future purchases of the same, because they are very acceptable and excellent what they sell.</li>
    <li> yes thanks I just love it.</li>
    <li> I truly love this.Thank God Amazon has it and by far less than everyone else..</li>
    <li> Smells great, has a strong smell that will last hours! Im happy</li>
    <li> This is my favorite perfume....great price</li>
    <li> I was so glad to find this product on Amazon. None of our local retailers carry it any longer, but I don&#x27;t know why, I love this fragrance and so does anyone who smell it.  I was really suprised at what a great deal I got!  I was used to paying much more at the store, when I could actually find it.  This is J Lo&#x27;s best in my opinion. Once time a parent in my class asked what smelled so nice, and all my students burst out, it&#x27;s our teacher, she always smells like that!  How is that for a confirmation?</li>
    <li> his was a gift and my sister liked it...was ecstatic because she ran out and needed another</li>
    <li> This is the best smelling perfume ever J. Lo did this right and the preice is fantastic, soooo reasonable. This is much more money in the store.</li>
    <li> I searched for this for so long because for some reason they don&#x27;t sell it in my state.........or at least not in any close by areas. I had purchased it once before years ago when I was living in another state. When I moved, I couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere! Thanks to Amazon, I have found it again. I am so in love and people always ask me what I am wearing. I just tell them &amp;#34;they don&#x27;t sell it in the state&amp;#34; because I don&#x27;t like to smell like everybody else. lol</li>
    <li> I love this perfume, very clean and sofisticated scent!</li>
    <li> I love that it came on time. Its one of my favorite perfumes but i wish I knew at the time that I could have ordered the lotion as well.</li>
    <li> Still a number one favorite</li>
    <li> Love the smell its one of my all time favorite from Jennifer Lopez. It&#x27;s a must have! You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> Ive been wearing this for about 8 yrs. Shortly after it came out. Ive always gotten lots of compliments. Now i cant find it in stores. I tried some Coach. Its nice but my Still is better. Grateful &amp; relived i can get it on-line. Thank you</li>
    <li> I always receive a compliment when wearing this fragrance.</li>
</ol>
