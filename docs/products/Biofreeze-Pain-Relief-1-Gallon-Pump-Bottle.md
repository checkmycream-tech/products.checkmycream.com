    <li> I&#x27;m a long-time user so I purchase by the gallon.  FSA approved....can&#x27;t go wrong.  Having to deal with chronic knee discomfort due to complete loss (and subsequent removal) of cartilage in both knees, this stuff is a god send. Allows me to dramatically reduce the amount of pain medication consumed on a daily basis to close to zero. First exposure to this wonderful product was while i was in the Marine Corps after double knee surgeries.</li>

    <li> As an older, life-long long distance runner, BioFreeze is part of my morning routine before I run.  I could run without it, but why?  I&#x27;m on my first gallon bottle and plan on ordering another when this one gets low.    Ordering in bulk saves me money, also I love the free shipping on Amazon(a gallon bottle is HEAVY).</li>
    <li> I buy this for my mother who has bone cancer. She says it works better than her morphine. This is so much cheaper than buying it from her physician&#x27;s office.</li>
    <li> I feel that the product is defective or old.  There are large lumps (clumps) inside the container that will not desolve.</li>
    <li> BioFreeze in itself is an excellent product, but pricey.  If you use it frequently, this is the way to go as this was the best value for the price.  Delivery was very prompt.  I purchased a 16 oz pump and simply refill from this one gallon container.</li>
    <li> This is the second gallon container that I have purchased.  I use it nearly everyday and it&#x27;s amazing  the relief I get when used.</li>
    <li> This gel works wonders for myself and the rest of my family for sore muscles and aches.</li>
    <li> This product has a special capacity in dealing with pain.  I have used it for years.  I have also shared this product with others, that have pain.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s much better than icy hot or ben gay. Offers relief without the greasiness.&lt;br /&gt;Would suggest to anyone with pain.</li>
    <li> This is a great price on a product that helps my pain more than any other over the counter product, I take numerous pain relievers this helps minimize my dependence on prescriptions.</li>
    <li> THIS RELIEVES MY ARITHRITIC PAIN.  IT IS EASY TO APPLY;  IT DOES NOT SMELL ONCE IT IT MASSAGED IN.  GREAT PRODUCT; WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT.</li>
    <li> Biofreeze is an amazing product.  My husband and I have used it for years and it relieves aches and pain like nothing else we have tried.  You cvan mix a little lotion with it and it goes on very well.  You can also put a little in a styafoam cup and mix with warm water and you have a great ice rub medication.</li>
    <li> Having a lot of arthritis and lower back pain, I look for something to help. Biofreeze helps. The gel is easy to use and immediately soothing. The gallon pump bottle is the most cost effective size for me as I use the product several times a day.</li>
    <li> I have used Biofreeze for years and am so happy with the results I get&lt;br /&gt;from it. I use it daily on my knees and shoulders and the pain goes away&lt;br /&gt;quickly. Biofreeze will always be my favorite pain relief and I will be happy&lt;br /&gt;to recommend it to others.</li>
    <li> Stick with the gel and it will make a difference. The price is great too. The cheapest I have come across. Got it quickly too.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Biofreeze for about 4 years for both muscle and joint pain.  I get excellent pain relief with Biofreeze. I  used this product before and after shoulder replacement surgery, use it today after workouts for sore muscles, and use it daily for low back pain.  I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I take care of a community of religious nuns and we use alot of this product.  It is very effective.  Buying in bulk is the only way to go for us.</li>
