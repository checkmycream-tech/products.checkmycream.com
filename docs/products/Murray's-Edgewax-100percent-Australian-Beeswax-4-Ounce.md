      <li>The best edge control I&#x27;ve used so far.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll be purchasing more for my mom and sister soon.</li>
      <li>Love this</li>

      <li>Ok guiesss!&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
      <li>I absolutely love this stuff.</li>
      <li>This product works like magic.</li>
      <li>I absolutely love it</li>
      <li>Keeps my hair nice and smooth and in place without the tackiness and flakiness of gels.</li>
      <li>and I have to wash my hair more often while using this.</li>
      <li>My favorite edge control</li>
      <li>Does the best job ever of keeping my course edges smooth and in place all day long!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used maximum gel, moose, and other beeswax brands, but none compare to how this product has smoothed all my edges, held them together, and it&#x27;s perfect for defining baby hair.</li>
      <li>but I can&#x27;t imagine it being any better than this, and even if it is as good, it costs more and you get less.  </li>
      <li>COOL &amp;#60;3</li>
      <li>At first when i used this my reverted very quickly and i couldn&#x27;t figure out why.</li>
      <li>Highly recommended, Much Much better than those Pastes or glues...</li>
      <li>but it is easy to use too much with those products.</li>
      <li>It was exactly what I wanted!</li>
      <li>I really like how it makes your hair look smooth, not greasy.</li>
      <li>The hold of this is not as good as i expected</li>
      <li>This pomade is cheap but the hold is nice although not as pliable as other pomades</li>
      <li>Really gets the edges right!</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s mold-able but firm the entire time you&#x27;re enjoying the amazing smell of it as well!</li>
      <li>Then i had the idea of applying gel first then this edgewax</li>
      <li>Thanks!</li>
      <li>This stuff works great, hold my long hair extra kinky hair in place.</li>
      <li>and I have tried many different ones.  </li>
      <li>I finally bought my own jar and it is really easy to use and my hair stays put for a long time.</li>
      <li>This don&#x27;t work for me, I have real nappy hair and don&#x27;t matter how much times I put it on, it&#x27;s not working for me....</li>
      <li>Works very well doesn&#x27;t become sticky.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried many products for course hair, all with just minimal results.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried other edge control products that have more of a pomade feel</li>
      <li>Also if you have thin, fine hair, you should be more carful with this hair stuff.&lt;br /&gt;Cool</li>
      <li>I love the fact that it is a wax, but very flexible when you use a little bit.</li>
      <li>This is pretty much the only edge control that works for me....</li>
      <li>and it did a fantastic job of slicking down my hair.</li>
      <li>but, it will, if you put too much on will leave your hair white.</li>
      <li>Holds my natural hair in place</li>
      <li>The only draw back is if you use to much it turns white after about 14 hours</li>
      <li>Dries immediately, holds hair straighter than anything else short of flat out gel like Eco Styler or something like that, don&#x27;t need to wrap or tie your hair down, and it dries smoothly with no white flakes or cakey look.  </li>
      <li>My hair was not sleek the whole day due to humidity</li>
      <li>Its has no water content, so it doesnt make my naturally curly African American hair curl up after I have straightened it.  </li>

<ol>
    <li> I use this with gorilla snot and my edges are  amazing</li>
    <li> i came home and just put it in my hair and tried a pomp..ehh it does what its supposed to do but if its pomade its missing its shine</li>
    <li> The hold of this is not as good as i expected</li>
    <li> It only has a slight hold for 4C edges, especially if you sweat a lot around your head.</li>
    <li> This don&#x27;t work for me, I have real nappy hair and don&#x27;t matter how much times I put it on, it&#x27;s not working for me....I would try another product</li>
    <li> This pomade is cheap but the hold is nice although not as pliable as other pomades but if you don&#x27;t like to recomb your hair then this should get the job done!</li>
    <li> It does its job well&lt;br /&gt; way to go lil guy lol</li>
    <li> This is a great product.  I really like how it makes your hair look smooth, not greasy.</li>

    <li> Ok guiesss!&lt;br /&gt;This Edgewax works!&lt;br /&gt;- it lays your hair down&lt;br /&gt;- it keeps it there all day...unlike edge control&lt;br /&gt;- it also smells good&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Um... but, it will, if you put too much on will leave your hair white. If you let it build up, WILL stick to your hair like some gel. Also if you have thin, fine hair, you should be more carful with this hair stuff.&lt;br /&gt;Cool? COOL &amp;#60;3</li>
    <li> This stuff slicks down my hair so effortlessly. I paid $3 for this in a store so i would say online it is overpriced. At first when i used this my reverted very quickly and i couldn&#x27;t figure out why. Then i had the idea of applying gel first then this edgewax and it did a fantastic job of slicking down my hair. My hair was not sleek the whole day due to humidity but this did last 5 hours or so. If you apply to much it will leave residue and it can be hard to wash out.</li>

    <li> .&lt;br /&gt;I told to try this by a lady who works in the beauty shop. This stuff works great, hold my long hair extra kinky hair in place. Nothing else can keep my naps down. Lol The only draw back is if you use to much it turns white after about 14 hours and I have to wash my hair more often while using this. Love this I&#x27;m already on my second jar. It holds all the fuzzy hairs in place.</li>
    <li> Works very well doesn&#x27;t become sticky. I absolutely love it</li>
    <li> LOVE Love LOVE this stuff!!! it&#x27;s mold-able but firm the entire time you&#x27;re enjoying the amazing smell of it as well! Highly recommended, Much Much better than those Pastes or glues... Waaaaaay Better!!!!</li>
    <li> Does the best job ever of keeping my course edges smooth and in place all day long! I&#x27;ve tried many products for course hair, all with just minimal results. I tried Murray&#x27;s edge wax just by chance because my regular brand was out of stock. I was thrilled with how Murray&#x27;s kept my hair under control and now I won&#x27;t use anything else!</li>
    <li> good product.  Holds my natural hair in place</li>
    <li> I love this product! It was exactly what I wanted! I&#x27;ll be purchasing more for my mom and sister soon. Thanks!</li>
    <li> My favorite edge control</li>
    <li> Keeps my hair nice and smooth and in place without the tackiness and flakiness of gels.</li>
    <li> Holds my hair. The best edge control I&#x27;ve used so far.</li>
    <li> Best edge control ever.  I&#x27;ve tried Elasta QP, Cream of Nature Argan, Designer Essentials, bought Amla (haven&#x27;t tried it yet) but this is the best thing I&#x27;ve ever used so far.  Dries immediately, holds hair straighter than anything else short of flat out gel like Eco Styler or something like that, don&#x27;t need to wrap or tie your hair down, and it dries smoothly with no white flakes or cakey look.  Plus you get double the amount of a normal sized edge control jar at like the same price (or usually less).  I will still try the Amla but I can&#x27;t imagine it being any better than this, and even if it is as good, it costs more and you get less.  Murray&#x27;s is fabulous - just the best ever.  Hope they never quit making this.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this stuff. No flaking and no white residue. Really gets the edges right!</li>
    <li> I use this to lay my baby hairs and control flyaways. I use VERY little, I&#x27;ve had it for a about a year now and it&#x27;s no where close to being finished. I love the fact that it is a wax, but very flexible when you use a little bit. It gives me the results that gel used to give me, but even better because I don&#x27;t sweat it out. It stays perfect until I brush it out of my hair. And it isn&#x27;t drying on my hair like gel is. The consistency suits my needs. I&#x27;ve tried other edge control products that have more of a pomade feel but it is easy to use too much with those products. I love it ! Got it at walmart. I have 3b hair but I feel like it will work well for anyone. A little goes a long way! Don&#x27;t go slapping this stuff on your hair, it&#x27;s wax !</li>
