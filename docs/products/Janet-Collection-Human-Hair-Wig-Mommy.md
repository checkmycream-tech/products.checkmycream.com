    <li> Great wig... Love it added some pieces to jazz it up...the feel of it is great very stylish...</li>
    <li> I love my mommy wig! I am going to wear this with pride.  Very happy!  Fast shipper! 3 business days!</li>
    <li> Only using for a photoshoot</li>
    <li> I found this wig on a youtuber&#x27;s blog and I thought that&#x27;s perfect for me. I tried it and I loved it and a week later my MOMMY ;) bought one, she loves it too.</li>
    <li> I live this wig so sassy. I get so many compliment , people actually thinks its my natural hair  Thank you so  much</li>
    <li> I love it!!!! It arrived on time and it is a great quality wig.</li>
    <li> Gotta play around with this baby for sure, but once you figure out how to rock it, it works! I would not recommend wearing the finger wave out of the package. I ended up spraying some  &amp;#34;twisted sister&amp;#34; curl activator on it and tousseling the waves. It created a beautiful curl. I might try to re fingerwave this so I can get it jut the way I want it, but once again, if you think it&#x27;s gonna look like the lady one the box... uh uh honey!  its a little hard to part this bevause it looks really fake, so i wouldnt recomment wearing it in a straight style, but if you curl it or spray product on it, fluff the hair around the part and it lools natural enough. The hair is soft and easy to re style. I love this wig and will be wearing it in Vegas for a glam look!</li>
    <li> This is a fantastic wig and I just love the way it looks on me! I&#x27;ve receive countless compliments ranging anywhere from \\&quot;it looks beautiful on you\\&quot; to \\&quot;what are you mixed with?\\&quot; I can&#x27;t wait to order another one!</li>
    <li> Very pretty wig and it looks good on me. I had my hair stylist to sew the wig on my head so it can really look natural. I love it and I went to a 1920&#x27;s wedding in Las Vegas and I got so many compliments and no one ask was it a wig. I guess they assume it was my hair which it was it was on my head (ha ha). I love Janet Collection and I will order again and again because I love their selection.</li>
    <li> Great quality product and super fast shipping! Love my purchase and it came on the exact day that I was in need of a quick hair style!!</li>
    <li> I purchased my Human Hair Mommy Wig - Remy Janet Collection two of them on 12/9/11 and I got it in the mail today 12/14/11.  I had read the reviews from on line and wanted to make my own wording to best fit my order.  I opened the package and of course the wig is flat and you have to take it out and do the styling. I applied my products to get the curly look.  I saw the back part was short but being that I wanted to have the short style this was not a biggy. After the styling and I must say this may take a minute to get the finished product, I was very pleased, it took a minute to get the style in place the end results was a 100% satisfied for me.  I had so many compliments and I was so excited about the style.  I will be purchasing this again. Thanks for a great product, please continue this stle and great service.</li>
    <li> I have a video available on youtube to show what the wig looks like at this link. You can also see other great wigs on my channel. [...]</li>
    <li> This wig is the cutest darn thing I have ever worn; you have to wet it and run your fingers through it to loosen the curl pattern , but it is sooo cute. I would wash it and condition it as you would your hair and allow it to drip dry as this makes it soft and allows the curls to form on their own. It is a very light wig...it did not make me sweat and I wore this when it was burning hot outside. No complaints about the wig! extra cute. Everyone who saw it thought it was my hair... looks realistic.</li>
    <li> Cute very stylish!! I get a Lot of compliments,even though I&#x27;m Beautiful!! It&#x27;s easy to wear and style,Great buy!! love it!!</li>
    <li> Price was great and Fast Delivery!!! When I got it I couldn&#x27;t wait to put it on. This wig is so versatile that everyone who buys it styles it different. The fit is so good even without me using the combs to secure it and it looks like a short haircut and not a wig. I need to buy another one.</li>
    <li> I love it! It&#x27;s easy and I get compliments where ever I go! When you wet the Momny wig you can style it the way you like!</li>
    <li> I really wanted the mommy 2 wig but thats ok and I will restyle it and enjoyed it as well. But it is beautiful too</li>
    <li> I got by wig and as promised it was 100% human hair and it&#x27;s really cute when you wet it and style it however, I found the cap to be a bit small and it felt like it was rising up too much so I haven&#x27;t worn it. I have the synthetic Mommy wig from the Janet Collection and it fits great. If you have a smaller head then I would definitely recommend this wig but if you are like myself and have a somewhat larger head then I would pass on this and opt for the synthetic mommy wig.</li>
    <li> This wig looks like a 27 piece,my sister ask me who did my hair. When I told her it&#x27;s a wig she couldn&#x27;t believe it.I have received many complements .it&#x27;s just a pretty wig only needs a little bit of water to style it.i&#x27;m 36 yrs old and don&#x27;t want to look like i&#x27;m wearing a wig. This does not look like a wig very natural. Perfect for the winter months or when u just don&#x27;t feel like doing ur hair lol....love this wig 5*all the way.</li>
    <li> I love this wig, I wet it, and style it differently than this pic. This is worth the money---love it.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my mom. I recommend the human hair one not the synthetic. there are so many different ways to style this wig with just a little gel and water.</li>
    <li> I purchases this wig after seeing it on YouTube.  Once I loosened the waves, I really loved the look.  My only complaint is that it is too short in the back. Its more of a taper, the wig on YouTube was longer and looked curly in the back.  I have read reviews after purchasing mine and discovered that many people are saying the style changed and the back is not short.  I would have preferred the look that intitally persuaded me to purchased the wig.  But even with the tapered back, it looks great and I have received a lot of compliments.</li>
    <li> Ladies, you must purchase this Mommy wig! I get so many compliments for it. I mean everyone loves the 20&#x27;s/Harlem Nights look I am wearing. After 3 weeks of wearing waves flat is wet it and OMG this wig is giving me life! These curls are so beautiful and looks like it is my hair. I will be stock piling this wig.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this wig , its my actual first wig purchase and it was well worth it ,The wig is light and very soft</li>
    <li> I purchased my 1st mommy wig a year ago and I love it the hair was longer and more wavy not curly the cap was bigger fits larger heads and  no combs and perfect for me. I recently ordered one this year and and it&#x27;s awful shorter hair all over, tappered in the back with a smaller cap which means my hair shows from under the wig, I sent it back the cap was too small for my head. Janet is now making cheaper versions of the original Mommy Wig with shorter hair. So diappointed</li>
    <li> I just received my mommy wig today 8/4/14! I put it on immediately because I wanted to see what everybody was talking about and they wasnt wrong I love this wig. I was on my way out and I wore it right away! Bought my nose ring and cute pair of earrings since I already had it on. I look damn good even at 60 yrs old.!  Thank you to who ever created this wig. I look 20 yrs younger!</li>
    <li> Very happy with order every thing I though it would be. Looks good feel good fits good its all good tks</li>
    <li> I got many compliments on my hair and most thought it was mine HOWEVER  tracks were falling off the the wig the 2nd day i wore it!  Horribly made. I couldn&#x27;t take it anymore took it off after 4 days off wearing it.</li>
    <li> Cute wig, purchased two, thinking I would love it, but may recreate it by adding hair on the top. Fits well, but just a little dry :{</li>
    <li> I love this wig. So easy to style. I just spray it with a little water and finger style. The best wig I&#x27;ve ever purchased. It looks really natural and I get compliments all the time. This is a keeper and I&#x27;ll be ordering another one. I highly recommend this wig if you want a short, sassy, style. It is light and not heavy. It is very durable. I&#x27;ve had mine over a month and I&#x27;ve washed it a few times. It keeps the curls and still looks good.</li>
    <li> This wig was ok, the hair texture was rough, I thought this would&#x27;ve been slightly smoother, I guess not..... Maybe I received a bad one..</li>
    <li> I have many many many wigs and this is one of my favorites. I get compliments and alot of folks think it is my real hair lol. Go for it and try one out.</li>
    <li> THIS WAS A XMAS GIFT FOR MY MOTHER. SHE ABSOLUTELY LOVED THE WIGS. WE LIVE IN DIFFERENT OWNS SO I HAD IT SHIPPED TO HER. I LOVED IT MYSELF!!</li>
    <li> I THOUGHT I DIDNT LIKE IT AT FIRST, BUT THIS IS WHAT YOU GOTTA DO, WET IT JUST A LITTLE BIT, AND RUN YOUR FINGERS THROUGH AND THROUGH IT , PUT IT ON YOUR HEAD AND PLAY WITH IT UNTIL YOU GET THE DESIRED LOOK, I CUT THE SIDES DOWN  AND LEFT THE FRONT AND TOP WITH THE FULL LOOK AND WISH YOU CAN SEE A PIC BECAUSE IT LOOKS AMAZING AND THEN PUT A LITTLE OIL SHEEN ON IT.</li>
    <li> Can style in any way, it&#x27;s great!</li>
    <li> Wife loves it go go Amazon</li>
    <li> I got it because I saw a review on YouTube and loved it. However the wig is a little small for my head. I want to wear it for NYE however im having second thoughts. I will say I sent my bff a picture of me wearing it. She said it looked like my real hair. However my fiance said I loved like Thelma and Lois lol...I will update review once I actually decide if I will wear it out......Update: this wig is EVERYTHING I LOVE IT</li>
    <li> I love this wig.  I get so many compliments.  When it first comes out of the bag it does not look like much but just spray some water on it and style away!.  I also had a stylist shape it up for me so it fits my face more.  Two months later I&#x27;m still rocking it!</li>
    <li> Fast shipping.... Very pleased with the product</li>
    <li> ORDERED IT FOR MY MOM AND SHE LOVES IT. MY BEST FREIND LVES BY IT AND IT LOOKS LIKE HER REAL HAIR.</li>
    <li> I have brought a lot of different types of wigs of all colors and lengths. But this is by far the best one. I received it on time. It is full in body and not thin and fits confortably. It looks so natural i received so many compliments on it. I will defiently order from this buyer again. If you are looking for  a cute every day sassy look buy this wig for twenty something dollars it is a great investment for wig lovers like myself.</li>
    <li> DO NOT TRUST THIS PICTURE! The wig is so soft and effortlessly beautiful. As long as you have ten minutes and a styling product, you should have a great sassy wig in no time.</li>
    <li> This wig is TOO CUTE! Don&#x27;t sleep on her. Although I did&#x27;nt get the free wig cap I saw advertised I will say the shipping was fast.&lt;br /&gt;Thinking about ordering another one...&lt;br /&gt;~SunnyDNfla~</li>
    <li> I LOVE this wig!!!  Eveyone thought it was my real hair ( i pulled some of my real hair out in the front for a more &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; look).  My own husband didnt even know it was a wig! LOL!  The only con is that it is a bit thin and sheds a bit, but overall I like it.  I&#x27;m thinking of getting another one that is highlighted for the spring/summer.  My friend liked it so much, she got her one too!</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t like it don&#x27;t fit my head it was to big</li>
    <li> My favorite wig!! Love it...ordered it twice</li>
    <li> didn&#x27;t wear it in the summer but for fall its okay</li>
    <li> I love the wig,  I watched some Youtube videos on how to style it and then took it to my hairdresser to fit it to my head and trim. Best wig I have ever purchased and I am going to purchase another one in a different color.  It even came before the estimated shipping date.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s my third one and I love them all!!!! I plan to order another one as the summer approach!! Best wig ever!!!</li>
    <li> I bought this wig for my grandmother in law. She loves it. Nice waves light weight and good hair quality</li>
    <li> I luv the mommy wigs I have numerous  colors ,they run out of #1fast in the beauty shops.so I order this color online,this my second one from here ,,only reason it&#x27;s not a 5 because of the way it shrinks when you wash it</li>
    <li> I love it. Will buy more from this maker</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t worn it yeat but I did put it on and plat with it.  I like it alot</li>
    <li> Love it !!!!!! great for any occasion</li>
    <li> The wigs is perfect for me. I LOVE HER..</li>
    <li> cute cute cute there&#x27;s alot of you tube tutorials on how to play with your human hair wig and make it your own style by just adding a bit of conditioner and a bit of water. this is a very cute wig and reminds me of Hallie Berry&#x27;s hair when she starred in the movie swordfish.</li>
    <li> This company is a rip off.  This wig and was extremely thin and poorly made.  I NEVER wear wigs but bought it because A friend suggested it. Once it arrived and I noticed the quality (has to be really bad if a non wig wearer noticed), I tried it one with a wig cap I purchased and it looked awful.  I had to pay $10 to ship it back.  I received the wig back from BEAUTY PLUS stating it had a &amp;#34;strong odor&amp;#34;. Really!  I NEVER wore this wig and returned it within 7 days...DO NOT DO BUSINESS with BEAUTY PLUS!</li>
    <li> ALL I HAVE TO SAY IS I LOVE THIS THIS WIG IT ARRIVED TODAY I WATCHED A COUPLE OF YOU TUBE VIDEOS TO SEE HOW TO STYLE AND IT WAS ON FROM THERE&lt;br /&gt;THIS IS THE MOST ABSOLUTE LOVELY WIG LADIES IF YOU NEED A SHORT SASSY STYLE FOR THE SUMMER THIS IS THE WIG FOR YOU I GIVE THIS WIG SIX STARS</li>
    <li> rough, hard to manage</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m happy with my purchase the wig was exactly what I expected. I washed it and it curled up really cute. You just put it on and go. The company shipped it fast. I will definitely order more from this company.</li>
    <li> I ordered my mommy wig on 6/28/12 at 8pm central time and it arrived at 10am on 7/2/2012. The quality of the hair is great 100% Human Hair (Remy) with adjustable straps &amp; combs.</li>
    <li> Omg I love it and ready to order another one in a different style . But I get so many people asking me if it&#x27;s real . I love it plus it&#x27;s my first wig.</li>
    <li> I am not one that usually takes the time to do reviews, but do not waste your time. I ordered a number 1 wig looked brown, wig size was very small, and no return available..... sucks</li>
    <li> So far so good. I just received it so I have no complaints yet. The shipment was faster than expected. I sprayed the wig with water to liven her up and she looks amazing. This wig has saved my life. I had a hair mishap and let&#x27;s just say this wig is going to be my new best friend until my hair grows back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Monica H</li>
    <li> I like it but you only can wear your part on the left side which I hate so done wear it much</li>
    <li> This wig is amazing....soft, natural and lightweight. Strongly recommend it for a quick summer look!! A great investment for wig lovers like myself!!</li>
    <li> Everyone thinks I cut my hair! I was a sceptic at first but once it put it on, I knew it was a keeper. I have bought 2 thinking I would need to replace the 1st one after a month of wearing. I was wrong. I&#x27;m still wearing the same wig after a month. I&#x27;m only giving it 4 stars because the 2nd wig  I bought wasn&#x27;t packaged as good as the 1st one. It&#x27;s easy to shape, I just use water in a spray bottle. There are tons of videos on youtube that give you ideas.</li>
    <li> love the hair its very soft , it doesn&#x27;t make my scalp itch. couldn&#x27;t ask for anything better.</li>
    <li> I got the wig before EDD. I love the way it looks and feels especially for $20. Can&#x27;t beat the price for human hair.</li>
    <li> I purchased this hair &amp;#34;hat&amp;#34; to use in emergencies. Well, you get what you pay for. You&#x27;d have to have a pretty small head for this wig to fit comfortably, and the hair is very thin and close, so it almost appears to have no styling. It feels like maybe a tight scull cap on me and looks about as nice. Someone complained that it was too short in the back but I did not find it so. So, it is in my giveaway pile, as it would cost me to return it. I will probably not purchase another wig online.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not a person that wears wigs.  But this is the most versatile wig ever. I absolutely love this wig and I get so many compliments.  It also stands up to the test of time and still looks great after several washes.</li>
    <li> I LOVE this wig!!!! I took some water and wet it and it curled like my natural hair! easy to maintain I will be buying another one to take with me on a trip and to color it!</li>
    <li> I LITERRALY LOVE THIS WIG.&lt;br /&gt;1. The number 1 is beautiful, I thoughtof getting a 1B so it wouldnt look to dark and fake but im glad i was too scared to do that.&lt;br /&gt;  The number 1 color looks natural its gorgeous after i wet it&lt;br /&gt;2.  The curls you get from wetting it are gorgeous.  I prefer it realy curly and allthaqt means is that u need to wet it, not damp it.&lt;br /&gt;  I have seen someone wear it after damping it and the curls are cute but I prefer a lot of curls.&lt;br /&gt;3.  The fit is great, you have combs in fromnt and back and the adjustable strap in the back&lt;br /&gt;4.  Caring for the wig is a breeze.  I have not had to put any kind of product on it and the SHINE is great.  You can even cut it&lt;br /&gt;  down if you want becaise sometimes i find the sides by the ear to  be a little long but for now i have decided to just scoop&lt;br /&gt;  them behind my ears.&lt;br /&gt;5.  Price is just wonderful  its 100% Remy Human hair so ofcourse with care it will last much longer than synthetic.  I have&lt;br /&gt;  heard&lt;br /&gt;  persons say they bought theirs for $14.00 but even with the increase i think the price is great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS WIG OVE RAND OVER AND OVER AGAIN.</li>
    <li> I rocked this wig for a total of 4 months.  Everyone loved it they really thought it was my hair!</li>
    <li> I wore this wig to church today for the first time. I normally wear my hair very short and flat. Everyone thought I was growing my own hair. This wig is my fav right now, normally I wear the Duby combo. This one received more compliments and I love how feminine it looks. Add hoop earrings and this wig can go from evening to day in a snap. I wet mine and cut some of the length which help tremendously with being able to style amd tame some of the curl and wave pattern. I love, love, love this unit.</li>
    <li> Quality construction with very minimal shedding.  It truly lives up to its reputation.  Look on YouTube for design inspirations. I would highly recommend and will actually be purchasing another one.</li>
    <li> I got this wig for my mom and she love it, she wears it most of the time and gets a lot of compliments.&lt;br /&gt;Her friends want it to.</li>
    <li> This wig is very pretty. It comes flat and fingerwaved but you spray it with water and manipulate the curls with your fingers. Its simply beautiful. Everyone thinks its my hair and can&#x27;t believe it when I tell them its a wig. If you are looking to purchase a natural looking wig, this one, is the one to buy. It has a natural hair line and is very comfortable.. I have purchased 4 in the last year and a half.</li>
    <li> Beautiful , love it But it&#x27;s difficult to restyle it after You wash it. Good for the price. Sassy little wig</li>
    <li> I love the flexibility of this wig. The look is great, classic, and surprising. I&#x27;ve gotten nothing but compliments since the first day I wore it. People actually don&#x27;t realize it&#x27;s a wig! That&#x27;s what I like most. Since the wig is human hair you can treat it as such. The only dislikes are the cap is for someone with a larger head, and I noticed a little shedding occurred after the first washing.</li>
