      <li>Very happy with this product..recommended!!!</li>

      <li>She thinks it might work great for problem areas like elbows, knees, etc.</li>
      <li>Very nice.</li>
      <li>I feel confident that it will be an excellent cold-weather lotion and plan on using it this winter as well.    </li>
      <li>Using the lotion is certainly pleasant.</li>
      <li>/&gt;So over all, works very good, lingers wells, and a very light pleasant scent that would work for men and women.</li>
      <li>This lotion is so good.  </li>

      <li>I love this stuff!</li>
      <li>I really liked this lotion.</li>
      <li>After using the product for a while, I found I really liked it.</li>
      <li>and it remains after a couple of hand washings - which is good because that protects your hands longer than most lotions do.  </li>
      <li>Based on other reviews it probably works best on more severe dryness, but it&#x27;s worked wonderfully for me.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It has a nice texture, very mild and pleasant fragrance.</li>
      <li>lotion has a very pleasant, light, fresh fragrance.  </li>
      <li>The light fragrance is pleasant without being overbearing, and is appropriate for both men and women.</li>
      <li>The ability to store on its lid makes it more efficient to use that a pump dispenser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Actually, Gold Bond Aloe is one the the best out there.  </li>
      <li>will use this more as the winter months approach...</li>
      <li>and I have been extremely pleased with how well it works.</li>
      <li>The light fragrance is pleasant and clean and can be worn alone or with perfume.  </li>
      <li>It is simply okay.</li>
      <li>wife uses it on her hands every night, and now keeps it in her favorite \\&quot;bag of tricks.\\&quot;  </li>
      <li>Why not make it fragrance free, and if people want their own scent, they can take care of it themselves?</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m so glad I can order it here.</li>
      <li>My heels are looking alot better nowadays.</li>
      <li>When I ordered Vaseline Intensive Rescue Clinical Therapy Body Lotion, I hadn&#x27;t realized that my wife was out of her favorite, fruity-smelling skin cream.  </li>
      <li>When I saw that Amazon was offering lotion and skin care items as part of the Vine review program, I was very excited.</li>
      <li>When I saw that Amazon was offering lotion and skin care items , I told my wife and she was very excited.</li>
      <li>This product is wonderful for dry hands, feet...</li>
      <li>it leaves a light film on the skin, however, which, for me, makes it more appropriate for night.</li>
      <li>This lotion is as great as some of the far costlier hand creams and body butters.</li>
      <li>This was a nice smelling, smooth feeling lotion; however, upon my first use it experienced a red, bumpy, itchy rash.  </li>
      <li>As I did with another \\&quot;clinical-strength\\&quot; product -- a deodorant, in that case -- I approached the Vaseline Intensive Rescue Clinical Therapy Body Lotion from the standpoint of someone who didn&#x27;t need it medically, but who could give it a try on the assumption that if strong is good, stronger is better.</li>
      <li>It goes on smoothly and does not leave a greasy film.  </li>
      <li>&quot; then the Vaseline may fit the bill.</li>
      <li>The lotion goes on smoothly and does not leave it oily.</li>
      <li>lightly)</li>
      <li>It does remain on your skin, as you can feel it is silky smooth</li>
      <li>I really liked the dispenser almost as much as the lotion itself.</li>
      <li>It also absorbs easily enough and has a great softening effect even hours after application.&lt;br /&gt;This</li>
      <li>The smell is light and fresh, I love it.</li>
      <li>I normally use lotion from The Body Shop, but I found this to be a refreshing change!  </li>
      <li>For the most dry, cracked and ailing parts of my skin, it felt good going on, healing even.</li>
      <li>I would prefer the lotion to be unscented, but this has a light, pleasant fragrance that smells similar to cocoa butter.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m actually extremely excited about this product.  </li>
      <li>the \\&quot;lightly fragranced\\&quot; and \\&quot;unfragranced\\&quot; versions are scented, which in both cases is mild, pleasant and reminiscent of days on the beach.&lt;br</li>
      <li>This is a great product for dry hands.</li>
      <li>I always need to grab a towel and clean the excess goo from my palms after application.</li>
      <li>Both the \\&quot;lightly fragranced\\&quot; and \\&quot;unfragranced\\&quot; versions are scented, which in both cases is mild, pleasant and reminiscent of days on the beach.     </li>
      <li>We live in a humid climate, but virtually live in air-conditioning, so it worked great.</li>
      <li>This lotion works really well and lives up to the standards that people have trusted for many years.</li>
      <li>Vaseline is a great name in lotions but this latest is nothing out of the ordinary or too exciting.</li>
      <li>I like a clean, fresh smell.  </li>
      <li>It absorbs quickly into the skin.</li>
      <li>is a great product for a busy mom (with a 10 month old baby) like myself.&lt;br</li>
      <li>It absorbs quickly.</li>
      <li>Perhaps they&#x27;ve been in the business so long they&#x27;ve finally worked out an almost perfect formula.</li>
      <li>It was light, not greasy and made my skin smooth and soft!  </li>
      <li>complete absorption, no greasy feel, nice light smell, keeps skin hydrated and soft to touch.</li>
      <li>Everywhere I have used the lotion I can feel a difference which is amazing because I have only had this product for around two weeks.</li>
      <li>If it performs nearly as well in winter as in summer, I&#x27;ll be extremely pleased.</li>
      <li>And I liked that the product wasn&#x27;t totally unfragranced -</li>
      <li>This rich lotion certainly delivers on its promises.</li>
      <li>Very relaxing lotion, very smooth on skin and with a very nice smell that last a long time and not over powering.</li>
      <li>In short, this isn&#x27;t the super skin cure all that you might hope to find in a product four times its size at a half the volume, but it is about the most versatile and pleasant products you&#x27;ll see on the market today.</li>
      <li>The bottle advertises \\&quot;for extremely dry skin\\&quot;...and that is the demographic that will make the most of this unique product.</li>
      <li>The next day was even better.</li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m absolutely in love with this product because it actually works.  </li>
      <li>I highly recommend this item!!</li>
      <li>After using this body lotion for some time, I found that despite its fresh scent this lotion is really sticky and the feeling does not go away.</li>
      <li>Now to really TEST the product!  </li>
      <li>It is light and airy and leaves my skin soft without feeling greasy.</li>
      <li>Having had this product in regular use for a week or more now, however, I&#x27;d probably recommend against using it if you don&#x27;t really need it.&lt;br</li>
      <li>/&gt;That&#x27;s a definite contrast to the easy absorption and clean feeling that comes from my old standby</li>
      <li>I prefer a more elegant formulation that sinks in and leaves only a moist, dewy sensation behind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The bottle advertises \\&quot;for extremely dry skin\\&quot;...and that is the demographic that will make the most of this unique product.ould not be enough to add a useful SPF factor).     </li>
      <li>I found it to be soothing and effective in relieving dry skin, and you can quickly get back to using your hands.</li>
      <li>one product provides a barrier to keep mosture in longer than pure water, it&#x27;s too oily, and stains one&#x27;s clothes.  </li>
      <li>I give it a very high recommendation.</li>
      <li>Highly recommended!</li>
      <li>The scent is light enough to be smelled but does not overwhelm my senses like lotions with a lot of perfume.    </li>
      <li>Not perfumey and really works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The area was much softer.</li>
      <li>this is one snake oil that you can trust, it really works.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Vaseline just threw all the buzz words on this product: Intensive, Rescue, Clinical, Therapy, Lightly Fragranced (key word:</li>
      <li>I would say that this product really is for people with severe-to-dry skin.</li>
      <li>The reason I like this product so much is that it doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin.</li>
      <li>and you have to really work it in to the skin in order to avoid oily residue.  </li>
      <li>The Pros: It really does moisturize and it is non-greasy as stated.</li>
      <li>But, this one doesn&#x27;t take much to work into skin and avoid that oily</li>
      <li>Vaseline moisturizes well enough, and the \\&quot;light fragrance\\&quot; sort of reminded me of coconut-scented suntan lotions.</li>
      <li>it has enough fragrance to leave a reminder of a pleasant bouquet, and not the heavy, lingering fragrance of so many other products you&#x27;ll find today.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s kind of small, so I would keep it in the glove box or a purse if you&#x27;re a lady.  </li>
      <li>But, if you live in a really humid area, the stickiness might bother you.</li>
      <li>Dependable lotion with a decent fragrance.  </li>
      <li>Your skin stays moisturized for hours unlike some lotions where you have to reapply lotion later on because the body absorbs it too quickly.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Those of us with Ezekiel-in-the-desert-bone dry skin have heard it all: \\&quot;intensive\\&quot;, \\&quot;intensive care\\&quot; (as if our derm is to be put on life support, with 24/7 nursing care...although some nights I&#x27;ve wished for that), \\&quot;rescue\\&quot;, \\&quot;therapeutic\\&quot;,\\&quot;cure\\&quot;....nothing you wouldn&#x27;t have heard in Dr. Bob&#x27;s Medicine Show circa 1897 or the odd ladies&#x27; magazine advertisement frome the same era.  In my experience, no body lotion has lived up to those high-end medical sounding names.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If one product provides a barrier to keep mosture in longer than pure water, it&#x27;s too oily, and stains one&#x27;s clothes.  If it meets both the oily/not too oily criteria, a strong fragrance has been added that no doubt pleases someone but irritates sensitive skin and at least three of your closest friends or family members. Or the stuff just doesn&#x27;t work at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Vaseline just threw all the buzz words on this product: Intensive, Rescue, Clinical, Therapy, Lightly Fragranced (key word: lightly) so I was skeptical.  But instantly won over.  Perhaps they&#x27;ve been in the business so long they&#x27;ve finally worked out an almost perfect formula. It&#x27;s fairly thick, but smoothes on easily, not leaving you feeling greasy, and it keeps my elbows, at least, from looking and feeling like pink and white coconut husk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I&#x27;ve never understood why a moisturizer needs fragrance at all, even though this fragrance is indeed hardly noticeable.  Why not make it fragrance free, and if people want their own scent, they can take care of it themselves? Do the vast majority of this market *want* fragrance in their moisturizer?  I&#x27;d really be surprised.</li>
    <li> This lotion is so good.  It isn&#x27;t oily like you would expect vaseline products to be and it actually keeps you moisturized.  The fragrance isn&#x27;t overpowering.  It&#x27;s very light and pleasant.  I recommend this to all my moisture-challenged friends.</li>
    <li> This lotion is as great as some of the far costlier hand creams and body butters. It does not leave my hands sticky nor does it transfer onto things I am holding. It also absorbs easily enough and has a great softening effect even hours after application.&lt;br /&gt;This is a great product for a busy mom (with a 10 month old baby) like myself.&lt;br /&gt;It is a nice sized bottle and it lasts me at least 2 months, though I use it 2 - 3 times / day.&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this wholeheartedly!</li>
    <li> The Vaseline Clinical Therapy Body Lotion is very thick, very rich and very creamy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I received this \\&quot;skin protectant body lotion\\&quot; to test, I was both impressed and appalled with the viscosity of the product. For the most dry, cracked and ailing parts of my skin, it felt good going on, healing even. For the normal majority of my body, the lotion is just too thick to work with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Living in the southwest of the USA, I have dry hands as a rule. I use a lot of lotion several times a day on hands, arms and legs, but the Vaseline Clinical Therapy Body Lotion is still uncomfortably waxy for me. I always need to grab a towel and clean the excess goo from my palms after application. It&#x27;s too bad, in a sense, as I really did want to like this product. I used it for months, in both climates both hot/dry and cold/windy, hoping the lotion would grow on me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried to engage my husband as a tester, as he also is a daily lotion user. He termed the product too rich and \\&quot;greasy\\&quot; and found it hard to rub in. We decided to use the lotion on our somewhat scaly lower legs and be content to wash our hands after use, reapplying another lotion for our dry palms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My sense is that I am not precisely the target market for a formulation subtitled, \\&quot;Intensive Rescue.\\&quot; My skin, while dry and sometimes cracked in hot spots like cuticles, shins and elbows, is not really in need of a clinical strength lotion. I prefer a more elegant formulation that sinks in and leaves only a moist, dewy sensation behind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For persons with severely dry skin, I suspect the lotion is a godsend. The ingredients are sound, including glycerin, mineral oil, herbal borage oil (thought to be helpful for ecxema and other skin problems), soybean oil, Vitamin E and lecithin. Tapioca starch provides a slight \\&quot;powder\\&quot; sensation, while active ingredient dimethicone adds a protective \\&quot;glove-like\\&quot; residue. The titanium dioxide adds the opacity seen in sunscreens (as it&#x27;s the last ingredient on the list, there would not be enough to add a useful SPF factor).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Both the \\&quot;lightly fragranced\\&quot; and \\&quot;unfragranced\\&quot; versions are scented, which in both cases is mild, pleasant and reminiscent of days on the beach.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Vaseline makes good, solid lotions in general, and I would recommend this product to anyone with very dry, cracked and bothered skin. It&#x27;s also an excellent supplementary lotion to keep in the medicine cabinet for dry skin emergencies, or to add a protective skin barrier in cold, windy climates.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, for daily wear on normal to slightly dry skin, my conclusion is that the Vaseline Clinical Therapy Body Lotion is a bit of overkill.

    <li> Vaseline Intensive Rescue Clinical Therapy Body Lotion is a godsend. At least in my eyes.  I am ones of those women who like to have soft skin but despise lotions that make my hands greasy and slippery.  This lotion did not do that.  For the past two weeks, I have been slathering up my arms, hands, feet, and legs with Vaseline Intensive Rescue Clinical Therapy Body Lotion with the expectation that I would not be able to write or work in the kitchen because of slippery hands.  What did I get for my efforts?  SOFT hands.  I have softer hands, feet, elbows, and legs.  Everywhere I have used the lotion I can feel a difference which is amazing because I have only had this product for around two weeks. Oh! And it smells good too! The scent is light enough to be smelled but does not overwhelm my senses like lotions with a lot of perfume.    Thumbs up Mr. Vaseline Intensive Care.  I plan on buying this lotion from here on out!***Natalie S for Amazon Vine***</li>
    <li> This product is wonderful for dry hands, feet...it leaves a light film on the skin, however, which, for me, makes it more appropriate for night. The film is a bit heavy for use on hands during the day, in my opinion. It is a non oily film, but a film just the same which reminds me of \\&quot;Silicone Glove\\&quot; or other such products from Avon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I really liked the dispenser almost as much as the lotion itself. It can be stored on either end; the dispenser reminds me of the \\&quot;no drip\\&quot; ketchup containers which retract the product when you release pressure on the sides of the bottle. Very nice. The ability to store on its lid makes it more efficient to use that a pump dispenser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will use this more as the winter months approach...</li>
    <li> My girlfriend uses body lotion everyday after her shower.  I got her Vaseline Intensive Rescue Clinical Therapy Body Lotion to try in the winter months when her skin is the driest.  She thought it was a little too thick for everyday, all-over use.  It left her feeling sticky and stuck to her clothes.  She thinks it might work great for problem areas like elbows, knees, etc. but did not like it for all-around daily use.</li>
    <li> Update: After using this body lotion for some time, I found that despite its fresh scent this lotion is really sticky and the feeling does not go away. I also did not find that it was any more moisturizing than other common lotions on the market. I would downgrade this to two stars.</li>
    <li> I really liked this lotion. I normally use lotion from The Body Shop, but I found this to be a refreshing change!  It was light, not greasy and made my skin smooth and soft!  Now to really TEST the product!  I let my mother (a grandma) try it!  She LOVED it.  She is really hard to please in the lotion dept so I&#x27;d say this was a winner!</li>
    <li> This rich lotion certainly delivers on its promises. \\&quot;Intensive rescue\\&quot; is exactly what my dry, scaly feet needed. I started using a little each night, and my ugly feet are actually more normal-looking than they&#x27;ve been in years.    Using the lotion is certainly pleasant. It has a light, slightly coconut fragrance, and it feels silky, not greasy, on your skin. It absorbs quickly. Only a dab goes a long way.</li>
    <li> Very relaxing lotion, very smooth on skin and with a very nice smell that last a long time and not over powering. Very happy with this product..recommended!!!</li>
    <li> I like the fact that it&#x27;s not real strongly scented. This high quality lotion works wonders for dry skin and just a little goes a long way. I have nothing negative to say about this product and highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> When I saw that Amazon was offering lotion and skin care items as part of the Vine review program, I was very excited. I have used Vaseline Intensive Care lotion in the past (my grandparents love the stuff), but this was the first time I&#x27;ve used the Rescue Clinical Therapy Body Lotion.    The Pros: It really does moisturize and it is non-greasy as stated. Your skin stays moisturized for hours unlike some lotions where you have to reapply lotion later on because the body absorbs it too quickly. The lotion is thick and creamy and not watery like cheap lotions.    The Cons: It is sticky. Not greasy, but it leaves a slight sticky film on the skin. I think this probably doesn&#x27;t affect people with intense dry skin as much as it affected me, but I would definitely be aware of this if you&#x27;re going to buy it. I live in a dry climate, so if you live in a really humid city like Miami or Atlanta, the stickiness might bother you.    Update 2011: After using the product for a while, I found I really liked it. During wintertime or during periods where my skin gets really dry, nothing works as well as this stuff does. I still think it&#x27;s a bit sticky for use in the summertime, but when you need a really strong lotion that doesn&#x27;t wash off too quickly or you are in bad weather and your skin is getting dry and chapped, the Clinical Therapy lotion works wonders. I&#x27;ve used it at times when the skin on my hands was rough and lightly peeling and this was the only product that helped.     Unfortunately, I cannot find this product in my local Target or CVS. I wanted to buy more of this stuff last year and ended up having to try a different Vaseline lotion that was supposed to be for dry skin but it was really weak compared this product. I&#x27;m so glad I can order it here.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! I didn;t beleive that it would actually work and help me out. I wear sandals alot. I have horrible dry chapped heels. I have to put a ton of lotion on everyday. I even have to do the lotion and put socks on at night to help.  Even that wouldn;t work with regular lotions.    I tried this, and I immeadaetly noticed a difference after 1 use. That night I didn&#x27;t need to do the sock and lotion bit. The next day was even better. My heels are looking alot better nowadays. I only have to use a tiny bit of the product once a day. I don;t have to sleep in socks anymore. I hated that.    The smell is light and fresh, I love it. The product is thick and creamy. It feels silky. It almost felt greasy at first, but that was just for a few minutes. Don;t wipe it off. Use it everyday, it really works.</li>
    <li> As I did with another \\&quot;clinical-strength\\&quot; product -- a deodorant, in that case -- I approached the Vaseline Intensive Rescue Clinical Therapy Body Lotion from the standpoint of someone who didn&#x27;t need it medically, but who could give it a try on the assumption that if strong is good, stronger is better. Having had this product in regular use for a week or more now, however, I&#x27;d probably recommend against using it if you don&#x27;t really need it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Vaseline moisturizes well enough, and the \\&quot;light fragrance\\&quot; sort of reminded me of coconut-scented suntan lotions. But what I noticed most after applying even small quantities of this was the definite feeling I had something on. Whether outdoors on a hot day or sitting in an air-conditioned office, even hours later I can run my hand across my forehead or an arm and feel, if not exactly greasy, a definite \\&quot;lotiony\\&quot; residue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That&#x27;s a definite contrast to the easy absorption and clean feeling that comes from my old standby [[ASIN:B000FKGIGK Neutrogena Fragrance-Free Norwegian Formula Body Emulsion Intensive Therapeutic Lotion, Packaging May Vary,10.5-Ounce Pumps (Pack of 2)]] (which I don&#x27;t usually refer to by that whole name). Maybe if your dry skin really needs \\&quot;intensive rescue,\\&quot; then the Vaseline may fit the bill. But for the casual user looking for a daily moisturizer, I would recommend the Neutrogena much more highly.</li>
    <li> complete absorption, no greasy feel, nice light smell, keeps skin hydrated and soft to touch.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had dry skin bordering on soriasis (sp?) on my knees for years.  It&#x27;s especially embarassing because I live in Florida and so I wear shorts 10 months out of the year.  I occasionally remember to try some lotion but the next day the dry skin is back again.  But with this lotion they stay moisturized for 3 or 4 days at least and when they are dry they&#x27;re no where near as bad as they were.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So this is one snake oil that you can trust, it really works. Or at least it did for me.</li>
    <li> The reason I like this product so much is that it doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin. Having sensitive skin makes me wary of trying new lotions and moisturizers. This one, however, does the trick! It is light and airy and leaves my skin soft without feeling greasy. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> I always trust any products from Vaseline, but this lotion is incredible.  It goes on smoothly and does not leave a greasy film.  The light fragrance is pleasant and clean and can be worn alone or with perfume.  It&#x27;s light enough that it won&#x27;t interfere with other fragrances you may wish to wear.      I use the lotion all over, concentrating a little more on elbows, knees and heels and I have been extremely pleased with how well it works. I feel confident that it will be an excellent cold-weather lotion and plan on using it this winter as well.    I give it a very high recommendation.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m actually extremely excited about this product.  Having tried countless other lotions that claim to be \\&quot;Intensive Care for Ultra Dry Sking...etc\\&quot;, nothing worked on my dry, cracked hands until now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This lotion has a very pleasant, light, fresh fragrance.  The lotion goes on smoothly and does not leave it oily. It does remain on your skin, as you can feel it is silky smooth and it remains after a couple of hand washings - which is good because that protects your hands longer than most lotions do.  For preventative care, use twice daily.  To heal intensely dry and cracked skin, apply several layers until a thick coat remains on the skin overnight - it will continue to soak in overnight and after 3 days, my skin was already healing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m absolutely in love with this product because it actually works.  I&#x27;ve been desperately trying to find a product that helps my dry skin and my search is finally at an end.  I highly recommend this item!!</li>
    <li> I tried using it for week to see if this lotion would make a difference on my toughest skin area, the heel of my feet. For some reason that area just repels moisture. After using the Vaseline Clinical therapy lotion I didn&#x27;t notice a difference in my skin. The area was much softer. I imagine if it does this well in a week, it should work wonders over a long period of time.</li>
    <li> This lotion helps very dry skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has a nice texture, very mild and pleasant fragrance. It absorbs quickly into the skin. You do not need to use a lot. With this lotion a little goes a long way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My sister used some on her very dry and cracked skin on her hands and it did resolve the problem.The label says \\&quot;prescription strength\\&quot; and I believe that, as it works so well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product</li>
    <li> I have two standards when it comes to lotions:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Scent and Application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Being a male, I don&#x27;t like floral or baby powder scents, or even citrus scents.  I like a clean, fresh smell.  This one provides that.  The fragrance is light not to interfere with cologne, or any other application.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the area of application, lotions tend to be heavy and you have to really work it in to the skin in order to avoid oily residue.  But, this one doesn&#x27;t take much to work into skin and avoid that oily feeling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, being a body lotion, you can apply it to legs, feet, elbows, neck, any area that is dry, or you want to keep hydrated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Vaseline name and product have always been a household when it comes to skin care.  This lotion works really well and lives up to the standards that people have trusted for many years.</li>
    <li> When I saw that Amazon was offering lotion and skin care items , I told my wife and she was very excited. She has used Vaseline Intensive Care lotion prior to this, but this was the first  time she used this Lotion. Your skin stays soft and moisturized for hours unlike some lotions where you have to reapply lotion later on because the body absorbs it too quickly or it evaporates. The only thing is that it&#x27;s somewhat sticky. Not really greasy, but it left a slight film on my skin. I think this probably doesn&#x27;t affect people with dry skin like my wife, as much as it affected me, but I would definitely be aware of this if you&#x27;re going to buy it. We live in a humid climate, but virtually live in air-conditioning, so it worked great. But, if you live in a really humid area, the stickiness might bother you. I would say that this product really is for people with severe-to-dry skin. If you don&#x27;t have very dry skin, or if you don&#x27;t need to be moisturized for half the day, I would look into buying another one of Vaseline&#x27;s Intensive Care products.</li>
    <li> When I ordered Vaseline Intensive Rescue Clinical Therapy Body Lotion, I hadn&#x27;t realized that my wife was out of her favorite, fruity-smelling skin cream.  We received this product, and now my wife will never go back to the heavily-scented product that she used before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This isn&#x27;t the thick, crusty lotion that I remember medicated lotions being - it is very smooth, silky, not at all sticky, and I like the effect it has on my dry skin.  I used it on my trouble spots - my ankles - after showering this summer, when usually the old ankles are an itchy mess.  I saw immediate benefits.  And I liked that the product wasn&#x27;t totally unfragranced - it has enough fragrance to leave a reminder of a pleasant bouquet, and not the heavy, lingering fragrance of so many other products you&#x27;ll find today.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My wife uses it on her hands every night, and now keeps it in her favorite \\&quot;bag of tricks.\\&quot;  In short, this isn&#x27;t the super skin cure all that you might hope to find in a product four times its size at a half the volume, but it is about the most versatile and pleasant products you&#x27;ll see on the market today.</li>
    <li> Vaseline is a great name in lotions but this latest is nothing out of the ordinary or too exciting. I found it to be too greasy and didn&#x27;t do anything for my skin. It is simply okay. One thing I will say, the smell is not overpowering and if you rather use a lotion for shaving rather than shaving cream, this may work for you also. As for myself, I give it a pass.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Katiebabs</li>
    <li> Dependable lotion with a decent fragrance.  It&#x27;s kind of small, so I would keep it in the glove box or a purse if you&#x27;re a lady.  It doesn&#x27;t seem to stand out too differently from other lotions, but it is not bad by any means.</li>
    <li> My skin was dry and starting to become flaky, itchy and painful this winter, I tried a bunch of moisturizers and they weren&#x27;t very effective (my dry skin would come back even just 1-2 hours later) so I gave this one a try. It works! I don&#x27;t find it greasy or filmy, it sinks in alleviates my dry skin problems and I don&#x27;t have to re-apply all the time. Based on other reviews it probably works best on more severe dryness, but it&#x27;s worked wonderfully for me.</li>
    <li> As one who has dry skin I really appreciated this product.  I hate sticky feeling moisturizers.  Hate ones that sit on the surface and do nothing.  Worse are the ones that feel nice for a short time, but don&#x27;t seem to linger.  Actually, Gold Bond Aloe is one the the best out there.  Not perfumey and really works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This compares well to that.  The scent is a very faint hint of coco butter, mixed with that summer scent of swimming pools and tanning lotion.  Immediately, my skin felt like it was getting not a cream, but deep penetrating moisture.  This feeling is stronger than any lotion I have used.  Feel cooling and soothing.&lt;br /&gt;It is thick, but vanishes quickly, no lingering sticky feel.  Half a day later you are still feeling the hydrating and protection it offers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So over all, works very good, lingers wells, and a very light pleasant scent that would work for men and women.</li>
    <li> This was a nice smelling, smooth feeling lotion; however, upon my first use it experienced a red, bumpy, itchy rash.  I was unable to continue to use the product.  I also was unable to provide a review for the product when I tried to do so previously.  I disposed of the product.  I can&#x27;t recommend the product, but my reaction to the lotion may have just been a personal response.e</li>
    <li> It seems that most moisturizers work for a brief time, but before you know it, your skin feels dry and scratchy again. For me, petroleum jelly provides the deepest, long-lasting relief, but especially for hands, the greasiness makes it impractical.    Vaseline Intensive Rescue Clinical Therapy Body Lotion solves the dilemma. I found it to be soothing and effective in relieving dry skin, and you can quickly get back to using your hands. The light fragrance is pleasant without being overbearing, and is appropriate for both men and women. My worst bouts with dry skin occur in the winter, so that will be the ultimate test of the product&#x27;s effectiveness. If it performs nearly as well in winter as in summer, I&#x27;ll be extremely pleased.</li>
    <li> This is a great product for dry hands. It absorbs quickly into the skin and helps to keep my hands from feeling dry and rough without feeling greasy. I would prefer the lotion to be unscented, but this has a light, pleasant fragrance that smells similar to cocoa butter.</li>
