      <li>I like the warm feel it gives my face as I shave.</li>
      <li>Does a really good job of preparing for a close comfortable shave</li>
      <li>You do get a much closer, smoother shave, and it feels great.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;m pleased to recommend this company.</li>
      <li>It feels good on your face because it warms when you rub it on your beard, and it really does help get a closer shave.</li>
      <li>Great product&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Leaves skin soft and easy shaving.&lt;br</li>
      <li>It cleans your face and then your shave is twice as smooth and close, I have found.  </li>
      <li>this product isn&#x27;t covered by Amazon Prime&#x27;s 2 day free shipping guarantee.</li>
      <li>Great product that helps you get that extra close shave!</li>
      <li>Some days it will be available and then it will just disappear for months at a time.  </li>
      <li>I use it just before shaving, and after shaving my skin is super smooth.  </li>
      <li>Shaving can be a real chore, as most men know.</li>
      <li>On days when I need to shave, but don&#x27;t have time to shower, this quickly and efficiently softens my beard to make shaving a breeze.</li>
      <li>I ordered it, expecting a quick delivery since I am an Amazon Prime customer.</li>
      <li>Amazingly high tech face scrub (once you squeeze it out of the tube and rub it on your face, it actually heats up and gives you a warm face scrub!)</li>
      <li>Very fast and efficient-</li>
      <li>I like this product very much.</li>
      <li>Does exactly what it says it does.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a mark of my like of it, that I just ordered six tubes and will order more next time I get paid.</li>
      <li>Put this on and then add your shaving cream and your face warms up just like the barbers shops that had the hot saving cream machine.</li>
      <li>I love this product only face wash</li>
      <li>Does exactly what it says it does and does it fast.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a superior facial scrub because it does not leave my skin feeling dry after using it.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It does allow you to get a much closer shave as the warming from the product really makes a difference.  </li>
      <li>and it really lifts your stubble</li>
      <li>Would highly recommend this product to anyone!</li>
      <li>Everything I expected and more.</li>
      <li>I have tried other scrubs, but this is always the better one.</li>
      <li>So when Gillette came out with this face scrub I had to try it, on the off chance that it might make the task a little better.</li>
      <li>I love this Gillette product and have found it somewhat difficult to find locally, so I was glad to see it advertised on Amazon.</li>
      <li>Need an old time barber shop shave, this is the item for you!</li>
      <li>Great product that is difficult to find in local stores.</li>
      <li>Prices are coming down and I&#x27;d check your local market for possible better price if home delivery is not necessary.</li>

    <li> Great product, makes shaving very comfortable.</li>
    <li> Does what it says softens up the hair so shaving is a little easier.  Use it on my head before I shave that too.</li>
    <li> Great surprise!  Does exactly what it says it does. You do get a much closer, smoother shave, and it feels great. I was skeptical at first but I&#x27;m now a believer.</li>
    <li> Great product that is difficult to find in local stores. Some days it will be available and then it will just disappear for months at a time.  I try to stock up whenever I do see it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does allow you to get a much closer shave as the warming from the product really makes a difference.  I have tried other scrubs, but this is always the better one.</li>

    <li> my boyfrient loves it.</li>
    <li> This stuff is just the best, and I can&#x27;t find it anywhere; perhaps it&#x27;s been discontinued. It&#x27;s a mark of my like of it, that I just ordered six tubes and will order more next time I get paid.

    <li> I love this Gillette product and have found it somewhat difficult to find locally, so I was glad to see it advertised on Amazon. I ordered it, expecting a quick delivery since I am an Amazon Prime customer. It turns out (and it DOES say this when you&#x27;re purchasing) this product isn&#x27;t covered by Amazon Prime&#x27;s 2 day free shipping guarantee. But when I made just a mildly negative comment on my Amazon review--noting that delivery may take a week or two--the company was on the phone to me within 24 hours expressing concern I was dissatisfied, noting (correctly) the product is not advertised as deliverable within 48 hours, and asking if there was anything they could do to improve our relationship.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was frankly shocked, albeit pleasantly, that they were so concerned about my minor annoyance! Bottom line: We worked matters out and I&#x27;m pleased to recommend this company.</li>
    <li> Great product that helps you get that extra close shave! Would highly recommend this product to anyone! If you want a closer shave then this is the product for you!</li>
    <li> This face scrub is wonderful.  I use it just before shaving, and after shaving my skin is super smooth.  The warming (thermal) agent feels nice.  When this product first came out, it was very expensive.  Prices are coming down and I&#x27;d check your local market for possible better price if home delivery is not necessary.</li>
    <li> Amazingly high tech face scrub (once you squeeze it out of the tube and rub it on your face, it actually heats up and gives you a warm face scrub!) that also smells great.  If this were sold by anyone other than Gillette, it would cost $20 a tube.  A bargain for what you get.</li>
    <li> I have sistic acne as nd it on my back chest and neck and iv never in 15 years found a product that helps it and also lets me see a difference!</li>
    <li> Works great for me, 3 pack offsets shipping charge.</li>
    <li> This pre-shave face scrub is actually heated!  It cleans your face and then your shave is twice as smooth and close, I have found.  I think the MFG has discontinued the product, but I got a supply from Amazon!  They came through again!</li>
    <li> I like this product very much. It&#x27;s a superior facial scrub because it does not leave my skin feeling dry after using it. I am now a dedicated user because it works 4 me. I would recommend this to a friend.</li>
    <li> Great product&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Leaves skin soft and easy shaving.&lt;br /&gt;Clean and does not irritate the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend this Gillette&#x27;s product.</li>
    <li> I love this product only face wash I use</li>
    <li> Will buy again. Everything I expected and more. Very fast and efficient- Always a pleasure doing business with you. Great</li>
    <li> If you want a pre scrub this one is the best</li>
    <li> Does a really good job of preparing for a close comfortable shave</li>
