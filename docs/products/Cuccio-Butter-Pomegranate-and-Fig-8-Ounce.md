    <li> Both the papaya &amp; guava, and the body butter are amazing products.&lt;br /&gt;My skin has started to get that dry \\&quot;alligator\\&quot; look.  I use this line of butters on all body parts and it makes my skin look and feel youthful again.  A small amount goes a long way, so while it&#x27;s not cheap you do get your moneys worth.&lt;br /&gt;The main thing is, without exception, when men touch my body they ALWAYs remark at how soft and sensuous my skin feels.  That is the entire object of the exercise, now isn&#x27;t it?  :)</li>
    <li> I got a small .33oz tube of this as an extra in a nail polish swap!  Once I cut off the tip and used if for the first time, I thought the girl who sent it to me was Cray Cray!  This stuff rocks!  Everyone here is right- a little goes a LONG LONG way!  And it really does make your hands (or wherever you choose to use it) feel SILKY smooth.  I usually use a combination of things on my hands and cuticles- eucerin intensive repair hand creme (which is great- but a LOT heavier and greasier than this), and also that Nivea cream that comes in a small blue tin (again- great but way greasy).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This butter is very luxurious feeling.  You notice a difference in your hands right away.  And the smell is nice (pomegranate &amp; fig). It&#x27;s not too overpowering- which I know not from my own nose, but those of my critters.  Usually after I use my lotions, they won&#x27;t let me pet them as I have what is known to kitties as \\&quot;lotion hands.\\&quot;  I reach down, and every time I get that \\&quot;do I smell something\\&quot; look as they turn their heads in disgust and walk away. \\&quot;You&#x27;re not touching ME with that stuff on your hands!\\&quot;  However, after using this creme, they quickly smell my fingers, and then it&#x27;s pets as usual. ;0)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like it!  Not sure if I&#x27;ll go to the trouble of ordering some or not, we&#x27;ll see when my tube runs out! ;)  I&#x27;ve used it for about a week and it&#x27;s only half gone (like I said - very small .33oz tube).  That should tell you how little you need (I am only using this on my hands).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All in all- I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;d be disappointed if you tried it. In fact, I came online to check pricing- I was expecting it to be a LOT more expensive for what it does.  Oh- and the ingredients are awesome! Mostly Aloe, \\&quot;leaf juice\\&quot; (that&#x27;s what it says! first 2 ingredients), water, and other moisturizers. I wonder if the aloe is what gives your hands that feeling of literal silk when it dries down... hm... it&#x27;s nice whatever it is!</li>
    <li> Love, love love this product!!!&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t believe how soft my skin feels after just using one time!!!&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend!</li>

    <li> I thought I was the only one aware of just HOW GREAT this product is!  The first moisturizer that doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy feeling.

I love it so much I bought the little sample size to give to friends to encourage them to use it.
