      <li>I love MK Products!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>stars &#x3D;] &#x3D;]</li>
      <li>If you can overlook the shedding, then my all means love this brush.</li>
      <li>I really love this brush for applying my mineral foundation.  </li>
      <li>I love the way it looks, but I have no idea how it feels to  her.</li>
      <li>My daughter said she didn&#x27;t buy the Mary Kay brush because she thinks a kabuki brush works better with the foundation.</li>
      <li>Mary Kay Mineral Foundation Brushes are always my favorite.</li>
      <li>I will be buying more.</li>
      <li>If you are on a low budget, please go get the Elf brushes cause they are the best!</li>
      <li>The bristles come off all over your face and will come off very easily, however it is very compact so gives a good coverage on your face.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this to anyone looking for great quality &amp; durability in this Mary Kay powder brush.</li>
      <li>I loved it so much I bought one for my mom!</li>
      <li>Thanks for fast shipping great buy!</li>
      <li>I like the shape of the handle as it is really easy to hold and makes it convenient for me to apply my makeup with one hand.</li>
      <li>I love this brush; it gives me a smooth look when applying my mineral bronze foundation for that smooth, silky look.</li>
      <li>This was delivered so quickly!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s so cheap but works well.</li>
      <li>the brush is compact which make even powder makeup go on your face smooth and the makeup stays put.</li>
      <li>It goes with my powder so smoothly</li>
      <li>Though I do enjoy the coverage that this brush gives me with my foundation, it leaves fibers and bristles on my face after I use it.  </li>
      <li>this brush sheds and does not apply smooth</li>
      <li>Very soft, and handy.</li>
      <li>I would recommend this brush to you ladies, works great and its not expensive like those big name brand brushes.</li>
      <li>I loved this brush, I was using daily, but then I decided to wash and the brush started to fall apart.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not a bad brush if it stops shedding...</li>
      <li>Other than that it&#x27;s a great brush.</li>
      <li>Arrived quickly.</li>
      <li>I use the Mary Kay Mineral Foundation Brush with the Ivory 2 Mineral Powder Foundation and absolutely love the soft feeling of the bristles on my face.</li>
      <li>Its worth it in the end.</li>
      <li>Was great the first few days</li>
      <li>This brush is very soft and because of the handle it is easy to use.  </li>
      <li>i liked it,&lt;br /&gt;it was jsut what i expected</li>
      <li>I actually have a lot of Mary Kay brushes and I love them all.</li>
      <li>Still using my old one - made by same company many years ago!</li>
      <li>I suspect I will be purchasing a flat top Kabuki brush and throwing this one in the trash.</li>
      <li>I put the brush under warm running water, added my usual mild brush cleaner, scrunched the bristles and they started falling out off in my hand.  </li>
      <li>I usually have good luck with Mary Kay products but the brushes shed way to much.</li>
      <li>This brush is a nice shape for applying mineral foundation, but it leaves little hairs everywhere.</li>
      <li>Fast shipping.</li>
      <li>so I know what this powder brush really sells for.</li>
      <li>I really like this foundation brush for the fullness &amp; feel of the bristles.  </li>
      <li>I am very picky with my brushes and this one sheds a bunch.  </li>
      <li>I like it really neat product</li>
      <li>Thanks.</li>
      <li>, most of the time, if you are purchasing the mineral powder which this brush is used for directly from a Mary Kay Independent Beauty Consultant, they won&#x27;t charge for this brush.</li>
      <li>I finally asked some MK consultants if there was anything special about this brush or if I could buy another one someplace else.</li>
      <li>However, the bristles occasionally break off or fall out during use, which causes me to have to check to make sure there aren&#x27;t any stray bristles left hanging on my face when finished.  </li>
      <li>I highly recommend the brush and the mineral foundations.</li>
      <li>I highly recommended it.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend you not to buy this product.</li>
      <li>After using MK brushes for years it was time for new ones.</li>
      <li>It is a violation for Mary Kay products to be sold on Amazon or eBay and any active Honest MK consultant will not be selling the products on any other site other than their own Mary Kay Personal Website.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
      <li>I thought maybe my daughter had been right and that I should have used a different brush, so I tried several other makeup brushes I have, and none of them made the powder look any better.  </li>
      <li>For those saying the bristles came off this brush, need to be aware that this product may not be an actual Mary Kay product.</li>
      <li>My old one I purchased when I started using powder, I thought it was time for a new one.</li>
      <li>I think this one is all right if you are not a professional make up artist.</li>

    <li> My old one I purchased when I started using powder, I thought it was time for a new one. They last a long time.</li>
    <li> I loved this brush! I will be buying it again as I have lost it since 2012 but the bristles r soft and they do not fall out even after washing every week. Great quality!</li>
    <li> She loves the way it spreads her powder.  I love the way it looks, but I have no idea how it feels to  her.</li>
    <li> buy the liquid foundation brush it works for the powder and liquid this brush sheds and does not apply smooth</li>
    <li> I like it really neat product</li>
    <li> Mary Kay Mineral Foundation Brushes are always my favorite. I am very happy about the price. Even with shipping it was still cheaper than purchasing it from a consultant. The brushes can be reused if you just wash them every so often.</li>
    <li> Was great the first few days but I made a horrible mistake.... I tried to wash it!  Silly me, what the heck was I thinkin&#x27;?  I put the brush under warm running water, added my usual mild brush cleaner, scrunched the bristles and they started falling out off in my hand.  It was sad.  The brush looked like it had the mange.  On the plus side, my dog enjoyed burying it in the yard.  Rest in peace little brush, rest in peace.</li>
    <li> These are terrific brushes.</li>
    <li> Although this came with my Mary Kay mineral foundation I have never found it effective for foundation. I always end up using Kabuki brush. But this works perfectly for blush, highlight, and contouring but of course with powder product not cream.</li>
    <li> Mary Kay products are always my favorites, so finding this brush and at such a low cost was just what I was looking for. Its soft and just the right size, how can you go wrong?</li>
    <li> granddaughters Christmas gift</li>
    <li> This is a nice foundation brush.  I would purchase this again.</li>
    <li> I though the size would be bigger than this&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s good if you want to put it in your bag and its not heavy&lt;br /&gt;...</li>
    <li> i bought this awaiting if i decided to buy my sigma brushes. its a good starter brush, the bristles were ok. i would pass this on to my sisters or nieces. good brush either way</li>
    <li> wonderful! I love MK Products!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; If you need to order anything please contact me at aknight74033@marykay.com&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;mention offer MKAmazon and you&#x27;ll get 5% off!!</li>
    <li> This brush is very soft and because of the handle it is easy to use.  the brush is compact which make even powder makeup go on your face smooth and the makeup stays put. I love this brush and would buy again, plus the price was good.</li>
    <li> Great product. Fast shipping.</li>
    <li> Always been a fan of MK and absolutely love this brush. It goes with my powder so smoothly and i can imagine using anything else</li>
    <li> I loved this brush, I was using daily, but then I decided to wash and the brush started to fall apart. So disappointed with mary key</li>
    <li> i liked it,&lt;br /&gt;it was jsut what i expected&lt;br /&gt;it is soft&lt;br /&gt;so far so good&lt;br /&gt;4 stars &#x3D;] &#x3D;]</li>
    <li> I would recommend this brush to you ladies, works great and its not expensive like those big name brand brushes. I use this brush for my mary kay powders.</li>
    <li> I really love this brush for applying my mineral foundation.  It blends it perfectly and evenly.  It does not shed and for the price, you can&#x27;t go wrong!</li>
    <li> This was delivered so quickly! Safely packaged &amp; price is unbeatable! I used to sell Mary Kay so I know what this powder brush really sells for. This is what MY cost used to be to buy this same powder brush. I highly recommend this to anyone looking for great quality &amp; durability in this Mary Kay powder brush. Makes a great gift too!! &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> I love this brush! It is a smaller brush, but it does the job and it does the job well. It&#x27;s really easy to clean, and I use this brush from blush to bronzer, and it works great for either! I highly recommended it.</li>
    <li> Not worth the buy! It sheds all over your face after you apply your foundation. Might as well buy a better brand even if it is a little more on the expensive side! Its worth it in the end.</li>
    <li> After using MK brushes for years it was time for new ones. Loved finding them at a great price. Would and have recommend them for others.</li>
    <li> I love Marykay products and this brush is perfect for the mineral fondation poweder. It fits perfect in my makeup bag!</li>
    <li> WONDERFUL PRODUCT - LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> Swirl product in the lid, tap excess off brush, and apply in circular blending motion. Very quality in appearance, and I have not experienced shedding.</li>
    <li> It is small and compact, just what I needed while traveling. I love this brush! I will be buying more.</li>
    <li> Thanks for fast shipping great buy!</li>
    <li> Great product. Arrived quickly.</li>
    <li> Awesome.  Would purchase again.</li>
    <li> I think this one is all right if you are not a professional make up artist. It&#x27;s great for traveling.</li>
    <li> I love this brush; it gives me a smooth look when applying my mineral bronze foundation for that smooth, silky look. I highly recommend the brush and the mineral foundations.</li>
    <li> I brought this excited to use with my powder foundation but it came broken so I had to glue it back together. Other than that it&#x27;s a great brush. And really soft...</li>
    <li> I have been putting up with this brush for a few years now, It has shed all that time. I started wearing a robe to keep bristles off my clothes. I finally asked some MK consultants if there was anything special about this brush or if I could buy another one someplace else. They admitted that, though they love MK&#x27;s eye makeup brushes, they also have problems with the mineral foundation brush shedding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m going to go to Ulta and see what they suggest. I suspect I will be purchasing a flat top Kabuki brush and throwing this one in the trash.</li>
    <li> Though I do enjoy the coverage that this brush gives me with my foundation, it leaves fibers and bristles on my face after I use it.  One time I used it and a few bristles came off and made me look like I had cat whiskers.  Glad I had a wonderful co-worker point it out before I went to an appointment.  If you can overlook the shedding, then my all means love this brush.</li>
    <li> I am very picky with my brushes and this one sheds a bunch.  I usually have good luck with Mary Kay products but the brushes shed way to much.</li>
    <li> I like this brush it is soft unlike the other brush that i bought before...and it is not too long so i could bring it anywhere...</li>
    <li> ATTENTION!!!!! For those saying the bristles came off this brush, need to be aware that this product may not be an actual Mary Kay product. It is a violation for Mary Kay products to be sold on Amazon or eBay and any active Honest MK consultant will not be selling the products on any other site other than their own Mary Kay Personal Website.&lt;br /&gt;Also, most of the time, if you are purchasing the mineral powder which this brush is used for directly from a Mary Kay Independent Beauty Consultant, they won&#x27;t charge for this brush. Please go to the Mary Kay website, put in your zip code and find a consultant who will be glad to help you! Thanks.</li>
    <li> The bristles come off all over your face and will come off very easily, however it is very compact so gives a good coverage on your face. It was good for the price, but wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
    <li> Not the same quality as the previous ones.</li>
    <li> This is the best foundation brush I&#x27;ve ever had. I actually have a lot of Mary Kay brushes and I love them all.</li>
    <li> I really like this foundation brush for the fullness &amp; feel of the bristles.  However, the bristles occasionally break off or fall out during use, which causes me to have to check to make sure there aren&#x27;t any stray bristles left hanging on my face when finished.  Minor flaw.</li>
    <li> Please stay away from this one.  I did not notice the origin of the product, waited forever to get it and have spent the last three weeks of using it while the bristles continue to fall out.  It is a product of China and not worth your money.</li>
    <li> This brush is great! It&#x27;s so cheap but works well. It doesn&#x27;t shed and has really good coverage. I would recommend this brush to anyone who is looking for a good inexpensive brush!</li>
    <li> I bought this product for my girlfriend . And she says that this cosmetic brush gets the job done when applying liquid foundation, but it does have a lot of shedding.</li>
    <li> I use the Mary Kay Mineral Foundation Brush with the Ivory 2 Mineral Powder Foundation and absolutely love the soft feeling of the bristles on my face. I have noticed a few of the bristles falling out on my face, but I think that is to be expected. It doesn&#x27;t shed terribly, just a minimal amount. I like the shape of the handle as it is really easy to hold and makes it convenient for me to apply my makeup with one hand.</li>
    <li> This brush is a nice shape for applying mineral foundation, but it leaves little hairs everywhere. I was not expecting that from a Mary Kay product. A little disappointed, but I still use it almost every day. I just have to clean my bathroom counter after I do, LOL :)</li>
    <li> Can I leave no star? :) this brush is terrible.. loose hairs every time I used it.&lt;br /&gt;Dont waste your time</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not a bad brush if it stops shedding... I&#x27;ve got this product for several days, and now it&#x27;s still shedding... I feel helpless</li>
    <li> I liked the brush and ordered another one for a friend.</li>
    <li> I liked the brush but it broke within two weeks.</li>
    <li> The hairs fall off, and not one or two hairs but a lot when using this brush. I highly recommend you not to buy this product. Your Welcome.</li>
    <li> Wonderful powder brush, although after the first wash, even with a brush guard became very poofy, and I noticed it began to have a lot of fallout, but the brush still works wonderfully. Very soft, and handy. I would definitely buy this brush again.</li>
    <li> Nice brush good quality</li>
    <li> It came broken - (head from handle) - I fixed it with Gorilla Glue!  But, it sheds bristles when I use it so I have black hairs all over my face!  Still using my old one - made by same company many years ago!</li>
    <li> This brush fell apart after only a couple of weeks of using it. The head came off  of the handle. Poor quality workmanship.</li>
    <li> This is one of the best makeup brushes ever. I loved it so much I bought one for my mom!</li>
    <li> I ordered the brush to go with the Mary Kay Mineral Powder Foundation.  My daughter uses the Mary Kay Mineral Foundation, and since her skin looks so beautiful in the mineral powder, I ordered the Mineral Powder Foundation for myself, and also the brush, separately.  The foundation just didn&#x27;t work for me.  It showed every pore and line, almost making them look worse!  My daughter said she didn&#x27;t buy the Mary Kay brush because she thinks a kabuki brush works better with the foundation. I thought maybe my daughter had been right and that I should have used a different brush, so I tried several other makeup brushes I have, and none of them made the powder look any better.  The Mary Kay brush feels very stiff and almost irritating when used, compared to a nice soft cosmetic brush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since I didn&#x27;t care for the mineral powder foundation, I can&#x27;t say whether the brush was good or not.  For me, it wasn&#x27;t, but if you like a flat-end, stiff brush, then maybe you&#x27;d like it.  The price, at least, was very reasonable.</li>
    <li> Please dont waste your money buying this brush as it pulls off. If you are on a low budget, please go get the Elf brushes cause they are the best!</li>
