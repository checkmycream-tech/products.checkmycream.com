      <li>Works great.</li>
      <li>is awesome as well case is nice</li>
      <li>I use the one I need for my beard, and it just does a great job.</li>
      <li>An attachment head that would be a welcome addition, is a nose and ear hair trimmer.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Good thing</li>
      <li>And most of all it gives a great cut.</li>
      <li>So I have not used it very many times at all</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m more than happy with product and honest advertisement</li>
      <li>The cut is close and precise, which I am happy with.</li>
      <li>Nice and lite wieght.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Except for that one incident it worked great and was very useful.</li>
      <li>it is very light weight</li>
      <li>you will love it battery</li>
      <li>The guides are flimsy and I suspect will break before too much more use.</li>
      <li>As others have stated it seems to pull the hair out more than it cuts it.</li>
      <li>I love Wahl trimmers and this one is no exception.</li>
      <li>Comes with a travel bag, tray better for home, yes.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Lots of power I use it mostly for nose hair</li>
      <li>It worked much better than the Wahl  in removing hair, however it does not have a comb attachment so it might scratch if not used</li>
      <li>If you need a nose hair / ear hair trimmer, I suspect you&#x27;d be better off with something else.</li>
      <li>wish there were more stars to give</li>
      <li>This is a great trimmer that works very well.</li>
      <li>On top of that the replaceable heads break way to easy if you drop it at any time while using it the head breaks and will not latch on any more.</li>
      <li>this is one of the best trimmers I have used in a long time.</li>
      <li>I love the snap fit heads and versatility of this trimmer......</li>
      <li>With all my military deployments, it&#x27;s the perfect trimmer to keep my stache and beard under control....</li>
      <li>Even though this unit is mostly plastic, I do not feel like anything is cheap</li>
      <li>It holds a charge well and has a really strong motor.</li>
      <li>strong clippers.</li>
      <li>Normally they have really good stuff.</li>
      <li>After dropping it in the shower on a teak mat (not tile or tub) I haven&#x27;t been able to get the blades true and it pools hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Best ever hands down no joke trust me</li>
      <li>I have used every tip except the fine detail one.</li>
      <li>the foil attachment doesn&#x27;t work as well as some of the body groomers but the clippers are fine.</li>
      <li>Had a huge beard.</li>
      <li>Makes your beard smooth for all to see  Trims my beard and mustache too  </li>
      <li>for full body shaving and it does the job without the bumps, easy to clean and the attachments are well built</li>
      <li>but so far I&#x27;m very pleased with it.</li>
      <li>When I used the brush to clean the blades, the piece with the blades became detached.  </li>
      <li>Length is even and neck is clean  </li>
      <li>My son loved receiving this Groomsman Pro Sport as one of his Christmas present!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been looking for a nice looking and strong CORDLESS trimmer for a long time.  </li>
      <li>The process is easy and very convenient.  </li>
      <li>And I use it to help him keep the back of his neck ,nice and neat, between haircuts.</li>
      <li>It is working OK so far.</li>
      <li>Groomsman Pro Sport is really fun  </li>
      <li>they muscled right through it.</li>
      <li>This thing is great for the small jobs, i.e., eyebrow trims, sideburns trims, and nose and ear hair.</li>
      <li>And what surprised me most is the titling and adjusting of the trimmer head to get a perfect angle for much better access to left and right side and difficult places.  </li>
      <li>It was a gift for my husband, he says it works great, sharp blades and very professional results-whiskers stick to the handle grip though</li>
      <li>Further, the battery life on this trimmer is great, it lasts me several days trimming before I have to charge it again.</li>
      <li>cause I was used to the smaller trimmers, but I do love this one, cordless and powerful.</li>
      <li>Exactly what I needed, others can&#x27;t compare to these.</li>
      <li>Because the unit is rather small, this may be a tool that is best suited for smaller grooming jobs or touch ups.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The</li>
      <li>This works pretty well as a trimmer, but the swapping of heads seems like something that you can only do so many times before the plastic gives.</li>
      <li>I was able to put it back together and it works as if it never happened.</li>
      <li>Good if you have a beard and probably durable; certainly seems to have some of the heavy duty construction of domestically made Wahl products.</li>
      <li>Fortunately I was able to snap it back in place, and managed not to lose a tiny spring that rests below the blades.  </li>
      <li>it was easy to put back together</li>
      <li>The yellow and black color scheme makes the unit easier to locate, and the rubberized body provides a nice secure grip.  </li>
      <li>really like it.  </li>
      <li>Vibrates too much to be a viable nose-hair trimmer, and itsn&#x27;t shaped well for that purpose.</li>
      <li>Very unreliable.</li>
      <li>It is very unreliable.</li>
      <li>I had expected better from Wahl.</li>
      <li>cant see much diffence after shaving.</li>
      <li>So I really like Wahl.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s clolored a manly bright yellow and black, or one might think it was a lady&#x27;s shaver.</li>
      <li>They don&#x27;t make that model anymore, it had a vacuum system which I loved, didn&#x27;t leave a barber shop type mess.</li>
      <li>Much better than the previous model.</li>
      <li>Only thing missing is a good storing/organizing tray.</li>
      <li>I was surprised because I have had Wahl products in the past that I&#x27;ve been very pleased with.</li>
      <li>The main problem is with the charging.</li>
      <li>I love this little trimmer</li>
      <li>They replaced it with a new unit that I have been using for about three days.  </li>
      <li>, Mister Yellow has a new home, hope he last ten or more years,</li>
      <li>in have used it twice on one charge so far!</li>
      <li>Really, no way man.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this to replace a very old and loyal Whal who&#x27;s batteries are giving up the ghost.</li>
      <li>I dropped the one I use, not very hard onto a towel and it split apart.</li>
      <li>The hair clippers do a nice job for maintenance and minor touchups, and if really necessary, occasionally taking on some bigger jobs.  </li>
      <li>The hair clippers do a nice job for maintenance and minor touchups, and if really necessary, occasionally taking on some bigger jobs.  </li>
      <li>It looks pretty cool with the black and yellow design.</li>
      <li>Mister Yellow, not so much, he thinks he&#x27;s in a barber shop and can leave hairs anywhere, which he does.</li>
      <li>After I bought it had my 18 year old son tried it</li>
      <li>being said, this little yellow gem is easy to hold, so many cutting angles with its rotating head, cuts very precise and there&#x27;s all those attachments and other goodies.</li>
      <li>However, if you are a person with heavy facial or body hair, the shaver attachment probably will not be up to the task on a regular basis, and you will probably better served using a dedicated shaver or heavier duty manscaping tool.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Why Whal doesn&#x27;t put this product on their front page is beyond me.  I&#x27;ve been looking for a nice looking and strong CORDLESS trimmer for a long time.  After a long research and reading the reviews I purchased it. It is fantastic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Good looking, and fits perfectly in your hand.  And what surprised me most is the titling and adjusting of the trimmer head to get a perfect angle for much better access to left and right side and difficult places.  Battery lasts a long time even if its not Lithium Ion.  Price is incredible.  After I bought it had my 18 year old son tried it and he went and ordered one for himself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I really like it.  Guys, this is what we need for a trimmer.  I just hope Whal won&#x27;t increase price after this review.</li>
    <li> [[ASIN:B003XU1BSY Wahl 9953-1301 Groomsman Pro Sport, Black/yellow]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This little gem, is little. Good thing it&#x27;s clolored a manly bright yellow and black, or one might think it was a lady&#x27;s shaver. Really, no way man.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought this to replace a very old and loyal Whal who&#x27;s batteries are giving up the ghost. They don&#x27;t make that model anymore, it had a vacuum system which I loved, didn&#x27;t leave a barber shop type mess. Mister Yellow, not so much, he thinks he&#x27;s in a barber shop and can leave hairs anywhere, which he does. I guess, if you already deal with the hairy mess, it won&#x27;t be a problem for you, or your wife.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That being said, this little yellow gem is easy to hold, so many cutting angles with its rotating head, cuts very precise and there&#x27;s all those attachments and other goodies. Only thing missing is a good storing/organizing tray. Comes with a travel bag, tray better for home, yes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ya, Mister Yellow has a new home, hope he last ten or more years, as his vacuum styled predecessor did, may he rest in piece, in the land of old, tired and worn out shavers/trimmers.</li>
    <li> So I really like Wahl. Normally they have really good stuff. I used this maybe once a week probably every two weeks. So I have not used it very many times at all and it already stopped working. Very disappointing and now I have to buy another one. My last clipper lasted like 10 years. This is very disappointing.</li>
    <li> The thing does not hold a charge... at full power I can shave my thick beard and/or head.... but the charge only lasts 15 minutes!!! On top of that the replaceable heads break way to easy if you drop it at any time while using it the head breaks and will not latch on any more. Overall I am not happy with this product and I really hope you stick with something else I am disappointed that Wahl would put out a product of such low quality.</li>
    <li> works as expected for the price. this is a small unit so don&#x27;t expect to be using it to shave your head. the foil attachment doesn&#x27;t work as well as some of the body groomers but the clippers are fine.</li>
    <li> This thing is great for the small jobs, i.e., eyebrow trims, sideburns trims, and nose and ear hair. For that I highly recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: I&#x27;ve had this for 3 and 1/2 years, and it&#x27;s still sharp and efficient. About every six months I use a little Wahl oil on the blades, and they cut like they&#x27;ve just been honed. I&#x27;m afraid that the battery doesn&#x27;t hold a charge the way it used to, but with one hour of charging, it runs full power. It can also be run plugged in, though I&#x27;ve never had to do that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EW</li>
    <li> Whal 9953-1301  Groomsman Pro Sport is really fun  Black/Yellow like a bumble bee  Makes your beard smooth for all to see  Trims my beard and mustache too  Push the start button is all you do  Length is even and neck is clean  One of the best I have ever seen.  [[ASIN:B003XU1BSY Wahl 9953-1301 Groomsman Pro Sport, Black/yellow]]</li>
    <li> This shaver is awesome.  All of the attachments are great except for the sliding one, which is too slidey.  It DOES cut me if I don&#x27;t have the guards on though.</li>
    <li> for full body shaving and it does the job without the bumps, easy to clean and the attachments are well built</li>
    <li> The blades are not sharp for close shaving</li>
    <li> Does not hold a charge enough for a shave I have several wahl trimmers which have been great,this one is not worth the wahl name</li>
    <li> This works pretty well as a trimmer, but the swapping of heads seems like something that you can only do so many times before the plastic gives. Vibrates too much to be a viable nose-hair trimmer, and itsn&#x27;t shaped well for that purpose. Good if you have a beard and probably durable; certainly seems to have some of the heavy duty construction of domestically made Wahl products. If you need a nose hair / ear hair trimmer, I suspect you&#x27;d be better off with something else.</li>
    <li> I love Wahl trimmers and this one is no exception. It looks pretty cool with the black and yellow design. It holds a charge well and has a really strong motor. Attachments are the standard attachments and my only complaint is the handle material is like a silicone grip which makes my hair cling to it and it&#x27;s virtually impossible to get it off. Other than that I love it, I&#x27;ve used mine about 3-4 times a week for the past 6 months and it still works flawlessly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;** I have had a slight issue where some of the attachments will nick me if I catch myself at the wrong angle but it&#x27;s not a deal breaker and I certainly don&#x27;t bleed more than a droplet at worst.</li>
    <li> I love the snap fit heads and versatility of this trimmer......I bought two!! My Dad even bought one for himself!! With all my military deployments, it&#x27;s the perfect trimmer to keep my stache and beard under control....lol!!</li>
    <li> Had a huge beard. they muscled right through it. strong clippers. i would reccommend to a friend. the work well</li>
    <li> Does everything I needed a body and hair trimmer to do I&#x27;m more than happy with product and honest advertisement</li>
    <li> Not a very well made blade. After dropping it in the shower on a teak mat (not tile or tub) I haven&#x27;t been able to get the blades true and it pools hairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Except for that one incident it worked great and was very useful. I was surprised because I have had Wahl products in the past that I&#x27;ve been very pleased with. I ended up buying a Wahl &amp;#34;Peanut&amp;#34; corded trimmer and won&#x27;t use anything else now.</li>
    <li> I want to help&lt;br /&gt;Disrupted work a bit, then suddenly become weak I do not know what are the problem</li>
    <li> It takes a little bit to learn to use this one cause I was used to the smaller trimmers, but I do love this one, cordless and powerful.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this razor for several weeks now. I don&#x27;t like it. As others have stated it seems to pull the hair out more than it cuts it. Not pleasant. The guides are flimsy and I suspect will break before too much more use. Save your money, but something  else.</li>
    <li> Works great. Nice and lite wieght. My husband loves using it everyday. And I use it to help him keep the back of his neck ,nice and neat, between haircuts.</li>
    <li> I bought this thing and used it for maybe two months before the battery stopped charging and it became useless. Even brand new the thing could hardly make it through one shave. I had to buy another brand only 2 months after buying this piece of crap.</li>
    <li> Lots of power I use it mostly for nose hair but it has enough power to do any job. The only complaint I have is that the accessories that come with it are not very well made come apart easy I dropped the one I use, not very hard onto a towel and it split apart. it was easy to put back together and I put a hose clamp on it to keep it that way. Works plugged in also.</li>
    <li> My son loved receiving this Groomsman Pro Sport as one of his Christmas present!</li>
    <li> It was a gift for my husband, he says it works great, sharp blades and very professional results-whiskers stick to the handle grip though</li>
    <li> This is a great trimmer that works very well. The combs are a bit pointy and can leave a mark if  your not careful, that is why the 1/2 star reduction. Time will tell about the battery lasting. Even though this unit is mostly plastic, I do not feel like anything is cheap (well maybe the combs). Great for the price.</li>
    <li> The battery failed to accept a charge on the first Groomsman.  I contacted the Wahl company and they had me ship it back to them.  They replaced it with a new unit that I have been using for about three days.  It is working OK so far.</li>
    <li> I love this little trimmer it is very light weight so my hands don&#x27;t get tired. And most of all it gives a great cut.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I needed, others can&#x27;t compare to these. Much better than the previous model. It also comes with a case.</li>
    <li> Bought this product to shave my back. Useless. Does not shave at all- cant see much diffence after shaving. Shaving head keeps falling off power bar, very annoying. Tried shaving my arms and body- barely removed anything. The battery life is very short between recharges.&lt;br /&gt;Tried my Norelco shaver trimmer attachment for comparison. It worked much better than the Wahl  in removing hair, however it does not have a comb attachment so it might scratch if not used carefully.&lt;br /&gt;This is my second Wahl product to end up in the garbage (the other was the nose trimmer). I guess I am a slow learner. No more Wahl for me.</li>
    <li> Just as described, works perfectly and good quality, I would recommend this product to anyone as it is working out perfectly.</li>
    <li> I thought it would of been bigger. but it is actually perfect size.. in have used it twice on one charge so far! I have used every tip except the fine detail one. this is one of the best trimmers I have used in a long time. I did drop it and one of the heads came apart! I was able to put it back together and it works as if it never happened. it is sturdy and sharp ! wish there were more stars to give , I&#x27;d give this an 8 if possible!</li>
    <li> Best ever hands down no joke trust me you will love it battery is awesome as well case is nice</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t even use all the various accessories this thing comes with. I use the one I need for my beard, and it just does a great job. Further, the battery life on this trimmer is great, it lasts me several days trimming before I have to charge it again. The cut is close and precise, which I am happy with. I recommend it for the price.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t had it that long but so far I&#x27;m very pleased with it. Looks like it will last a long time.</li>
    <li> Disappointed. Bought this from the department store. This has given me nothing but problems. The main problem is with the charging. It is very unreliable. It doesn&#x27;t seem to charge at all even after 12 hours of charging. And I have tried all outlets at home and at hotels while traveling. This is an intermittent problem. Sometimes it charges and sometimes it doesn&#x27;t. So, you are never sure when you wake up in the morning that when you switch it on for your morning shave and trim, it will work. Its highly annoying. Very unreliable. I had expected better from Wahl. Seriously, buy yourself a backup device for just-in-case. This product alone is useless, unreliable, and inconsistent.</li>
    <li> Excellent product, works great.</li>
    <li> The Wahl 9953-1301 Groomsman Pro Sport is a small battery powered grooming tool with interchangeable heads, which can operate as either a hair trimmer, or a shaver.  Because the unit is rather small, this may be a tool that is best suited for smaller grooming jobs or touch ups.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Groomsman Pro Sport comes with a number of accessories, including three hair clipper attachments, and a shaver attachment.  Also included is a carrying case, comb attachments for the clipper heads, a cleaning brush, small comb, machine oil, and an AC adapter for charging the unit.  The yellow and black color scheme makes the unit easier to locate, and the rubberized body provides a nice secure grip.  The unit is not designed to be exposed to water, so you can&#x27;t use it in the shower.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When attached to the unit, the head can be rotated to different angles.  Changing attachments simply involves pulling off one head, and snapping another into place on the handle.  The process is easy and very convenient.  The clipper heads are 1.4\\&quot;, 1\\&quot;, and 0.4\\&quot; wide.  Long term, the clipper heads will probably hold up well enough, however, there could be reasons to be concerned about the durability of the shaver head, which has some plastic parts that are held together by small plastic pins.  When I used the brush to clean the blades, the piece with the blades became detached.  Fortunately I was able to snap it back in place, and managed not to lose a tiny spring that rests below the blades.  I could be wrong, but I can easily see the plastic connector wearing out or breaking, under normal use, or when cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shaver does a decent job, however as it is very small, it might take some time to get the job done.  Fully charged, the unit is supposed to have a maximum runtime of 60 minutes, which might be enough to handle the entire body, depending on how much hair is involved.  An attachment head that would be a welcome addition, is a nose and ear hair trimmer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price of the Groomsman Pro Sport is competitive, the workmanship is not bad, and the product is convenient to use, however this unit doesn&#x27;t seem to be designed for heavy duty use.  The hair clippers do a nice job for maintenance and minor touchups, and if really necessary, occasionally taking on some bigger jobs.  However, if you are a person with heavy facial or body hair, the shaver attachment probably will not be up to the task on a regular basis, and you will probably better served using a dedicated shaver or heavier duty manscaping tool.price of the Groomsman Pro Sport is competitive, the workmanship is not bad, and the product is convenient to use, however this unit doesn&#x27;t seem to be designed for heavy duty use.
