### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>PERFECT!</li>
      <li>I have used the Josie Maran argan oil by itself on my face and loved it, so when I found a product with SPF in it, I jumped!</li>
      <li>AND GIVES ME A GLOW AND BEAUTIFUL SKIN TO GO ABOUT MY DAY.&lt;br</li>
      <li>This is a great product.  </li>
      <li>This sun protection is great.</li>
      <li>Great for all ages....</li>
      <li>Protection and great moisture.</li>
      <li>The price is fair and I&#x27;m glad I purchased!!</li>
      <li>is a good product.</li>
      <li>It smells good.  </li>
      <li>This is the best sunscreen I can find that is natural and contains Argan Oil, which gives your skin a beautiful sheen.  </li>
      <li>I just love this moisturizer!</li>
      <li>Love the 40+ sunscreen protection!</li>
      <li>This stuff is amazing.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It has a nice pump dispenser.</li>
      <li>This argan oil lotion is very light and not at all greasy....</li>
      <li>My favorite SPF of all times.</li>
      <li>My skin looks &amp; feels better and hydrated.</li>
      <li>But I love how it feels when I use it.  </li>
      <li>I love it.  </li>
      <li>I absolutely love Josie maran after reading a favorite blog and the writer discussed her regimen, I thought to give this a try.</li>
      <li>This product is not greasy like most face lotion with sun screen.  </li>
      <li>I love the product.&lt;br</li>
      <li>and I love it.</li>
      <li>I have tried so many products for oily skin, that when I read about this product, I was going to dismiss it as just another gimmick.</li>
      <li>I wear it every day and love it.  </li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s especially good for long day in the sun.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not a bad product, just not as amazing as all the claims.</li>
      <li>However, this product is all natural and I experienced zero break-outs,</li>
      <li>Besides being free of harmful chemicals it gives your skin a lovely, smooth glow.</li>
      <li>This was a natural, smooth, great smelling moisturizer and SPF</li>
      <li>BUT it is no longer available on Amazon or at stores - told they were reformulating it.</li>
      <li>I lightly rub it into my face, doing portions at a time.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s hard to find a non-chemical sunscreen that feels good going on, smells good and disappears into the skin.  </li>
      <li>The first thing I noticed when I put a few drops of the moisturizer on my face was how wonderful it smells.  </li>
      <li>Overall I think this is a good product, but it has clogged my pores so I probably won&#x27;t be using is anymore.</li>
      <li>like a sweet smell..</li>
      <li>It is pretty liquidy which allows me to spread it easily over my face.</li>
      <li>Not only does the lotion smell fantastic, but it absorbs nicely into your skin without leaving an oily residue.</li>
      <li>I have super oily skin..</li>
      <li>Months ago I was able to find it easily in travel and in a larger size.  </li>
      <li>Also when I used it during the summer months it seemed to calm the redness my skin&lt;</li>
      <li>I cannot use this on it&#x27;s own, it isn&#x27;t moisturizing enough for me.</li>
      <li>this product was definitely heavier than i would have liked; although, i never did make me break out.</li>
      <li>i liked how small it was, but i ran through it really quickly because it feels more like a sunscreen than a face lotion.</li>
      <li>I quickly fell in love with argan oil, so I wanted a moisturizer and a sunblock similar to this oil.</li>
      <li>Overall, it&#x27;s a good sunscreen if you&#x27;re looking for something all natural.</li>
      <li>Used it for the first time today.  </li>
      <li>I love this stuff and definitely suggest it to anyone looking for a quality SPF and moisturizer.</li>
      <li>This is very hydrating!  </li>
      <li>so I&#x27;d say this sunscreen functions pretty well as a primer.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s expensive, but lasts FOREVER and is the best i&#x27;ve found (and i&#x27;ve been looking for years).</li>
      <li>Smells good, and makes my skin feel so soft, and not oily or dry at all.</li>
      <li>THE BEST SUNSCREEN EVER, NON GREASY, SMALL AMOUNT GOES A LONG WAY, STAYS ON ALL DAY.  </li>
      <li>I really noticed a difference the first day of wearing it..</li>
      <li>This product smells good, but it has caused my skin to break out in small bumps.</li>
      <li>And the SPF 40 protection is awesome without the irritation of the usual ingridients used in other products.    </li>
      <li>I think I expected more from this product because of all the hype surrounding argan oil.</li>
      <li>so I have to be very cautious when it comes to ingredients.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Not much in there</li>
      <li>very nice.&lt;br</li>
      <li>It absorbs fairly quickly, allowing you to apply makeup without getting a cakey or greasy texture (I use either Bare Minerals or Lancome Teint Idole).</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t been able to use Bare Minerals and products like that for the same reason.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll most likely look for an alternative in the future.</li>
      <li>Tried it again a week or two later just to make sure and the same thing happened.</li>
      <li>it tends to be more oily and winter more dry because, duh,</li>
      <li>The consistency is not thick, which I like.</li>
      <li>I have used this product for years since I am very sensitive to fragrances and cosmetic products.</li>
      <li>But otherwise, my skin can be very sensitive to break outs and cysts</li>
      <li>I have acne-prone skin that easily gets congested and oily, but have not broken out at all since using this product every day for the past week.</li>
      <li>The only problem is that I am now only able to find the small travel size, not the full size.</li>
      <li>And I have also very sensitive mature skin..</li>
      <li>I was very worried to try a new product, but was recommended to the Josie Maran line through several sensitive skin websites.  </li>
      <li>RECOMMEND THIS FROM 15YRS OLD TO 100YRS OLD</li>
      <li>The only con is the pump puts out too much</li>
      <li>I have sensitive skin and this sunscreen does not irritate my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I am a real convert to the Josie line, as I still haven&#x27;t had a reaction to any of the products I have used (foundation, facial wash, moisturizer, blush).  </li>
      <li>I have ultra sensitive, combo skin.</li>
      <li>I have sensitive skin and like this product.</li>
      <li>So all in all, I very much like this moisturizer and plan on purchasing the bigger size when I run out of the current one.</li>
      <li>but overall, I have pretty dry skin</li>
      <li>The quality of this sunscreen is worth it if you&#x27;re serious about investing in a gentle, natural, anti-aging daily regimen.</li>
      <li>it is the slightly flowery smell, which reminds me very much of the air freshener on planes.</li>
      <li>Finding a good SPF that is natural seems impossible.</li>
      <li>The first time I tried this, the next day I had a slight reaction around my chin (this lead to the four star rating).  </li>
      <li>I have very dry, sensitive skin.  </li>
      <li>Unfortunately, this product made my pores look huge!</li>

<li> I had previously used a physical EltaMD sunscreen, but I found that it flaked when I touched my skin after the sunscreen dried.  </li>
<li> It does not cause tingling or burning like some other products do.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have super oily skin..so a moisturizer is not needed during the day. However, I do desire sun protection and my powder foundation did not provide enough.  I have tried so many products for oily skin, that when I read about this product, I was going to dismiss it as just another gimmick. But because I continue to believe into the \\&quot;holy grail\\&quot; for a moisturizer/serum that will not exaggerate my oily skin and still give me sun protection, I ended up purchasing this product.    The first thing I noticed when I put a few drops of the moisturizer on my face was how wonderful it smells.  It&#x27;s so yummy.  And I have also very sensitive mature skin..so I was concerned about the fragrance factor.  However, this product is all natural and I experienced zero break-outs, my oily face did not get any worse by using this moisturizer and I was actually complimented a few times on how \\&quot;dewy\\&quot; my face looked (instead of how sallow when I just used the powder foundation).  And the SPF 40 protection is awesome without the irritation of the usual ingridients used in other products.    So all in all, I very much like this moisturizer and plan on purchasing the bigger size when I run out of the current one.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok, but I feel like it&#x27;s too small and too expensive to justify the cost.  I won&#x27;t be buying it again.</li>
    <li> I totally recommend this moisturizer w/ all-important sunscreen. My skin looks &amp; feels better and hydrated. The only problem is that I am now only able to find the small travel size, not the full size. Does anyone know where to find a big bottle?!!</li>
    <li> The quality of this sunscreen is worth it if you&#x27;re serious about investing in a gentle, natural, anti-aging daily regimen. It has a subtle, fruity scent and feels light on the skin when applied in moderation (a little goes a long way as the texture is a bit watery). It absorbs fairly quickly, allowing you to apply makeup without getting a cakey or greasy texture (I use either Bare Minerals or Lancome Teint Idole). I have acne-prone skin that easily gets congested and oily, but have not broken out at all since using this product every day for the past week. My makeup also stays put throughout the day so I&#x27;d say this sunscreen functions pretty well as a primer.</li>
    <li> This is very hydrating!  I actually have quite a few of her products.  Unfortunately, this product made my pores look huge!</li>
    <li> This product works well for me by giving plenty of continuous moisture &amp; protection in the cold weather. Also when I used it during the summer months it seemed to calm the redness my skin&lt;br /&gt;experiences during the heat of the season.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this all summer and will be using through the winter--hopefully it&#x27;s doing what it&#x27;s supposed to, seems to be!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love Josie maran after reading a favorite blog and the writer discussed her regimen, I thought to give this a try. My skin is neither too oily nor too dry except of course during the summer it tends to be more oily and winter more dry because, duh, that&#x27;s just the way things go. But otherwise, my skin can be very sensitive to break outs and cysts so I have to be very cautious when it comes to ingredients. This was a natural, smooth, great smelling moisturizer and SPF I could wear everyday. It helps me stay moisturized in the winter and drier in the summer. I read on Josie Marian&#x27;s website that they are locating to a larger facility and will be producing the larger bottles soon. Not soon enough I say! I love this stuff and definitely suggest it to anyone looking for a quality SPF and moisturizer.</li>
    <li> This is a great product.  Do yourself a favor, just buy the bigger bottle.  You will like it.  Buying anything less is a waste of time.</li>
    <li> Thank you for your prompt service.  I love the product.&lt;br /&gt;This is a good product. Would recommend it to others.</li>
    <li> This is the best sunscreen I can find that is natural and contains Argan Oil, which gives your skin a beautiful sheen.  I wish it came in a larger size.</li>
    <li> I think I expected more from this product because of all the hype surrounding argan oil. It&#x27;s not a bad product, just not as amazing as all the claims. I cannot use this on it&#x27;s own, it isn&#x27;t moisturizing enough for me. I layer it over my daily moisturizer. It functions well as a sunscreen and isn&#x27;t too heavy. I have had a few small break-outs since beginning to use this product, but that could be from something else. Overall, it&#x27;s a good sunscreen if you&#x27;re looking for something all natural.</li>
    <li> Great for all ages....This argan oil lotion is very light and not at all greasy.... Love the 40+ sunscreen protection!</li>
    <li> I am not sure how well it works yet for sun protection, since it is too cold to spend much time outdoors.  But I love how it feels when I use it.  Smells good, and makes my skin feel so soft, and not oily or dry at all. I will be buying again!</li>
    <li> Purchased this because the book \\&quot;Belli Beautiful\\&quot; recommended as being safer during pregnancy/nursing.  I love it.  Used it for the first time today.  Worked well under makeup. Will keep purchasing as a lifetime replacement for my former daytime daily face lotion/sunblock.</li>
    <li> Even though the bottle is small, you only need a little of this moisturizer. I use it in the mornings before I put on makeup and I love it.</li>
    <li> THE BEST SUNSCREEN EVER, NON GREASY, SMALL AMOUNT GOES A LONG WAY, STAYS ON ALL DAY.  EVERYONE HAS TO HAVE THIS I USE THIS WITH MY ARGON OIL UNDERNEATH MY MAKE-UP AND GIVES ME A GLOW AND BEAUTIFUL SKIN TO GO ABOUT MY DAY.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I RECOMMEND THIS FROM 15YRS OLD TO 100YRS OLD</li>
    <li> It is a shame that Josie Maran has discontinued this product. Besides being free of harmful chemicals it gives your skin a lovely, smooth glow. My favorite SPF of all times. Wish the company would bring it back!!</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin and like this product. It does not cause tingling or burning like some other products do. I like that it has physical sunscreens instead of chemical sunscreens.&lt;br /&gt;It has a nice pump dispenser. The consistency is not thick, which I like. It is pretty liquidy which allows me to spread it easily over my face. I lightly rub it into my face, doing portions at a time. It takes a minute or so to fully absorb. Then I apply a tinted foundation overtop. The result is very nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It does not make my face look shiny. It dries to an almost matte-like finish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It wears well throughout the day, although I am not exposed to a lot of sunlight given that it&#x27;s wintertime here where I am, and I stay indoors mostly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only thing I don&#x27;t like about it is the slightly flowery smell, which reminds me very much of the air freshener on planes. I could get used to it over time, though. Wish they would make it totally unfragranced.</li>
    <li> I don&#x60;t see any difference in my skin, just feel like any oil at the face.  nothing happen at face</li>
    <li> I like this and used it all up.&lt;br /&gt;Not much in there however and it goes fast.&lt;br /&gt;Glad it had SPF 40 as I have had skin cancer&lt;br /&gt;2 times on my face. I want to try some of her&lt;br /&gt;other products.</li>
    <li> I have very dry, sensitive skin.  It is rampantly upset with any new products and I break out in hives frequently just due to mere abrasion, much less any actual contaminant.  I was very worried to try a new product, but was recommended to the Josie Maran line through several sensitive skin websites.  The first time I tried this, the next day I had a slight reaction around my chin (this lead to the four star rating).  I waited a few days and tried again and had no issues.  It sits nicely, is not oily, and my face feels softer afterwards.  I am a real convert to the Josie line, as I still haven&#x27;t had a reaction to any of the products I have used (foundation, facial wash, moisturizer, blush).  My face feels softer and I haven&#x27;t had issues with facial discomfort (i.e., hives) since I began using the line.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years since I am very sensitive to fragrances and cosmetic products. BUT it is no longer available on Amazon or at stores - told they were reformulating it. Bring it back!!</li>
    <li> No any effect is dry to your skin with 0 result is like put your money to the trash i don no recumbent it</li>
    <li> This product is not greasy like most face lotion with sun screen.  It smells good.  The only downside is it is pricey for such a small amount.  And, the product I received was less than two months into expiring.  I&#x27;ll most likely look for an alternative in the future.</li>
    <li> I have used the Josie Maran argan oil by itself on my face and loved it, so when I found a product with SPF in it, I jumped! Well, after one use I broke out, and the pimple lasted for days. Tried it again a week or two later just to make sure and the same thing happened. I just stick to the plain old argan oil at night and use my old moisturizer with SPF during the day.</li>
    <li> I quickly fell in love with argan oil, so I wanted a moisturizer and a sunblock similar to this oil. This product smells good, but it has caused my skin to break out in small bumps. These are not allergy bumps...it seems my pores are clogged.  I have normal/combo skin and I am prone to breakouts. I haven&#x27;t been able to use Bare Minerals and products like that for the same reason.  Overall I think this is a good product, but it has clogged my pores so I probably won&#x27;t be using is anymore. :/</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s hard to find a non-chemical sunscreen that feels good going on, smells good and disappears into the skin.  This one is all that.  I wear it every day and love it.  I&#x27;ve used it for the last three years.  I had previously used a physical EltaMD sunscreen, but I found that it flaked when I touched my skin after the sunscreen dried.  I have sensitive skin and this sunscreen does not irritate my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish it weren&#x27;t so hard to find.  Months ago I was able to find it easily in travel and in a larger size.  Now it appears to be out of stock everywhere I check.  I hope it&#x27;s not being discontinued.</li>
    <li> I just love this moisturizer! I really noticed a difference the first day of wearing it..it evened out my skin tone a LOT and calmed down the redness I have from acne scars..it leaves me a tad bit shiny but nothing too crazy. Not greasy or anything. I&#x27;m not too crazy about the smell..like a sweet smell..but overall, I have pretty dry skin and it worked so well. I would DEFINITELY recommend this product.</li>
    <li> this product was definitely heavier than i would have liked; although, i never did make me break out. i liked how small it was, but i ran through it really quickly because it feels more like a sunscreen than a face lotion. if you are looking for a lighter sunscreen, try Reformulated Dry Touch Sunscreen by CorrectiveSkinCare. it&#x27;s expensive, but lasts FOREVER and is the best i&#x27;ve found (and i&#x27;ve been looking for years). here&#x27;s the link: [...]</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing. I have ultra sensitive, combo skin. Finding a good SPF that is natural seems impossible. Not only does the lotion smell fantastic, but it absorbs nicely into your skin without leaving an oily residue. PERFECT!</li>
    <li> This sun protection is great. Even though it&#x27;s oil it goes on like silk and sinks into the skin leaving no shine or slick feeling.  I wear every day and it&#x27;s especially good for long day in the sun.  Protection and great moisture. The only con is the pump puts out too much so I just open the bottle and take the amount I want so not to waste any.  The price is fair and I&#x27;m glad I purchased!!</li>
