<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> After trying dozens of natural mouthwashes, I am happy to say that this one actually leaves your mouth feeling clean. Coming from someone who has very sensitive teeth and gums, you can imagine the frustration in looking for something that doesn&#x27;t hurt. Most products have alcohol in them, or preservatives and obviously you don&#x27;t want that in your mouth, goes straight into the bloodstream so... Finally one that works without the bad stuff!</li>
    <li> This mouthwash is my favorite. It feels so fresh and I love the fact that it&#x27;s natural ingredients.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a mouthwash the last couple of months and this is by far the best mouthwash I&#x27;ve come across. I was skeptical about the taste of the sea salt, but once I tried it I loved it. It reminded me of the times my grandma and mom told me to gargle with mouthwash!</li>
    <li> I used to have tons of teeth/gum problems, and I have tried every different kind of mouth wash. This mouthwash stopped all the pain I was having. Highly recommended. I never usually write reviews, but tbh this product compelled me!</li>
    <li> This is the best mouthwash around!</li>
    <li> This stuff is fantastic. Being a person who is boarder-line crazy about my teeth... having a mouthwash that has NO sugar &amp; preservatives..is beyond great. Chemicals suck. Oral essentials rules. My teeth and gums thank me.</li>
    <li> The rinse is amazing!&lt;br /&gt;Usually mouth washes have a &amp;#34;stinging&amp;#34; like..intense taste. Yet with oral essentials your getting an all natural comforting swish;).&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m completely happy with my choice. I used to use Crest or Listerine, but I&#x27;ll never buy those again.</li>
    <li> Was recommended to try this from a friend and was skeptical at first to try a new mouth wash. After the first couple days, It was hard to go back to my old mouthwash without noticing a big difference. My store bought mouthwash has become extremely strong after using Oral Essentials, and after looking at the ingredients, I realized there was actually sugar in my old mouthwash, which makes nosense to me at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I definitely recommend this mouthwash to anyone who wants something that isn&#x27;t too strong, and harsh to actually use, and wants something made with natural ingredients, from an actual dentist.</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive teeth and gums and have not been able to use mouth wash because of how badly it would burn my mouth.  A friend of mine recommended Oral Essentials mouth wash and I am so grateful.  I am able to finally use mouth wash!  It doesn&#x27;t burn and my mouth feels so clean and refreshed after I use it.  My kids like to use it too and that makes me happy to know they are taking good care of their teeth and gums.  Amazing product!</li>
    <li> Really nice mouthwash! Beats the heck out of putting some minty alcohol stuff in your mouth! Recommend.</li>
    <li> We received our order last week,&lt;br /&gt;This is the first time that my 7 &amp; 9 year old sons are using the mouth wash every night without my reminders. They like the taste and that is important I am sure it will improve their results at the dentist office.&lt;br /&gt;As for me, I like the fact that all ingredients are natural,  researched and selected by a dentist. It does not have the harsh taste that some other products have and I will continue using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kevin M.</li>
    <li> I like this product and I am happy it&#x27;s around to buy and use.&lt;br /&gt;Since I am very much conscious about GMO and Non Organic products, It is so nice to not have the harsh chemicals (Alcohol) in your mouth early in the morning , I&#x27;ve felt a huge difference freshness of my teeth, mouth, and breath since I started using. I agree It&#x27;s a little bit more cost since you pay for shipping but it worth every penny!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this mouthwash is great,  I love how my mouth feels after wash and taste of Dead Sea Salt !  Wow! I am a Fan.</li>
    <li> This is a great product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have sensitive teeth/gums and was looking for an all natural mouth wash. After a friend recommend I try this product, I am very satisfied with my purchase. It&#x27;s all natural and great for people looking for a &amp;#34;smooth&amp;#34; tasting alternative to other products out there.</li>
    <li> I love this mouthwash! It doesn&#x27;t taste like chemicals and isn&#x27;t dyed like big-name mouthwashes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like that it has only ingredients that need to be in there, instead of a bunch of preservatives and bad stuff. It tastes really nice too, not too strong, and the taste really grows on you the more you use it. It uses Xylitol as sweetener, which is cool because that&#x27;s been shown to have dental benefits. It also has some organic ingredients!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope this mouthwash finds its way onto grocery store shelves (if it hasn&#x27;t already), so more people can use this instead of other chemical-filled ones. It would be perfect for Whole Foods and Sprouts, whose public are often health-conscientious and care about organic, natural, and overall healthy products.</li>
    <li> Good product. however the bottle last a week.</li>
    <li> I wanted to try out an alternative to my alcohol mouthwash that I was using.  I had heard from a friend that she had used this and liked it.  So I bought a bottle.  I was pleasantly surprised.  With the big L mouthwash, I could only swish it in my mouth for a little before having to spit out because of the stinging. This one, because it is non alcoholic and uses salt, was easy to keep swishing and cleaning my mouth.  It leaves my mouth refreshed.  I recommend it as an alternative if looking for a healthier option for oral care.</li>
    <li> Not very strong, a good after brushing mouthwash.</li>
    <li> Overall, the product is really good,&lt;br /&gt;I hope to use when traveling or business trip</li>
    <li> WOW. Can&#x27;t say enough great things about this product. Best mouthwash I&#x27;ve come across! So happy to have found a product that is not only alcohol/preservative free, but does such an incredible job.</li>
    <li> I wanted a mouthwash that did not have alcohol in it as recently there have been report that it can contribute to mouth cancer.  So having this on the market was just what was needed.  Very pleasant taste and worth the price if you want something natural with no sugar or alcohol in it.  Well done</li>
    <li> This product is so awesome! I have been searching for a mouthwash which was effective and had a good taste/aftertaste. Most mouthwashes are just too strong or taste too fake. This product works really well and it has a good, real flavor/aftertaste.</li>
    <li> This is a great product! I love that it&#x27;s preservative and alcohol free. I recommend to all.</li>
    <li> This works perfect for my son... after an extraction, the normal mouthwashes are too harsh.</li>
    <li> The best mouthwash, I&#x27;ve tried to date!  All natural and chemical free.  I was relieved of any irritation, I had experienced with other name products.  A 5 star rating by far!</li>
    <li> Feels completely refreshing, but without the normal mouthwash feeling of chemicals. Kind of the best of both worlds. Very happy.</li>
    <li> Great product.  Leaves my mouth fresh without any harmful ingredients.  Will be a return customer for certain.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this mouthwash. Leaves my mouth feeling clean and refreshed!</li>
    <li> This is a 5 star product but I had to deduct one star because of the price and its 16oz bottle size. I have to buy two bottles to have a month supply. One bottle only lasts 16 days if you use a tablespoon twice a day. Amazon needs to make this part of subscribe &amp; save. I know this is an excellent mouthwash but $40 a month just for mouthwash is a bit much.</li>
    <li> Great mouthwash. Very effective and much easier to use than products with alcohol. I have began following the dental program recommend ed by Dr. Preston Price. 99% of commercially available dental care products contain harsh chemicals, glycerin and other ingredients that prevent your teeth from absorbing minerals from our foods and supplements. No wonder children have so many cavities today. It takes glycerin almost a month to wear off. Not good. My grandparents had great teeth in to their 80&#x27;s only brushing with banking g soda and the essential oils like the ones in Oral Essentials. Toothpaste and mouthwash companies that make Crest, Colgate, etc. make billions of dollars and I find it sad. Thank you to Oral Essentials!!</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful product. No burning and leaves my mouth feeling clean and fresh for hours.</li>
    <li> Several months back a men&#x27;s magazine ran a story about 5 different mouthwashes, pros and cons of each, and their effect on one&#x27;s oral hygiene. I bought all 5--an expensive proposition given that several of them were of the artisanal variety. After several months of working my way through all 5 and researching their ingredients, Oral Essentials won out. Non-alcoholic, it leaves a clean finish--one of the first mouthwashes I&#x27;ve ever been able to use that doesn&#x27;t require me to water rinse after. I was particularly impressed with no sugars, dyes, or preservatives, and intrigued about using dead sea salt to enhance my oral hygiene (and I&#x27;ve been aware of the positive properties of xylitol for years). Most importantly I suppose, is that my mouth smells better (an embarrassing admission but true). I thank Oral Essentials for that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sigh, I just hope it doesn&#x27;t get bought out. Best of luck Justin.</li>
    <li> awesome mouthwash.  really great flavor and great effects.  brought it to my office for after lunch and it works very well.  will invest in more shortly for the at home use as well.  well done making this product.</li>
    <li> Fantastic!!! My family is on an extremely restrictive diet due to chronic health issues and with a recent nasal medication my 6 year old son was put on his  breath was HORRIBLE!!! This mouthwash was allowed on our diet &amp; his breath smells amazing! I&#x27;m using the mouthwash as well and really like it:) Thank you so much Oral Essentials for taking pride in producing a product that using real ingredients that are not harmful!</li>
    <li> Once I got use to the taste I liked it.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent mouthwash. It doesn&#x27;t leave that &amp;#34;sting&amp;#34; you get with Listerene. But it does leave your mouth feeling clean.</li>
    <li> I love this mouthwash! Great flavor, lasts a long time. Will definitely reorder!</li>
    <li> Great taste, no sting and mouth feels refreshed! It is the only product I use that actually makes my mouth feel good after using it. I think it is also the only mouthwash out there with Dead Sea slat. I love it so much I could use it 10 times a day.</li>
    <li> AMAZING!!! I don&#x27;t usually write reviews but could not resist writing one for the rinse.  I used crappy supermarket brand mouthwash&#x27;s for years.  Now I know the difference.  Oral Essentials leaves my mouth feeling clean and fresh without the nasty burning and stinging feeling that most super market brand mouthwash&#x27;s do.  It also has better ingredients rather than being pumped with alcohol and chemicals like other brands.  I HIGHLY recommend this product!!!!!</li>
    <li> Great mouthwash! Im about halfway through my first bottle and I will definitely buy it again. There is no stinging and it really feels good using a mouthwash that is alcohol and preservative free. My mouth feels fresher longer than with my precious product. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> Great alternative mouthwash option! My to go to mouthwash now!</li>
    <li> Super solid product, makes a big difference, much better than regular stuff you get at store.</li>
    <li> I am super picky about my mouthwash and I have finally found the one that is perfect.  It&#x27;s not too sweet and leaves your breath so fresh for hours.  Love it!! Will definitely be reordering.  Thank you x</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used the product that much yet. But from what I have experienced, the mouthwash is not overly strong, which I really like. My mouth and breathe does feel fresh to me, but I haven&#x27;t asked anyone else.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe I happened to have found this mouthwash.  I have been looking for one without fluoride for a long time.  It is a perfect follow up for the toothpaste I use with xylitol.  I read a book recently on how to have great dental checkups and understand that xylitol is very beneficial for maintaining healthy enamel.  It is very refreshing and clean tasting and I definitely will be purchasing this product again.</li>
    <li> Good shipment and Good quality</li>
    <li> I purchased this product because I was looking for something natural and not full of chemicals. I am very happy with this product. Nice minty taste and leaves my mouth feeling clean and fresh. Feels good knowing what the ingredients are. Would definately recommend and purchase again.</li>
    <li> My dentist recommended Oral Essentials so I decided to give it a try. I was having a lot of inflammation in my gums and this seems to be helping a lot! Very gentle- no burning sensation like a lot of other mouthwashes. I would definitely recommend this!</li>
    <li> This is the best mouthwash I&#x27;ve ever tried.  I use only natural products, so am glad to find something that works so beautifully to keep my breath and mouth clean, fresh and healthy!</li>
    <li> This is the 3rd bottle I’m ordering. I was looking for a good mouthwash that will give me a thorough clean and refreshing feeling without the alcohol, sugar and other artificial ingredients. This product fulfilled everything on my wish list. The first bottle was for me, my family also tried and they all loved it! Delivery is super-fast so I do not have to worry about running out.</li>
    <li> Very nice and good concept for small children and other pople who love sugerfree and alcohol free , alcohol make you mouth dry and suger again start creating bectaria</li>
    <li> Excellent natural mouth wash! Will buy again for sure</li>
    <li> No strong scents or tastes.  Just a light mint flavor and quality ingredients.  I am a Natural Health Professional always seeking out the best natural products.  This is one of them.&lt;br /&gt;Amazon, make sure you always carry this mouthwash.  Please!!</li>
    <li> Absolutely one of the most amazing mouthwashes I&#x27;ve ever used! There are no chemicals, and there is no burning like you would feel while using a cheap mouthwash. I am all for using all natural ingredients and using those store bought products just doesn&#x27;t cut it for me, others use chemicals that are bad for your teeth and gums. Why would you buy something that can harm you? This great product is my savior, finally a great tasting mouthwash that is actually good for me!Great taste. I would highly recommend this product to people of all ages</li>
    <li> Excellent.  Money, for me, like most customers is a rare commodity and Oral Essentials Mouthwash is worth every penny.  Gums are smoother and healthier.  I like the taste and the after taste as well.  I showed the product to a local dentist in Utah and he was quite impressed; &amp;#34;keep using it,&amp;#34; was his recommendation.  I just ordered three new bottles to take advantage of the free shipping this month.  I know, I don&#x27;t want to have to live without it.</li>
    <li> Great taste and no medicine after taste. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> Loving this so far. It leaves your mouth clean without that burning minty taste that other mouthwashes have.  It has a surprisingly good flavor as well.</li>
    <li> I have to use an inhaler and must thoroughly rinse my mouth afterwards. Listerine was too harsh and the other mouthwashes irritated my mouth also. My son&#x27;s dentist had him use this product 3 times a day when he was having extensive cosmetic dental work. When you spend $40,000 you don&#x27;t use inferior products and this mouthwash was recommended. It does not irritate your mouth and contains no harmful chemicals. There is a taste challenge because we have conditioned ourselves to the minty toothpaste and mouthwash. I am getting used to the different taste and do not experience any irritation from using it after brushing my teeth and tongue.</li>
    <li> The best mouthwash I ever spent money on, it&#x27;s a more natural rinse then a bunch of stuff that&#x27;s not good for your teeth and mouth. I will buy more I hope, if they still carry this mouth wash or even get different flavors. Good job to this company, thank you.</li>
    <li> This is great stuff!  I have noticed my gums are pinker and I love that I am not filling my mouth with chemicals.  It doesn&#x27;t burn at all.  I will keep buying this.</li>
    <li> My teeth is like this</li>
    <li> Very nice, no alcohol!</li>
    <li> We&#x27;ve been enjoying this great tasting mouth wash. Leaves a definite fresh feeling in the mouth without being harsh. The flavor is quite minty, mildly salty, and very pleasant. Happy to find a mouthwash with so few ingredients and that doesn&#x27;t leave one&#x27;s mouth feeling coated or slippery after use, like so many other natural mouthwashes do.</li>
    <li> Taste is still pretty good, despite it being better ingredients. Really nice aftertaste especially. Makes my mouth feel nice and clean!</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. Doesn&#x27;t overwhelm me the way most big name mouth washes do and keeps my mouth feeling clean for much longer.</li>
    <li> -- and I&#x27;ve tried so many.  I have a problem with chronic canker sores, and continued use of this keeps them under control.</li>
    <li> Feels completely refreshing,</li>
    <li> Excellent flavor. Feels fresh after every use. Sometimes I rinse before brushing, sometimes after. My tongue feels great, though, and my breath stays fresh for a very long time. Very natural, kissable sensation. ;)</li>
    <li> All natural ingredients, with a great after taste! Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> A very nice mouthwash! Its not filled with chemicals you can&#x27;t pronounce. Not burning, it leaves your mouth feeling fresh.</li>
    <li> I love this product! It has no medicine taste and helps my mouth feel sparkling clean. the fact that it is alcohol and preservative free is an extreme plus especially in this day when we are learning so much about additives in all types of products. Being gluten free and cruelty free are personal favorites for me.  I</li>
    <li> It should be stored in a clear white bottle because of the essential oils</li>
    <li> We love this I pray we can get it on amazon again!</li>
    <li> Best mouthwash I&#x27;ve ever used, great alternative to all of the average mouthwashes you&#x27;re used to seeing. Feels great, tastes great, the best mouthwash out there.</li>
    <li> Great product.&lt;br /&gt;The wife and I love it</li>
    <li> I really like this mouthwash.It works well and give me a lot of convience!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m on a very strict diet so this mouthwash  is perfect for me! I&#x27;m supposed to avoid sugar, chemical preservatives and gluten. It&#x27;s been hard to find anything made without all three. I was very excited that it excludes these things, and it actually tastes good too. Finally!</li>
    <li> I really like that this is all natural. I had never thought about my mouthwash and what was in it. All sorts of dyes and flavorings. Gross! I&#x27;ve been doing a purge, switching over to more natural cleaners and products and finding this mouthwash was just fantastic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also like that there are some great ingredients in here. So many mint oils as well as sea salt, which I have always heard is great to gargle with, and aloe vera, which, lets face it, is pretty much the miracle healer! And the mouthwash being super mild is great! No more mouth on fire just to convince yourself it is working. This is dentist formulated, not just dentist approved, so I know it&#x27;s great for my pearly whites, too!</li>
    <li> We&#x27;ve been using Aesop and thought that it was a bit pricey so went online to look for an economical yet natural alternative. This is a wonderful mouthwash and we continue to have good oral hygiene - yay!</li>
    <li> It taste good.  I&#x27;m not sure how effective it is as a mouthwash bacteria wise.  It&#x27;s a great breath freshener. Little bottle for the price and wouldn&#x27;t purchase again.  It goes way too quick.</li>
    <li> Great product, great service!</li>
    <li> This is an amazing mouthwash! I have been looking for something that doesn&#x27;t contain alcohol in it and a big plus with oral essentials - no preservatives!  It leaves your mouth feeling fresh and minty. I really recommend this product for people that are looking for a fresh feeling mouthwash that at the sometime helps with cavities and gum disease!</li>
    <li> A must for Dental hygiene. Alcohol free. Nothing but natural ingredients  An amazing alternative to what&#x27;s out there on the shelves at your local pharmacy. Take the time to check this product out. You will not be disappointed.</li>
    <li> This is a fantastic mouthwash! I wanted something natural and alcohol free and this fit the bill very nicely. It doesn&#x27;t burn my mouth the way that the regular types does. I will be ordering this again.</li>
    <li> This is a great mouth rinse! No alcohol, no saccharin. All natural and mild. I&#x27;ll definitely be ordering more soon.</li>
    <li> Excellent mouthwash! I love that it is alcohol &amp; preservative free with an impressive list of healthy ingredients. It doesn&#x27;t burn or taste toxic in your mouth but gives you a fresh clean feeling. I will definitely continue to use this product going forward.</li>
    <li> Tastes great, actually works on mouth soars as well.</li>
    <li> Great product - mouth has never felt fresher!!</li>
    <li> Very tasty and feels so natural, clean!</li>
    <li> I have been searching for a mouthwash this amazing for a long time! I cannot say enough about how thrilled I am to have discovered this! have tried numerous other brands that claim to be the best and have always been disappointed. These guys finally got it right!! I work in an organic grocery store and have seen them all. Believe me when I say for the price and for what this mouthwash does you cannot find a better product out there. After using it your mouth feels completely refreshed and clean but without any weird chemical after taste. Try it and you will not be disappointed.</li>
    <li> Great item, just like description, what i want.&lt;br /&gt;highly recommended.</li>
    <li> great, fast delivered</li>
    <li> I love the ingredients. Wondering if my kids could use it to prevent cavities.</li>
    <li> The best mouthwash I&#x27;ve ever used. It doesnt burn, it tastes great, leaves my mouth feeling clean and not over salivating like alcohol mouthwashes tend to make it. My breath is fresh but not &amp;#34;Listerene&amp;#34; breath where you just stink like mint. Love it!</li>
    <li> Oral Essentials mouthwash is an excellent product and I am very happy to have found it.  My periodontist recommended I use it and says that doing so has improved the condition of my gums in 3 months.  The taste is very refreshing without the usual strong flavor of the more commercial mouthwashes or salt and water.  It doesn&#x27;t leave a strong after taste or colored tongue.  Oral Essentials does what I think a mouthwash should do.  It takes care of your mouth and leaves a subtle pleasant and refreshing flavor.  I now consider this my regular mouthwash.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this mouth wash.  It leaves you with fresh breath and easily one of the nicest mouthwashes I have used.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried a lot of mouthwashes in my life, mostly because I&#x27;m meticulous about having clean teeth and dental hygiene. This, by far, is the best mouth wash I&#x27;ve ever tried. It doesn&#x27;t have the alcohol and deleterious chemicals that &amp;#34;name brands&amp;#34; have that result in more harm than good. Instead, this mouthwash sticks to healthy ingredients that make me feel good every time i rinse - not like I&#x27;m poisoning myself with the other, drugstore brands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I give this mouthwash a super recommendation!</li>
    <li> Love the product, will reorder again.</li>
    <li> It has a nice mild natural flavor and there isn&#x27;t any stinging like other mouthwash, which I really like. It leaves my mouth feeling refreshed without feeling like it&#x27;s full of synthetic chemicals.</li>
    <li> Love this mouthwash. It taste really yummy and leaves my mouth feeling so clean. It doesn&#x27;t burn and it doesn&#x27;t have that chemical feel. I crave this stuff!</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Finally someone comes out with a healthy mouthwash.</li>
    <li> Love this mouthwash! I try to avoid chemical ingredients so I love that it&#x27;s all natural, but still feels just as fresh and clean as using the more harsh kinds that contain alcohol. Also it doesn&#x27;t burn and make my eyes water like the ones filled with chemicals! Definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> Very good flavor and fresh feeling only thing is that it could fight bacteria a bit better but you can&#x27;t ask for everything when trying to cut out alcohol and glycerin from your mouth wash so that considered its really good!</li>
    <li> I used to use the mouthwashes that are supposed to keep your breath fresh all day. Not only do they not work, but when you read the ingredients, you start to realize how bad they really are for you. Crazy how these big companies (and even dentists) keep trying to tell us how much we need them when in reality it&#x27;s all marketing with millions of dollars behind it. I&#x27;d rather keep chemicals out of my mouth and digestive system. That&#x27;s why oral essentials is great. Keeps your breath fresh, and only one I&#x27;ve come across that really is all natural.</li>
    <li> I use other brands mouth washes almost everyday because of my mouth brace. This product tops all the other ones I have used. I like it that is organic and has no alcohol.</li>
    <li> This is a great mouthwash for soothing my irritated mouth!  My dry spot cough has disappeared and the dry irritated feeling in my mouth is much improved!  I expected this to taste bad but have been pleasantly surprised!  Thanks for a great product!!</li>
    <li> Great product. Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I love the taste and how it makes my mouth feel. I battle with bad breath daily and this is so far the best rinse I have used. I just startedmy first bottle so I will report back with the long term results.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product! I am sure I will purchase again!</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t vouch for any of the &amp;#34;natural&amp;#34; qualities or manufacturer claims, but this has a good flavor and seems to work just as well as the alcohol based mouthwashes I have used.</li>
    <li> I have a love hate relationship with mouthwash. I like to freshen my breath and make my mouth healthier but I hate the burning as I try to swish for the amount of time I am supposed to, my eyes start to water. Its really crazy. I love that the Oral Essentials Mouthwash is alcohol-free. I get the refreshed feeling without the pain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have started to really find the value of essential oils and dead sea salts lately. I have learned that they can serve in so many healing purposes, many have multiple functions. I never really thought much about how chemicals are absorbed right into our systems through our mouth until I have recently started using dissolvable under the tongue vitamins for my upcoming bariatric surgery. With this product I am not worried that I will be putting harmful chemicals into my body or that I will be swishing around mouthwash that contains sugar(kinda defeats the purpose)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I received product for free in exchange for an honest review, which may differ from yours. Regardless, I only recommend products or services I used personally, and believe in.</li>
    <li> Very good product! Tastes and feels fresh.</li>
    <li> I like having a fresh feeling in my mouth.&lt;br /&gt;I use this after I brush my teeth and flossing.</li>
    <li> Nice taste, effective, you know it&#x27;s working...</li>
    <li> Its the best thing ever... Picture washing your mouth with liquid chewing gum (best way I can explain the taste)</li>
    <li> good quality!! exceeds my expectations!!</li>
    <li> Really it&#x27;s an awesome item many thanks ...👍🏻</li>
    <li> Takes a little getting used to, it&#x27;s so different from the more commercial mouthwashes.  It doesn&#x27;t have that &amp;#34;tingle&amp;#34; you get say, with Scope.  But there is an astringent effect that helps make your mouth feel cleaner.  The flavor is minty, but not overwhelming.  I needed an alcohol -free mouthwash, and I&#x27;ll be buying this one again.</li>
    <li> This mouthwash keeps my breathe fresh for hours and the fact that it is made of natural ingredients is another positive aspect of this product. I would recommend this product to anyone who wants to stop using fluoride mouthwash and start using a more healthy alternative. I don&#x27;t know if this will make my teeth stronger but I am falling in love with this mouthwash and I will buy again.</li>
    <li> Pretty good, doesn&#x27;t burn as much as other over the counter stuff.</li>
    <li> I really like this Oral Essential mouthwash product. After reviewing it favorably today, I accidentally pressed the unsubscribe and be sent nothing else click disclaimer on this wonderful product featuring dead sea salt in it. Please send Oral Essentials e-mails to me via Amazon or whatever... I am eager to re-order your product, but am having trouble doing so especially probably now that I unsubscribed to Oral Essential e-mails by mistake. Please show this to the always mysterious Amazon hierarchy so I can find out where to purchase OE.... Thanks, IjL</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d given up on mouthwashes until I saw the reviews on Amazon. I love the clean taste without the alcoholic flavor.</li>
    <li> This brand was simply okay and nothing really special. I would recommend for people to pick up a regular antiseptic and then some sort of natural rinse to keep their mouth at a good PH.</li>
    <li> Not loaded with chemicals and great taste! Highly recommend! Great buy, good stuff!</li>
    <li> I love this new mouthwash! So nice to know that I&#x27;m not ingesting a bunch of chemicals anymore in my mouthwash!!!</li>
    <li> I love this mouthwash! It tastes great, leaves my mouth feeling clean &amp; refreshed, and I know it&#x27;s a safe product with all natural ingredients.</li>
    <li> I have had a rough go at keeping my teeth healthy. No matter how careful I am, I still have receding gums and cavities, which means sensitivity. Most mouthwashes irritate my gums and teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But this Oral Essentials product is fantastic, gentle and most importantly, all natural. I don&#x27;t worry about putting chemicals into my body with this mouthwash. Tastes good (not fake) and leaves a very clean feeling. Glad I found it!</li>
