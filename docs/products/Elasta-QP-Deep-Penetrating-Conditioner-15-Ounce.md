      <li>great conditioner, it makes your hair super soft and thick.</li>
      <li>but got it right the second time after a light protein treatment.</li>

      <li>I used this with my hair steamer and rinsed with cold water and my hair feels wonderful.</li>
      <li>It is very moisturizing and also it has lots and lots of slip.</li>
      <li>I could really tell the difference on my hair.</li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re a natural this is the go to conditioner!!!</li>
      <li>To early to to right know.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve never been so pleased to have such a quick solution to my dry hair problems.</li>
      <li>one of the deep conditioners I use for my hair regimen makes my hair feel super soft after using it</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I absolutely love this product! Ive been using it once a week for 4 weeks and it has really worked for me. My hair is softer, growing faster, and healthier than ever before. I also use the Elasta QP conditioner, leave-in conditioner, shampoo, moisturizer and scalp oil (the entire product line). I am very glad I chose to invest in this product.</li>
    <li> I just started my natural hair journey about a year now and I am loving it. It has been a challenged but at this present time I am glad that I made the choice. I have used different products and since I like to experiment with my hair I decided to try the Elasta QP DPR + which was rated by one youtuber and she said so much great things about it. Therefore I decided to try it and honestly I LOVE LOVE THIS PODUCT and I am going to make it one of my staple deep conditioners. This product makes my hair very very very soft, keep it moisturize. You need to try this for yourself then you will totally understand what I am trying to say.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks&lt;br /&gt;Shalote</li>
    <li> I used this product once a week for 3 weeks in a row (or until product was finished) , didn&#x27;t repurchase because I didn&#x27;t see any difference in my hair. I gave it 3 stars because at least it didn&#x27;t dry my hair out like some of those other deep conditioners. It just left it feeling the same. (I am a 4b natural.)</li>
    <li> great conditioner, it makes your hair super soft and thick. it detangles my hair pretty easy and makes it shine, absolutely  recommend this conditioner.</li>
    <li> Good conditioner, but did not work for me at all, my hair is very think and coarse and it wasn&#x27;t for me.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this deep conditioner. It is very moisturizing and also it has lots and lots of slip. It is very light and the smell is not overwhelming at all. I love it and I am so glad I purchased it. Great conditioning treatment. You will be satisfied.</li>
    <li> My daughter has 4C hair and this miracle conditioner immediately detangles her luscious locks so that I can actually comb it without any hollering.  I&#x27;m almost out and will definitely be purchasing again and keep this in her hair care routine.</li>
    <li> I purchase this conditioner for my mom and I hair. We&#x27;re both black women with natural hair. This is a great conditioner. It has a lot of slip and it helps you detangle as well! It left our hair soft to the touch and well moisturized! If you&#x27;re a natural this is the go to conditioner!!!</li>
    <li> I love this stuff! one of the deep conditioners I use for my hair regimen makes my hair feel super soft after using it</li>
    <li> Good price. Higher at other places.</li>
    <li> So i  was excited when i purchased this product because i thought it would be great on my hair plus i have the leave in conditioner and curl enhancer. Boy was i wrong i got no slip with this product and it made my hair harder to detangle. I didnt see any results my and i feel like it left my hair dried out. I tried mixing it with oil oil no bueno, i also mixed it with other conditioners and it was still a no go. Its a bummer becasue i love the leave in conditioner but i guess everyones hair reacts differntly with different products.</li>
    <li> I love this product. I also mix a Garnier Fructis deep moisture oil into it. I&#x27;ve used it twice now to soften up new growth (trying to stretch the relaxer) and the first time I made the mistake of leaving it on too long (which actually just weakens your hair!) but got it right the second time after a light protein treatment. I left it on without heat for about an hour and it made my hair much more manageable!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend this deep conditioner!</li>
    <li> I have used this for years.  the DPR-11+ conditioner is the best for leaving hair shiny, soft, managable, and strong.  I use this on my color treated and relaxed hair, usually about twice a month. I find that I don&#x27;t have to add oils to this conditioner like I usually have to with others.  I usually use this on a weekend evening when I can just put it on and leave it under a plastic cap whiile I am sleeping.  This conditioner stops all breakage for me, and this is great because I do heat style my hair.  This keeps my ends from splitting.</li>
    <li> THEY STOPPED SELLING IT LOCALLY.  IM SO THANKFUL I FOUND IT HERE.  I BOUGHT 6 JARS.  ITS MAGIC.  NOTHING ELSE IS AS GOOD.  NOT EVEN THE NEW MANGO BUTTER.  PLEASE GOD I NEED THIS STUFF FOREVER!!! I DONT KNOW WHAT IMA DO IF I CANT FIND IT HERE.  IM GONNA BUY MORE SOON.</li>
    <li> For starters: Relaxed hair -- 6 weeks post; unsure of the texture but midrange (not to coarse not too soft)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had a baby not too long ago and have had NO time for hair care. I was one of those girls that had every single product, spent hours under the dryer and steamer with conditioners and oils and this and that. My hair grew like wildflowers, but it was so much work. Now as a new mom and an attorney, I have no time for all of that. I just want my hair to be soft, moisturized, and healthy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was one of the conditioners that I tried but passed over for the new new thing after using it only once. Two days ago, I was straightening out my bathroom cabinet when I saw this full container and wondered why I didn&#x27;t use much of it. I washed my hair with whatever I had -- again, no time to be specific about anything! -- and put this in while I played with my baby for an hour or two. I didn&#x27;t do anything special, just plopped my hair on top of my head and baggied it in a bun. I waited for my husband to get home so that I could rinse it out in the shower and OMG! The slip was fannnnntastic. I literally said outloud &amp;#34;Wait, what just happened?!&amp;#34; I got all of this moisture from just baggying?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I airdried my hair (basically I fell asleep so I didn&#x27;t have time to do anything else) with just some serum and the next day I blowdried the roots and flat ironed it. I&#x27;ve never been so pleased to have such a quick solution to my dry hair problems. When I say it looks like I have a fresh relaxer -- I mean it! Hopefully, I&#x27;ll be able to wash my hair more than twice a month (gaaaassspppp I know!) so that it can retain this level of moisture. I&#x27;m very pleased.</li>
    <li> Great moisturizing deep conditioner. It smells great too. I mix it with a few other oils and allow to sit in my hair for a few hours. After washing it out my hair feels soft and moisturized.</li>
    <li> The best &amp; only product that keeps my hair moisturized! I can use it on wet/dry hair, as my leave-in, as my styling creme. You name it, it does it</li>
    <li> I loved it! My hair has more moisture and soo soft since I&#x27;ve been using it! The best part you don&#x27;t use a lot so it last for awhile.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t leave it in too long (longer than half an hour) or it will leave a horrendous wax like coating on your hair. I had to rewash my hair twice to get it all out. Such a disappointment, especially for a deep conditioner. Otherwise just an ok product. Just be careful!</li>
    <li> one of the ingredients i must have over looked it had petroleum in it. definitely not a staple</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t expect this to be a leave-in product</li>
    <li> This has got to be the best product I&#x27;ve ever used in my hair. It keeps it moisturized when I deep condition my dry hair also sometimes I will leave a little in as a leave-in for extra moisture, it smells really good and has a great consistency. I must have give through my 5th jar by now</li>
    <li> I could really tell the difference on my hair. I left it on for 25 min with a shower cap. Made my hair super soft and I have coarse thick hair</li>
    <li> This deep conditioner is AMAZING! I have natural african-american COILY hair. After using this product my hair is now silky and CURLY. I am blown away by the results of this product on my hair. I was struggling with frizzy twist-outs, but no more! I also use the soy oil deep conditioner, moisture shampoo and moisturizer. They ALL work fabulously well and I am sooooo in love with my hair.</li>
    <li> I love this product I use it every 2 weeks to do a deep conditioner for my hair. I would recommend it to anyone :)</li>
    <li> I have 4b natural hair and this product is great for relaxed ladies, but it definitely didn&#x27;t work for me anymore. Oh well.</li>
    <li> To early to to right know. I only used it once, i an going  to used it as a prepoo.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m AA woman with natural hair and this did nothing for my hair, it was a complete waste of money.</li>
    <li> I love this deep conditioner.It leaves my hair feeling soft and silky and it smells great. I mix it with some glycerol and my favorite oils and I just LOVE LOVE LOVE IT .. I would recommend it for a moisturizing deep conditioner. I used it on all my family this Christmas.. natural and relaxed and they all loved it .. It made my cousins Natural hair so soft and Manageable.</li>
    <li> I love how this product smells and that it&#x27;s really thick, it makes me feel like it&#x27;s moisturizing. I&#x27;m currently using many things in my hair, including this every other week. Idk if it has any specific effect, but my hair is healthy, strong and growing rapidly so it&#x27;s not hurting. I&#x27;m a 4c natural and stopped flat ironing my hair so that plus this product is helping with my hair growth. I use it with organic coconut shampoo, a protein treatment and the elasta q moisturizing mango butter leave in, which smells great too.</li>
    <li> I used this product twice so far, I think it left my hair soft but my only problem with it is that when I tried to mix my oils (olive oil, coconut oil and pimento oil), it separated and clumped up. I guess you are not supposed to mix anything with it. I&#x27;ll try it again without the oils to see if it still leaves my hair soft and doesn&#x27;t produce any breakage.</li>
    <li> Best deep conditioner I have tried and smells fabulous. I used this with my hair steamer and rinsed with cold water and my hair feels wonderful.</li>
    <li> Not great for me personally.  It left a thick coat on my hair and scalp that I did not appreciate.  Felt a little like wax.</li>
    <li> Read plenty of reviews from people who raved about this product, but it dried the mess out of my hair unfortunately.</li>
    <li> Great product.my hair loves it.</li>
    <li> This is the best conditioning treatment I ever used. My hair was soft and bouncy.  It&#x27;s is a must have for any type of hair. I love it</li>
    <li> I really wanted to like this product only because I heard such good things about the brand. I was gravely disappointed. The way my hair was before the conditioner, is the way my hair was 15 minutes after. I&#x27;m sticking to the ORS brand that makes my hair happy :-)</li>
