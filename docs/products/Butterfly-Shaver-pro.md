<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> My wife loves it. Works exactly as stated.</li>
    <li> OMG I so love this razor! It&#x27;s easy to use and clean! I no longer dread shaving days!</li>
    <li> I love this shaver!!!  It is the BEST I have ever had.  I will never have any other shaver as long as this is available.  Believe me when I tell you it gives you such a silky smooth shave you will not believe it!  Well worth the money.  Don&#x27;t waste your money on the other&#x27;s buy this one and be completely happy with your choice!</li>
    <li> I love this shaver! I am disabled and very clumsy so using a regular blade is dangerous for me. I also take more sponge baths than showers due to my disability so having a shaver that does a fast dry shave is really great for me. This shaver works great, is easy to use and is very light to hold. It is easy to grip well and secure. Cleaning it is simple too. I highly recommend this shaver.</li>
    <li> Just received for gift after research for best shaver.  Must agree with the other reviews, produces a close comfortable shave.  I have course hair and have always felt like traditional razors rip the butterfly shaver was smooth.</li>
    <li> This is my first shaver.  Always have used a razor.  This shaver is wonderful and easy to use. This shaver actually works too.  Legs are smooth as can be.  Would highly recommend this for anyone.</li>
    <li> I was NEVER a fan of electric shavers. I&#x27;ve been waxing for years!  A friend of mine raved about it, so I decided to give it a try. This shaver is truly amazing!  I have thick hair and it&#x27;s amazing how smooth my legs are after a shave - no stubble whatsoever. I would also suggest the bikini attachment. I love it so much, I just purchased another for a birthday gift!</li>
    <li> Wow!  It came super fast and works beautifully!  It&#x27;s easy to use and is much smoother than any others I&#x27;ve tried.  Well worth the investment!</li>
    <li> This electric razor is the best by far of any one I have used before.  It&#x27;s quick, leaves your skin smooth and seems very powerful.  I charged it when I first received it and used it for the first time hours later.  It worked great!  I shaved my legs and arms and love how smooth my skin feels now.  I hope it continues to be as great as the first use.</li>
    <li> The wife loves this shaver! It fits any place, easy to charge/use...</li>
    <li> my wife likes it and has mentioned it to other women.</li>
    <li> Very pleased with purchase. Tried other named products but always had issues with the battery. They initially charged with no problems, then quit working. Thought I would pay extra and try this one primarily based on reviews. I&#x27;m unable to use some devices due to disability. I am able to use the Butterfly Shaver pro without too much difficulty. I&#x27;ve had it for a couple of weeks now and so far no problems.  Performs very well. I would recommend based on my experience.</li>
    <li> This is a really effective personal tool!  I&#x27;m very happy with it!</li>
    <li> I was tired of cutting myself with the cheap handheld razors...wanted to try an electric one and I ran across the pro.  BEST shaver I could&#x27;ve ever invested in.  It&#x27;s soooo easy to use, no pain envolved and it&#x27;s too cute. LUV IT!!!</li>
    <li> My wife says this is a gentle shaver which does not nick your legs.  It&#x27;s easy to use, even around the knee area.  Both infront of the knee and in the back of the knee.  It does a nice close shave and fits perfectly in your hand - no risk,of it slipping out of your hand while shaving.  It also is quiet when in use, so no worries about irritating whining noises while you use it.  Great product.</li>
    <li> This product is easy to use and clean; however, it already does not hold a charge.</li>
    <li> This is a piece of crap. I have only used it maybe 5 times won&#x27;t even hold charge long enough too shave one leg. I&#x27;m lucky if it lasts one minute DON&#x27;T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!! Now that has been too long to return it can&#x27;t even contact anybody about it to see if you can even get a battery for it. If you do order this &amp; you still get a red light even after charge even if the charge lasts at the time RETURN IT IMMEDIATELY!! If red light doesn&#x27;t go out apparently  it&#x27;s bad. My red light never went out even when charged but it shaved so I thought it was ok apparently not cause now it won&#x27;t even last one minute. While it lasted did do a decent job at getting close shave to be electric razor. But like I said only used it 5 times now won&#x27;t hold charge Way To Much Money to only use it 5 times really sucks. Amazon Customer service use to be Awesome now it Sucks you can&#x27;t get ahold of anybody anymore if you have problems. It&#x27;s like they don&#x27;t care about their customers anymore. If it wasn&#x27;t for customers they wouldn&#x27;t have any business. Oh well guess I need to start shopping at e-bay or shomewhere that cares about the customers. Oh by the way it has a permanent battery can&#x27;t change it. Way way too much money not to last no longer than that. Won&#x27;t order another one &amp; won&#x27;t be telling anybody else to order it.</li>
    <li> I love this razor, it is by far the best one I have ever owned.</li>
    <li> I was a little skeptical but once I tried it, I was very impressed with how well it works.  Plus it stays charged for a really long time!</li>
    <li> Great shaver, best electric or wet I have ever used!</li>
    <li> Love this razor for legs, BUT the battery has died already.   I have to use it plugged in now and have only had it for 4 months.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this for about a month, and it&#x27;s by far the best electric shaver I have ever owned! It&#x27;s more expensive than other lady shavers, but it&#x27;s well worth it. It&#x27;s ideal for shaving legs. Absolutely no nicks, cuts or scrapes, also pain free and perfect for sensitive skin! The head easily adjusts to any contour and works in any direction, perfect for shaving around the knee. It&#x27;s very comfortable to hold and actually works better without applying any pressure. The five-piece shaver foil gets the job done in a jiffy. It makes a much quieter buzzing sound than cheaper lady shavers. Another big advantage is that it really holds its charge, even through multiple leg shavings!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a shaver, not a permanent hair remover, so yes there will be stubble. The skin feels soft and somewhat exfoliated afterwards, though I do like to follow up with a moisturizer. This shaver works best on short hairs (no more than a few days growth). The foil body shaver attachment (which came free with my Amazon purchase) works well for longer hair trimming. The shaver head is easy to clean in a little water, though I do like to rinse it a few times until the water comes out clean. The brush that comes with the razor is effective for cleaning too. I recommend this shaver for any woman who needs to shave her legs.</li>
    <li> I have owned a great many shavers, but this one is the best I have used. Treat yourself ladies.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my girlfriend since she&#x27;s been bugging me for it.  Speaking from a man&#x27;s point of view it does a very good job.  Better than my Braun Series 7 that she has been using.  Perhaps due to the floating heads and the curves they are being used on.  She says it is very comfortable in her hand and it cuts pretty close.  I do not know how long the battery lasts since she charges it frequently but there is a led battery indicator right on top that will always keep you in the know.  After shaving her legs the first few times they felt very smooth but she missed quite a few spots, especially behind the knee.  I thought it was just the razor but she has gotten better at using it and it is taking her half the time it used to with my razor.  She hates regular razors because they irritated her skin so this was a good purchase.</li>
    <li> My girl friend really loves this little gem of a ladies shaver.  it shaves both long and short hairs equally close and is very easy to&lt;br /&gt; clean.  it is definitely the best shaver she has ever used.  The shaver is quiet, efficient and covers large areas such as the surface of the legs easily.</li>
    <li> Works awesome! Had my husband try it on his head and he turned around and bought the bald eagle for himself. The price is steep, but I&#x27;d rather pay more for good quality than less for total s***, especially when you just replace cheap s*** anyway and end of spending the same in the long run.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m surprised but I really like this shaver. I wasn&#x27;t sure about spending almost $100 on this product but I&#x27;ve tried so many $30 ones that hurt to use.&lt;br /&gt;This one is so soft and gentle and it actually removes hair. Wish I&#x27;d found this sooner.&lt;br /&gt;I thought it came with a free Body Shaver accessory but it doesn&#x27;t.</li>
    <li> This the best electric shaver ever</li>
    <li> Great littler shaver.  So convenient.  Love it.</li>
    <li> This is by far the best electric shaver I&#x27;ve used. I had a Norelco men&#x27;s face shaver for years because all the options designed for women were even less effective, but since my skin can&#x27;t tolerate regular shaving, men&#x27;s shavers were my only option. I was very pleasantly surprised to see a new option on the market when I started shopping around for a new shaver, and am super glad I tried it! The way it&#x27;s shaped makes it way more comfortable to use to shave my legs than a men&#x27;s razor.</li>
    <li> Shaving has always been a battle for me. My hair grows fast and I hated sitting on the edge of the tub for 30 min every week to shave with a razor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, I use the butterfly shaver a couple times a week things have changed! Sure the hair grows back quicker and it might not be as smooth, but I am actually prepared to wear shorts at all times now!&lt;br /&gt;Hopefully, the shaver holds up and the blades stay sharp!</li>
    <li> I Love this shaver! I was hesitant to spend the money on a shaver like this. I have always had better luck with a disposable one. Now I use this all the time. I don&#x27;t like it for my arm pits but it works great on my legs and bikini area. It took a little getting used to and at first I just thought it did an ok job but after using it more and more I now know the catch is to not just go straight up and down but I use it in a circular motion and it works great! It doesn&#x27;t pull the hairs on your leg. It glides over your skin smoothly.  I would definitely buy this for my daughter and recommend to friends. I received the foil body shaver attachment with this but I don&#x27;t particularly care for that at all.</li>
    <li> I have been unable to find a method of shaving or other hair removal that works and does not irritate my skin. (I have thick hair, and somewhat sensitive skin.) The butterfly shaver has been the closest thing I&#x27;ve found to working for me. (I have tried A LOT of different methods.) After a few months, it wouldn&#x27;t hold a charge anymore so I sent it back and they sent me a new one to fix the problem. I also found that the customer service representatives were very nice and easy to talk to. I am using the new one now, and I&#x27;m happy they helped me out.</li>
    <li> This does more than adequate for legs.  However, it stopped re-charging after 5 months light use, about twice a week.  Now it only runs if it is plugged in.  What convenience is that to be tethered to the wall outlet??  I recommend NOT buying this one.</li>
    <li> Very very very happy with this product.</li>
    <li> I have had this shaver for just over a month now and used it many times.  I had two Panasonics before and the Butterfly is far superior.  Pros: holds a charge for a long time; smaller and lighter than most other razors; works very well on short hair but takes a little extra effort for longer hair, quieter than other razors; easy to clean; and does a good job on arm pits as well as legs. Cons: more expensive than other razors although I feel like it is still a good value; does not work very well when wet like just after a cleaning as it grabs the hair sharply (be sure to let it dry); and does not do bikini line well (might try the foil attachment).  I would recommend this razor.  UPDATE:  I did end up getting the foil attachment which does a good job.  However, the razor stopped holding a charge and now is totally useless.  For this much money, I expect superior better reliability.  I was a very satisfied customer and now I am a VERY unhappy customer.</li>
    <li> Good to use! I always want to get a shaver like this one.</li>
    <li> I love this shaver! It works really well. . I don&#x27;t even have to get in the shower to use it. I use it all the time or whenever I need a TouchUp. . they sell different attachments. I would love to try the trimmer attachment, not sure if they still have that promotion where they send a free one for writing a review. . but overall, I love the butterfly shaver. Battery lasts a REALLY long time! And it charges quickly. . you won&#x27;t need to buy razors anymore if you invest in this. Believe me.</li>
    <li> This shaver is fantastic and the man behind it should be proud,nothing comes close and I mean nothing comes close, its a great shaver I use it four times a week ,I use to use blades but guess what people can say what they want blades do nick you and you will bleed so if you are smart get a skull shaver,you won&#x27;t be sorry.</li>
    <li> I bought the Butterfly Shaver Pro, the Skull Shaver Stand and a set of the two replacement shaver heads.  Couldn&#x27;t be happier with the purchase.  I&#x27;ve tried other electric razors for my legs and I could never get a really smooth shave without irritation.  This one was easy to use and clean.  Just the right size for my hand and very comfortable to hold on to.  Some razors vibrate too hard and can really hurt if you have severe arthritis.  This razor didn&#x27;t bother my arthritis at all.  I wish they had one that was completely waterproof so it could be used in the shower or tub.  I&#x27;d love to see it in black for men since this shape is easier on the hand than the bulky square one my husband has.</li>
    <li> This little shaver shaves my legs better than any electric shaver I&#x27;ve ever used.  I confess...I used it on my face, too.  Gentle and very quiet.</li>
    <li> This razor is horrible. I really wanted to like it, and I did the first few shaves.  It just does not shave good. My first one I had to return after a few shaves because it did not shave at all after 3 shaves. My second one they sent works but it is just not a good razor.  It misses so many spots. And takes forever.  I really wanted to like it and tried too.  It is maybe worth 30 bucks.  I spent $125.  Ouch. Waste of money :-(</li>
    <li> I bought this shaver for my wife and she absolutely loves it. It stays charged a long time. It&#x27;s easy to use and fast.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my mom and she finds it so much easier to use than a razor, can be used anywhere and with easy handling with arthritic hands, great product!!</li>
    <li> I read review after review raving about this shaver so I decided to give it a try. It leaves 2-3 day stubble no matter how many times you go over the same area, how fast or slow or what direction(s) you try. What a disappointment! I like how easily it glides and flexes over my ankles and knees but that doesn&#x27;t matter a bit if the shave is inferior. I got my husband the newest Braun charge &amp; clean shaver last Christmas &amp; I&#x27;ve been using his 10 year old Braun 7526 (with the original cutter &amp; foil) and it works great on my legs AND underarms. I thought a shaver designed for legs with an attachment for underarms would work better or easier, I was wrong. I&#x27;m returning the skull shaver Butterfly and all the accessories &amp; ordering a new cutter &amp; foil for the old Braun &amp; staying with what works!</li>
    <li> Best shaver i have ever used if your hand can reach the area u can shave it. Great news for this big gal</li>
    <li> I bought this product because of some of the great reviews about it on this website.  It would probably be OK, except it won&#x27;t start after several attempts at making sure it is charged.  Several reviews had the same complaint of it not starting or quitting after a few uses, but I gave it a try anyway.  So I have to send it back and am not reordering  at this time.</li>
    <li> I really like this shaver. It&#x27;s very smooth on my legs. This is the smoothest shaver I&#x27;ve found so far. I like that it has indicator lights on the top to show how much power is left. Hopefully, no more stopping after one leg because the batteries are dying. One thing that surprised me and the reason for the minus one star, is that the foil body shaver attachment isn&#x27;t automatically included with the razor. I did receive it as a bonus, but otherwise would have had to purchase it separately.</li>
    <li> Bought the Butterly Shaver pro on July 5th, 2015, &amp; there was supposed to be a free foil body shaver attachment, &amp;#34;while supplies last&amp;#34;, but, that did not come with it. I see that is still on the offer, so don&#x27;t expect it, if that&#x27;s part of why you&#x27;re ordering it. Other than that, it works very well, &amp; is very pretty. I like the shape a lot, it&#x27;s very comfortable to hold, &amp; the way the shavers are angled, combined with the way it angles to where you hold it on your skin makes it glide easily &amp; the shaving of hair quick. No, it doesn&#x27;t shave as close as a razor, but, who can really expect that? It does very well for what it is, &amp; I like the shape much better than the other straight-edged electric shavers. I would recommend it over other straigh-edged shavers, so if you&#x27;re thinking of getting one, this one is a good choice.</li>
    <li> Great but not as smooth as a normal shaver over all great</li>
    <li> Very smooth shave. Cleans easily. Love it !     UPDATE !!!!   In Jan. of 2016 my shaver stopped working. Called customer service and they replaced the shaver. In August of 2016 (8 months) later my replacement shaver has stopped working. Called customer service they will not replace and can&#x27;t repair the shaver. So I have had 2 shavers and both have worked less than a year.  I will not be purchasing another one !! Will try a different brand. I did love this shaver when it worked. But to last less than a year for the price it is not worth it .</li>
    <li> This shaver is amazing.  Do not hesitate to buy this if you want a clean smooth shave.  Easy easy to handle, light weight and really does the job.  Fantastic.  I would recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> I just received this shaver for christmas and I absolutely love it it&#x27;s easy to handle it&#x27;s quiet and it&#x27;s the closest shave with an electric razor I have ever had.I would absolutely recommend this to my friends</li>
    <li> I absolutely love the shaver. So far the battery holds really well, and the design of the blades makes it very easy to maneuver and not miss any spots. Also, is a very close shave. I used to use nair, but found myself always missing a spot. This does the trick perfectly. Let alone I&#x27;m a huge fan of attachments and accessories so I love that there are different attachments for shaving everywhere.</li>
    <li> This was a gift for my mom for Christmas. She has raved about it and recommends it for all women.</li>
    <li> I just received my Butterfly shaver yesterday. I let it charge over night. This morning I shaved with it. I feel this is a very good shaver. Easy to use. I like that is is easy to hold and it does a very nice job of shaving</li>
    <li> I started to become very skeptic about this product when I received it, but I was also excited to try it out.  Therefore, after a few hours debating whether I should try it or not, I finally gave in and tried it out and I can honestly say, I love it.  I have extremely sensitive skin and cannot just put anything on my skin without it causing an irritation, but the Butterfly Shaver Pro did not irritate my skin whatsoever.  I&#x27;m very happy with this shaver.</li>
    <li> Really liking it so far.  Easy to use, close shave for an electric.  Though was under the impression that you get a foil shaver attachment with purchase...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Reviews have incentives as well which is cool though.  Can&#x27;t wait to see how much I like it in 6 months!</li>
    <li> The best shaver I&#x27;ve ever owned</li>
    <li> With sensitive skin, shaving with an electric has always worked best for me. Legs have got to be the hardest surface to shave. With blind spots and curves, not to mention then amount of surface area, the hazards are numerous. I have been shaving 2 months now with no nicks, razor burn, or skin irritation. Rotating blades  give closer shave than foil heads. Five heads cut job down to size. Unique fit on palm of hand allows you to feel as you shave. Do not use on underarm area, that did not fair well. Cleans easy. Charges quickly and works corded as well. Feel this would have worked well even 20 years ago when legs were significantly more hairy. Love it so much I am thinking about purchasing another in case, god forbid, something were to happen to this one. For me, it felt similar to a blade shave without the hassle.</li>
    <li> Great for in between razor shaves. If you are looking for &amp;#34;smooth as a baby&#x27;s behind&amp;#34;, this product is not for you. If you are looking for a smooth look and no visible nubs, this is great. I love mine. Started wearing dresses again, after a quick once over with my butterfly.</li>
    <li> I got it in the main so happy then I tried using it then it cut my legs up and it hurt so bad I recommend you NOT to buy this expensive made cheap idem</li>
    <li> I really love this razor.  I always have used a manual because electric ones never got a close enough shave.  This one does a great job!!</li>
    <li> As a cancer patient subject to having problems with lymphedema, I cannot afford cutting or scraping my legs.  This shaver is perfect, with it&#x27;s very smooth action.  It exceeded my expectations!</li>
    <li> Fantastic, won&#x27;t ever use another electric razor other than this one! You get what you pay for, worth every penny.</li>
    <li> This is one of the best electric razors I have used.  Very close shave - no pinching no scratches.  I would definitely recommend this shaver.  Well worth the money.</li>
    <li> This is a fantastic electric shaver that was TOTALLY worth the price.  While it doesn&#x27;t get as close as a razor would, it is certainly good enough to wear shorts or a skirt.  I haven&#x27;t tried it with water yet so I cannot vouch for that, but it does tend to make my legs a tad dry so I am hoping the water may help.  It is great for traveling so you don&#x27;t have to try to shave in tiny hotel showers :)</li>
    <li> Works beautifully!  I highly recommend this shaver.</li>
    <li> I got this shaver as a gift from my husband and I really love it.  I love the style of it, it is gentle and quiet.  It works really well. I have been sort of leery of shavers before but I decided to try this one since all of the reviews were so good and I have not been disappointed.</li>
    <li> Very nice shaver.  Easy to use and fits well in the hand.  Well worth the investment!</li>
    <li> Good design but it does not shave close! Not worth the $99 i paid and now its more! Decided to return it and keep looking.</li>
    <li> I have purchased several electric razors in my lifetime. This is by far the best ever. It glides smoothly over my legs removing the hair without going over them several times. Easy cleaning of the razors by putting the razor head into water and turning on for 5 seconds. Love it!</li>
    <li> THIS THING IS FANTASTIC. I just shaved my legs on my couch in about 15 minutes. They are completely smooth! I was able to shave my bikini line with this and it was also utterly painless. This thing has changed my life in terms of shaving. I used to dread it but now its an afterthought. I also got the attachment and it has worked very well on my armpits and bikini area.</li>
    <li> I have only used it a couple times but the fact that it did not give me razor burn is a great thing and well worth every dime I payed.</li>
    <li> This product is excellent I recommend that everyone purchase this product 👍👍👍👍👍👍👍 it&#x27;s well the worth the money.</li>
