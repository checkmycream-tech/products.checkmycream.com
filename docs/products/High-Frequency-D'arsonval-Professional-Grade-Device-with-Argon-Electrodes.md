      <li>It came quickly and in good condition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I received this product with the intention of using it for anti-aging treatments.  The instructions were clear, the product was extremely well-packaged and everything seemed to work.  After using it once on my fair, somewhat sensitive skin I noticed more redness on my face than I anticipated.  I did some research and found a few sources that said neon (Orange) was preferred for anti-aging while the electrodes I used were argon (violet).  Worried I might be drying my skin too much I tried customer service, then realized I was calling after hours.  Imagine my surprise when I got a return call from NEW SPA outside their hours simply because they&#x27;d seen my number on caller ID.  Mary explained the difference between the two (not much with this product), stayed on with me while I confirmedi had both new and argon electrodes, talked about where to use it ( not around computers etc or using a GFC outlet) and reassured me my reaction was fine.  She said would be no problem to swap out the argon electrodes if I wanted.  All in all I was floored by the time Mary took and that she would reach out without my having left a message.  I can&#x27;t wait to servos this works once I&#x27;ve used it more.</li>
    <li> This product comes in two separate cases one has many useful heads, the other has a base: nice presentation and safe to storage. It came well packed and before I expected. Before purchase it I did some research and this item is well priced and has more options then the others high frequency facial devices.I will highly recommended the only thing I am missing is more information how all the heads may be use and on what level of strength. I am not professional. Overall great product and I love it. I am using it every week.</li>
    <li> Just like the ones you would find at a spa salon. I just Love this machine!! I now can give myself and my family as many free facials as I want.</li>
    <li> I use ie a lot for medical purposes. Love it</li>
    <li> this is incredible. i would absolutly recommend it for acne and for aging skin. it works and it works fast. i have been battling my sons acne for a long time. for those of you that have suffered from acne or have a child that does you know how emotional a problem acne can be. this machine has changed everything for us. i use it too and my skin is tighter, smoother and healthier looking. and they have amazing customer service as well. so if you are struggling with how to use this just ask them!!</li>
    <li> This machine is the best thing that I ever got in a long time I just Love it...Does what says  I&#x27;m a older lady and I have fine lines ..I just got this so I&#x27;ll write another review in a month ..</li>
    <li> This is high quality product. It works, feels, and even \\&quot;smells\\&quot; the same way as the D&#x27;arsonval device used by my esthetician back in Europe.  Comes in two plastic cases: one contains all the electrodes, the other holds the device and has additional electrode compartments. Good for storage and for traveling.&lt;br /&gt;I have used it for over a month now.  It definitely tones the skin and helps the products absorb deeper.  My pores are smaller and my acne has much diminished.  I put my Zeno aside, and use this instead on any sudden breakouts. Does not burn, like Zeno does, and works in more ways since it heats and creates antibacterial ozone. I would recommend it in a heartbeat.&lt;br /&gt;Fast shipping and very good customer service.</li>
    <li> Excellent excellent machine</li>
    <li> this is a great product and i would highly recommend it for anyone who has issues with acne and wants their hair to grow faster and longer.</li>
    <li> Love it.  As a Cosmetologist  this equipment works well.  I would recommend this to anyone that is considering one. The levels of intensity are more that sufficient. I use this all over my body, especially for my hair, insects bites(works well), my sinus, my gums.  Don&#x27;t be afraid to purchase this equipment.</li>
    <li> Quick shipping in excellent conditions. Works fabulous as a professional device. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Works very well and seems to be well made.  I have used a similar product before for acne.  This seems to be made better.  The other product lasted for over a year.  I hope this one lasts longer.</li>
    <li> Returned because I have cancer.  But I am sure I would have loved it because I have used it before years ago.</li>
    <li> High frecuency has the characteristics that cures the acne, horrible pimples and relax sensitive skin. And this medical product make it more easy,in use and handle. It has accesible price. For these reasons I Love it</li>
    <li> give it three stars  but  I stopped using it.  I didn&#x27;t see any new hair growth.  might try again</li>
    <li> My High Frequency came much quicker than expected. It only took 3 days! I just used it tonight and I love it. I also love the wide selection of glass electrodes.</li>
    <li> I have a video of how the product came and everything that is included with it. However I was not able to upload it because of the limitation in size of the file.  Overall the product is great, it feels and performs like a high quality unit. It is easy to use feels good on your face smells nice when using, and is refreshing. I have used it for a couple of days now and have seen improvement on my face, I plan to continue using it for the long term benefits. What can I say other then the product is great and if you are looking for one buy this one! you won&#x27;t be disappointed that you did. Youtube video link is...  [...] you can view the product there. Thank you NewSPA!</li>
    <li> This thing makes you feel like a mad scientist but it does what it is supposed to do.  The second box of attachments uses Argon.  The ones that come with it use... Neon (I think).  Both make the air smell like ozone.  I half expect the EPA to come in and arrest me for killing the ozone layer.  Anyway, It&#x27;s a cool freaky device and I like it.  Zaps zits, increases a blushing-bride color, gives a little lift.  Not a miracle but OTOH I don&#x27;t use it regularly because I&#x27;m too ADD to remember.</li>
    <li> I am pleased with my device. I was surprised that it arrived early, since it was ordered 1 week before Christmas. It is very portable and has several tools for many options.</li>
    <li> LOVE this machine!  An excellent machine for weekly use.  I have been using this machine for a few times in a month and see great results on my face so far.  I like purchase products from New Spa, they are a great seller and received the product before the expected arrival date.</li>
    <li> This is just what I needed, the only thing I would change is the cord, it is a little too short and all us professionals will need an extension cord, other than that is a perfect buy and great experience overall!</li>
    <li> I was very excited when I received and opened this item.  There were so many awesome electrodes included.  I plugged it in and went to test all of the electrodes.  The first one I put into the device, the mushroom, worked fine.  However, when I pulled it out of the device, the bottom of it stayed inside thus rendering it completely unusable.  I was very disappointed.  I contacted Amazon and was offered a refund option, which I chose.  I was issued the refund within a day.  They provided me with a return label.  So, all is well that ends well.  I decided to purchase a High Frequency machine from a Spa Equipment seller with the right warranty and where I know it is brand new.  In this case, I do want what I pay for so did not mind spending the extra money through a distributor.</li>
    <li> ITS a shocker,Works Great!</li>
    <li> I have been plagued with breakouts for more years than not. I&#x27;ve tried every cream, medication out there. I&#x27;ve spent thousands on facials and treatments. This machine works. I use it everyday and when I do breakout, the pimple is gone in a day or two instead of a week or two. It also helps control my oily skin and my skin texture has improved. I pick less because I have little to pick at. This is defiantly worth trying. I plan on taking it with me when I travel too. I will also cut back on facials at the salon. A real money saver.</li>
    <li> Great experience and quick delivery.  Item arrived completely intact, which was a concern considering it contains glass rods.  Easy instructions and two hard plastic cases as a bonus.  Would shop again!</li>
    <li> I bought this Machine because I have been doing high-frquency for about 25 years.I thought I would give this brand a try due to the good reviews.I recieved the machine quick the packaging was however not adequet the box was not packaged very well with cushioning and 2 of the electrodes were damaged in the shipping.I tried out the machine to see if it was damaged as well it worked fine as well as the rest of the electrodes.I am satisfied with the current it produces and the ease of being hand held the cord however is shorter than I had hoped you will need a exstension cord for more freedom to work on clients[[ASIN:B001VII87W High Frequency D&#x27;arsonval Home Use Device]][[ASIN:B001VII87W High Frequency D&#x27;arsonval Home Use Device]] and portable.Would I buy from New Skin Again most likely not Unless they rethink how they package their products that are glass and fragle...The one thing I did like was all the electrode options that this device had although 2 of mine were damaged due to packaging issues(there was just a box within a box) no cussioning to protect from mishandeling during shipment/transporting:(</li>
    <li> This product is awesome, love the case as well.</li>
    <li> Can smbd explain if it is 110v or 220v? Do I need a transformer to be able to use it?</li>
    <li> I have been using it for a week and I already see wonderful results on my skin. I&#x27;m very pleased with product I would definitely recommended to anyone.</li>
    <li> Great product, it has worked like a charm since purchased (3 months or so ago), everyone can see the difference.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t even know where to start with this product! I AM ABSOLUTELY OBSESSED! My dermatologist used it on me at the end of a facial and I asks if someone &amp;#34;normal&amp;#34; could purchase it...i was so shocked to hear yes!!! I received my package just the other day and I am so happy with the results! this is a miracle worker!</li>
    <li> Perfect!! Works great!!</li>
    <li> Exelent service!... I love it!</li>
    <li> I get hormonal acne that manifests in a miserably huge zit on my chin once a month that will stay for 2-3 weeks!  Now, the moment I notice one coming, I grab the attachment that has the little ball on the end and zap it.  I let it zap on there (yes it hurts, but only for a few seconds) for about 5-10 seconds.  I give it a good look over, and zap it some more if I think it needs it.  It is amazing how fast it works if I get on it early enough.  Sometimes I get complete resolution within a day!  As for skin tightening, I believe it works for that too, but I am not diligent enough to say for sure.  When I use it once a day for a week or more I think I can see the difference.</li>
    <li> Love this product have used it on my face</li>
    <li> I tried this for myself for skin tightening but really didn&#x27;t see much difference.  I tried this for my 14 year old&#x27;s acne and was amazed at how much clearing happens in 48 hours.  My teen can use it about twice a week and keep his skin almost clear.  He could do a lot better with better skin hygiene and some benzene peroxide.  So, I don&#x27;t recommend it for anti-aging, but I certainly recommend it for anyone with mild to moderate acne.  I don&#x27;t think it would work for someone with cystic acne.</li>
    <li> everything was great including the product. it was what i wanted.yes if a product i need and amazon can get it ti me i will order it..</li>
    <li> don&#x27;t bother spending your money on this. your basically paying for a magic show that doesn&#x27;t have a finale. no results and no returns.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s the best thing I ever bought for my skin care.</li>
    <li> Incredible!  Do yourself a favour, save some money and look great!  Easy to use but you have to use it regularly!</li>
    <li> Got it quickly and it does what I need it to do. I was spending the money for a facial eventhough I didn&#x27;t need one so quickly just so that they could use the high frequency on my problem skin. Zapping problem acne in the convenience of home is convenient and affordable now.</li>
    <li> Love love love it!!!!</li>
    <li> Love this product and my wrinkles are going away my hair seem healthier , would recomed it to any one</li>
    <li> It was what I expected, but it is too early to see results. I am pleased with the time of delivery and the quality and type of product I ordered.  It does seem to be professional grade. However, I would have liked to have seen more instruction and a company contact number with the product.</li>
    <li> This Items is awesome works wonders comes packed with great care</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m an esthetician and I have to say I like this kit better than the high frequency machine we used in school.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The packaging and portability is a definite plus.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There&#x27;s a detailed user&#x27;s manual that explains it all. Follow the guidelines and you&#x27;re set.</li>
    <li> I think it is really great. I can see that skin tabs are diminishing and I hope my face skin will tighten as well.</li>
    <li> This works better than the machine I had access to at my esthetician school. I can see the light, feel the spark, and smell the ozone. It&#x27;s very easy to use and comes with a decent case. In esthetician school we used a high frequency device to treat acne. This one seems higher quality than what we used on clients so I&#x27;m looking forward to seeing if it clears my breakouts.</li>
    <li> Really easy to use. I did see results. I have acne. I treated my acne with this product. Initially i seams that nothing is happening but by the third day of use i can see the healing process and my redness going away. My skin starts to feel really good.  I will definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This hi frequency is very strong, it&#x27;s best used professionally.</li>
    <li> I was sick of paying for facials when I knew I could do it myself! So I would cleanse, exfoliate, steam, extract, ZAP with this high frequency machine, and then put a mask on! I love it-whenever I have a zit I zap and it goes away way faster then before!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had it for 5 months and it&#x27;s still working:)&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t use it daily cause it dries skin.</li>
    <li> Great product, good price for all the attachments that you get.  I was pleased to find a modern version of this old type of machine.  My wife and I both use this for skin issues, and we&#x27;ve also have found that the gentle heating it produces feels good on sore feet.</li>
    <li> Used it 4 times.   Money down the drain.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s easy to use and made a difference to my daughters face in just one week. She uses it almost daily.</li>
    <li> Honestly, when I first looked at the products I was totally intimidated. Excellent packaging! The machine and rods look dangerous and complicated. I waited a week and a half and watched as many online videos as possible before I took it out of the box. I&#x27;ll share the link to the best one at the end of my review. It&#x27;s for a different product, but the method and ease of use is the same.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I finally attached the spoon (my favorite) and gave it a spin. So easy it made me feel foolish. If you&#x27;re using it on (very) mature skin I recommend Argan oil - they have a great option and value here on Amazon. (Pura D&#x27;Or)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My pores are smaller. Jawline already seems tighter. Skin feels much smoother. Puffiness under the eyes mostly gone. The whole process takes less than 10 minutes - every other day. I&#x27;m looking forward to seeing what six weeks will do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t be intimidated. I understand it if you are, but it just isn&#x27;t necessary. Watch the how-to&#x27;s and give it a shot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\\&quot;Derma Wand Watch it Once\\&quot;:  [...]</li>
    <li> Great product!  It is easy to use and works well.  With consistent use, hair is starting to grow in my thinned areas.  Helps acne clear faster.  I love it.</li>
    <li> Breaks Easy... not dual voltage</li>
    <li> This is just what I have been looking for, it&#x27;s old school. I didnt think that anyone carryed it any moore.</li>
    <li> I just received my D&#x27;Arsonval High Frequency Device and so far I love it.   The packaging is beautiful and the main unit came in a plastic box and the electrodes in a separate box (see my customer image on red background).  The only reason I didn&#x27;t give a 5/5 is because one of the little glass parts of the comb electrode arrived broken, even if the electrodes were covered in a black cushiony protector. It wasn&#x27;t my main purpose of purchase but I was excited to try it.  I have tried the facial electrodes at my aesthetician and seen great results on pimples and on helping skin heal post electrolysis hair removal treatment. I tried this device for the first time at home today and I found it feels the same as at my aesthetician.   Will report later on if I am still equally happy :)  I was given a 10 day estimation period for shipping, and it arrived at the middle of the time even if shipping to Canada so I actually expected it to only get in later.  Also I remeber reading some customer comments that they wished there were more explanations on how to use the product, I found the user guide pretty good, maybe it was improved since those comments, and I watched a couple of videos on you tube on how to use it and had an idea how my aesthetician did it.  All in all very happy about my purchase!</li>
    <li> Just love it.  My sister-in-law is an Esthetician, so I had her research this with me, she liked the stats and that is why I ordered 2.(One for her and one for me). We both love it.  Very easy to use. Came well packed. I would definately recommend this item.</li>
    <li> I have drawers full of products that have not come close to performing in months and years as well as the High Frequency D&#x27;arsonval Professional Grade Device has after the first time I used it for acne. Great product!</li>
    <li> It works but allow about 5-6 uses before seeing a result. It did tighten my neck skin but I had to use it on the highest setting.</li>
    <li> I have purchased this on December 2013 and I have been using it regularly every day and I have not seen any difference.&lt;br /&gt;I also want to know the advantage over this and the one you have for only $24 if they both are supposed to do the same thing.</li>
    <li> This has been a good addition to our office. It allows for different therapies to be utilized for different client needs.</li>
    <li> I like the product, but you must  know what you doing. i might have used it a bit to long one time and my skin looked burnt with red patches. But i still love it. I love when i go to my facialist and she usesit on me so wanted to have one at home and use myself more often.</li>
    <li> I just received my device, it looks just like in picture. However, I am trying to figure out how to use the different electrodes, also I just attached the mushroom, and turned on the device, I don&#x27;t see any color, the only color I can detect is the one at the bottom where the nob is, but I still feel the zap when I touch it. I was wondering how the anti-acne treatment work, how long do I hold the electrode close to the infected area, and for now long, and what sensation I should get? it felt a bit of a burn, but I wasn&#x27;t sure if I&#x27;m doing the  right thing. I also read that some people didn&#x27;t mind the smell, there wasn&#x27;t any, so it made me wonder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The booklet mentions that this machine, can also help with veins and pain, cellulite ? I can&#x27;t find any videos online to help me with figure out the right technique, I know there should be a certain durations and motion for each. If anybody knows please help!</li>
    <li> As a state board licensed esthetician, I have used several high frequency devices but none compare to this one!  I have been seeing amazing results with both direct and indirect electrodes.  This has more power and delivers better results than any previous HF device I have used.  Love this tool and so do my clients!</li>
    <li> I used this on my combination, oily, acne prone skin. I had a large cystic pimple on my cheek and an emerging pimple on my forehead when I used this. My pores were also quite large. I used the facial attachment to give me an overall facial, and felt my skin tingling . The electrons felt and smelled like the treatment I received last time I went to the spa. I also used the rod attachment on my pimples/problem areas. After using it (and yes it does zap), I saw an instant decrease in inflammation in my cystic pimple and emerging pimple. I saw my entire face have a decrease in pore size and oiliness less than half an hour later. The next morning, my skin looks great! My pores have shrunk and feels smooth. Also, I put on a clay mask, and felt the chemicals go deep into my skin. This was a great investment!!  Update: My skin looks amazing. My pores have shrunk and oil is reduced. I still have acne, but it was due to stress and hormonal imbalance. The device clears it up much faster than before I used it. I&#x27;ve only been using it less than two months on my skin and scalp. My hair is growing faster too. One inch in a month compared to its usual half an inch.</li>
    <li> This ia a great tool to have in your skincare kit. I use it for puffiness under the eyes and it really helps the blood circulation. It has decreased the amount of puffiness quite noticeably.  I use it every other evening and it didn&#x27;t take long to see results.</li>
    <li> This product is well made and within a week I have noticed a difference in my skin.  Family members are trying to use it for their hair and they think it is helping them too.  Directions could be better so I would know how to use all the other attachments.  So far we love it.</li>
    <li> I have been using this HF device for the last month and have noticed a DRAMATIC improvement in my skin tone and overall skin health.  It helps to deliver my facial products/oils/serums deep into the tissue to allow for improved penetration and absorption.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am now experimenting with it to remove a very small seed wart from my thumb and it appears as though it is working; it is nearly gone!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also this seller has the absolute best service ever!&lt;br /&gt;They sent the item at lightning speed way before the promised date and when it arrived it did not work and they sent a replacement immediately; It was such fast service that I got the replacement before the original package promise date!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you New Skin Care Collection!!!!&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I like my product but have been disappointed with no full instruction on how best to use this product for corresponding issue</li>
    <li> very well made, fast shiping too, an cool colors to, but take  a little  time getting use to, thank u!!!</li>
    <li> Item is not new. Unit has stains, the bulb is tilted when connected and there are 3 types of bulbs missing... Very frustrating... Bought it for my mother as a gift, she lives overseas, travelled over holidays when I got there and she opened it... There it was a used thing as a gift... Very disapointed.</li>
    <li> This is truly a professional grade unit.  Given time, and  diligence you can get amazing results.  It doesn&#x27;t matter what your age is, if you are suffering from adult acne, starting to wrinkle around the eyes and are getting &#x27;marionette&amp;#34; lines around your mouth give this a try.  Remember patience is the key here.  Also, this unit comes in two cases with the glass attachments snugly fit into their own foam, so there was no damage with my unit when it arrived.  Read the directions and follow them to the letter. If you have ever had one of these treatments at a salon you will know what I am talking about.  Remember there is no miracle cure for lines, or sagging muscles, except surgery, but if you are looking to make your face, etc. look and feel better than this is for you.  Again, read instructions carefully, because this is not a toy.</li>
    <li> Super high quality unit!  Works great on acne and cold sore outbreaks.  The first device like this we purchased was the \\&quot;Derma Wand\\&quot;.  It was total junk.  This device is 100 times better!  We love it!!</li>
    <li> I wanted to wait a bit before reviewing this item to make sure I wasn&#x27;t just excited about a new product I had for a few days- it has been about a month since I have purchased and used pretty frequently (5-6 days/week).  I am in love with this- after getting sporadic facials when I could fit it in my schedule and wanted to pay the money for them, and feeling that high frequency was the only thing that zapped and helped my problem skin, I inquired with an esthetician and she said they had devices that anyone could buy, so of course I hopped online and looked into it!  I selected this one and am extremely pleased with it.  For the cost of 2 facials I can now give MYSELF facials and I am so pleased.  Worth every penny- I plan to use consistently and once it dies out... definitely will be buying again :) My husband is not convinced of my &#x27;tesla&#x27; machine(because of course his skin is flawless) and my acne can come and go, so my next feat will be trying it on our 10 yr old&#x27;s warts as I have read that this is supposed to benefit that too.  Please note, I as a long time acne sufferer can tell the difference in absolute immediate reduction of inflammation- no more BUMPS, and that to me is HUGE!</li>
    <li> Gave this item as a gift to my Mom and she swears by it and loves it.  I don&#x27;t know the science behind it but I will say that my mom is a very intelligent person so it must work.  This is supposed to be the cadillac of blue ray machines and her&#x27;s is nicer than all of her friend&#x27;s machines.</li>
    <li> Not really seeing much of a difference after using it a month. Too much static electricity.  Would not buy it again.</li>
    <li> The High Frequency wand works well and is comfortable to work with. The carrying case is a little awkward as there are two separate cases - not as expected, but also not a big deal. Also the carrying case is a little bit of a tight fit for the attachments, so you have to be super careful putting the glass wands in and out, so as not to break them. The instructions are definitely lacking, and I looked up the proper techniques on the internet so I would know how to use this machine. All in all I am pleased with my purchase. Fast delivery.</li>
    <li> Received item in 1 week, nothing missing, nothing broken.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love all the different electrodes I get. Here are my favorite ones:&lt;br /&gt;Mushroom: great for all around treatment.&lt;br /&gt;Spoon: for use around eyes&lt;br /&gt;Roller: works great on chest and up neck&lt;br /&gt;Angled Ballpoint: zit zapper&lt;br /&gt;Rake: love to brush my hair/scalp with this.  Hopefully I will notice a difference in hair length..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Remember to always use an upward or circular motions.  Remove all metal jewelry.  Keep one finger on the electrode before coming in contact with the skin to neutralize the initial shock. Start on a low level before increasing strength. I turn it up until I hear a light electric sound. There is no need to be so aggressive at first, so see how your skin responds before increasing level.  A low level goes a long way with this device.&lt;br /&gt;I spend no more than 5 minutes using it.  Within a couple hours I notice a slight tightening, and my pimples looked less red.  How much should you use it?  Everyone is different, but as a general rule, the skin doesn&#x27;t like an excess of anything. I would say 2-3x a week at the most.&lt;br /&gt;There aren&#x27;t many instructional videos on youtube, but I enjoyed the video by BeautybyBernadette called &amp;#34;High Frequency Machine Review.&amp;#34;  It&#x27;s very basic but it gives you the low down.&lt;br /&gt; Enjoy and hope this review helps :)</li>
    <li> I am not sure how I feel about this yet.  I will continue to use it and hopefully it will win me over.  I do like the way it smells when I use it.  &#x3D;D</li>
    <li> Bought to help eliminate eye bags. Been using for a couple of months now and I have seen a noticeable improvement. Also great for zapping zits!</li>
    <li> There has already been allot said about this for the skin care industry. My review is about its quality for alternative use in sensation play. I bought this as a chrstmas present for my wife. It came in fast and in great shape. This is a quality product and well worth the price.</li>
    <li> I felt good results since the second time I used.</li>
    <li> Not as strong as I hoped but effective still. Looks a little cheesy with all the packaging.</li>
    <li> I did a lot of research on the differet optons available.  I started with the Derm Wand and branched out from there.  After reading the reviews of others I decided on the Darsonval.  The delivery was super fast and the packaging very nice.  The unit does not come with any instructions at all.  I contacted the Darsonval people through their web site but found their answer unhelpful.  I fnally settled on a spot I found on Utube called \\&quot;Dermawand watch this once\\&quot; and it was very helpful. I have been using the unit for a month now and the results are terrific!  I have had multiple comments from different people saying how good I look and wanting to know what I am doing. I am looking forward to seeing what the results are after a longer time frame.</li>
    <li> I love my device!! It really works to tighten my skin, reduce my pore size and puffiness under my eyes and wrinkles.. All over face improvement for me:)&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m working on my neck and we will see how that goes. So far slight improvement as my face was instant.&lt;br /&gt;Mary at customer service was awesome and sent me a link to a video to demonstrate how to use exactly.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t plug the device in the bathroom socket or kitchen due to to much current in those areas. I blew my device out doing that but Mary replaced it right away , hassle free.&lt;br /&gt;I totally recommend !!!</li>
    <li> This item is well worth the money!!! I this it is great for professionals and I certainly suggest this very well made item. Presentation is great as well</li>
    <li> The only reason I didn&#x27;t give this 5 stars is because it didn&#x27;t come with any instructions.  The best part is being able to lift my top lip.  It stings a little, but you can always turn it down.  I also love how you can zap a zit with it.  Just remember to hold it above and not directly on the place.  Depending upon the size and if it is cystic,  it eliminates the lesion or reduces it significantly.  The most exciting thing about this product is how you can stop cold sores.  If you treat it like a zit, it is amazing how quickly I have been able to rid myself of a cold sore.  Make sure you don&#x27;t irritate the zit or cold sore or it won&#x27;t work nearly as well. Now that I have said all that I am changing my score to 5 stars.  All of the above is worth it even without instructions!  Update:  Purchase made in 2013.  I stand by review above.  I broke my favorite wand and wish I could find a way to replace it.  :(</li>
    <li> wish it had the european plug with it otherwise it is easy to use and comes with plenty of attachments.</li>
    <li> Love it! The only thing missing is instructions how to use it had to watch you tube videos</li>
    <li> reviewed and hesitant about ordering, however; once I received and used, I am completely satisfied with the results it helps me get.  my clients will come in just for the hi frequency which gives me an add on.  this device is high tech compared to my older version and I enjoy using it.</li>
    <li> My skin definitely looks &amp;#34;juicier&amp;#34; if that makes sense.  I have seen my slackened areas look firmer, but you do have to use it on a regular basis to maintain and continue to see results.  Also, the customer service is EXCELLENT.  My handle was a little loose in an area and Rose immediately responded &amp; answered my questions, and another representative named David wrote a personal note in with the repaired handle.  I&#x27;m very happy with this device :-)</li>
    <li> From day one I feel like I feel after swimming laps...oxygen-ated...pulsating aliveness. Easy to use...results are immediate and with regular use cumulative.</li>
    <li> I actually have noticed my wife&#x27;s face being softer and less puffy and less wrinkley since using this product. I am always discouraging her from using chemical-laden cr*p on her face and body, so this was something she wanted to try, having seen the Dermawand ads on tv. My research indicated it might work so I bought it for her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She has used it for a couple months now and we are convinced it does work to make her face smoother, softer and more young looking (she&#x27;s 50 but looks like late 30&#x27;s; part of this is apparently genetics and good living but as I said, we have noticed an improvement since using this).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one thing she has said though, that does concern me, is that sometimes the unit has not worked at full power, that is it has acted as if it is failing. However next time she used it (each time) it was fine. I think it has a 6 month warranty though I&#x27;m not sure. I would hope to get at least a solid year out of it, for this price. We bought the professional one hoping it might last for years. However now we are worried that it might not last even a year. Time will tell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will update this review if it does fail, and I will update it if it doesn&#x27;t, as well. You can assume if we have not updated this review, that it did not fail. We bought it around February of 2013.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At this point my advice is to buy this if you want to make your face younger looking (and it is said that it also works wonders on acne).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;06/25/13&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still going strong after 4 months or so... and my wife&#x27;s face does look younger.&lt;br /&gt;I might say that she (and I) is also using Watts natural hyarlaronic acid - available here at amazon - and I am using only that and I have noticed a difference in my face - younger looking (I&#x27;m 60). So I can&#x27;t be 100% sure her results aren&#x27;t just from that, but my sense is that it&#x27;s a combination of the two.</li>
    <li> Love this soo much!!! If I start to get one of those annoying under the skin lump pimple (I&#x27;m sure you all know what I mean) I just ZAP it for like two nights in a row before bed and PRESTO - it&#x27;s gone!!!! So glad I made the purchase!!!!</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t come with instructions to know how to use it!</li>
    <li> I use this product a lot... it works very well...</li>
    <li> I purchased one a few months ago  and love it.  Loaned it to friend and she bought it off me so i just ordered another one today.</li>
    <li> Love it ! Love it !! Love it !!! It works, it helps.</li>
    <li> I got the New Spa device. It came quickly and in good condition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had the most stubborn cystic acne for about 4 years. In that time, I tried one thing after the other: proactiv, clearasil, clindamycin, 3rd gen birth control, tretinoin (Vit A derivatives), iodine, diets, aspirin, oil cleansing, UV, zinc, competitive bacteria, washing more, washing less, AHAs, BHAs, sulfur (which worked well on existing pimples, but didn&#x27;t seem to prevent new ones), the only thing that came close to working was Solodyn, and I felt ethically conflicted about potentially contributing to antibiotic resistance. Obviously, I was desperate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My older sister had me come out to her state to see her facialist for a high-frequency facial, and after the grueling extraction that covered pretty much my entire face, I looked so picked and hideous that I didn&#x27;t want to see anyone. But I healed overnight. A month later, I went to a spa in my area with high frequency, where they extracted a dozen or so pimples and there were dark marks left behind, but they healed faster than I expected. I made a third appointment for an acne facial. I actually cried when she said I didn&#x27;t really have acne, extracted only three pimples, and wanded me with high frequency. I came in one last time for heavy-duty extraction of one last stubborn cystic zit, was wanded until the spot looked like the bottom of a cast iron pan, but then it healed, much faster than any marks I&#x27;d had before, and suddenly, my skin was completely clear. I moved for the summer and don&#x27;t have a spa that uses high frequency wands near me, so I bought this just in case, and the cost of this set is the same as one visit to my sister&#x27;s spa.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It looks, feels, and gives off the same ozone smell as the one at the spa. I&#x27;m using it on my guy and it seems so far that just 2-minutes of wand waving is enough for big, pus-filled whiteheads actually seem to cauterize, they turn black inside and burn off without any extraction atall. I credit high frequency entirely with healing my skin, and this at-home product is healing my guy&#x27;s zits now. Obviously, I recommend it.</li>
    <li> I bought this when i was breaking out with adult acne..i was told it was good to use for active aystic pimples to make them go away..so desperate to have a clear face i bought this machine..big mistake i was zapping my cystic pimples away but it left me with depressed scars and what look like scratches on my face once the acne cleared..big mistake ...for wrinkles this may be good but not ppl with sensitve skin and active adult acne..will never use this product for my acne again!!!!</li>
    <li> The product is great, and I like it.&lt;br /&gt;That being said, the case it came in is not like the one in the picture.  It actually came in two separate cases (inconvenient) and with no instructions - I left message and they got back to me quickly but referred me to a you-tube video from a cosmetologist blogger that has nothing to do with company.&lt;br /&gt;Also the name brand of the machine &amp;#34;New Spa&amp;#34; or &amp;#34;D&#x27;arsonval&amp;#34; is nowhere on the packaging, case  or the machine or even on the box...that makes me nervous.  How do I know it&#x27;s the actual machine that is in the picture above that is getting all the great ratings and not a lesser version?  I took off a star because of this but I should have taken off two.</li>
    <li> I had tried another high frequency device and this is hands down the best I&#x27;ve used. I love all the different electrodes that come in the kit. There is a perfect use for each and every one of them. I&#x27;m in love!</li>
    <li> I have been going to an esthetician, and she would use a high frequency machine to spot treat my acne.  I decided to purchase a high frequency machine so I could save some money, and I&#x27;ve discovered that this product is amazing!  I suffered from acne as a teenager, and I recently began to suffer from acne again in my mid twenties.  My face was also extremely oily.  I have tried numerous products, but I still continued to break out.  I finally purchased this product and started to include it in my daily regimen.  I use it on my entire face and to spot treat acne.  This work great on zits, and it has also made my face less oily.  An added benefit is that my skin feels softer.  Amazing product.  I highly recommend it!</li>
    <li> Enjoying this device. I can tell a difference in my skin.i also used it on my lower back muscles that were aching and it relieved the ache. For me it was worth the money.</li>
    <li> After (supposedly) 2 tries to deliver to my apartment building (which has been there for 60 years) the seller gave up and issued a refund. The whole process took almost a month. For an expensive product like this I think there should be better service when you pay for something and get charged then get blamed that your apartment number doesn&#x27;t exist. If I hadn&#x27;t complained to Amazon I wouldn&#x27;t have gotten a refund.</li>
    <li> I received excellent packaging and written assurance that any needed customer service would be prompt. There are more attachments than I think I&#x27;d ever need. I actually believe that the smaller set would have been adequate. As to any noticable improvements in the tone of my slight marionette lines and jowls, I can&#x27;t say that there has been. I&#x27;m not that concerned about pronounced sagging, that&#x27;s not my issue.I just wanted ward off any further loss of tone.&lt;br /&gt;I did see improvement in a pimple healing with the use of the hi frequency. I am disappointed though the after 3 months regular use, I see little difference.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve read other reviews on this item and they were good. So I bought one for myself. Its very easy to use. I noticed results within just 3 days of using it. I noticed areas of my face are more lifted, tightened, refreshed. Wow! I can&#x27;t believe I don&#x27;t have to go to a spa to get facials. I will continue using this product. It really works. I recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Love the unit works great and I can already see improvements using it.</li>
</ol>
