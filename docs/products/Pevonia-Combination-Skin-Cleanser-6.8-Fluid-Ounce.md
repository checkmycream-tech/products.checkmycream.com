    <li> Love this cleanser.  I have very sensitive acne prone skin and this does wonders.  I have much clearer skin and it is so soft.</li>
    <li> My skin feels supple after use of this cleanser without it feeling greasy. I see a slight reduction in my wrinkles as well and will continue to use this product.</li>
    <li> I have been using Pevonia products for 4 years and I love how I stopped breaking out from other heavier products.</li>
    <li> I love this and use it every day. its gentle and works even if I don&#x27;t use toner after it cleans w/out stripping your face.</li>
    <li> I loved it! Left my face feeling clean, soft and hydrate.  Good choice and good price. I used them before a couple of years ago and I got back to them because my skin was dehydrated and peeling.</li>
    <li> Just enough moisture for me. Removes makeup well with Claresonic brush.</li>
    <li> I definitely noticed my oily combination skin is improving. Less clogged pores by the day. They are also getting smaller.</li>
    <li> Lease skin with a non clean finish. Does not remove makeup. I have been a devoted pevonia user for years but product has been a disappointment. Phyto gel is a much better cleanser, gentle but still leaves skin smooth and clean. Non drying.</li>
    <li> perfect skin for years</li>
    <li> My mom loves these products.  They really help her skin stay looking young, and if you can get them at a good price, then by all means buy it for her.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for quite some time now. It works fabulous! This was a good buy. Great!!</li>
    <li> Some of the cleansers I have previously used left my skin feeling dry and tight.....Pevonia cleans very well and leaves my skin feeling soft and silky.  I definately recommend it.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for two days and my skin looks brighter already!  I absolutely just love this cleanser!</li>
    <li> I love Pevonia and have used it for 2 years since discovering it in a spa in CA on vacation.  I use various products from them but only find them this inexpensive on Amazon.  This product shipped very quickly and this seller&#x27;s products were very fresh.  I have sometimes had problems with slightly foul smelling Pevonia cleansers on Amazon.  Highly recommend the product and seller.  Combination skin cleanser is somewhat perfumed unlike the sensitive skin cleanser but hasn&#x27;t produced any reaction.  Very happy.</li>
    <li> I have been using Pevonia skincare products for years. This is the best line of cleansers and lotions. Very calming for my skin.</li>
    <li> Great cleanser and easy to use.</li>
    <li> This is an amazing cleanser.....never leaves your face feeling too dry.....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it every day, followed by their lotion.</li>
    <li> I try various other cleansers over the years, just because I am always looking to see if there is something even better out there.  I always come back to this.  I love the smell, too!</li>
    <li> THIS IS A GREAT PRODUCT ... IT WAS RECD AS PROMISED ....AND I WILL BE ORDERING AGAIN SOON..</li>
    <li> Works very well and is easy on the epidermis.  This product is on my list of items to reorder.</li>
    <li> My absolute favorite I can&#x27;t stand washing with anything else.</li>
