      <li>Great product and fast shipping!</li>
      <li>It performs okay.  </li>
      <li>I love this stuff.</li>
      <li>I use as lip balm and as hair product (most products marketed as hair products make my face break out, and I&#x27;ve found shea butter works just as well and is better on my skin).</li>
      <li>I am more than grateful for Amazon in my quest to use nature-based products and the ease of purchase.</li>
      <li>I love the unrefined shea butter.  </li>
      <li>It does melt quickly once in your hands but would be nice if it was a bit softer.</li>
      <li>and so it can really dry my face out so this shea butter was perfect..</li>
      <li>I am very pleased and will continue to use this amazing and natural product for my skin-care routine.  </li>
      <li>I use this for hair and skin its thick and not the best smell but all natural and good quality !!!</li>
      <li>It has a beautiful smoky/nutty aroma that fades after a little while and makes my skin feel amazing.  </li>
      <li>and it warns up to a smooth, easy to apply consistency when you rub it between your hands.  </li>
      <li>and so I was taking a huge chance purchasing something that hadn&#x27;t been reviewed.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t know if I would enjoy smelling it all day</li>
      <li>I am very well pleased with this product.</li>
      <li>I loved how it moisturized my body especially my legs, feet, hands and face...</li>
      <li>It arrived quickly.</li>
      <li>liked it a little better.  </li>
      <li>and I have used everything under the sun until I finally found a good skin care routine that worked for me, but I wanted something that would help with the expression lines I&#x27;m starting to get on my forehead, something natural, and that would be more of a benefit to my skin.  </li>
      <li>After years of wanting to try Shea butter, I&#x27;m so glad I finally did.</li>
      <li>After mixing it with essential oils, this keeps my hair moisturized and healthy looking.  </li>
      <li>My skin is super sensitive</li>
      <li>Product was very neatly package and the product works very well.</li>
      <li>Work very well with the coconut oil</li>
      <li>i use shea butter for  stretches after pregnancy an it works very well</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product.</li>
      <li>I have already noticed a slight difference in the softness and suppleness of my skin, more time will tell on its effectiveness on improving the look of my slight forehead wrinkles, but overall I really love it.</li>
      <li>Not like soft Shea butter</li>
      <li>but it seems to blend into your body&#x27;s natural</li>
      <li>Its not smooth so you have to warm it up a little in your hands before you rub it in.</li>
      <li>I have sensitive, acne prone, very dry skin</li>

<li> Not real Shea butter.....</li>
<li> This is as described and expected.</li>

<li> Initially I was skeptical becuase there were no reviews.</li>
<li> weird gritty consistency.  </li>

    <li> A very good moisturizer with added oils.</li>
    <li> Not real Shea butter.....don&#x27;t let the price fool you</li>
    <li> I love the unrefined shea butter.  After mixing it with essential oils, this keeps my hair moisturized and healthy looking.  The smell is fantastic!!</li>
    <li> I am quite happy with my purchase. I am more than grateful for Amazon in my quest to use nature-based products and the ease of purchase.</li>
    <li> very satisfied with my Shea Butter, use it on my hair.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. I use it in my hair, on my skin and as a chapstick.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive, acne prone, very dry skin and I have used everything under the sun until I finally found a good skin care routine that worked for me, but I wanted something that would help with the expression lines I&#x27;m starting to get on my forehead, something natural, and that would be more of a benefit to my skin.  After years of wanting to try Shea butter, I&#x27;m so glad I finally did. I started washing my face with raw, African black soap then follow with applying a thin layer of this Shea butter on my face.  I also use it on my elbows, feet, tummy (to help fade stretch marks from when I had my son seven years ago, and hands at bedtime.  I scoop a small amount out with a spoon and it warns up to a smooth, easy to apply consistency when you rub it between your hands.  It has a beautiful smoky/nutty aroma that fades after a little while and makes my skin feel amazing.  I am very pleased and will continue to use this amazing and natural product for my skin-care routine.  I have already noticed a slight difference in the softness and suppleness of my skin, more time will tell on its effectiveness on improving the look of my slight forehead wrinkles, but overall I really love it.</li>
    <li> Work very well with the coconut oil</li>
    <li> This is as described and expected. Its not smooth so you have to warm it up a little in your hands before you rub it in. It keeps me moist and I like it.</li>
    <li> I use this for hair and skin its thick and not the best smell but all natural and good quality !!!</li>
    <li> When I purchased this product in the past, perhaps it wasn&#x27;t the same vendor.  It performs okay.  I wish I knew the other one I bought in the past -- liked it a little better.  May try another vendor but would purchase this one again if I can&#x27;t find the other one.  It&#x27;s not as smooth as the previous purchase -- a little lumpy and harder to use.</li>
    <li> Did not received 100% shea butter. Would guess it is part shea mixed with something else. Not worth retuning and won&#x27;t buy from this retailer again. M</li>
    <li> Great stuff. I used organic shea butter. This &amp;#34;REAL African Shea Butter ...&amp;#34; has the same ivory color as the organic one. I can&#x27;t differentiate this one from the organic one by texture, raw smell or quality. I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Awesome Product will be ordering this again</li>
    <li> Product was very neatly package and the product works very well.</li>
    <li> good product.. will order again...</li>
    <li> Product delivered on time. i use shea butter for  stretches after pregnancy an it works very well</li>
    <li> Great product and fast shipping!</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t actually gotten to use it yet but it looks amazing</li>
    <li> Initially I was skeptical becuase there were no reviews. My skin is super sensitive and so I was taking a huge chance purchasing something that hadn&#x27;t been reviewed. It arrived quickly. The smell was nutty. I didn&#x27;t know if I would enjoy smelling it all day but it seems to blend into your body&#x27;s natural odor(hopefully yours is pleasant :)) I loved how it moisturized my body especially my legs, feet, hands and face...I&#x27;m using dudu osun on my face and so it can really dry my face out so this shea butter was perfect..The only negative is the thickness. It does melt quickly once in your hands but would be nice if it was a bit softer. Overall, i would purchase again, this time maybe a bigger container because of how often I use it.</li>
    <li> weird gritty consistency.  Not like soft Shea butter</li>
