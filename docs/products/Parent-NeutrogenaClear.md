      <li>on so that you can keep your skin healthy!</li>
      <li>i love this product though!</li>
      <li>PRODUCT WAS EVERYTHING I HOPED FOR AND MORE!</li>
      <li>That&#x27;s my favorite part walking around feeling the coolness in my pores!</li>
      <li>The salicylic acid, witch hazel, and chamomilla together help my skin for sure!</li>
      <li>This is a really nice astringent.</li>
      <li>This stuff kind of works, but like all store bought remedies sold in USA</li>
      <li>The good thing is it feels refreshing once you apply it to your face.</li>
      <li>This stuff is very effective, but it doesn&#x27;t smell half as good or leave my face feeling wonderful like the Blackhead Eliminating Astringent.</li>
      <li>And this toner is by far the best.</li>
      <li>I liked Neutrogena&#x27;s Blackhead Eliminating Astringent better.</li>
      <li>so it&#x27;s great, thanks to Amazon, I can get this toner once again!</li>
      <li>But I wanted something strong and effective.  </li>
      <li>I love Neutrogna.it</li>
      <li>I mix  it about 40/60 with pure witch hazel, and it adds just the right amount of scent and &amp;#34;zing&amp;#34; to make it perfect.</li>
      <li>(it was an add-on item, I was getting more stuff to buy) and</li>
      <li>I will still give it a top rating though :)</li>
      <li>I usually love Neutrogena stuff</li>
      <li>I love the astringent (though I would love it more</li>
      <li>It works much better for my skin type and needs.</li>
      <li>had helped me for many years off and on,for awhile i had stop using it</li>
      <li>I love having this around to absorb the oil on my face in between my morning and night face cleaning.</li>
      <li>Works well on the T part of your face which has more oil than the rest.  </li>
      <li>I used this twice just to make sure I wasn&#x27;t imagining the smell.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried other astringents, and this one is the perfect balance of effective cleansing without overdrying.  </li>
      <li>If you walk around if feels like a cool, kind of like menthol (you know when you put on Noxzema or something on your face and you can feel the menthol working?), breeze in your pores the faster</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t tried the alcohol free stuff, but I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s ok too though.</li>
      <li>Glad it&#x27;s cheap and on amazon prime</li>
      <li>and then I started to use this product, clear skin and great product by the way i don&#x27;t have acne problems</li>
      <li>This product is actually really nice for right after I wash my face.</li>
      <li>Other than that, it does its job greatly!!</li>
      <li>that I don&#x27;t need anything as strong as this for my skin.  </li>
      <li>That said, I&#x27;ll probably continue buying this product because 1) it works well, despite the strong odor and 2)</li>
      <li>/&gt;Despite my experiences, I am still giving this 3 stars because if you are someone with oily skin and suffer from acne, this would probably be fine.  </li>
      <li>After I&#x27;m finished rinising off my cleanser, then I&#x27;ll use my acne medication, and use my Oil Free Neutrogena Moisturizer  SPF 15 &amp; Neutrogena&#x27;s The Spot Acne Treatment to control and demolish my acne.</li>
      <li>I have \\&quot;normal\\&quot; skin and don&#x27;t experience a lot of break outs, so I ended up going with an alcohol free toner, also by Neutrogena, instead</li>
      <li>So far, this is a good product.</li>
      <li>I have a clean, smooth forehead.</li>
      <li>Best of all, I do not find this product to be particularly drying, even though my skin is on the dry side.  </li>
      <li>It keeps my forehead clean and reduces the amount of pimples I get throughout the day.  </li>
      <li>I use a mild face wash, then I use this astringent to help remove any makeup that did not get removed by the face wash (makeup remover gives me breakouts).  </li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product :) And the Neutrogena Oil-Free face wash as well</li>
      <li>But more importantly, it does significantly remove more oils from my face than other astringents.</li>
      <li>It helped reduced the size of my pores on my nose, along with keep the oil in my T-zone down, which is great because I&#x27;ve tried a lot of things</li>
      <li>Doing all of this, I haven&#x27;t really been acne!!</li>
      <li>Saving a few bucks where we can, is the great</li>
      <li>My face stung and dried out after I applied it, but it worked great.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a very simple regimen, but extremely effective.  </li>
      <li>When I apply it to my face after washing it, it makes my face itchy right after but stops itching after awhile .</li>
      <li>Other than that, it&#x27;s pretty good - gets the job done.</li>
      <li>a bottle lasts a long time, i very rarely break out, and i have noticed a significant difference in the amount of oil on my face at the end of the day!</li>
      <li>I ran out for a short time and started breaking out, this really helps control acne and keep skin bright and clear.  </li>
      <li>This product does its job for cleaning off residue on the skin and keeping acne at bay, I&#x27;ve used similar astringents for many years now.</li>
      <li>But Amazon packaged these bottles really well!</li>
      <li>if you use it consistently every night it helps prevent pimps.</li>
      <li>Will recommend to anyone interested in this product.</li>
      <li>While the oil does come back within a couple hours for me, it works much better than oil blotting sheets.</li>
      <li>I only bought this because it was $1 or more cheaper than the others.</li>
      <li>Very thankful for it!</li>
      <li>To me, it smells exactly like urine.</li>
      <li>For like the first week that I started using it every time I would use it would feel like my skin was burning off.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m giving two stars because it cleans off left over makeup and oil, but it doesn&#x27;t seem any better than witch hazel and rubbing alcohol.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s most especially noticeable if you use it on and around your nose.</li>
      <li>It is not too harsh but still does a good job of cleaning off what soap and water don&#x27;t get.</li>
      <li>I get much better results by dissolving cheap aspirin (which is salicylic acid) into witch hazel, and a little magnesium chloride to keep the skin moist .</li>
      <li>my skin was clear and no longer oily.i use it 2-3 times a day so that my face wont be so oily plus it clean your face well</li>
      <li>This stuff doesn&#x27;t compare to the clean &amp; clear brand of toner, and I feel like it&#x27;s just rubbing alcohol.</li>
      <li>and you have beautifully soft, clean skin.</li>
      <li>it definitely helps to clean it without overdrying!</li>
      <li>but my skin is looking better than it has in a long time.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used burn my cheeks and dry them out even more.</li>
      <li>The only problem I have with it is that it has a strong odor.</li>
      <li>I have very dry cheeks, which is another great thing about this toner; it doesn&#x27;t dry out my cheeks.</li>
      <li>I try not to wipe my whole face with it because it is drying.</li>
      <li>This stuff really works and I wish I knew about it sooner.</li>
      <li>and it REALLY stings when i put it on</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I bought this a few weeks ago and I wanted to really test it before I wrote a review.  This stuff is amazing! My skin is oily, especially around the center of my face. My breakouts where horrible and I found myself uncomfortable talking to others. After using this for over a week my skin has cleared up and no more oil. This stuff really works and I wish I knew about it sooner. Thank you Neutrogena!!</li>
    <li> Great product! Great Service!</li>
    <li> It keeps my forehead clean and reduces the amount of pimples I get throughout the day.  In the morning and at night I use a facial wash to clean my acne.  So this is what I use throughout the day.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this stuff!!!! This is the BEST Astringent I&#x27;ve EVER used!!!! You can actually feel this stuff working. You wash your face and then put some of the toner (astringent) on your face. If you walk around if feels like a cool, kind of like menthol (you know when you put on Noxzema or something on your face and you can feel the menthol working?), breeze in your pores the faster you walk the cooler it feels. That&#x27;s my favorite part walking around feeling the coolness in my pores! Yeah I&#x27;m weird, but that&#x27;s how I know its working. It helped reduced the size of my pores on my nose, along with keep the oil in my T-zone down, which is great because I&#x27;ve tried a lot of things and they didn&#x27;t work too well for me, like even Proactiv. I have very dry cheeks, which is another great thing about this toner; it doesn&#x27;t dry out my cheeks. A lot of other toner&#x27;s I&#x27;ve used burn my cheeks and dry them out even more. I live in a small town so it&#x27;s great, thanks to Amazon, I can get this toner once again! I haven&#x27;t tried the alcohol free stuff, but I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s ok too though.</li>
    <li> I liked Neutrogena&#x27;s Blackhead Eliminating Astringent better. This stuff is very effective, but it doesn&#x27;t smell half as good or leave my face feeling wonderful like the Blackhead Eliminating Astringent. That said, I&#x27;ll probably continue buying this product because 1) it works well, despite the strong odor and 2) I believe Blackhead Eliminating Astringent has been discontinued by Neutrogena.</li>
    <li> Burns my skin.  Going back to Clinique skin care no matter what the costs.</li>
    <li> I was so absolutely worried this would dry my face. I had flashbacks to puberty when astringent use dried me out so bad that it actually caused more pimples. I tried this day one and was shocked that I felt absolutely no dryness. And the cotton round was totally dirty. Clearly, I had a need for this stuff. Two weeks later and I&#x27;ve used this every night before bed. My pores are smaller and my blackheads have decreased considerably. And, put a smile on my face because this is the best part, there still have been no signs of dryness! Note I have combination skin that is usually oily in the Tzone. Also note I am in my 30s and bought this to combat my visible blackheads and occasional breakouts.</li>
    <li> At first this toner was good but after a few days of using it, this toner broke me out badly all over my nose. It&#x27;s supposed to prevent breakouts but all it did was cause my break outs. The only toner I find that works it the Simple soothing toner</li>
    <li> I am 21 and have had combo skin for years and years, dry in the morning, oily throughout the day! i love this product though! i use it on my face every morning when my skin is a bit flakey, and it makes my skin so soft! my moisturizer goes on smoothly finally! a bottle lasts a long time, i very rarely break out, and i have noticed a significant difference in the amount of oil on my face at the end of the day! i still have some but much less! my only complaint is that it does nothing for blackheads, i still have those...</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve never written a review but this product is amazing! I don&#x27;t have acne but have very oily skin that causes random pimples here and there. This has cleared my face in a little more than a week. I use it a few times a day as my skin isn&#x27;t very sensitive. I&#x27;m impressed and will recommend.</li>
    <li> I have this astringent and I like it, but i&#x27;m not exactly sure that it&#x27;s doing something!! I mean, it kind of tingles and stuff, but I&#x27;m not sure that it helps with acne, I&#x27;ve seen no change because of it.</li>
    <li> The smell is terrible but its ok for the price</li>
    <li> Using this product can dry my face out, so what I do is I rinse my face with cool water, then pat dry my face, then apply the astringent. My face feels refreshed. Then I add my Neutrogena Pore Cleanser Mask, and my face feels refreshed. After I&#x27;m finished rinising off my cleanser, then I&#x27;ll use my acne medication, and use my Oil Free Neutrogena Moisturizer  SPF 15 &amp; Neutrogena&#x27;s The Spot Acne Treatment to control and demolish my acne. What a beatiful combination!</li>
    <li> Works well on the T part of your face which has more oil than the rest.  I just dab it on in the morning and it really helps.</li>
    <li> My dermatologist said to use this when I don&#x27;t I break out.</li>
    <li> I love having this around to absorb the oil on my face in between my morning and night face cleaning. While the oil does come back within a couple hours for me, it works much better than oil blotting sheets.</li>
    <li> This stuff doesn&#x27;t compare to the clean &amp; clear brand of toner, and I feel like it&#x27;s just rubbing alcohol. I&#x27;m giving two stars because it cleans off left over makeup and oil, but it doesn&#x27;t seem any better than witch hazel and rubbing alcohol. It smells so bad though!! Like a mix of cat urine and weird curry scent or something. It&#x27;s disgusting.</li>
    <li> I like this astringent.  It is not too harsh but still does a good job of cleaning off what soap and water don&#x27;t get.</li>
    <li> I love the astringent (though I would love it more it it could be blended with a lotion so it would be less dry.)  My only issue is that my latest bottle (this is my 2nd) has had a slow leak from the bottom.  Possibly it was crushed a bit in shipping.  I will still give it a top rating though :)</li>
    <li> These bottles always leak. I know this because I have tried to travel wth them a couple times, but it&#x27;s impossible. But Amazon packaged these bottles really well! Wrapped in a bunch of plastic really tight so they didn&#x27;t leak! I was very impressed. And this toner is by far the best. I have been using it for years. It is the only toner that keeps me from breaking out.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried other astringents, and this one is the perfect balance of effective cleansing without overdrying.  Those who use this product alone probably do not get great results, but this is designed to be part of a skincare regimen, including moisturizing.  I use a mild face wash, then I use this astringent to help remove any makeup that did not get removed by the face wash (makeup remover gives me breakouts).  After that, I use Neutrogena Anti-Wrinkle Anti-Blemish lotion.  It&#x27;s a very simple regimen, but extremely effective.  I&#x27;ve tried other astringents in the same regimen, but they dried out my skin and had noticeably higher alcohol content, likely the cause of the over-drying.</li>
    <li> This product does its job for cleaning off residue on the skin and keeping acne at bay, I&#x27;ve used similar astringents for many years now. My only complaint is that the bottles come without any expiration date- I have no idea how long this bottle can last, and there doesn&#x27;t seem to be any way to inquire into this matter either- can&#x27;t say I can order more in the future without the dates</li>
    <li> I had never ever had an acne problem until recently small pimples her or there not and then I started to use this product, clear skin and great product by the way i don&#x27;t have acne problems ,I will buy it a gain</li>
    <li> I love Neutrogna.it had helped me for many years off and on,for awhile i had stop using it and i had bad bumps and oily skin since i workout alot and sweat,so i start to use it again and man,did it work.in 3-5 days my skin was clear and no longer oily.i use it 2-3 times a day so that my face wont be so oily plus it clean your face well,i had read few reviews about it smell alil bad,i have to say it dose have a smell but i don&#x27;t mind it,as long my face stay clear.I&#x27;m a happy man.</li>
    <li> For like the first week that I started using it every time I would use it would feel like my skin was burning off. Also my face would be red for a minute or two and then it would go back to normal. But in a weird way I kinda like the burn. I don&#x27;t know. Other than that, it does its job greatly!! I use it after taking off my makeup and using the orange Neutrogena Oil-Free face wash. I do both of these twice a day! Once in the morning, and once at night. And if my skin is feeling oily and I&#x27;m redoing my makeup, I&#x27;ll take off my makeup and then use this product on my face and then I&#x27;ll redo my makeup for whatever I&#x27;m doing that night. Doing all of this, I haven&#x27;t really been acne!! I highly recommend this product :) And the Neutrogena Oil-Free face wash as well</li>
    <li> I used this twice just to make sure I wasn&#x27;t imagining the smell. To me, it smells exactly like urine. My fingers reek of it and I can even smell it on my face. I only bought this because it was $1 or more cheaper than the others. It is probably just a bad reaction to my own skin oils because in the bottle or on the cotton ball, it smells great.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll be buying another brand this evening and NEVER buying this again.</li>
    <li> It eliminates oil without drying up the face, which is perfect. However, it has this medically smell and evaporates quickly after applied to face, sometimes makes me sneeze when accidentally inhale the air when applying it.</li>
    <li> Great product! I have sensitive skin and usually acne products dry out my skin sooooo much. This product is actually really nice for right after I wash my face. Burns a bit, but that&#x27;s the alcohol. Moisturizer after and you have beautifully soft, clean skin.</li>
    <li> This product is fantastic and seems (according to its low price) to be a well-kept secret.  This product will clear up any breakouts like no other product I&#x27;ve used.  Also, I have many expensive cleansers, however, after using any one of them, this Neutrogena Clear Pore Eliminating Astringent will wipe away even more facial dirt left behind by the expensive cleanser.  Best of all, I do not find this product to be particularly drying, even though my skin is on the dry side.  I use this product every evening as my facial cleansing routine and would not be without it.  I receive compliments about my skin on a constant basis!  I highly recommend.  At its reasonable price, I encourage you to try it.</li>
    <li> if you use it consistently every night it helps prevent pimps.</li>
    <li> This Astringent, may help eliminate oil, but its very painful to me, to apply, right after cleaning your face. Others may not be so bothered by it but I can&#x27;t use it,.</li>
    <li> My dermatologist recommended this and I use it morning and night.  I ran out for a short time and started breaking out, this really helps control acne and keep skin bright and clear.  I always have it!</li>
    <li> Compared to the Biori (spelling?) product I was replacing with this one, it smells medicinal and stings the skin (even though the ingredients are nearly identical) - but my skin is looking better than it has in a long time.  (I&#x27;m using it in conjunction with Derma Topix Benzole Peroxide 10% wash.)</li>
    <li> The item says to put the substance on your skin 2-3 times a day, so I did. After about four weeks of use.... NOTHING!!!&lt;br /&gt;  It could be me but I don&#x27;t recommend the product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a guy, I don&#x27;t wash my face every night, however using this is ez and doesn&#x27;t take any time to feel good, smell good and make my woman happy...</li>
    <li> it has helped with clearing my skin a little, but it dries it out really bad and it REALLY stings when i put it on (so much so that my eyes water).</li>
    <li> This stuff kind of works, but like all store bought remedies sold in USA, the concentration of active ingredients is below the threshold strong enough to kill the underlying cause.  I get much better results by dissolving cheap aspirin (which is salicylic acid) into witch hazel, and a little magnesium chloride to keep the skin moist . Now that gets REAL results.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m going to keep this simple - I cannot use this product.  The smell reminds me of a burning bag of garbage which is a smell I never thought I would experience again.  I chucked it in the garbage can after two uses.  Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I actually quite like the typical astringent smell that comes from Sea Breeze or Witch Hazel, but this was just horrible smelling.</li>
    <li> This seemed to help a lot with keeping down oiliness, as do all products with this acid base, but the smell was a tad strong and if it touched my other skin it would dry it out too much. I was having trouble for awhile with dead skin on my fingers and I finally figured out it was from applying this stuff. Be careful about that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise it worked well for an over the counter product, reduced oiliness and excess dead skin very well</li>
    <li> If I use this every day I barely break out. Very thankful for it! Glad it&#x27;s cheap and on amazon prime</li>
    <li> I am prone to breakouts and have tried Proactiv - which does work but it is too expensive for me to keep using, especially since my problem is hormonal/occasional. This product fits my needs perfectly. Whenever I see or feel a pimple coming on, I just take a Q-tip immersed in this astringent and clean that area - and that area only. I try not to wipe my whole face with it because it is drying. Last month my whole upper chest/neck area broke out for some reason. That was when I diligently wiped that area 2x a day, morning &amp; night. Took care of the problem immediately.</li>
    <li> Complete bs that the price increased on this. I added it to my cart yesterday to purchase today (it was an add-on item, I was getting more stuff to buy) and all of a sudden there&#x27;s a price jump. No thanks!!!</li>
    <li> I have combination oily skin and my face breaks out pretty bad. I bought this stuff because the one I used to use was out of stock so I decided to try this one. My face stung and dried out after I applied it, but it worked great. After 2 weeks or so you can see the changes. Comparing to acnes, I would rather my skin to be dry. However, I do hope that Neutrogena can improve the smell and the dryness of this product.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a little cheaper at Target because that&#x27;s where I bought it. So go check there! The Clear Pore has a stinging feel to it in the beginning and its kinda tough on the eyes when you&#x27;re applying it around the cheeks and eyebrows. After applying it to a cotton ball, I rub it all around my face and it removes all the dead skin and oils off of my face. I have used this for about 2-3 weeks now and this bottle will last you a long time. But more importantly, it does significantly remove more oils from my face than other astringents. However, some people might find this astringent making your face really dry so make sure you put on some moisturizer (with less oil) on so that you can keep your skin healthy! Not only is it cheap and affordable, Neutrogena always seems to be my number one choice for sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> First of all, I have sensitive skin, so I know this isn&#x27;t for me.  But I wanted something strong and effective.  So I went with this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It burns my skin for about a minute when I apply, but after that it&#x27;s all gone!  What I actually do to help is I dampen my face with water, then apply it.  No more burning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want to see results, you have to keep up.  I apply this before bed and every morning, both after washing.  This stuff makes my oily face oil-free!  Just like it said!  It&#x27;s also cured my \\&quot;baby acne\\&quot;, I had on my forehead.  I have a clean, smooth forehead.</li>
    <li> when it arrived the content leaks from the lead.</li>
    <li> i use this on my back and it already seems to be clearing it a little. it definitely helps to clean it without overdrying!</li>
    <li> I am a fan of Neutrogena products.  So, when I was looking to find a new astringent (I used to use [[ASIN:B006UQUS4Q Biore Blemish Treating Astringent, 8 Ounce]]), I went with this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was disappointed with it though.  It was strange because it felt a little oily (which I actually felt was good because it meant it wasn&#x27;t going to dry my skin), yet it still managed to dry my skin. Within a few days, my skin was drier that it has ever been.  I only used it once a day, yet it was enough to make my skin start flaking.  I stopped using it after 2 weeks, and it took a week after that for my skin to recover - after applying multiple layers of moisturizer throughout the day.  This was so drying that my right hand (the hand that I used to apply the astringent) was also totally dry.  The skin on part of my palm and my fingers was flaking off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite my experiences, I am still giving this 3 stars because if you are someone with oily skin and suffer from acne, this would probably be fine.  I can see this working for teens, especially.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think that I am just at a point (translation: getting older, haha) that I don&#x27;t need anything as strong as this for my skin.  I have \\&quot;normal\\&quot; skin and don&#x27;t experience a lot of break outs, so I ended up going with an alcohol free toner, also by Neutrogena, instead ([[ASIN:B000U5O650 Neutrogena Alcohol-Free Toner, 8.5 Ounce]].  It works much better for my skin type and needs.</li>
    <li> This is a decent astringent. The only problem I have with it is that it has a strong odor. I have used other astringents and they don&#x27;t smell the way this one does. Other than that, it&#x27;s pretty good - gets the job done.</li>
    <li> When I apply it to my face after washing it, it makes my face itchy right after but stops itching after awhile . The good thing is it feels refreshing once you apply it to your face.</li>
    <li> My skin is disgustingly oily. I live in the South and during the summer, you can fry chicken on my face hahaha. This is the ONLY astringent that cleans my pores. I get white heads when my pores are clogged. If I don&#x27;t use this astringent, then any product I use (masques or dark spot correcters) do not work because of the clogged pores. I get dark spots and scars from acne so I try to prevent acne. I didn&#x27;t have this product for a week and my skin broke out terribly, then I had the dark marks. The salicylic acid, witch hazel, and chamomilla together help my skin for sure! BEST BEST BEST!</li>
    <li> cant use it - smells awful - need spmething as strong and effective but no odor thank u so much</li>
    <li> This is the best pore cleaner.  Look who makes it.  All there products are wonderful and will not ever change.  I would recommend.</li>
    <li> but cheaper.  With 7 people, 5 of them kids, we have a lot of expenses.  Saving a few bucks where we can, is the great and this helps fill the bill.</li>
    <li> I have pretty sensitive and oily skin, and it burns so much! I usually love Neutrogena stuff but this is bad!</li>
    <li> Great product and am completely satisfied. No issues whatsoever. Will recommend to anyone interested in this product. Will do business again with.</li>
    <li> Good product&lt;br /&gt;Does the job&lt;br /&gt;Will recommend it to others&lt;br /&gt;Good for the price&lt;br /&gt;No problems so far. With it.</li>
    <li> I used a washcloth to apply this to my face tonight and I thought it smelled just like cat urine.  I threw the washcloth in the laundry basket afterwards and a couple minutes later my dog began barking at it and then preceded to shake it and rip it up as if it was an actual small animal!  I am never using this stuff again!</li>
    <li> I continue to use Neutrogena Clear Pore Oil Eliminating Astringent because it works.  The only problem that I had with this purchase is that it leaked in the mail.  Fortunately, it was wrapped in plastic and the loss was minimal but it was disappointing not to receive the full amount of liquid.</li>
    <li> PRODUCT WAS EVERYTHING I HOPED FOR AND MORE!</li>
    <li> What they don&#x27;t tell you about this product is that it smells HORRENDOUS. The smell is like that of rodent urine with a hint of mint. It&#x27;s most especially noticeable if you use it on and around your nose. Thankfully, most of it goes away after about half an hour. Though I&#x27;m not sure if it actually went away or I just got used to the smell...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as how well it works, that&#x27;s the only thing keeping this review at 3 stars. Works exceptionally well.</li>
    <li> Best product for my cystic rosacea.</li>
    <li> This is a really nice astringent. I mix  it about 40/60 with pure witch hazel, and it adds just the right amount of scent and &amp;#34;zing&amp;#34; to make it perfect.</li>
    <li> Did not order this because my face does not take oil well!</li>
    <li> I have EXTREMELY oily skin (T-zone) and rosacea. (Bad mix).. I have been using this product for a couple weeks now and my skin is less shiny and I have NO breakouts! I use it in the morning and then again after I get home from work. I would use it in the evening as well but I have to use the medication for my rosacea and not sure if it would make for a bad combination. My skin is not dried out anywhere on my face. The smell isn&#x27;t to bad. Similar to an antiseptic. My pores are much less visable on my nose as well!! I would recommend this product to anyone with skin problems like mine!!</li>
    <li> Smells kinda bad and dries out my skin too much.</li>
    <li> So far, this is a good product. Its clearing up small bumps and I&#x27;ll continue to use it. I&#x27;ll ptobably buy it again when its finished. I like that I can apply a little to the cotton ball so I have alot left.</li>
    <li> Great addition to my skin care routine, dries out blemishes virtually overnight. A little harsh on your skin if you&#x27;re sensitive like me, so make sure to pair with plenty of moisturizing products!</li>
    <li> I recommend this for those with oily and drk skin!! Wonderful product</li>
