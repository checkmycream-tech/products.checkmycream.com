      <li>Love it!</li>
      <li>This medium is more like a porcelain bisque!  </li>
      <li>This product is really nice; however, I would recommend that you be sure of your skin tone</li>
      <li>honestly they are about 2 shades off med to me is ultra light in powder!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve said this before but bare escentuals is the best foundation</li>
      <li>This foundation is very light since it&#x27;s a powder.</li>
      <li>I love BE compressed make up.</li>
      <li>I love this foundation, yes you need to go darker when you are picking a shade</li>
      <li>I love the compact and it lasts forever.</li>
      <li>I love this which you use a brush to put the foundation on.  </li>
      <li>I got two more for my daughter and sisters.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very easy to apply, has good coverage and looks quite natural if you buff it in well.</li>
      <li>Just lightly tap it on top once or twice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>A huge improvement.</li>
      <li>I liked it so much</li>
      <li>As it turns out, the medium in the pressed form is A LOT lighter than the original.</li>
      <li>I have been brushing on some of the original foundation after applying this to add color.  </li>
      <li>UPDATED - I was photographed recently with this product on and was horrified to realize how really light the product was - I had used it to touch up just before the photo and didn&#x27;t apply it in good lighting.  </li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t settle into lines and looks fresh all day, which is a huge plus for me.</li>
      <li>I do recommend you also purchase two more products to make this makeup really work well.</li>
      <li>and I like this Ready foundation better than the lose powder.</li>
      <li>This particular product is more for someone with a cool tone vs. warm/golden.  </li>
      <li>LOVE the new compact!</li>
      <li>However, it&#x27;s super convenient.</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t found a Bare Mineral product yet that I haven&#x27;t liked.  </li>
      <li>I have flawless skin now and after a long day my face has no oil and looks the same as it did when I first put it on!</li>
      <li>and I think it provides better coverage than the loose powder, still very light weight.</li>
      <li>This is great when traveling though much easier than the loose powder.</li>
      <li>I do like this better than their loose powder as I feel it gives a bit more coverage and is easier to blend.  </li>
      <li>I was a light in the original product and chose the medium in the new product.</li>
      <li>The ready precision face brush is a must to apply the foundation, it makes a huge difference.</li>
      <li>I find that this version has a bit more coverage which is nice but for everyday errands</li>
      <li>It last on your face and honestly you don&#x27;t need a lot.</li>
      <li>I love this product and all my bare essentials!</li>
      <li>Bare Escentuals is my favorite foundation.</li>
      <li>I was told it was the new light.</li>
      <li>Arrived on time and is exactly what I ordered.</li>
      <li>I went back and purchased another shade that better suited me.</li>
      <li>This would be great if the solid colors matched up to the loose.</li>
      <li>I love this Ready formula - definitely find your color in a store first because they do not match the BM powder formulas.  </li>
      <li>I highly recommend going into a retail store that carries it for the first time so you can match your skin to the makeup.</li>
      <li>I wear medium in Ready, but fairly light in the regular foundation.</li>
      <li>This ready to wear all over face cover up, hides all of my blemishes.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s much much lighter.</li>
      <li>my make up wedge/sponge, dab a bit of the READY on the sponge and apply it to the offending area.  </li>
      <li>It does however leave a very matte look to the face, so if you want a dewy look, I&#x27;d either get liquid foundation, or learn to highlight and contour</li>
      <li>Thanks</li>
      <li>It goes on looking really chalky and the shade does not match the label.</li>
      <li>I am a long time user of bare escentuals/bare minerals make-up and I am thrilled with the ready foundation.</li>
      <li>They are a real pain when you wear glasses.</li>
      <li>But based on other reviews and my own experience, I have a few tips to make this a more valuable purchase:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I have been using bare minerals for many years now but just recently switched over to their pressed compacts.</li>
      <li>I used the regular foundation from Bare MInerals, and like this much better.</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t forget to go outside in natural light before deciding which is your shade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I usually use the loose powder, this compact is great</li>
      <li>I search high and low for the right foundation.</li>
      <li>However after trying various colors at the store, I learned that Medium is still the right color.  </li>
      <li>I have worn Bare Minerals for around 15 years now, and this particular foundation in Ready is perfect&lt;br /&gt;for</li>
      <li>I live in AZ and it doesn&#x27;t clog my pores or make me sweaty like liquid foundation</li>
      <li>Such a pretty case too</li>
      <li>is number 1 as far as I&#x27;m concerned.</li>
      <li>Just make sure it is flat and the bristles are tight and dense.</li>
      <li>I think it is a little lighter than Medium in the original foundation.  </li>
      <li>... Thought I&#x27;d try something new but staying with my Bare Minerals.</li>
      <li>If you put it on very lightly (never press too hard with your brush), it comes out looking great on your skin.</li>
      <li>but once I found the right one for me, I haven&#x27;t used any other foundation.</li>
      <li>color is definitely not the same as the original loose powder foundation.</li>
      <li>I always use the medium shade with the original Bare Minerals, but this medium is so pale , I look as if I put flour on my face.</li>
      <li>If you put too much, you&#x27;re going to look dry and cakey.</li>
      <li>It is light and hardly looks like you have makeup at all.</li>
      <li>You do need to apply some sort of moisturizer first if your skin is oily, though, or it will look dry and flat.</li>
      <li>But have to be careful on applying too much</li>
      <li>I have been using bare minerals for years now</li>
      <li>nice powder, wrong shade for me though</li>
      <li>I used to use the regular bare escentuals foundation in Medium</li>

    <li> I usually use the loose powder, this compact is great and I think it provides better coverage than the loose powder, still very light weight.</li>
    <li> I have worn Bare Minerals for around 15 years now, and this particular foundation in Ready is perfect&lt;br /&gt;for covering imperfections. Such a pretty case too, I didn&#x27;t expect the silver finish. Thanks</li>
    <li> I love this Ready formula - definitely find your color in a store first because they do not match the BM powder formulas.  Great coverage.</li>
    <li> Great want to order another!</li>
    <li> I love this which you use a brush to put the foundation on.  It is light and hardly looks like you have makeup at all. I liked it so much I got two more for my daughter and sisters.</li>
    <li> The product was broken so I had to send it back.</li>
    <li> I love this product and all my bare essentials!</li>
    <li> I have been using bare minerals for many years now but just recently switched over to their pressed compacts. My son was making a mess out of the loose powders so it had to be done. I find that this version has a bit more coverage which is nice but for everyday errands I like a bit lighter coverage so I stick with (what&#x27;s left of) my loose powder. This is great when traveling though much easier than the loose powder.</li>
    <li> Great make up! leaves your skin flawless ! But have to be careful on applying too much and it&#x27;ll show, the color is a lot different than their powder foundation  honestly they are about 2 shades off med to me is ultra light in powder!</li>
    <li> I love BE compressed make up. This ready to wear all over face cover up, hides all of my blemishes.&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t like the loose powder ones offered by BE. They are a real pain when you wear glasses. Another thing to worry about is spilling the goods.</li>
    <li> I do like this better than their loose powder as I feel it gives a bit more coverage and is easier to blend.  It also lasts forever, one compact, used daily, will last me two or three months.  It does however leave a very matte look to the face, so if you want a dewy look, I&#x27;d either get liquid foundation, or learn to highlight and contour (which is what I do).  It also can work well as a concealer.  I simply slightly wet my make up wedge/sponge, dab a bit of the READY on the sponge and apply it to the offending area.  It works great!</li>
    <li> I am a long time user of bare escentuals/bare minerals make-up and I am thrilled with the ready foundation. But based on other reviews and my own experience, I have a few tips to make this a more valuable purchase:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The color is definitely not the same as the original loose powder foundation. You will need to go a shade or two darker. I highly recommend going into a retail store that carries it for the first time so you can match your skin to the makeup. Don&#x27;t forget to go outside in natural light before deciding which is your shade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Application of this make-up is different than for other products that look similar. You do want a flat, dense brush, but you don&#x27;t have to buy an expensive one from this company. Just make sure it is flat and the bristles are tight and dense. DO NOT swirl the brush in the make-up. Just lightly tap it on top once or twice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With these techniques, I get compliments all the time on how great my skin looks for my age. People don&#x27;t even think I am wearing foundation.</li>
    <li> This would be great if the solid colors matched up to the loose. As it turns out, the medium in the pressed form is A LOT lighter than the original. I have a hard time finding this in stock at Sephora, so I can&#x27;t really get a color match on it. However, it&#x27;s super convenient.

    <li> Unfortunately when I received this the makeup was cracked into several pieces. Still waiting for second one!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve said this before but bare escentuals is the best foundation is number 1 as far as I&#x27;m concerned. It last on your face and honestly you don&#x27;t need a lot. I always buy from amazon because 1st and foremost amazon rocks great pricing on all thier products.</li>
    <li> This makeup is for the person who likes to brush on mineral makeup and go.  It is perfect for one coat and no fuss application with the precision brush.  I will be purchasing again!</li>
    <li> Perfect &amp; great price</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used mineral foundation in the past....but I had a really hard time not making a mess with it :-(  This is great!!  Applies and covers just like the loose powder, but oh, so neatly.  A huge improvement.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t found a Bare Mineral product yet that I haven&#x27;t liked.  This product is really nice; however, I would recommend that you be sure of your skin tone so you pick the best shade for you.  This particular product is more for someone with a cool tone vs. warm/golden.  I went back and purchased another shade that better suited me.</li>
    <li> I search high and low for the right foundation. This is the best for me. It doesn&#x27;t settle into lines and looks fresh all day, which is a huge plus for me. I&#x27;ve recommended it to several ladies and will continue to do so.</li>
    <li> This medium is more like a porcelain bisque!  So upset...wasted money.  It looks like I am a corpse when I put it on.</li>
    <li> Eh... So so... Thought I&#x27;d try something new but staying with my Bare Minerals.</li>
    <li> LOVE the new compact!</li>
    <li> Great product, good cover-up for rosacea, acne, skin imperfections. People always complement my skin even though under this product it is not that great!</li>
    <li> nice powder, wrong shade for me though</li>
    <li> I have been using bare minerals for years now and I like this Ready foundation better than the lose powder. I was a light in the original product and chose the medium in the new product. I was told it was the new light. It is perfect for my skin tone. I do recommend you also purchase two more products to make this makeup really work well. The ready precision face brush is a must to apply the foundation, it makes a huge difference. Also if you have noticeable pores I recommend the porefessional primer. Apply it to the problem areas before you apply the foundation. These 3 products are must haves! I have flawless skin now and after a long day my face has no oil and looks the same as it did when I first put it on! Love it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this brand for years and have been happy. I&#x27;m disappointed that the compact does not match the loose powder shades. It&#x27;s much much lighter.</li>
    <li> I used to use the regular bare escentuals foundation in Medium but I just wasn&#x27;t getting the coverage I wanted.  I like the texture of this- I apply it with a cosmetic sponge.  It is hard to describe as it is still a powder but you get excellent coverage.  I think it is a little lighter than Medium in the original foundation.  I have been brushing on some of the original foundation after applying this to add color.  UPDATED - I was photographed recently with this product on and was horrified to realize how really light the product was - I had used it to touch up just before the photo and didn&#x27;t apply it in good lighting.  I looked like a vampire!  This prompted me to go to a retail store to purchase some in a darker color.  However after trying various colors at the store, I learned that Medium is still the right color.  The compact I bought on Amazon was simply too light and this makes me suspect that it is a fake product!  Too bad I paid full price on Amazon.</li>
    <li> I love the compact and it lasts forever. I&#x27;m a fan for life!</li>
    <li> I used the regular foundation from Bare MInerals, and like this much better. It&#x27;s very easy to apply, has good coverage and looks quite natural if you buff it in well. You do need to apply some sort of moisturizer first if your skin is oily, though, or it will look dry and flat. I wear medium in Ready, but fairly light in the regular foundation.</li>
    <li> It goes on looking really chalky and the shade does not match the label. I always use the medium shade with the original Bare Minerals, but this medium is so pale , I look as if I put flour on my face.</li>
    <li> This foundation is very light since it&#x27;s a powder. I live in AZ and it doesn&#x27;t clog my pores or make me sweaty like liquid foundation does. it&#x27;s also a nice size for my purse!</li>
    <li> Arrived on time and is exactly what I ordered. I love this foundation, yes you need to go darker when you are picking a shade but once I found the right one for me, I haven&#x27;t used any other foundation. I have auburn hair with fair skin, i use to buy cover girl liquid Ivory and this shade is perfect for me!</li>
    <li> Bare Escentuals is my favorite foundation. If I buy any other brands, I am never satisfied. This was a great deal, cheaper than buying at the store.</li>
