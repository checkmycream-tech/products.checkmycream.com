<li> The oil could be a little thicker or substantive.</li>
<li> Its just a little thin especially for winter moisturizing.</li>
<li> IF I USE IT EVERYDAY.</li>
<li> but it&#x27;s too thin yo hold up.</li>
<li> and I have been using cold pressed coconut oil for some time.  </li>
<li> Couldn&#x27;t even use it because it smelled terrible.</li>

    <li> I mix a little of this in with my body lotion for extra richness. It keeps my legs and arms from getting dry throughout the day and adds a little sheen. I knocked off one star because instead of the first ingredient being coconut oil it was mineral oil. It has a good smell without being overpowering. I probably won&#x27;t reorder because I prefer a true coconut oil, but don&#x27;t let this deter you if you&#x27;re looking for a decent body oil with a good smell.</li>
    <li> The product has 3 ingredients; Mineral oil, Coconut oil, and Fragrance.  I am not 100% positive what Mineral Oil is, but everything I have read about it is rather negative.</li>
    <li> My second bottle love it use it on my face a definite change in my skin softer face looks softer and I have sensitive skin know breakouts !</li>
    <li> I love the way my skin feels after using this coconut oil. The smell makes you feel like you&#x27;re in the Virgin Islands too.  Thanks for having it in stock.</li>
    <li> Love coconut smell and use it in my hair after  I wash it.</li>
    <li> Coconut oil has many natural benefits for the skin and hair. I love the natural scent of the oil as well as massaging my skin with it after showers. Great product--just don&#x27;t use it on you face. I recommend something more cream-based for the skin on your face.</li>

    <li> I love this stuff, it keeps my skin soft all day and smells so good... I use it just out of the shower...</li>
    <li> Smells good, absorbs fast, available for body and hair, perfect for winters, what else can I say? I will come back and buy it again!</li>
    <li> This is a great product for massaging your girlfriend. It evaporates slowly, allowing for very long and sensual body rubs. No problem getting it all over her lady parts. And if your tongue later finds the same bits of skin, the mild taste is enjoyable.</li>
    <li> Bought this, used it twice, been sitting in the back of the cupboard since. Didn&#x27;t work on my skin at all. I&#x27;ll just stick to my regular coconut oil.</li>
    <li> love this oil, I use it everyday after the shower.  Also use as make up remover, hair moisturizer, on dry lips...it works for almost everything! not to mention, it smells AMAZING!</li>
    <li> I bought this to help with stretch marks while pregnant. It smells great, not real greasy once rubbed in, and I haven&#x27;t gotten not one mark &#x3D;). I would say BUY THIS to any expecting mom</li>
    <li> I am using it  a medium to dilute the lavender oil in a diffuser. The coconut oil has a very soft scent and blends well with other fragrances.</li>

    <li> I love this oil especially with summer being upon us very good product. Thank you.</li>
    <li> This is not coconut oil. This item is made of lanolin oil. The only reason I give it a 2star is because I use it for my son&#x27;s bath.</li>
    <li> This is mineral oil with a nice smell, I dont think I wiil buy it again or recomended because in the market is real coconut oil for the same price.</li>
    <li> Nice, light scent. Absorbs quickly and leaves my skin super soft! Works much better than the department store stuff I was buying.</li>

    <li> I love the smell and it makes my skin so smooth.  I use it after I shower instead of lotion.  The hint of coconut smells great and doesn&#x27;t interfer with other perfumes that I wear.</li>
    <li> Would be better if this product didn&#x27;t have mineral oil but still a good product.</li>
    <li> Good lotion but it&#x27;s too thin yo hold up. I have to add other coconut oil up it.</li>

    <li> It&#x27;s a nice oil and smells good, but I think using unrefined coconut oil from the grocery store does a better job of moisturizing.</li>
    <li> makes me break out, sigh.</li>
    <li> SMELLS GOOD, NOT EXPENSIVE, KEEPS SKIN SOFT BUT IT IS OIL SO DONT USE ON HAIR UNLESS YOU WASH IT AFTERWARDS. UNLESS YOU LIKE OILY HAIR.MY SKIN DOES LOOK LESS WRINKLRD IF I USE IT EVERYDAY.</li>
    <li> Little watery bur overall good oil for your money.</li>
    <li> I have very dry skin due to thyroid condition and I have been using cold pressed coconut oil for some time.  I purchased this product to try an oil that did not need refrigeration and I am very pleased with the product.</li>

    <li> I recommend this product. Great for skin after a shower and has a mild, pleasant scent. It leaves my skin feeling nourished, but it doesn&#x27;t work well for drier skin.</li>
    <li> I ordered this because I thought it was pure coconut oil.  Its actually mostly mineral oil.  I still smells nice but not what I was looking for.</li>
    <li> Great stuff, but too expensive for the amount you get.  I emptied it out into my big bottle of lotion, and it smells great.</li>

    <li> This oil feels good, has a mild cocnut smell and keeps my skin looking nice and tan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Quick and easy order</li>
    <li> Not as great as Dominican coconut oil, but it does have an excellent fragrance. Better for a massage oil than an all over body moisturizer.</li>
    <li> I have been using this body oil for years now. It is excellent for skin, goes on smooth and not a strong smell. I could not find it anywhere in town so glad was able to buy on Amazon.com.  It lasts a long time, good for bath or just daily skin use.&lt;br /&gt;I would highly recommend this oil, it is worth the money.</li>
    <li> I use this after I shower and love it!  Makes my skin so soft and smells great!</li>
