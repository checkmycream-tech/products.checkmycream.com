      <li>This is  the  best  hair oil for my ethnic curly  </li>

      <li>and  it  has a wonderful aroma.</li>
      <li>It has the perfect amount of weight for my hair</li>
      <li>I use it on my twists to seal and this is the best sealant ever.</li>
      <li>and I had heard alot of great things about Carol&#x27;s Daughter products.</li>
      <li>I am happy with this product.</li>
      <li>but I do understand how it can be a great product for some.   </li>
      <li>Since then, I have nothing but great things to report.</li>
      <li>If you&#x27;ve damaged your hair with chemicals, heat and dye, this is a great moisturizer.  </li>
      <li>and I had some great definition results on a twist out.</li>

      <li>well, the Carol&#x27;s Daughter hair butter smells great, feels great, but it doesn&#x27;t moisturize for long unless I use a generous amount.</li>
      <li>It smells fresh and pleasant and keeps my hair moisturized.</li>
      <li>The fragrance is also refreshing.</li>
      <li>Some of the products had an OK smell but this was unbearable.  </li>

      <li>I like it a lot more.</li>

      <li>:) MMMM....</li>
      <li>But, your hair will also benefit if it is healthy.  </li>
      <li>Makes it more managable.</li>
      <li>So glad she does not have to go through the pain I went through as a child just to get my hair presentable.</li>
      <li>I am most satisfied when I use it at night.  </li>
      <li>to  try  more Carol&#x27;s Daughter&#x27;s  products.</li>
      <li>To give you more insight on my hair and styling preference, I process my hair every 6 to 8 weeks.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m so glad I got this for 50% off.  </li>
      <li>Also, the scent is overwhelming and lingers.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve found (from using this product in a mutitude of ways) that it is ABSOLUTELY PERFECT for doing double strands twists:    </li>
      <li>Love it love</li>
      <li>This product makes our hair more manageable, and works wonders when applied before braiding, plaiting, or twisting the hair.</li>
      <li>I absolutely love it.</li>
      <li>Makes hair smell awesome, and different.  </li>
      <li>and I just want to sing from the rooftops how pleased I am.  </li>
      <li>8)</li>
      <li>I bought Carol&#x27;s Daughter Healthy Hair Butter a month or so ago.</li>
      <li>However, placed in the hair I definitely love it.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad I had the opportunity to check the products out before purchasing online.</li>
      <li>We are both pleased.</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s great now thanks to this fabulous butter.  </li>
      <li>It makes  my hair  very  very  soft and  a great  detangler too and  </li>
      <li>The Healthy Hair Butter (HHB) is a light, absorbant hair dress and not tacky to the touch.</li>
      <li>but surprisingly this really works for me.  </li>
      <li>Separately they are good, but together they are too much.     </li>
      <li>Holy cow, my hair is awesome!!  </li>
      <li>so easy  </li>
      <li>Some people say that the smell is too strong, but I like it</li>
      <li>It is ideal for exceptionally dry hair.</li>
      <li>This is an AWESOME product to have if you consistently wear double strand twists!</li>
      <li>It smelled non-descript when I first opened up the jar, but after rubbing it in my hands and smoothing it on my hair, it took on a very strong, herbal odor.    </li>
      <li>Gives a great shine (when smoothed in properly)  9)</li>
      <li>I would always notice such great change in my hair once i used this HHB.</li>
      <li>Its rich and creamy and non greasy for keeping the scalp moist.</li>
      <li>It has all the ingredients my 4a hair loves like: shea butter, sweet almond oil, &amp; jojoba oil.</li>
      <li>I think it works better on straight hair or hair types with loser curls.</li>
      <li>I am  ordering  3 more  for  the  whole family.  </li>
      <li>, it has a very earthy smell that just isn&#x27;t that appealing.</li>
      <li>I love CD&#x27;s all natural products since they are free from petroleum, mineral oil, sulfates and parabens...</li>
      <li>The delivery was fast and it was packaged well so great service overall.</li>
      <li>This is the second time that I have bought this product, and I am again very satisfied.</li>
      <li>The hair butter softened and moisturized my hair very nicely, but the potential for weighing it down and the precise science needed to get the right amount is kind of a turn off.  </li>
      <li>I think the HHB + the Black Vanilla leave in conditioner spray or any of the CD leave in sprays would be a great combination.  </li>
      <li>Also, I find the smell very pleasing and not at all strong.  </li>
      <li>and you get your money&#x27;s worth.</li>
      <li>Using HHB my hair becomes soft, managable, and my curls are more defined.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I love the  product so far and have in between 4 b and 4c hair texture.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried multiple Carol&#x27;s Daughter products and for me, each of them has been kind of hit or miss.  </li>
      <li>so I am still in pursuit of the right moisturizers and cleaners. &#x3D;</li>
      <li>Yeah right.  </li>
      <li>Liked it so much I bought two larger jars from Carol&#x27;s Daughter.</li>
      <li>I have short, coarse, curly hair, and the hair butter works great as a leave-in conditioner.</li>
      <li>However, I wanted to try the Healthy Hair Butter - wow, equally smooth and creamy and instantly moisturized my hair.     </li>
      <li>and I can&#x27;t argue with any of them because I understand exactly where they are coming from.</li>
      <li>COULD NOT BELIEVE HOW FAST I RECEIVE THE ORDER!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m in love with the Mimosa Hair Honey and the entire Tui line, but there are a couple of products (Hair milk/Healthy Hair Butter)</li>
      <li>Overall ok product.</li>
      <li>This was our first purchase.</li>
      <li>The first time I used this butter</li>
      <li>;)</li>
      <li>This must be an improved formula because it works better than when I first tried it a while back!</li>
      <li>I have to say that this is exactly what I have been looking for.</li>
      <li>I paid a pretty penny for it though, so</li>
      <li>Spray first and then put the HHB to lock in</li>
      <li>I have very coarse hair, this product makes my hair easier to comb and shiny :)</li>
      <li>but my hair actually responds better to the Carol&#x27;s Daughter line (except for Shea Moisture&#x27;s shampoo</li>
      <li>B00016X3KC Giovanni Hair Care - Styling L.A. Natural Gel, 8.5 fl oz gel]] arrives so I can have beautiful, natural curls on lock all summer long!</li>
      <li>He told me not to tell the other clients, it would hurt his special treatment business:-)</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> This hair butter is very concentrated.  It is a mousse,but it feels both ight and  heavy at the same time so use it sparingly.  Honestly you only need a little bit.  I put it on my finger tips and work it through my hair.  Only two &#x27;five finger-tip&#x27; applications through wet hair and I feel that it makes my hair nicely pliable and gives it a little extra sheen.  It also defines my curls without making them feel weighted down.  I have the 4-ounce bottle and it is small, but I have had it for a couple months and haven&#x27;t finished it.  A little goes along way and you get your money&#x27;s worth.</li>
    <li> Smaller than I expected, but works well and hydrates my hair.</li>
    <li> I was a bit apprehensive in purchasing this product cause some people said they couldn&#x27;t stand the smell. The smell is somewhat pine. However, placed in the hair I definitely love it.  It does exactly as described, it moisturizes and makes hair so soft!  It soaks into the hair very easily and can put used on wet or dry hair. I prefer using it on dry hair for moisture</li>
    <li> I really wanted to like this product and have read other reviews on it. Unfortunately, I was never able to actually use it because as soon as I opened it the smell overpowered me. It smells way too strong and the scent itself is an odd combination of ingredients. To me it smelled kind of like an Asian food market, with all kinds of spices and herbs mixed together. Separately they are good, but together they are too much.     We had planned to used this on our infant daughter&#x27;s hair, but there was simply no way it would work for her simply because of the scent.  I wonder if all Carol&#x27;s Daughter products smell the same way? This was our first purchase. I think next time I will purchase in store to smell prior to buying. Since I bought from Amazon through Macy&#x27;s I was unable to return to the Macy&#x27;s store and had to ship it back to the tune of a $7 fee...the product itself only cost $10.50. Disappointing.</li>
    <li> I got this as a sample from Ricky&#x27;s. I really wanted to buy the Miss Jessie&#x27;s baby-butter cream, but decided to give this a shot.&lt;br /&gt;Ehhhh....I have really thick, coarse &amp; mostly dry 4a/b type African American hair.&lt;br /&gt;My hair has been very dehydrated for the past few moths &amp; breaking so I am still in pursuit of the right moisturizers and cleaners. &#x3D;/&lt;br /&gt;Oh well, the Carol&#x27;s Daughter hair butter smells great, feels great, but it doesn&#x27;t moisturize for long unless I use a generous amount. Secondly, it does weigh down the hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have MIXED feelings. I think it works better on straight hair or hair types with loser curls. It just didn&#x27;t really work for me!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will maybe try it again. I hope this helped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Peace &amp; love!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~Pepper</li>
    <li> I have 4B type hair and, when used to do two strand twists, moisturize my hair very well. I installed small sized twists on monday, took them out on Thursday and have been wearing a twist out since. I haven&#x27;t had to remoisturize my hair at all since installing my twists with the healthy hair butter. I would recommend this product for two strand twists or a twist out.</li>
    <li> I tried to like this product that I got as part of the Carol&#x27;s Daughter transitioning set. I wanted to like it but wasn&#x27;t impressed. I&#x27;ve been using it one to two times per week with no noticeable results.  It does not hydrate, soften, tame or strengthen.  It does not even smell all that wonderful. While I didn&#x27;t notice any detrimental effects, the product should be beneficial somehow...In sum, carefully consider all of the other better possibilities out there before choosing this expensive useless product.</li>
    <li> I used this in my pre-teen daughter&#x27;s hair. She has thick, shoulder length hair. It is quite difficult to manage her hair. She washed her hair 2 weeks after I used it and her hair was so soft and she told me she forgot to use a conditioner. This is the miracle product for her thick hair. Makes it more managable. So glad she does not have to go through the pain I went through as a child just to get my hair presentable. We are both pleased.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for a few years now. The 4 oz size is small for the price you pay, but it last a long time. I don&#x27;t use it every day, so that helps. I rub it in my hair before wrapping it at night. The next morning my hair is soft and smooth without feeling greasy. Some people say that the smell is too strong, but I like it and I don&#x27;t usually like any strong scents.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried multiple Carol&#x27;s Daughter products and for me, each of them has been kind of hit or miss.  I&#x27;m in love with the Mimosa Hair Honey and the entire Tui line, but there are a couple of products (Hair milk/Healthy Hair Butter) I&#x27;ve tried that weren&#x27;t up to par with what I was hoping to get from them.  I do love that the Healthy Hair Butter does a decent job at moisturizing my hair but the smell is pretty overwhelming..almost as if I crushed up a box of sandalwood fragranced insence and then rubbed it throughout my entire head.  I paid a pretty penny for it though, so I&#x27;m going to try to stick it out and hopefully I&#x27;ll get used to the smell.  DEFINITELY not a product for someone with fragrance-induced allergies.</li>
    <li> Ive been hearing rave reviews about the Carol&#x27;s daughter line for years. I decided to purchase this after relocating to the dry areas of California. Well I was disappointed with this product overall but I do understand how it can be a great product for some.   I process my hair, so maybe this is why my experience has been a bit different than other reviewers. This stuff is pretty thick, smells awful, and doesnt add any shine to the hair. Oh did I say it smells awful?! I then zoomed in on the ingredients and noticed it had beeswax in it. Well Im sorry but beeswax is prettty heavy for my liking. I like moisture BUT also MOVEMENT, not a stiff drying looking, smelly hair. Plus I had to reapply this stuff the next day.   To give you more insight on my hair and styling preference, I process my hair every 6 to 8 weeks. I wash my hair every 4 to 6 days. I sometimes let me hair air dry and will flat iron it at least once a week.</li>
    <li> I have short, coarse, curly hair, and the hair butter works great as a leave-in conditioner. There&#x27;s a definite herbal smell, not unpleasant, and fades quickly. Doesn&#x27;t provide control on it&#x27;s own, so I use it with pomade.</li>
    <li> I am transitioning from a relaxer to natural style and I had heard alot of great things about Carol&#x27;s Daughter products. I guess that I should have listened to previous reviewers about the smell of this product.  After getting over the smell, I tried it anyway to see if it worked better than it smelled. After one use, my hair actually looked and felt extremely hard and dry.  I don&#x27;t think that I will be using this product again. it definitely did not live up to the hype. Return to sender.</li>
    <li> COULD NOT BELIEVE HOW FAST I RECEIVE THE ORDER! THE PRODUCT SEEMS VERY HEALTHY FOR THE HAIR, BUT DID NOT GIVE ME THE SHINE I WAS LOOKING FOR.</li>
    <li> This product has more than surpassed my expectations. This product makes our hair more manageable, and works wonders when applied before braiding, plaiting, or twisting the hair. Liked it so much I bought two larger jars from Carol&#x27;s Daughter.</li>
    <li> I like this product because it keeps my hair manageable and I recommended it to my family. The fragrance is also refreshing.</li>
    <li> I see a lot of mediocre reviews on this product and I can&#x27;t argue with any of them because I understand exactly where they are coming from. I&#x27;ve been natural for 4 yrs and I use a lot of Carol&#x27;s Daughter products and they do work (on average) better than anything I can find in the store, so I&#x27;ll give her that.    I&#x27;ve found (from using this product in a mutitude of ways) that it is ABSOLUTELY PERFECT for doing double strands twists:    1) It strecthes out the twists making them appear longer.  2) The hair stays moisturized for weeks with the twists still in (as long as you       wear a satin scarf at night and don&#x27;t wash the hair)  3) It saves your ends from drying out, getting messy, or unraveling.  4) It keeps your parts defined longer  5) It doesn&#x27;t weigh the hair down if you don&#x27;t use too much on each section.  6) Makes hair smell awesome, and different.  7) Won&#x27;t interfere with other products you add (like oil sheen the next day)  8) Gives a great shine (when smoothed in properly)  9) Makes twists look defined.  10) Keeps twists soft, protected, and bouncy.  11) Makes twists look neat and uniform (lays down random curles that my pop out)  12) Eliminates frizz from double strand twists that usually appear a few days later       when other products (like twist n loc wax or gel) are used.    I also use this stuff to smooth down my hair when I want to throw it in a pony puff, I have to brush it down then slip on a headband for it to work but once the hair dries then the hair does lay flat and is pretty soft.    This is an AWESOME product to have if you consistently wear double strand twists! You will see less breakage and protected strands!</li>
    <li> It works well with my thick hair, Makes it more manageable. It does have a metholl smell to it. I brought it also for my sister who loves it.</li>
    <li> I have tried a lot of products since going natural a year ago. I have to say that this is exactly what I have been looking for. The consistency is thick and creamy and has a similar smell to Noxzema which was weird but I am still very pleased with the product. I bought the 4oz but I will be ordering the 8oz. I am a 4b natural and my hair loves this stuff. It keeps it soft and moisturized and I had some great definition results on a twist out. It has the perfect amount of weight for my hair and it didn&#x27;t leave my hair oily. I am happy with this product. The delivery was fast and it was packaged well so great service overall.</li>
    <li> I got 2 4-oz jars of this for free at the Carol&#x27;s Daughter store when I spent over $150 there.  I wasn&#x27;t going to try it, but one day my hair was so very dry so I tried a dollop.  I used too much, so it weighed my hair down.  I tried it once more a different day, this time a VERY small amount, and it was far better.  I have straight relaxed hair a little past my shoulders.  So here&#x27;s the deal - because it&#x27;s so thick, you have to work with it to get the right amount to use in your hair.  Because my hair is so thick and kind of long, I am used to using a lot of product to moisturize it properly.  With this, I used the amount that can fit on the pads of two fingers (index and middle) and that was enough to moisturize my hair.  The hair butter softened and moisturized my hair very nicely, but the potential for weighing it down and the precise science needed to get the right amount is kind of a turn off.  Also, it smells pretty bad.</li>
    <li> I use hair butter occasionally on my long(ish), thick, straight hair.  I apply a very little bit to my wet hair and am pleased with the results.  I am most satisfied when I use it at night.  Also, I find the smell very pleasing and not at all strong.  I use Aveda products and would say the strength of smell is comparable.  My husband loves the hair butter!  He has thin, dry, curly hair.  This product conditions and defines his curls.  It is ideal for exceptionally dry hair.</li>
    <li> I bought Carol&#x27;s Daughter Healthy Hair Butter a month or so ago. I have relaxed, fine hair that usually gets dry and starts to break. Since I&#x27;ve been using this product, I&#x27;ve noticed that my hair feels a lot softer and doesn&#x27;t break as much. I use a little throughout my scalp and on my ends at night and wrap it before it bed. The smell doesn&#x27;t bother me, but I would recommend this product for those who have dry hair.</li>
    <li> This stinks and I do not see any change to use.</li>
    <li> Beyond Amazing! It helps Grow my hair!&lt;br /&gt;Love this and have used it for years. I would always notice such great change in my hair once i used this HHB. It finally hit me one day it wasn&#x27;t being carried at sephora anymore and I have to stock up on it.!! I use it on my weak crown area and it gives my THICK FULL ROOTS EVERY-TIME ;) XOXOX i THINK ITS THE ROSEMARY AND SAGE IN IT :) MMMM....</li>
    <li> This product is heaven sent to people who suffers from dull dry hair...Love it love it love it!! Try it on natural or permed hair you won&#x27;t be sorry..</li>
    <li> I love the  product so far and have in between 4 b and 4c hair texture. My hair thick medium long very coarse  very dry and thirsty requiring  a lot of moisture however one application about one tablespoonful of this product deeply penetrates  and conditions my hair all the way to the ends for three full days without a new application. Thank God after a lot of trial and error with many other  brands...this is the only one thats ever really worked for me!</li>
    <li> if has a funny smell not bad, it is very thick consistency and hard to spread in your hand for a total cover of hair.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love it. I have very coarse hair, this product makes my hair easier to comb and shiny :)</li>
    <li> Carol&#x27;s Daughter is a miracle product for damaged hair.  It is advertised as a product for damaged hair, but keep reading because it&#x27;s great for all hair.  This is a terrific product if you want your hair to feel soft and shinny.  If you&#x27;ve damaged your hair with chemicals, heat and dye, this is a great moisturizer.  My daughter&#x27;s hair was damaged by perming but it&#x27;s great now thanks to this fabulous butter.  But, your hair will also benefit if it is healthy.  I have no real damage to my hair, but when I put this on my hair it is like silk.  I can definitely see improvement in the texture and manageability.  My stylist couldn&#x27;t believe the improvement.  When I showed up shortly after using it, he said &amp;#34;WHAT are you doing to your hair?  It&#x27;s FAABULOUSSS!&amp;#34;  Not easily impressed, I take that as high praise.  He told me not to tell the other clients, it would hurt his special treatment business:-)</li>
    <li> I thought CD Healthy Hair might do something different for my natural hair.  I haven&#x27;t noticed a difference yet.  My hair is very dry and hard to manage.  Then, I may have not used it long enough for it to make a difference.    The item came just as listed on the website.</li>
    <li> This is  the  best  hair oil for my ethnic curly  African  hair and  my daughter&#x27;s  straight  hair. It makes  my hair  very  very  soft and  a great  detangler too and  so easy  to  comb  and  it  has a wonderful aroma. I am  ordering  3 more  for  the  whole family.  I used  only  Organic Coconut  oil  for  my  ethnic  curly African  hair  and  this is the only  oil  that  I  now use and  my daughter  who  has straight  hair  just loves what  it does  to her hair. I  highly  recommend  this  hair butter and  I  would  like  to  try  more Carol&#x27;s Daughter&#x27;s  products.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know how they manage to make a product that is creamy in texture, but once applied is greasy and non moisturizing.  I&#x27;m so glad I got this for 50% off.  I am not sure what hair texture this product is made for.  I have course, natural African textured hair and it did nothing for me.  Also, the scent is overwhelming and lingers. This will definitely be a give away.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a white girl with medium-bodied curly hair (3B) and as a recent convert to the Curly Girl method, I was tasked to find natural products without silicones that held my problematic curls in July in Kentucky.  Yeah right.  I ordered the hair butter along with [[ASIN:B000PI3BS0 Carol&#x27;s Daughter Mimosa Hair Honey, 8 oz.]] and I just want to sing from the rooftops how pleased I am.  I used about a quarter-sized dollop, as well as a tiny bit of the hair honey, after wringing my hair out post-shower  and I let my hair air dry as normal.  Holy cow, my hair is awesome!!  It&#x27;s soft, shiny (neither of which happen often) and the curls are tighter and lighter than I&#x27;ve ever known.  This product is probably not best for those with fine or straight hair, and the scent is strong and could be off-putting to some (though I love earthy scents and I loved the smell of this).  Next time I&#x27;ll probably use a little less of both only because they&#x27;re a bit expensive for my college student budget.  You really don&#x27;t need much of this product at all--my hair is at my bra strap and is thick and full and I hardly had to use any.  Can&#x27;t wait until my [[ASIN:B00016X3KC Giovanni Hair Care - Styling L.A. Natural Gel, 8.5 fl oz gel]] arrives so I can have beautiful, natural curls on lock all summer long!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using CD&#x27;s Marguerite&#x27;s Magic for the past few months, now that I&#x27;m transitioning from relaxed hair to natural. Since then, I have nothing but great things to report. It smells fresh and pleasant and keeps my hair moisturized. I even use the excess from my hands and rub it on my legs. However, I wanted to try the Healthy Hair Butter - wow, equally smooth and creamy and instantly moisturized my hair.     However.... it smells like incense and is too overpowering to overlook. It smelled non-descript when I first opened up the jar, but after rubbing it in my hands and smoothing it on my hair, it took on a very strong, herbal odor.    I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d want to walk around smelling like sage mixed with Sulfur-8. I&#x27;ll continue to use in small amounts, but I may pass on re-purchasing in the future. I love CD&#x27;s all natural products since they are free from petroleum, mineral oil, sulfates and parabens... but they need to lighten up on the fragrances. I would be forgiving if it smelled like strawberries or pineapple.</li>
    <li> Let me describe my hair texture: 4a/4b African American (AA), semi fine but dense with tighter curls in the back of my head.  My hair normally is very dry, and naturally really nappy and hard to manage.  The Healthy Hair Butter (HHB) is a light, absorbant hair dress and not tacky to the touch. It goes on white on the hair and scalp so I really have to work it in but a little goes a long way. Using HHB my hair becomes soft, managable, and my curls are more defined.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hair does not respond well to most products (even those supposedly designed for AA hair) but my hair really LOVES some of Carol&#x27;s Daughters&#x27; products (but my sister&#x27;s hair responds differently to Carol&#x27;s Daughter&#x27;s who has coarser hair but her hair likes it too).  The HHB lasts even 2 days or so to keep my natural curls moisturized.  A little goes a long way.  Originally I was disappointed because it has corn oil in it but surprisingly this really works for me.  The curl milk (I prefer the Original) also works nice in my hair and does not have the heavy scents that some of the other CD products.  I even use Carol&#x27;s Daughter body butter in my hair and it works great (but it has a strong almost earthy/musky undertone)!  I think the HHB + the Black Vanilla leave in conditioner spray or any of the CD leave in sprays would be a great combination.  Spray first and then put the HHB to lock in the moisture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was using Shea Moisture hair line (Coconut Curly Smoothie, Moisturizing Spray) but my hair actually responds better to the Carol&#x27;s Daughter line (except for Shea Moisture&#x27;s shampoo it is EXCELLENT!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I suggest that you go to a local Macy&#x27;s Department Store to sample the products first.  Then make a decision.</li>
    <li> This must be an improved formula because it works better than when I first tried it a while back! My hair LOVES this stuff! I use it on my twists to seal and this is the best sealant ever. It makes my hair shiny, bouncy, and my twists stay in so much longer. I recommend this to everyone. :)</li>
    <li> This is the second time that I have bought this product, and I am again very satisfied. I love the earthy scent of the butter. It feels great on wet and on dry hair. It leaves your hair feeling really soft and moisturized. I also like to use it for styling. It&#x27;s not too heavy to leave my hair feeling really greasy, but it&#x27;s heavy enough to hold a style. I&#x27;m hooked!</li>
    <li> I went to my local Sephora store to check out Carol&#x27;s Daughter products for the 1st time. Some of the products had an OK smell but this was unbearable.  I put a little tip on the back of my hand to get the full affect of the scent &amp; after 3 hand washes the smell still lingers!  It might actually be a good hair product but the smell is a turn off.  I&#x27;m glad I had the opportunity to check the products out before purchasing online.</li>
    <li> I needed something to cure my dry itchy scalp.  I used to feel like I was losing my mind when my scalp itched. After seeing the comments about the smell and heaviness, I almost didn&#x27;t buy it. I&#x27;m glad I wasn&#x27;t deterred, because it does what I most needed it to do, cure my itchy scalp!</li>
    <li> Its rich and creamy and non greasy for keeping the scalp moist.</li>
    <li> Smells awful, too thick really horrible for those that are dandruff prone! Would not recommend for any hair type. awful</li>
    <li> The first time I used this butter I didn&#x27;t like it. However, I gave it another try &amp; used less. I like it a lot more. It has all the ingredients my 4a hair loves like: shea butter, sweet almond oil, &amp; jojoba oil. Not too fond of the smell though, it has a very earthy smell that just isn&#x27;t that appealing. Other than that, it&#x27;s a great product, just a little on the expensive side.</li>
    <li> Overpowering bark-y smell. Not a smell you want to linger but it does. Overall ok product. It did make my make hair feel moisturized but a little to thick for my liking &amp; along with the smell makes it a never-buy-again.</li>
    <li> It made my hair soft but no shine it is heavy on the hair i will continue to use when i am roller setting but thats about it and cost i think a bit much for the size will try to find it cheaper if its put there some where</li>
</ol>
