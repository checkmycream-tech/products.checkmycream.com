<li> Extremely dissatisfied.</li>
<li> After using this soap I am down to one.  </li>
<li> but without all the harsh chemicals.</li>
<li> I recently had to start taking hormone injections and the imbalance in my system when i first get one or its about time for one, causes me to have terrible breakouts all over my face and shoulders</li>
<li> It also doesn&#x27;t leave any residue on you or scum in the shower.  </li>
<li> package arrived with broken caps and soap was all over the place.</li>
<li> smells terrible, little to no lather, and extremely watery.</li>

    <li> Great my for daughter&#x27;s acne and her other skin issues with using bar soaps.  Thanks for the availability!</li>
    <li> This is the soap.  I love this stuff.  It smells *much* better than I expected.  I was afraid that it would smell too Eucalyptus/Green Tea Tree, but while still refreshing, it&#x27;s very pleasant smelling and light.  It also doesn&#x27;t leave any residue on you or scum in the shower.  I use this for both body wash and shampoo. I&#x27;m pretty amazed that the price is as low as it is.

    <li> In love after the first use. This shampoo works wonders on my type 4c locs. No residue left and hair was clean but not stripped. It has a nice tingle almost like a medicated shampoo but without all the harsh chemicals.</li>
    <li> This soap works very well in places with hard water and is gentle enough for all ages. Very good multi purpose soap.</li>
    <li> I recently had to start taking hormone injections and the imbalance in my system when i first get one or its about time for one, causes me to have terrible breakouts all over my face and shoulders like I&#x27;m a teenager and nothing was helping until i found this!! Its a great price for what it actually does!  Why spend $100on stuff that wont hepl as well?</li>
    <li> This is a fabulous yet gentle product which I have enjoyed using all over including shampooing my hair with it.</li>
    <li> Last longer than the bar version.  But didn&#x27;t really help with keeping my skin clear.</li>

    <li> Amazing product, smells great and last and last.. Great for the hair and whole body.</li>
    <li> Have only used this for a few days, but I really like it.  I have used it as shower gel, shampoo and face cleanser.  I like it.  It is soothing to the skin and not drying at all.</li>
    <li> Cleared my skin up almost immediately. Will buy again in the future.</li>
    <li> Before I found the Alaffia African Black Soap. I had no less than 3 different liquid soaps in my shower.  After using this soap I am down to one.  It is now the only soap I use in the shower.</li>
    <li> Smells herbal and leaves my skin hydrated and soft, worth the money.</li>
    <li> Nice smelling, but very very thin consistancy. Maybe it a just the one bottle. But I will get another one to see.</li>
