      <li>I liked it.</li>
      <li>They honestly both work well</li>

      <li>I love buying these replacement heads for my Clairisonic Mia.</li>
      <li>They are a great price here on Amazon and they are the real deal</li>
      <li>This acne brush head continues my love affair with Clarisonic products.  </li>
      <li>love these.</li>
      <li>would like to be able to tell if there is another choice that is softer.</li>
      <li>but I love my clarisonic now with this brush.</li>
      <li>I &#x27;LL BUY MORE WHEN ITS TIME.</li>
      <li>I was glad to find them on here because keeping up with the replacement heads can get costly.</li>
      <li>Serves the purpose but not as effective as the Original brush.</li>
      <li>works pretty good on cleaning bacteria from acne.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m satisfied and I&#x27;ll probably still purchase the acne prone head when I replenish, but I didn&#x27;t notice a huge difference or anything.</li>
      <li>I cannot say enough good things about these brush heads and the clarisonic!</li>
      <li>I have the 4 speed Pro Clarisonic &amp; these brushes fit and worked fine.</li>
      <li>but when I got it, it didn&#x27;t fit the prosonic brush I have as indicated.</li>
      <li>They fit and work well.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s genuine Clarisonic and fits on the Mia no problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Glad to have found them at such a good price.  </li>
      <li>It seemed like a good idea for me to try it out to see if it helped clear my acne.  </li>
      <li>This is such an amazing deal!</li>
      <li>They&#x27;re worth every penny!</li>
      <li>In stores, it would&#x27;ve cost me more than five times as much!</li>
      <li>But it went in full circle about two months ago</li>
      <li>The original brush head was for normal skin and it was wonderful, but this acne brush head is making a good impact on my enlarged pores without irritating my sensitive, aging skin.  </li>
      <li>My first time trying this particular brush, but I love my Clarisonic.  </li>
      <li>Definitely worth the investment.  </li>
      <li>Worth the money</li>
      <li>Fast and friendly.</li>
      <li>Thank you so very much.</li>
      <li>I love my clarisonic; it&#x27;s really helped my skin; I have strong chronic acne and need to exfoliate every day but all other means left my skin more irritated than anything else.</li>
      <li>Such a better deal then buying them elsewhere.</li>
      <li>It still requires a consistent regimen</li>
      <li>Love these brushes for the clarisonic&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will buy this again in the future and will recommend it to my friends.</li>
      <li>This was an economical purchase and arrived in a reasonable amount of time.</li>
      <li>the grooves on the side don&#x27;t look exactly like the grooves on the side of the brushhead that came with the handle.</li>
      <li>Much better than the regular brush head for my combination skin!</li>
      <li>it was first used in my first ever medical facial and i loved it.</li>
      <li>This company name is very efficient and i got my product very fast.</li>
      <li>Duped, so I bought a real one from the website I should have gone to in the first place...</li>
      <li>The I bought these super ultra soft brush heads and now my Clarisonic does everything it ever promised.  </li>
      <li>I received it fast</li>
      <li>The real deal.</li>
      <li>They are also gentle on the skin.</li>
      <li>It feels so gentle, yet cleans so thoroughly.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m happy to write to other prospective patrons reading this review, that I received only the original brand with the expected materials.</li>
      <li>The softer brush head does gives a deep pore clean feeling</li>
      <li>i just feel like it is still a bit too harsh for me when im having a very serious breakout but overall its a good brush and great for when my acne is healing and</li>
      <li>I prefer the deep cleaning and acne, face feels so clean and soft.</li>
      <li>but i own the brush heads for delicate skin.</li>
      <li>Once I switched to the Deep Pore Cleansing brushes, my complexion cleared right up again.</li>
      <li>this product is fairly new to the clarisonic line.</li>
      <li>I have adult acne prone skin and the Clarsonic Mia has really helped with my daily regimen.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve owned the sensitive head brush and now this one.  </li>
      <li>and I can say, while my acne is still present, it&#x27;s really helped</li>
      <li>and it really does seem to improve the overall texture of my skin.</li>
      <li>This brush is softer and finer than the sensitive head brush.</li>
      <li>so I figured I should be using this head rather than the sensitive one.</li>
      <li>I had purchased the clarisonic a while ago and was using the sensitive skin brush.</li>
      <li>Honestly, I can&#x27;t see a difference for the better...or worse.  </li>
      <li>It makes my face feel more raw than actual clarisonic brushes purchased at sephora.</li>
      <li>I used to use the regular heads, but this acne specific attachment really does improve acne prone skin.</li>
      <li>Generally I like the Clarisonic Mia and both brushes</li>
      <li>it&#x27;ll do ok the 4rth month and by he 5th u&#x27;ll see decreased results, so there&#x27;s a limit to improvement if you don&#x27;t keep up with it.</li>
      <li>Not sure if it&#x27;s worth spending the extra money on these brushes, when the results are no different/better then the cheaper, sensitive skin brushes.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Love the mia and the selection of brush heads is great.  I prefer the deep cleaning and acne, face feels so clean and soft.</li>
    <li> I liked it. It is a good price and works well. Buy it for yourself or give as a gift.</li>
    <li> Unlike the brush head that came with my Clarisonic MIA this replacement brush stays wet even after a day of letting it dry. And the worst part is that it harbors some type of smell. Perhaps it has something to do with the bristles. I won&#x27;t be ordering these again.</li>
    <li> I have the pro, and it works great on that also</li>
    <li> I have adult acne prone skin and the Clarsonic Mia has really helped with my daily regimen. I use my Clarsonic with a Salicylic/Glycolic/Lactic cleanser. I had only used the sensitive skin brush head that came with my Mia and was curious to see how the acne brush head compared. The acne brush head is softer and finer allowing a deeper cleansing. The softer brush head does gives a deep pore clean feeling and I&#x27;m very happy my purchase. I ordered with prime shipping so my order came quickly and the brush heads were in good condition, not tacky like another reviewer stated. If I get lazy and skip a cleansing with my Mia, I can definitely feel the difference. Beauty must have for those with acne prone skin.</li>
    <li> I got these for my Mia 2. They fit and work well. I don&#x27;t notice any difference between these and other brush heads (in terms of minimizing breakouts), but they give you a decent cleanse. I was glad to find them on here because keeping up with the replacement heads can get costly.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately I did not take other reviews seriously and still purchased these brush heads. I knew they were counterfeit  when I opened them, they are too hard to put on and off, the boxes are slightly smaller and read the box carefully, it says \\&quot;assembked\\&quot; instead of assembled!! Duped, so I bought a real one from the website I should have gone to in the first place...I&#x27;ve learned my lesson.</li>
    <li> I love these heads! Such a better deal then buying them elsewhere. I wish they still carried them! Fits my clarisonic perfectly!</li>
    <li> Received product in no time! Only been using the brush attachment for a few days but it seems to be working well. My face definitely feels and looks cleaner.</li>
    <li> This is such an amazing deal! I cannot say enough good things about these brush heads and the clarisonic! Worth the money</li>
    <li> The brushes themselves are good quality.  But I actually found that the acne brushes were clogging my pores.  Once I switched to the Deep Pore Cleansing brushes, my complexion cleared right up again.</li>
    <li> You definitely cannot go wrong with Clarisonic! They have brush heads for all skin type needs. They&#x27;re worth every penny!</li>
    <li> I have acne prone skin, and these brush heads work well for me. They exfoliate but don&#x27;t irritate my skin. I use this in the shower every other day.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product because I have acne prone skin so I figured I should be using this head rather than the sensitive one. The heads are very different dry but not so much when wet. I&#x27;m satisfied and I&#x27;ll probably still purchase the acne prone head when I replenish, but I didn&#x27;t notice a huge difference or anything.</li>
    <li> I have been having a really rough bought of severe cystic acne for the past half year and the original clarisonic brush i honestly feel like was making it worse and tearing my face apart. this brush head is longer and softer which i like but i dont like to use it too often because it does sometimes seam to aggravate my skin but its great for getting out my makeup and it really does seem to improve the overall texture of my skin. very smooth, etc. i just feel like it is still a bit too harsh for me when im having a very serious breakout but overall its a good brush and great for when my acne is healing and my skin isnt so irritated to begin with.</li>
    <li> Purchased for my daughters Clarisonic Mia Acne skin care treatment. These were replacement brushes, which she replaces every 3-4 months</li>
    <li> I love buying these replacement heads for my Clairisonic Mia. They are a great price here on Amazon and they are the real deal so they work great.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s genuine Clarisonic and fits on the Mia no problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend it if you&#x27;re trying to save a little money!</li>
    <li> I have been using my Clarisonic Mia 2 for awhile now and it definitely improves the appearance of my skin. I was able to find these brush heads at an incredible price on Amazon. I&#x27;m going to continue to but from here only. In stores, it would&#x27;ve cost me more than five times as much!</li>
    <li> I was not about to pay a lot of money for something that I got a good price for here. They work the same and actually last longer. I need to stock up on these.</li>
    <li> this product is fairly new to the clarisonic line. it was first used in my first ever medical facial and i loved it. i already owned a clarisonic mia but i own the brush heads for delicate skin. my medical esthetician told me something about how the green bristles help loosen oils and dirt from your face. these brush heads are just a tiny bit stiffer compared to the delicate brush heads by clarisonic. i love it. my only thing about this was that it was shipped to me a little tacky. it was wrapped in bubble wrap and taken out of the clarisonic box; otherwise, the products work as described and it didn&#x27;t show any damage upon arrival.</li>
    <li> First of all, seller is awesome. The transaction was quick and processed on the same day.&lt;br /&gt;These acne brush heads are surprisingly soft and deeply cleanses without irritating my skin.&lt;br /&gt;I use the brush just once a day, but even when used twice, I had no issues with sensitivity or dryness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love Clarisonic! :)</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t know what i ever did without this! Brush heads are what you would expect. I was happy to get two at once since they should be replaced every 3-4 months.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve owned the sensitive head brush and now this one.  They honestly both work well and I don&#x27;t see a big difference in my skin using one over the other.  Generally I like the Clarisonic Mia and both brushes seem to work well with a long life.  This brush is softer and finer than the sensitive head brush.</li>
    <li> WORK GREAT. I WOULD RECOMMENDED IT TO EVERYONE. WHY BUY IN-STORE WHEN WE CAN HAVE IT SHIP TO OUR PLACE AT A LOWER COST. I &#x27;LL BUY MORE WHEN ITS TIME.</li>
    <li> The estimated arrival time says I should be getting it in 2 days. THey have yet to ship my product. It&#x27;s been well over 10 days. I am now annoyed with the service.</li>
    <li> This was an economical purchase and arrived in a reasonable amount of time. My son and I do not have to struggle over one brush. I try to buy bulk enough to save money rather then buy one brush alone. I have the 4 speed Pro Clarisonic &amp; these brushes fit and worked fine. I hope that Amazon will keep around bulk package opportunities as this one.</li>
    <li> I have been using for about 4 months and my skin has greatly improved! I would recommend to to any one!</li>
    <li> The real deal. Fast and friendly. I will continue to purchase products from this retailer. At times, I worry about making a purchase online, site unseen. I don&#x27;t want to open my box, only to find a knockoff or an inferior product. I&#x27;m happy to write to other prospective patrons reading this review, that I received only the original brand with the expected materials. Only the best at the best price. Thank you so very much. Best.</li>
    <li> Love these brushes for the clarisonic&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will buy this again in the future and will recommend it to my friends.</li>
    <li> This company name is very efficient and i got my product very fast. I am also happy with my product and i will be happy to do business with them in the future</li>
    <li> This acne brush head continues my love affair with Clarisonic products.  The original brush head was for normal skin and it was wonderful, but this acne brush head is making a good impact on my enlarged pores without irritating my sensitive, aging skin.  From other comments, I have learned that I might use the normal brush head on the neck area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product improves my skin texture more than any skin product I have ever used.</li>
    <li> I loved the Clarisonic Plus Pro Mia Acne brushes. Have used about 3 weeks. Face feels cleaner and looks cleaner. Would recommend to others.</li>
    <li> Brushes are awesome! Glad to have found them at such a good price.  My first time trying this particular brush, but I love my Clarisonic.  Best purchase I have made for my face.</li>
    <li> Good brushes, good price. We don&#x27;t use them every day but they have lasted a long time. They are also gentle on the skin.</li>
    <li> love these. gentle on sensitive skin without scrubbing your face raw. great value for the price</li>
    <li> Serves the purpose but not as effective as the Original brush. Its deceiving because its not the Clarisonic brush from the company and it didnt even come in a Clarisonic box.</li>
    <li> I had purchased the clarisonic a while ago and was using the sensitive skin brush. My skin went crazy and broke out worse than ever and burned when I washed it. I was using the clarisonic twice a day. I stopped all together then went back to once per day. I changed to this brush and I have not had and worsening of my breakouts and have had good results with keeping them at bay. It still requires a consistent regimen but I love my clarisonic now with this brush. There is a definite difference between this brush and the regular sensitive skin brush</li>
    <li> These brush heads work for their designed purpose, but they are definitely made of lesser materials. It makes my face feel more raw than actual clarisonic brushes purchased at sephora.</li>
    <li> Definitely worth the investment.  After YEARS of poor skin, I finally found something that actually works.  The other brushes did not work as well as the acne brush head.</li>
    <li> I purchased a Mia 2 back in July.  I used the brush that came with it.  For the first few weeks, my skin cleared up.  It was amazing.  But it went in full circle about two months ago and my skin got bad again.  Knowing I&#x27;d have to replace my brush at the three month mark, I read reviews about this brush.  It seemed like a good idea for me to try it out to see if it helped clear my acne.  Honestly, I can&#x27;t see a difference for the better...or worse.  I&#x27;ve been using this brush for almost a month.  I gave it three stars because it is just medicore.  Not sure if it&#x27;s worth spending the extra money on these brushes, when the results are no different/better then the cheaper, sensitive skin brushes.</li>
    <li> I am not going to give less than 5 stars because you can&#x27;t beat the price. And, if you haven&#x27;t used Clarisonic, you should. One of the best splurges that I have made. The seller poorly packaged this product. Two heads thrown in an envelope with no sanitary packaging. These brush heads should be sealed!</li>
    <li> I received it fast but when I got it, it didn&#x27;t fit the prosonic brush I have as indicated. I requested to send it back but by the time I got the email, it was too late by the return policy.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been experiencing a bad case of Adult Acne lately, which came as a major shock considering I had very little to no acne as a teenager! The original head didn&#x27;t work so great for my skin and I almost gave up...but decided to go with the \\&quot;Acne\\&quot; head and I can say, while my acne is still present, it&#x27;s really helped a lot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here is one thing though, that I did notice about the specific product that was shipped to me....shipped with just the heads...not a deal breaker....also had a hard time slipping it on and half the handle itself...the grooves on the side don&#x27;t look exactly like the grooves on the side of the brushhead that came with the handle. It makes me a tad suspicious...but it still worked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not a deal breaker, but made me slightly weary. So heads up.</li>
    <li> They do the job.&lt;br /&gt;They are still a bit too abrasive for me.  :(&lt;br /&gt;They are the softest option so I will continue to buy them.&lt;br /&gt;Clarisonic, please come out with something even softer!</li>
    <li> it has been hard to discern which clarisonic brush heads are the softest. i like these fine&lt;br /&gt;but would like to be able to tell if there is another choice that is softer. hard to tell in the&lt;br /&gt;different write ups. even when i looked elsewhere to find the info. i always order from amazon.</li>
    <li> I love my clarisonic; it&#x27;s really helped my skin; I have strong chronic acne and need to exfoliate every day but all other means left my skin more irritated than anything else. I used to use the regular heads, but this acne specific attachment really does improve acne prone skin. The head should be changes as often as they recommend (3 months) it&#x27;ll do ok the 4rth month and by he 5th u&#x27;ll see decreased results, so there&#x27;s a limit to improvement if you don&#x27;t keep up with it.</li>
    <li> I had been using Clarisonic for a year and found that it made me break out.  It was very disappointing after all the rave reviews.  The I bought these super ultra soft brush heads and now my Clarisonic does everything it ever promised.  These heads coupled with a steady beauty routine - my skin is looking wonderful!</li>
    <li> great deal!  works pretty good on cleaning bacteria from acne.</li>
    <li> Much better than the regular brush head for my combination skin! It feels so gentle, yet cleans so thoroughly. Really love it!</li>
