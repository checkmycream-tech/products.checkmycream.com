      <li>Smelled mostly like alcohol, must have been old.</li>
      <li>I bought this perfume because it had similar notes to  Est&amp;eacute;e Lauder&#x27;s White Linen, which is what my mother has been wearing since I could remember, but it also has a nice fresh, citrus like quality to it, which I really liked.</li>
      <li>this parfume  its hands down the best , i get a lot of compliments , it stays on all day , my clothes smell even the next day !!</li>

      <li>you so much!</li>

      <li>This scent is pure heaven, spray it on, and you are enveloped with sweetness and lightness and you feel like an angel..</li>
      <li>This is now my mothers main scent, she loves it!</li>

      <li>Once it was gone the fragance smelled pretty much the same.</li>
      <li>mild but yet long lasting , mainly for evening occasion.</li>

    <li> I originally bought this in stores as a gift for my mother (she is in her late 40&#x27;s). I was a little wary buying her a new perfume because smells are different for everyone and not everyone likes the same thing. I bought this perfume because it had similar notes to  Est&amp;eacute;e Lauder&#x27;s White Linen, which is what my mother has been wearing since I could remember, but it also has a nice fresh, citrus like quality to it, which I really liked. This is now my mothers main scent, she loves it! She tells me people are always complimenting her and asking her what she is wearing. When I went to visit recently I noticed she was wearing it and I&#x27;m seriously considering adding it to my collection. If you like Chance by Channel, or Est&amp;eacute;e Lauder White Linen, I think you will enjoy this perfume also.</li>
    <li> Did not smell at all like it smelled in stores. Smelled mostly like alcohol, must have been old. Gave it away.</li>

    <li> Bought this for my mother so she could try something different.  She didn&#x27;t like it as well as the yellow versace.</li>
    <li> I had tried a sample of this and absolutely LOVE! It&#x27;s very clean yet noticable and stays on well. good price too</li>
    <li> The perfume is good. We also got lots of other discount items with the perfume. Reducing 1/2 star for delivery confusions.</li>

    <li> My favorite perfume! I found it four or three years ago in a store and I am so happy Amazon has it!

I always get compliments about it even from strangers!&lt;br /&gt;I can highly recommend this perfume and the seller.&lt;br /&gt;Perfume came on time, carefully packed. I got a few sample gifts as well with a thank you card which was super kind from the seller.&lt;br /&gt;Thank you so much!</li>

    <li> My boyfriend brought me this perfume a over a year ago and I wanted it again. He searched and said the stores stop selling it. I was disappointed and then decided to search Amazon cause they carry it all. I found it but it was the eau de toilette so I was spectacle in purchasing it. I went for it and I love my eau de toilette. Not only does it smell just like the perfume I once owned but the smell lasted long. Still smelled on my clothes the net day and that&#x27;s refreshing. A great purchase.</li>

It&#x27;s has a beautiful floral scent and would be great for spring and summer</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this fragrance. Best for night wear. Very chic.</li>
