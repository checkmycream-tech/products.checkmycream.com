      <li>Beautifully designed product.  </li>
      <li>these scissors are great.</li>
      <li>Amazon was great.</li>
      <li>great buy.</li>

      <li>The scissors are great quality and work well.</li>
      <li>Well-built, great scissors.  </li>
      <li>Very nice grooming scissors.  </li>
      <li>They just didn&#x27;t cut close, so they weren&#x27;t very effective for trimming nose hair.</li>
      <li>I successfully began using these scissors as soon as I got them out of the box.  </li>
      <li>Excellent and easy to use.  </li>
      <li>the Seki blade tips are quite a bit thicker than the Rubis blade tips, which means that you can&#x27;t get as close to your skin with the Sekis, which in turn means that your hair won&#x27;t be clipped as closely as with the Rubis; again, the Seki does a good job with this, just not as good as the Rubis. 4)</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s safety features are good ones and I&#x27;ve never cut myself or pulled a nose hair.</li>
      <li>good for anus hairs and nose hairs.</li>
      <li>but it is good.</li>
      <li>A precise instrument, great rounded edges for safety/comfort, and precision engineered like a great swiss watch.</li>
      <li>Nice sized finger holes for men&#x27;s hand.</li>
      <li>Excellent, VERY well machined product.  </li>
      <li>Quality product, great steel, clean cut, has the safety tip.  </li>
      <li>THIS IS A VERY GOOD PRODUCT THAT I CAN RECOMMEND HIGHLY.</li>
      <li>SO much easier to use, does a great job</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad I was able to find a replacement</li>
      <li>So, I bought these scissors based on many favorable reviews.</li>
      <li>They have a matte finish that looks stain resistant, but I wouldn&#x27;t expect to get many stains out of my nose...  </li>
      <li>Glad</li>
      <li>The scissors looked great and felt of high quality.</li>
      <li>With this, the blunted edges let me know I&#x27;m safe and with a quick press of my fingers, presto, nicely groomed eyelashes and eyebrows.    </li>
      <li>Really really nice and super well made.</li>
      <li>If you want a good to very good pair of scissors for less money, the Seki will do just fine.</li>
      <li>So, while these scissors will cut the thickest and the most fine of hairs, my drug-store cheap scissors trimmed the hair nearer to the skin.  </li>
      <li>These are the best quality and sharp.</li>
      <li>After reading other reviews I decided to invest in a pair of Rubis and have been very happy with the results.</li>
      <li>They work perfectly and are extremely well made.  </li>
      <li>easily.  </li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s as good today as when it was new.</li>
      <li>They worked fine,</li>
      <li>They fell apart before even using the cheaply made plastic contraptions.  </li>
      <li>Now, I too am a fan and while I hope not to have to call on them constantly, want them to do a great job when I do.</li>
      <li>Cheap, drug store,</li>
      <li>I had a pair for over 10 years and they were great, but got left in a hotel room.  </li>
      <li>The finger holes are large making use very easy.</li>
      <li>Looks odd, looks cheap but it really is a great scissor for trimming unwanted hairs safely.  </li>
      <li>They trim close and accurately and are well worth the investment.</li>
      <li>there is no such thing as a good electric trimmer.  </li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t make this review sound pretty.</li>
      <li>Great quality and very sharp.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve have mine a few years and they haven&#x27;t rusted/degraded and still cut great.</li>
      <li>They are worth the cost.</li>
      <li>They are worth every penny.  </li>
      <li>These scissors are worth it.</li>
      <li>It truly is a first rate pair of scissors that is worth the money.  </li>
      <li>The Rubis does seem to be made of thicker and possibly higher quality steel, but it seems to be stubbier and shorter.</li>
      <li>Believe me, stainless steel scissors are the way to go in trimming men&#x27;s nose and ear hairs!</li>
      <li>Pretty though though.</li>
      <li>Stellar Rubis quality, but the tip is not curved</li>
      <li>useful gift for all my life because I am getting older and nose hair is</li>
      <li>/&gt;Other brands were slightly more expensive, and these both got reasonably good reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The tips are not 1/8 inch thick but are about perfect, I would guess slightly more than a 1/16&amp;#34; thick.  </li>
      <li>The safety-rounded ends are not too large, and you can trim nose hair, etc.</li>
      <li>These scissors are very high quality, and I don&#x27;t forsee ever needing to buy another pair.  </li>
      <li>These scissors are exactly what you would expect from a high end manufacturer.  </li>
      <li>I had tried using regular scissors but imagine having huge blades coming at your eyes.  </li>
      <li>Obviously there is a huge flaw in the construction of these.</li>
      <li>I probably spent more than this amount over the years buying cheapies that ended up in the trash.</li>
      <li>After reading the reviews, I bought the Rubis Stainless and the Tweezerman Stainless, based on price, thinking I&#x27;d return one.  </li>
      <li>Grip is comfortable, even with big hands.  </li>
      <li>Next time I will buy Twezzerman or cheap chinesse scissors.</li>
      <li>/&gt;The Rubis is shorter and thicker, but cuts well and seems very well made.  </li>
      <li>; the shape of the rounded tips make it ineffective for really close trimming.</li>
      <li>Sigh, now I can fortunately rejoin the human race.</li>
      <li>This trimmer is extremely well made, moves very smoothly, and works well for lefties (me) and right-handed folk (husband).</li>
      <li>A little timid at first, I eventually got very comfortable knowing that I wasn&#x27;t going to nick myself with these.  </li>
      <li>He is left handed and is not as happy with it for trimming his nose because he thinks they are too small for his hands.</li>
      <li>Highly recommended.</li>
      <li>The thicker blades do require a little more thought to get a closer trim in my nostril, but I manage ok.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>They are easy to use, and the package they come in serves as a holding case, to keep them away from crowding in with other implements.</li>
      <li>are a bit too small, especially for my thumb; the Rubis has much larger &amp; more comfortable finger openings; if the openings in the Seki are too small for you, you can take out the rubber inserts, which is what I did, &amp; they fit fine now.</li>
      <li>Compared to the one I bought at Watsons in Shanghai which does not cut the nose hair completely, This Rubis Scissors cuts the nose hair very well without pulling and tugging the hair.</li>
      <li>The one thing I really miss is the old soft plastic case, which was essentially just large enough to hold the scissors and let it easily slide into my \\&quot;dop</li>
      <li>It is hard to find enough time to practice with these to get really good, since they cut away the nose hairs so well, they are all gone, and at that point you just have to stop, because, man, they&#x27;re gone.</li>
      <li>However, someone with fine, metro, personal grooming should get something cheaper with a flat tip.  </li>
      <li>They were delivered promptly and were exactly as advertised - my only gripe is the packaging and thus my reason for 4 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>My use has been limited to date, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to be quite as easy to use as my former one.</li>
      <li>I initially worried that the Rubis Stainless Steel Ear +</li>
      <li>My old nose hair scissors died after 27 years of faithful service.  </li>
      <li>One of the &amp;#34;joys&amp;#34; of growing old is nasal hair.  </li>
      <li>[...] I contact Rubis directly because Amazon return&#x27;s date was over and they to suggest me to  contact directly the seller that sold you the item.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its</li>
      <li>Amazon does not provide a close-up image of the blade tips, which are more than 1/8 inch thick.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> My husband is thrilled that this simple mechanical product works so well - no more battery trimmers for him!</li>
    <li> Stellar Rubis quality, but the tip is not curved; the shape of the rounded tips make it ineffective for really close trimming.</li>
    <li> These scissors are very high quality, and I don&#x27;t forsee ever needing to buy another pair.  They are worth every penny.  They are easy to use, and the package they come in serves as a holding case, to keep them away from crowding in with other implements.</li>
    <li> My poor husband had been using regular scissors for years.  Once I saw these I bought them for him as a surprise. NOW I&#x27;m so mad I didn&#x27;t get these years ago.  SO much easier to use, does a great job and we don&#x27;t have to worry about sticking ourselves with pointed schears.</li>
    <li> Excellent and easy to use.  I had a pair for over 10 years and they were great, but got left in a hotel room.  I&#x27;m glad I was able to find a replacement</li>
    <li> Very nice grooming scissors.  The tips are such that you will have a difficult time trying to &amp;#34;cut yourself.&amp;#34;  A little timid at first, I eventually got very comfortable knowing that I wasn&#x27;t going to nick myself with these.  Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> great buy. i also cut my nieces bangs these scissors because it has no  pointy edges to hurt her as she is squirming.</li>
    <li> I am disappointed with these scissors.  They don&#x27;t take care of the little hairs.  I&#x27;ve gone back to a good little pair of scissors with sharply pointed ends.  I sometimes poke myself, but I cut the hairs I want to cut.</li>
    <li> My old nose hair scissors died after 27 years of faithful service.  I decided on Rubis because of it&#x27;s claim of quality.  It truly is a first rate pair of scissors that is worth the money.  These should last at least 30 years.</li>
    <li> I use an old German-made Solingen scissors I&#x27;ve had for 30 years and wanted a second set for travel.  After reading the reviews, I bought the Rubis Stainless and the Tweezerman Stainless, based on price, thinking I&#x27;d return one.  I kept both, for different reasons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other brands were slightly more expensive, and these both got reasonably good reviews.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Rubis is shorter and thicker, but cuts well and seems very well made.  I kept them for travel, and I expect they&#x27;ll get through the TSA with no fuss due to the short blades.  They have a matte finish that looks stain resistant, but I wouldn&#x27;t expect to get many stains out of my nose...  The thicker blades do require a little more thought to get a closer trim in my nostril, but I manage ok.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Tweezerman has longer, thinner blades.  It also seems well made and cuts well.  It also has a matte finish which seems stain resistant.  The finish is darker than the Rubis, as shown in the image.  I kept this pair to leave in a summer home and as an eventual replacement for my old German ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I expect both of them might rust if stored wet, but I have had no issues with either pair.</li>
    <li> The best nose and hair scissors that I have found.</li>
    <li> I tried all sorts of nose hair trimmers before purchasing these.  I&#x27;ve had 4 different electric trimmers which, I am now convinced, are all a waste of money.  there is no such thing as a good electric trimmer.  I also tried the Groom Mate Platinum cylindrical manual trimmer, which did trim hairs, but not at all closely.  Groom Mate left nearly 1/4\\&quot; of each hair, if it trimmed, at all.  Cheap, drug store, blunt tipped scissors out-performed all of the above.  Rubis boasts a surgical craftsmanship far beyond any other nose scissors or trimmer that I have found.  The big problem with the Rubis scissors is how thick they are.  Amazon does not provide a close-up image of the blade tips, which are more than 1/8 inch thick.  So, while these scissors will cut the thickest and the most fine of hairs, my drug-store cheap scissors trimmed the hair nearer to the skin.  The cheap drug store versions loosened up to uselessness within a few weeks, but they had flat blades and didn&#x27;t cost thirty dollars.  I&#x27;m still looking for the perfect scissors.  I recommend the Rubis scissors only to people with thick old-man hair growing like a bush from the nose and ears.  It should be perfect for that.  Trim your bushy eyebrows with it.  However, someone with fine, metro, personal grooming should get something cheaper with a flat tip.  Amazon was great.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried those clippers you can buy in drug stores.  They fell apart before even using the cheaply made plastic contraptions.  Believe me, stainless steel scissors are the way to go in trimming men&#x27;s nose and ear hairs!</li>
    <li> I initially worried that the Rubis Stainless Steel Ear + Nose Hair Scissors might require a bit of training.  This concern turned out to be totally unjustified.  I successfully began using these scissors as soon as I got them out of the box.  Common sense was all that was required.  Nobody had to assist me. They appear sturdy and should easily last a lifetime. Sigh, now I can fortunately rejoin the human race.</li>
    <li> The scissors looked great and felt of high quality. They just didn&#x27;t cut close, so they weren&#x27;t very effective for trimming nose hair. I did return the item.</li>
    <li> First, let me state that I have arbitrarily rated this item with 3 stars because I was forced to make a star rating in order to complete the review. My personal opinion is somewhat mixed possibly because of an unavoidable bias. I purchased this item to replace one I had lost after about 25 years. The two differ somewhat. The Rubis does seem to be made of thicker and possibly higher quality steel, but it seems to be stubbier and shorter. My use has been limited to date, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to be quite as easy to use as my former one. However, it is serviceable. The one thing I really miss is the old soft plastic case, which was essentially just large enough to hold the scissors and let it easily slide into my \\&quot;dop bag\\&quot; or a crevice anywhere in my suitcase. The large hard plastic container is excessive and inconvenient.</li>
    <li> Never use this set of scissors as the rounded edges make it disfunctional for trimming those nasty nose hairs. ( sorry)</li>
    <li> These are the best scissors on the market for this job (nose/ear hair trimming). I bought a pair of Seki Edge scissors as a back-up pair to the Rubis. The differences are: 1) the Rubis blades are sharper; the Seki blades are fairly sharp, just not as sharp. 2) I have medium sized fingers, but the finger holes for the Seki are a bit too small, especially for my thumb; the Rubis has much larger &amp; more comfortable finger openings; if the openings in the Seki are too small for you, you can take out the rubber inserts, which is what I did, &amp; they fit fine now. 3) the Seki blade tips are quite a bit thicker than the Rubis blade tips, which means that you can&#x27;t get as close to your skin with the Sekis, which in turn means that your hair won&#x27;t be clipped as closely as with the Rubis; again, the Seki does a good job with this, just not as good as the Rubis. 4) although the Rubis scissors are a little smaller in width &amp; length, they are actually 16% heavier, indicating a more solid steel construction. If you want the best scissors &amp; can afford them, try the Rubis. If you want a good to very good pair of scissors for less money, the Seki will do just fine.</li>
    <li> Works well, the nose knows.  George</li>
    <li> Beats using my old style scissors that were clumsy. The Rubis is sharp, sturdy, and works well esp. with nose hairs.</li>
    <li> This is a quality scissor. Expensive but it is good. Short of pouring hair remover into your ear this scissor does a decent and safer job to cut ear hair.</li>
    <li> I use this product to trim my eyelashes and eyebrows, and it works great. I had tried using regular scissors but imagine having huge blades coming at your eyes.  With this, the blunted edges let me know I&#x27;m safe and with a quick press of my fingers, presto, nicely groomed eyelashes and eyebrows.    Glad I bought these!</li>
    <li> In the past I have purchased several inexpensive scissors which have given unsatisfactory results. After reading other reviews I decided to invest in a pair of Rubis and have been very happy with the results. They trim close and accurately and are well worth the investment. I probably spent more than this amount over the years buying cheapies that ended up in the trash. I use this product to trim the hair in my husband&#x27;s ears. He is left handed and is not as happy with it for trimming his nose because he thinks they are too small for his hands.</li>
    <li> I cut the inside of my nose several times using this product, I&#x27;m still looking for a product that can produce the results I&#x27;m trying to achieve. This product comes up short to say the least.</li>
    <li> Boy do I look forward to cutting my nose hairs now.  It is hard to find enough time to practice with these to get really good, since they cut away the nose hairs so well, they are all gone, and at that point you just have to stop, because, man, they&#x27;re gone.</li>
    <li> For the age with wisdom, the blunt tip is wonderful.  No concerns on hurting yourself.  Performance of cutting is percise.&lt;br /&gt;Truly recommend.</li>
    <li> I will not need another scissors for grooming, unless I loose it. Great quality and very sharp. It may seem expensive, but you have to hold it in your hand and use it only once to know why.</li>
    <li> As I age, hair seems to grow in some weird places and I was looking for a no-batteries solution to combat those wayward groves. So, I bought these scissors based on many favorable reviews. Now, I too am a fan and while I hope not to have to call on them constantly, want them to do a great job when I do. They were delivered promptly and were exactly as advertised - my only gripe is the packaging and thus my reason for 4 stars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I buy products based at least partially where they are made, how they are made and how they are packaged, since I want to leave a livable world for our children. Correct me if I am wrong but the plastic display pack these scissors were delivered in is probably not recyclable, and reminds me of &#x27;60s packaging when waste was a word reserved for the toilet. In my opinion, a recyclable paper envelope, while not as bulletproof was suffice just as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;R.R.

    <li> Quality product, great steel, clean cut, has the safety tip.  Nice sized finger holes for men&#x27;s hand.</li>
    <li> The scissors are great quality and work well. But not worth what I had to go through to get them. After ordering, they don&#x27;t arrive. Vendor resends them Certified Mail. I had to go to the post office twice to sign for the package. Stand in line 20+ minutes both times, not to mention the traffic mess I ran into on the way home the second time. I would never have bought them had I known they would be sent certified. That takes all the convenience out of buying online.</li>
    <li> Some of the other reviewers are morons.  The tips are not 1/8 inch thick but are about perfect, I would guess slightly more than a 1/16&amp;#34; thick.  Grip is comfortable, even with big hands.  These scissors are exactly what you would expect from a high end manufacturer.  Great Quality!!!!!  Very Happy with my purchase!!!!!</li>
    <li> good for anus hairs and nose hairs.</li>
    <li> Finger holes have an opening that pinch my skin.</li>
    <li> Cuts my nose hair like a champ. I like that I can&#x27;t stab myself with these. You CAN however cut the heck out of yourself if you&#x27;re being stupid and get skin caught there in the blades. Pretty though though. Quality Swiss made nose weed choppers.</li>
    <li> I bought myself a Rubis Duck as 30th birthday&#x27;s gift. \\&quot;A useful gift for all my life because I am getting older and nose hair is appear\\&quot; that&#x27;s what I think but the gift only works for 3 months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use it every 15 -20 days... in September 13th when I open the case the scissor was broken. I didn&#x27;t know why because I only use it for nose hair and save in the case after use. [...] I contact Rubis directly because Amazon return&#x27;s date was over and they to suggest me to  contact directly the seller that sold you the item.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Its really disappointing that a expesive Swiss branded product broke itself like this. Next time I will buy Twezzerman or cheap chinesse scissors.</li>
    <li> It does what it is supposed to do, and with the rounded tips, doesn&#x27;t cause any harm.  It has a feel of quality.</li>
    <li> Decided to splurge and get these. They worked fine, I mean they are just facial hair scissors, so no huge difference from anything else. However, one day one of the two pieces just broke in half. Makes no sense, but that&#x27;s what happened. Obviously there is a huge flaw in the construction of these.</li>
    <li> Not a great design.  Don&#x27;t be fooled by the European pedigree.  Overpriced.</li>
    <li> these scissors are great. The finger holes are large making use very easy. The also cut extremely well no tugging or pulling. They are worth the cost.</li>
    <li> Compared to the one I bought at Watsons in Shanghai which does not cut the nose hair completely, This Rubis Scissors cuts the nose hair very well without pulling and tugging the hair. So no more tearing of the eyes for me. I&#x27;m impressed!</li>
    <li> Well-built, great scissors.  The safety-rounded ends are not too large, and you can trim nose hair, etc. easily.  Precision cut.</li>
    <li> No better than a cheap nose hair scissors that can be purchased at a retail drug store for a third of the price. Very disappointing, I would never buy another Rubis product.</li>
    <li> I am always worried when I have to trim around my dogs ears and eyes. These are the best quality and sharp. The blunted tip is perfect for this use. Excellent shipping and packaging.</li>
    <li> Way to sharp for nose use</li>
    <li> Good product to do a horrible job.  One of the &amp;#34;joys&amp;#34; of growing old is nasal hair.  These scissors are worth it.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t make this review sound pretty. This thing cuts your nose hairs great without nicking the inside of your nostril. Price kinda sucks. I&#x27;ve have mine a few years and they haven&#x27;t rusted/degraded and still cut great.</li>
    <li> These are pricey but you get what you pay for. Really really nice and super well made. You won&#x27;t be disappointed.</li>
    <li> They work perfectly and are extremely well made.  The quality is obvious.  I expect these will last a few lifetimes.</li>
    <li> Beautifully designed product.  Works well too.&lt;br /&gt;I have other products from Rubis and I think the quality is very good</li>
    <li> Excellent, VERY well machined product.  A precise instrument, great rounded edges for safety/comfort, and precision engineered like a great swiss watch.</li>
    <li> Fed up with replacing batteries in my electric nose hair trimmer, and finding it&#x27;s blades dull and hurtful to use, I decided to research &#x27;no-battery&#x27; nose hair trimmers. This trimmer is extremely well made, moves very smoothly, and works well for lefties (me) and right-handed folk (husband). It&#x27;s safety features are good ones and I&#x27;ve never cut myself or pulled a nose hair. Have owned this for 2 years and it&#x27;s as good today as when it was new. After use I wash it with soap &amp; water then rub with alcohol. THIS IS A VERY GOOD PRODUCT THAT I CAN RECOMMEND HIGHLY.</li>
    <li> Looks odd, looks cheap but it really is a great scissor for trimming unwanted hairs safely.  Look like it will hold up for the long haul.</li>
