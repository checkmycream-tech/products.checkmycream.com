<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I like this product.  It does what I bought it to do.  The brush spins unlike some that just vibrate.  I would recommend this to others!</li>
    <li> This product is made of all plastic, but it does work well. The additional tools it comes with do stay on without any trouble, though I don&#x27;t expect this product to last an extensive period of time.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my wife who&#x27;s an esthetician, the quality is really bad.. is not rechargeable, and the heads are flimsy, I will be returning this.</li>
    <li> I really expected a better functioning item, the whole tip comes off during use and the pad came apart, not loving it.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t know what to expect with the brush set and I found that it washed my face much better than I expected.  Putting on the moisture creams also was great because it rubbed it into my skin much easier than I could do with my fingers. I tend to be more speedy with my fingers where this allows the cream to be rubbed gently into my skin.</li>
    <li> Great and awesome price!!</li>
    <li> Best one ever and stays for long time... I&#x27;m using it for 7 years now and still very good and definitely recommend it.</li>
    <li> bristles are very soft.</li>
    <li> i order this product for my wife and she is happy with it not the best one, but for the price it is just fine</li>
    <li> Awesome tool and works just as good as a $100 facial cleansing brush such as a Mia sonic or proactive</li>
    <li> Gave as a gift said it was too weak and built poorly</li>
    <li> Great product for a great price.</li>
    <li> I originally hated this after the first use. I found it to be a little uncomfortable and not as great as I had hoped. I used it with the Cetaphil facial cleanser and didn&#x27;t really like it. But now I have switched cleansers (I use the Clinique 3 step system now) and I love it. I think it feels better with the Clinique facial soap vs the Cetaphil because the Clinique lathers up more. I love the fact that it comes with a little case, which is honestly what sold me on this product to begin with, I needed a case for travel. One of my main concerns though would be buying new brush heads. I haven&#x27;t seen any here on amazon so I&#x27;m not too sure what I would do after using this one for about 3 months. I&#x27;ll more than likely end up purchasing the clarisonic I just wanted to try a cheaper alternative first.</li>
    <li> love it i use it every night since i got it a mth ago . no problems ,perfect size for traveling as well</li>
    <li> It works well. My daughter uses it everyday.It works as it was advertised, so I am pleased with this product.</li>
    <li> Love  this, I been using this daily for a little over a week  my face looks and feels clean, my face is brighter also my acne scars are fading, not a huge change but looking better, will try to keep u updated</li>
    <li> She loves it.  Its not heavy duty and will stop spinning if pressed too hard.  But it certainly suits her needs and the price was reasonable.  I would buy it again for someone her age.</li>
    <li> The only reason this product isn&#x27;t getting 5 stars is merely because it&#x27;s not waterproof.  If you want to exfoliate while in the shower, this is not the product you want.  It is battery operated and doesn&#x27;t have a waterproof seal.</li>
    <li> Bought it for a stocking stuffer and she used it today and said she loves it. Claims her face feels smoother after first use. Quick shipping.</li>
    <li> Although this brush works and does what is intended, don&#x27;t expect the same quality as similar, more expensive products. I have oily, large pores and acne prone skin and bought this product for exfoliation. It isn&#x27;t a miracle worker, but it works and does make my skin feel softer after with no irritation or break outs. I haven&#x27;t noticed a change in my pores yet, but overall a satisfactory buy.</li>
    <li> Ive found what i wanted.it really works to reduce breakouts on my face and give it a shiny look :)</li>
    <li> My wife loves this, it works just as well at the other expensive ones</li>
    <li> I ws hoping tht it had a more powerful speed. But, I saw on TV to much power WLD be strong on the skin. Can&#x27;t press to hard on the skin. It&#x27;s better thn using your hands.</li>
    <li> I like this 4 in 1 facial body brush it seems to work well It came with a very nice case everything for the price overall great deal</li>
    <li> before I buy this product I watch the ad video about it under the product description. the video looks great and explains everything however when I ordered mine it was completely different. i wanted to return it then I thought I would give it a trial. the first few usages i broke the battery cover while installing the battery. it is very slow and does not do deep cleaning. the brush is very small and the other parts as well. the facial sponge is the worst I even seen, it is torn apart from the second use. now all using it as manual facial brush until i buy better products. i gave it 2 starts because i think it might be a good tool for non-heavy cleaning and definitely not for everyday use.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my daughter for Christmas - it worked great at first and then it just stopped - we have replaced the batteries and it still does not work - put your money towards a better selection - I wish I had.</li>
    <li> I like it, and i don&#x27;t have to pay high prices for facials, nice how to keep my face clean, use it like twice a week. the stone is really smooth to use on the foot, does not do what it should to get rid of calluses</li>
    <li> this device was not what I expected. The battery power is not sufficient! It gives you a way too gentle massage, not enough to remove dead cells.</li>
    <li> Love it so much. I didn&#x27;t give it a five star because the first month or so I used it it made my skin dry, so I use it everyother day.</li>
    <li> I paid fifteen dollars for this item. The product is cheap material, but for the money that I spent is worth it.</li>
    <li> I love this so much. It works great and the case makes it easy to travel with. So far I have not encountered any problems with this product.</li>
    <li> BIGGEST RIPOFF It didn&#x27;t even come with the main massager it only came with the attachments would not recommend this to anybody</li>
    <li> This is flimsy and broke before I used it.  Returned and will not buy this type again.</li>
    <li> This set is a miracle worker. whenever I used to wash my face with soap or scrub i was always felt like i wasn&#x27;t cleaning my face right. As soon as i use it my face felt cleaner and i saw a complete different. People complimented me that i was glowing. I absolutely love the case it comes in, very easy to travel with. I carry this with me everywhere i go !! This has become my partner in traveling.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my 11 year old daughter. It reminds me of an accessory that would come with a doll.  Don&#x27;t waste your money!</li>
    <li> This facial brush has helped my face so much since I&#x27;ve used it. It really cleans deep down and gets all my makeup off at night when I wash my face. I used to hate washing my face when I didn&#x27;t have this brush but now that I have it.. I am so happy with it. ALL the different heads work so good! &amp; I love using my normal face wash with this brush and it really feels like it cleans my face so well. I think this is a very good facial brush, and if you aren&#x27;t looking to spend a whole lot of money, then I think this facial brush is perfect for you!! :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Taylor Payne</li>
    <li> Nice for the price. One of the product broke thats why I gave it a 4 star but over all it is nice for a night and morning skin routine.</li>
    <li> its fine takes batteries so make sure you have rechargable batteries  but wife likes it and makes her skin smooth. thank you</li>
    <li> I was sent this product to review and I have been using it for the past month exclusively. I own a Clarisonic and this does not compare to that at all. I also own the Olay ProX and again, I prefer the Olay. It is an okay tool, but I find that the additional brush heads are not something I would normally use. The batteries run out on this pretty fast as well. I can say that it is a nice product, but the brush head is quite soft so I find that it doesn&#x27;t clean my face as well as my other tools. The pumice stone I would only use on my feet but it needs to be replaced often so it doesn&#x27;t harbor bacteria. The massage brush head was okay, but not something I would seek out. The sponge brush head is also not something I would use. Overall, it is an okay tool but you get what you pay for. If you are new to these types of tools and on a budget then this is good to start with, but don&#x27;t expect it to live up to its higher end competition.</li>
    <li> I love this!!&lt;br /&gt;its very gentle and still cleans my face very well.&lt;br /&gt;I have super extra dry skin and this seems to be better than my &amp;#34;buff puff&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;highly recommended</li>
    <li> MelodySusie a 4 in 1 Facial Cleaning Massager, a portable deeply clean, gently exfoliates, soothes and softens skin.  It has a comfortable hold and is easy to operate with AAA batteries.  A unique packing design for storage and to dry the brush, it has 4 different clean heads and two different washing speeds to meet your facial needs, or whether you choose to use on your hands and feet. It is a gentle and effective way to deeply cleanse the skin, removing impurities and dead skin cells for a rejuvenated and radiant complexion.  For best results advertisers state use in conjunction with the 4 in 1 Facial Cleaning Massager products suitable to your skin type. It comes with a User Manual of instructions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After viewing many different brands of 4 in 1 cleansing systems, massagers by Clarisonic Mia-Graphite or Clarisonic Mia2, SpaLife, Revlon, and Dove Skin Vitalizer Facial Cleaning System, among others. I think that the MelodySusie Facial &amp; Body Brush Spa Cleaning System is a great DEAL, a good quality product, and a great purchase opportunity for all of the uses it has for someone, whether using it as a facial cleanser, body massager, and/or foot cleanser. It would make a great gift, and it is not expensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this product to others, as well as Amazon Customers. This product arrived securely/neatly wrapped, and placed in its own case, sealed with plastic to avoid dust, and any other malfunctions. The delivery was impressive, FAST, and received before the delivery expected date. I am very happy with the reasonable price, the quality of this product, and the many uses that is available with this product for my face, hands, and feet.</li>
    <li> enjoy using this product.. very enjoyable and comfortable!</li>
    <li> Smaller than I expected but this works great. I use about once a week and my face feels much smoother and cleaner!</li>
    <li> It stops working as soon as you try and use it.  The motor is very weak. The attachments fall apart. The switch broke almost instantly. The batteries don&#x27;t last 2 uses. The case and stand are cheap and don&#x27;t stay together. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> Received this product in 2 days.  Fast shipping.  Product does what it is intended to do. Great affordable dupe for a clarisonic. I don&#x27;t like that it is battery operated.  Check out my channel for a video [...]</li>
    <li> I am still playing around with this product, but I have been using the cleansing attachment often and it&#x27;s very soft and gentle. I would not say it&#x27;s a &amp;#34;deep&amp;#34; clean, but it helps give my face a nice fresh and glowing look. The bristles are super soft so I would be comfortable using it daily without irritation. I&#x27;m excited to try the other attachments.</li>
    <li> This item is terrible don&#x27;t waste you&#x27;re money on it.buy the oil of play one or proactiv or something.the one attachment broke when I took it out the box.</li>
    <li> I love this product because it has multi- functions. It can be used on the face as well as other parts of the body.  Easy to interchange the brushes. Excellent  price when I compare this product to other products who only have one use.</li>
    <li> I like the product just thought that the brissells would be alittle more firmmer. It&#x27;s not stong enough to use on the body.</li>
    <li> I WISHED THE BRISTLES WERE A BIT FIRMER, BUT I LIKE IT</li>
    <li> Works ok, could&#x27;ve saved my money on is one...</li>
    <li> I LOVE the makeup removal sponge!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Just what I needed, the whole thing was totally worth buying!! I needed a cheaper yet good quality brush and this did not disappoint me! I will be doing a follow up review in few months or so..</li>
    <li> I just recieved this a few days ago, so this is a first impression. I&#x27;ll definitely write another review once I&#x27;ve used this for a couple of months. So far, so good! I&#x27;ve never used a facial brush like this so I can&#x27;t compare it to the Clarisonic or anything like that. I love how the system is so small and comes in a nice case with all the brush heads so it&#x27;s perfect for travel. I&#x27;ve been using the regular brush head (which is super soft and gentle, doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin) every night and I think it really does deep clean. I never knew how much makeup that was left on my face at night (even after cleansing twice) until using this. My skin feels super soft after using this and I&#x27;m excited to see how this works on my skin in the long run!</li>
    <li> i love this product. I have been using it everyday before going to sleep and it cleans my face really well. the brush is really soft and it really gentle in my skin. i love this! i recommend this to any body. you will get your moneys worth.</li>
    <li> she loved it and was a great gift.  thank you Amazon for making suggestion</li>
    <li> I use it daily and not only does it clean my face but provides a nice massaging effect morning or evening.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s super small and doesn&#x27;t clean well at all. My washcloth is better for cleaning. :(</li>
    <li> I bought this with high hopes...it stopped working after one month of daily use.  It is a waste of money.  The other attachments do not work effectively, the product has no power and is a serious waste of money.</li>
    <li> I had this a while and she&#x27;s still ticking. Old faithful.  I&#x27;m enjoying it. A good buy. Hasn&#x27;t broken and works great.</li>
    <li> This is my first battery operated personal portable FaciaI System I am thoroughly enjoying it.&lt;br /&gt;The bristles are soft and effective.  The pumice attachment is good. I also enjoy the massager with the roller balls.  I have not used the round foam attachment, I&#x27;m quite sure it is relaxing too.&lt;br /&gt;My opinion, great quality for the money.</li>
    <li> BEWARE! Do not use the foot tool on your face! It will mess up your skin and irritate it. Other than that I love the product!</li>
    <li> nothing special, it&#x27;s OK!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about a month and it works pretty well, no problems yet. However, I am a little confused about the 3 other heads... they don&#x27;t work all that well.  So, like other reviewers, the brush head is really the only useful one.  I would prefer a smaller travel case with the 1 head than what it is, but it works.</li>
    <li> I love this face and feet spa system.The first day I got it, I decided to test it out.So I soak my feet,  then I use the polishing stone attachment to get rid of the dead skin.I was amaze at how smooth my feet got, and what I really love about this is, it does not hurt like when they scrub your feet at the nail shop.It is very gentle and effective.It is not as big as I expected, the case is about the size of a small clutch purse, however it makes it easy to carry when traveling.I also tested the latex sponge, which is very soft on the skin.Overall good product and great value.</li>
    <li> I dont like it all. I bought it a month ago since then i was using it everyday...but the product stopped working. The brush wont rotate. Ichanged batteries but still it didnt work. After some days i tried to switch it on and it started to work again. I wish if i can get my money back!!</li>
    <li> Bought this item with high hopes. It showed up on time actually before I expected. it didn&#x27;t comewith any information booklet or instructions. Worked great for a week then broke! Not happy! What worse, I cant find the receipt.</li>
    <li> Been using this product twice a week with my cleanser.  I have noticed a difference in dullness I had before purchasing.  Very happy in product.</li>
    <li> BROKEN when it arrived.  Very UNHAPPY!!</li>
    <li> Broken within a week!!</li>
    <li> So far I am loving this product. It cleans my pores very deeply. I used to rely on the pore cleansing strips by Biore, however it became very expensive to keep up with the routine my skin required. This product is great. Just put a small amount of Neutrogena pink grapefruit wash on the bristle attachment and it works and feels so great! I also use a lot less face wash &#x3D;) great experience thus far. My only critiques: I wish there was a higher spin setting instead of just low and high, I also wish the case it came in was a little more sturdy and compact. The top never really stays on securely.</li>
    <li> Nice and clean feeling after using it. Easy to assemble the item and clean after using. Will recommend to others</li>
    <li> The review was positive so I bought it but then the third level stopped working. So now it only works on the medium level and it slows down when you put it too close to your skin.</li>
    <li> This system is great. I love it I mostly use it on my face because I heard that using this system along with my facial products will work great and my skin has improve. My skin looks more polish and great so this is a good product. The brushes are not too hard and works well with the speed of the machine</li>
    <li> Purchased for family as Christmas gifts.  They have not said what they thought of them yet.  So no news must be good news.</li>
    <li> I wanted a Clarisonic but can&#x27;t afford it right now. I got this little device for Christmas and so far so good. It cleans my face pretty well but I didn&#x27;t notice any difference in my acne - I have a little acne on my cheeks and forehead, as well some blackheads. I use it especially after wearing makeup and my face feels super clean after. I don&#x27;t use the other brush heads (pumice, massager and sponge) that came with this - they&#x27;re kinda useless in my opinion. I have been using the device for 3 months straight now, once a day, and it&#x27;s still going. The brush head is soft enough so it will not be harsh on your skin. The downside to this product is that there are no replacement brush heads available from the manufacturer and I&#x27;m not sure if other brands&#x27; brushes will fit in the device. It was recommended to replace the head every 3 months. The 4 in 1 device is also not waterproof so I keep this by my sink to cleanse my face there instead of in the shower and I also taped up the battery compartment just in case water gets into it. The box and instructions have poorly translated English on it btw. Overall though, a decent device and affordable, but maybe you should look at other brands that offer replacement brush heads, along with different types of brush heads, and don&#x27;t be excited about the other heads that come with this product that might influence buying cleaning devices.</li>
    <li> Bought as a gift! She loves it!</li>
    <li> This was a xmas gift for two of my children they really love this brush for there face it really gets the dirt out and your face feels great.</li>
    <li> First off one review said it was waterproof but when I read through the manual to double check, it says it is NOT and to not use  it in the shower. I won&#x27;t risk it. Kind of a bummer, but that isn&#x27;t the sellers fault at all. This thing is great. I thought maybe  the bristles would be a little rough, but I was wrong. It&#x27;s the softest brush I&#x27;ve ever felt. Don&#x27;t let it fool you though, this thing cleans your face like no other. I have very sensitive skin and eczema and I use this with my regular facial scrub and lotion, my skin feels amazing. This would be a great gift for someone always looking for a new at home spa treatment.&lt;br /&gt;Yes! I&#x27;d recommend it. For under 30 dollars this is a wonderful tool to have.</li>
    <li> I love it , it is very helpful, I use it every day in the morning and in the night for washing my face and message:)</li>
    <li> I used to have one similar to this but I like this one better because is lighter and smaller and a little less loud and does exactly  what is suppose to!! :)</li>
    <li> I have Rosesa for the past 3 years or so now and wanted a facial cleaning brush which was gentle but cleaned my face. I like it  its a good product.I use it with a facial wash and my skin feels and looks smooth after I have started using it&lt;br /&gt;I recommend it!</li>
    <li> first off the product came early which is always a plus, but the value of what you get is great... i had been looking for a facial cleaner and the cheapest in store was $25 so this, coming with more and the price was great is a awesome find... love it</li>
    <li> gave  this to my granddaughter for a gift and she really likes it.</li>
    <li> This works really well and has helped clear some of my acne. I love it, it works great. I would give it 10 stars if I could. This works exactly like the name brand</li>
    <li> Broken when I received it so I never got to use it!</li>
    <li> This product works really good at cleaning my face! The massager was nice! Love how it does different functions! Wish it was rechargeable, but then that would probably make it cost more. Great product for the price! Really enjoy it! My skin felt smoother after just one use!</li>
    <li> I like you can change the heads, face, feet, massage.  Great product at less than half the cost.  I use in the shower as it splashes a little bit.</li>
    <li> For the price this is great.  I give it 4 stars because I do wish it was a bit faster speed.  For my face though...it&#x27;s pefect.  Works great in the shower and has held up to the water.  Comes with a case which is perfect For keeping everything together.</li>
    <li> This has different attachments, which is great. It also has 2 speeds, which a lot of other facial brushes do not have. Easy to use.&lt;br /&gt;I use mine everyday. I love it.</li>
    <li> My face is so clean!  It realy brightens the skin.&lt;br /&gt;Some printed directions would have been helpful.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for a good product.</li>
    <li> This is a very cute brush. Shipping was super quick. I have both the Clarisonic and the ProX. Do not expect this to clean like the Clarisonic because it doesn&#x27;t vibrate and it only spins. I compare the job to the Prox. Its cleans well and for the price its worth it. It also has other cool attachments. I used this to massage my Fiancés back and he loved it.</li>
    <li> This product work amazingly since the first time you use it you can see the difference, your face feels amazing and it glows!</li>
    <li> This brush is fantastic! works as well as the expensive Olay one that I have. Its absolutley fantastic for removing makeup and gets my skin really clean. I&#x27;ve seen a decrease in my over all acne since using this and I love that it comes with different brush heads for different needs! I would have never bought the expensive brush if I would have found this first!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for almost 2 weeks &amp; I can&#x27;t praise it enough. It&#x27;s not too abrasive to scratch the face, but it has replaced my scrubby glove that I previously used to exfoliate my face. This couldn&#x27;t be easier to use. I&#x27;ve used 3 out of the 4 brush heads &amp; love all the ones I&#x27;ve tried. I don&#x27;t have a purpose for the white spongey head, but everything else is great. :) Awesome product.</li>
    <li> I bought it for the brush, which is nice, and the callous remover, which is more effective than I expected.  The motor is not very powerful but it works, it is cordless, and the small packaging is convenient.</li>
    <li> This is a good little set for the price. I find myself using the soft brush more than anything, and it seems to do a decent job with exfoliation. I only used the &amp;#34;sander&amp;#34; once on a callus on my foot, but the &amp;#34;sander&amp;#34; is very fine, and it would have taken a very long time to break down the callus, so I gave up.  I ended up using the &amp;#34;sander&amp;#34; on my face, pressing ever-so-gently, and it did a good job with exfoliating. I would be careful doing that if you have overly sensitive skin, though. The only complaint I would have is that this comes with no directions whatsoever, though it&#x27;s pretty much self-explanatory, anyway.</li>
    <li> I am looking for a facial scrub that is rotating (not vibrating) and this one is the find. It is rotating and works in dual speed, and the brush bristles are just tough enough to clear the pores but gentle enough not to scratch the skin. I would recommend this to anybody.</li>
    <li> I spent $25 on this battery operated product.  I was excited to add this to my  beauty regimen.  I used it for a month and it stopped working..  I&#x27;m soo disappointed..  This is not sturdy enough, so I have found.  Just really disappointing... I would not recommend this to anyone.</li>
    <li> This works great! Great price for this and it does everything it should with versatility in its functions. From facial and body clensing to even feet scrubbing and refining. Definitely a steal!</li>
    <li> First it runs by batteries, so it doesn&#x27;t have much power. It reminds me of a toy. Not fast enough to clean my face. I would not recommend.</li>
    <li> This one is specifically avon brand, it&#x27;s exactly the same as my first one. I absolutely love these things! I use them every morning, and every night that I wear make up, with [[ASIN:B000Q6D3MA Yardley Oatmeal and Almond Bar Soap, 4.25 Ounce]] or [[ASIN:B0000536F0 Aveeno Moisturizing Bar with Natural Colloidal Oatmeal for Dry Skin, Fragrance Free, 3.5 oz]]. I used to have a pretty bad pimple problem, then I started doing this and they went away! After I lost my last face-scrubby thingy, my pimples started coming back. I&#x27;m looking forward to having clear skin again!</li>
