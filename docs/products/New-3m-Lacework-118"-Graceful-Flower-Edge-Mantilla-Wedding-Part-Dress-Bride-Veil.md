    <li> such a beautiful vein!!!! ive used it for photoshoots and it is absolutely stunning!!!! definitely worth the buy and pay!</li>
    <li> Beautiful veil thought it would be a lil different rated a 4 would recommend tore veiw it first well made</li>
    <li> I hate it. It&#x27;s not like they describe it in the advice. Definity I will never use it in my wedding.</li>
    <li> The only thing that could have made this better was if it came with a clip to secure it in place. It is absolutely beautiful.</li>
    <li> The item is not even similar to the one showed in the pictures. The selected color was ivory and i received a withe veil.&lt;br /&gt;Completely different from description&lt;br /&gt;Pictures are not real</li>
    <li> I LOVE this veil! It was exactly what I was looking for and looks amazing, especially for the price. It is exactly as pictured and as described. The shipping was fast, too. I am so excited to wear it!!</li>
    <li> Good morning, I had high expectations with the veil, in the pictures it looks very well presented but is nothing physical. I do not like is more&#x27;m very angry because the finish is horrible, broken wine embroidery fabric hand was badly cut, really did not like and therefore would not recommend.&lt;br /&gt;I had to send fix so that it can save.</li>
    <li> The veil is cute but not three meters as expected and should have better finish seam lace with tulle veil.</li>

    <li> New 3m Lacework 118&amp;#34; Graceful Flower Edge Mantilla Wedding Part Dress Bride in perfect for me, everybody love it, thanks</li>
    <li> Love it so much. It&#x27;s going to be perfect for my wedding. Looks like the 200 dollar one they tired to sell me when I bought my dress.</li>
    <li> Was nervous this veil wouldn&#x27;t arrive in time for my wedding. Had no idea it was coming all the way from China. Just glad ordered it a month in advance. Anyway,it arrived and I love it! As pretty,or prettier,than ones at Davids Bridal where I bought my dress for less than the hundred dollar or more price tags on theirs. There was a loose,strand on it when it arrived,but a,quick snip solved that. The decorative lace pattern around the veil makes it. It is,so pretty and really makes the veil stand out and unique. Love it and can wear it so many different ways. Ill probably double it up so it still long,but not dragging the ground. Don&#x27;t want it getting dirty. Not too worried about it not having pins or anything bc stopped by a local dollar store and bought hair pins to hold it in place. Note: Cant stress this enough ....make sure order this a month in advance or it will not arrive in time. Mine arrived nine days before my wedding and could have saved myself the stress if ordered it a,little earlier.</li>
    <li> very fashionable, large and you can fold it for more design. very nice material but has no pins or comb to attache it to hair. great price compared to bridal stores.</li>
    <li> This is a really pretty veil. It&#x27;s not sewn well and have to rebaste the edges and trim ends better, but will work well for a country wedding. Stood up to dyeing it with teabags to make it ivory. If you want a pure white veil, this is not, but isn&#x27;t ivory either. If you&#x27;re having a formal wedding with an expensive dress, don&#x27;t order. Still like it very much. Would give 5 stars if I didn&#x27;t have to resew the edging.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not high quality lace but looks great for the price.  I was pleasantly surprised.  It&#x27;ll look great for the twenty minutes that I plan to wear it.</li>
    <li> Its okay for the price, but my seamstress is sewing a little the flower edge because it is peeled from the tulle, and Im hoping for it to get softer because the tulle is still very hard and doesnt fall as in the picture, the seamstress says that probably will get softer so if it does I think I will wear it on the Big day!  If you know how the tulle can get softer and fall as in the picture, please let me know,</li>
    <li> It just as picture but it smells like kerosene and it is stiff. but it will look great on me</li>
