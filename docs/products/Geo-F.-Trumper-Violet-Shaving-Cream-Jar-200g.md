      <li>I looked up online for the best shaving cream available.</li>

      <li>It really is the best</li>
      <li>It smells nice too.</li>
      <li>My husband used it, along with a shaving oil underneath it, and he said he really liked it.</li>
      <li>It is a nice cream but don&#x27;t think I will get it again</li>
      <li>It has a light scent, makes great foam, and most important for me, provides a great shave.</li>
      <li>Now, the cream is amazing, I use a Kent BK8 shaving brush to lather this cream with, and it is wonderful, it lathers like magic, the cream is very slick and very easy and smooth, my shave was very smooth with this cream, and it is a very good value, the smell is wonderful, and it is not feminine whatsoever, and it did not dye my Silvertip badger brush in a violet color, not at all</li>
      <li>Great smell - mild on the skin</li>
      <li>This is by far the most superior and the best shaving cream I&#x27;ve tried, I&#x27;ve tried Truefitt &amp; Hill, TOBS, D.R Harris, but nothing is better than this,</li>
      <li>A lovely color, amazing aroma, just a dap is needed and your badger shaving brush.  </li>
      <li>Truly amazing in smell, but most importantly, yields an amazingly close, non-irritating shave.</li>
      <li>if you can get away with the canned stuff count yourself very fortunate.</li>
      <li>You do not need a large amount for a great shave.</li>
      <li>If you are able to use the Mach-50 or whatever they call them these days more power to you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Back</li>
      <li>Love it , the scent and texture.</li>
      <li>The smell is nice, but I think it may not work great w/ sensitive skin...    </li>
      <li>this is among the top 3 that I like (the others are TOBS Jermyn Street, and the Geo F Trumper Limes).</li>
      <li>more.    </li>
      <li>I use a safety razor (merkur blades)some shaving oil from Walmart (love it too) and Trumpers.  </li>
      <li>Sit in the tub, have a nice shave and enjoy.</li>
      <li>I love it, and no I have no affiliation with the company.</li>
      <li>I love this stuff.  </li>
      <li>Trumpers provides a much better shave.</li>
      <li>More often 3.</li>
      <li>Top to bottom.</li>
      <li>Bottom to top.</li>
      <li>Simply the best shaving cream I have used.</li>
      <li>Very rich creamy lather.</li>
      <li>cream provides a great lather when paired with a decent shave bowl and brush.</li>
      <li>I was pleasantly surprised at how quickly the lather built, it was awesome.</li>
      <li>Wonderful quality and terrific smell - not too strong at all.</li>
      <li>Smells great and helps with sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>All the trumpers cream are great that I&#x27;ve tried so far.</li>
      <li>It just is really that good of a product.</li>
      <li>Makes it easy to get up in the morning</li>
      <li>It rinses off easily after the shave.</li>
      <li>Easy order, shipped from out west to the east coast within 4 days.</li>
      <li>I have tried many brands and &amp;#34;flavors&amp;#34; over the years and am thrilled to find someone makes a high quality product like GF&#x27;s Violet cream.  </li>
      <li>more people would try this product I think the Schick and Gillette would be out of the canned shaving cream business quickly.</li>
      <li>If you are looking for a nice floral scent to offset your other more manly creams this would be a good fit for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>This is my absolute favorite shaving soap!  </li>
      <li>DEFINITELY smells GREAT.  </li>
      <li>Fantastic stuff.</li>
      <li>, I find this to be very cost effective.</li>
      <li>I have gotten some great shaves and it lathers better than other products but leaves a stain on the jar itself.</li>
      <li>My new favorite!</li>
      <li>Trumper&#x27;s Shaving cream is one of the 3 T&#x27;s - along with Taylor of Old Bond Street and Truefitt and Hill, these are considered by many wet shaving aficionados as the best in the world.  </li>
      <li>it right!  </li>
      <li>I think I&#x27;ll go shave right now!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;ll last a loooong time and does a much superior job than anything you&#x27;ll get out of a can.</li>
      <li>each his own as far as his methods are concerned.</li>
      <li>DE89bl Chrome Plated Double Edge Safety Razor, I would suggest that you keep shaving with DERBY blades until you have a good technique</li>
      <li>But this makes it a little more pleasant.  </li>
      <li>Great subtle smell that will, with a good razor of course, give one a very close shave without burn or irritation.  </li>
      <li>Has purple tint which does not stain and fades quickly.  </li>
      <li>your skin will be clear, your face soft, and the woman happy.</li>
      <li>It will last for months, and I think the results coupled with how enjoyable it is to use makes it more than worth it.</li>
      <li>I also have very sensitive skin, and this stuff agrees with it better than anything and smells</li>
      <li>The quality is superior - expensive, but good value for the price.</li>
      <li>Truefit &amp; Hill and Taylor of Old Bond street are both far superior Shave creams.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Discovered this cream on a business trip to London years ago.  Absolutely the best shaving cream around.  I have tried many brands and &amp;#34;flavors&amp;#34; over the years and am thrilled to find someone makes a high quality product like GF&#x27;s Violet cream.  Great subtle smell that will, with a good razor of course, give one a very close shave without burn or irritation.  Cannot recommend this product enough.  Has purple tint which does not stain and fades quickly.  I use with a high quality badger brush + Feather brand Double Edge razors....and then finish off with GF&#x27;s skin food (balm).  Great shave day after day.</li>
    <li> This is one of the best shaving creams i have owned!</li>
    <li> Wonderful quality and terrific smell - not too strong at all. One jar lasts for quite some time as well.</li>
    <li> I love this stuff.  After trying several brands of shaving cream with my brush, I keep coming back to this one.  It has a light scent, makes great foam, and most important for me, provides a great shave.</li>
    <li> Simply the best shaving cream I have used. Any Trumper product is superior.</li>
    <li> This is a great cream with a nice floral scent.  If you are looking for lavender however this is NOT a lavender scent.  The smell is very nice though and smells like these trees I would walk by every day on my way to work in London.  Some of the other trumpers creams seem waxy but this one not at all, its smooth and lathers well.  If you are looking for a nice floral scent to offset your other more manly creams this would be a good fit for you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also wouldn&#x27;t worry about any comments saying that it would stain your brush.  I haven&#x27;t had a problem with that and even if it does, who cares?  Its just a brush.</li>
    <li> This is a must have product it and a good Badger shave brush and you will get a shave that makes you look forward to shaving instead of it just being a chore i will never go back to a cheap shave cream out of a can this looks expensive but will go a long long way you just use a little each use. Soooooo Good</li>
    <li> Very rich creamy lather. Super slick. Only issue is it stained my brush purple.</li>
    <li> I have tried almost every shave cream, lotion, etc. to get a better shave and this stuff is the best.  A dab will do you (a little goes a long way), it smells great without being girly, and is easy to lather up.  I have tried Poraso, Col. Conk, Crabtree and Evelyn, and various others, but nothing can touch Trumpers.    I use a safety razor (merkur blades)some shaving oil from Walmart (love it too) and Trumpers.  I still bleed by the third day of shaving, but I have really sensitive skin and thick hair.  Buy this product, you won&#x27;t be sorry!</li>
    <li> This stuff was pretty expensive and I like the TOBS Avocado more.    The smell is nice, but I think it may not work great w/ sensitive skin...    All in all, I recommend TOBS Avocado.</li>
    <li> Really works well but is greasy and stains. I have gotten some great shaves and it lathers better than other products but leaves a stain on the jar itself. I am going back to Bond cream.</li>
    <li> I ordered this on Monday and came with a prompt amazon prime 2 day delivery. When I opened the box, I found the lid wasn&#x27;t closed completely (wasn&#x27;t locked to its final thread). Then when I looked inside I found 1/4 (quarter) size of the cream has been removed. Here is the link of the picture : [...]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As you can see one side has been scooped off and there is a cream on the threads on inner side of the lid. This is a poor customer service and rip off to customers. I demand 100% money back or product replacement.</li>
    <li> This is a very high quality product. A small dab on a shaving brush lathers nicely and provides a smooth shave. It rinses off easily after the shave. It&#x27;s better than any other I have tried. The scent is pleasant and not too strong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If more people would try this product I think the Schick and Gillette would be out of the canned shaving cream business quickly. Trumpers provides a much better shave.</li>
    <li> The Brits &#x27;ave it right!  It&#x27;s the Cuban cigar of shaving cream.  A lovely color, amazing aroma, just a dap is needed and your badger shaving brush.  Sit in the tub, have a nice shave and enjoy.</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome! I could shave with it every single day but I don&#x27;t like to be that predictable so I do have a variety at my disposal. If I&#x27;ve had a long day or anticpate one I&#x27;ll use this to help ease the pain. It smells that good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used to break out horribly after shaving using the mass marketed stuff with rash and irritation. I then discovered wet shaving with a dual edge safety blade and WOW what a difference. If you are able to use the Mach-50 or whatever they call them these days more power to you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Back when I first started shaving I could&#x27;ve shaved with a spoon. Sadly those days are gone and my beard would now give a cheese grater a run for its money. With that said . . . canned shaving cream also seemed to make the whole shaving experience a royal pain in the patella as it was drying and irritating to my skin. Again . . . if you can get away with the canned stuff count yourself very fortunate. In my teens a can of shaving cream would last me 2 years. Go figure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To each his own as far as his methods are concerned. Lets talk about this cream now. It comes in a decent sized jar that sits nice on the sink or hidden away underneath the sink. The container does not feel cheap, but rather well made and something that you don&#x27;t hate to see/use/open/close.  Friends and family who aren&#x27;t savy to wet shaving are always curious about these creams. I consider the jar to contain a generous supply for the price. The fragrance can be a little much for people not into violet. But if you love flowery scents this is definitely a keeper. It doesn&#x27;t smell feminine but I feel it can be unisex. I like to shave with this scent before bed or before a night on the town with the girlfriend. The smell is very therapeutic and not overwhelming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cream provides a great lather when paired with a decent shave bowl and brush. A little goes a long way. Plan to use about a nickle sized amount in the bowl depending on how much lather you like. Wet your brush with warm water. Mix the cream in the bowl. You may add a few more drops of water to get the consistency you desire. Remember that the lather is on your brush and not in your bowl. Apply lather, shave, and rinse.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I usually apply the lather for a minimum of 2 passes. More often 3. When we have a date night planned I go the extra mile with a 4th pass. Back to front. Front to back. Top to bottom. Bottom to top. If you enjoy the smell of your cream apply a little behind your ears and rub it in.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Follow up with a toner based bump preventer if you&#x27;re prone to razor bumps and then after shave. Lastly apply a shaving lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you stick with a routine your skin will be clear, your face soft, and the woman happy. Using quality products like this make shaving a little more enjoyable. I think I&#x27;ll go shave right now!</li>
    <li> This product provides a luxurious, thick cream which softens hard stubble. The smell is great, without being sickening sweet. I slightly prefer Trumper&#x27;s Rose shaving cream, though.</li>
    <li> A little expensive but it is much nicer than other shaving creams out there which makes it worth it.  I&#x27;m a man and was worried about the &#x27;violet&#x27; smell but it really isn&#x27;t feminine at all.</li>
    <li> I am fairly new to wet shaving and still in the process of trying different blades and creams.  I saw that this cream is highly recommended in most of the literature about wet shaving.  This is a little harder then some of the other creams, but does make a nice foam and the violet smell is nice.  It is a nice cream but don&#x27;t think I will get it again becasue of the cost.</li>
    <li> I bought this product for my son for Christmas with the recommendation of his wife.  He loves it.  He said it is the only kind he can brand he uses for his skin type.</li>
    <li> Trumper&#x27;s Shaving cream is one of the 3 T&#x27;s - along with Taylor of Old Bond Street and Truefitt and Hill, these are considered by many wet shaving aficionados as the best in the world.  The violet is a great scent and one of the most popular.  Note: A little more expensive than the other two, but the Trumper&#x27;s tub is a little bigger 200g vs. 150g for the Taylor&#x27;s, 165g for Truefitt.  This scent/cream is my personal favorite.  I also highly recommend the Taylor of Old Bond Street Rose.</li>
    <li> This is by far the most superior and the best shaving cream I&#x27;ve tried, I&#x27;ve tried Truefitt &amp; Hill, TOBS, D.R Harris, but nothing is better than this, the closest one to this cream is the T&amp;H, they are both amazing. Now, the cream is amazing, I use a Kent BK8 shaving brush to lather this cream with, and it is wonderful, it lathers like magic, the cream is very slick and very easy and smooth, my shave was very smooth with this cream, and it is a very good value, the smell is wonderful, and it is not feminine whatsoever, and it did not dye my Silvertip badger brush in a violet color, not at all, this is one the best creams you can buy out there. I would like to talk about wet shaving for a bit, for everyone who is reading this and is considering to start wet shaving I highly encourage you to start doing that, it is a wonderful experience, it is very relaxing and will give you the cleanest shave of your life, and it will definitely not cause you any pulling or tugging or redness or any acne, I used to get acne from shaving with a Gillette, and it was awful, then switched to wet shaving, and Bam! less than a month and the acne was gone, if you want to start wet shaving I would suggest the following kits: if you are on a budget that&#x27;s less than  $100, I would suggest you getting the following: Proraso Shaving Cream, Eucalyptus &amp; Menthol, 150 ml, New Formulation, Proraso Aftershave Lotion, Refresh, 100 ml, Parker Safety Razor 100% Pure Badger Bristle Shaving Brush with Black Handle &amp; Free Brush Stand, and also, Edwin Jagger DE89bl Chrome Plated Double Edge Safety Razor, I would suggest that you keep shaving with DERBY blades until you have a good technique, they are around $7 for 50 blades, they will last you at least 5 months, then switch to a Feather, DO NOT START WITH A FATHER! it is very sharp for a beginner. Now, if you are on a really really tight budget, I would suggest getting the following: Van Der Hagen Men&#x27;s Luxury, Shave Set, Weishi 9306-f New Double Edge Safety Razor with 10 Blades, and do not use the blades this razor comes with, they are awful, instead, get 50 Derby Extra Double Edge Razor Blades Stainless Steel, If you are on a generous budget get the following: any Geo F. Trumper or Truefitt &amp; Hill shaving cream, any Geo F. Trumper Skin Food, and for a brush, I would suggest a KENT BK8 OR BK4, a Simpson Duke 3, or a High Density Premium Silvertip Badger Shaving Brush WSP &amp;#34;Monarch&amp;#34;, the WSP is the best bang for the buck, plus it is a superb quality, For s stand, I would suggest: Burleigh men&#x27;s shaving stand, or an Escali razor stand. and this tip is for any budget: DO NOT BUY A SHAVING BOWL OR MUG, they are a theft, just get a mug or a bowl from the kitchen or get any cermaic bowl from walmart or target, or a salsa bowl, they cost less than $6. and have a good shave everybody.</li>
    <li> I was a little hesitant at first because when I opened the jar, it looked like this purple paste-goop. I was so used to using whatever shave gel I found at the grocery store. However, I decided to take the foray into shaving with some real shaving cream and a badger hair brush and will never look back.    I was skeptical at other users who said to only use a dab, but I didn&#x27;t use much on the shave brush and WOW it lathered my entire face!! I used this shave gel, the gillette warming face scrub [[ASIN:B003M6TAOQ Gillette Fusion Proseries Thermal Face Scrub, 100-ml (Pack of 2)]], and a colonel conk badger hair shaving brush [[ASIN:B001XURHAW Colonel Conk Progress Model 1001 Standard Pure Badger Shaving Brush, Black Handle]] also bought on amazon, and received the closest shave I&#x27;ve ever given myself without shaving against the grain.    This stuff is awesome</li>
    <li> I looked up online for the best shaving cream available. After all the reviews, I selected the highly rated geo f trumpers shaving cream. Since I could not find it at my local stores, I ordered it online. It really is the best and I will never look for another brand. If you are looking for the perfect shaving cream, this is it and worth every penny. I love it, and no I have no affiliation with the company. It just is really that good of a product.</li>
    <li> Trumper Shave creams are just average. They are basically  all the same except for the different scents which are not very strong at all. Truefit &amp; Hill and Taylor of Old Bond street are both far superior Shave creams.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t get 5 stars b/c of how expensive it is.  Not sure that it&#x27;s worth the price for the functionality.  I&#x27;m a newbie on using a straight razor, so maybe I am missing something, but functionality is all I was searching for.  I find that the WAY less expensive items I can buy at the local grocery work just as well, or maybe even better for me.    DEFINITELY smells GREAT.  One would think that a great smelling, purple cream one puts on their face would be less than manly, but IT&#x27;S NOT!      I&#x27;m going to use the sturdy canister to hold loose screws and nails in my shop.  I bet it would work as a good ash tray as well.</li>
    <li> Smells great and helps with sensitive skin. You do not need a large amount for a great shave. Use it every 2-3 days and my skin is never irritated.</li>
    <li> All the trumpers cream are great that I&#x27;ve tried so far. Superb lather and good protection. The scent is as you would expect, a very flowery scent. With a few swirls on the top with a brush and it was plenty loaded for a 3 pass shave. The 200g tub means you&#x27;re getting the cost value of a Taylor&#x27;s tub(if you can find it for $18-19).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The violet color I&#x27;ve heard can stain, but as long as you whip it up good, it&#x27;ll all turn white.</li>
    <li> Excellent product.  I use it when I use my straight razor - usually on Saturdays when I have the time to be careful....</li>
    <li> Geo F Trumper Violet shave cream: My new favorite! Great smell - mild on the skin (and I have sensitive skin). I love this stuff! I have many soft shaving creams/soaps (croaps) and the tubs go a loooong way so I wish I would have ordered the smaller tube instead if I&#x27;d known how far it would go (I subsequently ordered the limes in the tube and that was plenty) The quality is superior - expensive, but good value for the price. I have TOBS, T&amp;H, and a lot of the less expensive brands to choose from and this is among the top 3 that I like (the others are TOBS Jermyn Street, and the Geo F Trumper Limes). IMO this provides the best (thickest and least irritating) lather of them all.</li>
    <li> Fun and purple. My husband used it, along with a shaving oil underneath it, and he said he really liked it.</li>
    <li> Smooth shaving, delicate parfume. Looks expensive but it&#x27;s not if you count the number of shavings you get from a jar.</li>
    <li> Great shaving product. It seems expensive, but when applied correctly with a brush, will last at least a month, maybe two.</li>
    <li> This is my absolute favorite shaving soap!  Smells great, lathers easily, and protects my skin. It only takes a tiny bit to create tons of thick lather.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t written a review for any website except trip advisor before. Easy order, shipped from out west to the east coast within 4 days. Box was slightly damaged but I work in retail and am realistic. I was happy and so was the gift recipient...also best price I found anywhere :)</li>
    <li> My husband loves the Trumper shaving cream products.  These are the only ones he will use and the travel tube is also easily packable.  Great product and scents.</li>
    <li> But this makes it a little more pleasant.  It is a good product.  The initial price seems higher than it really is.  It only takes a small daub about the size of an almond to give me a good shave.  The smell reminds of when barbers actually used a straight razor on clients.  I will keep this in my rotation of soaps.  (Proraso, Geo. F Trumper&#x27;s Violet, Taylor of Bond St. Grapefruit, Col. Conk Lime, and La Toja)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very good product.</li>
    <li> Great shave cream,if you like Taylor of old bond st you will like Geo f Trumper as well.The violet sent is great not overpowering.the shave cream lathers up .Nice good shave.</li>
    <li> Smells great and creates a beautiful lather when combined with a badger hair brush. It beats the hell out of canned foam.</li>
    <li> Smooth, luxurious, smells great, and provides a close, great shave. Amazing stuff. The tub will last for many months if you use sparingingly with a brush. There&#x27;s nothing like waking up with this stuff in the mornings. Truly amazing in smell, but most importantly, yields an amazingly close, non-irritating shave. Price on this site is a rip-off.</li>
    <li> Now this stuff is wonderful! I am relatively new to DE razors using the Mach 3 for the first 17 or so years of my shaving life. I started shaving with Proraso pre-shave cream and TOBS Sandlewood. The Sandlewood is great and I got a decent shave from it but I found perfecting the lather was harder for me. I got the Geo F. Trumper Violet in today and couldn&#x27;t wait to shave. I used the Proraso pre-shave as usually and started my lather. I was pleasantly surprised at how quickly the lather built, it was awesome. The scent is really great as well. It is complex, floral and fresh!</li>
    <li> scent is unnatural and I find it distracting. This used to be a great product.</li>
    <li> This is the first high end shave cream I&#x27;ve purchased. Did quite a bit of research, narrowed it down to a couple different brands and finally selected this one. I bought this shaving cream because I wanted something delicate and not rose (most common floral aroma).&lt;br /&gt;It has a very nice smell, and makes a thick rich lather providing a superior slick barrier to protect against razor irritation. The only thing I don&#x27;t like about this is the cream is dyed purple, which irritates my very sensitive skin. I&#x27;ll keep shopping, but probably come back to this one eventually. It is a very nice cream!</li>
    <li> Same quality that Proraso Shaving Cream, I will recommend the Proraso, of course. This Geo F. Trumper Shaving Cream is well expensive, three times more than the Proraso. This violet color leave stain on the brush too.</li>
    <li> Geo F. Trumper makes wonderful shaving cream.  Don&#x27;t be thrifty about this, your face is on the line!  It smells nice too.</li>
    <li> Love it , the scent and texture. Highly recommend to everyone.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Geo Trumper shave cream for 1 1/2 years and my first jar is about to run out.  It&#x27;ll last a loooong time and does a much superior job than anything you&#x27;ll get out of a can.</li>
    <li> Fantastic stuff. I made the switch from cartridges to DE razors a few months ago, and this cream is one of the biggest reasons I haven&#x27;t looked back. It&#x27;s an absolute breeze to lather this stuff up, and you only need about the amount that would fit on the end of your pinkie finger to make more than enough for a full shave. I also have very sensitive skin, and this stuff agrees with it better than anything and smells fantastic!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although its $32, I find this to be very cost effective. It will last for months, and I think the results coupled with how enjoyable it is to use makes it more than worth it. I got mine two months ago and still am not halfway through.</li>
    <li> Actually I have found Taylor of Old Bond Street shave cream and Art of Shaving cream work better.  This is not a bad product, but I just don&#x27;t seem to be getting the best shave with this stuff.</li>
    <li> also excellent in all respects. Makes it easy to get up in the morning</li>
