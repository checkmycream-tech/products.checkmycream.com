<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Got this for my husband and I just love the smell on him.</li>
    <li> I actually bought this cologne for myself. I love the smell of the cloves and it reminds me of Spellbound, the perfume by Estee Lauder, but with a masculine twist.</li>
    <li> This is a fresh, sexy, understated, and classy scent.  This could almost fall into a summer scent category except it is a bit more complex and sexy to live there.  This is my go to going out scent and is definitely one of my favorites.  If I&#x27;m feeling even more sexy or, um, know that clothes will be coming off the I lean towards Rorchas Man.  Otherwise this is what I wear most often at night.</li>
    <li> I love this scent on my husband. We smelled it at the Macy&#x27;s but decided not to buy it. I came on Amazon and it was $30 cheaper so I just had to buy it.</li>
    <li> I like it, its just not that useful.    Its perfect if you want to get intimate with someone. Spray this on and get close with your partner and you&#x27;ll be set! It&#x27;s wonderful for that.    bottom line &#x3D; lil longevity, very lil projection, smells like tea!</li>
    <li> Speed on the delivery average. What is really great is the price of the product and the mission of the company - to bring you low-priced designer fragrances. Nothing was damaged and the fragrance authentic, I would definitely order from this seller again.</li>
    <li> smells wonderful my dad loves this cologne</li>
    <li> This is one of the best smelling fragrances i have ever used.. i received the product super fast and im very pleased with the size of the product for the price offered.. I HIGHLY recommend this fragrance to everyone</li>
    <li> This is the best men&#x27;s cologne in my opinion, hands down.  Very clean and fresh scent.  Cologne is to be lightly sprayed, not bathed in.... so of course the smell will wear off after a few hours.  Most men do not know how to properly apply cologne, if you can smell the cologne from 10 feet away or if you can smell it on you for days.... you put too much on dude.</li>
    <li> i bought for my hubby for christmas and he love it</li>
    <li> You&#x27;ll be fighting the women off when you wear this great fragrance.  Be careful.  LOL</li>
    <li> i happen to saw this cologne at the gucci store counter after purchasing a belt. i asked for a sample smell and after taking a wiff of it. i was hooked. i would definilty recommend this.. this sits well with my burberry and Calvin Klein, and Pi collection</li>
    <li> it smells very light and fresh...not heavy at all...it is a great smell, the only problem is on ME (may be different for others) it only lasts a few hours...which is less than id expect from a designer brand EDT</li>
    <li> This scent is amazing, clean,crisp, and manly. Your girl( or guy) will love it. I highly recommend it, buy the big bottle don&#x27;t be cheap.</li>
    <li> A Tier I cologne, worth the money, only takes one squirt. I like it for dinner and dates.</li>
    <li> Package arrived in great time.  Love the scent. Ordered it for my brother for the holidays.  He loved it.  Would recommend.  Great size bottle, good price, great smell.</li>
    <li> For the people that said perfume can be water down  you will see the difference  right away because perfume is oil  or adding a filler will change the smell in seconds..........</li>
    <li> Amazon is the best site to buy anything you want at the cheapest price!!!  Love amazon!</li>
    <li> Love this fragrance, very sophisticated, very chic, good seller, its an incredible perfume, I recommend. Every one likes...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can buy it.</li>
    <li> Really good smelling fragrance not in your face, very smooth, and relaxing Tea scent, Something about this scent relaxes me.&lt;br /&gt;My Grade&lt;br /&gt;Scent: B+&lt;br /&gt;Longevity: C (average about 4-6 hours on my skin)&lt;br /&gt;Projection: C- (Very Close to the skin after 1-2 hours)&lt;br /&gt;Versatility: A ( This can be a signature scent, dating, work, lounging)&lt;br /&gt;OverAll: B</li>
    <li> I have worn many fantastic fragrances; Gucci, Armani, Dolce &amp; Gabana, etc. This is one of my faves and will probably wear it until I get sick of it. The only gripe is that it&#x27;s so light that it doesn&#x27;t last very long at all- maybe a few hours. So for clubbing it doesn&#x27;t work too well. Either way, the smell in itself puts me in a wonderful mood.</li>
    <li> I needed cologne and always bye from Amazon due to the fact you can find out whats new,look at peoples reviews, get super saver shipping with no tax and get a really good deal,around a third off a stores price,,,anyway I came accros this Gucci stuff,now we all know Gucci stands for class so I bought a bottle,,,I have no idea what the other reviews are sniffing but in my opion this stuff is just average at best that came in a fancy bottle,it should be in a plastic bottle between the Brut and Old Spice at the drug store for $4.95 with a coupon..</li>
    <li> got this as a gift for another person. great gift and great scent and awesome price. all that was expected.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping... I ordered on Friday and I received it Monday...I was all Xcited, until I opened it and the first sign it was a fake was the color...it was a lavender color when it&#x27;s supposed to be blue... I sprayed it and it&#x27;s definitely wrong wrong wrong...I&#x27;m very disappointed, I order perfume and cologne all the time from Amazon and this is the first time I&#x27;ve been duped.  Since liquids can not be retuned, I contacted the live chat and they are going to send me a replacement, fingers crossed that the next bottle will be legit and on the up and up. I will provide an update once the new bottle is received.</li>
    <li> This is amazing. I mean truly amazing.&lt;br /&gt;I have a bit of an obsession with colognes. To name a few I have, Cartier Roadster, John Varvatos Vintage, Mambo, Burberry Weekend, etc...  They all have their places in my collection and are used at different times, but Gucci takes the gold for the best all around everyday cologne. I get WAY more compliments on this then any cologne I have ever used. It is seriously perfection.&lt;br /&gt;It can be worn with a suit and tie, a button down and jeans or dressed all the way down to shorts and a t-shirt, I even wear it with cowboy boots and hat. It seems to adapt and adjust to anything and everything.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t buy this cologne, I want to make sure there is an endless supply for me. I want this all to myself, do not purchase!!</li>
    <li> I have never run across a smell like this.&lt;br /&gt;It is a spicy, full scent that is intoxicating!!!&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> This is by far the best and my favorite mens cologne. Everyone loves the scent. Not too strong and not too light.</li>
    <li> This was recommended by a coworker, and i can&#x27;t keep my hands off my other half when he wears it.</li>
    <li> My husband is a big fan of this one, very happy with item :) And the price is fantastic compared to department stores.</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband back in 2010 he loved it so much I bought it again. Smells very nice. Thank you.</li>
    <li> its real and its the best. I will buy more.</li>
    <li> Gucci Pour Homme II is popular on YouTube reviews and I bought it based on those.  It smells nice,  but as some noted, it doesn&#x27;t project or have as much longevity as I would like.  Lasted about 5 hours on my skin, which is on the short side.  I expect it would do better in warmer temperatures compared to the 20 degrees I tried it in. I see it doing better in the spring or cool summer nights.</li>
    <li> One of the best colonge&#x27;s I own. And I own many. Very underated. Very fresh and clean.</li>
    <li> My number one summer cologne.</li>
    <li> My husband has been wanting this cologne for a long time!  He said he has used it in the past!  I finally ordered it for him!  He was so excited!  I love it!  It smells great!  Has a delicate scent that&#x27;s not over powering yet very manly and sexy!</li>
    <li> Love it, a clean and cool scent that is great for the office. I just wish it would last longer.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for myself, I&#x27;m a woman and I just love how it smells on me.</li>
    <li> Let me start by noting that I&#x27;m an avid cologne collector/enthusiast, who spends a lot of time sampling fragrances and reading about them online before making a purchase. After having sampled this cologne in one retail store some time ago,  I decided to order a sample through a cologne sample website that I trust. I had read reviews on fragrance forums, and was aware of claims that it is weak, but I was excited to try it for myself over a longer period than my one day at the aforementioned store (I must have had six colognes on my skin by the end of that day so I didn&#x27;t have a clear picture of its performance). After three days of wearing Gucci PH II from the sample, I was happy with the performance of the scent, as it both smells absolutely incredible and lasts for 8 hrs plus on my skin with moderate projection. --As a side note, the fragrance is prominently black tea and tobacco, and I find it to be incredibly classy and very comforting to my nose.--I confirmed the performance with a sample from a second retail which I procured after having worn the one from the aforementioned website.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I knew I would need to have a full bottle of this scent, but didn&#x27;t want to pay full retail if I didn&#x27;t have to. I came to Amazon and found that the cologne was listed at a great price here, but reading the reviews, I was concerned about the fact that some reviewers were apparently experiencing bad performance, leading them to claim that they had received a counterfeit product. After much thought, I decided to take a chance and place an order (directly from Amazon, not a third party seller).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received the cellophane-wrapped Gucci Pour Homme II box from Amazon today. Before removing the cellophane, I found the date code stamped on the bottom of the box and entered it into a cosmetics database, finding that the bottle was produced in May of 2014. Once I opened the product, I checked the bottom of the bottle and found a matching date code located there. As a final indication that the bottle arrived fresh, I had to depress the sprayer three times before any fragrance came out, thereby demonstrating to my mind that the bottle hadn&#x27;t been previously sprayed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To make absolutely sure, I sprayed some of the cologne from the bottle I received from Amazon on one hand and some from the sample I had been wearing since last week on the other hand, noting that the smell was identical. After a couple of hours, with the scent still smelling great on both hands, I went to the gym, and worked out. Following my workout, the Gucci was still performing well on my skin, only becoming faint after I took a shower. I must clarify that this scent is by no means a powerhouse, but I find it does produce enough projection, as I can smell it while moving around throughout the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All this being said, my experience with Amazon was great, and I wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to purchase this fragrance here again. As to the differing opinions regarding the longevity of Gucci Pour Homme II in general, I think it might be due to different skin types or application techniques of the respective reviewers, and I&#x27;m just glad it works well for me.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite cologne hands down! The smell is just so amazing.. Woody, tea, cinnamon! Lasts 8 hours on my skin! And attracts girls in a heartbeat. Sprayed this on at ulta and the same night I bought this on amazon.. Super fast shipping, packaging, and bottle are heavy and luxurious... And the SMELL is the TITS</li>
    <li> For the people that are saying this smell is too weak. DO NOT BUY IT THROUGH AMAZON!! This is my most favorite cologne ever. I bought it through Amazon and it was completely watered down. For the best quality, buy it directly from Gucci.com. You&#x27;ll pay more, but the smell will last forever, and I get compliments every time I wear it.</li>
    <li> So Fresh And So Clean</li>
    <li> This is by far my favorite cologne!!!!! Fresh, clean, and light, with a hint of licorice to add some depth.</li>
    <li> Smells great on my hubby.  It is a fresh sexy scent that lasts all day on him.  He likes it too lol.</li>
    <li> Very quick shipping and quality product</li>
    <li> My buddy used to wear this stuff all the time, and I was curious to what it was, he finally told me. I went to a fragrance dept and come to find out they have discontinued it :( but thank god for amazon! I received this today and went out to apple bee&#x27;s with my girlfriend and 3 girls behind us eating kept saying someone smelled good, one of them tapped my girlfriend and asked if it was me, and they asked what it was, but I didn&#x27;t tell them ;) so that great first day out and 3 compliments! gotta love this stuff and its the real deal. Bottle is very rich looking and heavy! 5/5 stars for sure!</li>
    <li> This cologne smells great and always gets compliments. This is my go to cologne. I used to only wear Polo Blue, but I like this better. Only down side is the shape of the glass. It&#x27;s a big heavy square and I feel like I&#x27;m holding a small brick when putting it on.</li>
    <li> I purchase this as a gift for someone and it smelled so good that I had to go buy it myself. My #1 favorite. Light yet masculine, sweet smell. Definite head turner. This have everything beat thats out right now.</li>
    <li> I love the aroma of this cologne. This is the second or third bottle I&#x27;ve purchased. It has a very hard to describe scent. Be warned, you&#x27;ll only smell it after five minutes if you&#x27;re very heavy handed with it. The smell doesn&#x27;t linger like other cologne. It&#x27;s too light and weakens shortly after you start your day. Still worth it for me.</li>
    <li> Very good smelling scent can&#x27;t wear it all the time!</li>
    <li> I purchased Gucci Pour Homme II for my husband for Valentines day.  This fragrance smells wonderful on my husband and he likes it as well!  The service I received was excellent.  The product arrived on time and in good condition.  I am very pleased with this seller and product and would purchase again.</li>
    <li> The best sofisticated fragance i ever bought</li>
    <li> Go it as a gift for my husband...we both love it!</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this perfume and my husband too. It is simply delicious and sexy aroma that invite you to be closer in a sexy way to your partner.</li>
    <li> I just received  my cologne and I really like. One of my favorite .Good price and delivery fast.</li>
    <li> Great smell, but does NOT last long at all...VERY weak. I am an avid fragrance collector, and this cologne smells amazing, don&#x27;t get me wrong, but it doesn&#x27;t have the oomph to stay on more than 2 hours (and I have had a few friends try it on to test that it wasn&#x27;t just my chemistry that was making it fade so fast).</li>
    <li> I was nervous that ordering a fragrance from amazon would be fake, but this one was fully authentic. It smells clean like black tea and violet leaves. In my opinion, this is one of the best underrated fragrances out there.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping! My husband loved it! Smells great! It is NOT a knock off product! It is the REAL thing! Will buy again!</li>
    <li> Love it. Smells phenominal. Really satisfied with my purchase. Gucci never fails to make me happy. I think the 3.4 is a decent size.</li>
    <li> Excellent quality and delivery. I was pleasantly surprised. Thank you. I will definitely contact you again, whenever I have the need of another lotion.</li>
    <li> I bought this based on other reviews i&#x27;d read... It smells SOOO good and my wife is VERY happy I took a chance and bought it!</li>
    <li> Gucci pour homme ii is the best Cologne I have ever used. I would recommend this to anybody. Hands down the best.</li>
    <li> I love this product. Smells so good and clean. I have been using this Gucci product for years now. I find the smell to be suitable for day or night.</li>
    <li> My order arrived very fast and the cologne is great!! I&#x27;ve been using Gucci Pour Homme II for a few yrs now and I Love it!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ll start by saying I&#x27;m no fragrance expert but I have a pretty substantial collection of men&#x27;s frags.&lt;br /&gt;I bought this based solely on reviews at fragrance sites. It&#x27;s not what I really expected but it&#x27;s a nice scent. I expected something a little more seductive and to me Gucci PH2 is more of a relaxing/calming scent. It smells like tea and citrus to my nose. If I had smelled it before buying I probably wouldn&#x27;t have purchased it. Not that it&#x27;s a bad scent though. A lot of people complain about the longevity but I get a good 5-6 hours out of it but after the first 30-60 minutes it stays very close to skin. Good everyday casual scent.</li>
    <li> I purchased this item on Amazon because Macy&#x27;s no longer carries it. Macy&#x27;s offered to order it but I was looking to save money &amp; ordered it on Amazon. The scent is very light. It doesn&#x27;t even last an hour. I definitely wasted my money. I DO NOT recommend anyone buying it. Try to buy from a retail store. NOT HERE!</li>
    <li> Very nice men&#x27;s cologne, smells like burrberry london for men but fresher and less woodsy kinda like &amp;#34;drakkar &amp; burrberry london mixed&amp;#34;!</li>
    <li> Masterpice !  A must, if you&#x27;re into Tea fragrance !</li>
    <li> I was thinking of buying this fragrance since long. Glad I finally purchased it from Amazon. It&#x27;s a decent one from the house of Gucci. Has nice smell and has fantastic prejection and lonjevity. To me, this one is easily one of the top few that Gucci currently has in their men&#x27;s fragrance lineup. Needless to say, like always delivered it quite fast. Thank you Amazon.</li>
    <li> Great smell, my favorite.</li>
