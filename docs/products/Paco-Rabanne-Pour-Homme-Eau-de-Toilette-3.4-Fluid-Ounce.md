      <li>The cologne&#x27;s scent is clean and fresh.</li>
      <li>And surprisingly the young people that I have exposed to it really like the scent.</li>
      <li>This is a classic scent that is sophisticated and works well in the sumner as well as the winter.</li>
      <li>exactly what I wanted!</li>
      <li>I have been buying my husband Pac Rabanne Cologne for special occasions since before we were married 30 years ago.  </li>
      <li>the price is right</li>
      <li>this is the most reasonable place as far as price.  </li>
      <li>The container for that new product is absolutely hideous !!!</li>
      <li>Very fast shipping.  </li>

      <li>When i bought Paco Rabanne in 1982 first time ,till now i like</li>
      <li>He love it!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a combination of lavender and honey that makes you feel as if you&#x27;re sitting in a European sidewalk cafe reading Le Monde.</li>
      <li>and he absolutely loves it!</li>
      <li>and I still like it like the first time.</li>
      <li>Thanks!</li>
      <li>OVER POWERING AT FIRST, SMELLS LIKE AN AFTERSHAVE.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t get much longevity out of this when it&#x27;s on my skin, but walking through a few mists of this in a clean white shirt will set me up for a great spring day.&lt;br</li>
      <li>This cologne is a classic, my husband loves it!</li>
      <li>Everything in here smells REAL.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this product!</li>
      <li>Colognes are very personal-they either work for you or they don&#x27;t.</li>
      <li>Thanks for your service, speed and consistently reasonable prices.  </li>
      <li>When I first bought this at the store, I bought this blind, hoping it would smell great, and IT DID,</li>
      <li>difference between this and any of the Cool Water clones that have been produced since is obvious from one whiff.</li>
      <li>It does not seem to be as fragrant as the older bottle I had.</li>
      <li>Will definitely buy more if price remains the same.</li>
      <li>A timeless fragrance...wore it as a young adult when it first came out in the &#x27;70s.</li>
      <li>Refuse to buy the manufacture&#x27;a new product.</li>
      <li>The new version is NOT a scent I like.  </li>
      <li>Classic fragrance that never gets old ...</li>
      <li>One of the benefits of Paco Rabanne is that it does not seem to irritate people who are sensitive to fruity or flowery or whatever scent.</li>
      <li>My favorite cologne at a reasonable price (it&#x27;s at least 50% more expensive at local outlets).</li>
      <li>I outlive them all and get fresh product after a few years.</li>
      <li>The scent  doesn&#x27;t seem to last as long as the old one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>

<li> For some reason this seems to be difficult to find.</li>

    <li> Very fast shipping.  Great product.</li>
    <li> It arrived on time and good product.</li>
    <li> i have always loved the smell of this cologne</li>
    <li> I bought it to my father as a gift from xmas. He love it!&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a combination of lavender and honey that makes you feel as if you&#x27;re sitting in a European sidewalk cafe reading Le Monde.</li>

    <li> Great scent that my husband has been wearing forever...great price.</li>
    <li> One of my favorite men&#x27;s fragrances, have liked this one since Nixon was President and to still works for me.</li>
    <li> I have been using Paco Rabanne since 1978. It is subtle, pleasant and sexy!! You do not need to put a lot on you when applying. I have two people in my life with allergies who complain about other peoples perfume/cologne but always compliment me on how I smell!! Excellent cologne for men, would choose over Polo and Ralph Lauren any day!</li>
    <li> My husband loves this. I&#x27;m happy that I can order this product so easily</li>
    <li> Paco paco, being in the market for so long and still leaving marks, no matter how many new cologne are out there paco still the best</li>
    <li> No commendations yet, but I am loving it so far!!</li>
    <li> My favorite cologne at a reasonable price (it&#x27;s at least 50% more expensive at local outlets). Will definitely buy more if price remains the same. Thanks!</li>
    <li> I have worn Paco Rabanne for years and will continue to wear it until it is no longer available. The cologne&#x27;s scent is clean and fresh.

As a result, Paco Rabanne makes the world much more pleasant for all.</li>
    <li> this stuff smells great. the color of the bottle is cool. it lasts a long time so it&#x27;s a really great value. it&#x27;s good quality stuff so you only need to put a little on and it lasts all day.</li>
    <li> I have always smelled this way when I wanted to smell any other way than as myself. I am not a cologne or scent person unless I feel like it. When I do, I like this one and have for years. My first bottle was many years ago. I outlive them all and get fresh product after a few years.</li>
    <li> I have been buying my husband Pac Rabanne Cologne for special occasions since before we were married 30 years ago.  I am so grateful to have found this on Amazon because I only found a newer version when I shopped at Christmas time.  The new version is NOT a scent I like.  This scent still thrills me.</li>
    <li> I like the smell, but it does not appear to stay as long as I remember.&lt;br /&gt;I have not worn it in awhile. My fiance&#x27; was not impressed</li>
    <li> I bought it for my father in-law.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t leave home without it been wearing it for thirty years</li>
    <li> this is an excellent scent. a little goes a long way. the big 3.4 oz bottle is the best value.</li>
    <li> When i bought Paco Rabanne in 1982 first time ,till now i like and that is why i keep buy it when ever i run out</li>
    <li> Colognes are very personal-they either work for you or they don&#x27;t. This is a classic scent that is sophisticated and works well in the sumner as well as the winter. Not overloaded with citrus as are a lot of colognes these days. And surprisingly the young people that I have exposed to it really like the scent. Test it in the stores but buy it from Amazon!</li>
    <li> this cologne was a gift to my brother, and he loves it</li>
    <li> wonderful cologne, year after year, still the best. do not miss it, buy today, try to get one before goes away</li>
    <li> OVER POWERING AT FIRST, SMELLS LIKE AN AFTERSHAVE. I would use this Cologne in a club atmosphere.Lasts a long time, evening wear, lasts through sweating.</li>
    <li> This cologne is a classic, my husband loves it!</li>
    <li> Great cologne great price.</li>
    <li> This was bought as a thank you gift for my brother and he absolutely loves it! I highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> A timeless fragrance...wore it as a young adult when it first came out in the &#x27;70s. Still rocks!!!</li>
    <li> Good overall I would recommend 👍👌</li>
    <li> Good price.  Prompt shipping.  Made in Spain.  It does not seem to be as fragrant as the older bottle I had.</li>
    <li> I have used this fragrance for over 35 years and I still like it like the first time. But I think I can get it cheaper in another store.</li>
    <li> The ad and the invoice says Cologne - like noted above - however the bottom of the bottle says eau de toilette which is a body spray not a cologne.</li>
    <li> For the price you can not go wrong for this size. This is one of our favorite colognes and we can always get the best buy at Amazon!!</li>
    <li> Chet Baker wore this. I&#x27;m not surprised. It&#x27;s a combination of lavender and honey that makes you feel as if you&#x27;re sitting in a European sidewalk cafe reading Le Monde. I don&#x27;t get much longevity out of this when it&#x27;s on my skin, but walking through a few mists of this in a clean white shirt will set me up for a great spring day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The difference between this and any of the Cool Water clones that have been produced since is obvious from one whiff. Everything in here smells REAL.</li>
    <li> Classic fragrance that never gets old ...</li>
    <li> Nice pack, five starts</li>
    <li> My father loves this cologne.</li>
    <li> product looks lioke and works like the Paco I had earlier. The scent  doesn&#x27;t seem to last as long as the old one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope it is not a copy</li>
    <li> When I first bought this at the store, I bought this blind, hoping it would smell great, and IT DID, EXACT scent I was looking for in a cologne, though this is way over priced in stores.  Fantastic Cologne, ladies LOVE it :)</li>
    <li> Bracing long lasting scent, quality attractive spray bottle, item as advertised.</li>
    <li> This was for my husband and is exactly what he wanted. He is happy, therefore, I am happy too!</li>
    <li> exactly what I wanted!</li>
    <li> I have always been pleased with the service I have recieved from this company.  I hope Paco Rabanne stays around for a long time.  this is the most reasonable place as far as price.
