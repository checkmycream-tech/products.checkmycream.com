<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Product is wonderful.  Some &amp;#34;health&amp;#34; salves have actually irritated skin or lips; this product is soothing and very nice.  It also hasn&#x27;t gone rancid either.  I would order this product again.  It&#x27;s a good find.</li>
    <li> this herbal salve is nice.it has taken the pain away from this rash on my neck and chest.</li>
    <li> and she uses it regularly.  not oily, definitely soothing and healing.  this salve actually feels good when you spread it on.</li>
    <li> My 4 year old daughter did a face plant with the concrete leaving her with a very nasty scrape down the entire side of her face.  We were so fearful of a bad scar that we wanted to try something that would help it heal fast and without scarring.  Someone told me about the Salve and after it scabbed I put it on her face 3 to 4 times a day and then again while she was sleeping.  Within one week of the fall the area was clear and the scab was completely gone.  She has some redness in the area but I can&#x27;t tell you how many people have said, \\&quot;I cannot believe how amazing it healed.\\&quot; I didnt use anything else on the scrape once it scabbed and I truly believe that it healed so fast and without a scar because of the Kuumba Made Salve. I really will tell everyone about this Salve and use it again and again.</li>
    <li> I love this product. I burn myself before using the produce the pain was horrible and after applying this product my burn felt so much better.</li>
    <li> Love this balm! So soothing and smells nice.</li>
    <li> The best product that I have used in a very long time. The combination of herbs used is the best ever, providing the healing that my skin desperately needed which I never got from the medication that I used over several years. I am looking forward to purchasing the larger 2oz jar.</li>
    <li> I have severely sensitive skin. I get contact dermatitis from everything- even hugging someone wearing perfume is enough to cause bumpy, red, itchy skin (not to mention a headache from the fragrance) and this stuff stops it.  The itching is calmed almost on contact and the swelling is usually gone within a half hour. It even works for hives  I have never had anything work this well in 20 years of trying.  I travel with it in case I have a reaction to the tap water or hotel detergent on the sheets. I would take a bath in it if I could.  Cannot recommend this highly enough. It&#x27;s made my life better.  If it is safe on my skin, it&#x27;s probably safe for everybody- I&#x27;ve even used it on my face and it doesn&#x27;t cause breakouts.</li>
    <li> This salve has a nice clean fragrance and does what it claims to do. I highly recommend this herbal product for all scrapes, bruises, and rashes.</li>
    <li> This offers relief for my granddaughter&#x27;s extreme eczema.  It is a bit greasy but soaks in quickly.  It also has a nice aroma.</li>
    <li> Iam still out on this one??????</li>
    <li> My son (age 5) tends to get a contact dermatitis rash on his cheek and chin at times. Things like cortisone cream make it more angry; tallow balm and probiotics help a little bit. I picked up this salve at our local organic market recently, and it worked amazingly well on the rash (without stinging). I put a tiny bit on the rash morning and night, and in two days it was gone.</li>
    <li> This works great for a variety of skin conditions, and I&#x27;ve used it with success on skin suffering from rashes-- leaves the skin far less stressed and it heals cleanly and more quickly than I&#x27;d imagined. I will always try to have some of this on hand as long as they keep making it! Get the BIG size!</li>
    <li> I use this on diaper rash, baby scrapes and boo-boos and it works SO well.  Injuries are gone overnight or by end of day.  It clears up bad diaper rash overnight, too.  I have also given it to someone undergoing radiation treatment, to help with radiation burns.  It contains a large amount of calendula and aloe, both organic, and two things recommended for radiation burns from radiation therapy.  I use this stuff on everything, and have for 10 months - I really like it!</li>
    <li> For my dark pigmentation . Frustrated using many other products ,but this one didn&#x27;t work either . May be not suitable for my problem</li>
    <li> I really LOVE this amazing salve. It is soooo soothing &amp; comforting. The smell is also nice &amp; aids in the healing feeling.&lt;br /&gt;This product was delivered so quick...within 2days!!!!</li>
    <li> I have such problematic skin between sitting at work all day (bottom skin issues), sweating hard at the gym (back and chest issues) and keratosis Pilarsis issues on my arms. I originally received this from my aunt and thought on a whim I would try to use it on these areas and it has worked wonders. My skin is so soft and smooth and the appearance of scars from my keratosis Pilarsis even faded since the first few applications of this product! I have yet to find a skin product as good as this Kuumba salve (not that I&#x27;m even looking anymore after finding it!)</li>
    <li> It is very good. I liked it.</li>
