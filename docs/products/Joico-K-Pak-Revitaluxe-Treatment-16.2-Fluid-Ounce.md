<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Timely service. Also love the product</li>
    <li> This conditioner turned out to be very watery.  The liquid had even separated from the solid and I kept having to shake it so as not to get pure liquid coming out of the pump.  Also I felt that it left a very noticeable build up behind on my hair.  I wasn&#x27;t a fan.</li>
    <li> The product arrived quickly and was damaged but the seller not only made good on my claim, he made it a gift for my inconvenience and dissatisfaction.  They have restored my faith and I will definitely use them again</li>
    <li> I love Joico, they generally have great products and this is another!  I marked one star off as I don&#x27;t enjoy the scent.  It doesn&#x27;t smell bad, just not my cup of tea.</li>
    <li> This stuff is wonderful.  Heard about this on Dr. Oz.  Made my hair look great.  Smooth not frizzy and not dry.[[ASIN:B005K0DO8A Joico K-PAK Revitaluxe Bio-Advanced Restorative Treatment (5.1 oz.)]]</li>
    <li> I have been using this product faithfully since a hair dresser on the movie set suggested it to me. I can def. tell that my hair is healthier. I still see alot of split ends that came back after I cut my hair but I don&#x27;t know if this product could help with that or not. My hair is def. healthier looking and more moisturized. It even feels a little thicker.</li>
    <li> I am OBSESSED with K Pak. I tell every single person I know to purchase this product because I can really see the difference. Every stylist I go to (and I go to a lot for work - I do TV / video work) constantly ask me if I did the Keratin treatment. It always happens and I always tell them that it&#x27;s really just K Pak at work. If you don&#x27;t want to invest in the Keratin treatment, but you want to work on your frizz, this is a cheaper alternative. I will forever have this as part of my beauty routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A hair stylist from Better TV told me about this when I was getting my hair done getting ready for a segment. I wrote it down while in the chair and haven&#x27;t looked BACK.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s good but I used once yet! But I liked it!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t feel like this really helped my hair as much as it stated it would, but It did work to an extent. I&#x27;ve honestly had better results with the using coconut oil products.</li>
    <li> Really great product.  I read some reviews where folks seemed to receive an inadequate (watery) version of this product, but the cream I receive was very thick and rich.  I have super thick, long, sometimes coarse, Caucasian hair.  My hair can often be frizzy and have way more body than I&#x27;d prefer.  Upon first use, this product made my hair smoother, softer, &amp; the body more manageable.</li>
    <li> Best treatment I&#x27;ve tried! And I am a hairstylist, so believe me I&#x27;ve tried lots... It does wonders for your hair form the first application!  YOU WILL LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> Great product at a great price. My daughter hair is treated with a brazilian straightener and this product works well with her hair. She has been using it for the past year and loves it.</li>
    <li> My wife loves this stuff and simply raves about it. When she runs low I start getting the eye - especially when I&#x27;m already ordering something from Amazon and need to bump the price a bit to get free shipping. How does she know?</li>
    <li> For such an expensive product I was very disappointed.  I used it per instructions a number of times but it did noting for me.</li>
    <li> I have always used excellent conditioners and Joico K Pak is one of the best. After washing my hair, I have left this on my hair for about 10 -15 min. then rinsed it out. It has left my high lighted bleached hair soft and manageable. This product is great for the winter months with the cold outdoors and the warm dry indoors. If you have chemically treated hair I would recommend this conditioner.</li>
    <li> The product did not do what it claimed. My hair was still very dry. I ended up buying a loriel product that was much less expensive , and did a better job .</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for probably 3 years.  I have curly, color processed hair, which means it&#x27;s dry.  This really helps condition is so it isn&#x27;t dry or frizzy.  It&#x27;s thick and goes on easily.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent hair product. My hair suffered severe damage from being bleached (tried to go white from dark brown) and this has really made a difference in the way my hair feels. It&#x27;s now silky, soft, and not that chaotic haystack on my head!</li>
    <li> This treatment makes my hair soft and shiny without being heavy or greasy!  I have been using it for almost a year now and I still love it!  A little bit goes a long way and I only use it about once a week.</li>
    <li> When I finally got the product it was very runny and liquidy,  not too happy.  Maybe old product?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dawn Driver</li>
    <li> makes your hair strong and beautiful. In dry weather it was a blessing in disguise and it penetrates very quickly.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a really good hair product and found that Joico Treatment.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s autumn now and the weather is almost always too windy and cold, so my hair needed sort of the protection. And this products does protect your hair. It&#x27;s a strong treatment, which is amazing. Leave it for not less than 10 minutes &amp; don&#x27;t put it on hair roots, because it contains unnatural ingredients (which is not bad for hair length).&lt;br /&gt;And it DOES repair hair.&lt;br /&gt;One of the best products i&#x27;ve ever tried!)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Joico KPak Revitaluxe in the past and loved it but whatever was in this big jar was not that. It looks and acts like shampoo. The Revitaluxe I&#x27;ve bought in a store was a thick creamy concoction that definitely did not lather. I&#x27;m going to try to get my money back.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product with the expectation that it would be the same as the sample product purchased with the shampoo/conditioner kit.  However, I am quite disappointed that this \\&quot;jug\\&quot; of conditioner is watery &amp; quite diluted . . . It does not even have the same consistency.</li>
    <li> My wife&#x27;s review: Don&#x27;t buy this product from here!&lt;br /&gt;I received an old product - smells funky, really stinky, like an old product, way pass due the expiration!&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve used this product before - the real deal - totally different smell and results!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m super disapointed - just wasted my money!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for a while. and am happy to find Amazon offering the large size at such a good price.  My hair sucks this stuff up instantly.  Sometimes I follow directions and rinse it out, but when it&#x27;s really dry I just leave the conditioner in, and my hair still looks great.</li>
    <li> Product was not what I expected.  I&#x27;ve used product before and the consistency was not the same.  Product is supposed to be thick and this was not.  It was runny and seemed to be diluted.  I wouldn&#x27;t order product again from here.</li>
    <li> I really didn&#x27;t see where this stuff did much. I used the whole jar to do this review and honestly I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again. I was disappointed that it wasn&#x27;t a miracle in a jar for my dry frizzy hair...I have used some better stuff that you can buy in Wal-mart. I am still holding onto the idea that maybe my hair would be worse if I didn&#x27;t use it, but nah.</li>
    <li> This is a wonder product, I have curly course hair and it helps smooth it down.  I use is 3 times a week.</li>
    <li> This product along with all the other Joico K-Pak products are amazing per my mom and she has all of them - good prices and easy delivery and it repairs hair damaged by even 40 volume peroxide left on for 1.5 hours to lighten hair 2 levels too dark.</li>
    <li> Pump didn&#x27;t work for the first few weeks then suddenly worked (in my bag of clothes) but product makes hair feel great</li>
    <li> I have used many, many conditioning treatments over the years, including other joico line.  My hair is smooth, soft and manageable.</li>
    <li> This is a really great product especially after coloring your hair. It really improves the look and feel of your hair. Highly recommended!</li>
    <li> Exactly what I needed and it smells wonderful.</li>
    <li> Awesome product! Leaves damaged hair feeling soft &amp; healthy! I have used this product for years as recommended by my hairdresser.</li>
    <li> Very good product and wonderful service from Amazon!!!!</li>
    <li> Love this product too.. this product also helped return my hair from completely damaged to soft again</li>
    <li> After my first use of this treatment I saw results.  My hair felt more moisturized and manageable.  The product was easy to apply and the price was reasonable compared to other products.  I would definitely repurchase.</li>
    <li> I apply it  ones a week and I notice my fair feels silky , shinnier .  It&#x27;s worth the price.</li>
    <li> Apparently I have enough protein in my hair and apparently if you use protein things in your hair when you have enough, you can damage your hair. Lesson learned. I&#x27;m sure it would have worked beautifully if that was my issue.</li>
    <li> Really well and creatively packaged. Arrived quickly and safely.</li>
    <li> This product is pretty amazing, indeed. As a long time fan and user of the K-Pak Reconstructor, I was very curious about this product when I saw it. Where the reconstructor is just that... just a treatment, this product adds another dimension and is more like an actual cream conditioner. Also deviates from the banana fragrance of the aforementioned product. This stuff smells AMAZING. The results are fantastic. As a colorist, I cannot recommend this product enough. Great for all hair types so long as you&#x27;ve had any chemical services performed. Luxuriantly soft, shiny, healthy looking hair every time.</li>
    <li> Previous review....I have tried EVERTHING to contain the frizz on my wavy hair: products, straightners, rollers, even a Keratin treatment.  It wasn&#x27;t until I tried the sample size of this product that I hit upon a solution. I don&#x27;t know what they put in here but it has finally solved my issue. I use it about 3X a week for the last 4 months and I&#x27;m almost halfway through. Great value, great product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE: After running out of the product , I repurchased in Oct 2012 and what I received was NOT what I got before. It was runny (like watery snot) and I had to pump 7-8X to get the same amount of conditioner out.  It doesn&#x27;t do what the last jar did either. It&#x27;s like I&#x27;m using a generic conditioner. Amazon needs to do some quality control. Not buying again!!! Bought this from Probeautyinc.</li>
    <li> I got the K-PAK Gift Set which included the mini sample of the Revitaluxe Reconstructive cream in a tube. My hair got damaged from a highlighting gone wrong! This product made my hair soft, smooth and tangle free. I just received the Big Jar (16.2 oz) &amp; will try it tomorrow. I will update this when I do. Also, The smell is Good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**UPDATE** 11/6/12 - I used the product for the first time from the jar and compared to the tube I received as a bonus in the gift set. This is Watery &amp; so I mixed it up to even it out and it had chunks after stirring it, like cottage cheese. The smell is the same as the tube. My hair is soft and smooth as expected. So I&#x27;m happy. Normally the Jar is $42 (I seen at Ulta Beauty Store) So makes me wonder if it&#x27;s a replica for $16 or just very old product, I don&#x27;t know. But it seems to work. Next time I go to the Salons, I will take a look on their jar&#x27;s consistency.  Comment if you had similar experiences &amp; have some information. Thanks.</li>
    <li> I really love this stuff, but you have to beware purchasing it on Amazon.  I have had both good and bad results.  If it comes lumpy and has a rank odor to it, it is outdated or is something else (counterfeit).  It is not sealed in plastic, so there is no way of knowing unless you have purchased it from a salon before.  I have had to contact Amazon before for a product that was well past it&#x27;s prime.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a Black woman with very long natural hair and I LOVE THIS PRODUCT!  I&#x27;ve always used K-Pak and was pleased, but this is a new level.  My hair was easily combed through, soft, and manageable.  My only complaint is they need to make it in a bigger size the same way they do with their other products!</li>
    <li> I have very damaged, color treated hair.  This is the only product that I have tried that made my hair feel and look healthy.</li>
    <li> This conditioner works well but the scent is horrible. It smells really strong and overpowering, like&lt;br /&gt;Patchouli smells overpowering. Every time that I use it my sinuses clog. I spent a lot of money&lt;br /&gt;on several hair products from Amazon and this is the first time that that I&#x27;ve had a complaint. I&#x27;ve&lt;br /&gt;used it in the past but I don&#x27;t remember it smelling like this. If you have allergies or are sensitive&lt;br /&gt;to strong smells I wouldn&#x27;t buy it.</li>
    <li> I really don&#x27;t know if Joico changed their product or what but I remember this stuff being super thick and creamy where now it&#x27;s almost like water. When I use to use this stuff my hair would just soak it all in and my hair would feel luscious and full and now when I put this in my hair it&#x27;s just dripping like what. Super bummed. I don&#x27;t know if the formula has changed or I got. Bad batch. I&#x27;m still using it but not pleased with the consistency. I hope when I order again I get what I was hoping for.</li>
    <li> everyone w hair on their head should get this,it will do wonders esp if its damaged like mine  i have  bright purple wavy tresses n they are no longer dry n frizzy</li>
    <li> This is great everyday conditioner for thick course hair. Leave on longer for more of a treatment. Does not leave hair greasy or filmy at all.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent hair repair, I noticed a huge difference my hair looks healthy and very shine, I will recomend this product specially if you have damage from coloring and relaxers.:):)</li>
    <li> Great deep conditioner for African American thick thick coarse hair.</li>
    <li> Definitely genuine product from FOREVER YOUNG BEAUTY! Super thick consistency! I&#x27;ve bought this before so I know I&#x27;ll love it like always</li>
    <li> Love it. I have colored hair and it makes it so soft and smooth. Can&#x27;t do without it. Will purchase again and again.</li>
    <li> Amazing product. The whole family uses it, so we go through it quite a bit. It&#x27;s a good size, last along time, and the price is perfect!</li>
    <li> i have only used this product twice and i can already see improvements in my hair. this product is excellent for African american hair because it is ph balanced to optimize smooth and straight hair.</li>
    <li> this products works from the first use!!!! Makes hair look like you spent hundreds at a salon for months. u will love it</li>
    <li> I bought for my sister, she has used it in hairdresser salon and she told my this is not the same product. She told me it kind of works but the smell is terrible and the consistency of the cream is not the same.</li>
    <li> This stuff has literally never made my hair feel better. In the shower I was my hair then apply this to the entire section of my hair that would go up into a ponytail, sometimes if the top feel extra rough ill apply it there too. Once Ive applied it I spin my hair up in a clamp thing and go ahead and shave everything I need to, once done rinse it all out and feel how amazing your hair feels. For extra shine and gloss you can apply your normal conditioner afterwards for a short time but dont leave it too long or your hair will look greasy &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> This is bad and the smell is horrible  very bad</li>
    <li> This is really nice for making my hair soft and shiny after a wash.</li>
    <li> My hair dresser recommended this.  It has taken by dry brittle from coloring/processing back to a very healthy state.  This is a must try!</li>
    <li> I have been using K-pak for 6 months now and only one time a week. I have been losing hair for years and only using a well know brand of hair conditioner only and no shampoo, which works for healthy hair, but I kept lossing hair. Ever time I ran my fingers through my hair 4 to 6 hairs would come out ever time I did this. I noticed after a month of using the K-pak I was not shedding as much and now the hair loss is finally back to normal; after 15 years of having problems. I rub it into my scalp then use my round plastic scalp brush to stimalate K-pak into my skin. My hair is all natural, I do not use dyes, hair dryer, or any chemicals of any kind or any products that would cause hair damage or loss. THANK YOU K-PAK for fixing my long time problem.</li>
    <li> This is a fantastic hair product! I first started using this conditioner in 2011 when I purchased  Joico&#x27;s Smooth Cure Shampoo and Conditioner. A free sample was included with my purchase. \\&quot;Wow!\\&quot;  is what I said then and \\&quot;Wow!\\&quot;  is what I still say eighteen months later. My hair was showing signs of aging. I have grays which are coarse and kinky. My hair was unruly and unmanageable. This product changed all that. Since I began using this product, my hair has been reborn. It looks so healthy and feels so smooth. When I first began using this product I used a conditioner after shampooing and then applied Joico&#x27;s K Pak Revitaluxe Treatment. I have since found I can eliminate the conditioner and just use this product.  I was originally buying [[ASIN:B005K0DO8A Joico K-PAK Revitaluxe Bio-Advanced Restorative Treatment]] in the 4-ounce tube but changed to the 16 ounce jar with pump. It is far more economical than the smaller tubes. I just love this product and would be lost without it.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t use the plunger all you will get is a watery substance.  Open the lid, stir the product and use your fingers to take out the product, otherwise it works okay, I have used it only once at this time so my review is limited, but that plunger does not work. The consistency is very bad when using it. Check back with me at a later date if you want a complete review.</li>
    <li> Works with any kind of hair and gender.&lt;br /&gt;It really rebuilds the hair from damage!&lt;br /&gt;Back up with a good sealing conditioner.</li>
    <li> If you have damaged hair, this is what you need to use. My hair was so damaged it was breaking off. I have been using it for a week and the results are amazing. I know my hair is on it&#x27;s way to growing back to the long locks I had before my processing nightmare from a bad salon job. I haven&#x27;t even had to use my hair straightener since I started using it.</li>
    <li> Have been using this for about a year. I had over processed hair that was damaged and felt like straw. After one use I could feel the difference. After two weeks of daily use, my hair was shiny, soft and on the mend.  I swear by this stuff.</li>
    <li> it was not the best product on my hair</li>
    <li> Do not leave this product on your hair for an extended period of time, i.e. 3 or more hours with plastic cap on because it will make your hair fall out!!!!!  I was sooooooo disappointed.  Could not believe someone liked this stuff!  My hair is long and extremely thick and I have used Loreal Cuti Liss Expert series in the past and Joico doesn&#x27;t compare! I need a very strong conditioner that gets tangles out.  If the people who liked this product would try Loreal Expert Cuti Liss Series you would definitely see a fantastic product!! I am a Cosmetologist at a very upscale salon and try all products I use on myself before using on my clients and would never use this on clients.  I saw it on Dr. Oz with Tabatha introducing the product.  I personally think she is getting $$$ for advertising this product on the Dr. Oz show.</li>
    <li> I saw this recommended on TV by a hairdresser to the stars.  It is great for people over 40 and people with dryer hair. I use it once a week and it keeps my hair soft and smooth. Love it!</li>
    <li> I rarely leave feedback on anything unless a product just blows me away, I always use good hair products and this one is a must and I will never be without it!  The first time I used it I could see a dramatic difference and then by the third time it was crazy great!  I have had so many people comment on how shinny an healthy my hair looks and I agree! I have fine long hair and it does not weight it down at all!  I only wash my hair every other day unless needed.  So I use it 3 times a week.I went back and already bought another one so I will have a back up and never run out!</li>
    <li> This works so well!!  My hair is super soft and shiny, and you don&#x27;t need to use a lot.  Well worth the money.</li>
    <li> Left my dry thick hair amazingly soft and shiny. It also it noticeably less frizzy and seems to have more weight to it so that it doesn&#x27;t look like an afro. I love it</li>
    <li> I had a tube of this that I loved. It was thick but this in the jar was runny and I had to keep mixing it. It is a great product but it seemed like it had been frozen.</li>
    <li> Well worth the money. Can really tell the difference. hair is so soft and healthy. You will not be sorry</li>
    <li> I have long thick course hair that is relatively healthy, but wavy. This product was watery and not very effective. It took quite a bit of the product to even come close to feeling like I was getting any kind of coverage on my hair. I will say, i personally loved the smell. After I styled my hair it did not feel or look any healthier than before. And it had a large amount of static cling, which I rarely have any issue with. My hair felt lighter and &amp;#34;fluffier&amp;#34; but I really think that is because it left my hair with so much static cling. I normally wash my hair every day, but I did not get a chance to wash it today (the second day) I still had a lot of static cling, though because of that it made it less obvious that I had not washed my hair.&lt;br /&gt;Given the density and coarseness of my hair I don&#x27;t understand how anyone with thinner and finer hair can use this product. I personally can not recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This is the best deep conditioning hair treatment I have used in a very long time! My hair is soft, shinny and tame like I have just left the hair salon.</li>
    <li> Just ask my hair-lady; I am ROUGH on my hair.  I have a (probably unhealthy) love hate relationship with my hair and express the joys and frustrations of my personal life through my hair.  I&#x27;ve died it every color, grown it long, cut it short, and repeated the entire process 100 times over.  That said, if you&#x27;re going to damage your hair the way I do, you MUST USE THIS PRODUCT.  After shampooing, then conditioning with a rinse-out conditioner (Joico Color Gaurd, I think), I towel dry my hair and rub this product in.  I don&#x27;t rinse it out.  You heard me right.  I style my hair with this product still in it.  Yes, I&#x27;m a rule-breaker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also use this product every other day, because that&#x27;s how often I wash my hair.  Again, I&#x27;ve broken the rules.  BUT, my hair is soft, smooth and lookin&#x27; good despite all the damage I&#x27;ve done to it (I want to be blonde...one month later...I want black hair....one month later....I miss being blonde....).  My hair is naturally curly, so I have the added frizz factor, and this stuff helps tame the mane!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Buy it.  It&#x27;s good stuff.  My hair is just above my shoulders and I don&#x27;t use an entire squirt.  (Just to help you save a bit o&#x27; product.) My hair drinks this up.  When I DON&#x27;T use this product, it shows.  My hair rebels and says, &amp;#34;feed meeeeee.&amp;#34;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you need a new addiction, this product would be a good choice.</li>
    <li> I love Joico to begin with but this product is &amp;#34;awesome&amp;#34; and makes my hair so beautiful.  Everything it says it will do it does and then some.  I recommend this product to anyone who is having issues from a bad perm, frizzes, dry unmanageable hair etc.  It really works, makes your hair shiny and smooth, and it smells heavenly too!!</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t tell the difference in this an the regular conditioner.  It is light and doesn&#x27;t make my hair look oily.</li>
    <li> I switched to this after Living Proof discontinued it&#x27;s Restore Serum.  It takes more product, but I think it has a similar restoring effect on my hair. And it&#x27;s WAY cheaper here on Amazon.</li>
    <li> Great price for the amount you get. Love joico products. This deep conditioner is great.</li>
    <li> The Joico K-Pak Revitaluxe definitely made my hair softer shinier and more manageable. I like the scent and it&#x27;s not too oily as I have fine hair. I shampooed with the K-Pak shampoo for color treated hair and followed with the split ends mender. I must say that using products from the same line definitely makes a difference in the outcome too, I&#x27;m hooked on Joico.</li>
    <li> It is a good product for chemically enhanced hair-instant softness and shine with this product.  Tames the hair and makes it more manageable</li>
    <li> Great product! My hair needs a lot of extra help due to color, sun, swimming pool, and heat styling ( you name it). I&#x27;ve tried many different conditioners from salon, health food store, drug store, and home-made recipes. This one brings shine and softness to my hair after just one use! It does not foam or lather but works great. I use it in place if conditioner every time I wash my hair. For extra softness and shine, apply a little shine serum from Aveda ( light blue bottle) onto toweled dried DAMP hair especially to the ends of hair.</li>
