      <li>Love the color of this lipstick.</li>
      <li>I love NYX and have always trusted their lipsticks.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s subtle, which is perfect because I don&#x27;t like bright lips.</li>
      <li>I have bought too many lipsticks to count, looking for something that would look like a true nude lip.  </li>
      <li>This levels out my lip color without making them look too light or chalky.  </li>
      <li>The lipstick goes on smoothly and is creamy.</li>
      <li>doesn&#x27;t leave a white film on your lips like most lipsticks!!</li>
      <li>I am purchasing another one because its going to go fast :)</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t dry my lips like a lot of others do, and has a good amount of pigment while still feeling light.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a nice color which is the only reason kept it.</li>
      <li>Make you lips soft, love it.</li>
      <li>Looks wonderful with gray, smoky, dramatic eyes.</li>
      <li>But it doesn&#x27;t stay on very long, I wish that it did because i like that it&#x27;s cruelty free. :]</li>
      <li>Fast shipping!</li>
      <li>So, so pretty.</li>
      <li>I mean its a great lipstick</li>
      <li>but i have to apply Large amounts for it to show up and its WAY too sparkly for my liking.</li>
      <li>Very moisturizing as well.</li>
      <li>it isn&#x27;t too much and its creamy.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s more pink</li>
      <li>I really like the color.</li>
      <li>Most are either too pink or too orange.  </li>
      <li>I really like this nude its creamy like a lipgloss but not sticky.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s more natural, but still has enough lightness to it to add some glamour.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been trying for years to find the perfect nude pink color lipstick without spending a ridiculous amount on the high named brands like mac.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t wear lipstick enough to pay $20+ for a tube especially when I&#x27;ve bought so many lipsticks and never worn them after I tried them on because the shade didn&#x27;t match the picture.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend</li>
      <li>its very nude and natural I like it</li>
      <li>But I wish it were more long lasting.</li>
      <li>Pretty colar but not enough pigment</li>
      <li>I am a very young looking 50 years old with type 3 skin type with neutral undertones but more naturally dark red / blue lips.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s long lasting and doesn&#x27;t spread out of the lip line into any fine facial creases around the mouth.</li>
      <li>The color is a little lighter than I thought it would be, but is still pretty.</li>

    <li> I am a lipstick addict! I&#x27;ve been trying for years to find the perfect nude pink color lipstick without spending a ridiculous amount on the high named brands like mac.

I feel like anyone could wear this color! it isn&#x27;t too much and its creamy. doesn&#x27;t leave a white film on your lips like most lipsticks!! so happy! I am purchasing another one because its going to go fast :)</li>
    <li> If you are looking for a nude lip, this is it.  I have bought too many lipsticks to count, looking for something that would look like a true nude lip.  Most are either too pink or too orange.  This one is perfect.  I am a very young looking 50 years old with type 3 skin type with neutral undertones but more naturally dark red / blue lips.  This levels out my lip color without making them look too light or chalky.  This is matte so you need a lip gloss if you want a little wet / shine look. I paired this with a nude lip gloss from ELF and it works perfectly.  I also used the nude lip liner from ELF and it also works perfectly.  Looks wonderful with gray, smoky, dramatic eyes.</li>
    <li> Favorite nude. Comparable to MAC&#x27;s &amp;#34;Blankety&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> A Very lovely color, it is like a nude type lipstick, and stays on all day. Over all it is great</li>
    <li> This is a really nice lipstick and has a nice “feel&amp;#34;. It doesn&#x27;t dry my lips like a lot of others do, and has a good amount of pigment while still feeling light. The color is a little lighter than I thought it would be, but is still pretty. Even has a nice scent!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a nude like this for sooo long.  I don&#x27;t wear lipstick enough to pay $20+ for a tube especially when I&#x27;ve bought so many lipsticks and never worn them after I tried them on because the shade didn&#x27;t match the picture. I really like this nude its creamy like a lipgloss but not sticky. It&#x27;s got a little shine to it but not glittery and it&#x27;s more pink based but not too pink so that it looks like a little girls play make up. I haven&#x27;t worn it a lot (like I said I only wear lipstick every once in awhile) so I&#x27;m not sure about how well it stays on but for $5 I mean its a great lipstick</li>
    <li> This product covered wonderfully, with no greasy feeling. It also came immediately.  Long before the promised date. I will purchase the extra creamy round again and again.</li>
    <li> I love the color of this lipstick. But I wish it were more long lasting. You have to re-do ur lips quite often!</li>
    <li> I love NYX and have always trusted their lipsticks. I am a matte fan but this was awesome buy. Love this one! Great alternative to nude, which I wear often.</li>
    <li> Love the color of this lipstick. It&#x27;s subtle, which is perfect because I don&#x27;t like bright lips.</li>
    <li> Too shear doesn&#x27;t last. I also found it drying.</li>
    <li> HATED this lipstick, it came melted and i ordered it in the winter. also it took WAY longer than 8-10 days to get here. also i tried to freeze it and use it but i have to apply Large amounts for it to show up and its WAY too sparkly for my liking.</li>
    <li> So, so pretty. Highly recommend</li>
    <li> I was looking for a nice nude color and could not find any I enjoyed.. Until I found this! Not only is NYX a great brand, this color is perfect. It looks good with any skin tone and is very easy to apply. I find myself only applying it occasionally. I buy lots of these.</li>
    <li> Not a matte lipstick, kind of shiny. I wasn&#x27;t impressed</li>
