      <li>I love the way my hair stays</li>
      <li>but I heard it works better when combined with Kerafuse</li>
      <li>Or, you may require more moisture, or more strength.  </li>

      <li>I&#x27;ve never seen my hair look so healthy.</li>

      <li>im glad it&#x27;s worked for others... will not repurchase..</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using this product for years because I love what it does for my hair.  </li>
      <li>Just make sure you read all of the directions and apply correctly.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried it in so many ways but nothing has changed...</li>
      <li>My hair has a great natural shine and feels so much better.  </li>
      <li>I strongly recommend.  </li>
      <li>I stay with the Mizani line of products because as a black relaxed woman i feel that they work best on my 4b hair type.</li>
      <li>I love this product it delivered exactly what it promises!</li>
      <li>It smells fantastic.</li>
      <li>It moisturizes my hair keeps it from breaking and shedding and also makes my hair really smooth.</li>
      <li>This product works great alone and especially with Mizani&#x27;s protein treatment.  </li>
      <li>my shampoo left my hair softer and more manageable!!</li>
      <li>I know everyone swears up and down that this product works great when combined with the kerafuse product however the hydrafuse worked better alone for my hair.</li>
      <li>Was so excited to try this.</li>
      <li>this is definitely worth it!</li>
      <li>I have used the Hydrafuse once when I first purchased and it was okay</li>
      <li>Really great product for very dry hair.</li>
      <li>use wisely and it could last up to a year!</li>
      <li>My hair is much stronger and I am glad I did purchase it.</li>

      <li>It really moisturizes my hair!!</li>
      <li>When I use the hydrafuse alone, my hair feels light and looks VERY glossy.</li>
      <li>let me tell you this stuff is so well worth the price.  </li>
      <li>Others reference the Mizani Consultation Sheet and the Mizani Custom Blend Wheel to assist you with the mixing, but we weren&#x27;t able to obtain these items since we aren&#x27;t professional hair stylists, so we searched the web and found how to mix it..</li>
      <li>and i love the other MIZANI products and suspected that i&#x27;d love this one.</li>
      <li>Honestly, this did NOTHING GOOD for my hair but make it hard!!</li>
      <li>and this was my first time using the Kerafuse along with the Hyrafuse.</li>
      <li>It is intense and it works!  </li>
      <li>WOW!!!!</li>
      <li>But I would suggest to be very well aware of your hair</li>
      <li>After I rinse it out , I can comb through my tightly coiled hair much better than after a quick 5 minute rinse out conditioner alone.</li>
      <li>I need to remember/continue to buy from this seller because their products smelt and looked fresh and new.  </li>
      <li>We will certainly order it again.  </li>
      <li>How much you use will depend on your hair damage.  </li>
      <li>Thanks.</li>
      <li>I ordered this, along with Mizani&#x27;s Kerafuse Intense Strengthening Treatment, to treat my daughter&#x27;s hair.  </li>
      <li>really work even when the condition is in your hair</li>
      <li>Because of its price, I don&#x27;t use Hydrafuse very often (about every 2 months)</li>
      <li>/&gt;Rinse product out with cool to luke  warm water not hot then blow dry and style as usual.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Not for everday use, but when your hair&#x27;s thirst need quenching, leaving this rich hydrating conditioner in all day or overnight will bring your curls back to life!</li>
      <li>Hair is left strong yet soft and manageable!</li>
      <li>I am using it once a week, and I add a teaspoon of high quality olive oil.</li>
      <li>highly recommend saving your money and shopping another product.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t believe how soft my hair was!!</li>
      <li>The combination (also referred to as Custom Blend) of the two products brought new life to her</li>
      <li>I gave this rating because I really love how this product moisturized my hair and made it very soft, would definitely recommend this to other people who may be on the fence about it.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s best for ethnic hair (i.e. course, thick, tight, spiral, curls); I would not recommend for fine or thin hair.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m an African American female with natural hair &amp; it&#x27;s REALLY fine when straighthened.</li>
      <li>i&#x27;ve just gotten into the MIZANI hair products, as i&#x27;ve just returned to a natural state of being for my locks.</li>
      <li>My hair hasn&#x27;t been this soft since I was a child</li>
      <li>I have naturally curly hair, if I were to label it i would say it&#x27;s in between a 4a and 4b.</li>
      <li>They&#x27;ll be soft and springy again.</li>
      <li>I mix it with the Kerafuse Intense treatment for deep conditioning.</li>
      <li>Her hair was deeply moisturized and really strengthened.  </li>
      <li>It provide intense treatment and moisture especially during the winter months when your hair is its driest.  </li>
      <li>it is soft and silky.</li>

      <li>This moisturizer is thick, rich, creamy, and smells fruity.</li>
      <li>I have only used this product once since purchase but wild it has left my hair so silky and bouncy</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve also noticed my hair is shedding a whole lot less.</li>
      <li>The products I had ordered from other sellers no longer had the normal scent and color.</li>

<li> /&gt;Excellent product for dry and or damaged hair puts moisture back in hair.</li>
<li> so a bottle truly lasts me a long time.  </li>

<li> I don&#x27;t need any other product added to my wet hair after applying it.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> really work even when the condition is in your hair it is soft and silky. It is a great product</li>
    <li> This product works great alone and especially with Mizani&#x27;s protein treatment.  Have used it for quite a while and never been disappointed.</li>
    <li> I use this in conjunction with Affirm 5 in 1.  It is a great moisturizer.  After applying Mizani and also 5 in 1,  cover your head with foil and a plastic cap or use heat.  It works, trust me on that. It is expensive, but it will last a few months, even with weekly usage.</li>
    <li> I ordered this, along with Mizani&#x27;s Kerafuse Intense Strengthening Treatment, to treat my daughter&#x27;s hair.  It was breaking AND coming out at the root. No one could figure out the cause, so this was suggested.  After being treated with this mixture in a salon and it&#x27;s immediate results, we decided to purchase some since she would require additional treatments. OMG does it work!!!!  The breakage stopped immediately and nor was the hair coming out at the root any longer.  Her hair was deeply moisturized and really strengthened.  The combination (also referred to as Custom Blend) of the two products brought new life to her hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We used a equal amount ratio 4:4 (four small scoops of each product) to cover her head. How much you use will depend on your hair damage.  You may need equal parts of each product, like my daughter.  Or, you may require more moisture, or more strength.  Whatever the need is, add the correct product accordingly.  Others reference the Mizani Consultation Sheet and the Mizani Custom Blend Wheel to assist you with the mixing, but we weren&#x27;t able to obtain these items since we aren&#x27;t professional hair stylists, so we searched the web and found how to mix it.. You sit under a warm dryer with a plastic cap on for 10 minutes and believe it or not, 10 minutes is all it takes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is a wonderful product and I&#x27;m certain it&#x27;s also great when used alone. Just make sure you read all of the directions and apply correctly.  We will certainly order it again.  Great Mizani products!!!</li>
    <li> Mizani Never Fails! I love this product it delivered exactly what it promises! Hair is left strong yet soft and manageable!</li>
    <li> Really great product for very dry hair. Works especially well if you leave product on hair for thirty minutes, cover hair with plastic shower cap with product in hair while sitting under the dryer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rinse product out with cool to luke  warm water not hot then blow dry and style as usual.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Excellent product for dry and or damaged hair puts moisture back in hair.</li>
    <li> mix with kerafuse a great conditioning</li>
    <li> I know everyone swears up and down that this product works great when combined with the kerafuse product however the hydrafuse worked better alone for my hair. When the two are paired together, my hair is heavier and it tends to have that stringy look. When I use the hydrafuse alone, my hair feels light and looks VERY glossy. I absolutely love the gloss look that it gives my hair. I&#x27;ve never seen my hair look so healthy. So don&#x27;t think that you have to pair the two together to get great results.</li>
    <li> I love the way my hair stays so soft.&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t take a lot of time and it makes styling my hair a pleasure.</li>
    <li> Love this product.  It helps repair my damaged hair.  Thanks.</li>
    <li> Mizani&#x27;s Hydrafuse is the most expensive conditioner I have ever bought for my hair care regiment but let me tell you this stuff is so well worth the price.  It is intense and it works!  Because of its price, I don&#x27;t use Hydrafuse very often (about every 2 months) so a bottle truly lasts me a long time.  I use it when I want a really deep and intensive moisturizing treatment on my semi-permanent color treated natural hair.  I tend to Hydrafuse alone or sometimes I will add a few drops of oil (Keracare&#x27;s Essential Oils, Mizani Supreme Oil, or Jojoba Oil) to it, place a plastic cap on my head, sit under the heat cap for 20-25 minutes.  Rinse, style and sit back and go &amp;#34;ahh&amp;#34;.  This is an excellent product for restoring moisture, strength, and superior sheen to dry, damaged, color treated or chemically treated hair.</li>
    <li> I received the other two products that i purchased apart fron this one. Why? Kindly give me feedback. Thanks&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Teresa</li>
    <li> The was recommened to me by my hair stylist. She mixes it with Mizani Kerafuse for a deep conditioning treatment on my relaxed hair.</li>
    <li> love this product!! use wisely and it could last up to a year! I recommend getting the kerafuse, works like magic together!!</li>
    <li> Love it!! My hair has a great natural shine and feels so much better.  My hair is much stronger and I am glad I did purchase it. The only problem, the container is not seal. I thought that was odd but I haven&#x27;t had any problems with it.</li>
    <li> I have only used this product once since purchase but wild it has left my hair so silky and bouncy</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years because I love what it does for my hair.  I mix it with the Kerafuse Intense treatment for deep conditioning. I need to remember/continue to buy from this seller because their products smelt and looked fresh and new.  The products I had ordered from other sellers no longer had the normal scent and color.</li>
    <li> Love this conditioner</li>
    <li> i&#x27;ve just gotten into the MIZANI hair products, as i&#x27;ve just returned to a natural state of being for my locks. and i love the other MIZANI products and suspected that i&#x27;d love this one. NOT! after using this moisturizer once, i will NOT be using it again. it made no difference at all on my hair. my shampoo left my hair softer and more manageable!! now, it may be that this was a dud supply, but i&#x27;m definitely going to stay with organic root stimulator olive oil&#x27;s reconstructing moisturizer. MUCH better results, DEPENDABLE results. if fact - i&#x27;m wondering why i left it at all?</li>
    <li> Anything Mizani has my vote!  This product is no exception.  It provide intense treatment and moisture especially during the winter months when your hair is its driest.  Repeat purchase!</li>
    <li> I LOVE this moisturizing conditioner!! Left my hair feeling like silk!!! I will be purchasing the Kerafuse protein treatment to blend with this, so i can use this as a moisturizing deep conditioner or with the protein treatment, so the protein does not harden my hair. The two together, I&#x27;m sure will be a perfect combination for strong, healthy hair. I&#x27;m all about that!!</li>
    <li> I just cant say enough about this product! It moisturizes my hair keeps it from breaking and shedding and also makes my hair really smooth. I use it with milk bath shampoo. I stay with the Mizani line of products because as a black relaxed woman i feel that they work best on my 4b hair type. Another tip i can give you is to find a good hair stylist because that will make the difference in how your hair reacts to these products.</li>
    <li> I gave this rating because I really love how this product moisturized my hair and made it very soft, would definitely recommend this to other people who may be on the fence about it.</li>
    <li> I give myself a protein treatment every six weeks and this was my first time using the Kerafuse along with the Hyrafuse. I have used the Hydrafuse once when I first purchased and it was okay but I heard it works better when combined with Kerafuse so I prepooed overnight, rinsed, shampooed with my aussie moist shampoo and then I applied my mixture(1 part Kerafuse and 2 parts Hydrafuse) for about 45 minutes with my heat cap and then rinsed out.  WOW!!!! I can&#x27;t believe how soft my hair was!! It was so soft and shiny and it looked great!  This will definitley be my go to mixture for my protein treatments from now on! This was one of if not the best hair wash day I have ever had!</li>
    <li> I am using it once a week, and I add a teaspoon of high quality olive oil. It smells fantastic.</li>
    <li> Very good. It last long</li>
    <li> I have been natural for a year with about a 3 inch afro that I usually get straightened with a blow dryer.  I use a thermal cap with this product. After I rinse it out , I can comb through my tightly coiled hair much better than after a quick 5 minute rinse out conditioner alone. This moisturizer is thick, rich, creamy, and smells fruity.</li>
    <li> This product combined with the intensive protein treatment really made a difference in my color treated, dry, frizzy, hair. Very pleased.</li>
    <li> This is so thick and creamy! I don&#x27;t feel like I am combing through dry hair after using this !</li>
    <li> Not for everday use, but when your hair&#x27;s thirst need quenching, leaving this rich hydrating conditioner in all day or overnight will bring your curls back to life! They&#x27;ll be soft and springy again. It&#x27;s best for ethnic hair (i.e. course, thick, tight, spiral, curls); I would not recommend for fine or thin hair.</li>
    <li> Was so excited to try this. But not impressed. It doesn&#x27;t soften my hair at all.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m an African American female with natural hair &amp; it&#x27;s REALLY fine when straighthened. I LOOOOOVE THIS CONDITIONER!!! It really moisturizes my hair!! I sat under a hair dryer for 30mins and the results were mind blowing!! I&#x27;ve also noticed my hair is shedding a whole lot less. I definitely would recommend this product. It&#x27;s a little on the expensive side compared to other products I&#x27;ve bought in the past, but like the saying goes &amp;#34;you get what you pay for&amp;#34;....this is definitely worth it!</li>
    <li> This product works wonders! My hair stopped breaking since I started using it with kerafuse. I don&#x27;t need any other product added to my wet hair after applying it. When dried my hair has body, strength and holds the curls. But I would suggest to be very well aware of your hair needs before using it and do not use anything else along with this treatment as it might just break the hair.</li>
    <li> I have naturally curly hair, if I were to label it i would say it&#x27;s in between a 4a and 4b. I felt instant moisture when I used this Conditioner and I didn&#x27;t even use it as directed (under a dryer).  My hair hasn&#x27;t been this soft since I was a child and I love it!</li>
    <li> So I just purchased the Affirm 5 in 1 Reconstructor for my daughter who has a relaxer and her hair sheds quite a bit and she has some breakage. From the reviews this seems like just the thing I need. It also sounds like I could be mixing this with the 5 in 1. I have the Humecto Conditioner now. Does anyone know if that will work just the same?</li>
    <li> Honestly, this did NOTHING GOOD for my hair but make it hard!! I&#x27;ve tried it in so many ways but nothing has changed... i got it because of its raved review, but didnt work for at all, but im glad it&#x27;s worked for others... will not repurchase..but the shipping was prompt..</li>
    <li> Having completely different experiences using this from the Mizani products I&#x27;ve used in the past. I wonder if this is licensed at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend saving your money and shopping another product.</li>
    <li> This with kerafuse is amazing.  No longer suffer hair breakage and silky soft to the touch.  I strongly recommend.  This will last a long time as well.</li>
