      <li>and it&#x27;s easy to use!</li>
      <li>The teeth whitener kit was similar, coming in an attractive bag with all the items arranged inside it - great 1st impression.</li>

      <li>I absolutely love this product.</li>
      <li>I have plenty more for more treatments.</li>
      <li>All of us aspire to have this in our lives &amp; many of us do what we can to get this.</li>
      <li>This is my favorite teeth whitening.  </li>
      <li>I just bought the refill kit of 8 syringes to whiten a bit more to my liking.</li>
      <li>Having been a dental hygienist for over 16 years, I have had many experiences with teeth whitening.  </li>
      <li>Nova White is the best whitening product on the market.  </li>
      <li>This kit by NovaWhite is a wonderful portable option for when one wants to beautify their smile without having to visit the dentist.</li>
      <li>When we see a beautiful smile we equate that to beauty &amp; success.</li>
      <li>This product is very easy to use and produces fantastic results.  </li>
      <li>NOVAWhite is a great alternative to professional in office bleaching.  </li>
      <li>I am so thankful that the pain never came and I was able to comfortably whiten my teeth.</li>
      <li>This is not my first time trying a teeth whitening kit, but this one is a much better quality and a much more comprehensive kit than most that you would get in a drug store.  </li>
      <li>I am sooo happy I was able to get this Nova White teeth whitening kit.</li>
      <li>but the instructions are easy to understand and easily done.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;I was super excited when I saw this kit!</li>
      <li>I receive is product on a discount or free fore reviewing purposes</li>
      <li>Eligible for Free Shipping Amazon Customer Service 24 x 7 Track your delivery to your door</li>
      <li>I noticed a significant difference in the color of my teeth after only a couple uses which was great but</li>
      <li>The trays are easy to mold, but make sure you pay attention to the directions as they can easily shrink in the hot water; luckily, they send three trays, I assume just as an &#x27;oops&#x27; precaution.</li>
      <li>NOVA White is amazing!</li>
      <li>I received three trays which was perfect because I messed up the first time trying to mold it to my oddly shaped</li>
      <li>The instructions might scare you at first because it seems like a lot of steps, but this kit is beyond easy.</li>
      <li>the water was boiling the molding process was quick</li>
      <li>I like this kit very much!  </li>
      <li>IN THE USA in a state of the art FDA registered facility - NovaWhite formulates the most effective teeth whitening products on the market - NovaWhite products work &amp; they work extremely well -</li>
      <li>This allows the mold to fit exactly to your mouth.</li>
      <li>and I found the wash cloth to also be super useful as well.</li>
      <li>I had no problems fitting the trays in my mouth, but they are a little large for me, a smaller size might have worked better, but I&#x27;m sure the size in the box is aimed at fitting most of the population.  </li>
      <li>The fact that you mold the trays to your own teeth makes this all the better, no trays sliding all over your mouth or slipping off!!</li>
      <li>I instantly fell in love with this one!</li>
      <li>so I wonder if the gel is old or not as potent as it should be.</li>
      <li>Too early to tell if it&#x27;s outstanding or not.</li>
      <li>Even tried whitening at the dentist which was too powerful resulting in teeth/gum sensitivity.  </li>
      <li>The Nova White teeth whitening kit will be a repeat purchase for sure.&lt;br /&gt;**I received this product at a reduced price in return for an honest review.</li>
      <li>I was asked to give an honest review of this product for a discounted price, I definitely recommend trying this product out.</li>
      <li>NOVAWhite is the best I&#x27;ve experienced, you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
      <li>YOU GET A NICE BRIGHT SMILE for such a little price and a bit of your time.</li>
      <li>It looked super simple &amp; easy to follow</li>
      <li>Once you have done it the first time then the hard part is done and woooo’weee nice bright white teeth!</li>
      <li>My teeth look better after several uses and have no increased</li>
      <li>This is the first at-home whitening kit I have tried (besides samples of the name-brand strips that never stuck to my teeth).</li>
      <li>My first couple of times using this</li>
      <li>was only able to leave it on for about 45 mins</li>
      <li>Definitely like this better than the strips.</li>
      <li>I seen results after my first use and look forward to the end result.</li>
      <li>The plastic teeth molds were cool,though i messed mine up by getting them too hot.</li>
      <li>but it looked so much better compared to before especially because I drink a lot of coffee.</li>
      <li>22% carbamide bleaching gel that NOVAWhite provides, is the same formula most dental offices use, but at a much affordable price.  </li>
      <li>The first time was about a week ago and my experience has been very pleasing.</li>
      <li>The first time I used the trays I used too much of the whitening gel and it oozed out of the trays - rookie mistake.</li>
      <li>The difference in my teeth color was very noticeable the first time.</li>
      <li>The molds are easy to make - dip into boiling water for 5-10 seconds, place into mouth and press against teeth and voila - you have a custom mold for upper and lower.  </li>
      <li>Was provided this product for a discounted rate for my honest opinion and I hands down highly recommend this product!</li>
      <li>This kit comes with so much to offer.</li>
      <li>and I highly recommend this product!</li>
      <li>The whitening product itself works very well.</li>
      <li>all comes in a really nice little zipper bag, I was actually happily surprised at the quality of the bag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It includes top and bottom moldable mouth trays, four tubes of 22% Carbamide Peroxide Gel, road case for mouth trays, a hand towel, breath spray, lip gloss and a carrying bag.&lt;br /&gt;CLINICAL STRENGTH 22% carbamide peroxide for your teeth + peppermint oil for a slight minty flavor - our #1 customer is</li>
      <li>Highly recommended.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have used the white strips for awhile  and never had much luck  so I wasnt holding my breath for this one  but I was offered it for a cheaper price to review it so i figured why not,?  after day 2,  I&#x27;d say 3 shades lighter!  it was a noticed difference by my husband even.&lt;br /&gt;the directions were very simple&lt;br /&gt;they followed up with a helpful email which was nice&lt;br /&gt;it worked!&lt;br /&gt;the lip gloss is really nice</li>
    <li> Received this last night and used it! Works better than paying the dentist tons of $$! I will admit to being very skeptical. I have tried several different kinds of &amp;#34;paint-on&amp;#34; whiteners, numerous brands of whitening toothpaste and strips that stick to teeth. I saw little to no improvement no matter how long I used them. The instructions might scare you at first because it seems like a lot of steps, but this kit is beyond easy. Simply take a few moments and follow the directions to mold the teeth trays to your teeth for a custom fit that will ensure the whitening gel stays where it is supposed to and then every time you use it after that it is a breeze. Once you have done it the first time then the hard part is done and woooo’weee nice bright white teeth!</li>
    <li> My wife got this for her sister&#x27;s wedding and it did as described.  It removed stains from coffee and soda and made her teeth very white. I would recommend this product to everyone.</li>
    <li> One of the BEST teeth whitening products I have used! Very easy-to-follow directions and great results! A must buy!</li>
    <li> I am sooo happy I was able to get this Nova White teeth whitening kit. I am an avid tea drinker (at least 3 cups a day) and though I brush my teeth at least twice a day I still have stains. I used this Nova White whitening system twice, thirty minutes two days in a row.  I can tell a big difference, my teeth are whiter and brighter. It was so easy to use, you just simply drop the tooth tray in boiling water for maybe 10 seconds then place it in your mouth and bite down. This allows the mold to fit exactly to your mouth. Then you remove the tray and apply a little drop of whitener to each tooth spot. Put it back in your mouth and set a timer. YOU GET A NICE BRIGHT SMILE for such a little price and a bit of your time. The Nova White teeth whitening kit will be a repeat purchase for sure.&lt;br /&gt;**I received this product at a reduced price in return for an honest review. My review is based on my own experience with the teeth whitening kit.</li>
    <li> Going to love this product</li>
    <li> This doesn&#x27;t work at all!!</li>
    <li> Excellent whitening product in my opinion.  I&#x27;ve tried everything that can be bought at Walgreens and Target including Crest White Strips.  Even tried whitening at the dentist which was too powerful resulting in teeth/gum sensitivity.  Nova White is the best whitening product on the market.  The molds are easy to make - dip into boiling water for 5-10 seconds, place into mouth and press against teeth and voila - you have a custom mold for upper and lower.  The 8 syringes are enough for 8 days of treatment.  1 syringe for one upper and one lower.  After 8 days, my teeth were noticeably whiter.  I experienced no gum or teeth sensitivity from using this product.  I just bought the refill kit of 8 syringes to whiten a bit more to my liking.</li>
    <li> The trays were hard to fit properly and the results were very minimal.</li>
    <li> I write this while applying the novawhite gel on my teeth for the second time. The first time was about a week ago and my experience has been very pleasing. The difference in my teeth color was very noticeable the first time. My smile wasn&#x27;t absolutely white but it looked so much better compared to before especially because I drink a lot of coffee. Also, using the gel for 1 hour was enough for me and getting the trays ready took no time (once the water boiled).</li>
    <li> I have use a lot of different and expensive whitening out there and this one is the only one that really works. First time i tried it left it for only 1 hour and my teeth looks whiter than before . Its a lot cheaper too than the stuff out there</li>
    <li> This product works great! Even better than what my dentist sells! Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t used a teeth whitening kit in a couple years because I felt that my last few experiences weren&#x27;t very good, they were expensive and would make my teeth hurt so bad I wouldn&#x27;t want to even finish. NOVA White is amazing! I noticed a significant difference in the color of my teeth after only a couple uses which was great but the most impressive part is that I have experienced ZERO PAIN. My first couple of times using this I was anxious about when I would feel that &amp;#34;lighting bolt&amp;#34; of pain shoot through my teeth. I am so thankful that the pain never came and I was able to comfortably whiten my teeth. I will be a lifetime user of NOVA White and I highly recommend this product!</li>

Eligible for Free Shipping Amazon Customer Service 24 x 7 Track your delivery to your door&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was super excited when I saw this kit! It looked super simple &amp; easy to follow plus it&#x27;s complete. You literally can protect your lips while whitening, something that people often forget to do. You have enough gel for a few applications also. The mouth freshening spray is a nice touch also. The storage case for your trays are really nice as well because if you decide to take the kit on the road. The handy storage pouch is nice too. The results I achieved are really great. The process could not be any easier either! It&#x27;s so great! As a blogger I received a complementary sample of this product in exchange for my honest &amp; unbiased opinion. All thoughts &amp; opinions are mine &amp; mine alone.</li>
    <li> This kit comes with so much to offer. I received three trays which was perfect because I messed up the first time trying to mold it to my oddly shaped teeth.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a nice touch that it comes with lip balm and breath spray and I found the wash cloth to also be super useful as well. When using the trays you can&#x27;t help but to drool a little and the white towel comes in handy to keep you from dripping the solution filled drool onto your clothing.&lt;br /&gt;(sorry no elegant way to say you are going to drool like a hungry dog smelling freshly cooked bacon)&lt;br /&gt;It all comes in a really nice little zipper bag, I was actually happily surprised at the quality of the bag.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;once the water was boiling the molding process was quick and they formed well to my teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was only able to leave it on for about 45 mins but I did see a noticeable difference in the whiteness at the base of teeth right before my gum line. I have plenty more for more treatments. I only needed 1/2 a tube and even that was too much.</li>
    <li> I purchased this item at a discounted rate in exchange for my unbiased review.  I like this kit very much!  This is not my first time trying a teeth whitening kit, but this one is a much better quality and a much more comprehensive kit than most that you would get in a drug store.  It comes with trays that you boil and then form to your teeth (which aren&#x27;t as good quality as the custom molds you&#x27;d receive from your dentist, but still very good nonetheless), four tubes of whitening gel, a case for your molds (which is HUGE as most don&#x27;t have a case) and everything comes in a nice carrying case.  Product works well and results have been seen within a week.  I have custom molds that I use with the gel, but I use the trays that came with this kit as a nighttime mouth guard.  If you&#x27;re looking for a good teeth whitening kit, this one is a great value!</li>
    <li> This is my favorite teeth whitening.  My dentist charges $500 for the same stuff.  I have sensitive teeth and this was great for me.  Definitely like this better than the strips.</li>
    <li> I have used whitners before but this one is the best for the price. I gave it a four because of the molds for the teeth. I followed instructions to the  &amp;#34;T&amp;#34; and they did not form that well. The whitening product itself works very well.</li>
    <li> Really love this product!! It&#x27;s just like a retainer and it&#x27;s easy to use! I&#x27;ve gone to the dentist for whitening but I was never satisfied and I heard about this product so decided to try it out, and I don&#x27;t regret it !!</li>
    <li> The trays are generic; I wasn&#x27;t expecting that.  The whitener is very good.</li>
    <li> Wow, what a great kit!! This comes with everything you need I finally got to try this today. This is the first at-home whitening kit I have tried (besides samples of the name-brand strips that never stuck to my teeth). I had no problems fitting the trays in my mouth, but they are a little large for me, a smaller size might have worked better, but I&#x27;m sure the size in the box is aimed at fitting most of the population.  I receive is product on a discount or free fore reviewing purposes</li>
    <li> Whitens as advertised Thank You</li>
    <li> Too easy to mess up mouth/teeth molds.</li>
    <li> This is one the best whitening kits I have come across.  The trays are easy to mold, but make sure you pay attention to the directions as they can easily shrink in the hot water; luckily, they send three trays, I assume just as an &#x27;oops&#x27; precaution.</li>
    <li> Having been a dental hygienist for over 16 years, I have had many experiences with teeth whitening.  NOVAWhite is a great alternative to professional in office bleaching.  22% carbamide bleaching gel that NOVAWhite provides, is the same formula most dental offices use, but at a much affordable price.  The packaging is great, and includes a minty breath spray &amp; lip balm!  NOVAWhite is the best I&#x27;ve experienced, you won&#x27;t be disappointed!</li>
    <li> The NOVAWhite kit created a great customer service experience from the start. When I purchased my first Apple iPod, it was like opening a present when it arrived - carefully placed in a elegant but simple box. The teeth whitener kit was similar, coming in an attractive bag with all the items arranged inside it - great 1st impression. I was concerned about having to mold the teeth trays. For me, this is the only reason to see a dentist - they mold the trays for you, but charge 10X the price for all the same stuff. So, to save the money, I decided to give it a go. The trays really are &amp;#34;boil and bite&amp;#34; - just a few seconds in hot water and then bite down on them to make impressions. It was a lot easier than I expected. The first time I used the trays I used too much of the whitening gel and it oozed out of the trays - rookie mistake. It comes with more gel than I would ever use - only a little is needed. I didn&#x27;t have any tooth sensitivity to the gel and I have whiter teeth. It worked just as it claims - all without wasting time or $ at the dentist.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used three of the four syringes so far and have not seen much of a difference in the whiteness of my teeth. I&#x27;ve also not experienced sensitivity like I have with other products so I wonder if the gel is old or not as potent as it should be. Pretty disappointed so far.</li>
    <li> Did nothing for my teeth. The plastic teeth molds were cool,though i messed mine up by getting them too hot. Didnt come as shown.  Saliva mixes w the gel and becomes inafective.  Waste of money!</li>
    <li> FINALLY a teeth whitening kit that WORKS! I&#x27;ve tried several other teeth whitening kits before. I have even tried one from my dentist and must say none of them have performed as well as NOVAWhite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The kit is well packaged and makes it convenient for taking on road trips. The boil trays work perfectly and molded to my mouth on the first try. After only several uses my teeth were a few shades whiter! I am not sure what is perfect about 22% Carbamide Peroxide, but it is great. My teeth look better after several uses and have no increased sensitivity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m not wasting my time or money on the more expensive systems anymore. NOVAWhite works.</li>
    <li> Great! My teeth are at least 5 shades lighter!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product. I am skeptical of teeth whitening but after reading the reviews I thought I would give it a chance and I am so glad I did! I wish I would have taken before and after pictures. I am beyond happy with the results and will DEFINATELY be ordering again.</li>
    <li> Too early to tell if it&#x27;s outstanding or not. I&#x27;ll say it seems to help, but I&#x27;ll have to try a second set (refill) to tell.</li>
    <li> I just began using NovaWhite and it is easily the best teeth whitening option out there.  I&#x27;ve tried many other products, but none left my teeth as white or as clean-feeling as NovaWhite.</li>
    <li> This product is very easy to use and produces fantastic results.  The fact that you mold the trays to your own teeth makes this all the better, no trays sliding all over your mouth or slipping off!! As someone who has very sensitive teeth, this product did not aggravate that like a lot of teeth whitening products do.  Not harsh at all. I seen results after my first use and look forward to the end result. No horrible after taste and the effectiveness of this product make it a great option when looking into a teeth whitening system! Was provided this product for a discounted rate for my honest opinion and I hands down highly recommend this product! Service is outstanding!</li>
    <li> I definitely needed a teeth whitening kit that worked and did not have the time or money to go to the dentist.  I was so impressed when I received this kit, so much in the kit for your money!  The kit includes 3 teeth trays &amp; a case to put them in, Lip balm, Breath spray, 4 tubes of whitening gel (enough for at least 4 treatments), Wash rag and a little bag to keep it all in.  I was a little apprehensive with the mouth trays, etc. but the instructions are easy to understand and easily done.  I do not know when I would have 1 to 3 hours to leave the trays in, but so far with leaving them in for about 15 minutes have yielded some results.  I am going to attempt to leave the tray in for a long period of time during my next use, some time when I have no calls to be on, etc.  I am excited to get the results after 4 tries and will update my review.  I was asked to give an honest review of this product for a discounted price, I definitely recommend trying this product out.</li>
