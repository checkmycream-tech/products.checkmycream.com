      <li>; color was good though.</li>

      <li>I have been using this for so many years!</li>
      <li>so that was hella nice.</li>

      <li>Cons: -Kind of has a heavy/thick feel to it.</li>
      <li>I even received a compliment today that someone liked my makeup</li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall, it&#x27;s great for your full coverage needs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re looking for a truly pale shade, this is perfect for the fair maidens and Goth goddesses!</li>
      <li>The texture is good, and the finish is somewhere between matte and a light dewy look.  </li>
      <li>Out of all the foundations i&#x27;ve used since i started wearing make-up at age 12, this is by far the best foundation i&#x27;ve ever used.</li>

      <li>I would not purchase this again for myself, but I know a lot of people with oily skin who love love love this product!</li>
      <li>makes my skin look lights and bright, still might need a good concealer to go along with it so its mainly meant for foundation, skin feels pretyy oily at the end of the day though</li>
      <li>/&gt;It was a good color match, and it may work well on super oily skin, so that&#x27;s why I gave it two stars.</li>
      <li>This is the best full coverage foundation I&#x27;ve found that isn&#x27;t high $$.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Seriously, I&#x27;m so in love.  </li>
      <li>I will be glad to wear this to work.  </li>
      <li>This is one of my favorite products of all time -- a &amp;#34;holy grail&amp;#34; product if you</li>
      <li>The sand beige shade is a PERFECT match and not even Urban Decay or tarte can compare.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s definitely my favorite liquid foundation.</li>
      <li>/&gt;This is one of my favorite foundation</li>
      <li>all in all, very awesome foundation, would totally recommend it.</li>
      <li>Better than some of the others I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
      <li>This makeup makes me see better.  </li>
      <li>OMG, I&#x27;m in love with this foundation.</li>
      <li>That should be one of their selling points; Revlon ColorStay: You&#x27;ll be able to see like</li>
      <li>This is the most reliable foundation product out there.</li>
      <li>This is a good foundation that stays looking fresh, even in humidity.</li>
      <li>The seller was good with response and made things right but would rather  buy elsewhere than have problems.</li>
      <li>This is a fabulous makeup for someone with oily skin (or a person with a ton of hot flashes - LOL).</li>
      <li>Great natural coverage without looking like you have foundation on.</li>
      <li>I have fair skin with a lot of redness and acne scars, and I&#x27;m very prone to breakouts.</li>
      <li>I bought the lightest shade of this thinking it would be fine for my skin</li>
      <li>It goes on smoothly and is easily blended.</li>
      <li>Foundation has a cool, liquid texture that is very easy to blend - it seems cool and light and absorbs into the skin.  </li>
      <li>I am a fair faced, lightly freckled ginger with sensitive skin</li>
      <li>It has great coverage, which is important for someone like me who gets the occasional breakout.</li>
      <li>I bought too light of a color, but I&#x27;ll just get some stuff</li>
      <li>/&gt;Not only does it provide great coverage, it does not cake on.</li>
      <li>My favorite long-lasting, full coverage, true ivory</li>
      <li>Best color match I&#x27;ve found for my pale complexion.  </li>
      <li>Smooths out the complexion and gives a clean look.</li>
      <li>The makeup is great and color right for my wife but only giving four stars because a problem with shipping.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a medium- full coverage foundation and covers all my redness, discoloration, acne scars and blemishes.</li>
      <li>You can spent more, but perfect for daily wear.</li>
      <li>I saw that the Revlon ColorStay was on several posts as being a good foundation, but I sort of overlooked it.  </li>
      <li>came and not only does it stay on beautifully, but it evens out my skintone super well and feels so smooth and soft....</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been trying many expensive foundations and have not been very happy with them.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been loyal to it for years now.</li>
      <li>it does a great job of controlling oil and gives a natural/matte finish without looking cakey, plus it really does last a longtime, although i don&#x27;t wear it for the 16-24 hours that the product says it lasts up to.</li>
      <li>its your gosh darn super power.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I used to live in Thailand and fell in love with a foundation I found at 7-11 for three bucks.</li>
      <li>First of all, it has good coverage to start, but I applied two coats just to hide some of my red flaws.  </li>
      <li>and it helps smooth out my complexion without making it look like I&#x27;m wearing paint on my face, and it holds out for the whole day.</li>
      <li>and I personally don&#x27;t like that kind of look</li>
      <li>I have been in search of the perfect foundation for a long, long time.</li>
      <li>right there.&lt;br /&gt;4</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s the right shade for me, but it makes me look like a ghost because it takes all of the luster out of my skin.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Rave reviews, right?</li>
      <li>I dampered with other products and this is my favorite!  </li>
      <li>and it looked really pretty.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Keeps my face from being as oily.</li>
    <li> This really does stay on for a long time, and it&#x27;s pretty weightless. It&#x27;s somewhat hard to tell it&#x27;s there, though it doesn&#x27;t disappear completely. I don&#x27;t notice an effect on my skin condition. I have oily skin and am prone to acne, this doesn&#x27;t make it better or worse.</li>
    <li> This is a good foundation that stays looking fresh, even in humidity.</li>
    <li> I Absolutely LOVE this product! i have light acne, and this totally covers it! it makes me look as if my skin is PERFECT! DEFINITELY Recommend!(:</li>
    <li> Great natural coverage without looking like you have foundation on.</li>
    <li> Its a good foundation BUT if you&#x27;re really pale like me it will be to dark.</li>
    <li> If you are very pale, do not buy this!!! I bought the lightest shade of this thinking it would be fine for my skin but it turned out to be slightly darker than my ghostly skin. It is a nice product but unfortunately did not work for me</li>
    <li> This foundation works well with my oily skin. It lasts all day. I&#x27;m pretty fair skinned but the ivory color is a good match for me. Some other foundations are just not light enough. The only bad thing about this foundation is if you have some dry patches of skin the foundation can look cakey in those areas. Even though my skin is oily I get patches of dry skin on my cheeks. I just exfoliate the skin and that seems to resolve the cakeyness issue.</li>
    <li> I like it because it does stay on all day. I just wished that I had gotten a little darker color.</li>
    <li> Smooths out the complexion and gives a clean look. However, unless you cake it on, you won&#x27;t get a totally poreless look that everyone goes for. Wears off after a few hours. If you have an oily complexion, though, it does really well (at least, for me) keeping your face less oily for longer. Better than some of the others I&#x27;ve tried. I&#x27;ll probably purchase again, though not from Amazon. The shipping&#x27;s too much when I could just go down to CVS and pick up the same product for 10 bucks.</li>
    <li> The makeup is great and color right for my wife but only giving four stars because a problem with shipping. The seller was good with response and made things right but would rather  buy elsewhere than have problems.</li>
    <li> The best value out there. Great job for the price would buy again. You can spent more, but perfect for daily wear.</li>
    <li> love it my makeup stays almost all day...to get my perfect skin tone color i have to mix the ivory,sand beige,and the buff</li>
    <li> My face is pretty red and this covers it and stays.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I find the easiest way to apply is with a damp makeup wedge.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been trying many expensive foundations and have not been very happy with them.  I saw that the Revlon ColorStay was on several posts as being a good foundation, but I sort of overlooked it.  Tired of overly-expensive makeups that are not giving me what I want, I bought the ColorStay in oily/combination skin in ivory.  I used it on the weekend and this stuff was everything it promised.  First of all, it has good coverage to start, but I applied two coats just to hide some of my red flaws.  It covered like a charm.  My face felt like it was alive rather than being weighed down by a mask.  The coverage was even and very natural and I couldn&#x27;t believe I could hide my little red imperfections and still look natural.  Foundation has a cool, liquid texture that is very easy to blend - it seems cool and light and absorbs into the skin.  Sure enough it was on from morning to evening and never looked any different.  Very impressed that it was non-greasy and non-oily and I was not embarrassed at the end of the day.&lt;br /&gt;This did not transfer to my sunglasses which really surprised me also.  When I took it off with my nightly cleanser, some light ivory color came off but there was no darkened, orange-ish mess that you find when you remove some foundations.  My skin did not dry out and it did not become an oil slick.  The price is not a high one, but this foundation seems to have everything I&#x27;ve been asking for.  I will be glad to wear this to work.  I even received a compliment today that someone liked my makeup and it looked really pretty.  That&#x27;s great, with some of the expensive foundations that went wrong, I never had those kinds of compliments.  I would definitely recommend this, even to those with sensitive skin because that&#x27;s what I have.</li>
    <li> This is the best drug store foundation I have ever used. I usually use Lancôme but ran out and didn&#x27;t have 40$ so I read some reviews and decided to purchase this product. It was a great purchase. Skin look flawless.</li>
    <li> The color really does stay.  the formulation does not cause zits.  And the &amp;#34;ivory&amp;#34; shade does not make my skin look orange.  OMG, I&#x27;m in love with this foundation.</li>
    <li> This is the best full coverage foundation I&#x27;ve found that isn&#x27;t high $$. I have a lot of redness and acne and this provides great coverage to help hide the flaws. My skin is also very sensitive and I haven&#x27;t had any issues with it. I constantly come back to this foundation.</li>
    <li> I ordered this foundation because I&#x27;ve heard good things about it, and it fits in my budget. After trying it out, I&#x27;m really impressed.  I have fair skin with a lot of redness and acne scars, and I&#x27;m very prone to breakouts. This foundation gave me as much coverage as I need without looking cakey, and hasn&#x27;t irritated my skin at all.</li>
    <li> I have combination skin. My T-zone gets oily, while my cheeks are normal to dry. This foundation made my skin look horrid. It was dry, cakey, and just awful, even on my oily T-zone. And that was on moisturized, primed skin. Ugh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was a good color match, and it may work well on super oily skin, so that&#x27;s why I gave it two stars. I will never wear it again though.</li>
    <li> I have used Revlon Colorstay Foundation for years and I have always been happy with it. It stays on and gives great coverage.</li>
    <li> While this foundation is the right color for my skin and is full coverage, it goes on SOOO thick and makes your face looks like its peeling and leave a &amp;#34;caked on&amp;#34; look. Will not buy again.</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome.  I bought too light of a color, but I&#x27;ll just get some stuff that&#x27;s too dark and use it for contouring instead.  Bought the correct shade and it matches perfectly to my skin.  It&#x27;s got real staying power, I always put a big glob on the back of my hand and pick it up from there with a Blender, and it&#x27;s almost impossible to wash it off the back of my hand when I&#x27;m done, not to mention it stays on my actual face, not on my phone.  Finish it with some translucent powder and your face is good to go all damn day.</li>
    <li> Coverage: 5 Star&lt;br /&gt;Price: 5 Star&lt;br /&gt;Staying Power: 5 Star&lt;br /&gt;Color: 3 Star -- dries a little dark :(&lt;br /&gt;Application: 4 Star -- takes some blending!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Definitely need to blend this well and use a setting powder. Can be cakey if you use too much.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, it&#x27;s great for your full coverage needs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4 Stars because I&#x27;m white as a ghost and the lightest shade dries way too dark on me.</li>
    <li> Stays on a long time, even if you sweat a bit in the summer. Good coverage (hides imperfections). Really wish they had a much lighter shade (pale with freckles).</li>
    <li> Was pretty obvious I was wearing foundation so it didn&#x27;t look natural and I personally don&#x27;t like that kind of look; color was good though.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this foundation for a long time now. It&#x27;s definitely my favorite liquid foundation. It goes on smoothly and is easily blended. It has great coverage, which is important for someone like me who gets the occasional breakout. Definitely recommend this foundation. It also lasts all day for me even if I&#x27;m very physically active during the day. Never runs when I sweat.</li>
    <li> Finally, a makeup which doesn&#x27;t react badly to my sensitive skin. Very happy with this product. Won&#x27;t be changing any time soon.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like it.. Too dry and I am oily skin yet it&#x27;s not bland..</li>
    <li> I have been using this for so many years! I have combination skin and very fair! It is hard to find a foundation that is light enough for my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not only does it provide great coverage, it does not cake on. I apply it with a makeup wedge so it looks flawless! I get a lot of compliments on my face, a lot of people call me a ‘porcelain doll’, this foundation helps keep it looking that that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love the price; it is the cheapest I have seen. I can’t buy it locally without it being over ten dollars. Great product if you want even coverage!</li>
    <li> Best color match I&#x27;ve found for my pale complexion.  Shake well!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;d do if they ever discontinued Revlon Colorstay foundation. I&#x27;ve tried more expensive foundations from high end boutiques and nothing does what this little foundation does. I&#x27;ve been loyal to it for years now. I have very freckled skin and it helps smooth out my complexion without making it look like I&#x27;m wearing paint on my face, and it holds out for the whole day.</li>
    <li> This is the most reliable foundation product out there. It&#x27;s surprising that it&#x27;s a drugstore item but I have tried maybe 20+ different foundations (powders, powder to creams, liquid) and this gets me the best results. I apply once in the morning and with primer so it lasts all day, stays smooth and as long as you don&#x27;t stand in the sun for hours will remain a matte finish! One bottle lasts me almost 9 months if I use it everyday. The sand beige shade is a PERFECT match and not even Urban Decay or tarte can compare.</li>
    <li> makes my skin look lights and bright, still might need a good concealer to go along with it so its mainly meant for foundation, skin feels pretyy oily at the end of the day though</li>
    <li> I love this! I use it everyday and it stays on the whole day! I would reccomend it to anyone.</li>
    <li> Out of all the foundations i&#x27;ve used since i started wearing make-up at age 12, this is by far the best foundation i&#x27;ve ever used. it does a great job of controlling oil and gives a natural/matte finish without looking cakey, plus it really does last a longtime, although i don&#x27;t wear it for the 16-24 hours that the product says it lasts up to. all in all, very awesome foundation, would totally recommend it.</li>
    <li> This is a fabulous makeup for someone with oily skin (or a person with a ton of hot flashes - LOL). It is very light feeling on the skin and stays in place all day! It does dry quickly on the skin, so you have to move fast... but it is awesome!</li>
    <li> I purchased this foundation after researching good foundations that provide a heavier coverage (to conceal my acne). It didn&#x27;t have any pros for me...  Cons: -Kind of has a heavy/thick feel to it. -Difficult to remove. -Can be a little cakey. -I think this may have worsened my acne. -Price (I can&#x27;t remember exactly, but I think I paid around $9-$14 at CVS).  I personally wouldn&#x27;t recommend it.</li>
    <li> Nice formula, good medium coverage (can be sheered out or built up), doesn&#x27;t oxidize too terribly, matches my super pale skin pretty well, doesn&#x27;t smell awful and is relatively inexpensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is one of my favorite foundation and it&#x27;s also the cheapest among my favorites. This is the foundation I wear at least 75% of the time. It even photographs well!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It wears best and longest if you set it with a powder. I prefer L&#x27;oreal for that, though!</li>
    <li> Perfectly pale. Not too pink based, not too yellow based, and doesn&#x27;t have the muddy brown tone either. If you&#x27;re looking for a truly pale shade, this is perfect for the fair maidens and Goth goddesses!</li>
    <li> My favorite long-lasting, full coverage, true ivory foundation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It can appear cakey if I skip moisturizer or primer, or if the weather is super dry and windy. Nobody ever gets super up-close to me to be able to tell, but sometimes I notice, usually at the end of the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I normally blend my foundation on with a flat angled kabuki brush and then go back over my troubled spots with a sponge. If I want to get fancy I&#x27;ll dust on some translucent setting powder, but I usually don&#x27;t because it dries to a semi-matte finish.</li>
    <li> This stuff is a miracle for me. I&#x27;ve been using it for 2 years now. If they ever discontinue it, I will be in shambles. Apply with a damp makeup wedge, in thin layers, and dab to conceal. Apply powder of your choice afterwards, and it will last all day! I can&#x27;t say enough about this stuff, especially for the price!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do have some acne, which is either light to moderate, and this product has not worsened it in any way; so that is of note.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I received this on time. It was a stocking stuffer for my daughter.  She loved it. It was perfect, just what she wanted.</li>
    <li> Amazing!!! Has really helped with my dry skin, couldn&#x27;t even see the patches! Also my face didn&#x27;t get oily</li>
    <li> A wonderful product and a very nice thank you I advise you to buy it on your dealings beautiful will buy again in the coming months</li>
    <li> Rave reviews, right? I fully expected to love this. I have been in search of the perfect foundation for a long, long time. I used to live in Thailand and fell in love with a foundation I found at 7-11 for three bucks. Literally, what&#x27;s supposed to be the crappy, &amp;#34;meh&amp;#34; stuff. It covered all of my blemishes, lasted all day (in THAT heat and humidity), and now costs me almost $20 to import because I can&#x27;t find a replacement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This one, I thought, might fit the bill, but it takes the epic fail cake in so many ways:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) It&#x27;s the right shade for me, but it makes me look like a ghost because it takes all of the luster out of my skin.&lt;br /&gt;2) Within ten minutes of applying it, it already looks cakey and streaky.&lt;br /&gt;3) While it applies well under my eyes and doesn&#x27;t crease (my only complaint with my other foundation), within a few hours I feel like it stops reflecting light from the area and my face just looks flat right there.&lt;br /&gt;4) It has, at best, light-medium coverage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am disappointed in this and, frankly, tired of wasting money on foundations that just don&#x27;t work.</li>
    <li> Holy butts.  I got this because another reviewer mentioned it in their review of the Manic Panic Virgin White Dreamtone Foundation, saying that they use a combination of both for their pale, oily skin.  PALE OILY SKIN?!?! THAT&#x27;S ME!!!  WE&#x27;RE SOULMATES!!!!!  I was so shocked with this came and not only does it stay on beautifully, but it evens out my skintone super well and feels so smooth and soft.... I have a problem where my skin gets so oily throughout the day that my glasses basically refuse to stay put on my nose no matter what I do.  THIS FIXED THAT PROBLEM.  Guys.  This makeup makes me see better.  That should be one of their selling points; Revlon ColorStay: You&#x27;ll be able to see like its your gosh darn super power.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seriously, I&#x27;m so in love.  And if you&#x27;re naturally paler or want to lighten this just a bit, definitely use a coat of this before a coat of the Manic Panic stuff I was talking about earlier because they both work phenomenally.</li>
    <li> is an excellent seller, I recommend it 100%.</li>
    <li> This foundation works best for people with very oily skin. My skin is oily, but it has a few patches of severly dry skin. I have to use A LOT  of moisturizer to use this. I would not purchase this again for myself, but I know a lot of people with oily skin who love love love this product!</li>
    <li> This is one of my favorite products of all time -- a &amp;#34;holy grail&amp;#34; product if you will!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pros: This product has excellent full coverage, perfect for covering blemishes or evening out skin tone.  The &amp;#34;Ivory&amp;#34; shade is perfect for my extremely pale skin, and this foundation (with a little setting powder or spray) will last several hours without needing a touch-up.  I also like the soft feel of the foundation of the skin.  The texture is good, and the finish is somewhere between matte and a light dewy look.  You can use sparingly for a lighter coverage if you prefer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cons:  Really none to mention, except a slight warning to make sure you use a moisturizer or primer before applying so that it goes on smoothly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, when I purchased from this seller (two bottles) they were not packaged well and one was broken on arrival.  There was almost no padding in the box.  I would suggest purchasing from your local drugstore unless they change their packaging process.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for a while but this one I got the liquid is so thick and I almost have to knock the bottle every time before getting anything out..</li>
    <li> This is an incredible foundation and matched me perfectly. I&#x27;ve been wanting to try this for a while since hearing so many good things about it, at first I was skeptical about buying it online because I was afraid it wouldn&#x27;t end up matching me, but it matched me perfectly. I&#x27;m very pale and the color Ivory matched me perfectly. It&#x27;s a medium- full coverage foundation and covers all my redness, discoloration, acne scars and blemishes. It&#x27;s very buildable and lightweight, doesn&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m wearing any makeup on my face. I definitely recommend this foundation.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product since it came out! I dampered with other products and this is my favorite!  The price here on Amazon was cheaper than I pay in the store (Walmart) so that was hella nice. I am a fair faced, lightly freckled ginger with sensitive skin and I have no problems at all with this product. Last a while even with steady use.</li>
    <li> 15 year old chose this after much blog review as her &amp;#34;go to&amp;#34; product and she is a repeat buyer.  I guess until her blogs start trending something else...</li>
