      <li>I&#x27;ll try it again in summer, when the humidity picks up, and see if I like it any better.</li>
      <li>And it doesn&#x27;t itch like most of the mousses I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
      <li>This is my favorite styling product.</li>
      <li>Strong hold while still being flexible.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s really pretty amazing.  </li>
      <li>I have tried many different powers to add texture to my fine/soft but healthy hair and this is by far the best.</li>
      <li>I have a lot of hair but fine hair.</li>
      <li>and my hair feels fantastic, all day.</li>
      <li>Really cool product that is easy to use and works.</li>
      <li>Worth every penny!</li>
      <li>(If you&#x27;re familiar with [[ASIN:</li>
      <li>I actually never purchased the product from Amazon, but this product is amazing.</li>
      <li>I have lots of fine hair and like to fluff it up, I use this in combination with a boost spray and then a bit of back-combing to add even more oomph</li>
      <li>I recently permed my very fine hair, and this gives it the volume it needs.</li>
      <li>There just isn&#x27;t enough hair volume for me to make a messy bun, and as recommended by my hair dresser, this works great!!</li>
      <li>I have super straight hair that needs a lot of help to get volume.</li>
      <li>it will create so much &amp;#34;texture&amp;#34; a wide-toothed comb wont make it through!  </li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t use too much though!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve cut more than 4 inches off since that initial use and still have the damage on my ends.</li>
      <li>gently sprinkle in moderation!</li>
      <li>Love this product for when I need that extra fullness in my hair...</li>
      <li>Most of the time my hair just falls flat and has no shape or dimension to it.</li>
      <li>If you love your hair, steer clear of this powder-after 3 really long months and many tears, I am finally getting my healthy hair back and also getting compliments, instead of \\&quot;Oh my GOD!</li>
      <li>B0028C6UO8 100% Pure Fruit Pigmented Lip &amp; Cheek Tint]], that&#x27;s about the size of the packaging).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meh.</li>
      <li>My hair is extremely healthy, which is great, but also bad for styling.</li>
      <li>I have no clue how a bit of powder does all that, and I really don&#x27;t care.</li>
      <li>&lt;br /&gt;Downside don&#x27;t really like the feel of it in my hair.</li>
      <li>, therefore my hair is very &amp;#34;slippery&amp;#34;.</li>
      <li>Works best with dry hair, very pliable and leaves no residue behind.  </li>
      <li>It is a small container and a nice product, but the $42 price tag, in my opinion, is too high.</li>
      <li>I have had no negative effects to my hair since I started using it.</li>
      <li>Live and learn.</li>
      <li>A product that does not weigh down fine hair...</li>
      <li>Works particularly well with my heavy but baby fine hair.</li>
      <li>I would have given this product 5 stars, but I haven&#x27;t used it on my own yet, which is usually the ultimate test</li>
      <li>Perhaps this powder would be less gross on thick hair, but wouldn&#x27;t all that natural hair volume obviate a need for a volumizing product in the first place?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I experimented with varying amounts, and no matter how much I used, my hair felt gritty, and bizarrely sticky yet dry, not uplifted and volumized ... unless you count static as volume.</li>
      <li>This bottle will last a long time if you use it correctly which makes it worth the price.</li>
      <li>They still looked fabulous when I took them out (only slight fly-aways).</li>
      <li>This is the only powder/ dry shampoo that I have ever used that has actually absorbed oil</li>
      <li>I have very fine, thin hair that is always in need of a boost.</li>
      <li>To put things in perspective, I have very fine, thin hair</li>
      <li>I was so surprised when I opened the box, I initially thought I&#x27;d been sent a sample in error.</li>
      <li>I read great reviews about this product, and I love the other Surface hair products I have tried, but this one was awful.</li>
      <li>Be very careful not to use too much...</li>
      <li>Just a light sprinkle and regular back-combing gives your hair that little something extra to help it keep height and a style all day long.</li>
      <li>I barely need to tease me hair and it lasts all day and even into the next.</li>
      <li>I sprinkle it in may hair either before bed or in the morning and it noticeably removes oils and is not difficult to rub in, even with very dark brown hair!</li>

<li> This product really works to add body and control to limp, flat hair.</li>

<li> AND IT ADDS VOLUME TO FLAT HAIR.</li>
<li> I have used it a long time</li>
<li> My stylist used this on my slightly damp hair before braiding each side back into two French plaits.</li>
<li> blonde hair with very closed cuticle</li>
<li> I had the most unpleasant experience with this product.</li>
<li> This powder will last for several months, as very little is needed to accomplish the result I&#x27;m looking for.</li>
<li> My stylist recommended this product, and I was super skeptical about it.</li>
<li> I bought this little product the beginning of 2015 for $32.50 total (this price included shipping) and had to think about the price then.</li>
<li> Nope, $24 for a plastic shaker bottle not much taller than a lipstick tube.</li>
<li> The first time my stylist used this product I was skeptical because I literally have purchased and tried everything to help.</li>
<li> Shake a few times on your hands, rub it into your roots and hair, and it absorbs oil and thickens dry hair.  </li>
<li> I mean, it&#x27;s a powder, for crying out loud.</li>
<li> I use it on slightly dirty hair before using hot rollers, and my hair holds curl a lot longer.</li>
<li> I have non-colored treated, long, thick hair.</li>
<li> Remember when you were little and your dad tortured you by rubbing a blown-up balloon on the rug and then holding the balloon against your hair?</li>
<li> She said it was one of the few she could find that was &amp;#34;vegan&amp;#34;</li>
<li> AKA - doesn&#x27;t use a lot of harsh chemicals.</li>
<li> I usually use a watered down volumizing &amp;#34;root boost&amp;#34;.</li>
<li> Typically, my hair slips from the braid and loses its shape.</li>
<li> A little dab will do ya!</li>
<li> When I style and tease my hair is usually falls out before I even leave the house.</li>
<li> Just tap a small amount on and then push hair upward...</li>
<li> I had a friend who has very thick curly hair try it, then my mom with short/straight/thin hair tried it.</li>
<li> Needless to say, I loves it.</li>
<li> It leaves my hair feeling dirty at the root, but you&#x27;re not going to get away from that as it&#x27;s job is to give you texture.</li>
<li> Whether or not it was a bad batch, I will never know, nor do I care.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This product really works to add body and control to limp, flat hair. And it doesn&#x27;t itch like most of the mousses I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> A product that does not weigh down fine hair...it actually does the opposite!!! Just a sprinkle of this powder at the root creates instant volume and texture without greasiness!!! AMAZING! Worth every penny! Even the next day, no greasiness!</li>
    <li> I had the most unpleasant experience with this product. Let me start by saying that I am a hairdresser, and have been one for 27 years.  I have a demi-permanent color, don&#x27;t use gels, mousse&#x27; or hairspray. Fortunately for my clients, I decided to try this product on my own hair before any of theirs. This Push Powder ruined my hair, it instantly turned to straw and was and still is breaking off with even the slightest tension. I&#x27;ve cut more than 4 inches off since that initial use and still have the damage on my ends. Whether or not it was a bad batch, I will never know, nor do I care. After contacting the company, they declared that it most likely not their product, but my hair, supposedly did an investigation, but found nothing wrong with the product. Let me also add, that I put this powder in a ponytail that I was sending to Locks of Love, and that hair too turned to straw. If you love your hair, steer clear of this powder-after 3 really long months and many tears, I am finally getting my healthy hair back and also getting compliments, instead of \\&quot;Oh my GOD! What happened to your hair?\\&quot; again.</li>
    <li> I have tried many different powers to add texture to my fine/soft but healthy hair and this is by far the best. For a reference point, I have healthy (but colored) blonde hair with very closed cuticle, therefore my hair is very &amp;#34;slippery&amp;#34;. I usually use a watered down volumizing &amp;#34;root boost&amp;#34;. This powder will last for several months, as very little is needed to accomplish the result I&#x27;m looking for. Be very careful not to use too much...it will create so much &amp;#34;texture&amp;#34; a wide-toothed comb wont make it through!  If used properly, you wont even need hairspray!!</li>
    <li> Love this product.  I have a lot of hair but fine hair. Gives it body when I need it and keeps it like that for a while.</li>
    <li> My stylist used this on my slightly damp hair before braiding each side back into two French plaits. Typically, my hair slips from the braid and loses its shape. Using this, combined with the Surface Sea Salt Spray, created enough texture for my braids to stay not one day, but three. They still looked fabulous when I took them out (only slight fly-aways). I would have given this product 5 stars, but I haven&#x27;t used it on my own yet, which is usually the ultimate test (I feel like my stylist could use dirt or baking flour and still get great results!). I&#x27;m purchasing my own stash now...</li>
    <li> Push powder is a wonderful aid in fixing your hair.  it adds volume and control.  I have used it a long time</li>
    <li> There just isn&#x27;t enough hair volume for me to make a messy bun, and as recommended by my hair dresser, this works great!!</li>
    <li> My hair stylist recommended this and it works fantastically.  I had never heard of any project like this before. Works best with dry hair, very pliable and leaves no residue behind.  Strong hold while still being flexible.</li>
    <li> I read great reviews about this product, and I love the other Surface hair products I have tried, but this one was awful. To put things in perspective, I have very fine, thin hair that&#x27;s short (chin-length bob), and I tested the powder in one of the coldest, driest winters in years. Perhaps this powder would be less gross on thick hair, but wouldn&#x27;t all that natural hair volume obviate a need for a volumizing product in the first place?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I experimented with varying amounts, and no matter how much I used, my hair felt gritty, and bizarrely sticky yet dry, not uplifted and volumized ... unless you count static as volume. Something in the ingredients made my hair stand on end, in a way that would make Don King jealous. Remember when you were little and your dad tortured you by rubbing a blown-up balloon on the rug and then holding the balloon against your hair? That&#x27;s what I&#x27;m talking about. Hair by Edison.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, don&#x27;t let the photo deceive you. The stock image should include a walnut for perspective, because this product is  T I N Y. I was so surprised when I opened the box, I initially thought I&#x27;d been sent a sample in error. Nope, $24 for a plastic shaker bottle not much taller than a lipstick tube. (If you&#x27;re familiar with [[ASIN:B0028C6UO8 100% Pure Fruit Pigmented Lip &amp; Cheek Tint]], that&#x27;s about the size of the packaging).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meh. I&#x27;ll try it again in summer, when the humidity picks up, and see if I like it any better.</li>
    <li> I actually never purchased the product from Amazon, but this product is amazing. My stylist uses this product every time I go to get my hair done. I have non-colored treated, long, thick hair. My hair is extremely healthy, which is great, but also bad for styling. Most of the time my hair just falls flat and has no shape or dimension to it. When I style and tease my hair is usually falls out before I even leave the house. The first time my stylist used this product I was skeptical because I literally have purchased and tried everything to help. To my surprise, this has been the only product that has held the tease for the entire day! I love this stuff.</li>
    <li> Really cool product that is easy to use and works. My hairstylest used it on me one visit. Great for travel.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a recommendation from my stylist. She said it was one of the few she could find that was &amp;#34;vegan&amp;#34; AKA - doesn&#x27;t use a lot of harsh chemicals. It leaves my hair feeling dirty at the root, but you&#x27;re not going to get away from that as it&#x27;s job is to give you texture. Use it all the time!</li>
    <li> Love this product for when I need that extra fullness in my hair... Just tap a small amount on and then push hair upward... Helps hold fullness for up to a couple of days....&lt;br /&gt;Downside don&#x27;t really like the feel of it in my hair.</li>
    <li> My stylist introduced me to this great styling aid. Just a light sprinkle and regular back-combing gives your hair that little something extra to help it keep height and a style all day long. Works particularly well with my heavy but baby fine hair.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m definitely in agreement with all the hype about this stuff. My stylist put some on my hair and said, &amp;#34;you think its great now, wait till you feel it in the morning!&amp;#34; The piece-ey er look that it leaves you with in the morning is great too. I have lots of fine hair and like to fluff it up, I use this in combination with a boost spray and then a bit of back-combing to add even more oomph and my hair feels fantastic, all day. No need for hairspray. It also leaves your hair feeling natural and not crisp, or crunchy, like a hairspray often will.</li>
    <li> A friend of mine gave me a sample of this, and it is amazing.  Shake a few times on your hands, rub it into your roots and hair, and it absorbs oil and thickens dry hair.  It&#x27;s really pretty amazing.  I use it on slightly dirty hair before using hot rollers, and my hair holds curl a lot longer.</li>
    <li> This is the only powder/ dry shampoo that I have ever used that has actually absorbed oil AND IT ADDS VOLUME TO FLAT HAIR. Needless to say, I loves it. I sprinkle it in may hair either before bed or in the morning and it noticeably removes oils and is not difficult to rub in, even with very dark brown hair!</li>
    <li> This gives my hair body and fullness, and my style stays all day.  This is my favorite styling product. I won&#x27;t be without it.</li>
    <li> works great for added height.  do not over-apply!  gently sprinkle in moderation!</li>
    <li> I like this product but won&#x27;t buy again because it is so over priced. Baby powder does the same thing.&lt;br /&gt;Fast shipment though. Live and learn.</li>
    <li> I bought this little product the beginning of 2015 for $32.50 total (this price included shipping) and had to think about the price then. It has increased in another $10 since that time.  It is a small container and a nice product, but the $42 price tag, in my opinion, is too high.</li>
    <li> I have super straight hair that needs a lot of help to get volume. This product is by far the best I have ever used. I barely need to tease me hair and it lasts all day and even into the next. You only need a sprinkle or two. I have had no negative effects to my hair since I started using it. This bottle will last a long time if you use it correctly which makes it worth the price.</li>
    <li> Awsome service and product</li>
    <li> This is the best texturizing/volumizing product. I recently permed my very fine hair, and this gives it the volume it needs. It not only gives the illusion of thicker hair, but it actually feels thicker to the touch. It&#x27;s kind of crazy. I had a friend who has very thick curly hair try it, then my mom with short/straight/thin hair tried it. It worked perfectly for all of us. It&#x27;s like it just adds awesomeness to any hair type.</li>
    <li> A little dab will do ya! Love how it thickens my hair and have used it for years. Don&#x27;t use too much though!</li>
    <li> I have very fine, thin hair that is always in need of a boost. My stylist recommended this product, and I was super skeptical about it. I mean, it&#x27;s a powder, for crying out loud. For my hair? But by sprinkling the tiniest amount into my hair at the roots and fluffing it out, I have instant volume that lasts ALL FREAKING DAY. It&#x27;s a miracle! I have no clue how a bit of powder does all that, and I really don&#x27;t care. All I know is that it works! Definitely check this stuff out.</li>
