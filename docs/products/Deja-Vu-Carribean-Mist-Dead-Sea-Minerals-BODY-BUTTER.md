<li> I can skip using it for a few days and it&#x27;ll be still so soft and hydrated.  </li>
<li> it does an excellent&lt;br /&gt;job of moisturizing my dry skin.</li>
<li> A little bit goes a long way, so the product will last</li>
<li> I recommend this product for anyone; even if your skin isn&#x27;t very dry.</li>
<li> I will definitely continuing ordering the Carribean Mist and use it everyday.  </li>
<li> It is a thick cream and it makes your skin so soft.</li>
<li> if you put a lot it can leave your hands slightly greasy, but then it seems to obsorb in your skin.</li>
<li> You will also want to use it after the Carribean Mist Dead Sea Scrub.</li>
<li> was ridiculous.  </li>
<li> it was so bad</li>

    <li> An excellent moisturizer for severely dry, chapped, or even cracked skin. If my hands have cracked skin, when I apply it at night I wake with the cracks already sealed and completely healed in a couple days. I recommend this product for anyone; even if your skin isn&#x27;t very dry.</li>
    <li> THE BOMB!  I first tried it from the kiosk at the mall and when I went back the price to get it without the set was ridiculous.  Went to Amazonand been purchasing ever since.  Really good for the hands and the entire body for real.</li>
    <li> I love  this  item. And  will  order  this  very  two  months</li>
    <li> I love this product and you can&#x27;t beat the online price.</li>
    <li> Love this product!!!  I use this product daily and it is wonderful on old skin or young skin.  Try it!</li>
    <li> It actually removed callouses from my hands that I had otherwise given up hope that my hands could ever feel soft again...I used to work an outdoor job, so my hands were weathered and calloused...my other job is professional sewing so softness is important that those callouses don&#x27;t get snagged on fine fabrics...I can&#x27;t say enough how wonderful I feel.</li>
    <li> My skin is very dry and after shaving, I put Déjà VU cream on my face and it feels smooth all day.</li>
    <li> Gave as a gift to my mom for Mother&#x27;s Day and she absolutely loves. Déjà Vu products are wonderful. This had a wonderful scent and creates smooth gorgeous skin!</li>
    <li> Carribean Mist Body Butter....Excellent for total body...leaves skin soft, moisturized without oily feeling.  I would highly recommend this particular body butter by Deja Vu.  I am enjoying the NEW..green tea body butter, but not as much as the Carribean Mist.  I will definitely continuing ordering the Carribean Mist and use it everyday.  It is amazing!  The scent is lovely and not overpowering, just&lt;br /&gt;right. The quality is above my expectations.  The price is right, too.</li>
    <li> I use this lotion on the days I don&#x27;t use the Deja Vu body scrub.  It works great.  My skin has never been so soft!</li>
    <li> I can not tell you how wonderful your face and body feels after you use this.&lt;br /&gt;I love this product</li>
    <li> excellent product every ne of my house uses it.,. I had to hide it ... Excellent  for the feet also</li>
    <li> This is the best for dry skin ,I use it everyday in the winter and my skin is never dry or cracked . It used to bleed it was so bad but after this it doesnt anymore !</li>
    <li> This is the most amazing Body Butter ever!  I use it everyday and love the scent.  It&#x27;s so fresh!  You will also want to use it after the Carribean Mist Dead Sea Scrub.</li>
    <li> This has always been one of my favorite products, and at this great, low price. No Brainer!!!&lt;br /&gt;Yes, would recommended</li>
    <li> I love this product. It is a thick cream and it makes your skin so soft. I used it all and I just love the smell of this product as well.</li>
    <li> My husband bought this for me at a mall kiosk(where it was much more expensive than here). I can&#x27;t say the&lt;br /&gt;scent reminds me of the Caribbean, but it is pleasant. A little bit goes a long way, so the product will last&lt;br /&gt;quite a while. It feels greasy when applying it and it does take a while to absorb, but it does an excellent&lt;br /&gt;job of moisturizing my dry skin.</li>
    <li> The product arrived promptly.  I love this lotion.  The price is a fraction of what you would pay at the store.</li>
    <li> Way cheaper on amazon than in the mall. Worth the buy! Makes a great gift for people with dry skin, or any woman who loves lotions!</li>
    <li> First off, I bought this for $40 instead of $80 at the mall on Black Friday.  That was before I knew about the amazing prices here on Amazon.  I&#x27;ll definitely be butying them here from now on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyway, my legs get very dry, even with daily use of lotion from body and bath works.  This body butter is the best thing to ever happen to my legs.  I had to use it daily for a week or so at first.  Then, I would only need it 2-3 times a week.  I can skip using it for a few days and it&#x27;ll be still so soft and hydrated.  I can&#x27;t imagine my beauty station lacking THIS!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even after ordering this, it is still on my wish list, so I can go straight to it and re-order!</li>
    <li> My wife loves this stuff. When it comes to our front door, it always makes her day.</li>
    <li> I was a little weary about ordering this product online at such a low price considering the mall kiosks price at more than double. I was pleasantly surprised to find that I received the exact same quality product as the ones that I bought in the mall.</li>
    <li> I REALLY REALLY REALLY REALLY REALLY REALLY LOVE THE SMELL OF THIS BODY BUTTER. I FEEL INSTANTLY RELAXED AND REJUVENATED AFTER USING THIS LOTION. THANK YOU SO MUCH I WOULD DEFINITELY RECOMMEND THIS TO OTHERSSSSSS</li>
    <li> I have used this product for a few years and just love the soft silky feel. It soaks in and doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy feel. Great value for the money!</li>
    <li> This cream I took a Chance. Never smelled it only the paradise one and when I bought this one. I couldnt stop smelling it. Its soft and if you put a lot it can leave your hands slightly greasy, but then it seems to obsorb in your skin. Smell stays for a good amount of time. Buy them nonlinear not in the store.</li>
