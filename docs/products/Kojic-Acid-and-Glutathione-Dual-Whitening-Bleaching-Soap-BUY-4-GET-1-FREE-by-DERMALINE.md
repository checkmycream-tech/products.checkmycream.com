<li> I&#x27;m on 2nd one now in not sure if soap will get you lighter and clear black and white heads</li>
<li> I let the soap dry on my skin for like 5 mins and rinse off please stay away from the sun</li>
<li> I will buy this product every single time I run out.</li>
<li> it burns which I guess should have been expected</li>
<li> I use this along with Amlactin Moisturizing Body Cream (Green and White Bottle)</li>
<li> The only thing this did was burn my skin, make it extremely dry and dull.</li>
<li> This is not worth the money.</li>
<li> this soap can slightly whiten your skin.</li>
<li> This soap will clear your skin and lighten difficult to lighten areas of your body.</li>
<li> Too harsh.</li>
<li> It takes months of use though to get an even skin tone, at least for olive complexions.</li>
<li> it dries your skin ...making it look dull and unhealthy.</li>

    <li> The best soap ever!. My words can&#x27;t express the work of this soap. Thanks</li>
    <li> I bought this soap to clear up my back acne but it was not resolved.&lt;br /&gt;But this soap can slightly whiten your skin.</li>
    <li> I like glutathione dual whitening....^^</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s my second time ordering me and my daughter use it twice a day it&#x27;s working</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s nice soap but I don&#x27;t see any whitening effects.</li>
    <li> USE TWICE A DAY &amp; RESULTS USUALLY SHOW IN THE FIRST 6-7 DAYS!!! -MT</li>
    <li> Fast shipping and i love the product,it really works for me!!</li>
    <li> Whitening? Are you kidding? This is not worth the money. I&#x27;ll return it if I could. Find something else as this one did not do anything at all.</li>
    <li> Great facial cleaner !</li>
    <li> THE BUY 4 AND GET ONE FREE IS SUCH A GREAT BUY. IT IS EASY TO USE AND LATHERS VERY GOOD. IT REALLY DOESN&#x27;T HAVE&lt;br /&gt;A FRAGRANCE,BUT THAT IS GOOD BECAUSE THE SOAP DOES AS IT IS SUPPOSE TO. I WILL BUY THIS AGAIN.</li>
    <li> It was exactly what i expected, on time and at a good price...</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t seen any progress but the bar soap gets small really quick</li>
    <li> The price is great and the soap is original, fast shipping using for two days and I&#x27;m already seeing results my outer arms and lower legs are already lightening and getting even. I have very oily skin and I must say I&#x27;m now waking up to a radiant non oily face and yes I&#x27;m using it on my face and entire body (except genitals). Everyone is different so I don&#x27;t expect everyone to get results within 48 hours like myself but it is worth the try trust me. I use this along with Amlactin Moisturizing Body Cream (Green and White Bottle) it&#x27;s available here on Amazon for 19.99 great combo for fast results. I let the soap dry on my skin for like 5 mins and rinse off please stay away from the sun wear your sunscreen good luck everyone :)  I will provide another update after my first bar is done.</li>
    <li> Product works as it promises. Thank for I have already received positive comments.</li>
    <li> We have been looking for the soap she loves it.</li>
    <li> Nno no no! Not for me. Dried out my skin straight away. I&#x27;m gonna trash the remaining or give them out. Didn&#x27;t work for me</li>
    <li> I love this product! Give it a couple of weeks and it will lighten your skin. This got rid of my tan and then some! My skin looks so bright and I am lighter than I have ever been in my life. You wont find this at your local store. I will buy this product every single time I run out.</li>
    <li> The only thing this did was burn my skin, make it extremely dry and dull. I don&#x27;t like it. Too harsh.</li>
    <li> This soap will clear your skin and lighten difficult to lighten areas of your body.</li>
    <li> This is Good, but dries skin&lt;br /&gt;This is better when use with the Kojic Acid Lotion</li>
    <li> Bought it for my wife, its a good buy for the price!!</li>
    <li> I highly recommend it. It so gentle on the face. It made my face smoother and lighter.</li>
    <li> This soap Is Just like the other sellers , but this one you buy  1 get 1 free plus free shipping and 3 days arrived..! Very special price, cheaper . I love it I&#x27;m on 2nd one now in not sure if soap will get you lighter and clear black and white heads but I can feel it different somehow..I&#x27;m sure will order these again. Keep the good work! You get five stars from me 😊</li>
    <li> There is something diffrent about this soap, this is not the same stuff ive been using . Buyers beware. Make sure you get it pinoy only</li>
    <li> Works.... brightening your skin and that is what i was looking for a nice bright complexion</li>
    <li> This soap is good but should not be used everyday...it dries your skin ...making it look dull and unhealthy. The lightening affect can be seen right after every wash but nothing lasting...dark spots has not faded significantly....i am on my second bar and will see how it goes..maybe continuous use brings better results...it burns which I guess should have been expected</li>
    <li> Try it you&#x27;ll love it.</li>
    <li> Came Within 5 Days, Good Packaging, Started Lighting My Skin On The First Use! If You Have Acne Marks Or Scars They Will Fade Very Quickly. Do Not Hesitate To Purchase If You Are Looking For A More Lighter Even Skin Tone.</li>
    <li> Love this soap. Gets you clean. Nice brightening effect when used properly.</li>
    <li> My wife loves this stuff. Don&#x27;t ask me why.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s a woman thing,&lt;br /&gt;I liked the speedy delivery!!</li>
    <li> This works well for lightening acne scars and other scars cost effectively. It takes months of use though to get an even skin tone, at least for olive complexions. It does a good job of brightening the skin. It&#x27;s gentle. I was pleasantly surprised by this product!</li>
    <li> Three out of five star😶</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t seen any improvement on my skin. Already used 3 bars of soap and nothings changed.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this soap for over a year and it has really made a difference on my arms where I have pilaris keratosis.  My skin is now smooth and  I will continue to use this.  1 bar will not make a difference, you will need to continue to use to see results.</li>
    <li> Yep, Yep, Yep it works. I was scared I wasn&#x27;t going to get an original product.&lt;br /&gt;I used to use Kojie San but it stopped working so I needed something else.&lt;br /&gt;That did the trick. My skin looks brighter, evened, smooth. The acne scars needed a little push to disappear for good and the soap is doing just that.&lt;br /&gt;The last time my skin was this close to healthy was when I started with Kojie San.</li>
    <li> the soap is perfect i can see the result in a week</li>
