      <li>It goes into the landfill, to be sure.  </li>
      <li>I bought this thinking it would be easier to use than a manual flosser, do a better job, or both.  </li>
      <li>and i am so glad i could order these online since none of the stores in the area sold them.</li>
      <li>This is the most convienent item for reaching all my teeth and not have the floss fall apart.</li>

      <li>Really!</li>
      <li>This can get pretty pricey after awhile.  </li>

      <li>This is totally over the top.  </li>
      <li>I agree with the previous reviewer that it would be nice if we had a machine like this with replaceable floss.</li>
      <li>also recently tried Glide disposable flossers and the floss broke too easily on those.  </li>
      <li>This makes the device easy to maneuver inside even a tiny mouth (like mine).  </li>
      <li>Amazon  Thanks</li>

      <li>No more fumbling around and wondering if I did a good enough job.</li>
      <li>The only problem I see right now is the price of floss picks.  </li>
      <li>Also, I wish this product were available in other floss types, like the tape/wide floss.</li>
      <li>When I ordered this item, I assumed that the flosser attachment would be some sort of gadget to which you would add new dental floss at each use.  </li>
      <li>I rinse the head after use in hot water, and dip it into Listerine to sterilize it for the next use.  </li>
      <li>My hands do not fit in my mouth to easily floss all of the teeth without trying to stuff both hands in my mouth.  </li>
      <li>The floss is tightly strung and the vibrating action of the flosser makes it much easier to get the floss into those tight spaces and -- even better -- to remove it intact!</li>
      <li>I plan to keep my teeth into old age and beyond and this will help.</li>
      <li>The Humming Bird&#x27;s rapid side-to-side vibration gives your teeth a much better flossing compared to the typical ribbon or any other device.  </li>
      <li>It is becoming hard to find in our local stores.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> The Oral B Humming Bird Flosser is the only flossing product that works well consistantly.  The regular string floss hurts my fingers by cutting off the circulation.  Other flossing products already attached to some sort of disposable reaching gadget always break on the floss and become disconnected.  This product is so good and is wonderful for tight teeth.  The vibration helps to get in and out of the tight areas.  It works that much better than all the other products I&#x27;ve tried and worth every cent!</li>
    <li> My husband has used this product for several years.  It is becoming hard to find in our local stores.  Delivery was prompt and pricing was good.</li>
    <li> I have very tight teeth and would routinely shred dental floss.  Ever have a shred of the floss get stuck between your teeth?  The Hummingbird flosser is the answer!  The floss is tightly strung and the vibrating action of the flosser makes it much easier to get the floss into those tight spaces and -- even better -- to remove it intact!</li>
    <li> When I ordered this item, I assumed that the flosser attachment would be some sort of gadget to which you would add new dental floss at each use.  Actually, each flosser is a plastic prong with pre-strung floss in it, to be used once and discarded.  Let me see:  a million conscientious users floss daily and you have 365,000,000 plastic doodads added to the world&#x27;s landfills every year.  I already compromise my principles for convenience more than I&#x27;d like to admit.  This is totally over the top.  When I&#x27;ve used up my supply of flossers, out this thing goes.  It goes into the landfill, to be sure.  So don&#x27;t anyone else make my mistake.</li>
    <li> These are so great and i am so glad i could order these online since none of the stores in the area sold them.</li>
    <li> i love the hummingbird very easy to use and it works great.  Flossing has never been easier for me</li>
    <li> This little thing works great.  I understand what the other reviewer is saying about the plastic in the landfill but I have to admit this thing works great.  I have always had a problem flossing every day with regular floss but since I bought this Hummingbird I floss every day.  I have a sonic toothbrush as well and the combination of both really cleans my teeth and gums.  I hope the previous reviewer will forgive me but I am hooked on this little machine.  The only problem I see right now is the price of floss picks.  They range from $3.50 to $3.99 for a 15 day supply.  This can get pretty pricey after awhile.  I watch for coupons and specials (Amazon).  I agree with the previous reviewer that it would be nice if we had a machine like this with replaceable floss.</li>
    <li> I like this product.  Makes flossing much easier and more convenient than straight string.  My only quip is that the floss sometimes separates strands.  Also, I wish this product were available in other floss types, like the tape/wide floss.</li>
    <li> I bought this thinking it would be easier to use than a manual flosser, do a better job, or both.  Was I disappointed.  The floss is too loose to snap between your teeth, you have to constantly press the button to activate the motion (no true on/off switch), and it is too short.  You have to have your hand in your mouth to use it on molars.  I tried several times thinking I would eventually get the hang of it.  Finally I gave up and went back to my manual Reach flosser.  It&#x27;s a much better product for half the price. [[ASIN:B000GGKPRQ Reach Access Daily Flosser Family Pack With 14 Refill Heads - 1 Each]]</li>
    <li> I hate admitting this but, until the Oral B Humming Bird came along, I flossed maybe once a month.  Tight teeth and sore gums meant 20 minutes of misery and shredded, stuck floss, with stuff still stuck in between teeth.  The floss in the Humming Bird refills is thin and waxed and held in a little plastic slingshot.  This makes the device easy to maneuver inside even a tiny mouth (like mine).  The Humming Bird&#x27;s rapid side-to-side vibration gives your teeth a much better flossing compared to the typical ribbon or any other device.  I actually look forward to flossing now.  Really!</li>
    <li> Ordered from seller and product was received as expected.  I would use this seller again.[[ASIN:B0001HYMG0 Oral B Hummingbird Refill Picks, 25-Pack]]</li>
    <li> My husband loves his flosser and is so disappointed that it&#x27;s been discontinued.</li>
    <li> For me, flossing with just a string of floss is nearly impossible. It&#x27;s hard to get the right angle and the floss slips a lot on my fingers. Even my hygenist wears gloves when she flosses my teeth. This stuff works great and lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> Good product for a nice little hummingbird flosser.  Used every day and still really loving it.  Would buy it again.</li>
    <li> I have had the OralB floss for some time and could not find refills anywhere but Amazon  Thanks</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always purchased the Oral B Hummingbird refills on Amazon.com for under $5 for 15 refills and the Oral B website shows them for $3.95, but not available on line.  No stores seem to carry them, so I&#x27;ve tried ordering them on line from a variety of sites and they are now over $50 for one pack of 15.  Is everyone out of their mind?  Is anyone out there purchasing these at this outrageous price?  Even the Hummingbird device itself is selling for $34.95.  RIP OFF!</li>
    <li> I did not like this product.  The handle for this flosser short.  I threw this away without even using the refills and went back to using my Reach flosser.  [[ASIN:B0017TU2HE Reach Access Flosser]][[ASIN:B0058P7LMW Reach Access Flosser Refill Pack Disposable Snap-on Heads, Unflavored  28-count Packages (Pack of 2)]][[ASIN:B005CPZJ0E Reach Access Flosser Cleanpaste Refill Disposable Snap-on Heads, 28-count Packages (Pack of 2)]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also recently tried Glide disposable flossers and the floss broke too easily on those.  I had to use up to 3 a day.  I have found the Reach flosser to be the best so far as I have found.</li>
    <li> Anything that makes flossing easy is wonderful. I plan to keep my teeth into old age and beyond and this will help. It is especially good for me for those pesky back molars and wisdom teeth. No more fumbling around and wondering if I did a good enough job. Considering that there is a correlation between gum disease and heart disease, I&#x27;ll keep on flossing in whichever way makes it easy and is effective. Want to save the earth? Have one less kid. That should cancel out about 100,000,000,000,000 people&#x27;s flossing discards.</li>
    <li> Last year I was diagnosed with peridontal disease.  After the first root scaling, flossing became a very important part of preventing that from ever happening again.  My hands do not fit in my mouth to easily floss all of the teeth without trying to stuff both hands in my mouth.  These flossers are wonderful and work very well at dislodging food between the teeth.  My hygenist commented on the rapid improvement I have had.  As for throwing them away after each flossing, it isn&#x27;t necessary.  I rinse the head after use in hot water, and dip it into Listerine to sterilize it for the next use.  I wait until the flost starts to self destruct before replacing.  I do not replace my toothbrush after every single use, so I don&#x27;t see a problem with this.  A little common sense goes a long way.</li>
    <li> This is the most convienent item for reaching all my teeth and not have the floss fall apart. Pricey but worth it for a healthy mouth. And after I&#x27;m done, I snip out the floss and throw the plastic part in the recycle bin. Hey! There&#x27;s a thought!</li>
