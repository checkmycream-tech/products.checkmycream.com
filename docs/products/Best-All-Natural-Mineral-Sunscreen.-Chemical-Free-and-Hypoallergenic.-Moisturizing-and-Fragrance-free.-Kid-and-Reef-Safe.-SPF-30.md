      <li>Fantastic product!</li>
      <li>Yesterday we were out at a pool most of the afternoon (June).</li>
      <li>This product was outstanding.</li>
      <li>I received a free sample of this, but all opinions are my own.</li>
      <li>I received a free sample of this sunscreen in exchange for an honest review of the product.  </li>
      <li>Not only does it provide great protection, it moisturizes too!</li>
      <li>I am sure this product works for many people but not for me.</li>
      <li>I like how it has a creamy lather that feels more like a lotion rather than oily sunscreen.</li>
      <li>We are very picky on what we use on our toddler and this works great.</li>
      <li>I really love this stuff and smother my face, neck, chest, lips, hands and feet in it any time I can.</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>My spouse and I both love this.</li>
      <li>What I love most about it (besides the fact that its chemical free!)</li>

      <li>I was very excited to try this product that is chemical free!</li>
      <li>It goes on smooth and very easy to blend it.</li>
      <li>Great sunscreen For my 1 1/2 yo daughter and 5 yo son and myself no chemicals and rubs in clear!</li>
      <li>It is so smooth, creamy, and lovely.</li>

      <li>I have been looking for an organic reasonably priced sunscreen for 3 months and still have not found a good one.</li>
      <li>It smells great too, a light natural coconut scent.</li>
      <li>Rubs in easily.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s so easy to know it&#x27;s waterproof because you can see the water bead on your skin from the protective layer of coconut oil/beeswax.</li>
      <li>This is absolutely the best natural sunscreen out there.</li>
      <li>Tub makes it easy to get the desired amount.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s worth it to be able to use a chemical free product that I can feel good about for my whole family.</li>
      <li>I have combination skin,so it would probably be ideal for dry skin.</li>
      <li>I am pregnant and have two kids, and love that I don&#x27;t have to worry about harmful chemicals in this product.  </li>
      <li>This has a nice smell (that I notices doesn&#x27;t smell as nice when left in a hot area) but it hardens up again (but easy to pick out with your finger)  and smells wonderful again when placed back indoors.</li>
      <li>I think the review are accurate and that is why I chose this one.</li>
      <li>Yep, it is a bit greasy, but that helped me smooth it all over my squirmy guys and let me know on myself that it hadn&#x27;t washed off in the waves.  </li>
      <li>In addition to being chemical free,  its light, non greasy and really does have a nice scent.</li>
      <li>But their arms, shoulders and faces were burn/pinkness free.  </li>
      <li>Regardless, the sunscreen was not oily and went on smoothly.  </li>
      <li>I received a free sample of this that I have been using</li>
      <li>I was drawn to this sunscreen  because of the chemical free ingredients with the SPF30 rating.</li>
      <li>I ordered this product for our vacation, I been looking for an organic chemical free sunscreen.</li>
      <li>and it goes on perfectly smooth.</li>
      <li>It went on smoothly with no pores clogged .</li>
      <li>So far so good in avoiding sun-burned boys this summer.</li>
      <li>applies very easily, does not turn &amp;#34;white&amp;#34; and washes off very well.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have a light complexion, yet am a regular runner.  Since several family members have had issues with skin cancer, sun screen is a must.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried this out on my right arm and shoulder, and used my regular sunscreen on left arm and shoulder, then went on a 1 hour run in the afternoon sun.  Afterwards, I could tell no difference in sunscreen performance. However, the all-natural sunscreen did give a smoother feel, without being greasy.  It might stay on longer, but I couldn&#x27;t say for sure.  I like the new product and will continue using it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For people who are sensitive to chemicals, this all-natural sunscreen would be a must-have.</li>
    <li> LOVE this sunscreen! I&#x27;ve tried other chemical free sunscreens in the past and this one is by far the best. What I love most about it (besides the fact that its chemical free!) is that it does not leave a white residue after application. It goes on smoothly and smells wonderful!</li>
    <li> I was drawn to this sunscreen  because of the chemical free ingredients with the SPF30 rating. The Shea butter and coconut oil left my skin smelling good and moist. I was very happy with the sun blocking protection when I went running as well as cycling. I&#x27;ve also used it on my face and arms for daily moisturizer. It went on smoothly with no pores clogged . This product worked for me!</li>
    <li> I switched from using Aveeno active naturals to using  this has my daily facial moisturizer and sunblock. It works well for that because it does not leave that white film that most sunscreens do and it is full of all natural moisturizers that don&#x27;t cause breakouts. I received a free sample of this that I have been using but I would certainly purchase this product in the future.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m one of those people who burns simply looking at the forecast and breaks out hearing the word &amp;#34;fragrance&amp;#34;, so I am VERY cautious when purchasing any skin products. When I saw &amp;#34;30 SPF&amp;#34; I was a little concerned that it wouldn&#x27;t be enough, but for the first time in years I&#x27;ve been at the beach for a week, sweat and laid out in the sun, without burning or breaking out at all. Even got a little bit of a tan! The only time I&#x27;ve ever had an issue was when I didn&#x27;t use it according to the manufacturer directions. I recommend it to everyone!</li>
    <li> Worried about the stuff in the sunscreens we have been using on the kids, I decided to give this one a try.  We went to Florida for some time at the beach and pool.  Yep, it is a bit greasy, but that helped me smooth it all over my squirmy guys and let me know on myself that it hadn&#x27;t washed off in the waves.  We spent long hours in the sun and I re-applied every couple of hours.  The boys did not burn at all using this sunscreen.  Hooray!  I did get a burn, but I think I had rubbed the sunscreen off.  I also did not allow the sunscreen to soak in as much in advance on me as I did on the boys.  For the guys, I put a pretty heavy coat on their faces and let it soak in before rubbing it in all the way.  I did the same, but a bit less heavily, on the rest of their exposed skin.  It did the trick.  We leave well above sea level and in a very sunny location.  So far so good in avoiding sun-burned boys this summer.</li>
    <li> my daughter has beautiful alabaster skin.  i used pretty much everything when she joined the swim team and she just kept burning.  i also felt guilty as we had never used so much sunscreen and i&#x27;m always worried about what i&#x27;m putting on her.  after only 2 uses, this has changed her painful face.  it moisturizes as well as protects.  she&#x27;s in the pool constantly, we reapply and this product is a game changer.  highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive skin and I also love finding organic products that really work. After doing research on a new sunscreen I decided to give this one a try. The packaging was great and it arrived in time! I am located in California and desperately needed sunscreen to hold me up in this extremely hot weather we&#x27;re experiencing lately! I must say I love it so far. I&#x27;ve been using it every day and have not gotten dry skin or irritated eyes! It has a creamy texture and feels so soft and also blends in after a good five or less minutes. I will purchase again I hope they never change their formula!</li>
    <li> Goes on very smoothly and rubs completely into my skin. It also does a great job of moisturizing too. I wore it this weekend while doing yard work and it was great.</li>
    <li> I used this sunscreen this weekend for my 8 month old, 7, and 11 year old. The sunscreen worked great even with the kids going in and out of the water. I did reapply often to be safe. I love that all of the ingredients are natural and it being unscented did not bother me at all! It rubs in nicely and does not leave you feeling sticky.</li>
    <li> This sunscreen stays on very well, and a little goes a long way! I really like that it is a chemical free, mineral sunscreen.</li>
    <li> I received a sample of this sunscreen to review, and was very happy with it! I thought having to apply it from a jar would be messier and more inconvenient, but the sunscreen is thick enough that messiness wasn&#x27;t an issue. As other reviewers have noted, a little goes a long way, so I expect this jar to last awhile. Have used both in the pool and playing outside in the sun both on myself and my toddler. We are both fair skinned and experienced no burning after using this sunscreen. It has a nice lotion-y feel and while it does take a little more effort to rub in than traditional sunscreen it&#x27;s worth it to be able to use a chemical free product that I can feel good about for my whole family.</li>
    <li> This is the first sunscreen that I have been able to use on my face without irritation.  I used it on my sons as well and it held up to lots of swimming and sun at the pool.  It is pleasantly BUT lightly scented and does not sting your eyes.</li>
    <li> Great sunscreen For my 1 1/2 yo daughter and 5 yo son and myself no chemicals and rubs in clear! Will be purchasing this again</li>
    <li> Goes on creamy, no odor, natural (no chemicals), and it doesn&#x27;t make me look like an albino. Excellent.</li>
    <li> Have worn this many weeks now on my daily walk around 1 hour in Texas sun-I have very sensitive skin and this product has not caused me any skin irritation and has prevented the top area of my nose from forming a tan line around my glasses.  I love the chemical free aspect of this product-&lt;br /&gt;it applies very easily, does not turn &amp;#34;white&amp;#34; and washes off very well. Good job Yellow Bird!</li>
    <li> We received a sample of this sunscreen to review, and were very pleased.  As a family we are very cautious about what we eat and apply to our skin, especially when it comes to our children.  We also tend to be sensitive to chemicals and scents, so this chemical-free unscented sunblock really appealed to us!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We tried it out on our first lake outing of the year.  My kiddos actually really liked the smell, and my husband found it easy to apply-- the container is very easy-access.  The consistency is lotiony and it leaves the skin soft.  We had ZERO burns, and ZERO negative reactions, even on our faces. Great product!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My one qualm is the soy-based Vit E which means I can&#x27;t handle it myself since I&#x27;m allergic to it. That&#x27;s the only reason I wasn&#x27;t slathering this on; I love everything else about it!</li>
    <li> only used it once so far - works well and pleasant to use</li>
    <li> Dear whoever made this devil product:  I have never been inclined to write a review on any purchase I&#x27;ve made on Amazon (good or bad). But because I am feeling as if someone poured fuel on top of me and torched my entire body, I believe it is necessary to warn everyone who is considering purchasing this.  SEVEN of my friends used this product today, and ALL of us look like we have third degree burns. We applied it multiple times throughout the day. Personally, i&#x27;de rather use a sunscreen with ingredients like acid than deal with the sunburn I have now. A &amp;#34;chemical free&amp;#34; sunscreen is pointless if It doesn&#x27;t actually protect you from the sun.</li>
    <li> I ordered this product for our vacation, I been looking for an organic chemical free sunscreen. Well I am so upset at how bad my family got sunburn!!! We applied the sunburn and replied it twice after, we only spend four hours at the beach.  We are still in vacations and I just couldn&#x27;t wait till I got home to write this review. If you are taking the kids to the beach and want to buy this product please be carefull because we are all suffering big time now in here. The pictures I am providing are of my husband, my daughter and me.</li>
    <li> I received this as a sample and it is the first &#x27;non-conventional&#x27; sunscreen my family has tried.  I must say I am very impressed!! It is different than the spray sunscreens and the bottled lotions in many ways except one... it protects just as well (if not better!) against sunburn.  I have very sensitive skin and break out to most topical skin products, so finding a sunscreen that doesn&#x27;t cause irritation bumps on my face has been challenging in the past.  This sunscreen is a bit thicker than most conventional sunscreens, but it does not clog pores or cause any breakouts... and as an added bonus, my skin feels more moisturized than it usually does with my facial moisturizing creams!  My children also really like this sunscreen because it does not run into their eyes.  In fact, I asked my older son to finish rubbing it into his skin on his face and he accidentally rubbed some in his eyes and he said it didn&#x27;t burn or sting at all!  That is a HUGE improvement over other sunscreens we&#x27;ve used in the past.  I would recommend this product to anyone - especially those with sensitive skin and to those who need to apply sunscreen on wiggly children!  &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> I love this sunscreen!  Of course the fact that it&#x27;s fragrant free, toxic-free, hypoallergenic, waterproof, and mineral based is awesome, but I also LOVE the way it feels on my skin.  It feels like a moisturizer- instead of a thick, nasty, sports sunscreen- and goes on so easily.  It&#x27;s so easy to know it&#x27;s waterproof because you can see the water bead on your skin from the protective layer of coconut oil/beeswax. Also, my skin reacts to other zinc-based natural sunscreens and produces little bumps on my skin but it has never done that with this sunscreen. The only thing to make note of is that you *do* need to reapply every 80-90 minutes as recommended, especially if in or around water.</li>
    <li> I have hypersensitive skin and this is by far the best sunscreen I&#x27;ve ever used for my face, and virtually the only one I can tolerate.  Zinc oxide is the only active ingredient I can use, but even other zinc-only screens sometimes are uncomfortable, while this is fine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I suspect the negative reviews are from people who don&#x27;t have sensitive skin and don&#x27;t really need this product. Yes, you can see a little bit of the white although far less than other zinc products, virtually none if spread carefully. Yes. like ALL physical sunblocks it is a bit of work to remove. Yes I can feel I a little bit of grit but it DOESN&amp;#34;T STING.  So if you are one of those lucky people who can use chemical sunscreen, by all means do so, and those who need this product should ignore these reviews.</li>
    <li> Review by wife, who used this product:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was difficult to spread the clumps, and I never got as dark as I did using this sunscreen, (dark tan starting early this summer). I am even wondering if this made me tan faster (as if I used crisco oil in the sun).  (I don&#x27;t burn - I either tan without sunscreen protection, or I hardly tan, with it.)  I use a different one on my neck and face, and the color has barely changed even halfway through summer, whereas this one made my arms and legs DARK after first week or two, beginning of summer. Clumpy/sandy bits, as if the formula was hand-mixed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disappointed, would not repurchase or recommend; would have returned/asked for refund if it weren&#x27;t already too late.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2nd star for no allergic reaction.</li>
    <li> I was very excited to try this product that is chemical free! I was skeptical when I first tried this product, but I will just say that it is FABULOUS!!! I am a convert and a believer! I am VERY FAIR and my son who is a toddler is as well. We both burn terribly very easily. We both put a good layer on about every one to two hours when we are in the sun, and we don&#x27;t burn at all! I even got a tan the first time I used it! And I never tan!!!!! Recently my son and a little buddy of his had a play date in our kiddie pool. I smeared them both with this awesome sunscreen and neither of them burned! And it doesn&#x27;t hurt if it gets in their eyes. Another huge bonus! Our skin also feels so moisturized and soft after use. I would highly recommend this product to anyone!</li>
    <li> With so many skin allergies and wanting to be more natural in my approach to skin care, it is difficult to find a product that I can use and like.&lt;br /&gt;I love the fact that this is all natural and does not aggravate my allergies. It also works very well in protecting against the sun. I am a patrol officer, so finding products that do not smell or run off and irritate my eyes are hard to find as well. This allows me to perform my duties on patrol without offensive smells or irritating my eyes with run off during periods of excessive sweating. The only draw back is having to reapply every 2-3 hours depending on activity, but that it something you have to do with mainstream sunblocks anyhow!</li>
    <li> This sunscreen works great, goes on easily, and even smells great!  I am pregnant and have two kids, and love that I don&#x27;t have to worry about harmful chemicals in this product.  Very thankful to be given the chance to try and review this sunscreen, and will be ordering more when we run out.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately this product didn&#x27;t work on my 5 year old grand daughter. She got sunburned. Disappointed.  I have been looking for an organic reasonably priced sunscreen for 3 months and still have not found a good one.</li>
    <li> The texture is gritty, not smooth, with small pieces of wax or paper that have to be removed from my face.&lt;br /&gt;The jar was only 2/3 full.</li>
    <li> Great alternative to the chemical sunscreens which feel awful on my skin</li>
    <li> I received a free sample of this sunscreen in exchange for an honest review of the product.  As a mom of three children four years old and under, I am always cautious about what I am applying to their bodies as well as cautious of sun exposure.  We wear sunscreen almost daily in the summer as we spend a lot of time outside.  This sunscreen is a nice fit for us.  The size of the container is convenient to have in my bag all the time without concern of the lid popping off.  I loved the feel and scent (or lack thereof) of the cream itself.  I noticed that it took awhile for me to get it rubbed in...and for a mom of three littles this was a pretty significant drawback.  However, I think I was just applying too liberally.  After a little experience with the product, I found my children needed less, making it easier to get rubbed in.  We do have a very olive skin tone, so we did not burn with less product, but I am not sure how that would work for every family.  Regardless, the sunscreen was not oily and went on smoothly.  A very good product!</li>
    <li> I was hoping that the moisturizer would be more creamy and not leave so much white residue. When I apply it&#x27;s so white that I have to use a few dabs across my face. As I rub in, the sunscreen dries up so I&#x27;m rubbing really hard, pulling my skin way too hard. Only way I can use is to add to another creamier moisturizer.</li>
    <li> This is absolutely the best natural sunscreen out there. Not only does it provide great protection, it moisturizes too! It is not thick and pasty like many of the other natural sunscreens. My skin feels great after each use.</li>
    <li> Fantastic product! Using on myself and my 3-year-old who has sensitive, eczema-prone skin that usually dries and gets flakey with natural sunscreens. This product rubs in completely without too much effort and has not dried out her skin. Creamy texture and a little bit goes a long way. Using it on face as well as body. Very happy with the purchase.</li>
    <li> This stuff would not rub into my skin at all, it was terrible and don&#x27;t even think it worked.</li>
    <li> This is a good sunscreen.  The reason for 4 stars it&#x27;s because it leaves your skin shiny and it goes on  slightly white.  PS. I have combination skin,so it would probably be ideal for dry skin.</li>
    <li> Good quality sunscreen no harsh chemicals. Like the container too.</li>
    <li> I tried another mineral sunscreen and was disappointed that it was so difficult to rub in and left white flakes on my face that I needed to tissue off. I wondered, am I also wiping off the sunscreen? I did some additional searching and found this Yellow Bird Chemical Free Sunscreen, which promised it was easily absorbed by the skin. It is! I am thrilled and amazed. The natural ingredients also seem to be improving my skin overall. The only thing I would say is that it does feel a bit greasy if I apply too much. A little goes a long way. I give it time to sink in and then follow up with a tinted BB cream, which is compatible with this sunscreen and blends in well. I can&#x27;t speak yet to its sunscreen properties, as I haven&#x27;t spent a ton of time in the sun since I got this, but I don&#x27;t expect to be disappointed.</li>
    <li> This is way too greasy and makes my face very oily. Even after applying loose powder to get rid of the oiliness, my face is still greasy. I am sure this product works for many people but not for me. My skin type is normal. Sorry I have to return this.</li>
    <li> Greasy and leaves a chalky white residue.  Will be returning.</li>
    <li> Smells like coconut. Rubs in easily. Tub makes it easy to get the desired amount.</li>
    <li> So far, I love this stuff. I purchased this for my husband and I and another for my baby...but now I use this on him too because it smells and lathers on him so much better. This has a nice smell (that I notices doesn&#x27;t smell as nice when left in a hot area) but it hardens up again (but easy to pick out with your finger)  and smells wonderful again when placed back indoors. Because of the consistency, it seems like it will last longer than you might expect when seeing the size of the container. But still make sure to lather it on good.</li>
    <li> I really love this stuff and smother my face, neck, chest, lips, hands and feet in it any time I can. The jar seems small but it really is not smaller than almost of the lotions in tubes because it contains the same weight. The difference is that this goes much further than any others I have tried. You pay for what you get and in this particular case you get a little luxury built in as well. It leaves my skin soft, invigorated and drenched in healthy ingredients. Just place a small dot on you forehead, cheeks, nose, chin, neck and chest. Don&#x27;t forget your lips and ears. By the time you have done the dots, this scrumptious, smooth lotion has warmed up to skin temperature and spreads easily and deliciously. No white stuff unless you really goop it on and even then the white goes away in time. The slightest most delicate aroma of coconut and the whispery feel of nourishing oils makes me want to just keep applying it. And I do. Even at night! I highly recommend this lotion and I am happy to report that I have not experienced any sunburn during my hour long dog walk every morning. I don&#x27;t hang out in the sun for longer than that now that I am old enough to understand that it is simply not a good idea. For full disclosure, I am not an acquaintance, friend or family of anyone even remotely involved with The Yellow Bird company and I have not been paid to write this review. I hope my review helps make your buying decision easier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update&lt;br /&gt;October 24th, 2015&lt;br /&gt;Have been using this product as described above for over two months now. I still have some left but I am ordering more today. I am convinced that this is the best lotion for my skin. Sun or not. In addition to all the good stuff mentioned above, I need to add that it has done wonders for the skin around my eyes and I love that it does irritate them. Everything else has. It has evened out my skin tone and I even think that it has reduced my broken capillaries - the look of them anyway. I also feel veryprotected from the elements while taking long walks with the dog now that the cold winds are here. I will be using it all winter long. Thank you Yellow Bird Company. I am so glad I found you!</li>
    <li> I have only used this sunscreen once so far but I really like it. I have been searching for an all natural sunscreen and this seems to work. I live in Florida and was outside for over an hour and didn&#x27;t get burned at all. I was worried when I first got it that the jar was pretty small and it might not last long, but a little goes a long way. The container is really the only thing I can think to site as a drawback. If you are going to use this sunscreen over a large part of your body it can be a bit time consuming since you have to do it small amounts at a time to get good coverage. Maybe future packaging could be in the form of some sort of applicator almost like a deodorant stick? At room temperature its pretty thick.&lt;br /&gt;It is very white when you first put it on, but as long as you only use small amounts and rub it in well it doesn&#x27;t seem to make you look white or &amp;#34;chalky&amp;#34; like some other sunscreens do. It doesn&#x27;t have much of a scent, just a very subtle natural smell on your skin. I don&#x27;t think most people would really notice. It didn&#x27;t leave my skin feeling sticky. Just felt like I had used some good quality skin lotion. If my opinion changes after using it a few more times I will  update, but so far this product is just what I have been looking for.</li>
    <li> I use this sunscreen on both myself and my kids. It has worked very well at preventing sun burns. It smells great too, a light natural coconut scent. It goes on thick, but is easily rubbed in. It leaves the skin shiny until it soaks in, which can take a little while, but it&#x27;s not bad. I&#x27;ve been very pleased with this. I received a free sample of this, but all opinions are my own.</li>
    <li> I love it. Usually I hate sunscreen lotion and don&#x27;t use it. But this product is very different from others.  I used it all summer. And my husband loved it too.</li>
    <li> When this product arrived, I was really concerned due to the small size. (I just spent HOW much money for this tiny jar?) Then I tried it. It is so smooth, creamy, and lovely. A teeny bit goes a very long way, as it is easily spreadable. Moreover, there was no hint of a tan after sun exposure. My spouse and I both love this. Also, this is one of the very few sunscreens WITHOUT titanium dioxide or any other questionable ingredients.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been really impressed with how far the product goes. I&#x27;ve used it multiple times this summer on 4 kids. A little seems to go a long way. Yesterday we were out at a pool most of the afternoon (June). I put the sunscreen on the kids before we left around 10. They were in the sun until about 4 with most of the time in &amp; out of the pool. I forgot to reapply which I should have. When we got home, I was very impressed that there was no burn or even pinkness on any of the kids, expect for a little pink under the eyes of one of my boys. But their arms, shoulders and faces were burn/pinkness free.  The missing star would be due to the slight whiteness after application. But with zinc oxide that&#x27;s pretty unavoidable. I would much rather a little white than the red.</li>
    <li> In addition to being chemical free,  its light, non greasy and really does have a nice scent. I try to use sunblock every day and I find that this product also works well with my makeup.  I will buy it again.</li>
    <li> smells like honey and very sticky - a mosquito trap for me!!</li>
    <li> I have used this for about 2weeks and I like it. I swim for 45min and have not gotten sunburned. I like how it has a creamy lather that feels more like a lotion rather than oily sunscreen. It doesn&#x27;t clog my pores. My skin reacts well with this. My husband hates sunscreen mainly because it feels oily. I encouraged him to try this sunscreen on his neck and face. He didn&#x27;t complain! Yay! I will most likely buy this again :)</li>
    <li> I love this all-natural sunscreen!  It gives excellent sun protection and goes on very smoothly. Not only does it prevent sunburn, it moisturizes your skin.  I was very pleased with how well it worked when I was outside all afternoon.  I plan to use it all summer during my outdoor activities and trips to the beach!</li>
    <li> This product was outstanding. I recently purchased this and used it for the first time while golfing 18 holes in brutal sunlight. Not only did I not get sunburned but my skin felt moisturized and didn&#x27;t have the standard sticky, sun-screen smell that usually occurs with normal sunscreen. I couldn&#x27;t believe how well it applied, and how it made my skin feel. I would highly recommend this product for everyone, I even used it on my young daughter without fearing what weird chemicals would be on her skin. I only wish there was more than 5 starts to give it. I am forever grateful that the seller of this product has provided it to us consumers so we can take back control of the products and (lack of) chemicals we wish to lather on our bodies. Congratulations on a job well done, you are changing the world.</li>
    <li> We received a free sample and wow what a great all natural sunscreen. We are very picky on what we use on our toddler and this works great. Thanks will definitely buy when we run out!</li>
    <li> I just received this sunscreen 2 days ago, but so far I like. It goes on smooth and very easy to blend it. No smell, eyes do not sting. I think the review are accurate and that is why I chose this one. It&#x27;s just what I was looking for and I do believe I will purchase again. This is MUCH better than all the other sunscreens that I&#x27;ve tried</li>
    <li> Goes on clear. Great protection. Highly recommend</li>
    <li> I love this sunscreen! I use it every day as a moisturizer on my face before my morning routine and all I need is a small dab on my finger to apply it. However, if I&#x27;m using it for specifically being in the sun, I have to use more to make sure I am getting the best coverage. I have had this sunscreen for over a month and you can see in the attachment that I have barely scrapped the surface. Also, I have very sensitive skin on my wrists and my skin will blister if it is in the sun for too long. Today, which was the hottest day of the year, I played mini golf for about 1 1/2 hours and not a single bump appeared (see attachment). Very happy with this product and I definitely recommend it to others :)</li>
    <li> Loved this product as I used it for my face and chest. I applied it twice before heading to the pool. Great tan! I would highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> The smell is good. The texture is not as smooth as any other sunscreen. It has some small lumbs but will blend in when applying on the skin.</li>
    <li> AMAZING!!!! Unlike other natural brands I&#x27;ve tried it rubbed in nicely and easily.  It smelled like a bit of the tropics with the base of coconut oil and created a visible water resistance.  I will DEFINITELY be buying this product again!</li>
    <li> I really like the way this moisturizes my skin! The coconut smell is a bit strong at first, but I LOVE the way it smells after a few minutes. I&#x27;ve been keeping mine at room temperature inside my air conditioned house and it goes on perfectly smooth. You have to spend an extra few minutes rubbing it in compared to chemical filled sunscreen from the drugstore, but it&#x27;s worth the time. My two year old seems to like it more- probably because it doesn&#x27;t sting her eyes. It seems like no matter how hard I try to avoid getting sunscreen in my eyes it always happens (really annoying when you wear contacts). Not a problem with this! Would definitely recommend!</li>
