<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Great lotion, keeps working through frequent hand washing.</li>
    <li> This is the best hand lotion on the market. It stays on your hands, has no smell, isn&#x27;t greasy and only a little dap is needed. You can also use this on your face for long lasting moisture control.</li>
    <li> This is great stuff to use when you are crafting. Glue washes off hands easily and so does paint.  Have been using this item for numerous years.</li>
    <li> Gloves in a Bottle Shielding Lotion works, but it is not scented. I did not expected it to be just wanted to remind everyone not to expect a scent.</li>
    <li> gloves in a bottle is a fantastic product for your hands. I live in the hot desert heat of Las Vegas and I have an occupation which requires me washing my hands quite often. I was experiencing dry cracking skin. I now have soft smooth skin and highly hydrated thank you so much for this product. Try it and I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ll be a believer</li>
    <li> I first tried this product when I received it as a sample from the Home Gardening Club of which I am a lifetime member. As a gardener and as a person who performs the usual household chores (such as dishes) I tend to get dry skin (also in a dry climate) as I can not work in gloves. This product is GREAT for preventing the dryness that comes with such everyday activities. It also makes it SOOO easy to wash off dirt. The dirt does not get stuck under the fingernails. I have even taken to putting it on my feet when out playing in the summer and it helps protect my peticure! It really is a great product. And for those that find the feeling \\&quot;yucky\\&quot; all I can say is the feeling goes away and far outweighs the initial feeling. You will eventually feel your skin become supple and soft...and yes...protected. The point is tha tit PROTECTS from outside chores and daily hazards to your skin.</li>
    <li> Being somewhat germophobic, I frequently wash my hands.  I also feel the need to use antibacterial soap, which is generally worse for the skin.  Most of the year I have no problem with dry skin, but when winter rolls around the skin on the back of my hands begins to crack and bleed.  It&#x27;s annoying when people are always asking me, \\&quot;What&#x27;s wrong with your hands?\\&quot;.  I have tried various lotions, but I never saw results very quickly with them.  My hands began to hurt the other day and I decided enough was enough.  I Googled \\&quot;dry bleeding cracked hands\\&quot; and Gloves in a Bottle was the first link.  I clicked and read about the product.  It was definitely an interesting concept.  I then went to amazon to check out the reviews.  I was surprised at how many great reviews it had received. I had to try this out myself.  I found it at a local pharmacy.  After THE FIRST DAY of use, I could see marked improvement in my hands.  It has now been only two days since I first started using it, and my hands look much better already.  I also love the way it feels.  You can&#x27;t really tell you have it on.  It is like most lotions at first, but within a few minutes it dries in and doesn&#x27;t leave your skin feeling greasy.  It claims to not wash off with hand-washing.  I can&#x27;t really tell if this is true or not because I can&#x27;t really tell when it&#x27;s on my skin.  I suspect it is since it is working so well.  Either way this stuff works GREAT.  I love it so much I&#x27;ve been telling all my friends about it.  This is my second review on amazon, but I feel Gloves in a Bottle deserves it.</li>
    <li> This product penetrates and hydrates quickly and does not sting as much as some other lotions when I have cracks on my hands.  It is not greasy, so two minutes after applying, I am back at the keyboard, typing this message.</li>
    <li> Product is terrific in protecting hands from harsh chemicals used by hair stylists.  Although we have received a refund, we have communicated with seller with  no response or sight of the products yet.  Refund was due to late shipment.  Wonder if we still will get the product.  Would like response to determine if  we need to re-order from a different seller.</li>
    <li> Works great, keeps my hand protected and from drying out.</li>
    <li> Your hands will feel amazing.</li>
    <li> If you have really dry cracked hands this is the stuff. I work as an electronics technician and my fingertips are always cracked and sore. I used this stuff the first day I could visibly see a difference. The second day of use my cracks are fading away and almost unoticable. This may not help if you have a severe condition where the irritation is caused by the body attacking it&#x27;s own skin, but not much can help that, it might help but I can&#x27;t vouch for that. But for skin cracking due to insuficient moistuure, nothing beats this. I used to put cream on all day long with no help getting rid of the cracked skin. This stuff gets under the skin so even if it seems to wash off a little when you wash in reality it doesn&#x27;t. I was constantly washing my hands so the creams would just wash off. This stuff I put on once every 4 hours even though I&#x27;m washing my hands all day due to substances from work and going to the bathroom... with all the washing it STILL beats the pants of every cream I have tried, and I have tried a LOT. NOTHING beats this stuff... even latex gloves! I had been using latex gloves and cream for a long time at work and the cracks STILL would not go away. I used it also on the cracked calouses on my feet and they are disappearing too. If you don&#x27;t have severly dry hands, maybe cream is enough for you, fine. But to me, this stuff is a life saver and has put an end to years of annoying cracked dry irritation and bloodless cuts on my hands.</li>
    <li> I used it but it works just as well as other,I do like the idea it is fragrance free.  I think it was a little expensive.</li>
    <li> Works good so far, had not had the chance to really try it out. Took it to work to use and everyone wants to use the &#x27;lotion&#x27; brought back home.</li>
    <li> I was hoping for some dry skin relief, unfortunately I do not feel as though this product delivered.  Not to mention that the feel of it is very gross.  It is almost sticky when you put it on.  I felt as though I needed to wash my hands immediately after application.  I wish someone else would have mentioned how terrible it felt to the touch.  Yuck!</li>
    <li> Since I hate to wear gloves while gardening, and usually ditch them soon after starting, I decided to try this product. It worked for me. I put it on in layers before going outside and after hours of planting and digging, my hands cleaned up better than I expected. Not perfect, mind you, but definitely an improvement. I still lost my fingernails, but they cleaned up well. It has to be replenished, like bug spray, but is worth it. I did not find it greasy at all and don&#x27;t know why those who commented on that thought so.</li>
    <li> good lotion. not greasy. like the fact that it doesn&#x27;t wash off like regular lotion</li>
    <li> So amazing how it coats the skin and is the only lotion I&#x27;ve used that you can swipe your phone and not leave a single smudge mark! It really does create some kind of thin barrier and is great. I use a little bit of non greasy lotion first to moisturize, if my hands are super dry.  It does more preventive shielding than moisturizing. Great if you do a lot of hand washing all day. I really like it.</li>
    <li> The only one that really works for me and is not greasy.</li>
    <li> Before I go outside to work on the weed situations, I prepare for battle by applying Gloves in a Bottle.  So far so good, I&#x27;m pretty excited about this product.</li>
    <li> Would highly recommend this product. I suffer from contact dermatitis and it is invaluable in protecting my hands. I find I don&#x27;t have to wear gloves as much and it keeps my skin smooth. Have also used it on my face without any ill effects. A good buy.</li>
    <li> Gave as a gift and he loved it!</li>
    <li> This is great stuff. My daughter has been struggling with eczema for years and this does wonders for her hands, Quite expensive, but better than anything else we&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> I love this product and as an artist I use it all the time. It protects me from any of the harmful ingredients in my paints being absorbed through my skin. I ordered a three 8 oz. bottles to take with me to Mexico while I am out of the country working over the winter. Instead I got twelve 2 oz. small bottles. This was an unexpected and unwanted substitute. The order did arrive in time, but I would not have chosen this vendor if I knew beforehand this is what they were going to send me.</li>
    <li> Why did I not know about this product sooner?? It has no smell to speak of, it absorbs quickly and doesn&#x27;t leave an oily or greasy film.</li>
    <li> Yes! This works as a barrier to hold your natural moisture in your skin. If you think this is going to ADD moisture, then you&#x27;d be wrong...but it does exactly as it says it will. Use sparingly, but when you do, it leaves your skin feeling soft and lasts through hand-wash after hand-wash after hand-wash. It definitely protects the skin from the abuse of hand-washing. I pair it with O&#x27;Keeffe&#x27;s working hands cream, which keeps my hands soft and moisturized. Gloves in a Bottle during the day to protect my hands, O&#x27;Keeffe&#x27;s at night to moisturize!</li>
    <li> I have suffered from dry, dehydrated skin since I was a little girl. My mom used to soak me in Olive Oil for a whole our before giving me a bath when I was little. Yes, I hated it and it was very unpleasant. However, this product is absolutely amazing. I highly, highly recommend it all who suffer from itchy dry or dehydrated skin. A little goes a long way. Use right after pat towel drying after a shower. I follow it up with Aquafor by Eucerin and I am blissfully flake free and itch free. Thank you Amazon!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughter, who has extremely dry &amp; chapped skin.  I had hoped that all the great reviews for this product were not exagrated.  To my disappointment, it did not help my daughters skin, nor mind.  The only good thing I can say about this product is that it absorps into the skin instantly.  However, I found my skin still thristy for moisture.  It seemed as if I was having to reapply after every hand wash, although the bottle states \\&quot;creates a barrier for your skin, reapply every 4 hours.\\&quot;  I would suggest neurogena hand cream or if one can afford, beauticontrol extreme hand repair creme.</li>
    <li> Recommended by my doctor to help treat a persistent eczema outbreak on my hand.  He indicated he used it daily because he must constantly be washing his hands.  In combination with a steroid topical lotion, Gloves in a Bottle kept the area appropriately moist and the outbreak cleared within a couple of days.  This stuff really works and won&#x27;t wash off.  And it doesn&#x27;t feel greasy or slippery.  Excellent product.</li>
    <li> This works well. I can&#x27;t stand normal greasy feeling lotion and this stuff leaves no irritating residue. Four stars because it doesn&#x27;t seem to hydrate as well. However, it works great for keeping hands clean in dirty situations.</li>
    <li> If you have really dry cracked hands this is the stuff. I work as an electronics technician and my fingertips are always cracked and sore. I used this stuff the first day I could visibly see a difference. The second day of use my cracks are fading away and almost unoticable. This may not help if you have a severe condition where the irritation is caused by the body attacking it&#x27;s own skin, but not much can help that, it might help but I can&#x27;t vouch for that.

But to me, this stuff is a life saver and has put an end to years of annoying cracked dry irritation and bloodless cuts on my hands.</li>
    <li> I am a hairdresser and I was suffering from contact dermatitis on my hands. I had become immune to the prescription steroid creams the dr gave me. I decided to try this when I had a bad flare up that would not heal for months. I&#x27;ve only used it a couple days and it is healing!! Of course you still need gloves, the coverage is more like a lotion. But I&#x27;ve been putting it on before I shampoo and it definitely seems to do the trick. It doesn&#x27;t feel like anything on but seems almost like it&#x27;s super glueing the ulcerations and protecting and healing it. I definitely recommend it for hairdressers and contact dermatitis sufferers.</li>
    <li> Great product. Repels water. There are other  products I use to protect and moisturize my hands and this is one of them. Very similar to Emu oil, which I actually think works better than Gloves in a Bottle.</li>
    <li> I have suffered from skin allergies for years.  I would get itchy hands, arms, and legs.  Little bumps were everywhere and lotion just made it worse.  I went to a dermatologist and she gave me some lotions to try.  None of them worked.  She told me that I should take Clariton or some other allergy medication to control the skin allergies.  I was miserable.  Finally in a fit of desperation, I thought I would try something new and different.  I ordered Gloves in a Bottle, tried it on my sore, itchy skin, and within 2 WEEKS all signs of skin allergies were gone!   I can&#x27;t tell you what a difference this has made in my life.  I&#x27;m not woken up in the middle of the night with itchy skin.  I don&#x27;t have ugly red splotches on my skin.  I am at peace with my body at last!   This is an amazing product.  If you suffer from skin allergies I would give it a try.  I am not a person to write reviews, but I wanted to share my experience with other people who suffer from skin conditions like I have.  I want you to be at peace with your body too! Thank you Gloves in a Bottle!</li>
    <li> Helped get and then keep my hands healthy as a nurse in dry winter washing my hands constantly.&lt;br /&gt;Did not sting on cracked hands as other lotions did.</li>
    <li> Due to the high volume of hand washing RNs perform, we needed a product to protect our hands, yet would allow us to continue frequent hand sanitation.  Gloves in a bottle is getting rave reviews from our RNs!  Gloves in a bottle is light, fast drying and provides the protection we need.  Awsome product!!</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t imagine that any medical professional who washes his/her hands multiple times daily is actually impressed with this stuff.  I&#x27;ve used it for a couple of days and can&#x27;t find anything to get excited about.  Granted, as a PA, I wash my hands 20-40 times a day but this stuff is gone in one GOOD handwashing. It&#x27;s a very thin lotion that takes longer than I&#x27;d like to sink in.  The claim that it bonds to epithelial cells and thus stays on longer is silly.  One decent round of handwashing removes a LOT of dead skin cells.  Save yourself the money and buy some $5 Gold Bond lotion.</li>
    <li> Samples I had of this product were 100% better than this bottle that was $14. Matter of choice, but I won&#x27;t buy this again.</li>
    <li> I always have very bad dry skin during the winter months - my hands crack and bleed and it is terribly painful. I was so excited when I found this product online. The price was a little steep but the positive reviews made it seem worth it. I am so disappointed that I wasted my money on this. I put it on often throughout the day, and it has made no impact. Some reviews said it took a couple weeks to really see a difference, so I remained faithful, but I still saw no improvement. And it does not stay on after washing my hands, like the description claims. It washes off just like any other lotion. Except that it&#x27;s $13 being washed off instead of $2. I do not recommend this product at all.</li>
    <li> I have tried various lotions and this product has worked for me.  I have very dry hands and arms, I have spliting on my thumbs.  This product has been the cure for me.</li>
    <li> I was having a problem with skin splitting and bleeding on one finger. I tried lotion but didn&#x27;t get relief until I used Gloves In A Bottle. Within a couple of days the finger was healing. Now I&#x27;m totally split and pain free. I continue to use it daily but don&#x27;t need to put it on every four hours. Relief from pain has made the cost of the product well worth it.</li>
    <li> I wash my hands a lot and that really dries out my skin. I&#x27;ve had little cuts along my nails that I haven&#x27;t been able to get rid of... and little paper-cut type wounds that really hurt. Dry cracking skin is not pleasant and I hadn&#x27;t been able to find a lotion that helped at all. This is the only lotion that has gotten rid of all my cuts and has smoothed out my skin. My hands are looking younger already and they don&#x27;t hurt!</li>
    <li> I am able to dig in my black potting soil and everything just washes right off. No more disgusting black fingernails!</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful product. It is the only \\&quot;moisturizer\\&quot; that can keep my husbands hands from cracking and being painful, especially in the winter. My husband has diabetes and has a particularly hard time with dry cracked hands and fingers. He won&#x27;t use anything else.</li>
    <li> This stuff works as it says. I have Psoriatic arthritis and my fingers and thumbs crack and peel, and get really sore. Gloves in a Bottle works like they say. I helps the cracking and peeling and they are less sore. My hands and fingers are smooth and soft. It works better than my prescribed ointment from  dermatologist. I will be buying more Gloves In A Bottle in the near future. psorisis</li>
    <li> I have tried so many hand creams, to no avail.  Nothing worked.  My fingers would split open, and sometimes bleed.  So, I&#x27;d put ointment on them and bandaids.  All the lotions/creams I used made my hands slippery, so I couldn&#x27;t pick up a coffee cup without the fear of dropping it.  Gloves in a Bottle works.  No more bandaids.  It absorbs into the skin.  You only need a drop or two.  Massage your hands together, and wave them in the air for a moment, and they&#x27;ll be dry, and you&#x27;re set.  And, it lasts for 4 hours until you need another drop.  I highly recommend this one.  I&#x27;m so glad I found it on Amazon.</li>
    <li> This lotion did not do anything it promised. It has an offensive odor my daughter says \\&quot;it smells like daddys beer\\&quot;.  It actually made my hands and anywhere else I tryed it on feel much dryer.</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t make my hands 100% healed but it is the most effective lotion I&#x27;ve ever used. The cost is a bit high for only 8 ounces of lotion, especially since it&#x27;s supposed to be reapplied every 4 hours. Aside from minor problems, the lotion is great. I had two fingers that were really cracked and dry for some reason, and it became painful after some time. This lotion fixed them almost completely, something normal lotions I was using were unable to do, even products like aquaphor. All in all I was satisfied and it&#x27;s a really good product, would recommend to anyone with really dry skin problems.</li>
    <li> I referee Ice Hockey in cold rinks and had cracked fingers for over 5 years.  I tried many differnt hand creams, moisturizers and seen a Dermatologist but nothing worked.  I decided to try Gloves in a Bottle since I had nothing to lose.  During the 1st couple of months the cracking would go away and reappear but after 3-4 months the cracking went away.  It&#x27;s been over a year, I still use it every day and an occasional crack appears but it gets healed within a couple of days.  This product has been a real life saver!!!</li>
    <li> Like many people winter months are horrible on my hands.  They were red and chapped and hurt.  I found this product many years ago and it was the only thing that ever worked for me.  I don&#x27;t like lotion on my hands so it is hard for me not to wash my hand soon after having some on.  This worked for me better than any other stuff I had tried and yes I tried a bunch of silly stuff.  I think it is totally worth trying.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a gift for my sister complaining of dry hands. She was so pleased with it she bought a second bottle to keep at her desk.</li>
    <li> We have used this product for years at our house. I can not say enough good about it. I am confident that you would not be disappointed. I need lotion for my hands, especially in the winter but dislike most as they leave your hands with that greasy feeling. This product does not, yet it works very well and does the job intended it is suburb.</li>
    <li> This lotion does what it is advertised to do. An application in the morning will keep your hands moisturized throughout the day.</li>
    <li> Absorbs into the Skin......Stays effective for long stretches. Takes only a small drop, so the Bottle lasts a long time.</li>
    <li> I am  slightly disappointed in the product, it does not do what it is supposed to. It&#x27;s just mediocre at best.</li>
    <li> This is the most phenomenal skin lotion I have ever used. I was hospitalized last winter and one of the nurses carried a small bottle of this lotion in her pocket. She always used it every time after washing her hands in my room. When I inquired she shared some with me and WOW what a nice change from the lotion in our home medicine cabinet. She told me that she frequently washes her hands 30 times or more in a day. And that this was the only thing she had found that was effective. The most amazing thing to me is how soft and smooth this lotion remains on your skin with no oily after feeling. I can&#x27;t say enough good things about this product and now everybody in our house have become fans especially during the winter dry skin season. Try this truly remarkable lotion I am sure you will find if fantastic!</li>
    <li> Great product; non-greasy, lasts about 3-4 hours while working and with frequent handwashing.</li>
    <li> Not exactly sure what the hype is about this lotion. Even though it says it bonds with your skin and doesn&#x27;t come off when you wash your hands, I definitely feel like it does. My hands are dry after washing and I have to keep on reapplying it per the instructions. Well if I wanted to keep on reapplying lotion, I would just use regular cheaper a lotion rather than this.</li>
    <li> I use this when i&#x27;m drawing with my pastels.  when I use this there is a noticeable difference with how easy it is to wash the color off my hands.  I am able to use my fingers to blend colors and still feel safe about the color not penetrating my skin.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had very dry skin all my life but it&#x27;s worse as I get older.  In the winter when the air is drier I get deep cracks by my fingernails.  It feels like someone poked me with a pin if I bump one.  Sometimes my fingers throb.  Sometimes all ten fingers are involved and on both sides of the nail. I have to figure out which fingers I can use to do things with my hands.  Gloves In A Bottle doesn&#x27;t eliminate the problem but it sure decreases it.  If I use it regularly during the day and at bedtime, I usually have only one or two fingers involved and the cracks don&#x27;t become as deep.  The other benefit is less important: I can use it and chop Jalapeno peppers in the the fall and experience only mild heat. I keep stocked up on this product.</li>
    <li> I was having a serious case of contact dermititis - a reaction to something I touched but did not know what was causing it.  My hands were almost raw, the skin just kept bubbling and peeling off.  I found myself hiding my hands from people, dreading having to shake someones&#x27; hand and have them ask about the condition (people feared it would spread to them!). The medication given by my doctor did not seem to work fast enough, probably because I need to wash my hands so often at work.    After just 2 weeks of using gloves in a bottle, my hands are completely back to normal.  I keep a small container in my purse now.  I have been telling everyone about it.  I am totally satisfied with it.</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome. I work in a dry factory and during the winter my hands are often dry and crack. This stuff works amazing. I have to hide it from my co-workers because they all want to use it.</li>
    <li> If you have issues with dry cracking skin/fingers, use O&#x27;Keefe&#x27;s Working Hands. The stuff saved my butt. It&#x27;s literally a miracle. My hands are in and out of water all day. I was in terrible pain from the cracking. O&#x27;Keefe&#x27;s heals them and keeps them healed as long as I use it.</li>
    <li> I have had a noticeable difference in my hands since I started using this product.  I tend to impinge a nerve which seems to increase the dryness in my hands.  I also tend to have bad wrinkles on the sides of my fingers due to this.  Using this product seems to improve the overall moisture of my hands and helps my fingers to stay plumped out more.</li>
    <li> not as good as it claimed. Vaseline seems much better.</li>
    <li> I have periodic dermatitis. Add to that the fact that at 75 I&#x27;m well past the age of dewy skin. Mostly my skin is like the Mojave desert, and it hasn&#x27;t helped being \\&quot;cabin bound\\&quot; for the past...well, it seems like 112 months, because of sub-zero weather and wind chills. Even with a humidifier going constantly the air is dry. It does bad things to my already arid skin.  Enter Gloves in a Bottle. I bought it in a drugstore the first time and paid more than Amazon&#x27;s price. It was worth it. Then I couldn&#x27;t find it again and was happy to find it on Amazon. So this time I&#x27;m playing it safe and ordering two. I also recommend the pump (or at least a pump of some kind) because the bottle is a little stiff and if your hands are weak or arthritic the wonderful lotion can be hard to squeeze out. I would like it if they would also package it in a small purse-size tube like hand cream.  I&#x27;m going to try the 2-oz bottle for that purpose. It&#x27;s a great skin cream, not for hands only. When it&#x27;s super-cold, I also use it as on my face instead of my usual moisturizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a another reviewer mentioned, it is not fragrance-free entirely, and if a person is super-sensitive to fragrances, as is a good friend of mine, it might be a problem. On the other hand, my husband uses it, so the fragrance isn&#x27;t too noticeable as he wouldn&#x27;t wear anything with a noticeable or perfum-y fragrance. (Not a manly thing to do.)</li>
    <li> Too early to give a real review.  The lotion is light and goes on well.  The coverage isn&#x27;t all day, but I will continue to use and see how it works.</li>
    <li> I bought this to help my wife who worked in a hair salon. She is allergic to sodium laurel sulfates in shampoos but unfortunately had to spend the whole day with shampoo on her hands. After searching the web for help I stumbled upon their website, saw that it was easily available and ordered it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This works wonders. I don&#x27;t know how it does what it does, but hands and skin are protected and heal faster with this lotion. This is now one of those products that we will always have on hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lotion goes on easily, spreads easily, smells a bit of school glue. It is not greasy or sticky, and lasts for several hours. We have tried it on our hands, on our faces (small shaving cuts and the like), and things just seem to heal faster. We love love love Gloves in a Bottle.</li>
    <li> This lotion really does help with very dry skin.&lt;br /&gt;But you must use it routinely.&lt;br /&gt;If you don&#x27;t, the condition worsens.&lt;br /&gt;My hands feel baby soft when I use it routinely.</li>
    <li> This does not made my hands feels soft after days of use, better than nothing, but not worth the price.</li>
    <li> I work in a commercial kitchen, and constant hand washing, exposure to chemical sanitizers, and wet cleaning towels had irritated a part of my right hand.  It was dry and cracked (painfully so) for months.  I tried other hand lotions, but without success.  As instructed, I applied the Glove in a Bottle about every 4 hours.  In a couple of days, the dryness started to improve...in a couple of weeks, it was almost gone without even being able to see where it was all cracked before.  I would recommend this product to anyone.</li>
    <li> This product works even better than advertised!  My dermatologist recommended it in conjunction with Cetaphil lotion.  For years my hands would crack &amp; peel due to a sensitivity I have developed to a number of chemicals.  Since using this combination of products, I have had no problems at all!!  Gloves In A Bottle is a miracle product!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my Mom when she was in the hospital during the winter.  Her hands were &#x27;raw&#x27; looking to say the least as she has some circulatory issues in her extremities.  I went down to the hospital gift shop and stumbled upon this product.  I read the back and saw that if you apply it every 4 hours it provides a silicone protective shield for the hands, even in between washing.  She started using the product right away and hasn&#x27;t stopped since.  It is now a staple in her home and her hands have never looked better.  This is a product I believe in.  To see my Mom&#x27;s hands go from raw, red, cracked and bleeding to smooth and comfortable say&#x27;s it all for this product if the instructions are followed.  My Mom did and I saw for myself that it really, really, works!</li>
    <li> When I use this regularly, it helps immensely by preventing the fabric from leaching all the natural oils from my fingertips.  I hate hang nails, and this is a great tool for fighting them.  I also love that this creates a barrier to protect your skin instead of acting as a greasy balm that tries to penetrate.  You can put this on, wait for it to dry completely, and then wash your hands without having to worry about washing away the protective layer that it creates.</li>
    <li> I use this product on my face and I really like it. Makes your skin feel baby soft and last for hours. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m honestly in love with this lotion. I have tried many many many lotions specifically for my face and to give you an idea of what my face is like... I have acne prone skin, although I don&#x27;t have acne anymore, if I put on the wrong product, I will break out, that being said the lotions I have tried in the past have either irritated my skin making it super itchy or it would work but once I stopped using it for like A DAY my face would become dependent and very dry.&lt;br /&gt;This lotion doesn&#x27;t irritate my face, my face doesn&#x27;t turn red after applying it (like many other lotions have), it makes my face super soft and it actually feels moisturized! The bottle does say to apply every 4 hours which is fine by me considering it&#x27;s waterproof and what not. I honestly recommend it to anyone. I got mine at the pharmacy in Fred Meyer; they had a sample and I immediately fell in love with how it made my hands feel. There was also a $2 off coupon for them :) I&#x27;ve also provided a picture of the description it has on the bottle.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know how to be completely fair with Gloves in a Bottle because I do live in the desert so it has high expectations to live up to. Particularly in the winter, my skin is so dry and itchy, including spots of eczema. In all fairness, nothing else has &amp;#34;worked&amp;#34; to remedy it either, including all the eczema specific over the counter stuff. Gloves in a bottle helped, I believe, but nothing more substantial than the other lotions I have tried.</li>
    <li> For kids that are sensitive to paints and colors on hands as it acts like a shield.  I like it because it&#x27;s non-greasy and moisturizes well.</li>
    <li> It works well to save my hands from paper cuts! and keeps them moist!&lt;br /&gt;Very good product.  I recommend buying this one!</li>
    <li> Worked great!  Recommended to me by my cats Vet!  I would recommend it to others.  Great product!  I love it!</li>
    <li> I am 26 years old and have ALWAYS hated lotion. My hands crack and flake and burn from severe dryness as a result of excessive hand-washing. The work i do as a care-giver of children and elderly requires that i constantly wash my hands. I have tried out a million different brands and kinds of lotions and they all end up feeling sticky, greasy, filmy or just thick on my skin. and when i wash my hands after applying lotion it tends to come off in the lather. But i took a risk and bought Gloves In A Bottle after reading that it was different from lotions. I have been absolutely delighted to find out that this was actually true!! Gloves in a bottle goes on just like a lotion and says to massage it into your skin just as you would with a lotion but once its on, I have not once felt any evidence of its presence on my skin! No filmy, sticky feeling. And yet my hands have not showed any signs of being excessively dry like before. They no longer turn red and burn and they do not crack and peel! Gloves In A Bottle is magical! And has made a convert out of me!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a tough customer, I will admit. I have severe eczema on my hands and need to wash them constantly for my job. The lotion is a nice texture and not greasy feeling but I wouldn&#x27;t say it protects like gloves.  I will use it but probably won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
    <li> I have very bad excema on my right hand, such that it flakes, cracks and bleeds.  This lotion doesn&#x27;t help me any more than all the other ineffective lotions.   I&#x27;m finding what actually is working is to put Aquaphor (for baby&#x27;s diaper rash) on my hands at night and then cover them with a cotton glove.  The medical cotton gloves were too expensive, so I purchased 4 pair of regular cotton winter mittens from Target for $1.50 each - can&#x27;t beat that (and in funny colors too).  The Aquaphor is about $4.  I leave the glove on all day too, but without the Aquaphor.  Aquaphor is greasy, and I like to take my glove off briefly throughout the day (to prepare food, etc.), so I don&#x27;t want the Aquaphor on during the daytime.</li>
    <li> Was very hesitant to order this. Found out a coworker used it all the time so I figured id try it out. Seriously for dry hands this is AMAZING!!!! My hands would crack and bleed from being dry and chemicals used at work,used this before and after and wow...amazing results within a hour tops.&lt;br /&gt; My n fiance has tried this too and used prior to greasy garage jobs and it definitely makes your hands easier to clean after oil and ect!! &#x3D;)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m one of those people who won&#x27;t use hand lotion because I can&#x27;t stand the greasy or heavy way it feels.  I&#x27;m allergic to some products, and certain smells set off my asthma.&lt;br /&gt;Gloves In A Bottle leaves my hands feeling soft and dry.  It&#x27;s unscented, and its shielding quality keeps me from picking up unwanted odors.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this lotion for women or men.  So glad I discovered this product!</li>
    <li> Granted I really have only used this for about 4 days now, but I really believe this stuff does it&#x27;s job of keeping my hands safe. I have an undiagnosed skin issue that has been happening on my hands, they start off as tiny little blister/wart type things then dry up, flake off, and my skin feels like a cracking mess- I personally think it&#x27;s a form of contact dermatitis considering it&#x27;s only happening on one of my hands really. I decided to give this a try- I first put my eczema lotion on then wait 5 mins and seal it in with Glove In A Bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I got mine at riteaid, but on the official site of this company there is an option to find a store who carries it near you. I suggest doing that before ordering it online, I think I got mine for 12.75 so it&#x27;s a bit cheaper to buy it from a store I think. Anyway, this product is something I will continue to use, because my bumpy wumps are gone now and my itchy hands are doing better.</li>
    <li> Dry cuticles &amp; painful cracks around the tops of my fingers.  I tried everything, including prescription skin meds to heal them, but nothing worked.  My mom gave me a sample packet of Gloves in A Bottle to try.  OMG, works like magic.  Have searched major chain stores &amp; local places, but cannot find it anywhere. I&#x27;m placing my order here immediately!!  This stuff is fantastic!!!</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome!  I&#x27;ve never felt my hands feel so soft!  It&#x27;s no wonder that nurses use this stuff.</li>
    <li> Item was delivered fast, exactly as described</li>
    <li> Excellent.  I had a Derm recommend this product because it stays on.  Great for kids.  I use it also and it works!</li>
    <li> I like this. My husband likes it and uses it even more than I do. He sings its praises to everyone. It protects the hands when cold or wet. It&#x27;s easy to use and is not sticky.</li>
    <li> My cuticles are constantly in horrid condition from overwashing my hands (among other things), and this stuff really puts some life back into them. Two hours after applying my hands still have this smooth, soft, healthy feel.</li>
    <li> Was supposed to be 8 oz.. Was only 2 oz</li>
    <li> This is awesome stuff. It protects your hands and keeps the moisture in. I think some of the reviewers that say it didn&#x27;t work so well had extremely dry skin and should have used a moisturizer first to heal the hands. This is less of a moisturizing lotion than a barrier. If your hands or feed are badly cracked, try a couple days of raw shea butter first until the wounds heal THEN this stuff will keep them in shape for you. PS I have VERY dry skin</li>
    <li> This works as intended.. was not for me.. so I am reporting the feedback from my mother who needed it.  She approves.</li>
    <li> My skin gets so dry and chapped.  As a middle-aged woman it seems I use the bathroom 20 times a day and washing my hands that much was making them crack and bleed.  This product works.  My hands have been saved!!!  I&#x27;ve been using it for a couple of months now and a little dab goes a really long way.</li>
    <li> My husband was having to do some engine work on his truck so he asked me to buy this for him.  I thought he was crazy since I had never heard of anything like this before.  Anyway, you put it on your hands like normal hand lotion and when you have to do something that is really going to get you hands grimy, this stuff allows you to wash your hands without and residual dirt from getting around you finger nails and other parts that tend to attract and retain dirt.  I found I like it too when working out in the yard so I would have to say I would recommend to anyone who is going to be getting their hands dirty.</li>
    <li> This lotion is not greasy at all!  I fools your own skin into producing its own moisture so your skin is soft all the time.</li>
    <li> This product just plain works!&lt;br /&gt;Using it has help my hands heal from the winter cold and the constant ravages of being in water an awful lot.&lt;br /&gt;Easy to use and it really works.&lt;br /&gt;I would recommend this for anyone with dry and or cracked hands.</li>
    <li> This is the only product i will use anymore. it just works better, i use less of it than other products and get better results.</li>
    <li> This product is simple to use and provides protection for my hands which tend to become dry and crack.  Glad I bought it.</li>
    <li> Gloves in a Bottle is the best - it really does protect your hands - I have to do a lot of&lt;br /&gt;hand washing and this product reigns supreme as a skin protector .  Other moisturizers&lt;br /&gt;just wash off but not GBSL.&lt;br /&gt;It was also recommended to me by my&lt;br /&gt;dermatologist.  Thanks to Amazon for&lt;br /&gt;allowing me to find this product.</li>
    <li> Did not help at all, vasiline intensive care moisturized better. It made my hands feel funny, but not moisturized. It also washed off when I washed my hands so it doesn&#x27;t help protect them from drying out.</li>
    <li> Works better than any other product my dad has tried.  It is hard to find locally, he was thrilled when I sent him several bottles.</li>
    <li> Chronic Hand Eczema has been and issue off and on for my girlfriend for several years now, with this year being the worst.  Topical treatments have been ineffective, and the pain from splitting skin has become very annoying for her. 2 days into it so far so good...the burning pain she had has all but stopped the splits are closing up and the itching is minimal after applying.  Will update as we continue on but at the start appears this is the miracle she has been looking for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update - 5 Days - Still working well her hands are healing and the constant itching is gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4 weeks and her hands are clear - if you suffer from Eczema /skin allergies try this produce use as directed and don&#x27;t give up. No treatments were effective for her until this lotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Being a nurse she has to wash her hands frequently and now that does not create issues awesome product.  Just make sure you give it enough time.</li>
    <li> When I fist tried this product I thought that it was not so great.  I was wrong though.  I spend many hours in an aqua fitness class and my hands were cracked and very dry.  If you use Gloves in A Bottle before putting your hands in water, it stays on and does not wash off.  Thus keeping your hands constantly moisturized.  I now even use this on my legs before getting into the pool.  Wonderful product.</li>
    <li> Living in Colorado has its ups and downs.  One of the real downers is how dry my hands get.  I have scars on my fingers, joints, and fingertips where the skin has dryed out and bled with much pain and agony.  I have tried at least 100 different lotions and home remedies. Putting bandaids on everything works ok but its hard to type with bandaids on every finger.  This stuff has made a difference.  It is like a liquid bandaid, but it smells good (no fragrance it just smells good), and seals up the spit tissue so it can heal from the inside out, just like the dermatologists recommend.  I like it.  Your mileage may vary.  I knocked off one star because it is too damn expensive, but it is good stuff, so I guess you get what you pay for eh?</li>
    <li> I can use this at work and still be able to write.  In addition, it doesn&#x27;t feel like you&#x27;ve got slime on your hands, you don&#x27;t leave grease marks all over everything.</li>
    <li> I bought this stuff at the recommendation of a pharmacist when he saw my fingers with band aids on nearly every finger due to cracked, bleeding, cuticles. It is incredible. It doesn&#x27;t smell, dries instantly, leaving no greasy residue, and it works! I have been through many products over the years, even making my own, but this is by far the best I have ever used. I am allergic to lanolin and most products with glycerin are super greasy, so this is just fantastic. After three days of using it just twice a day, my cuticles showed significant improvement, after a week I was able to go for a manicure! I absolutely love this product and it certainly works for me! It is expensive for hand cream but the money I&#x27;m saving on not having to purchase band aids more than compensates.</li>
    <li> Using this lotion along with some Desoximetasone (0.25%) which i was prescribed by my Dr, it has helped clear up some serious cracking on my finger tips that no other cream or lotion has been able to do for over 4 years. I tried everything and at last this combination has worked. I will keep applying Gloves in a Bottle as it drys quickly and leaves no sticky residue like other less effective products..</li>
    <li> Great product... highly recommend for anyone who does not like a greasy feeling from lotion... not your typical hand lotion...</li>
    <li> This product really helps me with my sensitive skin problems. Please continue to make it.</li>
    <li> Return customer to this product. We have been using Gloves in a Bottle for over 5 years. All four in our family love it. Don&#x27;t really buy much other lotion but usually, we&#x27;ll keep raw shea butter around. Between the two - we cover all our moisturizing needs!</li>
    <li> Great if you wear gloves all day.  I am a dentist, and this product really helped my hands.</li>
    <li> My wife says it&#x27;s the best moisturizing cream she has ever used.  She applies it once a day and it lasts the whole day.</li>
    <li> I love gloves in a bottle and you are the only ones now that sell it. I have been looking for it for a long time when I saw it on Amazon. It is a great product that leaves your hands feeling so smooth an soft. Thanks again for having that product available.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product because my hands really started to get dry and this product has really helped to keep them moisturized.</li>
    <li> My dematologist recommended Gloves in a Bottle for my eczema. I was sceptical at first of an over the counter option but after 2 weeks I am hooked. I have ordered another bottle to keep at work.</li>
    <li> My husband is a software engineer and has really dry cuticles that peel and crack but hates anything that makes his fingers sticky or greasy because it makes his keyboard nasty. He has tried many different products but this is the first one he has nothing negative to say about. Now he just needs to remember to use it.</li>
    <li> Thera-seal is a much better skin protectant, although the price of Thera-seal is much higher.  It is easy to apply &amp; dries quickly.</li>
    <li> If you are the type that washes your hands often, I highly reccomend this product. There is a local place to buy, however by ordering on Amazon I saved money and it came right to my doorstep.    Thanks!</li>
    <li> Buy it every winter for my husband with eczema. He swears by it!</li>
    <li> I do not often find myself compelled to write a review unless I discover something amazing.  I have for many years suffered from dry, rough, cracking and bleeding hands.  I am OCD about washing my hands.  I wash multiple times a day.  I have tried many different kinds of hand creams, balms, lotions and even prescription treatments however NOTHING and I do mean NOTHING has come close to the amazing results I have experienced in THREE DAYS with this miracle lotion.  I am amazed at how my normally extremely dry hands are now soft.  The cracks are almost healed....I no longer see dry patches...my cuticles are looking better than ever and this is with just THREE DAYS of use.  I am absolutely floored by this concoction.  If you are one who experiences pain from dry and bleeding hands as I have for years past then do yourself a favor and buy this lotion NOW!!!!  You will not be disappointed by the results.  I will never ever be without this stuff again.  Totally worth the money for the relief you will get from it.</li>
    <li> Helped to clear up my dry skin due to eczema! Love love love this lotion!</li>
    <li> Wonderful product at a reasonable price.  Feels great on my hands.  Not at all greasy.  I use it often when knitting and sewing by hand.  Yarn and thread glides smoothly through fingers when this product is used!  Never have to be concerned about transferring oily residue to fabrics.  I will make certain I do not run out of this product!</li>
    <li> The first time I used this I was using a chemical acid paint stripper on some old lead painted windows. Some of the paint stripper dropped onto my arm and I immediately panicked, (I had been burned by the same chemical before.) This time however- Gloves In A Bottle bought me some time before the acid burned my skin. Nothing happened! No burn at all- that&#x27;s when I was convinced this stuff is an awesome product. I use it on my arms, hands, feet and legs whenever I do yard work (I have a skin allergy to the grass in my yard and It makes me itch like crazy if I even touch it) I can now walk on my grass, do yard work, garden- with zero allergic reaction. Great product.</li>
    <li> I love this lotion.  I quilt for a living and the constant contact with fabric makes my hands very dry.  I keep a bottle of this in my studio and I use it several times throughout the day.  It dries quickly and isn&#x27;t greasy so it does not get on the fabric.</li>
    <li> Previously I was only able to obtain this lotion at Kaiser Hospitals but thanks goodness it was available for purchase on Amazon and at a very affordable price.</li>
    <li> Only thing that cured my cracked hands in the winter. I had to use all the other lotions with liberal applications and often throughout the day. Once a day after showering and I was good. A lifesaver!</li>
    <li> Great product. Protects hands.</li>
    <li> Great product, worth the price for me.  One of the only lotions out there that does not irritate my sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> I have very dry skin and a light case of eczema.  Gloves in a Bottle softened my hands and cleared up the red patches on my hands.  It is not greasy and absorbs quickly.  I also used this on my son&#x27;s hands who also has very dry skin and redness from eczema.  It also softened and cleared up his hands.  I would highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I have thyroid derived dry skin problems especially with my hands.  I primarily bought this for my hands, but have used it on my face and it works wonders.  I love that it doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy residue and is absorbed quickly.  I would highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I have scleroderma which causes skin tightness, dryness, peeling. I read on scleroderma forums that this product worked well for other scleroderma sufferers, so I purchased it. Upon application, the product feels silky and smooth and nice. But it still left my hands dry and when i would eat something my food tasted soapy from the product. I only used it twice and stopped using it (opting for aquaphor instead). Eh, this just didnt work for me.</li>
    <li> The seller was prompt and the price was competitive.  If I were going to buy this product again, I would buy it from this seller.  However, I won&#x27;t be buying this product again because I believe it has changed from when I first bought it about 5 or 6 years ago.  I purchased this product in Boston originally and it was amazing.  The product I bought most recently doesn&#x27;t seem nearly as rich or effective as the older formulation.</li>
    <li> this product is noticeably different immediately.  it soaks in quickly and lasts for hours through several hand washing but never feels greasy.</li>
    <li> Has really helped my hands this Winter.  My new fave lotion! A little goes a long way.  Would recommend trying it.  Love that it is fragrance free...</li>
    <li> Some have remarked on the price as pretty high. By the ounce it is a little expensive, but by the application it&#x27;s a bargain. The instructions say that a pea sized drop will do the job and that is definitely true. I got a free sample which consisted of two envelopes  each with a fraction of an ounce.So I was very careful to try to get by with the minimum amount. I&#x27;ve had cracks in the skin near the nails at the end of my fingers and thumbs. Painful and exasperating as well resistant to everything I&#x27;ve tried. These samples had cleared up the cracks before I could use them up and before I could get a full 8 oz bottle. Try it!</li>
    <li> As a auto mechanic I tried this when I couldn&#x27;t find what I normally use.  It&#x27;s okay.  It dries fast, almost instantly.  My wife likes it.</li>
    <li> This stuff is the best, I have tried all kinds of lotions and stuff during the winter months here in NJ and nothing works as well as this stuff..... I LOVE IT..... I use it every day and my hands do crap and itch from the cold winter weather...... simply put, this is GOOD.... you deserve to give it a try, far better then anything else on the market</li>
    <li> Every winter the house dries out and so does my skin. Tried multiple over the counter lotions and oils and this is by far the fastest acting and longest lasting I have found.</li>
    <li> It didn&#x27;t totally prevent the irritation that comes from my ring, but it helped.</li>
    <li> It is for my husband, his doctor had him get it to put on legs before putting on compression socks...keeps from itching &amp; breaking out...had tried a couple other products that did not work....</li>
    <li> This was a gift but I see her using it all the time, so I guess it is a good product.  By the way she was out and requested some more.</li>
    <li> It is just as it says a glove on my hand during this harsh Winter.</li>
    <li> Really disappointed. I have eczema and I was hoping this would help, but I felt like it did nothing.</li>
    <li> Best lotion out there for everyday use. Does not grease up the hands. My husband uses it now as well. No odor to it either.</li>
    <li> Gloves In A Bottle Shielding Lotion healed my chapped hands and made them much smother and softer to the touch.  I have used it in the past for severely chapped hands.</li>
    <li> I work in maintenance and my hands are constantly being washed. This stuff is great especially in the winter when my hands dry and crack. Gloves in a bottle has pretty much stopped that all together.</li>
    <li> It really helps in the winter when my hands are dry and cracking.  It gives another layer of protection as my hands are in water a lot.  I would definitely recommend this to others.</li>
    <li> After becoming allergic to vinyl gloves used at the hospital where I work, my hands became incredibly dry, chapped, and peeling.  I tried all the standard (and not so standard) moisturizers available in stores, everything from Eucerin to Neutrogena to Workingman&#x27;s Hands.  None of them worked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This one does.  My hands are back to normal.  I am so grateful for this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What&#x27;s more, a very modest amount suffices to moisturize my hands for hours at a time, so it is in fact quite cost-effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will continue to use this produce for the rest of my life.  I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Not any different than a grocery store type of lotion. I had high hopes for this product because it had been recommended by a neighbor, but my hands still get dried and there are cuts in my fingers as usual. No improvement after using this product for several months.</li>
    <li> feels a little odd when you first put it on but as it dries its ok.&lt;br /&gt;It claims to not wash off you cant prove it by me.</li>
    <li> UPDATE:  Still using Gloves in a Bottle twice each day, morning and night.  My hands are soft despite the winter cold and dryness and I have had no issues whatsoever with my fingertips cracking and bleeding as before.  An added bonus (and certainly not one mentioned anywhere I&#x27;ve seen) has been my fingernails!  I have always had problems with my nails being dry and splitting and peeling.  I always wanted to have beautiful nails but despite trying numerous products \\&quot;guaranteed\\&quot; to correct the problem, nothing worked. Now that I&#x27;ve been using Gloves in a Bottle regularly, they have started getting stronger and looking healthier.  Lately, they have not split or peeled like before.  I can&#x27;t say enough positive things about Gloves in a Bottle!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like many other reviewers, I have struggled every winter with dry, cracked skin.  I would get extremely painful cracks at the edge of my fingernails and on my fingertips that were so deep they would bleed.  It became difficult to button or snap my clothes.  I tried EVERYTHING over the years.  Every kind of cream, lotion, oil, etc.  At a friends suggestion, I even went to the local farmstore and purchased Udder Balm!  I would smear all these various concoctions on my hands at night and cover them with white cotton gloves while I slept (my husband dubbed me \\&quot;Minnie Mouse\\&quot;).  Absolutely nothing worked.  While researching--yet again--what I might do to alleviate this painful condition, I found a mention of Gloves In a Bottle.  Trust me, I was very skeptical as I had been disappointed so many times, but desperation won. I immediately looked on Amazon and found it available.  I purchased my first bottle and am amazed at how quickly it has healed the cracks on my hands.  Within a few days, all were almost gone and no new ones have developed.  I do not put it on every four hours as indicated on the bottle but always do it at least morning and night and other times as I think of it.  I have now ordered two more bottles and a small one to carry in my purse.  I am a believer!</li>
    <li> Wow... i started working in a salon full time about a year and a half ago. Since then, eczema (that i had not experienced since childhood) has been raging on my sensitive hands. I wasnt able to allow my hands any time to recover since i have been in water on a daily basis. Even when i used gloves to shield my hands/wrists from chemicals, they seemed to break out even more ... i&#x27;m assuming i either have a latex sensitivity or my eczema doesnt appreciate being suffocated...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It took a bit, but gloves in a bottle really helped control my contact dermatitis/eczema. I was a bit apprehensive, since i tend to try to stick with more \\&quot;natural\\&quot; remedies, but after exhausting all options, i tried GIAB. I have to apply it more than reccommended since i am constantly in water, but it leaves my hands so smooth. I wish the price wasnt so high, but i guess i&#x27;ll have to deal with it, since it has been the only product to work...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I even tried going back to my old natural remedies, once my hands started to recoup........ BIG mistake. It flared up way worse, i lost my ultra soft hands, and i&#x27;m back to GIAB... why did i stray??</li>
    <li> The best skin lotion by far</li>
    <li> Fabulous product.  Heavy allergies to drywall and this protects my hands wonderfully on construction sites.  Just keep with you and use often!</li>
    <li> I absolutely swear by this lotion.&lt;br /&gt;I work as a CNA, and my hands are dry all the time if it wasn&#x27;t for this product.&lt;br /&gt;No fragrance either, so patients/residents won&#x27;t be irritated by it.</li>
    <li> Great Product..Great Price!!&lt;br /&gt;For Anyone Who Washes Hands Repeatedly!!!&lt;br /&gt;Works Great!!!</li>
    <li> My Husband has terrible eczema on his hands and this has been the ONLY product that has helped. If he doesn&#x27;t use it daily his hands get very cracked, this product improves the condition and prevents further cracking.</li>
    <li> The only lotion that helps my skin</li>
    <li> I had an allergic reation to an antibiotic and ended up wtih severe echezma so I tried this product it was great. It helped sheild my hands from the weather, drying out and helped with the healing. Good product.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product on and off for a few months and I haven&#x27;t really seen an improvement in my dry hands. I have an infant so I wash my hands close to a million times a day and was looking for something that would elminate my dry, cracked skin. In the beginning I used it as directed, even took it to / from work each day, and I still didn&#x27;t see a significant improvement. I now use it when I remember, maybe once a day, and am back to using my regular regime, Cetaphil lotion.</li>
    <li> I like how it makes my hands soft and seems to last longer.  I recommend trying it to see for yourself.</li>
    <li> I bought this product at a retail store. My best friend had heard great things about it and there was a tester, so I tried it on--and it was wonderful! It helped soothe my hands, which were itchy and scaly from dyshidrotic eczema. So, despite the high-ish price, I didn&#x27;t hesitate to buy a small bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The effects of the lotion were great...at least initially. My hands felt protected and started to feel smoother and less irritated. But after a few days, I started noticing that putting the lotion on didn&#x27;t seem to have any effect anymore. My hands would feel dry shortly afterward.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I went to my dermatologist and mentioned that I was using this lotion, but he didn&#x27;t seem impressed. He prescribed some medication, which I used to clear up the eczema. Then I went back to using Gloves in a Bottle, since I figured it would be better now that it wasn&#x27;t also trying to battle a skin condition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I normally put it on after I wash my hands. The instructions say to wash skin, dry and then apply the lotion, working it in well and allowing it to dry. I&#x27;ve done this, but still, a few minutes after putting it on, my skin feels dry and kind of tight again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My go-to is Neutrogena Hand Cream, which has a thick almost ointment-like consistency, but absorbs quickly and actually does make my hands feel moisturized. I&#x27;m sticking with that.</li>
    <li> Not at all as effective as they portray it to be, it is merely a simple lotiony type thing not a skin barrier like they claim.</li>
    <li> If you have sensitivity to chemical smells like I do.. you will likely find this product unusable.&lt;br /&gt;CFS/FM? Beware.&lt;br /&gt;Gave me an awful headache, irritated sinuses and slightly irritated eyes.&lt;br /&gt;2 stars because it did reduce touch sensitivity for my hands.. Unfortunately the Fragrance-Free part is wrong... just because it might have none added doesn&#x27;t make the ingredients smell any less powerful or chemically piercing.</li>
    <li> This lotion provides a good protective coat that lasts for a couple of hours.  I am a health care worker and I wash my hands frequently, so it&#x27;s nice to wear something that helps keep my hands from drying out.  It is more expensive than I would usually spend on lotion, and I wish it would last longer than 2 hours or so -- but for those who aren&#x27;t handwashing every 15-20 minutes (or more!), it may last longer.</li>
    <li> maybe if i were dealing with harsh chemicals everyday, this would actually be of some use. I thought this could just protect my hands on a daily basis but I felt as if after I applied it in the morning it would block and lotions or hand treatments I would try to apply later would just not absorb and my hands just kept getting drier and drier. It was just awful.</li>
    <li> My hands are constantly dry and from the claims I read I thought this would solve my problem.  I did not find that it corrects the dryness or protects any better than other lotions I have tried.  I rated it three stars as &amp;#34;it&#x27;s okay&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> The first couple of days I used this I didn&#x27;t think it was working. In fact, I thought it was causing more irritation.  However, I was using it wrong.  Apply a relatively thick hand lotion or cream first, then put a little of this on over it about twice a day, and your hands will be healed in 1-2 days.  I couldn&#x27;t believe it.  I have struggled with cracked, painful, dry hands nearly all year &#x27;round due to sensitive skin, and this really helps.  You have to use it daily to keep your skin healthy, though (at least in the winter).  So at the very least, apply it as described before you go to bed each night.</li>
    <li> The lotion is okay, but hasn&#x27;t help heal the cracks in my hands.</li>
    <li> I have been using Gloves in a Bottle for several years now (I like it so much I bought a gallon bottle).  It is perfect for me as it is not greasy once it dries.  I&#x27;m able to put it on and then knit or crochet without getting some greasy lotion on my yarn.  Plus it is the only thing that has healed my cracked fingers in the winter.  Perfect for the dry climate here.  My hands also feel nice and smooth after using.</li>
    <li> I paint &amp; can&#x27;t stand it when some paint doesn&#x27;t wash off my fingers &amp; contaminates my contacts when I take them out.  This took care of that.</li>
    <li> I recently bought this product at a local yarn store and it is incredible.  I only bought a small bottle so decided to check Amazon for it.  I was surprised by the negative reviews here.  My hands feel soft and smooth just like the product says.  There is a bit of an odor but nothing offensive and it goes away immediately not lingering on my hands.  I think we all have different reactions to products.  Don&#x27;t let the negative reviews turn you off...try it.  I will buy more.</li>
    <li> Using this lotion as a barrier against allergens and it&#x27;s working besides being a moisturizer! You only have to use a little so it&#x27;s more cost effective than at first glance. A big winner!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my husband who suffers from dry crack fingers and after 3 days of continuous use he is definately seeing an improvement. The cream goes on smoothly without any greasy residue and protects depending on how often you wash your hands. It does create a good barrier from harmful elements which in my husbands case is cardboard that zaps the moisture out of his hands leaving them to dry out and cause painful cracks. He suggested using a good hand moisturizer then applying Gloves in a Bottle to lock in the moisture. I&#x27;d say the only downfall to this product is the price and I only say that because it can become costly depending on how many times a day you have to re apply BUT considering how quickly it seems to be repairing his hands it might only be a short term investment. Bottom line is it works so don&#x27;t hesitate to buy because it isn&#x27;t a waste!</li>
    <li> This product is more runny then what I prefer. I read reviews saying that this product is so great, but I honestly didn&#x27;t find it any better then cheap lotion you can buy at walmart. I personally prefer my moisturizing lotions to be thick and creamy. This lotion is quite the opposite.</li>
    <li> This lotion is a good exfoliate, it&#x27;s not very moistizering. It is also pretty expensive. I would try something else before I ordered again.</li>
    <li> I, like so many diabetics, have problems with my skin cracking and bleeding. I wash my hands frequently and in winter my skin breaks open, looking and feeling like rough, bloody sandpaper. I&#x27;ve tried everything, including soaking my hands in warm water, smearing them with Vaseline, and then wearing vinyl gloves to bed. Blech! This stuff was on sale at the prescription counter, so I gave it a try, despite its expense. And it was FANTASTIC!  A small amount (the size of an almond) was enough to coat both hands. After rubbing it in thoroughly, it almost instantly dried: no greasy feel or residue to stain fabric or solid surfaces. All one can see is a shininess to one&#x27;s skin. In three days all the cracks had closed. After a week, my hands were smoother than the rest of me. No more sandpaper skin! BUY THIS STUFF, NOW, You will love it. If you don&#x27;t, send the unused portions to me! {;-&amp;#62;)</li>
    <li> I will preface this review by saying I have been suffering from eczema for 12+ years. If you also suffer from eczema, you know how desperate you are to find a product that will just make it go away. This product did not help me and I was extremely disappointed. It actually seemed to make my skin *drier*! If you have normal skin that tends to get dry in the winter or something, this might work for you, but it did nothing for me.</li>
    <li> Protect  your hand very well.</li>
    <li> Does not heal or replenish skin.  This is intended to make a barrier, which it does well, and helps greatly when dealing with soaps, dust, dirt, chemicals, or other things that cause skin irritation.  Use this for eczema, after healing lotion (Hoofmaker or Aveeno stress relief with oatmeal) is applied, dried, and absorbed.  Note that it does have a weak scent, similar to Elmer&#x27;s Glue.</li>
    <li> They&#x27;ve changed the formula since the first time I bought. I won&#x27;t buy again. Though I don&#x27;t see fragrance or perfume listed in the ingredients, something in it now has a scent while the first time it did not.</li>
    <li> love it, been a regular user for years! thanks</li>
    <li> It really protects your skin and I notice a great difference. My skin is much softer, I will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> Best hand treatment ever. I work in the trades and suffer from slit fingers for about 6 months out of the year.</li>
    <li> So far the Gloves in a bottle is working ok . I like the way my hands feel after I apply it.&lt;br /&gt;My job is tough on my hands so I&#x27;m not expecting miracles but its working better than expected.</li>
    <li> We really appreciate what this lotion has done for us this winter. It has solved a problem that we have lived with for a long, long time. We have tried a multitude of lotions over the years to help with the cracking &amp; dry skin problem with very little success, until we were had Gloves in a Bottle recommended to us.&lt;br /&gt;We can&#x27;t say enough good things about the lotion. It is wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;We felt that we couldn&#x27;t give it a 5 star, because that would give it a perfect rating. It is definitely a 4.5.</li>
    <li> Day before yesterday, my knuckles were bleeding, the backs of my hands down to my wrists red and cracking. Yesterday, I bought this, and began applying it every 4 hours, as the directions suggest. My hands are almost completely healed, and most certainly are not bleeding anymore. I&#x27;ve been trying different products every winter for years, and this is the only one that&#x27;s worked. I just can&#x27;t believe it worked so quickly!</li>
    <li> Not only does this smell awful, but it doesn&#x27;t work! My hands dried out so bad and became very itchy. Wish I had bought the sample size! Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> Having suffered with dry weeping sore hands for years and spending a small fortune on products and prescriptions, I can safely say gloves in a bottle is by far the best I&#x27;ve come across, it was money well spent.&lt;br /&gt;I needed a cream that locked in moisture and this did the trick, its soothing absorbing slightly runny texture brings instantly bring relief to sore dry hands. I recommend highly to others</li>
    <li> We don&#x27;t know what we&#x27;d do if not for Nexcare Skin Crack Care and this Gloves in a Bottle. It really protects the hands from getting worse over the course of a work day.  We found it in a hardware store originally (in a tiny bottle) and when that ran out, it was at Amazon, as luck would have it.  The seller shipped it right away, so we only had a to go a day without.</li>
    <li> works great is helping my psoriasis.dont hesitate to try this product.I am reordering more of this I don&#x27;t want to run out.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t tell how this product works, as I can&#x27;t get beyond the smell.  Once I got it onto my hands, I could smell the faint scent of... Insecticide.  If you are at all scent-sensitive, steer clear.  If I could give less than one star I would.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a &#x27;senior&#x27; and I didn&#x27;t know if this would help my aging skin at all.  My hands will get a nasty red bruise with the slightest bump, so when I&#x27;m cleaning hard or moving a lot of stuff around I end up with awful, monster-looking bruised hands.  My hope was this would help with that (because of the &#x27;protection&#x27; factor), but it did not really work for the bruises.  However, with religiously regular use (about every 4 hours), it softened my hands quite a bit and they looked less wrinkled.  I&#x27;m not terribly good with applying stuff to my body regularly, and even though I use it only about 2-3 times per day, it still helps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried it on my face and it stung pretty good and made my eyes water, so I don&#x27;t do that anymore, but I do use it on my old, wrinkled arms and it does help some.  The scent is very slightly chemical, but that goes away very quickly.  I will continue to use this (just ordered my second bottle) and recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ladies, don&#x27;t wait til you&#x27;re old and wrinkled to use this!  Start NOW!  :)</li>
    <li> received this as a sample years ago and it works great. It keeps water out and my skin moist. I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> I love this lotion!!! My hands are so nice and smooth using this lotion. It has resolved my scratchy dry skin from havng my hands in water also the cold weather dries my skin. You won&#x27;t be disappointed, it leaves no oily residue. If you have dry skin or just want your hands and body skin luxuriously smooth : )</li>
    <li> Have no doubts, this is the ONLY thing that works.  It creates a coating over your hands and isn&#x27;t slick once it dries (ONCE IT DRIES.)  Well worth the price!  And a little goes a long way, my first bottle lasted me two years.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing.  I first discovered it eight years ago in the gift shop of a hospital when I was visiting my grandmother.  I just needed lotion and this was all they had.  It&#x27;s all I ever use now.  I&#x27;ve never liked regular lotion because it leaves my hands feeling slimy and smelling awful.  This is relatively odorless and it leaves my hands feeling smoother than I ever thought possible.</li>
    <li> didn&#x27;t like... didn&#x27;t think it created a sheild</li>
    <li> I machine fiberglass every day and it doesn&#x27;t work</li>
    <li> Pump helps you use less - you don&#x27;t need a lot.  Stays on a long time.  Fills in rough patches, even cracked skin.</li>
    <li> this stuff is amazing.  Does not feel greasy and yet seems to soften the skin well.  I gave bottles away as Christmas stocking stuffers this year and everyone loved it.</li>
    <li> Great feeling and for the price was very good purchase.  I ended up having to get a prescription lotion. but this helped until I was able to get in to see the doctor.</li>
    <li> Wonderful product-I use on hands and face.  Really has made a difference in the skin on my face.</li>
    <li> I gave it two days and just not working for me. For 1.5 days I tried this and left me needing to apply another type of lotion to compensate for my dry hand.</li>
    <li> It smells rancit, I have had Glove in a Bottle that is older than 3 years that doesn&#x27;t smell like the one I received.</li>
    <li> I am a nurse practitioner and wash my hands A LOT every day. I have been looking for a hand cream or lotion that will prevent painful cracks in skin especially in winter. I have followed application instructions, but this does not work as says in advertisement.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m happy with this product. I will continue with using it. But I will keep looking for something better that works better...</li>
    <li> I bought this product to use when I work in my yard and garden, since wearing gardening gloves makes it difficult to do fine manual work.  I rub it on and let it dry a bit before going out to work.  I&#x27;m pleased that it offers some protection for my skin and nails, and that I&#x27;m not allergic to it (a problem with lots of skin products).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish that I could tell how much it really helps.  You can&#x27;t see it or feel it when it&#x27;s dry.</li>
    <li> It keeps my skin moisturized. I even apply it at the bottom of my feet after shower while my skin is still damp. I will reorder again.</li>
    <li> love it, does what it says it&#x27;s going to do and I can&#x27;t tell I have it on once its dry. All the people at work love it too, so I will be buying it again very soon!</li>
    <li> very pleasant, absorbs quickly</li>
    <li> This stuff works really well!</li>
    <li> i have dry skin and gloves in a bottle does the trick.  not too greasy either.  i would def recommend.</li>
    <li> I had cracked hands and it was terrible for healing that.  I even tried it with gloves.. blech.. I am going to go back to trying No-Crack and shea butter..</li>
    <li> Kind of happened upon this for my face.  I started using it on my hands, because they would dry and crack open in the winter cold.  Long story short, I am on new meds for my Rosacea, which are doing a fabulous job to help with rosacea, but are making my face dryer than normal, so today i thought \\&quot;why not try the Gloves in a Bottle,\\&quot; since I love it so much on my hands?  I literally just came back from the bathroom and applying it and then put on my concealer over top of it.  It looks amazing!  :)  AND it&#x27;s helping with my dry, itchy face!  LOVE IT!  I will now by the larger bottle, so I can use it everywhere!  :)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Terry</li>
    <li> This is not all that it&#x27;s cracked up to be.  I have had better luck with the lotion made by the company who makes the little yellow pot of lip treatment.  Would not buy again.</li>
    <li> This lotion is very gentle for the hands.  I use this when I use pastels and it is amazing at how well the paint will come off.</li>
    <li> The only lotion that takes away the tightness feeling on my dry skin all day. Other lotions only temporarily takes the tightness away. I purchased  extra bottles to send my sister overseas.</li>
    <li> I really wanted to give this lotion five stars but just couldn&#x27;t.  It doesn&#x27;t do any more than any other lotion for me.  In fact, I have others that cost about one-fourth the price of this and perform better.  This lotion DOES dry quickly and IS non-sticky, but so what?  Others do as well at a much less expensive price.  I could not give it more than three stars.  However, I COULD give myself ONE star for falling for a dream in a bottle.  I find it feels slick and leaves my hands shinney.</li>
    <li> This stuff works, and it doesn&#x27;t really feel like I have anything on my skin. I bought if to protect my very sensitive skin from irritants,and it worked better than I hoped. Some things I do cause my skin to rash, welt, and even get infected from allergic reactions to ordinary things. With this on, my skin feels just a little slick (barely noticeable) but then it doesn&#x27;t rash up at all. This doesn&#x27;t just help, it solves the problem completely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I put some on and worked with superglue, which always gets on my skin no matter how careful I try to be. I normally end up with that odd stickiness that won&#x27;t wash off and doesn&#x27;t go away for days. This time, I got some on my skin and it felt tacky like always, but when I finished and washed my hands, there was no trace whatsoever. I&#x27;ll never use superglue without this stuff again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It seems to be true that it doesn&#x27;t wash off, but it feels like it gets a little less protective. I&#x27;ve washed my hands a couple of times and still handled stuff that would irritate my skin without issue. However, if I were going to handle something really harsh after washing, I think I&#x27;d re-apply just to be safe. Once my skin breaks open, it takes a long time to heal so I don&#x27;t want to risk it. If you don&#x27;t have a severe problem, I&#x27;m sure you can count on this for at least 24 hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You need very little to get coverage (maybe 1/4th what I&#x27;d use for hand lotion), so this bottle will last a long time. Buy it.</li>
    <li> this works well not only for hands and fingers- but heels and feet also. I got 2 2oz bottles, and now buy the big one to refill. Have them in the den, by the garage door and in the bathroom so they are always handy</li>
    <li> Perfect for protecting hands from pastels,  easy to wash off. Great if you don&#x27;t like using gloves to do your artwork and don&#x27;t want tinted fingertips.</li>
    <li> It is the only lotion that helps the eczema on my hands ! Better than what the MD perscribed. I have one bottle at work and one at home.</li>
    <li> Overrated, in my opinion. It doesn&#x27;t seem much different from any other lotion. It washes off. It&#x27;s unscented, so it would be good if you&#x27;re looking for that specifically. It works much better when mixed with a richer oil-based lotion, in my opinion.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t feel it like a glove. and it just moisturize my hands ok. Crabtree and Evelyn is much better.</li>
    <li> This product does an excellent job of instantly soothing dry skin and more. I accidentally discovered it work better for a dry itching scalp area. After putting too much on my hands, I thought &amp;#34;maybe this could stop me me from scratching the hair of my head&amp;#34;. Years of using soap on my caught up with me. After a couple of weeks of using this, the small bald spot where I was constantly scratching no longer itched and now the hair has finally grown back.</li>
    <li> I can not see any helpful.</li>
    <li> For any art teachers out there, or anyone who handles clay and has the whole way over dried hands finger tips peeling thing going on, this product is for you! I was given a few free samples to try out, and once I used them up I knew I had to purchase a bottle! This isn&#x27;t a cure for eczema, so if that&#x27;s what you are looking for, then this isn&#x27;t for you.</li>
    <li> Thin. Watery. Does offer minimal protection. Back to the drawing board for my over washed, chapped, red, nurse hands.</li>
    <li> I enjoy this product.  It is wonderful on my dry hands, arms and even my face at bedtime.  You should try it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried hundreds of hand lotions over the years and nothing is quite like this.  I keep coming back to it because of how quickly it heals my hands.  I can&#x27;t give it 5 stars as it is not truly fragrance free.  I have to admit that I am hypersensitive to fragrances though, so for most people this will likely be fine.  I still use it daily.</li>
    <li> Great product.  bought this for a gift for my mother. But this item again when someone else side and had to have a bottle of their own. Also used it myself great product ease your hands in skin recommended for dry skin .</li>
    <li> I will rate this after I use it. Please ask again in a week or so. The The OK rating is NOT my rating. T. Molik</li>
