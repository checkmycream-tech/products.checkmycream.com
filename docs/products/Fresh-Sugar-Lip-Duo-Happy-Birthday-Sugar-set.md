      <li>Was a good buy as a decision making buy...</li>
      <li>I wanted to try a color, so the mini&#x27;s were a good way to try one.  </li>
      <li>They have good textures and smells.  </li>
      <li>Just gorgeous.  </li>
      <li>The colors on both the Rose and Plum are great</li>
      <li>Feels great but kind of flimsy</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a good product.  </li>
      <li>Either way, love the brand and will use them happily.</li>
      <li>I do love the scent of them!  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s nice to have both colors.  </li>
      <li>I preferred the Plum over the Rose.  </li>
      <li>I thought I was getting the plum and rose colored sugar balms, I got the &amp;#34;Sephora birthday gift set&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>I like the clear the best.  </li>
      <li>So why the on earth would I PAY $22 for something I got for free from my favorite makeup store?!</li>
      <li>Love this product.</li>
      <li>I have had it before love it.</li>
      <li>I just love the way this product feels on my lips.</li>
      <li>I buy most of my amazon purchases off my iPhone app.  </li>
      <li>u should be allowed to write as many words</li>
      <li>I like these balms, but I don&#x27;t love them.  </li>
      <li>I have NYX balms that wear for hours and cost $10 for a 3 pack (I like the NYX balms better).  </li>
      <li>For the most part I am an Amazon addict EXCEPT for when the title is not an accurate description of the product.  </li>
      <li>Very pleased and would buy a large version....</li>
      <li>This is a free mini gift set from Sephora.</li>
      <li>its great should be enough</li>
      <li>But they&#x27;re both smooth and creamy.</li>
      <li>The Sugar balms are natural and don&#x27;t have petrolatum, which is good.  </li>
      <li>I have been using the Fresh Sugar lip balm in the clear, and I love it!  </li>
      <li>This set arrived quickly but it is a MINI set.  </li>
      <li>product was smaller than expected, but I liked the &#x27;happy birthday&#x27; packaging.</li>
      <li>Everyone has always raved about Fresh Sugar lip balm, so I purchased the Rose/Plum Lip Duo to see what the hype was all about.  </li>
      <li>Worth trying as a test...</li>
      <li>And they provide a nice, sheer shade for your lips.  </li>
      <li>But you don&#x27;t get your money&#x27;s worth.  </li>
      <li>Will order the full sizes when I run out but these TEENIE ones are great for a small bag and Sugar products rock.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t think these are $40 worth of lip balms.  </li>
      <li>They keep my lips very moist, and they&#x27;re NOT sticky at all!  </li>
      <li>For the price, I had much higher expectations.</li>
      <li>But really there should be a better description since it popped up on my search along with regular sized lip glosses.</li>
      <li>The chapstick/lipgloss is smooth and creamy and with the smaller size option, you can get two colors for the price of one!</li>
      <li>They wear too quickly, requiring constant reapplication.  </li>
      <li>a very soft product use gently or it will smush.</li>
      <li>That&#x27;s the same exact set I got FOR FREE from Sephora last year on my birthday.</li>
      <li>High price for a freeby--I guess I paid for the freebies.</li>
      <li>Better to buy the regular size, single color.</li>
      <li>I love this product because it doesn&#x27;t wears of easyli, I live in extreme cold weather and it really protects my lips and it last even if you are drinking or eating and the color is great.</li>
      <li>Together they don&#x27;t even equal one of ether regular size Fresh sugar lip duo.  </li>

    <li> Love this product. I have had it before love it. The only thing I was disappointed when I received this item in the mail because I didn&#x27;t realize they were both half the size of the regular size. I thought they were both regular sized.</li>
    <li> Will order the full sizes when I run out but these TEENIE ones are great for a small bag and Sugar products rock.</li>
    <li> This is a free mini gift set from Sephora. It even has the Sephora &amp;#34;beauty insider&amp;#34; sticker on it.</li>
    <li> I am not sure what i expected, but they seem like samples.  Either way, love the brand and will use them happily.</li>
    <li> Too expensive for such a small set .</li>
    <li> Everyone has always raved about Fresh Sugar lip balm, so I purchased the Rose/Plum Lip Duo to see what the hype was all about.  I like these balms, but I don&#x27;t love them.  They&#x27;re tiny, for one, and seem a bit delicate (like they would break off if you carried one in your pocket and it heated up.)  I do love the scent of them!  Just gorgeous.

    <li> I just love the way this product feels on my lips. I keep it on my night stand to use before bed.it makes my lips so kissable.its a very soft product use gently or it will smush. I have used it for years. It makesca great gift.</li>
    <li> I love this product because it doesn&#x27;t wears of easyli, I live in extreme cold weather and it really protects my lips and it last even if you are drinking or eating and the color is great.</li>
    <li> Over priced, very small tubes. Not very effective.</li>
    <li> product was smaller than expected, but I liked the &#x27;happy birthday&#x27; packaging. I understand that Sephora gave this product away to their birthday customers. High price for a freeby--I guess I paid for the freebies.</li>
    <li> i have ordered multiple times this item and that&#x27;s why i don&#x27;t do reviews u should be allowed to write as many words as u want  its great should be enough</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good product.  It&#x27;s nice to have both colors.  But you don&#x27;t get your money&#x27;s worth.  Better to buy the regular size, single color.</li>
    <li> The picture is a little misleading as one tube is actually a clear lip balms while the other has color.  Both are great.  They have good textures and smells.  The caps not only slide shut but there is a screw that keeps them shut.  Great so it doesn&#x27;t get all over your bag.</li>
    <li> I have been using the Fresh Sugar lip balm in the clear, and I love it!  I wanted to try a color, so the mini&#x27;s were a good way to try one.  I like the clear the best.

I buy most of my amazon purchases off my iPhone app.  This set arrived quickly but it is a MINI set.  Together they don&#x27;t even equal one of ether regular size Fresh sugar lip duo.  I&#x27;m not going to bother returning because of the return shipping fees.  But really there should be a better description since it popped up on my search along with regular sized lip glosses.</li>
    <li> Feels great but kind of flimsy</li>
    <li> I thought I was getting the plum and rose colored sugar balms, I got the &amp;#34;Sephora birthday gift set&amp;#34; instead. That&#x27;s the same exact set I got FOR FREE from Sephora last year on my birthday. So why the on earth would I PAY $22 for something I got for free from my favorite makeup store?! I WOULDN&#x27;T! I feel ripped off and angry. Shame yellow star!</li>
