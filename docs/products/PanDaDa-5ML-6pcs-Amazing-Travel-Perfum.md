      <li>THESE ARE AMAZING FOR THE PRICE.  </li>
      <li>and these are an amazing deal.</li>
      <li>Let me start off by saying that the Travalo containers ARE superior, but they also cost a bit more.  </li>
      <li>Nice, just what my girl wanted.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Fortunately I had my own mini funnel that I used to fill them.  </li>
      <li>Item is nice nonetheless.</li>
      <li>Nice size for travel and every day in my purse.</li>
      <li>Came to me on time, undamaged and exactly as described on Amazon, which makes me a very happy customer!  :)</li>
      <li>The others are perfect, easy to fill by pouring in my favorite fragrances for on the go, and very pretty.  </li>
      <li>Very easy to fill and use.</li>
      <li>absolutely love these , ordering more tonight !</li>
      <li>These atomizers are both useful and attractive.</li>
      <li>I just love this travel perfume atomizer.</li>
      <li>Love these</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m still glad I got these--about a dollar</li>
      <li>They also hold 1ml more.</li>
      <li>Cute.</li>
      <li>I bought this to spritz my face after a plane ride, but I got more of a dowsing than a spray.  </li>
      <li>I got some nicer ones, there are two famous travel atomizers...</li>
      <li>they worked ok for me</li>
      <li>oh so cute.</li>
      <li>Glad I bought these.</li>
      <li>Ordered another set straight away as they will be great stocking fillers.</li>
      <li>I like them for the most part.</li>
      <li>GREAT IDEA AND FAST SHIPPING.</li>
      <li>I just love these.</li>
      <li>Although I received these later than executed, they are a marvelous product!</li>
      <li>Would work ok for hairspray or something you could pour.  </li>
      <li>love this ...</li>
      <li>I LOVE it</li>
      <li>and I am always getting compliments about how cute it is, so</li>
      <li>Love idea.</li>
      <li>Save yourself some money and get the Travalo bottles instead, which are 100x better.</li>
      <li>I love these things.</li>
      <li>I was pleased with the colors because they looked better than the photo.</li>
      <li>Love the idea of them</li>
      <li>So I will be purchasing some more</li>
      <li>Most perfume bottles don&#x27;t twist off, so you have to pump it into them.</li>
      <li>Mostly because they do not evaporate or leak at all.</li>
      <li>JUST FILL THE WITH YOUR FAVORITE PERFUME, PUT IN YOUR PURSE</li>
      <li>These bottles look nice, but are really cheap and unreliable.</li>
      <li>They are just what I wanted, easy to fill and cute.</li>
      <li>Love it and they are easy to fill.</li>
      <li>Will be buying more, I love them &amp; they are very useful convienent &amp; now my friends want some.</li>
      <li>/&gt;Reasonable price good product for what its used for I highly recommend them for travel or to have a spare on you when out and about!</li>
      <li>They arrived very quickly and are easy to fill.  </li>
      <li>Easy to fill,</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Its spray is broken in my 2nd refill.</li>
    <li> Worth the purchase. I use it for my Potpourri and it works great.</li>
    <li> cute sprayers, but didn&#x27;t get all six colors, just red &amp; purple.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I was looking for!</li>
    <li> They were pretty. But I needed a refillable container that I can get the liquid out of an already existing spray bottle. The product didn&#x27;t work for my purpose.</li>
    <li> No way to fill perfume into this.  Would work ok for hairspray or something you could pour.  I thought it would be like another atomizer that I had where you could literally pump from perfume to bottle.  With this, you need to pour it in which is useless since perfume bottle lids cannot be removed.</li>
    <li> The one I bought before this has a hole at the bottom to fill the atomizer directly, this one does not have that feature and no way to know this was not the same product</li>
    <li> Very nice glass bottle inside. I had one for 10 yr until my purse was stolen. Worth every penny.</li>
    <li> One of the atomizers was broken upon arrival.  The others are perfect, easy to fill by pouring in my favorite fragrances for on the go, and very pretty.  It&#x27;s difficult to find one the ones that you can pour your fragrance into -this fits the bill.  It took longer to arrive because it came from China.</li>
    <li> Great to carry in your purse Love it.</li>
    <li> No instructions how to fill these !!!!</li>
    <li> Not air tight, your perfume will evaporate</li>
    <li> I have another type of travel atomizer that stopped working. I think this design is superior. Time will tell. Also prettier.</li>
    <li> love this ...great price....easy to use</li>
    <li> I bought these because I needed a solution to applying cologne out of those little glass sample vials. These work great, the spray is a fine mist.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately the lids don&#x27;t fit tightly enough to stay, making them impossible to trust taking with me - which is why I bought them.</li>
    <li> I bought 10 of these and one was all dented up. How do I get it replaced?</li>
    <li> they&#x27;re perfect for when i travel, which has been a lot lately.&lt;br /&gt;I love the fact they have different colors so I can keep track of which bottle is whatever perfume.&lt;br /&gt;They&#x27;re not too big, so you can put a day&#x27;s amount in there and it&#x27;s still got some room.</li>
    <li> It was a little bigger than I expected, but I think it is still a convenient size. I was pleased with the colors because they looked better than the photo. I like that they have a separable glass bottle inside the metallic case, so that it protects the glass and we can see how much perfume is inside it.</li>
    <li> Although I received these later than executed, they are a marvelous product! Exactly what I wanted! Now I need them in a larger size.</li>
    <li> One of the atomizers was defective so that the metal case doesn&#x27;t stay on the glass atomizer. But it was an ugly fuchsia case anyway and these are an amazing deal. I&#x27;m obsessed with perfume and I have dealt with a LOT of atomizers over my short perfume maniac career, and these are top-notch. Mostly because they do not evaporate or leak at all. I got some nicer ones, there are two famous travel atomizers...yeah, they evaporate and/or leak and they are expensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t take kindly to losing my perfumes to evaporation or leaks! I love these things. The colors I got weren&#x27;t my favorites...black, silver, royal blue, hot pink, fuchsia, and red. On ebay I&#x27;ve found listings for these where you can get the colors that are pictured--that&#x27;s worth a shot if you&#x27;re picky about colors. I&#x27;m still glad I got these--about a dollar each for these is a great deal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit: I see they&#x27;ve updated the photo on the listing and it shows the colors I got. When I purchased them it showed 8 different colors, most of them pretty pastels.</li>
    <li> absolutely love these , ordering more tonight ! I have to spray the perfume into the atomizer which isn&#x27;t a big deal considering it takes less than a minute. if that&#x27;s an issue for you I suggest buying a mini funnel to make the process somewhat easier. this is very convenient if you don&#x27;t want to carry a big perfume bottle that could leak or potentially break in your purse plus the atomizers look a lot more beautiful in person ! will post pictures later hopefully. shipping does take a while, but came before the estimated delivery time. its completely worth it though ! where else will you find 6 beautiful atomizers like these for $13 ??!!</li>
    <li> These are very pretty but they don&#x27;t have the mechanism at the bottom to fill from a spray bottle. I thought these had that. But at this price, I suppose I&#x27;ll keep them and save for the perfumes I get that don&#x27;t have a spray bottle.</li>
    <li> I got them filled no problem and went back together. They are pretty. They don&#x27;t hold a lot so I&#x27;m waiting to see if the last during a trip.</li>
    <li> The price for six atomizers seemed low compared to other choices on Amazon, so I was a little leery when I ordered these.  They arrived within two weeks and exceeded my expectations.  The colors are lovely (as pictured, without the gold one), and they work beautifully.  The spray pattern is a fine, localized mist, just the right amount without overspray or too much volume.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought these atomizers to use in my purse and for travel, but I&#x27;m actually using them daily at home.  I like being able to store my bottles of cologne/perfume away from light, heat, and possible breakage from counter-roaming cats.</li>
    <li> They was so hard to fill</li>
    <li> Love it and they are easy to fill.</li>
    <li> I actually bought these to use with a refill bottle of poo-pourri that I purchased from Amazon.  These are perfect!  Easy to fill, nice little size (approx. the same size as a lipstick tube).  I love mine!  Gave one to a co-worker as well - she loves it too!  I plan to give the others as gifts... it&#x27;s nice to have a little purse size bottle for those needs away from home (if you know what I mean)!  I&#x27;m sure it would be great for perfume also as that was the intent of the seller, but, it works for the poo-pourri too.  Came to me on time, undamaged and exactly as described on Amazon, which makes me a very happy customer!  :)</li>
    <li> Great little sprayer to carry with me for DIY home made hand sanitizer. Nice size for travel and every day in my purse.</li>
    <li> Nice, just what my girl wanted.</li>
    <li> Works well. I haven&#x27;t used all of them yet, but thus far no leaks. One of them has a slightly loose cap, but nothing concerning. Definitely worth the money and wait.</li>
    <li> Works perfectly! I bought it so I could carry my different Poopourri fragrances. It fits discretely in my pocket, and works very well so far. Easy to use too--the little glass bottle unscrews so you can fill it. And I love the pretty colors and snazzy look. Glad I bought these.</li>
    <li> The perfect size to take anywhere. Plenty of colors to remind you which one is for which perfume.  Great deal!!!</li>
    <li> I refill my perfumes in these smaller units so I have purse sizes...great find!</li>
    <li> These atomizers are beautiful in person.  Just the right size to tuck into your purse or pocket.  They arrived very quickly and are easy to fill.  I kept two for myself and gave the others away to my sisters and nieces.  They loved them!</li>
    <li> I bought two sets to use for myself and to giveaway to friends. I use these to put my Young Living disinfectant spray into so I can carry it in my purse. I LOVE it and I am always getting compliments about how cute it is, so I decided to make a bunch for presents. These work like a charm! Exactly what I&#x27;m looking for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, some of them appear to be made in slightly different sizes from each other. For instance, the atomizer that was in the pink doesn&#x27;t fit into the red. Or if you put the atomizer that was in the silver into the black, the cap will not stay on. So be mindful which atomizer belongs to which color bottle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are three parts-- the lid, the case, and the atomizer. The atomizer must be removed from the case, but this is difficult especially with certain colors. In both sets, the Red and Black are most tightly squeezed in place and required my big strong man to go perform surgery on them in the garage to get them apart. The pink and purple were most easily removed. If they were all like the pink and purple-- I would have given this 5 stars. If I didn&#x27;t have my man, I don&#x27;t&#x27; think there was any way I would have been able to open the reds and blacks by myself.</li>
    <li> Eversince I discovered this, I no longer need to carry big bottles of perfume anywhere. Easy to fill and small enough to fit in a purse or carry on luggage. I love it so much, I ordered a second set.</li>
    <li> Love idea. Used for filling with poo-pouri. Did not work properly.  Very frustrating!</li>
    <li> The only time I can get travel size perfume is when there is a special gift with purchase.  With the new TSA rules, there is no way I can bring my regular perfume while travelling for work asI do not check my luggage.  These little atomizers are just what I need.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The outer container is metal, There is a plastic container with pumping spray inside.  I simply open the pump, wash the container, dry and spray perfume into this container from my regular perfume. With very little effort the little container is filled.  I keep one in my purse for everyday use and one in the quartz size zip lock bag for travel - remember 3-1-1 per TSA.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The price is great for all 6 good quality atomizers.  I gave a couple to my mom and daughter with a couple to spare.</li>
    <li> Would have liked it better if it came with at least one little funnel. Even better if it was like the other type that you just put on top of the perfume bottle (like the Travelo) and pump in the perfume. But this came with nothing to get your perfume into the little bottles.&lt;br /&gt;You could squirt your perfume into them, but you will waist so much of your expensive perfume.&lt;br /&gt;My suggestion is to go to &amp;#34;Hobby Lobby&amp;#34; or Michaels&amp;#34; or a hobby store and buy you a few of the miniature funnels for 1.00 and you will be happy!&lt;br /&gt;These were perfect little gifts or stocking stuffers, as long as you put a funnel with it.</li>
    <li> Wish they would have included mini funnels for easier fill!!!</li>
    <li> They are just what I wanted, easy to fill and cute.</li>
    <li> THESE ARE AMAZING FOR THE PRICE.  THEY ARE SO EASY TO HANDLE AND SO EASY TO FILL.....</li>
    <li> i found these to be a little harder to fill than i expected. but overall i like the product. shipping did take longer than I expected, but maybe I just didn&#x27;t pay attention at checkout.</li>
    <li> These are very nice purse size oil bottles. I make hand sanitizer w them! Nice gift!</li>
    <li> I have some perfume samples with no spray pump so I bought these. Items arrived in time, six bottles in different colors.  Convenient and travel friendly. The bottles smell bad after I unscrewed the sprayer. And one atomizer is defective. It does not spray.</li>
    <li> one was damaged during shipping...&lt;br /&gt;not worth the trouble of trying to get a replacement...</li>
    <li> Got these to fill some with fragrances for traveling instead of taking the WHOLE bottle(s)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DIDNT NEED A FUNNEL (you probably dont either if you have a spray cologne/perfume) my hands were steady enough to spray my choice colognes in every atomizer with minimal loss of the frangrances.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They all spray well, they come in all different colors (those are basically the capsules to protect the glass bottles inside) which you can take out of to fill.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I coordinated the scents to match the colors more or less without having to stick something (a sticker) on the bottles to tell which is which (without having to smell it first)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Reasonable price good product for what its used for I highly recommend them for travel or to have a spare on you when out and about!</li>
    <li> the look amazing but i can&#x27;t get any product into them :(</li>
    <li> Love these! I use Young Living essential oils in them to make perfume (Stress Away), poo-pourri (Purification) and a Antibacterial spray (Thieves). They are the perfect size to keep in my purse, the bottles are cute and work well!! Sprays a very fine mist, exactly what I was looking for!</li>
    <li> I just love these. They are well made as just oh so cute. I gave a few away to friends as I only needed two.</li>
    <li> Excellent atomizers for a great price. Very easy to fill and use. Sturdy. Cute. I love them!</li>
    <li> I actually bought these to hold Poo-pouri, not perfume LOL. I was able to pour some of the large bottle into these and it allows my husband to have a travel size that desecrate. Nothing more embarrassing when traveling for business and conferences and leaving a terrible smell...</li>
    <li> This product worked great for me. It eliminated having to carry heavy perfume bottles in my luggage. The only drawback is trying to put a different cologne in a bottle previously used for another fragrance. The smell of the previously used cologne remains in the bottle. At this price it is better to buy another set of bottles for new fragrances.</li>
    <li> I only received 5pcs. The silver one is missing. Not happy to spend extra time returning and reordering them.</li>
    <li> Just received this set and filled one; works perfectly.  If the remaining five work just as well this is a great buy.  No instructions of how to fill but I had used something similar before.  The metal base slid off fairly easily and the the glass refill unscrewed.  Easy enough to just put my perfume spray up against the bottle opening and keep pumping until you fill it or put however much you want in it.  Put it back together and the spray was as good as the original perfume bottle.  Love that there are different colors so that I can mentally match them to the type of scent I am putting in them i.e.  favorite color, favorite scent, red - seductive, pink - flowery, etc.  Ordered another set straight away as they will be great stocking fillers.</li>
    <li> Lovely little atomizers and I like the flat bottoms so they stand upright.  Superb price.  Fast deliver too which I appreciate.</li>
    <li> I bought this to spritz my face after a plane ride, but I got more of a dowsing than a spray.  Item is nice nonetheless.</li>
    <li> These sprayers are great. They are easy to fill and fun colors. I would recomend them. It does take awhile for them to be delivered but is worth it.</li>
    <li> Needed gifts for all my girls, so bought 3 sets of 6.  These are very nice!  It&#x27;s a unique gift that everyone could choose the color of their choice, but all the colors are great!</li>
    <li> Pretty bottles, some of the caps don&#x27;t stay on so I had to toss them  I got only three that actually work so I&#x27;m not going to repurchase these</li>
    <li> Loved the colors and, as I said in headline, this is an excellent value for the cost.  i AM BUYING ANOTHER SET TODAY!</li>
    <li> Limited volume. Mist was very fine (almost invisible), and almost as much dribbled down the bottle as sprayed.</li>
    <li> What a great little atomizer!!  What a deal $1.00 each and you can share!</li>
    <li> Great item and well worth the price. Also great gifts</li>
    <li> Love Them! The colors are so pritty and there perfect small pocket size ! Can match every outfit !</li>
    <li> I got just what I ordered. For the money, I&#x27;m incredibly happy with my purchase. Quick delivery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only downfall is how you have to fill them. Most perfume bottles don&#x27;t twist off, so you have to pump it into them. Other than that, it would be a five star purchase.</li>
    <li> These are awesome bottles that you can fill with all kinds of spray recipes.  I really enjoy the size, the colors, and the glass container that is protected by the casing.</li>
    <li> I found that transferring the perfume to the container messy and more difficult than I would have liked. It can happen with patience I don&#x27;t have so I need to find one that locks in the spray nozzle.</li>
    <li> These did not live up to my idea of quality. One came broken and the others had issues that caused more to be unuseable.  I keep trying to get them to work.</li>
    <li> Exactly as described. Love these</li>
    <li> These are not good for traveling. I tried with perfume and hairspray and both times they leaked. If you just use at home they would be fine.</li>
    <li> Will be buying more, I love them &amp; they are very useful convienent &amp; now my friends want some. So I will be purchasing some more</li>
    <li> Just an awesome products</li>
    <li> They are cute, the only thing that is slightly annoying is that you never know if the top or bottom part is going to slide off. It&#x27;s like having two lids over a glass spray bottle.</li>
    <li> These atomizers are both useful and attractive. They are a glass bottle with sprayer placed snugly in a plastic capsule. Can be used for a variety of liquids, including perfume. Slide out of capsule, twist glass container from sprayer, fill. Simple and easy.&lt;br /&gt;Fortunately I had my own mini funnel that I used to fill them.  Surprised by how powerful they sprayed. Great buy at 6 for a good price.</li>
    <li> Pretty little containers with bottles inside to fill with your scents when traveling. Can use for anything that you want to spray, not just perfume.</li>
    <li> My daughter asked for perfume for Christmas. She said her squirt bottle didn&#x27;t work. So I purchased theses and the other bottle. I thought they were very pretty. So did she. Thanks.</li>
    <li> Perfect for traveling and/or throwing in your purse!</li>
    <li> they worked ok for me</li>
    <li> I purchased these to give as Christmas gifts this coming year, since I buy throughout the year so that the holiday doesn&#x27;t hit me so hard.  They are functional as well as pretty.  Easy to fill and am sure will be appreciated by the recipient.</li>
    <li> This is a great small atomizer that is very pretty and you can match what ever bag or outfit that you have with you.</li>
    <li> I received these a few days ago. The shipping took a while. But they arrived in good condition. I agree with other reviews that it can be difficult to remove the case for filling the bottles, but with a little elbow grease it works out. I&#x27;ve used one so far and it sprays well. It actually holds a good amount of perfume, so you shouldn&#x27;t have to refill that often. A few people mentioned losing perfume, but if you hold the bottle exactly next to your perfume spray top, the loss is negligible if any.</li>
    <li> I just love this travel perfume atomizer. They are very practical. The colors of them are beautiful.&lt;br /&gt;I really recomended them.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t spray, just leaks out.</li>
    <li> THESE ARE SOI GREAT.  JUST FILL THE WITH YOUR FAVORITE PERFUME, PUT IN YOUR PURSE AND OFF YOU GO. GREAT IDEA AND FAST SHIPPING.</li>
    <li> Let me start off by saying that the Travalo containers ARE superior, but they also cost a bit more.  These are a little cheaper feeling in comparison, and bulkier, but they aren&#x27;t awful, and they get the job done. They also hold 1ml more. I&#x27;m happy with them, and they would make a great stocking stuffer!!  One other thing to note, the travalo containers spray less, while these spray quite a bit more. I put my strong perfumes in the travalos so I don&#x27;t douse myself and overwhelm everyone around me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To Fill: You have to remove cap, slide the inner perfume tube out of the outer decorative shell, unscrew the bottom section, then spray in your perfume, screw the bottom back on, and place back in the outer decorative shell. Not the end of the world, but a little more work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the cap and bottom colored piece have an inner plastic lining to ensure a nice smooth fit. If the inner plastic piece slides further inside, your pieces won&#x27;t stay together without reaching inside and sliding the plastic piece back up. Not a big deal, and it&#x27;s only happened to me once. Just an FYI&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you don&#x27;t want to deal with these slight hassles, I totally recommend the travalo perfume containers.</li>
    <li> These bottles look nice, but are really cheap and unreliable. The first one I used, the top no longer fit after I took it off the first time. The second one leaked all over my luggage. I will not be using the remaining bottles during anything that resembles travel. Save yourself some money and get the Travalo bottles instead, which are 100x better.</li>
    <li> I bought these as little gifts for friends. They all loved them! Who wants to bring a giant bottle of perfume with them on a trip? These are mini and very pretty! Practical and a good value.</li>
    <li> Bought these before using the first six and found out a few of them leak. I like them for the most part.</li>
    <li> Not what I expected. :(</li>
    <li> Product ok.&lt;br /&gt;Leaks a litle.</li>
    <li> Good luck trying to fill if you do not have pourable cologne or perfume. Does not work with spray bottles as there is no filler included.</li>
    <li> Bought for essential oils, but they stop working after a little while....very disappointed</li>
    <li> These bottles are pretty and well-made as far as the casing goes, hence the two stars. A glass bottle is encased inside of an aluminum shell (what you see in the picture), and you have to remove the glass bottle to fill it. The bottle fits snugly inside the casing but removing it was easy and I filled the bottle in just a few seconds (I used them for poo pourri so filling it was a breeze). However, the first time I went to use it the nozzle clogged and dripped instead of sprayed. I tried everything to get it unclogged but it&#x27;s useless. I&#x27;m just glad I didn&#x27;t spend that much on them. Love the idea of them but I&#x27;ll be purchasing from a trusted brand next time.</li>
    <li> Tested all of them with water and no leaks! I&#x27;m going to order another set. Thought it took awhile to get it, it was worth the wait. I&#x27;ve purchased some from others and they weren&#x27;t built as well as these. I wish they had some without the flashy bling LOL.</li>
    <li> Looks nice with good price. Sometimes the cover get a little bit loose.</li>
