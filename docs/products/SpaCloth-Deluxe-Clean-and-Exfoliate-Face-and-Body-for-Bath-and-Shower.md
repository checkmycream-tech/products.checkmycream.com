### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>I use it too for my face and neck and the results are wonderful !!!</li>
      <li>Great product!</li>
      <li>THIS IS A GREAT product with A+ quality!</li>
      <li>As the title implies - this wash cloth is AWESOME.</li>
      <li>This spa cloth was amazing!!</li>
      <li>works well and is very good for my husband.  </li>
      <li>Premium soaps, one being caress with additional liquid oiling type premium soaps is great for your skin; and this towel is without a doubt the greatest item I&#x27;ve ever  used in producing soap.  </li>
      <li>and it feels perfect to touch without any kind of irritation or soreness.</li>
      <li>They&#x27;re great for exfoliation.</li>
      <li>so I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s thicker than what I&#x27;m used to, but great nonetheless.</li>
      <li>Great cloth.</li>
      <li>This is a great stocking stuffer that I plan to give to friends and family this coming Christmas.</li>
      <li>But this towel is extremely great in this direction.  </li>
      <li>so I have put it to good use.  </li>
      <li>Good stuff.</li>
      <li>The cloth does a great job of maximizing the soap you use kind of like a loofah (sp ?)</li>
      <li>, soaping up is what I excessively love!  </li>
      <li>I plan to order more for myself and as gifts for family and friends!</li>
      <li>Absolutely the best ‘rag,’ oh no I dare not say ‘</li>
      <li>would absolutely recommend this product to anyone looking for great exfoliation!</li>
      <li>I am so happy that I found the SpaCloth Deluxe because now I have velvety smooth skin every time I use it.</li>
      <li>I love my SpaCloth Deluxe and have used them for years.</li>
      <li>Feels great when washing, easy to clean.</li>
      <li>The smoothness i get from this cloth is so much better than what i get from the spas i tried.</li>
      <li>I have tried so many brands</li>
      <li>I have used it now for more than 5 years</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m glad I made this purchase, I&#x27;ve used it just twice</li>
      <li>and I am glad I purchased it.</li>
      <li>So much better than a loofah (IMHO).</li>
      <li>Since getting home from my holiday I have ordered one of these for myself and partner to use (She even commented how smooth my skin was!).</li>
      <li>I need to buy more of these.</li>
      <li>What I also liked about the cloth is that when it drys it maintains it&#x27;s luxurious original look.</li>
      <li>This cloth does an excellent job of gently exfoliating your skin (it is not very rough like most loofahs) and feels great on the face – leaving you with a fresh, “clean scrubbed” feeling with no redness / irritation.  </li>
      <li>Soap lathers up easily with the product, and it is a must in the shower.  </li>
      <li>Perhaps they have a smaller cloth, but this one is still great</li>
      <li>My girlfriend said she noticed how much smoother and softer my skin is after using Spacloth Deluxe and the Spacloth Soapmate products.  </li>
      <li>This product is easy to clean too, which makes the purchase very cost effective.</li>
      <li>fantastic wash cloth.</li>
      <li>This wash cloth is great for your face and is saving me money because I do not have to purchase a special facial scrub.  </li>
      <li>Acne free &amp; clean.</li>
      <li>Not the best exfoliant cloth I&#x27;ve used, but the price is right and it is gentle enough to use on any part of the body.</li>
      <li>I really liked the material and yearned for a sleeveless top made out of the same fabric.  </li>
      <li>and I get moderate or good soap reaction from them.  </li>
      <li>but also leaves you feeling clean and fresh.  </li>
      <li>Leaves skin feeling very smooth and not dry; easy to wash.</li>
      <li>and normally I don&#x27;t use any kind of cloths or particular exfoliation techniques.</li>
      <li>To put it simply, this cloth is amazing.</li>
      <li>, it feels too soft but most reviewers say it does the trick.</li>
      <li>His skin is more sensitive than mine...</li>
      <li>- my skill felt softer, looked more radiant and just felt plain amazing.</li>
      <li>I have used it with both bar and liquid soaps, and it works great with both – generating a thick, rich lather.  </li>
      <li>I will be purchasing a few more of these for sure.</li>
      <li>but this is the only one that gives me very very smooth skin.</li>
      <li>I first got to experience this cloth at a Hilton hotel and Spa while I was on holiday.</li>
      <li>It scrubs nicely without being too rough.</li>
      <li>This is a re-review from the first one.  </li>
      <li>Thanks SpaCloth!</li>
      <li>When I first tried it I thought I was dreaming, but the sensation has lasted all these years, so it can’t be a dream.</li>
      <li>I assumed that it was just a “fancy facecloth”, but I am pleased to say I was way off on my initial preconception.  </li>
      <li>I would highly recommend this to anyone looking to give their skin a fresh new feel with fantastic smoothness.</li>
      <li>I have dry skin, and this helps exfoliate in a gentle, but effective way.</li>
      <li>It works really well.</li>
      <li>What is also noticeable is that I don&#x27;t have any red or tender skin after using it; it just leaves it smooth with no irritation.</li>
      <li>My skin is VERY used to exfoliation.</li>
      <li>This product is everything I expected and more.</li>
      <li>whoa, I did not realize what this towel was and is  good for until last week from this writing after having it for about a month of steady or at least mildly  disappointment.&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
      <li>But so far, I&#x27;m getting the most \\&quot;feeling\\&quot; of dermabrasion with no redness or irritation following with this cloth so far.</li>
      <li>I was pleasantly surprised when I used this cloth for the first time.</li>
      <li>The pleated material really just scrubs all the dead skin away leaving you feeling smooth to the touch!</li>
      <li>Conditionally I would give a final review later if I did not see some kind of positive reaction to thread on, an  even might  send them back; as I bought (2) towels.  </li>
      <li>If you are looking for a product to exfoliate your skin like a &amp;#34;Buff puff&amp;#34; this does not rate as high on the exfoliation scale.  </li>
      <li>The only thing I would have liked to be different is a bit smaller cloth.</li>
      <li>and that it&#x27;s only use was  in the shower to scrub and wash up with an  intentional sensitive surface design which I did not think was worth $15.00</li>
      <li>Definitely a product for anyone looking to add that extra smooth feeling to their skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>As a male I&#x27;m not always aware of how products like this one help your skin but with SpaCloth</li>
      <li>My first and only review</li>
      <li>After a shower with this cloth I feel so clean due to the exfoliation that occurs.</li>
      <li>It also gently exfoliates the skin, unlike a loofah, and can be used safely daily, especially important on aged or delicate skin.</li>
      <li>It plumps up when moistened, and has a lush  feel to the cloth.</li>
      <li>I purchased this product based on the fact that it has received 5 stars thus far.</li>
      <li>It easily removes pimples and small bumps.</li>
      <li>They take some getting used to at first because they seem a little rough, but once your skin gets used to it, it&#x27;s fantastic.</li>
      <li>Use this instead of a regular wash cloth - unless you have sensitive skin.  </li>
      <li>I suffer from cystic acne and so far I have not had any breakouts since using this washcloth with my regular cleanser.</li>
      <li>But I concluded and told the Manufacturer that it dripped when I used it also as a wash cloth outside of the shower which I normally did with my traditional face towels.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a thick cloth, soft, but man does it really get in there!</li>
      <li>Although I wish I would have ordered the wash-cloth sized one which is  a little smaller, I really like it.  </li>

<li> You can get a large amount of lather just from a small amount of gel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
<li> Not too abrasive, some what expensive, but better than I expected.</li>
<li> It suds up well with little soap which can be important when using an expensive soap that you want to last for a while.</li>
<li> It is just a little larger.</li>
<li> I have always suffered from rough skin and lots of pimples surfacing all over my body.</li>
<li> an extra but quite obvious little tip - Add a small amount of shower gel to the cloth and lather it up.</li>
<li> So we&#x27;ll see, but I think I would recommend this over other exfoliating cloths.</li>
<li> I can run my hand up and down my arm</li>
<li> I have to admit that this is not a product that I would typically purchase – I received a SpaCloth as a gift and it went unused for a few weeks.  </li>
<li> I&#x27;m going to try the Nufountain version of the green cloth, as well as the Exfolia round disk buffers and 2 little finger sized microdermabrasion mitts to see how those stack up.</li>
<li> gets all the dead skin off; exfoliating indeed.</li>
<li> (it&#x27;s the green one)</li>

    <li> works well and is very good for my husband.  His skin is more sensitive than mine... it does exfoliate the face well.</li>
    <li> I have to admit that this is not a product that I would typically purchase – I received a SpaCloth as a gift and it went unused for a few weeks.  I assumed that it was just a “fancy facecloth”, but I am pleased to say I was way off on my initial preconception.  This cloth does an excellent job of gently exfoliating your skin (it is not very rough like most loofahs) and feels great on the face – leaving you with a fresh, “clean scrubbed” feeling with no redness / irritation.  I have used it with both bar and liquid soaps, and it works great with both – generating a thick, rich lather.  I have been using this product every morning in the shower for the last 3 months and it has proven to be quite durable – there is no noticeable wear on the cloth.  As someone who was initially skeptical about this product, I have to say that I am now a firm supporter of SpaCloth and will defiantly continue using it!</li>
    <li> Although I wish I would have ordered the wash-cloth sized one which is  a little smaller, I really like it.  It exfoliates well and I find that I get plenty of lather.  Good stuff.</li>
    <li> As the title implies - this wash cloth is AWESOME. So much better than a loofah (IMHO). Feels great when washing, easy to clean. Use this instead of a regular wash cloth - unless you have sensitive skin.  But really efficient at exfoliating all your dried skin.</li>
    <li> Absolutely the best ‘rag,’ oh no I dare not say ‘rag’…to do so would be an insult to this state of the art bathing product. I have used it now for more than 5 years and it is still the only thing I use. When I first tried it I thought I was dreaming, but the sensation has lasted all these years, so it can’t be a dream.</li>
    <li> My skin is VERY used to exfoliation. I&#x27;ve been doing clinical strength peels and dermabrasion at home for years. I&#x27;m trying the Exfolia cloth to see if that does the trick (it&#x27;s the green one) and I&#x27;m not sure, it feels too soft but most reviewers say it does the trick. I&#x27;m going to try the Nufountain version of the green cloth, as well as the Exfolia round disk buffers and 2 little finger sized microdermabrasion mitts to see how those stack up. But so far, I&#x27;m getting the most \\&quot;feeling\\&quot; of dermabrasion with no redness or irritation following with this cloth so far. It&#x27;s a thick cloth, soft, but man does it really get in there! So we&#x27;ll see, but I think I would recommend this over other exfoliating cloths.</li>
    <li> fantastic wash cloth. After a shower with this cloth I feel so clean due to the exfoliation that occurs. The cloth does a great job of maximizing the soap you use kind of like a loofah (sp ?) but also leaves you feeling clean and fresh.  I need to buy more of these.</li>

Just a thought. ..</li>
    <li> THIS IS A GREAT product with A+ quality! I would recommend this product to anyone who would like to have a bath cloth which does the work of several products for a fraction of the price. As a male I&#x27;m not always aware of how products like this one help your skin but with SpaCloth I have definitely seen the difference over the time which I&#x27;ve been using it. There has been a noticeable difference in my skins. This product is easy to clean too, which makes the purchase very cost effective.</li>
    <li> I love my SpaCloth Deluxe and have used them for years. They take some getting used to at first because they seem a little rough, but once your skin gets used to it, it&#x27;s fantastic. They&#x27;re great for exfoliation. I would definitely recommend this product!</li>
    <li> gets all the dead skin off; exfoliating indeed. I&#x27;m used to the Japanese rags so I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s thicker than what I&#x27;m used to, but great nonetheless.</li>
    <li> Great cloth. It scrubs nicely without being too rough. It&#x27;s a little too big, but I&#x27;d still highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> Not the best exfoliant cloth I&#x27;ve used, but the price is right and it is gentle enough to use on any part of the body.</li>
    <li> Leaves skin feeling very smooth and not dry; easy to wash. Not too abrasive, some what expensive, but better than I expected.</li>
    <li> This spa cloth was amazing!! On the advice of a friend I decided to give this a try. I have never been one to &amp;#34;pamper&amp;#34; myself but I was amazed at how my skin felt after using it. The pleated material really just scrubs all the dead skin away leaving you feeling smooth to the touch! I definitely recommend this product</li>
    <li> This product is everything I expected and more. I will never use a regular wash cloth again. I plan to order more for myself and as gifts for family and friends!</li>
    <li> Great product! I have dry skin, and this helps exfoliate in a gentle, but effective way. It works really well. Soap lathers up easily with the product, and it is a must in the shower.  My girlfriend said she noticed how much smoother and softer my skin is after using Spacloth Deluxe and the Spacloth Soapmate products.  This is a great stocking stuffer that I plan to give to friends and family this coming Christmas.</li>
    <li> To put it simply, this cloth is amazing. I have always suffered from rough skin and lots of pimples surfacing all over my body. I have tried a lot of creams and exfoliating scrubs but never thought of a cloth like this before. I am so happy that I found the SpaCloth Deluxe because now I have velvety smooth skin every time I use it. What is also noticeable is that I don&#x27;t have any red or tender skin after using it; it just leaves it smooth with no irritation. After using this product I will never bother with anything else again, I have seen immediate results and could not be happier. I would highly recommend this to anyone looking to give their skin a fresh new feel with fantastic smoothness. Thanks SpaCloth!</li>
    <li> t has been awhile since I purchased this item so I have put it to good use.  If you are looking for a product to exfoliate your skin like a &amp;#34;Buff puff&amp;#34; this does not rate as high on the exfoliation scale.  For example a buff puff would be a 10 and this product would be a 3.  I was disappointed in that exfoliation factor otherwise the product works like a face cloth.  It is just a little larger.</li>
    <li> My first and only review I gave this a (3 ) rating which I thought I was being generous at the time!  Conditionally I would give a final review later if I did not see some kind of positive reaction to thread on, an  even might  send them back; as I bought (2) towels.  I&#x27;ve sensed gotten (2) emails I believe from the Manufacturer about using their product and asking why I did not love it. I bought it thinking it was a face towel basically and that it&#x27;s only use was  in the shower to scrub and wash up with an  intentional sensitive surface design which I did not think was worth $15.00 plus.  But I concluded and told the Manufacturer that it dripped when I used it also as a wash cloth outside of the shower which I normally did with my traditional face towels.  It was  a turnoff hanging sometimes from the towel rack after using it outside of the shower producing puddles on my bathroom floor!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well  whoa, I did not realize what this towel was and is  good for until last week from this writing after having it for about a month of steady or at least mildly  disappointment.&lt;br /&gt;Well, soaping up is what I excessively love!  As  I&#x27;ve bought several different  products that you put soap inside where the material is against the soap and I get moderate or good soap reaction from them.  But this towel is extremely great in this direction.  On a small piece of caress soap I will get mounds and mounds of lathered soap.  Where I don&#x27;t rinse off until I finish showering!  Premium soaps, one being caress with additional liquid oiling type premium soaps is great for your skin; and this towel is without a doubt the greatest item I&#x27;ve ever  used in producing soap.  Also the soaping reaction helps in the stimulation process with the surface!  This is a re-review from the first one.  If the Manufacturer only knew what he had here, he&#x27;d  sell a billion!  I&#x27;m keeping my (2) towels and alerting  all friends!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m glad I made this purchase, I&#x27;ve used it just twice &amp; I can feel &amp; see the difference in my face already. Acne free &amp; clean. I will be purchasing a few more of these for sure.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product based on the fact that it has received 5 stars thus far. And, I totally agree.  This wash cloth is great for your face and is saving me money because I do not have to purchase a special facial scrub.  I suffer from cystic acne and so far I have not had any breakouts since using this washcloth with my regular cleanser.</li>
    <li> The only thing I would have liked to be different is a bit smaller cloth. Perhaps they have a smaller cloth, but this one is still great and I am glad I purchased it.</li>
    <li> I first got to experience this cloth at a Hilton hotel and Spa while I was on holiday. I had never heard of the product before and normally I don&#x27;t use any kind of cloths or particular exfoliation techniques. As I was at a spa I thought I may as well give this a go and I do not regret this one bit!&lt;br /&gt;To sum it up - my skill felt softer, looked more radiant and just felt plain amazing. I can run my hand up and down my arm and it feels perfect to touch without any kind of irritation or soreness. Since getting home from my holiday I have ordered one of these for myself and partner to use (She even commented how smooth my skin was!). Definitely a product for anyone looking to add that extra smooth feeling to their skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As an extra but quite obvious little tip - Add a small amount of shower gel to the cloth and lather it up. You can get a large amount of lather just from a small amount of gel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would absolutely recommend this product to anyone looking for great exfoliation!</li>
    <li> I have tried so many brands but this is the only one that gives me very very smooth skin. It easily removes pimples and small bumps. The smoothness i get from this cloth is so much better than what i get from the spas i tried. I use it too for my face and neck and the results are wonderful !!! Will definitely recommend this.</li>
