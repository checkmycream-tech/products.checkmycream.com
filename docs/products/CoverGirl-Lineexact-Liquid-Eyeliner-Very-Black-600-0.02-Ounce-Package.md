### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>This is a very good liquid eyeliner.</li>
      <li>so this is great for beginners.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Great product.  </li>
      <li>This stuff is great.</li>
      <li>I kept reapplying the eyeliner again and again but never got it to look great.</li>
      <li>, it&#x27;s okay, but not the best answer.</li>
      <li>I ordered two of these thinking some liquid eyeliner would make my life a bit easier and these looked good.</li>
      <li>I loved it..</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s a good thing I have a spare on hand.</li>
      <li>I decided to retry it because there was a good price including a coupon...</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s still a good product.</li>
      <li>So glad I did!</li>
      <li>I love it!</li>
      <li>but this would would have been nice to toss into a travel case.</li>
      <li>It didn&#x27;t like the way it went on my eye lid and liked</li>
      <li>Very easy to apply</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very easy to wash off with soap and water, but lasts all day.</li>
      <li>I love me some liquid liner, and boy am I in love with this one!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s easy to apply and lasts all day!</li>
      <li>would put on the perfect line in the morning, but by lunchtime, the line is barely there.</li>
      <li>The brush gives a good accurate easy to make line and it doesn&#x27;t smear or run off from wearing it all day.</li>
      <li>but I love this eyeliner :)</li>
      <li>I love this eyeliner.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s my favorite eyeliner.  </li>
      <li>I absolutely LOVE this eyeliner.</li>
      <li>once you do, you&#x27;ll love it.  </li>
      <li>and I use it to line the top lashline.</li>
      <li>This eyeliner goes on smooth, has good coverage, and the tip allows you to be precise.  </li>
      <li>i think it should be a better eyeliner.</li>
      <li>Be sure to shake it before application to ensure a moist tip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I love the color of the smoke eyeliner.</li>
      <li>I REALLY love the felt tip that allows for a nice clean-cut swoop across the eye, so you don&#x27;t waste another 15 minutes trying to perfect both sides.</li>
      <li>but I&#x27;m pretty good</li>
      <li>It looks almost as good at the end of the day as is does when you first put it on.</li>
      <li>Sooooo easy.</li>
      <li>It applies easy, lasts all day (even after I rub my eyes, forgetting it&#x27;s on) ...</li>
      <li>and it is also easy to  pick on.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll be ordering more shortly as my first tube just ran out!</li>
      <li>It doesnt smudge, it&#x27;s super easy to apply.</li>
      <li>I love the satisfaction of discovering a new favorite pitch-black eyeliner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I read all the bad reviews but it was a great price and seemed like the perfect product for me</li>
      <li>Trust me save yourself the hassle spend the extra $3.00 dollars and get a better kind of liquid eyeliner.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s been very useful as a means for practicing applying eyeliner or for a quick trip out, but otherwise I would not recommend.</li>
      <li>One of those lasted me months, was easy to use, made a nice dark line, and, yes, I could easily vary the width of the line!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not much of a make-up girl, because I don&#x27;t know how to use it, but this stuff is GREAT.  </li>
      <li>I love it so much</li>
      <li>I love liquid eyeliner and this product ran out so fast -</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not the most steady at applying this</li>
      <li>anyhow, the first eye got lined beautifully, darkly, smoothly...</li>
      <li>either so it provides a more natural look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not too dark and looks good with brown eyes.</li>
      <li>and I liked the initial intense blackness and ease of application.</li>
      <li>It has a nice small size and it is an overall good eyeliner.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It is easy to remove when you want to but doesn&#x27;t smudge or run at all and provides a smooth look that doesn&#x27;t dry too shiny.</li>
      <li>other than that LOVE IT!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried a liquid eyeliner from a higher end makeup company and did not get the results that this product gives.  </li>
      <li>Lineexact is the whole package!</li>
      <li>This product is nothing special, a pain to use, and a complete rip off!  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried ones that show up kind of transparent on the skin, like it was watered down.  </li>
      <li>Once I did that, a nice black line came out of the pen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>This piece of junk lasted me five days and even when the color was flowing good, it still wasn&#x27;t dark enough and left more of a smudge than a line.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not the biggest fan of liquid eyeliner and hardly ever use it, but I decided it would be good to have in my make up collection in case</li>
      <li>For myself, I find that because it&#x27;s short it is easier to apply precisely and dramatically.</li>
      <li>It enhance my eyes very well along with my eyeshadow.  </li>
      <li>so it doesn&#x27;t take up too much space or make your purse bulge like mascara would.  </li>
      <li>I found that it works very well</li>
      <li>The bottle is tiny and cheap looking.</li>
      <li>I really like this eyeliner.  </li>
      <li>It is easy to apply and stays on for a long time.  </li>
      <li>but during that time I managed to open the original one with a wrench..</li>
      <li>Ok, it might take a little while to get used to it -</li>
      <li>Not surprising it was cheap to pay for so the product was cheap as well.</li>
      <li>At first it barely came out of the pen.</li>
      <li>I like being able to apply a super thin line or a thicker one depending on the pressure I put on the applicator.</li>
      <li>but that&#x27;s with any new thing -</li>
      <li>I have been using it for a few years now and it is by far my favorite.</li>
      <li>The first problem with this liner was that it wouldn&#x27;t twist or pull open...</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not sure why so many people are having problems with this eyeliner.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s a bother because most stores are sold out when I go looking for very black!</li>
      <li>Then I actually put it on and I had to go over the line to make it really black because it went on lighter THEN to top it all off</li>
      <li>, I&#x27;ve been having a hard time trying to find this eye liner in stores, so if they discontinue it, I&#x27;ll be more than upset.</li>
      <li>The &#x27;paint&#x27; doesn&#x27;t come out enough, with the result that you get a very light line instead of what I wanted, a very black line.</li>
      <li>Glad it came in a pack of two at least.</li>
      <li>This is not my first time ordering the cover girl line exact liquid eyeliner very black 600.  </li>
      <li>I tried ones that were too thick and hard to achieve a nice, even and clean line.  </li>
      <li>If you are not careful it can go on a little too thick...use a light hand when applying it....should solve the problem.</li>
      <li>Dries fairly fast and the very black color is exactly what i wanted.  </li>
      <li>The small size of the product allows precise control when applying to the eyelid.  </li>
      <li>I would reapply after lunch and the line was decent, but I was left with smudging under my eyes by the time I left work.</li>
      <li>only problem I noticed is that when I used it over eyeshadow, the shadow would stick to the felt tip, making the application a little more difficult and not as smooth</li>
      <li>The brush on that product didn&#x27;t make it easy to allow a thin controlled line and also didn&#x27;t dry as fast as this one.  </li>
      <li>Every so often I have one that does dry up way too fast, one even started out dry.  </li>

<li> I&#x27;ve been using liquid eyeliner for 15 years and was actually looking for the OLD STYLE Cover Girl liquid liner with the tiny little paintbrush, but couldn&#x27;t find it.  </li>
<li> i don&#x27;t like this eyeliner like its so hard to apply and it doesin&#x27;t make a straight line and the applicator hurts when i apply it.</li>
<li> It is a lot smaller than i expected</li>
<li> it&#x27;s a shame since it&#x27;s the first eyeliner I can actually use since it is very easy to draw the line in my eye with it, with other eyeliners it has always been a mess, I&#x27;ll guess I&#x27;ll keep trying other ones &#x3D;(</li>
<li> I&#x27;ve bought a couple already and the same as other reviews, dries up after about 3 weeks to 1 month.</li>
<li> I&#x27;m currently experimenting dipping the applicator tip into other eyeliners</li>
<li> I bought it in a store, but I&#x27;m having the same problems as listed in other reviews.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I swear by this eyeliner and have used it exclusively for the last 10 years.  It&#x27;s easy to apply and lasts all day!</li>
    <li> I read all the bad reviews but it was a great price and seemed like the perfect product for me so I decided to give it a try. So glad I did! I love it! I shake it for a few seconds each time before I use it, the brush is never dry, eyeliner goes on beautifully, thin or thick line. I can&#x27;t fathom the cause to the problems others have had, perhaps the issue has since been corrected. I&#x27;ve ordered the black/brown and will post a review under that product page after I get the chance to use it for awhile.</li>
    <li> I love this eyeliner. The brush gives a good accurate easy to make line and it doesn&#x27;t smear or run off from wearing it all day. It looks almost as good at the end of the day as is does when you first put it on. The only downfall I have found in it is that it runs out way to fast, and then it looks like a dried out marker on your eyes. :( other than that LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> This is a very good liquid eyeliner. If you are not careful it can go on a little too thick...use a light hand when applying it....should solve the problem. I usually take an eyeshadow brush and smudge it a little. It has a nice small size and it is an overall good eyeliner.</li>
    <li> I bought this item thinking it was much bigger than what it, which turned out to be my first complaint about this product.  Then I actually put it on and I had to go over the line to make it really black because it went on lighter THEN to top it all off, it vanished in a couple of hours!  Not happy about it, I spent 11 for two, big waste!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been looking for a dependable liquid liner for awhile and sadly, I still do even after thinking I hit the jackpot with this purchase. The liquid bleeds which we all know, is the opposite of what we need when it comes to liquid liners. I&#x27;m not the most steady at applying this but I&#x27;m pretty good and I looked like a hooker.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried over a dozen different liquid liners, and none have ever compared to this one.  I&#x27;ve tried ones that show up kind of transparent on the skin, like it was watered down.  I tried ones that were too thick and hard to achieve a nice, even and clean line.  Lineexact is the whole package! I love me some liquid liner, and boy am I in love with this one! I REALLY love the felt tip that allows for a nice clean-cut swoop across the eye, so you don&#x27;t waste another 15 minutes trying to perfect both sides. And it lasts forever! I&#x27;ve had this last one for almost a year now.  And it&#x27;s compact so it doesn&#x27;t take up too much space or make your purse bulge like mascara would.  I will never use a different one!  I&#x27;ll tell you one thing, I&#x27;ve been having a hard time trying to find this eye liner in stores, so if they discontinue it, I&#x27;ll be more than upset.</li>
    <li> I really like this eyeliner.  It is easy to apply and stays on for a long time.  Dries fairly fast and the very black color is exactly what i wanted.  The only thing I am disappointed with is the size. It is a lot smaller than i expected and since I use eyeliner almost every day, i am already running out.  It is a two pack, so it&#x27;s a good thing I have a spare on hand.</li>
    <li> I love the color of the smoke eyeliner. It&#x27;s not too dark and looks good with brown eyes. I have not bought my eyeliner from Amazon but the local store. I&#x27;ve bought a couple already and the same as other reviews, dries up after about 3 weeks to 1 month. Ashame since I can&#x27;t find any other color I want to use.</li>
    <li> This is not my first time ordering the cover girl line exact liquid eyeliner very black 600.  I found that it works very well and it is also easy to  pick on.  It enhance my eyes very well along with my eyeshadow.  I recommend this product to others.</li>
    <li> After the 3rd day of using it, it dried off!! This is not the first time this happens, I thought that maybe I had bad luck with the one I bought before, a manufacturing defect or something like it but no &#x3D;( it&#x27;s a shame since it&#x27;s the first eyeliner I can actually use since it is very easy to draw the line in my eye with it, with other eyeliners it has always been a mess, I&#x27;ll guess I&#x27;ll keep trying other ones &#x3D;(</li>
    <li> At first it barely came out of the pen. I realized that it was because the product calls for you to \\&quot;shake well.\\&quot; Once I did that, a nice black line came out of the pen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would put on the perfect line in the morning, but by lunchtime, the line is barely there. I would reapply after lunch and the line was decent, but I was left with smudging under my eyes by the time I left work. I have combination skin, so I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s because the oils are affecting it. I don&#x27;t recommend this product for all day wear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s been very useful as a means for practicing applying eyeliner or for a quick trip out, but otherwise I would not recommend.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great. It applies easy, lasts all day (even after I rub my eyes, forgetting it&#x27;s on) ... I have zero complaints! I like being able to apply a super thin line or a thicker one depending on the pressure I put on the applicator. Sooooo easy.</li>
    <li> The first problem with this liner was that it wouldn&#x27;t twist or pull open...I even asked my husband who bench presses a ton at at gym to twist it open, and he couldn&#x27;t do it.i contacted amazon and they sent a replacement....but during that time I managed to open the original one with a wrench..anyhow, the first eye got lined beautifully, darkly, smoothly...I loved it..mbut by the end of the second eye, it was like gray!  I swiped it on y hand and it would not come out! The product was literally drying in front of my in a moment of minutes!  *update*  The second batch that amazon sent to me also wouldn&#x27;t open...I twisted and pulled and asked my husband...and I gave up! I contacted amazon and they issued a refund without a problem.  I also contacted cover girl to check out and remedy the situation.  It is ridiculous.  I will not be repurchasing this item ever again. I wanted to let I know, that I did buy this item about a yr and a half ago and although I didn&#x27;t have the twisting issue with the cap, it did dry up on me in a few days. I decided to retry it because there was a good price including a coupon...and I liked the initial intense blackness and ease of application. But I should have decided against it, because it&#x27;s been  a headache trying to return, exchange, or get credit for the defective liner.  Please save yourself the hassle and move onto another liner. I do like the mabelline gel liner...it comes in a small pot, it is very black, but there is a slight learnin curve in use. It does last forever..but this would would have been nice to toss into a travel case.</li>
    <li> This stuff is terrible. I&#x27;m not the biggest fan of liquid eyeliner and hardly ever use it, but I decided it would be good to have in my make up collection in case I need it. I decided to order a couple different kinds to experiment with and this was by far the worst. Not surprising it was cheap to pay for so the product was cheap as well. It didn&#x27;t like the way it went on my eye lid and liked it&#x27;s disappearing act even less. Trust me save yourself the hassle spend the extra $3.00 dollars and get a better kind of liquid eyeliner.</li>
    <li> This only works for a month before it dries up. I would like to think that I am not using the product incorrectly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know you should change eye cosmetics every two to three months, but not prepared to change monthly.</li>
    <li> I am one of those girls who has a thick cateye stroke of eyeliner as part of my signature daily look. So trust me when I say I&#x27;ve tested them all.  I love the satisfaction of discovering a new favorite pitch-black eyeliner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This, ladies, is not that eyeliner. Impulse shopping online led me to purchase this eyeliner, and i&#x27;ve learned from my mistake. The bottle is tiny and cheap looking. The eyeliner liquid itself is watery, translucent, and the tip is not sturdy enough for my liking. I kept reapplying the eyeliner again and again but never got it to look great. It just felt and looked cheap.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Threw it away, did not even keep the bottle.</li>
    <li> After seeing an ad in a magazine for this eyeliner a couple of years ago, I tried it...it&#x27;s my favorite eyeliner.  The small size of the product allows precise control when applying to the eyelid.  I like the felt tip as well, it allows me to vary the width of my line.  I&#x27;ve tried a liquid eyeliner from a higher end makeup company and did not get the results that this product gives.  The brush on that product didn&#x27;t make it easy to allow a thin controlled line and also didn&#x27;t dry as fast as this one.  I have not experienced the same problems the other reviewer has had.  My eyeliner lasts all day...even when I&#x27;m sweating after a run.  The only thing I don&#x27;t like is the price...I&#x27;ve paid about half of this price at other stores.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not much of a make-up girl, because I don&#x27;t know how to use it, but this stuff is GREAT.  Have you written with a sharpie?  Then you can apply this eyeliner.  Ok, it might take a little while to get used to it - but that&#x27;s with any new thing - once you do, you&#x27;ll love it.  I&#x27;ll be ordering more shortly as my first tube just ran out!</li>
    <li> This eyeliner goes on smooth, has good coverage, and the tip allows you to be precise.  Great product.  Be sure to shake it before application to ensure a moist tip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***Update***&lt;br /&gt;I do have a complaint as of late.  Every so often I have one that does dry up way too fast, one even started out dry.  I&#x27;m hoping CoverGirl isn&#x27;t just slacking on their quality.  It&#x27;s still my favorite applicator by far, but I hate wasting money on lemons! I&#x27;m currently experimenting dipping the applicator tip into other eyeliners, it&#x27;s okay, but not the best answer.</li>
    <li> I am disappointed in this CoverGirl eyeliner. It does not apply well. It&#x27;s almost like the applicator is &#x27;dry&#x27;. Once on, it doesn&#x27;t last.</li>
    <li> I did not buy this on Amazon.  I bought it in a store, but I&#x27;m having the same problems as listed in other reviews.  It doesn&#x27;t stay on and it&#x27;s drying up on me in only a few days.  I can&#x27;t get the line dark enough either.  Grrr!  I&#x27;ve been using liquid eyeliner for 15 years and was actually looking for the OLD STYLE Cover Girl liquid liner with the tiny little paintbrush, but couldn&#x27;t find it.  I don&#x27;t even know if they make it anymore.  One of those lasted me months, was easy to use, made a nice dark line, and, yes, I could easily vary the width of the line! This piece of junk lasted me five days and even when the color was flowing good, it still wasn&#x27;t dark enough and left more of a smudge than a line. This product is nothing special, a pain to use, and a complete rip off!  Save your money!</li>
    <li> Very easy to apply and I use it to line the top lashline. It&#x27;s easy to control and to make thin or thick lines so this is great for beginners.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is easy to remove when you want to but doesn&#x27;t smudge or run at all and provides a smooth look that doesn&#x27;t dry too shiny. It&#x27;s not so pigmented that it looks harsh on the eyes either so it provides a more natural look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only problem I noticed is that when I used it over eyeshadow, the shadow would stick to the felt tip, making the application a little more difficult and not as smooth but it&#x27;s still a good product.</li>
    <li> i don&#x27;t like this eyeliner like its so hard to apply and it doesin&#x27;t make a straight line and the applicator hurts when i apply it. i think it should be a better eyeliner.</li>
    <li> I love liquid eyeliner and this product ran out so fast - Glad it came in a pack of two at least.</li>
    <li> I absolutely LOVE this eyeliner. I&#x27;ve never liked liquid eyeliner, but this is completely different. It doesnt smudge, it&#x27;s super easy to apply. It&#x27;s almost like using a marker. And it doesnt smudge! I love it so much, I wear it all the time! I would definitely reccommend this eyeliner to others. Especially people like me who have always used pencil eyeliner, because they don&#x27;t like liquid!</li>
    <li> I thought by buying a well-known brand I could rely on it&#x27;s quality.&lt;br /&gt;I was wrong. The &#x27;paint&#x27; doesn&#x27;t come out enough, with the result that you get a very light line instead of what I wanted, a very black line. I&#x27;ve tried to shake, squeeze, but it didn&#x27;t help. And now I have a pack of two!&lt;br /&gt;No, not again, sorry CoverGirl........</li>
    <li> this is the worst eyeliner i have bought  , its not black enough it doesn&#x27;t last, terrible this is by far the worst eyeliner i have ever tried</li>
    <li> I ordered two of these thinking some liquid eyeliner would make my life a bit easier and these looked good. I used one for like 3 days and then it started drying up. Even when I would shake it, it wouldn&#x27;t product anything in the tip. Also the tips on them were like falling apart after just a few days and was making it apply uneven and hard to use. So I got the 2nd one out, did the same thing, it went dry a few days later. I will not repurchase these.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure why so many people are having problems with this eyeliner. I have been using it for a few years now and it is by far my favorite. It&#x27;s very easy to wash off with soap and water, but lasts all day. For myself, I find that because it&#x27;s short it is easier to apply precisely and dramatically. Some reviews stated that it wouldn&#x27;t go on dark enough-- I find that shaking it a bit before usually helps and don&#x27;t be afraid to apply some pressure. I have gotten ones that have dried out in a week or two, which is why I rated it four instead of five stars. Usually it lasts me a month to two months. It&#x27;s a bother because most stores are sold out when I go looking for very black! I&#x27;m not a huge fan of Covergirl but I love this eyeliner :)</li>
    <li> This was supposed to come with 2 eyeliners, but I only received one.  I love the product, but was disappointed to only receive one.</li>
