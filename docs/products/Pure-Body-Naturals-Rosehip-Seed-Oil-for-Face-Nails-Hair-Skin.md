      <li>There is no oily residue and my skin feels wonderfully smooth.</li>

      <li>I just recently learned that rosehip oil is good for stretch marks</li>
      <li>rosehip oil doesn&#x27;t smell great,to me personally,but because it absorbs so well and quickly the smell goes away in no time.</li>
      <li>My Organic Rosehip oil shipped quickly and arrived quickly too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Just see the pictures below just a little of the oils and her hair is just beautiful defined curls.</li>

      <li>The bottle is nice and big and the dropper is super long, it actually goes to the bottom of the bottle which is unusual (in a wonderful way).</li>
      <li>I have been searching for something to make my hair less frizzy and this is absolutely amazing!</li>
      <li>Unlike putting coconut oil in your hair which takes forever to wash out, the Rosehip Oil comes right out and does not leave my hair greasy at all.</li>
      <li>I jumped right in.  </li>
      <li>It looks greasy when you put it on but soaks right in.</li>
      <li>The bottle I received is really big, such a great quality and quantity.</li>
      <li>The first thing I noticed was this bottle is a really good size, it will definitely last for quite awhile specially since a little bit really goes a long way so make sure not to use more than you&#x27;re wanting</li>
      <li>and it leaves my hair looking extra healthy.  </li>
      <li>first night my oil had arrived, I had to put it to the test.</li>
      <li>i recieved it at no cost to try and review.. and will be buying more in the future</li>
      <li>The first place I tried it was on my hair.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have always heard to use rosehip oil for different ailments but I&#x27;ve never tried it, so when I was asked to try this product and provide some feedback I jumped right in.  My daughter and I both have extremely dry scalp.  We use a medicated shampoo that helps for everyday use but sometimes we&#x27;ll get a super dry patch that she shampoo does not help with.  I just dab a little of this rosehip oil on my finger and rub into the dry spot and it stops the itching and flaking pretty quickly.  The liquid is odorless so don&#x27;t worry about smelling like some kind of ointment or something.  Also, my son has eczema and I put some of this on his really rough patches when they flare up.  It cures the itching and redness and it doesn&#x27;t bother him anymore.  I just recently learned that rosehip oil is good for stretch marks so I will definitely be working on that next!</li>
    <li> Not so very long ago I was introduced to essential oils. Now I use them for so many things. I heard that Rosehip Oil was good for dry hair, skin, &amp; nails. Well, unfortunately I have issues with all 3. So trying Rosehip Oil was on my top list of things to try. My Organic Rosehip oil shipped quickly and arrived quickly too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first night my oil had arrived, I had to put it to the test. It comes with a nice dropper which makes application much easier. The first place I tried it was on my hair. From my experience, there aren&#x27;t too many things that you can try on your hair that you notice an immediate change.  With this Organic Rosehip Oil,  that was by far not the case. I could tell a significant difference just after one application. I simply applied a few drops into my palm, rubbed my palms together and applied it prior to shampooing my hair. I then simply washed my hair as usual. My hair looks so much healthier since I have started using this. It no longer looks or feels dry and brittle anymore.  It has also dramatically reduced my frizziness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since the Rosehip Oil works so well on my hair, I just had to try it on my skin and nails. The effects have been just as wonderful as they were on my hair. I simply apply a couple of drops and apply it the same. This Organic Rosehip Oil by Pure Body Naturals is my new miracle in a bottle as I like to call it. The improvement I have had with my hair and nails especially has just been amazing.  I am so glad that I was introduced to Organic Rosehip Oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received this Organic Rosehip Oil for free in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.</li>
    <li> I am finding that Rosehip Oil is one of the best things ever! My hands LOVE it and so does my hair. I&#x27;m a little OCD and use a lot of hand sanitizer and hand washing which totally dries out your hands. Not only that but I do a lot of gardening too so my hands are constantly being washed. I use this oil several times a day and my hands feel great!! So silky and smooth! It looks greasy when you put it on but soaks right in. I&#x27;ve also been rubbing a decent amount in my hands to warm the oil and then smoothing into my hair. I use a hair straightener which we all know is not good on your hair. Since using in my hair I have noticed less split ends and just an all over velvety feel to my hair. Unlike putting coconut oil in your hair which takes forever to wash out, the Rosehip Oil comes right out and does not leave my hair greasy at all. My hair shines like never before. I&#x27;m just now starting to rub into my cuticles and nails and can&#x27;t wait to see a difference in those also. This is absolutely my new favorite moisturizer. The bottle is nice and big and the dropper is super long, it actually goes to the bottom of the bottle which is unusual (in a wonderful way). While I did receive this oil for free in exchange for my honest review, I will absolutely purchase more before my bottle is empty!</li>
    <li> I love this product! I have really frizzy hair, and It doesn&#x27;t help that I use a flatiron everyday. I have been searching for something to make my hair less frizzy and this is absolutely amazing! Its organic and it smells awesome. I just apply a few drops everyday after i style my hair and it is frizz-free all day! Also, the bottle is huge! I&#x27;m going to be trying it out on my fingernails and my daughters dry skin next!! I received a discount to review this product and give my honest option.</li>
    <li> I could literally bathe in this stuff! I am a huge believer in everything Rose Hip Oil has to offer. From my skin to my hair it is an amazing essential oil. Plus this is a huge bottle that last forever....&lt;br /&gt;If you have any doubts, please give it a try. It cleared up my acne and got rid of dark sun spots on my forehead.&lt;br /&gt;It is a miracle all over your body oil. So many uses.&lt;br /&gt;It is also organic&lt;br /&gt;I was given this product at a reduced rate to help facilitate this review today.</li>
    <li> This product is really good for hair&lt;br /&gt;nails and face helps the hair  by smoothing out those frizzy ends&lt;br /&gt;helps  to soften up those dry ends from over&lt;br /&gt;This  Rosehip oil  works great on all hair type  rather  you  have dry course  to thin&lt;br /&gt;or thick  hair you need a little extra  softness  to your hair  form&lt;br /&gt;coloring or perming  or using the hot irons and blow driers !&lt;br /&gt;I have i friend who had used this product for years , she also&lt;br /&gt;agreed with me that this product is wonderful for  your hair&lt;br /&gt;I myself  use this on a weekly bases just help keep hair  feeling&lt;br /&gt;soft  manageable  !  or daily to keep the frizzes  calm&lt;br /&gt;as for the face just a few drops is all you need&lt;br /&gt;for a softer  smoother  younger looking skin with out  feeling greasy&lt;br /&gt;to help  prevent  wrinkles  and crows feet&lt;br /&gt;the nails  a drop on each rubbed in helps to&lt;br /&gt;keep the nails from drying out which causes breakage&lt;br /&gt;these are my own words&lt;br /&gt;i received  this product as a promotion&lt;br /&gt;in return for my review</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with this 100% Pure Organic Rosehip Oil by Pure Body Naturals. As a new member of the 40 and over club, I have been on the hunt for natural products to help combat the signs of aging.  I am also fairly new to the wonderful world of essential oils, but I have been doing lots of research on their benefits. Rosehip Oil is great for repairing and moisturizing dry, damaged and aging skin.&lt;br /&gt;I love that it comes in a HUGE 4 ounce bottle, with a separate glass dropper cap, so you can either use it in large amounts or by precisely dispensed drops. Another similar product only came with a screw-top lid. Every time I went to use it, I ended up with more running out of the palm of my hand rather than going on my face!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had a couple of concerns about using this on my face, because it is an oil, but my fears were easily put to rest after a week of use. At first, I was reluctant to use it on my face, because it is, in fact, an oil. However, it goes on very smoothly and absorbs almost immediately!  There is no oily residue and my skin feels wonderfully smooth. My second concern was that it might affect the way my makeup went on and wondered if my makeup wouldn&#x27;t stay on as long. After I wash my face and use toner, I apply a few drops on my entire face and neck, then I follow with moisturizer. There is no interference at all with my cosmetics, which was surprising to me. In all honesty, my makeup goes on much more smoothly and I feel like it lasts longer now!  I also have sensitive skin, and this has not irritated it at all and it is absolutely fragrance free!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This doesn&#x27;t clog my pores, at all! My face looks much better. My skin tone is more even and small lines around my eyes have a softer appearance.  I also use it on my hands and they feel amazing! I get terrible eczema in the winter and my hands suffer the most. This 100% Organic Rosehip Oil contains Vitamin A and Essential Fatty Acids. Vitamin A derivatives are Retinoids, which are wonderful for skin. I recently read in a magazine that Vitamin A is one of the Top 5 Vitamins for maintaining beautiful skin! I am very fortunate to have received this during Pure Body Naturals promotional launch, in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.ently read in a magazine that Vitamin A is one of the Top 5 Vitamins for maintaining beautiful skin!

    <li> I love love love rose hip oil. It really does leave your skin feeling silky smooth and perfect to use on your hair. If you have dry or damaged hair I would recommend this product and because you can use it on your skin it had more uses than one so you get your money&#x27;s worth. Essential oils are life changing and you won&#x27;t be disappointed with this product! Highly recommend&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;Received this item for testing and review purposes! &amp;#34;</li>
    <li> i love this oil my skin is softer and tends to not crack as much now.  I love the way my skin feels now soft and silky.  I used it on my hair as well and it leaves my hair looking extra healthy.  I have over processed hair and with this oil I can say my hair looks healthy.</li>
    <li> I am loving this Rosehip oil by Pure Body Naturals. I have very coarse curly hair that dries very quickly and I am always looking for the next best thing to keep it tamed. I add this oil to my conditioner and my hair spray and it really helps bring my hair back to life. It has so many other benefits as well such as moisturizing dry skin and fading scars and stretch marks. Its also good for treating inflammation from sunburn. This 4oz bottle is a great investment. Going to the health food stores or whatever, you will usually only find it in the 10 or 15ml bottles and they will still run you between 5-10 dollars. This oil also comes with a dropper attachment so you can still measure by drops (you really only need a few drops). When using a pure essential oil - its always good to mix with a carrier oil such as coconut or extra virgin olive oil due to the strength of the product. I would definitely recommend this item, and if I ever run out I would definitely choose pure body naturals to repurchase from.</li>
    <li> Great oil - I really like it for my hair - just a bit makes it soft and non-fly-away.</li>
    <li> Well this makes a phenomenal hot oil treatment for your hair!!!  Just warm it for about a min and them massage it into the scalp and roots.... wow!!! The difference is out of this world.  Now I do massage it toward the tips as well since I color my hair regularly.  I leave it on for about 3 mins while I am getting everything ready for the shower.  Then just wash as normal.  I also have the worst nails really, I mean brittle and the hang nails I get are awful.  So I have also started using this on the cuticles some times I soak my fingers(when I have the time) and other times I just massage it in to the nail bed and cuticle area.  I recommended this to my favorite niece the other day when she noticed that my hair was looking GREAT!...Her word.  She was super excited and gonna order it when she got home.  I am so thankful to have been given the opportunity to try this product and give my honest and unbiased opinion. Thank you !!!</li>
    <li> I received this Organic Rosehip Oil by Pure Body Naturals and I really, really like it. Rosehip has so many wonderful uses and it smells great too. The bottle I received is really big, such a great quality and quantity. If there were ever just one oil that you had on hand and you were the momma of two teen girls then I would say this is the one that you want. I get so much usage out of it, but SO DO MY KIDS. They are 14 and almost 16 years old. I use the rosehip oil on my stretchmarks and scars. I also use it to speed up the healing of my cracked feet. (I have lupus and my feet give me some peeling and cracking issues) I added some of it to my shampoo to help hydrate my hair and also because it works great to keep dandruff out of my hair. Both of my girls love it because it helps to keep their faces acne free. Rosehip can also help a wide variety of skin issues; from aging skin to sun damaged skin as well as eczema and psoriasis. It can also be very effective at hydrating skin making it appear much healthier and radiant. My skin looks shinier and smoother AS DOES MY HAIR. I am telling you, this oil is so multipurpose that everyone should have a bottle of it onhand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This oil is very easy to use and does not leave your skin or hair feeling greasy or dirty. I love the dropper that comes with it because I can use that as a form of measurement or dosing for my daughters when they are wanting to use the oil and I am not there to help them. There are no additives or chemicals so it is good for all skin types. My daughters and I all have sensitive skin, but we have had no negative reactions to this oil.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It should be noted that if you are not satisfied with this product (although with all of its uses, how you can not be is unknown to me) you can get all your money back. This product is backed with a no questions asked, complete money back promise!</li>
    <li> I have really sensitive skin and sometimes it gets oily . I have used this product that i received from karmas reviews as a tester  . And i i must say i am glad i tried it .It works great on my skin. It feels so soft and the best part is i do not break out. Its really hard to find a body lotion or face moisturizer that will not make me break out. So finally i have one product that i can use on my face and body. Bottle is a big size it thought it be smaller. Once i finish it i will be ordering it again. Definitely recommend this product to people with sensitive skin . You wont regret it .</li>
    <li> I used the product twice, I found it to be very oily and left me feeling and looking greasy. Just a personal experience, but not for me!</li>
    <li> This is a lifesaver for my skin. I suffered a bad sunburn this month. ..Ugh. . . I immediately grabbed my Rosehip Oil and applied it 2X a day.  Glad to say that my skin mended from the severe sunburn in just a little over a week. To explain how bad the burn was I have to mention that the burn caused me to have an allergic reaction to the sunburn.  I had several red bumps with white spots in the center.  This too was healed with my discounted rosehip oil that I received for review.  I am so happy with this product.</li>
    <li> I like it! . The smell the texture both are wonderful. I gave it four because I ddi not use it enough to judge its benefit. but I will make sure to update my review.</li>
    <li> Great price-I&#x27;m very satisfied.  However, if you&#x27;re looking for added vitamins or minerals in your rose oil, this is 100% rose oil-as represented.</li>
    <li> I got this for me, is good for everything hair,skin what else do you need with this!</li>
    <li> Start seeing results after first few days on stretch marks...  this is a great product.. i recieved it at no cost to try and review.. and will be buying more in the future</li>
    <li> The first thing I noticed was this bottle is a really good size, it will definitely last for quite awhile specially since a little bit really goes a long way so make sure not to use more than you&#x27;re wanting to!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I used a little bit of this Rosehip Oil on my hair and it really made my hair feel really soft and smooth. It didn&#x27;t leave my hair oily which I was kind of afraid of at first; but again I kinda figured I shouldn&#x27;t use too much. I also used a little bit on my hands because when I received it I was having a pretty dry hand day and the rosehip oil literally moisturized it a lot better than I thought it would.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The rosehip oil doesn&#x27;t smell great,to me personally,but because it absorbs so well and quickly the smell goes away in no time.I would definitely recommend this rosehip oil!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**I received a discount on this product for testing and reviewing purposes and this is my honest and unbiased opinion**</li>
    <li> This product is excellent for hair and skin. My sweet daughter had the blessing of getting great curly hair from both sides of our family Puerto Rican and Irish. Her hair is so curly that if is not moistured correctly is just a frizzy hay stack.  Just see the pictures below just a little of the oils and her hair is just beautiful defined curls. I purchase this product at a discount for my honest and unbiased review.</li>
