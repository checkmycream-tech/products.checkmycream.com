    <li> Quick delivery. Product as described.</li>
    <li> Works as well as my stylist predicted!</li>
    <li> I have been looking for a product that Osis used to make. It came in a dispenser like this, but it was a screw up solid stick like a smaller glue stick. It wasn&#x27;t wet. This product did not work in my hair which is straight with little body.</li>
    <li> I can no longer find in stores so was glad to find online.  This product is great, not too much hold just the right amount.</li>
    <li> Its a great molding paste for shot hair not greasy</li>
    <li> Good product, would recommend</li>
    <li> Very happy with my friends recommendation!  Love this product!</li>
    <li> product is great.. the problem is my hair so dont give 5 stars</li>
    <li> Nice finish! Really liked the results</li>
    <li> Product feels too greasy</li>
    <li> I love this stuff. My hair stays looking good all day. Only complaint is I have to wash it out before bed because I can still feel it in my hair. But I feel that&#x27;s actually a good problem to have!</li>
    <li> Love this.... Works really well and the price was superb!  Recommend this item and seller!</li>
    <li> A friend suggested I try this after trying it at her home.&lt;br /&gt;Worked well but would work best for someone with thicker hair!</li>
    <li> This product is one of my favorites.  You can use it to style or spike your hair.  It&#x27;s easy to wash out but very easy to re-style when in your hair.  Quick mail and great price.</li>
    <li> It was dried up and didn&#x27;t work</li>
    <li> It was recommended by my stylist but I find it to be a bit too thick straight out of the canister.
