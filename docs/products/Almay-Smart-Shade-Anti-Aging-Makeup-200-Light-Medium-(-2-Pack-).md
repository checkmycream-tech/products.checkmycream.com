    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for a few years.  Love it and very excited to find it at a reasonable price. I accidently got the smart shade (not anti-aging) and the 200 color is so crazy dark - awful.  But, this product is perfect (and we all know there isn&#x27;t really anything such as anti-aging makeup, right?). If there was, it wouldn&#x27;t cost $14 a tube.</li>
    <li> This makeup settles into fine lines and accentuates them. It says it&#x27;s anti-aging, but I found the opposite. I wouldn&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
    <li> Almaty Smart Shade is a terrific product. The shades are true to your skin shade &amp; cover very nicely. &amp; even.y. I highly recommend you giving this a try. As an old saying goes.-- &amp;#34;Try it, you&#x27;ll Like it.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> It covers well and leaves soft looking skin.</li>
    <li> Awesome value and not Cakey.</li>
    <li> Orange in Color and does not cover much.</li>
    <li> I really this make-up.  Goes on so smooth and gives just the right amount of coverage.</li>
    <li> I like this foundation because it goes on smooth and even and matches my skin tone and provides full coverage. It is not heavy nor does it feel like a mask.</li>
    <li> Love this product. I was pleasantly surprised at how it goes on and adjusts itself to my skin tone. The coverage is great and stays all day.</li>
    <li> Been using this product for a couple of years, now.  Great coverage and no skin irritation.</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin and I&#x27;ve had no problem using this product. While the color seems very light, it covers nicely.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s fine. I just wonder what causes it to go from gray to the color of my skin.</li>
    <li> I love this product, I never used foundation but needed to and tried so many, now I just use this one.</li>
    <li> I like this foundation. I blends well with my skin color and helps hide red blotchy skin.</li>
    <li> My favorite foundation. It matches and evens out my skin tone while giving it a youthful appearance. Can&#x27;t purchase this locally. Happy it is available through Amazon.</li>
    <li> I should have paid more attention to this product description. I was looking for the Almay Smart Shade makeup because it has zinc in it. This item does not and should be reapplied every 2 hours for SPF protection. However the color is good, blends in with my skin tone, and isntt too cakey. (Don&#x27;t worry if it initially goes on WHITE. It will blend.)</li>
    <li> This actually provides good coverage - goes on white like a lotion and then changes color.  I always blot mine with a slightly damp washcloth to keep it looking fresh - lasts all day.</li>
    <li> My wife has used this for years, often buying it a local department stores. She was surprised and pleased by the great value!</li>
    <li> This arrived super quickly! I tried it for the first time yesterday and really like it. The color came out perfect for my pale skin! Thanks!</li>
    <li> love this product...great on the 50 plus skin....</li>
    <li> I was very happy to find them doubled at Amazon.I like to promote the product,because its performance is the best for me,it covers spots,stays longer when sweating and helps reduce the wrinkles...</li>
    <li> It can leave streaks if you&#x27;re not really careful.  It also settles into lines.</li>
    <li> I really like this product, and it arrived promptly.</li>
    <li> This is a bonus because you don&#x27;t have to buy makeup several times a year based on skin color changes due to sun. Also, you get daily sunscreen protection, and the color is even and doesn&#x27;t settle in creases. I will never go back to regular makeup. I use without powder most of the time, but occasionally I&#x27;ll touch up with powder if I don&#x27;t want a more dewy look on my nose and cheeks. I use it with mousse blush, and it all blends perfectly.</li>
    <li> Love this make up and after seeing the great price on Amazon I only buy from them.</li>
    <li> This does not match my skin.. What a sham! I looked like a had used a bad self tanner, way too orange.</li>
    <li> Great coverage in my make up routine.</li>
    <li> I wanted something just to wear around the house instead of the Estee Lauder I usually wear for work, etc. and thought this might be a solution. This stuff comes out white (I bought medium) and has ZERO coverage - it&#x27;s more like just a moisturizer or a primer, at best. Not one bit impressed and will not buy again. I&#x27;ll use this one under something better just to keep from tossing my money in the garbage can.</li>
    <li> Love this makeup will re-order received quickly thanks</li>
    <li> I love this makeup. It feels clean when I put it on, but covers nicely.</li>
    <li> Love how it blends in to the correct shade</li>
    <li> My daughter recommended this to me after I complained that I can never find the right shade of make up. It doesn&#x27;t cover as well I would want and adding more just doesn&#x27;t look right. For a sheer light cover, which is what I want most days, it is very good on this grandma&#x27;s face.</li>
    <li> Really a great product for people who are trying to even skin tone and cover wrinkles.  It&#x27;s super light and blends in perfectly.</li>
    <li> This is definitely more medium than light,  but good for the summer.</li>
    <li> Almay makeup has always worked well on my skin.  I was disappointed when I was no longer able to purchase this product locally.  When I saw it on Amazon I was thrilled and ordered it right away.  I was not disappointed.  Thanks Amazon.</li>
    <li> I ordered this makeup based on other reviews.  To me, it&#x27;s just okay.  It provides light coverage and in order to get the coverage I prefer I needed to put a lot more on which I didn&#x27;t really like as it felt too heavy then (and using a lot more product is more $$). Even though it comes out gray, it somehow matches your skin tone, but I have a few areas on my face that need more coverage and it did not provide that. I am now using Covergirl Advanced Radiance foundation and like it much better.  Covergirl looks natural while providing more coverage.  I probably would not order this product again.</li>
    <li> I really like this makeup.</li>
    <li> It dries differently on me.  When applied it is very drying and the lines and wrinkles become considerable visible.  I don&#x27;t like it and I won&#x27;t buy it again.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s great and what a great price!  This is the makeup that I use all the time but never been able to get it at such a great price!</li>
    <li> I really like this product.  It really works to match my skin color and the coverage is sheer which I prefer over a heavier cream.  This is my go to base.</li>
    <li> Arrived quickly and just as describes</li>
