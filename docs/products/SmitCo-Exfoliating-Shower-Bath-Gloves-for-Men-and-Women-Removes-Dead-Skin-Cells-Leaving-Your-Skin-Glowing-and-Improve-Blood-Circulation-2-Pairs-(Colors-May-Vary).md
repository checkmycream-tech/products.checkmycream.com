<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Great gloves that stay on.  I&#x27;ve had others that are so loose around the wrists they slip and slide and are difficult to use.  I&#x27;ll buy these again, especially at this price ...</li>
    <li> These came in a timely manner and I cannot wait to try them out on my clients! They are a perfect size for my small hands but will stretch if you have larger hands.</li>
    <li> I was debating about getting them at first because I was afraid they would turn out like the ones you get sometimes at the store:  too big, too loose or too harsh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But these are absolutely perfect!&lt;br /&gt;The quality, feel and texture is truly outstanding!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are a must buy.</li>
    <li> I am pleased with my purchase of the Body Scrub Exfoliating Gloves.  I can use them with my regular shower gel and them put in the wash with my other bath mitts.  Before I used an exfoliating oil which worked well but left a mess in the shower.  I recommend these gloves, especially to those who use them to exfoliate before self-tanning.</li>
    <li> Everything I wanted. Not too big for my hands.  Nice and stimulating scrubbing - not too soft.  Great price and a better product than I&#x27;ve been able to find in beauty supply stores or other retail stores.</li>
    <li> 1st glove out of pkg had big tear in index&lt;br /&gt;finger, but 4 for $12 is cheap price</li>
    <li> Bought two pair as a sort of throw-away experiment because I didn&#x27;t see anything I thought would work any better. Very pleasantly surprised by the results. Not only do they really get the dead skin off, but the throw-in-the-wash solution to refresh them really works too.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t be more satisfied with this purchase.  Very quick delivery, and I was kept apprised of shipping status constantly.  The gloves are of very good quality, fit well (they don&#x27;t slip off), and the colors are very appealing.  On top of that, this was one of the most inexpensive items I&#x27;ve bought on Amazon.  Extremely good value for the price.  I highly recommend these.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I expected, very happy with this.</li>
    <li> Arrived well packaged and timely. I bought the 4-pack; nice colors. Fits my hand nicely for use on my face but stretches for my husband to use in the shower. I must use care on my sensitive face because they are rough (as they should be) but they make my face feel clean. With continued use, I hope to clear up some problem areas. My husband likes how they feel with soap or shower gel.</li>
    <li> I was expecting 4 pair according this product picture.&lt;br /&gt;But I receive 2 blue and 2 green. not white and pink.</li>
    <li> One of the best shower accessories I&#x27;ve used.  Men, it not for scrubbing those special parts.</li>
    <li> I was looking for something with real texture, like loofah gloves, for serious exfoliating. The word &amp;#34;exfoliating&amp;#34; should not be used with these gloves, ESPECIALLY not in the name of the product. These are just ordinary bath gloves and don&#x27;t exfoliate any better than a plain  washcloth.</li>
    <li> They work really well and fit nicely. Also better price than ones of less quality in the marketplace.</li>
    <li> Absolutely love this product.</li>
    <li> The seller was great about emailing update regarding shipping and checking back to make sure I received them, would definitely buy from them again!  The gloves are pretty good, I had a different pair from Bath &amp; Body works and they were a little stronger - I wanted a rougher exfoliating glove, these are a little gentler than what I wanted, but they still work great!!</li>
    <li> These are my favorite!</li>
    <li> Exactly what I wanted.  The gloves are perfet</li>
    <li> Great product! Would buy again.  Arrived on time as was as described.</li>
    <li> These gloves are fantastic.  I bought them from SmitCoLLC. The shipping was very fast.  There was a misunderstanding about the quantity of the product but SmitCo LLC was right on it before I even reviewed.  They corrected the misunderstanding with another package.  They are an excellent vendor and I will definitely buy these gloves again and from Smit Co LLC again.  Thank you!!!</li>
    <li> My favorite exfoliaters to use for personal hygiene.</li>
    <li> Scrub my face with my big hands! I was worried my hands won&#x27;t fit... they do!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Face gets scrubbed, no worries!</li>
    <li> Pardon me while I shame the writers of the five star reviews for this crap.... FOR SHAME YOU BIG FAT LIARS!  Not exactly exfoliating, but wet you can carry a six pack of beer, a five pound ham and a ten pound bag of ice in each one.  Wet it and wear as a chicken waddle hat. Wet it and wrap it around your house three times.  Okay that last was a slight overstatement.  But you get my point.  I wasted my money so you don&#x27;t have to waste yours.  Your welcome.</li>
    <li> Good product and arrived on time, but I misread the product and thought I was receiving four pairs, but it says 4 per pack meaning two pairs; so,I just thought I let someone else know just in case they are thinking the same way I was.</li>
    <li> These gloves are exactly as you would expect. However, the photo is misleading because it pictures eight gloves, while you only receive 4. They were nicely packaged and work just as expected.</li>
    <li> These are great. I use them on my face everyday, and on my body when I&#x27;m going to spray tan. You can really feel the difference after you&#x27;ve used these - your skin feels SO smooth and soft.</li>
    <li> “By far my favorite gloves I&#x27;ve used!”</li>
    <li> If you have sensitive skin don&#x27;t buy cause it is rough. But it worked for me and leaves your skin feeling soft.</li>
    <li> Gloves come in pairs and although the wording didn&#x27;t specify \\&quot;pair\\&quot; it was assumed. They should reword their description as two pair and not \\&quot;4 per pack\\&quot; which is very misleading. I haven&#x27;t tried them yet and will probably send them back just on principal alone.</li>
    <li> These gloves changed my life! What more can I say about them?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PROS:&lt;br /&gt;1) Thoroughly clean your skin.&lt;br /&gt;2) Makes it feeling smooth.&lt;br /&gt;3) You get a greater sense of cleanliness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;1) The price. You can get cheaper ones at Target or Walmart, but if you&#x27;re a student like me with no access to them, Amazon is the next best thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;FAQs&lt;br /&gt;1) Can I wash my face with these? NO!&lt;br /&gt;2) How many gloves come in this pack? 2 pairs (or 4)&lt;br /&gt;3) How often should I change them? Once a month. So this pack lasts 2 months if you are using 1 pair at a time.</li>
    <li> Just what I wanted and work just as advertised.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my face, but it&#x27;s harsher than I thought. So I use it once every 3 days for a deep cleansing and exfoliate without once every week or two. However, if purchasing this for your body, I think it would be good.</li>
    <li> These are okay, nothing to write home about. They are cheaply made, so you have to be extra careful or you can rip a hole through them quite easily. In the future, I would probably go with more expensive ones that would be higher quality.</li>
    <li> These gloves are excellent! I have long fingers, but they stretched just fine. My skin feels so good! :)</li>
    <li> Very nice exfoliating glove. Arrived quickly.</li>
    <li> The fit well and stay on and have just the right amount of scrub to make you feel exfoliated, tingly and clean.</li>
    <li> This product really gets off the dead skin. Leaves skin super smooth. I was pleasantly surprised. It&#x27;s course enough to do the job.</li>
    <li> Quick delivery.  Used gloves several times and love the way my skin appears and feels afterwards.</li>
    <li> I ordered a pack of these gloves and i am very happy with them. My skin feels much smoother now.  I find the glove design easier to use than exfoliating scrubs, loofahs, or brushes.  You and easily use the exfoliation glove in the shower.  And after exfoliation with the glove, my body lotion sinks better into my skin for silky hands, elbows, knees, feet, and elsewhere! This is a great beauty product!</li>
    <li> I received this product rather quickly. I have never used these types of gloves before. But I needed them due to the water being used from overseas. I wanted to rejuvenate my skin. The gloves are awesome because they are not to hard and not to soft. They feel perfect and I can see/feel the difference in my skin already.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Thank You.</li>
    <li> I bought these as early Christmas gifts.  They were great hits and everyone has enjoyed them greatly...including me.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> Excellent fit for a medium to small hand. Happy.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my wife and daughter for exfoliating prior to their spray tans.  They said they worked great.</li>
    <li> Nice bright colors, good quality, and a great value. Would recommend to others.</li>
    <li> Christmas gift for my daughter and mother.. They love it. They say there skin is super smooth since they are using the gloves ... I need to order my self some now</li>
    <li> These gloves are perfect! They are high quality - great exfoliation because they aren&#x27;t flimsy like what is sold in big box retailers. I thought the price was great too for two pairs. Seller delivered on time and is great to deal with - from the placement of the order to follow up after the purchase they want to have satisfied customers and I am one of them!</li>
    <li> OK. I&#x27;m sure the product is great. But in the photo it shows 4 PAIRS of gloves, and that&#x27;s what a 4 pack is. I got 2 sets of gloves. A blue and a green. I&#x27;d like the remainder of the 2 gloves too, or at least the company needs to put up a more accurate description of what you&#x27;re getting. NO where on this site does it say 4 pack means 4 gloves. Who uses one glove at a time?!</li>
    <li> First time using these so i didnt know what to expect. I like them they do their job. I got them because i tend to get ingrown hairs on my legs when i shve and now my leg hair grows normally and my skin is softer.  I fell like their pretty rough but i feel like thats how its suppose to feel.</li>
    <li> i ordered these gloves about a week ago, i cant believe how soft my legs feel! i bought them to help me get some color in my legs (takes away dead skin cells) and so far i believe its working! also theyre great for your feet! :)</li>
    <li> Great gloves! I use them for exfoliating before applying self-tanner. Love them and can&#x27;t beat the price!</li>
    <li> I was unable to find them in the dollar store so I ordered these. Don&#x27;t be fooled like I was -- It&#x27; 4 pieces, not 4 pairs like I thought. They are fine and they&#x27;re colorful, but who really cares about the color. I was after price.</li>
    <li> These look and feel alright but the proof will be in the bathing and&lt;br /&gt;I am sure it will serve its purpose....</li>
    <li> These are great !!! Great colors and they work really well! Very happy with purchase</li>
    <li> Fast delivery and good product.  It feels excellent on skin.  I doubt they hold up for too long though.  Mine are starting to snag.</li>
    <li> I have only had them a week but so far I love them...</li>
    <li> Got here very fast the gloves are great</li>
    <li> Received these from my mother-in-law years ago and have been hunting for them ever since. Now my husband has decided he loves them also and I only had one left. Found them here. Thank You!&lt;br /&gt;Jan</li>
    <li> After having received a pair of these as a gift, I was delighted to find a source so that I could gift them to friends as well.  A wonderful bathing experience!</li>
    <li> I received the gloves within specified time frame. The gloves are a little bigger than other brands I purchased but they work just as well.  I was disappointed to see that I was actually only ordering 2 pairs of gloves, a pink pair and a green pair. From the picture and description, I though I was buying four pair and was impressed with the price, however I was fooled by the four different colors in the picture.  Nonetheless I have the gloves and I am using them everyday with my favorite soap to keep my skin exfoliated and clean.</li>
    <li> Really nice to exfóliate</li>
    <li> The gloves are great. After using them my pores are opened and refreshed.</li>
    <li> Came fast, excellent quality, and works great! This item was exactly what I was looking for, and clears up those dead skin cells right now.</li>
    <li> The gloves work great, as advertised. Have been using them for a month with no problems. Seem to hold up well.</li>
    <li> These gloves are adequate, though they seem to be similar to what I could purchase at a dollar store, which would be much cheaper than these.</li>
    <li> I love this product, i love the way my skin feels after using the gloves. This is truly on of the best skin exfoliation products made.</li>
    <li> My skin has never felt better using these gloves with the St. Ives Body Wash Purifying Sea Salt Exfoliating Body Wash.  I had never exfoliated before, but these gloves made it super easy.  Plus, there are so many, I gave one to my sister-in-law to use!</li>
    <li> Love them. Came so quickly. Neatly packaged and ready to use. They exfoliate so well. Definitely a must have for healthy skin.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve fallen in love with these gentle, effective exfoliating gloves; the difference in my skin was noticeable after the first use. I received a pink pair, and sea foam green pair which was perfectly fine; the green pair is used for my body, the pink is face only. The price is very affordable because you get four body scrub gloves (2 pairs).  I&#x27;m very pleased with this purchase and highly recommend them.</li>
    <li> The body scrub is really good,  it came with two pairs. It really did it job, after use you can feel how clean your skin feels. I will definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> Just used these last for the first time last night and they&#x27;re amazing!! I used to exfoliate with a wash cloth but these are so much better. My skin was SO much softer after using these. Great price too!</li>
    <li> They are too small for man hands. I don&#x27;t care what color they are (mine were pink and sparkly), I&#x27;m the only one in the shower, usually.  They do stretch a bit, but not enough for me. If they make a larger size, I would buy again.</li>
    <li> These are great so far but i thought when I ordered it says you get 3 pairs of gloves now it says 4 pairs but in any case i only received 2 pairs. I haven&#x27;t washed/dryed them in our washing machine and dryer yet</li>
    <li> First time using exfoliating gloves. I really liked how they were not too rough/scratchy but just enough. My skin felt really clean afterwards. So they did their job.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always used the puffs to exfoliate, but this glove product is a much better idea. They fit fine &amp; the elastic cuff holds the glove firmly on the wrist.</li>
    <li> For the most part, these are good.  However, I saw that a few strands were already tearing after the 2nd use.  I don&#x27;t expect them to last a lifetime, but I&#x27;m also not willing to replace every couple of weeks.</li>
    <li> Arrived in excellent condition and will reorder again when necessary.</li>
    <li> They arrived quickly, are as advertised.  The same gloves available in most pharmacies or big box stores.  Was nice to have it delivered directly to my home though.  Seems to work well - skin feels great after a shower with these.</li>
    <li> There is nothing majorly wrong with these gloves however for me personally, they don&#x27;t do the job ( I want them to) they are softer than the gloves I usually get from the body shop. I to scrub down really good and when I used these, I felt like I was using a wash cloth... and that&#x27;s a no no for me. I want a good scrub (not skin tearing of course) to exfoliate my skin. I didn&#x27;t return, but will not buy these again. Other than that, they are pretty good gloves.</li>
    <li> I love these gloves!! I had gotten a pair years ago as a gift and I used them often. It was finally time to get new ones but I couldn&#x27;t find them anywhere. I finally found these on this site and at a great price. Very pleased with this purchase!</li>
    <li> I love these gloves!  I&#x27;ve been looking for exfoliating gloves that really give me a good scrub in the shower.  Others I&#x27;ve used become soft when you wet it, and they stretch out quickly from the first use!  These gloves are firm without scraping you skin off and I feel refreshed after my shower. I plan to get some for my sister.</li>
    <li> Excellent! Love the colors! They worked great!</li>
    <li> These gloves are thinner than my usual brand of exfoliation gloves, but the elastic is much stronger and I predict they will last longer than the other more expensive gloves I have used..  We&#x27;ll see.  I&#x27;m pleased with my purchase.</li>
    <li> These gloves are very sturdy and fit me perfectly! What I like the most (other than the excellent quality) is that they stay in place and don&#x27;t slide off of my hands while in use. The colors are gorgeous too!</li>
    <li> I am absolutely  in love with these gloves. In fact I loved them so much I told my hubby he had to try them which he loved too. Now we both have a pair.</li>
    <li> Fabulous exfoliating gloves, even application!</li>
    <li> The gloves fit well and stay on. They are pretty scratchy but not too harsh for my face. They feel really good on the body. I&#x27;m happy.</li>
    <li> Fair price, great product</li>
    <li> Came super fast and are quality scrubbing gloves! Excellent price too:)</li>
    <li> Great gloves but I got a whole package of pink and dark pink gloves.  My sons and husband not too pleased</li>
    <li> These come with no real brand name, they appear generic with only an added on sticker stuck to the bag. They are not aggressive at all. I will stick to the BASS brand exfoliating gloves after this purchase.</li>
    <li> after first usage i found that These gloves expoliate really well,  you can really feel and see it working. Left my skin smoother than it has ever been.  One problem is that it started to wear at the fingertips,  so sadly I wont be using that part of the glove to expoliate anymore.  But other than that it&#x27;s a great purchase.</li>
    <li> i thought i was getting four pairs per pack... not 4 gloves per pack. thats why its 2 stars for me.</li>
    <li> I bought these gloves for a good body exfoliating scrub and they sure do work. Easy to use in the shower and definitely increase the lather from the soaps. Especially great to get a good foot scrub and they rinse out quite easily.</li>
    <li> Love all the colors except the pink.  Hate it!  Everything else is satisfactory.  Ordering process was smooth and arrival prompt.</li>
    <li> Soap this up with regular bath/shower gel and give yourself a scrub. I used it even on my face where it really rejuvenates the skin. Feels like a tough scrub but my skin seems to like it. The glove hasn&#x27;t worn out yet after some months.</li>
    <li> While I got the four pairs of gloves advertised unlike some reviewers I have read, one glove (a blue one) came out of the package with a nickel sized hole where the thumb met up with the index finger.  The other three pair were okay so the problem wasn&#x27;t big enough to send them back but the only use I have for the remaining blue glove is as a replacement if one of the other color gloves gets damaged.  As of now I won&#x27;t be ordering from this company, SmitCo LLC, again.</li>
    <li> Arrived quickly. I usually buy these at Target, but decided it would be cheaper to pick them up in larger quantities. Thank you.</li>
    <li> I actually purchased these gloves to use on my face &amp; neck for dry body brushing.  They feel really good on my face,but are actually a little scratch on my hands when I put them on.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very happy with my purchase! My hands are pretty small and these gloves fit just right, but will stretch to bigger hands as well. The texture is just right for daily washing and non-aggressive exfoliating.</li>
    <li> My daughter introduced me to these--I Love them! I have one pair for face and one for body.</li>
    <li> Definitely worth the price, my skin feels a lot softer since using these with an exfoliate scrub.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t get enough of the body scrubs, I love it and I need more. Good price for them and I&#x27;ll recommend it to anyone who uses the body scrubs</li>
    <li> I have really bad bumps and ingrown on my legs and arms. It&#x27;s only been my second week of using it but it already feels softer. You won&#x27;t see results especially with bad ingrown by just using this item alone. But the difference in softness is a plus. As well as the ease of gloves in the shower for self exfoliating you can do it in 5 mins or less and honestly if your always in a rush you get theglove on and its much easier theN using a cloth or luffa ball cause those thinges are nOT rough enough. The glove itself is rough but not so rough that you feel like your ripping skin off. I use the gloves with regular soap sometimes exfoliator scrub(2 or 3 times a week) and lotion afterwards, then at night I put on tend skin for my ingrowns it smells like pure alcohol but I really feel a difference I usually get waxed and the lady that waxes me swears by it. the best part is you can use it all over. I think for those people who it didn&#x27;t work for. It&#x27;s not about the one item. It&#x27;s about finding the right combination. Hope this works out for you</li>
    <li> Great product!  I use these to prepare for self-tanning.  Much better than any of the exfoliating creams or products and far cheaper.</li>
    <li> Feels like it scratches my skin when used.  I&#x27;m assuming it&#x27;s supposed to in order to get the dead cells off.  Don&#x27;t really notice a difference in my skin though,</li>
    <li> Love the gloves. Great exfoliation at a good price.</li>
    <li> these glove leaves the skin nice and soft. my husband and I have been using them combine with dove liquid soap your skin will feel like heaven afterwards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;my husband has very bad acne on his back and using these his skin already started to improve.</li>
    <li> I like the glove, but the ad is confusing as to if you get 4 gloves or 4 pair.  It is 4 gloves FYI.  They are more difficult to get on and off, as I have big hands.  We&#x27;ll see if they hold up over time.  I wish they allowed you to pick colors, mine came in white and purple.</li>
    <li> ordered it got 2 pink gloves 6&#x27;5 covered in tattoos got 2 pink gloves</li>
    <li> Nice gloves, not too stiff or rough.  Great customer service!  One of the gloves received was defective and I responded to an email from Francina Smit inquiring about my purchase.  She replied the next day stating that she would send out a replacement without charge.  True to her words, a replacement set was received in about a week.  Thank you.</li>
    <li> I had problems with flaking skin between my knees &amp; feet also between my elbows &amp; wrists.  I picked up these gloves &amp; use them when I shower &amp; no longer have that problem.</li>
    <li> Makes showering easy.</li>
    <li> Love these gloves. Theyre not too rough yet get the job done. I&#x27;ve been using them for about two weeks and they seem to be holding up well. Even my fiancé uses them on my back.</li>
    <li> Very good quality! fast shipping!</li>
    <li> One size fits all (they looked awfully small at first glance).  Leave you feeling clean, and yes invigorated; but that is loofa for you.  Great buy.</li>
    <li> My only complaint is that they are a little tight, they could be looser but they do the job.</li>
    <li> Not for the whole family... they are very impractical, save our money, dont buy these you will not like them.</li>
    <li> Came really quickly, just as advertised. They&#x27;re gentle but exfoliating, my bikini wax lady says it&#x27;s the only thing she knows to prevent ingrown hairs is to use these types of gloves so hoping she&#x27;s right.</li>
    <li> Wonderful body scrub, been looking to buy them and could not find them in any store, and of course Amazon had them, good price and you get 4 pairs, and now I know where to find them</li>
    <li> I heard about these gloves from a friend. I have used them over the last 3 days and can see and feel the difference in my skin.  My skin doesn&#x27;t look dry any more. This is going to be my new gift to friends.</li>
    <li> I was really debating on getting these gloves.  I was worried they&#x27;d be the ones that were really soft, and I was looking for something more like a loofah feel (these aren&#x27;t as rough).  I am SO glad I just went and bought these.  They are perfect!  My skin feels so nice and smooth!  The colours are bright and colourful! They fit my hands perfectly without giving me that webbed finger look!  Just great!  I would definitely recommend these to anyone looking for a product like this.</li>
    <li> Recently, two friends asked me why my skin was so soft, after they had touched my arm. I immediately ordered them these gloves. I only use them about once a week. They leave the skin so soft. I really recommend them.</li>
    <li> It suits its purpose but they ripped the second time I used them.  They could be made from a more durable fabric.</li>
    <li> Somewhat too scratchy but otherwise ok.</li>
    <li> I bought these because I couldn&#x27;t find any locally. I&#x27;m pleased I did. They are somewhat thicker than my usual gloves. they lather up really well and give your skin a good scrub leaving you feeling nice and clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;EDIT Dec 18 2013.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well these glove have seen considerable use and I&#x27;m happy to say they&#x27;re just a good as the day I bought them.</li>
    <li> I use these gloves on my arms and legs to prevent ingrown hairs from waxing and shaving. They do a great job for the price, and they&#x27;re very easy to use. The difference isn&#x27;t very dramatic, but my skin has definitely been smoother since I started using these gloves. I will definitely purchase them again!</li>
    <li> These gloves are PERFECT for exfoliating after a bikini wax. The elastic keeps them on and they&#x27;re machine washable. Highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I USE THESE TO DEFLESH MY CARAPACE.</li>
    <li> these gloves are great they remove all the old skin and make the body feel very clean and soft</li>
    <li> When I was visiting my sister, I noticed she used exfoliating gloves when she gave her a cocker spaniel a bath. I ordered these as a gift for my sister and her pet. She was very surprised to receive them and enjoy the day they came in different colors!</li>
    <li> Sorry I didn&#x27;t know about this product earlier!!!</li>
    <li> These do a great job at exfoliating. A little harsh on the skin but I love them.</li>
    <li> A bit of a tight fit on my hand but it stretches so no big deal. Just the right amount of scrub.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I was looking for and at a great price!</li>
    <li> Easy to buy, fast delivery, effective product!</li>
    <li> Combined with LindyBay Body Scrubs, Coconut scrub, these gloves are a joy.  It feels so great and refreshing to scrub with these gloves.  My hands are medium-sized and putting them on when they were wet works much better than dry.  The best thing is they can be washed, though I plan to put in a zippered bag to keep them from stretching out of shape.</li>
    <li> These little gloves work great.  They stretch to fit my hands and provide an excellent exfoliant.  Not too abrasive, not too soft, just perfect.</li>
    <li> These gloves are really well made and work great. It&#x27;s nice to have 2 pair so I can pack one for travel. They rinse clean and dry quick. Would buy again.</li>
    <li> good but will snag. good price for quantity and quality</li>
    <li> I love this glove!!!! I use a lot of exfoliating soap and lightening agents. So I would have very visible dead skin on my face and body. However when I bought these gloves they were GONE! the first time I used it I could tell a HUGE! difference in my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this to anyone, especially if you use exfoliating soaps.</li>
    <li> They came in handy thx.</li>
    <li> They feel a bit funny to put on first, but they do a great job.  Not too hard on the body.  I put some soap on them and that helps glide the gloves along. Would buy again.</li>
    <li> A totally unremarkable purchase.  In a good way.  Gotta love easily replaceable bath gloves.  Nice to have a steady source that will deliver to my house.</li>
    <li> Excellent quality and it works great!  When you first take them out of the package you think wow these are not going to last long but they really are durable!  We are still on our 1st pair (after 6 months of use) and they still look new!  It is amazing how fast you can exfoliate your entire body with these gloves.  Exfoliating has always been one of those things we dread because of all the time an effort but with these you can go head to toe in minutes and it feels great.</li>
    <li> I love the gloves. They actually exfoliate the skin without scratching the skin. My body looks and feels much more refreshed. It is exciting to hear that I can just pop em in the washer to clean them.</li>
    <li> The textured surface of the gloves are just coarse enough to gently exfoliate and remove the dead skin cells. I was worried at first that the gloves would be too small (it seemed like it when I first opened the package) but it stretches to a comfortable fit when it&#x27;s wet and the elastic around the wrist keeps it in place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The gloves not only exfoliates your skin but apparently it improves blood circulation as well and I must say it left my skin glowing and soft.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another benefit is that I can use much less of my favorite, fairly expensive shower gel since the glove increases the lather quite a bit which makes for a real treat every time I use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Compared to $5 per glove, this price is very good and I will certainly purchase the product again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tip: Since there&#x27;s 4 gloves per packet, I use 2 at a time when I&#x27;m in a hurry to get the job done even faster.</li>
    <li> great gloves and got them very quickly</li>
    <li> The Gloves work really well. Will buy from seller again</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only ever used scrubs (like, liquids or gels with abrasive beads in them) in the past, and I never particularly enjoyed it because I feel like it&#x27;s quite rough on my hands, and its also messier and not as easy in a shower. I&#x27;ve used these gloves twice now, and I love them so much, I can&#x27;t imagine using anything else to exfoliate. I use them with my regular moisturizing shower gel - squirt some in my gloved hands, and then go to town on my legs especially and then everywhere else. The first time I used them, the water washing the soap off was brown-ish - that was dead skin!!! I do the rest of my body more gently, and when I took the gloves off my whole body felt infinitely softer. I can&#x27;t even tell you how ridiculously soft and clean I felt after that first scrub. I waited to review after the second time I used them (about a week after the first time) and this time the water was clear (so I clearly had a lot of dead skin and just general grime the first time) but the post-scrub softness was the same. It feels so good!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can&#x27;t comment on the durability of the gloves, but they&#x27;re still as good as new after two uses, and I bought the two-pack, so it looks like I&#x27;ll be set for a while.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sorry if this review was TMI. I&#x27;m very, very happy with these gloves!!</li>
    <li> not as nice and stiff as I like when wet, but certainly good enough to keep and use until they should be replaced.</li>
    <li> large enough for big hands and being able to use fingers to get to all areas is a plus as opposed to a big bulky loofa thing</li>
    <li> I bought these gloves bc I had purchased an epilator and it said you should exfoliate for a few day before to help not get ingrown hairs. To be honest, I don&#x27;t take very good care of my skin. I don&#x27;t use lotions, I used to do horrible things like dry shave when I was in a rush, i never bother taking my makeup off, i don&#x27;t use sunscreen, and I never exfoliated. But now I think I&#x27;m hooked! I use the gloves everywhere and my skin is glowing, super smooth, and I have had little to no break out since I started using them. I find myself wanting to take better care of my skin now that its so smooth. The gloves fit my hands but also my husbands which is nice. Oh, also my tattoos look great! They are looking darker since I have been getting rid of all that dead skin on top. I&#x27;m super happy and will buy again!</li>
    <li> Work very well to exfoliate and stimulate skin.</li>
    <li> How excited should a man get about &amp;#34;exfoliating gloves&amp;#34;?  Well, they stretch to fit even large hands; put one on each hand (they don&#x27;t have to fit perfectly) add soap and rub.  I use them every 3 days or so as I don&#x27;t think (what do I know) that you don&#x27;t have to exfoliate every day.  From hair to toes (that&#x27;s where I think they work the best).  Think I will send some to my sister-- ah, maybe not.  too personal.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping, awesome exfoliator gloves! Would deff buy again. Leaves my skin smooth.</li>
    <li> Excellent product - great service!</li>
    <li> The item arrived a few days after i ordered it which was great, the only problem is that i receive 2 pairs and one of the pair was a different color each glove.</li>
    <li> Excellent it last a really long time and does work very well, I recommend this product to anyone, but picture is misleading it shows color blue, white, pink and green I only received blue and green.</li>
    <li> Used the gloves twice, they are not too harsh and scratchy.  I travel to the Caribbean a lot, so even with sunscreen my skin gets tanned.  These gloves appear to help with any flaking or peeling that occurs after exposure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I put my body wash right in the palm of one glove, rub them together for suds and then scrub away.  Quite easy.</li>
    <li> the gloves fall apart very easy and i wish they would fit better and were thicker,and were made better than they are</li>
    <li> Great size- preform as promised- Mine have not molded- rinse &amp; hang on towel rak to dry-  scratchy just enough to remove my thyroid dry skin- -</li>
    <li> I thought these were well worth the price-- I have definitely noticed a difference in the softness of my skin and the shine, and the way it accepts moisture. I use them every couple of days, because I don&#x27;t want to irritate my skin. I have also noticed a sharp decrease in ingrown hairs/razor bumps after shaving my legs!</li>
    <li> I really like the skin exfoliation these provide.  The only downside is that they absorb so much shower gel, I find myself using considerably more than I do when just using a bath pouf.</li>
    <li> It serves the purpose.. It would be nice if they come in more colors...and sizes... Would be nice if it has a small pocket for small soap</li>
    <li> I Love these gloves!  They fit perfectly and feel great...just like the ones my esthetician uses.  So easy to use instead of a mitt, loofah, or other exfoliating accessories.  Seller was friendly, prompt, and the product was received as promised...great customer service.  Also, love the colors!</li>
    <li> These gloves make exfoliating your body so much easier.</li>
    <li> The gloves feel great, the fit is perfect.  Can&#x27;t wait to get into the shower each day to use them</li>
    <li> Awesome can take a shower with out them</li>
    <li> I have keratosis pilaris (chicken skin) and bought these to try to smooth out the red bumps on my legs and arms.  I saw improvement in the size of the bumps after just one use.  Great exfoliation, I didn&#x27;t feel these were too harsh or anything.  I don&#x27;t think these are going to fix my KP by themselves, but they will be an asset to my routine combined with other treatments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4 stars because I have never purchased other gloves that I can compare these to.</li>
    <li> Good gloves but not the best I have ever used.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I wanted.  Performs as advertised.</li>
    <li> Pleased with my purchase!</li>
    <li> I love these gloves. $3.00 per pair is a bit steep considering that they have no loop for hanging in my shower, and that they are basic exfoliating gloves. I do like that I could get 4 different colors because I&#x27;m buying them for my family of five people. We prefer assigning a color so that we will be exclusive to our own gloves for hygienic reasons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do wish that I could order these by color. It seems no one offers them with the option to pick your color when ordering. My children are three boys, and the colors offered are usually very feminine. My sons are grown and pastels aren&#x27;t really their &amp;#34;thing&amp;#34;. Please, offer color choices in your purchase options so that we can follow our color guidelines per individual user.</li>
    <li> In my experience, there are thin and thick versions of exfoliating gloves. I prefer the thick - these are the thin. They&#x27;re fine for what they are, but if you want the thicker, more absorbant, luxurious gloves, you&#x27;ll need to pay a little more.</li>
    <li> EXCELLENT VALUE ~ EXCELLENT PRODUCT&lt;br /&gt;Highly Recommend ... wonderful for exfoliating</li>
    <li> The exfoliating quality of these gloves is fine. I especially like the tightness of the fit on the wrist, so that the gloves do not slip off during use.</li>
    <li> I really like these gloves.  They make exfoliation quick and easy.  I use one color for my face and another color for my body.  The a Seller was terrific.  She personally followed up to ensure I received the gloves.</li>
    <li> Better then other gloves like this. I&#x27;ve had others just slip off my hand. This one has a snug cuff on top and it fits well ... and works well.</li>
    <li> Great gloves. Scratchy enough to do their job and gentle enough to not hurt you. I use a pair for my face (mostly on my t zone) and it make my skin look super healthy. I will be buying again.</li>
    <li> Scrubs well and fits perfectly in my large hands.</li>
    <li> Two exfoliated thumbs up.</li>
    <li> Great gloves. Would be 5 stars if they had loops to hang them with, cause they hold water like a sponge and really should be hung to dry.</li>
    <li> Item arrived quickly, the gloves are as described and work nicely</li>
    <li> Great value for your money! I am really enjoying my gloves, especially now that summer is around the corner. These are great to use right before a spray tan. My only concern was that they wouldn&#x27;t fit my hands since they look pretty small on the picture, but they have enough stretch to fit any size hand. Would definitely recommend to a friend!!</li>
    <li> Exactly what I was looking for, spa like results and inexpensive! These gloves are not too rough or soft on skin but just right for exfoliating. Will definitely be a returning customer.</li>
    <li> The gloves came in on time and I absolutely love me. This is the third brand of exfoliating gloves that have tried an I have definitely struck gold! The gloves stretch to fit my hands and they aren&#x27;t too harsh either. And the price for 4 gloves is great!</li>
    <li> The gloves are as nice described by other happy users. They provide a refreshing  exfoliation..</li>
    <li> Very pleased with my purchase!</li>
    <li> I bought these because the price was right and am impressed at the quality. They&#x27;re excellent and I would buy again - they also arrived quickly! Happy.</li>
    <li> Heavenly &amp; just what I needed to scrub my body since my skin is very thin &amp; sensitive.  I&#x27;m so glad this product was available to me and all the tips the reviewers gave so I knew they would work before I bought them.  Great price &amp; product.</li>
    <li> Scrub a dub dub- these gloves are fun. I ordered a 4 pack of these exfoliating gloves as something to try after I had read they were a good option to use prior to applying self tanner. I have used the same pair 3-4 times now. They aren&#x27;t crazy abrasive- which is good since I don&#x27;t want to scratch my skin off. But I would compare them to a standard body puff. The perk is, I feel you get a more thorough cleaning/exfoliating experience.. As you can feel and be certain all areas have been scrubbed.. For instance like between your toes :)  I used body wash on mine and didn&#x27;t use bare gloved. They fit snugly, but not uncomfortable. If gloves are damp, they are a little more work to get on, as are any item that is damp.  Color didn&#x27;t concern me, but I recieved springtime colors of blue, pink, purple and green. I imagine a pair will last awhile since I probably won&#x27;t use each and every shower, but I will use atleast twice a week. A great alternative for your standard body scrub puff that are fun to use.</li>
    <li> These gloves are really good.  Will continue to buy when they wear out!</li>
    <li> Very nice gloves. I like the color and they fit really well. I felt so much smoother after the first use!!! :)</li>
    <li> While traveling in Ireland this summer, one of our guest baths featured a pair of these gloves and I became quite enamored. These gloves are just scrubby enough to be refreshing, but not so harsh as to hurt. And they&#x27;re not just for faces-- all but the most (ahem) tender body parts benefit from sudsy exfoliation. Great at home, great for travel.</li>
    <li> Arrived very quickly and the gloves are as described.</li>
    <li> Sellers was quick. Excellent product for the price. Just rough enough for me. Felt great AFTERWARDS. During, well it&#x27;s rough.</li>
    <li> Great price, great quality, timely arrival, size fit my hands.</li>
    <li> I washed these in the washing machine like the product recommended, used the delicate cycle and 2 of the gloves came out with runs in them, similar to panty-hose. These are too expensive to be ruined the first time I wash them. I&#x27;ll be trying other brands now.</li>
</ol>
