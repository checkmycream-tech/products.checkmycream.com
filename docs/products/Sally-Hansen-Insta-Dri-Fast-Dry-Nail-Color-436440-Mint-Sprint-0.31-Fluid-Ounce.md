      <li>The color is SO bright</li>
      <li>/&gt;TL;DR Insta-Dri is good but don&#x27;t buy the mint sprint color</li>
      <li>so it&#x27;s good for when you need to paint your nails but don&#x27;t have a lot of time.</li>
      <li>i got the Mint Sprint color, and it&#x27;s really gorgeous :</li>
      <li>Add this beautiful mint green color to that already awesome nail polish line-up, and you&#x27;ve got yourself one heck of an awesome nail polish.</li>
      <li>2 coats of color and one coat of top coat Insta Dri, in under one hour conservative drying period I&#x27;m washing dishes, feeding my goats, chickens, playing with my dogs, all without ruining my mani!</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t wait to add more colors to my collection!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m 50 now and done with doing my own pedi&#x27;s, I&#x27;ll keep doing my mani&#x27;s though! :-)</li>
      <li>Love it!</li>
      <li>The color is amazingly vibrant.&lt;br /&gt;Four</li>

      <li>okay I got this nail color and the top coat</li>
      <li>I love the Sally Hansen Insta-Dri nail polishes for both myself and my daughters.  </li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>I would recommend a top coat too because it adds shine</li>
      <li>It does stay on for a 3-4 days, IF you add a top coat (I used Revlon).</li>
      <li>This is my favorite color.</li>
      <li>this is actually INSTANT- awesome</li>
      <li>This color has to be one of my favorites, however almost all the colors are appealing for this line.</li>
      <li>I hope this review helps :)</li>
      <li>So for the price paid, its an okay deal.</li>
      <li>) I really love the color!&lt;br /&gt;2)</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>and it holds up much better than many of the others I use,</li>
      <li>Sprint Mint is a great vibrant color with a pop.  </li>
      <li>it makes it really easy to apply and most of my nails are done in one stroke.</li>
      <li>Insta-Dri by Sally Hansen is great in general.</li>
      <li>but now I&#x27;m fine.</li>
      <li>And since it only takes one coat for full coverage, it&#x27;s great for people who like to get creative and do designs on their nails.</li>
      <li>Also great is the fact that you really only need one coat.</li>
      <li>Pretty spring Color and dries very quick!</li>
      <li>I already used her top coat with great success, glossy shine and quick drying for regular polishes.</li>
      <li>First and foremost, the fast drying abilities of these nail polishes are wonderful, but I also love that the brushes are large and flat.</li>
      <li>and it wasn&#x27;t true.</li>
      <li>I also love how reasonably priced this is for the quality of the product.</li>
      <li>The color is true to the picture online.</li>
      <li>thick brush is great!</li>
      <li>I took off one on this product because it is starting to chip after 4 days, which i guess is good for a quick</li>
      <li>totally awesome product dries so fast I don&#x27;t have time to mess it up</li>
      <li>The polish dries quickly with shine.</li>
      <li>Did not chip quickly.</li>
      <li>This color really appealed to me as we move into Spring and this seemed like such a happy color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I also applied Sally Hansen MEGA SHINE - Extended Wear Top Coat, and the polish lasted six days with normal activity.</li>
      <li>This is such a cute color!</li>
      <li>Fun for summer or spring</li>
      <li>I got it because I had been looking around for a minty green color for a while and liked this shade most from all the ones I&#x27;ve seen.</li>
      <li>I couldn&#x27;t decide between this and a Revlon polish, so I asked a few people in the store which they liked better and 2 of 3 said this one.</li>
      <li>I just wish I was better at applying nail polish in general.</li>
      <li>polish removes super fast as well.</li>
      <li>It goes on thick, smooth, glossy, and bright.</li>
      <li>It dries quickly and 1-2 coats cover very well.</li>
      <li>Dries very fast.</li>
      <li>Overall, I love the color and its use.</li>
      <li>case you miss them on the first stroke.</li>
      <li>It is a fun color to wear, but it comes out much brighter than it appears in the bottle.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t feel embarrassed anymore after the first day or two.</li>
      <li>then on one nail the nail polish  popped off whole!</li>
      <li>The color you get is exactly as shown here.</li>
      <li>When I first opened it and saw the brush I was thinking \\&quot;wth is this?!\\&quot;.</li>
      <li>The new polish stays on looking great for an average of 5+ days despite me!</li>
      <li>saying it dries in a minute is a stretch, it really is quick dry, and pretty much completely smudge-proof after about 10 minutes ( as in it&#x27;s safe to unbutton jeans at this point</li>
      <li>Goes on very easily and dries very quickly but can&#x27;t put more than one coat or gets really mushy and messy and peels within a few days.</li>
      <li>I only had to apply one coat and the color is amazingly bold!</li>
      <li>Actually dries fast, has a nice, big brush for easy application, and it wears well for several days.</li>
      <li>Thanks</li>
      <li>The nail polish dries really fast</li>
      <li>Thanks Amazon...</li>
      <li>but I just wished it had really insta-dried as advertised.</li>
      <li>My manicure lasts me the whole week!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I ended up really liking it though.</li>
      <li>This is also the first nail polish I have found that dries in time for me to take care of my 9 month old and not have it smudge or rub off.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m going to try using a smaller brush from one of my other nail polish bottles that I barely use, so I can apply this color more easily.</li>
      <li>Its good that this nail paint is dark and just a single coat or two is enough to get that rich pigment as the bottle looks like.</li>
      <li>and you can do normal things with your hands).</li>
      <li>My younger daughter has ALWAYS smudged her nails before they were dry, so this product has been a fabulous find!  </li>
      <li>But it will start to chip off right from the next day.</li>
      <li>Sally Hansen Insta-Dri is my new swear-by product.</li>
      <li>a general comment, the colors are a little strange: a lot of really bright colors (yellow, bright blue, green...).  </li>
      <li>so if u don&#x60;t mind chips and the whole nail polish popping off on the second day get this nail polish , if not I wouldn&#x27;t recommend .</li>
      <li>In other words, while the surface did dry very quickly, the thickness of the polish means that the lower layers did not dry nearly as quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>We have the Mint Sprint (my new fav), Brick Blue and Going Grape.  </li>
      <li>When this bottle said you only need one coat, it really meant you only need one coat.</li>
      <li>I recently purchased this nail polish with the hopes of finding a polish that I could put on in one coat without applying a second coat and would dry quickly.</li>
      <li>So I decided to try the opposite: something that dries fast and that I could re-apply several times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>This literally dries instantly- not like the fast dry ones I&#x27;ve used before-</li>
      <li>Faster than old regular polish oddly enough.</li>
      <li>However, the polish is fluid and doe not going on as smooth as other brand without a little bit of patience.</li>
      <li>It takes less than 10 minutes to dry and the color is so bold that only one coat is necessary!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I have used the Insta-Dri Sally Hansen brand before, and it worked great, however the item I received is terrible, the brush is all stuck together, the polish is pasty and therefore impossible to apply properly. I wanted to return it but apparently it is not possible with this item, so I guess I just wasted 4 dollars... Thanks Amazon...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Edit: A friend told me she didn&#x27;t understand why I didn&#x27;t like this product, and she gave me \\&quot;280 Rapid Red\\&quot; to try. I love it. I went to Walmart, they have a bunch of colors there, and the \\&quot;mint sprint\\&quot; color seems to be the only one that is really bad. It separates and becomes gooey. Every single bottle of that color did the same thing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;TL;DR Insta-Dri is good but don&#x27;t buy the mint sprint color</li>
    <li> Great color. The color you get is exactly as shown here. Comes out on your nails the same as shown too.</li>
    <li> Sally Hansen Insta-Dri is my new swear-by product. It goes on thick, smooth, glossy, and bright. It dries in less than half the time of normal polish. The wide set applicator took me a little getting used to but now I&#x27;m fine. I also love how reasonably priced this is for the quality of the product. This color has to be one of my favorites, however almost all the colors are appealing for this line.</li>
    <li> This is a great polish. It takes less than 10 minutes to dry and the color is so bold that only one coat is necessary! My only complaint is that is is really hard to take off with nail polish remover. It is also slightly darker than the picture shown here. Other than that, I highly reccomend this.</li>
    <li> I went shopping today and was looking for a minty green color for my nails for spring. I couldn&#x27;t decide between this and a Revlon polish, so I asked a few people in the store which they liked better and 2 of 3 said this one. I painted my nails tonight with this and now I want more of these Insta-Dri polishes ASAP!! When it said on the bottle that you only need one coat, I was a little skeptical because I&#x27;ve read that before on other polishes and it wasn&#x27;t true. When this bottle said you only need one coat, it really meant you only need one coat. The color is SO bright and it&#x27;s a thick polish so one coat of this would be like 2 coats of a regular polish. When I first opened it and saw the brush I was thinking \\&quot;wth is this?!\\&quot;. It comes with a brush with flat bristles instead of your normal, everyday nail polish brush. I ended up really liking it though. It made the application way easier and I only had to do 2 strokes on each nail. It dried in about 60 seconds like it promises. I can&#x27;t wait to add more colors to my collection!</li>
    <li> I recently purchased this nail polish with the hopes of finding a polish that I could put on in one coat without applying a second coat and would dry quickly. This color really appealed to me as we move into Spring and this seemed like such a happy color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) I really love the color!&lt;br /&gt;2) Only one coat needed. This polish is very thick so there was no need to apply a second coat at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) Though this polish appeared to dry quickly, really only the surface dried quickly. I thought my nails were completely dry and put on a pair of jeans about 30 minutes after I had applied this nail polish. The nail polish smudged while I was buttoning my jeans like they would if they were wet. In other words, while the surface did dry very quickly, the thickness of the polish means that the lower layers did not dry nearly as quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) Though this polish did not chip nearly as badly as other polish I have used and as quickly, I did start getting small chips around the tips of my nails the next day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I do like this nail polish and it holds up much better than many of the others I use, but I just wished it had really insta-dried as advertised.</li>
    <li> Excellent nail polish. It dries quickly and 1-2 coats cover very well. The color is true to the picture online.</li>
    <li> Its good that this nail paint is dark and just a single coat or two is enough to get that rich pigment as the bottle looks like. But it will start to chip off right from the next day. So for the price paid, its an okay deal.</li>
    <li> Pretty spring Color and dries very quick!</li>
    <li> All polishes should be Insta-dri...  Great color.</li>
    <li> This literally dries instantly- not like the fast dry ones I&#x27;ve used before- this is actually INSTANT- awesome</li>
    <li> This is my favorite color. The nail polish dries really fast so it&#x27;s good for when you need to paint your nails but don&#x27;t have a lot of time. The brush is also shorter and flat so it&#x27;s a lot less messy.</li>
    <li> Insta-Dri by Sally Hansen is great in general. Actually dries fast, has a nice, big brush for easy application, and it wears well for several days. Add this beautiful mint green color to that already awesome nail polish line-up, and you&#x27;ve got yourself one heck of an awesome nail polish. And since it only takes one coat for full coverage, it&#x27;s great for people who like to get creative and do designs on their nails.</li>
    <li> This is such a cute color! I keep looking at my nails and saying that! I just wish I was better at applying nail polish in general.</li>
    <li> okay I got this nail color and the top coat , I painted my nails this color , and the day after already there was chips! then on one nail the nail polish  popped off whole! so if u don&#x60;t mind chips and the whole nail polish popping off on the second day get this nail polish , if not I wouldn&#x27;t recommend . I hope this review helps :)</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not proud to say this, but I&#x27;m one of those nail biters and pick at my nails a bit. No polish other than the Gels last for more than 2 days before my manicure looks like crap. I&#x27;m also an RN who washes her hands constantly as well as uses alcohol based hand sanitizers 20+ times a shift.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Then along comes Sally Hansen Insta dri colored polish. I already used her top coat with great success, glossy shine and quick drying for regular polishes. The new polish stays on looking great for an average of 5+ days despite me! I am NOT kidding! I don&#x27;t feel embarrassed anymore after the first day or two. My manicure lasts me the whole week!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just 2 coats of color and one coat of top coat Insta Dri, in under one hour conservative drying period I&#x27;m washing dishes, feeding my goats, chickens, playing with my dogs, all without ruining my mani! No fans, no UV lights.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The polish removes super fast as well. Faster than old regular polish oddly enough. I cannot recommend this polish highly enough. Thanks Sally, you&#x27;ve set the bar for home manicures, I&#x27;ve even recommended this product to my salon! Not sure how that&#x27;ll work out, I&#x27;ll probably just bring in my Sally for my pedicures next time. I&#x27;m 50 now and done with doing my own pedi&#x27;s, I&#x27;ll keep doing my mani&#x27;s though! :-)</li>
    <li> Goes on very easily and dries very quickly but can&#x27;t put more than one coat or gets really mushy and messy and peels within a few days.</li>
    <li> The color of the beautiful.</li>
    <li> Good color, dries fast, Couple of coats and good to go. Good product and would purchase more from this manufacturer.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t like the color but my daughter loves this</li>
    <li> Love it. Dries very fast. Only needed one coat. Did not chip quickly. Perfect color. Fun for summer or spring</li>
    <li> The person I gave it too really liked it. Said she was about to use it. I don&#x27;t have personal experience with it.</li>
    <li> A couple of years ago I stopped using nail polish, because I wanted something durable without paying $25. However, the durable nail polishes always left marks after letting it dry for hours. So I decided to try the opposite: something that dries fast and that I could re-apply several times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Better quality than I expected. It seriously dries fast (less than an hour and you can do normal things with your hands). It does stay on for a 3-4 days, IF you add a top coat (I used Revlon). I would recommend a top coat too because it adds shine (otherwise, it&#x27;s dull).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As some people complained about, the brush is quite large. I&#x27;m ambidextrous so that wasn&#x27;t a problem for me. But as a little tip of advice: just circle the brush on the side of the bottle before applying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a general comment, the colors are a little strange: a lot of really bright colors (yellow, bright blue, green...).  Not a lot of neutrals. Biggest disappointment: No black, which I hope I will find soon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conclusion: This polish made me want to color my nails again. That is saying something.</li>
    <li> I am kind of disappointed with this product. I got it because I had been looking around for a minty green color for a while and liked this shade most from all the ones I&#x27;ve seen. The brush it comes with is very flat and wide, which I didn&#x27;t know when I purchased this nail polish. It ends up being messy to apply and uncomfortable to use, especially since it becomes inconvenient to polish the sides of your nails in case you miss them on the first stroke. The color is also very messy and hard to remove, because it spreads easily and makes the skin around your nail a blue/green color. It is a fun color to wear, but it comes out much brighter than it appears in the bottle. I&#x27;m going to try using a smaller brush from one of my other nail polish bottles that I barely use, so I can apply this color more easily. Don&#x27;t think I will be buying another Sally Hansen nail polish though.</li>
    <li> Sprint Mint is a great vibrant color with a pop.  The brush is flat and wide. I found that convenient, since I have wide, flat nails. However, the polish is fluid and doe not going on as smooth as other brand without a little bit of patience. The polish dries quickly with shine. I also applied Sally Hansen MEGA SHINE - Extended Wear Top Coat, and the polish lasted six days with normal activity. Overall, I love the color and its use.</li>
    <li> totally awesome product dries so fast I don&#x27;t have time to mess it up and the colors are fantastic!!!!!  will always buy this product</li>
    <li> I applied \\&quot;Insta-Dri\\&quot; nail polish by Sally Hansen two days ago and haven&#x27;t gotten a single chip in the color yet! This is also the first nail polish I have found that dries in time for me to take care of my 9 month old and not have it smudge or rub off. I only had to apply one coat and the color is amazingly bold! I would definitely recommend this to the busy-on-the-go customers out there!</li>
    <li> Color is great, nail polish is great, just came leaking out of the container...</li>
    <li> i got the Mint Sprint color, and it&#x27;s really gorgeous :D&lt;br /&gt;although saying it dries in a minute is a stretch, it really is quick dry, and pretty much completely smudge-proof after about 10 minutes ( as in it&#x27;s safe to unbutton jeans at this point lol)&lt;br /&gt;The thick brush is great! it makes it really easy to apply and most of my nails are done in one stroke. Also great is the fact that you really only need one coat. The color is amazingly vibrant.&lt;br /&gt;Four stars only because i never give out 5. I took off one on this product because it is starting to chip after 4 days, which i guess is good for a quick dry.&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m a HUGE Sally Hansen nail polish fan :D</li>
    <li> I love the Sally Hansen Insta-Dri nail polishes for both myself and my daughters.  My younger daughter has ALWAYS smudged her nails before they were dry, so this product has been a fabulous find!  We have the Mint Sprint (my new fav), Brick Blue and Going Grape.  First and foremost, the fast drying abilities of these nail polishes are wonderful, but I also love that the brushes are large and flat. The whole process from painting to drying is less than 2 minutes.  Love it!</li>
    <li> Not only is the color of this not mint it starts peeling soon as you put it on. Don&#x27;t waste your money</li>
