      <li>THE PERFECT SUMMER MIST TO SOFTLY SCENT AND  </li>
      <li>This is a nice perfume to have the smell stays on all day and is very strong at first which is nice, and also is cheaper then buying in the store.</li>
      <li>Seller was courteous and professional, shipping time was great and</li>
      <li>I must say that I ordered this without sampling and based on the reviews and I am SOOO glad I did.</li>
      <li>Let me just start by saying that this used to be one of my favorite scents.  </li>
      <li>and I have received many compliments.</li>
      <li>THIS SCENT IS LIGHT &amp; REFRESHING WITH WARM TONES.</li>
      <li>Mon and sister love this</li>
      <li>ITS MY FAVORITE SCENT..</li>
      <li>I GOT SO MANY COMPLIMENTS</li>
      <li>love this smell, there is some caramel, vanilla on it.</li>
      <li>I love the body cream and bought this to enhance the lovely perfumey skin it gives me.  </li>
      <li>I love how it smells and feels</li>
      <li>I love this fragrance.</li>
      <li>I prefer fruitier scents and while I&#x27;m sure someone can appreciate it, it just isn&#x27;t for me.</li>
      <li>, I love it</li>
      <li>This scent is fabulous!</li>
      <li>Every body ask me what perfume I use when I wear this. :)</li>
      <li>Loved the lotion so much I ordered this product</li>
      <li>Quite strong.</li>
      <li>This means that it became strong, pasty and even makes me dizzy</li>
      <li>It will be WAY too strong to handle.</li>
      <li>THE SELLER SHIPPED QUICKLY ALSO!</li>
      <li>The product came quick!</li>
      <li>I immediately picked the wonderful old from the odiferous new bottle.</li>
      <li>This reminds me of a hug, it may sound strange but this is a warm and comforting honest hug that you don&#x27;t want to let go :)</li>
      <li>A friend I was picking up at the airport was wearing this Cashmere Glow fragrance,and I liked it so much I asked her about the fragrance.</li>
      <li>I understand that manufacturing fragrance and persons own body has an influence on a fragrance, but there was a distinct difference between the original and the new fragrance to me and my wife.</li>
      <li>My absolute favorite scent from bath and body works.</li>
      <li>The old smelled wonderful, and the new smelled like old perfume smells.</li>
      <li>It shipped quickly, but the caps on the bottles were both cracked and in pieces.</li>
      <li>For a body spray that is so light, it definitely has a lasting lingering beautiful smell.</li>
      <li>But so worth it</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s an exciting scent to me</li>
      <li>Pleasant and cozy though.</li>
      <li>product is nice, soft and long lasting but just not the same incredible scent that Breathe Comfort</li>
      <li>THANKS!</li>
      <li>WHEN I FIRST ORDERED THIS..</li>
      <li>They smell good, scent just doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
      <li>It says it has peach tones, but it smells really musky.</li>
      <li>I really like the size of the bottle, the nozzle, and the spray amount.</li>
      <li>Thanks</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;ll buy this in other products like lotion and body wash because I love it so much.</li>
      <li>SO NOW I ONLY USE IT SPARINGLY FOR SPECIAL OCCASIONS..</li>
      <li>I will admit to being a super taster and smeller, but my wife could also tell the obvious difference.</li>
      <li>Maybe it is in my head, but it has a sharp, cheap scent to it.</li>
      <li>is a FABULOUS addition to some of the other scents.  </li>
      <li>She said it was the new bottle I had bought her.</li>
      <li>Soft, sweet, subtle but strong enough to give a hint of mystery and spice.</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I loved the scent.</li>
      <li>I asked her to bring both bottles out and spray them on different sides of the doorframe without telling me which was the new, and which was the old.</li>
      <li>We are throwing both the new Eau de Toilet, and the Mist in the garbage, and using the old until it&#x27;s gone.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s too bad because it smelled great when I started using it.</li>
      <li>not only it stinks but its super strong</li>
      <li>Lasts a few hours, maybe four and lingers on skin a few more if you press your nose up to your skin that is.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t feel like I put it on heavy at the first of the day</li>

    <li> I love the smell ! Every body ask me what perfume I use when I wear this. :)</li>
    <li> Did not smell as good as the one bought from Bath and Body Works. Maybe it is in my head, but it has a sharp, cheap scent to it.</li>
    <li> A friend I was picking up at the airport was wearing this Cashmere Glow fragrance,and I liked it so much I asked her about the fragrance. She told me, and  I purchased this \\&quot;same\\&quot; product plus the Eau de Toilet for my wife. Later, our friend said that since her husband didn&#x27;t comment on this fragrance over the last several months like I did, she was giving her bottle to my wife. Last week, my wife was wearing this fragrance, and I asked her what in the world was that smell. She said it was the new bottle I had bought her. I asked her to bring both bottles out and spray them on different sides of the doorframe without telling me which was the new, and which was the old. I immediately picked the wonderful old from the odiferous new bottle.The old smelled wonderful, and the new smelled like old perfume smells. I will admit to being a super taster and smeller, but my wife could also tell the obvious difference. We are throwing both the new Eau de Toilet, and the Mist in the garbage, and using the old until it&#x27;s gone. I understand that manufacturing fragrance and persons own body has an influence on a fragrance, but there was a distinct difference between the original and the new fragrance to me and my wife.</li>
    <li> I love this fragrance. Smells amazing!</li>
    <li> I love this fragance!! is sexy and  is ideal for work!!</li>
    <li> This is a nice perfume to have the smell stays on all day and is very strong at first which is nice, and also is cheaper then buying in the store. Its almost a vanilla smell</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I loved the scent. I would have bought it from Bath &amp; Body Works but it is cheaper here. I really like the size of the bottle, the nozzle, and the spray amount. However, after about two months of using, the scent has become overwhelmed by the smell of the alcohol ingredient. I spray this and I cannot smell the &amp;#34;cashmere glow&amp;#34; that I paid for anymore. It&#x27;s too bad because it smelled great when I started using it.</li>
    <li> I got this body spray before at the mall and I loved it! It has a warm creamy smell to it like a mix of vanilla and cream. I also get compliments when I were this body spray and it last. I don&#x27;t have a car so it&#x27;s hard for me to get to the mall to get another bottle. Anyway, the price for this product is great. I am happy with my purchese and I recommed this product and seller!</li>
    <li> This was told to me to be &amp;#34;just like &amp;#34; the Breathe Comfort line of scents at Bath &amp; Body Works. Well, close but not really the same.&lt;br /&gt;This product is nice, soft and long lasting but just not the same incredible scent that Breathe Comfort was.&lt;br /&gt;They made a BIG mistake in retiring that line of bath soap and lotion.</li>
    <li> Loved the lotion so much I ordered this product and I love it too! Use it all the time! Awesome products!</li>
    <li> I will never buy this again the lotion stinks but this body mist really stinks I will never ever buy again not only it stinks but its super strong</li>
    <li> My absolute favorite scent from bath and body works. On here I got it for less than $9 compared to B&amp;BW price which is like $12-14. I&#x27;m a very happy customer about this product!</li>
    <li> Mon and sister love this</li>
    <li> ITS MY FAVORITE SCENT..I GOT SO MANY COMPLIMENTS WHEN I FIRST ORDERED THIS..SO NOW I ONLY USE IT SPARINGLY FOR SPECIAL OCCASIONS..I HAVE 500 OTHER BBW SPRAYS SO IM FINE LOL</li>
    <li> amazing smell, I love it</li>
    <li> This is a fall and winter scent. Very thick and leaves a touch of that alcohol smell behind until it is worn off a bit. Quite strong. Pleasant and cozy though. Lasts a few hours, maybe four and lingers on skin a few more if you press your nose up to your skin that is. Definitely not a warm weather type of scent. This will be waiting for me until the holidays roll back around.</li>
    <li> This scent is fabulous!</li>
    <li> They smell good, scent just doesn&#x27;t last long.</li>
    <li> This was well received, but I wouldn&#x27;t buy it for myself.</li>
    <li> came in great time, was just what it was suppose to be i have no complaints on the service or the product smells great</li>
    <li> This was bought as a christmas gift for my sister. She loves this fragrance and I&lt;br /&gt;have tried it and I think I will buy some for myself.</li>
    <li> Great Product! It smells heavenly! This is one of my favorite body sprays!</li>
    <li> MY daughter is very happy with it.</li>
    <li> The product came quick! Smells wonderful. The lids all came taped was hard to peal open. But so worth it</li>
    <li> Item was received as expected. Thanks</li>
    <li> I love the body cream and bought this to enhance the lovely perfumey skin it gives me.  I love how it smells and feels and I have received many compliments.</li>
    <li> Let me just start by saying that this used to be one of my favorite scents.  Unfortunately, when they changed the packaging on all of the signature collection, they also added more ingredients to ALL of the signature sprays: including SHEA.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shea is a FABULOUS addition to some of the other scents.  However, Cashmere Glow ALWAYS smelled like shea to begin with.  This means that it became strong, pasty and even makes me dizzy sometimes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NEVER pair this with the lotion and NEVER pair it with the shower gel.  It will be WAY too strong to handle.</li>
    <li> Love this smell!! Definitely a favorite! No over powering it&#x27;s amazing my boyfriend loves it. My little sister steals it! It is great!</li>
    <li> love this smell, there is some caramel, vanilla on it. It remember something from Chritsmas, chilhood.. It a very nice smell.</li>
    <li> I am always getting compliments when I wear this product. I love it! I would definitely buy this product again.</li>
    <li> It says it has peach tones, but it smells really musky. I prefer fruitier scents and while I&#x27;m sure someone can appreciate it, it just isn&#x27;t for me. It shipped quickly, but the caps on the bottles were both cracked and in pieces.</li>
    <li> Love the smell of this!</li>
    <li> For a body spray that is so light, it definitely has a lasting lingering beautiful smell. It doesn&#x27;t feel like I put it on heavy at the first of the day and that&#x27;s what I like. It&#x27;s an exciting scent to me and I&#x27;ll buy this in other products like lotion and body wash because I love it so much.</li>
    <li> THIS SCENT IS LIGHT &amp; REFRESHING WITH WARM TONES. THE PERFECT SUMMER MIST TO SOFTLY SCENT AND  LAST THRU OUT THE DAY. THE SELLER SHIPPED QUICKLY ALSO! THANKS!</li>
    <li> In 100% perfect condition. Will be buying this and from this seller again! :) Thank you!</li>
    <li> I must say that I ordered this without sampling and based on the reviews and I am SOOO glad I did. Seller was courteous and professional, shipping time was great and did I mention: Yum! Soft, sweet, subtle but strong enough to give a hint of mystery and spice. This reminds me of a hug, it may sound strange but this is a warm and comforting honest hug that you don&#x27;t want to let go :)</li>
