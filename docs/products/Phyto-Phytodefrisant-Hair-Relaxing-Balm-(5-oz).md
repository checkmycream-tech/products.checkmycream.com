      <li>And thanks to the vendor, I received it well before the estimated delivery date - thank you!</li>

      <li>Sure enough, the consistency should be viscose.</li>
      <li>I only gave it 4 stars because if I want my hair stick straight and very smooth</li>

      <li>Well, I still have very frizzy hair even after using this product for a month and following the directions accurately.  </li>
      <li>This product that I received is very liquid in form.  </li>
      <li>that much cheaper straightening balms couldn&#x27;t</li>
      <li>It keeps the frizzies away in both straight and curly days.  </li>
      <li>, it was very old and so very very runny ,almost as water</li>
      <li>I have used this product for many years and as other reviewers have stated, the consistency should be a gel.  </li>
      <li>Unfortunately, this deal is indeed too good to be true.</li>
      <li>I have found that you really have to invest the time to style it properly (as per the package directions), but it is SO worth it.   </li>

      <li>It is clearly marked on the item that it is 3.4 ounces!</li>

      <li>My only problem is that occasionally I get a tube that&#x27;s very liquidy.  </li>
      <li>I still have to flat iron it, but I&#x27;ve never seen a product get my hair as straight as this one does with only blow drying.</li>

<li> I want to say I love Phyto products, I was disappointed with THIS particular product though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
<li> I have the same problem as other buyers, I received a smaller version of the product!</li>
<li> /&gt;It left a white residue on my dark hair and it didn&#x27;t do anything</li>
<li> Leaves my long hair lustrous and manageable.</li>
<li> You do have to blow dry with it as it&#x27;s heat activated.</li>
<li> I bought this product thinking that it will be easier to blow dry it, buy</li>
<li> I just wash it, put this product in, dont touch it until its completely dry, scrunch it out</li>
<li> I have curly hair as is dry too.  </li>
<li> could not live without it for my curly, unruly hair.</li>
<li> This seller sold a product that is old ot not authentic.</li>
<li> I have extremely thick, coarse, frizzy hair; I thought I had finally found the one and only solution.  </li>
<li> It spilled everywhere, so I have nothing but an empty tube.</li>
<li> A little goes a long way.</li>
<li> Considering the fact that it&#x27;s pretty expensive, they should remedy this problem.  </li>
<li> My hair has felt greasy or coated and weighted down by other products.....but never by Phyto.  </li>
<li> I contacted the supplier and they would not replace it and it was not worth returning</li>
<li> Don&#x27;t be hassled by buying a watered down product and then needing to return it.</li>
<li> I believe the company who is distributing this product has watered it down and then is selling it at a reduced price.</li>
<li> I did use the watered down version and my hair was a tangled mess.  </li>
<li> I have alternated with some less expensive products on and off, but I always come back to Phyto.</li>

<li> It was like water and therefore useless!  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This Phytodefrisant Hair Relaxing Balm (5oz.) product is not what I think I purchased in the local store.  This product that I received is very liquid in form.  The consistency between a thin liquid and a light nectar consistency.  I think I remembered it to be in a &amp;#34;gel&amp;#34; consistency.  This is probably why I received the product with plastic tape over the cover of the tube.  Nevertheless, I am using it and it is doing it&#x27;s job, but it has to stand upright, to keep the liquid from running out.</li>
    <li> I have curly hair as is dry too.  I bought this product thinking that it will be easier to blow dry it, buy I do not see any difference using this product that when I don&#x27;t use it.  To me it looks the same.</li>
    <li> All Phyto products work great for me (with the sole exception of hairspray). I have alternated with some less expensive products on and off, but I always come back to Phyto. Leaves my long hair lustrous and manageable. Worth the cost.</li>
    <li> Best hair product that is all natural. could not live without it for my curly, unruly hair.</li>
    <li> This is the only product I&#x27;ve found so far that really straightens my hair without a flat iron. I have fine, thick hair that is curly in some places, wavy in others, and completely straight on the top layer. You do have to blow dry with it as it&#x27;s heat activated. I only gave it 4 stars because if I want my hair stick straight and very smooth I still have to flat iron it, but I&#x27;ve never seen a product get my hair as straight as this one does with only blow drying.</li>
    <li> I have very dry, very frizzy, very coarse Caucasian hair. This product is amazing! It is the only product I use now. I have found that I have to use quite a lot (about 2 quarter-size dollops) for my shoulder length hair. I have also found that when I finish blow drying my hair it sill looks somewhat frizzy, but once I run the straightening iron over it my hair is super soft, silky, and smooth. I have found that you really have to invest the time to style it properly (as per the package directions), but it is SO worth it.   On a side note, I loved this product so much that I tried the shampoo and conditioner by the same company, but I was really disappointed and chose not to by them again.</li>
    <li> This product is the best.  No overpowering smell, smooth and pleasant on your hands (no sticky goop), makes your hair soft/manageable/movable, and most of all, smooth.  The 5 oz is big enough to last years, which is a bonus because I&#x27;m planning to own and use this product the rest of my life.</li>
    <li> I have the same problem as other buyers, I received a smaller version of the product! It is clearly marked on the item that it is 3.4 ounces!</li>
    <li> This product normally is a gel consistency but the one I got was clearly old and spoiled.  It was like water and therefore useless!  Could not return it because I did not have the box and packaging anymore.  Will not use his vendor again.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for many years and as other reviewers have stated, the consistency should be a gel.  I have bought 2 bottles from this seller and in both cases, the product was a liquid and spilled everywhere when opened.  I did use the watered down version and my hair was a tangled mess.  Do not purchase from this seller.  I do not know why Amazon continues to let this seller sell watered down or even fake product.</li>
    <li> Not Happy - Phyto is a great product I have used it many times before. This seller sold a product that is old ot not authentic. It is brown water in a tube and should be a balm. I would have sent it back to get my money but when i opened the product (which was unsealed) It spilled everywhere, so I have nothing but an empty tube.</li>
    <li> This is a very good product which I have used for many years.  However, the product I ordered on Amazon, did not have the usual consistency of a serum.  It is more like a liquid and pours out of the tube.  I ordered this before with the same outcome.  There is nothing on the packaging to indicate this is a different product.  It is either old or inferior in manufacturing.  If it were the right consistency of what I get at Sephora or Nordstrom, it is a five star product.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for several years. Unfortunately, this deal is indeed too good to be true. I ordered this 5oz version and when I opened it, the serum ran out of the tube like water.  I have been using this product for several years and love it. I have always purchased it from my hair salons.  I wondered about the consistency, so I compared it with my opened tube from my salon. Sure enough, the consistency should be viscose. Not like water.  I believe the company who is distributing this product has watered it down and then is selling it at a reduced price. I should have heeded some of the customer reviews.  Don&#x27;t be hassled by buying a watered down product and then needing to return it.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product based on a bunch of positive reviews I found on the internet. This product did not work as well for me as it seems to do for a thousand others.  I have extremely thick, coarse, frizzy hair; I thought I had finally found the one and only solution.  Well, I still have very frizzy hair even after using this product for a month and following the directions accurately.  The blow drying ritual is still the same, and I still have to use my very hot flat iron to tame the frizz.  It doesn&#x27;t matter what product I use, the process ends up being the same.  It wasn&#x27;t worth the $30 I spent.</li>
    <li> HI........&lt;br /&gt;Most product&#x27;s Phyto Phytodefrisant have been used and the results were very, very amazing .....&lt;br /&gt;I do not want to dispense with the curse .....&lt;br /&gt;I have won my admiration</li>
    <li> I like the product when it is fresh, it was very old and so very very runny ,almost as water</li>
    <li> I had forgotten how much I love this product, which I used years ago when Frederic Fekkai recommended it (before he became the celebrity he is today). My humidity worn hair looks and feels great now.  And thanks to the vendor, I received it well before the estimated delivery date - thank you!</li>
    <li> If you have hair that frizzes easily, you will love this product.  It&#x27;s not heavy or greasy and leaves your hair feeling clean.&lt;br /&gt;I have used this for a number of years and anytime I have tried something new it has not measured up.  My hair has felt greasy or coated and weighted down by other products.....but never by Phyto.  My hair will still frizz....but only on very humid days.  Slight humidity is not the problem it once was and when the weather is good my hair looks healthy and shiny.....despite my age and the fact that I have colored it for many years.  I often use this product over Redken&#x27;s Time Reset Corrective Defense  ( Do NOT confuse it with Redken&#x27;s Smooth Lock stay sleek which is heavy and disgusting).</li>
    <li> I want to say I love Phyto products, I was disappointed with THIS particular product though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It left a white residue on my dark hair and it didn&#x27;t do anything that much cheaper straightening balms couldn&#x27;t do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Phyto is a great company and I enjoy their other products but I will not buy this again.</li>
    <li> I have always had naturally wavy-curly hair. I never wear it natural because its so frizzy. I decided to do some research and read &amp;#34;Curly Girl Handbook&amp;#34;. Along with the techniques outlined in the book and this product Phyto Phytodefrisant Hair Relaxing Balm. I just wash it, put this product in, dont touch it until its completely dry, scrunch it out and my hair is shiny, curly and most of all NOT frizzy. I plan to always have this product on hand.</li>
    <li> i have used bought and used this product for years and love it.  HOWEVER, when I ordered  from this supplier it came so watery that it was unusable.  I contacted the supplier and they would not replace it and it was not worth returning so I just threw it away.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for many years and it really works well straightening my wavy hair.  My only problem is that occasionally I get a tube that&#x27;s very liquidy.  like the last time I purchased it.  It still works but I think not quite as well.  Considering the fact that it&#x27;s pretty expensive, they should remedy this problem.  I would buy a different product if I could find one that works as well.</li>
    <li> its ok, Kerastase is better</li>
    <li> I love how lightweight this product is but still tames the frizzies and makes it shiny and manageable.  Been using it for years.  Would highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I received….only 3.3 oz.  per each item not 5oz as it described, and the liquid was terrible, very thin, not the same thickness as usual. I thought it might be fake</li>
    <li> I love this product and have used it before - I would recommend it in the future for people to try</li>
    <li> Great value!  This is my secret weapon in hair care products.  It keeps the frizzies away in both straight and curly days.  I wear it everyday!!</li>
    <li> This is the best hair care product I&#x27;ve ever used! I hope that you have a great day today, tomorrow and everyday!</li>
    <li> This product is perfect for fine hair that tends to look frizzy at times. It relaxes and helps control the hair and the look!  My daughters all use it now (as they inherited my hair texture) and their hair has never look consistently better!</li>
    <li> I am an African American woman with type 4c hair and this product works well in relaxing the curl pattern and also thiickening up the hair. I use it after my conditioner has been washed off, just before blow drying. Make sure you do not use a lot as it might leave a residue on your hair. A little goes a long way. It makes the hair soft and helps a lot with frizz. I can definitely tell the difference in my hair.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this for years and it makes my hair soft and smooth.&lt;br /&gt;You can even use it between washings.</li>
    <li> Yeah! no frizz. love this in cold or hot weather keeps the frizzies away and smooths hair without a film</li>
