      <li>But if you&#x27;re looking to get a GREAT at-home mani/pedi, this is not the product for you.</li>
      <li>lol</li>
      <li>I love these buffers, they work great!</li>
      <li>I loved the way my nails looked, but i dont like the quality.</li>
      <li>But the price was good.</li>
      <li>i am orderinf more of these now, iuse them ALL the time!</li>
      <li>I liked my buffers but not what I was looking for.</li>
      <li>But got worn out very easily.</li>
      <li>it very nice works good don&#x27;t have nothing to really say about this</li>
      <li>Bought a different brand and it works awesome.</li>
      <li>If you are just looking for something cheap and simple, this product is great.</li>
      <li>Cheap</li>
      <li>So, if you are looking for a cheap \\&quot;buffing cube\\&quot; for a shine, don&#x27;t buy these.</li>
      <li>Long to ship but works good.</li>
      <li>Great product, does seem to give off a dustiness when filing not sure what that is but its works well.</li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t comment on whether it will fall apart yet as I just started using it, but thought others might be interested to know, since I thought it had grit on all 4 sides.</li>
      <li>fast shipping.</li>
      <li>It isn&#x27;t much help on anything else.</li>
      <li>but it wasn&#x27;t any better not worth it at all</li>
      <li>They are not for shining the nail only for filing down imperfections on the top of the nail.</li>
      <li>The smoothest side is gentle enough for my 8 month old&#x27;s nails.</li>
      <li>but I guess it really needs to be used only on finger nails.</li>

<li> Basic buffer does the trick but like the rest it starts to disintegrate over time, especially when you get it wet.</li>
<li> This product did not wow me.</li>
<li> It is functional but seems a little smaller than ones</li>
<li> I just received this item and I&#x27;m not sure if the seller changed suppliers, but it only has grit on 3 sides, not four.  </li>
<li> This works just as well as any other one.</li>
<li> Cut these buffers in half for nail shows....</li>
<li> Would recommend to use for buffing acrylics and other nail enhancements not for plain manicures.</li>
<li> Nothing special about this but nothing bad either</li>
<li> I mean its just a nail buffer not much to it</li>
<li> It&#x27;s hard to distinguish the difference in each side.</li>
<li> not a good nail buffer at all...</li>
<li> I was really disappointed because the item was junk.</li>

    <li> This product did not wow me. It is functional but seems a little smaller than ones I have used locally and seems to desolve faster.</li>
    <li> I liked my buffers but not what I was looking for. They are not for shining the nail only for filing down imperfections on the top of the nail. Some of my buffers were bend and ruined in the package though. Would recommend to use for buffing acrylics and other nail enhancements not for plain manicures.</li>
    <li> Worked great! But got worn out very easily. I loved the way my nails looked, but i dont like the quality.</li>
    <li> Basic buffer does the trick but like the rest it starts to disintegrate over time, especially when you get it wet. Cheap so I just buy a ton.</li>
    <li> it very nice works good don&#x27;t have nothing to really say about this it works well only use it once.</li>
    <li> Awesome price for buffing cubes, but, they are not for buffing. All four sides have grit on them. So, if you are looking for a cheap \\&quot;buffing cube\\&quot; for a shine, don&#x27;t buy these.</li>
    <li> It works but don&#x27;t last after three or four uses. Don&#x27;t know if I will order it again, price is great.</li>
    <li> I mean its just a nail buffer not much to it lol but it serves it purpose and its cheaper on here than at beauty supply stores</li>
    <li> Great product, does seem to give off a dustiness when filing not sure what that is but its works well.</li>
    <li> I just received this item and I&#x27;m not sure if the seller changed suppliers, but it only has grit on 3 sides, not four.  Can&#x27;t comment on whether it will fall apart yet as I just started using it, but thought others might be interested to know, since I thought it had grit on all 4 sides.</li>
    <li> I bought this because I thought I could sand off some burrs on my circular knitting cords but I guess it really needs to be used only on finger nails. It isn&#x27;t much help on anything else.</li>
    <li> tihs is a must have item,and at a great price! i am orderinf more of these now, iuse them ALL the time!</li>
    <li> I love these buffers, they work great!</li>
    <li> Long to ship but works good.</li>
    <li> Cut these buffers in half for nail shows....fast shipping.</li>
    <li> not a good nail buffer at all... They even tried sending me a replacement one but it wasn&#x27;t any better not worth it at all</li>
    <li> I was really disappointed because the item was junk. It was the same grade on all four sides. Bought a different brand and it works awesome.</li>
    <li> This works just as well as any other one. But the price was good. Nothing special about this but nothing bad either</li>
    <li> In not-so-proper terminology, this 4 way nail buffer is just meh. It&#x27;s hard to distinguish the difference in each side. There are supposed to be four different levels of abrasiveness, but they&#x27;re all too similar. If you are just looking for something cheap and simple, this product is great. But if you&#x27;re looking to get a GREAT at-home mani/pedi, this is not the product for you.</li>
    <li> Works well, maintains its shape.  Using for personal home care.  Three sides of different texture.  The smoothest side is gentle enough for my 8 month old&#x27;s nails.</li>
