      <li>I&#x27;ve used this product for more than 10 years and could not do without it.  </li>
      <li>I guess you could say that I am sort of a &#x27;lotion junky&#x27; because I have so many.  </li>
      <li>I love that it is unscented, which means I can use it from head to toe and not smell myself all day.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>I have some that I love the fragrance and some that I just thought were better for some reason.  </li>

      <li>lotion.&lt;br /&gt;girldiver:)</li>
      <li>its the best for Dry skin its so moisturizing to the skin and not sticky feeling.</li>
      <li>I found that those usually rough areas are smoothed and put in perfect condition after using the cetaphil lotion consistantly for about a week.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Great Vender will buy more in the future from them ...</li>
      <li>Love it very much!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not too greasy (like some creams and oils) or too light (like some gels).</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve noticed a significant improvement in my texture and the appearance of fine lines.</li>
      <li>For a while now I thought Olay Quench was the best, but I finally opened my Cetaphil yesterday and all I can say is WOW!!  </li>
      <li>If benzoyl peroxide is too strong for you, you can mix it with Cetaphil to make it more gentle.</li>
      <li>It is light and softens the skin in such a pleasant way, never leaves a greasy feeling, and has almost no fragrance.  </li>
      <li>This lotion and all the other Cetaphil products are great.</li>
      <li>and I saw a tremendous improvement in her skin.</li>
      <li>This is the very first time I have reviewed anything.</li>
      <li>It is not greasy and is absorbed in to the skin quickly.  </li>
      <li>I do not recommend this product for it&#x27;s price though, you can find something just as good for way less.</li>
      <li>I like how soft my skin feels after showing and is so easy to apply with no residue and keeps my skin moisturized.</li>
      <li>At first, the Cetaphil lotion was too greasy, but over time, my skin improved and had a dewy effect.</li>
      <li>I will now be using this from now on as my first pick.  </li>
      <li>and I am washing my hands the whole day!, washing bottles etc..</li>
      <li>If it&#x27;s too hot and humid, I dilute with some water.</li>
      <li>As a scuba diver I am in and out of the water, fresh and salt, and that can be very drying to the skin.</li>
      <li>There&#x27;s no obnoxious smell of strong fragrances (has a slightly clinical smell to it at first, but goes away quickly).</li>
      <li>I only wish this lotion had spf in it, like my previous brand, but that wont stop me from using it it is so great.</li>
      <li>but it mosturizes really well and doesn&#x27;t cause any breakouts.</li>
      <li>and it&#x27;s absolute perfection.</li>
      <li>thanks</li>
      <li>really don&#x27;t use anything but the cetaphil</li>
      <li>This lotion is the answer to my poor abused red and irritated hands!!It works great on her too!!!</li>
      <li>It feels greasy when you first put it on, but leaves your skin very soft.  </li>
      <li>Other lotions feel watery, and leave you needing to add more.</li>
      <li>Highly recommend.</li>
      <li>originally discovered it from a recommendation by one of my girlfriends for my dry skin.</li>
      <li>As a matter of fact, it was the first thing that really made my skin feel \\&quot;normal\\&quot; in my entire life!    </li>
      <li>My skin is soft, not greasy, dewy, plump and zitless.</li>
      <li>I have a 4 week old baby girl</li>
      <li>My skin feels so soft that I keep wanting to feel my legs, arms, etc.  </li>
      <li>Well, maybe I should say felt this soft and STAYED this soft.  </li>
      <li>I love that it goes on fairly thick.</li>
      <li>moisturizer is terrific for sensitive skin!</li>
      <li>If you have chronic overly dry skin on legs, arms, or trunk, I HIGHLY recommend that you buy this lotion.</li>
      <li>I have combination skin (dry everywhere but oily back) and this really balances out your skin well.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t think my skin has felt this soft in a long time.  </li>
      <li>My skin is very sensitive and very dry</li>
      <li>Sensitive skin + dry climate &#x3D; havoc on the skin.</li>
      <li>the only reason I can see for such a result is that these patrons were not dry skinned.     </li>
      <li>My pediatrician recommended this moisturizer for my infant daughter as she has very dry, sensitive skin.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> My skin is very sensitive and very dry so i have to be very careful about what products i use. This lotion is definately a godsend. Since it doesn&#x27;t have a sunscreen i only use it at night but it mosturizes really well and doesn&#x27;t cause any breakouts. However, I think if you have oily or combination skin this may not work for you.</li>
    <li> I first tried this lotion when staying with my aunt, she had horrible acne and used this as a face moisturizer.  It feels greasy when you first put it on, but leaves your skin very soft.  I do not use it on my own face, but works great on my legs and hands.  I do not recommend this product for it&#x27;s price though, you can find something just as good for way less.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this lotion on my shelf for months and kept using my &#x27;fancier&#x27;, good smelling stuff.  I guess you could say that I am sort of a &#x27;lotion junky&#x27; because I have so many.  I even have some in a storage room because I don&#x27;t have enough room on my closet shelves for all of them.  I have some that I love the fragrance and some that I just thought were better for some reason.  I don&#x27;t know why because I hadn&#x27;t even opened my Cetaphil lotion yet.  Maybe because it&#x27;s in such a plain bottle.  But, as they say, \\&quot;don&#x27;t judge a book by it&#x27;s cover\\&quot;.  I now know this applies to my Cetaphil lotion.  For a while now I thought Olay Quench was the best, but I finally opened my Cetaphil yesterday and all I can say is WOW!!  I don&#x27;t think my skin has felt this soft in a long time.  Well, maybe I should say felt this soft and STAYED this soft.  This stuff doesn&#x27;t wear off or evaporate like some others that have to be reapplied a few hours later.  My skin feels so soft that I keep wanting to feel my legs, arms, etc.  I will now be using this from now on as my first pick.  Who knew?</li>
    <li> I have extremely bad eczema and very sensitive skin. I use the moisturizing lotion on my face for my daily moisturizer before I put on my makeup and it&#x27;s absolute perfection. It treats my extremely dry skin even through the harsh Maine winters without become too heavy that it clogs my pores. I think it&#x27;s also lightweight in the summer.  A little goes a long way with this product and I probably will never use anything else because A) it&#x27;s non-comedogenic (always look out for those pore cloggers) B) I never have an allergic reaction to it because it&#x27;s fragrance free.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This along with the Moisturizing Cream for the rest of me and my eczema and I am set for life.</li>
    <li> I have been using this lotion for 10 years. I wouldn&#x27;t use anything else unless I had no choice. This stuff is the best.&lt;br /&gt;I originally discovered it from a recommendation by one of my girlfriends for my dry skin. As a scuba diver I am in and out of the water, fresh and salt, and that can be very drying to the skin. The cetaphil lotion helped minimize the drying effect I had experienced.&lt;br /&gt;This lotion is a perfect consistancy for coverage. It is not greasy and is absorbed in to the skin quickly.  I found that those usually rough areas are smoothed and put in perfect condition after using the cetaphil lotion consistantly for about a week.&lt;br /&gt;I really don&#x27;t use anything but the cetaphil lotion.&lt;br /&gt;girldiver:)</li>
    <li> I have a 4 week old baby girl and I am washing my hands the whole day!, washing bottles etc.. This lotion is the answer to my poor abused red and irritated hands!!It works great on her too!!!</li>
    <li> This is the very first time I have reviewed anything. This lotion and all the other Cetaphil products are great. I have known about the skin cleanser for years, but used other moisturizers. My daughters derm reccommended cetaphil face moisturizer with spf so I used it too. A few weeks ago I bought the whole line and I love it all, it is very different than others. It lasts and really does soften and moisturize, it is a very good product. I only wish this lotion had spf in it, like my previous brand, but that wont stop me from using it it is so great. Maybe its the Macademia nut oil?  -Love it!</li>
    <li> My pediatrician recommended this moisturizer for my infant daughter as she has very dry, sensitive skin. I had only used it for 2 days and I saw a tremendous improvement in her skin. Her skin is now soft like a baby&#x27;s skin should be and it also took care of the redness that she had due to sensitivity to other moisturizers. This price is also the best one I&#x27;ve seen for the 16 ounce size.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This moisturizer is terrific for sensitive skin!</li>
    <li> I have been using this lotion on my legs for about 7 years.  It&#x27;s goes on thick and keeps my skin moisturized all day.  I have yet to find another lotion that does NOT need to be reapplied during the day.</li>
    <li> Sensitive skin + dry climate &#x3D; havoc on the skin. My doctor prescribed me a regimen that included a brand with minimal ingredients. At first, the Cetaphil lotion was too greasy, but over time, my skin improved and had a dewy effect. If benzoyl peroxide is too strong for you, you can mix it with Cetaphil to make it more gentle.</li>
    <li> This lotion is just awesome. It is gentle enough to use everyday without my face breaking out.</li>
    <li> The best lotion you can buy and very good for you skin and won&#x27;t break you out! Love it very much!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for more than 10 years and could not do without it.  It is light and softens the skin in such a pleasant way, never leaves a greasy feeling, and has almost no fragrance.  This bottle lasts years and years since you don&#x27;t need but a drop to cover your face, neck and chest.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I like this product because I have used it all my life. I like how soft my skin feels after showing and is so easy to apply with no residue and keeps my skin moisturized.</li>
    <li> I love that it&#x27;s not greasy. I love that it goes on fairly thick. Other lotions feel watery, and leave you needing to add more. I love that it is unscented, which means I can use it from head to toe and not smell myself all day.&lt;br /&gt;I have eczema and it keeps me moisturized all day, no need to reapply unless after I wash my hands.</li>
    <li> This lotion was recommended to me by my dermatologist. I had very dry skin with patches here &amp; there of excema. I&#x27;ve read the reviews that say it&#x27;s greasy... the only reason I can see for such a result is that these patrons were not dry skinned.     If you have extremely dry skin that gets flaky and other lotions disappear within hours, this one was made for you. Your skin will stay supple until the next day or longer. It will not feel greasy at all. As a matter of fact, it was the first thing that really made my skin feel \\&quot;normal\\&quot; in my entire life!    It&#x27;s made to help your skin even retain moisture which you can actually feel. It&#x27;s so refreshing! I have never used this on my face. This is not a beauty cream. This company does make facial creams and cleansers, however, this one is for the body. If you have extra dry skin on your face I guess you could but this is body lotion.     If you have chronic overly dry skin on legs, arms, or trunk, I HIGHLY recommend that you buy this lotion.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t believe that I have missed this great lotion all these years!  This is a light, oil-free wonderful lotion.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy layer.  Recommended by my dermatologist.</li>
    <li> The lotion is great to use as face lotion. It gets my face a little bit greasy but not too much and a lot less than other lotions that I have used. I would definitely recommend this lotion to others.</li>
    <li> I gave this a 5star for service , product, prices and speedy delivery. I truly love Cetaphil Moisturizing Lotion its the best for Dry skin its so moisturizing to the skin and not sticky feeling. I cant be without it ... Great Vender will buy more in the future from them ... thanks</li>
    <li> This is literally the best lotion I&#x27;ve ever tried! The consistency is perfect, it goes on well. It&#x27;s not too greasy (like some creams and oils) or too light (like some gels). Works great in all seasons. I&#x27;ve noticed a significant improvement in my texture and the appearance of fine lines. There&#x27;s no obnoxious smell of strong fragrances (has a slightly clinical smell to it at first, but goes away quickly). If it&#x27;s too hot and humid, I dilute with some water. Very easy to add things into the lotion as well. I have combination skin (dry everywhere but oily back) and this really balances out your skin well. Was using Aveeno for a while, but it&#x27;s too heavy for the summer months.</li>
    <li> I have tried everything and beside Olay for face, this is the very best. I use it on my body and face, along with the Olay, and the results are wonderful. My skin is soft, not greasy, dewy, plump and zitless. This lotion might be a little heavier than some but my skin likes it. If u have dry or allergy-prone skin, this is for you. I tried a cheaper lotion a few weeks ago and ran back to this. Cetaphil makes several varations, so any skin need can be met. Excellent for ppl like me who hate fragrances! So great.</li>
