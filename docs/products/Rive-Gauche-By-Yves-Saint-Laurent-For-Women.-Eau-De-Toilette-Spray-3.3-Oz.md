      <li>This is a favorite item of mine.  </li>
      <li>Always good to be able to find my favorite cologne at such a good price.  </li>
      <li>The smell of this cologne is light and sophisticated.</li>
      <li>I purchased the original so many times from the department stores.</li>
      <li>Is it so good to see these older scents available.  </li>
      <li>I first tried YSL Rive Gauche many years ago and fell in love with it.</li>
      <li>It is an absolutely fabulous smelling perfume.</li>
      <li>I have been buying this perfume for years, but regret that the body lotion is no longer available.</li>
      <li>Sure, they want to popularize the new scents, however, this is the one that made YSL famous to begin with.</li>
      <li>t the original.</li>
      <li>, it is not and is the original version.</li>
      <li>Warning: it seems like somewhere along the line, YSL messed with the original formula</li>
      <li>but i dont know if its original or not since i never bought it before</li>
      <li>This product is NOT by the original maker; and it doesn&#x27;t smell like it either.  </li>
      <li>Its unique fragrance haunted me</li>
      <li>The bottle wasn&#x27;t full filled.</li>
      <li>This rich, mellow scent has been one of my favorites for over 35 years.  </li>

      <li>Comes in a nice Rive Gauche blue box just like the description says it does and the bottle sprays fine.</li>
      <li>I usually prefer something stronger in a parfume or perfume spray, but this is very good for the money.</li>

      <li>Delivery was in a timely manner, well packaged and new as advertised and authentic Rive Gauche.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> It&#x27;s perfume, what could be wrong.  Everything seems right. It was purchased as a gift and we received no complaints.</li>
    <li> where is this bottle of Rive Gauche made?  if China, or Asia, you know it&#x27;s a bootleg.  will Amazon tell us, where it&#x27;s made?  don&#x27;t hold your breath.</li>
    <li> I just got my brand new delivery today of Rive Gauche and boy am I happy! It is every bit the same as I remember it to be, everything is the same the box is made in France the same soft sensuous scent with the note of licorice at the end as we all remember it to be. I dont quite understand why some are calling this a fake, it is not and is the original version. I have been wearing this scent for many many years,I know where it is made and I know what it is supposed to smell like, there is none other like it so yes I am very happy with this product and it came quickly as well. Thank you!</li>
    <li> Delivery was in a timely manner, well packaged and new as advertised and authentic Rive Gauche.I will try to order from this company again</li>
    <li> My wife has been using this aroma for over 40 years and even if she had a thought of changing (which she won&#x27;t), her daughters would not allow it. When they smell it, they immediately say, there is mom!    Ernie Sartor</li>
    <li> So happy to find my favorite scent. It may an older scent but it is timelesss.</li>
    <li> I consider this perfuume timeless because you can use it over over again and never tired of the scent it exudes.  A good buy for the price I paid for.</li>
    <li> The product is pure Rive Gauche,  I can tell as I get an allergic reaction to the knock offs.  It is the best parfume in the whole world.  I love this seller.  Affordable, great product and quick delivery</li>
    <li> I was introduced to this perfume about 30yrs ago, and began purchasing it from a local department store.  Unfortunately within a few years they discontinued selling this product and I couldnt find it anywhere.  Now thanks to Amazon (and others like it) i can purchase it online.  It is an absolutely fabulous smelling perfume. Love it, love it, love it.</li>
    <li> The product was delivered in a record time, it was delivered &lt;br /&gt;within 3 days. Wow!!!! amazing.</li>
    <li> I still purchase this product despite the change in its formula by Tom Ford who messed it up when he headed Yves St. Laurent&#x27;s empire.  Why he did it, I&#x27;ll never know, with the possible exception of saving money on its production.  It was a unique and wonderful scent and everyone who knows me associated it with me.  I just haven&#x27;t found anything else similar.</li>
    <li> I liked the perfume but i dont know if its original or not since i never bought it before but it seemed pretty light weighted and less for a 100 ml :/ but its nice!</li>
    <li> This product arrived 3 days later than it was supposed to, I cannot comment on the product itself because it was a gift to someone.</li>
    <li> Because that is what wify likes</li>
    <li> I can always find my favorite here.  It is great</li>
    <li> Thankful you carry this product!!! You made finding and ordering my favourite EDT a breeze!!!</li>
    <li> My wife&#x27;s favorite and hard to find elsewhere.</li>
    <li> I buy this perfume yearly for my mom for christmas. She loves it, it is her favorite scent. No problems with the product. Comes in a nice Rive Gauche blue box just like the description says it does and the bottle sprays fine. Good buy.</li>
    <li> I love this fragrance.  I&#x27;ve used it on and off for years and I&#x27;m glad that, unlike other favorites, this hasn&#x27;t been discontinued.</li>
    <li> Expectations completely met.</li>
    <li> Wonderful classic scent. One of the scents my grandmother wore,however it smells and makes me feel like a real woman. I love this perume!!!</li>
    <li> I first tried YSL Rive Gauche many years ago and fell in love with it. Its unique fragrance haunted me and I used it for years. Then I somehow steered away from it until recently. I read the professional reviews and was aware of its 2003 reformulation under creatve direction by Tom Ford. I was also aware, from the reviews, that the Rive Gauche Intense stayed truer to the original formulation. I bought Rive Gauche Intense and was not dissapointed. When the bottle ran out, I decided to try Rive Gauche next. I cannot tell you how dissapointed I was. There was a barely visible ghost of the original fragrance, a mediocrity, not a trace of its bold originality and character that drew me to it many years ago. It is a shame! My recommendation is to stay away from this disgraceful reformulation and try Rive Gauche Intense instead.</li>
    <li> An old perfume by Yves Saint Lauren.  One that I used to use many years ago when I was young.</li>
    <li> This was a gift for my mother. It certainly is a more mature scent that is not readily available in stores.</li>
    <li> My mom and I really like this fragrance but we can&#x27;t find it in stores anymore. I was so happy to find it on Amazon so we buy a year&#x27;s supply for the two of us and the free shipping is great!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my wife and she loves it.  She says she faintly remembers this fragrance from when she was a little girl in the 70&#x27;s, and is very glad to have it.</li>
    <li> I fell in love with YSL fashion early on.  When l discovered the Rive Gauche fragrance, I stopped wearing my mother&#x27;s scents. It&#x27;s fresh and lively scent inspired my sense of independence and creativity.</li>
    <li> I have been buying this perfume for years, but regret that the body lotion is no longer available.</li>
    <li> This is my wife&#x27;s favorite and I never go wrong getting this for her. She loves this perfume so if it makes her happy then I&#x27;m happy.</li>
    <li> Have been using this product for 20+ years.  Love that it last all day, but I dont smell it.  It has become my signature.  I recently met up with a firend I had not seen in many years.  She hugged me and said \\&quot;I would know it was you even if I was blind, I have never smelled that scent but on you\\&quot;.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product since early 70&#x27;s and can be recognized by it when I pass by someone that knows me!I have received many many compliments, so why should I change?</li>
    <li> This product is NOT by the original maker; and it doesn&#x27;t smell like it either.  I threw this product away and purchased the original for nearly $100...and it was worth EVERY penny...</li>
    <li> I have used this fragrance for 40+ years and since its no longer sold in stores, I buy it online, which I am very thankful for. This is the one fragrance that both men and women have complimented me on. I know perfumes react to our chemistry but this one is so clean and crisp, not too floral. I Love It! dnk</li>
    <li> Item came in a timely manner with the exception of the holiday rush, which was a given.  Will do business again in the future.  Thank you as this was a present for my grandmother who was looking for this product for quite some time.</li>
    <li> I have loved this perfume since I was 19..&lt;br /&gt;it has a light and fresh and classy fragrance and is&lt;br /&gt;perfect for ANY occasion! I have received MANY compliments on the fragrance!</li>
    <li> This is a favorite item of mine.  Long lasting, smells great without being over powering in the scent.</li>
    <li> I just received my order today and I also have my doubts; the bottle is different ( still have an okd one here ) and when you spray it you smell nothing at first. inside the box is a warning in Dutch which the old box does not have. I don&#x27;t believe it is the real thing or YSL has gone to cheaper packaging?</li>
    <li> I have missed having this on hand and finally found it on Amazon.  It&#x27;s my summer favorite.  I feel special when I wear it.</li>
    <li> I have used this product over the years.  Had difficulty finding it in department stores, so decided to look for it on the internet. BRAVO I am happy with it.</li>
    <li> My wife has been using it for years and we both love it, but sometimes it is hard to find.</li>
    <li> Is it so good to see these older scents available.  This is pretty long-lasting for a toilette spray.  I usually prefer something stronger in a parfume or perfume spray, but this is very good for the money.</li>
    <li> the perfume has very little odor - it is not strong at all - seems like it has been watered down.</li>
    <li> I really love perfumes</li>
    <li> Will be ordering more!</li>
    <li> Have purchased this several times in the past.  Excellent produce, service and price.</li>
    <li> Great toilette spray,great service-they are customer oriented and they tray to please you. I love it.Ordered a new one.Thank you Victor</li>
    <li> It came with the box unsealed. I willl return it. Also, it was 25% used. The bottle wasn&#x27;t full filled.</li>
    <li> Cpild not find this favorite for years.  Love it.</li>
    <li> My wife loves this stuff, and its hard to get. Go Amazon!</li>
    <li> My wife&#x27;s favorite!!!</li>
    <li> Smells old, need to return</li>
    <li> I ordered this parfume spray as a gift and it wasn,t the original. I purchased the original so many times from the department stores. Even the box was fake. Iam very dissappointed. Thanks...</li>
    <li> I have been wearing Rive Gauche exclusively and daily since 1974.  This product is a bootleg. Not only is it not what it purports to be, it smells like lawn chemicals.  To their credit, Amazon gave me a prompt refund but I would have been even happier if they had removed the product from their site.</li>
    <li> I bought this as a Christmas present for my wife. She likes this spray for use in the summer. Bottle arrived in a timely fashion with no problems.</li>
    <li> This is what I use all the time.</li>
    <li> This is my mother-in-law&#x27;s signature scent but you can&#x27;t find it anywhere in stores.  I have ordered it a few times from Amazon now and have always been extremely happy.  The scent is exactly as you remember it and the price at Amazon is the best I found anywhere.</li>
    <li> This fragrace does not live up to the original purchase in Paris.  It has hardly any scent!  I will not purchase this again from you.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite scent and am so happy that I can find it year round online.  Only a few stores carry it anymore and it is usually only during the holidays.</li>
    <li> This is my wife&#x27;s favorite perfume. She loves the scent. As soon as she opened the box she applied the spray.  thank you</li>
    <li> LOVE this perfume! can not find it in any store, and when it was in a store it cost more... I&#x27;m happy with my purchase of this perfume!</li>
    <li> This is my favorite perfume since my son gave it to me when he was 8 years old, now he is 37. Should I say anything more????</li>
    <li> Warning: it seems like somewhere along the line, YSL messed with the original formula and now you get the same fragrance that we all love and remember except that it disappears five minutes after you put it on.  Still they want you to pay as if you were getting the real thing. Tragic to say the least! Keep away.</li>
    <li> I have been used long time ago. I&#x27;m still in love. I love it, Thank you. If you have some more. please let me know. Thank you,</li>
    <li> I simply love this product!  The best part was how quickly this item arrived in the mail.  Love this scent.</li>
    <li> I purchased the Yves Saint Laurent for Women, Eau De Toilette Spray 3.3 Oz. on November 5, 2012 as a christmas gift for my wife. The Amazon Marketplace seller was Sakiv Inc. Plainsboro, NJ.&lt;br /&gt;My order left Sakiv left their facility on November 6 and arrived in Warrendale, PA - that is just north of Pittsburgh, PA - I live just south of Pittsburgh, PA.&lt;br /&gt;Because of a very dirty address label it did not make the 20 miles south to me but made a 6 day roundtrip to Saint Paul, MN!&lt;br /&gt;I received the package on November 15 and gift wrapped it.&lt;br /&gt;Then a couple of weeks after Christmas my wife took the spray out of the cardboard box the spray can was in and discovered a large dent in the can.&lt;br /&gt;I then contacted Sakiv through Amazon website - they have never responded to me - not even a denial of responsibility!&lt;br /&gt;So if you are dealing with Sakiv Inc. you are taking chances!</li>
    <li> Great Buy &amp; Worth The Purchase. Its Been Soooo Hard To Find This In Stock In.stores.  Its My Moms Favorite Perfume, But Because Its Hard To Find, She Stopped Wearing It Until I Found &amp; Bought It For Her For Valentines Day.  She Loved It! Smells Just As Good As I Remember.  :)</li>
    <li> I love rive Gauche. The smell of this cologne is light and sophisticated. And it does knock people out when you walk in the room. I would like to get the body lotion and body powder.</li>
    <li> Arrived before Christmas which was awesome.  Product was what it said it was.</li>
    <li> Always good to be able to find my favorite cologne at such a good price.  Used to have to search for this cologne,</li>
    <li> this is my treat to me my birthday xmass mothers day .its better then a payday. will be ordering more a.s.a.p.</li>
    <li> the problem i had is that it doesnt come directly to brasil. i had to send to a friend in usa first.</li>
    <li> My mom loves Rive Gauche but it has been discontinued from stores in our area for a long time. No where to be found. I was very grateful that Amazon carried it and shipped it to us. It was a big nice surprise for my mom to get it as a Christmas gift.</li>
    <li> This is such a lovely, timeless scent unlike some of the other older fragrances which smell outdated. I did not realize how much I missed this scent until I began wearing it again.  I had not worn this since I was a teen going to dances in the early 1980&#x27;s.  In recent years, I have tried many different fragrances and always found something annoying about most of them.  I can wear Rive Gauche all day, everyday and never get annoyed or tired of the fragrance. I read other reviews saying the scent has been changed,but to me is smells just like how I remember it.  I LOVE IT!</li>
    <li> Fast delivery. Item exactly as expected</li>
    <li> YSL truly knows women. This is his signature scent for decades and every single time I wear it, I receive compliment galore. For some reason, his flagship store on 57th Street in Manhattan has stopped stocking this particular item. Sure, they want to popularize the new scents, however, this is the one that made YSL famous to begin with.</li>
    <li> This rich, mellow scent has been one of my favorites for over 35 years.  It&#x27;s such an earthy fragrance, absolutely delicious.  I would highly recommend this to anyone who enjoys wearing a classic.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this 1n the 70&#x27;s I loved it then and I still love it today. I thank Amazon for making it possible for me to find it. The sent is crisp and fresh on me.</li>
    <li> Ok, this was an international shippment so it took a little time to get here. I was scared after reading a lot of reviews about the change of formula, and the alcohol smell, and the fakeness. But oh, what a relieve when I asked my client to open it from its perfect package and smell it, and her face told me everything, she even sprayed on me (a little too young for that smell), then when we spoke again, she told me how happy she was with her perFume she once thought extinguished. Really satisfied.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve worn Rive Gauche, more than any other fragrance.  It hasn&#x27;t always been easily found, but the experience with Amazon was positive and I appreciated finding it online.  I began using Rive Gauche in 1975 when my, then young, sweetheart gave it to me as a gift of peace,  after some silly squabble.  We still squabble and I still wear Rive Gauche, much to his delight!!</li>
    <li> these products are wonderful</li>
    <li> Somthing I can&#x27;t find easy anymore, so I was thrilled to find it.&lt;br /&gt; It&#x27;s smell is sweet and I just love it.</li>
    <li> Provided as a gift to my wife, who used all of her previous supply.  It was a hit because she loves the fragrance.  Because Rive Gauche has been around a long time (25+ years), it is somes hard to find, but it was easy on Amazon.com.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very satisfied.</li>
    <li> MY SISTER HAS BEEN LOVING AND WEARING RIVE GAUCHE FOR YEARS.&lt;br /&gt;WE WERE THRILLED TO FIND IT ONLINE, WE COULDN&#x27;T FIND IT IN A STORE ANYWHERE.</li>
    <li> Good scent but a bit too sweet.</li>
    <li> I got this product called other stores and this was the cheapest and she loved it , very good not sure if it is real or cheap version, i do not know how to tell</li>
    <li> This was a gift for my wife that loved Rive Gauche.  No longer available in stores and the only place we found it was the Grand Caymans islands in the duty free shops.  Found out you don&#x27;t have to take a cruise and go to the islands to get your favorite perfume for your loved one.  Found it on Amazon for less than the islands.</li>
    <li> Love the smell of this, reminds me of my college days!!</li>
    <li> Bought it for a lovely and wonderful lady.</li>
    <li> all very well and fast, and all this and that is described in the publication recommended for future purchases recommended 100%</li>
