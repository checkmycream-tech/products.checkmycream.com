### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>The brush I received, though good, was not what I was looking for.</li>
      <li>You find a good one then never find it on the store shelf again.  </li>
      <li>Good quality from a good company.  </li>
      <li>G.U.M brushes are curved side-to-side which, according to my Orthodontist, is better for the gum.&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t vibrate, does not floss for you and does not pat on your shoulder, but it does a great job cleaning teeth and preventing dental plaque.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended</li>
      <li>I plan to buy a bunch more and stock up!</li>
      <li>I am 77 and still have my own teeth with the exception of two that broke.</li>
      <li>G-U-M toothbrushes are the best soft brushes.</li>
      <li>and I simply love them and won&#x27;t use anything else.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m going to do a search to try to find something better.  </li>
      <li>This is an excellent toothbrush that, unfortunately is not sold in many major retail stores but is well worth seeking out and purchasing online.  </li>
      <li>On top of that it is very reasonably priced!</li>
      <li>Great for getting bristles just under the gum line for a total mouth cleaning.</li>
      <li>Feels really good on the teeth and gums too, which many other models that advertise about being superior for that are not able to do.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s comfortable in the hand and the soft bristles really clean well right up to and under the gum line.</li>
      <li>, I guess that means I have not been using g the right toothbrushes.</li>
      <li>these don&#x27;t fit into older models of toothbrush holders.</li>
      <li>If you are looking for an &amp;#34;old fashioned&amp;#34; simple toothbrush that does a great job then search no further.  </li>
      <li>These brushes weren&#x27;t exactly what I was looking for.  </li>
      <li>He more recently recommends NeutraMaxx 5000 Plus toothpaste for which Amazon has no listing.  </li>
      <li>Does a great job of getting along the gum line, and the longer tip does great at reaching back behind the last molars.  </li>
      <li>They aren&#x27;t quite as soft as I expected, but are still good.</li>
      <li>The first brush--and I use &amp;#34;soft&amp;#34;-- was great, but the second brush was way too stiff.  </li>
      <li>My dentist puts these great brushes in my little sample bag after check-ups, and I thought these might be the same brushes, but they aren&#x27;t.  </li>
      <li>My dentist got me hooked on these toothbrushes several years ago then changed vendors and no longer carried these free with every cleaning visit.  </li>
      <li>Works OK, like any other.  </li>
      <li>So I was expecting the old version of the Butler product with full adult brush</li>
      <li>I used to find them at Walgreen&#x27;s but not lately.</li>
      <li>The head is also small and more compact than what I am used to.</li>
      <li>I want soft, but not so soft that the bristles flatten out when you touch them to your teeth.</li>
      <li>Just not as soft as I need.</li>
      <li>I am now in a bind trying to find a soft brush that still brushes the teeth and gums.</li>
      <li>It mentioned the Butler name and showed the old style packaging.  </li>
      <li>I need a soft tootbrush.  </li>
      <li>Did not expect it to be so soft</li>
      <li>This is an excelent soft toothbrush.</li>
      <li>The ones I received are much softer than those I always got from the dentist or bought locally in Walgreen&#x27;s.</li>
      <li>It wasn&#x27;t soft.</li>
      <li>Holds up very well compared to other brands I have tried.  </li>
      <li>The heads are just the right size for my mouth, not too big and not too small.    </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> It wasn&#x27;t soft. I am used to a softer bristle. The head is also small and more compact than what I am used to.</li>
    <li> This is an excellent toothbrush that, unfortunately is not sold in many major retail stores but is well worth seeking out and purchasing online.  It&#x27;s comfortable in the hand and the soft bristles really clean well right up to and under the gum line.</li>
    <li> This is a softer brush recommended by my periodontist, to use along with [[ASIN:B0055QA7U2 G-U-M Soft-Picks 80 picks]], dental floss, and a fluoride toothpaste.  He more recently recommends NeutraMaxx 5000 Plus toothpaste for which Amazon has no listing.  The combination works well.  I am 77 and still have my own teeth with the exception of two that broke.</li>
    <li> Mi odontologo me recomendo este cepillo y estoy muy contenta de usarlo pues me ha dado muy buen resultado. No mas placa bacteriana</li>
    <li> My dentist got me hooked on these toothbrushes several years ago then changed vendors and no longer carried these free with every cleaning visit.  I had a very difficult time finding them locally and finally found this source.  Even calculating the shipping, these are cheaper than running all over town to find them at local drug stores.</li>
    <li> Because I can&#x27;t find these locally, I ordered online.  The first brush--and I use &amp;#34;soft&amp;#34;-- was great, but the second brush was way too stiff.  I&#x27;m going to do a search to try to find something better.  There&#x27;s nothing wrong with these however.  You can use them.  Just not as soft as I need.</li>
    <li> Not scrape-the-enamel-off hard and not gigantic.  And doesn&#x27;t have those dumb different sized bristly and fancy stuff.  I plan to buy a bunch more and stock up!</li>
    <li> Buying a toothbrush can be a shot in the dark.  I need a soft tootbrush.  It is impossible to tell if what you are getting is right when you purchase.  You find a good one then never find it on the store shelf again.  This is an excelent soft toothbrush.</li>
    <li> Good quality from a good company.  Did not expect it to be so soft, I guess that means I have not been using g the right toothbrushes. I&#x27;m going to be using this brand of toothbrush from now on.</li>
    <li> Great for getting bristles just under the gum line for a total mouth cleaning.</li>
    <li> G-U-M toothbrushes are the best soft brushes. I don&#x27;t understand why they are not available in stores. I used to find them at Walgreen&#x27;s but not lately. The heads are just the right size for my mouth, not too big and not too small.    1/6/15 Update on my G-U-M brushes. The ones I received are much softer than those I always got from the dentist or bought locally in Walgreen&#x27;s. I want soft, but not so soft that the bristles flatten out when you touch them to your teeth. I brush the way I always have but this batch is definitely too flexible. I hope this was a flawed batch. I am now in a bind trying to find a soft brush that still brushes the teeth and gums.</li>
    <li> G.U.M brushes are curved side-to-side which, according to my Orthodontist, is better for the gum.&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t vibrate, does not floss for you and does not pat on your shoulder, but it does a great job cleaning teeth and preventing dental plaque.&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended</li>
    <li> These brushes weren&#x27;t exactly what I was looking for.  My dentist puts these great brushes in my little sample bag after check-ups, and I thought these might be the same brushes, but they aren&#x27;t.  They aren&#x27;t quite as soft as I expected, but are still good.</li>
    <li> If you are looking for an &amp;#34;old fashioned&amp;#34; simple toothbrush that does a great job then search no further.  My dentist recommended GUM to me years ago and I simply love them and won&#x27;t use anything else.  Does a great job of getting along the gum line, and the longer tip does great at reaching back behind the last molars.  Holds up very well compared to other brands I have tried.  Feels really good on the teeth and gums too, which many other models that advertise about being superior for that are not able to do.  On top of that it is very reasonably priced!</li>
    <li> There was a particular Butler GUM brush I used in the past. I thought, from the description, that I ordered the same brush. The brush I received, though good, was not what I was looking for. I&#x27;ll keep looking.</li>
    <li> I like it it work for me</li>
    <li> Works OK, like any other.  Just wish they had not changed their handle&lt;br /&gt;as these don&#x27;t fit into older models of toothbrush holders.</li>
    <li> This product was not as pictured.  It mentioned the Butler name and showed the old style packaging.  So I was expecting the old version of the Butler product with full adult brush head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Actual product was Sunstar, and was not as pictured.  And the brush seems to have a very small and compact head.  Doesn&#x27;t work for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I ordered six brushes and used one, but transaction is now past 30 days, so I guess the seller is not going to even respond to the email I sent them.</li>
