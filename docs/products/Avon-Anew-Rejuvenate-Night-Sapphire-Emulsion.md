      <li>I have been iso a great moisturizer.</li>
      <li>Oh well, great results anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It is great to renew the skin.  </li>

      <li>I&#x27;m 24 &amp; have fairly sensitive/fair skin &amp;</li>

      <li>I would strongly recommend this product!</li>
      <li>and I notice my skin feels very smooth.</li>

      <li>Pass on this one ladies and just buy the regular night cream that is wonderful.</li>
      <li>I love everything about his except</li>
      <li>I use Avon Anew Rejuvenate Day &amp; Night Creams and love them both.  </li>
      <li>If you are home for the evening it might be best to put it on earlier versus</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried many products on my face...</li>
      <li>Love this stuff.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It is a shame that Avon discontinued it as they do for many of their more well-liked products.</li>
      <li>This product has been able to even out my skin tone, it has faded my acne scars, my face looks fresher in the morning...</li>
      <li>and I guess its okay for that</li>
      <li>It goes on great, decent smell, skin didnt tingle upon application, etc.</li>
      <li>but it sure keeps your face super hydrated!</li>
      <li>30 year old skin abd works great on it.</li>
      <li>The results so far have been great.  </li>
      <li>I continue to use it, though, because although I have oily skin, if I don&#x27;t moisturize it I seem to break out and my fine lines/</li>
      <li>These are HUGE improvements in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>the price was so cheap</li>
      <li>I am used to the Anew Rejuvenate Night Cream absorbing into my skin and making it feel really nice.  </li>
      <li>love this product and will purchase again very soon just to have more on hand before price increases.</li>
      <li>my skin looks fresh, smooth, glowing.</li>
      <li>The first thing I noticed was how smooth the texture of my skin was.</li>
      <li>The first day you notice that your skin feels hydrated and smooth.</li>
      <li>Higher priced serums don&#x27;t work as well as this one does!</li>
      <li>Not a problem right now</li>
      <li>/&gt;It doesn&#x27;t take very much at all to cover the face and neck.  </li>
      <li>Thanks AVON!</li>
      <li>okay overall</li>
      <li>But sure if this will work on deep wrinkles</li>
      <li>I first started using this product and since I notice that Avon Anew Rejuvenate Night Sapphire Emulsion made a difference in my skin</li>
      <li>Many clog my pores and make them look larger.  </li>
      <li>This is my first proper night moisturizer (as opposed to just putting on day moisturizer before bed) &amp; I love it.</li>
      <li>2 stars simply because I was able to use the remainder of the jar on my neck/chest without any catastrophic results (since I don&#x27;t get breakouts there).</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m very satisfy with Avon, and this is the first time I ever bought an Avon product.</li>
      <li>The first time i used it I was really apprehensive, because my skin is very prone to breakouts.</li>
      <li>Also,closed the large pores on my nose and cheeks.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;d been using Trilane squalane oil purchased through the Dr. Lark newsletter, but was hoping the Avon Anew Sapphire would have the added benefit of shrinking my large pores.  </li>
      <li>this stuff makes my skin very soft &amp; smooth &amp; clear.</li>
      <li>I was looking for a product that would not only smooth out those lines but reduce my pores.</li>
      <li>been using this for about a year now and really like it.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t like it that much because its so intensely greasy and oily feeling.</li>
      <li>This product hasn&#x27;t really done much for me.</li>
      <li>thanks</li>
      <li>It is very shiny when you put it on</li>
      <li>I also used the other emulsions avon produces, this one seems just right, not too &#x27;greasy&#x27; feeling yet absorbant and what doesn&#x27;t absorb in, easily blotted with tissue.  </li>
      <li>Burns my sensitive skin!!!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used this product previously and love it, you don&#x27;t need much!  </li>
      <li>It really sits on your skin and my face was still super moisturized the next morning.</li>
      <li>I wouldn&#x27;t use it every night as I have sensitive skin, but 2-3 times a week is more than enough for soft skin in the morning.</li>
      <li>I am in my early 20&#x27;s but was starting to see some fine lines on my forehead</li>
      <li>i have sensitive skin and no breakout!!its very concentrated use to much</li>
      <li>The skin that had started to sag on my jaw area looks a little more defined.  </li>
      <li>Too bad, I wanted to like it, especially as it&#x27;s my favorite color.</li>
      <li>I dont normally respond to any creams or products in this way, and am still trying to get rid of the redness and \\</li>
      <li>I saw the commercial for this product and ordered it right away.</li>
      <li>Only thing, don&#x27;t use right before bed, let it soak in before your head hits the  pillow.</li>
      <li>Glycolic acid sends to be the only ingredient I&#x27;ve found to actually visibly reduce fine lines.</li>
      <li>So if you don&#x27;t have sensitive skin - go for it!  </li>
      <li>OK, so I usually use the Anew Rejuvenate Night Cream, and decided I would try this.</li>
      <li>but I thought I&#x27;d give it a try since only certain oils don&#x27;t break me out.  </li>
      <li>Didn&#x27;t realize they were so large until weeks later.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not greasy and feels soft on the skin</li>
      <li>my skin is too sensitive for it.  </li>
      <li>and i dont have sensitive skin at all.</li>
      <li>being in my early 40s</li>
      <li>Leave my skin soft, supple and hydrated.</li>
      <li>I have been using this product for nearly a month now.</li>
      <li>Not only did this product work but my skin is clear and radiant.</li>
      <li>I am using retinol which can make your skin somewhat sensitive but even in the areas where i dont use the retinol it burned it and made my face so red.</li>
      <li>I had the biggest compliment from a stranger saying that she hated me because my skin was perfect.</li>
      <li>It worked very well on reducing the size of my pores, but it was difficult to figure out how much was enough, how much was too much, and how much was too little.  </li>
      <li>You must be extremely careful with this product because if you put too much on, your face will resemble an oil slick the next day regardless of how much or how well you wash in the morning.  </li>

<li> Given how long it takes residual zit marks to totally disappear, I don&#x27;t think I will continue using it.  </li>
<li> I now bought 3 other different facial Avon products to improve my facial skin.</li>
<li> /&gt;It has been less than a week and the large pores on my nose are definitely less noticeable.</li>
<li> The only negative, in my opinion, is because it feels like and goes on like silk, it is not absorbed readily into the skin.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product previously and love it, you don&#x27;t need much!  I also used the other emulsions avon produces, this one seems just right, not too &#x27;greasy&#x27; feeling yet absorbant and what doesn&#x27;t absorb in, easily blotted with tissue.  Like the Anew line, used higher priced &#x27;name brands&#x27; for twice to four times the money, you can&#x27;t go wrong with this one!</li>
    <li> I have a love/hate relationship with Avon/Anew products, but when I heard this product&#x27;s claims of an 80% improvement of pore size in only 5 days, I decided, what the hell? What have I got to lose?    Today was my sixth day of using this product as a nighttime moisturizer, and holy cow, what a difference! The first thing I noticed was how smooth the texture of my skin was. It was roughly the same as when I use [[ASIN:B0017U10SI Bare Escentuals Prime Time]], except unlike with a foundation primer, the smoothness didn&#x27;t wash away.     I would strongly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I really liked this product.  Just finished the jar and will be ordering again today.  It is great to renew the skin.  Also,closed the large pores on my nose and cheeks. Didn&#x27;t realize they were so large until weeks later.  Cleaned up sores on my nose.</li>
    <li> This is my first proper night moisturizer (as opposed to just putting on day moisturizer before bed) &amp; I love it. A little goes a long way since it&#x27;s thick/gel. I&#x27;m 24 &amp; have fairly sensitive/fair skin &amp; this stuff makes my skin very soft &amp; smooth &amp; clear. The price isn&#x27;t too terrible especially if you use it sparingly. (I&#x27;m supposing one jar should last me somewhere btwn 2-4 months.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell isn&#x27;t bad or that strong (in my opinion) which I think some people complained about. The only thing I would say is that it does make your face look shiny at night. Not a problem right now but I&#x27;m not sure what to do when my boyfriend is around.. shiny sticky face &#x3D; unattractive! Oh well, great results anyway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will definitely buy this again.</li>
    <li> I have bn using this product for 7 days now and the change is sooo visible. my skin looks fresh, smooth, glowing. its an amazin product.    thanks</li>
    <li> I bought this accidentally thinking I was purchasing the Avon Anew Rejuvenate Night Cream that I&#x27;d purchased previously. This stuff is sticky and gross and my cheeks were sticking to my pillow.  I don&#x27;t want to waste the jar so I am just using it on my forehead and corners of my eyes.  Pass on this one ladies and just buy the regular night cream that is wonderful.</li>
    <li> This product works very good, I been using this product for over a 3 weeks and I notice my skin feels very smooth. I tried other products and this Avon Rejuvenate is the only product that so far I have notice a difference in only 1 week. I first started using this product and since I notice that Avon Anew Rejuvenate Night Sapphire Emulsion made a difference in my skin I now bought 3 other different facial Avon products to improve my facial skin. I&#x27;m very satisfy with Avon, and this is the first time I ever bought an Avon product.</li>
    <li> This product hasn&#x27;t really done much for me. It makes my skin soft but other products have done the same. I don&#x27;t like it that much because its so intensely greasy and oily feeling. I wear it at night sometimes and I wake up with that greasy feeling still on my face. I wear it as a night moisturizer and I guess its okay for that but it&#x27;s just not something I&#x27;ll be buying again.</li>
    <li> You must be extremely careful with this product because if you put too much on, your face will resemble an oil slick the next day regardless of how much or how well you wash in the morning.  It worked very well on reducing the size of my pores, but it was difficult to figure out how much was enough, how much was too much, and how much was too little.  I went back to the regular Rejuvenate night cream.</li>
    <li> The Anew Rejuvenate Night Sapphire Emulsion felt oily but I thought I&#x27;d give it a try since only certain oils don&#x27;t break me out.  I&#x27;d been using Trilane squalane oil purchased through the Dr. Lark newsletter, but was hoping the Avon Anew Sapphire would have the added benefit of shrinking my large pores.  Well, after using it just three nights in a row I am starting to get some breakouts on my face.  Given how long it takes residual zit marks to totally disappear, I don&#x27;t think I will continue using it.  Too bad, I wanted to like it, especially as it&#x27;s my favorite color.</li>
    <li> This product is amazing. I have been using it for two and half weeks and I am so impressed. I am in my early 20&#x27;s but was starting to see some fine lines on my forehead and  around my eyes. I was looking for a product that would not only smooth out those lines but reduce my pores. I saw the commercial for this product and ordered it right away. The first day you notice that your skin feels hydrated and smooth. The 14th day your skin is flawless, like its airbrushed! I don&#x27;t have to worry about wearing makeup due to flaws. I had the biggest compliment from a stranger saying that she hated me because my skin was perfect. Not only did this product work but my skin is clear and radiant. I will def. buy this product and keep it as a nightly routine. Thanks AVON!</li>
    <li> I have been iso a great moisturizer. My face is dry year round. I get dry patches in my foundation and it cracks. My grandmother wears this and I found it in her cabinet and tried it! It really sits on your skin and my face was still super moisturized the next morning. I&#x27;m not sure about the other benefits but it sure keeps your face super hydrated! I am 24 btw.</li>
    <li> OK, so I usually use the Anew Rejuvenate Night Cream, and decided I would try this. It goes on great, decent smell, skin didnt tingle upon application, etc. The next morning I woke up and my entire face was blotchy and red. I dont normally respond to any creams or products in this way, and am still trying to get rid of the redness and \\&quot; burnt\\&quot; spots days later. Beware!</li>
    <li> This did shrink my pores and make my skin look great.  Until about day 5 that is. I have rosacea which had calmed down quite a bit with the cleanser and day moisturizer.  My face is now just as red if not more than when I started using Anew line.  I love everything about his except my skin is too sensitive for it.  So if you don&#x27;t have sensitive skin - go for it!  If you do, be careful!</li>
    <li> This is a very good product that offers excellent hydration.&lt;br /&gt;It is a shame that Avon discontinued it as they do for many of their more well-liked products.</li>
    <li> this stuff burns when you put it on. I only had to try it twice to realize how awful it is. it was so painful and i dont have sensitive skin at all. I am using retinol which can make your skin somewhat sensitive but even in the areas where i dont use the retinol it burned it and made my face so red.</li>
    <li> I am 66 and have very dry skin that has been looking very dull. I bought this product and applied it in the evening before retiring for the night.  (It goes on like silk, by the way). When I awoke the next morning I was shocked at the difference it made in my complexion after just one application!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has been less than a week and the large pores on my nose are definitely less noticeable. The skin that had started to sag on my jaw area looks a little more defined.  These are HUGE improvements in my opinion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t take very much at all to cover the face and neck.  The only negative, in my opinion, is because it feels like and goes on like silk, it is not absorbed readily into the skin. If you are home for the evening it might be best to put it on earlier versus later.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love this product and will purchase again very soon just to have more on hand before price increases.</li>
    <li> Like some of the other reviewers mentioned, this feels SO greasy amd oily, it really feels disgusting putting it on your skin. The first time i used it I was really apprehensive, because my skin is very prone to breakouts. Lo and behold, after a few days of using, I got one of the worst breakouts I&#x27;ve had in years.&lt;br /&gt;Gave it 2 stars simply because I was able to use the remainder of the jar on my neck/chest without any catastrophic results (since I don&#x27;t get breakouts there). Would not recommend to anyone with oily/acne-prone skin &amp; will certainly never buy again</li>
    <li> been using this for about a year now and really like it. It&#x27;s not greasy and feels soft on the skin</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried many products on my face...Many clog my pores and make them look larger.  I&#x27;m 56 and still have break-outs from time to time.  This product works wonders.  My face feels smoother and my pores much smaller.  After spending tons of money in search of the perfect product, I&#x27;ve found it!  Hope they don&#x27;t stop making it.</li>
    <li> While I like this lotion myself, please note that this lotion is extremely heavy and never actually soaks into the skin.  I put it sparingly on my face, heavier around my eyes, and I can rub it in for a good 15 minutes without ever having the lotion disappear into my skin.  The issue I have with that is that when I lay down to go to sleep, I have to lay a towel on my pillow so that I don&#x27;t get the lotion all over my pillow, and it makes my skin feel greasy/heavy.  I continue to use it, though, because although I have oily skin, if I don&#x27;t moisturize it I seem to break out and my fine lines/wrinkles become much more noticeable under my makeup.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for nearly a month now. The results so far have been great.  This product has been able to even out my skin tone, it has faded my acne scars, my face looks fresher in the morning...no complaints at all!  Also, I have been using this product alone, meaning I didn&#x27;t pair it up with any of the other Rejuvenate products ever since I started using this one.  I&#x27;m thinking I should definitely use other products because this one worked so well for me.</li>
    <li> Only cream that hydrates my oily skin and visible reduces find lines. It is very shiny when you put it on but it&#x27;s with looking shiny at bed time to see great results. Glycolic acid sends to be the only ingredient I&#x27;ve found to actually visibly reduce fine lines. But sure if this will work on deep wrinkles but it&#x27;s made for 30 year old skin abd works great on it.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff. Amazing product. Leave my skin soft, supple and hydrated. Sister and Mom now use it as well. My sister even uses it on her hands. Higher priced serums don&#x27;t work as well as this one does! Only thing, don&#x27;t use right before bed, let it soak in before your head hits the  pillow.</li>
    <li> I think it&#x27;s too oil for my skin. Smell too good too.&lt;br /&gt;My face can&#x27;t absorb too oil face cream, I got some oil pimples after use it.</li>
    <li> Burns my sensitive skin!!!</li>
    <li> Great for the overnight lift up.  I wouldn&#x27;t use it every night as I have sensitive skin, but 2-3 times a week is more than enough for soft skin in the morning.</li>
    <li> I use Avon Anew Rejuvenate Day &amp; Night Creams and love them both.  I purchased the Sapphire Emulsion by accident thinking it was my usual Anew Night Cream.  I am used to the Anew Rejuvenate Night Cream absorbing into my skin and making it feel really nice.  This stuff left my face feeling sticky and even after waiting a bit to go to bed, I still felt like I was almost sticking to my pillow.  I gave it a couple tries but just I couldn&#x27;t take it.  I threw the jar away.</li>
    <li> being in my early 40s im haveing issues with my pores being larger..the price was so cheap i said ok try it! a week now my pores are still huge!! i have sensitive skin and no breakout!!its very concentrated use to much u have a greasy face!!its okay overall but i prefer the advance wrinkle corrector by avon 10x more!!</li>
