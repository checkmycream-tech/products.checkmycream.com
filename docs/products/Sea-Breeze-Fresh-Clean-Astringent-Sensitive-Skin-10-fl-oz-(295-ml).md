      <li>My skin felt fresh and was smooth, clear, and toned.</li>

    <li> My husband and I both have sensitive skin and this is one astringent we can both agree on. My husband actually started using it first and then I&#x27;d steal it for my bathroom. Finally I started buying this for myself. It is very inexpensive and works as well as more expensive products. It does have alcohol in it but is mostly water. This also contains camphor, clove and eucalyptus. I don&#x27;t mind the scent at all because it is very mild. I use this at least twice a day and it keeps my skin clear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;~The Rebecca Review</li>
    <li> I love this astringent!  I can actually see the dirt it removed from my face on the pad, and it leaves my face feeling cool, clean, and refreshed.  I also think the fragrance is rather mild and nice.  My only complaint is that I have sensitive skin and though it claims to be good for sensitive skin it is a little harsh.  I cannot use it everyday.  But overall it is a great product and I will be buying again.</li>
    <li> Years ago Sea Breeze was used during medical procedures. I remember using it as a teenager and I never had problems with acne. I purchased this for my son when he started wanting something for his. It works well. It can be used for many purposes and they have an entire line of skin care if you can find it.</li>
    <li> I purchased it since I have been using the Sea Breeze in Japan. As the product description says, its for sensitive skin, and naturally it&#x27;s a bit weaker (softer) to the skin than the standard one you could get in Japan.</li>
    <li> - Cleans effectively, but with less &amp;#34;sting&amp;#34; I would say which some would like.&lt;br /&gt;- There is a scent to it, but its not overpowering&lt;br /&gt;- Decent price compared to products in store, but not sure I&#x27;d say its a &amp;#34;name brand&amp;#34; such as clean and clear which I typically use&lt;br /&gt;- Amazon delivered quickly.</li>
    <li> I love the minty refreshing feeling of this toner.  I am on my third bottle!</li>
    <li> I bought this product because I like the smell of Sea Breeze and because I have very sensitive skin. This product did not disappoint. It has the same scent as Sea Breeze, but does not irritate my skin. I use it after shaving and although it does wake you up a bit, it doesn&#x27;t burn. It also doesn&#x27;t seem to dry out my skin, which is a big plus. I am very pleased with Sea Breeze Fresh Clean Astringent and would not hesitate to recommend it.</li>
    <li> I was a little skeptical at first after using so many products.  As soon as I used it I was surprised on how much dirt it removed for my face.  It&#x27;s a must have in my beauty products ..</li>
    <li> Very good deep cleaning on you skin.  Prevents for acne and leaves skin looking dry and clean.  Especially, with sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> Great product.  Cleans my skin and leaves it soft.  I use it for taking my makeup off, but the hubs uses it after he shaves.</li>
    <li> Great product !! been using it for years. Service was A # 1</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for two weeks, and SO FAR, it really works! My face has a lot of clogged pores and it breaks out badly once in a while. The last time i broke out badly, I decided to give this a try. During the first week, I didnt notice anything except that it made my skin feel kind of shiny and sticky after applying it. I also got a lot of tiny bumps/whiteheads? in places where i have clogged pores but no major pimples. After the first week, I started using it just once a day, and then i started noticing major results. My skin felt fresh and was smooth, clear, and toned. My pores actually did seem smaller. I still have the tiny bumps, but my face overall looks so much better, i dont even care about the bumps. The smell is a bit overpowering though. Overall, I hope this product keeps doing its job.</li>
    <li> My husband love this product. On the advice of my hairdresser he uses this on his hair and scalp before shampooing to aid his flaky scalp.  I looked all over in drug stores, and any other store I happened to be in and couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere.  I should have know better and checked Amazon in the first place!</li>
    <li> I have been using Sea Breeze for sensitive skin for years.  I love the fresh clean way it makes my skin feel and look.</li>
    <li> Sea Breeze Fresh-Clean Astringent, Sensitive Skin 10 fl oz (295 ml) It does what it should.  I will order again.</li>
    <li> Sea Breeze has been around for a long time and for very good reason. I&#x27;ve been using it since my early 20&#x27;s.&lt;br /&gt;I 1st started using Sea Breeze to clean my face of dirt, oil &amp; any left over make-up residue after cleansing.&lt;br /&gt;Then I found I could use it on my legs after shaving as an astringent to help with the post shaving itch/inflammation I get.&lt;br /&gt;Then my hairstylist told me I could also use it on my scalp periodically to help keep it from drying out and becoming flaky. I just saturate my scalp with it, let it sit on my scalp for 30 minutes or so and then wash, condition, etc as usual. It has been fantastic in helping me with flakiness. You should give it a try as well.</li>
    <li> this stuff worked middling well on my teens faces...they complain about the astringent effect near eyes..but thats how the game is played- the product works</li>
    <li> I use Sea Breeze Astringent as a regular part of my facial routine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sea Breeze also calms mosquito bites.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It makes my skin feel fresh and clean.</li>
    <li> I Love This Product! It Really Cleans Your Pores Well! I Have Less Breakouts Because Of Proper Cleaning At The End Of The Day, After Wearing Makeup. Found This After Watching A YouTube Video And So Happy I Got It! Part Of My Face Routine Now! Face Looks Cleaner, You Get A Slight Tingle Refreshing Feeling,  Pleasant Smell, Very Happy! Fast Shipping! Thank You!</li>
    <li> Use this instead of soap to clean your face.  Leaves you feeling freshened, tingly clean.  At the same time keep those pesty blemishes at bay.  I never use soap on my face and I never have blemishes even during teen years.  If you have extreme oily skin use the original.</li>
    <li> Helps with itchy scalp, used for years and glad found this product again.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this Astringent, it leaves my skin feeling cool and clean. Best used to remove leftover face makeup.</li>
    <li> I like it. Cleans and takes the extra makeup</li>
    <li> very quick shipping, price was a little high but bought it anyway</li>
    <li> A friend of mind stated that many of the popular dermatology did not work to clear up the facial issues she was having.  So she tried the age old Sea Breeze to clears her facial issues and it worked.  So when I experienced a rash I ordered Sea Breeze and it cleared this problem.</li>
    <li> Love how this stuff feels! If it&#x27;s possible I think it feels like a cough drop for my face! The clean you get is amazing!</li>
    <li> The product is fine it&#x27;s just that the price is much higher than in supermarkets</li>
    <li> It was for my uncle and he absolutely loves it</li>
    <li> I have always used this product off and on. It works well on my face and neck. Sometimes I will use green mint alcohol on my neck, elbows and knees and that works in keeping them looking like new. I will not use the alcohol on my face ever. But we all know that we shouldn&#x27;t do that. It is very important to cleanse your face twice a day. This is not a myth it is a fact.  After cleansing my face with my battery operated brush and I also have one that charges that I use. Than I will use Sea Breeze and on the cotton ball there will still be some dirt that comes off of my face.  This truly amazes me the two times I cleanse my face per day how much dirt our face catches in the home and outside of course. Have fun staying beautiful.</li>
