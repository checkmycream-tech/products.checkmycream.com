      <li>went in Amazon found it and loved it!!</li>
      <li>I absolutely loved that fragrance! !!</li>
      <li>I am so happy I could scream...</li>
      <li>This is a good choice.  </li>
      <li>Loved the perfume, but not the bottling.</li>
      <li>As I said, the scent seems good but do not recommend this seller to anyone.</li>
      <li>and it smelled so good on me.  </li>
      <li>I love the way this stuff smells!</li>
      <li>So many compliments on the fragrance!</li>
      <li>This came in a nice size bottle to carry in your purse.</li>
      <li>I am so thrilled.</li>
      <li>love love love the scent!!</li>
      <li>Angel smells nice but what I get out of that more then anything is a powdery smell.</li>
      <li>I absolutely love it.  </li>
      <li>I have applied it only to my wrists, but it is floating around me in the best way.</li>
      <li>and I love the name :)</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure the quality and durability of my perfume is going to suffer.</li>
      <li>such a wonderful scent</li>
      <li>Love this perfume and it arrived timely.</li>
      <li>tiny but perfect for my purse and my favorite perfume</li>
      <li>This is the perfect size for me as I don&#x27;t wear it daily.</li>
      <li>Cute on the go bottle n smells just like it&#x27;s supposed too</li>
      <li>If a man wears this, I probably won&#x27;t be able to tell the difference.</li>
      <li>Lovely scent, lots of compliments</li>
      <li>Its OK</li>
      <li>First, I got this as a sample; once I wore it I got so many compliments on how good I smelled.</li>
      <li>Love this one not to strong ..</li>
      <li>This is an evening fragrance, that layers nicely with your mood.&lt;br /&gt;It has an alluring appeal that pairs well with the right chemistry.&lt;br /&gt;Cause and Effect (warning!)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Found it to be light and not over powering.</li>
      <li>Again... Cheap plastic lids on bottles.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t say if I like it, since it tends to be very strong; more on the masculine side.</li>
      <li>, I did not receive a decant; I got the original mini bottle-which was so  amazingly fantastic.</li>
      <li>And size of the bottle so perfect it can be fitted in any small purse</li>
      <li>Definitely unique scent.</li>
      <li>Intact, cute, thank you so much, Seller.&lt;br /&gt;Last, JASMINE.</li>
      <li>Feminine without being too sweet or flowery.  </li>
      <li>Dont think its the real thing, it smells okay,</li>

      <li>This is my absolute new favorite fragrance!</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s nice but was  a lot smaller  than  </li>
      <li>/&gt;I&#x27;m definitely not happy about the price and value received... nevertheless, it smells great!</li>
      <li>Other than that, it does smell nice and unique.</li>
      <li>And the little  perfume bottle is so unique and cute!</li>
      <li>Sexy and definitely made for evening wear.</li>

<li> so it was worth the money spent!</li>
<li> It smells high end to me, definatly not a cheap smell.</li>
<li> This one didn&#x27;t seem to last as long.</li>
<li> but this fragrance goes a long way..</li>
<li> Thought bottle would have been a little big larger for the price</li>
<li> I bought the smallest bottle possible, and the stopper broke the 3rd time and there&#x27;s no way to fix it and the hole is so small</li>
<li> I&#x27;ll probably get a few months use out of this tiny bottle.</li>
<li> Something different that you don&#x27;t get to smell everyday!</li>
<li> I contacted the seller, I sent pictures of the absurd, but so far nothing has been done!</li>
<li> That I find a little bothering.</li>
<li> Didn&#x27;t realize the size was as small as it was</li>
<li> and I received a sample of the Alien perfume by Thiery Muglar</li>
<li> I must NOT have read  the ounces amount,  cuz this bottle was the size of my pinky,  like wtf.  </li>
<li> Very disappointed in this.</li>
<li> Horrible!</li>

    <li> Again... Cheap plastic lids on bottles. Break within 2 or 3 openings. Call Amazon if this happens to you!</li>
    <li> This is a good choice.  I will always get this in the future.</li>
    <li> It was exactly what I was looking for.  Feminine without being too sweet or flowery.  ...and I love the name :)</li>
    <li> tiny but perfect for my purse and my favorite perfume</li>
    <li> I must NOT have read  the ounces amount,  cuz this bottle was the size of my pinky,  like wtf.  But the smell was just what I wanted.</li>
    <li> I recently went to Macy&#x27;s to purchase perfume and I received a sample of the Alien perfume by Thiery Muglar went in Amazon found it and loved it!! Thanks</li>
    <li> I got mini&#x27;s of Alien, Light Blue and Michael Kors to sample my favorite out of them.. is Alien, and I like Alien better then Angel. Angel smells nice but what I get out of that more then anything is a powdery smell. With Alien I pick up more scents throughout the day. It smells high end to me, definatly not a cheap smell. Mysterious and alluring is how I would describe it.</li>
    <li> Thought bottle would have been a little big larger for the price</li>
    <li> a little small, but smells great!</li>
    <li> I absolutely love it.  I bought the smallest bottle possible, and the stopper broke the 3rd time and there&#x27;s no way to fix it and the hole is so small, I cannot think of another way to plug it up.  I&#x27;m sure the quality and durability of my perfume is going to suffer. Buy a bigger bottle.</li>
    <li> First, I got this as a sample; once I wore it I got so many compliments on how good I smelled. The next question was what are you wearing? Wow!</li>

    <li> Loved the perfume, but not the bottling. Cap didn&#x27;t fit back in bottle correctly so I could not use it as a purse perfume as what I bought it for. Very disappointed in this. So now it sits on my dresser.</li>
    <li> The scent looks good, but inside there was only the smell because it was completely empty! bottle lid Was a wad of paper. Horrible! I contacted the seller, I sent pictures of the absurd, but so far nothing has been done! As I said, the scent seems good but do not recommend this seller to anyone.</li>
    <li> Definitely unique scent. I can&#x27;t say if I like it, since it tends to be very strong; more on the masculine side. If a man wears this, I probably won&#x27;t be able to tell the difference. That I find a little bothering. Other than that, it does smell nice and unique. I can&#x27;t gather words to explain exactly how I feel about this fragrance. Something different that you don&#x27;t get to smell everyday!</li>
    <li> WOW.&lt;br /&gt;First, I did not receive a decant; I got the original mini bottle-which was so  amazingly fantastic. Intact, cute, thank you so much, Seller.&lt;br /&gt;Last, JASMINE. Yes, I intentionally wrote that in caps. I wanted exactly this in a new Jasmine frag, and I got it. I am so happy I could scream... Big, bold jasmine. Sexy and definitely made for evening wear. I have applied it only to my wrists, but it is floating around me in the best way. Whoo! I am shaking I am so thrilled.</li>
    <li> This is my absolute new favorite fragrance!</li>
    <li> I LOVE this eau de toilette by Thierry Mugler and I wanted to have a small one for my purse when I&#x27;m out and about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I read the specs but did&#x27;t realize I was paying so much for a SAMPLE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is actually a sample size that you get at a perfume store or with the purchase of the same perfume in a bigger size.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;m definitely not happy about the price and value received... nevertheless, it smells great!</li>
    <li> Its OK but I wouldn&#x27;t buy again</li>
