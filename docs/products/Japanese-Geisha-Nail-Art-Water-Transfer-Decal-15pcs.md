      <li>It&#x27;s also not as vivid as in the picture.</li>
      <li>They are Easy to put on and are very long lasting.</li>
      <li>They actually came much faster then what the estimate delivery date, quoted to me on here... which is a major plus...</li>

    <li> these dont come off well</li>
    <li> I was soo excited when I decided to buy these expensive nail decal for my nails, so I expected it to be great quality I am disapointed to say that I had a not so good experince.. maybe because it was my first time using this brand but it was hard to fit the decal on my nails (I have long nails, too!) when I apply it I had a hard time making the decal to stay flat on my nails for me to then apply my top coat and afterwords the decal got all crush and my mani only lasted like three days before the decal had worng out and was falling off from my nails. ( I used OPI base and top coat on my nails). If you are thinking about buy this good luck to you.  I still have some left ofter and I will try to give it a second change but ... ??</li>

    <li> LIKED THE GEISHA GIRL LOOK</li>
    <li> Beautiful nail decals!</li>
    <li> Yes... I finally received the decals..... They are so beautiful..... They actually came much faster then what the estimate delivery date, quoted to me on here... which is a major plus... I am so pleased.... I just can&#x27;t wait until I apply then to my nails.... I will absolutely be purchasing more of them!!!!!!:-)</li>
    <li> these are very colorful just as the picture shows. very nice and easy to use. I love that they don&#x27;t affect the gel polish I use.</li>
    <li> It looks nothing like the picture. For starters, the decals are a lot smaller than advertised. There are also twenty geisha decals rather than 15. Some say more is better, but in this case, it is really not. I also got extra decals that are not geishas, but the extra are an advertisement symbol for alternailtive.com.  The decals also have a bad print and are a lot darker than in the photos. I will make use of them somehow but, I will never order these again.</li>
    <li> The estimated delivery is 2-4 weeks, but I got them in just a few days. And they are wonderful and so simple to put on! They go on exactly like temporary tattoos and look exactly like the picture! So many compliments on my nails and I&#x27;ve already ordered more! Thanks for this great product!</li>
    <li> im love this will buy more soon</li>
    <li> this is really nice  a must have</li>
    <li> Love it, really detailed nail tatoo, beautiful</li>
    <li> The print is clear but they were a little hard to put on. It&#x27;s also not as vivid as in the picture.</li>
    <li> They are exactly as pictured.  I placed them over LeChat mood nail polish.  Awesome!</li>
