    <li> Great hair spray.  Excellent hold.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product, I have been trying to find a strong, non sticky spray that actually holds... this spray is strong, non-smelly, and it has benefits for helping hair get stronger.  I actually bought the entire line, the shampoo, conditioner and scalp treatment.  I had tried every brand of strong hold spray from salons and beauty isles, and I think I have found the last spray I will ever buy.  It&#x27;s just that good.  It doesn&#x27;t make your hair sticky - it holds in place the style that you have already created!</li>
    <li> It gave my hair so much more body!!</li>

    <li> I have fine/thin hair and I have tried almost every product out on the market today. This is a nice hair spray that is lightweight and keeps the hold of the style. It is not sticky.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like this product out of all others and will continue to buy. However, it is pricey, so use sparingly.</li>
    <li> My beautician told me of this brand. I have used it for only a couple of weeks. The shamoo throughly cleans the hair with one wash and rinse. The hair spray is great it holds without being stiff. It does change the textur of my hair.  It is for a day or two afgter being washed but seems to become unruley after that. Being african american, I typically don&#x27;t wash my hair more than twice a week. I am still experimenting to find the right balance.</li>
    <li> need this but it does make my hair feel brittle.</li>
    <li> I was looking for a spray that help with the volume of my hair as well as hold the style.  I wear my hair short. It&#x27;s very straight.&lt;br /&gt;After styling my hair with a dryer, I used this spray several times.  Within an hour of spraying, my hair looked like it hadn&#x27;t been touched.</li>
    <li> Smells fabulous holds great!</li>
    <li> The hair spray smells great.  It works well until the humidity sets in.  Then my hair starts to go flat and the hair spray starts to look greasy.  I have very fine, thin hair.  This hairspray may work well for others.</li>
    <li> Great price for this product.</li>
    <li> Holds hair all day. Love nioxin Products.</li>
    <li> Really a great product.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for several years.  It is a must if you want to keep  your hairdo in place.  It brushes out at the end of the day.  My hair will not stay in place without&lt;br /&gt;this hairspray .  I have recommended it to many of my friends and they love it also.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alyce</li>
