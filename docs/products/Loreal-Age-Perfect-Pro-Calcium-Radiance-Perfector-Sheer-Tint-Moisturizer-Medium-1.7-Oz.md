<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s tinted moisturizer is the best of several I have used.  Smooth, easy application.  Skin looks and feels soft.  It&#x27;s the only one I purchase.</li>
    <li> I think this is the best foundation I ever had.  It feels clean.  I was worried that they were discontinuing so I bought 2.</li>
    <li> This is nice to use when you don&#x27;t have time to fuss with make-up that is why I prefer the medium tint to the light tint.</li>
    <li> I love the product.  Unfortunately, the pump worked for a bout one week and since then I have been unable to get any out of the tube!!</li>
    <li> This product can be used instead of a separate serum, moisturizer, and base makeup.  The product also contains BHA which isn&#x27;t listed in the product description.  One reviewer mentioned it was overly tinted..that was not my experience.  BUT if you are fair skinned you should try a lighter shade.</li>
    <li> I am 55 and have never used a foundation before.  This product goes on light and feels good and covers great without the look of a heavy foundation.  I havent been able to find it in stores, was a clearance item. My experience on Amazon was easy and I received my order in a timely manner.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a number of years and love it.  Couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere in the stores and was directed to your site through O&#x27;Oreal which apparently has discontinued this great product.  If you have a stock of this moisterizer, I would love to buy another one.</li>
    <li> Love this tinted moisturizer! It goes on smooth &amp; has very little scent, which I like. I never really wear makeup but decided my skin could use a little color.  I chose this after reading the great reviews &amp; didn&#x27;t want to waste my money on different products, trying to find the right color etc.  My skin is drier during the winter so I mix this with regular Loreal moisturizer.  Will definitely purchase again.</li>
    <li> Just received my microplane cutting tool and have used it for ginger and cheese.  I have been very pleased with its performance and just love the easy clean-up. It is a must have in the kitchen drawer!</li>
    <li> Love this product.  Makes my mature skin luminous with a healthy glow. But, when I went to purchase a new container at Walgrens, I was told they are not carrying it any longer.  Then I went to Wal Mart and they didn&#x27;t have it either.  Wondering why in the world two such big chain stores are no longer selling this wonderful product, I resorted to Amazon.com and found that ordering online is easy. Plus online I found just what I was looking for.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I LOVE the product.</li>
    <li> Loreal created an excellent product --- a tinted moisturizer --- that is perfect for the over 40 skin. It is not heavy on the skin, adds a hint of color and goes on nicely. And it moisturizes. Unfortunately, Loreal discontinued it this summer ... So I&#x27;m glad I found it on Amazon, and the vendor sent it the very next day. A win-win situation! Now if only Loreal would continue selling the product ...!</li>
    <li> This is the best product L&#x27;Oreal has ever made.  Perfect blend of sheer tint and moisturizer.  Not being sold in most stores any more - so glad to find it on Amazon.  As an older woman, this product adds a wonderful glow and evens out the skin tone.</li>
    <li> EXCELLENT PRODUCT. THRILLED THAT I WAS ABLE TO LOCATE THIS AS IT WAS NOT ON SHELVES AT ANY OF THE STORES I NORMALLY PURCHASE FROM. THANK YOU</li>
    <li> Received the product yesterday and found out that it was produced in April 2008! It is very bad to buy something like this! Will never buy products from onetree any more.</li>
    <li> I hadn&#x27;t been able to find this product at any of the retail stores so I thought I would try buying it on line, I don&#x27;t usually buy online. To my surprise it was easy, quick and much cheaper.  The product came to me in less time than I expected so that was a plus.</li>
    <li> After searching everywhere for this product, I was able to locate and order it thru&#x27; Amazon.  Thank you.  In the future, I shall  start my search with you.  Wonderful, efficient, and timely service.</li>
    <li> One of my friends told me about this moisturizer. I was pretty skeptical because I have light sensitive skin.  She let me try a little and I was hooked. It makes your skin very soft and it adds a bit of color to your face. It&#x27;s almost like a glow. It also has sunscreen. This was very easy to throw in my bag for camping or the beach.  It is also great in the winter to give your face a nice sun kissed look without over doing it. Plus, my face is always so soft. The price was very reasonable too!</li>
    <li> Had a hard time locating this product, not carried in any of my local stores.  Went to Amazon and purchased it at a much cheaper price than in retail stores.... If you have never tried this product, please do.  Gives just the right amount of light coverage with a healthy looking glow to it.... Love it!!!!!</li>
    <li> I love this product.  I picked it up on clearance one time and became addicted to it.  It provides the perfect amount of moisture, absorbs quickly and leaves you with a healthy glow.  I like that this product isn&#x27;t greasy and works well on sensitive skin.  I&#x27;m 27 and everyone complements me on my healthy skin.  I have fair skin so this product doesn&#x27;t make you too tan.  It just gives you that summer glow without makeup.   Your skin looks flawless!  Once I put a small amount of foundation under my eyes and on my nose my face looks perfect.  I highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> Very satisfied with this product.  I&#x27;ve always been pleased with anything by L&#x27;Oreal, this one in particular.  You don&#x27;t have to wear makeup with it since the color tint takes its place.</li>
    <li> In recent months, I have not been able to find this product on store shelves and wondered, with dismay, if it was no longer available.  This would have been a travesty for me as I have come to rely on this product.  It covers my face evenly and gives a shine and healthy glow to my face that makes me feel awake and confident to face the day (no pun intended).  I hope that you will have this product available forever.  Please tell me if this is a discontinued product from L&#x27;Oreal, because I really feel it is an absolutely necessary product for us aging beauties!</li>
    <li> This product is wonderful. It adds a tiny bit of color and gives my face a healthy glow. Unlike cake or powder make up that adds a pasty unnatural look.</li>
    <li> absolutely LOVE  this product..  Use it EVERY DAY - FEELS GREAT  LOOKS GREAT....Love it... will  order again !! Can just use instead  of other make up  just for daily  use  and looks good -</li>
    <li> this product is wonderful.   I find it gives my complexion a brighter look, feels so good, and my skin improves with it.  Love, love, love it.</li>
    <li> I did try the medium, has alot of orange tone to it, but if you mix it with the light not to bad. Goes on light and smooth. If you are fair, not a good shade for you. I wish they sold this product(fair) in stores but you can only get it online. Suprise for me. All you ladies out there who don&#x27;t like heavy makeup this is wonderful. Give it a try you will use it all the time. Also, it is SPF a plus for us all.</li>
    <li> This is the BEST Sheer Tint Moisturizer I have ever used.  I have used a lot of different and much more expensive products than this.  This goes on so smooth and feels really good on your face.  It lasts a long time and does not DRY out as some products do on your skin.  I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This is a great product but I can&#x27;t seem to find it in stores anymore.</li>
    <li> From my understanding, this product is no longer being made.  However, when I saw on Amazon, I decided to give it a try to compare it to the Lancome tinted moisturizer, which is much more expensive.  I love the way this goes on and the clean smell that it has.  In fact, I like it than the Lancome one and have ordered several to stock up.</li>
    <li> I stopped using makeup and tried tinted moisturizers. I&#x27;ve used others--name brands like Jergens, Aveeno, and a couple of others but L&#x27;oreal is the one that I thought was best. Its smoother, goes on easily and naturally and adds a glow that I thought was missing from the others.  It&#x27;s the only one I&#x27;ll use now.</li>
    <li> i have been unable to find product in stores and was glad i could order it on line.  enjoyed receiving this item.  i  received this item promptly.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for over a year and had heard that L&#x27;Oreal was not making it anymore. I went to all the stores I could think of to buy what was left...I love this tint. I am fair skinned but I ended up with the medium and I love it. It has some sun screen in it and it is not heavy on your face. It gives a smooth appearance to the skin and someone actually asked me if I had done a peel, as my skin looked so smooth. I had not been using the product because I was conserving it for when I went out. I was so happy when I found it on Amazon I bought 4! L&#x27;Oreal better continue making it or they are going to be hearing from many people that I told about it as well as myself - this is definitely a 10 in my book!</li>
    <li> I have used this for years.  It blends in sun damage spots and gives my face a glow.  I even mix it with my regular foundation for a bit of a tan.  I cannot find this anywhere locally, so I&#x27;m glad I found it on line.</li>
    <li> This is the third bottle of Loreal Age Perfect Pro-Calcium (tinted).  It is wonderful. I will keep buying it! It has really helped my dry skin.</li>
    <li> I was unable to find this moisturizer in any of my local drugstores or Walmart, and happily found it here.  I purchased two so I won&#x27;t run out.  Love the way it gives my face that bronze glow.</li>
    <li> This is one of L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s best products.  They have discontinued the product so was exceedingly&lt;br /&gt;pleased to be able to get it thru Amazon.  I have used this product for 4 years and there is no&lt;br /&gt;other product that I have tried that measures up to L&#x27;Oreal&#x27;s.  I am sorry they discontinued.</li>
    <li> I really love this product. It&#x27;s funny I discovered it by accident, you know how Walgreens has that markdown section. It is usually in the back of the store. The product was markdown to four dollars and some change. So I said what the heck I will try it and OMG Oh My Goodness, I love it. It gives you that extra glow especially if you are like me for example, on the go and not really a make-up person. Now do not get me wrong, I like to look good but I am just not the type that will get up early for make-up. Sleep is more important. It is worth the investment.</li>
    <li> I have worked for some of the top cosmetic company&#x27;s in the world, and I can tell you it doesn&#x27;t have to be expensive to work! I&#x27;m now 55 yrs old and love, love, love this product! Just gives your skin and extra little boost, a glow. [[ASIN:B001E5EKM4 Loreal Age Perfect Pro-Calcium Radiance Perfector Sheer Tint Moisturizer, Medium - 1.7 Oz]]</li>
    <li> I am so addicted to this product that I can&#x27;t live without it. Everyone asks me what I use on my face cause it glows! It moisturizes and gives me a hint of a tan all year long. Its \\&quot;Perfect\\&quot;!</li>
    <li> I love L&#x27;Oreal Tinted Moisturizer because I don&#x27;t like the feel of anything on my skin and this moisturizer is so light yet does all that a regular makeup does.  It moisturizes, conceals and evens my skin tone without clogging pores and feeling greasy or heavy on my skin.  It is the closest thing to being without makeup.  For a special occasion, I mix a drop of the moisturizer with a drop of regular makeup and this helps to spread evenly and lightens the feel of regular makeup.  I love it.</li>
    <li> i use a makeup brush to apply and it is flawless.  more like a tinted moisturizer with great coverage.  i am going to order more just to make sure they dont run out. makes my skin tone nice and even AND FOR 0VER 65 WITH A FEW LINES AND WRINKLES THIS IS AMAZING.  TRY THIS</li>
    <li> I was afraid it would be old inventory and dried up but it seems to be in great condition.  I sure would like to know why Loreal stopped making this particular product or whether there is something comparable to it out there.  I paid 16 dollars for it at one point and this was double that price.  So...while I love the product, it&#x27;s a budget buster and tough to justify spending this much on make up.</li>
    <li> I ordered the light tint, and being tanner, I ordered the darker and really do not see a tint to the color of my face but love the other effects. I am using this whole line and a week in am in love with it all!!</li>
    <li> I was very happy to find this item through Amazon since I can&#x27;t find it in stores anymore. I have been using it for years and like it much better than foundation.</li>
    <li> I have been using Loreal Age Perfect Sheer Tint Moisturizer for about 2 years and have tried other products and they don&#x27;t compare.&lt;br /&gt;The Loreal Sheer Tint Moisturizer is the very best.  I read quite a few of the other reviews and I think everyone should let Loreal know how we feel.  You find a good product and then you can&#x27;t find it anymore. I looked everywhere.  I am glad I found it on Amazon</li>
    <li> I love this product.  It is very creamy, light and sheer.  It evens out skin tones but keeps a sheer, radiant look.  I haven&#x27;t been able to find it in the stores lately and it is hard to find on line, so I think it must have been discontinued.  Tried replacing it with Aveno, but it is very thick and heavy.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for 3 years and is now sold out in retail stores.  I always get it on Amazon. Fast shipment. Thanks.</li>
    <li> I like that this is a light moisturizer that adds a bit of sheen and has some color.  But the color of this \\&quot;sheer\\&quot; tint is a bit dark. I am fairly light and therefore wear this on under my foundation as it would be a bit too dark without foundation.  Fortunately they have a medium and light.  I will get the lighter color so I can wear it without foundation.</li>
    <li> The product is nongreasy and is easy to apply to my face, and gives it a nice tint of color.</li>
    <li> I love this product, However I find it too expensive.  All my friends love the way it looks on me, however I find it so expensive, it almost doubled in price.</li>
    <li> I usually stick with natural cosmetics but occaisionally try other things. I read an article about this combination of moisturizer and tint and the rest is history-I can&#x27;t imagine being without it.  I am 62 years old and this product takes 20 years off my face by adding a little glow and smoothing out skin tone.  I am thrilled.  Only concern is that it is a bit hard to get out of the bottle.</li>
    <li> I love this product. Haven&#x27;t found anything like it. Very sheer with just a little color. unfortunately it&#x27;s hard to find.</li>
    <li> I have used this product previously but was disappointed in this order.  One container was okay but the other had an orange tint and went on too streaky.  I will not order it again.</li>
    <li> When time is limited your can use this product for a hint of color, glow and moisture.  I even use this as my moisturizer under my other foundations. I have purchased expensive product but this is my favorite.</li>
    <li> I love this wonderful moisturizer and mild foundation tint. I couldn&#x27;t find in the stores any longer but online it&#x27;s even a better bargain.</li>
    <li> Was so glad to find this product on Amazon. I have used it for a couple of years and was devastated to find Loreal had discontinued it.   Haven&#x27;t opened any of the 3 I purchased from BD Great Buys yet, hope they work okay.Will let them and you know if I have a problem. I received the shipment much sooner than was expected.

    <li> I love, love it.  It was taken off the market last year.  I don&#x27;t klnow why.  I&#x27;m stocked up but to buy it online it&#x27;s very expensive.  I guess not too many are around.  It makes your skin gleam and radiate without the heaviness of make-up.  I always get compliments .  People ask me if I was in Fla.  A few people asked me about it and now they buy it online.  I was paying orginally only $12 (sales and coupons).  Now online it goes for $40.  BRING IT BACK TO THE DRUG STORES1</li>
    <li> This is a great moisturizer (and I live in the desert!) and provides just the right amount of coverage and tint. I especially like the \\&quot;medium\\&quot; tint in the summer, when I have a bit of tan on my face.  It is the best product of its kind that I&#x27;ve found, because it looks like natural color, not an instant tanner.</li>
    <li> This is a nice product. The only problem I had was the color. I ordered medium but when I put it on my face it was too dark and too orange. Maybe I should have ordered light. I fixed it by mixing it with a light moisturizer I already had and it&#x27;s good.</li>
    <li> Beautiful finish for tired older skin.  Loreal should come up with a similar product with  a radiant and luminous finish.</li>
    <li> It makes me break out :( would love to find an oil free version..... I have sensitive skin &amp; this gave me acne</li>
    <li> I ordered two (2) ea of this at my Sweeties&#x27;s request.  She started jumping with happiness and gave me a big hug when I gave her packet of this product.  She started using it same day and says it is one of the best facial anti ageing cream that she has ever used.  It gives natural glow and radiance to the face.  She very highly recommends this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The online service provided by Amazon and Beauty is amazing.  Very efficient, prompt, very quick and courteous in e-mail correspondence.  I mistyped the house number in my order.  At my request via e-mail, Beauty.com corrected the house number manually on the packet itself.  THANK YOU so much to the Beauty.com guy/gal who corrected it.  Otherwise, this order would have gone to the wrong address, never to be seen, and worse is, I wouldn&#x27;t get a big hug from her, and she wouldn&#x27;t have the pleasure of using such a wonderful product....!!!</li>
    <li> I use this along with my other moisturizer. Love the tint, not paste-y and it moisturizes the skin all day.</li>
    <li> Have bee using this product for a couple of years.  Love iit.  Great moisturizer/ makeup.  Easy to apply.  Makes skin soft and glowing.  I am often asked what product I use on my skin.</li>
    <li> I used to adore Paula Dorf&#x27;s tinted moisturizer in jet set glo but it often times made my skin very greasy and it would sometimes bead up and roll on application however the color and luminosity was gorgeous.  I saw the reviews for this and thought I&#x27;d try it.  The price was my first deterring factor - lets face it, it&#x27;s Loreal and while I love some of their products the price point seemed high.  Now I would pay every penny for it!!!!  I got the medium because I tan my body but not my face so the SPF is essential for me.  This is all I need to wear to have beautiful radiant skin and it feels light and fabulous on with absolutely no breakouts!!  I am peri-menopausal right now so my skin is acting somewhat differently.  For those of you looking for coverage, this is probably not for you but if you have good skin to start with this is the only step you&#x27;ll need for sheer luminous golden skin - brilliant for Summer and women who want a sun kissed glow &amp;#60;3 &amp;#60;3</li>
    <li> Based on the reviews, I purchased this product. I live in a tropical country, but have dry skin. Foundation is too heavy, so I like to use tinted moisturizers with sunscreen for my everyday use. When I applied this product, I found it not only stained my hands, my skin was orangey and looked streaked. I have never had that experience with any other tinted moisturizer. When I wash my face, the product stains my washcloths. Consequently, I was very disappointed in the product. I used it occasionally under my foundation, but I wasn&#x27;t too pleased with that either. I finally just threw it away.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for years  and love it. It does what it claims to do and last most of the day.&lt;br /&gt;While I love the product I am a bit concerned about Amazon&#x27;s pricing. this product had been priced aroun $18-19 dollars. this past purchase was $36.00.&lt;br /&gt;Probably my last purchase for this product from Amazon</li>
    <li> I really love Loreal Age Perfect Pro-Calcium Radiance!  I have used this for years and was dissapointed when it was no longer available in stores.</li>
    <li> Used this for several years while living in Florida.  Have been unable to find it and its made me move on to other products.</li>
    <li> I am very happy that there is still some out there!!! I was so sorry to see them take it off the shelves, it is exactally what I love for a tanned look without being too heavy.</li>
    <li> The color is definitely darker than the previously purchased tint moisturizer - yet it is the same name - medium shade.  Tried to write to the seller about this, but explanation (which did not make sense to me) left me just keeping this overly priced product in the wrong shade, with the correct writing on the bottle.</li>
    <li> I inadvertently ordered a medium tone. I take light/fair. I did not see the selection and accidently received medium. I returned the product with the understanding I would receive the one I wanted in an exchange. Did not hear from this vendor regarding an exchange. They did e-mail and said it was my fault which I acknowledged, but no exchange.</li>
    <li> I think this item is wonderful, I love the way it make my skin feel, I will continue to use it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m sorry it is no longer sold in stores, it is the only thing I use, my face looks healthy and like I am not wearing anything at all, but it hides all the imperfections!</li>
    <li> I bought this cause the moisturizer and I was hoping that it will look like the liquid makeup,I have light skin and this made my skin look dark,unnatural and oily look.didn t notice any different when I put it on.not sure what it supposed to do,but maybe there are different tint colors and I bought the wrong tint??</li>
    <li> This is the greatest moisturizer. It gives a warm luminous glow to your skin very different from the matte masque created by most foundations  it evens skin tone but probably would not cover large imperfection as it is so light. It has SPF  I have been using it for years and can find nothing that comes close to it</li>
    <li> I love this product and buy it all the time. It helps cover up imperfect skin tones and has a good tint to match my skin so I don&#x27;t always have to wear liquid foundation and it also makes my skin soft &amp; moisturized.</li>
    <li> i use this product for many years,was able to buy it in the store, but now have to go to amazon, wich is more expensive.&lt;br /&gt;the light is always on sale or a good deal if you buy more, wish they did that with the medium as well.&lt;br /&gt;the product itself is the best,covers even and gives my face a glow.thank you hannelore.</li>
