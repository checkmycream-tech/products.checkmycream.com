<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> this gives my self-manicures a longer life between them.  Using it as base coat makes my polish last a few days longer than without it.  it also helps strengthen my paper-thin nails</li>
    <li> My nails grew so long because of this. Ppl think my nails are fake because of this! This stuff really works! I buy this stuff all the time. I do my own nails and this treatment is by far the best I&#x27;ve ever used!!!</li>
    <li> I have been using Nailteks for years, and, as long as I used a strong maximum strength, it always exceeded my expectations.  But, not so this time. My nails are like paper, breaking deep into the quick.  I can&#x27;t understand why.  Does the formula change when purchased online?</li>
    <li> A great piece of office equipment</li>
    <li> This product works great my nails r stronger I use it about once&lt;br /&gt;A week I would recommend this if you have weak nails.</li>
    <li> I bought this in target for like 3 bucks because it was on clearance and it was the last one. Thank god I bought because it works fantastic. I use it as a base coat and it still works it&#x27;s magic. It took my nails at least a month but it was well worth the wait. My nails are thicker, stronger, and harder and also, my manicure lasts up to about a week now. Trust me, it works. I use to wear acrylic nails all the time and it made my nail beds extremely soft and week but now, they&#x27;re stronger than they were before I got into acrylic nails. Very happy customer. Just wish they made a big bottle so I can just refill the little one.</li>
    <li> I never really thought it would help, but it is!</li>
    <li> used it in the past and it really helped. haven&#x27;t used it long enough to see results.</li>
    <li> No more splitting nails. It does get tedious to reapply everyday but once my nails stopped splitting I don&#x27;t have to reapply as often. Worked better than China Glaze&#x27;s Nail strengthener and growth formula - at least for my nails.</li>
    <li> I have impossible nails but the original NailTek has been helping some so when I saw a higher strength top coat offered I jumped right on it. Just started using it &amp; will update in a couple of weeks.</li>
    <li> This stuff is amazing. I recently decided to remove my acrylic nails and try to grow my own. I&#x27;m surprised at how quickly the damage from the acrylics is healing. Thank you! Will repurchase.</li>
    <li> This is a mainstay in my nail routine. It lasts for days  and keeps my nails from peeling.</li>
    <li> My nails grow super fast when I use this over a base coat of NailTek&#x27;s ridge filler. It is both shiny and durable. I apply a coat every two days. Makes it so my nails hardly ever chip.</li>
    <li> Have used this product for a couple of years..really works well !!!</li>
    <li> Great nail protector.</li>
    <li> Have used Nail Tek for years.  My nails look better than any acrylic nails I have seen. They have different formulas so you can choose the right one for your needs</li>
    <li> Perfect quality. Really helps nails &amp; easily visible only after 24hrs. I love it. Price awesome!!!! Hardens nails remarkably, beyond one&#x27;s imagination.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t had any success with this product. Maybe because I am a server and wash my hands a million times a day? I&#x27;ve put it in for months and don&#x27;t see a change in nail length or strength. :(</li>
    <li> This product has saved my nails after having acrylic nails for a few months.</li>
    <li> I had artificial nails on for over town years-you know what that means? After removing them my nails were so flimsy that you could literally bend them over! It was disgusting! (I will never get those again!) I searched long and hard-spending plenty of $$ in the meantime for something that could help me grow them out and protect these poor abused nails. This &#x27;Nail Tek Xtra Strength Formula Nail Strengthener&#x27; works miracles! I followed the directions exactly! Apply twwo coats, the apply daily for a week, remove, then repeat. All my nails (Except one which I apparently damaged for good with those artificial nails…) are now hard as a rock! WOW! And I am addicted! This gives a nice shine to my nails, which I like. I will continue using this from now on. Highly recommend this!</li>
    <li> Did not like as well as the II therapy, it peeled off easily</li>
    <li> I have a bad nail and this is the only clear that lasts and is the hardest. Great product to purchase.</li>
    <li> The only thing that keeps my nails from chipping and peeling. Works best if you put on a new coat daily.</li>
    <li> I can always count on nail tek when my nails get weak. I only intend to use it short term to boost my nail strength. I prefer to only use it for a short while, do to the formulation warning on the box.</li>
    <li> It peels off the same day... I do apply it to clean nails, but it just never stays. How can it strenghten if it&#x27;s gone? I decided to run an experiment and started applying it over Barielle Nail Rebuilding Protein and together, those two stay on and my nails did grow stronger.</li>
    <li> This nail strengthener is great!  I had my acrylic nails taken off and found my nails very thin &amp; weak.  NailTek is really helping them.  Polish stays on and doesn&#x27;t chip.  Very fast delivery as well.  Great product!!</li>
    <li> I have never been able to have nails before.  They always break and crack and split.  After 3 weeks of using Nail Tek they are hard, and I have not broken one in that time.  I would definitely recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Working so far  :)  Thanks!</li>
    <li> It took about 2 weeks for me to notice a difference, but it was well worth it.  Apply it every day for as long as you can stand it and even wear it as base if you have to under regular nail polish.  It&#x27;s helped my thin and bendy nails become stronger again.</li>
    <li> At first, I wasn&#x27;t sure if this was the real deal.  Well after using it for just one week, my nails are growing like a weed!!</li>
    <li> I used this product as I grew out my acrylic nails... wonderful! I have used it now for 8 months and have both my grown daughters using it! Strong healthy nails is what you get using this product!!</li>
    <li> My nail technician recommended it and it truly is helping to repair my damaged nails</li>
    <li> i first started using not this EXACT formulation but the \\&quot;Nail Tek I Maintenance Plus.\\&quot; b/c i saw a friend who had literally 1 inch long nails and i was in awe! i was a down and dirty nail biter to the point of my nails were infected and falling off *ew i can&#x27;t believe i admitted that..* i was so upset my friend, a mother of 3 boys who often play fought with her, and played foot ball and soccer, and softball with her...and on top of that she was a secretary for a dr&#x27;s office..who TYPED!!...so i asked for her review...she simply said \\&quot;ORDER A BOTTLE!!! if you dont like it after 2 weeks i&#x27;ll buy that bottle half used full price from you im&#x27; that confident in it!...\\&quot; i did just that..i ordered a bottle..and the nail file...tryed it for 2 weeks...and was well into becoming addicted to it i actually had some fingernails...not long cat claws like her...but!...my nails were growing out..little by little..2 weeks after that..i actually had some thing that was SOOOO close to peaking over the edge of my nail bed!...so i was hooked...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i can say proudly my nails are amazing...not cat claws like her...i didn&#x27;t want that much but it has been 6 years i&#x27;ve been using it..i use it for my quarterly self pampering months where i&#x27;ll use it for 3 months and thats all i need to keep my nails long and strong all year ...i do occasionally bite a nail off out of sheer anxiety or stress..yes down to the nail bed...but i pamper that particular nail for a week or so and it grows back a little faster than what it would if i just let it grow at its own pace..along with cuticle pushing and taking clacium..i&#x27;ve gone through...my best guess...10 bottles of this stuff in the 6 years i&#x27;ve been using it..and just ordered 3 more which should hold me until my \\&quot;dry season\\&quot; this winter when my naisl get sooo bad!....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i can&#x27;t believe this stuff isn&#x27;t sold in salons!..but then again who would want to sell the \\&quot;miracle\\&quot; to end gross stubby nails..when they can charge you to have a wholeset of acrylics b/c you can&#x27;t grow your own gorgeous nails! HAH!! i&#x27;ve converted at least 3 ppl out of acrylics and into nail tek..all still happily using it..including my mother and older sister...easy enough to xmas shop for them!!</li>
    <li> My sister started using this product and within 3 weeks you could see a real difference in her nails! I would reccommend this to anyone that has paper thin nails!</li>
    <li> I am still using the product. It dries fast and I use it as recommended. You get a lot for your bucks!!!!!</li>
    <li> A friend told me about this product which I thought I would try. The final realization is I had to clip my nails way down due to the nail catching on something and chipping. I have never had strong and long nails due to biting them. I will try this product again now that my nails are all clipped down with no snags to ruin them becoming stronger.</li>
    <li> My nails are now stronger and longer</li>
    <li> Nail tech was great.  My sister in law suggested it and I am happy I tried it.  Love, love, love it!</li>
    <li> Finally - I have nails!  I have the world&#x27;s weakest - splittiest nails - but this stuff is magic!  No need for acrylics or gels with NailTek!</li>
    <li> NAIL TEK PRODUCTS STRENGTHENED MY NAILS THAT ARE  WEAK &amp; SPLITTING DUE TO MANY YEARS OF WEARING ACRYLIC/GEL. I NOW HAVE HEALTHY, LONG &amp; BEAUTIFUL NATURAL NAILS.  ADDED BONUS-POLISH NEVER CHIPS OR FADES.</li>
    <li> This is the best product I have ever used on my nails. I can not believe they have grown out and I now have beautiful long nails.  Stays on longer than any other product I have used.</li>
    <li> This really works if you keep applying daily, per instructions.  My nails were dry, brittle and thin from the winter weather.  I had use this before and decided go back to this routine!  Now my nails are active length and strong!  Try it!</li>
    <li> I love this product. It makes my nails study and they grow. It is the only product I have used that increases sturdy nail growth.</li>
    <li> Sally Hansen &amp;#34;hard as nails&amp;#34; is cheaper and better, it gives your nails a harder finish. Nail Tek has formeldehyde and toulene in it and I am allergic to both.</li>
    <li> when my wife used it she could not believe how good it was she said this was the best nail hardener she has ever tried and also said she would never used anything else but this product good job</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this for quite some time. Hate when I run out. Makes my nails really hard. Does not chip or peel. I actually have to remove it with polish remover. Luuuuuuuuv it!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> This stuff is really amazing. I&#x27;ve been using it on my toenails for a month, and it has made a world of difference. Before my nails were dry and on the verge of cracking. That no longer a problem. The only down side is this will make your nails shimmer, and look like you clear coated them. However, the pros outweigh the cons.</li>
    <li> The nail Tek XTRa work great as long as I use it regularly.</li>
    <li> I had worked at a nail salon for years which sold this product but I had never tried it myself as I used to wear nail extensions. I decided to buy a bottle after some clients stated it was very good, so I use it on my toe nails. Wow!! within a few weeks (less than a month) my big toe nails began to hurt in my shoes as my nails were beginning to grow very long and strong. I decided to remove my fake nails on my hands and use Nail Tek to see if it would work on my finger nails. I am so glad I did this because now my nails have completely recovered from the drill damaged done from fake nail applications and are beautiful. They are long, strong and seem to be thicker. I wash my hands a lot due to my job and they withstand that too. It takes a few weeks for nails to strengthen up as they have to grow off the damaged nail bed from matrix to free edge, but trust me, stick with it, use it at least twice a week at bed times and don&#x27;t forget, because it won&#x27;t work if you miss treatments then you&#x27;ll blame the product for not working. Clean your nails with plain acetone first (yes this is very drying but it makes your nails oil free so that the nail tek doesn&#x27;t peel off). Once the Nail Tek has dried, apply solar oil or almond to your nails to replace lost moisture. It will work, be patient. I have not dreamed of wearing fake nails since.</li>
    <li> My nails seem to be better</li>
    <li> excellent and fast service. my wife likes the quality and the color and there is fight between her and my girls as whose it belongs to!</li>
    <li> Good overall nail product; dries quickly.</li>
    <li> I tried this Nail Tek and it doesn&#x27;t work as well as the Nailitques. It leaves a dull finish on your nails and doesn&#x27;t seem to keep your nails strong even after using it for months.</li>
    <li> I have been using this for some time now and it has really made a difference in the strength of my nails</li>
    <li> Best thing I&#x27;ve ever used to strengthen my nails. Quick delivery. Will definitely order again!</li>
    <li> Not as good as I thought</li>
    <li> I have had soft peeling nails my whole life.  Very frustrating.  Over the years I have tried many &amp;#34;remedies&amp;#34;.  However, I now have long hard nails thanks to the Nail Tek EXTRA.  I apply it as a base coat under my polish.  This is the first product that has made any difference.  Definitely a five star.</li>
    <li> I received Nail Tec Unsalvageable Nails and was told it was the same as Strength formula strengthener even though it has a different description and price</li>
    <li> Works great if you consistently use it</li>
    <li> My nails are soft, weak, peel and split. I have tried many products, but Nail Tek Xtra Maxiumu Strength Formula Nail Strengthener does the job with very good results. However, the warning label does say that the product should be used in a ventilated area, so I try to put it on outside or when near an open window.</li>
    <li> love this nail treatment, keeps my nails hard and since i&#x27;ve been using it they&#x27;ve grown alot longer and stronger.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used two coats on my nails every few days or so or when I see I need a retouch. So far, it seems to be working. My flimsy nails have become stronger and more durable.</li>
    <li> I guess I missed the part that there is another product that has to be used first.  On its own, this does not work at all.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used it before and it was great and it&#x27;s still the best for my nails.</li>
    <li> If you have nail damage from using artificial nails, this is the best stuff out there!&lt;br /&gt;My nails were extremely thin and soft from removing the acrylics that I was unhappy with, and these give &amp;#34;strength&amp;#34; to your weak nails so that they don&#x27;t break as easily.  This is my go to for weak nails, I will never use a different brand because the times I have tried other ones, it&#x27;s been a waste of money and just leads me back to this one!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good base coat. Did&#x27;nt notice anything amaznig</li>
    <li> Keeps my nails from breaking</li>
    <li> DOING GREAT SO FAR, HAVEN&#x27;T BEEN USING IT THAT LONG</li>
