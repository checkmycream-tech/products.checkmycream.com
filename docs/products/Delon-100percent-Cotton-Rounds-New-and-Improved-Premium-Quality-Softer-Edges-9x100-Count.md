      <li>I loved these when I bought them from Costco several years ago, and they are still incredible.</li>
      <li>It doens&#x27;t leave the lint on the face, the pads are smooth, and it really is the best product.  </li>
      <li>I am so happy I can now buy them at Amazon.1 large box</li>
      <li>I like them much better than cotton balls because for one thing they leave no lint.</li>
      <li>u will love it a lot.   </li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using these cotton pads for years, but they are no longer lint free as the package says!  </li>
      <li>To their credit, after I contacted them regarding the delay, they magically showed up.</li>
      <li>Have tried a lot of brands and these are definitely the best.  </li>
      <li>They are great an very absorbent.</li>
      <li>I have bought every &amp;#34;type&amp;#34; available at Walgreens, but none are as nice as these.  </li>
      <li>seller had stated in an email to me : \\&quot;I&#x27;m glad to hear Amazon was able to help you on your return.</li>
      <li>:)</li>
      <li>I wish I could purchase them in more places, but glad I found them on Amazon.com.  </li>
      <li>Perfect for facial or nail use.</li>
      <li>I love this product and couldn&#x27;t imagine finding another brand.  </li>
      <li>Sometimes it&#x27;s available at Costco, but more often NOT.  </li>
      <li>Used to be available at Costco but not any more.</li>
      <li>In fact, all of the cottony layers easily peel off b/c they aren&#x27;t sealed around the edges.</li>
      <li>So it&#x27;s easy to use.</li>
      <li>They are also easy to pack, though they are long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>doesn&#x27;t leave lint and the edges are super soft, don&#x27;t scratch, and do a great job of cleaning the face.</li>
      <li>use the cotton rounds every morning and night, primarily for wiping my face with witch hazel.</li>
      <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am totally happy with both these brands and will nit have to look any further.  </li>
      <li>This product is the best cotton round you can find.  </li>
      <li>I placed the order in end of June because it looked softer and I was excited.</li>
      <li>I love shopping/buying at Amazon, but this isn&#x27;t the first time I&#x27;ve encountered \\&quot;sins of omission.\\</li>
      <li>They are very crucial in getting good results with my skin.</li>
      <li>i love this product so much.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not sure why people give this product less than 5 stars, when it&#x27;s a great great product!</li>
      <li>The large box fits easily under the sink, the individual packages of rounds are easy to store on the counter, in the mirror-cupboard, or on the sink top.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
      <li>That aside, they are awesome in every other way and the lint is not that big of a deal to me, but it might be for someone else.</li>
      <li>These did not come in the box as above, but as separate rolls in a bag - that&#x27;s fine, but the cotton rounds have a netted exfoliating side that easily peels off.</li>
      <li>Like other reviewers, I was happy to read that these rounds are soft.  </li>
      <li>The edges aren&#x27;t the softest but most DEFINITELY tolerable!</li>
      <li>I think they sell these per bag (under 3bucks), so you can try it first and buy this,</li>
      <li>you want an even higher quality (no lint at all) then check out  Delon</li>
      <li>so for the first time ever using this product we had to repackage the rounds</li>
      <li>I just tried these for the first time today.</li>
      <li>The image on the page has star embossed pads, which are made in Germany, which are very durable and completely lint free.</li>
      <li>Only question is that the seller showed the cotton rounds coming in a Delon box for easy storage.  </li>
      <li>Pure Performance.&lt;br</li>
      <li>My wife really likes these for make-up.  </li>
      <li>Very absorbent and do not fall apart when used.</li>
      <li>These cotton rounds are fantastic for your beauty needs, such as nail polish removal and applying toner-type products to your face.  </li>
      <li>&quot; For example, shop for pricey designer handbags and very seldom will you see sizing info, i.e. Length x Height x Depth.  </li>
      <li>the picture is very misleading/erroneous if that is the case.</li>
      <li>Over the years, without giving it much thought, I have always purchased 3\\&quot; cotton rounds.  </li>
      <li>Reasonable price.</li>
      <li>They are thinner, do not hold as much liquid and are floppy when trying to use them.</li>
      <li>I liked using Delon plain cotton</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m used to much thinner cotton rounds, but I decided on this package because the price is so much better than a lot of other options on Amazon.</li>
      <li>They have a very soft side and a slightly rougher side, which offers more choice in how I want to clean my face or go at some nail polish.  </li>
      <li>The pads are not strong at all, they separate very easily.</li>
      <li>They are much softer &amp; hold together a little bit better.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s soft and clean--not like those cheap stuff from the local markets.</li>
      <li>They are premium cotton rounds and are very soft and hold up very well.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Very well made and high quality.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend them.</li>
      <li>This cotton round is just OK.  </li>
      <li>The Berkley brand is close to the same cost after factoring in shipping but in my opinion well worth it.  </li>
      <li>From the picture, I zoomed in to make sure it was the cotton round I was looking for and explicitly ordered it for that reason.</li>
      <li>Even better, because they are thicker, I can use both sides of each round (giving me x2</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I just returned this product because it was not as pictured or described on the website. The rounds did not have the star on one side, as previously purchased ones did from Costco. Also, they were to contain Aloe vera and provitamin B5, which was not indicated. As much as I liked this product in the past, I will not purchase it again if it can not be verified as to what will actually be received.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using these cotton pads for years, but they are no longer lint free as the package says!  I&#x27;m surprised no one else has mentioned this.  When I take them out of the plastic sleeve to fill my jar, lint flies everywhere!  That aside, they are awesome in every other way and the lint is not that big of a deal to me, but it might be for someone else.</li>
    <li> A very good product.  A bit overpriced but I couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere else any cheaper.</li>
    <li> These are the best cotton rounds I have ever used! Being a Senior Citizen, I have used plenty - all of the females in my family now use them.  Please bring them back!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m used to much thinner cotton rounds, but I decided on this package because the price is so much better than a lot of other options on Amazon. 9 packets of 100 rounds for $30 means 3¢ a round. Even better, because they are thicker, I can use both sides of each round (giving me x2 the value).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The packaging is convenient. The large box fits easily under the sink, the individual packages of rounds are easy to store on the counter, in the mirror-cupboard, or on the sink top. They are also easy to pack, though they are long.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I use the cotton rounds every morning and night, primarily for wiping my face with witch hazel. They are very soft on my face, and each time I pluck one out of the package it&#x27;s like stroking a feather for a brief moment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s the little things that can make your day!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve purchased this out on a limb from Costco few years ago. AND it is by far the best cotton rounds in THE WORLD! I use approximately 3 a day, not including the times I use it to erase my nail polish. Today, I realized I was running low, so went to Costco to re-stock, and SHOCKED to find out they no longer carry them!  The box lasted me approximately 2 years. It really is the best cotton rounds. It doens&#x27;t leave the lint on the face, the pads are smooth, and it really is the best product.  Sephora, Walmart, Target, etc... I think they sell these per bag (under 3bucks), so you can try it first and buy this, but I&#x27;d just buy the box. it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately, the new and improved version falls apart too annoyingly easily. &amp;#34;Rough&amp;#34; side separates from the rest of the round unless you rub gingerly.</li>
    <li> I have been sick with worry about not being able to buy Delon cotton rounds at my costco where i first found them.They are very crucial in getting good results with my skin.I am so happy I can now buy them at Amazon.1 large box lasted me 4 years so i did not think about needing them until I ran out .Oh my Gosh since not using them the last year my skin has suffered.I am so Happy I found them at amazon.Now besides buying books I can support my skin with Delon Cotton Pads!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> i love this product so much. never hesitate to buy this. u will love it a lot.   it&#x27;s soft and clean--not like those cheap stuff from the local markets.</li>
    <li> Very pleased with my purchase.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t get what  I expected  I got a lower quality product  and not what it show on the catalog</li>
    <li> LOVE these cotton rounds!  Use them every night to remove eye and facial makeup.  The soft edges really are much softer than other brands and they don&#x27;t tear apart or separate.  I am particular about what products I use and have tried other premium cotton rounds and squares.  I have found that the Delon+ Premium Cotton Rounds are THE BEST!  Wish COSTCO  Warehouse carried them!</li>
    <li> Great product ... my wife swears by it ... best on the market. Question, why is it so hard to find it? Use to be at Costco, now scare.</li>
    <li> Over the years, without giving it much thought, I have always purchased 3\\&quot; cotton rounds.  I never consciously noted that they came in a smaller size.  Recently, the store brands are bumpy and rough feeling.  Like other reviewers, I was happy to read that these rounds are soft.  NOWHERE on the product description page was the size mentioned, nor did I see that info, vital to me, in a single review.    I just wasted $25 on 900 tiny TWO INCH cotton rounds, for which I have practically no use.  I love shopping/buying at Amazon, but this isn&#x27;t the first time I&#x27;ve encountered \\&quot;sins of omission.\\&quot; For example, shop for pricey designer handbags and very seldom will you see sizing info, i.e. Length x Height x Depth.  What woman doesn&#x27;t want to know that?  So. congrats Amazon - you just succeeded in another round of \\&quot;Gotcha.\\&quot;</li>
    <li> doesn&#x27;t leave lint and the edges are super soft, don&#x27;t scratch, and do a great job of cleaning the face.</li>
    <li> I am not getting the product posted on the web.  What I am getting my wife won&#x27;t use.</li>
    <li> This product is the best cotton round you can find.  Sometimes it&#x27;s available at Costco, but more often NOT.  So I searched for it on line and found it here.  Thank you Amazon for having it.  Now I&#x27;m good to go for many years.</li>
    <li> The order arrived on time, but when we opened it we found the wrapping around several packages of the cotton rounds had split and that when you picked up the package to use, the cotton rounds tumbled to the floor..so for the first time ever using this product we had to repackage the rounds ourseles in Ziplock bags. We have absolutely no idea what happened to the individual packaging..cut by a packing knife, perhaps? Next time out (and it will be a while), we hope that Costco is carrying the product - as they do off and on.</li>
    <li> I find it difficult to find cotton rounds that do not break apart as I am using them, or do not deposit lint everywhere.&lt;br /&gt;Well, these are an excellent choice of rounds that will not break apart as you use them.&lt;br /&gt;If you want an even higher quality (no lint at all) then check out  Delon Pure Performance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am totally happy with both these brands and will nit have to look any further.  I use them to out toner on my face so I need the good quality.</li>
    <li> I just received these and they were the rounds that have 1 soft side, 1 exfoliating side, with no star pattern and they were not in the big box but were 9 loose packages in a giant clear plastic bag.  I am returning since I want the ones with 2 soft sides, star-like pattern on the rounds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;12/18 update:  just received a re-order after returning this and ordering again.  Thank you Amazon for making the return easy!  seller had stated in an email to me : \\&quot;I&#x27;m glad to hear Amazon was able to help you on your return. I&#x27;m only assuming that what you received was an picking error by Amazon when they went to ship your item.\\&quot;.  However, the new shipment I received is exactly the same as the last one, 9 loose sleeves in a clear plastic bag and each round has 1 soft and 1 exfoliate side, with no star pattern on the rounds.  Sigh, returning again. I don&#x27;t know where the error is but the picture/description needs to be updated if the item I have been receiving is indeed what was intended. the picture is very misleading/erroneous if that is the case.</li>
    <li> I just tried these for the first time today. Bought them at Costco for $12.99/900. I like them much better than cotton balls because for one thing they leave no lint. And they do the job.</li>
    <li> These cotton rounds are fantastic for your beauty needs, such as nail polish removal and applying toner-type products to your face.  They are soft- but do not shred and fall apart and leave fibers all over your skin- like Swisspers and other cotton rounds do.  I wish I could purchase them in more places, but glad I found them on Amazon.com.  :)</li>
    <li> The item shown in the picture is not what I received. The picture shows cotton rounds that have a flower pattern of sorts etched into the center of each pad. That is what I expected as those don&#x27;t break down during use. I am not happy at all.</li>
    <li> These cotton rounds may be new but they are not improved. They are thinner, do not hold as much liquid and are floppy when trying to use them. I am</li>
    <li> Different from what&#x27;s advertised. The image on the page has star embossed pads, which are made in Germany, which are very durable and completely lint free. What I received were linty, Canadian made, and with no star image on the pads. And it didn&#x27;t come in a Delon+ box as advertised either, just a bunch of plastic bags in a shipping box.&lt;br /&gt;The seller refunded my money. But unless the seller changed the product to match the actual advertised image, then it&#x27;s still false advertising.</li>
    <li> it definitely is a good value.  could be a little softer, but overall not bad and I&#x27;m getting used to them.</li>
    <li> This is the best cotton pad I&#x27;ve tried. It doesn&#x27;t fall apart. It doesn&#x27;t have any lint.</li>
    <li> I go through a lot of cotton rounds.  I have bought every &amp;#34;type&amp;#34; available at Walgreens, but none are as nice as these.  These are closed around the edge, so they don&#x27;t pull apart, and you always know that you are grabbing one and not two.  They have a very soft side and a slightly rougher side, which offers more choice in how I want to clean my face or go at some nail polish.  Great product!</li>
    <li> The cotton rounds I received are not the same as shown in the picture - they don&#x27;t have that flower pattern. They are smooth on one side, and textured on the other. The pads are not strong at all, they separate very easily. The textured side is very rough. Moreover, their edges are extremely sharp - I cut the skin under my eyes several times when I tried using them under my eyes when applying toner. Horrible quality.</li>
    <li> My wife really likes these for make-up.  Only question is that the seller showed the cotton rounds coming in a Delon box for easy storage.  Instead they came individually in ziplock bags containing 9 individual packages.</li>
    <li> I order this cotton Rounds and pay for $24.99 with 9x100 count.  They came with only 1x100 count in a big box.  is this a joke? bad service and not honest to what they had described on this item.</li>
    <li> Will not disintegrate.  Perfect for facial or nail use. Used to be available at Costco but not any more. Must buy online.</li>
    <li> As I am a Prime member, this order arrived in 2 business days. I have bought this Delon brand for years. I think they&#x27;re great.</li>
    <li> I have used cotton rounds before and would not use any other. Bought this one as a gift and they are happy with it also.</li>
    <li> These don&#x27;t fall apart when used with a liquid and the edges aren&#x27;t rough or sharp. They stand up to removing polish without tearing or shredding.</li>
    <li> This cotton round is just OK.  I use them to remove makeup and find them to be a bit too abrasive.  The Berkley brand is close to the same cost after factoring in shipping but in my opinion well worth it.  They are much softer &amp; hold together a little bit better.</li>
    <li> These are great quality Cotton Rounds.  Have tried a lot of brands and these are definitely the best.  They are premium cotton rounds and are very soft and hold up very well.  They do not fall apart.  Would recommend this item.  Also, great price.</li>
    <li> Probably the best quality of cotton rounds that I have ever used. It&#x27;s soft yet tough so you can even use it multiple times.</li>
    <li> I loved these when I bought them from Costco several years ago, and they are still incredible. Very absorbent and do not fall apart when used. They are also very soft and a perfect price and size. I highly recommend them.</li>
    <li> I have used these before (purchased elsewhere). They are great an very absorbent.</li>
    <li> These rounds are very good for applying toner and removing eye make up from the face.  Reasonable price. Packaging was very good.</li>
    <li> I liked using Delon plain cotton and I found this \\&quot;New and Improved Premium\\&quot; one. I placed the order in end of June because it looked softer and I was excited. After I got the package, I noticed that it was nothing different from the plain Delon cotton rounds. There was no floral-shape central pattern. I contacted to seller and I recieved an email soon. Seller said the company changed the cotton rounds and it seemed this New and Improved Premium cotton rounds no more available. It was frustrating.</li>
    <li> it is expensive and do not as describe. i order the good one, they ship the cheapest one i think</li>
    <li> I use this to apply milk of magnesia as primer. Milk of magnesia usually tears cotton rounds up and leaves residues on your face. This doesn&#x27;t. I would need 3 cotton rounds to apply the primer. With this cotton rounds you only need one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Very well made and high quality. Love!!!</li>
    <li> These are the best cotton rounds I&#x27;ve ever found. However, The Natural Health Shoppe where i purchased them from left a lot to be desired. It took almost 3 weeks to get my order. To their credit, after I contacted them regarding the delay, they magically showed up. I will continure to use this product, just not the vendor.</li>
    <li> No problem with delivery, but it is NOT the item picture.  I was looking for the Delon cotton rounds that have sealed edges and have a flower embossed on them, like in the picture above on the box.  These did not come in the box as above, but as separate rolls in a bag - that&#x27;s fine, but the cotton rounds have a netted exfoliating side that easily peels off. In fact, all of the cottony layers easily peel off b/c they aren&#x27;t sealed around the edges. They aren&#x27;t as lint-free as the other Delon cotton pads I was looking for.  From the picture, I zoomed in to make sure it was the cotton round I was looking for and explicitly ordered it for that reason. If this particular item is discontinued with Delon or the seller, they should at least update the product description picture.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure why people give this product less than 5 stars, when it&#x27;s a great great product! The edges aren&#x27;t the softest but most DEFINITELY tolerable! Any comment about them cutting your skin...disregard, please. They won&#x27;t scratch your skin up if used correctly. PLUS the textured side can be peeled off. Exactly the amount that was expected. The picture is misleading BUT the description says it&#x27;s a 300 count package. Can be used to apply daily makeup hygienically, a gentle exfoliator in the shower, and for removing makeup and applying product. Awesome product!</li>
    <li> I bought a set like this from Costco before, so i know this is really good to use. Remove nail polish, remove eye make up. It&#x27;s really good. It has 2 sided to the rounds. So it&#x27;s easy to use.</li>
    <li> I have been using this cotton rounds for 5 years now.  Costco used to sell them and it&#x27;s a steal.  I love this product and couldn&#x27;t imagine finding another brand.  I never have residue of cotton or lint coming out of this product.  Love it!!!!</li>
    <li> These are the BEST cotton rounds in the world!!!!!  Better than any brand they sell in the drugstore and beauty supply stores... trust me!  I&#x27;ve tried them all, and these are the best!  Except for the ones by Dhc Skincare... but those are too expensive.</li>
    <li> These are the best cotton rounds I&#x27;ve ever used. Period. Soft, absorbent. They don&#x27;t disintegrate when moistened. They do not irritate the delicate tissue around my eyes. More cost effective than those in the store. I&#x27;ll never go without them again.</li>
