    <li> I have really poofy, frizzy hair. This conditioner is one of the few that actually really works well for me. It actually does help smooth and soften my hair, making it easier for me to straighten my hair after drying it. This big bottle lasts me quite a while, too.</li>
    <li> Expensive but wonderful stuff!!!</li>
    <li> Great deal, excellent product, valued Seller, highly recommended A++</li>
    <li> I HAVE THE SOFTEST HAIR AROUND.</li>
    <li> Leaves my hair soft and it has a light consistency so it rinses off easily.  i have wavy hair and this product give them definition. I love it!</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t have great hair, however, this conditioner makes my hair soft &amp; controllable.  It has a nice scent.  It doesn&#x27;t pay to buy the small bottle, because it&#x27;s pricey.  I bought the large one and it&#x27;s about 1/2 the price</li>
    <li> This is the ONLY conditioner that I find works and doesn&#x27;t leave a slimy feel to my hair. My hair stylist recommended it over a decade ago and I&#x27;ve never wanted to try another product because it&#x27;s so good. I was excited to find a pump included for such a large bottle (34 oz.). Some sites and sellers actually charged extra for the pump!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very happy with the change in my hair since starting this conditioner. My bottle arrived one day after the projected day of arrival, but that was o.k., I still had some of my previous purchase to use.</li>
    <li> I love this product, but it is just so expensive at the salons.  This was a perfect way to purchase it and I will definitely do it again when I run out.</li>
    <li> Tames frizzy thick hair. Use too much and hair can be flat, but mine is so well controlled with this product. I have used everything from Moroccan oil shampoo to Pureology. This is the best!</li>
    <li> This is my favorite conditioner. It&#x27;s lightweight and smells amazing. Kerestase products are the best in my opinion. I use this all the time and can&#x27;t find this size anywhere else.</li>
    <li> My hair is curly and tends to get frizzy in the summer. This product helps a lot. I bought it in a large bottle because I use it every time I wash my hair. It&#x27;s expensive -- though a bottle like this will last a long while.</li>
    <li> This is a nice conditioner - maybe too pricey. I read reviews on a pump you could purchase separately and decided to get creative. I took a pump from an empty bottle of body lotion, cleaned it thoroughly and snipped off the end so it would fir. It screwed on just like it was made for this bottle and works like a charm. The lotion did not cost as much as the pump so I will now start saving lotion pumps for the large bottles of shampoo.</li>
    <li> The best,and proffesional use them!</li>
    <li> Bottle cap was leaking.  Not much, but any leakage sucks with such an expensive product.</li>
    <li> I am a long time Pureology user and recently decided I needed to try something new. I found this conditioner through a Pureology product review. I wasn&#x27;t thinking clearly when I ordered it, was thinking it was less expensive than Pureology but it&#x27;s actually not since I was comparing it to a shampoo AND conditioner set. I have to say, I&#x27;m seriously impressed and am glad I made the mistake of spending so much on good conditioner! I am still using my old shampoo because I don&#x27;t go through it very fast. This conditioner leaves my hair silky with lass notice of split ends from years of highlighting. I just love it and plan to order the shampoo from this brand when I&#x27;m due for new shampoo. Try it, it&#x27;s amazing!</li>
    <li> Wonderful smooth conditioner! Love the big size with pump, sits in shower and is so convenient.</li>
    <li> Great product for long hair that is a bit dry!</li>
    <li> What a great conditioner. I use it about once/ week and it makes my thinning male 45 year old hair that much more vibrant, alive and full. Plenty of people have complemented when they see me after conditioning my hair. They say I look younger, thinner and rested. I am thinking of using it twice / week, but dont think that I can afford it.</li>
    <li> Use this (and the shampoo) and have used it for years.  Get the large size and it will last your for a very long time.</li>
    <li> This product was definitely a good deal for me. No surprises about the delivery estimated time and especially (and much more important) because the product that arrived here was exactly what I was expecting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The seller did everything just like promised and I will have no hesitation in buying something with him again if I get interested by any of his products.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the way, this bottle has an excelent size for saving money by buying in big quantities, so a definitely recomend it!</li>
    <li> Love this conditioner.  I have to say however, I use it on our dog, an Irish Setter, and his coat looks fantastic. Very soft and silky.</li>
    <li> Tried loads of the other conditioners before  on my hair but now i found the perfect one. Love the way it makes my hair healthy. A little expensive but i guess you cant help it if you want good quality product</li>
    <li> Unable to use product no pump included!!</li>
    <li> Use this product for a long time now and love it</li>
    <li> This is by far the best shampoo and conditioner combo I have EVER used.  It makes my hair so strong, but yet soft at the same time.  As a bonus, the conditioner has a nice, yet perfume scent.</li>
