<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Love the fresh smell!</li>
    <li> This scent is in my top 5 incense all time incense.  Has a very masculine scent.  Has sort of an aphrodisiac quality to the scent.  You&#x27;d have to smell it. Very few scents have that kind of power.</li>
    <li> great scent and a great deal for the price</li>
    <li> While not unpleasant, this doesn&#x27;t smell anything like Patchouli!</li>
    <li> I purchased this for the low price and the ratings.  Sadly the ratings fail on this.  It is not what most people would call Patchouli.  At best is a blend that includes or is based on patchouli.  I find patchouli to rich, dank, earthy, potent, musky and almost overwhelming.  This incense is bright and floral with a musky base and is likeable.  Just not what I was looking for which was plain patchouli.  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patchouli</li>
    <li> this incense brand is one of the best I have ever used, and this scent is by far my favorite.</li>
    <li> Never again will I buy HEM incense.  I find that the scents do not smell anything like what they are supposed to.  This does not smell natural and definitely does not smell anything like patchouli. Too perfumey, I gave them all away.</li>
    <li> these are the best oiled incense sticks for the price - love em!!!</li>
    <li> I bought this looking for a great value like most of us would, and well it&#x27;s not bad, but it does not smell anything like Patchouli. As an old hippie who has used Patchouli incense, oils and candles since the 1960&#x27;s this just doesn&#x27;t remind me of any Patchouli product I&#x27;ve used.   On the other hand it does have a decent enough scent, and it is a great value just don&#x27;t expect it to smell like the Patchouli most of us are used to.</li>
    <li> The scent is sweet, sensual, &amp; has an edge for both feminine &amp; masculine senses. It smells amazing!! AAAAA+++++</li>
    <li> Amazing deal, I love patchouli aroma, it stays in a room for a long time. I will definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> So much incense in the order..I got to use it more often than I would have ...lovely scent...I burned it outside as well to keep the bugs away..it works!</li>
    <li> i&#x27;m not really a big incense lover because they all seem to smell the same to me. This smell is okay but again I don&#x27;t like the smell of incense.</li>
    <li> Cheap perfumey smell.  My dogs and I had to evacuate.  Not for people who are used to normal, good quality incense.</li>
    <li> Patchouli Incense.A cold windy day.Nice fire in the woodstove.A great book.Whats missing?</li>
    <li> These are some of the best incense sticks I&#x27;ve ever used; easy to light and smell great.</li>
    <li> I love the smell! they seem to burn up a bit too quickly, but you get a bunch of them, and the smell fills the room pretty well. I&#x27;ll definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> Best incense ever. Seller is quick and consistant.</li>
    <li> before i would use nothing but nag incense.  i have switched loyalties, unless i find it has carcinogenic properties.  i absolutely embrace Patchouli by HEM.  so pleasant in my home and leaves a gentle fragrance throughout.</li>
    <li> Strong, but aromatic.</li>
    <li> Not as Patchouli smelling as I expected, just sort of has that generic incense smell.  But I like it anyway and the incense are high quality and long lasting.</li>
    <li> Was stuck on this scent for so many years.  But trying Precious Chandra and Dragons Blood have moved Pachouli down to third place.  Its still wonderfull and a lot of us old hippies still remember it fondly.</li>
    <li> All i can say is WOW...Totalllly didnt expect a big box of incense sticks, Haha...What a bargain, Defintely more than what i expected, Will buy again for sure...!!!</li>
    <li> Smells nothing like patchouli. I sent it back.</li>
    <li> Prompt delivery, great price</li>
    <li> Very good incense with a great bouquet but with a different aroma than I have been used to with patchouli. Long lasting burn, which is great.</li>
    <li> Excellent price.  You get a lot for your money.  Works Excellent as well. No problems.  Would buy this brand again</li>
    <li> This is horribly bad incense.  Nothing bad about the vendor, just a bad product.  It has been compared to &amp;#34;old lady perfume&amp;#34;.  That&#x27;s about right.  Not patchouli.  Prasad and Satya offer much better products.  Then again, it&#x27;s cheap.  It will live in the bathroom.</li>
    <li> Really these are far the best insence i purchased i luv da smell it distributes through out the home,very sweet will purchase more onced i run out...&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> This is the first time I tried the Patchouli. It took me back to my Hippy Days ( and they were good days). Very relaxing and every now and them I would get a whif of different fragences. It was very kool and I would absolutely by them again. I love the way they come so if your feeling generious you can share.Interesting but Frankensence and Myrrh is still my very favorite.</li>
    <li> The incense stick lights easily and burns well but this isn&#x27;t a true patchouli scent; it must be a blend. Still, the aroma is pleasant and the price is reasonable, so I won&#x27;t be returning it, but I probably won&#x27;t buy it again.&lt;br /&gt;I like the way that it&#x27;s packaged. The six small containers inside the large box make it easier to share some with a friend.</li>
    <li> Thick BLACK smoke when you light this. It WILL set off your smoke alarm. Nothing natural about this.  Having grown up in the 60&#x27;s I know what good incense is and this is not that!!!  Better buying incense at local gas station.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like the scent of patchouli oil, but I like patchouli incense.  This is very subtle and I have to say that I&#x27;ve had other patchouli incense varieties that have had much more of that scent.  But that&#x27;s ok, it still smells very good.  Burns slowly, and you certainly get a lot for your money.  I&#x27;m a fan now of HEM incense.</li>
    <li> EXCELLENT QUALITY INCENSE, GOOD PRICE FOR THE AMOUNT. USE FOR SELF OR GIFTS. TOO BSD IT GIVES ME A HEADACHE.</li>
    <li> this was definitely a better buy than going to the local shop and paying the same amount for one single box, as you would for the 6, do the math.</li>
    <li> Really like the brand and Patchouli is one of my favorite scents. Will be buying it again in the future.</li>
    <li> The product is prepared in great packaging for resale there are 6 smaller packages inside the box. The smell is wonderful and true to its name, a must have.</li>
    <li> I have tried almost ever HEM brand incense and love them all, but this one is ranked way low on my list; albeit still good. The problem is that it is not patchouli but very piney with a hint of musk to it. Still nice especially for the price.</li>
    <li> This scent does linger and it makes the entrance to home very pleasing.</li>
    <li> Great value and fab patchouli fragrance!</li>
    <li> I love it!!! This seller is selling the real deal! This is not patchouli with a mix of something else, its just straight up patchouli like I remember my parents burning. My 6 year old even said she loved the smell. I let it burn while we went out for dinner. This burns for about 20-30mins and the scent permeates the rooms. I woke up this a.m. and I can still smell it. I&#x27;m constantly buying my major retail candles... I think I just found my replacement and saving money too!</li>
    <li> This smells wonderful!  Don&#x27;t make the mistake I did by not thinking enough comes in one box. Plenty come in one box!  I bought this and the lavender and I prefer this one.</li>
    <li> The best Patchouli incense I&#x27;ve ever had, and I&#x27;ve had a lot!</li>
    <li> Nice scent but very strong, even in a large space.</li>
    <li> Black soot/smoke when lit.  Doesn&#x27;t last very long.</li>
    <li> Smells nice. Just have to burn 2 to smell it.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  I love the fragrance it produces in my home and this product couldn&#x27;t be better in the beautiful packaging</li>
    <li> I do think the scent is ok but it is NOT Patchouli. I partied hearty in the 60&#x27;s and 70&#x27;s and seen a hundred shows and never did any patchouli smell like this.</li>
    <li> This is the best smelling patchouli I&#x27;ve ever purchased.  The price is amazing, considering the incense shop near me charges a couple of bucks per individual pack.</li>
    <li> Sticks were thin and didn&#x27;t last.</li>
    <li> I love these and will be ordering more. Far cheaper than sprays etc and where no one ever commented on the Fabreze or any other deodorizing spray I normally use, nearly every visitor has asked where the &amp;#34;lovely smell&amp;#34; is coming from. Highy recommend</li>
    <li> like the smell,makes all the rooms come alive</li>
    <li> THE AROMA IS BEAUTIFUL AND DELICATE. IT IS MENT FOR LOVE AND PEACE. I WOULD SAY ITS AN EXCELLENT CHOICE. HOWEVER I GAVE IT 4 STARS, BECAUSE THEY WERE SO THIN AND I BURN THEM EVERY DAY SO 20 IS NOT ENOUGH. THEY JUST DON&#x27;T LAST. BUT I WILL ORDER AGAIN UNTIL I FIND A BIGGER PACK FOR ME. ENJOY</li>
    <li> They arrived on time and packed well. If you like Patchouli fragrance you&#x27;ll love this item. It burns slow.</li>
    <li> they sent me lavender instead and have no contact info to correct the mistake!!!!!!!!imm stuck with 120 sticks of lavender yuck</li>
    <li> Best deal on incense anywhere IMHO.</li>
    <li> This fragrance is pleasant and is good value for the price, but darn ....it doesn&#x27;t smell like patchouli.</li>
    <li> makes my whole house smell wonderfull, and 120 sticks for the price is a great deal. delivery was a bit slower than I had expected but well worth the wait</li>
    <li> Patchouli is mainly used , Positive vibrations, doing magic to bring forth money what ever is needed.The oil is used for happiness or for attracting an soul mate or Twin Flame.. Its sweet smelling calming incense that I am not allergic too which I am thank for...It&#x27;s not as over powering as most are.. This is doing rather well for me/ Thank You</li>
    <li> This was the 2 time I bought theses Incense . I will be back for more.</li>
    <li> High quality incense sticks. Wonderful soft patchouli smell. And great value. I will definitely be buying more when I got through all of these</li>
    <li> The scent really travels throughout the room and really smells like that Patchouli from the 60s. Ahhh, brings back memories.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I was looking for! Oh yeah, you can&#x27;t go wrong with this Patchouli, trust me. Will certainly buy more when present one is about to finish.</li>
    <li> doesn&#x27;t really smell all that much like patchouli.  Actually, the &amp;#34;forest&amp;#34;, &amp;#34;chandan&amp;#34; and &amp;#34;patchouli&amp;#34; by HEM smell (suspiciously?) almost identical.</li>
    <li> Does not smell anything like patchouli.  More of an annoying soapy smell. Yucky!!</li>
    <li> Patchouli is one of my favorites. The sticks burn very nicely. My only complaint is the black smoke that emits when you first light it. Used frequently the black smoke is not good for the ceilings. It will leave black marks. It was packaged very secure and arrived as stated.</li>
    <li> The perfect smell of Patchouli</li>
    <li> I burned a lot of this scent back in the 70&#x27;s.  This one is a pretty good match for those days.  The sticks are good size and burn for a relatively long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The shipper was prompt &amp; the package was appropriately wrapped &amp; arrived undamaged.</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my daughter who loves everything Patchouli. While to me it isn&#x27;t all that strong she says it&#x27;s perfect. She burns about two sticks every afternoon while doing her homework. She says it helps her concentrate so I will keep buying it. Although 120 sticks will mean I won&#x27;t have to repurchase for at least a few months.</li>
    <li> Love the Fragrance of patchouli</li>
    <li> the package says patchouli, but the contents are something different, not an unpleasant fragrance, but NOT PATHCHOULI.  NOT WHAT I ORDERED.</li>
    <li> Love this. I burn them in my bedroom multiple times a day.</li>
    <li> great flowery smell like a light nag champa.  smokes at the beginning, until it&#x27;s lit, then no black smoke.  leaves a great subtle &amp;#34;hippy&amp;#34; perfume scent.  not patchouli strictly speaking, but, don&#x27;t fret, smells great.  and.....there is 120 sticks!!!!!</li>
    <li> Thank you sooo... much for making shopping with you a wonderful experience. I was a little worried with some of the negative comments. I have to disagree with those people who wrote unenthusiastic remarks. Your shipping time and packing was beyond what one would expect. When I opened the package and sniffed the incense, I thought it smelled perfumy but once I lit one I was over the top excited - these incense smell fantastic! I love it, my home smells like the fantastic fragrance of patchouli. I am shocked because my 20 yr old daughter want my incense. Going forward I will be purchasing these fantastic incense ONLY from extremek. Such an unbelievable price, amazing shipping time,perfect packaging - I would suggest that you purchase from extremek and not waste your time trying to top this experience. THANK YOU extremek for being Top Notch!!!!</li>
    <li> How nice is it to clean your place get everything exactly the way you want it, and then like a cherry on the whip cream of your banana split, you light a Patchouli stick and sit back with a cup of herbal tea and enjoy the day.</li>
    <li> Smells great.  WIll purchase again.</li>
    <li> This incense smells amazing - exactly how Patcholli is supposed it. The incense burns as expected  - no smoky, sut or chalky scent. Also having 120 sticks in individual packs makes great for sharing.</li>
    <li> Beautiful scent, smells wonderful, burns for 30 minutes for sure, however is very thin.  The stick is covered with the incense but very, very thinly.  Some are a bit thicker but all are thin and this to me is a disappointment.  The seller is reliable and fast, the packaging is very fancy, colorful and nice.  I feel they should spend more money of the incense itself and less on the packaging as the incense is what I want to burn and smell not the package, packaging gets thrown out.  So if you can increase the thickness of the incense on the stick, this way is will smoke more and be much better.  It does smell great, but smokes very thinly just like the thin stick.</li>
    <li> Smells like  true patchouly</li>
    <li> love this incense, takes me back to the 60&#x27;s :-)</li>
    <li> Patchouli is my favorite incense. I was running out of it and found HEM incense on Amazon for a decent price, and that it was made in India. I am very pleased with this batch of incense.</li>
    <li> This Hem patchouli incense has a lovely refreshing scent. My husband and I enjoy this incense so we reorder it. There was a great price also, very economical.</li>
    <li> smells great - like but sultry. I burn it all the time in different rooms.</li>
    <li> The fragrance is very nice but the ash spread all over even though I put it in the large glass container.</li>
    <li> great price and great product</li>
    <li> Ashes are easy to contain; fail into incense holder and clears out easily into the trash can with one minor tap. The aroma lingers throughout home for days without lighting another.</li>
    <li> this doesn&#x27;t smell anything like patchouli to me. I have been buying patchouli for many years and this is not anything like it. It smells bad. I am throwing it out, cheaper than sending it back. Save your money.</li>
    <li> If you like patchouli incense, great product. Long lasting sticks, quick shipping. Smells great!</li>
    <li> I LOVE LOVE LOVE this patchouli!  I received this yesterday when I got off work.  I burned incense until I went to bed.  This stuff is heavenly!  I will continue to purchase this product.</li>
    <li> The delivery was fast.. Absolute bonus. I burn it every day... And when I run out I will order from the same person.</li>
    <li> fast delivery good product!!!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> I have bought several boxes of this product over th last few months. Excellent incense. The patchouli  burns and smells great. Will be ordering more in the future.</li>
    <li> I love this incense and plan to order more when my current stock runs out. I think it is the best.</li>
    <li> plenty of incense sticks without running out quickly--  first time tried this brand &amp; price and quality are excellent-- love it!</li>
    <li> Wasn&#x27;t sure if I would like this because I have smelled a lot of Patchouli that was too &amp;#34;powdery&amp;#34; smelling, but this is very nice, clean, and fresh! I would definitely recommend this fragrance.</li>
    <li> Really good incense.  Fragrant and burns evenly.  A good buy.</li>
    <li> Good quality and good, strong incense aroma.  Would buy again.</li>
    <li> It is gorgeous!&lt;br /&gt;Will be looking for more to buy.&lt;br /&gt;Got lots of compliments.</li>
    <li> Fantastic deal! These aren&#x27;t closeout or &#x27;old&#x27; incense. All of them arrived in perfect condition, with the price these can&#x27;t be beat if you&#x27;re a regular incense user. Scent is great, not overbearing. Definitely would recommend.</li>
    <li> We have ordered this twice now.  The stems are not consistent in size to fit into the holes of the decorative pepper shaker I use but that is not a negative. Would recommend it.</li>
    <li> A little smokey when lit but continues to smell great for a few days after.</li>
    <li> good, subtle smell, not too strong, love it</li>
    <li> this arrived on time and was packed well and they smells so good i love them thank you</li>
    <li> Good Patchouli smell.</li>
    <li> I will be re-ordering. Burn all the time</li>
    <li> The reason I order patchouli is I love it, this incense smells nothing like patchouli.will not order again. The reviews were misleading.</li>
    <li> Love this scent- patchouli smells amazing.</li>
    <li> This seemed like a very good value to me, and the incense smells wonderful.  Not being an expert on incense but liking wonderful smells, all I can say is it &#x27;smells great&#x27;.</li>
    <li> Theres nothing like the smell of patchouli, so unique and soothing. Just one fills the room and lasts for a very long time, will buy again.</li>
    <li> This has to be one of my favorite I love the smell so much that I could wear the sent if it were possible</li>
    <li> We have purchased this incense in the past, but have recently bought lesser-priced sticks.  Returned to this product because we find it superior to the others.  Quick and easy purchase!</li>
    <li> The scent is pleasant and they burn on average as long as any other incense.  Have purchased this before and will again.</li>
    <li> Way better than expected! VERY high quality!</li>
    <li> Bought it as a gift and they seem to use it regularly!</li>
    <li> Love this product, the smell is something that cannot be described, its a mixture of fresh air, spring, waterfalls, earth.....very nice and soft smell and very addicting. Love the packaging too cute.</li>
    <li> The aroma is very masculine, and is a male aphrodisiac that works great. It&#x27;s a musky woody yet floral aroma that is very pleasant. Feelings I get from this scent Is calm, invigorated, and (as a man) &amp;#34;interested&amp;#34;. The room just &amp;#34;feels&amp;#34; purified or cleaner somehow. As always HEM is a brand I trust as they use all natural ingredients and incense making methods as old as India. Grade A++</li>
    <li> This product does not smell like patchouli. It smells like a perfume incense. It doesn&#x27;t smell bad, but it doesn&#x27;t have that natural, earthy fragrance of patchouli. I think that the smell of an incense can go one of two ways. One direction would lead you to the realm of Nag or patchouli, the other would lead you to perfume type scents. This one goes in the direction of perfume, and NOT patchouli. Smells like chemical flowers to me. I don&#x27;t like it, and I don&#x27;t want my house to smell like it. Fortunately, I have Nag Champa on the way too. Next time I will try Satya&#x27;s Patchouli Forest.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been burning patchouli incense since 1975,and this ain&#x27;t it. This smells like old woman&#x27;s perfume, not patchouli.  My wife says it smells like laundry soap.  Try Prasad; much better.</li>
    <li> this incense is actually my favorite HEM incense. i first tried it at a pow-wow in 2008 and fell in love with the incense. i continually use it and still have half my box left</li>
    <li> Amazing scent. Everyone in my office asked me what is this amazing scent.&lt;br /&gt;I bought twice</li>
    <li> Always loved HEM incense and this one does have to true smell of Patchouli. A great scent for us Hippies!</li>
    <li> Smell is like patchouli  quality is more like cheapoli</li>
    <li> I currently have 2-120 boxes of this incense. i absolutely love it. Burn time is good and I love the smell. I tried another brand of Patchouli ,and was very disappointed. I will always buy HEM Brand Patchouli .</li>
    <li> great price,fast delievery.love this insence,great smell.good seller</li>
    <li> Nice smell while burning Doesn&#x27;t linger.</li>
    <li> This is really nice incense at a great price,not too strong or overbearing but it does the job and smells great,thanks Amazon and HEM!</li>
    <li> prompt delivery; fair price; I&#x27;m pleased</li>
    <li> This is a great incense - competitive price - arrived early and smells good; also last over an hour [[ASIN:B0016Z3BA4 Dragons Blood - 120 Sticks Box - HEM Incense]! I&#x27;ve learned to be cautious in buying Patchouli and have been disappointed in the fragrances I&#x27;ve received - This product is not too strong and not too weak and actually smells like Patchouli!</li>
    <li> I love the smell of this incense. It burns well and is a good quality incense.</li>
    <li> Have to admit the fragrance wasn&#x27;t what I was expecting. If you&#x27;re expecting it to smell more like standard patchouli oil, you&#x27;ll be disappointed. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, it doesn&#x27;t smell bad, but again it&#x27;s not what I was expecting a &#x27;patchouli&#x27; incense to smell like.</li>
    <li> very nice and great price</li>
    <li> Love this scent but be careful handling because the black will get all over.</li>
    <li> you like the smell first! 120 sticks is a lot! To put it in perspective: it&#x27;s opening a shipping box and finding several smaller boxes of incense!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I risked it! I bought this without first smelling it, but it worked out! It&#x27;s a very balanced, complimentary smelling incense. I&#x27;m still new to the patchouli fragrance and I have friend that didn&#x27;t initially recognize the smell being like pachouli. But what I can say is I burn some everyday and it has a pleasant smell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A great product from a reliable seller! My incense arrived fully packaged, intact and protected.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a great scent. It will cover most any smell you find unpleasant. I order 120 sticks, and will repeat the order in the near future.</li>
    <li> Very good deal. The sticks are thick and burn well. They never need to be re-lit. They emit a pleasant odor. Some inconsistency from one stick to the next in thickness, although I have never seen incense whose thickness was more consistent.</li>
    <li> Quite abrasive and in your face.  Thought it would be more mellow and relaxing.  To each their own.  I will not be reordering.</li>
    <li> He loves Patchouli and these sticks put off a great scent. The price is affordable. Awesome bundle size. Next time I need Patchouli I&#x27;ll purchase this product again.</li>
    <li> I love patchouli but the fragrance of this incense is absolutely not patchouli. It has a strong perfume smell which is ok if you like a flowery perfume fragrance. Maybe I&#x27;ll use it outside in the summertime...maybe. If you want patchouli then don&#x27;t waste your money. Disappointed.</li>
    <li> These sticks in particular don&#x27;t smell like the Patchouli that I&#x27;m used to, and have a little bit more of a perfume-like scent to them. It&#x27;s not too strong and overwhelming in my opinion though, and they do smell just fine otherwise.</li>
    <li> Smells AMAZING!!!!!! I love these! Totally will be buying more!!</li>
    <li> Not very pleasant when burned, either. Smells like cheap, sharp perfumes. If there&#x27;s anything oil in it, there&#x27;s not much. Better than dollar store incense though - it at least doesn&#x27;t smell like charred wood when burned.</li>
    <li> My favorite brand of Patchouli!</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t burn as consistently as some of the others.  It also has a tendency to burn out.  Aroma is very good.</li>
    <li> Excellent quality and my order came on time!</li>
    <li> This stuff has such a mellow, light perfumey patchouli smell. It&#x27;s kind of like just after a shower you can smell the fragrance of soap in the air. Best smelling incense I&#x27;ve found in a long while!</li>
    <li> Wonderful products, fast shipping</li>
    <li> The sticks burn great, smell great and are a wonderful value for the low price. I ordered another box the same day my first came we loved them so much. Will definitely be buying more in the future.</li>
    <li> Took three days to ship and two more days to be delivered.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I happened to buy this while looking for more scents to try.  I almost didn&#x27;t get it, but was convinced by a couple family members that the smell wasn&#x27;t strong like perfume.  I started up a stick and took a nap to rid myself of a 3-day sinus/tension headache.  It worked!  And I&#x27;m convinced that this incense was a big help to that..</li>
    <li> i got these for my mom for christmas. she was born in the era of the 60s and she loves them c: their really nice, not to strong or too weak.</li>
    <li> This does not smell like patchouli at all. It smells like perfume. Its not a bad fragrance, just not like the patchouli I expected.</li>
    <li> Great scent I burn 2 or 3 each day and the house smells awesome.</li>
    <li> My favorite scent and a quality product...I will be reordering this product. I have used almost all of it already. Thanks!</li>
    <li> I have Patchouli candles and loved the scent so much decided to try the incense. While the candle has as nice a smell I do not feel the need to constantly check on the incense.</li>
    <li> It is ok. It is a little perfumey for my taste and does not really smell like patchouli. I use essential oils a lot, and also burn incense in my house like crazy. This is one that I will use now because I have a ton of it, but it does not have that earthy quality I was hoping for.</li>
    <li> Ah patchouli ! Brings back Woodstock memories! I use these for air fresheners in my truck. Anytime there is a fowl smell in the air this incense takes care of it. Put one on the defroster vent and have a nice flowing aroma lasting longer than a normal car air freshener.</li>
    <li> I really love the Satya Baba patchouli incense, so I was excited to try these. Unfortunately, they were nothing like the Satya Baba and smelled really perfumey. I burned them because they are better than nothing, but I won&#x27;t get this again.</li>
    <li> Amazing and long lasting smell. I will definitely buy again.</li>
    <li> I had no idea how much 120 sticks of incense really is. That is great because it has a great scent</li>
    <li> Pretty good incense. Would purchase again</li>
    <li> I love the scent of patchouli and I love incense sticks, so these were made for me. The scent is lovely, not too overpowering, with a genuine patchouli odor. The only downside I had with this brand, which I had not tried before was that they were slightly difficult to light and sometimes went out during burning. I would buy again.</li>
    <li> used some threw rest out</li>
    <li> Loved it.  Reminds me of my old hippie days back in Cali.  Excellent product.  Will definitely buy more in the near future. Long lasting and very fragrant.</li>
    <li> Been looking for years</li>
    <li> Great product-fast shipping-product as described</li>
    <li> Nice smell, strong enough to fill the room, but not too strong. My housemate, who is usually allergic to all but really good incense, is not allergic to this.</li>
    <li> They did not resemble the odor of parchuli at all...terrible smell!!! I ordered it as a gift and it was embarrassing!!!</li>
    <li> Do I need say more, it make you relax and laugh at everything, good after a meal or having drinks.</li>
    <li> Love these. Keeps my house smelling great burn  as expected</li>
    <li> Love them, and a super bargain!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s very good product and it has nice smile</li>
    <li> I bought this a few months ago and it was exactly what I was looking for. The scent is light and it burns evenly with minimal residue. Everyone loves it. In fact, everyone loves it so much...I keep giving it away! I just ordered another box. When I travel, I like to slip one into my suitcase.</li>
    <li> Bought this item as a Mother&#x27;s Day present, she enjoyed it very much. I honestly admit it smells very good.</li>
    <li> Brings out the old hippy in me. As a baby boomer I got it mostly for nostalgic purposes just because I love the smell of patchouli, but as with all incense, it does blow black smoke into the air so I use it sparingly and use it in the bathroom so I can contain the smoke and use the exhaust fan. Smells great, burns fast but you get a lot in the box.</li>
    <li> Great bargain for quality incense.</li>
    <li> The scent of this incense is amazing. I have ordered the 6 pack twice now. Of course along with my favorite scent, Nag Champa, which is my all time favorite. This is a great deal, because these aren&#x27;t cheap imitations</li>
    <li> I love patchouli incense, they are my favorites...these are not patchouli. They have a very strong perfume smell, not unpleasant...just not patchouli.  To bad.</li>
    <li> I used to buy this at an Indian grocery but they couldn&#x27;t keep it in stock. This is great smelling Patchouli and burns well.</li>
    <li> Love,Love the Patchouli incense helps me relax after a stressful day.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a good value for the amount of incense you get in the package. While the incenses themselves doesn&#x27;t really stand out too much, it&#x27;s exactly what you expect them to be - incense with the traditional incense aroma, capable of bringing in some fresh and calm atmosphere to almost any environment you light them up in.</li>
    <li> Lots of skinny sticks that last a few minutes and has very little fragrance.,Would not recommend.</li>
    <li> not a stong enough scent.</li>
    <li> Couldn&#x27;t ask for anything better!</li>
    <li> great scent, and burns for a very long time,,,,I highly recommend this item, especially if you like aroma therapy.</li>
    <li> After reading the previous reviews I wasn&#x27;t convinced this was what I wanted, but figured it&#x27;s fairly inexpensive so I&#x27;d take a chance. After it arrived and I lit one up, I was very satisfied.  I really like the scent, my husband does also. It burns for a long time and I will be ordering more when I get low, this is my new favorite scent!</li>
    <li> It burns slowly and has a lasting scent.  It is VERY reasonably prices and one package lasts me months-- and they come nicely packaged in 6 separate cylinders so they are easy to &#x27;gift&#x27; one of them to another Patchouli lover as an  unexpected gift!</li>
    <li> Burns slow and smells great. Even days after you burn it. Reasonably priced.  I need seven more words so yeah</li>
    <li> This has become one of my favorite brands of incense as well as one of my favorite smells! Great aromatherapy and long lasting burn.</li>
    <li> This Patchouli is great. I hadn&#x27;t burned Patchouli in well over 20 years. I am glad I got this....very nice scent and like 99% of HEM incense, it burns very well and lasts 40-45 minutes. The scent don&#x27;t linger(to bad), but when its burning its simply wonderful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have bought a lot of incense here on Amazon, HEM is a great brand I recommend most of HEM&#x27;s scents. Please keep in mind.... when you first light ANY incense stick, you will have that &amp;#34;Burning wood&amp;#34; smell.....just give it 30-30 seconds, the scent you have WILL come out. A++</li>
    <li> Love them. Purchase them all the time.</li>
    <li> Terrific aroma, long-lasting, great for dispelling odors or as a relaxing aromatherapy.  This is the third time I&#x27;ve bought this brand, which speaks for its quality for me.</li>
    <li> It is incense after all but it is good incense and it is not overwhelming for those of us who recall ubiquitous patchouli of the 60s;&lt;br /&gt;Oddly enough it reminds me of the middle east souks</li>
    <li> LIKE THIS INCENSE.  NICE SMELL.  BUT, I SEAT NEXT   CLOSE TO THE OLD  PATCHOULI .  BUT NOT PATCHOULI.  I WAS HOPING FOR.   (MY CHANGE OF INE AFTER  &#x27;A LOT OF BURNING.)</li>
    <li> Such a beautiful scent. Patchoulis vary, this one is a good one, but almost doesn&#x27;t smell like patchouli, it&#x27;s a bit sweeter.</li>
    <li> Great quality for a great price!</li>
    <li> A very nice Patchouli incense... nice scent and great as gifts ... very well packaged ...you won&#x27;t be disappointed ...</li>
    <li> This is the best selling incense ever.  Buy this and see what I mean.  If you don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s the best smelling incense ever, I recommend you get a new nose.</li>
    <li> one of my favorites, Hem products are the best of all i tried!.... Sandalo and this one are my favorites</li>
    <li> I love these patchouli incense sticks.  While they are a slightly different aroma from other patchouli sticks I&#x27;ve had in the past, they are still fantastic.</li>
    <li> Love it! Great fragrance, cheap, and received it in good order.</li>
    <li> I USE THIS SCENT OF INCENSE ANYWAY, BUT WAS VERY SURPRISED AT THE AMOUNT OF INCENSE AND THE SIZE OF THE BOX FOR THE PRICE. I WAS EXTREMELY PLEASED AND WILL CERTAINLY BUY FROM THIS SELLER AGAIN</li>
    <li> These incense sticks have almost ZERO scent. The scent does not smell of pachouli at all ether. I will burn 2 at a time and you can hardly tell unless you stand close to the burner. I would never buy this brand of incense again.</li>
    <li> this is just the aweful. I thought I was saving money by ordering these in bulk. I need the insence to cover up &amp;#34;scents&amp;#34; this brand and pack or type is not that great. It smells very good but it doenst produce the smoke and powerful scent that I&#x27;m looking for.</li>
    <li> Did not smell like patchouli. Ugh. Sorry I bought it.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m am not very good at describing the scent but I really love it. The reason I give 5 stars is because HEW has always sent good quality incense and they burn for much longer than other brands ive tried out.</li>
    <li> good product and very nice packing</li>
    <li> Way more pungent than Nag Champa, and more smokey, but it&#x27;s a nice aroma and I just burn half a stick at a time. I&#x27;m not disappointed, but this wasn&#x27;t exactly wheat I&#x27;d hoped for.</li>
</ol>
