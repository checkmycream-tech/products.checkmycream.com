      <li>I think there are better products out there that won&#x27;t turn your face red.</li>

      <li>And when they find out the truth every last one wants to know what I use on my skin.</li>
      <li>People even drs think I&#x27;m early 40s..</li>
      <li>At 37 years old, I have always had some acne.  </li>
      <li>To elimante this problem for me, I usually follow up the toner with an oil free moisturizer.</li>
      <li>The only toner that helps to clear up my breakouts....</li>
      <li>Also, the bottle seems to be a little leak-prone, so make sure the lid is screwed on tight.</li>
      <li>In spite of the rather high 10% glycolic acid content, it does not dry my skin so long as I apply it only to acne-prone areas.</li>
      <li>I have not had a single new pimple pop up since I started using this about 1 1/2 months ago.</li>
      <li>I have sensitive acneic skin with oily tzone and occasional dry spots.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Love this toner!  It helps keep my pores clear and my skin looks amazing.</li>
    <li> Burned my skin. Too harsh for me</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s ok we&#x27;ll see in a couple of months</li>
    <li> Great product. Never will go without. I use it as a daily toner after washing my face/neck. It keeps my pores from clogging and skin fresh looking. You may want to start out a few times a week until your skin gets used to it.</li>
    <li> I have used this line in the past and have an exfoliating scrub I really love. This toner, however, burned my skin everytime I tried to use it. I have combination skin that is not particularly sensitive, but this toner was so painful I had to splash cold water on my face. It is now sitting under my sink where it will remain for eternity.</li>
    <li> Works as good or better than expensive department store products, plus a larger bottle than the pricier products. Will purchase again.</li>
    <li> Product was very harsh on my skin. I&#x27;m African American with combination skin. I thought this was the answer, but after using it for a week I got such bad burns. I tried to return it and the seller refunded me right away. I won&#x27;t buy this product again. I&#x27;m also returning all the products from this line.</li>
    <li> I was hoping this would be a good substitute for my long time favorite DDF and I&#x27;m happy to report that it is. I have sensitive acneic skin with oily tzone and occasional dry spots. It doesn&#x27;t burn or irritate but is highly effective. My skin is more even toned and brighter. Acne scarring (old and new) are gone. People don&#x27;t believe I ever had an acne problem.</li>
    <li> The seal was broken on this product and it appears like a rip off.  I was not comfortable using it and returned the product.</li>
    <li> this stuff is really good. I&#x27;ve only had it for 3 days, and I saw results immediately. I have terrible acne scarring, and this has already started to help with lightening those scars along with the other products I use. it&#x27;s also helping with making my face as soft as a baby&#x27;s butt! I heard this was discontinued, but I will have to stock up before it&#x27;s all gone. I received this on schedule. I will have to mention that it burns some, and you are supposed to allow it to work for a few minutes before adding moisturizer. really sensitive folks may find it hard to wait, but you will still see results anyway.</li>
    <li> Was using DDF, but they raised the price and decreased the amount so it is now a total rip-off.  Fortunately, I happen to like this toner much better. It is not as drying and doesn&#x27;t leave a sticky film like DDF. Will definitely repurchase!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t have the chance to use it much. The bottle spilled just after receiving it.  My fault.</li>
    <li> The first time I bought this it was from Sephora. Then, I found it to be helpful when I didn&#x27;t feel like washing my face. I&#x27;m not sure if this is the real product. This broke me out and I didn&#x27;t get the &amp;#34;toned&amp;#34; face that I remember before. It also seemed like it left a waxy film over my face. Still have it but stopped using it.</li>
    <li> The only toner that helps to clear up my breakouts....the only con about this is that it is slighly burns the skin if your skin is too dry but other than that I have nothing negative to say about this item.</li>
    <li> I love this product with the Glycolic wash.  My face is clean, clear and refreshed.  Make sure you use a good moisterizer, as it  will strip the moister from you skin.  I have clearer skin and no acne.  I usually get 5-6 breakouts a month.  After 1 mth I only had 2</li>
    <li> Perhaps this will work for people with heartier skin than mine. I should have guessed by the &amp;#34;acid&amp;#34; label that it would burn, and, yes, my skin blistered. I used it as directed, too. If you have very, very light skin, it might cause blisters. Beware.</li>
    <li> this is a phenomenal product. I have never been a proponent of toner, just seems like a marketing ploy and another extra step in the routine. But wait till you try it. it has done amazing things for my skin. I am 45 and still prone to hormonal outbreaks, this helps keep it clear and skin youthful looking</li>
    <li> I have oily skin and always had a lot of flaky skin that just wouldn&#x27;t go away.  I use this twice a day after washing my face with Cetaphil, and it gets rid of all the dead skin.</li>
    <li> This product has done a great job fading my red spots, though it has not stopped my blemishes from forming. In spite of the rather high 10% glycolic acid content, it does not dry my skin so long as I apply it only to acne-prone areas. This product has no odor and it is barely noticeable after it has dried, which does not take long. It has left my skin feeling very smooth and I recommend it to anyone, especially folks who are struggling with long-lasting hyperpigmentation after the healing of deeper blemishes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If this had stopped my zits from forming, I would have given it 5 stars. Also, the bottle seems to be a little leak-prone, so make sure the lid is screwed on tight. If you travel with the bottle, wrap it securely in plastic.</li>
    <li> keep skin clear of blackheads and uneven skin tone. doesn&#x27;t irritate my face. i don&#x27;t use on neck, cause burning and irritation.</li>
    <li> Excellent stringent for for those looking for a Glycolic Acid Toner. It really penetrates deep to removes the excess layer of dry or dead skin cells. My only suggestion would be to start out slowly.First see how your skin reacts to this product. To use as a toner you may need to gradually increase applications until your skin is able to handle it. It is very powerful and like most glycolic acids can be quite drying if skin is sensitive. To elimante this problem for me, I usually follow up the toner with an oil free moisturizer.Pores are literally unclogged.</li>
    <li> I love PTRs complexion correction pads and their beta hydroxy face wash. I was hoping to add this to my daily regimen but that&#x27;s not been the case. It makes my face look and feel oily so I use it on the rare occasion that I think it won&#x27;t bother me (but who wants their face to be oily, anyway?) I would not necessarily recommend this product. Don&#x27;t be fooled by the PTR label like I was... they make much better products than this so see my other reviews :)</li>
    <li> I have acne and this works alright. I think there are better products out there that won&#x27;t turn your face red. I don&#x27;t think I will purchase again.</li>
    <li> Effective at the right price</li>
    <li> Great product!! At 37 years old, I have always had some acne.  I tried a variety of over the counter products, prescriptions, and Proactiv, but always seemed to have at least a pimple or two.  Until I started to use this! I have not had a single new pimple pop up since I started using this about 1 1/2 months ago. I haven&#x27;t seen a noticeable change in wrinkles, but no acne is enough of a plus with this product! It does tingle/burn. I leave it briefly and then rinse it off with water. I haven&#x27;t had drying or redness. I don&#x27;t leave it on long. I use it twice a day, after washing my face in the morning and night, before I apply lotion. Wish I had found this product years ago!!</li>
    <li> I swear by this toner. I&#x27;m 57 and used to have horrible skin. Not any more! People even drs think I&#x27;m early 40s.. And when they find out the truth every last one wants to know what I use on my skin. It works!  #57andwrinklefree</li>
