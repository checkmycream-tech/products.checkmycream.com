<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Excellent product, I use it after my shower and my hair looks beautiful</li>
    <li> Only used it once so far but smells good and feels good :)</li>
    <li> I love this brand - it&#x27;s healthy for your hair and highly recommended by my hair stylist....smells great too! A definite buy-again....</li>
    <li> smells like cheap perfume, not impressed with results either. would not buy again. save your money.</li>
    <li> Thank you very much for your hounesty and speed shipping .. The product is great , the price is excellent and you r the best seller ever 😊</li>
    <li> Makes my hair smooth and managable.  Has a nice smell.  Downside, the size for the price.  Overall, I like it.</li>
    <li> Good delivery, works good, would recommend to others.</li>
    <li> this stuff is awesome. Nothing else I&#x27;ve ever used has worked so well on my frizzy curls.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for 2 months; I use it after the hair dryer and a little more after I iron my hair and it leaves my hair silky smooth with a great soft smell and it&#x27;s not oily or sticky. The main reason I bought it was because it has Argan oil, which is one of the best hair oil treatments. I know it&#x27;s a little more expensive than others, but I think it&#x27;s worth it.</li>
    <li> I loved the product. It makes my hair frizz free, soft, shiny and it smells good. With just 2 pumps it does it&#x27;s job. I had never heard about it until I watched one of Carli Bybels YouTube videos and saw this was what she used to have beautiful hair. I had to have it. And I&#x27;m glad I bought it.</li>
    <li> If you don&#x27;t want to spend a whole of money on the keratin treatment at the salon I recommand that you try the Global Keratin Anti Frizz with Argan Oil serum it REALLY WORKS like the full treatment. I use it on my daughter and my hair. I don&#x27;t even blow dry my hair just wrap and when its dry flat iron and it last until next wash. need to order some more soon.</li>
    <li> I know it&#x27;s a little more expensive than others, but I think it&#x27;s worth it for me it has worked I have oily, fine, color treated hair. I&#x27;ve been using this product for about 6 months now and my husband is asking me if I chaqnged my hair so how; I use it before and sometime after the hair dryer or flatironing my hair and it leaves my hair silky smooth with a great soft smell and it&#x27;s not oily or sticky. The main reason I bought it was because it has Argan oil, which is one of the best hair oil treatments.</li>
    <li> My hair is long,fine, with lots of follicles. My hair is highlighted.(Takes an hour and half to place a full foil) It is also oily. I purchased this product in the salon, and love it. Does not weigh my hair down. In fact, my hair seems to drink it. Like the other commenter, I use it before de-tangling and blow drying, and a bit more if I use another appliance. It seems to repel dirt, but I do use a bit in between washings. Smells nice. The best part: It reduces drying time for me by about 10 minutes. They do not claim this. Just an observation. As for the price: This is not drug store stuff. I am happy to buy drug store products that work (and many do). This product is without the chemicals that strip color and is as much a treatment as a stying product.</li>
    <li> Makes hair super soft and easy to brush through. Use very little and hair does not seem greasy, just shiny and less flyaways.</li>
    <li> Best stuff ever for my fine hair, take the fizz away very light serum and the smell is the best product scent of any hair product I have ever bought will not be without this stuff</li>
    <li> im using it for a year.. lol.. like it</li>
    <li> A must have for stylist or anyone who wants to give their hair that healthy sheen without being weighted down by other oil products.</li>
    <li> I used many keratin product and they all made my hair feel silky and smooth. this one has a sticky feel into it and I used it only once</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this a few days.  My stylist uses the moisturizing shampoo and the moisturizing conditioner by Global Keratin (WHICH I ADORE).  Regarding the anti frizz serum - I love how my natural, fine,  dry (African American) hair responds.  It purrs like a kitten.  It&#x27;s a daily glass of moisture for my hair.  My tresses are soft, manageable and tamed.  Oh - did I mention I&#x27;ve never had this much shine.  Even after I workout and sweat, I still look cute and just go home and put 1 pump in my hands, rub together and put throughout my hair.  Finally, I blow dry my hair on medium (to straighten it back out some) and roll it up using silk rollers.  Ocassionally, I use the flat iron and when I do I use 1 pump of the anti frizz before flat ironing.  A bit expensive, but cheaper than Sedu and other argan oils.  And who cares - IT WORKS!!!  I also ordered the GK moisturizing shampoo and moisturizing conditioner from Amazon and will let you know how they work when I try them.  Hope this helps ladies!!!!</li>
    <li> I think this product was just okay.... I have used Moraccon Oil for the past 3 or so years which I absolutely love.  I am always open to try new products in the hopes of even a better result.  So, I gave this product a try.  It was no where near as good as Moraccon oil.  I would not purchase this product again.  It gave mediocre results.</li>
    <li> Great for those frizzy hair days.  Love it!</li>
    <li> Great product. Really helps with the frizz.</li>
    <li> its smells nice and it adds some shine. but it has not done much else for me. i have fine hair that gets frizzy. this can make my hair oily if i use more than a drop.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product! It&#x27;s great at revitalizing my hair keeping it soft and shiny. I suggest that you use it moderation though. Once every otherday</li>
    <li> Softens my hair and gives shine to it.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work as I expected.  Didn&#x27;t control even fly aways more less the frizzies.</li>
    <li> I use the shampoo and conditioner as well as this. This is not at thick, or should I say as heavy, as Morrocan Oil. But, I like it. I think it helped my GK treatment last longer.</li>
    <li> I love this oil!&lt;br /&gt; I use it every day. Does not feel greasy or weight the hair down. my hair is fine and I have highlights.&lt;br /&gt;This product keeps it from looking damaged from the bleach and the curling iron. Good price to it sells for more at the salon.</li>
    <li> Smells a little weird but it was great</li>
    <li> Love this stuff....makes my hair lovely and soft.  No fizzies!!!</li>
    <li> This stuff is so great. It smells amazing and it makes your hair sooo silky smooth without making it feel greasy or weighed down at all. I gave away all of my other hair serums b/c this is by far the best I&#x27;ve used.</li>
    <li> On a good day I have extremely unruly hair. This mild and rainy summer in the south had caused my curls to swell into an impossibly tangled mop on the top of my head. (Not a good thing when you&#x27;re trying to grow your hair out for your upcoming wedding day!) I have been out of the Global Keratin shampoo and conditioner for a while and when I went to place an order for them I saw this product and thought, &#x27;why not?&#x27; I am very glad I made this purchase! The serum smoothed, untangled and softened my hair into a perfectly manageable state of unruly :)</li>
    <li> I love this product.  I have naturally frizzy/wavy hair and did a Keratin treatment at a salon that used Global Keratin products.  Getting keratin treatments are extremely pricey but I found that if you just continue to use the serum, you can still have that nice shiny straight hair.  I use a little bit in my hair after I shower and with blowdrying and straightening, my hair is just as straight as it is with the Keratin treatment.  I hope they never get discontinue this product.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this serum for three years now and just love the way it leaves my hair! It makes your hair smooth and  controls frizz.</li>
    <li> For the first time, I love it. I will be getting more. It makes my hair feels so soft. Try it!</li>
    <li> Works great, makes my dull wavy hair very shiny after I use it with a flat iron.  It also makes my hair feel softer and I get less tangles when I use it.</li>
    <li> great product for folks who use keratin to straighten hair.  My Mom likes it too even though she does not otherwise use keratin for straightening.</li>
    <li> Excellent product and seller. Leaves your hair so soft and smells great!</li>
    <li> This is a great product. It gives my hair so much lubrication without making look greasy...it goes a long way</li>
    <li> The GK serum keeps my hair shiny and smooth without weighing it down and works very well with the shampoo and conditioner.</li>
    <li> Awesome stuff..!!! Leaves hair frizzy free.</li>
    <li> This stuff smells fantastic which is a huge bonus, but it is phenomenal on hair. I use it after I style my hair to tame any fly aways and rehydrate my hair after I&#x27;ve put it through the ringer. It does help your hair dry faster if you use it before too, I just prefer mine to be the last thing I put on my hair. A little tiny bit goes a long way! It will not make your hair oily or greasy at all either : )</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m an Asian male. I love this hair product. It&#x27;s perfect for my hair.</li>
    <li> I like this product because it gives my hair shine without being too oily. My hair still has the body I love and is so healthy now.</li>
    <li> This product leaves your hair smelling really nice.&lt;br /&gt;And is very smooth. You feel like touching your hair whole day&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended</li>
    <li> This serum gets rid of fly aways and frizz. It is a must have if you have the keratin in your hair.</li>
    <li> Product smells great! Intently adds smoothness and shine. Perfect as a leave in and a finisher after a blow dry.</li>
    <li> So I haven&#x27;t noticed this has helped with frizz but it definitely helps keep my styler longer.  I don&#x27;t use much at all and I have oily hair and I don&#x27;t have alot of it.  But I would recommend for having Keratin and keeping my style longer.  I might try without my leave in conditioner and see if that helps.</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for many years. I obviously love it!  My hair is thick and wavy and this helps to control frizzies.</li>
    <li> Total bang for your buck on this product! I recently had a Keratin blowout and when I went to order the shampoo and conditioner on Amazon, I saw this as a related product. I use a few pumps before blowdrying and it leaves my hair so silky smooth and smelling yummy! I absolutely recommend this product for anybody with naturally wavy/frizzy hair - it works!</li>
    <li> My hair is so dry that I thought nothing could make it limp and greasy and attract dirt, but this did exactly that.  Even using just a speck of it.</li>
    <li> My hairdresser used this on my at my last color/cut when she curled my hair to hold a curl and I loved how it smelled and how long my curls lasted. I would definitely recommend this.</li>
    <li> I love this product.  Better than the salon price, too.  It came promptly through the mail as well.&lt;br /&gt;I am happy!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m really picky about smells - can&#x27;t take heavy perfumes and fragrances.  I love the smell of this stuff and it helps my dried out hair when I get out of the pool or have trouble with static in the winter.  It brings back the shine but doesn&#x27;t feel oily at all to me.  I have short hair so the bottle lasts quite a while for me.</li>
    <li> It makes all the difference in my hair. I began using this product about 5 years ago.makes my hair shine. Not greasy.</li>
    <li> At first I loved it! Made my hair so soft I could run my fingers threw it ! Now I&#x27;ve been using it for 2 months n my hair is falling out! There is hair everywhere ! The brush, floor, and on me! I&#x27;m going to STOP using this product !!</li>
    <li> My Hair looks Healthy and softer!</li>
    <li> This works well enough if used in moderation. Ultimately, though, it&#x27;s just another dimethicone product, like so many drugstore anti-frizz products that cost less. If you&#x27;re looking for a natural solution, buy a bottle of argan oil from a health food store. You&#x27;ll get better results... and after repeated sampling of other products, that is what I will stick with from now on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My main objection to the product is the very heavy scent. It will overwhelm any other scent you wear. If you are fragrance-sensitive, it may cause discomfort. Bear this in mind before purchase.</li>
    <li> Works good is what I expect to tame and healthy.</li>
    <li> The serum has been OK, but it has not helped that much to reduce frizz or add shine.  I&#x27;m still getting the hang of this one, so I&#x27;ll be optimistic that it will improve.  The smell of the product is nice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like all of the GK products, the directions for use are so small (2 point type) that I had to go online to find out how to use the product.  And that was limited.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Come on GK, give us better and more readable instructions.</li>
    <li> it didn&#x27;t do me any good</li>
    <li> This stuff smells awesome and really defrizzes my hair.</li>
    <li> Just a few drops and your hair is tame and shiny.  No need to use other sprays or gels or hairspray to keep you hair in place.</li>
    <li> Ok but not excellent . Didn&#x27;t make my hair any softer</li>
    <li> After using the shampoo and conditioner it is amazing how much volume the serum give your hair.Great products and totally keep your hair soft</li>
    <li> Great Product!!  A little bit goes a long way.  Smooths the frizzies and gives an unbelieveable shine! A must have in humid environments.</li>
    <li> I use just a drop or two prior to using my curling brush.  It gives my hair smoothness and so much less frizz!</li>
    <li> Love the smell and my hair has definitely been felt healthier since I have incorporated all GK products into my regimen.</li>
    <li> Along with the shampoo and conditioner which help make my hair more manageable, the GK Serum makes styling easier. I suggest purchasing the entire system for best results.</li>
    <li> I first got introduced to this when I had a Keratin treatment done. Now the treatment is long gone &amp; I still purchase and use this product. After you straighten your hair, you put a few (2-4) drops of this in you hand, rub your hands to gether and run it through your hair. OMG, it smells soooo good. Also, since you use so little it last a really long time and I have extremely long hair.</li>
    <li> I was so excited to try this since it stated it was great for controlling frizz and it had a ton of 5-star reviews.  I usually put a few drops of something in my hair and let it dry naturally.  I put 2 pumps of this in my long thick hair and it did absolutely nothing plus I really did not care for the smell at all.  Not sure what the smell is but to me it&#x27;s not pleasant.  I tried this on dry hair, thinking maybe it worked better that way but no such luck. Also if you put too much in your hair, it looks greasy.  I then tried it with another hair product in wet hair and it worked better but I really don&#x27;t want to have to use multiple products to get my hair to not frizz.  I&#x27;ll use up this bottle but don&#x27;t plan to repurchase.  I like the Biosilk and the Alterna Bamboo serums better than this.</li>
    <li> Great smell and leaves my hair so shiny</li>
    <li> Most products like this are heavy on fine hair, making it oily.  This is light &amp; nice &amp; does calm the frizz from Florida&#x27;s weather.</li>
    <li> This  is  a good  product  if  you  are  looking  for  a  little something  to  smooth  your hair and  make it  shine.  It  also  smells  great.</li>
    <li> Calms my curly, frizzy hair !</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this serum for over 2 years now - so I think I am &#x27;qualified&#x27; to share my opinions about it. First of all, it smells amazing! So yummy, just like how a girl (or a boy) would want their hair to smell! It is also very moisturizing and seals in moisture on dry ends like no other product I&#x27;ve tried. And trust me, I&#x27;ve tried lots of different products! I apply 4-5 pumps to my hair (I have pretty long, thick hair) when my hair is still damp from after washing. Just spread it through hair and heat style or leave to air dry. And you&#x27;ll have delicious smelling, smooth hair til your next wash!</li>
    <li> My daughter really likes this serum.  A little dab will do ya so it lasts a long time because.  Not too heavy as long it&#x27;s used in moderation.  Great for ends &amp; scalp.</li>
    <li> Like the sheen and feel after applying this product.</li>
    <li> Great product with a great price.  Moisturizes and leaves hair silky.  For use before or after blow drying.  I love it!</li>
    <li> I love how it leaves my hair.... I do recommend it to everyone I can possibly can.  I get so many compliments on the texture of my hair.  I am ecstatic.</li>
    <li> Go to product - great smell and perfect elixir to tame frizzy hair.</li>
    <li> I love this it really does make your hair shine and feel wonderful, my hairdresser uses this and Amazon&#x27;s price is a lot better than at her shop.</li>
    <li> This Hair product is the best serum with juvexin that I&#x27;ve ever used.  The keratin along with the other ingredients tames your hair causing your to be anti frizz, shiney &amp; smooth.  It also, adds luster &amp; makes your hair smell so fresh &amp; care free.  I would recommend this product to both women &amp; men with any hair type.</li>
    <li> Definitely makes your hair soft</li>
    <li> Awesome product! Tames the breakage pieces.</li>
    <li> Love how it makes my hair more managable and shiny.</li>
    <li> I got the GK salon treatment and bought this to use with it.  My hair looked great, but the smell is so overpowering it sent me into a sneezing attack.  This smells like incense, sandalwood, patchouli and who knows what else. The &#x27;Best&#x27; salon treatment smells like a wet dog, maybe they made this so strongly scented to balance the smell your hair retains from the treatment, I don&#x27;t know.  But it&#x27;s going back to the salon tomorrow.  I washed it out and I used my normal [[ASIN:B003HFO5OC Coppola Keratin Complex Repair Therapy, Iionic Intense Rx, 1.7 Fluid Ounce]] and it worked fine (with no smell).  BTW, I have no idea how well this works on untreated hair.</li>
    <li> I always buy this for my hair and it works great! It smells good and makes my hair appear healthier. I got the product fast without any issues.</li>
    <li> I use the GK shampoo/conditioner as well as this serum and overall I have had wonderful improvements with my hair.&lt;br /&gt;After the keratin treatment my hair got very dry and at one point was breaking and falling out.&lt;br /&gt;But once switing to GK that has not happened.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I put this in my hair and then brush it through before I blow dry.  And after I have blow dried it with a round brush my hair is SO incredibly soft, love the way it feels.&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#x27;t do much in terms of flyaways but with my hair feeling that fantastic I don&#x27;t mind as much.&lt;br /&gt;I did try using it on dry hair to tame some of the flyaways and although it didn&#x27;t feel greasy I didn&#x27;t like putting it on dry hair just incase.  As this does feel like an oil almost.&lt;br /&gt;But overall love this product and will be buying more!</li>
    <li> My hair feels Sooo soft and healthier!!</li>
    <li> I love how it makes my hair smoother and shinier but I hate the smell.  It smells like cheap perfume :(</li>
    <li> This serum is light weight and smells amazing!  It makes blow drying your hair much easier and makes your hair supple and shiny.</li>
    <li> it came on time, it looks the same but for me it didnt work. it didnt help straighten my hair and didnt make it softer. need to put a lot of matirial for some result.</li>
    <li> My daughter&#x27;s hair is treated with Keratin Tx and I use this product along with shampoo, condition, and leave in cond.</li>
    <li> I love this product.It changed the whole texture of my hair and left it frizz free even in the Florida humidity.</li>
    <li> Definitely worth buying. My hair does feel silky even after using the hot iron. Does keep the frizzing down and I like the scent. Very happy with the results. I usually get the keritan treatment but money is tight. Over all very pleased I bought this.</li>
    <li> I was having flyaways and my hairdresser tried the Global Keratin Serum on my hair.  It worked so well, makes your hair not only not have the flyaways, but adds shine, and smells great too!</li>
    <li> GKS has whipped my unruly gray hair into shape. It does not leave a greasy residue on your hair, it absorbs quickly and is very fragrant.  My hair is sooooo soft with GKS, people have noticed the change in my hair</li>
    <li> This is the best.  It keeps your hair light, gives it a shine, and is great for applying before blow drying.</li>
    <li> I have never heard of this brand until now. I was looking for a good hair serum that tamed frizz and made my hair soft and this does exactly that! today was my first day using it and I am very impressed. my hair looks so straight and feels like silk.  fast shipping if you buy it through prime. I highly recommend this product. I think i might be in love</li>
    <li> I love this product! It works great and smells great too. It works great to smooth dry hair but does not make it look oily.</li>
    <li> Love this hair serum!  A friend gave me some one time and I have been hooked on it ever since!  Have purchased it several times through Amazon.  I put it in the ends of my hair when it is damp.  It leaves your hair tremendously soft.  Love the smell too!</li>
    <li> Love this product.  You need so little to make your hair super shiny!  Not only did i buy a second bottle for myself, I bought one for the girl at work who kept telling me my hair was so shiny!!&lt;br /&gt;:)</li>
    <li> Smells good and gives my hair easy way to brush but does not help to get rid from static hair issue in the winter as was my main intention for this purchase.</li>
    <li> Definitely makes my hair feel silky. I gave it 4 stars only because my hair seems to look heavy and dull a few hours after I use this serum. I assume the product is very rich. I have to say that it REALLY nourishes dry hair, and for that, I will keep ordering this serum.</li>
    <li> I really love this hair product.  I first bought the product after it was used on my hair in a high-end salon.  It cost a fortune, so I was so happy to spot the same product on Amazon for a fraction of the cost.  I am a teacher, and my fourth graders always comment on how good my hair smells.  I personally feel it is the best product of its kind.  My hair is smooth smooth and soft after using just one or two pumps on my medium length hair.  I&#x27;m a huge fan!</li>
    <li> My hair is short and wavy. I usually both color treat it and straighten it. So, it&#x27;s taken some damage. Always looks great at the salon, of course, but when I do it, within a week or two I am frizzing like a Muppet and have to use about 5 different products to condition, condition some more, then condition again. I&#x27;ve tried everything.  It might work for a day, if I am lucky, but the next, even without washing, my hair is all over the place.  And dry like a sponge in the desert. Problem is that adding most products here makes my hair weighed down and greasy. Which is so not the point of not shampooing every day. (The point is to let the scalp&#x27;s natural moisture do it&#x27;s natural moisture thing.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now as the fall air comes and it gets dryer, I really worry about it. Well, usually. With THIS stuff applied generously from root to tip after a shower, then as I am styling as needed, I feel that \\&quot;walked out of a salon\\&quot; feel and look to my hair again. It feels SOFT, not straw like. It lays down and shines, rather than frizz all over the place like I&#x27;m about to start playing the drums for Doctor Teeth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And if (big iff) it feels dry when I am \\&quot;style maintaining\\&quot; (aka, going a day without shampooing) I can put this stuff in it and it doesn&#x27;t weigh everything down. Unlike \\&quot;anti frizz drops\\&quot; of some companies which, to me, are very heavy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the past week this and an Alterna finishing spray has been all I have been using to style. I&#x27;ve used A LOT of this with my angle cut. Especially in the front where it is most processed.  And yet? A lot seems to go a long way so far. Had I used this much of any other serum I&#x27;d be running to the store about to run out  after 2 weeks of use. I&#x27;m on week 3 and still have 3/4ths left. Now, I think someone with longer hair will go through it faster (duh) but it is worth protecting the investment of your hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ok, I am not going to convince you. I will say that  *I&#x27;m* using it to protect my hair. And withthe processing I do on my hair, it needs protecting. Like a new paint job on a car. Heat dings and scratches it. Time and hard water take away the luster. This stuff is like hair Armorall.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And I will say the prices here on Amazon are pretty darn good.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve got gray hair.  If you have gray hair, you know how dry it can be.  Not only that, my gray hair tends to frizz because of Florida humidity.  Last year I learned about [[ASIN:B003ZXMXCC Global Keratin Leave-In Conditioning Cream 4.4oz]] and have been very happy with it.  Now I&#x27;ve also discovered this serum.  It&#x27;s great because a little goes a long way.  Sometimes I use a little of this serum along with the leave-in conditioning cream and it makes the hair even smoother than with just the cream.  Using either product alone or the two together, I&#x27;ve had great results.  (And, BTW, the prices here on Amazon are better than my stylist&#x27;s prices, even with the 20% discount she says she&#x27;s giving me.)</li>
    <li> I started to have dry brittle hair when I moved to Chicago. My hairdresser recommended this oil to use especially when I blow dryer or flatten my hair. Now my hair is soft and silky. Normally without this product I have really thick tight curls relaxed African-American hair.</li>
    <li> My hairdresser uses this on my hair in the salon. My hair is fine and color treated and tends to frizz.  I use about three squirts of this serum after shampooing before blow drying and it really makes it smooth and shiny.  It also has a very nice fragrance. My hair is medium length and it takes about 6 months to use an entire bottle so it is also a good value; a little goes a long way. I do recommend this product.</li>
    <li> Excellent service. Shipment arrived as promised. Great work.</li>
    <li> Global keratin serum This product is very good. This is perfect for my hair. Is good for drying. Global keratin is my favorite.</li>
    <li> Smells great and really helps with frizz, great to use before flat ironing your hair&amp;#62;  Best Serum I have ever used &amp;#60;3</li>
    <li> I love these product they give my hair lasting shine without weighing down my hair. That&#x27;s why I give them 5 stars</li>
    <li> I use this after washing my hair. This product makes it easy to run a comb through-kindof like a detangler, but better!</li>
    <li> Unhappy with all GK products recently ordered. This product was in better condition than the others, but officially done with GK.</li>
    <li> Love the way my hair is manageable with this product.  Wouldn&#x27;t want to go without it for long.</li>
    <li> Great for those humid days when your hair is out of control. Really smooths and softens the frizz.</li>
    <li> Non-greasy and make hair soft with subtle shine and frizz control.  My bottle&#x27;s pump started backfiring after a few months of use but otherwise a great product.</li>
    <li> I love the GK line of hair products.  I received the products on time, and I am very pleased with my purchase.</li>
    <li> Love this serum....keeps my hair healthy and shiny and doesn&#x27;t weigh it down.</li>
    <li> Does not work&lt;br /&gt;Not very happy&lt;br /&gt;couldn&#x27;t get refund!&lt;br /&gt;I have to write at least 20 words-I have \\&quot;normal\\&quot; straight wavy hair that tends to frizz in the Florida heat and humidity. This did absolutely nothing except smell good and moisturize my hands.</li>
    <li> This serum tames my hair. I live in a very humid environment. I have long thick hair. I love the smell. I use it before I use a hot tool in my hair. The serum protects it from damage . I have no split ends for months. I love the way my hair shines</li>
    <li> I love the product it smells wonderful and works you don&#x27;t need much only a dab and it goes a long way if you put more you hair will flatten and so keep it low.</li>
    <li> great smell, but doesn&#x27;t work as well on my daughter&#x27;s curly, dry hair as Orofluido.  Tends to coat outer hair and not soak in.</li>
    <li> PRODUCT WAS WHAT IT WAS ADVERTISED AS AND CAME ON TOME</li>
    <li> My wife loves this stuff!  Great gift.</li>
    <li> My favorite hair product</li>
