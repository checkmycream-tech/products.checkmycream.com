      <li>Most products build up and make my hair crispy and frizzy.  </li>
      <li>I love this product, but can&#x27;t find it at any stores I&#x27;ve been to.</li>
      <li>This might be great for people with straight hair, so I&#x27;m not knocking the product</li>
      <li>I love L&#x27;Oreal, I love how my hair &amp; skin look after a day at the beach, so if they could bottle that look</li>
      <li>you were able to get it work for your curly hair</li>
      <li>I bought it at Walmart and am on here buying more because I love it.</li>
      <li>looked more like I hadn&#x27;t washed it in 2 weeks.</li>
      <li>I am even able to go a day without washing.</li>
      <li>Or for more control, the NYM&#x27;s Kinky Moves curl defining cream gives a smoother result.</li>
      <li>i loved this stuff the first time i bought it at walmart.</li>
      <li>I followed the directions exactly and loved how the soft and easy</li>
      <li>A better choice for sea salt spray is Not Your Mother&#x27;s &amp;#34;Beach Babe&amp;#34; texturizing sea salt spray - defines your natural waves and curls without drying or frizzing.</li>
      <li>It akes a good bit to hold down my hair.  </li>
      <li>I like it very much.</li>
      <li>Does exactly what I want.  </li>
      <li>This is the first &#x27;salt spray&#x27; I&#x27;ve used.</li>
      <li>Creates slight wave and nice texture.  </li>
      <li>You don&#x27;t have to worry about using one spray too much and having to re-wash your hair.</li>
      <li>I have stick straight hair.</li>
      <li>Thank you so much for looking for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Patricia Taylor</li>
      <li>look without the stiffness of most other styling products.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t notice any different texture but my fair just seemed \\&quot;floppy\\&quot; and then very frizzy as it dried and</li>
      <li>I have very curly hair which depending on how I style can be more soft curls and waves than tight curls.</li>
      <li>Most sea salt sprats have made my hair stiff and unruly.  </li>
      <li>I have a very sensitive nose, but can&#x27;t smell it.</li>
      <li>The salt content is much too high and left my hair feeling fried and crunchy.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m not sure how it would work for longer hair or other styles, but for a pixie cuts in texture, this product is good.</li>
      <li>I have very straight, long hair.</li>
      <li>I have a hard time finding it in stores, so I was glad to see that I can still get it online.</li>
      <li>when I get my hair wet, but washes right out with shampoo.</li>
      <li>Really over powering when spritzed on long hair.</li>
      <li>i normally dont take the time to write a review but so bummed its not the same.</li>
      <li>I have very curly, thin, fine hair.</li>
      <li>Because I generally like L&#x27;Oreal products, I decided to give this a try.</li>
      <li>I regularly use products to define my natural curls, and the proper mix of sea salt in a conditioning spray should leave your hair curly but soft; this product made my hair feel like I had coated it with Aqua-Net.</li>

    <li> Leaves a white residue, it&#x27;s nasty.</li>
    <li> This stuff is great, best curl spray I have ever used.</li>
    <li> This is the first &#x27;salt spray&#x27; I&#x27;ve used. I have very straight, long hair. Just to experiment I applied to dry hair, since it was also suggested on the bottle. BAD idea. It really left my hair feeling oddly gummy/tacky. The tousled beach look I was going for looked more like I hadn&#x27;t washed it in 2 weeks. I would give it another try if it weren&#x27;t for the awful smell. I&#x27;d liken it to scented panty liners, or air freshener in a public restroom. Really over powering when spritzed on long hair. Disappointed that I picked the wrong product - maybe a different salt spray would do better? Or maybe the beach look is not something you can fake.</li>
    <li> delivered on time, no problems, works great, I love this product</li>
    <li> I have very curly, thin, fine hair. I have to wash it every day because it never holds a style. I&#x27;ve used this product for about 2 months. I bought it at Walmart and am on here buying more because I love it. It makes my hair look like I&#x27;ve been at the beach all day, thick, defined curls. I am even able to go a day without washing. When I do wash it does feel different (over textured) when I get my hair wet, but washes right out with shampoo. My boyfriend doesn&#x27;t care for the smell. I have a very sensitive nose, but can&#x27;t smell it. I love this product, but can&#x27;t find it at any stores I&#x27;ve been to.</li>
    <li> I have stick straight hair. This gives it some wave and texture. Smells &#x27;beachy&#x27;. I like it!</li>
    <li> Nice hold without feeling too artificial. Give a slightly sticky texture. Would buy it again.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t make my scalp break out, not greasy, and forgiving.  You don&#x27;t have to worry about using one spray too much and having to re-wash your hair.</li>
    <li> This spray is really great.  I have a hard time finding it in stores, so I was glad to see that I can still get it online. Not only does it add that beachy, beautiful, wavy texture to my hair, it also smells so good. I can&#x27;t put my finger on the smell, but it&#x27;s awesome! They know how to package and ship it so that it is intact when you recieve it too!</li>
    <li> This made my hair sticky and straw like feeling. I had the same experience as Monica and would not use this product again</li>
    <li> I have very curly hair which depending on how I style can be more soft curls and waves than tight curls. I wanted to try a beachy spray with salt for quite a while. I followed the directions exactly and loved how the soft and easy the spray felt on my hair and how only a few pumps covered my entire head. I didn&#x27;t notice any different texture but my fair just seemed \\&quot;floppy\\&quot; and then very frizzy as it dried and then POOF. If you have curly hair this product is not for you even if you want to get beach  waves. I would suggest sticking with an alcohol-free(like L&#x27;Oreal Everstyle Mousse) and hair spray and then tousle and scrunch yourself to get waves instead. This might be great for people with straight hair, so I&#x27;m not knocking the product it&#x27;s just not wright for thick, curly hair.&lt;br /&gt;If you were able to get it work for your curly hair just drop me a comment and tell me how.</li>
    <li> I am a everyday user of L&#x27;Oreal products! Make up, Shampoo &amp; Conditioners, Styling products &amp; Hair Dye. I saw this and thought why not. I love L&#x27;Oreal, I love how my hair &amp; skin look after a day at the beach, so if they could bottle that look I am all in! I should of done a little research like I would normally do. It made my hair feel so gross. It was sticky &amp; hard, I could barely get a brush or comb through it. It looked like I had not washed or combed my hair in 2 weeks. I have very thick, heavy long hair &amp; it is a big chore to wash, condition etc.... my hair. I was irritated I had to start all over the same day! Maybe you know something I dont &amp; have had a great experience with this product but for now I am chalking this up as a total impulse buy!!! :) Cheers!</li>
    <li> I have very thick hair with a slight wave.  Most products build up and make my hair crispy and frizzy.  This does not!  It smells great and it does not create build up.  Does exactly what I want.  Creates slight wave and nice texture.  Most sea salt sprats have made my hair stiff and unruly.  This is one of the best I&#x27;ve tried so far.</li>
    <li> Because I generally like L&#x27;Oreal products, I decided to give this a try. It was a big flop. The salt content is much too high and left my hair feeling fried and crunchy. I regularly use products to define my natural curls, and the proper mix of sea salt in a conditioning spray should leave your hair curly but soft; this product made my hair feel like I had coated it with Aqua-Net. A better choice for sea salt spray is Not Your Mother&#x27;s &amp;#34;Beach Babe&amp;#34; texturizing sea salt spray - defines your natural waves and curls without drying or frizzing. Or for more control, the NYM&#x27;s Kinky Moves curl defining cream gives a smoother result. And no, I don&#x27;t work for NYM - I&#x27;m just passing on some helpful tips to others with fine-textured curly hair.</li>
    <li> Amazing! Works as well as Bumble and bumble&#x27;s surf spray, but at a fraction of the cost. Adds wave and curl to hair. I use it on wet hair and blow dry to add tons of soft, all-day volume.</li>
    <li> I have a pixie cut hair style &amp; this product worked great for texture for my hair style.  I&#x27;m not sure how it would work for longer hair or other styles, but for a pixie cuts in texture, this product is good.</li>
    <li> i loved this stuff the first time i bought it at walmart. and i ordered it on amazon. it smells different and does not work the same at all i feel like it has been tampered with. i normally dont take the time to write a review but so bummed its not the same.</li>
    <li> Amazing product !! Love it !!</li>
    <li> this is the best ive tried!!!</li>
    <li> I was given a bottle of this by a friend after getting my hair cut short. Really liked how it gave my hair the off the beach look without the stiffness of most other styling products. Then I couldn&#x27;t find it at the stores....Thank goodness for Amazon!!!!</li>
    <li> good product at a great price.</li>
    <li> My hair has been coming out.  Someone told me that hairspray has alcohol in it.  This does not have alcohol.  I have tried everything . I hope there will still more of this spray.  I like it very much. It akes a good bit to hold down my hair.  My hair is like baby hair.  Hard to handle.  Thank you so much for looking for me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Patricia Taylor</li>
