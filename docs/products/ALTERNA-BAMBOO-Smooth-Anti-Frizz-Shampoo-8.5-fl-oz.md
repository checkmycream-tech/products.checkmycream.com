      <li>Though I&#x27;m not so sure it&#x27;s</li>
      <li>:) So I advise to consult your hairstylist before you buy the product.</li>

      <li>I&#x27;ve used WEN and love it</li>
      <li>Thank you, Alterna, for making such a wonderful product!!!</li>
      <li>It may not turn gray for many years.</li>
      <li>Okay product.  </li>
      <li>Dries out my hair; though I love that the ingredients are organic.</li>
      <li>I also love the conditioner this is a product I will be ordering a lot if you have frizzy hair</li>
      <li>I thought this would work better since I love the Alterna Kendi Spray Oil.</li>
      <li>and I love it--</li>
      <li>I love this shampoo.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I love this shampoo and I use the conditioner as well.</li>
      <li>I find it just ok.  </li>
      <li>Smooth Anti-Frizz Shampoo &amp; Conditioner thinking the system would work better together.</li>
      <li>I love the Bamboo line, as it makes my hair so silky smooth.</li>
      <li>Does not suds easily.  </li>
      <li>I have semi-curly hair that frizzes easily, and this shampoo did nothing for me.</li>
      <li>easy to use twist up lid</li>
      <li>Good for more natural product and for smoothing hair.</li>
      <li>I really enjoy this product...</li>
      <li>free throughout the work day.</li>
      <li>(though I also started buying the 2-liter bottles when they&#x27;re available)  </li>
      <li>My hair isn&#x27;t anymore smooth than when I started.</li>
      <li>BAMBOO SMOOTH ANTI-FRIZZ SHAMPOO, 8.5 FL.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s smooth, shiny with noticable volume.</li>
      <li>friendly product&lt;</li>
      <li>It does exactly what it advertises, it smoothes out the hair making a better &amp;#34;anti-frizz&amp;#34; hairdo for the day.</li>
      <li>and it makes my hair feel clean.</li>
      <li>Didnt do anything special for my hair.  </li>
      <li>so be aware if you have fine hair</li>
      <li>This shampoo smells fantastic, and I also like the twist top lid which is easy to open.</li>
      <li>I gave this shampoo a 5 because it really works ,makes my hair smooth and free of the Frizz</li>
      <li>Love this product and was excited to see it offered at a considerably lower rate.</li>
      <li>and this is the only shampoo that leaves me totally rash-free, with beautiful, smooth hair and no waxy buildup (like you get with Paul Mitchell&#x27;s Super Skinny shampoo).  </li>
      <li>My long, course hair has greatly improved and feels much smoother.</li>
      <li>I think it is very prudent to read labels even on things listed as organic and leading us to believe we are using completely chemical free and healthy products....</li>
      <li>I have tried a few things and all have been great</li>
      <li>So definitely worth the price</li>
      <li>80% of anything that goes on our hair and skin is absorbed.  </li>
      <li>I like most Alterna products, but this, along with the conditioner and their styling oil is the best for my thick, coarse, color treated hair.</li>
      <li>so it is useful for fighting frizz.  </li>
      <li>Well worth the money.</li>
      <li>I do not want these chemicals absorbed into my body and therefore would not use this product.  </li>
      <li>so far I love it.  </li>
      <li>I actually think the Suave Professional Moroccan Oil Shampoo is MUCH more effective than this product and its 1/4th</li>
      <li>I thought the wig would never look natural again, with tons of frizz from top to bottom.</li>
      <li>Very light, fresh scent, nice thick consistency, and it cleans without over-drying your hair, keeping it healthier.  </li>
      <li>Loved how it does not weigh down hair.</li>
      <li>It stops the frizzy hair your hair is soft and easy to manage.</li>
      <li>, I thought my hair, especially the ends would be in better shape by now.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using Alterna products for several years and I am satisfied with them all, except Bamboo.</li>
      <li>I first saw this shampoo on The View.  </li>
      <li>I really like this shampoo!  </li>
      <li>This product did exactly what it says it does..</li>
      <li>It was ok, I will probably just stick to my regular Avalon Biotin Shampoo &amp; Conditioner.</li>
      <li>I just had my very fine, long hair chopped off to a shorter style.  </li>
      <li>This product is not a true organic healthy, free of chemical product.  </li>
      <li>but like i said, your hair returns to normal quickly.</li>
      <li>I have very fine, color treated hair and it was quite dry.  </li>
      <li>Other than smelling nice, I didn&#x27;t find anything about this product usefull.</li>
      <li>Works really well at getting rid of the frizz for my very curly hair!</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t really notice a difference in my hair.</li>
      <li>I spent tons of money trying brands from Walmart, and I haven&#x27;t found one that I love.  </li>
      <li>Gentle shampoos that delivers a smoother result and is softer to the touch.</li>
      <li>I have very think and frizzy hair</li>
      <li>This works really well with the matching conditioner.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I have semi-curly hair that frizzes easily, and this shampoo did nothing for me. Other than smelling nice, I didn&#x27;t find anything about this product usefull. My hair was still frizzy and actually felt less soft and manageable compared to when I used Aveda.</li>
    <li> I gave this shampoo a 5 because it really works ,makes my hair smooth and free of the Frizz I also love the conditioner this is a product I will be ordering a lot if you have frizzy hair I would suggest giving it a try</li>
    <li> Good for more natural product and for smoothing hair.</li>
    <li> Keeps my red color true.  No fading.  I use it religiously.  Tested thoroughly by my stylist to ensure no fading so that encouraged me to buy it.  It&#x27;s the only shampoo and conditioner I will use.</li>
    <li> I really like this shampoo. After washing with Alerna Bamboo,  my hair is soft and shiny.</li>
    <li> I have dry bleached spider web thin hair. I&#x27;ve used WEN and love it but the price is unrealistic. This is a great product and I&#x27;m loving it. I&#x27;ve tried other Alterna shampoo and conditioner and didn&#x27;t like any of them as much. This is great for my needs.</li>
    <li> Gentle shampoos that delivers a smoother result and is softer to the touch.On my 5th purchase.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not sure if my hair is extra frizzy or what, but there is no way I could walk out of my house after using this without blow drying and flat-ironing my hair.  I purchased this product because I don&#x27;t like to use a ton of serum when I&#x27;m blow drying for fear of causing breakouts, so I was hoping that this would help my hair stay frizz and flyaway free throughout the work day. Alas, it does not. That said, it does smell nice and cleans my hair well. I appreciate the fact that there are no sulfates in it and that it still gets rid of grease.</li>
    <li> Introduced to this shampoo at a salon. Loved how it does not weigh down hair. It smells great too. It is sulfate-free shampoo and I see no reason to go back to any other cheap shampoo option.</li>
    <li> One of the best anti-frizz shampoos I&#x27;ve tried, and I&#x27;ve tried a lot of high-end products. Definitely notice a difference in my hair after it&#x27;s blow dried.  It&#x27;s smooth, shiny with noticable volume.</li>
    <li> This product did exactly what it says it does.. a little too well! It smoothed my hair to the point my curls were toned way down and my volume reduced as well, but it definitely also got rid of frizz better than any other product I have tried! I wanted no frizz, but I wanted to keep my curls, so going to try the Alterna Curls one next and see if it works as well as this one!</li>
    <li> easy to use twist up lid&lt;br /&gt;slim bottle takes up small space&lt;br /&gt;safe friendly product&lt;br /&gt;cleans with no residue&lt;br /&gt;only con is price</li>
    <li> I first saw this shampoo on The View.  I couldn&#x27;t find it anywhere in the local stores, so I searched the internet and found it through Amazon.  I have very fine, color treated hair and it was quite dry.  I tried this product and have been using it ever since.  I like that it doesn&#x27;t have any of the harsh chemicals that you find in most shampoos.  Great stuff!!!</li>
    <li> I love the Bamboo line, as it makes my hair so silky smooth. However, as there are no sulfates in this shampoo, it does not lather well. You have 2 options here: you can either do two small applications of the shampoo, washing out some oil with the first one, or--as I do--use a cheap shampoo to get some of the oil out, then I come in with this stuff for a second shampoo. My hair stays smooth this way, but actually gets the excess oil out. Even with this small pain, I still love this stuff, and I use such a tiny tiny amount of it this way.</li>
    <li> This product is not a true organic healthy, free of chemical product.  Just to begin with anything with a synthetic fragrance in it is chemical.  From there,  a bunch of other chemicals that are not healthy...there are FOUR different kinds of PEG compounds, Methylisothiazolinone, and anything ending in \\&quot;eth\\&quot; are chemicals.  80% of anything that goes on our hair and skin is absorbed.  I do not want these chemicals absorbed into my body and therefore would not use this product.  I think it is very prudent to read labels even on things listed as organic and leading us to believe we are using completely chemical free and healthy products....that is certainly not the case here..buyer beware.</li>
    <li> This shampoo is thick so it is useful for fighting frizz.  But it is heavy so be aware if you have fine hair or if you like volume.  This shampoo works best for people who like a straighter style and have thicker hair.</li>
    <li> I just had my very fine, long hair chopped off to a shorter style.  I had a gift certificate and purchased this shampoo...so far I love it.  This conditions and doesn&#x27;t way my hair down.  It also smells terrific.  I live in the Northeast, and today was hot and humid.  I used this with the Anti-smooth conditioner, and no frizz or fly a ways.  My hair even got wet from a storm, and the frizz stayed minimal.  Once it runs out, I may have to purchase.  Other than the high price, I love this product.  I spent tons of money trying brands from Walmart, and I haven&#x27;t found one that I love.  So definitely worth the price</li>
    <li> Not the right stuff for someone with fine hair or thin hair Left my hair with a heavy  film feeling</li>
    <li> Good product, my salon uses this product.</li>
    <li> This product is awesome, and I&#x27;ve got the chance to buy it for a very good price. I do recommend.</li>
    <li> Most anti-frizz shampoos just weigh your hair down, this keeps the frizz out without the weight. I can style it curly or straight, can even go a couple days between washings (wish is much healthier for the hair) without getting oily. And it&#x27;s organic, which is a great bonus. Pair it with other Alterna Bamboo products.</li>
    <li> I have wavy,frizzy hair and this shampoo worked well to tame the beast! It is just too expensive for my budget...</li>
    <li> product did not do what it promised....VERY expensive for not doing the job.. would NOT recommend but there was no problem with returning the product&lt;br /&gt;sincerely&lt;br /&gt;sabrina</li>
    <li> I bought this for my friend.  He has long, curly hair that knots and frizzes except when he uses this shampoo.  It&#x27;s the best he&#x27;s found for cleaning and managing.</li>
    <li> I really like this shampoo!  It gets my hair clean, shiny and does make it less frizzy.  Does it take all frizziness away? No, but I don&#x27;t think there is a shampoo out there that does 100%.  There is an improvement I can see for me.  This my 2nd bottle and I will continue to buy this product. I also use the matching conditioner. Recommended</li>
    <li> STRAW hair. don&#x27;t waste your money on this product. I can&#x27;t find more negative things to say about this product</li>
    <li> I thought this would work better since I love the Alterna Kendi Spray Oil. I bought the Alterna Bamboo Smooth Anti-Frizz Shampoo &amp; Conditioner thinking the system would work better together. Unfortunately I was wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While I like the scent of the shampoo, I do find that this doesn&#x27;t moisturize my dry, coarse asian hair any better than any other drugstore shampoo. I actually think the Suave Professional Moroccan Oil Shampoo is MUCH more effective than this product and its 1/4th the price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ll finish the bottles (S&amp;C) but overall since I&#x27;ve been using it for a few weeks now, I thought my hair, especially the ends would be in better shape by now. My hair isn&#x27;t anymore smooth than when I started.</li>
    <li> I have very think and frizzy hair and this shampoo really seems to help.  Would buy it again and recommend it to all of my friends.</li>
    <li> After having tried, and loved, the Bamboo &amp;#34;Abundant volume&amp;#34; shampoo and conditioner, I decided to give the Bamboo &amp;#34;smooth Anti-Frizz&amp;#34; shampoo and conditioner a try. It does exactly what it advertises, it smoothes out the hair making a better &amp;#34;anti-frizz&amp;#34; hairdo for the day. The &amp;#34;anti-frizz&amp;#34; shampoo, in comparison to the &amp;#34;abundant volume&amp;#34;, has a much thicker viscosity. For this reason alone, I give it four, instead of five stars. I prefer the thickness of the &amp;#34;abundant volume&amp;#34; shampoo. Silly, but true. Nonetheless it is a great product!</li>
    <li> Okay product.  Didnt do anything special for my hair.  Only purchased once.  Prefer products with keratin to make my hair soft</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a bit of a product snob, and this is by far the best shampoo I have ever used.  I have very sensitive skin prone to dermatitis and this is the only shampoo that leaves me totally rash-free, with beautiful, smooth hair and no waxy buildup (like you get with Paul Mitchell&#x27;s Super Skinny shampoo).  I&#x27;ve tried hundreds of different types of shampoo, from drugstore brands to very high-end brands, but none hold a candle to this one.  Very light, fresh scent, nice thick consistency, and it cleans without over-drying your hair, keeping it healthier.  A little goes a long way, so I can justify the price (though I also started buying the 2-liter bottles when they&#x27;re available)  Thank you, Alterna, for making such a wonderful product!!!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product since my stylist suggested it. It does help to control the frizz in my hair and keeps my color.</li>
    <li> I bought an expensive, synthetic wig &amp; while wearing it the 2nd time, I pulled it up with a hair clip meant to come down after a few minutes. I forgot for hours (I have long hair naturally &amp; clips are every day). I thought the wig would never look natural again, with tons of frizz from top to bottom. This shampoo doesn&#x27;t smell the best but it works the best! I follow it up soaking in fabric softner for some smell-good &amp; hydration. Try this before throwing your wig in the trash.</li>
    <li> I have been using this shampoo for a while and must say it does all it promises to do.&lt;br /&gt;I also use the conditioner.</li>
    <li> I bought this product after my hairstylist raved about the Bamboo line of products. I find it just ok.  I would be happier with it if it was easier to get out of the bottle.  It has a twist cap and is quite thick so difficult to squeeze out of the bottle and then re close the top with slippery fingers (covered with shampoo).  Does not suds easily.  I think it costs too much for what you get and does not last long as I keep adding more to get some suds.  I am going to try adding water to the bottle to see if that helps.</li>
    <li> This product left my hair feeling flat &amp; dull.The smell was very nice but no control at all. will not buy again</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo!  I got a brazilian blowout recently and found this shampoo for the aftercare.  I normally have oily hair and this product makes my hair so soft and no frizz at all!  I will continue using this shampoo!!</li>
    <li> Couldn&#x27;t use it because it had leaked all over packaging. Love this product and was excited to see it offered at a considerably lower rate. But I can see why now.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Alterna products for several years and I am satisfied with them all, except Bamboo. Not good at all. No anti-frizz effect. Though my hairstylist said that this product is not for my type of hair so I should not blame the shampoo :) So I advise to consult your hairstylist before you buy the product.</li>
    <li> Great,  clean, healthy feel and maintenance, and smells extraordinary. Love this shampoo...was a salon recommendation for my hair type: wavy, long, thin. I really enjoy this product...it is my go -to in hair care for over a year now.</li>
    <li> I really like this shampoo, the texture and it makes my hair feel clean. Though I&#x27;m not so sure it&#x27;s anti-frizz properties are so effective.</li>
    <li> My hairdresser recommended this and I love it--the smell and what it does for my hair.  Remember to use just a tiny bit though--a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> I have frizzy, dry Asian hair. And I made this worse by lightening my hair 3 times in a row. This shampoo (with a few other products) keeps my manageable. My hair is actually in great shape for what I&#x27;ve done with it this summer (dyeing, swimming, styling, etc). I like the thickness of the shampoo, and it doesn&#x27;t seem to strip my hair of its natural oils.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t really notice a difference in my hair. It was ok, I will probably just stick to my regular Avalon Biotin Shampoo &amp; Conditioner.</li>
    <li> Dries out my hair; though I love that the ingredients are organic.</li>
    <li> This was recommended by a hair dresser. Cheaper on Amazon than the salon. A tiny amount of the shampoo is needed to create thick lather. My hair feels amazing.</li>
    <li> Aamazing shampoo, I have very dry hair and this shampoo give my hair shine a also use the oil and conditioner</li>
    <li> Definitely reduces frizz the longer you keep it on in the shower. The benefits only last a few hours. Im a guy and my hair is short so flat hair isnt a problem for me. For a girl I guess you wouldnt want to make your hair too flat with this product but like i said, your hair returns to normal quickly.</li>
    <li> This shampoo smells fantastic, and I also like the twist top lid which is easy to open. I read a few reviews before purchasing that said this shampoo weighs your hair down, and it does. I have very coarse, thick, frizzy, straight hair. I have it thinned every six weeks and it&#x27;s still incredibly thick, so this shampoo actually does me a huge favor by weighing my hair down and keeping it from being so poofy. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend this to anyone with fine hair, because it is very heavy. When I first used this shampoo the texture surprised me because it was so thick. After I rinsed my hair it felt like I had washed it with dish detergent which had me VERY worried, BUT when I brushed it and styled it, it was so silky and soft! Well worth the money.</li>
    <li> Works really well at getting rid of the frizz for my very curly hair! I don&#x27;t lose my curl, just frizz. It also smells really good!</li>
    <li> I like this product alot. I like most Alterna products, but this, along with the conditioner and their styling oil is the best for my thick, coarse, color treated hair.</li>
    <li> Great product, and wonderful smell.</li>
    <li> She still frizzes.  But not sure how bad she&#x27;d frizz if not for this stuff.  If you leave it in a shower mold will grow on it and the design of the bottle makes it impossible to get off.</li>
    <li> Really bad product my hair look terrible the was think I never use in mi hair I jus bad&lt;br /&gt;St bad</li>
    <li> Excellent product.  Alterna bamboo smooth anti frizz shampoo is an excellent shampoo..my hair is frizzy so alterna bamboo does a very good job during the summer.</li>
    <li> I love this product it works great on my hair</li>
    <li> This shampoo has Bamboo in it. It stops the frizzy hair your hair is soft and easy to manage. I believe if you started using this shampoo before your hair started turning gray. It may not turn gray for many years. I am 73 years young and ever time I wash it I notice a big difference in the color I have some gray in the front. By the way the name of the shampoo is .[ALTERNA BAMBOO SMOOTH ANTI-FRIZZ SHAMPOO, 8.5 FL. OZ..] Take my advise and give it a try. I ordered it from Amazon.com&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;B.J.H.</li>
    <li> This shampoo is really awesome. It has no sulfates, but is still able to produce a really awesome creamy foam.  The scent is really awesome.  When I rinse this out, my hair feels smoother and isn&#x27;t all knotty.  This works really well with the matching conditioner. After I use both, I use the Bamboo Kendi oil on towel dried hair. My long, course hair has greatly improved and feels much smoother.</li>
    <li> Great stuff, works better with each use, it has tamed my course hair. I use the conditioner and also alterna styling products.</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo and I use the conditioner as well. I think Alterna makes great products. I have tried a few things and all have been great</li>
    <li> I love this shampoo.&lt;br /&gt;You only need a little for each time.&lt;br /&gt;Meeks my hair strong.&lt;br /&gt;I use bamboo conditioner too.</li>
