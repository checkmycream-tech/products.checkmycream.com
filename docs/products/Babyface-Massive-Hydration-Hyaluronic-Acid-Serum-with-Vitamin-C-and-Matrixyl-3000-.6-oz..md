      <li>this product seems to make your skin feel refreshed and smooth, seems to be doing it&#x27;s job in a good manner</li>

      <li>Sure it looks nice, but the product doesn&#x27;t come out easy.</li>
      <li>for the price is ok</li>
      <li>would love to be able to &amp;</li>
      <li>but ive bought top line to any line and</li>
      <li>I like this one and going to buy more now.</li>
      <li>Just my results with it , i bough the eye cream too and that is a bit better</li>
      <li>My skin got better and firmer.</li>
      <li>but I love it!&lt;br</li>
      <li>I love all the Babyface products I&#x27;ve tried - 2% Retinaol A, eye creme, keratin oil for hair, etc.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I love all of their products.</li>
      <li>The top had to be taken off to get the product out.</li>
      <li>By opening up the top, I let more air in, so it would take even longer for the serum to release.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well</li>
      <li>My skin seems to be softer, tighter and more youthful.  </li>
      <li>I ordered this by mistake, but it was the best mistake I&#x27;ve made in a long time.  </li>
      <li>I loved this product when I first received it in the mail.</li>
      <li>This is another product that is easy to recommend.  </li>
      <li>Using it at night and morning for 5 weeks I can say it works as good as a high quality serum with peptides.</li>
      <li>Within a week of using this I noticed my fine lines and large pores were much better!  </li>
      <li>it goes on smooth and doesn&#x27;t interfere with your make up.</li>
      <li>It went on smoothly and seem to keep my skin hydrating.  </li>
      <li>I ordered several products and am happy with all of them.</li>
      <li>I tried to like this, it was smooth</li>
      <li>I have been using this for almost two weeks and honestly, I haven&#x27;t seen my skin look so nice in a long.  </li>
      <li>no more.... awesome!</li>
      <li>/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was excited to try this product.  </li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t  say enough good things about Babyface products.</li>
      <li>This helps tremendously.</li>
      <li>It runs out quickly and I end up using a q-tip to access the remainder of the product.</li>
      <li>The product is nice and definitely feels good especially after exfolliation.</li>
      <li>I have ordered it more than once and feel that it definitely makes a difference in the fine lines in the laugh area where it seems to plump the skin.&lt;br</li>
      <li>This is a nice product but the dispenser becomes dysfunctional about a fourth of the way through it</li>
      <li>Lastly, shipping is always prompt, &amp; free!</li>
      <li>I plan to go back to another product that is cheaper and has more in the bottle.  </li>
      <li>Anyway, I would recommend this serum to anyone looking to add something helpful to their skin regimen, but make sure it isn&#x27;t the only product in your arsenal.</li>
      <li>You have to necessarily use a moisturizer on top.</li>
      <li>Great product to use for dry skin especially for someone who spends a lot of time on the beach.</li>
      <li>if refridgerated(in a dark bag, or container), are a superb value for the money, and can be combined with other creams/serums if desired.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It is a very lightweight serum which leaves the skin feeling soft, smooth and supple...</li>
      <li>This product really works well on my skin</li>
      <li>I sent an email and received a very prompt response from the owner, Tracy.  </li>
      <li>Gentle, but hydrates the skin as for me</li>
      <li>The makers of this really need to fix this product dispenser.</li>
      <li>It did not do much else then that.</li>
      <li>This is really a bummer.  </li>
      <li>If you find it sticky, then you have used to much.  </li>
      <li>I finished the whole bottle in a month although I did not apply it to my whole face.</li>
      <li>It makes you skin soft and fresh.</li>
      <li>is very emollient but doesn&#x27;t take away wrinkles or relax them</li>
      <li>MUST BE FIXED!!!</li>
      <li>I use it in combination with other Babyface products and I love them all.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve bought her Matrixyl which is 40%, much more than any other Matrixyl products offered.  </li>
      <li>i saw no results in any plumping of lines or extra moisture by eyes as it says its full of moisture etc,</li>
      <li>It really works, especially if you ex-foliate your skin first!</li>
      <li>It is definitely my new skincare go-to!</li>
      <li>and I highly recommend it.  </li>
      <li>I have very sensitive skin and much older skin.  </li>
      <li>I honestly have worn alot less foundation while using this product simply because I don&#x27;t feel I need to hide any blemishes or acne since there are none anymore!</li>
      <li>Again another product used by my significant other.</li>
      <li>(along with 2% Retinol  Nightime Cream&amp; UnderEye Cream), this  truly does hydrate your skin(actually reducing wrinkles, stimulate collagen production,helps to even out skin(e.g., lightens reddened areas and lightens dark &#x27;circles&#x27; under the eyes).These 3 Babyface products don&#x27;t have a &#x27;smell&#x27;, are non-irritating, work wonders, have a good amount of product, last a long time</li>
      <li>Some of their other products are good, but this one to me is a waste of money.</li>
      <li>It helps clear up acne and reduce redness and irritation and evens out your skin tone.</li>
      <li>My skin is sensitive and this broke me out.</li>
      <li>I purchased the Babyface on the recommendation of my young (34) daughter.  </li>
      <li>I use 2 to 3 pumps about 3 tear drops for my whole face and neck and it last for all day.</li>
      <li>I am using the Aveeno daily cleaning pads and really like them.</li>
      <li>It is moisturizing and does not cause breakouts, but the effects are only (very) temporary.</li>
      <li>i would have given this more stars except the packaging really sucks.</li>
      <li>so I had to open it and noticed the bottle wasn&#x27;t even half filled.</li>
      <li>It makes my skin soft and younger looking.</li>
      <li>/&gt;4/5 stars ONLY because of this MAJOR flaw in this product&#x27;s</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I purchased the Babyface on the recommendation of my young (34) daughter.  She loves it.  I have very sensitive skin and much older skin.  I felt it tingling and kind of itchy.  Maybe I am allergic to it.  I gave it to my daughter and she was thrilled to get it.  Did not work for me.  I am using the Aveeno daily cleaning pads and really like them.</li>
    <li> After using the product for a month, there were no changes noticed on the skin.  I don&#x27;t recommend to waste your money on this product.</li>
    <li> Again another product used by my significant other. She highly recommends and says she sees a small savings when buying through amazon.</li>
    <li> This is a good product.  It went on smoothly and seem to keep my skin hydrating.  I have been using this with the face cream and eye cream.  I have only been applying it for about 3 weeks so I cannot comment on the effectiveness.  My negative comment is that the bottle is too small, and since it is sealed, you cannot &amp;#34;squeeze out the last drop&amp;#34;.  I don&#x27;t think I will order again.  I plan to go back to another product that is cheaper and has more in the bottle.  It seems to work as well if not better.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m 36 and signs of age started to appear on my face by thin smiling mimic lines around my mouth and by more tired looking eyes. The skin under my eyes looks less firmer and get darker when I don&#x27;t sleep enough and do not recover for days. First I started using the serum capsules and eyecream of a very expensive cosmetics brand but they had no help. They were too greasy so they caused little lipid spots so I wanted to try  something different. I bought this serum by a coincidence when I was looking for something with HA &amp; Matrixyl 3000. It has a small bottle like every serum bottle. I finished the whole bottle in a month although I did not apply it to my whole face. I applied it at my mimic lines under a retinol cream and the appearance of the lines got thinner. I also applied it under my eyes. My skin got better and firmer. They look less tired and dark coloring got less. Using it at night and morning for 5 weeks I can say it works as good as a high quality serum with peptides. It makes you skin soft and fresh. It is non greasy. But it does not make a difference like you had some cosmetic surgery or had Botox/collagen filling. It&#x27;s an economical alternative to extremely expensive peptide creams.</li>
    <li> i had hopes but ive bought top line to any line and this did nothing for me i saw no results in any plumping of lines or extra moisture by eyes as it says its full of moisture etc, Just my results with it , i bough the eye cream too and that is a bit better is very emollient but doesn&#x27;t take away wrinkles or relax them</li>
    <li> I gave this 3 stars because I was not able to use very long. My skin is sensitive and this broke me out.</li>
    <li> I love all the Babyface products I&#x27;ve tried - 2% Retinaol A, eye creme, keratin oil for hair, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was excited to try this product.  Unfortunately, after about 2 weeks, nothing came out of the pump.  I tapped it on the counter, nothing.  Then I opened it up (a no-no, I learned later).  I could not get the serum to come out.  I sent an email and received a very prompt response from the owner, Tracy.  She explained that the pump is airless.  I was supposed to have tapped it on the counter until the serum came out.  By opening up the top, I let more air in, so it would take even longer for the serum to release.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, I&#x27;ve been tapping for over 1 month and nada.  I suggested that Tracy give a refund or replace, but never heard back.  This is really a bummer.  I will continue to by and try her other products and steer clear of those with a pump.</li>
    <li> Within a week of using this I noticed my fine lines and large pores were much better!  Will keep using this as I only just got this and tried it for a few weeks.  It does moisturize too!  Great for the price also.</li>
    <li> The top had to be taken off to get the product out. The dispenser did not work properly when mashed nothing came out.</li>
    <li> The container has to GO!!  It did not work at all.  I have to apply it with a Q-tip.  Product seems good, tho.</li>
    <li> i would have given this more stars except the packaging really sucks. Sure it looks nice, but the product doesn&#x27;t come out easy. After just a few uses, i&#x27;ve had to shake &amp; fling the bottle around to force the product out. Hold it upside down, sideways, swing it here &amp; there, it&#x27;s annoying.</li>
    <li> great product. Great company. I ordered several products and am happy with all of them. Nothing is a miracle but my skin has improved.</li>
    <li> My skin seems to be softer, tighter and more youthful.  Great product!&lt;br /&gt;I would love to be able to &amp;#34;pump out&amp;#34; every drop!</li>
    <li> Ever time I try to use this product on my face it breaks me out! I have used other brands before that have not done that.</li>
    <li> Do NOT be afraid to try BabyFace products.  I have tried many and they are all wonderful for the cost.  This massive hydration serum, does what it says it does, it MOISTURIZES your skin.  I love all of their products.</li>
    <li> I had no peeling or side effects from this product. I spot apply it to the driest areas of my face before I apply my night cream. I can see an improvement in these dry patches.</li>
    <li> This is a nice product but the dispenser becomes dysfunctional about a fourth of the way through it and you have to rip the cap off to use the remainder. It runs out quickly and I end up using a q-tip to access the remainder of the product. The makers of this really need to fix this product dispenser.</li>
    <li> The product is nice and definitely feels good especially after exfolliation. The packaging is why I gave it three stars. The pump didn&#x27;t work. I had to remove the pump to access the product.</li>
    <li> Great product to use for dry skin especially for someone who spends a lot of time on the beach.</li>
    <li> Not really excited about this product.  Some of their other products are good, but this one to me is a waste of money.</li>
    <li> Good ingredients and quality brand that has worked well for me.  I have ordered it more than once and feel that it definitely makes a difference in the fine lines in the laugh area where it seems to plump the skin.&lt;br /&gt;It takes some practice with the pump but a little goes a long way for coverage.  If you find it sticky, then you have used to much.  Will continue to order because I think it works well and is a lot cheaper than a lot of products that don&#x27;t contain the combination of ingredients that this produce does.  Use other Babyface products also and always get them well packaged and protected.</li>
    <li> I ordered this by mistake, but it was the best mistake I&#x27;ve made in a long time.  I have been using this for almost two weeks and honestly, I haven&#x27;t seen my skin look so nice in a long.  It&#x27;s plump and youthful looking and the product hasn&#x27;t dried out my skin either...love it!</li>
    <li> This is another product that is easy to recommend.  This is thick and a little sticky.  I put it on at night.  Makes my skin feel smooth and look bright.</li>
    <li> for the price is ok and i may buy it againg i did see i liltle change but i use it 3 times a day</li>
    <li> this product seems to make your skin feel refreshed and smooth, seems to be doing it&#x27;s job in a good manner</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for about 5 weeks now with no discernable difference in my skins appearance or elasticity due to this product. It is moisturizing and does not cause breakouts, but the effects are only (very) temporary.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t  say enough good things about Babyface products. One of  the three i use (along with 2% Retinol  Nightime Cream&amp; UnderEye Cream), this  truly does hydrate your skin(actually reducing wrinkles, stimulate collagen production,helps to even out skin(e.g., lightens reddened areas and lightens dark &#x27;circles&#x27; under the eyes).These 3 Babyface products don&#x27;t have a &#x27;smell&#x27;, are non-irritating, work wonders, have a good amount of product, last a long time if refridgerated(in a dark bag, or container), are a superb value for the money, and can be combined with other creams/serums if desired. Lastly, shipping is always prompt, &amp; free! I shouldn&#x27;t be giving up so much &#x27;game&#x27;, but i hope they make these products for a long time!!&lt;br /&gt;ONE PROBLEM(Which some others have obviously already mentioned): The &#x27;PUMP&#x27; that is supposed to push out the product is not realy a Pump- the product gets left in the bottle.&lt;br /&gt;THIS MUST BE FIXED!!! WHAT ABOUT MAKING A TUBE THAT YOU CAN SQUEEZE OUT?????&lt;br /&gt;4/5 stars ONLY because of this MAJOR flaw in this product&#x27;s dispenser(i.e. lack thereof).</li>
    <li> I think I like the product, but it is nearly impossible to get the pump to work - I have to open the top and shake it out.</li>
    <li> Vitamin C is one of the greatest skin care products and I liked that it also had the hyaluronic acid as well.</li>
    <li> I have been searching for a skin product to combat my dry facial skin and I have finally found it.  This product really works well on my skin and I highly recommend it.  Dry skin no more.... awesome!</li>
    <li> The pump did not work since the beginning so I had to open it and noticed the bottle wasn&#x27;t even half filled. The consistency is way too watery. You have to necessarily use a moisturizer on top. I used along with the retinol baby face cream. No improvements or changes on my skin, at all.</li>
    <li> I tried to like this, it was smooth but I had no improvements with my skin. It was just a good primer for makeup. It did not do much else then that. Another product with no results.</li>
    <li> This product is great it goes on smooth and doesn&#x27;t interfere with your make up. It makes my skin soft and younger looking.</li>
    <li> Works great on aging skin. Exposed to harsh conditions in outside working environment. This helps tremendously. A very little goes along way. Recommended to others. Was using Olay which makes me break out in acne. Very Satisfied.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this product! I noticed results the first few days after using the product! It&#x27;s awesome. It helps clear up acne and reduce redness and irritation and evens out your skin tone. I honestly have worn alot less foundation while using this product simply because I don&#x27;t feel I need to hide any blemishes or acne since there are none anymore! There is no smell in the product and it goes on really nice. I use it both at night and during the day. It works wonders and is a really great product! It is definitely my new skincare go-to! Will definitely purchase again!</li>
    <li> I love this one! I just finish writing review for babyface collagen building serum earlier and can&#x27;t wait to talk about this one. I think this is the best hydrating serum. I use 2 to 3 pumps about 3 tear drops for my whole face and neck and it last for all day. I noticed after using for few weeks my skin is not spot flaky anymore. Best thing is I can put makeup on easily. I like this one and going to buy more now.</li>
    <li> I loved this product when I first received it in the mail. It really works, especially if you ex-foliate your skin first! The only issue I had was that the product seemed to absorb less and have fewer results as I continued to use it, although I guess one could argue that that just means it got the job done. Anyway, I would recommend this serum to anyone looking to add something helpful to their skin regimen, but make sure it isn&#x27;t the only product in your arsenal. Having something abrasive to remove dead cells before you apply it is essential or it won&#x27;t have the desired impact.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m tempted to get this. I&#x27;ve bought her Matrixyl which is 40%, much more than any other Matrixyl products offered.  She sells on Ebay and the products are produced under stringent conditions, which impressed me and her service is great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the woman who said this product made her face itch, she might want to try the Hyaluronic Acid and Evian Water mix.  No breakouts from this either. Gentle, but hydrates the skin as for me the Hyaluronic acid is too thick and sticky.</li>
    <li> Great moisturizer not at all greasy.  I use it in combination with other Babyface products and I love them all.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m knew to this Babyface product but I love it!&lt;br /&gt;It is a very lightweight serum which leaves the skin feeling soft, smooth and supple... YES!</li>
