<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Love the texture of this cream - so smooth and not greasy at all.  Was so happy it had no stinging that I usually get with creams and lotions. Went on so smoothly and I wanted to put on more because it felt so good!  Love the natural smell.  Too soon to tell results, but I would use for the moisturizing effect alone!  I get dry skin under my eyes, so this worked perfectly to smooth that area.  Can&#x27;t wait to continue use to see results.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this Eye Cream! It&#x27;s not cakey like a lot of the ones I&#x27;ve tried! I definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this for over a week and LOVE the results!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for a few weeks now and am very happy with the results. I am 50+, fair skinned, and love the outdoors. So, yeah, I am a challenge with aging skin. I have found this eye cream to be very helpful. It is helping with puffiness, bags, wrinkles and fine lines. It absorbs quickly and does not leave my eye area greasy. I really like that it is morning usage, rather than night time. I will be reordering!</li>
    <li> &amp;#34;I have tried many eye creams from department stores, drug stores and personal sellers (ie Mary Kay) , but within the few days of using this product I have noticed a difference and it doesn&#x27;t make the area around my eye greasy or oily. I would definitely purchase this product again.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> The lines around my eyes are looking softer and lessened. This eye cream is rich and feels wonderful. This is a keeper!</li>
    <li> As a cancer survivor I am very careful of what I use now, especially on my skin. I decided to try this eye cream because of the ingredients it has  and where it was made and was totally glad I did. I have used it now for almost two moths following the directions carefully and have begun to notice an improvement around my eyes. If you want a light, gentle eye cream for  your eyes give Aliven a try!</li>
    <li> I have been using this product now for a couple of weeks, I have noticed the skin around my eyes seem softer  &amp; smoother I have even used it around my lips to soften the fine lines .I would highly recommend this product to my family and friends!</li>
    <li> If you follow the directions, you will have amazing results. My eyes look so much softer,lines are beginning to diminish. This was a good purchase and I would purchase again.</li>
    <li> I have been lucky enough to try a variety of beauty products lately! I am pushing my mid forties and can definitely see my skin changing as I age. I was able to receive this product at a discount for my unbiased opinion. This product also came with very informative information about the delicate area around our eyes and the &amp;#34;why&#x27;s&amp;#34; behind the ingredients. I love, love, love this eye cream! A little goes a long ways! I love that it contains natural ingredients and delivers results as a reparative eye cream! I just get the feeling that the utmost care, preparation, and consideration has gone into the crafting of this cream. It will be my &amp;#34;go to&amp;#34; eye cream from now on!</li>
    <li> All natural look/feel cream.  It is a sort of grainy cream with a natural, woodsy type fragrance to it.  Use a q-tip to apply as you only need a little to go a long way.  Every morning I have puffiness around the eyes, Aliven helps take that away and quickly.  By the time I am out the door to work, the puffiness is gone.  I also notice more smoothness around the eye area.</li>
    <li> I have been using Aliven for about 10 days and notice a difference.  The crows feet around my eyes are fewer and not as deep.  Love the consistency and feel of the cream.  Don&#x27;t like that it isn&#x27;t a night cream.</li>
    <li> Love the smell and texture.  Looking forward to seeing the results.</li>
    <li> I have sensitive dry skin. So on the first day I cautiously tried it and I was delighted with the results. Since it was very thick and creamy I only had to use a very small amount. I dabbed it on and could feel it being absorbed in my tiny eye wrinkles while it gave a gentle tightening of my skin. Also i noticed my eye area felt smoother and moist.  Review  by Louise Howell</li>
    <li> I took a chance on this eye cream and I&#x27;m so glad that I did! It has definitely softened the fine lines around my eyes and moisturizes without being greasy. It has also made a noticeable difference in my dark circles! I absolutely will continue to use this eye cream since it has worked better than any other eye cream that I&#x27;ve ever used including high end products that we constantly see commercials for.</li>
    <li> I have been using this eye cream for two months now and love it so much I ordered my second jar. I notice a big difference by my eyes where the crow’s feet and puffiness have diminished. I also started using it on my neck, which was starting to look older and my upper lip, which was starting to get wrinkled (I think in reaction to laser treatment). I was so relieved and happy when I saw a major difference in both after using the cream. I definitely recommend this eye creme!</li>
    <li> Thank you for the follow up e mail. I too like you do believe strongly in our higher being Jesus Christ our lord and savior and have had &amp;#34;miracles&amp;#34; happen in my life as well. i am still using the eye cream and like the texture of it but have not actually noticed any significant results yet but plan on at least using the entire jar before I make a final decision as to whether I will purchase anymore of the product or not. Again thank you and God Bless!</li>
    <li> This worked good on fine lines</li>
    <li> Creme works well with my sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> This is what my wife Beverly said she experienced using the Aliven eye creme product:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;#34;I was very fortunate to be a part of the test group for this new eye creme. After a long day&#x27;s wear of considerable eye makeup, I applied the aliven as instructed before retiring to bed. It cleansed and soothed my eyelids to the extent that I experienced one of the most restful sleeps I have had in such a very long time. I awoke in the morning, went to the bathroom, looked in the mirror, and was astonished to see not one trace of wrinkles or puffiness from the evening before!!!&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I was fortunate to be part of the test group.  My skin is noticeably softer, in fact I&#x27;ve had comments on how good my skin looks.  Even in the short time I was part of the test group some of the finer eye lines have improved.  Love the idea it&#x27;s all natural!  Can not wait for even more wonderful results.  I would recommend this eye crème to everyone!</li>
    <li> I LOVE this new eye creme!  I&#x27;ve been looking for a natural alternative that would have the same effects as the national brands, and I have finally found it!  The creme goes on smoothly and does a great job of smoothing out my wrinkles.  I can&#x27;t wait to tell my friends!</li>
    <li> I like this cream, it&#x27;s nor greasy at ail.</li>
    <li> I just got this cream and I love it.  It took care of eye puffiness and smoothed out the fine lines.  I highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I just started using this eye cream a week ago. I have to say I love it. The texture is a bit thick but a little goes along way. I have even started using it on my neck. I have seen smoother skin, my wrinkles are less noticeable and this is in a week. I love that it is free of harsh chemicals. I will be buying again.</li>
    <li> Has really helped dryness around eyes love natural scent of product I also use around upper lip has really helped to soften lines . Absorbs into skin quickly and was also shipped in a timely manner. TYVM!</li>
    <li> This eye cream has a natural scent, goes on smooth and appears to absorb into the skin without feeling greasy. I&#x27;ve tried many creams in the past and this one works just as well, if not better than some of the more expensive brand name creams. What I like best about this one is that it&#x27;s all natural and immediately reduces puffiness. Overall, I&#x27;d recommend this cream to others!</li>
    <li> LOVE THIS!!  been using for about a week now, really helps with puffiness, and lines look more soft, cant wait to see results in a few more weeks.  Smell good, and a little goes a long way.  Will order again!!</li>
    <li> This is a very nice moisturizing eye cream and I had no problem with my sensitive skin.</li>
    <li> it is a really good eye creme ,i love it</li>
    <li> I love Aliven Eye Crème!  I was so excited to try something that would give my eyes a more youthful look, and I found it!  Aliven Eye Crème is easy to apply and a little goes a long way.  I look forward to using the creme every morning and knowing that people can&#x27;t tell my age by looking at the lines and puffiness around my eyes anymore.  I definitely recommend Aliven Eye Crème.</li>
    <li> I was a little disappointed in this eye cream, I do not really like the smell , it applies easily and is very creamy, still have a few dark circles under my eyes, hoping they disappear before long, have been applying it to a dark spot on my face and just thinking it may help it disappear, thank you</li>
    <li> &amp;#34;I love this eye creme, follow the instructions as noted and you will definitely see and feel a difference to your skin. I used this not only for my eyes, but my face and neck. A little goes a long way!!&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Luxurious texture, thick and rich.  It also absorbs into your skin quickly so you don&#x27;t feel greasy. This works great as a moisturizer and a skin toner. Wonderful product.</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin and this product did not irritate my skin at all.  In fact, it&#x27;s non-greasy, absorbs easily, smells great and soothes my skin.  I would definitely recommend this product to all you highly sensitive people who are looking for a good eye cream that really does what it promises.</li>
    <li> Received this creme in only 4 days.  Wow!  Have only had time to use it once this morning but within about an hour my under eye puffiness was gone.  (something I deal with every morning)  Creme has no odor, goes on very smoothly. and Just a tiny daub of it is more than enough.  Am very excited to see what happens with more use because one use even helped.  Seller called me this morning to make sure I received it and was a very pleasant conversation,  she is very dedicated to making sure the creme is everything it claims to to.&lt;br /&gt;  So far I love it</li>
    <li> As a holistic physician and someone who has suffered from chemical sensitivities, I love the ingredients in Aliven!  All ingredients are natural, no petrochemicals, no fragrance!  The creme goes on smoothly with a silky and luxurious feel.  It has a gentle smell from the natural ingredients.  It hydrates my skin beautifully and very little is needed to cover my entire face.  Well done!</li>
    <li> Use this for about 2 months so far. Doesn&#x27;t see any improvement yet. But I feel comfortable after put the cream around my eyes. Would like to try more and see if there is any change around my eyes area.</li>
    <li> I HAVE BEEN USING THIS PRODUCT FOR TWO WEEKS AND IT IS WONDERFUL- I FIND i&#x27;M USING LOTS LESS CONCEALER AND THAT IS SUCH A PLUS. I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS TO EVERYONE!! IT ALSO MOISTURIZURES REALLY WELL.i LIKE ALL THE NATURAL INGREDIENTS TOO!!</li>
    <li> I really wanted to give this time to work and I&#x27;m glad I did.  It took about 2 weeks for me to see improvements in the dark circles under my eyes and the crepe-y texture of the skin.  My crow&#x27;s feet are much less noticeable. The only thing I didn&#x27;t like was the smell. At first it was very nice, like lavender but now it smells a little more like yeast, or soy.</li>
    <li> This cream feels wonderful on my skin.  I will be re ordering for sure!</li>
    <li> Fast delivery !!!  Cream is lucious and whipped.  I use it on the vertical lines around my mouth -- it saturates, puffs (decreasing the depth of the lines), and lasts the day.  I thought with all the natural ingredients -- I was expecting a &#x27;different&#x27; smell that one experiences with that type of product --- but this one is great (no funky lingering odor). I do use it by my eyes (but so far that is not my problem area).  Plan on re-ordering.</li>
    <li> This cream really makes muslin feel so soft. Haven&#x27;t used it long enough to know if my fine lines will become less noticeable or not. But I do like it.</li>
    <li> A dont see any results</li>
    <li> Quick service! Cream is very soothing,absorbs quickly,not greasie at all!</li>
    <li> Is love too strong of a word to use in connection with an eye cream?  I hope not because I love this product!  I use only cruelty free products, so finding Aliven Reparative Eye Creme fit with the type of product that I am committed to using.  I am thrilled with how this eye cream makes my skin feel.  I can see a difference in the texture of the skin under my eyes and I have only been using it for a short time.  The cream is thick and rich and disappears into my skin leaving it feeling fully moisturized.</li>
