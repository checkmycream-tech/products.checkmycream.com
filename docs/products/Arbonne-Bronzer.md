    <li> If you have ever thought about Arbonne and never gave it any thought go for it.  My friend came over and did my makeup with this makeup and it looks gorgeous!! I use bare minerals, I still do, I mix it with Arbonne Bronzer and Arbonne Natural Radiance Mineral Powder Foundation in Tan.  I&#x27;m fair to medium skinned.  I&#x27;m a sun block wearing, hat in the sun, under the umbrella at the beach type of girl.  I live at the beach, or I use to until I got skin cancer.  It changes your outlook on going to the beach and baking in the sun after going through that.  So I&#x27;m pale.  I bought this bronzer only to really use to define the hollows below my cheek bones.  This makeup looks natural and will last a really long time.</li>
    <li> I love Arbonne bronzer. This is the only Arbonne product Is worth the money.not only does it do a great job, it lasts a long time.</li>

    <li> Quick service. Good product.</li>
    <li> Arbonne carries the best bronzer out there. I have tried many products, from Bare Essentials, to Clairons, MAC and more and this is the best bronzer I have ever tried. It gives you a natural glow and tan. Every time i use it people ask me if I am tanning and or have been in the sun.  I call it Brazil in a can!!! It&#x27;s awesome and worth purchasing.</li>
    <li> My favorite makeup tool ever! Will never use another.</li>

    <li> Nice bronzer- very dark so use with a light hand. Probably better on skin that&#x27;s medium or tanned. Nice product though</li>
    <li> Delivered on time. Excellent product</li>
    <li> Good product,just not right for me to dark and I didn&#x27;t like the sparkle in it.</li>
    <li> This bronzer I use every day. It doesn&#x27;t make you look orange and is not sparkly. It goes on smooth and lasts all day long.</li>
    <li> Not the same case as my old one, but same color. Luckily I still had half of old one and use that to spread bronzer out on brushes!</li>
    <li> It has natural sun look.</li>
    <li> Love this stuff...won&#x27;t use anything else. Gives my skin a nice color. Have been buying it for years and I always get a compliment...people always ask me if I&#x27;ve been on vacation.</li>
    <li> Love this Product!!!!</li>
    <li> Arbonne is an amazing product. I am allergic to titanium dioxide and most cosmetics list that in their ingredients. This is perfect for me. I don&#x27;t use any other bronzer.</li>
