      <li>Smells great &amp; you tan super fast!</li>
      <li>It don&#x27;t steak, goes on really smooth, and has tanned me pretty good.</li>
      <li>I recieved a sample of this when I bought a different lotion, and I LOVED it!</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t tan easily</li>
      <li>This lotion makes your skin feel so silky smooth and makes you tan so evenly.</li>
      <li>I have blonde hair and medium skin but tan very well, and these bronzers were not orange-ish at all, but a perfect streak-free bronzey brown!  </li>
      <li>Overall it&#x27;s a pretty good lotion!</li>
      <li>The scent is awesome, not overwhelming.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m pretty satisfied.</li>
      <li>I purchased this on a Thursday and received that Saturday and did the FREE super saver shipping.</li>
      <li>i saw so much color love</li>
      <li>I tend to tan red, I&#x27;m fair complected</li>
      <li>I needed to get a new lotion because I wasn&#x27;t able to plateau anymore with the lotion I used for over 6 months.</li>
      <li>Overall, the lotion is amazing.</li>
      <li>Well worth the money-</li>
      <li>Works just as good as any other tanning lotion I&#x27;ve used.</li>
      <li>right before i bought this</li>
      <li>and it doesn&#x27;t leave you feeling you have to shower right after.</li>
      <li>so i keep those right out of the tanning bed</li>
      <li>For me it was all about seeing results after the first tanning session.</li>
      <li>so I don&#x27;t have to use as much!</li>
      <li>Definitely tans you and quicker than most do.</li>
      <li>If smells so pretty before and after.</li>
      <li>The only thing I&#x27;m not quite sure about is the smell.</li>
      <li>While I&#x27;m very impressed with how well it works, the scent is sort of weird.</li>
      <li>Smells really good even after a few hours went by.  </li>
      <li>i pretty much v deer by brown sugar</li>
      <li>It feels super soft and silky when you put it on.</li>
      <li>and i love that it isn&#x27;t super heavy.  </li>
      <li>but this one is very noticeable...</li>
      <li>I have my own stand-up bed and have used several different tanning lotions.</li>
      <li>i actually tried that one first and didn&#x27;t really get much result...</li>
      <li>I highly recommend this lotion.</li>
      <li>Just be sure you don&#x27;t rub up,against anything for a few hours.</li>
      <li>So i don&#x27;t normally leave these</li>
      <li>This lotion is one of the very few that help me tan more bronze</li>
      <li>It was almost as if the lotion was completely blocking the uv rays.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve only used this twice and really like it.</li>
      <li>Almost too potent if all you want is a subtle tan.</li>
      <li>and I noticed the first day after using the lotion I had a white streak down my right leg where I can only assume</li>
      <li>Left my skin feeling soft and well moisturized.  </li>
      <li>Anyway whatever they put in there makes you really dark, really fast!</li>
      <li>It smells kind of like vanilla but with a weird scent to it.</li>
      <li>Wouldn&#x27;t say it&#x27;s better or worse, just about the same as others, it worked.</li>
      <li>definitely doesn&#x27;t mean &amp;#34;better.&amp;#34;Stick with the original Island Princess.</li>

<li> My favorite lotion, but I hate paying 50+ for it at tanning salons.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I tried this product for 1 week using it everyday.  At end of week I noticed not much difference in color.  This product may work good for tanning beds but I would not recommend it for indoor tanning.</li>
    <li> great lotion! its smells great and leaves skin feeling amazing! I was a little hesitant to buy since some people said the lotion they ordered didn&#x27;t have a seal but this one comes with a seal</li>
    <li> Smells great and doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy feeling</li>
    <li> Works just as good as any other tanning lotion I&#x27;ve used. Wouldn&#x27;t say it&#x27;s better or worse, just about the same as others, it worked. Good price.</li>
    <li> My favorite lotion, but I hate paying 50+ for it at tanning salons. So happy I found this.</li>
    <li> Good price and really good product not crazy about the smell but it did what I wanted it to do.  Would do business with company again!</li>
    <li> I was really pale and started using this lotion at the tanning bed. I got great results quickly after using this lotion for just a couple of visits.</li>
    <li> This lotion was a waste of money..... Smh I was skeptical about buying lotion online and I see now why I should have trusted my gut.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t think I tanned as well as I have with other products, but for about $20 it did the job I started out using this after not tanning for awhile so it helped build my base tan. Wasn&#x27;t really wowed but the scent either, but it wasn&#x27;t bad.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t tan easily and I got a nice tan from using this! I highly recommend this lotion. Smells great!</li>
    <li> I have been tanning for a year now. I needed to get a new lotion because I wasn&#x27;t able to plateau anymore with the lotion I used for over 6 months. This lotion sucks!! I barley changed color. It was almost as if the lotion was completely blocking the uv rays. Seriously don&#x27;t buy this!!</li>
    <li> I like this because it does not leave you feeling greasy or have a bad smell and also has a nice bronzer in it.  I have my own stand-up bed and have used several different tanning lotions. This is definately a good one for the price.</li>
    <li> I have always liked the Tan inc tanning lotions and this one is a good lotion to use I will order again</li>
    <li> This is the best tanning lotion Ive ever used amd I have bn tanning in tanning beds at the befinnong of every summer for 20 years now. This doesnt stain you and smells awesome even after you tan. Ive not had dry skin evwr when Ive uaed this one and it doesnt turn you orange.</li>
    <li> Island princess is Much more effective!New definitely doesn&#x27;t mean &amp;#34;better.&amp;#34;Stick with the original Island Princess.It also doesn&#x27;t smell as good as I.P. either,Big letdown.It doesn&#x27;t get me as dark.I go to the salon at least twice weekly and do the highest level beds too.</li>
    <li> I tan quit often and have tried several various different lotions and this is one of my favs! Definitely tans you and quicker than most do. I constantly have people asking me what lotion I use bc they can see the difference in my tan in such a short time! It smells great and it seems to spread easily so I don&#x27;t have to use as much!</li>
    <li> I tend to tan red, I&#x27;m fair complected and I can tan but it takes me awhile.. This lotion is one of the very few that help me tan more bronze and i love that it isn&#x27;t super heavy.  I&#x27;ve recommended it to several people and at this price it&#x27;s half of what I would normally pay for it.  The bottle \\&quot;should\\&quot;  last all summer,  you don&#x27;t have to apply a ton.</li>
    <li> This product is no joke. 88x bronzers and in two sessions, I&#x27;m darker than I would be had I tanned for a week without it. This is actually the highest bronzing lotion I&#x27;ve ever seen or used. While I&#x27;m very impressed with how well it works, the scent is sort of weird. Too many of these tanning companies are trading the wonderful &amp;#34;tanning lotion&amp;#34; scent in for something that smells like a 1980s musk. If it ain&#x27;t broke, don&#x27;t fix it!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another issue I had is that when I received this lotion, it was unsealed. I assumed the seal was torn off, so I called Tan Incorporated, who informed me that these lotions come like that. So, rest assured, your lotion wasn&#x27;t tampered with.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, I&#x27;m pretty satisfied. I just wish that the lotion came in a different scent.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used a heck of a lot of tanning lotions, but this one is incredible. After just 2 sessions I reached the peak color that it usually took me weeks to achieve with previous lotions. It&#x27;s that potent. Almost too potent if all you want is a subtle tan. I might switch off to something else for a while so I don&#x27;t turn black from using this every session. I wonder if this would work as a sunless self-tanning lotion as well? It absorbs instantly as a good lotion should. The texture is silky. It doesn&#x27;t leave streaks. The scent is lovely. It&#x27;s similar to Designer Skin Spellbound. Faint ATO that disappears completely after about 10 minutes. I&#x27;m not sure what the &#x27;88 bronzers&#x27; are. I don&#x27;t even think there are 88 items on the ingredient list. Anyway whatever they put in there makes you really dark, really fast!</li>
    <li> This lotion makes your skin feel so silky smooth and makes you tan so evenly. Great price for a great product!  I love this lotion!</li>
    <li> Great lotion! Smells great &amp; you tan super fast! Will definitely order this lotion again in the future. Great price too!</li>
    <li> So i don&#x27;t normally leave these but i have been tanning fairly consistently over the past year and have used several different lotions... i pretty much v deer by brown sugar but i try others too... right before i bought this it was between this of jwoww one and done... i actually tried that one first and didn&#x27;t really get much result... but this one is very noticeable... I&#x27;ve had compliments on my tan and this lotion smells great... i was really impressed and the evolve helps the tan longer so i keep those right out of the tanning bed looks for a good while... even when i forget to use my extender.</li>
    <li> Lotion is nice and works like its supposed to. Just be sure you don&#x27;t rub up,against anything for a few hours. I sit Indian style in my chair a lot and I noticed the first day after using the lotion I had a white streak down my right leg where I can only assume is where the lotion rubbed off from the chair. Let the bronzes soak in for a while.</li>
    <li> love this lotion. I have been tanning for my wedding and I was using a different lotion and I wasn&#x27;t seeing any results used this one for a week i saw so much color love it would definitely buy this again</li>
    <li> I used this last summer and loved it!!! The smell is GREAT and using this I&#x27;ve already got a good tan and I&#x27;ve only been tanning for about a week now!</li>
    <li> Received Saturday and just used it yesterday. Smells really good even after a few hours went by.  I have tried a ton of lotions and this gave me some immediate color.</li>
    <li> For me it was all about seeing results after the first tanning session. Well I do have to tell you it works. I have yet to use it more tan once a week, but I did see tanning results after the first session, &amp; smells good too and it doesn&#x27;t leave you feeling you have to shower right after. I would recommend.</li>
    <li> I recieved a sample of this when I bought a different lotion, and I LOVED it! I will be buying it as my next lotion.  The scent is light but sooooo great and unique.  I had ZERO \\&quot;after-tan\\&quot; smell when I used this lotion. The brozers were amazing as well.  I have blonde hair and medium skin but tan very well, and these bronzers were not orange-ish at all, but a perfect streak-free bronzey brown!  Well worth the money- I can&#x27;t wait to get more of this.</li>
    <li> This lotion is pretty good! It don&#x27;t steak, goes on really smooth, and has tanned me pretty good. The only thing I&#x27;m not quite sure about is the smell. It smells kind of like vanilla but with a weird scent to it. Overall it&#x27;s a pretty good lotion! I would recommend to try it! The only reason I rated it 4 stars was because the smell.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always tanned in the tanning bed and have a good base tan. For the two months before I bought this I was using Obsidian by Designer Skin. I was at the plateau by the time I finished that bottle and was looking for something more. I bought this bottle on impulse. 88 ELITE BRONZERS!!!! I purchased this on a Thursday and received that Saturday and did the FREE super saver shipping. Overall, the lotion is amazing. It feels super soft and silky when you put it on. It has a perfume scent that smells like something you would smell in a big department store. It is NOT an instant shades darker but throughout the day it seems to sink in and get a little darker. I&#x27;ve only used this twice and really like it. I would definitely buy it again.</li>
    <li> This lotion left me with a deep dark tan in just 4 tanning sessions.  The scent is awesome, not overwhelming.  Left my skin feeling soft and well moisturized.  I would recommend this lotion to anyone who wants a fast tan with awesome feeling skin.</li>
    <li> I love this tanning lotion! It is so awesome! If smells so pretty before and after. I have never had a lotion that didn&#x27;t stink after tanning but this one doesn&#x27;t at all! It gives awesome color within just a couple of sessions. It&#x27;s wonderful! Buy it!</li>
    <li> The item was sent promptly, so no issues there. However, the lotion was fake! I could have used regular body cream and had the same results!</li>
