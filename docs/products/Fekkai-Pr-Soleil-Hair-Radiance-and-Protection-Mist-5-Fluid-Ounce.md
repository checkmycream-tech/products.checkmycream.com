### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>I found the best way to use this product is in conjunction with Fekkai shampoo and conditioners.  </li>
      <li>This was the best look yet.  </li>
      <li>Delightful scent and not sticky.  </li>
      <li>The best part too is that it doesn&#x27;t leave the hair like moose does.</li>
      <li>Perfect sized bottle</li>
      <li>size is perfect for popping into my gym bag or travel</li>
      <li>The look was absolutely GORGEOUS!</li>
      <li>It smells good too!</li>
      <li>then this is a great product.</li>
      <li>and she is not as happy with it as I.</li>
      <li>You end up with a very nice  wavy, beachy hair look.  </li>
      <li>My beach waves still hold up after applying this on top, which is wonderful....</li>
      <li>The fragrance is delightful and it works great on my fine hair.</li>
      <li>It has a pleasant fragrance.</li>
      <li>Going for it again, years later with wonderful, great smelling Fekkai Soleil Beach&lt;br /&gt;Waves Spray!</li>
      <li>product is nice and smells good; however it does leave your hands</li>
      <li>Love this product!</li>
      <li>This spray is magical!</li>
      <li>We did manage to look stylish, surprisingly.</li>
      <li>&gt;  owns her OWN bottle of the spray.&lt;br</li>
      <li>When I think of beach waves (sea salt) sprays, I expect it to smell kind of like suntan lotion.  </li>
      <li>It has a nice citrus scent and gives lots of body.</li>
      <li>and I am confident that it will look good.</li>
      <li>The product goes on very easily.  </li>
      <li>So I&#x27;m so happy to see that braids and wavy mermaid hair are in right now.  </li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re looking for a good conditioner then try Fekkai Full Blown Volume.</li>
      <li>The scent is very nice, like a light sweet perfume.</li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>This is a fantastic product!  </li>
      <li>I have a feeling that if I tried to put it up in a bun after applying, it would be a bit more wavy.</li>
      <li>but then again most Fekkai products are a bit pricey.</li>
      <li>Therefore, I wanted to give this equally as reputable line a chance.</li>
      <li>I grew up on the beach and fell in love with the sun, sand, and water.</li>
      <li>It was ok</li>
      <li>Ever since I discovered Frederic Fekkai Full-Blown Volume Shampoo and Frederic Fekkai Full-Blown Volume Conditioner, my hair has never looked or felt better.</li>
      <li>Love the smell.</li>
      <li>I fully realize this is a product for the ladies, but as an oldster in his 80&#x27;s with a still healthy head of hair, I find this usable.  </li>
      <li>When flat[iron] was where it&#x27;s at, I just walked around unfashionable most of the time.  </li>
      <li>but I enjoy it!</li>
      <li>and it also felt a bit fuller (more volume).</li>
      <li>Enjoy!</li>
      <li>my hair needs a bit more product to get some shine.</li>
      <li>AND it has even more product in it).  </li>
      <li>I love it</li>
      <li>To be fair, I don&#x27;t think I have the right hair type for this product.</li>
      <li>The spray has a nice scent that is sweet and almost floral.  </li>
      <li>It makes my hair look nice, fresh and fuller.</li>
      <li>Great product, better price than Bumble and Bumble and the same results!</li>
      <li>Fekkai Soleil Beach Waves spray comes in a sleek package with an easy to dispense pump.  </li>
      <li>that&#x27;s easy to handle.&lt;br</li>
      <li>I like the bedhead look or easy going hair type style</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s just a bit strong for my tastes and lingers longer than I care for.</li>
      <li>This has an extremely strong perfume smell.  </li>
      <li>So, for adding a bit of &#x27;style&#x27; to your hair at the beach, this is a good option to look at, but because of the strong scent it isn&#x27;t one I would buy after this is used up - I am a bit scent sensitive, so others may enjoy it more.</li>
      <li>I use other Fekkai products and have always found them to be among the best hair products available.</li>
      <li>In the winter sans humidity it blowdries out nice and straight easily, but as soon as the humidity kicks in, forget it.</li>
      <li>Smells fantastic.</li>
      <li>* Light, non-greasy, invigorating mist; three to five pump sprays do the trick for my hair.&lt;br</li>
      <li>When my hair dries it looks fantastic.</li>
      <li>Wavy, smooth ...</li>
      <li>Also available on Amazon.</li>
      <li>The odor was fine - she reported it as &amp;#34;pleasant&amp;#34; and I had half-expected something nauseating but this was pleasant enough.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It&#x27;s gonna be a great summer all year long!</li>
      <li>, it smells good with a very light, clean fragrance and works well for that cute, messy hair beach look!</li>
      <li>At $20, it&#x27;s a bit pricy especially if you have longer hair, but overall, she was pleased and if she&#x27;s pleased, then I&#x27;m happy.</li>
      <li>And, for me, I liked the fragrance; however, I also enjoy fragrances in general.</li>
      <li>Fekkai Soleil Beach Waves Spray is a cool product.  </li>
      <li>oh, so nice for those super early wake-up</li>
      <li>I blow dry and style the top with bang or side sweep...casual and nice</li>
      <li>This one does and is so easy to use that I finally have a solution to spend just 1 minute on my hair and have it look nice from day 1.</li>
      <li>Says it takes the frizz right out immediately and it leaves her hair smooth and managed.</li>
      <li>My hair is pretty fine...</li>
      <li>I love Fekkai products and use their shampoo and conditioner almost daily (love some formulas,</li>
      <li>No frizz and not crazy volume, plus nice natural looking waves.</li>
      <li>Not only does my hair look great the first day, it still has a nice texture and no sticky feeling the next day as well.</li>
      <li>Now, I used a good deal of this product since my hair is long: maybe seven pumps.</li>
      <li>Other than that, I&#x27;m super pleased with how pretty my hair looks, and it&#x27;s a time saver for those situations when I want my hair to look nice but don&#x27;t have the time or energy to iron or curl it.</li>

      <li>Can leave like that or later lightly style a bit more for a polished look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>In the summer it&#x27;s a nice final touch to keep waves from getting tangly or frizzy.  </li>
      <li>My hair is left with a light, citrusy &amp;#34;tropical&amp;#34; scent that isn&#x27;t overwhelming.</li>
      <li>In about 30 min., the scent fades which is nice, I don&#x27;t like heavy or overwhelming</li>
      <li>The spray is lightly scented with a clean summer smell, sort of like Light Blue by D&amp;G or CK One Summer.</li>
      <li>I got this right before my trip to the beach.</li>
      <li>My better half used the spray for two weeks, and reported that the spray did the job for the most part and added a bit of curl to somewhat curly hair</li>
      <li>After shampooing &amp; conditioning my hair (and making sure the majority of the water is towel dried, this is an important step!)</li>
      <li>I applied this to my dry hair, scrunched the ends and had lots of nice bouncy curls</li>
      <li>It will leave your hair looking dry but in a nice controlled way.  </li>
      <li>The feminine scent is rather strong, but with an old geezer, who cares.  </li>
      <li>It worked ok using it that way, and seemed to hold the set better than just scrunching and letting it dry naturally.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used many different brands of sea salt sprays through the years.</li>
      <li>Overall, it&#x27;s worked way better than anything else I have tried.</li>
      <li>Me and my straight hair are jealous of you!</li>
      <li>fragrance is pretty subjective).  </li>
      <li>I would love to wash/condition, spray, scrunch and go, especially in summer time.</li>
      <li>but it&#x27;s pretty pricy.</li>
      <li>I look for ones that give my hair body, smell good and doesn&#x27;t leave my hair stiff.</li>
      <li>I have tried many similar products that don&#x27;t really work.</li>
      <li>I applied it to my wet/damp hair right after a shower and tried not to mess with it too much, it ended up drying with some nice waves.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t like much what it did with my bangs, but due to a cowlick my bangs have always had a mind of their own.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> I grew up on the beach and fell in love with the sun, sand, and water. This spray by hip Fekkai reminds me of messy curls  and lots of laughs with&lt;br /&gt;my friends. We did manage to look stylish, surprisingly. Going for it again, years later with wonderful, great smelling Fekkai Soleil Beach&lt;br /&gt;Waves Spray!</li>
    <li> This is a spray that says it will give you touchable, textured and tousled waves.&lt;br /&gt;The directions say to flip hair over and spray on dry or damp hair, scrunch and tousle to maximize and give volume - let dry in the St. Barths air. That part might be a bit difficult.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The product is nice and smells good; however it does leave your hands sticky.&lt;br /&gt;Quite frankly I did not notice much difference between flipping my hair over and tousling it myself and even a bit of hair spray can accomplish the same result and you do not have to go to St. Barths to dry it.</li>
    <li> It was ok but I expected more for the price of this item. I have a natural wave in my hair and it sounded like what I was looking for. I would love to wash/condition, spray, scrunch and go, especially in summer time. I have a common style of haircut, longer at the sides and top, but short in back. I usually dry it with a brush/dryer that forms the style. It worked ok using it that way, and seemed to hold the set better than just scrunching and letting it dry naturally.</li>
    <li> I have short wavy hair that has started to thin out over the years.  As my hair grows it tends to get frizzy and &amp;#34;fro&amp;#34; out whenever the humidity rises.  I tried this Fekkai product with the hope of taming my hair in that situation.  The product goes on very easily.  The spray has a nice scent that is sweet and almost floral.  Keep in mind that this does have sea salt and sunflower oil in it.  It will leave your hair looking dry but in a nice controlled way.  The downside to this product is that it did appear to strip away some of the color in my dyed hair.  Another negative is that this is rather expensive but then again most Fekkai products are a bit pricey. Other than that if you are looking for a way to get a dry look without the frizz then this is a great product.</li>
    <li> So far I really like this product. It makes my hair look nice, fresh and fuller. I have long, wavy hairs and usually they curl easily. With Fekkai &amp;#34;beach effect&amp;#34; is stronger and lasts longer. It&#x27;s just a simple and quick way to add something extra to your everyday look. Recommended!</li>
    <li> My hair is normally naturally wavy, but some days it is flat, so I thought this product would be a good alternative to gel or other products. It did not make any difference on my hair at all. So I asked a friend with straight hair to use it, and I did see some waves compared to how it usually looks. However, when following the directions to let the hair air dry, it left her hair very sticky and uncomfortable. She would not use it again, even for the wavy effect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, just not did not live up to its premise for a natural look and feel.</li>
    <li> I have long (about mid back), thick, slightly wavy hair. I use a comparable product by Bumble and Bumble ([[ASIN:B000BIXP5I Bumble and Bumble Surf Spray, 4-Ounce Bottle]]) but it&#x27;s pretty pricy. Therefore, I wanted to give this equally as reputable line a chance. Now, I applied it to freshly washed and conditioned, damp and brushed hair. I did as one reviewer suggested: twisted my hair into a bun atop my head (and secured it with a band). I wait about 20 minutes and unfurled my hair ... good grief, panic! It was wet-looking and almost curly. It looked like one of those &amp;#34;wet&amp;#34; sprays my brother used in the 1990&#x27;s. Still, I refused to be discouraged since my hair was still damp. I waited about another 20 minutes, unfurled my hair again, and ran my fingers through it repeatedly. The look was absolutely GORGEOUS! It was bouncy, all that excess shine dried-out, the waves were pronounced but unstructured ... PERFECTION! I even asked my better half what he thought. And, coming from a guy who generally doesn&#x27;t care about such things, he literally said (while scrunching it in his hands), &amp;#34;Wow. Wavy, smooth ... nice!&amp;#34; That&#x27;s high praise!  Now, I used a good deal of this product since my hair is long: maybe seven pumps. And, the results are easily worth the cost (especially since it is cheaper than Bumble and Bumble AND it has even more product in it).  And, for me, I liked the fragrance; however, I also enjoy fragrances in general. Even after it dries, there is still a slightly perfumey smell ... but I enjoy it! (Of course, I can also understand if some folks don&#x27;t like it ... fragrance is pretty subjective).  Great product, better price than Bumble and Bumble and the same results! This product&#x27;s a winner all around!</li>
    <li> I got this right before my trip to the beach. I really like how it make my hair wavy and gave it shine as well. I like the bedhead look or easy going hair type style this give you.</li>
    <li> Smells fantastic. Not sure if its any better than drug store brands. Three spritz makes my long blonde hair nice and shiny without being oily.  Its does not make my straight hair wavy but holds the loose waves well after I iron or hot roll my hair.</li>
    <li> Love this product! The fragrance is delightful and it works great on my fine hair. My daughter in law has thicker, coarser hair and she is not as happy with it as I.</li>
    <li> This is a fantastic product!  If you want to have the wavy hair without a lot of maintenance, then this is the product for you.</li>
    <li> Overall, I like this product. It does add fullness and waviness. My hair is short/medium and thick, and I like it to be a bit curly and have some volume, especially if I&#x27;m overdue for a trim. I do find I have to shampoo more often than I usually do (color-treated hair). It has a pleasant fragrance. I use other Fekkai products and have always found them to be among the best hair products available.</li>
    <li> For once I&#x27;ve found a volumizing product that doesn&#x27;t make my hair dull looking! This product gives my hair enough volume to look like I have a normal amount of hair and leaves it with some shine. I have hair that is totally straight and limp, and so have no curl to enhance, but this product worked well when I sprayed it on and then used a curling iron when it was almost dry. Held the  curl for quite a while without looking like I&#x27;d used hair spray. Really like it.</li>
    <li> good beach waves on wet or dry hair</li>
    <li> I fully realize this is a product for the ladies, but as an oldster in his 80&#x27;s with a still healthy head of hair, I find this usable.  The feminine scent is rather strong, but with an old geezer, who cares.  My hair has always had a bit of a wave to it, and this product does well in maintaining that.  Recommended.</li>
    <li> This is one of the products that is life changing and so I had to write a review about it. I have tried many similar products that don&#x27;t really work. This one does and is so easy to use that I finally have a solution to spend just 1 minute on my hair and have it look nice from day 1. I have naturally wavy hair, but after washing it it has too much volume and frizz to wear it down. With this product I can let it dry naturally without putting it up and I am confident that it will look good. No frizz and not crazy volume, plus nice natural looking waves. The best part too is that it doesn&#x27;t leave the hair like moose does. It leaves it soft. It&#x27;s not crunchy or wet looking. Also you wont&#x27; really smell it so that&#x27;s a plus. I definitely recommend it. You can always try it with the travel size that is also sold here on Amazon. Enjoy!</li>
    <li> This hair spray goes on smoothly and leaves my hair soft with slight waviness given my short hair. What I like most is my hair looks alive with a slight shine and not dry like most hair sprayer I&#x27;ve used in the past. I have mostly grey hair but lots of it, gray can be on the dry side and kinky too, this Fekkai Soleil Beach Waves hair Spray helps keep my hair in place. The oils in this spray darken and shine. It smells good too!</li>
    <li> My hair is really straight and the only &amp;#34;wave&amp;#34; it&#x27;s ever had came from a permanent.  But I have been using a Fructis wave enhancing spray as a blow-dry styling aid so I thought this product might work in that respect too.&lt;br /&gt;The instructions say to spray this on your damp hair, &amp;#34;tousel&amp;#34; and leave it to air dry.  I have to blow dry my hair to get it to have any style, and this spray worked well to give my round brush a little more &amp;#34;grab&amp;#34; during that process, which is just what I&#x27;m looking for.  It never made my hair feel stiff or greasy. The scent is pleasant, very delicate and not noticeable once dried.  I think if you are lucky enough to have a natural wave or curl to your hair, this would work well to define and smooth those.  Me and my straight hair are jealous of you!</li>
    <li> I use spray in my hair for two main reasons: When it&#x27;s dry to smooth it down and add some semblance of style, or when it&#x27;s wet to help hold my natural curls together. Spraying this on my dry hair has been a disaster every time I&#x27;ve tried it. It makes my hair feel sticky and really unappealing, and it looks worse. However, putting it on my wet hair is GREAT!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I have natural curls that tend to fall apart into fluffy layers if I look at them cross-eyed but I don&#x27;t always have time (or the desire) to do the whole gel-scrunch-diffuse dry-hairspray routine. I spray this all over my wet hair right out of the shower (no combing) and then scrunch my curls into place and let my hair air dry. Not only does my hair look great the first day, it still has a nice texture and no sticky feeling the next day as well. The spray is lightly scented with a clean summer smell, sort of like Light Blue by D&amp;G or CK One Summer.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m actually fairly surprised at the curl I got at the ends, if there&#x27;s any whiff of an old perm left at the ends that&#x27;s from a long time ago. I applied this to my dry hair, scrunched the ends and had lots of nice bouncy curls and it also felt a bit fuller (more volume). I don&#x27;t like much what it did with my bangs, but due to a cowlick my bangs have always had a mind of their own. So, for adding a bit of &#x27;style&#x27; to your hair at the beach, this is a good option to look at, but because of the strong scent it isn&#x27;t one I would buy after this is used up - I am a bit scent sensitive, so others may enjoy it more. It&#x27;s just a bit strong for my tastes and lingers longer than I care for. YMMV.</li>
    <li> Fekkai Soleil Beach Waves Spray is a cool product.  I have really long, thick, wavy hair that takes a long time to style every morning, if I want it to be &amp;#34;styled.&amp;#34;  When flat[iron] was where it&#x27;s at, I just walked around unfashionable most of the time.  So I&#x27;m so happy to see that braids and wavy mermaid hair are in right now.  I was skeptical about how well this product would really work in my hair, and how long it would hold. I have to use a lot of product in my hair to make it mind.  I don&#x27;t necessarily follow the directions on the bottle.  I comb this product through damp hair, dry with a diffuser for a few minutes, then do a couple braids, which I keep in my hair for the day. When I get tired of the braids, my hair is usually dry-ish, and I take the braids out and am left with glorious mermaid waves for evening.  My hair is shiny and not crunchy.  I&#x27;m pleasantly surprised by how well this product performs!</li>
    <li> Works really well for my hair, which typically has not done well with all the different types of products I have tried. Most dry and make my hair feel crunchy, but this one dries with my hair much softer. I applied it to my wet/damp hair right after a shower and tried not to mess with it too much, it ended up drying with some nice waves. I have a feeling that if I tried to put it up in a bun after applying, it would be a bit more wavy. Overall, it&#x27;s worked way better than anything else I have tried.</li>
    <li> I have fine textured, thick, straight and heavily highlighted hair.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have used this product two ways.&lt;br /&gt;First, after washing and drying to damp, turn my head over, spray, turn my head back, spray and finger hair...scunching and scrunching.  I blow dry and style the top with bang or side sweep...casual and nice results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second, my preferred special way: blow dry my hair as usual, styling, then add the Fekkai spray as before and scrunch.  Can leave like that or later lightly style a bit more for a polished look.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The spray gives my hair fullness that lasts in either case without build up...as if you applied nothing to hair...absolutely no residue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Great product!</li>
    <li> I found the best way to use this product is in conjunction with Fekkai shampoo and conditioners.  So after you shampoo and condition your hair, towel dry it and spritz away, then scrunch your hair and go sit in the sun.  You end up with a very nice  wavy, beachy hair look.  I have long hair, with natural waves and using this product, really brings out the textures of my hair.  I love it, it smells good with a very light, clean fragrance and works well for that cute, messy hair beach look!</li>
    <li> Disappointing for me. I tried this product three times, following the directions exactly. It didn&#x27;t give me beach waves, it just made me look like I just rolled out of bed. To be fair, I don&#x27;t think I have the right hair type for this product. My hair is pretty fine...my friend tried it too, she has thicker hair with just a slight wave and it worked better, but still not what you would expect. Plus this product is very sticky, didnt like at all how it made my hair feel. Again, disappointing...I was really hoping for beach waves, not bed head.</li>
    <li> I adore this beach spray because I have been using it to revive my second day curls (3B-3C naturally curly hair here) without weighing my hair down. I dampen my hair with water from a spray bottle, then I spray this through and scrunch. 15-20 minutes later, my curls have started to spring back up! It does say that it is citrus scented, but I have never noticed a scent any time I&#x27;ve used it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why only 4 stars? The cost. I have fairly long hair and so I have to use quite a bit to get it sprayed through my hair evenly. So, at almost $19, this product isn&#x27;t really cost-effective for me. (I&#x27;ve uploaded a picture so you can see my revived curls.)</li>
    <li> Fekkai Soleil Beach Waves spray comes in a sleek package with an easy to dispense pump.  The scent is pleasant, not overpowering and while it doesn&#x27;t quite sweep you away onto a beachy vacay, the experience is adding a little extra texture to the ends of my naturally curly hair.  In the summer it&#x27;s a nice final touch to keep waves from getting tangly or frizzy.  I haven&#x27;t yet tried it in beachy conditions and at 5 oz. it&#x27;s a bit too large to take in carry on for vacations.</li>
    <li> This has an extremely strong perfume smell.  I expected something beachy smelly but no.  I had to put a lot on my hair to see if I could produce any result but all that happened is it got stronger smelling.  I didn&#x27;t notice a difference at all but I live in a humid climate not sure if that made a difference.  I don&#x27;t generally leave reviews but needed to with this one.  I used so much product seeing if I could get it to work that I am not really able to return it I don&#x27;t think.  I will empty it out and use the empty container so I won&#x27;t feel as though I have completely wasted my money.</li>
    <li> My wife has long thick straight hair and apparently Fekkai Soleil Beach Wave Spray was designed for curly hair. Even so, she loves it. Says it takes the frizz right out immediately and it leaves her hair smooth and managed. The scent is very nice, like a light sweet perfume. It doesn&#x27;t smell like the beach (which is what I would have expected). The bottle is a bit large to carry around in a small purse but my wife has found room.  Spray goes on heavy so only a little is needed. If you&#x27;re looking for a good conditioner then try Fekkai Full Blown Volume. Also available on Amazon. My wife swears by it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highly recommended</li>
    <li> Delightful scent and not sticky.  My hair is shoulder length and thick.  I used quite a bit of it on my damp hair scrunching from mid shaft to the end.  It didn&#x27;t hold the scrunch as well as I would have like it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I pulled my hair baack, I could see the lift and it looked good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I deducted a star because I was not a able to work with this and wear my hair down.  It looked uneven and messy.</li>
    <li> When I think of beach waves (sea salt) sprays, I expect it to smell kind of like suntan lotion.  This Fekkai Soleil Beach Waves Spray does not.  It has a perfume like smell that I personally don&#x27;t care for.  It&#x27;s all in taste, though.  I love Fekkai products and use their shampoo and conditioner almost daily (love some formulas, dislike others).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have natural blond hair with some bleach highlights.  My hair has natural wave, but I usually just dry it straight and flat iron it.  Sometimes I like to wear it wavy, but it can be work to make it not look fuzzy.  I first tried this beach waves spray on wet hair after washing it.  I let it air dry.  The curls kept a wet look.  I did not like that. Next time I used a hair dryer on low and scrunched with my hands.  This looked nicer than air drying. Next time I dried my hair until it was damp and then sprayed it with the beach spray and scrunched while finishing drying.  This was the best look yet.  I would give it 5 stars if it looked better air dried and also smelled &amp;#34;beachy&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used many different brands of sea salt sprays through the years. I look for ones that give my hair body, smell good and doesn&#x27;t leave my hair stiff. This spray by Fekkai, meets all the requirements. It has a nice citrus scent and gives lots of body. There&#x27;s another brand I like a little better because it works well and is cheaper.</li>
    <li> When you live in the Midwest, having &amp;#34;beach hair&amp;#34; is a luxury, so naturally, you&#x27;ll do anything to emulate it. My better half used the spray for two weeks, and reported that the spray did the job for the most part and added a bit of curl to somewhat curly hair (3A.) The odor was fine - she reported it as &amp;#34;pleasant&amp;#34; and I had half-expected something nauseating but this was pleasant enough. The hair to me looked nicer but I couldn&#x27;t articulate why, but she reported that her hair had a shine to it. The only downside, according to her, was the slight stickiness of the spray. At $20, it&#x27;s a bit pricy especially if you have longer hair, but overall, she was pleased and if she&#x27;s pleased, then I&#x27;m happy.</li>
    <li> I have naturally coarse, slightly wavy hair that tends to frizz, especially in humid weather. This product allows my hair to fall into nice, soft &amp;#34;beach waves&amp;#34; that have movement but are less defined than using a waving iron (or a permed look). After shampooing &amp; conditioning my hair (and making sure the majority of the water is towel dried, this is an important step!) I spritz the Fekkai Beach Waves onto my hair and SCRUNCH. I find that turning upside down and giving the hair underneath several good scrunches with this product works really well on my long hair, and gives it extra fullness, especially at the crown. I spend a little extra time scrunching my ends so that they have a nice soft curl to them as well. When my hair dries it looks fantastic. The ends have the same look as when I&#x27;ve freshly trimmed my hair. My hair is left with a light, citrusy &amp;#34;tropical&amp;#34; scent that isn&#x27;t overwhelming. In about 30 min., the scent fades which is nice, I don&#x27;t like heavy or overwhelming scents.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; I LOVE that this product doesn&#x27;t dry out my parched hair, which has always been an issue with other salt sprays. My favorite has been a spray made by Schwartzkopf, but I can only use it for about 4 days maximum, and my hair starts feeling dry and my scalp is itchy. I have a medical condition that causes my hair and scalp to be dry so I&#x27;m sensitive to products that perhaps other people can use without a problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For a bit of shine, I apply the Fekkai Pre-Soleil (Sunscreen for hair), another product I adore in this same line. My beach waves still hold up after applying this on top, which is wonderful....my hair needs a bit more product to get some shine. These 2 products in addition to the Fekkai Shea Hair Masque have my hair looking beautiful during the hot, dry days of Summer (an exciting thought since it usually is a bundle of frizz that I must braid to control).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This size is perfect for popping into my gym bag or travel but I&#x27;d like an even larger size for regular use. I have waist length, thick hair that requires a fair amount of product regardless of what I&#x27;m using. That&#x27;s the only drawback for me. I use at least 4-6 sprays on my hair + 3 for the ends after a fresh wash (less on dry hair), so I probably will go through this product fairly quickly. Other than that, I&#x27;m super pleased with how pretty my hair looks, and it&#x27;s a time saver for those situations when I want my hair to look nice but don&#x27;t have the time or energy to iron or curl it. Highly recommended!use. I have waist length, thick hair that requires a fair amount of product regardless of what I&#x27;m using. That&#x27;s the only drawback for me.

    <li> In past reviews, I&#x27;ve had my share of hissy fits about my limp, fine hair...blah, blah, blah. I haven&#x27;t ranted and raved for a while, so I figured it&#x27;s high time to do so. Then, I realized that the complaint box is empty, empty! Ever since I discovered Frederic Fekkai Full-Blown Volume Shampoo and Frederic Fekkai Full-Blown Volume Conditioner, my hair has never looked or felt better. I will never switch; not after trying hundreds of brands that never came close to the dynamite results that these Fekkai products provide.&lt;br /&gt;That said, when I saw Fekkai Soleil Beach Waves Spray, I grabbed it. My hair is short and, no, I don&#x27;t particularly desire waves, but my association with the Fekkai brand spoke \\&quot;volumes.\\&quot; After using the spray, I conclude this product is right in line with my other two Fekkai products. Five-star, hands-down review, this spray is gold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;THUMBS UP:&lt;br /&gt;* Light, non-greasy, invigorating mist; three to five pump sprays do the trick for my hair.&lt;br /&gt;* Soft, subtle, natural aroma...oh, so nice for those super early wake-up calls.&lt;br /&gt;* Aesthetically pleasing packaging with a smile-y, orang-y, citrus-y look; summer written all over it!&lt;br /&gt;* Perfect sized bottle that&#x27;s easy to handle.&lt;br /&gt;* Adds volume and bounce to my hair and makes one-shot styling possible, each and every time. (In the past, I&#x27;ve found that even super-expensive products weigh my hair down.)&lt;br /&gt;* Adds curls galore to my daughter&#x27;s thick hair...I thought I had misplaced Fekkai Soleil Beach Waves Spray, only to find it among HER styling products. After some \\&quot;hairfare,\\&quot; we had a truce, and she now&lt;br /&gt;  owns her OWN bottle of the spray.&lt;br /&gt;* Better than a dry shampoo; when I miss a shampoo, I wet my hair, a spritz or two from the spray, a little styling, and my hair looks great.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NITTY-GRITTY:&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s gonna be a great summer all year long!</li>
    <li> Love the smell. Like you just went to the beach!</li>
    <li> This spray is magical! My hair is thick with just a bit of natural texture. In the winter sans humidity it blowdries out nice and straight easily, but as soon as the humidity kicks in, forget it. It just gets bigger and bigger. I spray this on, finger style and let air dry. It works with the natural texture to tame it without being stiff, sticky, or too done. Love it.</li>
    <li> Really hated this spray. Wanted to use it on my dry hair for beachy waves. All it did was drench it in water.....that&#x27;s what it felt like. Left my hair looking like a wet mess. No body whatsoever. Boo!</li>
