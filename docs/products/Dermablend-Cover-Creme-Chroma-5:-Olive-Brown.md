      <li>I wish this seller had more of my color (Chroma 5: Olive Brown) as I purchased two containers from another seller that I need to throw in the trash.  </li>
      <li>but I would love to try another shade.</li>
      <li>I love it.</li>
      <li>I am brown skin and this did not go with my complexion, it made me look too light!</li>
      <li>I have shared my secret of beautiful skin with many friends and family who were impressed with it.</li>
      <li>I have ordered this product for my Mom from this vendor and have consistently gotten good results.  </li>
      <li>The service is good, fast and the product has always met my Mom&#x27;s expectations.</li>
      <li>You have to make sure this is your skin tone, I am surprised it matched mine amazingly and more</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t settle into fine lines.</li>
      <li>The photographed color is accurate.</li>

      <li>Received super fast!</li>
      <li>The product is great just hard to get the right shade shopping online.</li>
      <li>Will definitely use this seller again if they get more of my color in this product.</li>
      <li>I looked a hot mess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>giving me a very even skin tone.</li>
      <li>As of today, this seller&#x27;s asking price is a real deal in this color.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s not the real thing, it&#x27;s a knockoff with just a sticker with the name derma blend on it, really</li>
      <li>Then I ended up with very pronounced lines underneath my eyes, because all those layers of concealer caked as the day worn on....</li>
      <li>I feel quite hopeful and believe I will see some real results over time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It feels so good to apply foundation to my face...and not have to give extra attention to the dark circles.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s working better than any product I&#x27;ve purchased to get rid of  dark circles.  </li>
      <li>but it decent as a face foundation.</li>
      <li>I recently started using fresh lemon juice and almond oil.  </li>
      <li>/&gt;Before ordering on Amazon, I went into a local dept store and found the right color for me.</li>
      <li>This is my new foundation</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s very natural looking.</li>
      <li>They were individually wrapped and exactly the color I wear.  </li>
      <li>As far as the darkness goes, I saw improvement after just one application.  </li>
      <li>I use it as a concealer and it covers completely in one application.  </li>
      <li>If used as a foundation, this is expensive, but for anyone that has numerous dark spots and a lot of uneveness in their skintone, this is a great product and may be worth the cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>The full coverage doesn&#x27;t produce a mask like look...not in the least.</li>

    <li> best cover crème for my skin, gives great coverage which last even when swimming and great sun protection.  I have shared my secret of beautiful skin with many friends and family who were impressed with it.</li>
    <li> I purchased two bottles and they arrived sooner than I expected.  They were individually wrapped and exactly the color I wear.  If you do not know your color from past experience with Derma-Blend, you will be in trouble.  I wish this seller had more of my color (Chroma 5: Olive Brown) as I purchased two containers from another seller that I need to throw in the trash.  Great product, great service. Will definitely use this seller again if they get more of my color in this product.</li>
    <li> I have ordered this product for my Mom from this vendor and have consistently gotten good results.  The service is good, fast and the product has always met my Mom&#x27;s expectations.</li>
    <li> This cream comes on the skin very smooth....it&#x27;s not clumpy and it doesn&#x27;t have an odor that would cause any irritation to the skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; It&#x27;s a Great Product!!!</li>
    <li> Great coverage. Arrived promptly.</li>
    <li> This product delivers on everything it says. Only very little is needed for coverage.  I used it to cover dark circle around my eyes. Add a tinted moisturizer and that all you need.  Great or summertime when you want the no makeup look.</li>
    <li> Great delivery time. Product is what it is. Unfortunately it was way too dark for my skin but I would love to try another shade. The product is great just hard to get the right shade shopping online. Wish they had samples.  Too expensive to continue to purchase in hopes of getting the shade you need</li>
    <li> Received super fast! Great product! Highly recommend for the serious closet makeup artist.</li>
    <li> I had done a lot of research on this product and although the jar is small you get a large amount with one swipe. The color isnt dark enough to cover my scars but i like to use it on my face. It doesnt make it look flawless but it a big improvement from no make up or my other foundations. Its not creamy like i thought it would be but it decent as a face foundation.</li>
    <li> Not what I expected. It&#x27;s like clay.came on time tho</li>
    <li> I have vittilego this is the only product that works for me. It is hard to find this cover in my area, so thanks Amazon for the hook up!</li>
    <li> I have tried several colors and still, none that matches my skin tone! I am brown skin and this did not go with my complexion, it made me look too light! Good if you can find the right shade!</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s not the real thing, it&#x27;s a knockoff with just a sticker with the name derma blend on it, really</li>
    <li> You have to make sure this is your skin tone, I am surprised it matched mine amazingly and more, it is great coverage, works great with the setting powder as a finish for all day coverage..... Hallelulah, I would and certainly do recommend, better than cover girl or any make up I have been used to. Happy Newyear All Reading this and treat your self to the best, Dermablend is beyond the best it is the Greatest.</li>
    <li> I have dark circles... raccoon eyes. The darkness had gotten so bad, I couldn&#x27;t find a concealer that covered them, without piling on the layers. Then I ended up with very pronounced lines underneath my eyes, because all those layers of concealer caked as the day worn on....I looked a hot mess.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; This product is great.  I use it as a concealer and it covers completely in one application.  The product doesn&#x27;t settle into the lines.  It has a smooth, lightweight consistency, without being shiny. Neither is it too matte and dry looking. No caking and creasing after wearing all day. It just looks like my skin. With this cover creme, you don&#x27;t need to go to a lighter shade. I chose a shade that matches my skin and it covers my dark circles completely...giving me a very even skin tone. Needless to say, I feel much better and spend less time on my makeup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This cover creme is marketed as a foundation, but it works great as a concealer. The container is very small, but a little goes a long way.  If used as a foundation, this is expensive, but for anyone that has numerous dark spots and a lot of uneveness in their skintone, this is a great product and may be worth the cost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before ordering on Amazon, I went into a local dept store and found the right color for me. The creme retails for 35.00. As of today, this seller&#x27;s asking price is a real deal in this color. My skin tone is about the same as a brown paper bag. The Olive Brown works well. The photographed color is accurate. Processing and delivery was super speedy and the seller even included a couple of free gifts.  Thank you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One last note, My dark circles are beginning to improve. I recently started using fresh lemon juice and almond oil.  In the mornings I pat a little lemon juice on the dark circles, let it dry and apply my makeup, Before bed, I use the almond oil. It&#x27;s working better than any product I&#x27;ve purchased to get rid of  dark circles.  Care is needed to prevent any juice from getting into the eyes, but I haven&#x27;t had any skin irritation from the lemon juice. To the contrary, the skin around my eyes is improving. As far as the darkness goes, I saw improvement after just one application.  I feel quite hopeful and believe I will see some real results over time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UPDATE:  One day I decide to apply the cover creme as my foundation.  I love it. My skin looks great with this foundation and feels great, too. The formula feels weightless. It doesn&#x27;t settle into fine lines. The full coverage doesn&#x27;t produce a mask like look...not in the least. It&#x27;s very natural looking. It covers so well only a small amount is needed. It feels so good to apply foundation to my face...and not have to give extra attention to the dark circles. It completely covers the small facial scar I have, too.  This is an excellent product.  This is my new foundation and I&#x27;m willing to pay full price for it. It&#x27;s great product, but I wish Dermablend included an application brush or sponge. If you don&#x27;t already have makeup sponges or a foundation brush, you have to use your fingers to apply.</li>
    <li> Dermablend Cover crème looks like it has bacteria growing in it.</li>
    <li> Color doesn&#x27;t match and doesn&#x27;t cover</li>
    <li> Dermablend is a trusted product that i have being using for years. Its stays on even in beach water, you can also apply sunscreen.</li>
