      <li>I really love this stuff.</li>
      <li>I had to order 2 more jars.  </li>
      <li>I love both of these products.</li>
      <li>coughdrops, honey, antiseptic creme, and more.  </li>
      <li>My skin is so oily that most night creams just broke it out.</li>
      <li>When I graduated and moved away from home, my skin magically cleared up.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s moisturizing my skin, I love the smell</li>
      <li>I cannot wait to see the results as more time goes by.</li>
      <li>I am so glad I did.</li>
      <li>We all love the smell, how it makes our skin feel, healing properties, etc.  </li>
      <li>I am so pleased with this cream.</li>
      <li>I think this may be best used as just a &amp;#34;spot treatment&amp;#34; or to help smooth/even out blemish spots only.</li>
      <li>I woke up every morning to better and better looking skin.</li>
      <li>It has made me want to use more skincare products with Manuka Honey in it... :)</li>
      <li>Great company, fast service.</li>
      <li>I love coconut oil, and also saw this as an ingredient.</li>
      <li>I tried to stick it out, thinking maybe I&#x27;d get used to the smell, but I got so many complaints from my family that I had to go wash my face.  </li>
      <li>I have been using it for a week and love the results.</li>
      <li>I wish it came with more product for the price.</li>
      <li>For healthy, acne-free skin, just say no to fried foods</li>
      <li>Love It.</li>
      <li>So far so good!  </li>
      <li>I was expecting amazing results because of the 5 star reviews, but for me it&#x27;s actually not all that great.</li>
      <li>I luckily came across this cream on amazon and decided to give a try after reading the amazing reviews.</li>
      <li>and the scent was too strong for me to be able to sleep comfortably.&lt;br /&gt;all</li>
      <li>/&gt;It has been 9 months since I wrote the above comment and have found my jar of this product again, and this time I have been very good at</li>
      <li>I love this alos because my skin is oily and this cream does not make my skin oily, it absorbs into the skin quickly.</li>
      <li>This lotion, though it smells a bit strong, actually helps shrink the inflammation associated with the cystic acne and is a great preventative product.</li>
      <li>but I think that gives it fantastic hydrating properties for acne prone skin.</li>
      <li>My skin is smooth and acne scars are disappearing from my face.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>/&gt;It is a tad pricey, but it&#x27;s more than worth it</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s still a tad more colorful than it should be, but even that is fading.</li>
      <li>It absorbed well into my skin, wore well under my mineral makeup, and gave me a smooth, dewy/glowy face all day (not oily!).</li>
      <li>did however wake up with smooth skin.</li>
      <li>Even with having some not so great foods over the holidays (french fries and buttered movie popcorn).</li>
      <li>It is a light moisturizer and doesn&#x27;t leave your face oily</li>
      <li>Also, shipping was fast and nicely packaged.</li>
      <li>Absolutely a fantastic product.</li>
      <li>it had free shipping for the amount you get.  </li>
      <li>Works good on skin problems because it has a natural antibiotics in it.</li>
      <li>Overall it is a very gentle product, probably best for mild acne and spot treatment.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve been using it for about two weeks now, and am very satisfied that it is clearing up any blemishes that I had/preventing new ones from occurring.</li>
      <li>I have not had a single eruption of either variety since I first dabbed on this wonderful Manuka honey skin cream.</li>
      <li>I original purchased the item when it was in the glass jar.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Love Love Love this product! It is a light moisturizer and doesn&#x27;t leave your face oily it helps with acne and dark spots.</li>
    <li> I was disappointed that it didn&#x27;t do much to help my skin.  It didn&#x27;t make my skin worse, but it didn&#x27;t improve my skin either, so I&#x27;m giving it 3 stars.  It&#x27;s possible that it works for others&#x27; skin and not mine because my skin is stubborn, so I&#x27;m not completely writing it off. I used it for a couple of months, however, and did not notice a significant difference in my skin.  It moisturized my skin though, and for me, that became its main purpose.  Not clearing my skin, as implied in \\&quot;SKIN CLEAR CREAM.\\&quot;</li>
    <li> Rose Hip Oil and Skin Clear Cream from NZ Fusion Botanicals  I love both of these products. I have used them for about 3 weeks now and can really tell a difference in my skin. I am 61 and have just a few wrinkles, but this product has made my skin so much softer. I have always been acne prone, but my skin is smooth and soft now. One of my daughters lives in Australia and she had told me how good the products were from New Zealand, so when I found this company, I ordered them right away. Cannot believe the difference in my skin in such a short time.My skin is so oily that most night creams just broke it out. I use both these products morning and night. They are perfect under my bare minerals powder and stay all day. Thank goodness for my daughter&#x27;s recommendation and the fact that I found this company. I cannot wait to see the results as more time goes by. Also, I received my products within 3 days. Even though both products are in small bottles, you only use a very small amount, so they will last a long time. My eternal thanks!!!Amazon seems to always have what I am looking for!</li>
    <li> Works very well as a moisturizer and an acne medication.  Helps to prevent and diminish acne very effectively.  The only reason I did not give it a five star rating is because I find the smell to be somewhat off-putting - not bad, just odd and potent - and because the texture was slightly grainy - still, it goes on pretty smoothly and absorbs nicely into the skin.  As a man, there is no way I would use it during the day, but as a night treatment for inflamed, dry, and acne-prone skin, it works very well.</li>
    <li> This was purchased with 100% pure east cape manuka oil, the 18+ manuka honey and the manuka honey propolis soap. After doing research for a few months I committed to buying these so called acne clearing items. On week six and this skin clear cream still have not cleared my skin. I am a 29yo African american female with a history of acne and this do not seem to  be working  for my skin. I figure I will continue to use this expensive jar of cream since it expires march of next year. This cream has a mild smell I believe from the manuka, therefore put it on a while before you plan to leave the house. I do like the different oils it has in it which is a plus. I will not buy another jar when this is done.</li>
    <li> I have seen a lot of improvement in my stubborn adult acne since using this. I have tried everything, and this seems to be helping. I feel good knowing this product is natural, and not harsh so it won&#x27;t irritate my skin further.</li>
    <li> This is a nice moisturizer. It didn&#x27;t help with acne as much as I had hoped it would (I&#x27;ve only been using it for a few weeks though), but it&#x27;s still a good moisturizer. This is a nice alternative to store-bought chemical ridden moisturizers that I tend to avoid. Natural is always better!  It&#x27;s not greasy or too thick. I &#x27;ve been wearing it under makeup with no problems.  When you open it it smells strongly of rosemary oil (quite similar to tea-tree oil), but this smell evaporates quickly on your skin, and you are left with a nice neutral sweet smell that will not bother you.    I wish it came with more product for the price. A larger tub would be good.</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t know what to expect when I ordered this lotion but with a contents list so full of wonderful ingredients, I figured it couldn&#x27;t hurt to give it a try. I am so glad I did! The manuka oil separates from the rest of the cream a little bit, so i just shake the jar before I use it. It has a slightly greasy feel (but not in a bad way!!!). It is more slippery than facial lotions I am used to (I have oily skin so I tend to veer away from that type of texture), but I think that gives it fantastic hydrating properties for acne prone skin. Coconut oil and manuka honey are antibacterial, so you essentially get to prevent bacteria from thriving on your face while using jojoba oil and the like to moisturize, allowing your skin to reduce its sebum production in favor of less pore-clogging moisture. I&#x27;ve been using this for about two weeks now, only at night because I was worried it would make me look greasy during the day. I woke up every morning to better and better looking skin. My skin has been getting so dry though in the cold weather (how can skin be oily and flakey at the same time? ew!) that today I was bold and wore it out for the first time....I loved it! It absorbed well into my skin, wore well under my mineral makeup, and gave me a smooth, dewy/glowy face all day (not oily!). The smell is a little antibacterial because of the manuka honey, but my roommate thinks it smells like pumpkin pie! Update: I loved this product but decided to try some other natural products when I finished my first jar. Nothing worked as well as this did, and I ended up right back here ordering my second jar :)</li>
    <li> I have been using this cream for only 2 days and I already notice a difference. My complexion is usually dull and now since I have been using this, I have a glow. I love this alos because my skin is oily and this cream does not make my skin oily, it absorbs into the skin quickly. It&#x27;s like my skin drinks in it. I use it as an a.m p.m cream and I wake up to see improvements every day. I will continue to buy this. Don&#x27;t hesitate on this one!</li>
    <li> I have deep cystic acne on my jawline, and smaller pimples on my forehead.  I feel confident knowing that when I put this cream on my skin, it will help destroy those acne causing bacteria, and it will moisturize as well.  The smell is very nice, a little like tea tree oil mixed with creamy honey.  This cream has not caused me to break out, unlike some other moisturizing products out there.  I have tried many other products for my face, including sensitive skin Dove bars, Cetaphil, Neutrogena, and Lush organic products, but I&#x27;ve been most happy with this.  I also use a salicylic gel on some of the acne, but this cream helps so that those areas don&#x27;t end up too dry and flaky.  I am very, very pleased with this product, and very happy that I&#x27;ve found something that doesn&#x27;t make my acne worse, moisturizes it to help heal my skin, and is natural to boot!</li>
    <li> My acne is not all gone but I can tell a difference.  I also really like how this product feels on my skin.  I just wish is was a little cheaper or it had free shipping for the amount you get.  Other than that I would totally buy it again.</li>
    <li> I am diabetic &amp; recently had a leg ulcer which are notoriously difficult to cure. After using Manuka honey for a couple of days, my ulcer had disappeared completely &amp;  I am very pleased.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve applied this cream to my face 4 of the past 5 nights - left it on overnight and washed it off in the morning - and it&#x27;s worked so well. I noticed results after just the first night. A friend of mine ordered it over the weekend per my recommendation, and I cannot wait to see her results! I am so pleased with this cream. I will most definitely keep using it, and will report back after 2 weeks. :-)</li>
    <li> I am hesitant to write this because I don&#x27;t want to jinx things, but oh well... here we go: I&#x27;ve been using this product for 2 weeks and have seen remarkable improvement in my skin.  I&#x27;m 30 years old and have been dealing with acne since I was 10, so this is huge.  I love the fact that it is so natural, it smells good and I can wear it during the day with no notice!  I use this with the nightly renewal manuka product.  Skin looks healthy and happy. :)</li>
    <li> I use this after I used the honey facial scrub. It takes the redness of rosacea out of my face and feels so soft on my skin.</li>
    <li> This is not a medicinal product, so the results are not dramatic, but it is a very gentle, soft, natural product which left my skin very soft (some OTC and prescription treatments dried my skin too much).  The product has a honey colored tint, which means you have to rub it in well to make sure your skin isn&#x60;t yellow when you wear it.  It also has a honey fragrance, which isn&#x60;t too bad, but my cats loved the smell and tried to rub up against my face, and then their fur got stuck in it too...  Overall it is a very gentle product, probably best for mild acne and spot treatment. I am originally from New Zealand, so buying something made in NZ is always my first choice.</li>
    <li> I like this product. The &#x27;natural&#x27; smell doesn&#x27;t bother me at all and I see a difference in my pores. I&#x27;m a manuka maniac, though...coughdrops, honey, antiseptic creme, and more.  A little goes a long way of this, too.</li>
    <li> It has a sticky texture and unpleasant odor.</li>
    <li> I REALLY LIKE THIS FACE LOTION, BUT IT STARTED TO SEPARATE THE OIL FROM THE LOTION??? I AM NOT SURE WHY THAT HAPPENED MY FRIEND BOUGHT THE SAME LOTION AT THE SAME TIME AND THAT DIDNT HAPPEN TO HERS?????</li>
    <li> I never write reviews but after using this Skin Clear Cream, I am amazed. If i have a blemish, I will put this on it at night, and by the morning, it is gone. I love this stuff!</li>
    <li> This lotion goes on so smooth and soft. Plus I end up smelling like a bakery! It doesn&#x27;t clog my pores and I think it has improved my problem skin. How I knew right away that this stuff is LEGITIMATE is when I used it on my cold sore on the corner of my mouth and it cleared it up in THREE DAYS!!! Wow! It has made me want to use more skincare products with Manuka Honey in it... :)</li>
    <li> This actually does leave my skin feeling softer after, but it doesn&#x27;t really do anything for my pimples and blemishes... I was expecting amazing results because of the 5 star reviews, but for me it&#x27;s actually not all that great.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this cream for 4 months now and I am about to order my second jar.  I use it every night before bed.  I have very sensitive skin and tend to get cystic pimples on my chin at least once a month.  Since I&#x27;ve been using this, I&#x27;ve experienced smaller pimples only once (and I honestly believe it&#x27;s because I didn&#x27;t use this cream two nights in a row).  It even seems as though it&#x27;s lightening my acne scars.  I recommend this to everyone I know who has acne issues.  The only reason I didn&#x27;t give this cream 5 stars is because it smells absolutely AWFUL.  The first time I used it, it actually made me gag.</li>
    <li> PROS: MRSA fighting, good smell, good price&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS: Jar could be bigger&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This product is wonderful!  Anyone who has or has had an MRSA infection knows how tenacious the bacteria tends to be, and this has worked for me where antibiotics have failed.  Obviously, consulting a physician should be the first step for this kind of highly contagious infection; that said, this stuff works miracles on MRSA!  Some of the other reviewers mentioned the smell being bad, but I love it.  It&#x27;s a sort of sweet, juniper wood scent that is really subtle in the jar and on skin.  I would highly recommend this product!</li>
    <li> I have been suffering from acne for years. I&#x27;ve tried all kinds of expensive products. Someone recommended Manuka Honey Skin care products, so I did my research and came across Active Manuka Honey for Skin Clear Cream. I&#x27;ve been using for two months and haven&#x27;t had any break outs.  Love It.</li>
    <li> Product arrived quickly, came intact. Opened the product and the oil was separating from the cream. Notified the company and immediately they said they would send me a new product, even after I said I didn&#x27;t mind shaking the container before I used the lotion. After using the skin cream for a week, my skin was completely cleared and healed from my finals induced breakout.  :) I will continue using this product as long and they make it. Koru Naturals is a fantastic company that not only sells a fabulous product but also cares about their customers satisfaction! For those of you who don&#x27;t know, the compounds in Manuka honey kill MRSA, an antibiotic resistant bacterial infection that we are unable to cure with traditional treatment...Think about how well it will work for your acne!</li>
    <li> I am 40+ years old and have had acne for over 10 years.  I also have really sun sensitive skin (hyper pigmentation), combine those two things with aging and it is a pain to manage.  I finally have learned that less is more with my face. Using benzoyl peroxide products or salicylic acid cause me to break out even more, which leads to little brown spots that stay forever after a zit finally heals.&lt;br /&gt;I am a nurse and a major wound company rep came to do a demo on a Manuka Honey Wound care product.  We actually ate (ok, tasted) the medical product, they use straight purified honey.  We used it on a chronic wound that was likely infected, had not responded to IV antibiotics, topical silver...  The wound healed. For 2 years the patient had that wound and within 8 weeks it was gone.  I had had a zit in the same place for 2 months so I Googled this Manuka and found the NZ Skin Clear Cream.  Well here I am buying another jar and although my skin is not perfect I have not had a cystic breakout in 2 months AND my skin is less reactive to sunlight so I got an unexpected bonus!&lt;br /&gt;I buy a million thing on AMZ and never write reviews but I decided to throw in my opinion.  It&#x27;s rare for a product junkie like me to buy a second time.</li>
    <li> For healthy, acne-free skin, just say no to fried foods&lt;br /&gt;Most people with acne attempt to treat their irritated skin with external face washes, soaps, lotions and treatments. Yet, according to a number of natural health authors, the best way to treat acne is by changing your diet and getting rid of acne-causing ingredients such as fried foods.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[...]</li>
    <li> I order this product plus their eye cream ever few weeks and just LOVE IT!! and it always comes super fast in the mail in a tiny little box! great product, great company!</li>
    <li> As I wrote for the NZ Fusion&#x27;s Moon Cream, this is a wonderful line of skin care products that are not only a good value but which works!</li>
    <li> THE WORST. Gave me the worst cystic ance over night . On my chin , temples all over my cheeks. Buyer beware . This oil bottle is not meant for acne prone skin .</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had severe acne for a long long time. This Manuka Honey has really cleared up my skin, and it also smells great and feels amazing! My skin is very sensitive and it does not irritate my skin at all. I use this stuff everyday and I also use Witch Hazel and my skin is defiantly improving in ways that it never had before.</li>
    <li> This stuff is awesome. I&#x27;ve been using it everyday. I have dry acne-prone skin and this is helping me a lot.  This cream is very mosturizing.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this now for about two years.  It really does work!  I had a forehead breakout from clothing and hardhats that nothing else worked on.  Then a friend told me about this and my forehead cleared up in a few days.  I use it on my entire face at night now before I go to sleep.  They added a more pleasant smell to it, I think oranges?  I highly recommend this skin cream for those with adult acne/rash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;JM  Pennsylvania</li>
    <li> I developed severe acne about 2 years ago and this is hands down the best cream i have found since. Other natural products were too oily or just didn&#x27;t help. This moisturizes realllyy nicely - i put it on at night and in the morning my skin is super soft and whatever inflammation there was is much calmer. I don&#x27;t think that a cream can ever totally get rid of acne but this really helps. Especially because sometimes acne-prone skin gets flaky..everyone needs to moisturize. I have been using this cream for about a year now and it is the only one i will use. The manuka honey is such a wonderful ingredient :) skin softening and anti-bacterial all on its own. I&#x27;m so happy to have access to such a great product at such a reasonable price. a little goes a long way so the 2 1/2 oz jar lasts a longg time.</li>
    <li> I purchased this cream and I must say that I was skeptical but it works very well.  It&#x27;s very gentle and slowly but surely took care of resolving my blemish issue.  I used this cream in conjunction with increased water intake and my skin problems have virtually disappeared.  I live in a colder sometimes drier climate so when I need more moisture I add one drop of any natural vegetable oil and it takes care of any dryness that I might feel.  I will purchase and continue to use this cream in the future.</li>
    <li> I really wanted to like this skin cream and had high hopes that it would help with the acne breakouts that I&#x27;ve been having lately, but I just couldn&#x27;t get past the horrible smell.  It is actually nauseating to me and offensive to others - I tried to stick it out, thinking maybe I&#x27;d get used to the smell, but I got so many complaints from my family that I had to go wash my face.  It may be the 5-star product others seem to think it is, but I&#x27;ll never know how anyone can stand the odor.</li>
    <li> Product was shipped promptly and I received it one day early. This was great; however , the product itself has ravaged my skin. After only 3days of use, horrible painful swelling acne. It seems to heal faster, but continues to come. My actual reason for getting this was because of the manuka honey. I love coconut oil, and also saw this as an ingredient. I question the quality of the oils because coconut oil has helped my skin, and this cream, mixed with many other wonderful ingredients, has thus far worsened the condition of my skin. May not be a righteous review, but in so little time, the condition of my skin changed so drastically that I have no choice but to assume the reason. Going back to straight extra virgin coconut oil organic, cold pressed, not gmo, etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As of March 10, 2012 I wanted to report that after consistent use, I do feel my skin has improved because of this lotion. I intend to continue use. Takes consistency but it has helped. Thanks</li>
    <li> I original purchased the item when it was in the glass jar. I wouldn&#x27;t say it prevented acne but I found it worked well on moistening my skin. I repurchased and it came in the plastic bottle. No. It smelt weird and off as if it was spoilt. Don&#x27;t like the plastic bottle, cant see my product....it seems to me that the consistency is not the same as it was in the glass jar. Will not purchase again.</li>
    <li> ...and that&#x27;s why this stuff stands out. The scent is strong and may be off-putting to the sensitive-nosed, but I love the smell of natural ingredients. The very 1st time I applied this cream, my chin reddened a bit and tingled, so I put some calming cream right on top. Now, I don&#x27;t need to take that extra step any longer-- my skin is used to it. The acne I have has shrunk with 3 nights of application (it usually takes weeks for this to happen). It has marvelous skin conditioning agents in it, and overall, is a stunningly effective anti-acne product. It&#x27;s nice to have 100% natural options that work so well! Not all of us have skin that can tolerate prescription creams/gels. This stuff is a STEAL. Try it.</li>
    <li> This is the BEST CREAM I have ever used. I have had acne my entire life and I hated every second of dealing with it. I luckily came across this cream on amazon and decided to give a try after reading the amazing reviews. I am not exaggerating AT ALL when I say that my skin quality has improved by 10x after using the cream. I used to have really dry skin and scars from my acne. My skin is now always moisturized and supple, and even the scars of my acne have lightened. This is probably the 5th bottle I have ordered and I cannot live without this cream any longer. I wouldn&#x27;t recommend any other cream over this one. Absolutely a fantastic product.</li>
    <li> Oily but great. I have tried hundreds, literally hundreds, of different facial moisturizers to help with my combination skin and acne. I really love this stuff. You need to only use a little, other wise it will be too oily, it keeps my skin soft all day and doesn&#x27;t make me break out. This is good for all year use, dry , wet, hot or cold weather. It works great!</li>
    <li> I bought this when it still came in the glass jar and as of yet, haven&#x27;t run out. The smell is bad. There&#x27;s really no getting around it. I originally bought it for acne because using raw honey on my face helped to clear up pimple, but it did nothing. However, it made an excellent moisturizer. I have sensitive skin that&#x27;s prone to drying out in the winter and whenever I start using new products or masks on my face, but this replenished like no other.</li>
    <li> I thought, I&#x27;ve tried everything else, why not this?  Boy was I sorry.  I&#x27;m 40 yrs old and have always had oily skin.  I get the odd blemish now and then, but lately stress has gotten the better of my skin.  I thought this would help.  No way.  It&#x27;s texture is like whipped pudding.  Smells like tea tree oil, but there isn&#x27;t any listed in it (is that the rosemary?).  I put it on a spot, and 3 hrs later, my spot had thrown a party and invited friends.  Two days later I decided to try it again - it could have been a fluke, right?  Nope.  The whole right side of my face where I applied this is all broke out in big, fat ZITS.  Not just tiny ones from an allergic reaction - BIG ones from clogged pores.  Complete waste of $20.00, my time, and even more stress from walking about in public feeling like a giant flashing arrow is pointing at my face.</li>
    <li> I only review things I love or hate. And I love this stuff! I have very fair, sensitive skin that breaks out if I use anything harsh or chemical-y (very technical term). This stuff works beautifully.</li>
    <li> first the packaging is different than how it is now. it was in a cup wen I purchased it...I purchase the cup version in February 2012...and I stop using it in September 2012. I give it 3 stars because it makes my skin became very oily and I get a lot of breakouts while using it. overall the product did ok for my skin, I did notice that my skin look a little more healthier underneath my breakouts....the great thing about it is that it&#x27;s ingredients are understandable n natural which are excellent when it comes to your face...5 star for being organic n 3 for making me breakout....</li>
    <li> I am a 56 year old female experiencing hormonal acne &amp; blemishes along my jawline. Nothing I have tried (prescription and otc) has cleared my skin till this Skin Clear Cream. The dark spots which remained from old blemishes are also fading. Thank you for this wonderful product!</li>
    <li> First time I feel the urge to write a review for Amazon products.  I tried it for a little over a week and my skin has been feeling so great!  It absorbs well (although it has some tiny beads, but after your massage it, the beads disappears).  My skin has been so smooth and happy!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always suffered from acne. I purchased the face cream and in three weeks I&#x27;m almost completely clear.  try this product out.</li>
    <li> This cream seems to work very well on my somewhat acne-prone skin. It goes on smoothly, feels very clean, and (in conjunction with other Manuka Honey products) is keeping my face looking clear and dewy. I&#x27;ve been using it for about two weeks now, and am very satisfied that it is clearing up any blemishes that I had/preventing new ones from occurring.</li>
    <li> I wanted to like this product but unfortunately it broke my out really bad.</li>
    <li> This cream smells awful and is incredibly greasy. Not only did it not help my acne, but it gave me a strange complexion and made my acne worse.</li>
    <li> I used it on my face and upper back and chest in hopes that this thing might work better than dermatologist-prescribed products (Cleocin T and Retin A), but no. Used it for 3 weeks, and my husband really hates the smell. I don&#x27;t care about the smell that much, but I do care that this thing doesn&#x27;t work. I am glad if it helps people with really mild acne, but with acne vulgaris it is useless. :(</li>
    <li> I have used this for about a month now and it is really good stuff for the complexion.  I don&#x27;t think I will go backwards in age, but it does keep the&lt;br /&gt;skin clear.  I just wish I could get my teenage daughter to use it as I think it would be great for people with skin problems, especially teens with the&lt;br /&gt;usual problems they have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has been 9 months since I wrote the above comment and have found my jar of this product again, and this time I have been very good at&lt;br /&gt;using it all the time and to the effect that one of my daughters just recently said to me \\&quot;Your skin looks like porcelain!\\&quot;  Wow, she is right.  I used to&lt;br /&gt;have very large pores from all the years I had bad skin with acne etc and believe it or not, I think it is actually making the skin younger.  It is amazing and&lt;br /&gt;I think I only used it a few times when I wrote the first paragraph but now I have used all of the jar and now my skin looks like \\&quot;porcelain\\&quot;  Amazing!</li>
    <li> Bought that cream after reading the reviews about acne outbreaks.  My sons gave it a try and were not very impressed with it so won&#x27;t buy another one for that purpose.</li>
    <li> As a result of hormonal issues, I had been struggling with itchy welts and bumps along my jaw line... aka cystic acne. This lotion, though it smells a bit strong, actually helps shrink the inflammation associated with the cystic acne and is a great preventative product. I don&#x27;t recommend using a toner before applying it. Massaging it into the skin works best.</li>
    <li> Severe rosacea has plagued me for years and years. I may not have tried every nostrum known to man on it, but I certainly tried -- and it was ever one step forward, two back. That includes three different prescriptions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I can hardly remember a time recently when I didn&#x27;t have a bright red nose sprinkled with both pustules and papules (eruptions with liquid in them and others just hard little knots) -- followed by little flakes of skin, almost like dandruff, decorating the still-red nose, thanks to the strong drying results of the meds. So I kept looking for something that would work for a change.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I saw the description of this cream using Manuka honey as part of the base, I was interested, indeed. I&#x27;ve long used raw Manuka honey for various conditions since its healing properties are well known. So I tried again. The result? I have not had a single eruption of either variety since I first dabbed on this wonderful Manuka honey skin cream. No flakes of skin from a nose that appeared to be sandpapered. No lumps. It&#x27;s still a tad more colorful than it should be, but even that is fading. My nose and cheeks feel like skin again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a tad pricey, but it&#x27;s more than worth it to have a long-standing condition improve so much is a very short time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seriously, if I could give it six stars, I would. This is a terrific product, and you cannot lose.</li>
    <li> Works good on skin problems because it has a natural antibiotics in it.</li>
    <li> I decided to try this cream when the lady at my eyebrow threading place told me to mix honey and cinnamon together to help clear up the acne marks on my face. I heard Manuka honey is the best to use so I decided to order it online but came across this product. Had many great reviews and I was very \\&quot;ify\\&quot; about buying another cream...but I did anyway.&lt;br /&gt;I am happy I did. I&#x27;ve been using this cream morning/afternoon for the past two days and to my knownledge there&#x27;s a difference in my face already.&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s not expensive and worth giving it a try if you have scars/acne on your face.&lt;br /&gt;The smell I don&#x27;t like but after a few minutes its gone.</li>
    <li> I have oily skin and heard that this may be helpful with acne (despite it being an oil based product) I think this may be best used as just a &amp;#34;spot treatment&amp;#34; or to help smooth/even out blemish spots only. I used it all over and experienced a slight beakout WHICH WENT AWAY IMMEDIATELY AFTER I STOPPED USING IT!...(((I would recommend using Grapeseed Oil as your only regular oil-moisturizer))) That stuff is awesome but Manuka Oil Cream for some Oily Girls may be best as just a SPOT TREATMENT!</li>
    <li> This is very thick. you only need a little bit. i have combination/oily skin to begin with so i only use this when I feel that my skin is dry. The smell is different but good. I like it as part of my skin care regimen, but its not a lotion I can wear under makeup because its too heavy.</li>
    <li> I purchased this product because it was listed as a blemish cream.  I already have oily skin and do not like putting heavy things on my face.  the cream smells like insect repellant and caused more blemishes instead of doing the opposite.  This product was a waste of money for me.  It is better to buy raw manuka honey and put that on your face.</li>
    <li> Quick review:  Three females in our household between the ages of 17 and 53 have ordered this product multiple times and will continue to do so.  We all love the smell, how it makes our skin feel, healing properties, etc.  The pump bottle is an improvement over the jar.  Great company, fast service.</li>
    <li> The skin cream helped me with a dry patch that I could not get rid of for years.  It also helped in the healing process of my mother bed sore and the painful discoloration on her back...I had to order 2 more jars.  Manuka honey is one of God&#x27;s wonderful works. I&#x27;m glad I finally found it after years of searching.</li>
    <li> I think it helps to control acne, yes. I don&#x27;t know if clears blemishes yet, which I desperately want. I do still have minor breakouts though, a pimple here or there but nothing serious.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I like the way it makes my face feel, there&#x27;s a tingle llike tea tree oil. No issues with the smell or anything. And they are right, it doesn&#x27;t leave you greasy if you use the right amounts. I have the old jar version.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I do think it will help defy aging also.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I dislike and what confuses me is that the ingredients tend to seperate and I have to stir/mix it every night about maybe 2 weeks after I received it.</li>
    <li> This is the best stuff for small infections, bites, irritations, acne.&lt;br /&gt;My daughters, The smell doesnt linger and becomes fragrant&lt;br /&gt;when you realize how well it works.</li>
    <li> I have bought this a few times. From the first sec i got this my random few pimples have stopped. My skin looks clear. The only problem i have is that it seems to make blackheads worse. I switched to the serum in the same brand and unfortunately broke out like crazy, so i quickly ordered this again. From the first use all pimples dried up over night. For sensitive skin nothing works better on acne then this, but be prepared for an increased in blackheads. I use a clasonic, micropolis and clay masks... still cant get those stupid blackhead.  I cant use AHA or BHA or any normal acne treatment my skin is so sensitive....this stuff is awesome and feels soothing, not tight or itchy like most stuff does.</li>
    <li> So far so good!  Very soothing and seemed to turn my skin around!  My skin was drying out from the product I was using for my acne and this moisturized and healed.  I love it!  The smell takes some getting used to, but worth it!</li>
    <li> This didn&#x27;t work well on my face--made me break out. But I use it on my hands, and it&#x27;s a great moisturizer for that.</li>
    <li> I used to use benzoyl peroxide because I had pimples on my face, BP worked for me and my acne have gone, but I really wanted to use natural products on my face, so I found and ordered this cream. It&#x27;s been 1 week since I started to use it. It works really well. It&#x27;s moisturizing my skin, I love the smell and I don&#x27;t have any acne. I&#x27;m really happy that now I don&#x27;t have to use BP anymore. Will order this cream again! I have also been using Manuka honey(Organic +12) for two months as a cleanser and I&#x27;m in love with it! My skin is smooth and acne scars are disappearing from my face.&lt;br /&gt;I hope my review was helpful. Good luck with your skin!</li>
    <li> I am in my mid 20&#x27;s and have the occasional breakout. I wanted something that would work for the long haul and decided on this stuff. After a week of using it I am now breaking out really bad to the point i have to wear headbands covering my forehead. I wanted this stuff to work for me, was really excited about trying it and having high hopes from reading all the positive reviews. Before trying this stuff I was using Jajoba Oil and it was working for me but i still did have breakouts, which is why i wanted to try something new. Jajoba Oil has been doing good things for my skin so I am just going to stick with that.</li>
    <li> Purchased this for my son who has moderate Acne on his back. So far it is working well. Good Luck.</li>
    <li> I have been using this cream for almost a year.  It really is a great product!  I preferred it when it was in a jar, rather than a pump.  Maybe that&#x27;s just me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I also use straight manuka honey as a mask once a week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do your face a favor, and use this cream.  If you are having issues with breakouts, give this a try.  It changed my skin after three weeks of use.</li>
    <li> This is a waste of money product , i bought it because i started to break out with  hormonal pregnancy pimples.  I red on the review  it is ok to use it while pregnant only finding out after  it is not ok to use this product  while pregnant ,It said so on the jar . It also had a unpleasant smell to it.</li>
    <li> The cream smells nice, maybe it is kind of a weird smell but very natural. It&#x27;s greasy at first but if you put just a little amount on your face it will be fine. Also, shipping was fast and nicely packaged. The only thing I didn&#x27;t like was the consistency - the oil and lotion were separated and I had to stir to mix them up. For me, it has too much oil in it, and for those who have oily skin maybe it will be too greasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;P.S. Update: Such a consistency was due to a very hot weather which is bad for such a natural cream while being shipped. So I&#x27;ve just got a replacement! The new  one is fantastic and the consistency is fine. Me and my roommate love this cream!</li>
    <li> and the scent was too strong for me to be able to sleep comfortably.&lt;br /&gt;all i smelled was this and it gave me a headache.&lt;br /&gt;i did however wake up with smooth skin.</li>
    <li> This skin clear cream works so well with my skin, I have oily skin and this cream does not make me an oil slick.</li>
    <li> I am black, (light brown complexion) and I have had acne since I was a teenaged due to a combination of poor eating habits, hair grease getting on my skin and using things that were not meant for my skin (alcohol based products to dry out my skin). During hiigh school, I was also under a great deal of stress. When I graduated and moved away from home, my skin magically cleared up. But once I started using makeup (revlon products), I started breaking out again. I just figured it was something I would have to deal with for the rest of my life to some extent. I am now 36, and at the age of 28, I found MAC cosmetics. After research and trial, my skin began to clear and the dark marks starting going away while using fade creams. I then got pregnant and got cystic acne worse than ever. All my years of work were gone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A year after my son was born, I started using Proactiv and saw a little relief, but the marks were still there. Fast forward to today. I have been using the fade cream for just about a year with minor improvement. I was getting a pimple every other day, whether it was a whitehead or something under the skin. Oxy would occasionally stop the pimple, but other times, it would do nothing. I ordered the Manuka skin cream this past week. It arrived 3 days later. I put it on my skin after washing my face with Burt&#x27;s Bee&#x27;s baby wash (the kind that is unscented and practically all natural). It felt a little heavy, but I knew it didn&#x27;t matter because of what was in the product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The next morning when I got up, not only did I not have a single pimple, my face was the softest I have ever felt it. It has been 5 days and I have not had a SINGLE pimple. Even with having some not so great foods over the holidays (french fries and buttered movie popcorn). Before it seemed if a single bit of oil got on my skin, even on accident, it was a guaranteed pimple. Now, I throughly believe I won&#x27;t have to worry about this ever again. I have ordered a Reviva acid product that I will use to remove the scars and continue to use this for acne and overall skin health. Once I get rid of the scars, I know my skin will be perfect. I wish I had looked into this years ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thank you so much for making something natural that works!!!</li>
    <li> Supposed to be anti-bacterial - but from trying for a couple weeks - not helping face breakouts at all - sorry to say. The oil part of the product is unpleasant too. Update: I went back to using this product - and over time did see improvement. So, the results were far from immediate - so apparently takes time in some cases to take effect.</li>
    <li> I wanted to find a skin cream with manuka honey - I&#x27;d used manuka honey after it was recommended by my naturopath for stomach repair - and I figured, why not skin care?  Found this at Amazon and tried it.  Literally, not exaggerating at all - when I put it on for the first time I could FEEL it working.  I&#x27;d had little bumps that I&#x27;d come to live with - not pimples, just maybe clogged or irritated pores.  No matter what cream I&#x27;d used they never went away -- never got worse or better -- just stayed the same.  Within two days of using this cream, they were GONE.  After having them for literally, 8 years.  As close to a miracle as I&#x27;ve ever found with a skin care product!</li>
    <li> I have mature acne spots. I have tried everything. I found this and decided to try. I am so glad I did. I have been using it for a week and love the results. The spots are going away while leaving my skin moisturized and soft. Some acne treatments leave skin dry and scaly. I am so happy to have found this product. It does have a medicinal smell but vapors don&#x27;t linger. But a small price to pay for a product that works on mature skin!!! For me this was just what I needed!</li>
