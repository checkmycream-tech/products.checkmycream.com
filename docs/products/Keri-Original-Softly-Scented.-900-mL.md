    <li> My favorite lotion of all times. Please keep in stock</li>
    <li> I have used this lotion for almost 40 years as a facial cream. Yesterday I went to Walmart &amp; Target to purchase a bottle and they didn&#x27;t have it. I was very disappointed in them. Thank god for Amazon &amp; Walgreens. I hope they never quit making this lotion...I don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;d replace it with. There is nothing on the market like it.</li>
    <li> I have used Original Keri lotion for years and am thrilled it is still available without all the additives that are popular these days.  Hard to find in stores.  Thanks Amazon.com.</li>

    <li> OVERALL GREAT EXPERIENCE. THANK YOU.</li>
    <li> good size bottle, and works as a great soothing lotion for my skin</li>
    <li> Delivered as expected.  The lotion has a light scent that is not overpowering. Moisture with feeling oily.</li>
    <li> I love this lotion, but sad to say in the last 6 months I&#x27;ve order 2 of this and when arrived the lotion spilled all over the box.&lt;br /&gt;Not sealed correctly.</li>
    <li> It really protects in a harsh environment.  Though it takes a while to rub it in, its effective in protecting the hands from drying out. It also helps to heal cracks that develop when its cold or the hands are really dry.</li>
    <li> Keri is the Best Lotion Ever!  I have been using Keri for over 30yrs, since I moved to the desert southwest, as it is the only lotion that keeps my sensative skin soft and moisturized.  I used to purchase the 900 ml at Costco, but they discontinued it, as well as other local stores.  Thank goodness for Amazon!</li>
    <li> Keri is simply the best,  loves it</li>
    <li> Love Keri lotion because it&#x27;s not filled with a lot of water. Soothes the skin. Feels like you&#x27;ve put something on rather than have it dissipate into thin air.</li>

    <li> This is the only lotion my husband will use on his dry, sensitive skin.  He&#x27;s been using it more than 20 years.  He&#x27;s tried others, both expensive and cheaper ones, now this is the only one he&#x27;ll use.  It has to be the \\&quot;original\\&quot;.  All their others are not as good.</li>
    <li> This is a GREAT product. It really helps after my skin gets dried out from swimming.</li>
    <li> I have been using Keri lotion for years, 10+. i go through a regular size bottle in 3-4 weeks, so thelarger bottle comes in handy. it probably lasts me 2 months, more or less. i ordered 3-4 of them to ensure that i have enough in case it discountinues, which i hope it never does. i wish they made an even bigger bottle.</li>

    <li> I&#x27;ve grown up using keri on my dry, sensitive skin and I don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;d do without it! There is truly nothing else like it. I&#x27;ve tried every other lotion out there to see if I could have a few options (in case they ever stop making this) and there&#x27;s really nothing else! I&#x27;ve been using it for over 20 years!!</li>
