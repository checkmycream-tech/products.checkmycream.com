      <li>I has a nice light scent.</li>
      <li>I was OK with that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Not so sure about the 48 hour protection claim, but it does get you through a day without any wetness or odor.</li>
      <li>I didn&#x27;t notice any streaking on clothes, but I&#x27;m sure it does that, like all chalky deodorants.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Smells fresh and good.</li>
      <li>Effective anti-perspirant, smells good, decent price, non-irritating, BUT still wish it was a liquid or gel.</li>
      <li>Works well and smells pretty good.</li>
      <li>This is a pretty good anti-perspirant.  </li>
      <li>The scent is nice and clean and it applies easily, however after 12-16 hrs that &amp;#34;fresh</li>
      <li>I want to note that I&#x27;m sure many people have a fantastic experience with it, and it even helps me not to perspire.</li>
      <li>I am a hot-natured person, often given to sweating at lower temperatures than most, and this product does a fine job suppressing that reaction.</li>
      <li>Fortunately, I was able to answer, &amp;#34;No,</li>
      <li>Fortunately, I was able to answer, &amp;#34;No,</li>
      <li>Well, Dove soap is very mild; the deodorant must be as well.</li>
      <li>it&#x27;s easy to use and reliable.</li>
      <li>Easily applied.  </li>
      <li>better than clean comfort, should sell a 2 pack</li>
      <li>If you&#x27;re looking for something that isn&#x27;t going to cause people to turn around and try to figure out what smells so strong, I recommend this.</li>
      <li>Seems to be pretty effective</li>
      <li>If you just apply for the day you will be fine</li>
      <li>normally like gel deodorants, but I also liked the fresh scent here, and I liked how it did not linger after putting it on.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m huge into Dove care products and I&#x27;m almost always a fan.</li>
      <li>Overall this is a great product.  </li>
      <li>The container is wider to fit a man’s hand.</li>
      <li>I cannot attest to the 48 hour protection as I like to shower daily, but it has been working great every day since I started using it.  </li>
      <li>which is a fantastic product.</li>
      <li>aside I found it be effective and gentle.  </li>
      <li>Nice smell but very pungent.</li>
      <li>great deodorant, smells great, last long</li>
      <li>The Dark Temptation had a very good smell but it had something in it that I seemed to have gotten allergic to after awhile as it started to initiate my gag reflex.</li>
      <li>Wish more companies were aware of the rashes and allergic reactions that men and women can have using deodarants.</li>
      <li>for the fragrance, it is pleasant enough and not overpowering.</li>
      <li>The bonus is the applicator – easy to use to apply the right amount.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Zero</li>
      <li>If you just want to try a Dove deodorant, I suggest you try \\&quot;Cool</li>
      <li>My favorite men&#x27;s deodorant ... and at Amazon&#x27;s reasonable prices.</li>
      <li>Boasting a &amp;#34;Fresh Awake” muted masculine fragrance and an effective antiperspirant formula, it works in both cases in winter.</li>
      <li>I have used [[ASIN:B00C5RKP7Y Dove Men + Care Cool Silver Non-irritant</li>
      <li>Many deodorants/antiperspirants just don&#x27;t work very well, but this one does.&lt;br</li>
      <li>But for this one, she thought it was a fresh, light scent that she approved</li>
      <li>Axe&#x27;s Anarchy deodorant and was surprised by how nice it smelled without being overpowering.</li>
      <li>Mild scent that the wife likes.</li>
      <li>It goes on damp, but dries fairly quickly.</li>
      <li>I found Degree to have a far more pleasant scent and one that actually feels &amp;#34;manly&amp;#34;.</li>
      <li>don&#x27;t know what more to say, especially since I don&#x27;t have many others to compare it to.</li>
      <li>and it works wonderful lasting all day long without having to reapply it.  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m fine for most of the day, but then in the afternoon, and for several days after, I&#x27;m itchy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>It actually is a fresh scent ..</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t had this problem with the Dove Fresh Awake.</li>
      <li>The scent is fresh and energizing, but not overpowering.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Love dove deodorants, im sensitive to getting a rash from others. Dove works well and smells great</li>
    <li> Effective anti-perspirant, smells good, decent price, non-irritating, BUT still wish it was a liquid or gel.</li>
    <li> What I can say... This deodorant works!  I like the scent and the fact that does not cause irritation.</li>
    <li> It’s deodorant, what do you expect? It works well, smells good, and probably limits amount of perspiration. No issues.</li>
    <li> Smells like an expensive hotel a stayed at in chicago. Great citron scent for men.</li>
    <li> Smells wonderful and works well.</li>
    <li> Dove has made a real name for itself with it&#x27;s line of men&#x27;s care products, that are reasonable in price and work well. This anti-perspirant is another winner with a subtle and pleasant scent that does not overpower those of us with sensitive noses... It does the job, and last well in the Miami heat and humidity.</li>
    <li> This seems to work well and aroma is &amp;#34;fresh&amp;#34;.  It works well, although I haven&#x27;t tested the 48 hour claim!  There is a slight residue but this is normal with any non-gel deodorant.  As stated by another reviewer &amp;#34;No fuss, no muss&amp;#34;.  It does what it says it does and does it well.</li>
    <li> This is a very nicely-scented deodorant. Not too heavy of a scent, but enough to know it’s there. The scent lasts a good part of the day as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I found it to be very effective and it didn’t cause any skin irritation. The bonus is the applicator – easy to use to apply the right amount.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Zero complaints!</li>
    <li> This has been my favorite deodorant for years.  It smells good, goes on easy, and washes off fairly easily in the shower.  I have sensitive skin so I try to use Dove everything because it doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin. I would highly recommend trying this, especially if you have sensitive skin.  You can now get it on amazon much cheaper than anywhere I have found, which is why I started ordering mine here.</li>
    <li> Sucks!!! I always have white traces of this product on my shrirts. It also smells strong and unpleasant when I do any physical activity!!!! Never buying this again!!!!!</li>
    <li> I ended up swapping to the Dove Fresh Awake antiperspirant and deodorant from the Axe Dark Temptation antiperspirant and deodorant. The Dark Temptation had a very good smell but it had something in it that I seemed to have gotten allergic to after awhile as it started to initiate my gag reflex. I haven&#x27;t had this problem with the Dove Fresh Awake. It&#x27;s not nearly as strong as the Axe Dark Temptation but it does its&#x27; job exceptionally well. I also didn&#x27;t have the problem that some reviewers mentioned of on black shirts, it didn&#x27;t stain my shirts at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I initially bought my first one at Walgreens and don&#x27;t remember exactly how much I paid but it was definitely pricier than buying it from Amazon. I wouldn&#x27;t hesitate to buy this one from Amazon!</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s not the best scent that they make, but it helps assure that I won&#x27;t break out in rashes for the cologne sprayed deodorants. I&#x27;m very thankful that Dove has made a product like this, because it&#x27;s very hard to come across. Wish more companies were aware of the rashes and allergic reactions that men and women can have using deodarants.</li>
    <li> I have used [[ASIN:B00C5RKP7Y Dove Men + Care Cool Silver Non-irritant Anti-Perspirant Deodorant 2.7 oz (Pack of 6)]]in the past which is a fantastic product. This product is not even close. Mind you, I am only comparing the fragrance; I just don&#x27;t like the smell of this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Product performance may be similar or even identical, but I couldn&#x27;t tell. There is plenty of substance, the dispenser works well, and looks good.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I recommend that you first do a sniff test in a local store before ordering this online. If you just want to try a Dove deodorant, I suggest you try \\&quot;Cool Silver\\&quot; first.</li>
    <li> This deodorant works for a few reasons. The smell isn&#x27;t overpowering, but also doesn&#x27;t have that &amp;#34;fake&amp;#34; smell that many deodorants have. I&#x27;ve used this in a couple scenarios where I&#x27;m prone to sweat more and I can say that it really does hold up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My one chief complaint is that this deodorant doesn&#x27;t dry very fast. If you put your deodorant on directly before getting dressed, you might get streaks on your clothes, which is not true of every antiperspirant. I guess that&#x27;s sort of cancelled out by the fact that it works better than many antiperspirants that I&#x27;ve used in the past, but it&#x27;s worth noting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#x27;re looking for a new antiperspirant, you should definitely consider this Dove product. It will definitely help if you&#x27;re into sports or live in areas with warm weather.</li>
    <li> This is a pretty good anti-perspirant.  It keeps the active guy dry and the scent is very nice and not too strong (if you are familiar with Old Spice&#x27;s Fiji anti-perspirant, then I would tell you that the scent is very similar).  I would buy this again.</li>
    <li> Great stuff. don&#x27;t seem to burn my arm pits like some of the Gillette offerings. I seem to go through this stuff pretty quickly . I has a nice light scent. feels good!</li>
    <li> While not my usual brand, I recently gave the Dove Men + Care Anti-Perspirant Deodorant (Fresh Awake scent) a try.  The antiperspirant aspect seems to work quite well. I am a hot-natured person, often given to sweating at lower temperatures than most, and this product does a fine job suppressing that reaction. However, I am not pleased with the Fresh Awake scent of this product. It smells oddly of mildly unpleasant chemicals. I realize this isn&#x27;t a very useful description of the fragrance, but it is difficult for me to find an adequate analogy for the way it smells. It isn&#x27;t outright awful, but it is subtly displeasing to my nose. I am willing to give this product line another shot, but I certainly won&#x27;t be purchasing the Fresh Awake scented variant again.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s deodorant/antiperspirant.  It&#x27;s an affordable method of preventing the stink.  It works.</li>
    <li> This one has a wonderful fragrance that isn&#x27;t over powering and it works wonderful lasting all day long without having to reapply it.  Easy on with no tshirt staining and having hubby feel fresh and confident makes me a happy camper also.</li>
    <li> My favorite men&#x27;s deodorant ... and at Amazon&#x27;s reasonable prices.</li>
    <li> I expect only a few things from an antiperspirant/deodarant: that it prevents me from perspiring and smells good.  This product certainly does the trick!  It smells good and doesn&#x27;t leave a huge amount of residue.  Simple and effective.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t usually buy deodorant. Maybe it&#x27;s just me but I always found that shaving areas where you would put it takes care of most of the problem, along with showering daily. Now and then I&#x27;ll try something out though. A few months ago I tried out Axe&#x27;s Anarchy deodorant and was surprised by how nice it smelled without being overpowering. The Dove Men stick here may not smell as good, but you get a lot more and it does its job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fresh Awake has a very subtle fragrance, almost coming off as lotion or soap. When I put it on, I couldn&#x27;t smell it through my clothes, and even after working for several hours, the smell didn&#x27;t suddenly kick in like a few other products I&#x27;ve tried do. Throughout the day day, Fresh Awake kept me dry, lasting at least 10 hours. It didn&#x27;t irritate my skin, and with how much you get in a stick, it&#x27;s going to last a long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#x27;t know what more to say, especially since I don&#x27;t have many others to compare it to. If you&#x27;re looking for something that isn&#x27;t going to cause people to turn around and try to figure out what smells so strong, I recommend this.</li>
    <li> PROS:&lt;br /&gt;* It stops the sweat&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CONS:&lt;br /&gt;* Irritates my skin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a kid, I had to be careful of what soaps I used, or I would break out.  From adolescence on (I&#x27;m almost 40 now), I&#x27;ve not had any problems with skin irritation from anything, whether it&#x27;s deodorants, laundry soap, garage chemicals, whatever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Except this.  I bought 5 different deodorants to try out, and this is the only one that makes my pits itchy.  I&#x27;m fine for most of the day, but then in the afternoon, and for several days after, I&#x27;m itchy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would call this 1 star, but this stops the sweat.  Many deodorants/antiperspirants just don&#x27;t work very well, but this one does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The problem chemical is C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate.  That&#x27;s the one missing from Degree Adrenaline, which works just as well, but without skin itchies.  The strong, active ingredient is Aluminum Zirconium Tetrachlorohydrex.  Anything 15-20% of AZT works well for me.</li>
    <li> After trying several different stick deodorants, I found this one. Little or no irritation. I don&#x27;t like the fact that it&#x27;s formulated with Aluminum. Most antiperspirants have this. It&#x27;s another way metals get in your body.</li>
    <li> Mild scent that the wife likes. Lasts the whole day. Doesn&#x27;t seem to clump and is completely removed after a shower. Have completely switched to this as my go to antiperspirant.</li>
    <li> Short and to the point, I was hoping that with this being an anti-perspirant it would do a decent job and blocking and preventing sweat but it didn&#x27;t completely prevent sweating. The smell though is nice.</li>
    <li> Four EFFECTIVE Stars! Dove Men+Care Antispirant Deodorant mostly works as advertised. Boasting a &amp;#34;Fresh Awake” muted masculine fragrance and an effective antiperspirant formula, it works in both cases in winter. However, it loses some antiperspirant power in the heat of a busy day now that outside temperatures are rising into the 80s, but it doesn’t ‘crash’, like some other brands. The deodorant aspect, however, continues working through the heat. Over a period of 3 weeks, it has delivered protection up to 30 hours without any signs of garment staining or irritation. Definitely Recommended. Four PROTECTIVE Stars! (2.7 oz, Active ingredient: aluminum zirconium tetrachlorohydrex GLY 15.2 %)</li>
    <li> I usually don&#x27;t use anything but Right Gaurd clear gell because it is the only deoderant that does not make my armpit burn and itch. but this did not make me break out or itch. I don&#x27;t like the white residue however and it didn&#x27;t last as long as my right gaurd. by 7 PM I had started to develope a musk and being as I am not middle eastern, i have no misguided notions about such scents being attractive. It is undoubtedly the smell of a man, but what kind of man?</li>
    <li> It has an after shave scent to it. It is an anti-perspirant. Most men like a little wetness to help them cool off. The active ingredient in Secret is 19%, Degree 17.8%, and Dove 15.2%. That’s why it is not totally dry. The container is wider to fit a man’s hand. It is a solid which is what men prefer except for those who like an aerosol spray.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m huge into Dove care products and I&#x27;m almost always a fan. However I clearly have a bad reaction to Dove Antiperspirant deodorant; it causes my armpits to be very itchy and it results them being tender. I want to note that I&#x27;m sure many people have a fantastic experience with it, and it even helps me not to perspire. But those who are like me and have sensitive skin should be weary of it, it can be very uncomfortable. I have not yet found a good antiperspirant alternative so I can&#x27;t recommend, but if you&#x27;ve ever had problems this is not the one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One complaint though that probably is true for everyone is that it&#x27;s very hard to wash off. I have to scrub really well for it to wash off in the shower. I think that&#x27;s just the nature of solid antiperspirants though.</li>
    <li> Nice smell but very pungent.</li>
    <li> Works and smells great!</li>
    <li> The men +care line has become my favorite deodorant and antiperspirant. this particular scent is no exception. it has a subtle citrus scent that has a hint of sweetness to it. It isn&#x27;t overpowering but still strong enough to be noticed. as an antiperspirant I&#x27;ve found nothing that works better.</li>
    <li> Dove&#x27;s Men + Care Anti-Perspirant Deodorant promises &amp;#34;48 hours of powerful protection.&amp;#34; While I have not yet had occasion to see if this were true, it is true that Dove does offer at least 24 hours of powerful protection. That protections did also come with the as-promised non-irritation as well, which was a big deal since my previous attempt at a &amp;#34;clinical&amp;#34; formulation (Degree) failed to follow through on either the protection nor the irritation promise.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would call the strength of the scent &amp;#34;middle of the road.&amp;#34; If you are used to the Old Spice Fresh Collection, the scent of Dove will be less noticeable. The scent is gender-neutral so that women could use this product if they wished to do so and would not smell like a man. The scent itself is actually neutral as I found it not particularly appealing but not especially repugnant. If it had a better scent, I would give it 5 stars.</li>
    <li> After seeing the commercials I was looking for these in stores.  When the opportunity arose, I picked one up from Amazon.  Overall this is a great product.  It goes on very smoothly (some sticks go on a little rough) and the scent is very nice but not &amp;#34;girly&amp;#34;.  It does last!  It doesn&#x27;t irritate your skin.  Some of the reviews mention residue which I don&#x27;t understand.  You are applying a product to your pits, it is supposed to be there.  It certainly wasn&#x27;t flaky or anything.  Don&#x27;t know what else to say about it but that its a great product and I would definitely recommend and buy it again!</li>
    <li> My girlfriend is my first judge when it comes to deodorant scents - if she wrinkles her nose, that&#x27;s not a good sign! But for this one, she thought it was a fresh, light scent that she approved of.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I normally like gel deodorants, but I also liked the fresh scent here, and I liked how it did not linger after putting it on. I didn&#x27;t notice any streaking on clothes, but I&#x27;m sure it does that, like all chalky deodorants.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#x27;s winter, so it&#x27;s hard to judge how it will do in the heat - but I&#x27;ve never noticed much difference in anything. Most of these work about the same, and I&#x27;m mostly interested in the scent, and how much it lingers (especially if the g/f doesn&#x27;t like it!).</li>
    <li> My husband loves this product. Great protection with a nice scent to it.</li>
    <li> I preface this by saying that I do marketing for a living.  Hence, I pay a lot more attention to brand positioning, marketing claims on packaging, price/value relationships, and comparisons between brands than your average Joe.  Some of you will read this and think I have lost my mind.  You are right.  I have lost my mind, but we digress.  Let&#x27;s talk about anti-perspirant deodorant for a bit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For starters, I am a regular Degree for Men user.  Hence, when I first looked at this product, it struck me as my exact same packaging, except a different color scheme.  Indeed, it is the same packaging--same shape, same twisty bottom to raise the stick, same curves/contours, same 2.7 ounces per stick, everything.  This made it a dead giveaway.  This was obviously made by the same manufacturer as Degree for Men.  Yep.  Unilever.  Not very creative, but style doesn&#x27;t mean a lot to me in this category.  I was OK with that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next, I compared the Active Ingredients on this product to my Degree for Men.  Since this Dove Men product carries a 48-hour protection claim, I thought it must surely have more and/or different Active Ingredients.  NOPE!  In fact, it has LESS of the same exact Active Ingredient in it than the Degree for Men (around 15% for Dove Men, around 18% for Degree for Men).  So, the marketing claim says 48-hour protection, but you are actually getting product with less Active Ingredient than another brand that doesn&#x27;t make such a claim.  Not what I like to see.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now let&#x27;s talk about price.  This Dove Men brand is clearly a premium brand to Degree for Men, judging purely by its HUGE price premium on Amazon.  If you were actually getting something worth paying for that you don&#x27;t get with Degree for Men, I might respect them for launching into a premium tier to expand their market.  Instead, it bugs me that they are only creating a PERCEPTION of superiority, rather than actually delivering the goods, so to speak.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for smell, my wife asked me if I was wearing cologne or something.  If I had been wearing cologne, that would have led to a whole series of other questions, but let&#x27;s not get into the dynamics of marriage and making sure that everybody is grooming himself consistently.  Fortunately, I was able to answer, &amp;#34;No, why do you ask?&amp;#34;  When I pointed out that I was testing this new anti-perspirant deodorant, she smelled my armpits and said, &amp;#34;Yep, that&#x27;s it.&amp;#34;  If you think it&#x27;s odd that my wife would smell my armpits, then you are not married.  Consider it preferable to dogs, who smell one another in other ways, even when they don&#x27;t know one another.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lastly, does it work?  Yeah, it works, but that is a pretty low bar for evaluation when you are talking about a luxury product that is far more costly than just about any alternative.  I expected more out of this product, given its positioning and price, than what I got.  For these reasons, I am not a fan.  Generously, I am giving it 2 stars.  My recommendation, buy Degree for Men instead.  Better price, more of the same exact Active Ingredient, same exact packaging in a different color.wife asked me if I was wearing cologne or something.

    <li> Subtle and nice.  The scent is light, and it is only noticeable when you seek for it.  I highly recommend it if you don&#x27;t want an overbearing scent and you just want to smell fresh for a good 24 hours.</li>
    <li> While it does a decent job as deodorant, I don&#x27;t quite like the scent of it - it has a soapy, mild, feminine scent that doesn&#x27;t really feel like it&#x27;s a men&#x27;s deodorant, and to me is a little cloying and unpleasant. I found Degree to have a far more pleasant scent and one that actually feels &amp;#34;manly&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> Love the product and will order again. Thank you.</li>
    <li> I can use this in the morning, and it works all day. There were no problems with the application, it isn&#x27;t messy at all. I really like the Dove Men line.</li>
    <li> Good product, good price!</li>
    <li> First off, let me start by saying that the claim of 48-hour odor and wetness protection is ridiculous. This will not last 48 hours. It pretty much has the same active ingredient as the other Unilever deodorant brands (Axe, Degree, Dove). My husband has used (uses) all three of these brands, and the only real difference is the fragrance and the strength of each fragrance. They all work well, but not 48 hours well.&lt;br /&gt;As for the fragrance, it is pleasant enough and not overpowering. A good product, but nothing out of the ordinary.</li>
    <li> I love this Dove Men+ Care product. It has a wonderfully fresh scent, and it provides enduring protection that applies cleanly and feels comfortably dry. This is one of my favorite anti-perspirant deodorant sticks.</li>
    <li> I have always liked the Dove Men + Care stuff.  This is no exception.  It works well and has a nice scent.  Happy with the purchase.</li>
    <li> This is a stick (white semi wet powder) and it leaves reside in your skin and in your clothes. The scent is nice and clean and it applies easily, however after 12-16 hrs that &amp;#34;fresh awake&amp;#34; is gone. If you just apply for the day you will be fine but if you are in a situation that you have to go longer than 24 hrs without a shower then i would say you need to re-apply. Not a bad product but would definitely stick with clear gels for my purposes.</li>
    <li> Just the kind of deodorant I like.  No scent (or the scent is so slight you don&#x27;t notice it).  Aluminum anti-bacteria base - which I prefer.  sticky enough to adhere but doesn&#x27;t make a mess.  Easily applied.  Long lasting.</li>
    <li> I really like this product. The scent is fresh and energizing, but not overpowering. It won&#x27;t irritate sensitive skin and the antiperspirant lasts all day. Highly recommended.</li>
    <li> This goes on smooth and helps me stay dry.  I like the scent as it is not overpowering, and does not affect my cologne.  You have to let it dry a bit before putting on your clothes as you will get deodorant streaks on it if you do not.  I cannot attest to the 48 hour protection as I like to shower daily, but it has been working great every day since I started using it.  I&#x27;ve used Dove deodorants before and they even work great in the Summer when it is 100+ degrees.  However, the sweating results are a bit different.  No deodorant stops sweat from happening in Summer heatwave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have sensitive dry skin and this does not bother my skin.  I like this product and will purchase it in the future.  I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> better than clean comfort, should sell a 2 pack</li>
    <li> Smells good and doesn&#x27;t stain my husband&#x27;s clothes</li>
    <li> Goes on clear and dry, and the smell is virtually un-noticable.  Seems to be pretty effective and I like the packaging as well - it&#x27;s easy to use and reliable.</li>
    <li> Not so sure about the 48 hour protection claim, but it does get you through a day without any wetness or odor. The scent is nice and not overpowering. It won&#x27;t interfere with your cologne, but if you get close enough you can smell it. It actually is a fresh scent .. energetic is the word that comes to mind. No irritations and no peeling skin on the underarms, which was a plus. Certain deodorants can cause some peeling or darkening of the skin, but this one did not do that.</li>
    <li> I like this Dove deodorant and Anti-Perspirant but I don&#x27;t know about the 48 hour claim --I&#x27;m sorry, I shower once a day without fail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That aside I found it be effective and gentle.  It goes on damp, but dries fairly quickly. I didn&#x27;t note any &#x27;white marks&#x27; on clothing.  And I should say that I also like the Fresh Awake scent. It&#x27;s nice and it isn&#x27;t overdone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as effectiveness it works well. There&#x27;s no hint of odor even on busy days, but oddly it left me feeling a bit sticky.</li>
    <li> We love Dove products and this deodorant is no exception. It has a masculine scent without being overpowering, goes on smoothly and lasts all day. My husband liked this deodorant and had no complaints. All in all a great product!</li>
    <li> This Fresh Awake scent is a real light scent, less cologne smelling than the others that I like. Smells fresh and good.</li>
    <li> great deodorant, smells great, last long</li>
    <li> The fresh scent gets stale in about 1 hour, or less on me. There seems to be nothing masculine about this. Well, Dove soap is very mild; the deodorant must be as well. I don&#x27;t want to walk about smelling like roses, but smelling like a locker room isn&#x27;t much better. I exercise several days per week. I want a deodorant/antiperspirant that I can don, and not get too smelly after reading, or walking. Dove missed the boat this time. This is something to offer teenage girls, not men.</li>
    <li> Works well and smells pretty good.</li>
