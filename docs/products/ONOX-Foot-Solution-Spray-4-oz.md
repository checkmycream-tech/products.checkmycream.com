      <li>I have never been able to wear sandals or go sockless.  </li>
      <li>And one more time.</li>
      <li>and I love it.......</li>
      <li>but for most of us this stuff will truly help.</li>
      <li>and some days have more issues than others.</li>
      <li>Keeps them dryer, eliminated odor, make them also&lt;br /&gt;feel and look better.</li>
      <li>Do you have anything that&#x27;s fights odor better?</li>
      <li>And yet one more.  </li>
      <li>Now I can be comfortable, my feet don&#x27;t stink anymore.</li>
      <li>no smell feed at all, feel comfortable all day....</li>
      <li>Did the trick for a loved one who was self conscious when removing shoes in the house.</li>
      <li>Then I bought a special soap and scrub, and applied this thing, no luck.  </li>
      <li>My son had very sweaty feet, and this product really worked well and made him feel more confident.</li>
      <li>I can wear a pair of shoes or boots for a full day and when I remove them there is zero oder from my feet.  </li>
      <li>Simply put, it is amazing.  </li>
      <li>it is worth it...</li>
      <li>I spray (a bunch of it) over my feet through toes and then put socks on right away to hold in the the stuff.  </li>
      <li>I had tried many products before and this is the only one that has worked so well.</li>
      <li>I have to say, this works exactly as promised.  </li>
      <li>Hot and humid as hell.  </li>
      <li>I followed the instructions and the first day it didn&#x27;t work.  </li>
      <li>I gave it the benefit of the doubt, and tried one more time next day.</li>
      <li>This product works reliably, from the first time I applied the product it works.</li>
      <li>This works very well and fast!  </li>
      <li>I&#x27;m actually able to wear tennis shoes all day long without smelly or over sweating.  </li>
      <li>i will certainly be ordering this again &amp; have not had any skin come off</li>
      <li>Onox totally works for me and now I don&#x27;t have to dread taking my shoes off in public, or worry about ruining cute summer shoes!</li>
      <li>This stuff really works...</li>
      <li>thanks amazon</li>
      <li>I really don&#x27;t tknow if this product works.  </li>
      <li>I tried this, but I really don&#x27;t feel like it ever worked.</li>
      <li>I wear compression hosiery at work, and the feet of the hose get very smelly.</li>
      <li>I really like this product.  </li>
      <li>This product has worked very well for me.  </li>
      <li>I do this once a day and have not had any problem with over sweating (you still sweat some) or smelly feet - really a godsend</li>
      <li>You spray it on and it is pure liquid - not a powder spray like most other foot sprays.  </li>
      <li>and my feet are dry and scent free for the whole day.  </li>
      <li>Some reviewers said that it didn&#x27;t make their feet any dryer, and that is true, it just totally neutralizes the smell.  </li>
      <li>Highly recommended.</li>
      <li>I can wear high heel sandals in the Arizona summer heat without sliding around in my shoes...</li>
      <li>this product definetly reduces the amount of sweating, not perfect, but a great improvement.</li>
      <li>And now the skin on the bottom of my feet looks completely normal.  </li>
      <li>Now I can have a normal life....</li>
      <li>one time i even waited a full hour of swinging my feet to let it air dry</li>
      <li>I couldn&#x27;t live without this stuff.  </li>
      <li>This is the first product I have come across to actually help with the smell, and the sweating.  </li>
      <li>It makes your feel feel cool, but it doesn&#x27;t dry fast or keep your feet dry.  </li>
      <li>After reading the reviews I felt confident to try this product, though unfortuanately it didn&#x27;t work for me at all, not in the least.</li>
      <li>I have very sweaty feet and prior to this spray, couldn&#x27;t take my shoes off in the car without gassing my family.  </li>
      <li>Over a period of a couple months it completely removed the &amp;#34;swiss cheese&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>Nothing really worked, and I&#x27;ve had to throw a ton of pairs of shoes away due to irreversible stink.  </li>

<li> I had tried a Lavilin foot deodorant product that worked very well, but it was a white cream that made streaks on the hose, and cost $19 for less than half an ounce.</li>
<li> and I cannot tell you what a relief it is not only physically, but mentally.  </li>
<li> Lesson here is never to wait too long for returns.</li>
<li> Those who have sweaty feet no matter what you do, this keeps them dry (not over dry) eliminates odor and itcing.</li>
<li> but i just felt my feet getting sweatier and sweatier because this product wouldnt dry.</li>
<li> , about 3-4 sprays per foot, then kinda swing my foot around in the air a bit to help it dry.  </li>
<li> It helped the smell a little, but at the end of the day, it was definitely still there.</li>
<li> No longer are the bottoms of my feet like prunes from being wet all the time.</li>
<li> skin and now I have absolutely no foot oder.  </li>
<li> how in the world is it supposed to stop sweat if it doesnt dry??!!</li>
<li> but when you spray it on, you can still see the small wet dots and they dont dry out unless you have to blot it with a towel, which totally defeats the purpose!</li>
<li> Apparently the oder issue and the skin issue was due to my feet perspiring excessively.  </li>
<li> as I used to try all types of other sprays and electrolysis (which didn&#x27;t work for me).  </li>
<li> i know there are extreme cases out there</li>
<li> however, i sprayed it on after showering and this product stays wet on your feet instead of drying!</li>
<li> Holy cow.  </li>
<li> My sole complaint is that after a couple of months the spray stops working, and this happened on all the bottles I have owned.</li>
<li> This does little or nothing for me.</li>
<li> This does not work as well as Klima, which works a little for me.</li>
<li> Go to the doctor and save yourself the trouble.  </li>
<li> My husband has used it in the past and it worked just as well this time.</li>
<li> I use it everyday!</li>
<li> Only thing that has helped me after wasting money on products and expensive socks.</li>
<li> I will say I was doubtful when I first got it.  </li>
<li> my feet sweat as i am on my feet all day &amp; wearing doc martins (i am a die hard docs fan)</li>
<li> It removes  completely the humidity that causes bad smell.</li>
<li> Guess I waited to late to return it</li>
<li> I was hesitant as I didn&#x27;t know what to expect as I have been disappointed several times..</li>
<li> the sweat star decreased ..</li>
<li> It makes it worse.</li>
<li> If my business casual work shoes are too thick, beware when I take off my shoes.  </li>
<li> I am unfortunately one of those people; for those with hyperhidrosis out there, I hope it works for you, but if it doesn&#x27;t and find something that does, please let me know.</li>
<li> It will make your athletes foot much worse!  </li>
<li> I&#x27;m not impressed.  </li>
<li> getting that awful smell....if the factory was to close down, I don&#x27;t know what I would do....</li>

    <li> Honestly I can&#x27;t believe how well this stuff works.  I&#x27;m actually able to wear tennis shoes all day long without smelly or over sweating.

    <li> I really like this product.  I think it does an excellent job with foot and shoe odor.</li>
    <li> After reading the reviews I felt confident to try this product, though unfortuanately it didn&#x27;t work for me at all, not in the least.</li>
    <li> This product does not help sweaty feet. It makes your feel feel cool, but it doesn&#x27;t dry fast or keep your feet dry.  If you have sweaty feet, i suggest aluminum chloride at night and foot powder and wool socks (Smartwools are best) during the day. Only thing that has helped me after wasting money on products and expensive socks.</li>
    <li> Before I found Onox, I tried a ton of different things to try and combat the dreaded smell!  Nothing really worked, and I&#x27;ve had to throw a ton of pairs of shoes away due to irreversible stink.  Some reviewers said that it didn&#x27;t make their feet any dryer, and that is true, it just totally neutralizes the smell.  Onox totally works for me and now I don&#x27;t have to dread taking my shoes off in public, or worry about ruining cute summer shoes!</li>
    <li> This does little or nothing for me. This does not work as well as Klima, which works a little for me.</li>
    <li> I have never been able to wear sandals or go sockless.  If my business casual work shoes are too thick, beware when I take off my shoes.  It&#x27;s embarrassing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This stuff is amazing.  I spray it on, about 3-4 sprays per foot, then kinda swing my foot around in the air a bit to help it dry.  All my problems are gone.  I went to Oklahoma on vacation.  Hot and humid as hell.  I took a chance and wore sandals one day while using this.  Holy cow.  NO STINK!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Best thing ever.</li>
    <li> This product has worked very well for me.  It has transformed my feet and I cannot tell you what a relief it is not only physically, but mentally.  No longer do I have to be embarrassed with foot odor or sweaty feet.  No longer are the bottoms of my feet like prunes from being wet all the time.</li>
    <li> I followed the instructions and the first day it didn&#x27;t work.  I gave it the benefit of the doubt, and tried one more time next day. And one more time. And yet one more.  Then I bought a special soap and scrub, and applied this thing, no luck.  Did a backflip, walked backwards for two blocks and applied at 11:35 p.m.  Didn&#x27;t work.  I guess sometimes things just do not work for some people.  I am unfortunately one of those people; for those with hyperhidrosis out there, I hope it works for you, but if it doesn&#x27;t and find something that does, please let me know.</li>
    <li> My son had very sweaty feet, and this product really worked well and made him feel more confident.</li>
    <li> I have to say, this works exactly as promised.  Nice smelling tootsies, and boy, I was getting desperate.  My sole complaint is that after a couple of months the spray stops working, and this happened on all the bottles I have owned.</li>
    <li> I use this and never have to worry about food odor, especially in the summer when I tend to go barefoot in someof my sandals or shoes.</li>
    <li> I couldn&#x27;t live without this stuff.  Without it, the humidity in Florida makes my feet sweat as soon as I step out the door.  I apply it in the morning and I am good to go all day.</li>
    <li> from the time I was a teenager (i&#x27;m 57 now) I had a terrible foot oder that I could not get rid of.  Even a visit to a deremtologist didn&#x27;t help.  The oder was so bad it was embarassing to remove my shoes.  The skin on the bottom of my feet look like swiss cheese.  About 9 years or so ago I ran across this product.  Simply put, it is amazing.  Apparently the oder issue and the skin issue was due to my feet perspiring excessively.  Once I starting using Onox things changed.  Over a period of a couple months it completely removed the &amp;#34;swiss cheese&amp;#34; skin and now I have absolutely no foot oder.  I can wear a pair of shoes or boots for a full day and when I remove them there is zero oder from my feet.  And now the skin on the bottom of my feet looks completely normal.  For me this product was a Godsend!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not impressed.  I really don&#x27;t tknow if this product works.  But I have been using a lot of different products together and some days have more issues than others.</li>
    <li> Do not use this product.  It will make your athletes foot much worse!  Go to the doctor and save yourself the trouble.  They will probably prescribe a pill to stabalize your yeast levels and a cream to put on your foot.  This product does not work.  It makes it worse.</li>
    <li> Awesome product for anyone who doesn&#x27;t want to wear socks</li>
    <li> Did the trick for a loved one who was self conscious when removing shoes in the house.</li>
    <li> Have used it for the last 3 years when wearing hose. Does the trick!</li>
    <li> This works very well and fast!  My husband has used it in the past and it worked just as well this time.</li>
    <li> For me it i dosent work.</li>
    <li> i read the reviews and decided to give this stuff a try...my feet sweat as i am on my feet all day &amp; wearing doc martins (i am a die hard docs fan) does not help...i will say this does work great &amp; agree with another reviewer that you do need to scrub your feet well in the shower before using this stuff...(i cant imagine why you would not do this if you have sweaty feet &amp; are worried about smell)    i will certainly be ordering this again &amp; have not had any skin come off but again i scrub my feet..use this stuff with moisture wicking socks and you are good to go. i know there are extreme cases out there but for most of us this stuff will truly help.</li>
    <li> i was desperate for this product! i couldnt wait till i recieved it. however, i sprayed it on after showering and this product stays wet on your feet instead of drying! i dont know what its made of but when you spray it on, you can still see the small wet dots and they dont dry out unless you have to blot it with a towel, which totally defeats the purpose! one time i even waited a full hour of swinging my feet to let it air dry but i just felt my feet getting sweatier and sweatier because this product wouldnt dry. how in the world is it supposed to stop sweat if it doesnt dry??!! i need another item desperately i must return this!</li>
    <li> My son has had sweaty, smelly feet for years, even to the point that I bought a shoe deodorizer to remove the smell, which sometimes the shoes had to be on it for days to remove the smell. I saw this Onox product in the Footsmart catalog &amp; tried it. I spray his feet with this product before he puts his feet into any shoes, including his slippers &amp; we do not have smelly shoes anymore! I love this product and recommend it to everyone!!!</li>
    <li> I always had a problem of my feet sweating and as a result I was in desperate need of a product that can eliminate the smell associated with the sweating. I went by the doctor and she couldn&#x27;t help me. I was told to change my shoe, but there was no change. I started trying different products from pouring baking soda in my shoe, putting on deodarant, desenex foot spray, mycota cream and mycota spray....my efforts were futile. I didn&#x27;t give up my search online...i continued and I came across this product. I was hesitant as I didn&#x27;t know what to expect as I have been disappointed several times..But I decided to give it a try, it&#x27;s either it work or it didnt work....Today, I am happy that I made that decision and gave it a try...I have been using this product 8 months now....and I love it.......Words cant express how relieved I am....I was so shocked at the outcome..Not even a smell....Now I can have a normal life....taking off my shoes and not having to worry about the people around me getting that awful smell....if the factory was to close down, I don&#x27;t know what I would do....I recommend this product to everybody...give it a shot...it is worth it...trust me&lt;br /&gt;Thank you Onox Foot Solution, you saved my life &amp;lt;3</li>
    <li> I have been using this product for the last year, I had problems because a swear a lot then food smell. After this, that is not longer a problem.</li>
    <li> This stuff works great for stinking feet and socks.  Keeps them dryer, eliminated odor, make them also&lt;br /&gt;feel and look better.</li>
    <li> I have very sweaty feet and prior to this spray, couldn&#x27;t take my shoes off in the car without gassing my family.  This spray is truly life-changing!!  One spray in the morning and my feet are dry and scent free for the whole day.  I had tried many products before and this is the only one that has worked so well.</li>
    <li> This product works reliably, from the first time I applied the product it works.This is a reliable product compared to powders in the market.</li>
    <li> I have somehow inherited the smelly feet gene.  This is the first product I have come across to actually help with the smell, and the sweating.  I&#x27;ve used the product for well over 6 months now.  I have already ordered a couple bottles, and have given them as gifts to fellow smelly footed relatives!!</li>
    <li> using this product for years recommened by my foot doctor. Those who have sweaty feet no matter what you do, this keeps them dry (not over dry) eliminates odor and itcing. Use daily.</li>
    <li> I wear compression hosiery at work, and the feet of the hose get very smelly. I had tried a Lavilin foot deodorant product that worked very well, but it was a white cream that made streaks on the hose, and cost $19 for less than half an ounce. I tried this, but I really don&#x27;t feel like it ever worked. It helped the smell a little, but at the end of the day, it was definitely still there. I guess I will keep looking.</li>
    <li> This product solve my perspiration and stink problem with my feet. It&#x27;s incredible. It removes  completely the humidity that causes bad smell. I used to be so embarrassed of my feet that I refused to remove my shoes in any place but in private. Now I can be comfortable, my feet don&#x27;t stink anymore.</li>
    <li> Its a great improvement, but l&#x27;m still experiencing some foot odor. Do you have anything that&#x27;s fights odor better?</li>
    <li> My teenage son plays sports and he&#x27;s shoes were ALWAYS stinky, so I read up on this stuff and bought it.  Didn&#x27;t work for what I wanted it for. Guess I waited to late to return it, so I could not get a refund.  Lesson here is never to wait too long for returns.</li>
