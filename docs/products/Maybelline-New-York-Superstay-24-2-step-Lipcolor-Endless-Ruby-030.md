<li> I have tried other 24 hour or long wearing lipsticks and no one compares to Maybelline...</li>
<li> The other brand got tossed aside immediately.  </li>
<li> I do wear other shades of superstay also!  </li>
<li> Not 24 hours, but holds up longer then other lipsticks I&#x27;ve had !!</li>

    <li> This lipstick is everything that it claims to be. I have been using Maybelline Superstay since it first came out, it&#x27;s the only lipstick I buy.</li>
    <li> I love love love this. I originally got it because I love lipstick, but I don&#x27;t like getting it all over my fiance when I kiss him. It not only solved that problem, but I no longer get lipstick over cups, forks, and anything else that touches them too. I don&#x27;t need to reapply it unless I eat something greasy (it&#x27;s fat soluble, so I use coconut oil to remove it). I have 10 colors because I lipstick is my favorite part of my makeup ensemble, and they&#x27;re worth every penny. Please don&#x27;t ever stop making this product!</li>
    <li> At the last minute on my wedding day I realized I didn&#x27;t have any lipstick!  My dress and veil was very \\&quot;Old Hollywood\\&quot; so I needed a red lip, ASAP! I sent my mother to the drugstore to get a lip color that was based on her opinion, \\&quot;whatever color red would look best\\&quot;.  She looked at me with wide opened eyes asking for a better description of the color, but I gave her full power.  She came back with two different brands of long-wear lipstick.  The Maybelline Super Stay 24 color in Endless Ruby was perfection!!!!  The other brand got tossed aside immediately.  The color was perfect, a slightly cool tone red, not screaming fire engine red.  It only feels a little dry without the balm, but all long-wear lip color feels dry.  It is imperative that a red lipstick not feather, and this one did not fail!  My lips stayed ruby red all night, and my husbands lips, cheeks, neck, etc., stayed lipstick free!  That was 6 years ago, my mother died this year, and I&#x27;m buying this product again so I can think of her and my perfect wedding every time I wear it!</li>
    <li> This is the only lipstick i wear.  It is so hard to find in this color...I love it!  I put it on in the morning and that is it...it really does last all day long!!!</li>
    <li> Love this lipstick!! Not 24 hours, but holds up longer then other lipsticks I&#x27;ve had !!</li>
    <li> Have been using this for years. They discontinued this color. Happy I found it.</li>
    <li> I have used this for quit some time and when I could not find it in the store I was devastated to say the least.  I found several similar colors by different makers and none were even close to how well this stays on or &#x3D; in color ( this lasts ALL DAY) even after eating Spaghetti or Taco&#x27;s. LOVE it!!!!!</li>
    <li> Overall product work well for me. Will purchase again.</li>
    <li> This lipstick stays.  It obeys.</li>
    <li> Love this line of lipsticks. Too bad they do not sell it in stores anymore.</li>
    <li> How disappointing that this color has been discontinued in most stores.  It is the perfect color and goes with everything.  I am grateful I can still get it at Amazon.</li>
    <li> this is my favorite shade, and my signature color!!! I do wear other shades of superstay also!  I have been using it since inception...I have tried other 24 hour or long wearing lipsticks and no one compares to Maybelline...I am a daily,  all day lipstick wearer.... I have been unable to find this shade at any local stores in Tampa, Florida that I have been to. This includes, Walgeens..CVS or Walmart!!  This is the only brand of lipstick and products I use....I have trusted and used Maybelline for years.  Plese don&#x27;t stop making Superstay!!!!  Or this SHADE!!!!!  I will continue to buy it on line. I love that it does not get on my glass, cup or fork and my husband loves that I kiss him and he doesn&#x27;t have to wear it too!!  It&#x27;s the BEST!!!  thank you</li>
    <li> doesn&#x27;t stay for 24 hours but damn close to it.</li>
    <li> Superstay 36 hour lipstick.  The biggest problem?  Getting it off!  (make up remover, baby oil or vaseline)</li>
    <li> This is the one color I&#x27;ve been hunting all over town and most have discontinue this color. I&#x27;m truly thankful that I was able to find this thru Amazon!!! I got this 3 days from the day I order this. I highly recommend!!! Great service and fast shipping!!! :)</li>
    <li> Received it in a few days and was exactly what I wanted.</li>
    <li> It definitely lasts for a long time, the problem is that it is very difficult to apply. Once you apply it incorrectly, it is not east to fix.</li>
    <li> I only use permanent lipsticks. This color is fun and it doesn&#x27;t bleed.</li>
    <li> This is the best lipcolor ever!  I put it on in the morning and it pretty much lasts all day.  I love the color.  I will be back for more!  Thank you for a great product!  I will tell all my friends about this seller.</li>
    <li> Follow the directions and this stuff really does stay on forever. It&#x27;s amazing. I put it on for a test run and went out to dinner. Ate, drank. The whole deal. It stays where you put it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One word of warning though, it&#x27;s tough to get off at the end of the night. Because, well. Superstay.</li>
    <li> I cant find this color anywhere.  The lipstick stays on all day and doesn&#x27;t dry your lips out.  I am so happy that I was able to get in on line!</li>
    <li> My daughter uses this for dance competitions...lasts very long....sometimes too long. But color stays true and no smudging. Easy applicator too.</li>
