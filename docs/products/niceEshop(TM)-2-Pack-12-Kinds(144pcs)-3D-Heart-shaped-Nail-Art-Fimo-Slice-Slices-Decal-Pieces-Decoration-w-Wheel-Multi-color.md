    <li> These don&#x27;t stay on very well at all. I think they lasted about a day to two days before they fell off.</li>
    <li> Though a bit hard to use, I really like these. Fun shapes and sizes. Great buy. Can&#x27;t beat&lt;br /&gt;the price. Recommend for anyone that likes to have fun with their nails.</li>
    <li> These are very cute and there are a ton of them. Great deal for the price. Only problem for me is I was hoping to use them for crafting and they&#x27;re very small which would make that difficult. Otherwise very happy with this product.</li>
    <li> I always enjoy products like these, and these will work just fine for my nail art. I was a bit sad to notice that I got two wheels exactly the same, which is a bummer. But still like the hearts.</li>
    <li> OMG..these are so tiny, I actually needed a magnifying glass to sort and place them on my nails. After a few tries, I gave up and gave them to a friends daughter....VERY difficult to use.</li>
    <li> This I got for my teen age grand daughter and she will love them. Nice variety and colors which will give her a great time of fun</li>
    <li> my daughter sure had fun putting them on her nails! I loved them as a gift and she did too!</li>
    <li> These are very cute.  Although I received two packages of them, many of the decals in each are the same.  I have two girls and the eldest loved picking out her favorite decals for her nails.  There are many cute ones and few that I do not know what the symbol is or means.  I put these are with  two clear coats to be sure they stay on.  I received this item in exchange for an honest and unbiased review.</li>
    <li> it was a very nice product to have and there were a lot of pretty designs and colors! and it was for a good price!!</li>
    <li> These nail art shapes are really tiny,but very detailed and so cute!!! I love them for nails or for my art jewelry I make!BtW...some have tiny words on them...cute!</li>
    <li> I got the 2 pack and the same art as pictured. The real deal is the price I got it for on Amazon, compared to the local Beauty shop!</li>
    <li> I didn&#x27;t like what I saw in the case.  I do not plan to use them at all.  A complete waste of my movie.</li>
    <li> Junk. Product was cheap and looks it. I should have known better. May be suitable for my little girl but I probably won&#x27;t even bother.</li>
    <li> These are really cute lil nail art shapes, can be used for scrapbooking too! the wheels are little, but that was expected, shipping was a fair amount of time for them coming so far.</li>
    <li> I bought one for myself and one for my daughter, and we both like the product! Thank you very much!</li>
    <li> I eally like the way these Nail art look on my nails. They lay flat on your nail bed. Really good for the price</li>
    <li> Horrible, basically cuts of paper that you&#x27;re supposed to put on your nails... I threw them away, you honestly get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> I ordered two packages and they arrived in a sealed container. but they didn&#x27;t really look anything like the photo. They looked like little pieces of confetti.&lt;br /&gt;But, they made my daughter-in-law happy. She likes using nail art. I got two exact same packages even though the description indicated 12 kinds. As far as being 3-D, the sure don&#x27;t look 3-D. But as I stated, they made my daughter-in-law happy. I think they&#x27;re fine for home use but not for a professional nail artist.</li>
