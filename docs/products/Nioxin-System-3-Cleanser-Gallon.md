      <li>This is a great product, but it would have been better if after 1 week, I got a call from the company saying they couldn&#x27;t ship it instead of an automatic email from them apologizing and giving me a refund.</li>
      <li>A very refreshing feeling after each use.  </li>
      <li>great buy - free delivery with prime!</li>
      <li>I love it!</li>
      <li>This is a great product at a super good price</li>
      <li>This is a great product because it doesn&#x27;t leave your hair dry and it has a wonderful tingle to it with the conditioner.</li>
      <li>my hair is soooo much more healthy!</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used Nioxin for 18 years now, and this is, by far, the best price I&#x27;ve found for it!  </li>
      <li>Great stuff, fast shipping.</li>
      <li>Love this shampoo.  </li>
      <li>My hair dresser started me on this years ago, it also helps with thinning/fine hair to allow the scalp to grow more hair.  </li>
      <li>My hair has transformed into healthy hair--I no longer buy store-hair products.  </li>
      <li>I love this product.</li>
      <li>and i love it</li>

      <li>My favorite shampoo for my (on the oily side) fine, color-treated hair.  </li>
      <li>good price, fast shipping</li>
      <li>My gallon of shampoo arrived very quickly and it was sealed.&lt;br /&gt;No</li>
      <li>This number of cleanser is also for fine hair and when used seems to add some body.  </li>
      <li>Love this shampoo such a great price and my hair feels so clean and tingly.</li>
      <li>The difference is significant, and I won&#x27;t use anything else.  </li>
      <li>sure if it is some kind of scam to get the price so low.  </li>
      <li>Very good value and seems to keep what little hair I have from going away</li>
      <li>/&gt;Would be even better if the cap had smaller hole that could be used to more easily fill smaller bottles</li>
      <li>Having a whole gallon to replenish my pump bottle is convenient, and I saved money!</li>
      <li>First choice.</li>
      <li>plan to buy more from this seller in the future.</li>
      <li>Product is exactly what it says it is</li>
      <li>thanks!</li>
      <li>The original Nioxin System 3 cleanser and the version made in Mexico both left my hair feeling clean up to the next days shower even if there was more than 24 hours between time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Will certainly purchase from here again.  </li>
      <li>Thanks</li>
      <li>this is the real stuff.</li>
      <li>This is not the real deal.</li>
      <li>See much improvement&lt;br</li>
      <li>Really helps those of us with hair thinning or falling out.</li>
      <li>My husband really likes it too.</li>
      <li>Delivery was fast.  </li>
      <li>Will continue to pay more per once for the liter bottle since they have never let me down.</li>
      <li>, it&#x27;s thin and fine - Nioxin is easy on my color and helps my hair seem stronger and thicker.</li>
      <li>so have I),she&#x27;s literally seeing even new hair</li>
      <li>Same Nioxin shampoo, much cheaper price than buying the liter containers.</li>
      <li>Nioxin is watered down product; price lower but quality of product much lower as well; won&#x27;t purchase again from this vendor; name is the same but content is not.</li>

<li> This on the other hand is terrible.</li>
<li> Very expensive stuff.  </li>
<li> I have had some bad experiences buying hair products on ebay.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I love this product. I color my hair, it&#x27;s thin and fine - Nioxin is easy on my color and helps my hair seem stronger and thicker.</li>
    <li> Not a problem.  We received the shampoo and cleanser as requested and on time.  No damages from shipping liquids as we did.</li>
    <li> great buy - free delivery with prime!</li>
    <li> My favorite shampoo for my (on the oily side) fine, color-treated hair.  Gives volume without weighing it down.  Tingly mint is refreshing.  It just takes a little.  Best price by the gallon.  Don&#x27;t forget a pump!</li>
    <li> Nioxin is watered down product; price lower but quality of product much lower as well; won&#x27;t purchase again from this vendor; name is the same but content is not.</li>
    <li> awesome product....awesome price</li>
    <li> thanks! Just what we always use!</li>
    <li> Nioxin 3 shampoo is for color treated or permed hair.  My hair dresser started me on this years ago, it also helps with thinning/fine hair to allow the scalp to grow more hair.  I&#x27;ve been using it for about 10 years now, and my hair dresser told me if I had not been using this product, my hair would be very thin, so I will continue to shampoo with Nioxin 3 and my son uses it also.  Very good product, would recommend this to anyone!</li>
    <li> This is a great product at a super good price</li>
    <li> Used this product for years and this price is the best I&#x27;ve ever seen.</li>
    <li> Arrived as stated. Happy with product.</li>
    <li> Have been using Nioxin cleanser for about 15 years. We follow it up with the conditioner by the same brand. My brother recommended this from someone who cut his hair one day. Other family members started using it. My husband really likes it too. We may alternate with shampoos for change up or if we run out, but always like to have this on hand. First choice.</li>
    <li> Good product. Great value.</li>
    <li> A very refreshing feeling after each use.  This price for a gallon is a bargain.</li>
    <li> I have colored hair and this product does a great job cleaning it and my scalp.  This number of cleanser is also for fine hair and when used seems to add some body.  I love it!</li>
    <li> This is not the real deal. I understand Nioxin is now made in Mexico and have used that with great results. This on the other hand is terrible. My hair feels greasy just hours after using this version of Nioxin system 3 cleanser. The original Nioxin System 3 cleanser and the version made in Mexico both left my hair feeling clean up to the next days shower even if there was more than 24 hours between time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not sure if it is some kind of scam to get the price so low.  Won&#x27;t buy this product for H&amp;H Wholesale again.  Will continue to pay more per once for the liter bottle since they have never let me down.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;d like to let everyone know that the Nixon 3 system is an exceptional shampoo.Had been recommended to my wife by several hair dressers until I decided to order it...They were RIGHT.She has always had thin,on the weak side hair,....and since she&#x27;s been using this product(and so have I),she&#x27;s literally seeing even new hair growth!!...Great product,..nuff said...The shipper also is excellent and got us the item very quickly and packed it exceptionally well.</li>
    <li> This is a great product, but it would have been better if after 1 week, I got a call from the company saying they couldn&#x27;t ship it instead of an automatic email from them apologizing and giving me a refund. I went online the same day, ordered from a different company who could ship it immediately without any issues.</li>
    <li> Product is exactly what it says it is</li>
    <li> Cannot be.the price for a whole.gallon of Nioxin shampoo!!</li>
    <li> Great stuff, fast shipping.</li>
    <li> My wife likes it, that&#x27;s all I need to know!</li>
    <li> I have used this shampoo for ten years and men, if you want to keep your hair ... This is it!!&lt;br /&gt;Best shampoo ever, by best Company. 5 stars and it saves your hair !!!</li>
    <li> Great product.  Received on time.</li>
    <li> A great shampoo in affordable size. It is always on hand for a refill.</li>
    <li> Great shampoo, great price and on time delivery :) Thanks</li>
    <li> Very good value and seems to keep what little hair I have from going away&lt;br /&gt;Would be even better if the cap had smaller hole that could be used to more easily fill smaller bottles</li>
    <li> Love this shampoo such a great price and my hair feels so clean and tingly.</li>
    <li> I have been using Nioxin for years. I was just happy to find it in a gallon container so I would not have to purchase it during my low pay season</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t seen any results as of yet. I don&#x27;t care for the smell either.</li>
    <li> its cheaper to buy this way and i love it my hair is soooo much more healthy! My hair is actually growing.</li>
    <li> Very good product and great price thank you</li>
    <li> I&amp;#34;m very happy with the product. have use it for years.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for 3-4 years.  It definitely halted the thinning of my hair.  And this is the cheapest I have ever found it.  Delivery was fast.  Will certainly purchase from here again.  Although, a gallon should last a long time.  Go Navy Beat Army !!!</li>
    <li> Same price as the tiny salon bottle. Really helps those of us with hair thinning or falling out.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for over 3 years and it works.  My hair has transformed into healthy hair--I no longer buy store-hair products.  Nioxin has caused my hair to re-grow at a healthier rate.  You must use the entire system.  Stay away from store hair products!  They dry your head and leave build up on your scalp too.  Hinders hair growth.  This stuff works!</li>
    <li> Same Nioxin shampoo, much cheaper price than buying the liter containers.</li>
    <li> The best hair care product available for thinning hair</li>
    <li> I have a fuller head of head since I started using it several years ago.</li>
    <li> I have had some bad experiences buying hair products on ebay. The last nioxin  I ordered smelled sour and did not look right.&lt;br /&gt;It went into the trash can. No more eBay for me with things like this.&lt;br /&gt;Now, for this purchase and review. My gallon of shampoo arrived very quickly and it was sealed.&lt;br /&gt;No doubt about it this is the real stuff. I have used it for several years and it will be the only one&lt;br /&gt;For me. My hair was very thin due to illness and kept falling out. See much improvement&lt;br /&gt;After Starting Nioxin.&lt;br /&gt;If you have thin hair you should consider trying nioxin...&lt;br /&gt;I plan to buy more from this seller in the future.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used Nioxin for 18 years now, and this is, by far, the best price I&#x27;ve found for it!  Nioxin is great for those of us with thinning hair (stress and thyoroid problems, in my case).  I suggested it to my 80-year--old aunt, and she is thrilled with the results!</li>

    <li> Great product.  Will order again!</li>
    <li> Love this shampoo.  And it is a great value in the gallon jug size!</li>
    <li> My hair started thinning a bit several years ago, so i started using Nioxin.  The difference is significant, and I won&#x27;t use anything else.  Having a whole gallon to replenish my pump bottle is convenient, and I saved money!</li>
    <li> Excellant product and a great price</li>
    <li> Great product at a great price.</li>
    <li> I have to use Nioxin due to allergies.  Very expensive stuff.  This is the cheapest way to purchase it. The product is the same as in the small bottles.</li>
