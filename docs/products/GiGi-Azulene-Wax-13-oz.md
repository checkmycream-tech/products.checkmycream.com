      <li>This is my favorite of all.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sticking with Gigi all the way:)</li>
      <li>This is my favorite wax I have used.</li>
      <li>I use this wax for my legs and really works great, I love it</li>
      <li>Can&#x27;t do anything but throw it out and order more creme wax.</li>
      <li>ok I&#x27;m just going to do a patch to see how it is.</li>
      <li>but I got most of the hair.</li>
      <li>I will never try another wax again, the Azulene is simply the BEST.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s okay if you&#x27;re a seasoned waxer and good at handling the applicator.</li>
      <li>Once it was hot and ready to go, it was awesome!</li>
      <li>While this wax is sticky, it is also very smooth and easy to use.</li>
      <li>Well this wax was good, it took the hair off exactly as I wanted</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried so many hot waxes and the Azulene is by far the BEST.  </li>
      <li>It works great, and I have been using gigi brand wax for nearly 15 years.</li>
      <li>Great for sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>I think this is a great wax for sensitive skin.</li>
      <li>doesn&#x27;t work very well for legs.it&#x27;s good for the price and convenient factor.</li>
      <li>and it comes off easily.</li>
      <li>easy on the skin.</li>
      <li>I have a lot of home waxing experience and it&#x27;s easiest to just lay out newspapers so that all the drippings can we wrapped up easily and nothing gets on your floor/</li>
      <li>The residue doesn&#x27;t come off easily with after wax lotion, and it doesn&#x27;t go on smoothly either.  </li>
      <li>Works fine.</li>
      <li>Gentle on skin and a great buy for an all-around wax!</li>
      <li>But by far the best gigi wax that I have ever used so far.</li>
      <li>I doubt it would even fit into the warmer not</li>
      <li>Honee doesn&#x27;t effectively remove all the hair and sticks to the skin too much.</li>
      <li>and it smells amazing and really sooths the irritation and redness.</li>
      <li>Goes on smooth and no redness or bumps.</li>
      <li>My legs were really smooth afterwards</li>
      <li>Leaves smooth skin.</li>
      <li>It is a best seller in Spain, where waxing is more common than shaving.</li>
      <li>Good for sensitive skin</li>
      <li>It leaves me clean and smooth.</li>
      <li>new to waxing, love this one way better than the teatree one.</li>
      <li>The wax was delivered unbelievably fast and it is even more unbelieveably easy to spread and use.</li>
      <li>This is the best, I never burn or tear my skin, its hard to over heat and applies smoothy and no annoying residue</li>
      <li>I use baby oil afterward to clean off any residual wax from my skin or fingers.</li>
      <li>I let it cool for a hour and no luck with that.</li>
      <li>Works well &amp; stays liquid when cool.</li>
      <li>Heats up quickly.</li>
      <li>Its SUPER sticky during and afterwards.</li>
      <li>this was is amazing, easy to apply, minimal pain, no smell, and easily comes of unwanted areas with hot water n a towel</li>
      <li>Ok, I am new to wax warmers.  </li>
      <li>Also, it&#x27;s definitely a good idea to go to a salon first if you&#x27;re doing a brazilian and then try to do it yourself when it just starts to grow back in...</li>
      <li>If you dont yank fast, residual wax will stay, but it is easy to fix, just use another strip.</li>
      <li>So I tried this hoping it would be better for my sensitive skin</li>
      <li>I would only suggest to get your own warmer</li>
      <li>I had originally bought the whole Brazilian waxing kit.</li>
      <li>so it heats the wax to the right temperature.&lt;br</li>
      <li>However, if you finally apply it in the correct way, it takes off hair pretty nicely.</li>
      <li>Great wax def better then the hard wax on my sensitive skin heats up well</li>
      <li>I have very sensitive skin and waxing always makes my skin bright red and sore for hours, sometimes days.</li>
      <li>My favorite part is that it doesn&#x27;t completely harden so you can put wax on a large portion of your legs or body and then strip it all off without having to worry about the temperature of the wax.</li>
      <li>I haven&#x27;t used used soft wax in a while, so I&#x27;m not quite sure how it really compares to them.</li>
      <li>When it is hot enough, it goes on easily and comes off clean with muslin strips.</li>
      <li>This wax does the job the first time, no need to reapply to areas.</li>
      <li>I thought it was user error the first time, but after three times, I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s the case.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I bought this wax hoping to get a good wax for my face and hands. I used the preepilation oil.  Even though it did a good job of removing the hair, it was very sticky and really hard to remove the residue.  I won&#x27;t do a reorder.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried several of these soft waxes for waxing my legs, and this one is my favorite.  It works best fully melted and &amp;#34;hot&amp;#34;... it them spreads nice and thin and easily removes hair.  Great product!</li>
    <li> I use this wax for my legs and really works great, I love it and I truly recommend it.&lt;br /&gt;about the seller, I have no complains! Product arrived in time and is exactly what I expected!</li>
    <li> For starters, this wax is really sticky, well, which is good, but it is so sticky that it is hard to apply on your unwanted hair. However, if you finally apply it in the correct way, it takes off hair pretty nicely. Great for all &amp;#60;3</li>
    <li> Gets the job done but MESSY...</li>
    <li> I heard that this product is really good and that&#x27;s why i bought it. When I got it I tried it but for some reason, the wax would not dry. I let it cool for a hour and no luck with that. I don&#x27;t know if I did something wrong which I doubt but I&#x27;ll try it again and see if I get the same result.</li>
    <li> This wax is great for everything from brazilian waxing to arm waxing. It works well with the Gigi Muslin roll, you can cut the strips yourself. Gentle on skin and a great buy for an all-around wax!</li>
    <li> Once it was hot and ready to go, it was awesome! Getting the lid off (as it is REALLY sticky and must have been shipped upside down) was terrible, as was trying to get the little bit off of my hands that came from just trying to get that darn lid off!</li>
    <li> Better than most wax. Doesnt leave redness after. Heats up quickly.</li>
    <li> Best wax for strip use from Gigi. I use this for everything but bikini and face. Use Brazilian hard wax or cerepils hard wax for Brazilian and face.</li>
    <li> Fairly painless. Was able to use this on my legs, bikini &amp; underarms. MUCH easier for first time self waxers than the Brazilian hard wax.</li>
    <li> Painful. Didn&#x27;t pull all the hair. (followed directions exactly)</li>
    <li> Arrived dented with wax melted all over the can. Not sure how hot the warehouse is where this came from because it is below freezing out here. The can is so dented I doubt it would even fit into the warmer not that I would even try with the wax all over it. Had to throw out.</li>
    <li> Dont buy it.......its toooooooooooooooooooooooo much stick that u can use it as glue! my wife got red sore trying to remove that stuff........</li>
    <li> This wax is awesome. I wax my own legs, and this stuff is a perfect working consistency once heated.</li>
    <li> Wax is great.  Doesnt leave redness like other waxes and pulls all the hair.  Leaves smooth skin.</li>
    <li> new to waxing, love this one way better than the teatree one. Although i do want to try the pink cream wax too. Works well &amp; stays liquid when cool.</li>
    <li> too sticky and hard to manage</li>
    <li> Worse wax ever!!!!!! Horrible experience!!!! I had wax in my legs during 1 week! And i always use wax.. So it was not my fault but the wax!!!</li>
    <li> While this wax is sticky, it is also very smooth and easy to use. I think GiGi products are the best for hair removal, especially if doing it yourself. They don&#x27;t smell bad, like some waxing products, and they are very affordable. I have not had any difficulty with the texture when the wax is properly heated. When it is hot enough, it goes on easily and comes off clean with muslin strips. I recommend buying a muslin roll and cutting whatever-sized strips are comfortable for you to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product.</li>
    <li> As an esthetician, of course, I&#x27;ve tried so many different waxes from Barrons, ceripil and Gigi. So I was at Sallys the other day and they had their buy one get on free deals so of course I gave in and bought the Dark Honey and this Azulene one. I wax my legs usually once a month and usually I use the creme lavender wax from Gigi and it&#x27;s ok for my legs but really great for my underarms. And I&#x27;ve tried waxing after 2 weeks thinking ok this had got to be long enough and I can never get all of it! The problem with leg waxing is that until you get your hair on a schedule with the hair growth cycle, it&#x27;s always a pain. But I&#x27;ve been waxing every month now for about 4 month and I think it&#x27;s getting there. So anyways I waited about 3 weeks and last month I did with the lavender creme and it was pretty long but I got most of the hair. So this time since I bought this wax and was excited about trying it, I probably only waited about 2 weeks and I&#x27;m thinking ok I&#x27;m just going to do a patch to see how it is. About a half hour later both legs were finished smooth as silk! I couldn&#x27;t believe just one rip from the strip took all the corse stubborn shorter hair than usual off completely. I am so happy I got this stuff on a whim and actually love love love it! And usually with the lavender creme it stings like alot so I always dread it but this wax is like nothing is being ripped out of your skin. It&#x27;s seriously amazeballs.  I will say that I like the Ceripil pre oil because it has jasmine and it smells amazing and really sooths the irritation and redness. But the wax isn&#x27;t all that and I&#x27;ve tried all of them. I&#x27;m sticking with Gigi all the way:)</li>
    <li> Great for sensitive skin. This wax does the job the first time, no need to reapply to areas. I have been using Azulene for over 5 years and highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> I think this is a great wax for sensitive skin. It leaves me clean and smooth. I use it for my entire face and arms. Yes, it is sticky, as he other reviews suggested, but with a little baby oil it cleans right up. No irritation, just the usual redness accompanied by ripping your hair out of the follicles. Love it!</li>
    <li> Love it!  The best I&#x27;ve used for facial waxing over the past 5 years.</li>
    <li> Use non my legs no problem</li>
    <li> Good for sensitive skin and I had little to no irritation after use. Be careful, it runs very thin. I thought lowering the temp would helbut barely. It&#x27;s okay if you&#x27;re a seasoned waxer and good at handling the applicator. If you&#x27;re a newbie, dont&#x27; use this; you will get wax EVERYWHERE!</li>
    <li> This is a great product for any area you&#x27;re looking to wax.  And for $10 it&#x27;s even cheaper that what it would cost me at the beauty supply store!!  I&#x27;m very happy with this product.</li>
    <li> works very well when properly heated</li>
    <li> It works okay. This is the first one I used on my legs and it worked well. But underarm hair is a no no.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s a soft wax, so you will need the strips for it. (I did not realized this when I bought it. I had gotten waxed a while back and absolutely loved the blue wax that was used. That wax did not require strips.) The wax is quite sticky, but it&#x27;s not as much as a pain as everyone says it is. I haven&#x27;t used used soft wax in a while, so I&#x27;m not quite sure how it really compares to them. You might want to switch to hard wax. Hard wax is so much easier to rip off and clean off . Also, this soft wax stung a lot more than the hard wax. Someone else had mentioned in a review that she was allergic to the wax. I waxed my under arms and had no issues. However, my legs had a reaction to the wax.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried so many hot waxes and the Azulene is by far the BEST.  Honee doesn&#x27;t effectively remove all the hair and sticks to the skin too much. The pink creme wax is very difficult to get to the right temperature and consistency to work effectively and is super messy.  The Brazilian hard wax is just difficult to use.  I will never try another wax again, the Azulene is simply the BEST. I use it for all my waxing needs including doing my Brazilian.</li>
    <li> Those who are new to waxing should not try this wax, as this wax is very sticky. I have a lot of home waxing experience and it&#x27;s easiest to just lay out newspapers so that all the drippings can we wrapped up easily and nothing gets on your floor/sink.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That said, this wax is AMAZING for those who are well-equipped to use it. It gets all your fine hairs! My favorite part is that it doesn&#x27;t completely harden so you can put wax on a large portion of your legs or body and then strip it all off without having to worry about the temperature of the wax. It is a miracle wax :)</li>
    <li> The wax melts pretty quickly, it smells good and really works well when applied thinly. It comes off the skin with proper use of the wax strips.</li>
    <li> It works like a charm. It is a best seller in Spain, where waxing is more common than shaving. Easy to clean with baby oil or some other oil.</li>
    <li> Well this wax was good, it took the hair off exactly as I wanted and it was effective but it was very sticky and it gets everywhere and it is ridiculously hard to get off of your sink/ anything else it gets onto. Overall my experience was more frustrating than anything else and I honestly would not buy it again</li>
    <li> This is not the hard wax but the blue wax that doesn&#x27;t ever get solid.  It is VERY sticky however it does work well to remove hair.</li>
    <li> This wax is amazing! The only downside is that it is very sticky and messy since it doesn&#x27;t dry completely at room temp like hard wax does. Oh yeah, and I used almost half the container in one sitting!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That aside, WOW. I have been using Gigi hard wax for brazilians and not really waxing any other part of my body, but I figured this stuff would be good for legs and places with light, thin hairs like my tummy, according to other reviews. Well, I warmed it up and started waxing my legs and it didn&#x27;t leave anything behind, not to mention being the least painful wax I&#x27;ve ever used. I had intended to just get the legs and thin hairs around my bikini line before warming up the hard wax to do the rest of my brazilian, but I ended up using this for the whole thing! It was MUCH, MUCH less painful than the hard wax, which is supposed to be for sensitive skin! I still like the hard wax, especially when no one is helping you, because it&#x27;s hard to use really sticky, messy wax in places you can&#x27;t exactly see. But from now on, I will keep both on hand!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have had previous experience with waxing my own body, and if you haven&#x27;t you will probably have difficulty due to the messiness. I recommend starting with a hard wax or having someone else help you. Also, it&#x27;s definitely a good idea to go to a salon first if you&#x27;re doing a brazilian and then try to do it yourself when it just starts to grow back in... Don&#x27;t disregard very negative reviews... A totally inexperienced waxer will hate this stuff.</li>
    <li> Came with a small dent but other than that it works great. I like it much more than the hard wax.</li>
    <li> seems to be just like the stuff the professionals use.  Works great for me.  I wax armpit, entire legs , and bikini .  I seem to get about 3.5 waxing sessions out of it</li>
    <li> Easy to use, it melt fast, I followed the instructions that come in english, spanish and other languajes and to be the first time that I wax myself it worked perfect. I used it for my legs.  For the armpit I recomend the hard wax.</li>
    <li> I always buy this stuff. It works great, and I have been using gigi brand wax for nearly 15 years.</li>
    <li> This product is really great. It&#x27;s easy to use, very efficient and takes away dead skin once you peel off from your skin to remove the hair. I would only suggest to get your own warmer so it heats the wax to the right temperature.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please continue distributing this product coz it&#x27;s awesome!</li>
    <li> OMG this is my first time trying an at home wax kit and the Azulene wax was PERFECT! I originally used the GiGi Creme Wax- The worst wax ever! But as soon as I switched over to Azulene it was amazing! Similar to what someone wrote- this also made the pain not as brutal. And this is the same wax the \\&quot;spa\\&quot; I used to go to for fully body waxing uses. Save money and time! HIGHLY RECOMMEND and will continue to use!</li>
    <li> The wax was delivered unbelievably fast and it is even more unbelieveably easy to spread and use. My legs were really smooth afterwards and I did not even use any of those lotions that usually come with wax kits. This was definately a good buy!</li>
    <li> Is this a hard wax or one that you have to use strips?&lt;br /&gt;  Also can anyone recommend a good hard wax please and thank you</li>
    <li> love this wax.  easy on the skin.</li>
    <li> Great wax def better then the hard wax on my sensitive skin heats up well</li>
    <li> Prior to this purchase, I used store brand waxes like Salley Hanson and Nair. I had no idea what I was missing. I use wax specifically for my bikini area. I would highly recommend this product because it does the job in half the time and the pain level dropped dramatically using GiGi Azulene wax. It is no longer a form of torture and I do not fear the thought of waxing \\&quot;down there\\&quot; any more. One additional thing I would recommend is purchasing a wax warmer as well for it keeps the wax at an even temp making the waxing process much less painful. The one I purchased was called the Space Saver also by GiGi. Again, both were a life changer.</li>
    <li> At first I read all of the other reviews on here saying this wax was too sticky and thought wow, people sure do complain a lot.  And then I used this stuff and realized that it was actually secretly developed by the military as a new kind of weapon before they found out it would violate Geneva conventions for being too cruel, then they gave it to the air force who tried to use it to put planes together but went back to screws after realizing they couldn&#x27;t take them apart again, at which point GiGi bought it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This wax will definitely pull more hair than other waxes, but it stays so sticky afterwards that even a 1/4&amp;#34; thick cover of baby powder followed by a ton of baby oil an hour later does pretty much nothing.  If your goal is to be hairless while still being able to completely stick to a wall should you decide to jump one while naked, then this is the wax for you.  Personally, I&#x27;m gonna stick with sugar wax.</li>
    <li> Works fine. It&#x27;s just a little too sticky (even at room temperature).</li>
    <li> I used this after I ran out of my creme wax. I use it for my eyebrows and face and bikini emergencies, but not anymore thanks to this wax. Its SUPER sticky during and afterwards. It manages to spill WITH the lid on and set down while not in use. Breaks EVERYONE I use it on out. And these people have never had acne in their live. Its mostly little whiteheads in the areas waxed. I purposely applied it to my leg above me ankles and waxed...next day it was red and bumpy. Bad batch or this just sucks. Can&#x27;t do anything but throw it out and order more creme wax.</li>
    <li> A little sticky and messy. But by far the best gigi wax that I have ever used so far. I found this much better than the hard wax. It has good consistency and spreads easily. Also, keeps you clean for long!</li>
    <li> it works for under arm and bikini areas. doesn&#x27;t work very well for legs.it&#x27;s good for the price and convenient factor. I can put it in the warmer and do it at home instead of going to salons.</li>
    <li> I gave this product 5 stars because it is sooo effective! With that being said, be careful with this wax, very very sticky stuff!</li>
    <li> Very good product and good price!</li>
    <li> As a licensed esthetician, I have used every brand of wax under the sun. This wax is awful. While it is just so-so for a tiny area like eyebrows, it is awful for a large area like legs or a back. It spreads way too thin, does not remove well at all, and is extremely messy and sticky. Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> I had originally bought the whole Brazilian waxing kit. The hard wax was awful, painful, and jus awful.&lt;br /&gt;But this was is amazing, easy to apply, minimal pain, no smell, and easily comes of unwanted areas with hot water n a towel</li>
    <li> No matter what happens don&#x27;t touch it. Super sticky and impossible to get off of your skin. Hint Petroleum jelly was the only thing that helped me get it off.</li>
    <li> Ok, I am new to wax warmers.  I am used to the microwaveable hard wax.  First I tried the Gigi honey wax and it came melted into the box and was an absolute mess.  I was like thick glue and stuck more to my skin than the fabric strips.  This was slightly better but still messy and not as good at removing hair as the microwave stuff I have used in the past.  I am going to order the hard wax next and see if it works more like what I am used to.</li>
    <li> Beats the heck out of having to pay at a salon every other week.</li>
    <li> I have been home waxing for over ten years, and have always used GiGi products.  Normally I use the Creme wax for my legs, but decided to give this one a try.  I ended up throwing it away after three uses.  It is VERY sticky, stickier than other waxes, and I don&#x27;t know how that&#x27;s possible.  This is the only wax I&#x27;ve ever used that pulls off the used wax from the strip and leaves it on your skin!  Grr.. very frustrating.  I thought it was user error the first time, but after three times, I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s the case.  The residue doesn&#x27;t come off easily with after wax lotion, and it doesn&#x27;t go on smoothly either.  I know every person&#x27;s skin is different, but I for one will never buy this again.</li>
    <li> My hair dresser turned me on to this, I home wax now. This is the best, I never burn or tear my skin, its hard to over heat and applies smoothy and no annoying residue</li>
    <li> This is my favorite wax I have used. Grabs even the finest of hairs and very little, if any, is left behind on skin.</li>
    <li> Great wax! Goes on smooth and no redness or bumps. I would recommend this product for anyone who likes to save money by waxing at home.</li>
    <li> It does not work well on thick/coarse hair. I used it several times in the same area and it did not even look like I did anything. It&#x27;s too sticky and too messy. I would recommend a cream wax instead.</li>
    <li> Well, I was really hoping that this would be the one wax my daughter who has extremely sensitive skin could use. This is so sticky, it arrived with some of the wax leaking out of the lid of the can :( made it difficult to place in my warmer without getting it everywhere. I did a patch test on my daughters hand, and within 5 minutes she had red dots everywhere. That was in my opinion an allergic reaction. The Benadryl really did not help. I could use it with no issues, though I will admit....I do NOT like how sticky it is. I almost went through an entire bottle of Wax Off. Trying another one today, and am hopeful :)</li>
    <li> Good enough wax, I may wish to try out some other soft waxes just to be sure, but this one did well on my arms. Spreads thinly, sticks to the strips well, and comes off cleanly when yanked fast and hard enough. If you dont yank fast, residual wax will stay, but it is easy to fix, just use another strip. I use baby oil afterward to clean off any residual wax from my skin or fingers. Lately some dripped on my tile, and I cant get it off yet.. But I will, in time, just keep scrubbing with baby oil. Heats fast, doesnt burn as easily as hard wax because it spreads thinner and cools faster.</li>
    <li> THIS IS THE PRETTIEST WAX!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This wax has the consistency of honey wax, but it&#x27;s better.  I usually go for cream wax when waxing arms or face, but decided to try this out.  I have never been a fan of honey wax, because it can be really messy, but I am a huge fan of this wax! It&#x27;s also such a pretty color!</li>
    <li> This is my favorite of all. It works for all areas, you don&#x27;t need a lot and it comes off easily.</li>
    <li> like water... bad wax!!</li>
    <li> The all purpose honey wax by GiGi is 100% more effective.  This wax just doesn&#x27;t stick well enough to pull all of the hairs out.</li>
    <li> I have very sensitive skin and waxing always makes my skin bright red and sore for hours, sometimes days. I bought this wax two days ago and received it in a very timely manner and it is without a doubt the best wax I have ever used on myself. Ever. My skin is not irritated, red, or sore at all. The waxing was a fraction as painful as what I am used to. This wax is a must have for people who have sensitive skin. Also, it removed my course, short hair like a breeze.</li>
    <li> So I tried this hoping it would be better for my sensitive skin and I have mixed reviews.  Worked well for bikini area and was gentle and practically painless, however it is a STICKY GOOEY mess. But, I will use it for that area again. Tried it on my underarms and it was horrible. Just a big mess with poor results. The brazilian hard wax is much better for underarms, but was a little harsh on my bikini area.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s too sticky that I applied a bit of it on my fingers and it took hours to remove that. And one thing i must admit, if I would have put it on some client&#x27;s legs, that would have been disastrous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Serious advice. Stay away from this product.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unfortunately I opened it after a month so I cannot return it but i ordered two different products and both are same quality.</li>
