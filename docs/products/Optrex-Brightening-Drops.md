### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Excellent product.</li>
      <li>I need to order more!!!!!</li>
      <li>Frankly for the price and size it is not that great.</li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t burn or irritate my eyes, so I was happy with that, but it didn&#x27;t get rid of redness</li>
      <li>These drops are AMAZING!</li>
      <li>Good stuff.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ll definately order more!</li>
      <li>I love these eyedrops!</li>
      <li>Item received as described, packaged appropriately, prompt delivery and fairly priced.</li>
      <li>Delivery was very quick and in good condition.</li>
      <li>Best eyedrops I have found so far.</li>
      <li>It also expires within 30 days of purchase, so it&#x27;s probably better to use an over the counter eye drop from the drug store.</li>
      <li>Love it..</li>
      <li>Nothing more.</li>
      <li>Im glad I took that gamble and ordered them.</li>
      <li>Today is the word to use Love Love Love it.  </li>
      <li>Make sure not to use with contact lenses .</li>
      <li>After many years of sleep deprivation while nursing my babies.</li>
      <li>Got here quick and love these drops!</li>
      <li>In my long days at work , I still have that bright eye look at the end of the day!!</li>
      <li>Very cool.  </li>
      <li>I only nedd to use thse once or twice a day and my eyes are bright and youthful and my vision is much more.....</li>
      <li>Wish it was available in the US.  </li>
      <li>This tear drops makes your eyes white and fresh after two drops in each eye, great product.</li>
      <li>Just did not seem to do anything special.</li>
      <li>They make your eyes look super white and bright.  </li>
      <li>Great product to brighten your eyes, slight sting when inserted into the eyes.</li>
      <li>First day I tried it and there was no difference.</li>
      <li>I prefere the blue drops, spend a littl more money and get what u want</li>
      <li>After these awesome drops no more red eyes for me.</li>
      <li>It works better than regular drug store eye drops you find in the U.S.  </li>
      <li>Instantaneous from red to bright white and the irritation was gone.  </li>
      <li>I have bright white eyes and clear, clear vision!  </li>
      <li>It clears your eyes pretty much around the clock and no stinging.</li>
      <li>really helps reduce redening</li>
      <li>Thanks</li>
      <li>I really could not tell the difference.</li>
      <li>Wonder if the 28 days after opening expiration is real though...</li>
      <li>I believe it worked very well</li>
      <li>Eyes really sparkle</li>
      <li>This product really worked for me.</li>
      <li>better than any other drops</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t give you the rebound burning most other eye drops deliver 4 or 5 hours after you use them.</li>
      <li>Prior to these I used to buy whatever popular brand was available at my local gas station and never really saw an improvement.</li>
      <li>It really makes them very clear.</li>
      <li>I mean don&#x27;t expect beautiful white clear eyes ..</li>
      <li>I was having trouble with being able to &amp;#34;clear&amp;#34; my eyes.</li>
      <li>clear!</li>
      <li>No negatives as far as burning or anything.</li>
      <li>First of all, this took forever to get to me and when I did get it, the box was crushed.</li>
      <li>A little pricey but worth it.</li>
      <li>I live in a relatively dry state, wear toric contact lenses and work in front of a computer 90% of the day.</li>
      <li>It makes my eyes less irritated, but it didn&#x27;t really eliminate the redness.</li>

    <li> really helps reduce redening</li>
    <li> I really could not tell the difference.</li>
    <li> I mean don&#x27;t expect beautiful white clear eyes .. It helps a little that&#x27;s it and that sucks because I waited a whole month for it to be delivered , and after u open it it&#x27;s only 28 days ..waste of money</li>
    <li> Makes my eyes sparkle. I have weird blue eyes that people notice all the time. It really makes them very clear. Doesn&#x27;t give you the rebound burning most other eye drops deliver 4 or 5 hours after you use them.</li>
    <li> Its working. When I put them in my eyes you feelthem waking up your tired eyes! Im glad I took that gamble and ordered them.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t work for me. It even hurts and causes my eyes turn red. I tried it two times and I&#x27;m not going to use it anymore.</li>
    <li> First of all, this took forever to get to me and when I did get it, the box was crushed. The product was intact, so no big deal I guess.  I have used almost all of it, and I did not detect any &amp;#34;brightness&amp;#34;. It doesn&#x27;t burn or irritate my eyes, so I was happy with that, but it didn&#x27;t get rid of redness and I couldn&#x27;t tell I had used anything.  I would not recommend this.  It also expires within 30 days of purchase, so it&#x27;s probably better to use an over the counter eye drop from the drug store.</li>
    <li> Not a difference to write home about.  Slight redness improvement.  Nothing more.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m a fitness model and I do a lot of photo shoots and videos, sometimes the make up gives me allergy, make my eyes red or even been outdoor under the sun can do that. This tear drops makes your eyes white and fresh after two drops in each eye, great product.</li>
    <li> I believe it worked very well .What was news to me is on the bottle it reads only use for the next 28 days .</li>
    <li> Today is the word to use Love Love Love it.  Brightens yes, immediately, but also soothes and like re-energizes.  A funny feeling, not a sting, or a pain on first contact, but a shocking feeling nonetheless that blinks right away.  I had a co-worker come in, he had been rubbing his eyes and I sat him down and dropped a drop in each eye.  Instantaneous from red to bright white and the irritation was gone.  His skin around his eyes where he had been rubbing was still red, but the whites of his eyes were not.  Very cool.  Will purchase again.  This seller did well too.  UK, but fast and not overly expensive. Wish it was available in the US.  Been using it for what, 3 months now with no side effects.  Good stuff.</li>
    <li> This drops are not great and burns,, I wolud not recommended at all. I prefere the blue drops, spend a littl more money and get what u want</li>
    <li> Love it.. I need to order more!!!!! In my long days at work , I still have that bright eye look at the end of the day!! Thanks</li>
    <li> Used to by this when I lived in England to keep my blue eyes blue. A little pricey but worth it.</li>
    <li> Great product to brighten your eyes, slight sting when inserted into the eyes. Item received as described, packaged appropriately, prompt delivery and fairly priced.</li>
    <li> Used it for about a week now with marginally noticable results but then, my eyes weren&#x27;t so bad in the first place. Just wanted to make it slightly clearer and this does the job.</li>
    <li> Excellent product. Make sure not to use with contact lenses . Eyes really sparkle</li>
    <li> It works! Took too long to come and you have to throw it away, per the box, after 18 days...</li>
    <li> This product really worked for me.After many years of sleep deprivation while nursing my babies. Delivery was very quick and in good condition.I&#x27;ll definately order more!</li>
    <li> It makes my eyes less irritated, but it didn&#x27;t really eliminate the redness.</li>
    <li> Frankly for the price and size it is not that great. It does help little bit. But it stings some what. Does it reduce redness and brighten the eyes  the answer is no. Or may be little.</li>
    <li> I love these eyedrops! They make your eyes look super white and bright.  I have been getting lots of compliments on my eyes since using this product.</li>
    <li> better than any other drops</li>
    <li> I live in a relatively dry state, wear toric contact lenses and work in front of a computer 90% of the day. Prior to these I used to buy whatever popular brand was available at my local gas station and never really saw an improvement. After these awesome drops no more red eyes for me. I put some in the morning prior to my contact lenses and then again later in the afternoon and that seems to suffice. Definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work for me at all. First day I tried it and there was no difference. The second day I used it it burned a little but there was still no change. Plus once it&#x27;s opened you can only use it for 28 days then instructions say to discard. Waste of money.</li>
    <li> Was hoping this would be the one to make the whites of my eyes look whiter and brighter. Sadly it was no better than the Clear Eyes I buy.  No negatives as far as burning or anything. I had no problems with that at all. Just did not seem to do anything special.</li>
    <li> this was NOT the bluing eye drops i had wanted, the discription is deceptive.a blue eye drop is made, this, is not that one</li>
    <li> Works immediately! Would definitely&lt;br /&gt;Recommend. Wonder if the 28 days after opening expiration is real though... That would be unfortunate.</li>
    <li> Best eyedrops I have found so far.</li>
    <li> For years I have had trouble with my eyes. Detached retina in one eye plus lots of time on the computer. I was having trouble with being able to &amp;#34;clear&amp;#34; my eyes. These drops are AMAZING! I have bright white eyes and clear, clear vision!  I cannot say &amp;#34;clear&amp;#34; enough. I only nedd to use thse once or twice a day and my eyes are bright and youthful and my vision is much more.....you-guessed-it....clear!</li>
    <li> It works better than regular drug store eye drops you find in the U.S.  It clears your eyes pretty much around the clock and no stinging.</li>
    <li> Got here quick and love these drops! Will buy again!</li>
