      <li>This brush is helping her to clean better.</li>
      <li>None are as easy to use and provide the results that these brush heads provide.</li>

      <li>Nice and Fast deliverance!</li>
      <li>make sure to buy more than one packet because the braces wear out you toothbrush heads quite fast!</li>
      <li>awesome investment, don&#x27;t know what the 2 little brushes are for though</li>
      <li>This episode tells me that I can&#x27;t rely on you people to describe items accurately.  </li>
      <li>You can use the three sprig brush to trace your gum line and between teeth accurately.</li>
      <li>These are the real deal at a nice price</li>
      <li>, it was their only set, I was happy that I got it</li>
      <li>they fit my Oral B</li>
      <li>There are 2 types of brush heads, and both are needed to clean braces well.  </li>
      <li>clean</li>
      <li>daughter said her mouth has nver felt so clean she loves it.</li>
      <li>My granddaughter has braces and finds these brush heads good for different areas of getting her teeth clean while wearing braces.</li>
      <li>They work great are sensitive enough and I strongly recommend them if you have braces.</li>
      <li>so not so useful for me</li>
      <li>Well worth the money.  </li>
      <li>These work very well with the Oral-B handset and are gentle with the braces while still leaving the teeth and braces very clean.</li>
      <li>They clean the plaque from around her braces very well.</li>
      <li>But what I remember originally was expecting a brush with more second ring concentric circles like the original that comes with the Oral B professional set.  </li>
      <li>Both of my children have used these and receive stellar reports from the orthodontist on brushing and they don&#x27;t spend alot of time brushing.  </li>
      <li>I would like to see better visual and written descriptions of products to aid my purchasing decisions.  </li>
      <li>They last a long time and do a great at cleaning my teeth and cleaning my braces thoroughly.</li>
      <li>available!&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s great to clean your brackets and in between your teeth (especially if you have temporary \\&quot;black triangles\\&quot;).&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>Love the two brushes that clean between my teeth, but have no need for the other two designed for braces.</li>
      <li>Original unit has long battery life and changes sound after two minutes of brushing.  </li>
      <li>I especially llke the brush head designed to fit in between dental work or crooked teeth:)</li>
      <li>Thanks for a consistent product.</li>
      <li>The smaller brush can get right between the teeth to get them clean.</li>
      <li>I would rather have had the option to buy the large brush alone.  </li>
      <li>The price is less than I have found in chain stores, but really good quality that comes from oral b that last longer and cleans better than generic brands.</li>
      <li>I feel price and quality are reasonable and therefore product was satisfactory.  </li>
      <li>Really works well</li>
      <li>I highly recommended to use this site!</li>
      <li>teeth look and feel much cleaner...</li>
      <li>/&gt;It should be a lot more widely</li>
      <li>The brush is gentle and yet it gets into and cleans around the braces.</li>
      <li>and I&#x27;d highly suggest this for anyone with braces!</li>
      <li>They both are what I really needed.</li>
      <li>They are not tough on the gums and get the job done.  </li>
      <li>Used many other brush heads and water pics too.  </li>
      <li>These fit fine no real complaints outside of the fact you can&#x27;t buy each head separably, some of the heads wear faster than others.</li>
      <li>I could not find these special heads that my wife uses at any of my local pharmacies.</li>
      <li>actually think it&#x27;s so good at getting in the bigger spaces between my teeth (which change constantly, ugh!)that</li>
      <li>Highly recommend for braces.</li>
      <li>, if you have braces you must use these, no more problems with hygenist saying not brushing good enough...</li>
      <li>This comes with four different heads that get in-between braces and wires, works very well!  </li>
      <li>I use both brushes daily and my teeth feel extra clean.</li>
      <li>I got these for my 11 yr old.</li>
      <li>I wear braces and I recommend this head and the professional brand electric toothbrush.</li>
      <li>seem to work well with and fis Oral-B Professional.  </li>
      <li>I use the circular brush for overall cleaning, then I use the small brush head for detailed cleaning within the brackets.  </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I love my Oral B Braun, and am I glad I can still use it on my braces with these orthodontic heads. Great price, too!</li>
    <li> Bought these for cleaning with braces.  Didn&#x27;t know these things existed and they were recommended by the Orthodontist.  Found them on Amazon and ordered a pair.  These work very well with the Oral-B handset and are gentle with the braces while still leaving the teeth and braces very clean.</li>
    <li> They last a long time and do a great at cleaning my teeth and cleaning my braces thoroughly. Definitely recommend.</li>
    <li> Easy to use, good price. I wish the braces head was thinner however this kit is a steal and i use it everyday.</li>
    <li> Using the combination of tooth brushes that this kit provides makes my teeth the cleanest they&#x27;ve ever been!  I especially llke the brush head designed to fit in between dental work or crooked teeth:)</li>
    <li> There are 2 types of brush heads, and both are needed to clean braces well.  I use the circular brush for overall cleaning, then I use the small brush head for detailed cleaning within the brackets.  Perfect combination of brushes in one set!  Highly recommend for braces.</li>
    <li> Improved my dental teeth cleaning love it!  With daily use of the power brush in addition to regular tooth brush the dentist was impressed with how well my teeth and gums look.</li>
    <li> These are perfect when wearing braces! They are not tough on the gums and get the job done.  I will purchase more.</li>
    <li> I ordered these replacement brushes for my granddaughter who wears braces.  She says it does an excellent job cleaning her teeth.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t know how this works out, but it cleans my teeth around my braces so well! awesome investment, don&#x27;t know what the 2 little brushes are for though</li>
    <li> Love these.  Just haven&#x27;t been able to order any more</li>
    <li> I was hoping they were four different brushes but, nope, only duplicates of two, neither of which we needed.  Oh well.  Like the Amazon return policy.</li>
    <li> Seems to be good items.  seem to work well with and fis Oral-B Professional.  Battery cord long enough.  Stylish, so can Recommend it</li>
    <li> This product is easy to use.  Cleans well - this equates to excellent monthly visits to the orthodontist.  Used many other brush heads and water pics too.  None are as easy to use and provide the results that these brush heads provide.</li>
    <li> I could not find these special heads that my wife uses at any of my local pharmacies. I searched Amazon and there they were, and at a price that I was happy to pay.</li>
    <li> The picture does show the smaller power tip... but when it says &amp;#34;ortho brush kit&amp;#34; and 4 count, I mistakenly assumed there were 4 ortho heads.  Amazon used to sell a single oral-b ortho head for around $6.50.  They don&#x27;t any more, so when I saw 4 pack, I assumed it was 4 ortho heads.  So not as good of a deal as I thought, but I will say the oral-b electric toothbrush with the ortho heads are excellent for anyone with braces.  Both of my children have used these and receive stellar reports from the orthodontist on brushing and they don&#x27;t spend alot of time brushing.  It&#x27;s difficult to find the ortho heads anywhere.  My orthodontist office sells them (they are $12 each) but half the time they are out of them when I ask to buy one.  So in summary, great product, just wish you got 4 of them!</li>
    <li> My granddaughter has braces and finds these brush heads good for different areas of getting her teeth clean while wearing braces.</li>
    <li> My family  member requested these replacement heads for her toothbrush. These fit fine no real complaints outside of the fact you can&#x27;t buy each head separably, some of the heads wear faster than others.</li>
    <li> Excellent cleaning of the teeth and in between teeth!!  Well worth the money.  The smaller brush can get right between the teeth to get them clean.</li>
    <li> Great product and service.</li>
    <li> Love them every time I buy and will continue to do so until the braces come off.  Thanks for a consistent product.</li>
    <li> Good price and excellent quality. These are great for people with perio as well. You can use the three sprig brush to trace your gum line and between teeth accurately. Both brushes are great for permanent retainers.</li>
    <li> These are great they fit my Oral B</li>
    <li> Works just like it&#x27;s suppose to.  I would buy this again.</li>
    <li> This comes with four different heads that get in-between braces and wires, works very well!  The price is less than I have found in chain stores, but really good quality that comes from oral b that last longer and cleans better than generic brands. I would buy again.</li>
    <li> I got these for my 11 yr old. She just got braces and is struggling to brush around the brackets. This brush is helping her to clean better.</li>
    <li> My girlfriend loves them. They clean the plaque from around her braces very well. This is way better than her sonicare brush that did an inadequate job around the braces and hurt her teeth as well. We are very pleased with the product!</li>
    <li> I bought this for my daughter because she has braces and was having problems getting her teeth clean .my daughter said her mouth has nver felt so clean she loves it.</li>
    <li> I just got braces about a month ago and decided to buy this item a week after I got braces. I use both brushes daily and my teeth feel extra clean. I would recommend this for anyone who has braces.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also I got the Waterpik Ultra Water Flosser which gets anything you may have missed.</li>
    <li> We bought this set at the recommendation of our daughters orthodontist. Great price and it&#x27;s perfect for cleaning between her braces.</li>
    <li> I got my braces a few months ago and remembered that I did get that tiny brush head with my toothbrush long time ago but didn&#x27;t see them in any store/pharmacy.&lt;br /&gt;Recently I bumped into (coz I was not looking for it) in a tiny pharmacy and grabbed it, it was their only set, I was happy that I got it but after I used it on my braces I was thrilled. That kit s awesome!&lt;br /&gt;It should be a lot more widely available!&lt;br /&gt;it&#x27;s great to clean your brackets and in between your teeth (especially if you have temporary \\&quot;black triangles\\&quot;).&lt;br /&gt;I actually think it&#x27;s so good at getting in the bigger spaces between my teeth (which change constantly, ugh!)that I can get away with not flossing on the evenings I&#x27;m more tired than usual &#x3D;D&lt;br /&gt;After all teeth brushing for an ortho patient takes an average of 20-30min (brushing, flossing, proxy brushing, fluoride rinse swishing for a minute)</li>
    <li> Nice and Fast deliverance! I love to order again from here! More than happy! I highly recommended to use this site!</li>
    <li> After getting scolded for poor maintenance during my son&#x27;s last dental exam, the tech recommended this toothbrush.  We have not been disappointed.  My son&#x27;s teeth are cleaner, his gums look healthy and his checkup a week ago was the best one we have ever had.  Recommend this to all parents of kids who have poor bushing habits.</li>
    <li> Really works well, if you have braces you must use these, no more problems with hygenist saying not brushing good enough... teeth look and feel much cleaner...</li>
    <li> when i purchase these, i didn&#x27;t realize they are for brace wearers.. so not so useful for me... been out of braces for a few years...</li>
    <li> I have looked for a little tooth brush to go around my inplants and this works really good.  They both are what I really needed.</li>
    <li> The brush is gentle and yet it gets into and cleans around the braces. When this brush wears out we will buy again.</li>
    <li> Love the two brushes that clean between my teeth, but have no need for the other two designed for braces.</li>
    <li> I had previously purchased replacement brushes for my Oral B from Amazon that were made in Germany but were crap. These are the real deal at a nice price</li>
    <li> The electric toothbrush used with this head holds a charge for some time and is quite effective at cleaning plaque off of my teeth. I wear braces and I recommend this head and the professional brand electric toothbrush.</li>
    <li> Being proactive when a kid is wearing braces can be daunting on a parent.  Do yourself a favor....get an electric tooth brush, a water pick and these heads for the electric toothbrush.</li>
    <li> I bought these ortho heads as I just got braces. They work great are sensitive enough and I strongly recommend them if you have braces.</li>
    <li> The picture sent now for the review seems a bit clearer what to have expected.  But what I remember originally was expecting a brush with more second ring concentric circles like the original that comes with the Oral B professional set.  The picture was too small to tell.  Moving on: The products both function, maybe they are specialty ones like the one with just two bristle brush sets (two came in mail), maybe for getting in-between teeth more.  I do feel they are getting clean, but not being a specialist, I can hope for the best :-)  I feel price and quality are reasonable and therefore product was satisfactory.  I would like to see better visual and written descriptions of products to aid my purchasing decisions.  Have a good day, and a better tomorrow.</li>
    <li> Ordered brush head for braces. Original unit has long battery life and changes sound after two minutes of brushing.  D</li>
    <li> These are great and I&#x27;d highly suggest this for anyone with braces! make sure to buy more than one packet because the braces wear out you toothbrush heads quite fast!</li>
    <li> My only problem is, like other reviewers have stated, the small brush has almost no utility at all.  I would rather have had the option to buy the large brush alone.  It is a waste.</li>
    <li> Nowhere (that I could see) did this product&#x27;s description state that 2 of the 4 brushes were for braces and worthless for me.  A BIG reason for buying from Amazon is the savings that I can realize.  This episode tells me that I can&#x27;t rely on you people to describe items accurately.  I will have to rethink this!</li>
