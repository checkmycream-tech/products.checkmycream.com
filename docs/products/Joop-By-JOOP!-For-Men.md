<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> This was a gift and the person loved it.  Wears it often and said the smell was amazing.</li>
    <li> Excellent all areas of service as well as product</li>
    <li> Have purchased this product several times.  Nice Fragrance with out being over powering.  Have also purchased their other Joop  offers.  Seem to go back to this particular one as the favorite.</li>
    <li> What&#x27;s not to love? Great fragrance, great product! Came very well packaged and arrived safely. Joop is a pleasing scent and has been a favorite of my hubby&#x27;s for years.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve purchased this colongne previously, however these dudes got me up and running very quick! Now I can continue my mission of bringing sexy back!</li>
    <li> Sweet and casual aroma</li>
    <li> Great product... super price!</li>
    <li> My fiance loves it! He especially likes this size because he usually gets a smaller size for himself.</li>
    <li> Thank You for this product, is excellent.</li>
    <li> This is a great gift idea. Smells great. Thank you!</li>
    <li> Smells extremely good and last all day and even weeks if worn on a jacket or coat.</li>
    <li> LOVE IT,beats the hell out of buying it in the stores,with AMAZON ,you get twice the size at half the cost</li>
    <li> I love this scent, but only certain people can pull it off. I just happen to be one of them, according to what people say. Most women that comment on it really like the scent and some of them had even said its their favorite fragrance on the RIGHT guy. Its a very strong scent so you dont need a lot of it either so it lasts longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This one is always on my bathroom counter.</li>
    <li> Good stuff and it was under 30$</li>
    <li> Received on time and happy with the quality of the product</li>
    <li> Omg you can&#x27;t beat this price</li>
    <li> Was very happy with this product.</li>
    <li> Another  old favorite that&#x27;s never lost its mystique. To me.</li>
    <li> Just like the good old day!! Love it!!</li>
    <li> Like all the greats from the 90s, this stuff is top notch. Cool Water, Joop, Carolina Herrera.... must haves.</li>
    <li> I used to wear this perfume when i was a teenager. That was one of my favorite and i can&#x27;t wait to start putting it again.</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t say that it lasts all day but as for the scent, I have received numerous compliments.</li>
    <li> Fast shipping, high quality product.</li>
    <li> Great product and the fragrance lasts a long time.  Delivered quickly and will be ordering more in the future.</li>
    <li> My husband and son wears this and they love it. I sprayed some on me one day when I was away from home and had forgotten my perfume at home. I could not believe how many people told me I smelled good, and asked what I was wearing. Funny, it&#x27;s Men&#x27;s cologne. But Men and Women can wear it well.</li>
    <li> Best Price. I love the way my husband smells wearing this.</li>
    <li> Not loud not spicy smooth and It last, ladies like it, Careful not to spray too close specially when wearing white shirt,</li>
    <li> this s*** stinks like my garbage can don&#x27;t buy this ***t it is so strong it makes me cough my dog passes out when he smelled me. JUNK</li>
    <li> Got this after reading a couple of readings on some other websites. I would say paying 27$ for this isnt worth at all. It is an average scent at best, kinda fruity. It lasts for about 3 hours. I would suggest you buy something better than this for the same price.</li>
    <li> Ive always loved joop and in all the years ive been wearing cologne its been my go to. Ive tried dozens of various other brands. and none of them last as long nor have the same effect on people as joop does. Throughout the days people always comment on how good i smell and how much they love it. Joop is unique in that its easily the most identifiable once you know what it smells like.</li>
    <li> Great price for my all time favorite fragrance. Always get lots of compliments &amp;#34;what&#x27;s that cologne????&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Very satisfied with product itself, great deal as well.... the packing was unsatisfactory though. The box was flimsy, not held together well, and was open on one end. I&#x27;m surprised the cologne didn&#x27;t fall right out! Overall satisfied though.</li>
    <li> item as described, fast ship, thanks</li>
    <li> This is hands-down the best mail cologne that&#x27;s ever been made and the seller is wonderful the product ships quickly and comes as promised!</li>
    <li> love the scent of this,,,,,</li>
    <li> Fabulous as always, my Better half smells divine!  Shipping was super fast as well.  Highly recommend.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s what I ordered and it&#x27;s what i got. Priced right and even more affordable than local purchase. very satisfied.</li>
    <li> You can wear this all day and Night literally, This scent wears down. But NOT out..  Very clean and refreshing..</li>
    <li> Delivery was so fast and very satisfied with price and bottle size. Thank you</li>
    <li> Was just as described and great price!</li>
    <li> Excellent long lasting scent.  Well worth the cost.  Have been asked by others as to what I&#x27;m wearing.</li>
    <li> Joop! is a French-made cologne, so it is a quality cologne.  It is a very musky, sweet smell that could definitely get old after a while, but is good for just using it every now and then.  And that is, in fact, my largest complaint: that this is not a good cologne for all occasions; I don&#x27;t use it regularly.  It&#x27;s excellent for a business, professional-type setting.  However, for just regular social life, it&#x27;s a little too bold.  I find it to be very distinguished and suave, but it&#x27;s just not the right cologne to use for everyday situations.  I recommend it highly to businessmen, but to other men, I&#x27;m not sure that I could recommend it.</li>
    <li> I love this scent on my husband. He enjoyed the surprise. Definitely more affordable than the places I&#x27;ve seen the cologne, plus I ger more, and came just in time for Christmas. (Actually a day earlier than promised!)</li>
    <li> It smells perfectly for me!</li>
    <li> Great Product... I been using this Pour Homme for many, many years...</li>
    <li> This cologne has stuck in my memory for years.. It has undertones of rich chocolate that are seriously addictive. It also slightly changes depending on the PH of the person wearing it, (like most colognes, perfumes, oils, etc.)</li>
    <li> Recive on time satisfied with the product</li>
    <li> thanks it was a good buy more than i expected</li>
    <li> This is the first cologne i have worn, that i could actually smell on myself all day long. Most colognes are not noticeable to the one wearing it.</li>
    <li> I love the scent. It is a cologne i have used for many years precisely 25 years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Joop is one of three cologne i love</li>
    <li> Great product, my favorite scent.  Only problem is that it is a BIG bottle and I am tending to use too much!!</li>
    <li> Honestly, my husband smells delicious with this stuff on.  It lacks that sharp alcohol note that many colognes give off through the day.  He gets compliments frequently.</li>
    <li> This product is for sale at such a discount on Amazon compared to the stores its amazing. I buy this for my uncle every year for holiday and he loved it as usual except this year I was able to get him a bigger size!</li>
    <li> Good deal on Amazon as compared to other places. Been waiting to pick this one up. Its one of my fav and the price was good on amazon. Get it! :)</li>
    <li> My dad has some of this and although it is very easy to find I never got around to purchasing any. Sometimes I would use his although I have other colognes that I use. I finally decided to buy this since the price was so good and the smell is absolutely exceptional. I love this stuff. It lingers for a while too and it lasts pretty good throughout the day.</li>
    <li> I have been using Joop for the past 15+ years. i get so many compliments each day whether I walk into a store, bar or someone home. But be aware... I also hear that woman have bought product for their man but it did smell as nice. Body chemistry does play into the sent and appeal.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s been many years since I&#x27;ve bought Joop! Homme oh I&#x27;d say very early 90&#x27;s.Correction:I believe I was gifted my first bottle.Very satisfied with what I received and to my nose I don&#x27;t sense this cologne has been reformulated.At least not my nose which isn&#x27;t that sensitive but what I remember and liked about Joop&#x27;s smell didn&#x27;t decline from past expectations.Stellar output in one spray alone but I never push it past 2 sprays...very potent and hold it&#x27;s scent for a very long time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So why only 4-stars?&lt;br /&gt;Well I&#x27;ve heard all sorts of descriptions for the sweetness of Joop! Homme.Dimetapp grape cough syrup,bazooka regular gum,pink cotton candy,cherry candy...here&#x27;s my input.The sweetness to me is very old fashioned and reminiscent of Chowards Violet Scented Gum (very old school and still manufactured).Take that smell and add a powdery undertone and you&#x27;ve pretty much got a close perspective of Joop&#x27;s sweetness.The rest of the scent is floral with a little warm spice to it.One aspect to this cologne I do like is it has a very musky heart that pushes it&#x27;s way through the unusual sweetness.It smells very good to your nose and though how pleasing it smells...it just doesn&#x27;t strike me enough to call it manly.It just doesn&#x27;t blend in well the persona of the physical labor working class male.Easier explained spray this on and chop wood,fish,or mow your lawn you feel out of place with your masculine nature.You feel like you should hire a landscaper named Garcia to mow your lawn and chop your wood so you don&#x27;t get dirty.Or hire a fisherman to catch a big trout for you and have it mounted on your wall.Cutting to the chase the metrosexual male&#x27;s lifestyle makes this cologne good for them 24/7. Where Joop! does come into play well is in positions of social interaction.You go to a bar or a restaurant with friends/family.Out on a date or a night out with your wife.You work a job where you have face to face/in person interaction with other people.It&#x27;s not because Joop! is in a pink fluid and bears a purple cap for reason of judgement..In fact it makes you curious about something that looks out of place until you smell it.But the common male will sniff this and end up rubbing their chin and thinking &#x27;okay now how am I going to make this work...this is a little out of my territory&#x27;.luid and bears a purple cap for reason of judgement..In fact it makes you curious about something that looks out of place until you smell it.But the common male will sniff this and end up rubbing their chin and thinking &#x27;okay now how am I going to make this work...this is a little out of my territory&#x27;.</li>
    <li> something has happened to JOOP. i used to love the smell and longevity but i don&#x27;t know if the product quality has gone down significantly or did i receive a knockout version. smell fades off in less than an hour now.</li>
    <li> item was missing spray nozzle  received bottle that was leaking</li>
    <li> I Love the smell. I had one before, finished it, got another one. Awesome durability.</li>
    <li> I buy this often , And the price is great, I&#x27;ll be buying it here again !</li>
    <li> Everything was spot on with vendor. Fragrance mailed in timely manner and nothing was broken. Good Stuff!</li>
    <li> Our nephew loves the smell of this and uses it daily.  He actually uses it to much but what can I say.  He is 58 and I guess he could use things that smell worse.</li>
    <li> Love this cologne. My girl crawls all over me every time I wear it. Needless to say, I wear this cologne often.&lt;br /&gt;I highly recommend this product</li>
    <li> This cologne is very different from most modern colognes.  I think it lacks a sophisticated, manly scent.  It smell more like candy.  Very sweet, bordering on too sweet.</li>
    <li> My husband has used this fragrance for over 20 years. It consists of a blend of a blend of cinnamon, jasmine, honey, tobacco, and vetiver (a type of grass) which loosely translates into Yummy! This is a very seductive spray, and this size on Amazon is an unbeatable price.</li>
    <li> I hate the day I made this purchase. This is not Joop it is something else smells like the urine of my cat.  thought since it was coming from amazon warehouse it will be great.</li>
    <li> My dad has been wearing this for as long as I can remember. I ordered it for him this Christmas and after shopping around found this to be the best price. Delivery was quick and the smell is just as nice as I remember. Smells very fresh.</li>
    <li> Go it fast but if I knew it&#x27;ll be fake I would have never gottiing it, would have gotting the real joop. This crap sucks don&#x27;t even smell like joop and ain&#x27;t strong at all. Original joop use one spray this junk I&#x27;ll have to empty it and still smells weak like a dollar store colonel</li>
    <li> Joop is for young men. It has a fruity scent without being overpowering. It is best worn for leisure or nighttime activities. This is not a good scent for work or formal affairs, but certainly wear it when you are letting loose and having fun!</li>
    <li> Always a great colonge. It never lets you down!</li>
    <li> Great price, Great Product!</li>
    <li> Sooooo good! This cologne lasts over 8 hrs long!  It has a floral, powdery and spicey lemony,  woodsy scent all rolled up into one. Truly unique and truly a winner.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using Joop for years, but it seems that the fragrance of Joop that I purchase now is not as fragrant and the fragrance doesn&#x27;t last as long as others I use.</li>
    <li> Great smell, it lasted a long time</li>
    <li> The two bottles of Joop I received were unfortunately unusable inasmuch as they did not have spray heads attached.  When I notified the seller, I was asked to submit photos for their evaluation.  I did this, and they asked me to send the product back to them.  I asked them to just ship me a couple sprayheads, but they could not or would not do that.  Because I&#x27;m visiting out of the country (where I had intended these as gifts) I must wait until I return to ship the product back.    Not a good thing.  Strange that they could have shipped them like that.  Strange that the manufacturer would have let them out of the plant like that.  Actually, there was not room for spray heads in the box they sent.  I wonder.</li>
    <li> I call this stuff &amp;#34;Sex-in-a-bottle&amp;#34;!!  I love it on my man!!!</li>
    <li> If you want to keep your cats away from your fake Christmas tree this is what to buy. We have  three cats who love to climb and this did the trick. Plus your home smells great.Ha! Tried all the cat products waste of money.</li>
    <li> Fast delivery.  And, the boyfriend loves this scent, as I do. A definite favorite for men.</li>
    <li> Have always liked this product.</li>
    <li> I love this perfume. The longevity and sillage is very well.</li>
    <li> Was skeptical buying cologne without smelling it first, but after reading reviews decided to purchase this and give it a shot. I have never been happier with a scent. It is very strong and yet subtle at the same time. Smells very manly despite the pink color to the bottle.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve worn Joop since 1996.  It&#x27;s unique with a rich blend of Asian floral fragrances.  It could pas for a female perfume.</li>
    <li> Never bought this before but it is excellent. The younger women like it the most.</li>
    <li> as advertised. good price.</li>
    <li> I bought this cologne because my girl love it. Nice cologne to have in your collection. I wear it two or three times a week.</li>
    <li> THis was a Christmas present for my 14 yo son. He loves the scent and so do I, it has a sweet scent with a little going a long way. I just found out that my husband wears it too.</li>
    <li> My husband has been using this for years. This was a very Good price.</li>
    <li> Love this scent. What a value for 4.2 oz</li>
    <li> I bought this fragrance for my boyfriend because he always uses this cologne and loves it.</li>
    <li> ITS JUST RIGHT IT HITS ALL THE SPOTS... MY BOO LOVES IT ON ME I&#x27;M SO GLAD SHE GOT IT FOR ME...</li>
    <li> I like the smell very much.</li>
    <li> good item...shipping very fast...happy with the product</li>
    <li> My Favorite years ago... stills impact every person that feels the aroma</li>
    <li> very nice fragrance package beautifully and was a very good value even cheaper than Walmart would shop with this company again very nice experience thank you</li>
    <li> I am very pleased with this product by which a great buy! I was reluctant to buy online because of its size. The quantity almost double for what one would pay in stores. Amazing! Great value! Thank you!</li>
    <li> Strong , and kind of sweet ; which generally describes me very well.</li>
    <li> I bought this out of recommendation, and reviews on amazon and never had smelled it and damn... VERY impressed. Very good smelling cologne, and it lasts forever! One spray can be smelt nearly 2 days later... That&#x27;s insane! Everyone who&#x27;s smelt it on me has been impressed as well. Highly recommend it. Very cheap as well!</li>
    <li> Love the stuff and seems to be a good price, thanks Amazon</li>
    <li> This scent isn&#x27;t really for me.  It smells alright, but not exactly a very masculine scent.  Would recommend to a woman, but not a man.</li>
    <li> its the cheapest price ever.  the joop is perfect fragrance. good deal. everything is same as their promise and i strongly recommended.</li>
    <li> Really smells good and can be worm by men and women. It&#x27;s a very sexy, classy scent! Get it for your men ladies....</li>
    <li> I was very pleased with Joop. My boyfriend smells so good and the fragrance lasts long.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve always had a bottle since high school.  It&#x27;s a metrosexual euro trash kind of smell that gets attention.  Its a strong cologne for clubbing that out last the hangover the next morning.</li>
    <li> Smells like clean laundry, and the scent lasts all day!  My husband loves it.  It&#x27;s his new Go To cologne.</li>
    <li> this cologne is very good in my opinion.  i recommend it though a man may never know if he enjoys the scent unless he makes the purchase.  so my recommendation may not be good for some but good for others</li>
    <li> My Husband and my two sons love Joop!</li>
    <li> My husband love it at a great price.</li>
    <li> A product that I use often. I get a lot of &amp;#34;what is your cologne?&amp;#34; Good price and fast shipping.</li>
    <li> Resurrecting it from Middle School and getting lots of compliments</li>
    <li> Exelente producto bueno</li>
    <li> The last order was strangely weak in fragrance.  I will not order this product online anymore.</li>
    <li> Joop belongs in another time...back when men&#x27;s fragrances weren&#x27;t all too bland or the same to be noticed.  Joop also dared to market this masterpiece in a very non-typically male color.  From the outside, you can just tell you aren&#x27;t going to get your typical &amp;#34;male&amp;#34; fragrance: you know all those in the blue bottles that smell sort of the same.  The blend reminds me very much of smelling quality pipe tobacco, the raging hot spices almost being cooled by the warm vanilla.  And yes, there&#x27;s citrus here but it&#x27;s not overdone like in so many male fragrances...it&#x27;s more of a subtle counterpoint to the sweet vanilla.  I also think of leather when I smell this.  If I had to paint a picture of this fragrance it would be of a man casually dressed in jeans and a t-shirt who is sitting on a leather sofa with a pipe dangling from his mouth.  On the table next to him would be a small vase of flowers and on the coffee table in front of him a bowl of citrus fruits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, it&#x27;s too girly for men hung up on that sort of thing but I dare say this is one of the most wonderfully bold masculine scents ever. It&#x27;s for the consumer who is confident enough in his masculinity to accent it with a very bold and almost controversial (well nowadays) choice.  It&#x27;s long lasting and develops well even hours after applying.  When you spray it, it almost feels thick---I suspect the high concentration of fragrance oils as compared to other products which are watered down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Give it a try.  It&#x27;s priced so much better than many products that are bland and inferior.  You can hide it behind that blue bottle of bland stuff if you think the color is too girly.</li>
    <li> at first i thought this was just like others sprays that it wont last long. but i was proven wrong ever since i bought this i became obsess with the Scent. it last very long and the Scent  is the best</li>
    <li> I gifted it to my husband. We just loved the smell. Its lasts long too.</li>
    <li> I have been using this THIS Joop Cologne for over 15 years. A cologne can only be properly judged by putting it on your skin, waiting for it to interact with your body chemistry and THEN seeing what it smells like. I have always had compliments from women in their twenties, thirties, forties, you get the picture. I have tried many other colognes, and none come even close to this one. Most women use perfumes which agree with them, but the same definitely does not hold true with men. You want something that suggests &amp;#34;classy, intelligent and interesting&amp;#34;? Then this is the ticket.</li>
    <li> Good job and very fast delivery</li>
    <li> this is old school but it is great! last all day.. receive compliment from ladies all day. buy it and you will be happy</li>
    <li> Great scent that lasts, delivered on time!!!</li>
    <li> Very low price yet a quality cologne. Not too strong but masculine. Every day or wear to work kind of cologne.</li>
    <li> This is a great scent I have purchased for my husband many times. Product is reasonably priced. Fast and secure shipment. Thank you!</li>
    <li> Great stuff at a great price.</li>
    <li> Love this old school fragrance, needed to have it in my collection. For the price, you can&#x27;t beat it. Will recommend others for purchase soon.</li>
    <li> I have been wearing Joop!  exclusively, since I first tried it in Sydney in 2001  (it&#x27;s the same product here in the US).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The smell is very appealing, and not overpowering or  &amp;#34;cloying&amp;#34;.  I&#x27;ve noticed that lower-quality  (though maybe not less expensive) colognes tend to assault the senses, especially when the wearer applies too much  (I call this the &amp;#34;Frat Boy Effect&amp;#34;).&lt;br /&gt;I apply Joop! sparingly--one spray on my upper chest/neck, one spray on the top part of my back  (between the shoulder blades). It lasts at least 6 to 8 hours, unless I&#x27;m sweating a lot  (if I&#x27;m about to exercise, do yard work, detail my car, or any other activity where I&#x27;m likely to sweat, I won&#x27;t apply cologne anyway).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is my first order of Joop!  from Amazon;  I liked the price, and the 4.2 ounce bottle is comparatively HUGE; in the past, &#x27;ve bought Joop! in 2.1 ounce bottles at a department store.  This on will last a year, maybe more.</li>
    <li> Love the fragrance.  Great price.  Better than in stores.</li>
    <li> Wonderful perfume. Smells great and the product is just as described. Great purchase for christmast gift to your man or relative.</li>
    <li> Sweet smelling. Very lite</li>
    <li> Great perfume. It is a must try/have perfume for men.&lt;br /&gt;Long lasting&lt;br /&gt;gh&lt;br /&gt;gh&lt;br /&gt;jh&lt;br /&gt;hk&lt;br /&gt;g&lt;br /&gt;ghk&lt;br /&gt;hk&lt;br /&gt;j</li>
    <li> Not sure if it&#x27;s still around so bought this as a gift for my dad that only likes this cologne and now he is very happy to have it for a while longer. Smells great.</li>
    <li> all excellent, recommended 100%</li>
    <li> Something is wrong with the cologne it&#x27;s not the same fragrance i know ,3 second after u put it on ,water smell better no even deserve 1 star.</li>
    <li> Quick delivery, my husband loves it</li>
    <li> Quality and presentation expected.</li>
    <li> Brand new in box, just as described.... $20 cheaper than if I bought at store!</li>
    <li> Joop is one of the best smelling colognes ever made.  Never sure about ordering from the internet, because you don&#x27;t know who&#x27;s selling knockoffs.  Not the case here.  When my sweetie comes home after a long day at work, the Joop still has him smelling very nice.</li>
    <li> My boyfriend liked it.</li>
    <li> It smells like cinnamon, woody and old teak oil. I just got this to try and I&#x27;m not disappointed. I like citrus and aqua flavours more. It is good for night wear. It has high sillage and projection. One squirt will last for 6- 7 hours on an average. I didn&#x27;t believe when I read it online, but it really have that nature. It&#x27;ll last long and long and long. I wish other perfume makers extract sillage/projection formula from Joop and put in theirs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Flavour - 3/5&lt;br /&gt;silalge - 4.5/5&lt;br /&gt;projection - 4.5/5</li>
    <li> this is not a knock-off so dont worry. it smells great.  i received it on the last day of shipping. but it is what i expected.  &amp;#34;it is what it is&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> I was always a lover of Joop the scent last all day long,</li>
    <li> Very good fragrance.  Used it for years.  Good, prompt shopping experience.  Keep up the good work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bigbird73401</li>
    <li> This should be a staple of every man&#x27;s collection!</li>
    <li> I have worn Joop! for years, and I&#x27;m a woman. I like the heavy scent because just a little lasts all day. It never fails that men compliment me when I wear this, they love the smell too!</li>
    <li> A birthday gift loved by my son</li>
    <li> Awesome!!, this colonge has a great body unique aroma, great for every ocasion. I first used it on my early 20s, &amp; haven&#x27;t stopped since.</li>
    <li> To my dismay, I have been using Joop for over 10 years. I have bought several from Amazon. It used to last all day and even my shirts would smell like Joop. The lady at my dry cleaners mentioned how &amp;#34;good&amp;#34; my shirts always  smelled! However, in the last couple of years, the smell will last less than an hour. To be sure that I simply did not have a &amp;#34;smell overload&amp;#34; in my nose, I asked my wife if she could smell my Joop after an hour or so; and she could not!! Don&#x27;t know what happened to Joop, but it is really sad. I found it at Sam&#x27;s Club after Christmas last year on close out for $9.00 a bottle. Bought all they had left. Now I have 7 bottles of Joop that does not smell like anything at all!! It appears that this is the DEATH of a once great cologne for men!!</li>
    <li> muy buena fragancia es fresca dura bastante al hechartela el precio es accesible llego a venezuela en perfecto estado la recomiendo 100 % y recomiendo al vendedor</li>
    <li> Smells really good, fast shipping what&#x27;s not to luv!</li>
    <li> We just got a great deal with this perfume. It&#x27;s very good,</li>
    <li> Fast delievery. Excellent product.</li>
    <li> This is my favorite scent on me.  I&#x27;ve found it harder to find over the years and more expensive when I do -- thankfully, I have amazon to find it for me inexpensively and on my doorstep.</li>
    <li> I always put some cologne or aftershave on after I finish shaving.  It usually stings, but with this item it doesn&#x27;t, seems not to have any alcohol in it.  I know that there are a lot of phony&#x27;s out there selling fake stuff.  I just didn&#x27;t feel like going through the changes of sending it back.  At least it does smell nice.  But I had one I bought in a store and the results were much different, that&#x27;s why I mention this.  Sometimes all that glitters is not gold!</li>
    <li> I have been using Joop for the last 10 years or so and I love this perfume. However, the last bottle I ordered from Amazon seems odd. The perfume smells the same however it does not last as long. My experience with Joop has been that if you spray it in the morning, it&#x27;s still going strong by the end of the day. But not the one I received from Amazon. Not sure if this is defective stock. I have tremendous faith in Amazon and am surprised that this product turned out the way it did.</li>
    <li> My husband wears this and I have to say its hard to not have my hands all over him. It smells amazing and lasts all day. Everyone around us always compliments the way he smells and we have gotten some of our friends to use it as well. Great smell. I haven&#x27;t put it on me yet so I may have to try that!</li>
    <li> A gift for hubby, so it is all good! Good price!</li>
    <li> Nice aroma . stays for longer time</li>
    <li> Bought this JOOP on Amazon &amp; LOVE IT !!!!!  Price was reasonable , and the sent is excellent.  Not watered out.  I could spray some on myself in the morning and it lasts all day.  &amp;#34; I had people ask me what cologne I was wearing ?&amp;#34;  I told them JOOP.  They said they love the fragrance and will buy some for them self :)  So I give it a 5 star.</li>
    <li> The scent doesn&#x27;t last too long.  Maybe a couple hours, but it is very pleasant.</li>
    <li> My son&#x27;s all time favorite. Best price any where.</li>
    <li> Best cologne ever, this fragance will linger more than any other and  everytime I use it someone ask about it.</li>
    <li> Delivered on time! This cologne smells amazing</li>
    <li> I get more comments on the smell from complete strangers. Stays with you all day and night but is not over whelming...</li>
    <li> I have received Joop!  Very satisfied with this product and thank you for shipping product in a timely manner.</li>
    <li> Cheapest I have found ,and smells great .</li>
    <li> I personally don&#x27;t like the smell at all. It smells very feminine and wouldn&#x27;t recommend.</li>
    <li> a very nice smell for me i love it and super long lasting, some like it some don&#x27;t. the smell is very unique.</li>
    <li> HUGE bottle. Fiance loved it, perfect gift</li>
    <li> What can I say, great price and great sent. This is one of the all time best smelling fragrances next to cool water and CK1.</li>
    <li> the best, longest lasting cologne still made</li>
    <li> This is an old favorite cologne of mine since the early &#x27;90s. It smells as good as ever. The item arrived as described and in a timely fashion.</li>
    <li> item was exactly as described..... i love it...authentic item..what more can i say i am happy with my purchase and will come back</li>
    <li> This one is my favorite for how I like my husband to wear. It is so sexy.</li>
    <li> I can never get tired of that smell</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve had this cologne before but this one doesn&#x27;t seem to last. It smells light not like the one I had purchased before. I&#x27;m not satisfied at all</li>
    <li> Everything as expected!</li>
    <li> I bought this for a friend and he loved it. :)</li>
    <li> This is not the same Joop from back when it first came out,the scent is different and its longevity isn&#x27;t near what it was then.</li>
    <li> Either the perfume was old or it was diluted, I have been using this kind of cologne for 7 years and this is the first time the odor of it it is not right and will dissapear from my body, clothes ( no smell) within an hour</li>
    <li> Sure smells like Joop, but must be mostly alcohol! It doesn&#x27;t stay with you at all, last store bought was all day! This is a Waste of Money!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve worn Joop since it came out. Great price, fast shipping!!</li>
    <li> I work at a school and I get compliments all the time on how nice, hot or sexy the smell is. The students always say I smell so good and the staff say it is a nice fresh and not sweet perfume type of cologne. Many friends have bought the same product for family members.</li>
    <li> One of the best colognes ever made. Lasts forever, but I have a supplier on eBay that I can get a bigger bottle for a way better price, and get it in 2 days for free.</li>
    <li> Excellent choice. If you try it once you&#x27;ll love it, and you&#x27;ll never change it. And the price is more than reasonable.</li>
    <li> It was not the original. Very disappointed.</li>
    <li> No problems at all. Arrived at EDD. No complaints! Brought boyfriend this as a gift. Haven&#x27;t heard no concerns from him. He actually thought it was a good deal.</li>
    <li> This is one of the best cologne&#x27;s I have in my stash, I love the sent an it last all day, not that&#x27;s how a cologne sapose to be, if u haven&#x27;t tryed it u need to get it!</li>
    <li> I can&#x27;t say how much I love the smell of this cologne.</li>
    <li> Excellent product, highly recommended</li>
    <li> Wish we could have returned this but amazon rules said I could not mail it back.&lt;br /&gt;It was absolutely terrible, awful smell, cheesy bottle.</li>
    <li> I like this fragance.</li>
    <li> I just love Amazon this website is so awesome, my husband love this Joop for men. The order is always on time and the quality of the item is good. Amazon is the first item on my list for Christmas.</li>
    <li> Awesome, Thank you for having Joop</li>
    <li> The bottle is huge great value</li>
    <li> Old school smells great.  Love it.</li>
    <li> Great smell, would recommend.</li>
    <li> I generally more musk type perfumes, unlike sea shore/aqua ones. this has that pleasant smell and lasts long enough, say 6-8 hours very easily.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;i would recommend for casual evenings rather than for work.</li>
    <li> Really good smell!  Just applied little bit it will last all day!</li>
    <li> We usually buy this in the store. It doesn&#x27;t smell the same as when you buy it in the store. Even my husband noticed a difference. The bottle it came in  is also different. I guess from now on we will buy it in the store. Wonder if this what I bought are rejects?</li>
    <li> fast service at good price.</li>
    <li> Best smelling cologne in my opinion.</li>
    <li> Perfect father&#x27;s day gift! It&#x27;s actually the real scent too, not a knock-off. It was perfect!</li>
    <li> Love the scent of sweet honey and spices great buy.</li>
    <li> Terrific scent. Not weak and not too strong. My husband will not wear any other scent. The major department stores don&#x27;t sell it anymore.</li>
    <li> Purchased this for a gentleman who has used it for years.  He loves it.</li>
    <li> I have used this product for many years and have always liked the aroma and always gotten compliments.  Cheaper to buy here than in a store.</li>
    <li> Very nice fragrance. I can&#x27;t get enough. It smells so delicious. Sex in a bottle.</li>
    <li> first time i ever smelt this i had to have it!</li>
    <li> It arrive in perfect conditon and on the promised date, very satisfied with the products.</li>
    <li> Great job on the price on delivery</li>
    <li> Excellent scent lasts a lot of time, I am very happy with the purchase, will ask for this colony again</li>
    <li> One of my favorites, this masculine clean fragrance scent lasts a long time!</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t bought this cologne for my husband for several years.  We&#x27;ve tried others.  I decided to find this cologne again.  I was glad to find it on your site and at such a good price.  My husband loved it again.</li>
    <li> Awesome price for the size!</li>
