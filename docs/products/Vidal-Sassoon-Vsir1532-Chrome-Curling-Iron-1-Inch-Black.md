### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>The 1 inch barrel works perfect for me</li>
      <li>This  is the perfect curling iron!</li>
      <li>Works great and lasts.</li>
      <li>Works well, great price.</li>
      <li>Also,  Amazon has good selections from $15-$25.</li>
      <li>Love this product!</li>
      <li>Luke warm.</li>
      <li>I especially enjoy the quick heat feature</li>
      <li>I bought this iron to style wigs in a brick &amp; mortar store and paid about 70 cents more than the Amazon price.</li>
      <li>and I love it.</li>
      <li>Great curling iron with simplicity and a reasonable price.</li>
      <li>I get better results using my straightner to curl my hair.</li>
      <li>I love it</li>
      <li>have had a vidal sassoon for many years</li>
      <li>My favorite curling iron</li>
      <li>My hair seems to slip through the clamp easily.</li>
      <li>Good for those nice big curls and waves.</li>
      <li>it isn&#x27;t but should be fine.</li>
      <li>Purchased this for my wife and it works fine.</li>
      <li>So everything is fine.</li>
      <li>Cheap and lightweight.  </li>
      <li>The barrel is supposedly tourmaline infused, smooth and doesn&#x27;t snag the hair.</li>
      <li>Very affordable and easy to use.</li>
      <li>I took the handle top of her old iron</li>
      <li>You could buy a better iron and use it on low, but if you need something cheap in a pinch you can learn from it.</li>
      <li>If you work with 1 inch sections and hold the hair on the rod for 10-15 seconds, then set the curls on pins for a bit you can get nice bouncy but not too baked in look as seen on runways, and red carpets,</li>
      <li>I liked this curling iron because it gets hot enough to curl my hard-to-curl hair, it heats fairly quickly, and the price is affordable</li>
      <li>right I got the Remington wand from wal-mart</li>
      <li>Also the cord tangled up right away.</li>
      <li>I have not been able to find this particular style of curling iron in our local stores, so I was totally blessed to be able to find it Online!  </li>
      <li>: too hot (burnt a chunk of my hair and it fell off).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>you can only curl the hair in the most inside area around the hot stick.</li>
      <li>First time I used it, the plastic cover for the clip went flying across the room.  </li>
      <li>Was hoping it was exactly like the one I have. . .</li>
      <li>I love this curling iron; however, mine broke shortly after using, so taped it up and still use it.</li>
      <li>The first one Amazon sent didn&#x27;t get hot.  </li>
      <li>First of all my hair is very fine, the clamp is not tight enough to hold my hair when I wind it around the barrell, it slides right out.</li>
      <li>The high setting is probably the equivalent to the low end of medium on better curling irons.</li>
      <li>But maybe we could benefit by thinking about how much heat we really need to style hair.</li>
      <li>It does not curl my hair very well.</li>
      <li>, that was the same model number, and put it on the new iron, been working fine since.</li>
      <li>Since the entire thing heats, you need that piece to keep your thumb cool.  </li>
      <li>The second one came cracked and I tried to fix it with super glue.  </li>
      <li>suggest saving up some money to buy a decent one.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried using different curling irons through the years, and this one became my favorite several years ago.  </li>
      <li>and I love that it has very simple to operate high and low settings.  </li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t heat up fast enough or get hot</li>
      <li>When we first got it, about the third time my Wife used it</li>
      <li>and it doesn&#x27;t seem to get as hot as another smaller one that I have</li>
      <li>&lt;br /&gt;1: not hot enough (curls wont hold for more than 2 hours) or</li>
      <li>This iron DOES NOT GET HOT ENOUGH TO CURL ANYTHING.  </li>
      <li>The second one I got (as a replacement) broke the first time I used it.</li>
      <li>I can&#x27;t recall how long I had had the original at the time I moved to Mexico in 1990, but it was still with me when I moved back to the States in 2009.</li>
      <li>This unit looks old fashioned -</li>
      <li>I should have spent a little more and gotten a decent one.</li>
      <li>As I was using it, the spring that controls the metal clamp suddenly popped free, breaking a chunk out of the black plastic handle as it flew.</li>
      <li>The clamp doesn&#x27;t hold the hair and the iron doesn&#x27;t get hot enough for even my thin fine hair.</li>
      <li>It only has two settings - low and high.</li>

<li> I had probably used it no more than a dozen times when it broke.</li>
<li> Hard to find nowdays.</li>

<li> In my surprise, I reacted by jerking the iron and the hot metal section slammed against my cheek, giving me a nasty burn.</li>
<li> Extremely poor quality.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s broken.  </li>
<li> Given the price ($7.99) , I wasn&#x27;t expecting much but this curling iron is terrible.</li>
<li> This curler is horrible does crappy curls</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> the package was open when I got it</li>
    <li> Let me tell you how it takes so long to heat up and them it doesn&#x27;t even curl your hair. Don&#x27;t know what happened to it, i either threw it out or lost it, either way i don&#x27;t care. waste of my time. defiantly a waste of my money.</li>
    <li> Very affordable and easy to use. I bought it for use on my wigs and tried it last night and I love it. Good for those nice big curls and waves. Thinking about purchasing the 1/2 model for small curls. Would definitely recommend to others.</li>
    <li> I was replacing a Vidal Sassoon iron that I had for years.  The first one Amazon sent didn&#x27;t get hot.  The second one came cracked and I tried to fix it with super glue.  It finally fell apart altogether.  Cheap and lightweight.  They seemed like knock-offs.</li>
    <li> First time I used it, the plastic cover for the clip went flying across the room.  Since the entire thing heats, you need that piece to keep your thumb cool.  It&#x27;s broken.  I should have spent a little more and gotten a decent one.</li>
    <li> First of all my hair is very fine, the clamp is not tight enough to hold my hair when I wind it around the barrell, it slides right out. This iron didn&#x27;t curl well either.  Also the cord tangled up right away. I guess you get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> Works well, great price.</li>
    <li> Was hoping it was exactly like the one I have. . . it isn&#x27;t but should be fine.</li>
    <li> I liked this curling iron because it gets hot enough to curl my hard-to-curl hair, it heats fairly quickly, and the price is affordable</li>
    <li> I have been using this curling iron model for at least 10 years, have replaced it several times over the years.  This unit was not first quality:  the barrel arm doesn&#x27;t sit flat and tight against the barrel, so your hair slips out.  This is due to the tensioning spring not fitting properly in the recessed area: I compared my old one to the new one.  I actually had to wonder if this was a counterfeit product.  In the future I wi shop for this at a brick and mortar store.</li>
    <li> When we first got it, about the third time my Wife used it the handle came apart. I took the handle top of her old iron, that was the same model number, and put it on the new iron, been working fine since. The Amazon store I bought it from sent us another one anyway, that we received today. So everything is fine.</li>
    <li> My favorite curling iron</li>
    <li> This curler is horrible does crappy curls n they just fall after like 2 hours it doesn&#x27;t heat up right I got the Remington wand from wal-mart I love it</li>
    <li> I love this curling iron; however, mine broke shortly after using, so taped it up and still use it.</li>
    <li> you can only curl the hair in the most inside area around the hot stick. only the tail of your hair can be rolled.</li>
    <li> This  is the perfect curling iron! I especially enjoy the quick heat feature</li>
    <li> Not a fan. Too fat for me and it doesn&#x27;t seem to get as hot as another smaller one that I have</li>
    <li> Package was smashed up and open. It was a gift for an Angel Tree so it was dissapointing</li>
    <li> My hair seems to slip through the clamp easily. It does not curl my hair very well. I get better results using my straightner to curl my hair. It&#x27;s affordable though.</li>
    <li> Given the price ($7.99) , I wasn&#x27;t expecting much but this curling iron is terrible. It takes about 3 minutes to heat up and the two heat settings are&lt;br /&gt;1: not hot enough (curls wont hold for more than 2 hours) or&lt;br /&gt;2: too hot (burnt a chunk of my hair and it fell off).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I suggest saving up some money to buy a decent one. It doesn&#x27;t have to be a $150 curling iron, You can get the Remington wand (it works well) for about $9. Also,  Amazon has good selections from $15-$25.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried using different curling irons through the years, and this one became my favorite several years ago.  I can&#x27;t find this item locally, so I ordered several so that I&#x27;ll be supplied for a long time.</li>
    <li> Haven&#x27;t used these items yet (I ordered 2 curling irons) but I like this style and have been using them for years.</li>
    <li> I bought this iron to style wigs in a brick &amp; mortar store and paid about 70 cents more than the Amazon price. This unit looks old fashioned - I remember seeing this style of drugstore iron from the 80s. It does feel sturdy. The pamphlet says wait a few minutes for it to heat up. I think &amp;#34;a few&amp;#34; means 20-30 minutes. It only has two settings - low and high. The high setting is probably the equivalent to the low end of medium on better curling irons. But maybe we could benefit by thinking about how much heat we really need to style hair. If you work with 1 inch sections and hold the hair on the rod for 10-15 seconds, then set the curls on pins for a bit you can get nice bouncy but not too baked in look as seen on runways, and red carpets, etc., these days. The barrel is supposedly tourmaline infused, smooth and doesn&#x27;t snag the hair. You could buy a better iron and use it on low, but if you need something cheap in a pinch you can learn from it.</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t heat up fast enough or get hot enough.&lt;br /&gt;The handle is separating, I had to tape it together. I would not recommend this curling iron.</li>
    <li> have had a vidal sassoon for many years -this replaces one I had for over 10 years.  Works great and lasts.</li>
    <li> The clamp doesn&#x27;t hold the hair and the iron doesn&#x27;t get hot enough for even my thin fine hair.</li>
    <li> I have not been able to find this particular style of curling iron in our local stores, so I was totally blessed to be able to find it Online!  The 1 inch barrel works perfect for me and I love that it has very simple to operate high and low settings.  Love this product!</li>
    <li> I  like the size and the short time it takes to heatd up. I&#x27;ve had a Sassoon in the past and it lasted a very long time.</li>
    <li> The first one I bought arrived with the little black tab broken from the barrel. The second one I got (as a replacement) broke the first time I used it. Extremely poor quality. Would never buy this again.</li>
    <li> My wife loves it and she teaches hairdressing.</li>
    <li> I bought this item because my previous curling iron was a Vidal Sassoon that lasted for decades. I can&#x27;t recall how long I had had the original at the time I moved to Mexico in 1990, but it was still with me when I moved back to the States in 2009. When it died in late 2012, I bought the Vsir1532 from Amazon. I had probably used it no more than a dozen times when it broke. As I was using it, the spring that controls the metal clamp suddenly popped free, breaking a chunk out of the black plastic handle as it flew. In my surprise, I reacted by jerking the iron and the hot metal section slammed against my cheek, giving me a nasty burn. Proctor and Gamble is the American parent company for Vidal Sassoon hair care appliances. It off-shored the manufacture of this curling iron to--big surprise!--China. I&#x27;m not blaming China--it was P &amp; G&#x27;s crummy design and material specifications that the Chinese had to follow.</li>
    <li> Purchased this for my wife and it works fine.</li>
    <li> This iron DOES NOT GET HOT ENOUGH TO CURL ANYTHING.  Luke warm. Zero  stars</li>
    <li> Not sure I would purchase something like this again because I don&#x27;t think I received a brand new item like I thought I was going to.</li>
    <li> Great curling iron with simplicity and a reasonable price. Hard to find nowdays.</li>
    <li> I realize now that it is way too big for me.  I should have gotten a 3/4 inch barrel.  Now what do I do?</li>
