<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> I love it! Since I used many Korean cosmetics, because there are quite many wellmade products that are world famouse, in Serum, this product became &amp;#34;must-use&amp;#34; Korean product for me. At my first use, the flowery scent was so good that make me smile, and when apply it was very smooth and well-moisturized that I didn&#x27;t have to use a heavy night cream after. In the changeable weather like these days, for my dryer skin, it was the best choice I&#x27;ve made lately.</li>
    <li> A friend recommended Red Serum for my growing skincare needs. She has amazing skin, so I figured what works on her hopefully works on me. So far, it is a pretty solid serum.  Here are my Top 10 reasons why it deserves a 5-star review: 10) Fast, no-hassle delivery. 9) Applicator is not annoying compared to other serum applicators I have used in the past. 8) Does not interfere with application of makeup. 7) My hun does not mind me applying it on him. 6) Seems to reduce inflammation. 5) Reduced the wrinkles near my eyes because I like to smile real hard everytime someone takes a picture. 4) Quick skin absorption 3) Does not make my face oily 2) Definitely moisturizing, because my skin feels like silk following the application. 1) Sweet, refreshing scent that reminds me of being in a spa. Now that is the best way to end a day!</li>
    <li> I have heard about this product so many times since it&#x27;s been a very famous hot selling product among Korean Celebrities. Finally, I got my own bottle and stared to use it. OMG the aroma of the serum is the first pleasant surprise I got. I am so irritated by so many fragrances and I even get headaches by certain perfumes, but this beautiful natural floral scent -I think it&#x27;s the Jasmine Flower- gives me calm sprit and relaxation to a point I think it has a therapeutic effect or something. Then I applied the serum to my face and my neck. With multiple tap of my fingertip, it was fully absorbed and I go for the second layer. First 2 times of the trial I only applied one layer and it was good, but I felt I needed more. I have a very dry skin and the serum is absolutely moisturizing. After the second layer gets absorbed I get the moisturized and slightly tightened feeling. When I feel the need, I apply third layer and I fall asleep. Good sleep always is a good boost to the skin ^^. When I woke up in the morning, I immediately felt my skin is still so moisturized and soft. I&#x27;ve been using it for lil over a week now and I can clearly see my skin tone is being improved. It&#x27;s definitely much more moisture and the tone is getting clearer. I&#x27;m just afraid I would be addicted to the product and would need to order my second bottle soon!</li>
    <li> I have only been using this for two weeks but already my skin is softer. It works well as a booster with my current routine (consisting of weekly aha treatment, hydrating toner, fermented essence, whitening serum, propolis, and a rich cream). The serum is clear, the bottle is red, it absorbs quickly, is just slightly tacky on my skin until the next product is added, and smells like a berry candy or juice I had as a kid (not an unpleasant smell but not natural). It may be a combination of my whole routine, but after the first week since adding in this product my closed comedones from my temples have decreased faster.  7/25/15 Edit: now that I&#x27;ve used this product for even longer I&#x27;m really seeing even more improvement. It&#x27;s truly helped my routine tackle my skin care issues even faster. My discolored scar spots from acne have shrunk in size. This is a big deal for me because I&#x27;ve suffered from consistent breakouts for a long time (there by accumulating a LOT of post inflammatory hyperpigmentation) and now that my acne is somewhat under control the spots were maybe fading after months. This is working in weeks! Yay! Plus it&#x27;s cheaper now. I bought it at $55, which I would pay again, but now it&#x27;s $35. Oh, and as a tip, you really only need a few drops at a time. You can mix it in with another essence/ampoule or your cream.</li>
    <li> First off the natural fruit scent of this product is AMAZING!  This serum will give you a natural glow and soft skin through out the day.  Be sure to layer it right with all your other products.  My rule of thumb is put the most expensive product on first haha.</li>
    <li> First off, this product has an amazing refreshing scent it. It&#x27;s very light,airy and nothing to strong or over powering. I am very sensitive to any products with intense smells. This gives my face a very smooth and soft feeling to the touch. I really feel it gives my skin a natural glow. This has really become my go to product as far as my skin care is concerned.  My skin feels more hydrated, moisturized and revitalized. I have tried a lot of different products too and haven&#x27;t found many that I feel really have an impact. I have even recently gotten a few compliments on the natural glow of my skin. I plan to stick with this product! I am totally addicted!! Would highly recommend!!</li>
    <li> I have lived in Hawaii for 30+ years and this means my skin is fried from the sun exposure. I have dark spots and wrinkles so I am always trying different skin care products for my face.  So when I was offered this Advanced Korean Anti Aging Serum called Red for a great deal to try and share my honest opinion about it, I definitely wanted to try it. I have been using it for almost 2 weeks and my skin feels and looks great. I have noticed that my skin is softer and not as rough looking. I definitely recommend this Red Serum for anyone looking for a great Anti Aging Serum.</li>
    <li> I got this Red Serum since my skin texture is changing as I get older.  The bottle is a generous size, and I use 4 drops in the morning and night.  I love the scent, light, soft floral, sort of reminds me of Jasmine Tea.  The liquid is thin, but thick enough to spread and feels great on my face.  I know that the bottle will last a long time.  I have noticed that my skin texture looks more fine, and I&#x27;ve been using it about a month.  It&#x27;s a nice quality skin serum that I&#x27;d recommend for women or men.</li>
    <li> Over the years I&#x27;ve been neglecting my skin because it wasn&#x27;t a manly thing to do. Being outdoors without using sunblock aged my skin tremendously to the point of not bothering to try anymore. I have acne scars as well as brown spots and felt that nothing would improve my skin without laser surgery. Having combination sensitive skin, most products don&#x27;t work well on me, whether it&#x27;s being to oily or greasy to something that smells like perfume. Until my girlfriend wanted me to try this product out. Over the week of using Red Serum, my skin feels more hydrated and even. My parents even mentioned that I look less tired, only after using this product for a week. Plus side is that the smell of the product isn&#x27;t offensive. Being a guy in my mid 30s I wish I came across this product sooner!</li>
    <li> When I first saw this Advanced Koren Anti Aging Serum - RED - I thought that if nothing else it would be good for my skin because f the vitamins. I have been using vitamin enriched lotion on my hands that seems to really help but it is just to heavy to use around my eyes. This looked like something I could use for those crows feet and maybe get rid of that sun spot once and for all!  When the bottle first arrived I was really impressed with the clearness of the fluid. I was glad to see this was not some heavy unnatural lotion like type of thing. It was a bit sticky when first out of the bottle but quickly smoothed out and my skin soaked it up. That surprised me because I had just used lotion not too long before trying this out. I used this on my one dark spot on my cheek and around my eyes and mouth. I am getting those tell tale signs that come with the menopause years. I noticed in just a short time that the wrinkles of all those years of using soda straws were greatly diminished. What a fantastic first impression. After a week the lines are fading and the dark spot is lightening. I was a doubter but not so much anymore! I received this item at a reduced cost for testing and evaluation purposes. This review is my unbiased and independent opinion and based entirely on my examination of, and my personal experience with, this product. My opinion may differ from yours, however I hope that my review helps you decide whether this is the right product for your needs or not.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve only used it for about 4-5 days and my skin is softer I was surprised!</li>
    <li> I wanted to like this product, buy made my break out worst</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve tried many Korean skin care products and I must say this is one of the best and effective serum I&#x27;ve used. In addition to making my skin glow and brightens, it has the most organical natural berry smell to it. I&#x27;m allergic to fragrance in many of the skin product and this is the only skin care that I love to put on daily.  Love love this product!!</li>
    <li> Aging gracefully is what I always said to myself, but to do that you need to take care of your skin. I order this serum through a special deal to try it and share my results an honest opinion. I am absolutely impressed with the quality of this serum, it is not runny, comes with a dropper so you wont waste product and is quick absorbed by the skin. After 10 days I have noticed the reduction of appearance of my fine lines and my skin is super soft. Knowing that the power behind this serum is a selection of antioxidant fruits makes me feel good about what I am putting on my face. I&#x27;ve been using daily and I do recommend it.</li>
    <li> I play a lot of golf and my face shows signs of sun damage and aging. I started to use Red Serum for several weeks and&lt;br /&gt;notice that my face skin feels softer and elastic. The direction on the label says to use 2 drops, but I&#x27;ve been using about 4 drops focus on side of my eyes where wringles are.  I think this serum is much more effective than face lotions that I&#x27;ve been using.</li>
    <li> Red Serum makes the skin on my face appear to be clearer, brighter and revitalized. I love the fresh soft fragrance, nothing overbearing and that&#x27;s good! I&#x27;ve noticed a difference in just 9 days of use, I&#x27;m looking forward to continued skin improvement.</li>
    <li> My skin is always super dry and I&#x27;m already starting to get wrinkles at the corners of my eyes. This product makes my face feel wonderful and has already begun reducing the wrinkles! It also smells so lovely!</li>
    <li> Great product. Great idea.  I highly recommend buying a bottle or two and give it a try. You won&#x27;t believe the difference is the way your skin looks and feels.  I hope you enjoy it add much as I have. .</li>
    <li> I like it. Have been using it for about a week. It is starting to even out the tone of my face and it has a very nice smell. I will repurchase it</li>
    <li> My skin used to be very dry, but since i started using this product, my skin became soft and moist. Because of the moisturized skin, my wrinkles started disappearing. I will definitely continue using it. Hopefully I will look younger than right now in near future!</li>
    <li> I have been using the Red Serum for about a week now and my face feels so soft!  I love the smell and texture of the Red Serum!  In the past couple days, I&#x27;ve been noticing that my skin is less oily and the areas of my face with larger pores are actually smaller.  Must Must Must try!!!!</li>
    <li> Smell nice and I feel my skin glow better</li>
    <li> I received this product free or at a discount in exchange for my honest review.&lt;br /&gt;First of all this stuff smells amazing.  I have tried many facial serums but this is the only one that smells great!  It feels great on your skin and like I said it has a nice fragrance that is not too strong.  The bottle it comes in is also an eye catching red color.  i have noticed the change in my skin already.  It seems smoother and softer.  I use this in the morning and night before my moisturizer.</li>
    <li> Great product.  The Koreans do skin care right!  Where I live, i tend to get dried out quite a bit which is the precursor to wrinkles and aged looking skin.  This stuff keeps my skin nice and moist, so I have not been seeing the deep lines as much around my eyes and mouth, especially when I see my smile in pictures.  I will continue to use this product.</li>
    <li> I have used this serum for a week now and so far, I&#x27;m loving this serum!  The very first night I put this serum on, I woke up with my skin feeing so soft and moist without any irritation. It even smells amazing. After using this for a week, I even noticed that wrinkles around my eye area are less noticible. I&#x27;m very happy with this product and I definitely recommend this product to anyone who wishes to have a younger looking skin.</li>
    <li> I have always stayed away from serums because of my combination skin but I had the opportunity to purchase this Red anti aging serum at a promotional discount for my personal use and review. I done a little research first and took the offer. Simply wash and dry your face. And apply a small amount. It goes on smooth and my skin just drinks it right up. I have been using this under makeup and my make up goes on so much better. My skin is glowing and with daily use I think I will be able to fade some acne scars from my younger days and reverse some of the signs of aging I have. Red serum has a synergistic combination of high quality ingredients for maximum results.  It decimates free radicals and reverses signs of aging leaving you with glowing skin much like you had in your 20&#x27;s.</li>
    <li> Good..good&lt;br /&gt;I love it</li>
    <li> Great product! I like it better than Lancôme Genifique.</li>
    <li> I love this products I&#x27;ve notice my skin gets more smoothly and more brighten definitely buying this again</li>
    <li> I did not review last week since I had just received the serum and I wanted to be accurate in my review.  I had been carefully looking for a Vitamin C Serum, since so many oxidize quickly. Yellow is not what you want in your Vitamin C Serum; it means it has oxidized. I had some recommendations, but the reviews were touted as being unstable thus oxidizing quickly; in fact, before receipt of the product. Thus after reading Red Serum reviews I decided to purchase it. I have been using it for one-week and have noticeably smoother, even tone, and brighter skin. I have used many Vitamin C serums and other products, but this is one of the first products I have seen a noticeable difference so quickly. I do hope the positive changes in my skin will continue. I am 52 YOA and my skin looks wonderful and radiant. I keep the serum in the refrigerator since Vitamin C products oxidize quickly.  I highly recommend this product. I am going to order another bottle after I submit this review.</li>
    <li> I think this serum is very good. I agree with other reviews that the fragrance, packaging, bottle color and design are great. This Vitamin C serum stands out, I think, because it absorbs into the skin nicely and leaves a dewy finish. It does not feel crusty or tight like some other vitamin c products do. I use it with a msm cream as sulfur and vitamin c work synergistically.  I have noted a real reduction of hyperpigmentation on my face and on an old jellyfish sting scar that looks like a large collection of  dark freckles on my forearm. Still slightly visible but much less so now. Overall, I&#x27;m impressed.</li>
    <li> I have been staying nights at a the hospital for 2 months off &amp; on- &amp; now up north for hospice care for a relative. I didn&#x27;t pack any of my serums, etc. because I knew there would be no time to use them. I was right!  I got home today for a 2 night stay at home. I got this RED Serum in the mail, used it &amp; fell in love.  Everything you need is in this serum!  No need to layer different serums, oils, creams which I don&#x27;t have time for right now. I cleaned my face &amp; put this on &amp; instantly felt relaxed!  It is so nice to treat yourself!  Kinda selfish at this time but it did make me feel better to catch up!  I didn&#x27;t detect a scent but I&#x27;m kind of stuffed up.  It is not RED- just the name! Not sticky but definitely not runny. My skin ate it up. I let it dry &amp; put some more on. Feels wonderful-now I&#x27;m ready to tackle a bunch of chores, wash clothes &amp; repack my suitcase. My new RED serum is going with me-since it only takes a minute to refresh myself.  Who could ask for more? Vit C, hyaluronic acid, retinol.-all that &amp; more. Brightens skin-I need it! I did receive this at a reduced cost for an honest opinion. THANK YOU!</li>
    <li> I really have enjoyed using this serum. I absolutely love the way it feels on my face. Very soft and smooth. The smell is wonderful, very fresh. I put this on my face morning and night. It soaks into my face very quickly, which is a plus for me. I dont have to add any time to my morning ritual.  Since using this product, my face has started looking more healthy and radiant. Really looking forward to more products form this brand. Maybe a face wash next?</li>
    <li> It arrived very quickly. I couldn&#x27;t wait to try it, heard such a great things from a friend who&#x27;s been using it for years. It&#x27;s been 2 weeks since I have been using it and I love it. I&#x27;m in my early 40 &#x27; s and my skin is a combination skin, some areas are oily and some areas dries out too quickly. This serum seems to balance out my skin&#x27;s oiliness and doesn&#x27;t dry out my skin, it seems to be smoothing out my skin tone. It has a fruity smell like pomegranate... absorbs into your skin pretty quickly. It&#x27;s little sticky but it goes away quickly. I&#x27;m excited to see how my skin will look and feel after using this for a while.</li>
    <li> I have not really taken care of my skin very well over the years beyond just washing my face with soap.  A friend recommended that I try Red Serum.  After using Red Serum for a little more than 2 weeks, my skin looks healthier, more clear, smoother and younger looking.  It&#x27;s easy to apply and smells incredible.  I even have received compliments from a few friends.  I highly recommend Red Serum to those people who want to have healthier looking skin!!</li>
    <li> So far I really like this product. The texture and scent of the product is amazing. It did clear up my skin of troubles and acne. However to fully determine the outcome, I will wait and see by the end of the month.</li>
    <li> I have used it for a week now... I am a believer... My face had sun damage for working in the sun for years. This serum feels great and I can see positive results.</li>
    <li> If you have rosacea, this serum is for you. It calms my redness down, and the slip/feel is not sticky - it&#x27;s smooth!&lt;br /&gt;It helped clear up some red spots, not sure if it&#x27;s permanent. It would&#x27;ve gotten 5 stars, but it&#x27;s got a lot of fragrance to it. If you like honeysuckle (the fragrance) and have rosacea, this is for you!</li>
    <li> This serum is clear if you are wondering! It&#x27;s great because it hydrates and will make your skin feel soft and dewy like. I follow up after with my regular moisturizer with SPF. I actually use this serum on the back of my hands too. I love the light floral scent. I changed this to four stars as I just discovered Clarins serum, but it is so expensive at the stores and the ones on amazon are apparently not the real deal.  I&#x27;ll stick to this one for now.&lt;br /&gt;Update: I changed my review to 5 stars because I noticed it helped my skin stay clear. Love it.</li>
    <li> Great smell and hydrating</li>
    <li> This serum is amazing!  I&#x27;m a connoisseur of all types of serums and lotions and take good care of my skin.  I bought this because Koreans know their skincare, but I also bought it for its price.  It wasn&#x27;t too expensive like La Mer or La Prairie, but yet it is still as effective.  My fine lines have decreased and my skin looks bright and radiant!  It goes on clean and not too oily.  The smell is light and not overpowering. You don&#x27;t need to buy expensive brands for full effect.  I will buy this again.</li>
    <li> This product is highly recommended for dry and sensitive skin like me. My skin cannot handle any type of cosmetics but this RED SERUM, nlnot only it has amazing fragrance, unlike other serum, it does not dry up quickly. It keeps my skin moist and soft. I put it on my face, neck, and my hand too! I am really sensitive with fragrance. No matter how expensive it is, I usually throw them away but this RED SERUM&#x27;s fragrance makes me want to put more on and on and on. It is not sticky or stinky.</li>
    <li> Just got it but it sure seems to wor fast!&lt;br /&gt;My skin looks super good n young !</li>
    <li> This is my nth bottle.  This serum is amazing.  I used to buy it from ebay or other website.  Amazon has the best price!  I will continue to re-purchase.</li>
