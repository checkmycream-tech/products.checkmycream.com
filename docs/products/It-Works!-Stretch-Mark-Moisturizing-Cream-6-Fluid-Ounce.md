    <li> I have been using on a scar for a week and out has made a significant difference... You can get it for $45 on the ItWorks site&lt;br /&gt;[...]&lt;br /&gt;ItWorks global has a policy against selling on Amazon to make sure you don&#x27;t get expired product. They want you to go through them directly (if it&#x27;s expired you run the risk that it won&#x27;t properly work)</li>
    <li> I love this cream. .. however, I got it a lil cheaper by becoming a Loyal Customer on Bodaciousbody.myitworks.com. I&#x27;m still using it! It&#x27;s  they fade away!!!!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m an It Works distributor who just had a baby 3 months ago. I started using the cream as soon as I got home from the hospital and I now have no trace of my stretch marks. I&#x27;m very happy with these results.&lt;br /&gt;Visit my website at KKBNWraps.com to get this product for $39!</li>
    <li> Honestly none of the It Works Products actually work. I have tried this cream, the lip and eye, the thermoforming and the fat burner. None of them worked. Any positive reviews of this stuff are from people who are selling it. Save your money!</li>
    <li> Have used it for 2.5 months as directed and have seen almost no change in my stretch marks.</li>
    <li> This is way over priced on here and This is NOT Compliant to sell on here, were not allowed to sell on any sites like this.  It is best to buy directly from a distributor, these all have expiration dates  Check my link out at collarfit.itworks.com  I am a distributor and It Works gives amazing deals for their loyal customers and I have seen amazing results from the It Works Products.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t work for me I used an entire tube twice a day as directed with no results whatsoever. Save your money</li>
    <li> I ordered the it works stretch mark cream, but received the defining gel instead. Will be returning product.</li>
    <li> This is a pretty neat product. But like everyone else is saying you need to support the small businesses and buy direct from a distributor. The loyal customer program is pretty simple. Basically, how it works is you sign up and get a great price but you have to sign up for an auto ship of product for 3 months, after the 3 months you can stop the auto ship and still be a customer and order when ever you want for the discount price. Much cheaper that way. You can get this same bottle for $39&lt;br /&gt;Try this distributor site.&lt;br /&gt;brittcanwrap.myitworks.com</li>
    <li> These products are much more affordable if you get them from an It Works distributor. Molly Carr</li>
    <li> To make sure that your product is not expired and authentic purchase from an It Works Global Distributor! It&#x27;s hard to give a good review if you don&#x27;t know if your product is in optimal quality. Glossywrapsandwellness.com</li>
    <li> This cream works great on softening the skin around the scars. It helps to keep the skin moist and not dried out. After using two other tubes before this one, I have only barely noticed any change in stretch marks in regards to making them less visible. It does help to keep these marks from itching and drying out. It is still a good cream to use but it doesn&#x27;t fit up to my expectations.</li>
    <li> This product is great!  Mt husband used it on his stretch marks that are over 10 years old. You need to buy products from a distributor to make sure it is not expired. Email me at christinebmatthias@hotmail.com and I can send can give you the info for my distributor.</li>
    <li> Great Product Got mine for half off at http://excellenthealth.myitworks.com/shop/</li>
    <li> I grew a cup size and got a few stretch marks on my breasts, in one week they had begun to fade and now they are almost gone. This stuff is great, I would recommend it to anyone. It is a bit pricy here so find a distributor for sure.</li>
    <li> I loved the products so much I became an It Works! distributor, I can get you this product at my price with a 10$ credit toward future purchases! email me jenni.light@hotmail.com if youre interested in hearing more!</li>
    <li> GreAt product this bottle lasted me for four months doesn&#x27;t get rid of the stretch marks but it made them lighter</li>
    <li> I love this stretch mark cream! After using it I decided to become a distributor because I had never used anything that actually helped lighten my stretch marks so quickly! It&#x27;s cheaper if you are a loyal customer with the It Works company tho! teannaflores.myitworks.com</li>
    <li> I have tried many stretch mark creams with no results. I purchased this one while I was pregnant with my 3rd because it&#x27;s safe to use during pregnancy. It prevented more stretch marks and helped diminish the old ones. I love this stuff but I got mine for half this price at www.yourwrapgirlamanda.myitworks.com as loyal customer. You save 40% off of retail as well as earn cash back(perk points) they have many great products to choose from so it&#x27;s definitely worth it. I would shop around before spending too much</li>
    <li> It Works products are all natural and really do work! If you want wholesale prices, go to coachslaton.myitworks.com</li>
