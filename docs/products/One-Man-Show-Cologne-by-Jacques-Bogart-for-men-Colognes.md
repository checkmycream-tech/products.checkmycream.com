### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>but this thing does project with excellent longevity.</li>
      <li>Not the best smell out there</li>
      <li>Excellent cologne.</li>
      <li>Very Very good scent</li>
      <li>If your in the market for a great smelling spicy,tobacco and woodsy.</li>
      <li>so I&#x27;ll settle for the great aroma.</li>
      <li>Great Price.  </li>
      <li>Great Scent,</li>
      <li>/&gt;The customer who said that One Man Show is \\&quot;a great</li>
      <li>Great odor killer for the cat litterbox</li>
      <li>Great buy.  </li>
      <li>it is a good deal</li>
      <li>I know good cologne from garbage</li>
      <li>Thank you for the good deal.</li>
      <li>I cannot think of an occasion where this would do me any good.    </li>
      <li>Just one spray on chest will do it; if you want more then just rub you wrist on your chest and you should be good!</li>
      <li>It has a great aroma and some of had told me it is even sexy.</li>
      <li>It is a great and refreshing smell.  </li>
      <li>the odor itself is amazing to be honest.</li>
      <li>Nice scent.</li>
      <li>However, i warn that DO NOT over spray this powerful potion or you and people around you will be agony!!!</li>
      <li>I use this for the first time in 1986 and i loved it, then i moved and i could not find it anymore for 25 years and now that amazon sell it, I&#x27;m a happy camper.&lt;br</li>
      <li>It should be marked as unisex somehow because it smells amazingly awesome on women too.  </li>
      <li>Each skin has to match up with a fragrance from this large market , this one is great for night.</li>
      <li>I think it makes him smell sexy.</li>
      <li>But when someone comes in close and, for example, smells your neck; they can enjoy a really nice spicy/musky scent.  </li>
      <li>and this is an outstanding product.</li>
      <li>One of my husbands favorite cologne.</li>
      <li>Compare to the price you pay for Eau De Toilette, is ok</li>
      <li>it stays on your body most of the day so that is a plus for me.</li>
      <li>If you have never smelled this captivating scent for men, you should.  </li>
      <li>We love it.  </li>
      <li>One man show is what it is, a unique product in a class of its own.</li>
      <li>There are some scents that are priced low, and yet smells very good (Quorum, for instance).</li>
      <li>The spray cap is cheap plastic and the moment you hold it</li>
      <li>/&gt;Overall, this is a relatively cheap scent, both in price and quality.</li>
      <li>I don&#x27;t have to spray on much to get a nice lingering smell</li>
      <li>never buying cheap cologne again</li>
      <li>It is the perfect blend, not too heavy and gross like so many &amp;#34;popular&amp;#34; men&#x27;s fragrances and toiletries today!</li>
      <li>for me, this cologne is like \\&quot;Aroma therapy\\&quot; because it brings back a lots of good memories.</li>
      <li>One Man Show is my absolute favorite cologne.  </li>
      <li>However, the upshot is that it&#x27;s good for any time of year, smells nice, and is a small investment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>Thing is not transcendental but for the price of the goods is not bad, the smell lasts a couple of hours.</li>
      <li>True to its name, this makes any man the main attraction anytime, anywhere!!!</li>
      <li>The speed with which my bottles got to me and the very low price made this a very satisfying transaction.</li>
      <li>/&gt;It smells like an uptown version of Bounce&#x27;s \\&quot;Fresh Linen\\&quot; scented dryer sheets.</li>
      <li>but it was worth a risk.</li>
      <li>Quick delivery and item exactly as described.&amp;#34;</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll pay more in Macy&#x27;s for example in the future just to buy something I can trust , something of high quality.&lt;br /&gt;But</li>
      <li>Just right.</li>
      <li>Priced just right.</li>
      <li>, tobacco and wood[s]\\&quot; is maybe right about two of these things, although he or she has no idea what tobacco smells like.</li>
      <li>Both showed the same problem as many reviewers warned that many perfumes through amazon are old..</li>
      <li>but it doesn&#x27;t last for more than 2-3 hour at most&lt;br /&gt;overall</li>
      <li>, I&#x27;ve noticed, higher priced items don&#x27;t come close.</li>
      <li>This cologne is something I have gotten for several years; love it.</li>
      <li>This was one of my first cologne&#x27;s that I used and it means what it says</li>
      <li>It will create attention from women, it will make your chest wider and biceps stronger,it will make women question if they are strong enough to say No to you, it will make them remember you.</li>
      <li>I love this scent, its very strong and a little goes a long way.</li>
      <li>Don&#x27;t really know the scent of this EDT.</li>
      <li>This scent is quite calm, but is for those domestic individuals 35+, imo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>I met him recently and he is still as sexy and masculine as he was back then.</li>
      <li>&quot; has a very sensitive nose.</li>
      <li>Of all the mens scents I have tried this is the first one where I&#x27;ve emptied one bottle and gone onto the next.</li>
      <li>The customer who said, \\&quot;It has a very potent but at the same time subtle scent\\&quot; is correct in regard to the approach of this cologne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br</li>
      <li>its&#x27; ok or a dirty frenchman its fine.</li>
      <li>Well... on a sunny day (SUNDAY) after a shower you want to feel a little fresh and smell like laundry</li>
      <li>The opening is a blast of coarse and LOUD smell of chemicals.</li>

<li> Last all day, but a sec is too long....</li>
<li> Very green, a bit piney and long lasting.</li>
<li> I totally disagree with other comments about being harsh and rednekish.</li>
<li> Oh No.. not worth the price.</li>
<li> Actually less.</li>
<li> This is as impolite and harsh a fragrance could get.</li>
<li> Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
<li> After a few years together we went our separate ways, but we stayed in touch.</li>
<li> /&gt;The customer who said, \\&quot;This is as impolite and harsh a fragrance</li>
<li> Not strong, doesn&#x27;t leave a trail of scent as you walk about.  </li>
<li> It is not easy to find it so get it while you can.</li>
<li> for a human to wear this you&#x27;d have to be a pig farmer or dirty old man with false teeth.  </li>
<li> i ordered this cologne based on some positive reviews but when i received i was greatly disappointed, it smells</li>
<li> Fake smell gone fore 30 sec.</li>
<li> This fragrance is no good for any day.</li>
<li> It&#x27;s either a knock off or just a poor product.</li>
<li> You can not go wrong with this Eau De Toilette.&lt;br /&gt;Also</li>
<li> For the price you cant go wrong.</li>
<li> you should wear this scent for a day time drinking or casual lunch or brunch.</li>
<li> But this is unmistakably bad smelling, I gave this bottle away.    </li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> One Man Show turns your man into just that!  A one man show!  Everyone will ask what he(or you for that matter!) is wearing.  If not, they&#x27;ll be wondering! One Man Show is my absolute favorite cologne.  It should be marked as unisex somehow because it smells amazingly awesome on women too.  This stuff is THE BOMB!!! To me anyway.</li>
    <li> I have been using One Man Show eau de cologne for 15 years. It has a great aroma and some of had told me it is even sexy. I am 66 so I&#x27;ll settle for the great aroma. The speed with which my bottles got to me and the very low price made this a very satisfying transaction.</li>
    <li> I use this for the first time in 1986 and i loved it, then i moved and i could not find it anymore for 25 years and now that amazon sell it, I&#x27;m a happy camper.&lt;br /&gt;The smell is not too spicy and is not too woody or fruity, Just right. it stays on your body most of the day so that is a plus for me. You can not go wrong with this Eau De Toilette.&lt;br /&gt;Also for me, this cologne is like \\&quot;Aroma therapy\\&quot; because it brings back a lots of good memories.</li>
    <li> This is as impolite and harsh a fragrance could get. The opening is a blast of coarse and LOUD smell of chemicals. I cannot think of an occasion where this would do me any good.    There are some scents that are priced low, and yet smells very good (Quorum, for instance). But this is unmistakably bad smelling, I gave this bottle away.    NOT recommended.</li>
    <li> Each skin has to match up with a fragrance from this large market , this one is great for night.</li>
    <li> My man loves this and so do I!  It is an oldie but goodie. I think it makes him smell sexy.</li>
    <li> If you have never smelled this captivating scent for men, you should.  Not strong, doesn&#x27;t leave a trail of scent as you walk about.  But when someone comes in close and, for example, smells your neck; they can enjoy a really nice spicy/musky scent.  Of all the mens scents I have tried this is the first one where I&#x27;ve emptied one bottle and gone onto the next.</li>
    <li> Thing is not transcendental but for the price of the goods is not bad, the smell lasts a couple of hours. As for fragrance, you know who likes and who ...</li>
    <li> for a human to wear this you&#x27;d have to be a pig farmer or dirty old man with false teeth.  Great odor killer for the cat litterbox or if a skunk is nearby but for a human -- I&#x27;d look elsewhere.  Maybe for the Hunchback of Notre Dame its&#x27; ok or a dirty frenchman its fine.</li>
    <li> I brought this item because my mother convinced me too, and I was blown away,,,best buy, must have.  You won&#x27;t regret your choice</li>
    <li> My hubby has been wearing this for the last 17 years. We love it.  Detroit finest wears ONE MAN. Dee-troiut!!</li>
    <li> Very Very good scent but it doesn&#x27;t last for more than 2-3 hour at most&lt;br /&gt;overall it is a good deal</li>
    <li> I am biased about this fragrance. I really like the sharp spirt and woodsy smell of thi spray and will definitly buy again...!!!</li>
    <li> This was one of my first cologne&#x27;s that I used and it means what it says One Man Show !!!</li>
    <li> i ordered this cologne based on some positive reviews but when i received i was greatly disappointed, it smells so bad.&lt;br /&gt;i&#x27;m never buying cheap cologne again</li>
    <li> This fragrance is no good for any day. The spray cap is cheap plastic and the moment you hold it you will realize Oh No.. not worth the price.</li>
    <li> Compare to the price you pay for Eau De Toilette, is ok</li>
    <li> This cologne is something I have gotten for several years; love it. It is the perfect blend, not too heavy and gross like so many &amp;#34;popular&amp;#34; men&#x27;s fragrances and toiletries today!</li>
    <li> Well... on a sunny day (SUNDAY) after a shower you want to feel a little fresh and smell like laundry you should wear this scent for a day time drinking or casual lunch or brunch. However, i warn that DO NOT over spray this powerful potion or you and people around you will be agony!!! Just one spray on chest will do it; if you want more then just rub you wrist on your chest and you should be good!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve been using this product for years but never found a price like this.  Great Scent, Great Price.  Thank you for the good deal.</li>
    <li> Last all day, but a sec is too long.... Not for the western world</li>
    <li> If your in the market for a great smelling spicy,tobacco and woodsy. Look no further, this is it. Priced just right., I&#x27;ve noticed, higher priced items don&#x27;t come close. One man show is what it is, a unique product in a class of its own.</li>
    <li> Nice scent. I got it at a discount. Never heard of brand before but it was worth a risk. It paid off. My likes it a lot. I don&#x27;t have to spray on much to get a nice lingering smell</li>
    <li> Not the best smell out there but this thing does project with excellent longevity.</li>
    <li> I was using this cologne about 20 years ago. After a few years together we went our separate ways, but we stayed in touch. I met him recently and he is still as sexy and masculine as he was back then. I purchased it from Amazon the minute I found it. I totally disagree with other comments about being harsh and rednekish. I know good cologne from garbage and this is an outstanding product. It will create attention from women, it will make your chest wider and biceps stronger,it will make women question if they are strong enough to say No to you, it will make them remember you. If you do not need all of that - go with a two dollar after shave at the gas station.</li>
    <li> One of my husbands favorite cologne. We hd looked for years before we found it</li>
    <li> Excellent cologne. Very green, a bit piney and long lasting. Definitely a woody fragrance with spicy undertones. For the price you cant go wrong.</li>
    <li> It is a great and refreshing smell.  Great buy.  It is not easy to find it so get it while you can.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s either a knock off or just a poor product. Evaporates almost instantly, no matter the amount you spray. It practically doesn&#x27;t make sense even to use it. Don&#x27;t waste your money.</li>
    <li> I love this scent, its very strong and a little goes a long way.</li>
    <li> Fake smell gone fore 30 sec.</li>
    <li> True to its name, this makes any man the main attraction anytime, anywhere!!! And you are without doubt bound to have friends and total strangers wanting  to know what cologn you are wearing!</li>
    <li> It doesn&#x27;t last over an hour!! Actually less. I received it together with Ck cologne .. Both showed the same problem as many reviewers warned that many perfumes through amazon are old.. I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll pay more in Macy&#x27;s for example in the future just to buy something I can trust , something of high quality.&lt;br /&gt;But the odor itself is amazing to be honest.</li>
    <li> Quick delivery and item exactly as described.&amp;#34;</li>
    <li> Bought the  \\&quot;One Man Show By Jacques Bogart For Men\\&quot; as a gift for a friend. Don&#x27;t really know the scent of this EDT.</li>
    <li> The customer who said, \\&quot;It has a very potent but at the same time subtle scent\\&quot; is correct in regard to the approach of this cologne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The customer who said, \\&quot;This is as impolite and harsh a fragrance could get\\&quot; has a very sensitive nose. This scent is quite calm, but is for those domestic individuals 35+, imo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The customer who said that One Man Show is \\&quot;a great smelling\\&quot; scent that is a mixture of \\&quot;spic[e], tobacco and wood[s]\\&quot; is maybe right about two of these things, although he or she has no idea what tobacco smells like. Woods and spice, perhaps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, this is a relatively cheap scent, both in price and quality. However, the upshot is that it&#x27;s good for any time of year, smells nice, and is a small investment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It smells like an uptown version of Bounce&#x27;s \\&quot;Fresh Linen\\&quot; scented dryer sheets.</li>
