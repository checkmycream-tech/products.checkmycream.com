      <li>#34;too hot&amp;#34; for their mouths, but they have gradually made the switch and don&#x27;t notice it any more.  </li>
      <li>Love it.</li>

      <li>My son loved the taste and it keeps his breath fresh</li>
      <li>I tried the toothpaste myself and it seemed ok.  </li>
      <li>They like mint flavored toothpaste, but most of them are &amp;#34;too minty&amp;#34; and give the kids a burning feeling in their mouths.</li>
      <li>My daughter loves the taste and that its a great in-between paste for older kids.</li>
      <li>so getting one that has mint that isn&#x27;t too strong was important.</li>
      <li>I LOVE that Crest has come out with a new toothpaste to help kids bridge from fruity flavored toothpaste to a more minty variety.  </li>
      <li>After each clean, the toothpaste leave a fresh smelling in mouth, which brings confidence.</li>
      <li>Seems to be working on her teeth, but it would be nice if it were a little more mild in the minty department.</li>
      <li>My girls love this toothpaste and we were not able to find it in stores--so glad to find it here!</li>
      <li>Mint is too strong for 5-6y old.</li>
      <li>This toothpaste is great transition from the bubble gum/fruity flavors for small children, into the minty adult flavors.</li>
      <li>My daughter is very picky about toothpaste.  </li>
      <li>My daughter has to use this - the dentist wants her to use it to keep her deep molars clean.  </li>
      <li>Impossible for us to find in Target (even though we first purchased there).&lt;br /&gt;Overpriced at Walgreens.&lt;br /&gt;This is the best deal for this, and our 4 year old loves it.  </li>
      <li>I thought this would have more of a fruity, or less burning mint, taste being for young kids.</li>
      <li>This is our new go to paste for my three children under 10.</li>
      <li>my 7 year old loves this toothpaste because it&#x27;s not &#x27;baby&#x27; toothpaste</li>
      <li>and it doesn&#x27;t &#x27;burn&#x27; like adult toothpaste.</li>
      <li>My 5 1/2 year old likes minty toothpaste</li>
      <li>Thought my boys (17 and 14 yrs old) might like it instead.</li>
      <li>She doesnt like using sparkle toothpaste anymore and adult toothpaste is too &#x27;spicy&#x27;.</li>
      <li>It is minty but without the &amp;#34;bite&amp;#34; of adult toothpaste.  </li>
      <li>Finally there&#x27;s a toothpaste that my son doesn&#x27;t complain about being too &amp;#34;spicy!&amp;#34; I was first introduced to this product by son&#x27;s dentist, but couldn&#x27;t find it in my local stores.</li>
      <li>Might as well buy regular Crest as far as flavor.</li>
      <li>They never liked the sweet flavored kids toothpastes.</li>
      <li>But it&#x27;s minty enough to at least smell clean.</li>
      <li>This toothpaste is high quality to help me reduce cavity and other issues.</li>

<ol>
    <li> Mint is too strong for 5-6y old.</li>
    <li> Seems no one locally carries this product anymore...sup rising after the ad am sign put forth and the quality of the product.  Glad to find it here!</li>
    <li> Contains plastic beads (polyetheylene)...what is the point of that???</li>
    <li> VERY GOOD WORKS WELL FOR A BASIC TOOTHPASTE I CAN&#x27;T USE WHITING/TATAR CONTROL</li>
    <li> Love this tooth paste.</li>
    <li> Impossible for us to find in Target (even though we first purchased there).&lt;br /&gt;Overpriced at Walgreens.&lt;br /&gt;This is the best deal for this, and our 4 year old loves it.  She doesn&#x27;t like funky berry flavored toothpaste.  This is the best kids mint toothpaste we&#x27;ve found.</li>
    <li> Smells really good and my kids like it</li>
    <li> My kids love this toothpaste, its not too minty! But it&#x27;s minty enough to at least smell clean.</li>
    <li> This toothpaste is high quality to help me reduce cavity and other issues. After each clean, the toothpaste leave a fresh smelling in mouth, which brings confidence. This is a 5-star purchase on Amazon.com.</li>
    <li> This is one of the worst toothpaste for kids. I seriously don&#x27;t know what the product team was thinking while making this toothpaste for kids. I wouldn&#x27;t buy it for kids.</li>
    <li> And I have. My 5 1/2 year old likes minty toothpaste so getting one that has mint that isn&#x27;t too strong was important. I used this when I ran out of my own paste, and I really liked it.</li>
    <li> I LOVE that Crest has come out with a new toothpaste to help kids bridge from fruity flavored toothpaste to a more minty variety.  My kids claim it&#x27;s still &amp;#34;too hot&amp;#34; for their mouths, but they have gradually made the switch and don&#x27;t notice it any more.  It is minty but without the &amp;#34;bite&amp;#34; of adult toothpaste.  This is our new go to paste for my three children under 10.</li>
    <li> Finally there&#x27;s a toothpaste that my son doesn&#x27;t complain about being too &amp;#34;spicy!&amp;#34; I was first introduced to this product by son&#x27;s dentist, but couldn&#x27;t find it in my local stores. Thankfully, Amazon carried it so I signed up for the automatic delivery. Now I don&#x27;t have to concern myself with tracking it down locally.</li>
    <li> Recommended by my dentist</li>
    <li> Good transition toothpaste for a tween.  Not too minty but definitely not fruity.</li>
    <li> nuff said, hard to get them to bush at all, the fact that they want to because they like the taste / smell.</li>
    <li> I buy this for my kids. They like mint flavored toothpaste, but most of them are &amp;#34;too minty&amp;#34; and give the kids a burning feeling in their mouths. They never liked the sweet flavored kids toothpastes. This one is perfect for them.</li>
    <li> Love it. Great flavor even for adults.</li>
    <li> Our dentist has recommended this product  and my son is very happy using this toothpaste!! It is the best he ever tried.</li>
    <li> Christmas present for someone else.  They were very happy.</li>
    <li> my 7 year old loves this toothpaste because it&#x27;s not &#x27;baby&#x27; toothpaste and it doesn&#x27;t &#x27;burn&#x27; like adult toothpaste. it&#x27;s a great toothpaste!</li>
    <li> My daughter is very picky about toothpaste.  She chose this one years ago and I can only find it online.</li>
    <li> My daughter has to use this - the dentist wants her to use it to keep her deep molars clean.  She doesn&#x27;t like it at all because it&#x27;s so &amp;#34;spicy&amp;#34; but she muddles through.  Seems to be working on her teeth, but it would be nice if it were a little more mild in the minty department.</li>
    <li> My kids (8 and 10) have been washing their teeth with this toothpaste for 1 year and no cavities since then.  It is great for their breath.</li>
    <li> I use the pro health line myself and was happy that it came in a kids brand. My son loved the taste and it keeps his breath fresh</li>
    <li> My daughter loves the taste and that its a great in-between paste for older kids. She doesnt like using sparkle toothpaste anymore and adult toothpaste is too &#x27;spicy&#x27;.</li>
    <li> Please do not use this paste for kids or anyone. It has little non biodegradable plastic beads that that will get trapped in the gum tissue. Please look up polyethylene glycol in tooth paste.</li>
    <li> I tried the toothpaste myself and it seemed ok.  My son prefers Crest Cavity protection Regular Paste.  Apparently it is not &amp;#34;spicy&amp;#34;.  That&#x27;s the one I should have ordered.  Next time I will.</li>
    <li> This toothpaste is great transition from the bubble gum/fruity flavors for small children, into the minty adult flavors. Subscribe and Save is great!</li>
    <li> I thought this would have more of a fruity, or less burning mint, taste being for young kids. Not so. Might as well buy regular Crest as far as flavor. I have sores in my mouth (due to radiation therapy) and need a fruity or bubblegum flavor so it doesn&#x27;t burn. Thought my boys (17 and 14 yrs old) might like it instead. No, they prefer regular Crest or Sensodyne.</li>
    <li> My kids love the taste and it gives them a grown up toothpaste quality, look and feel.</li>
    <li> My girls love this toothpaste and we were not able to find it in stores--so glad to find it here!</li>
