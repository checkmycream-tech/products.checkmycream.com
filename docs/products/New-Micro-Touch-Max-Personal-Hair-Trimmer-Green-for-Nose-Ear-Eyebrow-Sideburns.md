      <li>Not as good on thicker hairs like facial</li>
      <li>As a long time consumer with Amazon, I was kind of surprised that you even sold this kind of China junk on your web site.</li>
      <li>GREAT TRIMMING WASTED CASH</li>
      <li>Oh the light really doesn&#x27;t work.</li>
      <li>This ones the cheapest of the lot and the LED is useful at times.  </li>

      <li>The blades didn&#x27;t work right, Trash.</li>

      <li>You have to have it turned just right to clip away hairs.  </li>

      <li>I tried it when I first got it</li>
      <li>This product worked pretty well for about 2 Months.....</li>
      <li>The product wasn&#x27;t good to use and it was a waste of money.</li>
      <li>it is good beat not strong</li>
      <li>Do yourself a favor and ignore the positive reviews.  </li>
      <li>Meaning they pretty much have the advantage over the consumer.</li>
      <li>My only criticism is that it initially worked and I was very satisfied  with the product.  </li>
      <li>Excellent product, I like this better than previous versions and will continue to purchase future versions as it does last very long from a quality standpoint</li>
      <li>which I very highly recommend.</li>
      <li>It Was Much Quicker And Cleaner.</li>
      <li>Very helpful.</li>
      <li>Very flimsy.  </li>
      <li>It cuts and trims in places much needed.</li>
      <li>I did receive it much quicker than estimated</li>
      <li>once I applied it on my facial, chin, and neck area, the blade cutters wouldn&#x27;t cut my hairs automatically or precisely.</li>
      <li>like i really really like</li>
      <li>mine has not broken, fallen apart, or gotten \\&quot;jammed\\&quot;.  </li>
      <li>This was so cheap, broke second use.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Fell apart after a few uses.</li>
    <li> Very nice comes with extra combs for different trimming.  We would definitely recommend.  It is great for small  trims  very light weight.</li>
    <li> Poorly made does not work all that well.</li>
    <li> Received it in the mail about a month after I ordered it, and it didn&#x27;t work. The blades didn&#x27;t work right, Trash.</li>
    <li> It broke after 3 uses. what a piece of junk. Should have known, it was shipped from China- with no packaging!.&lt;br /&gt;DO NOT BUY</li>
    <li> I tried it thinking it was more, but I first turned it on and it fell apart into many pieces.</li>
    <li> very flimsy  very weak come apart easily don&#x27;t buy this product</li>
    <li> This was so cheap, broke second use.</li>
    <li> was ok but a tad ungainly</li>
    <li> The light doesn&#x27;t work</li>
    <li> It was made very cheaply. I bought 2 and when I went to put the battery in each one they made a click sound and when I turned them on they came on for a second and wouldn&#x27;t turn back on.</li>
    <li> Not what I expected.  Brett Favre clearly is using a different product on TV.</li>
    <li> Thanks it is good and fits good</li>
    <li> Worse excuse for trimmer ever!  Barely has enough power to even run.  Cheaply made and poorly assembled.  I found Amazon vendor for my former long lasting quality trimmer the [[ASIN:B002FS4VJQ Wahl 5545-400 Wahl Ear Nose &amp; Brow - 3 In 1 Trimmer]] which I very highly recommend.</li>
    <li> I recently ordered the Micro Touch Max Trimmer, because my old one became obsolete. When my old Micro Touch Max Trimmer became obsolete, I ordered a new one, but I had the same problem with the new one. With this product, I had put it on the \\&quot;ON\\&quot; setting and it worked, including the light, but once I applied it on my facial, chin, and neck area, the blade cutters wouldn&#x27;t cut my hairs automatically or precisely. The product wasn&#x27;t good to use and it was a waste of money. Plus, the product is a little cheap and it&#x27;s not durable enough. I definitely don&#x27;t recommend this product to anyone!</li>
    <li> I picked up the blue version of the Micro Touch at Walgreen&#x27;s in the \\&quot;As Seen on TV\\&quot; section. It did work in an excellent manner the first few dozen times that I used it to neatly trim my nose and ears. Eventually it just quit working, although the light still lit, the blades would not go. Then I added a few drops of gun oil to the blade mechanism and now it works like new!</li>
    <li> Perfect little product.  It works and it&#x27;s easy to use.</li>
    <li> Worst product that I have ever bought.  Was extremely disappointed.  Would not recommend for you to even consider this one.</li>
    <li> Simply good. It&#x27;s the only product that doesn&#x27;t irritate my skin</li>
    <li> It is so easy to use. A very good product for anyone.</li>
    <li> Gives a new definition to cheap. BLade was not working upon receipt. This went right to the trash. Yes yes</li>
    <li> TOO FRAGILE. WORKS GREAT TRIMMING WASTED CASH ON TWO</li>
    <li> Does the job.  There are better ones out there that cost more and there are worse ones out there too.  These seem to do the job fine.  The price was right and they serve their purpose.  You will not get a close shave with these trimmers so if that is what you are looking for, look elsewhere.</li>
    <li> The item was useful as it was advertised and why the light if your using it the light is useless.</li>
    <li> What a piece of junk!!!!! Did eybrows once and when I tried trimming hairs in nose, it froze up and could not get to work after that.  Immediately through in the garbage.  Don&#x27;t go near this!</li>
    <li> people here complaining it \\&quot;jams up\\&quot;... cannot imagine what kind of hair you are cutting.  have had this now for six months works like a top.  mine has not broken, fallen apart, or gotten \\&quot;jammed\\&quot;.  last i checked it was made for cutting nose hair, not shaving the dog.  mine has worked exactly like it says it should work, and after six months of twice a week use, i have only replaced the battery Once.  to me, that&#x27;s pretty damn hard to beat for only $7.99 (which is all i paid for mine).</li>
    <li> i have bought electric nose trimmers and razors&lt;br /&gt;they dont work for christ sake&lt;br /&gt;use old fashioned scissors. they work the best even though a little more effort</li>
    <li> THEY ARE JUST NOT GOOD FOR ME ...NEVER HAVE ANY LUCK...THEY ARE VERY WEAK AND OR DON&#x27;T WORK AT ALL!!</li>
    <li> just a little easier than a razor</li>
    <li> It runs on a AAA battery.  Has minimal power to cut anything.  And is made from brittle plastic.  Do yourself a favor and ignore the positive reviews.  Spend your money elsewhere.  Mine is already in the trash and it arrived yesterday.</li>
    <li> The trimmer is difficult to take apart to clean &amp; it&#x27;s difficult to put back together. It&#x27;s difficult to remove &amp; replace the battery cover. The marks on the battery cover don&#x27;t line up. However, it does do a great job of trimming. The Micro Touch produced before this one, I liked a lot better.</li>
    <li> Junk.  Very flimsy.  Powered by single AAA battery which I think also tells a story. I doubt this unit would last more than a few months.  I returned it to Wmart.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had a Norelco like a NT9130 that lasted several years as did the AA battery that came with it.  I will have to find a new one.</li>
    <li> It cuts and trims in places much needed. Nose and ears are now clean. The light helps you with the viewing and it last much tan expected</li>
    <li> Other Trimmers I Have Used Did The Job Of Removing Hair From Ears And Nose But With The Micro Touch Max Personal Trimmer It Was Much Quicker And Cleaner.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t do what it says</li>
    <li> It took over a month to receive it&lt;br /&gt;on top  of that it doesn&#x27;t  even work</li>
    <li> Light does not work at all with product new.  Has hard time making battery connection to make it work.  This is NOT a GOOD product.  They should either FIX the defects or stop selling it.</li>
    <li> Cheap knock off, beware.</li>
    <li> My friend asked me to order it.</li>
    <li> Very good buy, works perfect</li>
    <li> Cheap construction.  Light won&#x27;t work.</li>
    <li> Cheap. Took forever to get here. Does not get as close as I would like and feels like it pulls your hair rather than cut it. Note this is coming from over seas so you can&#x27;t track your package. Will not order again</li>
    <li> This does the job I bought it for. Its a little big to get way in the nose and ears but with practice you can make it work</li>
    <li> I found it worked fine but slower than I hoped.  You have to have it turned just right to clip away hairs.  And for me the attachments for eye brows did not work very well so I just leave that for my barber.</li>
    <li> i have used other ear and nose trimmers and they dont compare to the micro touch i reccomend this product to anyone who needs it</li>
    <li> Inexpensive, and it works well!</li>
    <li> Great trimmer.  Wish it had a light.</li>
    <li> doesnt trim well. anywhere does not trim very well at all. the blades are not sharp enough and would not recommend this product</li>
    <li> Got this for my hubs as it&#x27;s the only one he will use!!</li>
    <li> Do not recommend due to the fact I&#x27;ve bought 2 and on both blades gets stuck!!! Waste of time and money!!!</li>
    <li> it worked for about 7 seconds and then stopped. do not buy it! total pos.</li>
    <li> Broke after a few uses.</li>
    <li> This product worked pretty well for about 2 Months..... Then completely stopped working.  Not replaceable either.  Spend a few bucks more and get a better one.</li>
    <li> not as smooth as one might think</li>
    <li> JUNK!  does not work as advertised.</li>
    <li> i llike i really like i really really like it ir is waht i WANTED so thank you very much</li>
    <li> The light did not work but for the price I didn&#x27;t care and did not attempt to return it.  The product does what it was designed to do.</li>
    <li> Light does not work. Cheaply made. falls apart easily. Does not work better than your usual hair trimmers. not recommended</li>
    <li> I am looking for a better product</li>
    <li> Now don&#x27;t expect this thing to trim a beard or your special private regions. I will say it&#x27;s perfect for nose hairs and all that bothersome fuzz that grows all over your ears. Also it comes whit guards for eyebrows and that works perfect for mine. If you are worried about what other reviews have said, do what I did. Buy 2 just in case. Oh the light really doesn&#x27;t work. But who the heck shaves in the dark anyway?</li>
    <li> Not as good on thicker hairs like facial and I found it a bit difficult to turn on and off.. (fearful of it breaking) but it&#x27;s a nifty little product that saves time. I did receive it much quicker than estimated so that&#x27;s another plus. Trims eyebrows quite well and thinner hairs comes right off.. The light is silly but I suppose it could be handy for those who trim in the dark (LOL). Overall, not a bad purchase. No regrets..</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t waste your money This is junk . it has almost no power and because of this it will not cut . I would not recommend .</li>
    <li> it doesn&#x27;t trim the hair , its very weak . I tried it when I first got it, I haven&#x27;t touched it since. I&#x27;m glad the price was $8</li>
    <li> On time. Decent product for the price.</li>
    <li> Works ok and trims about good as the competition.  Ugly green.  Directions clearly state not to soak the head in alcohol or anything else.  Just brush clean.  So if its been around a nostril or mouth then used on a healing suture it could lead to problems.  I tried the Wahl and it fell apart on its own.  Tried the wifes Remington and it works okay.  This ones the cheapest of the lot and the LED is useful at times.  Hey it is also the cheapest of the lot.</li>
    <li> This trimmer doesn&#x27;t have a huge amount power, which made trimming difficult. However, after going over it a few times it worked.</li>
    <li> I saw this on TV back in June and thought to myself &amp;#34;I know someone who could use this&amp;#34; Not to sound harsh or anything but a lot of guys are really sensitive about their eyebrowhair and ear hair.  This is an excellent tool to get rid of those embarrassing and annoying wild hairs.  Instead of ripping the superlong eyebrow hairs out, tweezing until your ears and nose are bleeding and raw, try this for a change.  It&#x27;ll even out the length of the hair, trim it down so its not as noticeable and it will also give you the esteem of knowing you don&#x27;t have an eyebrow hair curling down across your eyelashes.  Out of all of the trimmers that I have seen, this one is by far the greatest and it has a built in light.  Highly recommended</li>
    <li> Arrived after a week delay, but works just as advertized.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is a good product for trimming hair from my external auditory canal and nose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;rmt</li>
    <li> My only criticism is that it initially worked and I was very satisfied  with the product.  When I went to use it again, the product didn&#x27;t work even with changing the battery.</li>
    <li> Very helpful. Looks and works as I wanted.</li>
    <li> works well for the price</li>
    <li> Works as advertised.  Pleased with the product and how it is to be used.  Easy to clean and the attachments work well.</li>
    <li> if there was a contest for a trimmer with absolutely lowest quality and design, then this wins. Don&#x27;t buy it. Seems to struggle with power, feels very flimsy, and the on/off button is poorly designed. I am throwing mine in the garbage.</li>
    <li> Excellent product, I like this better than previous versions and will continue to purchase future versions as it does last very long from a quality standpoint</li>
    <li> Nose hair grooming got you down? This product will trim down all those hanging nose hairs with ease. Well worth the price of a good appearance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, It works well on ear hair also.</li>
    <li> It is a great product glad i bought it.</li>
    <li> Cheep but gets the job done, the light is nice.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work. If it was free it would be to expensive.</li>
    <li> Priced right and works fine. Pleased!</li>
    <li> Not a good start, had to purchase new battery, as the one enclosed was flat. Attempted to trim nose hair, without success, end of story. Waste of my hard earned cash.</li>
    <li> works good but the battery the came with was dead, does the job just not so powerful</li>
    <li> ok for ear and nose not much good for hair,I was a little disiponted and I dont have to much more to say</li>
    <li> Save your money. Battery ran out in 10 minutes and just plain does not work!</li>
    <li> The quality of the unit was so bad and noisy I sent it back.  Their instructions to return this item read, it might cost you more to return this item than you paid for it. Meaning they pretty much have the advantage over the consumer. As a long time consumer with Amazon, I was kind of surprised that you even sold this kind of China junk on your web site.</li>
    <li> My husband is handicapped and I can&#x27;t get him to the hair cutters as often as he needs and  this does the touch ups in between hair cuts-</li>
    <li> the Item does not work, put in new batteries and still know good. Would not recommend this Item.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t turn on, once you get it turned on, it doesn&#x27;t turn off. Feels cheap, fell apart a bit. Not a good product.</li>
    <li> Worked for a few weeks then just died.  Never dropped or mishandled. Tried changing batteries, obviously, didn&#x27;t do anything.  Avoid, just spend a few more bucks and get something nicer and more reliable.</li>
    <li> DID NOT KNOW IT ARRIVE FROM JAPAN.IT&#x27;S A DISPOSABLE PRODUCT.DOS THE JOB. LIKE TO BUY AMERICAN MADE PRODUCTS.</li>
    <li> works well, would purchase again.</li>
    <li> This product doesn&#x27;t cut as closely as I expected. It did not come with the battery which says is included. The seller said he would credit my credit card with the amount of a battery but this never happened.</li>
    <li> Nice trimmer, can not beat the price for this item.</li>
    <li> it is good beat not strong</li>
    <li> Gave this to my friend. He said he likes it.</li>
    <li> a little flimsier than I thought it doesn t trim my ebrows as easy as I thought it would.</li>
    <li> It definitely does a good job with maintaining your hair in order between your barber visits:).  It&#x27;s not too sharp so you would not be able to injure yourself.</li>
    <li> This product is a complete waste of money. Does not trim anything the way it says it will, probably because of its weak motor, then will completely stop working a few uses in. Stay away!</li>
