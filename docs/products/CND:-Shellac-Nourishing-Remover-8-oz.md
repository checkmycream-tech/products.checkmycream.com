<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Love this nail polish remover, never had any issues with it. Takes off the CND polish easily as long as regular polish.</li>
    <li> This remover does exactly what it says.  None drying, smells like bananas and takes The CND Shellac off within minutes.  By the time I finish applying this product and wrapping all 10 fingers with aluminum foil this first nail is has completed the process.  The shellac comes off quickly and smoothly while I twist the foil off the nail.  I wouldn&#x27;t use shellac without this product.  A must have and your clients will thank you for a speedy, non-drying, no filing removal!</li>
    <li> Have been using this for a few years. Takes less remover to remove polish than I have ever found. Love it.</li>
    <li> Oddly, this product seemed lower in acetone than other polish removers.  If you use shellac, as I do, this can be a problem.</li>
    <li> Total waste of money. I tried to use this nail polish remover but it didn&#x27;t work. I  had to peel off my nail polish. If you are thinking of buying this, please look for a better product.</li>
    <li> I recently bought this to remove my Vinylux nail polish. My old remover wasn&#x27;t good at removing the polish without a little elbow grease. This took it off with a few wipes. Great product.</li>
    <li> I had a CND Shellac manicure and it lasted the usual 12-14 days before it started to peel on the edges. I used this as directed and used the foil to speed up the process and it worked great. Took roughly 10 mins and it came off easy. I didn&#x27;t use a stick like most. I used my cuticle pusher---the scoop side and it seemed gentler. Enjoy. Also use this for glitter polish. Comes off like a charm</li>
    <li> This probably works well for some people.  I had a problem with it not taking off the Shellac like I thought it should (I followed the directions) and wound up taking too much of my nail off.  3 weeks later, I am still healing my nails up.</li>
    <li> Works fast and truly the smell is n ot too strong. I stick to using everything from CND for my shellac and my nails are in perfect condition. My shellac always lasts +2 weeks.</li>
    <li> I expected this to work better than ordinary drug store polish remover. While it works, it&#x27;s definitely not better, and I&#x27;m not certain it&#x27;s as fast. I won&#x27;t repurchase. Not worth a higher price, plain and simple.</li>
    <li> This is the most incredible product. Not only does it remove the shellac quickly and thoroughly, it moisturizes my nails at the same time. I&#x27;m a fan!</li>
    <li> I love using this polish remover whether using shellac or regular nail polish.  It is so easy to use and so quick.</li>
    <li> Just hundreds times better than regular nail polish remover if you use it to remove shellac! I use CND pads also which I love too. But first I tried to remove shellac with nail polish remover on those pads. It&#x27;s just no comparison to the CND Shellac Power Polish Remover.&lt;br /&gt;Also I have very sensitive skin and when I was wrapping my nails with the other product, it was so hard to leave it on for 10 minutes for me, I felt like my skin was burning. But with this CND product I feel nothing! It also smells nice.&lt;br /&gt;And I&#x27;m not a professional, just like to do my nails myself at home and love to use all CND products for it. I did try different products though and nothing beats CND for me.</li>
    <li> I love this remover.  It takes gel and vinyl polish off with just a swipe.</li>
    <li> Arrived on time.  Works well with CND remover foils.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m not really a fan.  For the cost regular nail polish works just as well I think.</li>
    <li> Just  soaked the shellac nail polish right off as directed. Worked great but spilled some on my old comforter and it stained (should not have been doing it in bed I know).</li>
    <li> Now I can remove the nail polish before going to the manicure and save time and give some time to my nails to breathe. I knew that it was a good one already, as it is the one my manicure uses.</li>
    <li> This is quicker than straight acetone and I hear better for your hands. Will definitely reorder.</li>
    <li> Probably the only product that will remove the shellac polish. It took a long time though.</li>
    <li> Does what it&#x27;s supposed to do.</li>
    <li> Removes their brand of Polish very easily.</li>
    <li> It wired fine. Nice to do at home.</li>
