### Positive Reviews

<ol>
      <li>Great price, too!</li>
      <li>Excellent grooming tool!!</li>
      <li>I should have returned it because the shave it gave wasn&#x27;t very good either.</li>
      <li>Great product.  </li>
      <li>Works great, good value</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s good</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m very satisfied with the way it works.</li>
      <li>So glad to find it!</li>
      <li>Would be nice if it came with a case.  </li>
      <li>Very satisfied customer:)</li>
      <li>Trimmer head doesn&#x27;t work well as you must go over area many times to trim.  </li>
      <li>I love the fact it&#x27;s rechargeable rather than batteries</li>
      <li>Love the color I chose.</li>
      <li>Even when the trimmer was working, it was not the most comfortable trimmer I have used.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s the only good quality mini-shaver I&#x27;ve ever found in any store!</li>
      <li>Bought this as a personal shaver and was happy to see how sturdy it was made.</li>
      <li>haven&#x27;t had a chance to try, but was really excited to.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s worth it!</li>
      <li>This is a really good product to use, especially for those who are senistive to getting razor bumps.</li>
      <li>:) This little thing has become a good friend.</li>
      <li>It does a clean job quickly and efficiently, is very easy to use and stores nicely in its little charger on the bathroom shelf.</li>
      <li>Broke really quickly.</li>
      <li>It closely cuts hair in intimate spots leaivng the skin smooth to the touch.</li>
      <li>The only nice thing about it is its sleek design and color.  </li>
      <li>makes it more powerful than my old one that used AA batteries.</li>
      <li>Product arrived in a timely fashion, however, I was expecting a far better product from a name brand like Wahl.  </li>
      <li>It&#x27;s fine for trimming I think, but if you want to use the other attachment for closer trimming on the bikini line, the hand-held clio electric shaver did a better job AND that one is good dry/wet use.</li>
      <li>This was shipped very fast.</li>
      <li>Exactly what I was looking for to use between eyebrow waxings.</li>
      <li>Haven&#x27;t used all of the different blades yet, but am satisfied with the ones that I have.</li>
      <li>The person who packaged it shouldn&#x27;t have sent it in the first place.</li>
      <li>I only was able to use it twice before it clonked out.</li>
      <li>Easy to hold and has many parts; except one item was left out -- a narrow rectangular shape to the right of the unit.</li>
      <li>I really like it and highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>Handle was completely shattered.</li>
      <li>nice shave for the bikini line and not harsh on skin other attachment not really useful for my personal need</li>
      <li>Wahl products are usually high quality, but it should&#x27;ve been obvious for the price not to bother.</li>
      <li>This personal groomer works very well for facial hair, bikini cuts, underarms...</li>
      <li>Although so far i like it a lot and the different types of heads it has.</li>
      <li>The blades on this groomer barely cut.  </li>
      <li>Outside of the packaging (which is a little like trying to open a pizza) the product itself is quite user friendly.</li>
      <li>A disappointment from such a good brand like Wahl.</li>
      <li>This is a neat little shaver and very well made.</li>

<li> A disappointment from such a good brand like Wahl.</li>
<li> This is a neat little shaver and very well made.</li>
<li> Doesn&#x27;t shave as close as I&#x27;d hoped, but it gets the job done and seems like it will last a long while.</li>
<li> When fully charged, vacillates between high and low power--meaning it &amp;#34;surges.&amp;#34;  Not very safe!  </li>
<li> I had high hopes for this trimmer as I have purchased Wahl products in the past.  </li>
<li> It works OK but catches on the hair which makes it very uncomfortable</li>
<li> Not at all what I expected.</li>
<li> Blades stay sharp a long time and it comes with a little oil and brush.</li>
<li> Also, cutting length options are much too short for my tastes.  </li>
<li> Started breaking down by the 5th use.</li>
<li> After less than 9 months, the trimmer just stopped working.  </li>
<li> This razor will do the trick, but if you have coarse thick hair (like me!)</li>
<li> No blades to change because not used everyday -- once a month.</li>
<li> This was a waste of money.</li>
<li> Don&#x27;t waste your time and money.</li>
<li> I am going to send it back in hopes of getting one that isn&#x27;t broken.</li>
<li> Don&#x27;t waste your money on this.</li>
<li> Poor product, not worth the cost.</li>
<li> Big disappointment</li>
<li> bought this item to shave hair in delicate places.  </li>
<li> Only disappointed in the closeness of the shave.</li>
<li> Pretty terrible.</li>
<li> than you may be a little disappointed as it will leave a little stubble behind.</li>
<li> Attachments were bent and broken.</li>
<li> DON&#x27;T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!!</li>
<li> this piece of crap stopped working a little over a month after I purchased it.</li>
<li> The shaver is totally useless.</li>
<li> I thought it just needed a charge, but unfortunately that was not the case.  </li>
<li> It&#x27;s clearly useless.</li>
<li> but it is a bit difficult for a beginner.</li>
<li> Piece of crap.</li>
<li> Very disappointed in  this product I purchased from Amazon.  </li>
<li> it&#x27;s a piece of crap!!!</li>

    <li> This is a really good product to use, especially for those who are senistive to getting razor bumps. It closely cuts hair in intimate spots leaivng the skin smooth to the touch.</li>
    <li> Outside of the packaging (which is a little like trying to open a pizza) the product itself is quite user friendly. It does a clean job quickly and efficiently, is very easy to use and stores nicely in its little charger on the bathroom shelf. It doesn&#x27;t overheat, doesn&#x27;t cut or burn, just buzzes away all that unwanted hair wherever it may hide. :) This little thing has become a good friend.</li>
    <li> This worked for almost a year before it totally just gave out. It was only used a handful of times too. A disappointment from such a good brand like Wahl.</li>
    <li> Bought this as a personal shaver and was happy to see how sturdy it was made. Doesn&#x27;t shave as close as I&#x27;d hoped, but it gets the job done and seems like it will last a long while.</li>
    <li> Wahl products are usually high quality, but it should&#x27;ve been obvious for the price not to bother. It&#x27;s fine for trimming I think, but if you want to use the other attachment for closer trimming on the bikini line, the hand-held clio electric shaver did a better job AND that one is good dry/wet use. Parts are chintzy. I like that it&#x27;s rechargeable and it was shipped promptly. Buy it for trimming not a closer shave ...</li>
    <li> Very disappointed in  this product I purchased from Amazon.  Product arrived in a timely fashion, however, I was expecting a far better product from a name brand like Wahl.  Trimmer head doesn&#x27;t work well as you must go over area many times to trim.  Detailing head does not work at all.</li>
    <li> Easy to hold and has many parts; except one item was left out -- a narrow rectangular shape to the right of the unit. Love the color I chose. No blades to change because not used everyday -- once a month. Great price, too!</li>
    <li> Does not hold charge well.  When fully charged, vacillates between high and low power--meaning it &amp;#34;surges.&amp;#34;  Not very safe!  Would be nice if it came with a case.  Also, cutting length options are much too short for my tastes.  Poor product, not worth the cost.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s good i like it but it is a bit difficult for a beginner. Although so far i like it a lot and the different types of heads it has.</li>
    <li> This razor will do the trick, but if you have coarse thick hair (like me!) than you may be a little disappointed as it will leave a little stubble behind.</li>
    <li> Not at all what I expected. Doesn&#x27;t work like it&#x27;s supposed to.</li>
    <li> this piece of crap stopped working a little over a month after I purchased it. I should have returned it because the shave it gave wasn&#x27;t very good either. Don&#x27;t spend a dime on this product it&#x27;s a piece of crap!!! I couldn&#x27;t even return it because they said after 30 days I couldn&#x27;t get a replacement. Of course I stopped working on day 40. DON&#x27;T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!!</li>
    <li> This is a neat little shaver and very well made. It works on battery or plug in. It&#x27;s the only good quality mini-shaver I&#x27;ve ever found in any store! Blades stay sharp a long time and it comes with a little oil and brush. It&#x27;s worth it!</li>
    <li> it rusted and broke after 1 use.  I dropped one of the attachments and it instantly broke into pieces.  Pretty terrible.</li>
    <li> Handle was completely shattered. Packaging was ripped, dented, and chewed. Attachments were bent and broken. Looked like a dog got a hold of it. Looked like it had been cut open and run over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#x27;t had a chance to try, but was really excited to. The person who packaged it shouldn&#x27;t have sent it in the first place. It&#x27;s clearly useless. I am going to send it back in hopes of getting one that isn&#x27;t broken.</li>
    <li> I had high hopes for this trimmer as I have purchased Wahl products in the past.  After less than 9 months, the trimmer just stopped working.  I thought it just needed a charge, but unfortunately that was not the case.  I followed all of the care/cleaning instructions and only used the trimmer about 15 times.  Even when the trimmer was working, it was not the most comfortable trimmer I have used.  Big disappointment, I would not recommend this product.</li>
    <li> This was shipped very fast. I&#x27;m very satisfied with the way it works. I like the extra attachments and the rechargeable battery makes it more powerful than my old one that used AA batteries.</li>
    <li> Great product.  Looking for one of these for a while.  So glad to find it!</li>
    <li> I only was able to use it twice before it clonked out. It just wont work. Even when you try to use it plugged up, the motor just will not turn. This was a waste of money. I do not recommend ordering this grooming kit.</li>
    <li> Like the way it works</li>
    <li> Piece of crap. Started breaking down by the 5th use. Don&#x27;t waste your time and money.</li>
    <li> Only disappointed in the closeness of the shave.</li>
    <li> bought this item to shave hair in delicate places.  It works OK but catches on the hair which makes it very uncomfortable</li>
    <li> Broke really quickly.</li>
    <li> Exactly what I was looking for to use between eyebrow waxings. I love the fact it&#x27;s rechargeable rather than batteries so I&#x27;m. It scrambling to look for batteries when it&#x27;s low on power.</li>
    <li> The blades on this groomer barely cut.  The shaver is totally useless. The only nice thing about it is its sleek design and color.  Don&#x27;t waste your money on this.</li>
    <li> Works great, good value</li>
    <li> Like the grooming kit, as it&#x27;s heads are smaller for a woman&#x27;s needs.  Haven&#x27;t used all of the different blades yet, but am satisfied with the ones that I have.</li>
    <li> Works well for my wife&#x27;s needs</li>
    <li> Excellent grooming tool!!</li>
    <li> This personal groomer works very well for facial hair, bikini cuts, underarms...it does a nice job without cutting into your skin. I really like it and highly recommend it. Very satisfied customer:)</li>
    <li> nice shave for the bikini line and not harsh on skin other attachment not really useful for my personal need</li>
