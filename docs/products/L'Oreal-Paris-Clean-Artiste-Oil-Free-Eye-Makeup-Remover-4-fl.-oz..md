      <li>The Loreal makeup remover does a great job on mascara.  </li>
      <li>Works great for non waterproof mascara.  </li>
      <li>I found that for me it works best to remove most of mascara with water, then use Q-tips dipped in the remover to get the rest of makeup</li>

      <li>I love this product because it is truly non-greasy.  </li>
      <li>ok, I did not care for it.</li>
      <li>Love it.</li>
      <li>I was pleased to find it here on Amazon with a comparable price.  </li>
      <li>Works better than just soap and water</li>
      <li>LOVE this stuff, have used it for many, many years.</li>
      <li>I have used this for years and love it.  </li>
      <li>Lancome, this is by far the best and most reasonably priced.  </li>
      <li>you can&#x27;t soak a cotton ball easily.</li>
      <li>It does not come off easily.</li>
      <li>This makeup remover works great on a regular makeup, smells great, and leaves my eyelids feel soft and hydrated.</li>
      <li>Hands down, the best eye make-up remover.  </li>
      <li>This works fine for removing eye makeup.  </li>
      <li>It works fine for removal of makeup on the face, but as others have pointed out, it stings your eyes.</li>
      <li>I decided to buy this because it stated that it is oil free.</li>
      <li>I loved it so much before but it really disappoints me this time.</li>
      <li>The Asian version one is really great and really suitable for sensitive eyes.</li>
      <li>I normally buy Neutrogena&#x27;s Oil Free Makeup Remover (which I love)</li>
      <li>This make up remover is very gentle that won&#x27;t hurt your skin, and it could remove easily.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve tried other brands and this is by far the best.  </li>
      <li>I am usually not a very negative person and don&#x27;t go out of my way to badmouth things unless they really bother me, but I do believe this is one kind of makeup product where you really get what you pay for!  </li>
      <li>It doesn&#x27;t irritate our sensitive eyes, which is oh, so important!</li>
      <li>So the pain you will have from stinging eyes is not even worth it.</li>
      <li>None oily, removes makeup quickly and gently.</li>
      <li>, it is for that purpose exactly.</li>
      <li>- my eyes stung every time I used this product, and I felt like it didn&#x27;t really effectively remove all of my makeup, anyway - not like other products I&#x27;ve used.  </li>
      <li>Will certainly return.</li>
      <li>Well, this certainly wasn&#x27;t it</li>
      <li>Eye makeup comes off cleanly and even if I&#x27;m not particularly careful it doesn&#x27;t seem to sting my eyes.</li>
      <li>Doesn&#x27;t work very well</li>
      <li>If I wasn&#x27;t working soo much</li>
      <li>I am very unsatisfied with this purchase.</li>
      <li>Luckily hot soapy water got rid of the burn, but I will definitely not be buying this again, so glad they took it back.</li>
      <li>I usually buy Neutrogena&#x27;s oil free makeup remover (which I love) but they ran out of it at my local Target!</li>
      <li>Well i normally on the weekends wear makeup which isnt allowed on school grounds</li>
      <li>NEVER again will I trust anything else other than my trusty Neutrogena&#x27;s Oil Free Makeup Remover.</li>
      <li>It was sold as a new item but didn&#x27;t come with factory seal.</li>
      <li>I have in the past been so broke that I bought a very cheap generic-brand product, and</li>
      <li>It takes several uses just take off the first layer of mascara.</li>
      <li>My favorite eye makeup remover - hard to find in stores...</li>
      <li>developed itchy skin around my eye area and a bit of a rash.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
      <li>So it says it for sensitive skin....</li>
      <li>but I still buy it religiously and sometimes two at a time because it&#x27;s always sold out or very nearly in the stores.  </li>
      <li>It really helped what I expected,</li>
      <li>As far as its intended use, I don&#x27;t use it as such.</li>
      <li>I feel that this L&#x27;Oreal product (usually a pretty strong makeup line) was equally bad, if not worse.  </li>
      <li>But you have to be careful when you use it, it&#x27;s easy to over pour due to the wide bottle.</li>
      <li>Not only does it NOT remove make up, it really burns my eyes (and other friends that have tried it).</li>
      <li>I usually buy Neutrogena Eye Makeup Remover which works really well, but Amazon no longer offers it through subscribe and save, so they suggested this product instead.  </li>

<li> This was a complete waste of money.</li>
<li> Compared to some others, the long wearing lipstick is a tougher job for this remover to tackle.</li>
<li> I am not sensitive to products usually and have used other makeup removers with no negative effects.  </li>
<li> Also the opening is too wide...</li>
<li> It does not leave my eyes oily unlike almost every other product I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
<li> This does not remove all my eye makeup with one application and other brands have.  </li>
<li> and I swear i have to go over it multiple times with a cotton swap while pressing firmly just to get a little bit of eye-liner off.</li>
<li> Love the product hate the price.</li>
<li> Apparently the secret is out.</li>
<li> does not clean up all the mascara as you would expect.</li>
<li> But I am messy at putting mascara on, and this can take off the extra traces without leaving any mess behind.  </li>
<li> you are looking for waterproof makeup remover, this one is not going to work - buy the green bottle instead</li>
<li> I followed the directions and put just a little bit on a cotton pad the wipe off my eye makeup and holy fire batman!</li>
<li> but it dried the delicate skin around my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;I</li>
<li> I usually use Almay</li>
<li> i was scrubbing my eyes for at least 15 minutes and woke up with swollen eyes</li>
<li> (yes, they were closed, I&#x27;m not an idiot) and my skin turned red and itched.</li>
<li> Not oily, not drying...kind of ridiculously priced for what it is probably</li>
<li> Maybe my mascara is too ... tough for this stuff, but it hardly removed eye makeup let alone mascara.&lt;br</li>
<li> I have used this for years and was disappointed that my local Target stopped carrying it.  </li>
<li> Have friends who&#x27;ve become addicted to it as well.</li>
<li> I feel really uncomfortable after I used it for my eyes.</li>
<li> the Neutrogena make up remover. :(</li>
<li> I would go to Walmart and purchase myself, this is just convenient and I paid almost twice the amount for this that I would have paid in Walmart...  :(</li>
<li> Really disappointed.</li>
<li> Don&#x27;t bother with this, it&#x27;s crap.</li>
<li> I hate the oily removers and this one is not oily at all..</li>
<li> Very disappointed and will not buy again.</li>
<li> but it was the worst thing ever to take off</li>
<li> This is the worst I make up remover</li>
<li> This remover is HORRIBLE!</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> Like the product! Have used it for several years</li>
    <li> I love this product. I&#x27;ve been using it for years and I&#x27;m convinced it helps my eyelashes to grow faster. Non-greasy and so cheap! Love it.</li>
    <li> This make up remover is very gentle that won&#x27;t hurt your skin, and it could remove easily. But you have to be careful when you use it, it&#x27;s easy to over pour due to the wide bottle.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work well at all!</li>
    <li> Love the product hate the price. If I wasn&#x27;t working soo much I would go to Walmart and purchase myself, this is just convenient and I paid almost twice the amount for this that I would have paid in Walmart...  :(</li>
    <li> Having been used to the somewhat pricier Mary Kay eye makeup remover, I wanted to buy something which was cheaper but still a quality product.  Well, this certainly wasn&#x27;t it - my eyes stung every time I used this product, and I felt like it didn&#x27;t really effectively remove all of my makeup, anyway - not like other products I&#x27;ve used.  I have in the past been so broke that I bought a very cheap generic-brand product, and I feel that this L&#x27;Oreal product (usually a pretty strong makeup line) was equally bad, if not worse.  I am usually not a very negative person and don&#x27;t go out of my way to badmouth things unless they really bother me, but I do believe this is one kind of makeup product where you really get what you pay for!  And I wanted to warn others against wasting their money.</li>
    <li> Great eye makeup remover and does not irritate my eyes and us not oily!</li>
    <li> This does not remove all my eye makeup with one application and other brands have.  Also the opening is too wide... you can&#x27;t soak a cotton ball easily.</li>
    <li> This works fine for removing eye makeup.  Definitely does the job for the money, and doesn&#x27;t leave a greasy or oily residue.</li>
    <li> I like this product because I had difficulty to remove those mascaras that are waterproof. It really helped what I expected,</li>
    <li> This is my favorite makeup remover because it gets all my eye makeup off very easily and it isn&#x27;t oily!!!  Great service from amazon and great product!  No complaints!</li>
    <li> ITEM DID NOT HAVE A FACTORY SEAL.  IT MIGHT BE SOAP WATER FOR ALL I KNOW.  WOULD NOT BUY AGAIN FOR THIS REASON.</li>
    <li> The only eye make up remover I use. Do not stop making it. Works better than just soap and water</li>
    <li> Hands down, the best eye make-up remover.  I have been using this for years.  Works great for non waterproof mascara.  Have tried others and none compare!</li>
    <li> A go to product for me.</li>
    <li> My favorite eye makeup remover - hard to find in stores...</li>
    <li> So it says it for sensitive skin....it&#x27;s not. I followed the directions and put just a little bit on a cotton pad the wipe off my eye makeup and holy fire batman! My eyes burned like I had poured alcohol on them (yes, they were closed, I&#x27;m not an idiot) and my skin turned red and itched. Luckily hot soapy water got rid of the burn, but I will definitely not be buying this again, so glad they took it back.</li>
    <li> As far as its intended use, I don&#x27;t use it as such. It works fine for removal of makeup on the face, but as others have pointed out, it stings your eyes. I don&#x27;t want to feel like I&#x27;m putting visine drops in my eyes just to remove makeup! Also, the claims to be eye makeup remover are seemingly inaccurate because it leaves a lot of mascara residue. So the pain you will have from stinging eyes is not even worth it. I will continue to use the rest of the bottle for makeup corrections only (such as smudged mascara), and will not be purchasing this product again.</li>
    <li> I normally buy Neutrogena&#x27;s Oil Free Makeup Remover (which I love) but I was out of town and the store only had this!  This remover is HORRIBLE! Not only does it NOT remove make up, it really burns my eyes (and other friends that have tried it). I will eat the cost of it and throw away. NEVER again will I trust anything else other than my trusty Neutrogena&#x27;s Oil Free Makeup Remover.</li>
    <li> ok, I did not care for it. does not clean up all the mascara as you would expect. Will not order this again.</li>
    <li> I have been using this eye makeup remover for YEARS!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love it because it is not oily, and does a really good job, doesn&#x27;t burn my eyes either.</li>
    <li> LOVE this stuff, have used it for many, many years. Have friends who&#x27;ve become addicted to it as well. Eye makeup comes off cleanly and even if I&#x27;m not particularly careful it doesn&#x27;t seem to sting my eyes. Not oily, not drying...kind of ridiculously priced for what it is probably but I still buy it religiously and sometimes two at a time because it&#x27;s always sold out or very nearly in the stores.  Apparently the secret is out.</li>
    <li> I love this product because it is truly non-greasy.  It does not leave a film on my face, and it doesn&#x27;t bother me as a contact lens wearer.  I would not recommend this product to get off waterproof makeup.  But I am messy at putting mascara on, and this can take off the extra traces without leaving any mess behind.  I wouldn&#x27;t use anything else.</li>
    <li> The only thing I use to remove my eye make-up! aC</li>
    <li> I have used this for years and love it.  It cleans that mascara and the eye shadow and never irritates my eyes.</li>
    <li> Maybe my mascara is too ... tough for this stuff, but it hardly removed eye makeup let alone mascara.&lt;br /&gt;It does not sting if it gets into your eyes (always a plus) but it dried the delicate skin around my eyes.&lt;br /&gt;I developed itchy skin around my eye area and a bit of a rash.&lt;br /&gt;I passed the bottle onto a friend who had a similar reaction.&lt;br /&gt;This is one product I will not purchase again.</li>
    <li> This makeup remover works great on a regular makeup, smells great, and leaves my eyelids feel soft and hydrated. I found that for me it works best to remove most of mascara with water, then use Q-tips dipped in the remover to get the rest of makeup off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you are looking for waterproof makeup remover, this one is not going to work - buy the green bottle instead, it is for that purpose exactly.</li>
    <li> It was sold as a new item but didn&#x27;t come with factory seal. Please, this is something to be applied to the skin! No factory seal, no use! Will certainly return.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this for years.  I&#x27;ve tried other brands and this is by far the best.  Even compared to the more expensive brands, like it&#x27;s big sister Lancome, this is by far the best and most reasonably priced.  None oily, removes makeup quickly and gently.</li>
    <li> Amazon is asking questions that don&#x27;t apply to this product!  I use this stuff religiously.  Doesn&#x27;t irritate and removes my eye make-up.  It&#x27;s great!</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t work very well</li>
    <li> I am very unsatisfied with this purchase. I usually buy Neutrogena Eye Makeup Remover which works really well, but Amazon no longer offers it through subscribe and save, so they suggested this product instead.  It does not take off my eye makeup AND it burns my eyes. I am not sensitive to products usually and have used other makeup removers with no negative effects.  This was a complete waste of money.</li>
    <li> Both of my teens use this product and I&#x27;m about to switch from my more expensive Mary Kay product. It doesn&#x27;t irritate our sensitive eyes, which is oh, so important! And with Subscribe and Save, the price can&#x27;t be beat!</li>
    <li> DOESNT REMOVE MAKEUP!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Instead of hassling with return I just threw it away!</li>
    <li> I have used this for years and was disappointed that my local Target stopped carrying it.  I was pleased to find it here on Amazon with a comparable price.  It does not leave my eyes oily unlike almost every other product I&#x27;ve tried.</li>
    <li> This is the worst I make up remover I have ever used. I usually use Almay but I thought I would give this a try. It takes several uses just take off the first layer of mascara. It does not come off easily. Very disappointed and will not buy again.</li>
    <li> I usually buy Neutrogena&#x27;s oil free makeup remover (which I love) but they ran out of it at my local Target! I decided to buy this because it stated that it is oil free. This remover does NOT remove make up. It also makes my eyes burn! I am on day 2 using this and I have lost it. I am going to go to CVS or RITE AID to go buy the Neutrogena make up remover. :(</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t bother with this, it&#x27;s crap. Took forever to actually remove my makeup and still didn&#x27;t get it all - and I wasn&#x27;t even using waterproof. If you like the post-crying, smeary, just-woke-up look, this might be for you.</li>
    <li> good !I already bought three times ! It doesn&#x27;t cause my eyes allergy.And no oilly.</li>
    <li> The Loreal makeup remover does a great job on mascara.  Compared to some others, the long wearing lipstick is a tougher job for this remover to tackle.</li>
    <li> Well i normally on the weekends wear makeup which isnt allowed on school grounds but it was the worst thing ever to take off i was scrubbing my eyes for at least 15 minutes and woke up with swollen eyes but no makeup i think its the equivalence to water...</li>
    <li> The Asian version one is really great and really suitable for sensitive eyes. This one is totally different. I feel really uncomfortable after I used it for my eyes. It is not really for sensitive eyes. Really disappointed. I loved it so much before but it really disappoints me this time.</li>
    <li> This is a great make-up remover. I use it all the time. I hate the oily removers and this one is not oily at all..</li>
    <li> Does not work on mascara</li>
    <li> My make-up isn&#x27;t even waterproof and I swear i have to go over it multiple times with a cotton swap while pressing firmly just to get a little bit of eye-liner off. Used to like this but either they changed the formula or somehow it&#x27;s just not working like it used to for me.</li>
    <li> Simply does not remove my make up. No factory seal, either.</li>
</ol>
