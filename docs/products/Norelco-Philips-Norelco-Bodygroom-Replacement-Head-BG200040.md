    <li> Is my 2 time using it and is alredy broken.......  the firs two tiimes worked great not s good quality Sorry😖😖😖😖😖😖😖😖😖😖</li>
    <li> Works like a charm. Two different blades to trim with. No mess and no fuss involved. Have owned this product for numerous years.</li>
    <li> Razor head only as good as the razor.</li>
    <li> For my Braun shaver perfectly.</li>
    <li> Norelco Bodygroom Replacement Head, Norelco Philips probably the BEST electronic razor I&#x27;ve ever owed!. Getting the replacement Heads that&#x27;s where challenge has been. These razors tend to have to be replaced every two months when used twice daily. Amazon had great prices for these heads.</li>
    <li> This does exactly what it should. I think I&#x27;ll get another soon so I have a back-up on-hand. The price is reasonable.</li>
    <li> I bought this because I broke the original blades that came with my shaver. The only problem with it, is that it falls out of the shaver sometimes.</li>
    <li> very good very good very good very good excellent thank you very good very good very good very good excellent thank you very good very good very good very good excellent thank you very good very good very good very good excellent thank you Do explain why you liked or disliked this product.&lt;br /&gt;Do compare to similar products and share how long you&#x27;ve used this product.&lt;br /&gt;Do identify specific attributes (e.g. comfort &amp; fit of a shirt or the battery life of a camera) and whether they met your expectations.&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t describe your seller or shipping experience (you can do that at amazon.com/feedback).&lt;br /&gt;Don&#x27;t include promotional content of any kind or reviews written in exchange for compensation.</li>
    <li> Good performance for the price</li>
    <li> Good razor head replacement! It fits exactly like the original one I had on there. I really don&#x27;t have any complaints about it.</li>
    <li> Trims very good, close and easy</li>
    <li> I like it a lot for buzzing my head every few days. Manufacturer says can be used in the shower. I am reluctant to do so. Water and electronics????</li>
    <li> The only issue is that when shaving it would be falling off pretty often. However it just work fine when isn&#x27;t falling off.</li>
    <li> This product has proven to be the best for my needs</li>
    <li> Good product, great price.</li>
    <li> I was mislead to thing that there were 2 pieces in this purchase by the picture. although i did note that it did not say any where in the written parts the quantity given. I made a mistake and assumed that there would be 2 because of the picture and the higher than average price! I will not make the same mistake again and how you reading this will not either.</li>
    <li> This was a perfect fit.  It works perfectly and was substantially less expensive than the ones in the larger retail stores.  I would purchase again.</li>
    <li> Better then the original. I don&#x27;t know why but it is.</li>
    <li> exactly the same as the blade it replaced, and came in a Phillips Norelco box.  Makes a huge difference.  Should have replaced it months ago.</li>
    <li> So, the replacement head is $28 and the entire body grooming razor is $29?  Shouldn&#x27;t I just buy a new razor??</li>
    <li> works but doesn&#x27;t fit is good as the original blade this place is falls out every once in a while but works</li>
    <li> hey guess what guys.. this thing fit. that&#x27;s about all. its a replacement foil, it fits, it works and it was fairly priced.</li>
    <li> Definitely brought my Bodygroom back to life after owning it for nearly 3 years. Good investment, hopefully they don&#x27;t discontinue it any time soon.</li>
    <li> Great Product Thank You</li>
    <li> i have a 2020 and the head does not lock and pops out making it very hard to shave. this head is suppose to work with the 2020.</li>
    <li> Worked perfectly fine. Almost better material than the original.</li>
    <li> good price and product was as advertised, shipped in a timely manner</li>
    <li> worked great as expected.</li>
    <li> Love this body groomer.  Blade does what it is supposed to.</li>
    <li> Made my shaver feel like new.</li>
    <li> These foils work great.  The only problem is after purchasing a few replacements, you&#x27;ve pretty much equalled the orginal price of the entire razor.  But I guess thats just how it goes.  Great product.</li>
