<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> a gift says it great.</li>
    <li> Overall the products were fine. Out of the 15 there were maybe only four or fine j can see myself using regularly. Some products weren&#x27;t very practical, as I received two or three brown lipsticks and a few neon pink eyeshadows. One product looked old-ish and a few of them broke. It was okay for the price I payed, but would have liked better if I could at least choose a color scheme or had been able to tell her what colors I did and didn&#x27;t want.</li>
    <li> Arrived on-time and as described, all new items, no duplicates.  Thanks!</li>
    <li> I ordered a 21 piece before purchashing this one, I ordered because I LOVED my first package so much. I received this one today and was still very happy, I got the same things as the first but different colors ans some of the exact samw, plus a couple different items. Said I wouldn&#x27;t order again because I didn&#x27;t wanna continue getting the same products... But ordered a 10 piece slightly after sitting the the bathroom playing around with the new and old items.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t get what I thought I was going to. Got nice things, but not real happy with the selection.</li>
    <li> Awesome makeup hands down</li>
    <li> I just received My package today and I love everything! Will be ordering again soon!</li>
    <li> I love the selection of makeup that i got all full sizes too. Packed well and got my package fast too. Awesome i will order again from from this company.</li>
    <li> Its OK especially for the price</li>
    <li> It was fantastic, they took time in putting together a great assortment and everything worked! I definitely reccomend buying.</li>
    <li> Half of the products I got were expired! 3 mascaras that had a clay like consistency had to be thrown away, an eye shadow looked like it had already been opened, and the ugliest nail polish I&#x27;ve ever seen. The other eye shadows were transparent and had to be caked on for the most opaque look. The liquid eye liner was hot pink and also had a bad consistency and wouldn&#x27;t go on smoothly, even if I had ever considered PINK liquid eyeliner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The package was delivered to the wrong building and I was excited to get it from them....and then very, very disappointed. I wish I had never purchased this!</li>
    <li> I ordered and mine is on the way! But letting all future buyers know these items at the store are at LEAST two dollars apiece so regardless this is a steal!</li>
    <li> I LOVED getting this product! It makes it fun not knowing what you are going to get! My fiance bought me this 15 piece Hard Candy set. I was so excited to get it in the mail. It came in 2 days! SO FAST.  When I opened it up, it was better than Christmas! Instead of 15 pieces they sent me 18 pieces!!! Yes, some of them were doubles, but I am okay with that. Its like they picked out everything for me! I got nail polish (2) with rings, tattoos ( yes I’m an adult, and I do temp tattoos), concealer, lipsticks and lip liners, and a bunch of eye stuff. I couldn’t have asked for a better pick of products! I will be ordering the 30 piece next payday!! :) &amp;#60;3</li>
    <li> This is an amazing deal, especially if you&#x27;re a Hard Candy addict, like me. Even if you only got 3 products, it&#x27;s a steal, but I happened to get 17! (I forgot to include the color correctingI love every sinlge item I got, even things I wouldn&#x27;t buThis is an amazing deal, especially if you&#x27;re a Hard Candy addict, like me. Even if you only got 3 products, it&#x27;s a steal, but I happened to get 16!(I forgot to include a color correcting cream in the pic) I love every sinlge item I got, even things I wouldn&#x27;t buy for fear I wouldn&#x27;t like them, but I do!!. I highly recommend!y for fear I wouldn&#x27;t like them, but I do!!. I highly recommend!</li>
    <li> I Love EVERYTHING!! I got. Nice variety of items. Everything was in perfect shape. Sealed and new. It even arrived quicker than I thought. I&#x27;ll be back for more. What an AWESOME deal on Hard Candy makeup. Great Seller! Thank you SO MUCH!!!..:-)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update 6/18/15&lt;br /&gt;I just got my 2nd order and I LOVE IT TOO!. I&#x27;m crazy for lip gloss and nail polish I got 5 glosses, 2 nail polishes, CC cream, 1 Concealer, 5 eyeliners, and 1 Quad eye shadow. So Happy with what I received. I can&#x27;t wait to see what I get next!</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m very satisfied with the assortment! One of the eyeshadow broke but it wasn&#x27;t the sellers fault. I recieved a cc stick, coverup sticks, nail polish, eyeliner, eyeshadow, lipgloss, lip liner, eyeshadow primer, and mascara. Will defiantly buy again!</li>
    <li> I got my things today and was soooooo excited,  I got a bunch of cool things lip gloss, shadows corrective make up I&#x27;m excited I just ordered the 25 piece also and I can&#x27;t wait, this seller is very smart and I&#x27;m sure the business is very lucrative!  Thanks again</li>
    <li> Amazing thank you very helpful! Highly recommended!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Renee (Rivki) Silverberg&lt;br /&gt;Author of Understanding Children and Families with Autism Spectrum Disorders&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;http://www.amazon.com/Understanding-Children-Families-Spectrum-Disorders/dp/1622127269/ref&#x3D;sr_1_1?s&#x3D;books&amp;ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;qid&#x3D;1418769206&amp;sr&#x3D;1-1&amp;keywords&#x3D;understanding+children+and+families+with+autism+spectrum+disorders</li>
    <li> Everything arrived as told,but two lip sticks had been opend not used though.Nice glitter I always need glitter! I really love the lip gloss plexi gloss or something it works great tasty too.</li>
    <li> Nice combo of things!</li>
    <li> I am very very happy with this purchase.  I requested items for my dark complexion and they sent me what I wanted.  Will definitely order this again! Thank you!</li>
    <li> Arrived just in time like expected! I don&#x27;t see the point of some of these negative comments. Clearly it states that you will receive 15 RANDOM products if you are the type of person that like only specific things then don&#x27;t buy the product because it&#x27;s pointless. I love makeup regardless of the color or product. I&#x27;m just the type of person that likes trying new things and I love surprises. So it&#x27;s exactly what I expected. If you&#x27;re a type of person like me then I highly recommend this product. If you want to be picky about what you want then search for those specific items and buy them separately.</li>
    <li> For less than a dollar a piece, I was quite eager to buy a small lot, just out of curiosity. I didn&#x27;t think that I&#x27;d find a use for more than 4 or 5 at best, but as it turns out, I&#x27;m pleased with most and I&#x27;m gonna use them in the future. Just the lipsticks and glosses for example: I got 3 lipsticks in purple, red and nude (that&#x27;s exactly what I usually buy), and the 2 glosses were in some very nice shades of pink.(not too light and washed-out).&lt;br /&gt;On top of that, both the foundation and the concealer I received are in &amp;#34;medium&amp;#34;, yay! (I&#x27;m medium skin). The foundation alone, which is quite good, paid for half of the expense, at least...&lt;br /&gt;I also liked the palette with 4 shades of highlighter, and the eye shadow loose pigments (pink and eggplant shades)&lt;br /&gt;I got 15 of them with no duplicates.</li>
    <li> Didn&#x27;t know the packaging would be so crappy....the eye shadows were completely broken and I had no choice but to throw them away!! If I would have known that they wouldn&#x27;t come in a box with bubble wrap I wouldn&#x27;t have spent the money on it. I basically threw my money in the trash!!</li>
    <li> I Seriously Wish That I Could Have Picked What I Wanted Out Of Everything In The Picture!!&lt;br /&gt;I Got A Bunch Of Lip Gloss, Lipstick, And Other Lip Stuff.&lt;br /&gt;I Am Not A Person That Wears Lip Stuff, Except For Chapstick.&lt;br /&gt;I Am Much More Interested In Eye Makeup, Cover-Up, And Nail Polish.&lt;br /&gt;Plus, Some Of These Things Looked Like They&#x27;ve Been Opened!!</li>
    <li> The package was mostly glitter products. I am not a fan of glitter.It makes me itch.So I will not use 7 of the items.</li>
    <li> Cant wait to order another one!</li>
    <li> I was worried since there are so many bad reviews. But I just received my makeup And I love it. Out of all of it. Only a couple items I would not wear. I love all that I got. I would have liked some mascara, but again I am very pleased with the make up I got. And will be ordering more. Thank you.</li>
    <li> Not as happy this time around. Got a lot of the same stuff and some of the stuff looked old. And the concealers and foundation were all medium tan. And the eye shadow was crushed up.</li>
    <li> It was a variety, but the blue eyeshadow was leaking and got over the other cosmetics,so I threw the eyeshadow away,and wiped off the other items. All item&#x27;s were individually wrapped, so that made it easier to wipe off w/o being damage.</li>
    <li> omg i love it i love every thing i got even the eye liner</li>
    <li> Got more lipsticks than I will ever use and they are horrible colors. I wanted more eye liners and eye shadows. I got this one and the 25 piece one and they both sucked.</li>
    <li> This is not at all what I expected, we should have been able to pick what colors we wanted, DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY</li>
    <li> After reading the reviews I read I was kind of iffy about my purchase, when I opened the package I was pleasantly surprised and immediately wanted to order another 15 pieces! None of my product looked opened or anything! The only thing I had a problem with is purple eyeliner and green mascara! I mean who actually wears those two colors together? Maybe ppl a lot more daring than myself but hey it&#x27;s all in what you like! I&#x27;d recommend this purchase to anyone!!!</li>
    <li> If you are a little adventurous and a lot cheap, this is great fun.  High quality cosmetics to play with, a less than $1 per item.  Wow.  I am ridiculously pleased about this.  Good job Bozleys.</li>
    <li> Really happy about this purchase loving it thank youuu!!!</li>
    <li> I think it was old product. Next time if the Customer can pick it would be much better. It was ok</li>
    <li> I was skeptical of buying this due to some of the reviews but I thought I&#x27;d take a chance . I was very happy when I got my packages ( I ordered this one and the 25 piece one)&lt;br /&gt;I felt that this seller took special time or to hand select each of my items, it was like Christmas for me. I loved every item I got.m Thank you so much and I will definitly be a returning customer.</li>
    <li> I am pleased with everything I received except one item- it was a pretty eye color that was dried out.  :(  Still, 14 items for 15 bucks that I am very satisfied with. I even received a bottle of foundation and a tube of amaaaazing whipped concealer!  The items that weren&#x27;t my taste I gave to my teenage daughter which worked out well seeming how her lil brother got into her makeup and ruined some of it. Win-win and I would definitely purchase again .. Would make a great gift for someone as well..</li>
    <li> got lots of stuff like eye stuff,face stuff and much more&lt;br /&gt;if you were to buy them one piece at a time all of them would cost like 50 dollar but this is very a great deal</li>
    <li> LOVE THIS ITEM!!!MUST ORDER!!!!loved this deal I am going to order another everything was brand new never opened I just orderd another 5 piece and on my way to order the 15 piece. THANK YOU I LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS !!!!!!!!!</li>
    <li> The selection was great for my daughter. She loved it all. I also loved the style and color combinations.  Awesome for young or old.</li>
    <li> Totally in love with this makeup. Colors are awesome. Having a lot of fun with it. Have three daughters and they are having a blast with it too. Will be ordering more.</li>
    <li> Loved this Lot.....Amazing Selection and Seller even added a bonus!&lt;br /&gt;Very Happy with my purchase</li>
    <li> I got my stuff within maybe 3 days and i was happy with everything i got. I got lip gloss, correction creme, eye brite, eye shadow and eye liner AND NAIL POLISH ALL SPARKLY!  and my new best friend lip plump serum. Id buy again definitely.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m really satisfied! I actually got 1 extra piece. I&#x27;m fairly new to make up and wasn&#x27;t sure what to use so this totally helped me out! You get what you pay for. I defiantly recommend it for beginners figuring out what kind of products such at eyeliner, lipgloss and stick, eye shadow, and foundation. I would buy it again!</li>
    <li> Only received 13 pieces .</li>
    <li> I haven&#x27;t gotten any duplicates, or broken items &amp; I&#x27;ve ordered 4 of these lots. great deal!</li>
    <li> Bought 2 of these, one for my Daughter and one for her friend for Christmas. It all came today in one box and it looks like someone swept them off the floor at a wharehouse somewhere and dumped them in a box. Dont waste your money like I did folks!!!</li>
    <li> In all honesty, I am not much of a risk taker and normally I would balk at spending money on products that I didn’t hand pick myself. I’m so glad I took a chance on this purchase! After purchasing the lot, I sent a request to the seller for any face makeup to be in the colors to be in fair/light if it were possible. I received a quick response from the seller (which is Vera’s Boutique, just a head’s up in case the supplier changes) that they would make note of my request and I’m happy to report that I received the colors I wanted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I received 16 products (2 were duplicated of concealer, but no complaints here.) In my lot, I got 1 cc cream, 1 liquid foundation, 3 concealers, 1 cc tinted moisturizer stick, 3 lip glosses, 1 nail polish, 3 eyeliner pencils, 2 roll on shimmer eyeshadow sticks, and 1 eyeshadow tin. The only colors that I’m not too stoked on are the purple and green eyeliners, but I’ll definitely try them out anyway. All in all, I am definitely happy with my purchase and I would order again.</li>
    <li> I wish I could give a negative rating. The makeup was old and most of it unsealed. One of the lipsticks was open &amp; used!</li>
    <li> I recieved my bag of goodies yesterday. I was shocked at how quickly it arrived. Only 3 days after I ordered! I immediately brought my loot upstairs and poured the contents of the bag onto my bed to check it out. I was having visual overload! Everything was so colorful and pretty. I was nervous that most everything would be for my lips or something I dont use much of. But I git such a great assortment that the day after, I&#x27;m ordering again!!! I cant believe my luck. I got this 6 shade concealer thing (which works very well especially after I YouTube&#x27;d it and figured out how to apply it) about 2 lip glosses, 2 lip pencil&#x27;s, eyeliner, mascara, a face toner/ highlighter combo, a few eye shadows, eye lash magnifying grower serum stuff, and sime eye glitter and.. You get the point. So I came back and compared and decided to hope for the best (hoping I dont get the same exact stuff ordering so close together) and purchased this same package again. I again, cant wait to see what comes! I would definitely recommend this seller and product. BUY IT!</li>
    <li> I liked the pieces I got. I would have liked to pick my items as I was paying but they sent a lot of eye stuff which is what I like to focus on.</li>
    <li> nice little pieces i recieved. one eyeliner&#x27;s seal was broken but other than that i can&#x27;t complain. great for makeup risk takers.</li>
    <li> I thought it was a great value, it did come with colors that I am unable to use. Thank You</li>
    <li> I got a mixture of fun colors and lots of products I will use. I did, however, receive an eyeliner that was opened and lightly used and a bottle of shimmer cream that had no lid at all! I endedup with shimmer cream on everything in my package. There was also a three pack of eye shadow that was shattered and unusable but that may have happened during shipping. I found a similar lot on ebay from a different seller and was much happier with that one than the one I received from this seller on amazon so I doubt I&#x27;ll buy anything more from this seller.</li>
    <li> I love everything I got. I actually think I ended up with more than 15, considering I recieved some products that had an eye shadow, plus and eye liner duo. I think This deal is by far worth it, most hard candy products go for 6-8 dollars at Walmart and all of their makeup is really nice. I will be ordering again!!</li>
    <li> Well a few items were open. One broken lipstick. Green liquid eyeliner.. seriously..&lt;br /&gt;Orange lipstick..&lt;br /&gt;Wish I would of known I got the clown package..</li>
    <li> I purchased this for my 15 year old as stocking stuffers. I have to say I was quite impressed, so much so I&#x27;ll be ordering one for me! There was even a bonus too. This is a very cool lot!</li>
    <li> I just received my hard candy makeup and I love it! I even got an extra piece! I did get some lip gloss/lipstick that is a little bright for my taste but maybe I&#x27;ll get some balls and actually try something new since I&#x27;d never buy anything that  bold. All in all I&#x27;m satisfied, I&#x27;m excited to get out of my neutral pallet and try something new!</li>
    <li> Bought from this seller a couple of times now, It&#x27;s always exciting to get this in the mail because you never know exactly what you&#x27;re getting. It&#x27;a a nice surprise. :) I always receive my package in just a couple days. I personally can&#x27;t always find use for every single product I get in the package, but most of it I do use and I love it! Either way you&#x27;re getting this alooooooot cheaper than you would in the stores. I even got a extra piece. Very pleased with my purchase. I would recommend this for anyone who loves makeup or experimenting with it.</li>
    <li> I recived 21 pieces all sealed 3 days after ordering. and i am pleased with everything. everything was sealed. will be buying again.</li>
    <li> Nothing was wrong with what the seller did I just have recently figured out I don&#x27;t like Hard Candy products.</li>
    <li> I love all of this makeup very pretty colors</li>
    <li> The set i received was amazing! Except for 1 or 2 pieces that didnt match my skin tone other then that yassss</li>
    <li> I love this. I got it in like 4 days and I actually got a few sample size things so it was more than 15 pieces. I only got one thing that didn&#x27;t have a seal on it and it was a pink lipstick no big loss. I got some of my favorite colors and the face products that I got were for pale skin like I had requested. I&#x27;m very happy and want to get another one of these just cause I love mystery boxes and makeup is awesome., Plus I know the cheapest I&#x27;ve ever seen Hard Candy Products is like four dollars so 15 pieces for 11 bucks is awesome.</li>
    <li> False advertising. Only hard candy brand. Colours ofered are not useful</li>
    <li> I received The BEST Things ever! I didn&#x27;t think so, by looking @ the pkg(s)..  I had 3 Lipglosses with breath freshener ( I Smoke). They came in Pink, Nude color, and a red. Lipsticks that were cute and glided on smooth. Green eyeliner, Eye Shimmer Cream, Loose Glitter Color eyeshadow pigments, and Loose glitter eyeshadow in Gunpowder! Absolutly Fabolous products thus far! Btw...2 Nail polishes with Rings in Red and Glitter with accents!  MUST BUY!!! OR KEEP ON THE SHHH!</li>
    <li> I love the assortment of hard candy products that I received. I was very pleased and I immediately ordered another 15 pieces! :) the picture is from like 2 1/2 orders!</li>
    <li> Seriously love everything I got. Everything was still in the packages and nothing looked like it was used. The only question I have is would I get different makeup in my next purchase. If so I&#x27;d gladly purchase this again.</li>
    <li> They were all in perfect condition but some of them are useless for me. Like the glitter eye shadow. It arrived in Xmas eve like I expected cause it was a gift.</li>
    <li> I am not bet picky With my makeup so I was pretty happy with my purchase a few of the things I got I do not like which was expected and I did receive 16 items not 15 but one of the things was broken so really I only got 15 items out of this</li>
    <li> I really like what I got. The extras were great too. Its a good price for what you&#x27;re getting.Would definitely order again.</li>
    <li> It&#x27;s OK, received some things like green eye liner and never go to use and another one dry, but for the price is ok.</li>
    <li> Great I loved it purchased a second one</li>
    <li> Love the products received 18 instead of 15! I like trying new products no matter the price and these are perfect!</li>
    <li> I received some nice items for the price. Very pleased, everything was sealed.</li>
    <li> Got a lot of stuff that i dont use and some things were broken when they arrived. would not purchase again.</li>
    <li> Some items were damage in shipment.</li>
    <li> Received some things I couldn&#x27;t use and the box of eye shadow tattoo things says there should be three in a box but it was in bad shape, definitely not new and sealed, and it only had one pair of tattoos. Not sure where the other two went. Oh well.</li>
    <li> Just got this 4 days after purchasing as a little treat to myself and I&#x27;m SO happy. only 1 item is a little sketchy as its lipstick that was half sealed but still thats 14 pieces!! For expensive makeup, this much for this little money is a amazing deal and I&#x27;m so so so happy with what I got.</li>
    <li> I got sixteen items. I&#x27;m ordering again. All were packaged and sealed up. I love it!! Very impressed. Making another review as soon as I get my other order. I highly recommend this to anyone!!</li>
    <li> I am happy with the things I got. Didn&#x27;t get doubles and even when mail services lost my package I swiftly received a new order. Would buy again. Definitely makes good party favors.</li>
    <li> I received it today and got fifteen different beautiful pieces of make up. I am ordering another set right now.</li>
    <li> So the first review I see on here is negative &amp; it made me hesitate but there were some really good reviews and I took a chance. I am glad I did because I absolutely Love this set. Everything is sealed in its original packaging.&amp; Not dry ! I received lip &amp; eye products . I love the lip colors! They are lip glosses, glossy lipstain,glossy lip pencil, a lipstick ❤  .For the eyes I liked the variety from duo eye color eye-shadow pen,hot smudge shadow,eyeglitter,duo eye-shadow,loose powder, sample mascara,and glitter eyeliner . I am very content with my order and i do recomend this for others (:</li>
    <li> Only one piece I wouldn&#x27;t use,  lipstick to dark but other than that I&#x27;m very happy.</li>
    <li> Loved it &amp; it arrived on time!</li>
    <li> Got my order today got money then I thought. Loved the colors!</li>
    <li> Got some great products and great colors. Shipping was fast. Pretty upset though because they seem as if they are all discontinued products and old..also had some that were broken. Was told that I would be shipped replacements..after being told they would arrive 3 days ago they are still not here.&lt;br /&gt;Not really happy!!</li>
    <li> I bought 4 sets as gifts and each friend that received 1 said Hard Candy makeup is amazing and they were in love with the variety there was. There was no duplicates at all</li>
    <li> I&#x27;m so happy with my purchase, I love it! I was expecting it at the 19 but I just got it right now ,wow! Fast :-), everything was new in good condition , the only thing was I told the seller i want more mascara and I don&#x27;t want dark lipsticks and I received some dark lipsticks and just one mascara :-/ but is ok I still love it !</li>
