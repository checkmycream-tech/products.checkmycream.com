      <li>This product is not the best eye primer out there that&#x27;s for sure.</li>

      <li>It&#x27;s a good product for me.  </li>
      <li>Good product.</li>
      <li>Of course after hours of use it doesn&#x27;t look that good</li>
      <li>What I found out is that when I use my fingers I get a great smooth blend of my eyeshadow application, the brush is good too.</li>
      <li>I am thrilled I could by it on Amazon and the seller got it to me within days of ordering it.</li>
      <li>I dont know if its popular or if its because the purchasers dont know that they should be ordering this.</li>
      <li>This is a wonderful product bought 2 will order more ialso use the de-creaser for my laugh lines buy it</li>
      <li>Nice applicator and easy to apply.</li>
      <li>I was on the hunt for an effective eye primer that was also easy on the wallet, and I thought I found it in L&#x27;Oreal De-Crease.</li>
      <li>I am so glad I got it.</li>
      <li>If your eye shadow is sheen-y/shimmery, you will be able to see the color of the primer.</li>
      <li>I love this product</li>
      <li>I do not like the wand, and I think it would be better if you could squeeze the contents out.  </li>
      <li>am more satisfied with my elf $1 primer than this one</li>
      <li>love loreal products  </li>
      <li>Love the product don&#x27;t like the applicator want.</li>
      <li>I even forget I have it on - love</li>
      <li>I stopped being able to find this in stores which is why I resorted to buying online.</li>
      <li>So I did some research on Amazon and was referred to Loreal and love it.</li>
      <li>Great product for the eyeshadow to stay in place , it really does the job of not letting it crease and lasts all day on .</li>
      <li>I love how smooth this goes on; lasts all day and makes adding eye shadow a breeze.</li>
      <li>The price is good, the quality; not so much.</li>
      <li>My only siggestion is when you put some of your eyelids blend it in well and apply your eyeshadow and you will see the beautiful outcome of your makeup.</li>
      <li>this worked fine</li>
      <li>Enjoy</li>
      <li>When I use it my eyeshadow lasts all night no matter how detailed I get.</li>
      <li>As far as decreasing it doesn&#x27;t do a good job of that either.</li>
      <li>I do not gets creases in my eye shadow regardless of how long my day is, great product.</li>
      <li>I wear it alone as a clean look</li>
      <li>I bought this product because I needed something cheap and quick at the time, and I must say, you get what you paid for.</li>
      <li>Dries quickly -- saving you time.</li>
      <li>I definetely reccomend Urban Decay Primer Potion because it works amazing and makes Loreal Decrease look like a joke.</li>
      <li>It came super fast too.</li>
      <li>However, I gave it a try and the staying power was just decent - nothing special.</li>
      <li>Make sure when your applying it on your eyelid not to be in front of a fan or a/c because it tends to dry it out quick</li>
      <li>It doesnt not blend well with your skin tone and my eyeshadow still creased within the first couple of hours, and faded very fast.</li>
      <li>But on my first try it did.</li>
      <li>Unfortunately, I have to continue my search for the nearly perfect AND inexpensive primer.</li>
      <li>I love it, especially at this price!  </li>
      <li>For it to go  smoothly and seamless don&#x27;t apply it in front of something blowing air .</li>
      <li>This is one of my first primers and i regret wasting 8 dollars on it.&lt;br</li>
      <li>Used it for the first time today.  </li>
      <li>I do have to touch-up my eyes when its hot and humid though, but not as much.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;ve used other shadow bases/primers with much better success.  </li>
      <li>The amount they give you is abundant, but definitely not worth investing in.</li>
      <li>doesn&#x27;t go on very well with the applicator</li>
      <li>but it really worked.  </li>
      <li>Bought this at Walmart for what I thought was wayy too much given the amount.</li>
      <li>Fast shipping.</li>
      <li>My skin gets really oily around the eyes</li>
      <li>But doesn&#x27;t seem like there&#x27;s much product in here</li>
      <li>but then the whole thing dries out.</li>
      <li>I highly recommend it.</li>
      <li>The picture of the de-crease eye shadow depicts a smooth wet and liquid based product, sort of like lotion or liquid eye liner.</li>
      <li>I&#x27;m cheap (spent $9 on this product)</li>
      <li>For the price, i&#x27;d expect way more, and i used it everyday once.</li>
      <li>Seemed to not be full and was a bit dry...</li>
      <li>I live in Arizona.  </li>
      <li>but i think id rather spend the money on a higher end eye primer like urban decay.</li>
      <li>I purchased it and tried it today for the first time and it still looks the same as I put on my eye shadow this morning.</li>
      <li>(once I get it on the lid, I use a finger to blend) and I like that the tube is clear</li>
      <li>it goes on smooth, blending into the skin tone without a &amp;#34;cakey&amp;#34; appearance or a heavy, oily feel.</li>
      <li>I thought because the reviews were old that it had been rectified.</li>
      <li>This is not as pictured and appears old.</li>
      <li>maybe old?</li>
      <li>I may need to adjust how far up</li>
      <li>other than those two things, it&#x27;s a pretty decent product.</li>
      <li>It seems like the bottles are half full too.</li>
      <li>the product dried pretty quickly on my eye, so I was left with unattractive streaks that made it obvious</li>
      <li>I would not say it removes crinkles but does help calm them down.</li>
      <li>This primer has many things wrong with it:  -Too much color.</li>
      <li>It lasted about 8 hours, which is decent i guess, but i had to apply a lot to get this long of a life out of my eyeshadow.</li>
      <li>(hides those little capillaries and discoloration in tired eyes) or as a primer, and both uses work great and last for hours.</li>
      <li>It&#x27;s not the best but its less expensive than some other things.</li>
      <li>this is the only product that has ever worked to completely eliminate the creasing of my eyeshadow.  </li>
      <li>I saw older reviews that this product was caked and dry when arrived.</li>
      <li>The wand is just totally unnecessary; it would be better if it were just a tube</li>
      <li>This will last a long time generally for me being that I don&#x27;t wear much makeup on a daily basis.</li>
      <li>Been trying to find a decent base but wasn&#x27;t successful until now.</li>
      <li>Very small container, that doesn&#x27;t really go on smooth.</li>
      <li>Not just that, when I pulled the top off, it was all clumpy inside and clumps on my eyes, and is not smooth, feels heavy on my eyes.</li>
      <li>L&#x27;Oreal needs to go back to the drawing board with this one because it is a major \\&quot;fail.\\&quot;</li>

<li> Delivery was fast but 2 small and dry....</li>
<li> but too much comes out on applicator and hard to spread, so it does not soak in but blobs on my eyelid.</li>

<h2>All Reviews</h2>

<ol>
    <li> doesn&#x27;t go on very well with the applicator</li>
    <li> Hated it. Will not buy again. Maybe my bottle was just bad or something but this product just flakes off my skin after it dries and looks horrible</li>
    <li> Item as described. Fast shipping.</li>
    <li> Did not like this product at all. I&#x27;ve used other shadow bases/primers with much better success.  The ads say this product can be worn alone and is great for any complextion. Not true.  It looks chalky alone and I didn&#x27;t see any benefits from using with my eye shadow.</li>
    <li> This primer has many things wrong with it:  -Too much color. If your eye shadow is sheen-y/shimmery, you will be able to see the color of the primer. Not cool.  -Cakey, not smooth.  -I agree with the \\&quot;most helpful critical review\\&quot; in that the wand is silly. The wand is just totally unnecessary; it would be better if it were just a tube and you squeeze a bit onto your finger tip.  -Doesn&#x27;t last.  -Takes long to dry. Therefore, your eye shadow does not go on well unless you give the primer lots of time to dry.  -Too expensive for the quality; I should have just paid twice as much and gotten a high-quality primer.</li>
    <li> Seemed to not be full and was a bit dry...maybe old?</li>
    <li> I was on the hunt for an effective eye primer that was also easy on the wallet, and I thought I found it in L&#x27;Oreal De-Crease. Watching the reviews on YouTube by numerous gurus led me to the conclusion that this primer was going to be the be-all end-all of eye primers. However, I gave it a try and the staying power was just decent - nothing special. The major concern I had was with the finish, as it took quite alot of blending to achieve at least a semi-natural finish. Trouble was, the product dried pretty quickly on my eye, so I was left with unattractive streaks that made it obvious I applied some sort of product to my eyelids.. meh! The amount they give you is abundant, but definitely not worth investing in. Doesn&#x27;t work well for semi-dry eyelids like mine.     Unfortunately, I have to continue my search for the nearly perfect AND inexpensive primer.</li>
    <li> I live in Arizona.  I have combination skin and somewhat oily eyelids.  I never noticed that my eyelids were oily until I started trying to wear eyeliner!  The eye shadow base does not work that well unless you also top it with power, even then the liner on my upper lid smears.  Worse yet, the container is not easy to use.  I do not like the wand, and I think it would be better if you could squeeze the contents out.  It seems like the bottles are half full too.</li>
    <li> I always use De-Crease as it helps to keep my shadow from fading. I always had this issue int the past but this eye primer keeps my shadow on for at least 7 or 8 hours. I do have to touch-up my eyes when its hot and humid though, but not as much.</li>
    <li> This product is not the best eye primer out there that&#x27;s for sure. I was not really pleased with this at all for one is seems like the product dryed up before I got a chance to use it. As far as decreasing it doesn&#x27;t do a good job of that either. L&#x27;Oreal needs to go back to the drawing board with this one because it is a major \\&quot;fail.\\&quot;</li>
    <li> I still crease but the color stays longer than it does with competitor&#x27;s products like this. My skin gets really oily around the eyes so I guess I&#x27;ll continue to search for a product to combat this and eliminate the creasing.</li>
    <li> I have been looking for a base for a long time now and tried NYX and it is ehhh ok. So I did some research on Amazon and was referred to Loreal and love it. I purchased it and tried it today for the first time and it still looks the same as I put on my eye shadow this morning. This product is great!!! It is better than the NYX base and would recommend anyone to this product. My only siggestion is when you put some of your eyelids blend it in well and apply your eyeshadow and you will see the beautiful outcome of your makeup. What I found out is that when I use my fingers I get a great smooth blend of my eyeshadow application, the brush is good too. I think either way works as long as you have on the Loreal base. Good product.</li>
    <li> Love the product don&#x27;t like the applicator want. I wish it was a small squeeze tube.</li>
    <li> I have used this item for about 3 times and I can&#x27;t remember if i noticed the results or not.&lt;br /&gt;I suppose if I have not noticed double or triples lines of my eyeshadow by the time I get home from work then it is doing something.</li>
    <li> my favorite shadow base</li>
    <li> Not happy at all with the results and am quite surprised that people found it useful. The product distibutes unevenly and makes my eyelids look as though it was dry and peeling. I guess this is what people describe as \\&quot;cakey\\&quot;. The silly applicator wand also dries out within a few wks and about 80-90% remains stuck in the tube so you have to cut it in half (carefully by rolling a knife back and forth) but then the whole thing dries out. I&#x27;m cheap (spent $9 on this product) so I&#x27;m trying really hard to make this product work for me anyway I can.     If you put enough dark shimmery eyeshadow on, it will cover up the cakey dry look. I think I&#x27;ll splurge and try the urban decay primer that everyone else is saying works so well.</li>
    <li> Overall I like it! Of course after hours of use it doesn&#x27;t look that good but it lasts descent amount of time!So I would buy it again!</li>
    <li> I bought this product and used it all within two weeks. For the price, i&#x27;d expect way more, and i used it everyday once. It lasted about 8 hours, which is decent i guess, but i had to apply a lot to get this long of a life out of my eyeshadow.</li>
    <li> Bought this at Walmart for what I thought was wayy too much given the amount. I&#x27;ve used probably 15-20 times now and it&#x27;s basically gone. I bought this because my eyeshadow did not stay on and would crease every time!. I have slightly oily eyelids and it would just crease and smudge and ugg! I put this on every time I use eyeshadow now and it does work. It&#x27;s not the best but its less expensive than some other things. However, it doesn&#x27;t do a thing when used on creme eyeshadow so beware!!</li>
    <li> this is the only product that has ever worked to completely eliminate the creasing of my eyeshadow.  I definitely recommend!</li>
    <li> love loreal products  non irritating  this worked fine</li>
    <li> Delivery was fast but 2 small and dry....</li>
    <li> I love this product it&#x27;s the greatest invention ever!</li>
    <li> I bought this product because I needed something cheap and quick at the time, and I must say, you get what you paid for. It doesnt not blend well with your skin tone and my eyeshadow still creased within the first couple of hours, and faded very fast. I would not buy this product again. The price is good, the quality; not so much.</li>
    <li> I&#x27;ve used this product for a few years and I like it!  It not only does what it claims, but wearing it alone helps make your eyes look brighter.  It&#x27;s a good product for me.  I think the trick is to use a small amount and not cake your lids with it.</li>
    <li> This primer has a silky &amp;#34;whipped&amp;#34; texture and it goes on smooth, blending into the skin tone without a &amp;#34;cakey&amp;#34; appearance or a heavy, oily feel. I wear it alone as a clean look (hides those little capillaries and discoloration in tired eyes) or as a primer, and both uses work great and last for hours. I even forget I have it on - love how lightweight it feels!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have noticed that depending on the day, the primer begins to flake a bit closer to my brow line. I may need to adjust how far up I use the primer and/or apply moisturizer to the area before use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#x27;ve previously used Too Faced Shadow Insurance Primer, which works, but it&#x27;s four times the price and the product separates in between uses - ugh (and try shaking a squeezy-tube - doesn&#x27;t work so well). In contrast, the fuzzy applicator in this L&#x27;Oreal tube works great (once I get it on the lid, I use a finger to blend) and I like that the tube is clear so I can see the product inside.</li>
    <li> I was so excited to finally get something to work as a natural base for my eyes, but as soon as i cut the package open, the little container broke and it was all cracked. Not just that, when I pulled the top off, it was all clumpy inside and clumps on my eyes, and is not smooth, feels heavy on my eyes. Very disappointed. You get what you pay for.</li>
    <li> I have used L&#x27;Oreal De-Crease for years and it works wonderfully, so imagine my dismay when I went to buy some and was told they had discontinued it.  I am thrilled I could by it on Amazon and the seller got it to me within days of ordering it.</li>
    <li> It actually works!  Used it for the first time today.  A little thick but it really worked.  Been trying to find a decent base but wasn&#x27;t successful until now.</li>
    <li> I don&#x27;t like how hard it is to rub in and when I do it shows up really white . I don&#x27;t recommend it</li>
    <li> I just got this so, I&#x27;m still learning if this is going to work. But on my first try it did.</li>
    <li> I would not say it removes crinkles but does help calm them down. Nice applicator and easy to apply. Dries quickly -- saving you time. I got the darker of the two Ivory colors and like the way it lightens up the dark caverns around my deep set eyes.</li>
    <li> Unfortunately, this product dried up too quickly inside the bottle, and I felt I hardly got any actual use out of it.</li>
    <li> This is a wonderful product bought 2 will order more ialso use the de-creaser for my laugh lines buy it</li>
    <li> My eyeshadow stays put all day with no creases.  I love it, especially at this price!  I haven&#x27;t had any issues with clumping or unevenness.</li>
    <li> This primer doen&#x27;t work at all. Halfway through the day, my eyeshadow&#x27;s compeletely gone! I definetely reccomend Urban Decay Primer Potion because it works amazing and makes Loreal Decrease look like a joke.</li>
    <li> This is one of my first primers and i regret wasting 8 dollars on it.&lt;br /&gt;1-It&#x27;s lasting power is horrible&lt;br /&gt;2-When you put it on your lid it turns into a powder basically&lt;br /&gt;3-Does not help in pigmentation of eyeshadows&lt;br /&gt;I am more satisfied with my elf $1 primer than this one</li>
    <li> Keeps shadow in place.no creasing and very nice base!</li>
    <li> Very small container, that doesn&#x27;t really go on smooth. This wastes what is already a small amount. I don&#x27;t have allergy issues and it does keep eye makeup in place, once it is smoothed. However, I think I will keep looking for something that goes on smoother, and doesn&#x27;t waste money for the amount it costs.</li>
    <li> Great product!  I highly recommend it.</li>
    <li> This works well...but too much comes out on applicator and hard to spread, so it does not soak in but blobs on my eyelid.</li>
    <li> I bought this as I was tired of having my eye shadow wear off or leave creases on my eye lids. This works to make the eyeshadow stay on longer but if you wear your make-up for too long it still ends up creasing, but at least this extends the time it takes for the eyeshadow to crease.</li>
    <li> I use this product every day because I am tired of my eyeshadow creasing all the time after like 2 hours. So, I read about this in a review on Google and decided to try it out myself. I get up at 7am and by eyeshadow doesn&#x27;t crease until 8-9pm. So, it last a long time! I recommend this!</li>
    <li> This is a great eyeshadow primer. You can&#x27;t beat the price and the product. It came super fast too. I am so glad I got it.</li>
    <li> I have used the expensive eye shadow bases for years and sometimes they would dry up in the container before I was able to use all of it. L&#x27;Oreal Pans Decrease Eye Shadow base is inexpensive and works great. I do not gets creases in my eye shadow regardless of how long my day is, great product.</li>
    <li> I saw older reviews that this product was caked and dry when arrived. I thought because the reviews were old that it had been rectified. I received this product this evening and it was 2 days earlier than expected. But upon inspection i noticed that the liquid inside was caked and dried out. I applied it to my skin and it was like rubbing dirt on it. I am filing to have a replacement or a refund since a return cannot be given. The picture of the de-crease eye shadow depicts a smooth wet and liquid based product, sort of like lotion or liquid eye liner. This is not as pictured and appears old.</li>
    <li> Doesn&#x27;t hold eye shadow the way I hoped it would.</li>
    <li> If I don&#x27;t use this primer my eyeshadow is creased within an hour. When I use it my eyeshadow lasts all night no matter how detailed I get. I&#x27;ve used several other brands including a very expensive brand and none work as well as this does. I stopped being able to find this in stores which is why I resorted to buying online. It comes sealed and packaged and is the same quality as what I used to buy at the drugstore.</li>
    <li> Buy this if you&#x27;re looking for a product tht does what it&#x27;s supposed ot do. only downside is tht the container&#x27;s small</li>
    <li> If you have problem with greasy eye lids this is the perfect product for you....eyeshadow stays on all day.. Enjoy</li>
    <li> it burns a little when you apply it but it seems to do the job of a primer. but i think id rather spend the money on a higher end eye primer like urban decay.</li>
    <li> I loved his product.  once you put it on and let it set a minute or two my eyeshadow seemedto glide on like silk and stayed put throughout the day.</li>
    <li> Great product for the eyeshadow to stay in place , it really does the job of not letting it crease and lasts all day on . Make sure when your applying it on your eyelid not to be in front of a fan or a/c because it tends to dry it out quick and then it leaves like a whitish thing on your lid. For it to go  smoothly and seamless don&#x27;t apply it in front of something blowing air .</li>
    <li> I love how smooth this goes on; lasts all day and makes adding eye shadow a breeze. This will last a long time generally for me being that I don&#x27;t wear much makeup on a daily basis. I&#x27;m happy with this.</li>
    <li> Great price for a product I already loved!</li>
    <li> This is very difficult to find. I dont know if its popular or if its because the purchasers dont know that they should be ordering this.</li>
    <li> Don&#x27;t buy this .. It looked expired and when I try to get some out it won&#x27;t come out .</li>
    <li> I really like this eye primer since it mattifyes my lids and makes my eyeshadow stay put, there are only two things i can find wrong with this product: 1. my eyeshadow&#x27;s gone within a few hours and 2.  it a little on the dry side. other than those two things, it&#x27;s a pretty decent product.</li>
    <li> Product works great! But doesn&#x27;t seem like there&#x27;s much product in here</li>
</ol>
