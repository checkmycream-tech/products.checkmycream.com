<h2>All Reviews</h2>

    <li> Bought for a Dell Inspiron 14 5000. Fits perfectly and gets lots of compliments.</li>
    <li> The design is very cute but the size is very off. My 14&amp;#34; laptop swims in this case. I was so excited to receive this but now it just sits in the closet 98% of the time.</li>
    <li> I love it!  A pocket on the side would be even nicer, but its great!  Laptop fits perfectly!</li>
    <li> My daughter is very happy with the sleeve. Fits her laptop perfectly  and the inside is very soft.</li>
    <li> This case is so pretty and very well made. The inside is lined with very soft material.  Love this case.</li>
    <li> I am a chrom book and it fits perfectly in this case. It&#x27;s protective and cute!</li>
    <li> Great looking sleeve. It fits my 14&amp;#34; Kenovo Yoga 3 perfectly!</li>
    <li> The colors are much darker and richer than in the picture, which it good. It&#x27;s even cuter in person! It also fits my EliteBook 8470p perfectly, so you can use it even it it&#x27;s not mac.</li>
    <li> Great buy for a good price. Arrived on time, good material and fit my HP Pavilion 14&amp;#34;.</li>
    <li> Fits the laptop I bought it for without being too snug. I had noticed the width measurements of some sleeves was very narrow so I was concerned that if they weren&#x27;t expandable or elastic the laptop wouldn&#x27;t slide in easily. And if the laptop didn&#x27;t slide in easily, my daughter won&#x27;t wrestle with it (won&#x27;t use it!), defeating the purpose. The laptop I bought it for is just over 1 inch in thickness.</li>
    <li> I LOVE THIS CASE SOO MUCH. IM SO GLAD I FOUND IT ON HERE BECAUSE THE CASES IN THE STORES SUCK! it is exactly how the picture describes it. The case fits my ASUS 14&#x27;&#x27; laptop perfectly and I can even fit a folder, my charger and headphones in there. Its very colorful and the inside of the case is very soft. It was worth all my money!!!</li>
    <li> Perfect size and description is perfect. love it!</li>
    <li> use this for a variety of purposes, i.e. small brief case, ipad, etc.  works great with the laptop too!</li>
    <li> I love this adorable lap top case. The fabric is a bit brighter than the picture and has a really fun boho vibe. Great quality! Love the soft interior lining. I&#x27;m super happy with this product!</li>
    <li> This is so cute!  Vibrant colors and a decent padding plus the price make this a great value.  I would recommend to anyone</li>
    <li> This case is very pretty.  It goes well with the aqua colored hard case my daughter chose. It&#x27;s roomy for the Mac air even with its hard case on.  But this is ok-- it&#x27;s easier to get the laptop in and out. The colors are deeper than they look in the picture.</li>
    <li> Love the case, have gotten many compliments from random people. It came in only a few days. The colors are a little less vibrant in person than in the picture which actually i liked better.</li>
    <li> Bought this 14\\&quot; sleeve for a 14\\&quot; Sony Vaio Fit. Fits perfectly!! The sleeve appears well made and is a bit of whimsy compared to the run of the mill cases out there in this price range...but it SMELLS. The exterior material may be canvas but it must be treated with waterproofing or something cuz it smells like stinky rubber chemical smell... hope it fades with time. Plan to air out in the sun. Would be a 5 other than that. Shipped fast, price was good.&lt;br /&gt;*UPDATE on stink:&lt;br /&gt;I must say that the smell persisted for almost a month...finally off gasssed. The sleeve itself has held up well to daily use, and cleans up easily with a damp cloth.</li>
    <li> I absolutely love this laptop case!! It is very durable yet soft for my laptop.  It fits the 14&amp;#34; chrome book perfectly. I recommend this company because they are reliable and their products do not brake. Also, it is very cute and the material does not appear cheap! The price is very good for this product.</li>
    <li> The colors are a lot darker than in the picture, but it arrived very quickly and fits my laptop (Acer Aspire MTouch, a 14 in) perfectly. The only negative is that the lining is not super thick, but I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;d be much of an issue unless you like to run your laptop over with a bus</li>
    <li> Excellent interior padding, good quality construction and zipper. Fits Toshiba Satellite 14&amp;#34; E45-B4200 (from bestbuy) nicely.</li>
    <li> The colors are darker than in the picture, but it&#x27;s still cute. I love the fabric, and it fits my 14&#x27;&#x27; Asus Vivobook pretty well.</li>
    <li> Outstanding cover.  Exactly what I ws looking for at a very good price.  Would highly recommend this product to anyoone one looking for a laptop cover.</li>
    <li> Love this and it was such a great price and good quality!</li>
    <li> like the colors, roomy enough for the battery.</li>
    <li> pretty and work well to carry my kindle and tablets plus the charging cords.</li>
    <li> Very nice looking and performs as advertised.  A present for my gf, she loves it. Even more colorful and attractive in person.</li>
    <li> Loved this laptop sleeve . So colorful and really useful. Please continue to have more of these coming out.&lt;br /&gt;Thanks !</li>
    <li> Love it!  I&#x27;ve purchased two of these covers, the patterns are a little different from each other.  Perfect for protecting my little laptop when not in use.  Would recommend.</li>
    <li> Color is a little off than what it shows</li>
    <li> Cute, fun, and sturdy.</li>
    <li> Got it for my MacBook Pro 13, and it is gorgeous, soft interior, sturdy zipper, and really appeals to my bohemian style.</li>
    <li> Bought this for my daughter as she went off to college... she is thrilled with this case. She loves the pattern and how it protects her computer. Great product!!</li>
    <li> This canvas case holds my daughter&#x27;s new rubber case and computer just right.  It is colorful, hard to miss and great to use for traveling.</li>
    <li> Great quality and fits my daughter&#x27;s 14&amp;#34; laptop perfectly. It protects her laptop and the pattern and colors are really nice. Beyond my expectations.</li>
    <li> Case is lovely and colorful. The inside is very soft and the outside is pleasant. Fit my computer well (14&amp;#34; Lenovo U430 Touch) and seems sturdy so far.</li>
    <li> Its stunning and of good quality... I am using it for my lenovo u410 and fits perfectly.. I love this case. looks juss amazing..</li>
    <li> Love it! Only issues are that I wish it had a handle and it had a strange odor when I first got it.</li>
    <li> This is a fun alternative to a typical laptop case.  My laptop fits snug inside which I like.  This provides some cushion to protect my laptop.</li>
    <li> I like this case a lot. I like the design and my laptop fits perfect in it. I would recommend this</li>
    <li> I love this!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pros:&lt;br /&gt;Very sturdy. Fabric is tight, and I don&#x27;t believe it will degrade over time. Adorable colors! Bright and vivid and exactly as it&#x27;s shown - possibly prettier in person! Zipper is well made and comfortable to use.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cons:&lt;br /&gt;Won&#x27;t fit in my laptop bag! But that&#x27;s not the fault of the product, I&#x27;m just being whiney &#x3D;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would definitely recommend this product and would buy again if I have the need.</li>
    <li> Best laptop case! I bought this knowing it was cute, and fashionable and may not last long. However, it is still in great condition and I love it everywhere I go! Perfect fit for my 14&amp;#34; Dell laptop! Not too tight, not too loose! Love it!</li>
    <li> This was my best purchase in a long time! way better than i expected. The inside is crazy soft, the padding is good. I use this everyday, it provides perfect protection from all the stuff in my backpack :)</li>
    <li> I ordered this for my lenovo Flex 2 14. The colors are about a shade or two darker than the picture but, I think it looks cuter irl than in the picture. The corners of the case are a little too round for the laptop so, I when I close it I have to be a little bit more careful closing it. Also, the case really smelled when it arrived. Fortunately, I did not need the case right away. To remove the smell,  I stuck a dryer sheet inside and zipped up the bag for 2 days. After that, I inverted the case and stuck in a new dryer sheet again for two days. It took like a day after for the harshness of the smell to dissipate and now it doesn&#x27;t smell.</li>
    <li> The product was just a beautiful as I had imagined and shipped faster than ever expected.</li>
