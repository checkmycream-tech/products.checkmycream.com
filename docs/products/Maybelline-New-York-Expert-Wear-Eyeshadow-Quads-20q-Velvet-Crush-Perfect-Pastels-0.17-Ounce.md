<li> The only complaint I would have is the brushes are small &amp; hard to handle.  </li>
<li> /&gt;It is hard to find lavenders with greys.</li>
<li> I usually do the lightest as a base, the medium on the lid extending slightly past the crease and may touch the corners and crease with the darkest shade that is not the &amp;#34;liner&amp;#34; if nighttime.</li>

    <li> Lavender is typically tricky to wear but I can with this palette.  Most of these quads are good stuff.  I will say I never use the &amp;#34;liner&amp;#34; color because I use pencil eyeliner...I have never wanted to draw liner on with eye shadow.  I also don&#x27;t know if most woman have the surface area of exposed lids to put on too many colors.  And unless you have that surface area, darker colors are going to make eyes appear smaller.  I usually do the lightest as a base, the medium on the lid extending slightly past the crease and may touch the corners and crease with the darkest shade that is not the &amp;#34;liner&amp;#34; if nighttime.</li>
    <li> I love the color combination and the diagram on how to apply the colors. Just beautiful as more expensive brands.</li>
    <li> Items is as advertized</li>
    <li> The only complaint I would have is the brushes are small &amp; hard to handle.  Also, where you are to apply each color is imprinted in the powder, so if you wear it off, you won&#x27;t know which shade is to be applied where.</li>
    <li> It was cracked when I received it.</li>
    <li> I really liked this eyeshadow.... But I&#x27;m not the biggest purple fan. I only got it because I was Lucy ball for halloween. Anyway great product</li>
    <li> it&#x27;s just ok for me. I have this in two different colors and for the price it does the job</li>
    <li> Goes on well, last a long time, colors are a bit lighter than I like. Overall,  I would recommend this product.</li>
    <li> The colors are very nice and this last all day- stays on with no creases pretty shades of purple- good purchase</li>
    <li> The kit arrived scratched. But I liked it.</li>
    <li> blends well together just amazing</li>
    <li> This is the BEST combination of colors that I have found in eye shadows!  Crease proof and long wearing.  The color combinations are smokey but neutral and give a bit more dimension than browns!  Love this product.</li>
    <li> Was easy to put together. The chart is helpful in telling you how to apply the eyeshadow</li>
    <li> Great product - love the colours</li>
    <li> Great colors, great palette, very pleased. True to color, easy to use, stayed on.</li>
    <li> Best choice and best price</li>
    <li> Liner is not very dark, and there isn&#x27;t enough contrast between the lid and crease colors to have an enhancing effect.</li>
    <li> Great combo of colors. Great Quality product. I totally recommend this to anybody who likes to wear light cold colors. They go perfect with my winter clothes. I can even wear with that goes good with this colors, not only winter clothes and still goes perfect.</li>
    <li> Great mixture of colors and long Lasting wear</li>
    <li> I love these colors, and been looking a long time since I threw away a Revlon set in the early 90s. But even with primer they dispense very pale and don&#x27;t stay for long.</li>
    <li> This is a reliable product and very consistent. you can count on it to be the color it looks and very economical</li>
    <li> I love these colors and they are more matte then shine which I like. Soft colors and all complement each other.</li>
    <li> Great Product, I love the color and it has a goog explanation of how to use it....I recomend it..It is good!!</li>
    <li> This is one of the eye shadow quad that you can just grab and you&#x27;ll know the colors will work for you. I love experimenting with different colors and this really bring out your eyes. My favorite is the shimmery brown/ mauve which goes on perfectly and has great lasting power. Go for it!</li>
    <li> Nice colors.  Look good if you use a good eye primer.  More purple looking than pictured here.  Smokey grey color makes buying the quad worth it.</li>
    <li> The makeup goes on smoothly and is fairly enduring. I don&#x27;t however like that the accent and crease colors on tend to blend almost too well together. In my opinion, its not worth the extra steps to put both of them on since you can&#x27;t see the difference/definition. I do however overall like the colors and the makeup.</li>
    <li> This is one of my favourite eye shadows.  I have used it for many years, and the quality is consistently very high.  Good colors, great lasting wear, easy and smooth application.</li>
    <li> Can&#x27;t beat it for the price</li>
    <li> Great colors great price arrived quickly&lt;br /&gt;enabled me to bring less make-up on my trip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is hard to find lavenders with greys.</li>
